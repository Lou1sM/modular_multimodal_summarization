    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/02/2006\n\nBrooke accuses Taylor of cheating on Ridge. Taylor claims that Hector was just trying to be a friend. Meanwhile, Hector confesses to Brooke that he loves Taylor. Brooke becomes upset and storms off. Taylor makes Hector leave.  Later, Taylor asks Brooke not to tell Ridge, that she will tell him herself. Brooke is extremely upset by the entire situation. Jackie goes to help out at Nick and Bridget\u2019s house. She questions Nick about what his life would have been like if had chosen Brooke. Thorne and Darla discuss Taylor and Ridge. Thorne sticks up for Taylor and claims that she would not give in to Hector\u2019s advances, but Darla is hesitant to believe this.",
