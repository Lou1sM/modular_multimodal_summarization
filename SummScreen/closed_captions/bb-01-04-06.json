    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/04/2006\n\nBrooke visits Nick and tells him about Hector and Taylor. She asks his advice on what she should do. Nick says that Taylor is accountable for her actions, and wonders why Brooke cares so much. Taylor and Stephanie discuss how much Taylor misses Ridge. Taylor confides in Stephanie about Hector, and what happened on New Year\u2019s Eve.  Stephanie is extremely shocked. Thorne, Darla, and Sally are interviewing candidates to become the new receptionist at Forrester. They interview three people, and none of them are right for the job. Thorne then offers the job to Sally.",
