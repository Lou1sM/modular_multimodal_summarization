    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/04/2007\n\nAs they prepare for the fashion show, Jackie again begs Nick to forgive her. George from the Marone Board tells Nick that the board members remain skeptical and their confidence in him rides on the success of this fashion show. Taylor goes to Nick\u2019s office to tell him that he needs to forgive his mother in order to be truly happy again. With Taylor\u2019s help, Nick realizes that he will always love Jackie and forgives her, but he makes her promise she will never speak of the men she slept with in Seattle again. Jerry Kramer arrives and Stephanie tells him she invited him over for a surprise reunion with one of his closest friends, Jackie Payne. Jerry remembers Jackie and although he knows that given their past relationship this reunion might not be a good idea, he agrees and then leaves. Thorne enters and is shocked to hear Stephanie and Ridge talking about Jackie\u2019s history as a prostitute. Thorne is worried that revealing this information Taylor learned in Nick\u2019s therapy sessions will ruin her career. Stephanie thinks that getting the company back and making Eric happy is the most important thing, Thorne agrees.",
