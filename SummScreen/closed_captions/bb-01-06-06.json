She tells him about the kiss with Hector, but he says that it doesn\u2019t matter. She then also tells him about the night she shared with James. Nick tells Bridget about Taylor and Hector. The two are worried that Stephanie will try to interfere no matter what the cost. Stephanie tells Brooke to keep her mouth shut about Taylor and Hector. Brooke tells Stephanie that Ridge and Taylor\u2019s marriage is falling apart and that Stephanie can\u2019t do a thing to save it.",
