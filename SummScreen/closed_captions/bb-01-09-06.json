He eventually forgives her for what happened between her and James. Taylor is relieved for a moment, until Ridge tells her that he can never forgive her for the way she has treated him and especially Brooke. Stephanie tells Brooke to stay out of Taylor and Ridge\u2019s business. Bridget tries to discuss her mother with Nick, but he is hesitant to bring her up. Brooke stops by to tell them about her conversation with Stephanie.",
