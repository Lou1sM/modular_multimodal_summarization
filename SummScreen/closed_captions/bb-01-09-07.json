As Brooke and Ridge continue to be bombarded by reporters, Thorne debates coming to their aide. He doesn\u2019t want to upset Taylor, but in the end he stands by their side. Taylor is shocked and angered to see Thorne on television breaking his promise not to use Jackie\u2019s past against the Marones\u2019 again. George urges Nick to sell Forrester Creations to save Marone Industries but Nick refuses.  George then tells Nick that the Marone board has decided that Nick will no longer be the CEO of Marone Industries. Ridge receives a call from George informing him of that Nick has been fired as CEO and wants to have a meeting to discuss selling Forrester Creations back to the Forresters.  The Forrester family rejoices. Eric begins to forgive Ridge.",
