He says that he doesn\u2019t recognize her anymore, and leaves for the evening. Felicia overhears a phone call that Stephanie makes to Taylor and questions Stephanie about it. Stephanie tells her that there is a problem with Ridge and Taylor\u2019s marriage, and she is afraid it is over. Bridget questions why Brooke isn\u2019t going after Ridge again. The sexual tension builds between Nick and Brooke, as Bridget is oblivious.",
