    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/11/2007\n\nJackie is worried that Eric will no longer respect her, but he insists that everyone makes mistakes and he understands. Stephanie arrives to gloat about getting Forrester Creations back, but Eric informs her that because of her actions they don\u2019t own Forrester and never will. Eric is angry and throws her out, much to Jackie\u2019s delight. Eric apologizes for Stephanie and Jackie kisses him. When she arrives home, Stephanie asks Pam to keep Jackie away from Eric while she\u2019s away visiting their mother in Chicago. Alexandria becomes angry with Hope and insists Thorne wouldn\u2019t marry Taylor if she killed Darla. When the girls go inside Taylor and Brooke think they have had a fight. Taylor tries to help Aly resolve it, but she refuses to talk. Thorne arrives and apologizes to Taylor and they decide to still get married. After they leave, Hope admits to Brooke that she told Aly that Taylor killed Darla. Brooke tries to call Taylor to warn her but they are in the middle of talking to Aly about her fight with Hope and Taylor ignores her. Aly finally tells Taylor and Thorne what Hope told her and begs Taylor to tell her she didn\u2019t kill Darla.",
