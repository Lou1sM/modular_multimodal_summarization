Ridge calls Taylor and asks her to meet him up at the Big Bear cabin. Hector tries to convince Taylor to move on with him, but she is insistent that things will work out with Ridge. Ridge and Taylor meet at Big Bear and Taylor tries to apologize. Ridge calls Taylor a hypocrite and does not respond to her apologies. Nick tells Jackie that Ridge and Taylor are having problems. When Brooke shows up, Jackie leaves and Brooke proceeds to tell Nick that Taylor slept with James. Nick realizes how bad the situation really is and asks Brooke to not get back together with Ridge.",
