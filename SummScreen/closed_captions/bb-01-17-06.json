    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/17/2006\n\nRidge says he will not forgive Taylor, and insists that he is in love with Brooke. Ridge tells Taylor that their marriage is over. Stephanie asks Hector to stay away from Taylor and tries to blame everything on him. Hector refuses to believe this and will not comply with Stephanie\u2019s requests. Nick desperately pleads with Brooke not to get back together with Ridge. She tells Nick that she still loves him, but that they should definitely not act on those feelings. Brooke then realizes that Ridge might be ending his marriage with Taylor in order to pursue a relationship with her.",
