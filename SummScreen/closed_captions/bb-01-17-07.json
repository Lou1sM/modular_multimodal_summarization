    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/17/2007\n\nRidge confronts Taylor about her relationship with Nick. Pamela, Eric and Felicia discuss Thorne and Taylor\u2019s wedding and whether or not Aly will be able to forgive Taylor. Felicia and the family try to convince Aly that what Taylor did was a mistake and that she should forgive her. Taylor and Thorne tell Aly they can wait as long as she needs to get married. Aly knows that everyone is upset so she tells them to go ahead with the wedding. Later, she takes pictures of Taylor and Thorne and colors over Taylor\u2019s face in all of them. Bridget visits Nick and Jackie at work.  Nick tells Bridget that Taylor\u2019s therapy has helped him move on with his life and he and Brooke have signed their divorce papers. Jackie is surprised to learn this. They all think that Taylor is marrying Thorne for the wrong reasons. After Bridget leaves, Jackie asks Nick to stop the wedding. Nick refuses saying he\u2019s leaving it up to fate.",
