    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/18/2006\n\nRidge and Taylor tell their kids that their marriage is over. The kids are upset over the news and don\u2019t know how to react. After the kids leave, Taylor then tells Ridge to leave, because she wishes to be alone for a while to think. Meanwhile, Brooke is trying desperately to get a hold of Ridge and tell him not to end his marriage. She is unable to reach him on the phone, so she rushes off to Big Bear to stop him. Stephanie tells Eric that Ridge and Taylor are having problems. Eric tries to tell her to stay out of it and let them figure things out, but Stephanie is too afraid of Brooke stepping in.",
