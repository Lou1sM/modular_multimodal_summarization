    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/19/2006\n\nBrooke tries to convince Taylor that her and Ridge can work things out, but Taylor tells her that it\u2019s over.  Taylor continues to insult Brooke until she finally snaps back and calls Taylor a hypocrite.  Taylor then tells Brooke to go ahead and give Ridge everything hat she never could.  Ridge tells Stephanie that his marriage with Taylor is over.  He then accuses her of not caring about his real happiness and admits that he is still in love with Brooke.  Ridge tells Stephanie that he intends to ask Brooke to marry him.  Nick tells Bridget about her mother\u2019s visit.  Bridget asks Nick not to make things difficult if Brooke decides to get back together with Ridge, but he seems uneasy with the thought.",
