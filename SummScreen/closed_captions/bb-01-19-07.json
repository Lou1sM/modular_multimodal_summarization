    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/19/2007\n\nBrooke offers Donna a job a Forrester Originals, but Donna declares her loyalty to Nick and Forrester Creations. Eric\u2019s attorney warns him that using the Forrester name could possibly bring a lawsuit but he doesn\u2019t care. Everyone gathers for the exciting press release and debut of Forrester Originals. Nick and his staff watch from a TV in his office. Eric and Ridge assure their loyal patrons they will still receive the wonderful craftsmanship they have always received from the Forrester family. They introduce Brooke in a new Forrester Original gown.  Ridge ends up proposing to Brooke on the runway and she accepts.  Nick is angered by their use of the Forrester name and by Ridge using a publicity stunt to propose to Brooke.  Storm thinks they should sue the Forrester\u2019s for using it, but Nick plans to beat them by buying out all of their high-end distributors.",
