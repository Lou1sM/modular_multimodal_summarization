    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/24/2007\n\nNick offers to buy all of Arthur\u2019s boutiques. Arthur needs time to think about it. Nick has Storm draw up the necessary documents.  Pamela tries to convince Eric to call Stephanie as Jackie sneaks upstairs. Jackie undresses, slips into the master bath with some champagne and waits for Eric to enter. When he does, Jackie attempts to seduce him but he remains loyal to Stephanie. He is called away to work and Jackie tells him she\u2019ll wait for his return. Pamela finds Jackie in the bathtub, tells her she needs to respect Eric and Stephanie\u2019s marriage and packs up her things. Thorne asks Bridget if she\u2019s heard anything about Taylor falling for Nick. Bridget decides to find out for herself and heads over to Taylor\u2019s house. Phoebe asks Taylor if there is anything going on between her and Nick and Taylor tells her they are just friends. Nick arrives to give Taylor the sunglasses that she left at Chuck\u2019s. As he reaches into his briefcase she notices a picture of her with Thorne and Alexandria. Nick tells her it was going to be her wedding present. Taylor realizes this picture was Nick\u2019s way of showing support for her no matter what path she chooses. They embrace and Bridget walks in to see it. She is shocked and scolds Taylor for hurting Thorne.",
