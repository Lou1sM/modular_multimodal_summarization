    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/26/2006\n\nKristen arrives and thinks the idea of Eric and Stephanie remarrying is insane.  Eric defends Felicia\u2019s idea of wanting peace within the family.  The family is coming together all under one roof just like Felicia wanted.  Meanwhile, Dr. Namura examines Felicia and says that her pain is and condition is worsening.  Felicia still believes that after she is gone, her parents won\u2019t break up.  However Nick learns from Jackie that Eric has proposed to her, but on his way to tell Felicia he sees the condition Felicia is in and becomes sympathetic to the situation.",
