    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/26/2007\n\nRidge tells Brooke he overheard Rick talking to her last night about their relationship and knows he is skeptical. He promises Brooke he will prove himself to Rick. Phoebe has a dress fitting for an upcoming fashion show. The family gathers for a meeting with Eric. He reminds them that Nick will stop at nothing to destroy them and announces they will debut their designs in two weeks. Ridge wishes the Brooke and Nick\u2019s divorce was final so they could get married. Nick tells Jackie that he has spoken with all of the distributors of Forrester Originals and made offers to buy all of them. Jackie is hesitant about such a risky venture and is afraid they are spending too much money. Nick is sure that destroying Forrester Originals will bring Brooke back to him.  Rick visits Nick and tells him that he is sorry to hear that his marriage to Brooke ended. Storm tells Donna he is unsure about Nick\u2019s move to buy out all of the distributors. Donna fantasizes about being with Nick. Donna breaks the news of the Forrester Originals fashion preview in two weeks to Nick and Jackie.",
