    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/29/2007\n\nStorm and Jackie share their concern about the money Nick is spending to buy all of the distributors. Mr. Chen arrives and Nick offers to buy his company. Chen agrees to sell his company to Nick even though he feels guilty about betraying Eric. Brooke and Ridge are suspicious of how quiet Forrester Creations has been. Brooke tells Phoebe that when the time is right she wants her to take over as spokesperson for Forrester Originals. Brooke arrives at Forrester Creations to talk to Nick but becomes suspicious when Jackie refuses to let her see him and doesn\u2019t tell her why.  Jackie tries to tell Brooke that her true happiness lies with Nick. Nick enters triumphant after his meeting with Chen and Brooke wonders what plan he has up his sleeve. Nick tells Storm about his plan to buy out all of the Forrester Originals distributors. Rick admits to Ridge that he blames him for the public relations mess that Forrester Creations is in. He also blames him for Brooke\u2019s failed marriage to Nick. He warns Ridge not to underestimate Nick. Nick and Phoebe talk about the sale of Forrester Creations and bond over their feeling of loss.",
