    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/30/2006\n\nAfter Stephanie and Eric state their vows the children express their concern whether the marriage will be a success. Meanwhile at the Forrester office, Taylor admits to Hector that she has accepted the fact her marriage to Ridge is over but she doesn\u2019t regret it.  With that said it allows Hector to step up and present himself to Taylor as a man who would feel for her what Ridge feels for Brooke.  Back at the wedding festivities Ridge admits that what he is doing to Taylor has to be hurting her greatly. While dancing with Eric, Felicia collapses then quickly awakens and is all right, though the family knows the end is near.",
