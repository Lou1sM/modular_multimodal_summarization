    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 1/31/2006\n\nBridget is surprised to hear about Eric and Stephanie\u2019s wedding and sad she missed the party with Felicia. As Bridget and Dante converse, Dante expresses that he is deeply moved by what Taylor is going through and Bridget convinces Dante that he is just a friend Taylor will need at a time like this.  Back at the Forrester offices, a bitter stand off begins when Ridge blames Hector for breaking up his marriage. Hector boldly tells Ridge to stay away from Taylor because he will now look after her. Taylor hands Eric her resignation and expresses her true feelings about her marriage to Ridge.  She then tells Ridge she\u2019s quitting Forrester and that their marriage is over, Ridge says he\u2019s sorry making Taylor upset.",
