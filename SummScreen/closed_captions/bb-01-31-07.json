    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 1/31/2007\n\nRidge asks Phoebe for help in winning Rick over before a family dinner. Ridge, Brooke and Phoebe are shocked to see Rick\u2019s disheveled state. There is tension between Ridge and Rick when work is brought up. Ridge wants to know about Nick\u2019s visit earlier and Brooke downplays it. Rick wants to know why Brooke and Nick ended their marriage, but Brooke and Ridge keep quiet. Later, Rick teaches Phoebe the constellations as they lay and gaze at the stars. Brooke catches a glimpse of Rick and Phoebe laughing and is glad to see Rick happy. Stephanie arrives home early and asks Eric if he\u2019s happy to see her. Stephanie thinks that Pam will feel out of place at the engagement. She inquires about Jackie, and Pam tells her that Eric wasn\u2019t interested in her. Eric tells Stephanie he needs more from her to make their marriage work. He tells Stephanie to make some changes, including ending the war with Jackie. They agree to start over.",
