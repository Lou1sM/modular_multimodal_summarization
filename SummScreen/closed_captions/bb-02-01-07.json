Brooke tries to reason with him about his feelings towards Ridge telling him that she is happy with him. She asks him to sing at their engagement party but he declines. Pam helps the Forrester\u2019s put the final touches on their new office. Stephanie marvels at what they have accomplished while she\u2019s been gone. Eric shows the family the designs he\u2019s been working on. He and Pam discuss the engagement party and Eric tells her he\u2019s designed a dress for her to wear to the event. Ridge tells Stephanie about his fears towards Rick and Phoebe\u2019s relationship. As Stephanie surveys the new Forrester Originals showroom, Nick arrives. They argue about whose company will prevail in the end. During a fitting Ridge and Phoebe discuss Rick. Ridge is bothered by the way Phoebe has befriended him and is defending him. Later, Ridge voices his distaste for the budding relationship between Phoebe and Rick to Brooke. Rick arrives and Ridge tells him that if he can\u2019t accept his relationship with Brooke he should stay away from Phoebe.  Nick and Jackie discuss distribution strategy and agree they must secure the European market. Thorne explains to Taylor that Ally still isn\u2019t able to forgive her for killing Darla. He believes he can help her but he needs to do it alone. They agree that for Ally\u2019s benefit they must end their relationship and share a final kiss and a goodbye.",
