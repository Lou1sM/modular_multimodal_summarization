Nick tries to comfort Bridget and cheers her up by making her laugh.  Meanwhile, Hector fantasies about Taylor, it influences him to go over and see her. Unfortunately Taylor is annoyed with Hectors attention and does not want to see him. Later, Thomas urges Ridge to help out Taylor, which he agrees to and admits to Thomas he still does love her. Ridge calls Taylor, yet Taylor says he does not need his help.  As Taylor gets off her cell phone in her car, she is emotional and distracted and her car swerves off the road.",
