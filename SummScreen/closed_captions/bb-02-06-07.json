    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/06/2007\n\nYvette tries to avoid Stephanie\u2019s questions when asked whether they will carry Forrester Creations line or Forrester Originals line, which causes Stephanie to tell Ridge that she feels suspicious about Yvette meeting with Nick and Jackie. Phoebe is upset with Rick and tells him that she\u2019s not a toy to play with; she\u2019s hurt by knowing he\u2019s a ladies\u2019 man. Later, Phoebe asks Stephanie how she had found her Prince Charming while Stephanie makes sure that Phoebe knows that Nick is the real enemy, not her and Ridge. Meanwhile, Rick tells Brooke that Ridge threatened his life if he crosses the line with Phoebe but Brooke still encourages Rick to spend time with Phoebe. Rick then later tells Nick that Ridge threatened him and Nick reassures Rick that he is in his corner. Brooke confronts Ridge about threatening Rick as they discuss Rick and Phoebe\u2019s relationship. Brooke feels that they should spend time with each other but Ridge disagrees. To his dismay, Brooke insists that they will be understanding, welcoming, and encouraging of Rick and Phoebe\u2019s relationship.",
