    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/08/2007\n\nPhoebe admits to Rick that she only went on the date with Shane to see how Rick would react. Nick spies Rick and Phoebe leave the Caf\u00e9 Russe as they realize Shane has already left.  Later at Brooke\u2019s garden courtyard, Phoebe asks Rick what he truly thinks about her and he tells her all the wonderful things he thinks about her. Brooke watches their exchange and smiles at their joy but feels uneasy about their growing relationship. Nick and Storm talk business and try to set up a meeting with Harvey Golden (a fashion distributor). Storm sees Brooke enter and exits abruptly as she takes a seat at the bar which causes Nick to quickly hide the documents he had spread out before him. While he talks to Brooke about Rick he can tell there must be friction between Ridge and Rick. Pam tells Ann about the dress Eric designed for her. Meanwhile, Eric tells Stephanie that it is her turn to take responsibility for Ann and that he has decided that Pam and Ann are staying in Los Angeles.",
