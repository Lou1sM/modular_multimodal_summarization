    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/12/2007\n\nStephanie points out all the future problems between Rick and Phoebe to Brooke, including the two being step-siblings and how the relationship will harm Brooke and Ridge. Harvey Golden will sell his chain of boutiques with the agreement that Nick will owe him a favor. Nick signs the contract despite his worries. Storm looks over the contract and confirms its legality. Nick tells Jackie that the Forrester Originals\u2019 new collection will have no buyers. Eric shares his excitement for the show with Jackie, who feels slightly guilty that he could be shattered at the show. She tells him there will always be a position for him at Forrester Creations. Stephanie and Jackie argue about who supports Eric more. Phoebe reassures her dad not to worry about Rick. Ridge mentions that the success of the show could force Rick back to Paris to setup an international division.",
