    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 2/13/2006\n\nFelicia and Dante are in a heated discussion about the possibilities of Dante being Dominick\u2019s father.  Meanwhile, Bridget and Taylor talk about their losses; Nicole and Ridge.  Bridget tells Taylor that she fears that Nick is only with her because of the baby, but now that the baby is gone, Nick is free to be with Brooke.  Nick tells Brooke how much he cares for Bridget, and Brooke is thankful that he is there for her.  Nick takes Dominick to spend the night with him and Bridget, but sees that Dante has something important to tell him.",
