    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/13/2007\n\nAll of the preparations for the fashion show have been made. Rick tells security officers that Nick and Jackie are not allowed near the fashion show. Rick points out to everyone backstage that the showroom audience is small. Felicia finds out none of the buyers checked into their hotel suites. Everyone frantically searches for answers but no one is available to comment. Eric has no choice but to cancel the show.  Nick and Jackie announce, at a press conference that is broadcast on television, the partnership and expansion of Forrester Creations and Jackie M. The Forresters have shocked reactions to the news. Eric realizes that with Nick\u2019s purchases he has no where to sell his designs. Stephanie leaves to confront Nick.  Stephanie pleas to Nick to not hold her family accountable for the wrongs she committed towards him. Nick reveals he blames everyone who supports her. Pam and Eric embrace when she tries to console him.",
