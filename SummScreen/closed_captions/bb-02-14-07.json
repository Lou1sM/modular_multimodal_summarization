    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/14/2007\n\nThe Forresters try to secure buyers as they process what took place. Ridge suggests selling to departments stores. Eric turns down the idea. Eric\u2019s solution lies in opening Forrester Original shops worldwide to distribute its own product; their own chain of boutiques. The family decides the risk of opening the boutiques is a frontrunner, but Ridge won\u2019t be part of it. Nick, Jackie, Donna, Storm, and Clarke bask in delight. Jackie feels bad for Eric. Nick and Jackie agree that Forrester Originals could only sell to department stores or sell their name. Taylor receives flowers from Nick and he asks her to dinner on Valentine\u2019s Day. Phoebe objects to Taylor\u2019s relationship with Nick. Taylor has a daydream about Nick. Brooke asks Nick to stop the war against the Forresters. Brooke asks Nick to consider Jackie M to carry the Forrester Originals\u2019 new line. She is shocked when she learns of Nick\u2019s date with Taylor.",
