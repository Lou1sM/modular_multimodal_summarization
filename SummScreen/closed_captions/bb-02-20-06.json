Everyone is gathered for the service and a rosebush was planted in the garden in memory of Nicole.  After the service, Nick confronts Felicia and asks her what he is supposed to do now that he is no longer Dominick\u2019s father.  Bridget questions Dante\u2019s history with Felicia and why he is spending so much time with her.",
