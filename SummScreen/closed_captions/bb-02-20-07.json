Pam is hurt that Stephanie is angry and she tells Stephanie that she will have to deal with it.  The Forresters hold a meeting where they decide to open a small chain of Forrester Originals in all the major cities around the world.  Meanwhile, Rick tries to make excuses for not being able to give Phoebe a ride, but she pushes it and jumps into the truck.  Rick admits to Phoebe that Ridge has told him to stay away from her but she promises not to tell her dad about the ride.  Rick\u2019s truck then breaks down and he calls Brooke to let her know what is going on, but tells her not to say anything about Phoebe being with him.  A worried Taylor calls the office because she cannot get a hold of Phoebe and Brooke admits that Phoebe is with Rick.  Ridge is not happy that Brooke hid the truth from him and wants to send Rick back to Europe to keep him away from Phoebe.  As Rick and Phoebe wait for help, they share a kiss.",
