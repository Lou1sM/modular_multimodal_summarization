    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 2/21/2006\n\nNick is upset with Felicia for lying to him about the baby and wonders how the news will affect Bridget.  Dante tells Bridget how sorry he is that she lost her daughter, but something wonderful will happen.  Bridget is a bit confused by Dante\u2019s words.  Meanwhile, Taylor tells Ridge that she\u2019s doing fine without him, possibly even better than him, since Brooke is making Ridge jump through hoops to be with her.",
