    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/21/2007\n\nThe sexual tension between Rick and Phoebe is evident; there is a definite connection between them.  As they lean in to kiss again, Brooke calls Rick and tells him that she told Ridge that he was with Phoebe.  Later at Brooke\u2019s house, Ridge is so upset with Rick that he intends to throw him out once he gets home. Brooke pleads with him not to throw Rick out and they begin to argue.  When Rick and Phoebe arrive home, Ridge makes Rick leave and Phoebe defends their relationship by telling Ridge that they have kissed and that she is in love.  Meanwhile, Taylor and Nick are flirting and decide to play strip poker.  Taylor is winning and both of them are enjoying each other\u2019s company.  As they are kissing Taylor notices a St. Christopher medal around Nick\u2019s neck and she asks about it.  Taylor is upset to find out the medal was a gift from Brooke, but Nick takes it off to symbolize that his relationship with Brooke is over.  Taylor is happy again as they kiss and their growing connection is evident.",
