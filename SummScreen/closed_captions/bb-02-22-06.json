    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 2/22/2006\n\nFelicia tries to ensure that Bridget will still look after Dominick after she dies.  Stephanie is upset with Dante for telling Nick about Dominick on the day of the memorial, but is glad that he did not say a word to Bridget.  Dante believes that Bridget should not be with Nick, because he is in love with Brooke.  Stephanie insists that Nick and Bridget have grown closer in the past few months.  Nick tells Brooke the news about Dominick, yet she is uncertain that the paternity test is true.",
