    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/22/2007\n\nRidge tells Phoebe that a relationship with Rick would be wrong because they were both raised as Forresters, but Phoebe tells Ridge that he cannot keep her from seeing Rick.  Phoebe is angry and goes to her room when Brooke (who was outside, off camera talking to Rick) tells her that Rick has left.  Ridge tells Brooke that Rick has kissed Phoebe and they continue to argue over the relationship, but Brooke agrees to try and talk Rick into backing off for the sake of the family.  Rick arrives at Bridget\u2019s and asks to stay the night telling her that Ridge kicked him out.  Bridget leaves for the hospital when Brooke arrives to talk to Rick.  A tearful Brooke pleads with Rick to end things with Phoebe now because the future of the family depends on it.  Meanwhile, Nick and Taylor agree that they will always have feelings for their ex\u2019s but both are ready to start something new and exciting.  They talk about raising children and Taylor realizes the pain that Nick feels for not having a child in his life.",
