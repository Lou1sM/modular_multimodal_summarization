    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 2/23/2007\n\nContinuing at Bridget\u2019s, Brooke tries to convince Rick that his involvement with Phoebe is wrong, while Ridge, still at home with Phoebe, tries to tell Phoebe that she should be involved with boys her own age.  While Phoebe stands firm about what she felt when she kissed Rick, Brooke persuades Rick that a relationship with Phoebe would put a strain on the family and that they\u2019d also endure the pressures of the press and Stephanie.  With Ridge in the background, Phoebe calls Rick and he breaks it off with her telling her that a relationship is just too complicated for them.  Rick\u2019s heart is heavy as he asks Brooke to leave.  Later, Ridge tries to comfort Brooke saying they avoided a disaster and that the kids would thank them one day.  A heartbroken Phoebe visits Rick and demands an explanation for breaking it off.  Phoebe spills her heart to Rick about what she felt when they kissed and all he can tell her is that he is sorry.  She runs out of the house crushed and Rick rushes after her.  He is heartbroken as well and they melt into a passionate, romantic kiss in the rain.",
