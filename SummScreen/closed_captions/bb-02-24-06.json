    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 2/24/2006\n\nBridget tells Dante that she can\u2019t raise Dominick with him, even though she knows that is what he wants, because she is married to Nick.  Later, Nick tells Bridget that he feels he can\u2019t raise another man\u2019s child, so Bridget begins to feel that Nick is no longer committed to their marriage.  Ridge walks in as Stephanie tells Brooke she should be with Nick.  Ridge grows angry with Stephanie and finally stands up to her.  Ridge then proposes to Brooke in front of Stephanie.",
