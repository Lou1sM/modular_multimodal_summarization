    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/01/2007\n\nTaylor and Nick are grateful they have found one another. As they sleep, Nick is awakened by the severe rocking of the boat. He sees a tanker headed straight for the boat and rushes Taylor out just as the tanker rips though the Marlin. Nick searches the water for Taylor\u2019s body. He finds her and performs mouth to mouth resuscitation to save her life. Rick confesses to Bridget that he can\u2019t stay away from Phoebe even if their relationship if causing a rift between he and Brooke. Jarrett arrives to get an exclusive story about Brooke and Ridge\u2019s wedding and they are thrown off when he asks about Phoebe and Rick\u2019s relationship. Brooke and Ridge downplay their involvement and Stephanie assures Jarrett the Forrester scandals are a thing of the past. Stephanie is concerned that the exposure of Rick and Phoebe\u2019s relationship to the press could spell disaster for Forrester Originals. Brooke informs Rick that the press has gotten wind of his relationship with Phoebe. Rick doesn\u2019t think his relationship is anyone else\u2019s business. Stephanie arrives and demands to know the truth about Phoebe and Rick. From their silence she deduces they are still in love and vows to tell Ridge everything if that\u2019s the truth.",
