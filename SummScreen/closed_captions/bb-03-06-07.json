    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/06/2007\n\nBrooke goes to Nick\u2019s house to give him a home-made DVD from Hope and finds that Nick is with Taylor.  Meanwhile, Stephanie tells Ridge what she heard; that Rick and Phoebe were planning on sneaking up to Big Bear.  Ridge decides to drive up there.  Brooke calls Ridge and Ridge tells her that Phoebe and Rick are up at the Big Bear cabin and he and Stephanie are headed up there.  He lets Brooke know that he will put an end to Rick and Phoebe\u2019s relationship.  Up at the cabin, Rick and Phoebe are enjoying their time alone as the sexual tension rises between them.  Ridge and Stephanie walk in on Rick and Phoebe\u2019s romantic set-up, and Ridge confronts Rick.  Brooke gets to the cabin and is upset to see Ridge holding Rick\u2019s shirt about to use physical violence.  Back at Nick\u2019s place, Nick tells Taylor that he is with her because he wants to be and they make love.",
