    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/07/2007\n\nRidge is furious with Rick and grips Rick\u2019s collar until Brooke pleads with him to let go.  Brooke then admits that she\u2019s known about the continuing relationship which further infuriates Ridge.  Stephanie insists that Ridge can not marry a woman who lies to him.  Brooke takes Rick into a separate room to continue to plead with him to end the relationship with Phoebe.  Brooke makes Ridge and Stephanie leave the cabin with her leaving Rick and Phoebe there alone to talk.  Brooke gets through to Rick and makes him see he needs to end it with Phoebe for now.  Rick is somber as Phoebe declares her love for him.  On the way home, Brooke tells Ridge she will not tolerate him striking her son and Ridge apologizes.  Meanwhile, Nick reassures Taylor that Brooke is in his past, just like the Marlin.",
