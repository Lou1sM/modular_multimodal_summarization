    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 3/08/2006\n\nRidge turns to Massimo for comfort with dealing with the death of Felicia. Massimo takes Ridge to see Brooke, hoping that will cheer him up. Nick arrives, sees Massimo downstairs and rushes up to see what Ridge is doing with Brooke. Nick peaks through the door to see what seems like Ridge and Brooke making love (though they are actually not). Taylor starts to heavily drink at Chuck\u2019s Bar and is deeply upset that she wasn\u2019t there for Felicia. She opens up to Hector about how she wants Ridge back.",
