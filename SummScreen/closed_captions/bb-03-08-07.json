    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/08/2007\n\nJackie visits Nick at the house and is sad for him when she sees Nick was watching Hope\u2019s DVD.  Jackie tells Nick that there still could be a chance for him and Brooke and she is happy to hear Brooke\u2019s wedding might be canceled, until she sees Taylor and realizes that Taylor and Nick are sleeping together.  Jackie senses how important Taylor has become to Nick, but Taylor can feel the favoritism that Jackie has for Brooke.  Taylor is not affected by Jackie, but she feels threatened by Nick\u2019s connection to Hope when she sees the DVD on the TV screen over his shoulder in a hug.  Meanwhile up at the cabin, Rick puts the brakes on his relationship with Phoebe and tells her he loves her, but he thinks they need to cool down and act like mature adults until they can win over the family.  After he leaves, Phoebe declares that she refuses to believe that things are over between her and Rick.",
