    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/09/2007\n\nThe Forresters critique some new designs and decide to add them to the new line.  They discuss Rick and Phoebe, and all of them think that relationship is wrong.  Stephanie continues to badmouth Brooke and is adamant that the wedding will not happen, but Ridge tells her that he doesn\u2019t want her interfering with him and Brooke.  Felicia changes the focus of the subject and the Forresters talk about pursuing a new fragrance line; everyone likes the idea and is ready for the challenge.  Meanwhile, Rick is busy in his office when he receives a phone call from a \u201cmystery woman.\u201d  He is too distracted to recognize the voice on the phone, and then is met with a surprise visit from Ashley Abbott (the mystery woman).  Rick remembers her from Paris and is stunned to see her.  At the same time, Brooke and Phoebe are arguing about Phoebe\u2019s relationship with Ridge.  Phoebe accuses Brooke of being selfish and only looking out for her wedding.  Phoebe is afraid that Rick will find someone else and vows to never forgive Ridge if someday she isn\u2019t with Rick.",
