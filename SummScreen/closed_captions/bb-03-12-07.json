    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/12/2007\n\nAshley tells Rick she\u2019s been flown in to consult on the new Forrester Originals fragrance. They two of them discuss the intimate moments they shared in Paris. Rick and Ashley decide to leave their past in Paris and to work together professionally. Nick does not want the Forresters to get the upper hand by using Ridge and Brooke\u2019s wedding as a publicity stunt. Jackie urges Nick to save Brooke from the Forresters. She\u2019s sure he\u2019s still in love with Brooke despite the fact that he\u2019s been seeing Taylor. Stephanie thinks that using the wedding as a publicity stunt is a bad idea that will blow up in their faces. Ashley suggests the name \u201cPhoebe\u201d for the new fragrance to the Forresters. Brooke asks Ridge to come to Sydney with her; however, he doesn\u2019t want to leave Rick and Phoebe alone in LA. Jackie overhears Brooke telling Ridge that his feud with Rick could end their marriage.",
