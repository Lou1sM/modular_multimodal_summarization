    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/13/2007\n\nRidge assures Stephanie that Rick and Phoebe\u2019s relationship is over and that nobody will stop his wedding to Brooke. Phoebe is angry that Brooke no longer supports her relationship with Rick and that Ridge still hasn\u2019t come around. Rick and Ashley have dinner together. Rick tells Ashley that his drama with the Forresters over Phoebe won\u2019t affect the business or their deal with her. Jackie tells Donna that Brooke is the ideal match for Nick. Jackie and Donna see Phoebe on the phone and wonder if she is talking to Rick. Donna doesn\u2019t think that Rick and Phoebe will continue their relationship behind Ridge\u2019s back. After Jackie leaves, Donna tells Phoebe to not let anyone tell her that she can\u2019t have a future with Rick. Later, Stephanie tells Jackie that both of them want the same thing; Brooke to be with Nick.",
