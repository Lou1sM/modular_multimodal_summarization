    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 3/19/2007\n\nRick and Phoebe are working on the guest list and seating arrangements for Brooke and Ridge\u2019s wedding.  Ridge wants to show Phoebe he trusts her so he leaves them alone.  Phoebe tells Rick she is sick of everyone trying to protect her innocence; she can do that herself.  She removes Rick\u2019s shirt and begins to give him a haircut while playfully kissing him.  Taylor comes to Ridge\u2019s office to offer to take Phoebe out to lunch.  They decide to check on Rick and Phoebe are shocked by what they walk in on.  Meanwhile, Donna feels guilty about encouraging Rick and Phoebe, but Jackie convinces Donna that it\u2019s all for the best.  Jackie and Donna agree that they must break up Brooke and Ridge before their wedding.  They are interrupted by Nick, who is upset with Jackie for sabotaging his night with Taylor.  Jackie is convinced that Taylor is just a substitute lover for Nick, and Jackie is determined to end Brooke and Ridge once and for all.",
