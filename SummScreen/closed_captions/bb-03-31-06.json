    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 03/31/2006\n\nNick tries to help Taylor dissolve her drinking by getting her drunk to the point of vomiting.  Even though Taylor vomits on Nick, she tells him she is grateful for his friendship.  Ridge apologizes to Brooke for deserting her but promises it won\u2019t happen again. Stephanie offers her own liver to Felicia.  Stephanie is a bit loopy on medication, before the surgery, when she confesses her true love for Eric.  In turn, Eric confesses his true love for her. Christian then informs them both that Stephanie does not have to go through with the operation as another liver was found a match for Felicia.",
