    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 4/04/2006\n\nBrooke, Nick and the kids enjoy life on the island, which includes finding the perfect campsite and setting up the tent. Stephanie visits Jackie and warns her to stay away from Eric. Jackie doesn\u2019t take Stephanie seriously. Christian is surprised at the barbeque when he sees Dominick.  He then puts together the pieces that it is actually Felicia\u2019s family he is socializing with.  Later, Christian visits Stephanie and urges her to tell the family after seeing how heartbroken they are over the loss of their sister.",
