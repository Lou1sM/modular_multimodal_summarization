    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 4/11/2006\n\nNick suspects Massimo had something to do with Jackie\u2019s arrest and tries to get to the bottom of it.  He tells Massimo that if he does not help Nick, Massimo will lose a son.  Ridge, Thorne, Darla and Kristen have been called by Stephanie and Eric to what they feel is a family meeting.  They all feel they are there to help Stephanie deal with Felicia\u2019s death; help her through this rough time.  Stephanie tells them they don\u2019t understand; that\u2019s not why she wanted to gather them all together.  Then, Christian wheels Felicia in to a shocked crowd.  Everyone rejoices at the sight of Felicia.",
