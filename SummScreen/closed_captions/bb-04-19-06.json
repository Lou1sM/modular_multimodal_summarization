    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 4/19/2006\n\nBrooke is furious with Ridge for surprising her with a visit from her father. Brooke makes it pretty clear to both of them that she wants nothing to do with either of the two men. Stephen pleads with Brooke to hate him, but please just let Ridge in her life. Massimo convinces Megan to continue with their scheme and he will thank her properly in time. Nick informs Jackie that he is working on getting her out of prison hopefully by the following day.",
