When Brooke arrives by Ridge\u2019s bedside, she\u2019s affected by seeing Ridge just laying there. Dante tries to talk to Felicia about their kiss but Dino\u2019s cries distract her. Eric tells Stephen how happy he is that Brooke came home to help Ridge. Stephen is still skeptical of Ridge\u2019s involvement with Brooke.",
