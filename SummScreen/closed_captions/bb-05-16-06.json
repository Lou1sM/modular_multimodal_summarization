Stephanie apologizes again to a comatose Ridge because she feels that it is her fault that he is laying there.  With the help of Brooke\u2019s voice, Ridge wakes up. Stephanie tries to make good to Brooke. Jackie is upset that Brooke rushed back to Los Angeles and cut her trip short with Nick.  Jackie tells Stephen that she hopes that this doesn\u2019t affect Nick\u2019s relationship with Brooke.",
