While at the press conference, Jackie calls Nick to inform him to watch it on the television.  The Forrester Creations press conference is underway and Brooke believes that it is just to announce Ridge\u2019s recovery. Stephanie plays a tribute to Brooke and shocks everyone by saying she will resign and wants Brooke to be the new CEO.",
