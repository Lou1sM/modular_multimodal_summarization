    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 5/26/2006\n\nNick and Stephen talk about how Taylor might sign over her percentage of the stock which would give Brooke controlling interest over the company.  They both feel that what is coming to the Forrester family is well deserved.  Stephanie distributes the remaining stock to her family. Taylor visits Stephanie and realizes she will never make things fair so therefore she decides to really think about Stephen\u2019s offer to cause a stir in the family.",
