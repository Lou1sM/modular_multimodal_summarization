Ridge hopes that Brooke will take the job offer but is afraid that she will still remain with Nick.  Brooke makes a decision to decline the job offer.  As she and Nick are about to tell the Forrester\u2019s her decision, Nick receives a phone call from Stephen saying that Taylor has signed over her stock to Brooke.  Brooke now has controlling interest of Forrester, therefore, Nick tells Brooke and everyone else that she will accept the CEO position.",
