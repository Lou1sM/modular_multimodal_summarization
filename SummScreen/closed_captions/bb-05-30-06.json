Christian then kisses Felicia, and Felicia tells him that she owes it to Dino to explore a relationship with Dante but that Christian is a potential candidate for her heart. Everyone is thrilled that Brooke is accepting the offer but no one is aware that Nick and Stephen have purchased Taylor\u2019s stock. Ridge rejoices at Brooke accepting the job.",
