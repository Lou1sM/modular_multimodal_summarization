    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 5/31/2006\n\nRidge shares with Bridget his true hopes; that this new CEO position will break up Nick and Brooke\u2019s relationship and therefore Ridge and Brooke reunite.  Taylor tells Stephen she doesn\u2019t know what to do with her life.  Stephen tells her that she is free from the Forresters and that she can do anything she wants.  He comforts her and then kisses her as well.  Brooke is completely caught off guard when Nick presents her with the extra two percent of the stock and tells her she now has controlling interest of the company.  Nick also tells a shocked Brooke that he wants her to fire the Forresters.",
