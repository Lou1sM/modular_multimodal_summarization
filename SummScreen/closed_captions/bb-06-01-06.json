Stephen still sends Taylor beautiful flowers later that day. Stephanie, Eric, Ridge and Thorne gather to welcome Brooke back to work as her first day as the new CEO. Brooke meanwhile is confused and upset that she might have to fire the Forresters. Under Nick\u2019s encouragement, Brooke finally arrives at work and stops the celebration to inform the group she has to fire them.",
