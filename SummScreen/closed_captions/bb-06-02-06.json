    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 6/02/2006\n\nStephanie, Ridge and Eric are shocked that Brooke is firing them. Stephanie pleas with Brooke to reconsider. Ridge tries to talk to Brooke on her own, when Nick bursts in and interrupts. Brooke then tells Nick that she has had a change of heart; Forrester Creations would be nothing without the Forresters so she can not fire them after all.  Dante is sculpting Felicia but tells Felicia he needs some air.  Christian then enters and Felicia flirts with him and begins to kiss him.  Dante returns and reacts to seeing Christian and Felicia together. Stephanie pays a visit to Taylor after learning how Brooke got the two percent of Forrester Creations to remain in control.",
