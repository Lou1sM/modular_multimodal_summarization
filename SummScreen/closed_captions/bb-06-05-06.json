    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 6/05/2006\n\nBrooke reveals to Ridge and Nick that she can\u2019t fire the Forresters. She decides that what is best for everyone is that her new office will be out of Marone Industries, therefore, she won\u2019t have to run into the Forresters everyday.  Later, Stephanie asks Brooke to stand with them, and not Stephen and Nick. Meanwhile, Christian leaves the room after Dante gets jealous. Dante asks Felicia to give them a try. Felicia agrees. Nick turns to Bridget for advice on Brooke. Bridget wishes him luck and tells Nick he\u2019ll figure it out.",
