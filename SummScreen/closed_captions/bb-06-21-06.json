    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 6/21/2006\n\nStephen pleads with Brooke to stay away from Ridge for good. Brooke resents her father for voicing his opinion and tells him to get out of her life; little does she realize that Stephen is about to tell her is leaving town. Felicia and Dante prepare for a wedding that neither one of them is completely sure of; Dante confesses his love for Bridget to his father and Felicia finds the courage to ask Bridget if she still has feelings for Dante. Bridget promises to leave Dante alone and tells Dante her decision, only to realize how much she truly loves him. Felicia catches Dante and Bridget kissing and realizes her suspicions are correct but chooses not to confront them.",
