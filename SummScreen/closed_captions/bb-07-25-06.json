Nick finds Donna in Brooke\u2019s closet in lingerie; she claims she came to borrow a shirt. At the funeral, Stephanie has a strange feeling about Taylor. Thorne comes over to talk with Taylor, but her guilt is taken over by her sympathy for him. People take turns speaking at the service; Taylor gives a speech as well.
