    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 7/31/2006\n\nEric tells Brooke that Ridge is not going to design for the Brooke\u2019s Bedroom line anymore.  Stephanie proposes that they drop the Bedroom line if Ridge isn\u2019t going to design for that line anymore and even asks Brooke to give up her stock shares but Brooke declines and leaves to find Ridge.  Donna is excited and nervous when Ridge talks to her at the showroom. Brooke interrupts to try to talk Ridge back into designing the Bedroom line.  At the showroom press conference, Brooke announces that she will be stepping down as the spokesmodel for Brooke\u2019s Bedroom but will remain CEO.  Brooke and Ridge announce Donna as the new spokesmodel.  Reporters question Donna and Ridge.  Dante is still upset that Bridget doesn\u2019t want a baby yet.  Dante and Bridget argue about starting a family.",
