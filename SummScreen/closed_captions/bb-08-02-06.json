Brooke begins to feel envious of Donna being in the spotlight. Though Stephanie is not happy with Donna replacing Brooke, she is impressed by Donna\u2019s photos.  Brooke arrives for Donna\u2019s photo shoot and feels that Ridge\u2019s vision for Donna\u2019s photos is too provocative.  Everyone at the photo shoot is surprised by Brooke\u2019s reaction. Later, Ridge tries to comfort Donna and Donna kisses Ridge.  Brooke walks in on the kiss and is furious. Taylor feels guilty about killing Darla and not telling Thorne.  Thorne approaches Taylor and senses that she is keeping a secret. Thorne supports Taylor and takes her to an AA meeting.",
