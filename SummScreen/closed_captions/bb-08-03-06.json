    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/03/2006\n\nRidge tells Eric that he is feeling happy again because he is convinced that Donna is the perfect replacement for Brooke.  Brooke confronts Donna about the kiss with Ridge and Donna accuses her of being jealous. Donna offers the spokesmodel position back to Brooke and tries to convince her that she belongs with Ridge. Brooke is confused about her feeling for Nick and Ridge. Later, Brooke tells Ridge he needs to maintain a professional relationship with Donna. Brooke apologizes to Ridge for ever hurting him and he confesses that he will always love her. Donna secretly watches the whole confession. Taylor has a breakdown in the AA meeting. After the meeting, Taylor makes a dress for Alexandria out of one of Darla\u2019s old dresses. Thorne is touched by the way Taylor has helped Alexandria.",
