    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/08/2006\n\nRidge and Donna kiss. Brooke accidentally sees the kiss, and is quite upset.  Brooke then tells Nick that she has fired Donna; however, Ridge still believes that they will continue to work together.  Nick can tell that Brooke is jealous of Donna, but Brooke explains that she is just worried that Ridge will break her sister\u2019s heart.  Donna hopes that Ridge has feelings for her.  Brooke apologizes to Donna, and warns her to keep things professional between her and Ridge.  Hector still does not want Taylor to tell the truth as he continues to cover for her.  He is later presented with a medal of distinction at the Firehouse.",
