    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/09/2006\n\nDonna, fresh off her debut on the runway, daydreams about being with Ridge. Donna and Ridge are starting to realize that there is a growing sense of sexual tension between the two of them. Taylor continues to spend more time comforting Thorne over Darla\u2019s death in hopes of healing her own guilty conscience. Hector expresses to Phoebe that he is concerned that if Taylor spends too much time with Thorne, she will begin to feel guilty enough to admit the truth. After Hector thoroughly pressures Phoebe into telling him Taylor\u2019s whereabouts, Hector finds Taylor and Thorne in an embrace. Once Taylor is alone, Hector prepares to confront Taylor about her recent behavior.",
