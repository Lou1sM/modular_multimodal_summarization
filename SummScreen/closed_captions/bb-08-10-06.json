    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/10/2006\n\nHector brings Taylor over to his house to beg her to not tell Thorne to truth. Taylor is an emotional wreck and feels that if she doesn\u2019t tell him the truth, she will continue feeling like a murderer for the rest of her life. Phoebe goes to Darla\u2019s grave to apologize for her part in the accident; Thorne sees Phoebe at the gravesite but doesn\u2019t suspect her guilt. As Hector continues to plead with a distraught Taylor, Thorne enters the room and wants to know what is going on. Dante confesses to Eric that he is still in love with Felicia and that he owes a lot to her for all the pain he has caused her. Dante goes to visit Felicia just as she finishes putting Dino down for a nap. Dante and Felicia flirt and reminisce but when Felicia goes to find Dino, she realizes that Dino is missing; someone has taken him.",
