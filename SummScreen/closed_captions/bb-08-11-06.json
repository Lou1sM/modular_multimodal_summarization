    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/11/2006\n\nHector tries to calm Thorne through continuing to explaining to him that what happened to Darla was an accident. Thorne doesn\u2019t appreciate Hector\u2019s concern and defensively demands for Hector to stay away from him, Phoebe, and Taylor. Felicia and Dante distraughtly try and figure out what has happened to him. Felicia realizes that her PDA was in the diaper bag that was taken and that she can use the GPS system on the PDA to track down Dino\u2019s whereabouts. Dante tracks the signal to the airport and then they rush to the airport.",
