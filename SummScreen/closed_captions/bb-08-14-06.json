    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/14/2006\n\nTaylor dreams of what it would be like if she told Thorne the truth. Taylor then wakes up in a cold sweat and tells Phoebe her horrible nightmare. Bridget visits Nick and he tries to comfort her about her guilt over her breakup with Dante.  Donna and Ridge look over some of the press for Brooke\u2019s Bedroom and flirt over Donna\u2019s infamy. In an effort to get Ridge to realize that he should be with her, Donna expresses her concern to Ridge that he should get over Brooke because she doesn\u2019t deserve him. Nick catches Donna and Ridge flirting and demands to speak with Ridge.  Nick is concerned that Ridge is using his relationship with Donna to get between Nick and Brooke. Donna overhears Ridge and Nick\u2019s conversation and worries that she is being used by Ridge to make Brooke jealous.",
