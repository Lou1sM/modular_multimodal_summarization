    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/16/2006\n\nRidge pleads with Brooke to leave Nick. Brooke admits that seeing Ridge with another woman, let alone her sister, does make her jealous, but leaves to see Nick as she has a meeting with the Marone Board.  Everyone at the Marone office is skeptical of Brooke coming into their infrastructure. Brooke arrives at the board meeting and suggests ideas that surprise and confuse everyone. Taylor and Phoebe prepare themselves to go tell Thorne the truth about Darla\u2019s death; Hector catches the girls before they leave and asks them to come with him before they go to see Thorne. Hector takes the girls to see an inmate in prison who tells them all about her time in jail. The more Taylor and Phoebe hear the less anxious they become about wanting to admit the truth.",
