Later, Nick complements Brooke on how great she was in the meeting but she\u2019s not sure if working with Nick at Marone is the best idea. Brooke feels that the fashion industry is more her expertise. While the inmate talks to Taylor and Phoebe they grow deeper in fear of telling the truth.  Hector tells Taylor all the reasons why see can\u2019t tell the truth yet Taylor feels she needs to come forward.  Lt. Baker sees Taylor and Hector leaving the prison. He finds out from a guard why they were there and begins to put the pieces together.",
