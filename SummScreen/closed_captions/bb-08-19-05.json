    "description": "Season: 18\nOriginal Air Date: 8/19/2005\n\nStephanie berates Brooke, while Brooke counters and states she never meant to hurt anyone. Stephanie encourages Brooke to open the gift box.  Brooke is suspicious that the solution to all their problems could be found in a little box. Upon opening the box, Brooke is shocked and horrified to find an antique gun. Nick holds Bridget in his arms and asks her to go sail away before the baby is born.  Bridget tells Nick that she doesn\u2019t want to go away, to just come back to the same problems. Nick assures her things are different, and the baby is proof. Bridget feels Nick is just trying to do the right thing because a child is involved. Nick grabs Bridget and insists they work things out because of the baby. Bridget then announces she never said there was a baby. Bridget storms out of the Beach House and runs crying down towards the ocean.",
