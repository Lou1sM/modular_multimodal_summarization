    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/21/2006\n\nBrooke is still reluctant about working with Nick.  Brooke pleads with Nick to try to make him understand that she has already given up a lot at Forrester so she could make their relationship work.  Felicia tells Dante that Bridget still wants to be with Nick. Felicia decides to meddle a little and leaves to head over to Brooke\u2019s.  Bridget arrives and talks to Dante.  Dante reassures Bridget that Felicia won\u2019t tell anyone about what they talked about earlier. Felicia arrives at Brooke\u2019s and talks to Nick about love and marriage. Lt. Baker explains his theory to Taylor and makes Taylor nervous because he is correct in his theory.  Later, Taylor and Phoebe vent about feeling terribly guilty for lying to Thorne. Taylor then decides to tell the whole truth about Darla\u2019s death.",
