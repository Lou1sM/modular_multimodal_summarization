    "description": "Season: 18\nOriginal Air Date: 8/26/2005\n\nRidge and Taylor continue to argue about him not being able to commit to their marriage because he\u2019s still mourning the loss of Brooke.  A furious Taylor suggests marriage counseling but when Ridge refuses, they both decide that Ridge should move out for the night.  Brooke tells Nick that he should have been the man in her life \u2013 not Ridge. Nick reiterates that Brooke is his one true love and he will never let her ago.  Bridget is nervous about seeing Nick, but Dante assures her that Nick will want the child. Bridget is worried though that Nick won\u2019t want her.  Bridget then calls Nick to ask to meet with him.  After Bridget calls Nick, he forces Brooke to leave because he intends to tell Bridget the entire truth so he and Brooke won\u2019t spend anymore time apart. When Bridget arrives at Nick\u2019s boat, Bridget reveals the truth, that she is still pregnant, to a stunned Nick.",
