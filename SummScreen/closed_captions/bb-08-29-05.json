    "description": "Season: 18\nOriginal Air Date: 8/29/2005\n\nTaylor tells Steffy, Phoebe and Thomas that Ridge has moved out, but assures them that it is not their fault. Taylor encourages Thomas to focus on his fashion show and not to worry about other things. Later, Taylor quickly tells Gaby not to get caught up in a fantasy life with Thomas because they will never be together; this is a marriage in name only.  Brooke recounts the news of Bridget\u2019s abortion to Eric. Brooke then states that she and Nick are still in love. Eric blames Brooke for Bridget\u2019s abortion.  Bridget tells Nick that she lied about having an abortion. Nick is in total disbelief that Bridget could do something so cruel, but Bridget begs Nick for forgiveness. Although he is relieved that the baby was not aborted, Nick demands that Bridget tell Brooke the truth. Brooke and Nick listen in shock as Bridget states that she did not have the abortion and she wants to have a family with Nick.",
