    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/29/2006\n\nTaylor finds out that Hector is blind due to the explosion from the fire. Hector blames himself for his misfortune, but Taylor reassures and comforts him.  At Thorne\u2019s house, Stephanie and Thorne dismiss the possibility of Taylor being a suspect and she tells him to drop the investigation into Darla\u2019s death. Stephanie tells him that Taylor will be there to help him. At Insomnia, Nick mentions that he can introduce Phoebe to Harry and have her give him a tour of the city. After Nick leaves, Phoebe enters and watches Harry steal money from the tip jar to pay for his coffee. Harry and Phoebe argue but flirt as well.  During their conversation, Phoebe receives a phone call from Nick asking if she would give a tour around the city to a friend of his who just arrived in town.  Phoebe agrees, not knowing that the friend is Harry. She decides to put money in the tip jar before she leaves and smiles flirtatiously with Harry.",
