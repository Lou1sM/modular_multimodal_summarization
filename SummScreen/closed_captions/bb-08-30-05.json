Jackie is stunned when Eric reveals the news of Bridget\u2019s abortion.  Jackie and Eric share in the pain of losing a grandchild. Bridget asks Brooke for forgiveness so they can all move on with their lives. However, Brooke is appalled that her daughter could do something so spiteful. Later, when Bridget goes to lie down, Nick states to Brooke that he can\u2019t be a husband to Bridget because he still loves Brooke. Brooke is adamant that Nick should be with Bridget.",
