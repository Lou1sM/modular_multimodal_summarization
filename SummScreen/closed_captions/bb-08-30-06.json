    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 8/30/2006\n\nBrooke is jealous of Ridge\u2019s flirting with Donna, and later watches her sister on the \u201cRich Ginger\u201d talk show. Phoebe and Taylor play cards together and Taylor tells her about Hector\u2019s blindness.  In the midst of their conversation, Thorne walks in and announces he is dropping the investigation.  Later when Taylor and Thorne are alone and he is about to leave he thanks Taylor for her support and then kisses her. Stephanie visits Hector at the hospital and offers to pay for rehab at an institute far away, but realizes she is just trying to get rid of him. Hector accuses Stephanie of pushing Taylor and Thorne together. Felicia tells Rich Ginger (guest star Alan Thicke) that there cannot be any personal questions asked of Donna during the interview. Ridge encourages Donna as she is about to walk on stage, Felicia is suspicious as she feels that Ridge is up to something.",
