Stephanie arrives and is displeased to discover that Hector is there and is staying with Taylor. Brooke is devastated by Ridge and Donna\u2019s actions. Nick tries to convince Brooke to come to bed instead of going to confront Ridge but she leaves anyway. Ridge, meanwhile, confesses to Donna that he really does feel something for her and they kiss. Brooke rushes in and breaks it up, professing her anger and hurt at what they\u2019ve done. Brooke asks to speak to Ridge alone. Ridge tells her that he still loves her and wants her back.  Despite Brooke telling Ridge how much she loves Nick, they end up kissing. Donna, who is on her cell phone with Nick sees the kiss and tells him. Nick is devastated. Bridget, who was in the area and decided to stop by, tries to comfort Nick.",
