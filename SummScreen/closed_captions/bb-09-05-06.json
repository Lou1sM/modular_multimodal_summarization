    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 9/05/2006\n\nRidge continues to beg Brooke to go back to him and he tries to kiss her, but Brooke pulls away. Brooke then tells Ridge that she doesn\u2019t trust him, but she will always love him. Brooke tells Ridge again not to hurt Donna. After Brooke leaves, Donna walks in and tells Ridge that he is a liar, but Ridge explains to Donna that Brooke chose Nick. At Taylor\u2019s house, Stephanie tells Hector that he is not right for Taylor but that Taylor and Thorne will be happy. Thorne tells Taylor that it isn\u2019t a good idea that Hector has moved in with her because he has a crush on her. On Nick\u2019s boat, a devastated Nick tells Bridget that Donna saw Brooke and Ridge kissing. Bridget comforts Nick as he drinks to escape the hurt he feels.  Nick removes his wedding ring and they kiss as the passion reunites between them.",
