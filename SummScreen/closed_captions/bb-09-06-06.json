    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 9/06/2006\n\nThe next day, Harry arrives to the boat and secretly sees Bridget and Nick in bed together.  Harry leaves without being noticed.  Nick tells Bridget that he is going to end things with Brooke and thus, Bridget is optimistic for a future with Nick.  Harry arrives after Nick has left and introduces himself to Bridget. Brooke is worried about how Nick did not come home and knows he is upset.  Donna tries to comfort Brooke and almost tells her that she is the one who told Nick that she saw Ridge and Brooke kissing.  Nick interrupts and Donna leaves him and Brooke alone.  Nick packs his bags as Brooke desperately pleads with him for another chance.",
