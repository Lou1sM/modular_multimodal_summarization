    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 9/07/2006\n\nNick unsuccessfully tries to tell Brooke what happened the night before between him and Bridget. Brooke interrupts him from his explanation, and then slips Nick\u2019s ring back onto his finger. The two embrace and promise each other never to let one another down again. Nick then goes over to see an excited Bridget and informs her that he and Brooke have agreed to start over. A devastated Bridget tries and get Nick to come back to her. Christian pays a visit to a recuperating Hector. Hector informs his brother that he has feelings for Taylor, but now he is concerned that Thorne has developed feelings for Taylor as well. Taylor admits to Thorne that she has no feelings for Hector, while Thorne admits he feels that Darla is telling him it\u2019s okay to pursue a relationship with Taylor.",
