    "description": "Season: 18\nOriginal Air Date: 9/07/2005\n\nNick informs Eric about his feelings for Brooke, but he admits that he doesn\u2019t want to hurt Bridget or the baby. However, Eric can\u2019t help but wonder if Brooke has something planned. Thomas is livid with Taylor for calling Agent Dunn. When Agent Dunn arrives Thomas states that he and Gaby are in love. Taylor reveals to Agent Dunn that the marriage is phony, prompting the officers to handcuff Gaby. Gaby\u2019s lawyer comes to her rescue and she is set free as Taylor stews with anger. Though Brooke might be trying to convince herself, she tells Dante that she and Nick are over. Brooke pours some wine for Dante, which leads to a kiss between the two.",
