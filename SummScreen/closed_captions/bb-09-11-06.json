The tension builds between the two as Hector explains to Thorne that his focus should be on his daughter, and not on Taylor.  Thorne leaves and Hector tells Taylor not to get involved with Thorne because he will send her to jail if he learns about Darla\u2019s death.  Bridget wants Nick to leave Brooke and come back to her, but Nick wants his marriage to work. Bridget does not want to ruin her relationship with her mother and begs Nick not to tell Brooke that they slept together. Nick agrees to keep it secret for now.",
