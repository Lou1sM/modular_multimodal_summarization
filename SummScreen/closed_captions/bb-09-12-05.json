    "description": "Season: 18\nOriginal Air Date: 9/08/2005\n\nEric knows that Brooke can convince Bridget that she and Nick are over, but Eric doesn\u2019t believe that Nick will be able to do the same. Dante tells Bridget that Brooke is the new woman in his life and their feelings for each other are real. Bridget confronts Brooke about her relationship with Dante; she is surprised to hear what Brooke has to say. Bridget begins to believe that everything regarding Nick and her will be all right. Ridge is shocked to learn that Thomas and Gaby have slept together and that Thomas has moved out. Ridge blames Taylor for this turn of events, but Taylor spits that she deserves better than Ridge. This leaves Ridge on the brink of admitting that he wishes he\u2019d stayed with Brooke.",
