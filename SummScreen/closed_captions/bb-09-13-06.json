    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 9/13/2006\n\nBridget tells Brooke that she still thinks about her and Nick\u2019s deceased baby, Nicole. Bridget also admits that she is still in love with Nick and that she had hopes that Brooke and Nick\u2019s marriage would fail so that she could be with Nick. Brooke thinks they can find a solution to this problem and insists that there is nothing that Bridget can ever do to make her hate her. Nick wants Bridget to tell Brooke that they slept together. Harry is angry at Nick because he saw Bridget and Nick in bed together.  Harry starts to pack his things to leave Nick\u2019s boat when Nick enters and tries to explain himself. Nick tells Harry that Brooke does not know that he was unfaithful. Nick would tell Brooke if he slept with any other woman, but he does not want to ruin Brooke and Bridget\u2019s relationship.  Nick asks Harry not to leave.",
