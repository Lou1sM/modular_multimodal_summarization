    "description": "Season: 18\nOriginal Air Date: 9/15/2005\n\nJackie tells Eric that Nick and Brooke are meant for each other. After studying the ultrasound of the baby, Nick agrees to give up any hope of a future with Brooke. Bridget invites Nick, Dante and Brooke back to the house for some more celebration around the pool. There, Dante and Brooke continue their charade. However, Nick can\u2019t watch it, prompting Bridget to wonder if it\u2019s hard for Nick to see Brooke with another man. Sally relays her support for Thomas and Gaby as she offers Thomas a large signing bonus to stay with Spectra. Thomas is very tempted to accept the offer.",
