    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 9/19/2005\n\nTaylor blames herself for all of the problems caused of late, but Hector comforts her. Taylor gently informs Hector that she is not interested in him romantically. Gaby and Thorne are not sure if Thomas should accept Sally\u2019s offer to continue to work for Spectra Couture. Ridge has an idea; he and Thomas will settle their differences on the runway. Ridge announces that there will be a Spectra Couture vs. Forrester Creations fashion show and if Thomas wins, the family will accept Gaby. However, if Ridge wins, Thomas will annul his marriage and come home. Thomas agrees.",
