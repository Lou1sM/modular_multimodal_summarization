    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 9/20/2017\n\nSally and the Spectra group tour their offices to check out the recent renovations following the destructive fire.  As CEO of Spencer Publications, Liam begins to make changes within the company starting with the removal of \u201cSkye\u201d.  Knowing that Justin still has his job, Bill discusses with his right-hand man whether he or Liam has his loyalty.  Wanting to reunite the family, Steffy pays a visit to Brooke in an attempt to get her to forgive Bill and all of his misdeeds.  As Sally is thanks Liam for his generosity, Steffy is curious as to why there is an exchange of gratitude.",
