    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 9/26/2017\n\nSteffy and Ridge compare notes on the facts that they each know surrounding the separation of Brooke and Bill.  Brooke is very careful with her words when she explains to her family why she decided to end her marriage to Bill.  Furious from losing Brooke, Bill pays an angered visit to Liam to assure him that Spencer Publications will soon be back under the original leadership.  Ridge is confident that, in time, he and Brooke will reunite.  Bill challenges Liam to call the police on him, but Steffy defuses the situation.  Brooke tells Katie about Bill being responsible for the Spectra fire. Bill expresses his regrets to Steffy.",
