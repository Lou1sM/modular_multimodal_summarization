    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 9/27/2006\n\nShane tries to calm down Phoebe as he tells her what he saw the night of the accident. Shane tells a distracted and nervous Phoebe that he tracked her down because she is the only person who knows what he is feeling. Meanwhile, Hector tells Harry that Phoebe is in trouble and they leave together to find her. Just as Phoebe is won over by Shane\u2019s show of emotion, Harry appears and drags Shane from the car.  Phoebe and Hector ask Harry to leave. Stephanie discusses with a concerned Eric how proud she is of Taylor and the special evening she is sharing with Thorne. Taylor and Thorne share a dance during their special evening and Thorne tells Taylor that he wants to tell people about their relationship. Taylor is hesitant about how people will react.",
