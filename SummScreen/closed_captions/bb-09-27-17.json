    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 9/27/2017\n\nAs Wyatt attempts to put together the clues that point towards Bill being associated with the Spectra fire, Katie subtly hints that his suspicion is correct.  As Sally shows him around the newly renovated Spectra Fashions offices, Liam surprises her with something that will assist her with the rebuild: a meeting with renowned architects.  Wanting to resolve the issues within the Spencer family, Steffy promises Bill that she will have a heart-to-heart discussion with Liam about a solution.  When Wyatt confronts his father about the fire, Bill confesses and admits to being blackmailed by Liam.  While Steffy approaches Liam about deleting the recording of Bill\u2019s confession, Bill plots his next move.",
