Nick sees Bridget\u2019s pregnancy as a blessing, despite the fact that it could ruin his marriage. Bridget tells Nick why she loved him and they find out the results of her HCG test. Brooke tells Eric that Ridge is no longer a factor in her life because she is committed to Nick. Eric and Felicia both feel Brooke is only with Nick because it is safe but that her heart belongs to Ridge.",
