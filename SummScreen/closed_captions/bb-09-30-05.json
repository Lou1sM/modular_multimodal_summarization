After they make love, Bridget grows excited over the prospect of buying a house together, so she leaves to get brochures that she left at Forrester Creations. Taylor is extremely excited that Ridge has agreed to counseling, but she is still weary of Brooke. To Taylor\u2019s excitement, Ridge wants to move back in. They share a tender kiss. Stephanie refuses to allow Brooke to hurt Bridget again. Stephanie then realizes that Brooke is still in love with Nick. Stephanie spits that Brooke should have gone to Bridget to tell her the truth about Brooke and Nick\u2019s mutual feelings for each other. Desperate, Brooke tries to convince Stephanie to keep quiet. As they continue to argue about Nick, Bridget walks in. Stephanie blabs that Brooke is still in love with Nick. Bridget is stunned.",
