    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 10/02/2006\n\nBridget is overjoyed about becoming a mother. Nick hopes an arrangement can be made so that he can be part of the baby\u2019s life. He plans to talk to Brooke about accepting Bridget\u2019s pregnancy, but Bridget thinks Nick\u2019s expectations are too high. Hector then tells Stephanie that Shane was the man on the side of the road the night of Darla\u2019s accident. Taylor wants to trust Shane and explains that Phoebe feels the need to take care of him. Stephanie thinks Shane will blackmail them so Stephanie offers Shane a deal in order to neutralize the situation. Shane promises Phoebe that he will not tell anyone about the accident. Shane fantasizes about being with Phoebe forever. Jackie tells Brooke that she wants a grandchild and that Nick will not get over the idea of having his own child. Brooke thinks raising Hope and R.J. will be enough for Nick.",
