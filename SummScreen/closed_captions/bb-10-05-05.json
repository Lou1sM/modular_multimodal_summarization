    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 10/05/2005\n\nStephanie is shocked to learn that Bridget has decided to stay with Nick. Stephanie knows Bridget will only be hurt, but Bridget wonders if Stephanie is looking out for her best interest or she is out for revenge with Brooke. Nick tells Dante that he\u2019s never going to let Bridget down again. Later, Nick informs Brooke that Massimo knows about their feelings for each other, but he has agreed to keep quiet. Eric reveals what happened between Brooke and Nick to Stephanie, hoping that she would see the sacrifice Brooke and Nick have made. However, Stephanie can\u2019t promise not to say anything to Bridget.",
