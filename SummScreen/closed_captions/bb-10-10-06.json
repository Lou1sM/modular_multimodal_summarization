    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 10/10/2006\n\nNick asks Brooke to forgive him for sleeping with Bridget, whereas Ridge tries to convince Brooke otherwise and kisses her. Later, Bridget apologizes to her mother, but they fight about the night Bridget slept with Nick. Bridget defends Nick and pleads with Brooke to take him back. While Nick and Ridge wait outside, they start to physically fight until Stephanie breaks it up. Bridget admits that Dante is the father of her baby, and Brooke forgives her. Thorne calls Taylor and invites her to Big Bear, which she accepts. Thorne opens a package in his office that contains a jewelry box. Taylor tells Phoebe that she is going to tell Thorne that she killed Darla. Phoebe is scared that her mother will go to jail and just hopes that her and Thorne can work things out after he finds out the truth.",
