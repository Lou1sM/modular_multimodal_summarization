Stephanie continues to pressure Brooke into signing the divorce papers and Brooke continues to resist. Jackie enters after eavesdropping and tries to convince Brooke to stay with Nick. Brooke asks both women to leave. Stephanie and Jackie argue over who should be with Brooke. Phoebe\u2019s call to Stephanie interrupts their argument and Stephanie leaves to be with Phoebe. Phoebe calls Taylor and tells her that she wants to be there when she tells Thorne about Darla\u2019s accident but Taylor says she needs to do it by herself. Thorne wants a future with Taylor and offers her a ring. Taylor will not accept the ring until Thorne knows what really happened to Darla. Taylor begins to tell him the truth.",
