    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 10/16/2006\n\nTaylor arrives at the police station and is photographed and fingerprinted. She remains determined to see this through her way and insists she doesn\u2019t need a lawyer. Lt. Baker records Taylor\u2019s statement. She leaves out the details of Shane\u2019s involvement and admits that it was an accident, but she is not certain because she had been drinking. Taylor reviews her transcript and signs it to be admitted as evidence. Phoebe tells Ridge that Taylor told Thorne the truth about the accident. Ridge comforts Phoebe and believes that this is a new beginning to their relationship. Phoebe tells Ridge that she saw the accident and explains how she and Hector covered it up. Ridge is shocked to learn that Stephanie also knew about the accident. Thorne confides his feelings to Stephanie about Taylor\u2019s actions. He is angry to learn that Stephanie knew about the accident and convinced Taylor to keep her secret from him.  Stephanie tells Thorne that he should blame Darla for her death. Thorne can no longer contain his emotions. All he wants is Darla back. He embraces Stephanie and weeps in her arms.",
