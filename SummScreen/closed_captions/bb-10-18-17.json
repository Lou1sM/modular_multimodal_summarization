    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 11/18/2017\n\nSteffy approached Bill with the sole intention of making peace between him and his estranged son, Liam.  Bill gives into Steffy\u2019s prodding by admitting that he is partially responsible for his argument with Liam.  Ridge makes an appearance at Spencer Publications in hopes of finding out from the source how and why Liam ousted Bill from the company.  Liam turns the tables on Ridge by asking about a possible reunion between him and Brooke now that she left Bill.  Even though the topic is an uncomfortable one for the sisters, Brooke tells Katie more about her and Bill\u2019s relationship.   When Bill tells Steffy that he wants to reconcile with his son, she agrees to make it happen.",
