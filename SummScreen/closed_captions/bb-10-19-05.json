    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 10/19/2005\n\nRidge insists that Brooke\u2019s marriage to Eric is a mistake as he tries to console her. Hector fantasizes about making love to Taylor and he deduces that it\u2019s time to make his move. Hector finally tells Taylor that he wants to be with her. Taylor ponders Hector\u2019s admission because she is unsure whom Ridge would rather be with. Eric finally tells Stephanie that he and Brooke eloped in Las Vegas. Stephanie concludes that Brooke is using Eric and she will break his heart. Stephanie reminds Eric that he will not be able to control Brooke\u2019s feelings for Nick, when Brooke walks in. Stephanie tells Brooke off, but Eric and Brooke share a passionate kiss in front of Stephanie.",
