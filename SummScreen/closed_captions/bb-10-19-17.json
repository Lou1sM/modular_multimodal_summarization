    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 10/19/2017\n\nUnaware of the ongoing communication that Justin has been passing along, Liam questions him about where his loyalty lies and threatens his job at Spencer Publications.  Having already dealt with the wrath of Quinn regarding their relationship, Wyatt and Katie ponder what kind of reaction they will receive when Bill finds out about them.  Steffy offers to speak with Liam on Bill\u2019s behalf, but insists that her father-in-law drop his determined revenge.  As Steffy speaks with Liam, Bill and Justin hire an expert to assist them in retrieving the taped confession.",
