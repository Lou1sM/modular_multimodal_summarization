    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 10/20/2005\n\nTaylor and Ridge worry how Eric and Brooke\u2019s union will affect Stephanie. Taylor asserts that if Ridge constantly runs to Brooke, their marriage will fail. Ridge swears that everything is over with Brooke. Ridge and Taylor begin to make love. Stephanie knows that Eric is trying to make her jealous, when Eric throws her out of the house. Nick goes to visit Stephanie and spits that Stephanie\u2019s punishment for meddling is having Brooke in Eric\u2019s arms. Stephanie counters that the thought of Brooke and Eric kills Nick as well. Eric tries to make love to Brooke, but her thoughts are elsewhere and she can\u2019t go through with it. Later, Nick finds Brooke, but she says he must win Bridget back.",
