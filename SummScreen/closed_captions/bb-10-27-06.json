    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 10/27/2006\n\nAs Phoebe visits her mother in jail, Thorne overhears Phoebe and Taylor talking about how they wish that he could accept that Darla\u2019s death was an accident. Thorne is there to learn more about what really happened.  Thorne tells Taylor that he accepts that Darla\u2019s death was an accident. Thomas, Felicia, Shane, Dante, Eric, Harry, and Hector set up for Phoebe\u2019s birthday party. The party is interrupted when Eric gets a call that Jackie is in the hospital. Phoebe wants to do something to thank Shane for testifying on her mom\u2019s behalf.  Shane declares there is something but his intentions are unclear. Nick and Ridge wait for Brooke to tell them who she has chosen to be with. They are interrupted by a call from Stephanie telling them that Jackie had had an accident. Nick and Brooke arrive at the hospital and Bridget tells them that Jackie has suffered an acute subdural hematoma. Brooke asks Stephanie if she was involved in the accident. Stephanie makes excuses and Nick refuses to believe her.",
