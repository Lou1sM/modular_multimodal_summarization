    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 10/27/2017\n\nBill surprises Liam and Wyatt with legal papers making the three of them co-CEOs of Spencer Publications.  As Steffy fills Ridge in on the Spencer family reconciliation, she intentionally leaves out the cause of the rift.  Without breaking her promise to Liam about keeping quiet about his gift, Sally nonverbally confirms Shirley\u2019s suspicions about how they obtained ownership of the Spectra building.  Having placated Liam\u2019s concern about his changes made while CEO remaining, Bill turns to Wyatt to be an ally in their future decisions regarding the company.",
