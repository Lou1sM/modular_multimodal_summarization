Liam is forced to tell Sally in person that their plan to rebuild and relaunch Spectra Fashions will not happen.  When learning from Steffy that Liam told Sally about him being responsible for the fire, Bill becomes concerned about what lengths his son will take to help save Spectra.  Liam makes a promise to Sally and her employees that he will save the company and offers a solution for them all to fight Bill: a sit-in.  When Liam tells Steffy of his plan, she refuses to allow him to participate.",
