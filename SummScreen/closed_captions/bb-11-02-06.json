    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 11/02/2006\n\nDonna accuses Brooke of protecting Stephanie by not telling Nick about Stephanie pushing Jackie.  Later, Donna enters the Forrester office while Stephanie is talking badly about her to Ridge, saying that Donna is undermining Ridge\u2019s efforts to be with Brooke.  Stephanie tells Donna that she no longer represents the company and her things have been packed.  Donna is so furious that she decides to leave Nick a voicemail telling him that Jackie\u2019s fall was not an accident.  Brooke tells Nick their marriage is over and that he and Ridge should move on with their lives, but Nick insists that she will soon realize that he is the only man for her.  Nick packs his things and leave\u2019s Brooke\u2019s house.  As he walks out the door, Nick wipes away her tears as Brooke places her wedding ring in his hand.  Ridge tells Stephanie that Brooke is in love with him and that her marriage with Nick is over.  Ridge goes to Brooke\u2019s house and tries to kiss her, but she tells him that she cannot be with him at this time.",
