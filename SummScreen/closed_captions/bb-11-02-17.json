    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 11/02/2017\n\nBill meets with the head of demolition crew and makes a plan to turn the Spectra building into rubble by the end of the day.  Steffy strongly voices her objection of Liam going against Bill\u2019s plan by joining Sally and her crew in their peaceful protest.  Wyatt learns from Steffy about Liam\u2019s idea and becomes worried that things between his father and brother will not end well.  Liam makes one last passionate plea to Bill to change his mind about tearing down the historic building.  As the demolition crew arrives on the job, the Spectra group refuses to vacate the premises.",
