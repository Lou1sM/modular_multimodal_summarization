    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 11/03/2006\n\nRidge tells Stephanie that though Brooke needs her time alone, he will not give up pursuing her.  He also tells Eric and Stephanie that he is relieved to have Brooke working back at Forrester instead of at Marone Industries.  Donna tells Nick at the hospital that she saw Stephanie push Jackie over the railing. Nick asks if it is true and Jackie nods her head.  Nick leaves the hospital on his way to Stephanie\u2019s.  Brooke tries to call Nick on his way but he does not hear his phone.  She then calls Stephanie to warn her of Nick\u2019s rage.  At Stephanie\u2019s Nick breaks through a window when she does not let him in.  Nick corners Stephanie and tries to get her to admit that she pushed Jackie.  Back at the hospital, Eric tells Jackie that he is sorry if his wife did push her and gives her a kiss.  Jackie opens her eyes and gives Eric a weak smile.",
