    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 11/07/2017\n\nThe Spectra group watches from a distance as they hope and pray that Liam and Sally are alive, well, and will be rescued soon.  Wyatt and Katie learn about Liam and Sally being trapped and take control of the situation.  Just when Liam and Sally are about to give up hope of being rescued, they hear the voices of Bill and Steffy calling their names.  Shirley makes a vow to seek revenge against Bill if Sally doesn\u2019t come out of the building alive.  Conditions become extremely dangerous during Bill and Steffy\u2019s rescue attempt.  Liam and Sally are rescued.  As Liam hugs Steffy with gratitude, his face shows guilt for the kiss he shared with Sally.",
