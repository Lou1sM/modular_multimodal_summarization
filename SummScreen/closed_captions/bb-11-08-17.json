    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 11/08/2017\n\nBill finds himself in a very uncomfortable position when he becomes the target of threats and vilifications by the Spectra group.  Brooke has a difficult time trying to interpret Bill\u2019s actions when Katie tells her about the Spectra building\u2019s demolition.  Bill enters Liam and Sally\u2019s hospital room with his tail between his legs and his heart filled with guilt begging for forgiveness.  His attempt proves to be unsuccessful as Liam refuses all offers to even discuss a reconciliation.  While maintaining a neutral stance, Steffy tries to help Liam better understand Bill\u2019s side of the mishap.  Bill returns home to find Brooke waiting to discuss their future together.  Liam feels guilty about his kiss with Sally, while Sally reminisces about it fondly.",
