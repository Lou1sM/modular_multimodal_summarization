While discussing the ongoing and intensified conflict between Liam and Bill, Wyatt offers his father his complete and unwavering loyalty.  Coco can\u2019t help but sense from Sally that she has feelings for Liam after hearing her sister praise him for all he\u2019s done for her.  Sally becomes incredibly concerned when Liam insists on telling Steffy about the kiss they shared while trapped in the Spectra building rubble.",
