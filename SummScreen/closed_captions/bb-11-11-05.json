    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 11/11/2005\n\nBridget tells Brooke that the only thing standing in the way of a Brooke/Nick pairing is Brooke\u2019s pride. Nick insists that he and Brooke love Bridget much more than they love each other. Nick insists that he wants a family and life with her, but Bridget\u2019s guard is up. Thomas is dismayed to learn Ridge has quit Forrester Creations. Ridge finally sees that he was wrong for not supporting Taylor on her first day at Forrester. The press is puzzled by Stephanie\u2019s evasiveness during the press conference to announce the new changes at Forrester. Taylor saves the press conference by stating that Forrester Creations is in good shape, despite the changes. After the press conference, Hector tells Taylor he is in love with her.",
