    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 11/13/2017\n\nSteffy can\u2019t believe what she is hearing from Liam about what happened with Sally while they were trapped in the rubble of the Spectra building.  Liam goes on the defensive when Steffy confronts him about his feelings for Sally.  Coco is not only surprised by Sally\u2019s admitted love for Liam, but for how long she has had this mindset. While Bill is grateful that Liam and Steffy\u2019s marriage has endured this rough patch, he isn\u2019t so sure that his relationship with his son is, once again, repairable. Liam promises Steffy that he will end his affiliation with Sally. Steffy isn\u2019t buying it and advises Liam to go be with Sally as she walks out on him.",
