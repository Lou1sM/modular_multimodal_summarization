    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 11/14/2005\n\nBrooke is nearly successful in convincing Bridget that she can love Nick again, if she can see this situation in a new light. Despite herself, Taylor does not give into her desire for Hector. Ridge apologizes for not being there for Taylor at the press conference. Ridge insists that his bad behavior has been because of Stephanie and that he will get Forrester back. Taylor pleads that she needs more from Ridge, so he calls Hector to set things straight, to Taylor\u2019s delight.",
