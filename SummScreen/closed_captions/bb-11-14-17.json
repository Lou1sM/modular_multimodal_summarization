    "description": "Season: 31\nOriginal Air Date: 11/14/2017\n\nLiam is desperate to get a hold of Steffy so that they can move past his one-time lack of judgement and repair their marriage.  Steffy retreats to the Forrester mansion\u2019s guest house so that she can have some time to sort out how she feels about Liam kissing another woman.  Unable to suppress her feelings for a very married Liam, Sally fantasizes about what it would be like if SHE was Mrs. Liam Spencer.  Wyatt pays a visit to Liam to see how he is feeling and questions his brother\u2019s feelings for Sally after hearing about his fight with Steffy.  Bill seeks out Steffy to comfort her after learning about her fight with Liam.",
