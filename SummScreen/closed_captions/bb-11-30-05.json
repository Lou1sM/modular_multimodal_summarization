    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 11/30/2005\n\nStephanie finds out about Nick and Bridget and is shocked. She accuses Brooke of still having feelings for Nick and that she will be an immoral influence on her soon-to-be granddaughter. Bridget and Nick rekindle their love and forgive one another for all that has happened. Meanwhile, Felicia returns to take a job at Forrester Creations. She talks to Taylor about all the changes that have occurred in her life while she was gone. She also denies still having feelings for Nick, but from her expression it is obvious that she does.",
