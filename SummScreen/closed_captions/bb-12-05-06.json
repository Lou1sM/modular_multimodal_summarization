Later, Thorne asks Hector if he wants to live at his beach house for free, rather than live in the fire station because Thorne and Alexandria are moving in with Taylor.  Stephanie flashes back to her childhood memories. Stephanie admits to Eric that she wants to save their marriage. Stephanie and Ann discuss the past, and Stephanie admits that she told her children that Ann was dead. Stephanie wants to leave because Ann is not listening to her.",
