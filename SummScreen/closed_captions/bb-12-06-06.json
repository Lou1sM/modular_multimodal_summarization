    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/06/2006\n\nTaylor tells Ridge, Thorne and Felicia about their mother\u2019s tumultuous past. Felicia argues with Taylor that it can\u2019t be true but begins to believe what she is saying about Stephanie\u2019s revelations.  As Stephanie confronts Ann, Pamela admits that she realized what went on during their childhood (that Stephanie\u2019s father abused her) even though she didn\u2019t fully understand it. Stephanie asks Ann why she left her alone to deal with her father\u2019s rage; why she knew but did nothing to stop it.",
