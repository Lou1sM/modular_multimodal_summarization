    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/08/2006\n\nTaylor insists that even though everyone gets frustrated with their children, there is no excuse for domestic violence. Stephanie explains her past to her children (Ridge, Thorne, Felicia \u2013 Brooke and Eric are there as well) in greater detail. Everyone is proud that Stephanie found the strength to say what she needed to say to her mother. Later when Taylor and Stephanie have a moment alone, Taylor encourages Stephanie to confront her father; even though he is dead\u2026 she encourages her to speak out loud to him as if he were alive.  Stephanie breaks down as she speaks to her father and Taylor tells Stephanie that she\u2019s a true survivor.",
