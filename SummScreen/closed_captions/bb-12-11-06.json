Phoebe tells Shane that she believes in him and in them together. Thorne and Donna try to make amends even though Thorne is still upset at Donna for siding with Nick. Nick accuses Taylor of not loving Thorne despite having agreed to marry him. He says that she is only marrying Thorne out of guilt because of what happened to Darla.  Later, Jackie tells Nick that she wants him to start dating again. When Taylor and Thorne are alone, Thorne presents Taylor with a diamond engagement ring.",
