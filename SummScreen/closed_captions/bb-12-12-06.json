    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/12/2006\n\nNick and Jackie are frustrated with everything that is going wrong with Forrester Creations (it doesn\u2019t seem to be the same since the Forresters left). Taylor suggests to Thorne that she could counsel Nick and make him find peace so that he\u2019ll hopefully give Forrester Creations back.  She tells Thorne that could be her wedding gift to him. Ridge is shocked to hear Phoebe defend Shane, but she insists that he isn\u2019t dangerous. A bloody/injured Shane (he was beat up) startles Bridget and arrives on her front deck. Bridget calls Phoebe and Phoebe begs Bridget to allow Shane to stay at her place for the night.  Shane says he will keep his distance so he won\u2019t cause trouble for young Phoebe. Jackie encourages Nick to become confidantes with Taylor. Nick agrees to attend counseling sessions with Taylor.",
