Taylor has now witnessed many of the phony arguments between Eric and Brooke, and she tries to convince Stephanie that Eric and Brooke have had a falling out.  Despite this effort Stephanie has trouble believing that it is true, until she walks in on an argument between Eric and Brooke.  Eric tells Stephanie that she was right about Brooke, and that he is sorry for hurting her.  It appears his plan is working perfectly.  Felicia reveals that she still has feelings for Nick.",
