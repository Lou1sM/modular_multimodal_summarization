    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/13/2006\n\nThorne thanks Taylor for getting Eric and Stephanie\u2019s relationship back on track. Later, Eric tells Ridge and Thorne that they cannot cut corners starting their new fashion business. Thorne tells Eric and Ridge of Taylor\u2019s plan to get Forrester Creations back from Nick. Phoebe refuses to testify against Shane and gets Lt. Baker to drop the charges against him.  Later, Phoebe visits Shane as Bridget treats his injuries.  Phoebe tells Shane the good news; he doesn\u2019t have to run anymore.  Shane is grateful and they share a kiss in front of a skeptical Bridget.  An upset Ridge finds out that the charges against Shane have been dropped and doesn\u2019t want Shane involved in his daughter\u2019s life. As Taylor counsels Nick, he insists he has no secrets but thoughts of his past come back to distract him.",
