    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/15/2006\n\nAnn begs for Stephanie\u2019s forgiveness. Stephanie tells her she accepts her apologies, but cannot forgive her and then forces Ann and Pamela to leave. At the Forrester offices, Nick invites Taylor out for lunch on Nick\u2019s boat. Taylor accuses Nick of trying to avoid their therapy sessions but he admits he is just more comfortable at the Shady Marlin.  As Nick and Taylor start to explore Nick\u2019s past, Nick tells Taylor that the sailor friends he had growing up were better men on their worst days than his real father, Frank Payne, ever was and that they were better off when he died. Jackie tries eavesdrops on Nick and Taylor\u2019s conversation from the reception area.",
