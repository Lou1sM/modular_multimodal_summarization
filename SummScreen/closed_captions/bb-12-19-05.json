She also tells them that she is not going to do chemotherapy.  Stephanie becomes angry at the news, while Eric tries to convince Felicia to change her mind and give the chemotherapy a try.  Bridget tells Nick that she is not ready to take on baby Dominick.  To Bridget\u2019s surprise Nick is very understanding, but he is obviously hurt by the fact that he will not get a chance to raise his son.",
