    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/20/2006\n\nStephanie leaves Eric and Felicia to tend with the Christmas decorations so she can go run a last minute errand. Eric reveals to Felicia that he is planning to fly in Stephanie\u2019s mother, Ann for Christmas. Felicia has her doubts that anything different will happen between Stephanie and Ann. Ridge and Brooke read Hope and RJ a story, and they all celebrate being a family. Stephanie later shows up and tells Brooke how grateful she is that she and Ridge have finally reunited. Alexandria gives Taylor \u201cmommy\u2019s\u201d stocking to have, but Taylor insists they hang it up because Darla is still part of the family. Thorne admits to Taylor that he misses Darla.",
