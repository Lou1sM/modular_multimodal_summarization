Felicia surprises them by coming home from the hospital and announcing that Bridget has decided to raise her child after she is gone.  Brooke explains to Nick how hard this decision must be for Bridget. Both are afraid that she cannot handle raising another woman\u2019s child, but Bridget lets them know that she is up for it. Bridget assures Nick that her decision was not made simply for his sake, but that she also wanted to raise baby Dominick.",
