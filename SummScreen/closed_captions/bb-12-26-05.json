    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 12/26/2005\n\nFelicia discusses her illness with Stephanie and the two become closer than they ever have been before. Felicia confides in her mother how scared she is, and that she doesn\u2019t want to die crying, but instead partying. Brooke and Taylor discuss Brooke\u2019s feelings for Nick. Taylor is unsure that Brooke will be able to contain those feelings, but Brooke assures her that she will do everything in her power to keep her feelings to herself. Bridget and Nick begin to decorate Dominick\u2019s room in a ship theme. The chair leg breaks, while Bridget is trying to retrieve a model ship from a shelf. Bridget and the shelf fall over, and Nick rushes in to help her.",
