    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/26/2006\n\nJackie tells Nick the cruise line needs to be redone, but he is distracted. Jackie does not think Taylor is helping Nick but Nick calls Taylor to meet him at his boat for another session. Stephanie walks in on Jackie frustrated on how a dress looks on a model.  Stephanie taunts Jackie about how she will be able to buy back the company at a cheap rate since her and Nick are doing such a poor job. Later Nick, admits he is bothered because he can\u2019t remember some childhood memories. Taylor helps Nick relax and he begins to remember that Jackie accepted money from Captain Kramer for sex, as well as other men. He comes out of his relaxation stage and feels sick, as he remembers and tells Taylor that his mother was a prostitute.",
