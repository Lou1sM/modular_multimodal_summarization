    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/27/2006\n\nNick struggles with the realization that his mother was a prostitute. Taylor tries to help Nick understand why he would block out memories of his mother. Nick explains to Taylor how he left home as soon as he was old enough to. Stephanie and Jackie argue and Stephanie accuses Jackie of being a whore. Stephanie tells Jackie that as soon as Taylor helps Nick realize what kind of woman Jackie is, Nick will give back the company. Later at the office, Taylor explains to her co-worker, Dr. Kibe, that she has never seen a more vulnerable patient than Nick. Then she proceeds to tape record some verbal notes about her session with Nick.  Taylor is horrified when she realizes that Stephanie has overheard her session notes about Jackie being a prostitute. Nick confronts and questions Jackie about her relationships with Captain Kramer and his friends.  Jackie realizes that Nick must know the truth.",
