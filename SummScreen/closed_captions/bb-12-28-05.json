    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 12/28/2005\n\nBridget and Nick are relieved when it turns out that the baby is fine. Nick calls Brooke to come comfort Bridget. Later, Brooke hugs Nick to calm him down, and Stephanie spots them. She accuses Brooke of being all over Nick and wishing that Bridget\u2019s baby had been lost. Stephanie also discusses Ridge\u2019s absence with Taylor and realizes how upset it makes her. Darla spots Hector coming to visit Taylor and questions his motives. Darla tells Hector that she doesn\u2019t care for Ridge, and that Hector should pursue Taylor. Hector then finds Taylor at her house and confesses his feelings for her. He tries to kiss her, but she resists his advances.",
