    "description": "Season: 20\nOriginal Air Date: 12/28/2006\n\nJackie tells Nick that she slept with Captain Kramer and the others for money. Nick remembers bringing Captain Kramer around and hoping that Jackie would like him and that they would fall in love. Nick is angry with Jackie and tells her that he doesn\u2019t know her anymore.  Stephanie tells Taylor that with this information about Jackie, Taylor has now found a way to get the Forresters their company back. Taylor tells Stephanie that if she says anything about Jackie and Captain Kramer, she will not lift a finger to help her get the company back and that any relationship they ever had will be over. Later, Nick blames himself for Jackie\u2019s past and he tells Taylor that it is too late to rescue him. He tells Taylor that he wants her to leave, but she embraces him instead.",
