    "description": "Season: 19\nOriginal Air Date: 12/29/2005\n\nBrooke and Stephanie discuss the company.  Brooke is concerned that it is not doing well but Stephanie defends the company\u2019s success. They then discuss Taylor and Ridge, and Brooke says that even Taylor can be human and make mistakes. Hector talks to Thomas about his mother and Ridge. Darla drops by Taylor\u2019s place and tries to convince Taylor that Ridge is not a good man. Hector stops by to see Taylor and wish her luck with Ridge\u2019s return. At that moment, Ridge calls and tells Taylor he is staying in Paris longer.  Hector comforts a saddened Taylor and confesses his love. The two move in closer, as if they are about to kiss.",
