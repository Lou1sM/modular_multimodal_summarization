    "soap_central": "\n\nCraig paid a visit to Carly, once again bearing gifts. This time, he had a birthday present for Parker, who had just turned 16. Carly told Craig that Parker hadn't even opened the Christmas present Craig had given him and wouldn't want this present, either, but Craig wanted to let Parker decide that for himself. Carly told Craig that Parker wasn't there, but Craig said he would wait for him. Carly reluctantly agreed to give Craig a cup of coffee, after asking him if he took it with one scoop of drain cleaner or two. \n\n\nParker went to the farm, where he asked Jack if he could skip hockey practice and instead go driving, since he'd gotten his license. Jack told Parker there were patches of ice on the roads, so driving would have to wait for another day. Parker moped about it, but he left and went home to pick up his equipment. There, he found Craig waiting in the living room. Craig offered him the birthday gift, which Parker took unenthusiastically. When Craig asked what was wrong, Parker complained that he didn't have the same privileges that most 16-year-olds had, like driving. Craig asked if Parker had his license, and when Parker replied that he did, Craig tossed him his car keys. Parker was amazed and asked if Craig was seriously going to let him take his car. Craig told Parker to wear his seat belt and obey all the traffic laws, but have fun. Astonished but elated, Parker thanked Craig and left. \n\n\nCarly came out with the coffee, and Craig told her Parker had picked up his hockey equipment and left again. Carly asked why Craig was trying to cozy up to Parker, and Craig admitted that he had no one left to care about except Parker, who, like everyone else, could barely tolerate him. He accepted responsibility for that, admitting that he had brought it on himself, and he told Carly he had become what everyone wanted him to be: alone. Carly began to feel sorry for Craig; she offered to buy him something to eat, and they left together in Carly's car to go to Metro. \n\n\nAt Metro, Craig asked Carly how business was going. Carly said it could be better, and Craig said if Carly tried, she could make Metro a profitable place again. Carly admitted her focus hadn't been on the business lately, but instead on her kids. She told Craig that the kids had wanted Jack and Carly to get back together, and Jack's marriage to Janet had put an end to those hopes. Craig prodded Carly until she admitted that she had hoped to get back together with Jack. Craig told Carly that it wasn't like her to give up a fight until she'd won the title. Carly said she had relinquished the title, and there was no one left to fight. Craig replied, \"There's always someone. Don't let Jack walk away with what was so extraordinary about you.\" \n\n\nJack called Carly and asked if she knew where Parker was. Carly said Parker had just been at the house and would probably be at the rink soon. Jack asked where Carly was, and she told him she was at Metro, and she would let him know if she heard from Parker. After she hung up, Craig told her that Parker might be farther away than she thought, because he had loaned Parker his car. Carly was furious. Craig explained that he had been trying to cheer Parker up, but Carly told him he should have acted like a responsible adult. As they talked, Jack walked in, and Carly told him to ask Craig where Parker was. \n\n\nJack was equally furious with Craig for having loaned Parker his car. He told Craig he'd seen at least three cars that had skidded off the road because of the patchy ice. Craig said he'd had no idea the roads were bad, because the route he had taken had been perfectly clear. He said he wouldn't have given Parker his keys if he'd known there was ice on any of the roads. Jack got Craig's license plate number, and he left. \n\n\nCarly told Craig she couldn't believe he'd been so irresponsible, especially in light of what had happened to Bryant, Craig's son. Craig warned Carly not to go there and admitted again that he'd made a mistake by giving Parker the car. Carly asked if Craig remembered that he'd been with Parker the night Bryant died, and Craig said that of course he remembered that. Carly left, disgusted, and went to the police station to see if Jack had had any luck finding Parker. \n\n\nParker picked up Liberty to take her for a ride. They parked the car somewhere, and Parker kissed Liberty. His cell phone rang, but Parker didn't answer it. Instead, he went back to kissing Liberty. However, Liberty became too cold to sit in the parked car. Parker tried to start the car, but the engine wouldn't turn over. Liberty thought Parker was joking, but she soon realized he was telling the truth: they were stuck in the cold weather in a car that wouldn't start. Parker tried to make a phone call, but the phone was no longer getting any reception. He and Liberty moved to the back seat, where they huddled together for warmth and soon returned to kissing. \n\n\nEventually, Liberty suggested Parker try to start the car again. He did, and amazingly, the car started. He dropped Liberty off, then he called Jack. Parker tried to say he was just waiting at the hockey rink, but Jack told him that they knew about Parker's joy ride. Jack told Parker to walk home and wait for him and Carly there. \n\n\nCraig went to the hospital to ask the nurses if anyone matching Parker's description had been brought in because of a car accident and was relieved to hear they hadn't had any accident victims that day. He called Carly to let her know and reached her as she and Jack were arriving at her house. Carly told Craig that they had found Parker, and then she hung up on him. Parker walked into the house and started to apologize, but Jack told him not to. Jack reminded Parker that he had already told him he couldn't drive in the bad weather conditions. Jack told Parker he would be lucky to see the inside of a car again before springtime. Parker called Liberty and told her he was in trouble, but it had been worth it to be with her. Meanwhile, Jack told Carly he was serious about not wanting Craig to be anywhere near their kids. Carly assured Jack that it wouldn't be a problem again. \n\n\nIn her room at the Lakeview, Lucy told Alison they had found a bone marrow donor match for Johnny, and it was Katie. Alison said they would have to tell Katie the truth about who the sick child was, and Lucy reluctantly agreed. Lucy left Johnny with Alison and went to WOAK to see Katie. \n\n\nKatie was shocked when Lucy walked into her office. Lucy explained that the sick child Alison had told Katie about was actually Johnny. She then said that Katie was a match for Johnny, and Johnny needed a bone marrow transplant, or he would die. Katie asked if Craig knew about the situation, but Lucy said Johnny's life depended on Craig not finding out about it. Katie said that although her brother was a bad person, she thought he still deserved to be told that his son was in Oakdale and that he was sick. Lucy said Craig had had several chances to show what kind of father he could be, and he had failed. Lucy didn't think it was possible for Craig to change. She then asked Katie to help save Johnny's life. \n\n\nJosie went to see Dusty in his office and told him she had seen Lucy and Johnny in Old Town. Dusty didn't believe her and pointed out that Josie didn't even know what Lucy looked like. Josie said she'd gone to the hospital and asked to see Lucy's picture, so she was sure it was Lucy. Josie also told Dusty that Johnny was sick. When Dusty asked how Josie knew that, she said Lucy had told her so. Dusty was skeptical, but Josie insisted she was telling the truth. Josie then told Dusty that Lucy and Johnny must be staying at the Lakeview, because the first time she had seen Johnny had been in the elevator there. Josie reminded Dusty of the little boy who had thought she was his mother; she told him that had been Johnny, and that she had seen the desk clerk take the boy back upstairs. They left together to go to the Lakeview to check it out. \n\n\nAt the hotel, Dusty gave the desk clerk money to let him look through the registration book. He quickly found a room registered to Alison, which he thought was suspicious. Josie remembered Alison's appeal for help for a sick child, and together, she and Dusty went upstairs to Alison's room. When Dusty pounded on the door, calling for Alison, Alison took Johnny and asked him to wait quietly in the bathroom. Alison opened the door to the room, and Dusty and Josie walked in, with Dusty asking where Johnny and Lucy were. Alison said they weren't there, so Dusty sent Josie down to the lobby to look for them. Dusty asked why Alison was lying to him. He reminded her that he had gotten her off of drugs, and Alison said she knew that. Dusty asked why she would deny him his son, but Alison said she wasn't trying to do that. Dusty told her he understood if she thought she was helping Johnny by hiding him, but if Johnny was sick, he wanted to know. \n\n\nAlison relented and brought Johnny out of the bathroom. Dusty asked if Johnny remembered him, and he told Johnny he was his daddy. Johnny said, \"No, you're a bad man!\" Alison assured Johnny that Dusty wasn't bad. She said Dusty had only knocked so hard on the door because he was Johnny's daddy and wanted to see him. Dusty reached out to touch Johnny and could feel how hot he was. He told Alison that Johnny was burning up, and he thought they should go to the hospital right away. Alison told Dusty it wasn't necessary, and she said Lucy had found a donor for Johnny already. Dusty asked who it was, but Alison wouldn't tell him. Dusty then picked Johnny up and said he would take him to the hospital himself, but Johnny began yelling \"no,\" and he struggled to get down. \n\n\nLucy came into the room and saw what was happening; she took Johnny, leading him over to play with a toy. She then asked Dusty what he was thinking, terrifying Johnny like that, but Dusty countered by asking what Lucy had been thinking by keeping him from his son. Alison interrupted to ask Lucy if she had talked to the donor, and Lucy said that Katie had agreed to the bone marrow transplant. Dusty was surprised to hear the donor was Craig's sister, but Lucy said Katie was also her aunt, and Katie had promised not to tell Craig what was going on. Lucy then asked Alison to go to the hospital, where Katie was waiting for her, to perform some preliminary tests. \n\n\nAlison left, and Dusty told Lucy he didn't know what to say to her. He wanted to take Johnny to a doctor, and when Lucy pointed out that she was a doctor, Dusty said he meant a doctor he could trust. Lucy said she loved Johnny, but Dusty said he was his son, not hers. Lucy said she knew she'd made Dusty angry, but she had taken Johnny away in order to protect him. Dusty responded that from that point on, he would be the one calling the shots. \n\n\nJosie arrived, and Dusty told her that he had actually seen Johnny. He told Josie he owed her a lot for having led him to his son. Lucy came out of the bathroom with Johnny and told Dusty they were ready to go. Dusty told Josie that he and Lucy were going to take Johnny to the hospital. He tried to take Johnny's hand, but Johnny wouldn't let him, so Johnny walked out holding only Lucy's hand. \n\n\nAlison met Katie at the hospital and took her into an examining room. Craig spotted the two of them. Inside the room, Katie asked Alison if she thought Lucy was doing the right thing by keeping Johnny's condition and location a secret from Craig. Alison said Katie had to keep it a secret from Craig. Just then, Craig walked into the room and asked Katie what was going on.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
