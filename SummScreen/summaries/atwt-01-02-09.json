Parker hasn't even opened his Christmas one yet, so she doubts he will want this one either. And trying to buy her son's attention isn't going to score any points with her either. Take a hint! Jack nixes Parker practicing his driving today now that he is 16 and has a license. Jack warns the weather is bad and a lot of black ice out there. He tells him the only ice they are going to deal with is at the hockey rink. So go get his gear and meet him. Parker returns home and also is nonplussed by Craig being there even with a gift. But frowns turn to an almost smile when Craig hands him the keys to his car so Parker can drive to practice. Lucy tells Alison they found a match for Johnny. It's Katie. They must tell Katie the truth that it is for Johnny, but swear her to secrecy. Lucy will not let her father get his hands on Johnny. Dusty is cool to Josie as he sees her buying into Paul's garbage. She tells him it's not bunk; she has seen Johnny and he's in Oakdale. Carly actually offers Craig some food and they head for Metro. He knows she does nothing for free. He offers advice that if she really put her mind to it, she could turn this club into something more than a cafeteria. She admits she put too much focus on her kids and trying to get Jack back and it didn't work out. He says he could help her with some of those long, lonely nights. He reminds her that when she is hit, she hits back. She's a prize fighter and doesn't give up until she's won the title. Dusty asks questions at the Lakeview and although Lucy is not registered there, Alison is and he pounds on her door until she answers. She denies everything, but finally has to produce Johnny. Dusty is happy to see his son, though the little boy wants nothing to do with him. He wants Alison to explain more about the bone marrow transplant. He knows it is for Johnny. Alison tells him they have found a donor. Dusty wants to take Johnny and run, but Lucy spells out the risks. He wants all the details and says he is Johnny's dad and he is calling the shots now. Parker takes Liberty along on his joy ride. When they stop, the car won't start up again. They rely on the good old make-out session of kissing to keep warm. Both Jack and Carly are furious at Craig for loaning the car to Parker. He's going to put out an APB for the car and tells Craig to stay away from his kid. Jack gets Parker on his cell phone and tells him he is in a heap of trouble. Now walk home ASAP. Then he gives him a lecture of not going behind his back to get what he wants from Craig. He'll be lucky to see the inside of a car before spring. Craig checks with the hospital to see if any new accident victims have come in. While there he spots Alison with Katie and has suspicions of why they are huddled together and Katie is giving blood. Lucy, Dusty and Johnny head to the hospital. Dusty thanks Josie and says he did not believe her, but she came through for him and he owes her."
