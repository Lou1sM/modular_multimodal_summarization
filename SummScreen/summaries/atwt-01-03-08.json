Meg wonders how much Craig drank on his medication, which is dangerous, as Craig continues to babble only somewhat lucidly about not taking a medication while pregnant. Meg doesn't understand what he means. Meg thinks it is because Craig is worried about their baby possibly being sick, but Craig lets it slip that he is still mad about Paul.

She is devastated that she believed they were good together, but Dusty explains that they both knew that their hearts were elsewhere, but Lily is getting more angry with him and Emily. She believed he would not abandon her and that he would always be there for her; she gave up fighting for her marriage because of him and now she has no one, as he goes back to Emily.

She wants their marriage to work, but he has to as well. Craig breezes by her and tells her that he is going to sleep. Meg knows there is something else going on with Craig other then the obvious and she is going to find out."
