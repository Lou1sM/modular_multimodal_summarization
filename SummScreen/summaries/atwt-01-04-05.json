What her parents don't know is that Lucy is still very much in danger -- Dominic Ramsey has surprised them and has pointed a gun at Lucy's head.  Dusty tries to reason with Dominic, but he gets nowhere, and tries unsuccessfully to wrestle the gun from Dominic.  Just moments before Dominic can shoot, the beams in the mine shaft give way to the weight of the avalanche and crush him.  The three make a hasty escape up the stairs and are rescued by the forest service rangers, who assure Dusty that there is no way they will ever find Dominic.  A heartbroken Rafael listens as Lucy and Dusty revel in their touching reunion.\n\n\nCarly surprises Jack at the police station with a Happy New Year's kiss.  He is clearly pleased to see her, but needs to leave his desk for a moment to finish some work.  While he's in the next room, his cell phone rings...Carly answers.  Carly is not surprised when the voice on the other end of the phone is Julia -- who else would be calling him just moments after the New Year?  Julia demands to talk to Jack, but Carly tells her that he is busy and hangs up on her.  When Jack returns to his desk, Carly tells him about the call, and a discussion about Jack's promise to be a father to JJ ensues.  Carly tells Jack that by trying to be his father that he is not really helping JJ, but Jack refuses to go back on a promise.  He wants to build a schedule for visitation, but Carly suspects that Jack will never be able to satisfy Julia's time demands.  When Jack leaves to take a phone call, Carly says to herself: \"You're too nice, Jack, and Julia knows that.  I'll have to take matters into my own hands.\"\n\n\nJulia, however, may not be as much a problem to her marriage as Carly fears.  When Lisa finds Julia in the Lakeview lobby, she is still fuming over her chat with Carly and tells Lisa that if she and JJ can't rely on Jack, she'll find someone upon whom they can rely.  Lisa bristles when Julia mentions what a lovely person Holden is, and how nice he has been to them.  Lisa doesn't mince words -- she tells Julia that he and Lily have been married many years and adds that Lily has many friends in Oakdale.  Julia tries to reassure Lisa that she is not interested in Holden romantically, but Lisa seems somehow uneasy about the conversation.\n\n\nHolden is waiting at home for Lily when she rushes in, all apologies.  She probably wasn't expecting a romantic welcome, but she certainly didn't expect him to announce that he was leaving her that very night.  Even though things have been difficult, she is surprised and accuses him of not caring about what has happened to them.  He tells her that he does care, and that leaving is not easy -- he says that she has changed and that he feels he has lost her.\n\n\nAnd who should see Holden when he checks in at the Lakeview?  Julia, who is in no hurry to return to the farm after her chat with Lisa, sees him and immediately asks what is wrong.  Holden is friendly, but tells her he doesn't want to talk.  She persists, knowing there must be some reason he's checking in to the hotel.  He is happy to have someone to talk to, and tells her that he left his wife.  She is all sympathy and listens attentively.  She is obviously pleased when he tells her he will be moving in at the farm the next day.  When Holden's room is ready, Julia says good bye with a very warm  hug.  And when he leaves her to go to his room, the look on her face says that Jack is now very far from her thoughts.....\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Holden leaves Lily. When he arrives at the Lakeview, he talks with Julia and she's excited that he's going to be moving out to the farm. Carly and Jack heatedly discuss the situation with JJ, ultimately Jack saying he's going to keep his word to him and Carly deciding she's going to need to do something about Julia. Sierra informs Craig that Lucy is safe and coming home, Craig returning the favor by stating he isn't going to tell Lucy about what Sierra had done to him. Sierra is suspicious at first but by the time Craig leaves, she seems to believe him. Lucinda talks Jordan into keeping an eye on Craig for her.",
