    "tvmega_recap": "Meg is anxious to share baby news with Craig, but he pulls away and is evasive about his feelings. Dusty goes to the police station and tries to get Margo to run interference for him and get him in to see Bob. Tom joins and tells him to stop making accusations, where's the proof that his brother has done anything wrong, and to leave his family alone! Lily takes exception that Emily puts on a little show with Chris for her benefit. She calls her not only a home- wrecker, but a whore. Emily defends by saying she is happy with Chris, she doesn't want Dusty and their one night was a mistake. Frustrated, Lily walks into a bar and allows herself to be picked up by Jay who gives her a pill to cheer her up. Holden finds her later back in her hotel room conked out. She has forgotten to pick up Faith. In the chaos, he forgets about his date with Bonnie. Meg checks with nurse Jan about the drug, xyphorex, Craig is taking for his infection. Jan says it is a good thing she did not come in contact with it, she could have lost the baby. Emily bumps into Dusty and rails on him for blabbing all about New Year's Eve to Lily. He admits she is not his girlfriend and he loves Emily and he wishes she would be more honest to herself about her feelings. She says he had no right to be so damn honest about her personal life. She later convinces Chris not to try to help Lily as she is too stressed and is blaming everybody for her breakup with Dusty. Meg tells Craig that she had another doctor's appointment and a sonogram and the baby will be the spitting image of him. He panics, does not want the boy to be named after him, and leaves her standing in wonderment. It's clear that he no longer wants this baby, but why? She calls Jan to get Eli's number to ask him about possible DNA test mix-ups. Holden offers to bring Lily back to the farm and take care of her. She jumps at the chance, but has false hopes and finally declines. She calls Faith who has to be made to even talk to her, her mommy took a nap and forgot her! Snooping around, Dusty finds Dr. Bob's coffee cup on the floor in his office and calls to have it analyzed. Meg calls Paul and leaves a message that she has news about the baby."
