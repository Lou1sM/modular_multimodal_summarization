Katie let him in, but Henry noticed that she looked a bit disappointed when she found out he was her visitor.  He guessed that Katie would have preferred her caller to be Simon.  Katie said that she had seen Brad on Christmas Eve, and they had said their farewells.  She said she was sad, but at least they had a real opportunity to say goodbye.  Henry said he was glad to see her smile again, and suddenly the lights turned on.\n\n\nHenry brought up the subject of Simon, but Katie reminded him that she had been the one who had asked Simon to leave.  Henry was all of a sudden famished, and he asked Katie if she would like to go to Al's for a burger.  Katie said she did not want to take the baby out in the cold, although she was a bit restless from having to stay in the house for so long.  Henry suggested that he order take-out from the diner, and he asked Katie if she would like to pick it up.  Katie said it would be nice to get out, so she grabbed her coat and left.\n\n\nWhen Katie got to the diner, she peeked in and saw Simon reading the newspaper at a table.  Katie went in and spoke to Simon, who told her that he had decided to stay indefinitely in Oakdale.  Katie was suspicious that Henry had set-up her \"chance meeting\" with Simon, and then she realized that Simon was actually working for Henry there.  Simon admitted that he had needed a job after donating all his ill-gotten revenue to charity.  Katie could not believe that Simon was staying in town.\n\n\nSimon and Katie continued their conversation until the diner's only other patron, a man who had been celebrating the new year way too much, called out that if Simon didn't want Katie, he would take her because she was \"hot.\"  That caused Simon to jump to his feet, and he ushered the drunk out of the diner, after first lifting the fellow's watch.  \"So much for going legit,\" quipped Katie.  Simon promised to take the watch to the police station the next day, and he got Katie's take-out order.  Katie asked if he would care to join them at her house, and a bashful Simon accepted readily since his shift was over.\n\n\nThe two returned to Katie's and found Henry watching a \"Twilight Zone\" marathon on television.  Katie called Henry into the kitchen and chewed him out for setting her up with Simon.  Eventually both men fell asleep during the marathon, one on each side of Katie.  Katie decided to go to bed, so she turned off the television and slipped off the couch.  She checked the baby and then remarked that her \"three boys\" were asleep.\"  She turned out the lights and went to bed.\n\n\nIn Dusty's room at the Lakeview, Dusty and Janet awakened when the lights all turned on.  Janet was horrified to realize that she'd had sex with Dusty Donovan, but he advised her not to beat herself up about it.  Janet was frantic to get home, and as she got dressed, Dusty told her not to feet guilty or upset.  Janet said she was married and had violated her sacred vows.  Dusty said Janet was refusing to admit that what had happened between them actually meant something.  Janet just wanted to forget it had ever happened, and she stormed out.\n\n\nStranded in the cabin in the woods, Jack and Carly realized that it was after midnight on New Year's Da y.  They talked about how people were kissing all over their time zone, and they stood very close together.  Carly, however, reminded Jack that he was married, but Jack wasn't sure he had much of a marriage to go back to.  Carly assured him that Janet would always take him back, and she kissed him on the cheek.  Jack returned the kiss on Carly's cheek, and they heard a snowplow on the road.  Jack mentioned that the county was clearing the roads, and just then the lights all blazed again.\n\n\nCarly wakened Craig, who said that he had the most horrible dream in which he was naked in a tub, and Jack was giving him a sponge bath.  Carly told him that his fever had broken, and Craig realized that his nightmare had actually happened.  He declared that \"what happened in the cabin,\" stayed in the cabin.  A ranger knocked on the door, and Jack made arrangements for a ride back to town and a tow vehicle for their cars.  Unfortunately, the ranger only had room for two passengers, so Carly said that she did not feel comfortable leaving Craig alone.\n\n\nCarly urged Jack to go back to town and save someone else he was close to.  As Jack walked out, he told Craig that he had trashed Craig's clothes because they reeked of pond scum.  Craig began mourning his $4000 suit, but Carly found some interesting retro clothes in the dresser at the cabin, and over his protests, she got him to put them on.  Craig thanked Carly for tending to him during his fever, but Carly got angry about why they were there in the first place.  She told him that the two of them had \"no chance\" together.  The ranger returned and was ready to take them back to town.\n\n\nJack walked into the Lakeview and found Janet refreshing her makeup in the lobby.  He said he couldn't believe that she was still there waiting for him.  He apologized for missing their \"date,\" but he said that he had finally gotten his head straight.  He told Janet that he loved her and asked her to give him a second chance and let him return home.  Jack said he had forgiven her for kissing Dusty on Christmas Eve, and he wanted to get their marriage back on track.  He called his wife a beautiful, desirable woman, and he promised to back off from Carly's problems unless they related to their kids.\n\n\nJanet, fresh from Dusty's bed, warned Jack that he had to definitely commit to the two of them, and he agreed.  Jack wanted to get a bottle of champagne and a room at the Lakeview, as Dusty watched from a corner of the lobby.  Janet suddenly told Jack that they couldn't stay there because she wanted to go home.  She said her car was out front, and she would meet him at home.  Dusty watched the couple leave, and he walked through the lobby and popped a balloon in one of the decorations.\n\n\nDusty went to Metro and fixed himself a stiff drink.  Teri was still there, and she asked Dusty why he was in such a foul mood.  She asked him about his New Year's Eve celebration, but Dusty was reluctant to say much.  Teri said the storm and the blackout had cost the club big bucks, but Dusty said that they would donate the unused food to the local homeless shelters.  That pleased Teri very much.  Dusty went back to his hotel room and stared at his unmade bed.  He flashed back to making love to Janet earlier that evening.\n\n\nJack and Janet went to the farm, and Jack hugged her and attempted to kiss her.  Janet pulled away and announced that she wanted to take a shower.  Jack said he would pour them wine while he waited for her to return.  Jack was in the mood for romance, but when Janet rejoined him after her shower, she held back.  Jack wrongly assumed that he was responsible for \"the distance\" between them, and he promised to \"fix it.\"  Janet got angry and declared that taking her to bed was not going to fix anything.\n\n\nJanet told Jack that he was \"just too late,\" but when he asked his wife to explain, Janet asked him to leave.  She said it was too late to talk, and she yelled at him to go.  A very confused Jack walked out into the night.\n\n\nJanet sat at Emma's kitchen table and drank her wine, and soon Teri walked in.  She was excited that Dusty had donated the food to the homeless, and she finally noticed her sister's bad mood.  Janet said that her marriage was over, but she didn't want to talk about it.  Teri asked what the story was with her and Dusty, and Janet got very defensive. Teri said that she was \"so into Dusty,\" but she didn't want to step on Janet's toes.  Janet denied that anything was going on between her and Dusty, and she ran upstairs.  Teri was befuddled.\n\n\nCarly and Craig finally returned to the Lakeview, and Craig coughed and hacked his way across the lobby to the elevator in his outlandish clothes from the 80s.  Craig invited Carly to his room for a \"New Year's Eve nightcap,\" and she had to remind him that he was talking to an alcoholic.  Craig then warned her that if she ever told anyone that Jack Snyder had given him a sponge bath...and his voice trailed off.  Carly laughed and walked away.  Craig went up to his room and found a photo of Carly in a drawer.  He looked at it and said he was not giving up on the two of them.\n\n\nCarly was turning off the lights in her house when she was surprised to hear Jack knock on the door.  He asked to use her sofa again, and she let him in.  He said Janet had kicked him out because \"too much had happened.\"  Jack was confused, and Carly guessed that something mush have happened to change Janet's mind.  A dejected Jack sat on the couch, and Carly snuggled up to him in consolation.\n\n\n",
