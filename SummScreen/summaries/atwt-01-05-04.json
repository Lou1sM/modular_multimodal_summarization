When he returns, he finds Katie holding Snickers.  After they introduce the new rabbit friends, Katie offers to dry Mike's clothes while he takes a hot shower.

Lily leaves for Paul's arraignment, and soon Carly appears at Mitzi's door.  Carly tells Mitzi that she and Emily smelled Mitzi's perfume in Rose's house before the murder, then directly accuses Mitzi of murdering Rose.

Lily asks him to give Mitzi a chance, and Holden agrees, but he still urges her to pack up Rose's belongings and to sell the shop.  Lily responds, \"Maybe when Paul Ryan is put away for life, I can start living mine again.\"  Lily insists that she must attend Paul's arraignment, reasoning that Rose would have done the same for her, but she turns down Holden's offer to accompany her, saying, \"Dusty will be there.\"  Holden warns Lily not to lean on Dusty out of guilt for not heeding his warnings about Paul.  Lily angrily accuses Holden of questioning all her choices, but apologizes to Holden before she leaves.  Holden promises Lily, \"I will not give up what we have,\" reminding her that he felt a loss as great as hers when he thought he had lost her.

Pretending to sympathize with her, while recalling that he himself was the one who put the poison goblet in the mausoleum and lured Paul to the mausoleum by a phone call, Craig offers to go to the police station with Rosanna.  However, as they prepare to leave, Craig receives a phone call from Annabel Fettle, who insists that he meet her at once or else she will go to the police.  Craig stays behind, and Mrs. Fettle comes over and demands that Craig furnish a place for her to stay until it is safe for her to return to Ottawa.

When Jessica leaves to try to postpone the bail hearing, Jennifer suggests to Paul that they appeal to Barbara for bail, but Paul refuses, since he is convinced that Barbara is the one who set him up.  Jennifer insists that Barbara would never incriminate Paul, and further,  she would not take a chance of being separated from Will.  Rosanna bursts into the interview room and offers to post bail for Paul herself.  Paul tries to refuse, telling Rosanna, \"The evidence against me is overwhelming....I'll be damned if I'm going to take you down with me.\"  Rosanna reassures Paul that she knows that he is innocent because she is convinced that he loved Rose, and in fact he still loves her.  When Jessica and Jennifer come back in to take Paul to his arraignment, Paul announces that Rosanna is posting his bail.  Delighted, they all agree that the kind of faith Rosanna has in Paul will go a long way, both in and out of the courtroom.\n\n\nDusty admits to his attorney on the telephone that his purpose in filing the civil suit is to freeze Paul's assets until after the bail hearing.

Get it?\"  He accuses Molly of ruining the chances of finding Rose's real killer by tampering with the evidence, then warns her, \"You're going to pay!  After we put away Paul, we'll take care of you.\"  After he leaves for the arraignment, Molly muses, \"If Dusty's not going to help me, maybe Lily will.\"\n\n\n",
