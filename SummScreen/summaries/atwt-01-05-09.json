As Dusty tried to establish a rapport with his boy, Lucy cautioned him not to force himself on Johnny. \n\n\nCraig talked to Alison and Katie, as he surprised them in an exam room in the hospital. He was curious when a nurse entered and referred to Katie's \"procedure.\" Alison and the nurse gave Craig and Katie a moment alone, and Craig surmised that Katie was a matching bone marrow donor for the daughter of Alison's friend. Katie denied that vehemently and said she was just having her annual physical. Craig made his sister promise she would call him if the doctor found anything untoward. \n\n\nDusty and group met Alison waiting outside Katie's room, and she dropped the bombshell that Craig, Johnny's biological father, was in with Katie. Alison led them to a different room until Craig made his exit. Alison went into Katie's room and urged Craig to be tested. Surprisingly, this time he agreed, and Alison led him away to get her test kit. The trio then went to see Katie, as Lucy said if Katie's tests were all good, the doctors could do the transplant right away. Katie expressed the desire to call Brad and tell him what she was doing, but Lucy was opposed to telling anyone else. Dusty supported Katie because he was aware that there were risks in any procedure. \n\n\nHenry was signing copies of his book, \"The Man from Oakdale,\" at the diner. Vienna went outside for a minute and found Casey peering in the window, watching Maddie, inside. Vienna dragged him in and led him to Maddie. The two teens felt awkward, and Maddie referred to herself as \"a loser.\" She maintained she knew what she heard coming from inside the hotel room on New Year's Eve, but Casey denied that anything happened between Alison and him. Maddie was not convinced and asked Casey to leave. \n\n\nHenry explained the plot of his book to a regular diner customer, Mr. Peacock, who needed to be persuaded to part with money to buy a copy. Henry said the story told what would happen if he and Vienna got hired to search for a young boy named Johnny whose older sister, Lucy, had kidnapped him to keep him from being the prize in a battle between his biological father, Craig, and his adoptive father, Dustin. Mr. Peacock passed on the book, but Vienna convinced him to stay for the reading, which included a free doughnut. Vienna asked the visitors to find seats because Henry was about to begin his reading. Henry suggested Vienna read it with him, and he introduced her to the crowd. Henry began reading, and Maddie slipped outside for some air. Casey followed her out and attempted to explain that he had been in bed by himself when Maddie had overheard voices. Maddie pressed him to tell her he didn't have a \"thing\" for someone else, but Casey said he was not sure. He apologized and told Maddie she deserved someone better. \n\n\nAlison led Craig down the stairs and then suddenly \"remembered\" she had left her blood kit at Java. She asked him to accompany her there, but Craig tried to back out. Alison tried to talk him out of his valid feeling that Alison and his sister were trying to keep something important from him. \n\n\nBack in the exam room, Brad burst in and demanded to know what was going on. Katie introduced him to Lucy and Johnny, and she explained their problem. The others stepped out so Brad and Katie could discuss her being a donor for Johnny, but Brad was much opposed. He could not understand why his wife would risk her life for a lowlife like Craig. Katie argued that it was not about Craig, it was about saving a boy, and she promised that nothing bad would happen to her. After all, she had survived donating part of her liver to her sister, Margo. Lucy came in and told them Dr. Reed was ready to begin Katie on the medications she must take for a day or two before the procedure. Suddenly, they heard Craig's voice in the corridor, so Brad ran interference. He offered to take Craig to lunch, telling him that it was Katie's request that the two of them get to know one another better. Craig demanded to know exactly what kind of procedure Katie was getting, and Brad bluffed that it was a \"womanly thing.\" Craig reluctantly agreed to the lunch, and the two of them left. \n\n\nAlison gave the all clear signal, and Katie asked Lucy one last time if she thought it was fair to keep Craig in the dark about Johnny's condition and whereabouts. Lucy replied that she had never been so sure of anything in her life. Lucy asked Alison to leave because she did not want her friend implicated if Dusty called the police as soon as the transplant was completed. The two of them hugged, and Lucy thanked Alison again. \n\n\nBrad and Craig went to the Lakeview for lunch and Craig appeared surprised that Brad could hold a civil conversation with him. Then Brad lowered the boom by calling his brother-in-law a \"bastard,\" and telling Craig he was never to go near Katie again. Brad promised to hunt him down if Craig ever pulled Katie into another one of his schemes. He issued yet another stern warning and walked out. \n\n\nLucy and Dusty waited while the doctor took Johnny to get him ready. Dusty asked Lucy how she managed to keep one step ahead of him, but she did not reveal her methods. Dusty said Johnny needed to be with his father, so Lucy begged that wherever Dusty was going, that she go, too. She argued that she loved the boy, and he needed a doctor with him. Lucy vowed she would rather never see Johnny again than let Craig have him. Dusty thought about that and then agreed, and Lucy gave him a big hug. \n\n\nThe doctor approached and agreed with Lucy's medical assessment of the boy, and they all concurred that the transplant must take place. Lucy told Dusty that Katie had to take her medications for a brief time and also have a few more tests before they could proceed. She suggested it might be safer to do the transplant in Chicago where there was less chance Craig could locate them. Dusty told Katie the change of plans, and she reiterated what she had said to Lucy: it was not fair to leave out Craig. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna finished their passionate reading from the book, and everyone was excited. Even Mr. Peacock came around and bought five copies. Henry asked Maddie where Casey was, and his sister told him that Casey was gone for good. Vienna became angry at how Casey had treated the girl. \n\n\nCasey found Alison on playground swings, and he asked her about the New Year's Eve scenario at the Lakeview. Alison promised she would tell him as soon as she could, and then she asked about Maddie. Casey told her Maddie had heard them in the hotel room, but that whatever relationship he had with Maddie was over. Alison said she was sorry, but Casey told her he was not. She scolded him for letting Maddie get away again and left to find her. She bumped into Maddie outside the diner and tried to explain that there was nothing serious between Casey and her. Maddie said that Casey disagreed, just as he walked up. Alison denied she had any relationship with him and then angrily asked Casey why he had told Maddie he had a \"thing\" for Alison. She accused him of using her to get rid of Maddie, and Casey agreed he should not have said that to Maddie. \n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, with a worn-out Johnny napping, Dusty received a phone call from Josie, and he promised to call her back in a few days. Lucy asked about his relationship with Josie, but Dusty was closemouthed. When Johnny woke up, Dusty told him that he, \"Lulu,\" and Johnny were going on a trip to Chicago. Johnny wanted to know why Dusty was going, and his father answered that it was to make things easier. \n\n\nKatie surprised Craig at the Lakeview and told him he was a psycho-menace, and she didn't know why she was telling him what she knew, because he certainly did not deserve it. Then she said she knew where Johnny was.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty continues to deal with the aftermath of seeing Johnny after so long and his son not being comfortable with him. Johnny goes to the hospital to be tested, as Katie is going through tests as well since she is going to be a donor for him. Craig can tell that Alison and Katie are keeping something from him since Katie is having some kind of procedure done that they won't tell him about. Alison keeps Craig busy when Dusty, Lucy and Johnny show up. Casey comes to see Maddie at Henry's book signing. They talk about what happened, as Casey apologizes and explains that nothing is going on with him and Alison. He thinks she is better off without him anyway, as Maddie is annoyed that he tells her that. Casey admits to having confused feelings for Alison though, which hurts Maddie. Katie tells Dusty and Lucy she has to let Brad in on her procedure. Lucy isn't comfortable with that, but Dusty convinces her that is only fair. Brad finds out about the procedure and is not on board, but Katie is able to make him understand why she needs to do this. Craig comes back to see Katie, as she sends Brad out to distract him this time. Brad takes Craig out to \u0091lunch', but while out, Brad orders Craig to stay out of Katie's life \u0096 or else. Henry does a reading form his book. Later, he finds out that Maddie and Casey are over \u0096 again and she is heading out of town. Lucy thinks Dusty may have her arrested, as she pleads with Dusty to do what is best for Johnny and take her along wherever he goes. Dusty reluctantly agrees, but when he hears the transplant won't happen for another few days, he wants them to do this in Chicago away from where Craig will find out. Katie wrestles with if keeping Johnny's condition from Craig is fair. Brad thinks that Craig deserves not to know anything though because he created all the pain in his life. Casey tells Alison that Maddie and he are through; she thinks she is the reason and that Casey is too chicken to tell Maddie that he really wants her around so she is determined to tell Maddie herself. Alison finds Maddie and tries to convince her to give Casey another shot, but Maddie tells her that Casey admitted to feelings for her, as Alison is stunned. Alison later confronts Casey about what he told Maddie and is convinced he used her to get rid of Maddie. Casey is afraid to admit the truth. Alison looks like she might want to hear that he is telling the truth about his feelings, but is afraid to hear it too so neither say anything and both leave feeling very awkward with one another. Lucy tells Dusty that Johnny knows all about and has seen photos of Jennifer, which makes him happy. Dusty and Lucy tell Johnny they are all going to Chicago together to make him better. Johnny reluctantly is comfortable with Dusty traveling with them now with Lucy's help. Katie goes to Craig still unsure as to why she feels compelled to have sympathy for him. Craig doesn't know what she is wrestling with to tell him, when Katie blurts out that she knows where Johnny is.",
