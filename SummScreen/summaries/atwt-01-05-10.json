    "soap_central": "\n\n \nKatie and Jacob found Henry and Simon asleep and very cozy on the couch the morning after the Twilight Zone marathon.  The men awakened when Katie coughed, and they jumped up, embarrassed.  Katie laughed and kidded them about man-cuddling on the couch.  Simon got ready to start his morning shift at the diner, but before he left, he asked Katie to dinner, and she accepted.  After Simon departed, Henry remarked that Simon had more in mind than just a thank-you dinner for Katie.\n\n\nHenry fed the baby his bottle and told Katie that he had seen the looks between her and Simon, but Katie denied any such glances.  She asked Henry to hurry up with Jacob so that she could get to WOAK to pitch a new show idea to Kim.  She said the show she had in mind involved new moms and would have a weekly broadcast with online help between episodes.  Henry got very serious and reminded Katie that she was not alone, and he recommended that she \"be open\" to Simon.\n\n\nKatie and Henry went to the television studio, which was deserted.  Katie said she wanted to tape an audition reel to show to Kim, and she asked Henry to run the camera for her.  She had a difficult time dealing with the memories of Brad in the studio, but she pulled herself together and asked Henry to start rolling.  Katie introduced herself to the audience, and said, \"I'm a mom.\" The taping went well, and Jacob awoke just as it ended.  Henry amused him by singing \"Git Along Little Dogie,\" and Katie thanked her best friend for always sticking by her.  The two of them had a heartfelt talk.\n\n\nAt work at the diner, Simon called Metro to make a dinner reservation, as a heckling customer gave him a hard time about lousy service.  Suddenly an overdressed beautiful woman walked in and called Simon by name.  She was Clarissa, a former associate in Simon's life of crime.  She said she had a fish on the line, and all they had to do was \"reel him in.\"   Simon said that he was done with that lifestyle.  A disappointed Clarissa left, and Simon realized that with so few customers, he would never make enough tip money to pay for a dinner at Metro.\n\n\nSimon canceled the reservation at Metro and called Katie, who was just finishing up at the studio. He invited her instead to go to the diner for a different kind of a meal.  Henry agreed to baby-sit  Jacob, so Katie agreed to the change.  She went to Al's and saw a \"Closed\" sign on the door.  Simon ushered her in, and she spied a romantic candlelit table just for two.  Her host explained that he had asked the chef to prepare a Shepherd's Pie made with \"organic shepherds,\" and a salad.  He also presented a bottle of wine with a great flourish.\n\n\nHenry wheeled Jacob in his stroller past the diner and peeked in the window.  He told the baby how happy his mother looked, and declared that when she was happy, they were happy.  Inside, Katie said that simple food was always the best, and the occasion reminded her of when she was married to Simon, and they were very poor but very happy.\n\n\nLily told Noah that her family wanted to support his decisions, but it was his life and his right to make the decisions.  Noah wanted to fight to regain his eyesight, and he said he thought he had a chance with a doctor he had heard of in Dallas.  His name was Reid Oliver, and Lucinda was familiar with his reputation.  She said he was something of a radical and on the \"cutting edge\" of medicine.  Noah wanted to visit Dr. Oliver's clinic as soon as possible, so Lily promised to fly him wherever he wanted to go.  Luke was disturbed that Noah might be leaving again, but he understood how important it was to his boyfriend.\n\n\nLucinda promised to check out the doctor and to talk to some of the patients he had helped.  Noah thanked them for their help, and Lily and Lucinda made a hasty exit in order to give the young men some privacy.  Luke attempted to kiss Noah, but Noah pulled away. He said he could not act as if things were just the same.  Noah confided that he had to think about himself and did not want to have \"us\" in every conversation with Luke.  Luke apologized, but Noah explained that he was trying to be proactive.\n\n\nThe lovers began to argue, but Noah could only concentrate on getting his sight back.  Everything else, he said, was secondary, even his relationship with Luke.  They walked outside, and Noah asked Luke to describe the snow-covered evergreens.  Then he spoke with regret about never finishing his film project.  Luke smiled and asked Noah to put his hand into his coat pocket.  Noah did, and he pulled out a statue that represented first prize in the student film festival at the university.  Noah was stunned that his film had won.\n\n\nNoah asked Luke if he had been the one to finish Noah's movie, and Luke told him how easy it had been because Noah was such an organized director.  He said the film had gotten a standing ovation at the festival, and Luke was very proud of Noah.  Noah became furious and accused Luke of taking over his work in order to control him.  Luke shouted at his lover that the awards were all for him, but Noah shoved the award into Luke's hands and went inside.  He sat on the couch for a while, and then he put the disc of the film into his laptop.\n\n\nOutside on the patio, a dejected Luke called the office of Dr. Reid Oliver and said he was representing a potential patient.\n\n\nLily and Lucinda went to lunch at the Lakeview, but Lily could not eat.  She was nauseated and light-headed, plus she felt exhausted.  Lucinda asked a couple of direct questions, and suddenly Lily was thunderstruck by the thought that she might be pregnant.  She grabbed her coat and, very upset, she decided to go right to the hospital for a blood test.\n\n\nHolden and Molly drove to Deerbrook to visit Meg.  Before they saw her, however, a nurse spoke with them and asked them to prepare for a shock when they saw Meg.  That worried Holden, who was concerned that his sister had sunk even lower.  He and Molly walked into Meg's room and found her knitting mittens for Eliza and in a very pleasant mood.  She said she had been living in a haze, but through therapy and soul-searching, she had turned it all around.\n\n\nMolly spoke to Meg about the request Meg had made when she had been admitted to the hospital.  She had asked Molly to use her investigative skills to check out whether or not Damian had known of the possibility that Holden was still alive when he began courting Lily.  Meg answered Molly's question by saying that her own paranoia had turned Damian into some sort of demon in her mind.  She said she had accepted her shortcomings and was working hard to regain her normal life.  The nurse delivered Meg's medication, and Meg asked Holden and Molly to return after she had finished her morning session with the doctor.\n\n\nOutside, Holden asked Molly if she thought Meg was \"faking it,\" and Molly said that the \"new Stepford version of Meg\" was nothing like any Meg they had seen before.  Molly was skeptical, but Holden was hopeful that the medication and therapy had stabilized his sister.\n\n\nIn Meg's room, the nurse gave Meg two tablets to swallow and watched her take them.  As soon as the nurse left, Meg removed the tablets from under her tongue and placed them in a plastic bag she then stashed under the mattress of her bed.  The bag was about a third full of similar pills.  Meg went to her therapy session with Dr. Wilson and complimented him and his staff.  She said that she needed his help to take the next giant leap; she wanted to see Damian Grimaldi in order to ask his forgiveness, and she wanted the doctor to make it happen.\n\n\nHolden and Molly returned to the farm, but Holden was worried that if Molly's instincts about Meg were correct, then his sister was really deranged.  Molly remembered Meg's request about Damian, and she felt something was a \"little off.\"  She wondered if there was more to Damian's story than they knew.  Holden told Molly that she had read Officer Grady's report and even talked to him on the phone, but Molly had a feeling of unease.  She wanted to go to Kentucky herself to see Grady, and Holden offered to accompany her.\n\n\nMolly went to Fashions and checked out the sexy lingerie.  She was afraid that the choices all screamed \"Desperate!\" so she passed on both of two filmy black ones, but then she changed her mind and chose one.  She glanced over and spotted Lucinda browsing through the maternity department, so Molly could not resist making a crack about the possibility of Lucinda's being pregnant.  Lucinda gave her the evil eye and reminded Molly that Emma Snyder had rules about conduct governing the house in which both Molly and Holden were living. Lucinda also reminded Molly that Holden and Lily always found their way back to each other.  Molly said Lucinda's idea was pass\u00e9, and paid for the negligee. Lucinda looked at it and asked if she was going to Vegas.\n\n\nLily worried and waited for her blood test at the hospital, when Holden walked by and saw her.  He asked why she was there, and Lily said she thought that she had a stomach bug.  They talked a bit about Luke and Noah, and Lily was obviously worried about them.  Holden said that he had plans to go out of town, but he was concerned that Lily seemed anxious.  He told her that he would only be gone overnight, and if she needed him, all she had to do was call.  The nurse appeared then and, assuming that Lily and Holden were husband and wife, she asked Lily to go into the exam room where she said they would take some blood and find out if she was pregnant.  Holden appeared stunned.\n\n\nAt Deerbrook, a hesitant Damian walked into Meg's room with her doctor.  Meg gave a flowery apology for her terrible words and actions towards Damian, but the doctor received a call and had to step outside to take it.  He asked Damian if he would be all right, but Damian had obviously relaxed at Meg's contrite words, and he assured the doctor it was fine.  Damian sat on the foot of Meg's bed and said he was amazed at the change in her demeanor.  Meg suddenly smiled and said, \"Alone at last,\" and then she explained how easy it had been to fool the doctors.  She smilingly promised Damian that the very first thing she would do when she was released was to kill him.\n\n\n",
