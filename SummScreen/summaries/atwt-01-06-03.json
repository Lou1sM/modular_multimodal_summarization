He has just found out that there is still a warrant for his arrest in Australia for assaulting a police officer.  Now the former police officer, \"Lock-'em-up Larry\" Carothers, is a judge, so Simon can never set foot in Australia again.  Katie urges Simon to take the trip anyway, but Simon answers angrily that he doesn't want to take a chance of being separated from Katie.  As soon as Simon leaves the house, Katie rushes to the telephone to call Tom Hughes for legal help.\n\n\nAt home, Lily advises Aaron to spend time with Lucy to let her get to know him all over again, rather than making a list of all their memories.  At the hospital, Lucy tells Alison that she is beginning to have memories about an argument she had with Alison.  Alison's explanation was that, although she had been angry,  Alison had forgiven Lucy for stealing something from her because they will always be \"best friends.\"  After Alison leaves, Lucy dejectedly looks at herself in a mirror, murmuring, \"Who are you?\"  She then sees a vision of an unhappy Aaron, and begins crying uncontrollably.  Alison sees her and worries that she is crying because she remembers what Alison told her before her accident.\n\n\nMike visits Rosanna in her hospital room where she is recuperating from surgery.  He brings her candy, comic books, a deck of cards, and ribbons for her hair.  Rosanna tells Mike that, although her relationship with Craig is not like her old relationship with Mike, she and Craig are great.  Molly bursts in just as Mike gives Rosanna a tender kiss on the cheek.  Molly angrily asks Rosanna why she bought the penthouse apartment Molly used to share with Jake.\n\n\nMargo brings Carly and Jack proof that a baby was stolen from a family named Cronister at a hospital in Arizona in September, and a tall, thin woman with dark hair was seen with a baby by hospital employees.  Margo and John insist that J. J. take a blood test immediately to compare with the blood of the Cronisters' missing baby.  Carly begs Jack not to give up hope, and they embrace.\n\n\nAlison finds Craig talking to Sierra and tells them that Lucy is crying.  Sierra rushes to Lucy, but Craig detains Alison. Craig tells Alison that he suspects that she lied when she told him that Lucy had sex with Aaron so that he would send Lucy back to Montega, so that Alison could get Aaron for herself.\n\n\nLucy begs Sierra to let her stay in Oakdale, and Sierra agrees.  Lucy then asks both Sierra and Craig to keep Aaron away from her for a while, because she doesn't want Aaron to feel sorry for her.  Just then, Aaron appears with a bouquet of flowers for Lucy, and Craig diverts Aaron by asking him questions about the road trip, quickly steering the questions toward the sleeping arrangements.  Aaron thanks Craig for being so nice to him as he leaves to go see Lucy.  Aaron arrives just as Lucy falls from her wheelchair.  She is humiliated at the thought that Aaron feels sorry for her.\n\n\nCraig meets Carly and Jack at the hospital and reminds Carly that if Rosanna invokes the \"Carly Clause,\"  Jack will think that Carly slept with Craig, and that their marriage will be damaged.\n\n\n",
