At the hospital, Kim approached Will and asked him if he would like to call his father. Will said it wouldn't do any good. Kim tried to tell Will that all people make mistakes and people change because of it. She believed that Will has changed and didn't have a mean bone in his body. Will replied that he wished his father would believe it too. Kim told Will that if it were true about Emily, Hal would need him and Will should be there for him. Will went to the police station and after hearing the argument between Hal and Paul, Will took and passed a polygraph test. Emily was later arrested.\n\n\n\n\n\nMike told Katie that he was in love with Jennifer but Katie said she didn't think Jennifer knew it. Katie apologized again and asked Mike not to be angry with her. He said he wasn't. Katie kept questioning him until he became agitated and told Katie that he didn't love her and he had moved on. Mike said he would never forget the good times they had and they hugged. Katie abruptly left. Mike called Jennifer and asked her to meet him where he professed his love for her. \n\n\nHenry told Jennifer that he would do anything for Katie and that he was in love with her. Jennifer asked if Katie knew. Henry said it wouldn't matter because it couldn't hold a candle to what Mike and Katie had. After Jennifer left, Katie appeared and told Henry what happened. Henry couldn't help but hide his enthusiasm and tried to convince Katie that she needed to let Mike go. Katie refused to believe that Mike was over her and started to devise another plan much to Henry's dismay. Henry told her that if Mike were using Jennifer then Katie should do the same and asked her to marry him!\n\n\nBen went to the hospital to talk to Bob about Aaron's arm.

She calls Alison, who is with Aaron getting Daniel's stuff at Emily's house, and tells her about the map. Alison eventually talks Aaron into burning it with her. Paul is insistent that Emily go to jail and after Will takes the polygraph test and passes, Emily is arrested. Katie tells Mike that she won't stop trying to get them back together, Mike telling her he's in love with Jennifer and that they are truly through. In the meantime, Henry makes a confession to Jennifer \u0096 that he's in love with Katie and always has been. He also tells Jennifer that Katie and Mike's love is one of a kind and she should probably settle to be Mike's friend, like he's done with Katie. Jennifer refuses and when Mike calls her to have her come over, she's sure he's going to dump her for Katie but instead Mike surprises her and tells her he loves her. When Katie meets up with Henry, he tells her that she should marry him \u0096 if Mike is only using Jennifer to push Katie away, he'll make sure she doesn't marry Henry.
