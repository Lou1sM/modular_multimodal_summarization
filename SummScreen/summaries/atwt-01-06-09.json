He didn't believe his sister and felt she was punishing him for his forcing her to provide him with an alibi in Paul Ryan's car bombing. Katie assured him she was telling him about Johnny only because he was the boy's biological father, not because she had warm sibling feelings towards him. She explained that Lucy and Johnny were in Oakdale, but that Dusty was planning on leaving with the boy soon. She told him Johnny was suffering a recurrence of the blood cancer he had experienced as an infant, and needed a bone marrow transplant. She said Dusty and Lucy had the boy in room 1020 at the hotel and were preparing to take him to Chicago for the procedure. Craig walked out immediately, not realizing he passed Dusty, who was sitting in the lobby. Dusty got up and asked Katie why she was talking to her brother, and she said she had told Craig that his son had a life-threatening illness. Dusty reprimanded her for compromising Johnny's safety, so an upset Katie called Brad and asked him to meet her right away. \n\n\nUpstairs in room 1020, Lucy and Johnny were packing and gathering up the boy's stuffed lion in preparation for a new adventure. Lucy answered a knock on the door, but instead of Dusty, whom she was expecting, there stood Craig. He called her his pet name, \"Lullaby,\" and asked about Johnny. He barged into the room and picked up Johnny. He was amazed at the boy's size as it had been two years since he had last seen him. Johnny did not remember his father, however. Dusty came in, and Craig insisted they begin the transplant immediately, right there at Memorial Hospital in Oakdale. Lucy agreed, since the need for secrecy was no longer pertinent. \n\n\nAt Lily's house, Luke came home and found Brian alone in the living room. Brian told him that he had precipitated the slugging incident by Noah with his initial actions towards Luke, and they shook hands and Brian declared them \"friends.\" Lucinda came in and picked up on the fact that something was going on between them. She demanded to know what they were hiding, but neither man spoke. Jade and Lily arrived home after a shopping spree, and Lucinda referred to Lily's generosity towards her niece as \"throwing good money after bad.\" Jade retaliated by blurting out that at least she did not have a gay husband! \n\n\nLuke attempted to hustle Jade out of the room, but Lucinda stopped them and insisted Jade repeat her remarks. When Jade did not cooperate, Lucinda wanted to know why the girl was mouthing off. Lily was totally confused and turned on Jade, asking why the she was attacking Brian. Lucinda lit into Luke who was still trying to get Jade out of there. Suddenly Brian put an end to all the clamor by shouting, \"Stop it!\" at them all. Lily called a time out, and Lucinda asked for a private conversation with Luke. Jade commented, \"Good luck with that,\" and she gathered her packages and went upstairs. Luke told his grandmother she should be talking to her husband instead of to him, and he went outside for some air, followed by a very puzzled Lily. \n\n\nLucinda turned to Brian, who began declaring his love for her and telling her that was all she needed to know. Lucinda disagreed, so Brian admitted he had made a pass a Luke, and Lucinda asked for clarification. Finally, Brian said he had kissed Luke and explained that he had experienced those feelings all his life, but he refused to label his behavior. He said he never meant to hurt her, but she answered that he had done exactly that. He apologized and hoped they could put it all behind them, but Lucinda called their marriage a lie. She lamented that all the time she was thinking of having sex with her husband, he was thinking of having sex with her grandson. She asked Brian if he was still attracted to Luke, and Brian answered truthfully and said yes. Lucinda told him to go upstairs, pack his things, and leave. \n\n\nKatie was in her hospital room waiting for the doctors to begin the transplant. Brad was with her and told her again how brave she was. Craig came in to thank her for what she was doing for Johnny, and he hinted that perhaps the event could be a new beginning for the two of them. Katie was not willing to consider that yet, and a nurse and an orderly arrived to take her for the transplant. Brad threatened Craig that if anything happened to his wife, Craig would pay. \n\n\nIn another hospital room, Dusty comforted Johnny by reading to him, and he told the boy he was a true champion. Craig came in and spoke to his son, wishing him well. Lucy was upset, and Craig asked to speak with her alone. Lucy agreed over Dusty's protests, and when the orderly took Johnny away, the two of them went to Java for coffee. Craig reminded his daughter that she had kept him away from his son for two years, and he assured her that he had changed during that time. He pleaded with her to take the time to get to know him again. Lucy said she still blamed him for the death of her brother, Bryant, but Craig promised to work with Dusty for the boy's good, and Lucy said she would at least try to give her father a chance-but she had to put the boy first. \n\n\nBrad waited through the procedure with Dusty and commented that the transplant was taking a long time. The two men talked about being fathers and found they had some things in common. Neither thought it had been wise for Katie to tell Craig that Johnny was in Oakdale, and Brad spilled the news that Craig had blackmailed Katie, but he did not elaborate. Dusty offered to help and suggested that he and Brad team up to stop Craig. Before that could happen, though, Dusty said Brad had to tell him the whole story about the blackmail. Brad then told him how Craig had hired Spencer McKay to set up Brad so that in the end, Katie would provide her brother with an alibi. Dusty said he would handle Craig himself and promised not to involve the police. \n\n\nLily asked Luke if what had just happened in her living room had anything to do with what had been eating at him since before Thanksgiving. Luke then explained how Brian had kissed him and then denied it. Lily was horrified, but Luke told her the truth about the incident on New Year's Eve and confessed he had been drinking and that he had kissed Brian. Lily was disappointed and worried that the boy had been drinking and told him he should have told someone about Brian. Luke said Lucinda was so happy in her new marriage that he couldn't bring himself to break her heart. He defended Brian as being a good person, but one very messed up in his sexuality. Lily felt badly for her mother. \n\n\nThe transplant concluded, and Katie came back to her room to rest. Brad went to get her some water, and Dusty came in to tell her she had done a great thing by participating. He asked her for one more favor, however. He said he knew she had given a false alibi for Craig, and Katie was shocked that he knew. Dusty wanted her to tell Margo the truth, and then the police would have to arrest Craig. He offered to protect Katie from any repercussions, but Katie was furious and told him he was obsessed with Craig. Dusty reminded her she was the one who had told Craig that Johnny was in town, and therefore she brought her brother back into the boy's life. It was up to her to get him out. \n\n\nBefore he left, Brian asked to say something to Lucinda. He said he still felt they belonged together and could make a marriage work in spite of what had happened, but Lucinda was not buying it, and she threw him out. Lily saw him leave and she came in to see her mother. Lucinda was full of self-blame for ignoring the signs she had seen. \n\n\nCraig wanted to make peace now that the transplant had taken place.. It appeared to Dusty that Craig and Lucy had reached some sort of accord, but when Craig went to check on Katie, Lucy told Dusty she still wanted the three of them to go away together so that her father could never find them. \n\n\nKatie told Craig that Dusty knew the truth about the phony alibi, so Craig calmed her by telling her he would talk to Dusty and make him see reason. Craig went back to the room where Dusty and Lucy were waiting and overheard their discussion about travel plans and passports. He heard Dusty say that he would make sure Craig never saw his son again. \n\n\nBrad returned with flowers for Katie, but she said she was on to him. She accused him of telling Dusty how Craig had set them up, but Brad said Dusty had promised never to tell. Katie got very upset and asked her husband to leave. \n\n\nCraig phoned Margo and told her Lucy had returned with his son, Johnny, and he wanted her to arrest Lucy immediately for kidnapping.\n\n\n",
