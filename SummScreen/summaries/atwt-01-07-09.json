She was desperate and wracked her brain to figure out how to get her hands on some money. \n\n\nJack and Janet enjoyed the sounds of silence at the farm. Janet could not wait until they had a home of their own, and Jack suggested he try again to get a second mortgage on Carly's house. \n\n\nCraig called Margo and informed her that Lucy and Johnny were at Memorial Hospital. He demanded that Margo go arrest his daughter for kidnapping. Margo warned him about traumatizing his son, but Craig responded that Johnny would get over it. In Johnny's hospital room, Dusty and Lucy talked as the boy slept. Dusty suggested Lucy go back to the hotel and take a shower and get some rest; she reluctantly agreed. In the hall, she ran into Craig, who questioned her about where she was going. Dusty came out of Johnny's room and offered Craig some alone time with his son. \n\n\nHenry visited Katie, by request of Brad. He asked her why she was in the hospital, and Katie replied that she had donated some bone marrow to a sick kid. Henry asked who the child was, and Katie told him it was Johnny. Henry was thrilled at the news, not only for the boy's sake, but also because of his recently published book, \"The Man from Oakdale.\" He gave Katie an inscribed copy and was gleeful that Johnny's return was a platform for good publicity. Craig popped in, and Henry tried to peddle one of his books to him. Craig reported that Johnny was doing fine and was in no pain. He thanked Katie again for her part in the procedure, and then he left. Henry told Katie he had a feeling that whatever was wrong between her and Brad had something to do with Craig. \n\n\nDusty caught up with Lucy on the street and told her he was worried about her. He cautioned her to watch herself, because he felt Craig was up to something. He was suspicious that Craig was after Lucy, so he suggested she not go to the Lakeview, but instead get herself to Metro where Derek Coburn would take her somewhere safe. After some thought, Lucy agreed, and she took off for Metro. Dusty called Derek to set up his plan, and then he returned to the hospital, where he found Josie waiting for him. Dusty asked for her help in keeping an eye on Craig. She was not pleased that Dusty was leaving to meet Lucy, but she agreed to watch Craig. \n\n\nJohnny woke up and asked for \"Lulu.\" Craig comforted the boy and explained that he was Lucy's daddy. He told the boy that he loved him and that no one would ever take him away again because he was home. Margo arrived, and Craig asked if she had arrested Lucy, but Margo said her niece was not at the Lakeview. She reminded her brother that she was not his private security force, and told him he could carry on his revenge without her. Craig said Lucy would return to wherever Johnny was, and he planned on filing charges against her when she showed up. Josie was standing nearby and overheard Craig tell Margo he expected her to \"throw the book\" at his daughter. \n\n\nJanet and Jack found Carly at home, and Jack told her the newlyweds wanted to buy a house, so he was planning on going back to the bank to secure a second mortgage on the home they had shared. Carly said she was sorry, but that was out of the question because she was hoping to take out another mortgage herself. Then she explained that the bank had called her loan on Metro, and she could not lose her business. Jack stepped out to take a call, and Carly apologized to Janet for needing the money out of the house for herself. Janet did not believe Carly was sincere and called her a lousy businesswoman. Carly began to lecture Janet on living on a policeman's salary, while Janet continued to rant that Carly needed to get over thinking she could still control Jack's life. Jack returned and tried to intervene, but Janet still had something to tell Carly. She said Carly did not really know Janet well and had no right to make judgments. Jack finally asked his ex-wife to make a choice: did she want to keep her family safe and provided for, or would she prefer to keep Janet and him from starting a life together? Carly gave up and said she would find her money elsewhere. \n\n\nDusty found Lucy in Metro's storeroom, and she was desperate for news of Johnny. Dusty assured her the boy would make it just fine, but Lucy was anxious and eager to return to Memorial to see Johnny for herself. Dusty took a call from Josie, who reported that Margo was at the hospital with Craig, and they were planning to arrest Lucy for kidnapping as soon as she appeared. Dusty told Lucy what her father was doing, and she berated herself for believing Craig's big talk about their all being family. Dusty cautioned her to leave town, but Lucy refused to abandon Johnny to save her own skin. \n\n\nDusty explained that the boy could not recuperate on the run, nor could Lucy stay around waiting for him to get better. He offered to help her get away, and said he would continue to look after and protect his son. Lucy agonized over her decision, torn between hating Craig and loving Johnny. Finally, she agreed to leave the boy in Dusty's care under two conditions. First, Dusty had to make peace with Craig and stop fighting, and second, she needed to see Johnny one more time before she left. Dusty called Josie and told her Lucy was going to leave town but wanted to see the boy for a moment; Josie thought the latter was a bad idea. She said Margo and Craig were watching the boy's room constantly. Dusty advised her to think of something creative to distract their attention, as seeing Johnny was the only way to make Lucy leave. Josie agreed to improvise. \n\n\nMargo comforted Katie, who was feeling uncomfortable after her bone marrow donation. She told Katie that Craig wanted Lucy arrested, and this upset her sister. Craig called Margo into the hall, and he had Josie by the arm. He told Margo he had found the girl lurking outside Johnny's room, and he believed Dusty was behind her behavior. Margo asked Josie if she knew where Dusty or Lucy was, and Josie surprised her by saying she did. \n\n\nMargo and another officer went to Metro's storeroom on Josie's directions, and soon Craig joined them. No one was there, but they discovered Lucy's coat. Back at Memorial, Dusty brought Lucy for her moment with Johnny. Dusty and Josie waited outside while Lucy told the boy to trust Dusty while she was away doing some \"grown-up things.\" Dusty came in to get Lucy, who gave the boy a tearful goodbye. Dusty said the Worldwide jet was waiting for her at the airport, and Lucy dashed out. \n\n\nCarly went to Metro and found Henry putting up posters promoting his book. She chewed him out for going AWOL on her for past few weeks and not pulling his weight at the club. She explained that she had no money and asked if he could contribute any. Henry fixed them both martinis, and they tried to figure out how to keep the business open. Henry suggested she fight for her business and then jokingly mentioned that she should find herself a sugar daddy. \n\n\nMargo and Craig returned to the hospital and asked Dusty where Lucy was. He told them Lucy was gone because the thought of going to prison did not appeal to her. Craig mouthed off, and Margo finally told him to zip it and let her do her job. Dusty tried to make peace with Craig, who resisted his advances. Instead, he ordered Margo to arrest Dusty and Josie for aiding a kidnapper. Katie came out of her room and implored her brother not to do that. She scolded Craig and vouched that Dusty would not spirit away Johnny. She begged them all to stop doing wrong things in the name of loving Johnny. Dusty made an overture to Craig, who stubbornly reminded him he had broken the law. Katie got woozy, so Margo and Craig helped her back to bed. Craig made a parting shot to Katie and Margo by vowing that Johnny was his son, and he would never let anyone take the boy away from him again. \n\n\nDusty went in to Johnny, who spotted Josie and again called her \"Mommy.\" Dusty showed the boy a picture of his real mommy, Jennifer, and explained that Josie was their good friend. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet and Jack brought in the real estate sections of the papers, prepared to look for a house. Jack, however, was less than enthusiastic. He was concerned about leaving Carly high and dry, but Janet reminded him it was time to draw a line in the sand and stand up to Carly. She told him they should not be glum but should be celebrating, and they began to make love on Emma's kitchen table.\n\n\n",
