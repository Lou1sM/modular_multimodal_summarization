In the mix, she also found a list of phone numbers for her, Paul, and Alison written on the back of some publicity for All Angels Church.  She grabbed her coat and ran out of Fairwinds.\n\n\nAt the church, Mick refused to apologize to Alison for putting Dr. Cantor in his place.  She asked why Mick had done that for her, and he replied that he felt he owed it to her for sticking with him when he had passed out in Old Town.  Alison requested that he not do her any more favors, but Mick reminded her that he was not always in control of his actions.  Alison asked if he was referring to the \"inner turmoil\" he had mentioned before, and Mick said he was.  She offered to help him figure out why he felt that way.\n\n\nMick said he felt as if two different people were fighting inside him.  He said he got so angry after hearing Dr. Cantor verbally abuse Alison that he had to do something.  Alison said that when she was fighting her demons, she never had anyone to talk to, but Mick did.  She offered to be that person for him, and then she left to return to the hospital.\n\n\nMick sat thinking in the belfry, and he heard someone climbing the stairs.  It was Emily, who said that she had found him by following her \"reporter's instinct.\"  She asked to do a story about him for the Intruder, but Mick said, \"Absolutely not.\"  He claimed his work was \"not ready to be talked about,\" so Emily took a different tack.  She asked why Mick had selected Oakdale to unveil his product, and he said that he had wanted to meet with Dr. Hughes at Memorial.  Unfortunately, the good doctor was not interested in Mick's serum.\n\n\nThen Emily switched the emphasis to Paul, but Mick reminded her that he had not even met Paul before Alison had introduced them.  He asked Emily what she really wanted to ask, but Emily thought it would be useful to \"clear the air\" of all the \"nasty rumors\" circulating about Mick.  Mick said that sounded more like an accusation, and he asked what Emily suspected.  Emily said she didn't think Mick was who he claimed to be.  \"You're right,\" said Mick, \"I'm not.\"  Emily handed over the portfolio of pictures and questioned his interest in her husband.\n\n\nMick said that Paul was financing his entire project, and only a fool would not want to know everything about his benefactor.  Emily said she did not consider childhood photos as \"research.\"  Then she asked if her treatments were bogus just so that Mick could get closer to Paul.  Mick promised that her injections would help her get pregnant and said that Paul was not yet ready to hear what Mick had to say.  Emily got furious and demanded to know the truth, or she swore she would pull the plug on his project immediately.  \"Allow me,\" said Mick, as he shined his blue light into Emily's eyes, and she swooned to the floor.\n\n\nPaul and Barbara went to her hotel room in the Lakeview, and Paul asked why they were talking about James Stenbeck as if he were alive, when they both knew he was dead.  Paul declared it a waste of time, and said that his father wouldn't know what \"remorse\" was without having to Google it first.  He declared that \"dead\" was enough closure for him, and he was tired of talking about it.  Barbara said that she knew James's death haunted Paul, and she asked how he would feel if there was something he could do to rectify that.  Paul told his mother that he was worried that her treatments from Mick were affecting her brain.\n\n\nPaul urged Barbara to \"let James go,\" and he stood up and said he knew that he had to make it up to Emily for accusing her of calling the cops on Meg.  Barbara reminded him of their dinner that evening with Mick, but Paul said he had to bail on that.  Barbara decided not to argue with him, and she left for an oncology checkup at Memorial.\n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds and saw Emily slouched on the couch.  He began apologizing for his behavior and began to unwrap a present he had bought, but he got no response from his wife.  He went to Emily and saw that her eyes were open, but she showed no reactions.  He touched her, and Emily slid down the cushions.  Paul finally realized that something was terribly wrong, so he scooped up his wife and carried her out.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Barbara ran into Alison, who asked her if Mick seemed \"all right\" to her.  Barbara said that sometimes people had \"off days,\" but Alison commented that, at times, Mick appeared \"very conflicted.\"  Barbara got a bit haughty and told Alison that the girl's brief exposure to Mick hardly qualified her to an opinion, but Alison said she had shared several meaningful conversations with him lately.  Barbara got very defensive and she asked exactly what Alison's interest in Mick Dante was.  The she brought up Alison's recent engagement to Casey Hughes and asked if her fianc\u00e9 would like it that she had taken an \"obsessive interest\" in another man.\n\n\nAlison took offense at Barbara's effrontery and told the woman she was acting \"like a jealous lover.\"  She further said that she did not have to defend her friendships to Barbara or anyone else.  Paul suddenly appeared in the corridor and was carrying an unconscious Emily, so Alison directed him to an empty room.  A doctor entered and pushed Paul aside and then asked him and Alison to leave while he examined the patient.  In the hall, Barbara asked how Emily was, but all Alison could tell them was that she was getting the best care possible.\n\n\nAt home, Carly told Jack that she felt thing were \"getting too comfortable\" with his living there.  She urged him to decide what he wanted to do next and to get on with it.  She was fearful that the kids would get the wrong idea if Jack stayed there indefinitely.  Jack agreed with Carly and admitted that it was time for him to get his \"butt in gear.\"  A very excited Sage burst into the living room, shouting that she was Oakdale's \"Miss Snowflake\" and was to compete in the semi-finals of a pageant.  Carly and Jack had no idea that Sage was even interested in pageant competition, so they were dumbfounded.\n\n\nSage said that she had to be in Detroit the next day to compete, and, according to the rules, both her parents had to be there, as well.  She said the pageant meant a lot to her, but Jack was suspicious that the girl was manipulating a trip to throw her parents together.  He asked Sage a few questions, but Sage got upset and ran crying to her room.  Carly agreed with Jack's assessment that it was all about the trip and not the competition.  Jack walked out and said it was time for him to reenter the world.\n\n\nSage pestered Parker about the trip to Detroit.  She said she wanted him to help her persuade their folks to take her.  She was positive it would convince Jack and Carly that they belonged together. Parker refused to help and told Sage to give it up.\n\n\nCarly followed Jack to a field out in the country where he had lined up some old bottles.  He was standing and staring at them when Carly approached, and he explained that he was there to do some target practice because Margo was holding his old job for him at the Oakdale Police Department.  Jack took out his pistol, but he was disturbed by images of Brad as he fired.  His aim was way off, and he cringed every time he heard the shot.  Carly told Jack to trust his instincts and his skills would return.  She also suggested that he forgive himself for what had been a tragic accident.\n\n\nJack's next shot shattered the target, and then he never missed one.  He left one bottle standing, and Carly asked to take a shot.  Jack stood close to her and helped her steady her hand.  Carly was affected by Jack's closeness, and she stepped away and said that was a bad idea.  She told him that he had made a good first step, but it would be best if he lived someplace other than her house.  She said she needed to address her other addiction: Jack.  She kissed him on the cheek and walked away.\n\n\nJanet bumped into Dusty on her way into Metro, and the situation was awkward.  Janet hoped that they could get by what had happened on New Year's Eve, and they began working together behind the bar.  Dusty said that Janet was being too hard on herself and suggested that she learn to live with what they had done.  They both agreed that their lovemaking had been wonderful, but Janet said that didn't make it right.  They agreed to drop the subject, and Janet said she needed some time to keep an appointment at the farm.\n\n\nFather Farley, Janet's priest, arrived at the farm, and she told him that she had broken her marriage vows and cheated on her husband.  The priest said that the first step of forgiveness was to forgive oneself.  After he left, Janet put on her coat to return to Metro when Jack and Carly walked in.  Carly excused herself and left, but Jack wanted to talk.  Janet told him her news first; she had talked to Father Farley about an annulment.  Jack was shocked and angry that his wife was considering \"erasing\" their marriage.  Janet shouted that she had done worse than that.\n\n\nJack calmed down and said he had returned to work things out with her, but Janet informed him that she was moving out.  Jack asked her not to pursue the annulment until they had talked further.  Jack took a call from Carly saying that Sage had been crying all afternoon, and she asked Jack to return.  Janet rolled her eyes, and Jack left.  He got to Carly's, and she told him that Parker had informed her that Sage was hurt because she thought that her parents had \"made fun of her.\"  Sage walked in and manipulated her parents by getting them to substitute a road trip for a guilt trip.  Finally Carly and Jack agreed to \"take a family road trip to Detroit.\"  Parker tried to weasel out of going, but Carly said to pack his bag..\n\n\nAt All Angels Church, Mick Dante struggled once more with a serious nosebleed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara tries to see if Paul would forgive James if he were alive but Paul is happy that James is dead and he doesn't have to even consider forgiving him.
