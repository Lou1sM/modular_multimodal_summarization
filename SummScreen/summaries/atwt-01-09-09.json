Josie told her that Johnny was right across the hall, and that Dusty was with him. Barbara rushed into the room and was taken aback to see Johnny lying there. She told him he looked just like his mother, but Dusty told Barbara that Johnny didn't remember them. Barbara turned on Dusty, asking how he could have been so cruel as to keep her grandson from her. Dusty escorted Barbara out of the room, telling her she was scaring Johnny. In the hallway, he explained what had happened and said he had planned to let Barbara know later that day. \n\n\nDusty offered to take Barbara to get some coffee, and he went inside Johnny's room to let him know he'd be back soon. Josie agreed to watch Johnny for Dusty, but then Barbara worried about leaving Paul alone. Josie said she would keep an ear out for Paul, too, and Barbara thanked her. When Dusty came out of Johnny's room, he left with Barbara. Almost immediately, Josie heard Paul calling for his mom. Josie went to his room to see if he was okay. Paul told her she must be happy to have Johnny back, and he asked if he could see Johnny. Josie said that wasn't up to her, but Paul said she was Johnny's mother, so if she wouldn't let him see his nephew, it must mean she hadn't forgiven him yet. He begged her to let him see Johnny. Josie felt bad for Paul and led him across the hall to Johnny's room. When he told Johnny, \"Your mom said I could come say hi,\" Johnny answered, \"She's not my mom. She just looks like her.\" \n\n\nJosie led Paul out of the room as he asked her why Johnny would say something like that. Josie told him it was true, that she wasn't Jennifer and that Paul had hired her to pretend to be his sister. Paul asked where Jennifer was, and Josie gently told him that Jennifer had died. She told Paul to lie down while she went to check on Johnny. \n\n\nAfter Josie left his room, Paul got up and left the hospital, still wearing his pajamas and robe. Meanwhile, Barbara and Dusty returned from having coffee, and Barbara saw that Paul wasn't there. The nurse didn't know where Paul could be. Josie came out and asked what was going on. Barbara asked if Josie had said something to Paul, but Dusty insisted Josie hadn't been anywhere near Paul. Josie offered to help Barbara look for Paul, but Dusty told her not to. \n\n\nAfter Dusty went back into Johnny's room, Josie left the hospital. She went to the cemetery and found Paul kneeling by Jennifer's grave. Josie told Paul again that he had hired her to pretend to be Jennifer. She reminded him that they'd had training sessions, during which he would tell her about Dusty and Jennifer, and she remembered Paul had said that whenever Dusty was upset, he went to Jennifer for comfort. Paul told Josie she could comfort him, and she said perhaps she could, but she wasn't Jennifer. She asked Paul to let her take him back to the hospital, but he said he needed to stay so Jennifer could tell him what to do. Josie reminded Paul that Jennifer had forgiven him and had wanted him to be happy. She pointed out that he still had a mother and a brother who loved him, and he was a father to a little girl. Josie said all of those people needed Paul. \n\n\nJosie was able to lead Paul back to the hospital. Barbara was much relieved to see him and thanked Josie for finding him. She took Paul back to his room, and Dusty asked how Josie had found Paul. She told him Paul had been talking about Jennifer, so she had guessed he might go to Jennifer's grave. She then had to admit that she had been talking to Paul and had let Paul see Johnny. Dusty was furious, but Josie told him Paul would never hurt Johnny, and that she felt sorry not only for Dusty but also for Barbara, Paul, and Johnny. Josie told Dusty that she couldn't take his mood swings with regard to her, and she couldn't live according to his \"minute-by-minute approval rating.\" She told him one cold winter's night, he would realize he missed her, and then she walked out of the hospital. \n\n\nLater, Dusty found Josie at Java and apologized for having been so hard on her. He said he had been fighting for his son for so long, he didn't know how to stop. Josie told him maybe she could help him remember. \n\n\nAt home, Parker asked Carly for an advance on his allowance, but Carly told him her finances wouldn't allow it. Parker volunteered to go to Metro before it opened for business and do some chores that Carly was planning to do, like vacuuming and mopping. Carly told Parker she would give him $20 if he did everything she asked. He left, but first, he stopped and picked up Liberty. He told her that before they could go to the movies, he had some work to do, and he wanted her to go with him. When he told her where he was going, Liberty agreed to accompany him. \n\n\nJack went to the diner and told Janet that he'd been approved for the second mortgage. All he needed was Carly's signature on the loan papers. Jack went to Carly's and asked for her signature. Before she signed the papers, Jack noticed Craig's check sticking out from the pile of papers Carly was working on. Jack read Carly the riot act about Craig and said Craig would try to use the loan to worm his way into Carly's life and the kids' lives. Carly said Jack was so quick to assume that Craig would use the kids to get to her because that was what Jack was doing. She said whenever she did something Jack didn't approve of, Jack would tell her it was bad for the kids, but in reality, Jack was just trying to control her. \n\n\nCarly then said she would find another way to pay off her loan, and she would start by taking half of the money from the second mortgage Jack had just gotten. Jack said neither of them could get what they wanted with just half of that money. Carly agreed and said that because she wanted Jack to be happy, she would stick to their agreement and sign the paperwork for him to get the second mortgage. She handed the papers to Jack and told him, \"Go get your new wife a new house and leave me alone.\" \n\n\nAfter Jack left the diner, Craig came in and sat down to order, telling Janet he hadn't realized she was a waitress there and not a chef. Janet was unfriendly, and when Craig asked why, she told him it was because he had loaned his car to Parker, who had then gone out on the icy roads with her daughter in the car with him. Craig said he had already apologized to both Jack and Carly. Janet asked why Craig had loaned Parker his car in the first place, and Craig said because Parker was his friend. Janet questioned the age range of Craig's friends, and he responded that most people his age didn't want anything to do with him, but if Janet wanted to, she could be his grown-up friend. Janet declined. \n\n\nA customer at the counter began gesturing wildly, and Craig told Janet he thought the customer was trying to get her attention. Janet realized the young man was choking. Craig quickly walked over to the man and performed the Heimlich maneuver. After the man had recovered, he left the diner, leaving Janet a dollar bill as a tip. Janet told Craig she didn't mind the meager tip as long as the man hadn't died on her shift. She admitted she wasn't sure she could perform the Heimlich maneuver despite having studied the posters the diner had up in the kitchen. Craig spotted Jack outside the diner and immediately offered to demonstrate the maneuver for Janet. He put his arms around her waist and showed her how his hands were positioned, then pulled up. Jack walked in and saw Craig from behind and told him to get his hands off of Janet. \n\n\nJanet explained to Jack what had happened, and Craig thanked Janet for her excellent service and left the diner. Jack told Janet about Craig's loan to Carly. Janet said maybe Carly would take Craig's money and make a huge success of Metro and then dump him. She didn't understand why Jack was so upset, since he was divorced from Carly. Janet told Jack that he had set a good example for his kids, and nothing Craig could do would undo that. Jack told her he didn't like the fact that the kids were at Carly's so much, where he had no idea what was going on with them. Janet said soon they would have their own place that was big enough for the kids, and then Jack could have plenty of time with them. Jack left excitedly to go to the bank to process the loan papers. \n\n\nAfter Craig left the diner, he called Carly, asking if they could talk. Carly hung up on him, so Craig decided to see if she was at Metro. At Metro, Parker had trouble assembling the pieces of the vacuum. Liberty had to show him how to put it together, and in appreciation, he kissed her. They continued kissing but were surprised by a noise at the front door. They hid behind the bar as Craig walked in, having let himself in with the key he still had. Craig called out for Carly, and when she didn't answer, he walked behind the bar and found Parker and Liberty. They jumped up, with Liberty trying to quickly button her sweater. Craig asked Parker if he had broken into Metro, and Parker told him why they were there. Parker asked Craig not to say anything about Liberty being there. At that moment, they heard Carly calling out to a deliveryman. Craig saw the panic on Liberty and Parker's faces. He took Liberty by the arm and rushed her out the back door of Metro right before Carly came in the front door. \n\n\nWhen Parker finished his work at the club, Craig walked in again. Carly made a snide comment to Craig, but Craig basically ignored it and asked Parker how he was doing. Parker said he was fine, then he told his mom that he was finished and was ready to go. Carly gave him the $20 she had promised him, and Parker left. \n\n\nLiberty went to see her mom at the diner, and Janet immediately noticed that the buttons on Liberty's sweater weren't buttoned correctly. She sent Liberty to the bathroom to fix it, warning her that she had some explaining to do. When Liberty returned, Janet asked where she'd been earlier. Before Liberty could answer, Parker walked in and asked if Liberty wanted to go to a movie. Liberty said yes and looked at her mom. Janet told Liberty to go straight home after the movie, then she told her that she trusted her and expected Liberty to make good choices. Liberty agreed and went outside with Parker. They agreed that they had come very close to getting into trouble, and Parker promised Liberty that next time, they would make sure they wouldn't be caught. \n\n\nCraig asked Carly if she had cashed his check yet; she took it out and showed it to him. He assumed that she had let Jack talk her out of it, because Jack had always been her guiding force. Carly denied it, but Craig said he thought Carly couldn't stop trying to live up to Jack's expectations. He told her to make Jack happy by tearing up the check, but instead, Carly folded it in half and stuffed it in her bra. \n\n\nCraig said they should discuss the terms of his loan. Carly reminded him that he had said there would be no strings attached. Craig agreed, but said there were two things he wanted. First, he wanted a \"thank you\" from Carly. Carly said there were many ways a woman could say thank you, but Craig said he just wanted the two words. Carly told him thanks, and Craig said Carly was efficient, using one word instead of two. Carly said, \"Bye-bye,\" and pointed out that was two words. Craig got up to leave, but Carly asked what the second thing was. Craig stopped and said, \"I've got my son back.\" Carly said she knew that. Craig said it had just hit him that he would get to see his son grow up, after all, and asked, \"Isn't that wonderful?\" Carly agreed that it was, and Craig said, \"I've been wanting to say that to someone all day. Thank you,\" and he left. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jack tells Carly that he got the mortgage. He's terribly upset when he spies the $200,000 check that Carly accepted from Craig. He's afraid Craig will take this as an invitation to move in and take over. She tells him that is not so; Jack just wants to control her. Craig feels the hostility from Janet when ordering at the diner. He tells her that in the future not to sugar-coat it, just tell him what she thinks. She thanks him later when he's able to do the Heimlich maneuver on a young customer. Trouble is Jack walks in just as Craig is demonstrating it to Janet and Jack warns him to take his hands off his wife!

Josie asks him to go back to his room and for him to try to get some rest. Barbara finds Paul missing and insists that Josie tell him where he is. She was watching him. Dusty won't let Barbara talk to Josie this way. She is not Paul's keeper. Craig finds Parker and Liberty hiding behind the counter at Metro. He promises not to get them in trouble with Carly. Janet promises Jack that Craig will never put his hands on her again. And she thinks Carly can figure that out too without Jack's constant disapproval. Josie finds Paul at Jennifer's grave. She knows that on some level that he knows that Josie is not Jennifer as he came here to say goodbye to Jennifer. She talks him into going back to the hospital. Carly politely tells Craig that she hung up on him; she does not want to talk to him. He brings up the check and why she hasn't cashed it yet. Perhaps Jack disapproved so go ahead and make him happy ... tear the check up. She stashes it away on her person and assures him again that she is not talking to him. Janet assuages Jack that they will buy a house and fill it always with huge chunks of time with his kids. Dusty is not happy to hear from Josie that she did take Paul in to see Johnny and then found him at Jennifer's grave. He storms that she had no right to bring that man in to see his son. He doesn't want him within ten feet of his son ever! She claims she can not live her life living for Dusty's constant approval. She vows that on some cold wintry night, he's going to miss her. Count on it! He follows. He won't let her walk out of his life. He's grateful that he has Johnny because of her. Gratitude \u0096 just what she wanted to hear. Craig tells Carly there are no strings attached to the check. She can just say thank you. He's found his son and he's actually going to see him grow up. That's wonderful and he's been wanting to tell someone all day. He thanks Carly for that opportunity.",
