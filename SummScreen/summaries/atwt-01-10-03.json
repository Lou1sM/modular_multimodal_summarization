Jack closes the door, turns around, and asks Carly, \"What is going on with you?  Why wouldn't you let me tell them about our baby?  Do we have to keep this secret from everyone?\"  Carly tells him she's not through the first trimester and it might not be successful, so she doesn't want to tell anyone right now.
