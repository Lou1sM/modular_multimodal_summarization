She seems to have some second thoughts, but when Henry arrives he gets down on bended knee and offers her an enormous diamond engagement ring.  What's a better way to drive Mike crazy, Henry suggests, than to wear a big rock?  That convinces her to accept it.  Meanwhile, Mike and Jennifer are in bed at his home enjoying the afterglow of their first night together.  Jennifer reads in the newspaper about Katie's engagement and asks Mike if he's ready for the comedy section, but Mike thinks it looks real.  When Mike and Jennifer go to get lunch, they run into Katie and Henry, who look to be celebrating their engagement.  Mike and Jennifer both seem suspicious -- and when Mike talks to Katie alone, he asks her, \"What's up with this? How far will you go to get under my skin?\"\n\n\nKim has gone to Fairwinds to chat with Rosanna and Paul about Will.  They are very concerned about him and ask what they can do to help.  Kim tells them that Will has told her that he never wants to see either of them again, let alone move back to Fairwinds.  Paul is understandably angry about Emily's actions, but Kim is confused.  She tells them how sick Emily was the last time she saw her, and how she didn't think she should drive herself to the doctor's office.  Paul wants to get to the bottom of this, but when he goes to see Emily in her cell, he still accuses her of the crimes.  Emily says she doesn't understand her actions, that they have no connection to reality at all for her.  Paul is indignant when Emily tells him his mother was very helpful during her illness, that she even made tea for her every day... Rosanna tries to talk to Will at Al's Diner, but while he is cordial, he seems uncomfortable.  But when Rosanna presents him with a brand new car, he seems surprised and confused!\n\n\nCarly suggests to Jack that he take JJ on a camping trip so that they can spend time together without Julia.  Jack loves the idea, and Carly convinces him it would also be good to invite Holden and Luke.  Jack is thrilled and thanks his wife for her \"great idea\" as he leaves to talk with Holden.  Carly is pleased that her plan is coming together.  But things aren't going so well for Lily, for as she tries to talk to Holden about Luke, Julia walks into the Snyder kitchen and instantly accuses Lily of telling Holden \"her\" side of the story about the money Lily offered.  Of course, Lily was not talking about the \"offer\" but Holden was furious with her when Julia told him what Lily had done.  Lily was disgusted with Holden when he believed Julia's version of the story without question.  When Holden told her that he would call her later about Luke, Lily told him not to bother -- that it was obvious he had already made his choice in families!\n\n\nMoments later, Holden and Julia hold hands across the kitchen table as Julia tells him that there is no amount of money that would make her leave Oakdale now, making sure he understands that it is because of him.  Jack barges in on the scene and seems surprised to see their intimacy, but asks Julia if JJ can join on the camping trip.  Julia says no.  Holden encourages her to allow JJ to go, and Jack asks Holden if he and Luke would like to join them.  Realizing that it would be a great time for them all to be together, Holden agrees and Julia changes her mind.  Jack calls Carly on her cell phone to tell her the trip is on.  She is waiting for his call at Al's Diner with Lily, and the two of them are relieved to hear that both Jack and Holden will be out of town for awhile...\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, Emily tells Alison she can remember committing the acts, but doesn't know why she did them. Over at Fairwinds, Alison tells Rosanna and Paul that Emily shouldn't be blamed for something she doesn't remember doing.",

Kim visits Fairwinds spurring Paul to talk with Emily and Roseanna to do something wonderful for Will. Paul begins to believe Emily about her condition when she perpetrated the crimes at Fairwinds, especially when she pleads with him to ask Barbara about how sick she was. Roseanna makes a small inroad with Will and a much larger one when she presents him with a new car. Katie accepts a gorgeous diamond from Henry and her rouse garners Mike's attention.",
