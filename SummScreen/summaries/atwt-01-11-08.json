Jack stops by with the kids, and once again, Parker is rude to Carly, so Jack pulls him aside and tells him that Carly would walk through fire for him, and he needs to give her a break. He tells Carly he's got to go to the station for a little while and is leaving the kids with her. Sam entertains Sage and JJ with Cowboy Jack, magic tricks, card games, and his guitar, even teaching JJ to play a chord, while Carly sits and talks to Parker. He tells her there's something creepy about Sam, and it's not just the dummy. \n\n\nAt the station, Jack talks to Margo, telling her he was tough on Parker, but she tells him not to worry about that, that he needs it. Parker calls and asks Jack when he's coming back to pick them up, saying, \"Dad, I hate it here.\" Jack says he'll be right there. He asks Margo if there was anything in what she saw of Sam's record that was alarming, but she says no, just annoying. He's worried he and Parker are overreacting to Sam because of Simon Frasier. As Jack leaves, Tom comes into the station and tells Margo that he got a call from the Department of Corrections saying they're having a hearing about an early release for Casey. He's upset that Casey didn't mention this to them, but Margo defends Casey. Tom tells her she needs to stop feeling so guilty because Casey senses that and uses it to his advantage. Margo finally admits she's scared of what will happen when Casey does come home, and Tom says he is, too.\n\n\nBack at Metro, Parker watches as Sam teaches Sage and JJ how to play poker. He also watches as Carly takes a wad of cash and puts it in the money box on the bar. Carly sits down with Parker to talk some more. Jack returns, and Carly asks him if she and Parker can have more alone time some time, and Jack agrees. As the kids get ready to leave, Sage watches as Parker leaves one of his books behind on purpose. After the kids leave with Jack to go to the diner to eat, Sam asks Carly to let him know if he's coming on too strong with Sage and JJ, because it seems like the more they get along, the more it bothers Parker. Carly tells him not to worry about Parker but says maybe he needs to step back a bit overall, and Sam says he figures she means that he's coming on too strong with her. She says he wouldn't want to get involved with someone whose life is as chaotic as hers is, and then she leaves. Sam picks up the dummy, who tells him he wishes he could switch places and take over for once so that things would go right. Parker comes in to retrieve his book in time to hear some of this \"conversation,\" although when Sam sees him and tells him he was practicing some new material, Parker says he didn't hear any of it. Carly comes back into the room and Sam leaves to go for a walk. Parker tells Carly that Sam was talking to his dummy about her and says again how creepy he thinks Sam is. Carly tells him that she thinks Sam's a nice guy who's lonely and longing for a family, and she says she's already spoken to him a little about backing off a bit. She tells Parker it's her problem, not his, and she'll handle it on her own. Then she tells Parker how glad she is that they're talking again and that she'd like to do it more often; he agrees. She gets a phone call and has to leave to go to her office for a minute; with no one around, Parker goes to the money box and takes all the money out of it. He stuffs the money in his backpack and picks up one of Sam's magic props and puts it in the empty money box, then leaves. Back at the diner, he tells Jack that he and his mom talked, and he doesn't think Sam will be a problem for much longer. Meanwhile, Sam returns to Metro, and Carly asks him to go run an errand, but when she opens the money box to give him some cash, she tells him she thinks they've been robbed.\n\n\nAt the farm, Holden is holding a shotgun on Craig as Craig tells Meg the only thing that matters is her. Holden steps outside and fires the rifle, coming back in to tell Craig that now he knows for sure the gun is loaded. Meg tells Craig that thinking about and trying to kill her unborn baby was disgusting, and nothing he can say can ever make her forgive him for that, even though he didn't go through with it. She says the only kids he cares about are the ones he's fathered, and she never wants to see him again. He leaves, saying, \"I am sorry.\" Holden comforts Meg, telling her he can't wait to meet her baby, because he has such a great mom. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Paul waits in the lobby for Craig to return. When he sees him, Paul follows him to his suite and breaks down the door. After Paul lays into Craig about trying to kill his baby, Craig tells Paul nothing he says or does can hurt him more than Meg just did by saying she never wanted to see him again, and he tells Paul his opinion of him is meaningless. When Paul says he'll make sure Craig pays for what he did, Craig yells back that Paul can't take the moral high ground and lecture him, because \"you are not better than me. You and I, we're the same!\" Paul throws a punch and knocks Craig down. After Craig takes care of his injury, he asks Paul why he's still there, saying, \"You think I'm bad, I know you're an idiot --- I don't find our conversations productive.\" Paul threatens to kill Craig if he goes near Meg or their child, and Craig points out that that's Paul's style. He tells Paul he thinks he's scared of what he and Meg had together, saying they were happy, and that's why Paul doesn't want him to go after Meg, \"but what happens when she comes after me?\" Paul again attacks Craig, and Meg walks in and tells them to stop. She tries to get Paul to leave, but Craig tells her about Paul's threats and says Paul went after him because he told him they were exactly the same. He tells Meg she deserves better than either of them. He says she knows Paul can't control himself and that he resorts to violence; he points out that Paul let her marry him (Craig), which Craig never would have done, and then dropped her when she didn't grieve long enough to suit him when she thought he was dead, and that he didn't try to get her back until he found out the baby was his. Craig says she knows Paul can't change, but that he did change, because of her, because he loved her, and that's the difference between him and Paul, and she loved him for it. He tells Meg, \"Do not listen to what the man says; look at what he does. You're better off alone!\" Meg says they're leaving now, and as they do, Craig can't resist one last barb at Paul, telling him, \"You will screw this up; you're not man enough for her.\" Paul turns and attacks Craig again, and as Meg walks up behind him and tells him to let Craig go, Paul forcefully shakes her off, hitting her in the process and knocking her down. When the paramedics arrive, Meg asks one of them to keep Craig and Paul away from her. At the hospital, with Holden beside her, Meg tells the doctor that she fell and then started bleeding. Holden leaves so the doctor can examine Meg, and Paul and Craig pounce on him trying to find out what's going on. Holden tells them that Meg told him what happened, saying they both did this to her. The doctor comes out and pulls Holden aside; after they speak, Holden goes into Meg's room, where she hugs him, sobbing. Craig asks the doctor if his wife will be okay, and the doctor says physically yes, but emotionally, it will take some time. Craig asks if he can do anything to help, but the doctor says, \"I think the 2 of you have done enough.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
