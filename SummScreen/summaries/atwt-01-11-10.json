    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt the diner, Simon picked up a fifty-cent tip from a disgruntled patron, as Clarissa walked in and advised her old partner in crime not to \"spend it all in one place.\"  Simon said he was still not interested in closing a two-year deal that they had worked together.  He suggested that Clarissa get someone else to take his place since the \"mark\" had never actually met Simon.  He said he would not participate because if he did, he would have to leave town for a very long time, and he wasn't willing to do that.\n\n\nSimon said he wanted to build a life in Oakdale, but Clarissa suggested that he had lost his mind, and she was willing to give him time to reconsider.  She dropped a stack of money on a table, and after a brief internal struggle, Simon pocketed it.\n\n\nKatie and Henry strolled Jacob through Old Town, and she said that Kim had returned from her cruise and was looking forward to watching Katie's video.  Henry hugged his best friend, as Katie looked over his shoulder into the diner and saw Simon chatting with Clarissa.  She asked Henry who the woman was, and he thought she was \"just a customer.\"  Katie suddenly decided it was time to take her sleeping baby home for his nap.\n\n\nNot long afterward, an impatient Simon rang Katie's doorbell over and over.  She ran to answer it and cautioned him not to wake the baby.  Simon declared that he wanted to take Katie out, perhaps to Chicago, because he had just gotten \"a big tip.\"  Katie asked about the woman she had seen through the window in the diner, and Simon said that he had formerly been in business with her.  \n\n\nKatie acted jealous, so Simon explained that he had been involved with Clarissa a long time before when they had run \"some sophisticated cons\" together.  He vowed he was through with that life and would be whatever Katie wanted him to be.  He expressed a desire to stay in Oakdale, no matter where their personal situation led. Simon kissed Katie.\n\n\nHenry walked in the diner and approached Clarissa, who was mangling a cheeseburger.  He introduced himself and asked her how long she had known Simon.  When Clarissa pretended not to know any \"Simon,\" Henry said that running the diner was just a sideline for him; his regular profession was gambling.  He guessed correctly that Simon had turned Clarissa down for a job, and he stated that he thought he could make her visit to Oakdale worthwhile.  Clarissa said her work was \"highly specialized,\" so Henry suggested that they both put their \"cards on the table.\"\n\n\nHenry went first and said that he was willing to bend the law if Simon had changed his ways.  Clarissa picked up her purse and turned Henry down.  Then Henry asked hypothetically if there was a \"scam,\" how large the \"score\" might be.  Hypothetically, answered Clarissa, it might be \"huge.\" She said that the mark had only spoken to Simon on the phone, so Henry quickly assumed the speech and accent of \"a charming Aussie.\"\n\n\nIn the hotel in Detroit, Jack and Carly hid in the closet of Hayden Lawson, Sage's biggest competitor in the \"Little Miss Snowflake\" pageant.  Carly got the giggles when Jack mentioned that Craig had told him that Carly had gone to Detroit only to seduce Jack.  Carly denied that was true, but she did admit that she had said it to Craig just to get him to leave.  Hayden and her mother left the room to \"go kick some sequined butt,\" so Jack and Carly escaped from the closet.  Carly found Sage's music CD in the room, and the two of them scrammed.\n\n\nJack and Carly found Sage in the staging area, as the pageant director called Hayden to the stage.  The girl addressed the \"honorable judges\" with great poise and promised to do a dance that would knock their socks off.  The girl began a flapper dance to \"All that Jazz,\" and Sage was thoroughly intimidated.  After all the applause for Hayden, the director called for Sage.  Sage didn't move, however, and she told her parents she wanted to go home.  When Carly pushed verbally by reminding her daughter that the pageant was her \"dream,\" Sage snapped her CD in two and loudly denied that.  She declared that the pageant was \"so beyond stupid,\" and she confessed that she had only begun her routine on the Tuesday before.\n\n\nSage said that she had only wanted her parents to get away together, and the pageant was the only thing she had been able to think of.  Jack and Carly were angry, but Sage insisted that the two of them knew that they belonged together.  Carly urged the girl to go on stage and do her routine anyway, so Sage ran there and grabbed the microphone.  She announced that the judges could relax because there was no way she could win the pageant, but she wanted to sing to her mom and dad.  She sang to them, and Jack and Carly held hands.  Everyone applauded, and Jack sent Sage to find Parker and Liberty, who were on a walk, while he and Carly packed up their belongings.\n\n\nJack and Carly agreed that their daughter was \"one amazing little girl,\" and they went to their room to pack.  They discussed all the reasons why reconciliation would not work for the two of them and even decided to make a list to show Sage.  Neither Jack nor Carly could name a good reason, however.  Someone knocked on the door; Jack answered it and found Janet standing in the hall.  She asked to speak with him privately, so Carly left the room.\n\n\nJanet wanted to talk about their marriage, so Jack began by saying that he loved her, but a lot of things had happened since they first got married.  Janet said she had decided that their marriage was worth fighting for.  Meanwhile, Carly waited in the lobby, and Sage returned from her search.  She was not pleased to hear that Janet was in the building, and she told her mom that she had been unable to locate Parker and Liberty.\n\n\nParker and Liberty took a walk in some woods near the hotel, and they ran into other teenagers.  The other teens seemed young and immature to Liberty and Parker, so they soon walked off by themselves.  The temperature began to drop, and the pair got cold, so after a fun leaf fight, they headed back to the hotel.  Suddenly Liberty was overcome with tears, and she explained that she was missing her dad very much.  As they approached a stream, Parker talked about how different their lives would be the next year when Liberty was studying fashion in New York.\n\n\nParker saw no way around the stream, so he suggested they jump it, but Liberty thought it was too far for her to jump.  Parker volunteered to go first to show her how to jump properly, but he tripped and fell when he attempted it.  He claimed that he was all right, but there was blood showing through a rip in the leg of his jeans.  They followed the stream for a while, but Parker was having difficulty walking.  He finally got dizzy and collapsed, and Liberty checked his leg.  There was a deep wound and lots of blood, so Liberty took off one of her shirts and tied it around Parker's leg.\n\n\nLiberty helped Parker to his feet and let him lean on her for walking.  Parker declared her \"the best ex-wife\" he'd ever had, as they hobbled to an old shed to get out of the cold.  Parker suggested that they huddle together for warmth, so they sat on an old bench. They talked about the first time they had been together and were discussing their memories when Parker suddenly passed out and slid off the bench.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While Carly and Jack are hiding in a closet, Jack asks Carly if she got him to Detroit to seduce him. She explains that she told Craig that to make him leave, but she does ask him why they always end up being drawn to one another like now. Jack and Carly almost kiss, but when Hayden and her mom leave the room, Jack and Carly race out of the closet with Sage's CD. Sage is watching Hayden's act when she seems to be having second thoughts. Carly and Jack give her a pep talk, but Sage finally admits that this was a ruse and she has no interest in the Miss Snowflake Pageant. Jack and Carly are angry, as Sage explains why she did it and how she is sure they still love one another and they just needed to spend time together to remember that, as Carly and Jack are speechless. Outside the hotel where the pageant is being held, Parker and Liberty walk in the woods and talk about how they have been forced to grow up quickly due to circumstances in their lives. However, trying to have fun makes them lose track of their surroundings and they get turned around. Parker is then hurt, as he tries to hide how badly to not alarm Liberty, as they try to find a way out of the woods. Clarissa tries to coax Simon back into their long-standing deal that is about to payoff, but Simon wants to stay in town and make a life, as he turns her down. Clarissa offers him some money tempting him to think about it. Katie is feeling more positive about life these days, as she tells Henry about Kim being back in town and how they are due to meet about her show. However, her happiness is short lived when she sees Simon with Clarissa. An annoyed Katie wants to forget so she abruptly heads home. Soon after, Simon heads to Katie's to ask her out now that he has some green, but she can't help but ask about Clarissa. Simon explains who she is, but that he wants to stay in town to be there for her instead. Henry approaches Clarissa and tries to strike up a deal with her for him to replace Simon in this mysterious deal. Clarissa is not biting at first, but Henry is persistent. Carly and Jack talk to Sage about their disapproval of her behavior. Sage presses them to admit their feelings, as they admit they will always care for one another because they have history, but then Carly's attention is turned when Hayden's mother eggs her on. Sage is happy to see this interaction and heads onstage and sings a song, Never Surrender, dedicated to her parents. Later, Carly and Jack seem to be trying to convince themselves of a reason they can't get back together, but they seem to not have a reason off the top of their heads. They are about to share a kiss when Janet interrupts. After a sad Carly leaves them to talk, Janet explains that she has come to fight for their marriage, but she can't help but notice the vibe between him and Carly. Parker and Liberty get more lost but find a place to stay, as Parker's leg gets worse and Liberty has to care for him. Getting colder, they huddle for body warmth and are about to kiss when Parker passes out. Katie tells Simon that she can't make any promises, as Simon claims to accept that, but he wants to be there for her, as he kisses her. Henry continues to try to convince Clarissa that Simon will never change his mind because of Katie, but if Simon has never met the mark then he can play a fill in as the mysterious Australian. Sage is upset to hear from Carly that Janet is with her dad, as Carly seems to not be able to hide her disappointment either. However, she is becoming more worried about where Parker and Liberty are now.",
