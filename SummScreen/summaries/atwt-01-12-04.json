    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Jessica and Ben's house, Curtis urges Sarah to stay, but first Sarah confronts Jessica, saying that she can't understand why Jessica is asking Sarah to be her foster daughter when Jessica hates her.  Sarah asks Jessica if it is because she feels guilty about Marshall's death and Bonnie's imprisonment, and Jessica, angered, admits that she is doing it only because Bonnie begged her to.  Finally, Jessica and Sarah agree that they should give living together a try because both of them love Bonnie.  They tell Ben and Curtis, but a telephone call interrupts their optimistic gathering.  Jessica rushes off to meet Dr. Daniels while Ben, Curtis, and Sarah happily go to the shelter to get her belongings.\n\n\nAt the metro, Craig and Molly agree that Craig will persuade Dusty not to testify against Molly so that the charges of obstructing justice will be dropped.  In return, Molly agrees not to tell what she knows about Craig helping the police to build a case against Paul, and to keep quiet about Annabel Fettle's part in Cabot's adoption.  As they talk, Craig receives a call from the Lakeview Hotel, telling him that his \"Auntie Bell\" is checking in and wants to run a tab at the bar.  The two leave for the Lakeview, where Craig somehow manipulates Molly into letting Annabel share her room at the Lakeview.  As Molly and Annabel leave, wreathed in clouds of Annabel's cigarette smoke, Craig places a call to Mitzi, to see if they have their story straight in which she had agreed to say that she saw Paul put something in Rose's glass before the wedding.  Craig obviously does not know about Mitzi's poisoning.\n\n\nBarbara is in the hotel bar with Jen, who begs Barbara to tell the police that she took the glasses from the dressing room, since this evidence is damning to Paul.  Barbara refuses and turns away from Jennifer, who then accuses her of killing Rose herself.  Barbara turns and faces Jennifer and dares her to prove that Barbara is the killer.  Jennifer's cellular phone rings, and the caller is Dr. Walker Daniels, who has looked at a slide containing methanol and water, and has exclaimed, \"I'll be damned!\"  Dr. Daniels insists that Jennifer come to the hospital immediately, and Barbara follows her to the hospital.  When Jennifer discovers Barbara at the hospital she demands that Barbara leave, threatening to call security.  When Dr. Daniels shares his discovery with her, Jennifer insists that they call Jessica.\n\n\nPaul's detective comes to the penthouse with evidence that Barbara had hired a hit man to kill Rose, although Barbara had cancelled the hit.  Paul tears a sheaf of large bills in half for the detective to offer as incentive to get the hit man to talk directly to Paul.  When the detective and the hit man arrive at Paul's apartment, the hit man tells Paul that Barbara had hired him a month before to kill Rose, but that after a few hours she cancelled the hit and told him that she was going to do the job herself.  When Paul tries to get the hit man to go to the police with him, the hit man refuses, saying that he never talks to the police.  Paul offers the hit man protection through his father, James Stenbeck, and issues a veiled threat about people who stand in his way.  Inexplicably, Paul orders the detective and the hit man to stay in his apartment, while he \"gives [his] mother what's coming to her.\"\n\n\nAt Rose's house, Mitzi regains consciousness to beg Jack, \"Don't let me die,\" reminding Lily of Rose saying those very words before she died.  Lily, Dusty, Carly, and Jack rush Mitzi to the hospital and Lily demands that they test her for methanol.  Soon Dr. Bob Hughes confirms that Mitzi was poisoned with methanol, but that they caught it in time because of Lily's suggestion.  Dusty tells Jack that Paul overheard his conversation with Mitzi, so that Paul could have gone to Mitzi's ahead of them to poison her martini.  Barbara, walking toward the hospital exit, overhears their conversation and rushes off.  Jack calls Hal, who immediately goes with a crew to search Mitzi's house.  Lily and Dusty try to force Jack to arrest Paul, but Jack insists that he must follow police procedure, so Lily and Dusty rush off to find Tom Hughes, the District Attorney, to see if they can force him to act more quickly. At the hospital, Carly apologizes to Jack about her suspicions of Mitzi, then goes in to apologize to Mitzi.  At the sleeping Mitzi's bedside, Carly wonders if Mitzi could have poisoned herself, but stops herself and apologizes to Mitzi.  As soon as Carly leaves, Mitzi opens her eyes.  Carly and Jack leave the hospital.\n\n\nAt Mitzi's house, Hal sends the martini shaker and glass to be analyzed, then Holden and Luke enter because Luke has seen something that might be important.  Luke tells Hal that he heard loud voices at Mitzi's house and saw a thin man run off.  When Hal asks if the man could have been Paul Ryan, Luke says that it could have been. After everyone leaves, a shadowy, gloved figure stealthily opens the door.  Barbara Ryan walks in.\n\n\nAt the police station, Dusty and Lily rush up to Tom Hughes to try to get him to arrest Paul.  As Tom refuses, Paul walks past them on his way to find Hal.  Lily grabs Paul by the arm and tells him, \"We know you poisoned Rose.\"  Dr. Daniels, Jessica, and Jennifer enter the station and Walker announces, \"That's scientifically impossible!\"\n\n\n",
