But, Meg finds out from Susan she's not only suspended from working at Memorial but from practicing nursing as well. There, Meg runs into Holden who is shocked by her behavior but still encouraging that things will be all right. He invites her to the vow renewal but when he leaves, Meg sticks to her plan and begins stealing medical supplies to bring back to Paul. Meanwhile, Emily's trying to get her mother to pick up the rest of her things at Paul's penthouse. But, when she realizes Susan can't do it until later, she decides against her mother's urging and goes herself. Once there, Emily's bombarded by memories of the passion she and Paul once shared. Then Hal arrives, more certain than ever Emily knows something about where Paul is despite her insistence to the contrary. Meanwhile, Paul hears a man's voice outside the cabin and, fearing the police have finally caught up with him, tries to make a break for it. But even though it's soon clear the man is only a hunter, Paul's situation becomes dire when the infection Meg warned him about finally sets in.
