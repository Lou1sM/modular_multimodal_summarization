He tells her he was just looking for a spare house key because he lost his. They leave to go to Java; when Casey goes up to order coffee, he sees Elwood outside and goes and meets him and another boy from college, who he pays back with some of Margo's money. The boy leaves, and Casey gives the rest of the money to Elwood and asks him to please go pay back the other guys he owes at the dorm. Elwood leaves, and when Casey goes back into Java, Maddie asks what that was all about before realizing it sounds like she's grilling him. Casey then asks her how school's going, and she fills him in, telling him how much she's enjoying living with his parents because they act like what she thinks a family should act like --- very trusting and respectful. She tells him how much she loves him mom and likes spending time with her and talking to her about everything, including Casey; she tells him that of course, she didn't tell Margo about Casey's gambling, but that nothing Casey could do would ever stop Margo from being crazy about him. Casey says he's just remembered something important he has to do, and he leaves.\n\n\nAt the police station, Jack tells Carly that Prince Adolpho has arranged to have Carly transferred to the Leonian consulate in Chicago for questioning, because he feels Jack is too biased to handle the investigation properly. Carly is astounded that another government could question her like that, but Jack says Leonia is a valuable ally of the United States, and somehow the Prince has arranged this and may even arrange to have her extradited. Carly tells Jack it looks like he was right about Simon, that he's left her to take the fall for him; he says he wishes he'd been wrong. She tells him it felt good to have someone believe in her like Simon did, and Jack says he never stopped believing in her heart. Carly tells Jack that she regrets having ruined their marriage, saying she knows how much she's lost; Jack says he should never have left her. He then takes her to the consulate.\n\n\nAt Emma's house, Vienna talks to the Prince on the phone, then hangs up and tells Simon the Prince has called the consulate to take Carly into custody. Vienna tells Simon the Prince probably thinks Carly can lead him to Simon; Simon tells Vienna that Carly has the rest of the stolen jewels in a safe deposit box, and he needs to talk to her to get the password from her. Vienna wonders whether Simon is just using her to get access to Carly at the consulate in order to help her escape; Simon says that's not true but that he needs those jewels in order to be able to make a new start with Vienna. Vienna tells him if he crosses her, she'll cut his heart out. Vienna then goes to the consulate with Simon hidden in a large crate, which she tells the Leonian guard is a nude sculpture of herself that she wants him to put up in the Prince's room. The guard leaves to go call the Prince to see what he should do, and Simon takes that opportunity to suggest to Vienna that she should try to find out if Carly has been brought in yet. Vienna leaves, and the guard comes back in and opens the crate to inspect it; he sees Simon hiding inside. Meanwhile, Carly has arrived with Jack, and they have a private moment in the hallway, where Carly tells Jack to take care of the kids and get Gwen to help him, especially with Sage, who needs a woman in her life. She tells him to reassure JJ that she'll be okay and to tell Parker she's not mad, because she knows Parker loves her. She tells Jack she never stopped loving him, and he says he never stopped loving her. They kiss, then the guard returns and tells Jack it's time to leave. Carly goes into the room by herself, where she finds the empty crate and a guard knocked out on the floor; Simon steps out from another door, and they rush into each other's arms, with Carly saying, \"Oh, thank God --- you came for me!\"\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Lily sits down at a table and watches the enticing dessert tray pass by; she starts to take a diet pill, but Lucinda walks up at that moment and sits down with her. Lucinda says she knows Lily's worried about Faith but that maybe Faith just needs some space, and she offers to take Faith for a little trip somewhere. Lily takes that to mean that Lucinda thinks Faith would be better off away from her, but Holden walks in and overhears this and calls for a \"time-out\" between the two women. He tells Lily he needs her help at the farm because there's a problem with the well water. They go to Emma's farm, where Holden tries to reassure Lily that Faith is going through a normal phase for a girl her age. He manages to make her feel better, but when he finds an apple pie in Emma's fridge and offers a piece to Lily, she turns it down, and he realizes she's still concerned about what she's eating. He tells her it looks like she's lost weight already, and she's happy to hear it. Holden says he's going outside to wait for the inspector, and Lily looks at the pie, then reaches into her purse and gets out the diet pills. As she shakes one into her hand, Holden comes back in and asks, \"What are those?\"\n\n\nAt Java, Ian and Roy, two of Daniel's friends, see Emily waiting for Daniel and tell her that he was on his way into Java to meet her 10 to 30 minutes ago. Emily calls Daniel's cell phone and leaves him a message, then runs into Craig, who asks her what's wrong. She says she has a lot on her mind, so he tells her she should be thinking about her new partner at the paper, Tull, because working with him will mean she'll never get to see her son anymore; Emily asks what he means by that, and he says just that she'll be working so many hours, she won't get enough time with Daniel. Emily leaves and goes to Tom and Margo's to see if Daniel's there. She tells them she looked all over the parking lot at Java and called Daniel's friends and teachers, but no one's seen him. Tom tells her maybe Daniel went to the skateboard park near Java, because he went there last week without telling Tom when he was supposed to be meeting Tom. As Emily gets her hopes up, Margo hangs up the phone and tells them someone called the station and reported seeing a boy matching Daniel's description being forced into a dark, mid-sized sedan. Emily becomes very upset and says she has to go tell Susan before she hears it on the news or something; Margo wants to take her, but Emily says she and Tom should stay put in case there's a phone call or Margo needs to get to the station. Tom goes through pictures of Daniel to find one for an Amber Alert, and he's extremely upset that he doesn't have copies of the pictures he just took this week, even though the ones he's looking at are as recent as this past Christmas. Tom then calls Rosemary, the mother of one of Daniel's friends, who was supposed to have dropped Daniel off at Java, to ask her if she remembers seeing a dark sedan; he then tells her he wants to talk to her son again, and he gets angry when she tells him her son is scared right now. She apparently hangs up on him, and Tom tells Margo he's going to go looking for Daniel; as she tries to get him to stay, he cries out in pain and falls to the floor, clutching his chest. \n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Craig sits down at Lucinda's table and takes a bite of her dessert. He tells her he's upset with her for helping Lucy to run away with Johnny, and while she blames him for that predicament, he blames her, saying she stoked Lucy's fears. He tells her to get used to him taking things from her and says he'll make her pay for what she's done. Lucinda tells him she'd be destitute if she'd had to pay for every time he threatened her, then she leaves. Later, Emily walks into the Lakeview and sees Craig; walking up to him, she slaps him and demands, \"Where the hell is my son?\"\n\n\n",
