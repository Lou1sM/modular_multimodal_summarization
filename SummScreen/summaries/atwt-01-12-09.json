The doctor came by and said the boy could go home very soon if he kept progressing well. Dusty told Josie he liked the way she had stood up for herself when he had chewed her out for allowing Paul to see Johnny. After Dusty left, Josie peeked in on Paul and was surprised that he was dressed and putting on his coat. She went in, and Paul said the doctor said he was improving, so Paul had decided to go home. He asked for Josie's help because he wanted to see his new daughter and thought Meg would react better if Josie was along. Josie was hesitant, but she finally agreed. \n\n\nAt Lily's, Luke came home and found his grandmother there. Lucinda suggested the two of them turn the proverbial page and forget all the unpleasantness between them. Luke told her he could not forget that Brian had hurt both of them, and he suspected she couldn't either. Luke walked out, and Lucinda realized Jade had been watching and listening to them. Jade gave Lucinda a piece of her mind about how she was treating Luke, but Lucinda countered by saying that Noah's observing the kiss between Luke and Brian was not her fault. Jade told Lucinda she didn't get it and said Lucinda should use some of her business brains and find out what she could do to help Luke. \n\n\nCasey ordered a coffee from Noah at Java and apologized for locking him out on the roof with Luke. Noah was angry and told him to follow his own advice and figure out his relationship with Alison. Casey did not like Noah's words, and he walked out. \n\n\nAlison visited Johnny and spoke with Dusty. He thanked her for spearheading the bone marrow donation drive. Alison tried to rationalize not telling him that Johnny was in town, but Dusty said he thought she was a better friend than that. Alison reminded him that she and Lucy went way back together, plus when Lucy said Johnny needed Alison's help, her hormones kicked in and brought back to her the sad feelings that she probably would never have children of her own. They commiserated that, thanks to Craig, Lucy could not stay in town. Dusty thanked Alison again and told her not to be so hard on herself. She told Dusty there was a guy she liked a lot, but after her first failed marriage, she was gun shy. Dusty told her not to over think everything. \n\n\nTom gave Meg her divorce papers and recommended she tell Paul about them while he was undergoing psychiatric treatment and could get help if he needed it. Meg agreed, but she declined to present the papers herself. Tom understood why Meg was reluctant to see Paul in his damaged state and offered to serve the papers, but Meg wanted to think about it. \n\n\nTom went to the diner and ran into Casey, and he questioned his son about Maddie. Casey said he had to tell her the truth-that he was interested in someone else. Tom asked who, so Casey answered that it was Alison Stewart. Tom was not pleased to hear that and reminded his son that getting involved with anyone would be a big mistake. He thought it was time for Casey to buckle down and concentrate on himself. \n\n\nLucinda approached Noah at work at Java and told him she was going to talk, and he was going to listen. She said both of them had been wronged by Brian and Luke, but Noah attempted to brush her off by saying he had no time for chatting. Lucinda urged him to go find Luke and make things right or she would hound him and not give him a moment's peace. Noah said that what happened between Luke and him had nothing to do with Lucinda, but she begged to differ. She blamed herself for bringing Brian into the equation and reminded Noah that he had married Ameera, which was very difficult for Luke. Luke had forgiven him, and she thought Luke deserved the favor in return. As Lucinda started out the door, Jade came in. The women had words and Noah realized Jade had been responsible for Lucinda's visit. He gave her a sarcastic thank you and asked her who had given her permission to butt into his life. Jade carped at him and stormed out, and Noah followed. \n\n\nMeg fed baby Eliza a bottle at the farm as Paul and Josie walked in. Josie left them alone when she saw that Meg was not overreacting, and Meg asked Paul how he could have been released so quickly. Paul told her his nephew Johnny had helped him, but Meg assumed Paul was hallucinating and refused to let him near the baby. Paul begged just to look at his daughter, so Meg relented. While Paul was occupied with the baby, Meg went outside and called Dusty, who was surprised that Paul had left the hospital. Meg mentioned that Paul was not rational because he thought Johnny was back, so Dusty gave her the news that the boy was there with him. Meg was stunned but delighted that Johnny was back and had received a successful bone marrow transplant. After the call, Meg went inside to change the baby while Paul waited in the kitchen. He spotted the divorce papers and became upset. When Meg returned and saw what Paul was reading, she explained she was asking for full custody of Eliza, but that did not mean Paul could never see his little girl; it simply meant they would not be raising the baby together. \n\n\nTom left the diner as Luke entered, so Luke sat with Casey. He told his friend he was going to have to get used to being single all his life, but Casey told him that was lame. He hustled Luke out and said they were going to Java to settle things once and for all with Noah. They got to Java just as Noah was yelling at Jade outside the coffee shop. Noah complained that Jade had set Lucinda on him and then lashed out by listing all of Luke's faults. Luke, in turn, called Noah selfish about his feelings, and he continued to rant until Noah grabbed him and gave him a hard kiss. Jade and Casey came back and saw the boys locking lips, and they high-fived each other. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison told her friend, Leah, that she had just scored two tickets to an AC/DC concert in Chicago for that evening. She said she had a special friend who was a huge fan and would be very excited to go with her. She left to find Casey. \n\n\nDusty came to the farm and found Josie waiting outside. He deduced that Paul had gotten her to bring him to see the baby, and Josie verified that. She wondered why Dusty was there, so he told her Meg had called him, fearful that Paul was dangerous. Dusty went inside, and Paul apologized to Meg for coming there without calling first. On Paul's way out, Meg handed him the divorce papers and asked him to sign them. \n\n\nLuke and Noah went to Lily's and they could not keep their hands off one another. They went upstairs to Luke's room and locked the door. After their lovemaking, the boys showered and told each other that it had been a long wait, but it was definitely worth it. Noah was hungry, so they went downstairs to look for food, and Lucinda came in. She began gathering her belongings to go home, but Luke gave her the happy news that he and Noah were back together. He asked his grandmother to stay, as Noah had brought them all ice cream. Lucinda agreed to remain at Lily's for a while longer. \n\n\nCasey and Jade went into the diner, and Alison found them there. Casey was pumped that he and Jade had gotten Noah and Luke back together, and Alison felt as if she was intruding. She failed to mention the concert and said she had to return to work. After she left, Jade referred to her as \"Casey's girl,\" but Casey denied it. Back at the hospital, Alison gave the tickets to Leah. \n\n\nPaul and Josie went to Fairwinds, where Paul said he would not sign the divorce papers. He felt Meg just needed time to adjust to life with the baby. Josie wished him good luck and then left. Paul threw the papers into the trash. Josie returned to the Lakeview, where Dusty assured her they were still friends and gave her a hug.\n\n\n",
