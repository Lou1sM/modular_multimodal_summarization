    "soap_central": "\n\n \nKatie yelled at Simon after he kissed her.  She said that she had no time in her life for \"just a kiss\" from him, and she waved her daily time schedule in front of his face.  She claimed that she was overwhelmed by changing diapers, feedings, appointments with doctors, and lonely nights.  Katie asked Simon if he was sure he wanted to be a part of all that.   Jacob squalled, so she went to tend to him, and when she returned, she found that Simon had taken out the garbage and was folding the baby's laundry.  He proudly stated that he had reclaimed about 16 minutes on her timetable.\n\n\nKatie said that she appreciated Simon's help, but she still wanted him to leave.  He said he was falling for her all over again, but he agreed to go.  Katie admitted that his kisses scared her because they made her heart beat faster for him, but she knew that he would leave her again.  It was always the same.  Simon confessed that he liked to think of himself as Katie's hero, but then he always disappointed her.  He asked what Katie really wanted, and she blurted out that she just wanted Brad not to be dead.\n\n\nSimon walked out, but someone else knocked soon afterward.  It was Pam, Katie's realtor friend, who asked if Katie still had any interest in selling her house.  She said she had the perfect clients for it -- if Katie had solved \"the ghost problem.\"  Katie reassured Pam that the ghost was gone and the house spook-free.  Katie promised to think about selling.\n\n\nAt the diner, Henry continued to talk with Clarissa in an attempt to weasel his way into her con.  He learned that the mark's name was \"Mr. Lee,\" but Clarissa was not happy about having to settle for Henry when she really wanted Simon Frasier.  She told Henry that he was no Simon, and she asked Henry some questions to see if he knew what it took to pull off a scam.  Henry announced that he'd pulled a scam or two in his day, and he reminded Clarissa that Simon was \"on the lam\" and under the watchful eyes of the Oakdale police.\n\n\nHenry, on the other hand, was \"above suspicion,\" available, and capable of pulling off whatever Clarissa wanted. The two adjourned to Henry's hotel room to talk more privately, but Clarissa bore just enough of a resemblance to Vienna that it spooked Henry a bit.  Clarissa said she would invite Mr. Lee to lunch, and Henry added that \"plenty of drinks\" always softened up a mark.  Clarissa continued that their mark would probably want to see the land on which they would supposedly be constructing buildings.  They talked more strategy until suddenly Simon let himself into the room with his own key.\n\n\nSimon immediately asked what was going on, and Clarissa asked if he was jealous.  Simon replied that he was much more curious than jealous, so his former partner said that she had replaced him with Henry on their caper.  Clarissa left to get the blueprints Henry would have to study in order to convince Mr. Lee that he was Simon, and Simon lit into Henry and demanded that he drop out of the scam.  He also said that he was \"giving Katie some space.\"  Simon warned Henry to watch his back, because if anything happened to Henry, Katie would kill Simon.\n\n\nSimon went to the Lakeview lobby and saw Clarissa.  They went to the bar, and Simon warned her not to \"mess with Henry.\"  She tried to tempt Simon back into the scheme, but he declared that the two of them were done as partners.  Clarissa could not believe that Simon could just walk away from his wild side, but he got up and said, \"Watch me,\" and he marched out.  Clarissa returned to Henry's room, and they began checking his wardrobe for the most suitable clothes to impress Mr. Lee.\n\n\nClarissa asked some questions about \"the woman Simon was willing to give it all up for,\" and Henry said that Katie was \"amazing, adorable, smart, and funny.\" Clarissa suggested that Henry felt the same way about Katie as Simon did.  Henry said that she was being ridiculous; it was just that he was \"very protective\" of his best friend, Katie.\n\n\nSimon returned to Katie's, and she was glad to see him.  She explained what the realtor had said, and she said it would be good for her to get away from the memories in that house.  Katie was worried that she had let Brad down because she had allowed herself to have feelings for Simon.  As soon as she said those words, Katie tried to take them back by admitting that she was confused and exhausted.  Simon handed her a copy of her daily schedule, and he had put himself into every time slot with her.  Katie was moved to tears, but then she felt disloyal to Brad.  Simon said that he was done with his former life, and Katie would always be \"home\" to him.\n\n\nCarly and Sage waited in the lobby of the hotel in Detroit as Janet and Jack conferred in the room.  Carly was worried about the whereabouts of Liberty and Parker, and she could not reach her son on his cell phone.  Sage grumbled about leaving her dad and Janet alone in the hotel room, but Carly reminded the girl that Jack and Janet were married.  They talked about marriage and divorce, and Sage was very aware how many times her mother had walked down the aisle.  The hotel manager approached Carly and asked if she was Parker Snyder's mother.\n\n\nIn the room upstairs, Jack told Janet that he was confused that she wanted to fight for their marriage.  Janet said that she knew what she wanted: Jack and their marriage.  Jack then asked about Dusty; he needed to know if Janet's previous desire for an annulment had anything to do with him.  Janet answered that it was partly because of Dusty, but mostly it had to do with Jack.  Jack praised Janet for her honesty in telling him about the Christmas Eve kiss she had shared with Dusty, and he apologized for leaving her a cryptic note and taking off on a road trip after Brad's death.\n\n\nJack went on to further assure his wife that he would never disrespect their marriage by allowing anything improper to happen between Carly and him.  Janet looked concerned because she had never told Jack what had happened between her and Dusty on New Year's Eve, but just then, someone knocked on the door.  It was Carly, who gave them the news that the hotel manager had told her that some other teens from the hotel had found bloody and torn clothing in the woods and that Parker and Liberty were missing.\n\n\nJack went to check out the clothing, and he said it looked like part of Parker's jeans, and there had been quite a bit of blood.  He told the women that there was a search party forming, and he asked Sage to get one of Parker's shirts in case they needed scent dogs.  Janet was frantic about Liberty, and she turned on Jack and asked what he had been doing that was so important that he had let their children get lost.  She stomped out of the room, but Jack turned to Carly and said there was no way he blamed her for what had happened to the kids.\n\n\nJanet went into the lobby and called Dusty at Metro.  She told him that Parker and Liberty were lost in the woods and that Parker was probably injured.  Dusty talked Janet through what Liberty would do in such a situation, and then he suggested that she somehow help Liberty get back to her.  Carly, Jack, and Sage walked up, and Janet cooled off.  Jack left for the search command post, and the women and Sage decided to provide food and hot coffee for the searchers.\n\n\nIn an old shed in the woods, Liberty tried to awaken Parker, who had passed out again.  He opened his eyes, and Liberty attempted to get him up, but Parker could not put weight on his injured leg.  He urged her to get help and to get it quickly because he was craving French fries.  Liberty left reluctantly, but she was back shortly with two large tree limbs.  She said she could not just leave Parker there, and she went to work on the limbs and tied them together with another of her shirts.  Eventually, she fashioned a crude but serviceable crutch, and the two of them hobbled out of the shed.\n\n\nJack returned to the hotel with the news that the searchers had lost the trail, and darkness was approaching.  He reassured Carly by telling her that Parker knew enough to search for shelter, and he also knew first aid.  Carly was very worried, and she acknowledged her desire for a drink, but she stuck to coffee.   They sat with Sage on the couch and waited.  Janet passed by the couch and saw the three of them sitting as a family.  She did not have time to ponder that, however, because Dusty Donovan walked into the lobby.\n\n\nDusty said he had flown up in one of his helicopters, and Janet threw her arms around his neck.  He offered his fleet of helicopters and whatever manpower they needed for the search.  Jack sat up on the couch and saw Dusty.  He went over and began to challenge Dusty until he realized that Dusty had arrived with help for the kids.  Then he thanked Dusty and told him whom to contact for the air rescue.  Suddenly, Sage spotted Parker and Liberty stumbling through the lobby.\n\n\nEveryone rushed to the teens and got Parker on the couch.  The EMTs checked him out and suggested that they transport him to the local hospital for x-rays immediately.  Dusty offered the helicopter for transport back to Memorial if Jack and Carly were more comfortable with that, so that was where they agreed to send Parker.  Dusty also offered to drive one of their cars back to Oakdale so there would be room in the chopper for all the families.\n\n\n",
