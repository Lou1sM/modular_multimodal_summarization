Craig knows what happened between Lucy and Raphael. Lucy tried to deny it but Craig said he saw the look on Raphael's face when Lucy went off with Dusty. Lucy thought that her father was trying to get Raphael on his side so Lucy would get away from Dusty. Craig said that nothing would make him happier if she never saw Dusty again but he promised he wouldn't tell Dusty about them. Lucy told her father she was very confused because Dusty hurt her so badly and Raphael was so good to her. Craig said she would figure it out and they hugged. Over at Metro, Dusty told Raphael to stay away from Lucy but Raphael told Dusty to remember he was a fighter and walked out. Later, Lucy showed up to talk to Dusty. Lucy told him that she had been avoiding him because she had been hiding the fact that she and Raphael made love. Dusty replied, \"I know.\"\n\n\nAaron told Alison about the additional tests he took when his head started to hurt. Alison asked him to sit down and they talked about being with each other. Shortly after, Aaron collapsed. Over at the hospital Ben was looking over Aaron's X-ray's when Bob approached and told Ben he had to leave. Bob told Ben he was worried Ben would lose his license but Ben said he didn't care and showed Bob the blood clot on Aaron's X-ray. They both rushed to find Aaron who was being brought into the ER. They tried to find a surgeon but Alison asked why Ben couldn't perform the surgery. Bob put Ben back on staff and ordered an Operating Room, STAT! \n\n\nJack, Holden, Luke and JJ were at the cabin. Jack asked Holden how he and Luke were doing. When Jack pressures Holden, he told Jack that the marriage was over. Holden admitted he loved Lily but they had drifted so far apart that they drifted somewhere else. Jack said, \"To Julia.\"  Holden said he liked Julia and was just being a friend to her since everyone else treated her so badly. Holden told Jack he should let go of JJ because he couldn't be the kind of father JJ needed since Carly and Julia hated each other. Meanwhile, Lily and Carly arrived at Emma to drop off some things for the auction. Lily was afraid she wasn't welcome because of Julia but Emma said that it didn't matter who was staying there, she was always welcome. Carly had a plan to use her compass to get rid Julia. Carly said she was going to plant the compass in Julia's room where Emma could find out and throw her out. Lily wasn't up for it until Carly told her that she needed to fight for Holden. Carly said that Julia was an operator and a predator. She explained about what Julia did to Jack when he had amnesia.  Lily took the compass and said, \"Where do we hide it?\" They thought Julia was going to be working for a while but they were wrong when Julia arrived at home just as they were going to her room. They started to exchange words when Julia said she was going to her room. As Carly tried to stop her by grabbing her purse, Julia's purse fell to the ground and the compass rolled out just as Emma walked in. Carly accused Julia of taking the compass and when Carly kept pushing, Julia walked out and went right to the cabin and right into Holden's arms!\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Emily makes Paul believe that she was really sick and doesn't remember why she did the things she did. Paul asks her about Barbara's helpfulness and Emily realizes Paul might be onto something. When Alison realizes that Emily could never have drawn the map of Fairwinds in such detail without help, Paul promises to keep searching for the truth.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig and Lucy have a heart to heart after she gives her statement at the police station, Craig opting out of giving her advice and letting her decide to tell Dusty that she slept with Rafi. Rafi runs into Dusty at Metro looking for Lucy and through much pressure alludes to the fact he and Lucy were intimate. Lucy comes in after he leaves. As Ben is convincing Bob that Aaron's films show a massive blood clot, Aaron collapses at Al's and is brought in. Not being able to get hold of Dr. Ramirez, Bob reinstates Ben and books an O.R.. Holden and Jack discuss Julia and Holden advises a stunned Jack that he should probably cut JJ out of his life for the boy's own good. Meanwhile at Emma's Carly's plot to plant the compass Jack gave her to appear like Julia stole it, backfires in Lily's opinion and sends a distraught Julia running to Holden at the cabin.",
