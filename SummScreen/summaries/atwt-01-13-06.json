Lucinda isn't having a good day and is feeling nauseous from the chemotherapy, but when she sees Faith and Natalie with makeup all over their faces in their effort to look beautiful, it makes her laugh and feel better. Luke questions Holden about what made him fall in love with Lily, and Holden tells Luke the story of their early relationship, when no one approved of them being together. Luke is interested in how Holden felt in the face of all that disapproval from friends and family. Holden tells Luke that when Luke finds someone who accepts him the way he is, he'd better hold onto that person.\n\n\nAs Jack and Carly get ready to go to the \"wedding,\" Jack tells Carly to watch their expenses because money is tight. She tells him about Barbara's offer of a job, but Jack doesn't want her to accept it because Barbara always has an ulterior motive and is a dangerous person to get involved with. He also tells her he thinks Nick Kasnoff won't last long as a detective because Mike told him he has issues with authority figures, so Jack plans to be able to get his detective job back in a couple of weeks.\n\n\nMeg literally runs into Emily at the Lakeview, and her stash of syringes and medications fall out of her purse, causing Emily to ask if she's stolen them from the hospital. Meg offers to call the police, saying she knows Emily wouldn't want that. Emily leaves, and Emma arrives; she sits down with Meg and tells her she thinks she should come to Lily and Holden's ceremony, but Meg isn't sure it's such a good idea. \n\n\nEmily goes to the hospital and tells Susan about Meg's stash of medical supplies; Susan is more concerned with whether or not Emily is getting her own house in order by apologizing to Jennifer for what she did to her.\n\n\nAt the renewal of vows, Holden and Lily tell each other how much they mean to one another and vow to stay together from now on. Meg walks in, but she turns around and walks out again when she sees Jennifer, Dusty, and Johnny there; Emma follows and apologizes, saying she had no idea they'd be there, but Meg tells her not to worry about it and leaves. After the ceremony, Lucinda tells Luke that one day soon, girls will be lining up for him, but he looks doubtful and grabs a glass of champagne when Lucinda isn't looking. She catches him with the champagne flute later, but he tells her it was just ginger ale.\n\n\nEmily goes back to the Lakeview, where she runs into Jennifer; Jennifer tries to leave, but Emily tells her about Paul calling and canceling their wedding for no apparent reason. Jennifer tells her that she thinks she knows the reason: \"Me!\"\n\n\nWhen Hal comes into the station to work, Nick calls him, \"Lou\" (for \"lieutenant\"), which Hal doesn't like. Nick asks to be assigned to the Paul Ryan case because it's a conflict of interest for Hal to be involved in it. Hal dresses Nick down for his attitude but ultimately assigns him the case, telling him he'd better see results soon. Nick calls Emily and asks her to come in for some more questioning, but she refuses. He then decides to go question Carly to ask her about Paul Ryan and Emily.\n\n\nPaul's condition is worsening, and he becomes delusional, thinking at first that Emily has come to the cabin to shoot him and later that Jennifer has arrived, axe in hand, to murder him. He manages to call Meg on the cell phone and tell her it's not safe at the cabin because Jennifer and Emily have been there; she tells him he's delusional, but then he loses consciousness. When he awakens, he thinks both Jennifer and Emily are there at the same time, laughing at him, and he manages to get out of the cabin. Meg arrives at the cabin and can't find Paul.\n\n\n",
