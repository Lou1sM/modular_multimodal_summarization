She told them the \"sight of two senior citizens sucking face\" disturbed her sensibilities. Jack left for work, and Janet asked her daughter what was going on between her and Parker. She was still disturbed that the last time Liberty was with Parker, she had come home with her shirt buttoned wrong. Liberty told her mother she wasn't sure how she felt about Parker, but whatever feelings she had towards him, they were not \"brotherly.\" Janet said she had no problem with her daughter dating Parker, even though Brad and Jack disagreed, and cautioned that Liberty's biggest problem would be Carly. Janet suggested the two of them tell Carly that Parker and she were more than just friends, and she dragged a reluctant Liberty to the car. \n\n\nParker went looking for Craig at the Lakeview. He had a present for Johnny that he wanted Craig to deliver. He found him in the lounge and thanked Craig for not ratting him out when Craig found him and Liberty under the bar at Metro. Craig invited Parker to accompany him to the hospital to deliver the train to Johnny himself. \n\n\nJosie played with Johnny at Memorial. Dusty arrived with the good news that the boy could leave the hospital and go home. They packed up Johnny and headed to the Lakeview where Dusty had assembled a train set at Josie's suggestion. Johnny said, \"Thank you, Daddy,\" which had an emotional impact on Dusty, who had never heard the boy call him \"Daddy\" before. Dusty left to pick up a prescription for the boy, leaving Josie with Johnny. \n\n\nLily called on Carly and wanted to explain in person why she had nixed the idea of loaning money to her friend. Carly spoke first, however, and apologized for putting her friend in an awkward position. Lily was relieved that Carly harbored no ill feelings, and she offered to buy her lunch. They went to the Lakeview, where Carly told Lily that she had borrowed the money for Metro from a \"venture capitalist.\" Carly admitted that the lender was Craig, and Lily could not believe Carly was willing to take a chance on someone with Craig's history. \n\n\nCraig and Parker found Johnny's room empty at the hospital. A nurse told them the boy's father had taken him home. A furious Craig told Parker that they would go to the hotel and straighten things out. They drove to the Lakeview, and Craig knocked on Dusty's door. Josie answered, as Craig barged right past her, bringing Parker along. Josie tried to get Craig to leave, but he invited his son to go get ice cream instead. Craig told Josie that Johnny was his boy, and therefore he could make decisions for him. Johnny went willingly with Craig and Parker, so Josie phoned Dusty. He promised to be right there, but he took a minute to call Jack and alert him that Craig had kidnapped Johnny. \n\n\nCraig, Parker, and Johnny came into the Lakeview lounge and greeted Carly and Lily, who were finishing lunch. They joined the women, and Carly questioned Parker about his being a part of Craig's entourage, but Parker explained how he had gotten Johnny a present because he was his nephew. Carly was suspicious of her son's motives. \n\n\nJack went to Dusty's room and talked with him and Josie. Josie told him what happened and said Craig had left his cell phone number on her phone. Dusty immediately called it and asked where he was, so Craig invited Dusty to join the party in the hotel lounge. \n\n\nAt the ice cream party, Carly was uncomfortable and told Parker she thought they should leave. Parker gave Johnny the train set as Dusty arrived. Dusty grabbed Craig out of his chair and threatened to kill him if he ever took Dusty's boy again. Johnny was alarmed and spoke up, asking Dusty to stop being so mean. Jack suggested he, Craig, and Dusty go elsewhere to discuss matters, so Josie agreed to take Johnny back to the room when he finished his ice cream. Jack also asked Parker and Carly to wait for him there. Johnny appeared to lose his appetite, so Josie took him away. Dusty accused Craig of stealing the boy out of his home, but Craig claimed he had left his cell phone number and never took the boy out of the hotel. Dusty was angry, but Jack let Craig defend his actions. Dusty then reminded Craig that he had legal custody, not Craig. Craig countered that if they were considering legalities, Dusty was legally dead. Jack urged the two men to act civilly, while the rival dads continued to trade barbs. \n\n\nCraig came back to the table to pay the bill and found Lily still there. They discussed Craig's situation, and Lily suggested he should stop lying to himself. She reminded him he lived alone in a hotel room and could only offer Johnny a series of broken marriages and a police record. Craig admitted all that, but he said except for the marriages, Dusty was in the same boat. Lily laughingly suggested a good first step would be to get a wife! Craig said he and wives didn't seem to get along, but Lily said one would be his best asset. \n\n\nDusty talked with Josie in the hotel room. She advised him that he had promised he would be civil to Craig and to stop acting self-righteous. She insisted that Dusty needed to try harder to keep his promise to Lucy. Johnny fell asleep, and Dusty realized he was afraid of having to share the boy with Craig. \n\n\nJack went back to Carly's where Parker tried to justify his hanging out with Craig after Jack had told him specifically not to do that. He said he only went to deliver the present to Johnny, and Craig had dragged him along to the hospital. The doorbell rang, and Jack answered it. He was surprised to find Janet and Liberty, who asked for Carly. Janet announced that Parker and Liberty were together again, which meant dating. Carly accused the teens of sneaking around to be together, which Liberty denied and Parker admitted. Janet spoke up for the kids, but Jack was not buying the \"responsible teen\" routine. Surprisingly, Carly agreed with Janet. She said she thought the kids needed to follow the rules, but the adults should cut them some slack. Jack was not convinced. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Jack was discouraged. Janet tried to convince him that they needed to trust their kids to do the right thing. \n\n\nCraig appeared unannounced at Carly's. He said he had something to discuss with her. Out of the blue, he asked her how she would like to marry him, and Carly slammed the door in his face.\n\n\n",
