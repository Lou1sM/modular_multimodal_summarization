Simon wasn't so sure he felt the same, and he called it \"running away.\"  Katie was looking forward to a fresh start in a new place, but Simon wasn't eager to resume his vagabond lifestyle.  He said that moving around called attention to them, and that tempted fate.  Katie was unhappy with the constant reminders of her life with Brad in Oakdale, so when Simon asked when she was thinking of leaving, she answered, \"How 'bout today?\"\n\n\nSimon suggested that they \"take a few days to look at all the angles,\" but Katie was afraid that she would lose her nerve.  Simon thought it would be selfish of him to jump on Katie's suggestion, and he asked her to think about the people she would be leaving behind, particularly Henry and Margo.\n\n\nAt that moment, Henry, who had Jacob out for a stroll, ran into Margo in Old Town.  She said she wanted to talk to him, and at first, Henry was worried that Mr. Lee might have filed a complaint, but Margo was unaware of Mr. Lee.  Henry told her that Katie was doing well, and he gave a great deal of the credit for that to Simon.  Henry took the baby home and interrupted Simon and Katie's serious conversation.  Katie told Henry that she and Simon were leaving town.\n\n\nHenry was rendered almost speechless, but Katie begged her best friend to be happy for her.  Henry whined that she was breaking his heart and asked Simon for a martini.  Katie assured Henry that they would always be friends, and Simon promised to take \"incredible care\" of her and baby Jacob.  Henry began trying to talk Katie out of leaving, but she said that she needed to start over, and she could not do that in Oakdale.\n\n\n Next, Henry went after Simon, but he soon realized that moving away was Katie's idea.  He panicked when Katie said they wanted to leave that very day.  Katie asked Henry to be her friend and let her go, and she embraced him.  They said their goodbyes, and a heartbroken Henry walked out.  Katie was moved, but she stuck to her plan.  Simon asked Katie where she wanted to go, and she thought for a bit and then chose New York.  She said that she and Simon were partners, and he wasn't to worry about money.\n\n\nHenry dashed directly to the police station and told Margo that Simon had convinced Katie to leave town with him that day.  Margo was shocked, and she grabbed Henry's arm and her keys, and they took off.\n\n\nSimon and Katie walked to Old Town for supplies, and Katie mentioned that she would really miss Al's Diner.  Simon reminded her that she had said the same thing about the gas station and the pharmacy two minutes before.  Margo, another officer, and Henry approached, and Margo announced that Simon was under arrest.  She directed the cop to cuff Simon as an amazed Katie protested.  Katie yelled at Henry, whom she blamed for running to her sister, and she proclaimed that moving away was her idea, not Simon's.  She said the very people she loved the most were making her feel as if she was in prison.\n\n\nMargo argued as Katie said that she had to go out in the world and find out if her instincts were right.  She begged Margo and Henry to love her enough to let her live her life.  Margo thought a moment and then directed the cop to remove the handcuffs from Simon.  Katie thanked her sister, and Margo said that there was one condition on her releasing Simon: she wanted Katie to have a proper sendoff before she left Oakdale.  Margo asked Katie to stay a couple of days longer, and Margo would have a \"farewell blowout\" for her.\n\n\nKatie and Simon went back home, and Katie was furious at Margo and even more so at Henry.  At the police station, Margo expressed to Henry that they would have to \"pull out all the stops\" at the party so that Katie couldn't actually make herself leave.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Janet tried to tempt Liberty to eat the hospital food, but she was not successful.  Liberty did not understand why the doctor had even admitted her, since she was not injured.  She just wanted to go home and sleep in her own bed and eat her mother's cooking.  Liberty was also concerned about Parker, so she asked Janet to go check on him, and Janet agreed.\n\n\nA nurse pushed Parker in a wheelchair back to his room after an x-ray that revealed only a hairline fracture of the tibia.  The nurse told Jack and Carly that the doctor needed one more x-ray after the leg was cast, and then Parker could go home.  The nurse took their son away as Jack and Carly celebrated with a hug, and Janet walked in.  Jack asked Carly to give him a minute with Janet, so Carly walked out.  Jack told his wife that it was time to refocus on their marriage.  He admitted that he had been thrown off-guard when Janet had shown up in Detroit.  Janet, however, thought that Jack was just as confused as always.\n\n\nCarly found Parker after his last x-ray, and she wheeled him into Liberty's room.  The teens were delighted to see each other, and Parker's doctor walked in and told Parker and Carly that there was no infection or further damage, so Parker could go home.  Parker asked him to please check with Liberty's doctor so that she could also leave, and the doctor agreed.  Parker wanted to wait for Liberty's release, but she told him to go home and rest, and she promised to call him as soon as she got back to the farm.\n\n\nCarly pushed Parker out and parked him in a hall while she interrupted Jack and Janet's conversation.  Janet suggested that Jack go with Carly so that he could help Parker in and out of the car.  She promised Jack they would talk later, and Jack kissed his wife on the cheek.  He and Carly took Parker to the car.\n\n\nJack and Carly helped Parker into the house, and the teen plunked himself on the couch. Then he realized that if he slept there until he could manage the stairs, there was nowhere for Jack to sleep.  Jack and Carly looked at one another and went into the kitchen.  Carly said that they had to tell the kids that Jack was moving out and on with his life.  Jack thanked her for helping him through a troubled time, and they joked about one another's peculiarities in their living situation.  They decided it was wise to tell Parker right away that Jack would no longer be staying there.\n\n\nJack and Carly carried a sandwich to Parker, and he took one look at his parents and said he already knew what they were struggling to tell him.  He said he knew that Jack was moving out.  Jack said yes, and then Parker asked if his dad and Janet were reconciling.  Jack said he didn't know, but he felt it was unfair to the kids to give them false hope by having him continue to stay at Carly's.  He said Sage's heart would be broken all over again, and he left the room for a moment.\n\n\nCarly talked with Parker and soon realized that the Detroit caper had been all Sage's idea, but Parker had gone along with it.  Parker was not yet convinced that the scheme had not worked, but when Jack returned, Parker dropped the topic.\n\n\nJanet went back to Liberty's room, and her daughter jumped out of bed, but she got dizzy.  She crawled back into bed and complained that she craved \"real food.\"  She even mentioned that she was so hungry that she even imagined that she smelled delicious Italian food.  At that moment, Dusty walked in with a large shopping bag and announced, \"Room Service!\"  Teri had prepared several of Liberty's favorite Italian dishes for her niece, but Janet told Dusty that he needn't have done that.  Liberty, however, begged to differ, and she told her mother that whatever she was doing with Dusty, she should \"keep doing it.\"\n\n\nAs Liberty ate, Dusty went to find napkins, and when he returned with a roll of paper towels, he asked what he has missed.  Janet said \"nothing,\" but Liberty remarked how great a boss Dusty was.  Liberty's doctor walked in, and the girl demanded to go home.  The doctor said one final exam wouldn't hurt, so Janet and Dusty stepped outside.  The doctor began to examine Liberty, and he noticed a large bruise on her forearm.  He asked how long Liberty had had it, but she said she had never noticed it before.\n\n\nJanet began to be concerned about why the doctors had not yet released her daughter.  She also expressed her gratitude to Dusty for how wonderfully he had treated her family.  The doctor finally exited Liberty's room, and he said that the girl was not ready to go home.  He asked questions of Janet about the bruise on her daughter's arm, and then he said he wanted to take another look at the results of Liberty's blood work.  He returned in a few minutes and told Janet that the news was not good.\n \n\n\n",
