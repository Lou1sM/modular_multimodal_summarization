    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Fairwinds, Rosanna tries, unsuccessfully, to convince Paul not to leave her. He tells her he's in love with Meg and can't forgive Rosanna for what she's done. Rosanna says she'll never let him divorce her, and he threatens to turn her in to the police for having switched the results of the paternity test. Rosanna begs Paul to reconsider, telling him that he's the thing that keeps her \"from slipping back into the darkness.\" Paul says she needs to find someone or something else to cling to, and he leaves. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Meg is in her suite, packing up some things, when Craig walks into the bedroom. He thanks her for not pressing charges against him, but she says the only reason she didn't was because she couldn't stand to be around him anymore. When Craig tries to say how sorry he is about the baby and how much he wanted a family, Meg reminds him that just a few days ago, he wasn't willing to even feel the baby move anymore because it wasn't his child. He says he changed because he loves her and just wanted them all to be a family, but she says all he really wants is a child, period. When she asks why he didn't tell her about the paternity test switch when he found out, he says because he was afraid she would immediately run back to Paul, which is what he thinks she's doing now. She says she won't answer that, but when he says he deserves an answer because she's his wife, she tells him, \"I'm not your wife anymore,\" throws her wedding ring at him, and leaves.\n\n\nIn the lobby of the Lakeview, Holden, who is waiting for Meg, runs into Lily and fills her in on what happened. Lily is saddened by the news and asks what she can do to help, but Holden says he thinks Meg wants to handle it on her own. Lily says she will always think of Meg as family and that family was the one thing she thought she could count on. Holden is concerned that Lily's not okay, but she tells him she's fine. Meg comes back downstairs, and Lily offers her condolences and hugs her. Meg and Holden leave, and Lily heads for the elevator, where she takes a pill from her purse. Dusty catches the elevator door before it can close, and when they arrive on Dusty's floor, Lily offers to get him a different room so he won't have to watch Emily and Chris all the time, but Dusty says it doesn't bother him. Lily pleads with Dusty for them to go back to how they were before New Year's Eve, and she wants him to go to his room with her now, but Dusty tells her that she has always made her way back to Holden in the past, and he doesn't want to be Holden's stand-in. \n\n\nMeg goes to the farm with Holden, but Holden has to leave to run some errands. A few minutes later, Paul comes in and tells her how sorry he is about the baby and asks for her forgiveness. Meg says she loves him and probably always will but that she can't be with him anymore. He says she can't turn her back on him, but she reminds him that he turned his back on her when he returned from the \"dead.\" Meg tells Paul that what drives him is not his love for her but his hate for Craig, saying that \"even the mention of his name gets a bigger reaction than anything else,\" including the loss of their child. Paul pleads with Meg to let him love her, but she says it's not enough. He tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away. He tells her she has his heart, then he turns and leaves. Meg thinks about going after him but stops herself.\n\n\nLily goes to Yo's, looking for the man she met who had drugs. The bartender says he's not there, but if she wants what Jay normally carries, he might be able to help her. For $100, he sells Lily some pills. Before she can leave, she runs into Christa, one of the hookers who used to work for Cheri. She calls Lily \"Lola,\" and Lily remembers who she is. When Christa says Lily looks like she's been through the emotional wringer, Lily says it was about Dusty Donovan, whom Christa knows because he was the one falsely accused of murdering Cheri. Lily says Dusty dumped her for Emily Stewart, and Christa says she used to work with Emily, for Cheri, and thinks Emily is nothing but trouble. Lily is floored to find out that Emily was a hooker.\n\n\nRosanna goes to see Craig, to try to get him to win Meg back so she can get Paul back, but Craig assures her that even if that were possible, she's the last person Paul would turn to now. He tells her she's responsible for what happened, not him, and he wonders whether she told Paul how she begged him not to tell him about the paternity test results and how she bribed Eli to keep the results a secret. When Rosanna reminds him that he tried to kill the baby, Craig says he's ashamed of what he did and that he had time to think the better of it and wanted to raise the baby as his own, in every sense. Rosanna says, \"This whole situation has such a sad ring of familiarity to it,\" and Craig agrees, saying he's becoming familiar with suffering the loss of a child. Rosanna is derisive, saying it wasn't even his child, and he tells her to get out; she tells him to go to hell, then she leaves. Craig drinks alone in his room, then finds the plans for the house he was going to build, complete with the large nursery; in despair, he rips the plans in half. Rosanna returns to Fairwinds, where she suddenly comes down with a bad headache.\n\n\nEmily sees Dusty at Al's and lays into him for trying to recruit Alison to spy on Chris. Dusty tells her she's in denial if she thinks Chris didn't have anything to do with Bob's stroke. When Emily leaves, she goes to the hospital and finds Chris in a lab, where he's reviewing Bob's medical records to see if there's anything in there that could lend any credence to Dusty's accusations of poisoning. He doesn't see anything, and Emily asks if he ran a toxicology screen. He says he didn't see any reason to do one, because it was his father, and he already knew what medications Bob was taking. Emily is curious, because she thought a tox screen was routine, and Chris wants to know if this means she's beginning to believe he may have poisoned his own father. She tries to apologize, telling him she believes in him and reminding him that tonight is the press party for \"Memo 21,\" which is apparently what they are calling the new research laboratory. Chris is paged by Kim, who wants to have an early dinner with him, and he invites Emily to come along. They go meet Kim at Al's, where Chris tells her about the party and asks if she can come. She tearfully tells him how proud she is of him and his work so far as the interim chief of staff, and she says she wouldn't miss it for the world. Dusty walks by Al's and sees them all together; Emily stares at Dusty, and Chris can't help but notice her look, which is somewhat wistful.\n\n\nHolden runs into Bonnie at Java, and she invites him to go with her to the press party for Memo 21, saying her law firm was given tickets to the event and she is afraid she'll be bored if she goes alone. He tells her he'll have to check to see how Meg's doing, but he'll get back to her. He leaves and runs into Dusty, who tells him he needs to check on Lily. Holden is angry that Dusty is trying to tell him anything about his wife, but Dusty tells him something's not right and it's not too late to fix things, because Lily still loves Holden.\n\n\nDusty goes to the hospital, where he confronts Chris and Emily again. Chris warns him to stay away from the party tonight, but Dusty reminds him that Bob was against the project, and he says he'll make sure it gets shut down. Chris tells Dusty to leave before he calls security and says not to worry about someone spiking the punch at the party; Dusty says Chris doesn't need to poison anyone now because he's got what he wants, for now. Chris is paged to go to the ER and has to leave, and Emily again tells Dusty that no one will ever believe that Chris tried to poison his own father. Dusty tells her, \"The truth is going to come out tonight. All of it.\"\n\n\n",
