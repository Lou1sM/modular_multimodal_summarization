She stated that he couldn't drive with a bad leg, but Parker said it was the least he could do after she'd saved him.\n\n\n       \nIn Carly's kitchen, Jack asked why Carly wanted him to stay at the house. Carly stammered, and Jack joked that she needed him around to open jars. She suggested that Parker needed help getting around the house. Jack said there would always be reasons for him to stick around. \"So what does that tell you?\" Carly asked. Jack decided that he had to g or else there would be nothing left of his marriage. Carly said that Jack should fix his marriage because he'd been talking about doing it since he'd moved in.\n\n\nCarly went to the living room and saw that Parker was missing. She and Jack rushed outside in time to see Parker drive off. Carly wondered where Parker could be going, and Jack looked at her knowingly. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" Carly said.\n\n\n       \nLater, Parker arrived at the hospital to spring Liberty, but he was surprised to see his parents stride up behind him. As Liberty blabbered that it was her fault, Carly and Jack chastised Parker for not resting his leg. Jack expressed concern for Liberty, and Liberty said that it was none of his business. He asked where Janet was, and Liberty quipped that it was easier to ask where Janet was than to be a husband. Carly led Parker out of the room.\n\n\n       \nJack told Liberty that he realized that he'd been an absentee stepfather and husband since Brad's death; however, Jack vowed to be there for her because he was her uncle. Jack and Liberty discussed seeing Brad on Christmas Eve, and she admitted that she dealt with the pain better when she could blame someone for it. She wasn't sure she'd ever be able to stop blaming Jack. He replied that it was okay, because he liked a challenge.\n\n\nJack and Carly took Parker home, and Parker joked that he'd pulled \"a Jack\" by going to rescue Liberty from Memorial. Parker went to get a sandwich, and Carly remarked that Parker loved having Jack around. Jack stated that he was still leaving so that the kids wouldn't get false hope. Carly figured that he'd go to the farm, but Jack said he had no idea where he'd go.\n\n\n       \nJack packed some things and thanked Carly for her couch. She welcomed him to visit anytime. He said that target practice with Carly had convinced him to return to work. Carly hugged Jack, and he kissed her cheek. They lingered close to each other, and Jack kissed her on the lips.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Janet pressed Liberty's doctor to release Liberty. The doctor informed Janet and Dusty that Liberty had leukemia. Janet yelled that it couldn't be happening, and the doctor said that they had every reason to be hopeful. The doctor left, and Janet wondered how she hadn't known that her daughter had a fatal disease. Dusty said that it wasn't necessarily fatal, and Liberty would get the best treatment possible. Unable to face Liberty, Janet rushed off.\n\n\n       \nIn the chapel, Janet prayed that God would not punish Liberty for Janet's infidelity. Dusty entered, and he assured her that Liberty wasn't sick because they'd slept together. He urged her to tell Liberty about the illness, but Janet didn't know where to start. She felt that even though she had her faith, she was alone. Dusty said that she had God, and she had Dusty, too.\n\n\n       \nLater, Janet somberly entered Liberty's room. Liberty wondered what was wrong. Janet sat at Liberty's bedside and said that Liberty had leukemia. Liberty gulped and asked if she'd die. Janet hugged Liberty and assured her that they'd fight it. Liberty cried, \"No!\"\n\n\n       \nAt home, Damian showed Lily a website about safari honeymoons. A reluctant Lily wished they could get their lives back on track before they jetted off somewhere. Damian said that he just wanted some alone time, and Lily decided to stop finding reasons to say no. She left to ask Holden if he could take the kids while Damian and she vacationed.\n\n\nAt Deerbrook, Meg put on a show for Dr. Wilson, who said that her evaluation that day might be her ticket home. He gave her a pill and left. Sharkey, the orderly working for Damian, peeked into Meg's room and saw her hiding her medication beneath her pillow.\n\n\nMeg called Damian to taunt him. She said that after her evaluation that day, she could show him in person what he meant to her, just as they'd discussed.\n\n\n       \nDamian went to Deerbrook and berated Sharkey for not keeping Meg under control, as Damian had paid Sharkey to do. Damian worried that the hospital would release Meg, but Sharkey responded, \"Not if they find meds in her bedding.\"\n\n\n       \nMeg looked through her window and saw Damian give Sharkey money. Damian entered her room, and she raged at him for bribing the orderly. Damian said he'd done everything in his power to make sure that she'd never leave that place. He was disgusted with himself for allowing a woman like her into his bed. \"If only I had burned it with you in it!\" Meg rasped and jerked off her bed sheets. Dr. Wilson entered in time to see her pills fly out of the bedding.\n\n\n       \nMeg begged Dr. Wilson to understand that she'd stopped taking the medications because she'd realized that she was better. Meg asserted that Damian had bribed Sharkey in the hallway. Dr. Wilson didn't believe her, but she pleaded with him not to let Damian get away with it. Meg lurched at Damian, and Sharkey restrained her as the pitying doctor watched.\n\n\n       \nMolly attempted to bake a cake at the farm, but Holden distracted her with a make-out session upstairs. Lily entered the kitchen and grimaced at Molly's cake. Molly returned to the kitchen, and Lily said that Molly couldn't compete with Emma in the kitchen. Molly remarked that she was pretty good at satisfying Holden's sweet tooth.\n\n\nHolden entered, and Lily said she'd stopped by to discuss the kids; however, it could wait until after he'd \"finished dessert.\" Lily stomped out, and Molly recounted what had just happened with her and Lily. Holden didn't care that Lily knew about his sex life, but he wanted to find out if Lily had wanted to discuss a problem with the kids. After Holden pursued Lily out the door, Molly huffed that she needed something stronger than chocolate, and she left the house.\n\n\n       \nHolden tracked Lily down in Old Town to talk, but Lily wasn't interested in discussing his \"sweet tooth.\" She couldn't believe that Holden had chosen to date Molly, but Holden retorted that Lily had married Damian twice. Lily thought that Holden deserved better than Molly's \"domestic goddess\" routine. Holden retorted that Damian wasn't a saint. The two wondered why they were bickering, and Holden asked why she'd gone to the farm.\n\n\nLily said that she'd wanted to ask Holden to watch the kids while she and Damian vacationed, but the trip was a bad idea. Holden told Lily not to cancel her trip just because he was dating Molly. Lily seemed disingenuous when she claimed that wasn't the reason, and Holden figured that a pregnant Lily wouldn't be satisfied unless Holden was pining away for her.\n\n\nLily replied that she wasn't pregnant, and she remarked on her ambivalence about having a baby. Holden urged her to take the trip while he, Molly, and Emma watched the kids. Holden advised Lily to realize that Molly was a part of his life. Lily apologized for her attitude but refused to retract her statements about Molly.\n\n\nLily returned home and took a call from Dr. Wilson, who explained what had happened with Meg that day. Damian entered as Lily ended her call, and Lily stated that for someone who wanted Meg out of their lives, Damian certainly spent a lot of time with her. Damian explained that after Meg had threatened him, he'd gone to Deerbrook to see if she'd really be released. He said that Meg had lunged at him and ripped up her bed sheets. Damian felt confident that after Dr. Wilson had seen Meg's pills flying everywhere, Meg's deception was finally under control.\n\n\n       \nDamian asked if Lily had given more thought to their trip, and she replied that Holden would care for the kids if they still wanted to go away. Damian figured that there was nothing standing in their way. They hugged each other, but Lily looked unconvinced.\n\n\nHolden returned to the farm and saw that Molly had left. He found her drinking at Metro later. Molly remarked that she was bad at making cakes, and Holden said that it was her only flaw. She asked how things had gone with Lily, and Holden said it could have been worse.\n\n\nMolly stated that it had taken Holden two seconds to run after Lily, and Holden replied that he'd needed to explain to Lily about \"us.\" Molly seemed flattered that he referred to them as an \"us.\" She was further flattered when he said that Lily had asked if \"we\" could take care of the kids while she vacationed with Damian. Molly warned him that people would soon know about them, and Holden asked her to move her things into his room at the farm.\n\n\nHolden and Molly got a table, and Holden noticed Sharkey making out with a woman on a loveseat. Molly and Holden recognized him as a Deerbrook orderly. Sharkey ordered his second $250 bottle of champagne, and Molly remarked that it was a steep price on Sharkey's salary.\n \n\n\n",
