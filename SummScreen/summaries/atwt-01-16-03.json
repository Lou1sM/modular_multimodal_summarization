Paul asks if they are her clothes and Lily tells him that they are Rose's clothes and she is coming home.  Paul asks when is she coming back and Lily asks if tomorrow is soon enough.  Lily tells him that she thought they could all go to the airport to meet her.  Paul says that he will pass.  Lily tells him that if he doesn't go to the airport, she will think that he doesn't care.  Paul says that he is not the one that doesn't care.  He tells Lily that during the trial with James he kept saying that he was glad that Rose wasn't there, but deep down inside, he needed her to be there.  He adds that he was there for her.  Lily says that he is upset and hurt and she doesn't blame him for feeling that way, but she knows that Rose loves him and if he doesn't go to the airport it will be like saying that he doesn't care.  He says that Rose had called off their relationship, not him.  Paul tells Lily that he has to go see Will at the hospital.  Lily stops him and asks what is she supposed to tell Rose when he is not at the airport.  He says that she can tell her whatever she wants.  She asks if she should tell her the truth that he is so afraid of getting hurt that he is pretending not to care.  Paul just looks at her.  Lily tells him to think about it and don't let his pride get in the way.  Paul says that he won't and he walks out the door.  When he gets outside, he says, \"Sorry Rose.  It's just better this way.\"\n\n\nCarly and Jack are discussing their trip to Cancun when the phone rings and it is Mike.  He tells Carly that Molly is suspicious and she needs to tell Molly about her pregnancy.  Carly tells him to go ahead and tell her.  Mike says that he can't because she will want to know why he knows before she does.  Carly says that she will take care of it.  When she hangs up the phone, Jack asks what will she take care of.  Carly tells him that Mike was on the phone and he thinks that she should tell Molly about her pregnancy.  Jack says that she should tell Molly and he is surprised that she was not the second person that she told.  Then, he adds, that maybe there is a reason why she didn't want to tell her.  Carly says that the reason she hasn't told Molly is that she will want to know the due date and have a shower and redecorate the nursery.  She tells Jack that they need some down time.  Jack says that he knows that and that is why they are going on a honeymoon.  He asks Carly if Molly was pregnant, wouldn't she want to know.  She says that she understands that but she just wanted to keep this simple and private.  \n\n\nCraig tells Rosanna that he has an answer to her proposal.  Rosanna stops him and tells him that she is withdrawing her proposal.  Craig asks if she doesn't want to marry him now.  She tells him that she doesn't want to get married in foreseeable future.  She explains that in the last few weeks she has been off balance and she thought getting married would even everything out.  She goes on to say that being with him is like riding on a wonderful roller coaster and she just wants to keep getting back in line for it.  She also tells him that she feels that their relationship is on a whole new level.  Craig asks if the new level has a name and Rosanna says, \"Honesty.\"  She explains that he was honest about his night with Carly and that caused him to lose a lot.  She says that she got ahead of herself and she feels like she put him on the spot with the marriage proposal.  He says that it did force him to take a good hard look at their relationship.  She says that explains the \"deer in the headlights\" look.  He says that he came to see her expecting to have another conversation.  She tells him maybe next time and they have something else to discuss and that is Monte Carlo.  Craig tells her that Monte Carlo is a thing of the past.  Rosanna explains that when she found out about his night with Carly she had to have her tantrum and her five minutes of revenge, but she is giving Monte Carlo back to him.  Craig asks if she is putting any stipulations on this return.  She tells him that the only thing that she wants is to work more closely with him.  He asks her if she wants to work as partners.  She says in every sense of the word.  He says that he has never known forgiveness like this.  She tells him that no one has loved him as much as she does.  They kiss and then he asks what is going through her beautiful mind.  She says that she was thinking of asking him to marry her again.  Craig gets nervous and pours himself a glass of water.  Rosanna tells him to relax.  She is not going to propose to him again.  She asks if he will please return to Monte Carlo.  He tells her that he doesn't want to just take Monte Carlo.  He tells her that he wants to give her, her hearts desire.  She asks what would that be.  He tells her that she is more to him than any woman he has known and she knocks him out of his orbit.  He says that he came there with a specific purpose and then she takes back her proposal and gives him Monte Carlo without any conditions.  He says that he wants to get back to her marriage proposal.  She says that they have beaten that subject to death.  He says it has an after life.  He asks her if she is curious about his answer.  He tells her that he said no to her proposal because he is a traditional guy.  She looks at him like she doesn't know where he is going with this.  He says that in his tradition the man asks the woman to marry him.  Craig gets down on one knee and says, \"Rosanna Cabot, will you do me the indescribable honor of becoming by wife?\"  Rosanna says yes and then falls to her knees and into his arms and they start to kiss.\n\n\nTom and Margo meet Katie and Simon at the Lakeview.  Tom tells Simon that he has looked into his problem in Australia but he can't represent him because he is not a U.S. citizen.  Tom suggests that Simon go back to school and get his citizenship and then he can help him with his case.  Margo and Tom give Simon a packet of information and forms to fill out.  They tell him to think about it and give Tom a call tomorrow.  Margo tells Katie that this is Simon's call.  Katie says that she will let him make the decision.  After Tom and Margo leave, Katie starts making all kinds of plans about getting books for Simon and making him lunch to take to school.  Simon tells her to slow down.  She says that this is the opportunity they have been waiting for and the faster they get started the quicker he can become an American citizen.  \n\n\nMolly and Mike are sitting all cozy by the fire at their house and talking about taking a trip of their own.  Carly knocks on the door and when Molly opens the door, Carly apologizes and says that it looks like she interrupted a pajama party.  Molly tells her not to be silly.  Carly asks if they can talk and Mike says that he will leave and call Jack to meet him for a beer.  After Mike is gone, Carly tells Molly that there is something that she should know.  Molly says that she knew something was going on.  Carly turns to her cousin and says, \"Jack and I are having a baby.\"  Molly eyes widen and she says, \"You're pregnant? Are you sure?\"  Carly says that she is positive.  Carly goes on to say that Jack was so upset when he lost J.J., but since she has told him that she is having a baby, he has been bouncing off the walls.  Carly looks at her cousin and asks if she is going to say anything.  Molly asks what should she say.  Carly says that she should say, \"congratulations, Carly\", \"I'm happy for you, Carly\".  Molly pipes in and says, \"Are you crazy, Carly?  What if this baby is not Jack's?  What if this baby is Craig's?\"  At first, Carly tries to argue with Molly about who the father of her baby is.  But Molly has too many arguments.  Carly explains to Molly that her life is always a mess.  She says that she gets something good and then she messes it up.  She tells her cousin that she took the coward's way out and told Jack the baby is his.  Molly asks if it is possible that Jack is the father.  Carly says that she has been spending her day praying that her birth control failed.  Carly looks at Molly and says that no has to know.  Molly tells her that she (Carly) will know.  Molly asks about what happens if the baby gets sick and has to go to the doctor.  She reminds Carly that is what happened with J.J.  Then Molly brings up Rosanna.  She says that if Rosanna finds out she will instantly bring up the Craig factor.  Carly tells Molly that she had done some damage control on that aspect.  She tells her cousin about visiting Rosanna and telling her that she was \"barely\" pregnant and she painted the picture of Auntie Rosanna being there for birthdays and Christmas mornings.  Molly tells her to stop before she gets sick.  Molly reminds Carly that all is good except when she delivers a preemie that outweighs all the babies in the nursery.  Carly says that there is nothing she can do about that.  She says that if Rosanna is in full \"Auntie\" mode and Craig marries her.  Molly tells her to back it up.  Molly asks if Craig and Rosanna are getting married.  Carly says that she is not sure but she did tell him to \"buy the cow\".  Carly starts on a rampage and says that she doesn't need Rosanna on her back wondering if the baby is Jack's or if it is Mike's!  Molly stops her and says, \"Carly!  You just said this baby could be Mike's!\"  Carly makes an excuse that her brain has gone to mush.  She explains that with everything that has gone on the past few months she just isn't thinking straight.  Carly picks up the TV remote control and says that she needs this for her life.  She tells Molly that she could just change the channels of her life.  Carly tells Molly that she thinks that Craig is really in love.  She goes on to say that if Craig and Rosanna do get married, maybe they will be busy with each other and stay out of her business.  She says that with a little luck and the help from her friends she can pull this off.  \n\n\nMike walks into Java Underground and sits at the bar to wait for Jack.
