But before she goes, she gives Mike a surprise gift.  He opens the small box and finds a watch.  He wears it for about five seconds, and then she takes it off again because she wants to inscribe something special on the watch. She thinks that when he's \"looking down at the watch you can think about how much you mean to me.\"\n\n\nCarly spies on Mitzi as she checks into the Lakeview.  Mitzi flashes her newfound cash around and rents the Royal Suite for $500.  Carly's peepers nearly fall out of her head.  After Mitzi strolls away to the gift shop, Carly writes a check for $500 to buy from the clerk the hundred dollar bills Mitzi used.  She has ideas about tracking the serial numbers on the bills.  As soon as the clerk hands Carly the money, Mitzi returns.  Mitzi grabs Carly's arm and demands to know what she's up to.  Carly says, \"I'm watching a fast mover.  For a girl who didn't have two nickels to rub together yesterday, you sure are throwing around a lot of cash today...where'd you get it?\"  Mitzi tries to walk away, but Carly warns her she will get to the bottom of Mitzi's story one way or another.\n\n\nCraig visits Margo and he tries to pump her for the latest info on Rose's murder case.  Jack steps in and says they have an APB out on Barbara, but he won't say why.  Craig simmers, straining for information, but Margo cuts him off.  Jack, having a rare upper hand, taunts him.  Craig gets a call from Mitzi who demands to see him.\n\n\nMitzi and Craig meet up at his home.  He tries to calm Mitzi, but she threatens to bring him down with her if she is exposed.  Craig says he doesn't respond well to threats, and Mitzi says she doesn't look good in orange.  Craig boils everything down to this, \"It's her hunch against your word.\"  With no one to disprove Mitzi's word, Mitzi can't get in trouble.\n\n\nCarly shows the cash to Jack and tells her husband she thinks Mitzi is in cahoots with Craig.  She thinks Craig paid Mitzi to tell her story about Paul.  Carly finds herself in a familiar pickle.  She wants to warn her sister about Craig's behavior, but she doesn't want to seem like a home-wrecker.\n\n\nMike asks Henry to meet him to go jewelry shopping.  They spend time looking at several different pieces.  Later, Henry is worn out and Mike lets him leave.  Ten minutes later, Mike finds a perfect gift...an engagement ring.\n\n\nPaul starts to put two and two together and asks Rosanna to create a diversion so he can escape the courthouse unnoticed.  Later, Rosanna starts to throw a fit, until she faints.  Everyone rushes to her aide, and Paul slips away.  It takes Hal ten seconds to notice Paul is missing, then he rushes after him.  Jen tries to stop her father.  Hal tells his daughter he won't pursue Paul with a bunch of uniforms.  An officer alerts Hal that Barbara was spotted near his house.  Hal rushes home.  Back inside, Dusty asks Ro where Paul went.  Rosanna denies knowing anything about Paul's plans.  Lily has a meltdown.  \"I hope you can live with yourself!  You!  You are keeping Rose from moving on!!  Nobody understands that Rose cannot rest!\"  She runs out of the room, and Dusty follows.  She collapses into his arms and sobs.  Dusty vows to make Paul pay for Rose's murder.\n\n\nEmily lays limp on the floor with the bloodied rolling pin nearby.\n\n\nKatie visits Margo for lunch.  As Katie looks at a menu, Margo notices her naked ring finger.  Katie announces her love for Mike and Margo is excited.  Katie says, \"Simon is my past, and Mike is my future.\"\n\n\nPaul arrives at Hal's place looking for Will, but finds Emily clinging to life.  Paul calls for an ambulance.  He gently slaps at Emily's face to try to keep her conscious.  He asks if Barbara injured her.  Emily gasps, \"I know....I know where they are...\"  When Hal arrives with Jen, Paul tells him EMS has been called.  Jen goes upstairs to look for Will, and Paul slips away again as Hal strokes his wife's hair.  Later the EMS team takes Emily away on a stretcher.  Hal tells Jen to look for clues where Barbara might have taken Will, and then he follows the ambulance to the hospital.\n\n\nWill and Barbara are in her car driving to a secret location.  Will is concerned about Emily and what's going on.  Barbara says, \"What's going on is that we're leaving Oakdale, right now, for ever.\"  Later, Babs and Will arrive at a helipad.  She says a pilot will soon pick them up and take them to Canada.  Then they will get on a flight to South America.  He wants to know why he didn't go to school today.  She says she admitted to Rose's murder in court and she didn't want him to hear the news from a classmate or on television.  Will realizes she should be in custody right now, and asks her if she escaped.  She asks him to leave the country with her, but he wants to know if there is another way.  Babs says if they stay, she will go to prison and she will never see Will again.  \"Do you love me enough to go?\"  He reluctantly nods his head.  She hugs him tight and says, \"As long as we have each other, we'll be alright.\"  Babs sends her son to the banks of the river to waves his arms at the incoming chopper.  After he's gone, Paul announces his presence.  Barbara is caught of guard.  Paul says, \"You surprised me.  For once in your life you finally told the truth.\"  She pulls at his heartstrings and tells him if he loves Will, he'll leave and never turn back.  He questions her erratic behavior over the past few weeks.  Barbara admits to all those things and more, \"I'm irrational.  I'm unbalanced.  I'm a liar.  I'm a murderer.  And I'm a mother who loves her children and will protect them...leave it at that.\"\n\n\nBarbara and Paul have a conversation the audience isn't privy to, and all of a sudden Barbara is as grounded as she has ever been in more than a year.  She and Paul both know what needs to be done.  She says, \"If you really understand, you need to leave here and not tell anyone the truth.\"  Paul wants to take Will and sort out the details with Hal.  Barbara doesn't consider that an option and presses him to let them go.  \"Do you destroy your family, or do you allow us to survive?\"  Will returns and Paul looks at him with a knowing stare.  \"Mom didn't kill Rose, did she?  Because it was you.\"  Will's lower lip quivers, and Barbara's shriveled heart breaks.\n\n\nAt Katie's place, a hand timidly opens the door to Katie's bedroom.  Simon enters her room, sighs, and leans down on her desk.\n\n\n",
