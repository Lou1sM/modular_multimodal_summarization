He councils her on talking to her family and preparing them for what the treatment entails.  Barbara explains that she hasn't told her sons yet and the doctor insists that Barbara tell Will and Paul right away so they can help their mother through the treatment.   \n\n\nAt home with baby Hallie, Will reminds Gwen to be ready to go to class as soon as the sitter arrives.  Gwen tells Will she isn't going and wants to stay at home with the baby.  Gwen lists numerous reasons for staying with Hallie, but Will reassures his wife that everything will be fine with Hallie and the sitter.  When someone knocks at the door, Will assumes it is the babysitter and is shocked when he opens the door and sees Barbara on his doorstep.   Barbara tells Will and Gwen she needs to talk to them about some disturbing news, but fails to tell them about her cancer and instead informs them of Paul's news about losing the baby with Meg and leaving Rosanna.  When Barbara says the family needs to stick together, Will accuses Barbara of using his brother's tragedy to try to get back into his and Gwen's life.  Will asks his mom to leave, but Gwen says they need to hear her out.  When the baby cries, Will goes to check on her and Gwen kindly sees Barbara out.  Alone, Will tells Gwen he is angry at his mom, but Gwen says she thinks Barbara is genuinely upset.  With the sitter running late, Gwen sends Will to class and stays with the baby.  Gwen gets a call from the sitter explaining that her daughter is ill and she can't come.  Gwen decides to take the baby to class, but changes her mind and calls Alison and Carly to sit for her, but they are unavailable. \n\n\nAfter leaving Will and Gwen's house Barbara sits alone in her car and sobs.   She arrives later at the Lakeview bar and sees Sofie sitting alone.  Sofie gets her first paycheck from Lisa, but when Sofie sees it she realizes the check is too much because the price of her room hasn't been deducted.  Lisa informs her that Barbara has paid for Sofie's room and if she has any questions she should ask her.  Sofie sees Barbara and tears up the check in front of her.  She tells her she won't take anything from her because she can't buy her forgiveness.  She tells Barbara she saw her at the church and that she hopes God can forgive her for all the wrong she has done because she won't.  Lisa sees Barbara is upset and advises her friend to give Sofie time.  Lisa looks at Barbara and tells her that she has noticed that she has sound different lately when she speaks.  She recommends that Barbara sees a doctor and Barbara begins to tell her about her cancer, but changes her mind and tells her she has seen a doctor and he told her to have some dental work done.   Lisa goes to check on the kitchen and Barbara sits alone to think about her life.  \n\n\nSofie arrives at Will and Gwen's house and asks Gwen to tell Barbara to back off and leave her alone.  Gwen lets Sofie in on her babysitting dilemma and Sofie offers to watch Hallie.   \n\n\nEmily walks into her suite to tell Chris about Dusty's latest plot to take him down and she finds Chris and Evan talking.  Evan leaves but tells Chris that he will inform security at the hospital to be ready for Dusty.  Emily seems upset by Dusty's latest accusations and is sure he has something on Chris regarding Bob's stroke.  Chris is disappointed that Emily believes he could poison his father and asks her how Dusty changed her mind.   Emily calms Chris's anxiety and explains that Dusty is determined to bring him down.  Chris tells Emily that with her by his side everything will be fine and then whips out a jewelry box for her.   Emily is taken back thinking it is an engagement ring, but Chris tells her that she shouldn't worry and hands her the box.  Inside she finds a beautiful pair of earrings.  Chris thanks her for helping him to get where he is and tells her he loves her for the first time.    \n\n\nDown in the Lakeview bar, Dusty calls the lab and tells them he needs the results from Bob's cup right away.  He explains he wants to know what was in Bob's drink before the big event at the hospital that evening.  Lucinda walks in and hears Dusty's conversation and condemns Dusty's recent discarding of Lily. Dusty lets Lucinda know he didn't abandon his friend Lily and he is convinced after seeing her recently that she may need her mother's help.   Dusty excuses himself to get ready for the party at Memorial even though Lucinda advices him against going.   \n\n\nAt Yo's, the local bar, Lily is shocked when she learns that Emily used to work for Madame Cheri as a call girl.  She continues her conversation with one of Cheri's former call girls and questions her about whether or not Emily really was a prostitute.  The woman explains that she knew Emily when they both worked for Cheri.  When Lily confirms they are talking about the same Emily, she decides to let Dusty hear the news, but the call girl explains that Dusty knew all about Emily's days as a hooker and even threatened Cheri if she didn't stop sending Emily out on jobs.   Lily is filled with anger and ready to make Emily suffer for coming between her and Dusty.   \n\n\nLily arrives outside Chris and Emily's door and stops before knocking to take one more pill from the stash she got earlier from the bartender.  Just as she gains her composure to knock on their door, Dusty arrives and demands to know what she is doing there.   Lily tells Dusty that she is ready to tell Chris the truth that Emily was once a hooker.  Dusty grabs Lily and takes her downstairs to talk.  Dusty asks how Lily found out and she asks him if he fell in love with Emily while she was turning tricks.  Dusty notices that Lily is not acting like herself and seems to be drunk or on drugs.  He asks her what she is taking and Lily denies being on anything, but tells him she learned the truth while having a drink at Yo's.  Dusty tells Lily that if she tells anyone about Emily that the two will never be friends again.  When Lily hears this she just laughs in Dusty's face.  She goes on to explain that they aren't friends anymore and that she is doing this for him because Chris will dump Emily and she will run back to him.  When Lily gets up to go she stumbles and Dusty takes her to her room to sleep off her drunkenness.  Up in her room, Dusty puts Lily to bed and before she passes out she asks Dusty to stay with her, but changes her mind and tells him to get out.  Once Dusty thinks Lily has passed out, he leaves.  Moments later the phone rings and wakes Lily up.  \n\n\nIn their room, Emily and Chris start to make love, but Emily has flashbacks of her night with Dusty and stops Chris with the excuse that she needs time to get ready for the party.  Emily emerges from the bathroom ready for the big event and Chris feels lucky to have Emily as his date for the party.  The two kiss and Emily realizes she needs to fix her makeup before they go and returns to the bathroom.  Chris looks at the hotel door just as a note is being slid under.  When Emily comes back into the room Chris tells her that he just got a note about her and Emily looks scared.   Emily tries to guess what the letter might say and she is shocked when Chris tells her it says she used to be a hooker.  Outside the room Lily listens in as Chris and Emily talk and runs away as her phone rings again.  Chris tells Emily he is going to call Margo to stop this horrible filth from being spewed at them, but Emily hangs up the phone and tells him not to make the call.   Emily tells Chris that it isn't a lie and she hoped that he would never find out.  Chris is staggered by Emily's confession and doesn't understand how Emily could do such a thing.  Emily tries to explain why she was a hooker, but Chris is disgusted by her confession and her deception by not telling him about her past.  He questions her about how many men she with, but is interrupted by a call from Evan asking why he isn't at the party yet.  Chris tells Emily he can't talk to her and that she shouldn't come with him to the party.  Emily is left alone in their room to try to figure out who sent Chris the note. She thinks back on a conversation with Dusty and believes he is the one behind the letter. \n\n\nLily takes the most recent call to her phone and talks to Lucinda about her life.  Lucinda questions what is going on with her daughter and Lily tells her everything is fine and now that she is over Dusty. Lucinda is happy to hear that Lily is getting away from Dusty and asks if she will attend the party at Memorial.  Lily claims to be in a mood to celebrate and pops another pill before heading out to meet her mom.     \n\n\nChris arrives at Memorial and runs into Evan and Lucinda.  Lucinda criticizes Evan for working with Craig and walks away.  Evan asks Chris why he is so moody and Chris explains he had a fight with Emily and needs to find her.  \n\n\nLucinda finds Lily and congratulates her on looking so happy.  Lily has a glass of wine and tells her mom she has taken control of her life back.  Chris asks Lucinda and Lily if they have seen Emily and they say they haven't and Lucinda offers Chris advice to focus on work and not his love life.  Lily then sneaks away to take another pill.  \n\n\nDusty arrives at the party and is immediately pulled into a room by Emily who shows him the note and asks why he hates her.  Dusty says he didn't do it and if Chris loves her there shouldn't be a problem.   Dusty wants to know how Chris reacted and Emily tells him that once Chris gets over the shock he will forgive her.  Dusty comments that Emily could have never made love to him like she did on New Year's if she didn't love him.  Just as he finishes the sentence the two hear the door behind them slam and see an angry Chris staring at them.   \n\n\n",
