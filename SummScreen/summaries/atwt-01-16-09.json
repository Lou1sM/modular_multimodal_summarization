Tom told Dusty he had made it clear to Craig's attorney that the informal visitations they had relied on thus far were off the table. Dusty figured if he pushed Craig hard enough, Craig would go after him, and that would be Dusty's chance to get Craig out of Johnny's life. \n\n\nCraig took a box of donuts to Margo at the police station. Craig asked if he should file an accident report, and when Margo asked what accident he was referring to, he told her about having pushed Parker and Johnny out of the way of a car the day before. Margo said that was heroic, and asked whether Craig had hired a photographer to take pictures of his bravery. She then revealed that Jack had told her about the incident. Craig asked what it would take for people to realize he wasn't the scourge of the world, and Margo said, \"Stop scourging.\" \n\n\nAt home, Katie told Brad she wasn't mad at him anymore for having told Dusty about her phony alibi for Craig. However, Katie wanted Brad to promise to stop trying to have her brother put in jail. Katie said Craig was her brother, and she just wanted to put the whole thing behind them. Brad said that he couldn't do that. Katie left, saying she was going to get some advice from the only other person in town who cared about Craig. \n\n\nCraig went to the Lakeview, where he ran into Dusty, Tom, and Johnny. As he started to approach Johnny, Dusty grabbed him and asked whether he had spoken to his attorney. Dusty told him he was cutting off Craig's visits with Johnny, but Craig pulled out some paperwork from his jacket. He handed it to Dusty, telling him he didn't think that was going to happen. Tom looked over the papers, which he himself had prepared for Craig a few years earlier. They were the preliminary court orders establishing visitation between Craig and Johnny. Tom said that since the original orders had never been rescinded, they still stood as the legal arrangement. \n\n\nCraig then asked if Johnny wanted to go to the park and ride on a kids' train. Dusty grabbed Craig's arm and said he wasn't going to let Craig take Johnny anywhere. Craig said Tom should prevent his client from doing something stupid. Tom agreed and told Dusty that he shouldn't make a scene. When Johnny walked up between Dusty and Craig, Dusty let go of Craig's arm. Dusty tried to talk Johnny into not going with Craig, but Johnny wanted to go right away. Dusty reluctantly agreed and told Craig to call him in two hours to pick up Johnny. \n\n\nDusty asked Tom to tell him again what his options were with regard to Craig. Tom said they could work out a mutually agreeable visitation arrangement, or they could petition the court to make Dusty the sole legal guardian of Johnny. However, Tom didn't think the second strategy would work, because Craig was Johnny's biological father and had shown no signs of abusing or endangering his child. Dusty said in that case, he would handle things his way, and he left. \n\n\nJack showed up at Carly's with a large present for Parker. She thought it was Craig when she opened the door, because Jack was holding the box in front of his face, and it was very big, like something Craig would bring. Jack said he and Janet had packed a box full of things for Parker to use while he was home in bed. Carly told Jack that Parker had gone to school, despite the doctor's permission to stay home for a day or two. Jack commented on how great Carly looked and wondered whether she had been expecting Craig. Carly told Jack she had a meeting with a special event planner for something at Metro. Jack asked if Craig had set up the meeting. Carly told Jack he had to stop walking into her house and waving his married bliss in her face, then attacking her for her dealings with Craig. She reminded Jack that Craig had just saved Parker's life, and she didn't understand why Jack wanted her to treat Craig like he had the plague. \n\n\nJack said anything Craig was doing, from buying gifts for the kids to saving Parker to loaning Carly the money to keep Metro in business, was all part of some strategy. Carly asked what Jack thought Craig was after, since she was a divorced mom with three kids, a big mortgage, a failing business, and a pain-in-the-rear ex-husband. Jack told Carly to look in the mirror. The doorbell rang, and it was Craig and Johnny. Johnny had wanted to thank Parker for looking out for him, but Carly said Parker wasn't there. Craig asked if he and Johnny could come in to warm up for a minute, and Carly took Johnny to the kitchen to get some cookies. \n\n\nCraig asked Jack why he always looked like he had just swallowed a bunch of lemons. Jack said Craig did that to him. Jack then tried to get Craig to go ahead and leave, but instead, Carly walked back in and told Jack she would give Parker his present and see Jack later. Jack left. Craig asked Carly why she put up with Jack, and she said she tried to get along with him for the sake of the kids. Craig said Jack was obviously happily married, and Carly should be, too. \n\n\nDusty went to Brad's house to talk to him about Craig. Brad said he couldn't go after Craig without getting into more trouble with Katie. Dusty said after all that Craig had done to them, he couldn't believe Brad was just going to sit by and let Craig get away with it. Brad pointed out that Katie had perjured herself to provide Craig's alibi, but Dusty said since Craig had blackmailed Katie, nobody would arrest or convict her for that. Dusty suggested they ask Jack for his opinion, and he and Brad left to find Jack. \n\n\nKatie met Margo at Java. Katie asked Margo hypothetically what would happen if someone lied to the police to protect someone they loved. Margo asked if she meant like if Katie had lied about Craig's alibi to protect herself or Brad. Katie said it was something like that. Margo said the someone who lied would probably get off, but the other person would go straight to jail. She then asked if Katie wanted to make a statement. Katie said yes, but she wasn't going to say anything that would get their brother thrown into jail. Margo couldn't believe it. Katie said she thought they owed their brother the chance to be a father to Johnny. Margo pointed out that Craig had committed attempted murder, although Katie pointed out that they didn't know that for sure. Margo said Craig had framed Brad, blackmailed Katie, and done other things that made him an unlikely candidate to be a good father to anyone. Katie thought Craig had learned from his mistakes and deserved the chance to be with Johnny. \n\n\nDusty and Brad went to the police station to talk to Jack. Jack's response was basically the same as Margo's. Jack called Margo and told her Brad was about to make a statement about Katie's alibi for Craig. Margo said she would find Craig and bring him and Katie to the station. Jack suggested she try Carly's place. Margo hung up and told Katie what Brad was doing, and Katie rushed out of Java. \n\n\nJohnny lay down for a nap at Carly's. Craig asked why Carly had covered Johnny with Craig's coat. She said that when Johnny woke up in a strange place, he would see Craig's coat and know that Craig hadn't left him there. Craig told Carly she really did know a lot about kids, and Carly said she'd had lots of practice. Margo came to the door and told Craig that Brad was about to blow Craig's alibi out of the water. Margo said that it was tearing Katie apart, because Katie loved Brad, but for some strange reason, she actually still loved Craig, too. Craig said that he hadn't coerced Katie into saying anything. Margo said that the right thing to do would be to go to the station with her and make sure Katie wasn't in any legal jeopardy. Craig said he would think about it, and Margo left. When Carly asked Craig what he intended to do, he said he hadn't decided yet. Carly responded that she would never have anything to do with him again if he didn't go help Katie \n\n\nCraig asked if he went to the station, did the right thing, and managed to stay out of jail, would Carly marry him? Carly said Craig was crazy, but Craig said if Carly really thought he should help Katie, then Carly should take the chance to help, too. Carly pointed out that Craig was trying to blackmail her. Craig asked Carly why she had married Jack. Carly said she had loved him. Craig asked why Jack had divorced her. Carly said because Jack was good, and she wasn't. Craig said he couldn't vouch for the person Carly was when she first married Jack, but the woman in front of him was a good, decent person. He told Carly that Bryant, his son, had died because he hadn't been there for Bryant, and Lucy had run away because he hadn't been there for her. Craig said he wanted to be there for Johnny. Carly said he could start by being there for Katie. \n\n\nCraig agreed to go to the station and make sure Katie wasn't in any trouble. Carly told him she was proud of him. Craig then said that if he did go through with it and make a statement to the police, he wanted to know whether Carly would at least think about marrying him. Carly agreed to think about it. \n\n\nKatie went to the police station and yelled at Dusty for interfering in her life and Brad's. Brad took Katie into the interrogation room to talk to her. Dusty left to find Tom. Katie told Brad she didn't want to pursue charges against Craig. Brad said Craig had tried to murder Paul, but Katie said nobody knew that for sure. Margo and Jack walked in, and Margo congratulated Katie on doing the right thing. \n\n\nBrad proceeded to tell Margo and Jack what Craig had done in faking Spencer McKay's murder and framing Brad for it, as well as about Craig's attempt to blackmail Katie into providing an alibi for him. Margo asked Katie if that was true, but Katie wouldn't answer. Katie asked Margo for a glass of water, and Margo stepped out to get one. \n\n\nDusty met Tom at Java and asked what would happen if Craig went to prison for attempted murder. Tom said a judge would probably make Dusty take Johnny to see Craig occasionally for visitations, but by the time Craig got out of prison, Johnny would be old enough to make his own decisions about whether or not to see Craig. Tom warned Dusty that in his zeal to hurt Craig, he was robbing himself of valuable time with his son. Dusty told Tom that he had promised Jennifer he would raise Johnny himself and keep Johnny away from Craig. Tom said that the way Dusty was doing that, he was teaching Johnny to hate Craig. Tom said that no matter what Dusty said, his actions showed Johnny how much he hated Craig. Tom thought that Johnny would grow up hating Craig in order to please Dusty, but when he was older, he might hate Dusty for having made that decision for him. \n\n\nDusty and Tom went to the station and asked if Katie had made her statement yet. Craig and Johnny came in and saw everyone there. Johnny ran to Katie and told her his daddy had taken him to see a train. Katie took Johnny into the interrogation room to talk to him. Craig told Dusty and Tom that he had come to the station because Margo had told him that Katie might need his help. Dusty became angry with Craig again, but Tom reminded Dusty that Johnny was in the next room. Craig suggested Dusty take Johnny back to the hotel, and Craig went into the interrogation room. He told Johnny how much fun he'd had with him that day, and he asked Johnny to remember it in case he didn't see him for a while. He hugged Johnny. \n\n\nMargo walked in and told Johnny to go out and see his daddy. Katie got up and walked out of the room, saying she couldn't make a statement against her brother. As she walked past Tom and Dusty, they asked what had happened. Craig said Katie apparently had not had as much to say as they had all anticipated. When Dusty asked about Brad's statement, Tom said that was hearsay and wouldn't hold up in court. \n\n\nMargo pointed out that the station was no place for a little boy, and she suggested Dusty take Johnny home. Craig picked Johnny up and hugged him and said he would see him soon. Dusty left with Johnny and Tom. Margo asked Craig if he had really come in to get Katie off the hook. Craig said from what he had seen and heard, Katie didn't need any help. Craig said it appeared that he and Katie were both sticking with their stories, and Jack and Margo would just have to deal with it. \n\n\nDusty took Johnny back to the hotel, where he asked Johnny if he'd had fun with Craig and if he had liked the train. Johnny just nodded both times, so Dusty asked if Johnny had lost his tongue, saying maybe they needed to go back outside to find it. Johnny laughed and hugged Dusty, saying, \"I like having two daddies!\" \n\n\nBrad and Katie went home, where Katie told Brad she couldn't be the one responsible for taking Craig away from Johnny again. Brad complained that Craig had put Brad through complete hell and then forced Katie to help Craig, and Brad couldn't understand why Katie was giving Craig a total pass. Katie said that Brad was making it sound like she was choosing Craig over him, and she would never do that. Brad retorted, \"You already have,\" and walked away. \n\n\nCraig went to see Carly and gave her a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine, saying, \"The victor returns!\" Craig said Carly had to marry him, because she'd agreed to do that if he helped Katie. Carly pointed out that she had only said she would think about it. Craig said the fact that Carly had left herself a loophole showed how perfect they were for one another. He asked if she had thought about it. Carly paused, said she had, and the answer was still \"no.\" Craig took the wine and left, saying he would give her the chance to think some more. He kissed her on the cheek on his way out the door.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig tries to bribe Margo with donuts. He offers to give a statement about yesterday with his role in the Parker and Johnny incident. He forgoes his visitation rights and pushes his way past Dusty to see Johnny in the dining room. Tom advises Dusty not to thwart this, it won't help his case. Dusty is forced to allow Craig to take Johnny for a couple of hours. Jack and Carly get into a shouting match over Craig being near their children. He insists it is not Craig's kindness, but his own strategy and he won't stand for it. Craig shows up with Johnny, his excuse is he wanted to thank Parker in person. Without being asked, he comes on in, spying Jack who is none too pleased after what he just said about Craig. Craig tells him every time he sees him, it looks like he has sucked a whole tree of lemons. Carly dismisses Jack. Craig quips that anytime she wants to get rid of Jack, just call him. He walks in, Jack walks out. Jack is happily married, she needs to be too. Brad tells Katie that he has a problem with her brother. Dusty drops in on Brad and there is nothing more Brad would like to do than nail Craig to the wall. Margo and Katie are on opposite sides as to how to treat or forgive their brother for his mistakes. Jack calls Margo that his brother is going to make a statement about her brother; they need to talk. Margo tracks down Craig at Carly's and as a courtesy call she tells him that she will put Katie's marriage and life in jeopardy until he confesses. Carly makes it easier. She vows unless he helps his sister that Carly will have nothing to do with Craig ever again. He got Katie into this mess; he will have to get her out. She calls him crazy when he asks if he helps his sister, will she marry him then. She's good, decent and loving and he wants his son to grow up happy and healthy. He doesn't want to ruin things like with Bryant and Lucy. He's going to help Katie, so he wants Carly to at least give some thought to his proposal. Jack tells Dusty that he has to fill out paperwork, but Craig should be arrested before the end of the day. Katie is mad that Brad and Dusty appointed themselves as judge and jury against Craig. A show-down ensues at the police station when Craig shows up with Johnny and Dusty accuses him of using his son for his own cause. Craig hugs Johnny and tells him what a great time he had with him today. Katie storms out saying she can not do this. Margo asks Dusty to get Johnny out of here. Craig tells Margo that he likes family gatherings, but next time let him pick the place. Katie shouts to Brad that she was going to tell the truth, but when she saw Craig with Johnny, she could not take that away from him. It doesn't have to change things between her and Brad. Craig returns to Carly with flowers and champagne. He wants to take some wedding pictures. She's not going to change her mind, and he vows that he won't give up.",
