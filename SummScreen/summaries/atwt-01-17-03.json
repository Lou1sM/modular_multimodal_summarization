She's excited about their lunch date, but Aaron cancels the plans because has to run to a job interview.  Alison tells him Lucy was released earlier in the day.  He asks for her advice because he gave a nurse at the desk a letter to pass along to Lucy.  She tells him he's beginning to act like a stalker.\n\n\nCraig and Lucy get back to their suite at the Lakeview and meet the new live-in therapist, Gloria.  Lucy is depressed and tired from the trip home from the hospital.  They agree to begin therapy once she's all settled.  Craig takes off to finish some work.  Once the therapist is out of the room, Lucy opens her bag and pulls out Aaron's letter.  In the letter, Aaron tells her it's OK if she doesn't remember him, just as long as she doesn't forget herself.  Lucy is re-energized after reading Aaron's words, and when the therapist returns, she is eager to start her rehabilitation.\n\n\nMike zips into his home looking for some missing floor plans.  He finds the documents, and leaves Molly in the dust.  Molly calls Jack and fishes for info into Mike's recent behavior because he came home agitated the night before.  Jack tells her that he broke up a fight between Mike and Henry at Java.  Carly sneaks downstairs as Jack is hanging up the phone.  Jack tells Carly everything he just told Molly, then he runs off to finish some errands.  Carly calls Mike's cell phone, but gets his voice-mail and doesn't leave a message.  The doorbell rings, and Craig is at the door.  He tells Carly that Monte Carlo is back on track, and that he proposed to Rosanna.  He tells Carly Rosanna said yes, and that she better roll out the welcome wagon \" \u2018cause we're gonna be in-laws.\"  Carly has little interest in rejoining Monte Carlo.  Craig presses further, but Carly blurts out that she won't come back because she's pregnant.  It takes Craig exactly two seconds before he asks Carly if her baby is Jack's or Mike's.\n\n\nBack at the psyche ward, Barbara apologizes for losing control...again.  Hal puts her in her place, and they move on.  Will returns and says he'll be busy for the next hour or so with a group therapy session.  Hal and Barbar happily agree to wait for him.  Dr. Michaels asks Hal for information about the formal investigation into the fire.  She wants details of the event because she thinks Will is hiding something.  Hal nods his head.  Later, Barbara beats it into Hal's head that Will needs his father, not a cop, at times like this.  Hal just wants to get to the truth.\n\n\nRose gets off the airplane and looks around for her welcoming committee.  Surprisingly, she finds Paul.  They gingerly dance around their feelings about where she has been for the past few months, but ultimately give each other a hug.  Paul tells her he \"wasn't going to come at all...but I had to see you.\"  Rose doesn't like hearing that.  He wants to know why she's \"still wearing my ring.\"  Rose looks at the engagement ring, and says, \"Well, because you put it there.  You said you would always be mine.  I hope that's still true.\"  She doesn't want to have this conversation right now, but Paul presses her for answers.  She tells him her life was going so fast that she needed time to sort things out.  She never stopped thinking about him.  This isn't good enough for Paul, and he starts to walk away, Rose tells him she thought he didn't love her anymore because he never called her when he was on trial for murder.  Paul stops in his tracks.  They both say the love they have for each other is still alive, but there is a lot of work to do to rebuild the chemistry that was lost.  Rose pulls off the engagement ring and asks, \"What do we do with this?\"\n\n\nAlison waits in the wings as Aaron is interviewed at the car garage.  The manager likes what he sees, but wants to have a certified mechanic on staff.  He offers Aaron an apprenticeship, but Aaron is hesitant.  Alison chimes in and offers to help out around the place for free if she hires Aaron.  Bert gives them both the job.  Aaron isn't happy that Alison helped him.  He tells Alison to take another letter to Lucy.  Alison can't believe he wrote another letter to Lucy without knowing how she would react to his first letter.  Her efforts to dissuade him fall on Forrest Gump ears.  She relents and promises to deliver his letter.\n\n\nJack arrives at Molly's, and they start to figure out that Carly's story and Mike's recent attitude don't add up.  They both decide to ignore their feelings and support their loved ones.  Jack steps outside and calls Mike.  He asks Mike to meet him at the cop shop.  Mike agrees.  Later, Mike walks into the station and finds Henry waiting as well.  Henry swears to Mike he hasn't told Jack anything, then Jack pops out and asks to speak with both of them in the interrogation room.  \n\n\nBack in Craig's suite, the therapist tries to moderate Lucy's enthusiasm about her recovery when there's a knock at the door.  Alison arrives for a visit.  Lucy tells her she is excited that Aaron wrote her a letter.  Lucy asks Alison to tell Aaron to come by for a visit sometime.  Alison doesn't mention anything about the second letter that Aaron wrote.  Lucy also asks Alison to give Aaron a letter for her.  Alison agrees, but says she probably won't be able to give him the letter for a few days since he's starting a new job.  Outside the suite, Alison holds both letters in her hand and vows to not deliver either one.\n\n\n",
