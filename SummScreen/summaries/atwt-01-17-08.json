Lily mixes drugs with the wine on the sly and is stunned to see Holden arrive with Bonnie McKechnie.  She greets them and continues to put away several glasses of wine.  Bonnie goes to speak to Kim and Holden questions Lily about her drinking, but Lily reminds him that he no longer has a say in what she does.\n\n\nChris confronts Emily and Dusty.  Dusty tells him that Emily loves him, not Chris, and also lets Chris know that he and Emily slept together on New Year's Eve.  Chris and Emily argue, and Dusty threatens to expose Chris' involvement in his father's stroke.  Tom intercedes and Chris returns to the party.  Emily swears to pay back Dusty, and Margo overhears.\n\n\nSofie volunteers to babysit with Hallie so Gwen can join Will at the lecture.  Gwen agrees and leaves her in charge.  The baby begins to fuss and Sofie gets rattled and calls Aaron at work.  He agrees to come and help out, and shows her how to warm the milk in the bottle.\n\n\nMargo asks Dusty why Chris is so angry with him and Kim wants to know what happened between her son and Emily.  Dusty insists he has proof that Chris put something in Bob's coffee just before his stroke.  Dusty makes a call to his friend Neil and asks for the results from the lab on the cup ASAP.  He then finds Lily and scolds her for writing the nasty anonymous letter about Emily.  He tells her she needs to apologize to Emily, and Lily throws a glass of wine on Dusty.  Lucinda intervenes and calms Lily down.  Lily then finds a medicine cart and rummages through it.  She takes a handful of pills and swallows them.\n\n\nChris makes his speech about MEMO 21, the collaboration between Craig's company and the hospital, and dedicates the project to Bob.  Chris begins to sign the contract when Dusty confronts him.  Dusty claims to have proof and Lucinda urges him to present it.  She also stops Chris from actually signing the paper.  Evan Walsh is not happy about this.\n\n\nWill finds out from Gwen that Sofie is their babysitter and it makes him uneasy.  He is afraid that she will get reattached to the baby.  When they return home, they find Sofie holding the sleeping baby and bonding with her.  It is obviously hard for her to leave Hallie, and Aaron notices that Sofie is much happier now.\n\n\nLucinda visits Lily who has been admitted to the hospital.  It was a close call for her, and Lily is groggy but recognizes her mother.  Lucinda is supportive and then reports back to Holden.  \n\n\nChris and Holden compare notes on how much they hate Dusty and Chris leaves to \"take care of something.\"  Bonnie and Holden say goodnight and Holden stops by Lily's room, but her bed is empty.   Meanwhile, Dusty takes a call on his cell phone while he is in the stairwell of the hospital.\n\n\nEmily finds Chris as he returns, but he refuses to listen to more of her lies.  He cannot bear to look at her.  Dusty is back and Holden threatens him to stay away from Lily.  Dusty gets another phone call and says he'll be right there.  He goes into a medical room but the lights do not work.  In the dark, he suddenly hears someone else in the room.\n\n\n",
