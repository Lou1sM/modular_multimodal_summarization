Aaron and Ali celebrate the good news by enjoying a sweet kiss.  Ben presents Aaron with a list of things to do and not to do after he leaves the hospital -- Ali and Aaron both blush when Ben tells them \"most importantly, no sex!\"  Bob Hughes tells Ben that he has decided to talk to the hospital board about his reinstatement, and that if all goes well he should be back on staff by the end of the week.  When Jessica runs into Ben he tells her the good news and she is delighted!  They make plans to celebrate and they kiss -- a move that seems to surprise -- yet delight -- them both!  Chris walks into Aaron's room and catches Alison and Aaron in a kiss.  He surprises them by announcing that he is leaving to take a job at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh.  Chris seems very sad when he says good-bye to his father and grandmother in the hospital, especially when Nancy presents him with his grandfather's watch.\n\n\nHenry and Katie decide that the sort of wedding they want (the kind that will really get Mike's attention) is way over their heads financially, and that one of them needs to get a job.  Henry has set up an interview for Katie with the owner of the Downtown Gym.  As they talk, the owner tells them that business has been bad since the murder there.  Just as they discuss the murder, Mike walks in and is not shy about listening in or presenting his opinions about Katie working at the gym.  He is not happy with Henry, either, that he would let Katie work where a murder occurred.  For somebody who has a new girlfriend, Mike is very upset about the situation.....Katie is so thrilled that her plan is working that she doesn't see how unhappy all the talk about Mike is making Henry.\n\n\nWhen Mike ran into Henry and Katie at Metro, he was escaping a mother/daughter confrontation in his own home.  Barbara had tracked her daughter down to talk to her about Will, but Jennifer would have none of it.  Barbara also suggested that she wanted to work again and that she would be using the suite at the Lakeview.  When Mike returned home, he found Jennifer looking for an apartment -- he asks Jennifer to move in with him.\n\n\nPaul has paid the $200,000 bond on Emily's release from jail and the two go directly to her home to try to find evidence of whatever it was that Barbara did to cause Emily to terrorize Rosanna.  Emily remembers just enough for them to suspect that Barbara drugged her with the tea....and just as they start to pile dishes into a box to take to a forensic expert, Barbara walks into the kitchen and yells at them: \"What the hell are you doing in my house!\"  Her eyes grow wide when she sees the box of what could be very incriminating evidence.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Casey is urged by Roseanna and Margo to convince Will to have a party at Fairwinds, which Will goes along with. Henry hooks Katie up with an interview with the owner of the Downtown Gym and while she's negotiating with the owner about working for him, Mike comes in and tries to talk her out of it. She presses onward and Mike wishes her good luck before taking breakfast home to Jennifer. Barbara visits Jennifer, appraising her of how she's being tormented, Jennifer not buying into her story until Barbara tells her she intends to return to the penthouse. When Mike returns with breakfast, Jennifer is looking for apartments and he asks if she'd move in with him. Paul posts Emily's bail, returning to her house to look for clues. When Emily remembers how insistent Barbara was that she drink the tea, Paul insists that they take all of the dishes to the crime lab to see if any traces of drugs are left behind. Just as they begin to leave, Barbara returns and is horrified that they've accused her of drugging Emily.",
