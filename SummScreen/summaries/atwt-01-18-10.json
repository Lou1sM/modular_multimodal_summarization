She got hysterical when she realized that she would probably not be able to go to college in the fall, and she began to sob.  Liberty yelled at Janet to leave her alone, as Dusty pulled Janet out of the room.  He suggested that she try to reach Jack.\n\n\nDr. Greg Hern, an oncologist, introduced himself to Janet in the hall outside Liberty's room, and he said that he was the specialist on Liberty's case.  Janet gave him permission to see her daughter, and she and Dusty went in with the doctor.  Dr. Hern assured a still upset Liberty that they would run more tests and then figure out the best and most aggressive treatment for her.  The doctor left to put a rush on the tests, and Dusty walked out, as well.  Liberty told her mother that she was scared, but Janet promised that they would fight and win the battle.\n\n\nJanet and Dusty talked in a waiting room, and they tried to figure out where Liberty's life was going.  Janet said she wasn't sure that they even had insurance, since Jack was not employed.  Dusty assured her that, as his employee, Janet had insurance.  Janet said she hoped that she could be strong enough for her daughter, and they went back into Liberty's room.  The girl was not there, however, so they began a search.  They looked everywhere, but neither Janet nor Dusty could find Liberty.  Dusty continued to search, as Janet received a text message on her phone inviting her to Katie's farewell party at the Lakeview.\n\n\nDusty found Liberty in Old Town near the hospital.  She was burning her design sketches in a trash barrel, so Dusty talked to her and asked if she was giving up without a fight.  He picked up a rock and told her she needed to blow off some steam.  He hurled the rock through the window of a nearby building and laughed at the sound of breaking glass.  Then he invited Liberty to join in, and they both started to laugh.  Liberty threw a rock with the same result, and then another, and an alarm went off.  Dusty grabbed the girl's hand, and they took off.\n\n\nLiberty and Dusty hid around the corner, and Liberty worried that the cops might show up.  Dusty said for her not to worry because the owner of the building was \"a sweetheart.\"  Liberty asked how he knew that, and Dusty admitted that he was the owner.  Liberty did not think that was funny, and she slugged him on the arm.  Dusty urged her to hit him again, so she yelled and slugged him until she got it all out of her system.\n\n\nJanet sat on a bench in Old Town, and Dusty called her.  He said that he had Liberty with him, and they were headed to Liberty's room at Memorial.  Janet met them there, and Liberty said she was \"so going to win\" the game of chicken; she was going to make the cancer blink first.  Dusty had to leave, so Janet walked him out.  She was grateful that Dusty had cheered up her daughter, but Dusty said it was \"no big deal.\"  He urged her to keep calling Jack.\n\n\nKatie packed for her trip with Simon, and he teased her about \"packing light.\"  Katie was unhappy that Margo had talked her into staying for a farewell party at the Lakeview, but Simon reminded her that the people who loved her just wanted to say goodbye.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry helped Margo set up the lounge for Katie's party, and Craig arrived and asked if some \"weepy toasts and a walk down Memory Lane\" would be enough to stop Katie from leaving.  Margo said that they also needed a one-two punch, and that was Craig's job.  Margo assigned him to work on Simon and persuade him to change his mind about leaving Oakdale.\n\n\nAt that moment, Jack was kissing Carly in her living room.  When they drew apart, Jack said that he was leaving, but as he leaned in for another kiss, his phone rang.  He answered it, and Margo invited him to join them at Katie's goodbye party.  When Jack heard that his ex and her son were moving to New York with Simon Frasier, he yelled, \"Over my dead body!\"  Jack told Carly that moving had to be Simon's idea, and he questioned his motives in fetching Simon back to help Katie.\n\n\nCarly had a different perspective, and she suggested that perhaps it was too painful for Katie to stay around all the memories of Brad. Carly said that Jack owed it to Katie to listen to her point of view.  Jack asked Carly if she wanted to go with him to the Lakeview, and she agreed.\n\n\nKatie, Jacob, and Simon arrived at the party, and Craig began taunting Simon.  Henry passed out flutes of champagne and toasted Katie and Simon.  Jack, followed by Carly, walked in and interrupted Henry's rhetoric.  Jack reminded Henry that Simon was a fugitive, as Carly attempted to silence him.  Craig took some jibes at Jack, who returned the favor until Margo declared a truce.  Henry continued his toast and saluted Katie and Simon, and then he suggested that Katie open her gifts.\n\n\nHenry handed Katie a gift from Emma, and it was a Snyder family Bible that contained a family tree that already included Jacob.  Margo and Henry had gone in together on a nice set of luggage for Katie, in case, said Margo, Simon and Katie had to move around a lot.  Katie began to recognize a theme to her gifts, so Craig stepped up and admitted that none of them wanted Katie to leave.  Henry told Jack and Craig to stop sparring because they had to accept Katie's decision about her life.  He pointed to a big-screen television, opened his laptop, and announced, \"Katie, Snyder, This is Your Life.\"\n\n\nHenry showed a montage of Katie's life, which included clips from her \"Butt Buster\" video; her wedding photos with Henry and Brad; her bestseller, Oakdale Confidential; and scenes from Oakdale Now on WOAK.  Craig quietly continued to needle Simon, who finally turned to him and said, \"Bite me.\"  Katie finally told Henry to stop, and she asked if everyone was trying to make her feel guilty.  She wanted to leave, but Margo said she had one last gift for Katie.  Margo handed Katie a map of the United States with photos on all the sites where Katie had lived with her mother, Lyla, when Lyla was on the road.\n\n\nKatie looked hard at it and admitted that she didn't even remember all the places.  Craig muttered, \"This is going well,\" and went to get another scotch.    Jack followed him into the lobby and asked if Craig was going to just stand there and let Katie leave.  Jack said they had no choice, but Carly walked up and suggested that they not interfere.  Jack and Craig agreed to go at Simon from both sides.\n\n\nHenry, however, was not quite finished with his slide show, so he fired up his computer again and kept tugging on Katie's heartstrings.  He even presented her with a CD of his singing \"Get Along, Little Dogie\" to Jacob, in case \"the little fellow\" ever missed \"his Uncle Henry.\"\n\n\nOut in the lobby, Jack went after Simon, and Katie heard the ruckus from the lounge.  She ran to Jack and was furious that the whole party was \"one big setup.\"  She said that she knew exactly what she was leaving behind: \"a bunch of selfish, clingy people,\" who claimed to know what was best for her.  She particularly scolded Craig and Jack, and she walked out.  \"Well done,\" said Simon, with sarcasm, as he joined Katie back in the lounge.  Katie finally told her friends and family that their protectiveness made her feel trapped.  Simon said the party had been a stupid idea, but Henry maintained that he still had something to say to Katie.\n\n\nCarly dragged Jack outside, and they hung around Old Town.  Carly said that Jack was still trying to get back at Simon for taking Carly away, and Jack admitted that he couldn't stand Simon.  Carly reminded him that they could not change the past, and she urged him to go back to the hotel and say a proper goodbye to Katie and his nephew.  They walked back, and Jack apologized to Katie for how he had treated her.  He also told Jacob that he'd watch out for his nephew as he had promised Brad.  Katie hugged Jack, and Simon asked Katie if she was ready to go.  \"As ready as I'll ever be,\" was her answer.\n\n\nKatie opened the Snyder Bible and looked at the family tree.  Suddenly she turned to Simon and said that she couldn't leave.  If she took Jacob away, she explained, he would grow up as she did.  Simon said he was willing to stay in Oakdale, but Katie reminded him that they had tried that twice before, and it had not worked.  She said she couldn't let Simon try to make up for past hurts; he would just end up hating her.  She hugged him and said Simon knew what he had to do.\n\n\nJack and Carly left and went back to her house, and Jack said he would bunk at the police station until he figured out his life.  Then he kissed Carly, and she reminded him that he was \"the most married man\" she knew.  Jack walked out.\n\n\nHenry, Craig, and Margo shared some wine at Margo's house when suddenly Katie appeared at the door.  Simon waited outside while Katie took the baby in.  Katie faced them and said that she could not leave Oakdale, and everyone was ecstatic.  Henry went out and congratulated Simon for doing a \"far, far better thing.\"  Simon lied and said that he wasn't the \"settling-down type,\" but Henry called his bluff and then hugged him. They said their goodbyes, and Henry went back inside.  Katie hugged Henry, as Simon watched through the door, and then disappeared.\n\n\n",
