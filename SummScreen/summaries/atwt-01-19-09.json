    "soap_central": "\n\nJosie found a depressed Paul sitting in Fairwinds. In the trash, she spied the divorce papers Meg had given him and suggested that Paul cooperate with Meg and sign them as a gesture of good faith. She felt that might leave the door open for the two of them to have a future relationship because of their daughter. Paul was unsure how Meg would respond to that, so Josie suggested he show that he cared more about her and the baby than he did about himself. Paul reluctantly agreed to follow Josie's directions of going to see Meg and signing the papers. He went to clean up, as Josie offered to accompany him for moral support. \n\n\nDusty visited Meg at the farm, and she was sad that she would be raising Eliza alone. Dusty said he needed a favor from her, and he was discouraged in his attempts to make peace with Craig as he had promised Lucy. He was sure that Craig wanted full and sole custody of Johnny, and Dusty could not allow that. He asked Meg to set up a meeting with Craig to try to coax him to confess that he had attempted to kill Paul with the car bomb. Meg refused at first, and suggested that perhaps Craig was committed to a new way of life, but Dusty implored her to help him keep Johnny safe. After Meg thought about it more, she agreed and asked how to start. \n\n\nCraig showed up at Carly's and asked to see Parker, who he assumed was still recovering from his close call with a speeding car. Carly facetiously asked Craig when he was going to get down on one knee and begin the proposal scenario again. Carly said the boy had gone to breakfast with Jack before going back to school, so Craig left to find him, only telling Carly he had unnamed business with the boy. \n\n\nAt the diner, Jack asked Parker if Craig was spending much time with Carly at the house, but Parker wasn't talking. Jack reinforced that he wanted the boy to keep his distance from Craig, and Parker split for school. Janet offered some unsolicited advice to her new husband: Jack should stop trying to turn Parker into a spy. She also found one of the boy's school notebooks on a chair, so Jack said he would take it to his son, \n\n\nWalking to the high school, Parker ran into Craig, who said he just wanted to see how Parker was. He also asked Parker if he was interested in attending a Black Hawks game, and Parker said he would like that. Jack came along and gave Parker his book and then turned to Craig and asked why he was stalking his son. Craig joked that since he had saved Parker's life, he was responsible for the boy, but Jack begged to differ. Craig continued to play the hero card until Jack warned Craig to keep away from Jack's family. Craig went back to his car and took a call from Meg, who asked about Johnny. Under coaching instructions from Dusty, she also offered to drop off a gift for the boy at the Lakeview, and Craig agreed to meet her. \n\n\nMeg watched Dusty plant a tiny recording device in her purse, and she went to rendezvous with Craig. She handed over the present, and Craig asked her point-blank why she wanted to see him. Dusty heard Meg tell Craig she wanted to make peace with him and apologize for marrying him while she was still in love with Paul. Craig asked if she had changed her mind about what kind of man he was, and Meg replied that she had made many mistakes. Craig said perhaps he could have done more by \"putting Paul away\" when he had the chance. Meg asked him to elaborate, but Craig backed off the subject. She then inquired if Craig had hated the man who came between them enough to kill him, but Craig did not take the bait. \n\n\nHe finally said that, as much as he would like to, he could not take the credit for that. He also threw in his opinion that it was Dusty who had planted the car bomb, something that irritated Dusty, who was listening. Craig said he had to go but accepted Meg's offer of peace. Meg returned to Dusty and gave him a hug, as Josie watched. After Meg left, Dusty told Josie he did not trust Josie because she had worked for Paul, and she was jealous of Meg. Dusty defended Meg because she had been willing to help him. He also told Josie she had to choose between him and Paul. He started to walk out but then turned around and kissed Josie on the lips. \n\n\nJack went to Carly's, steaming mad. He complained that Craig had been waiting for Parker on his way to school and asked her what Craig wanted with their son. Carly explained that Craig wanted to turn his life around so that he could be a better person for Johnny. Jack said Carly had 200,000 reasons to trust Craig and accused her of being in his hip pocket. They began shouting at one another until Jack reminded her that Craig was a repeat criminal. Carly cut to the crux of the matter by telling Jack that he could not stand the thought of another man taking his place in that house, even though he, himself, didn't want to be there. Carly then threw Jack out of the house. \n\n\nJack went back to the diner and griped to Janet about Craig and Carly. She said Carly was just pushing his buttons again. Back at Carly's, Parker came home early and found his mother upset. She said Jack thought Craig was being too friendly. Craig rang the doorbell, and Parker let him in. He gave Carly some coffee beans from Java but refused to go when she suggested he leave. Carly complained that if Craig spent any more time with her, Jack would take her to court and attempt to get custody of the kids. Craig said he just might surprise her, and he walked out. \n\n\nMeg took Eliza home and found Paul waiting for her. He said he was ready to sign the divorce papers. Meg could not believe Paul was being so cooperative. He then asked for some visitation rights with Eliza and promised to behave like a father. Meg replied that if he stayed rational, they would talk about visitation rights. Paul signed the legal papers. The baby awoke, and Meg offered Eliza's father the chance to give her a bottle. \n\n\nCraig went to the diner looking for Jack and spouted off at Janet that her new husband had no business telling Carly whom she could see. Janet said Craig was preaching to the choir, and she totally agreed with him. In fact, she said, Jack was on his way to Carly's to tell her he was backing off. Craig admitted he admired Janet's hidden talents of persuasion. \n\n\nA humbled Jack told Carly he had been wrong and that it was not his concern whom she invited to her house. He was willing to let Parker handle his own situation with Craig, as well. As soon as Jack left, Craig returned and took all the credit for Jack's change of heart. He crowed that protecting those he loved was what he did best. He brought up his marriage proposal again, but Carly reminded him that he had put her sister, Rosanna, in a coma. Craig appeared contrite and then mentioned how much alike he and Carly were. He asked her if she was not sick of being alone and single. Carly was tempted by all he offered, and suddenly agreed to marry him. Craig couldn't believe his ears and asked if they could \"seal the deal\" with a kiss. She told him not to push his luck, so he left to buy the \"biggest engagement ring\" he could find. \n\n\nBack at the diner, Jack told Janet how well his talk with Carly had gone and that all the tension between them seemed to have dissipated.\n\n\n",
