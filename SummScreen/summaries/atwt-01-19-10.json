    "soap_central": "\n\n \nDamian called Meg's orderly, Sharkey, at Deerbrook, and said that he would be out of town with his wife for a couple of days.  He said he expected Sharkey to keep things under control until Damian returned.  Sharkey promised that he would, but then he asked Damian for an advance on his payoff; however, Damian shut him down fast.  Sharkey went into Meg's room and checked on her, and she appeared drugged.  Sharkey threatened her all the same, and then walked out of her room and went off duty.\n\n\nHolden and Molly arrived at Deerbrook just in time to see Sharkey leaving.  They followed him, and the orderly led them to the Lakeview.  He met a woman there, and the two of them got a $400 room and ordered champagne.  As soon as the couple got on the elevator, Holden approached the desk and asked if Mr. Sharkey always paid in cash.  The desk clerk was reluctant to give out information on a guest, but Holden handed over an incentive, and the clerk responded, \"Always.\"\n\n\nHolden asked Molly how an orderly got money enough to get an expensive room and champagne.  They took the elevator up to Sharkey's room, and Holden warned Molly that it \"might not be pretty.\"  That didn't faze Molly, so Holden knocked on the door, and she hollered, \"Room Service.\"  Sharkey opened the door and was surprised to see the two of them.  After a few choice words from Holden, Sharkey gave his \"date\" some money and told her to wait in the hotel bar for him.\n\n\nMolly and Holden went into the room, and Holden mentioned that his sister had seemed so much more alert a few days before; it seemed she had taken a turn for the worse.  He asked if the doctors were aware of Meg's \"setback,\" and he said Sharkey was going to tell him what he needed to know.  Meanwhile, Molly picked up Sharkey's phone and checked it.  She announced loudly that his last phone call had been from \"Grimaldi.\"  Holden grabbed Sharkey by the collar and demanded to know why Damian was calling him.\n\n\nSharkey whined that Mr. Grimaldi was checking on Meg's condition, but Holden said that Damian no longer had any relationship with Holden's sister.  Then Holden mentioned how expensive the rooms were in the Lakeview, and Molly said they were leaving.  Out in the hall, Holden said he was going directly after Damian, but Molly argued against that.  She said that they really hadn't found out anything concrete.\n\n\nThey returned to the farm, and Molly said that they needed some kind of proof that Sharkey was doing \"dark and twisty things\" for Damian.   She said it was possible that Damian had put Sharkey on his payroll just for him to keep a close eye on Meg because he feared for Lily's safety.  Holden asked if Molly was actually defending Damian to him, as Lily entered the kitchen and questioned Holden's remark.  Holden made up an answer, but Lily was still angry.  She said Damian was being nothing but helpful to Luke, and she complained that she couldn't even talk to Holden anymore about their children.  She stomped out with a cutting remark to Molly.\n\n\nHolden and Molly went back to Deerbrook to visit Meg, who told them that the drugs they were forcing her to take were whacking her out.  Molly said they could believe Meg all day long, but what they needed was proof that Damian was paying off Sharkey to keep Meg drugged.  Meg sobbed that they had to help her, and she begged them to go to the police.  Holden promised that he would do everything he could for her situation, and they walked outside.  Molly said she had just heard from the Kentucky State Patrol.\n\n\nHolden was hopeful that Officer Grady had stepped forward with some more information, but Molly said that Grady was no longer with the department.  He had taken an early retirement and moved to the Chicago area.  Both Holden and Molly had the same thought, and they took off for the Windy City.\n\n\nAt home, Lily asked Luke if Dr. Oliver, the ophthalmologist, had called him back, and a frustrated Luke said no.  Finally his phone rang, and Dr. Oliver called Luke \"Mr. Snyder.\"  He said that his staff had informed him that \"Mr. Snyder\" had called close to three dozen times.  He imperiously asked Luke why he seemed to think that the doctor had the time of day for anyone who lived in a place called Oakdale, wherever that was.  Luke did not know how to respond to such arrogance, so he stumbled over his words.  Oliver said his time was booked solid for over a year in advance, so Luke offered to double his fee.  The doctor still refused, and when Luke questioned why, Oliver said he had read Noah's file and the case bored him. Dr. Oliver hung up.\n\n\nA stunned Luke ran to Noah's side to console him.  Lily suggested that they get another surgeon, but Noah nixed that.  He said that he'd done his homework, and Oliver was the best for his condition.  If Dr. Oliver were not Noah's surgeon, then there would be no operation.  Noah thanked Luke for trying, as Lily pulled Luke aside and whispered that if anyone could pull off a favor like that, it was Damian.  Luke told Noah that he and his mother had to attend a meeting at Worldwide, and Noah assured Luke that he could stay alone.\n\n\nMeg, woozy from the drugs, used her phone privilege to call Damian at his shipping office.  She threatened him and reminded him of what she would do to him when she got released from Deerbrook.  Damian was furious, and he yelled at her, just as Lily and Luke walked into the office.  Lily was upset at Damian's behavior, but he passed it off as some problem with a rival shipping firm.  Luke said they needed Damian's help because the one surgeon who could help Noah had refused to take the case.  Damian suggested that Luke offer him more money, but Luke said that had not worked.  Lily was hesitant about leaving town for their mini-break, so Damian said he would handle everything.\n\n\nDamian suggested that Lily prepare the things that they were taking to Faith at her new school, and Damian would work with Luke to solve Noah's problem.  Lily left, and Luke explained that Noah had his heart set on having Dr. Oliver, and only Dr. Oliver, do his surgery.  Damian handed Luke his cell phone and told him to make the doctor \"an offer he couldn't refuse.\"  Luke placed the call, and when the receptionist refused to put him through, Luke threatened her by saying if Dr. Oliver didn't take his call, he would risk losing his medical license.\n\n\nOliver came on the line almost immediately, and Luke said that the good doctor should take Noah's case or else Luke would inform the Medical Review Committee in Texas just how many times Oliver had bent the rules \"in the name of healing.\"  Luke went on to say that there was a car outside Dr. Oliver's office waiting to take him to the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, where Luke's father's jet was waiting.  Luke only asked that Oliver examine Noah and see if he was a candidate for sight-saving surgery.  The doctor protested, but Luke continued that when Oliver arrived in Oakdale, a car would take him to Memorial Hospital where Noah would be waiting.\n\n\n\"See you soon,\" said Luke, and he hung up his father's cell phone.  He had sounded just like Damian, and his father declared his performance \"stupendous!\"  Luke was uncomfortable, however, about having to threaten the doctor in order to get him to comply, but Damian assured his son that \"the end justifies the means.\"  Luke said it wasn't quite that simple for him.\n\n\nMaddie worked on her advice blog at the office of Emily's new online paper, the First Edition.  Hunter looked over her shoulder and kibitzed by offering his opinion.  Maddie kidded him by telling him that he still had the price tags on his new suit, but Hunter was not surprised.  He said that he had bought the suit for Casey and Alison's wedding, which was happening on Valentine's Day.  Then he realized that mentioning that was in poor taste around Maddie, but she said he shouldn't worry.   She said that she was planning on attending the nuptials, as well.\n\n\nHunter invited Maddie to lunch, but she begged off because she had to meet with an ex-boyfriend about her blog.  Hunter assumed that meant Casey, but Maddie surprised him by saying she was meeting with Noah Mayer.  Hunter asked if Noah was gay, and when Maddie affirmed that, Hunter, with his usual finesse, asked Maddie if she was the one who had \"turned him.\"  Maddie suggested that Hunter quit while he \"was not ahead.\"\n\n\nMaddie went to visit Noah at Lily's, and she explained that she was writing a blog for Emily's new online newspaper.  She insisted that Noah go with her to Al's for a burger and a nice chat.  Noah agreed, but he made Maddie write a note to Luke so that Luke wouldn't send out a posse to look for him.  They went to the diner, and Hunter walked in.  When Maddie introduced him to Noah, Hunter, in his usual bumbling manner, asked Noah what it was like to be blind.  Maddie was horrified, but Noah laughed and was not at all offended.  He invited Hunter to pull up a chair.\n\n\nThe young men got along well, and Hunter asked Noah if his other senses had heightened since he had lost his sight.  Noah said he didn't know, so Hunter suggested a challenge to find out.  Noah was game, so Hunter took them to his place and played very loud music and asked Noah how it affected him.  Noah was most concerned that he missed the pictures that usually went with the music, and he explained that he used to make films.\n\n\nLuke went to Al's, looking for Noah, but his friend was not there.  He left a phone message for him in which he said he had talked with Dr. Oliver, who was on a Grimaldi jet on his way to Memorial Hospital.  Luke asked Noah to have Maddie take him to the hospital and to call him when he got the message.  Lily walked up, and Luke gave his mother the good news: Dr. Oliver was arriving soon to examine Noah.  He also said that Damian had \"coached\" him on how to be persuasive by using threats.  Lily was horrified to hear that her husband had told their son that the end always justified the means.\n\n\nLuke went on to Memorial, and Dr. Oliver arrived.  He was still arrogant, and he told Luke as soon as he saw him that he noticed the \"big fat silver spoon in his mouth,\" and he hoped the boy choked on it.  He said people usually waited their turn to see him, and he asked where Noah was.  Just then, Noah, Maddie, and Hunter arrived, and Luke ran to Noah and said that Dr. Oliver was there, but he was angry.  Oliver took Noah into an exam room, but he pushed Luke out.\n\n\nAfter some time, Dr. Oliver walked out and announced that he did not like Luke, but Noah said he was a good moviemaker, and arrogance appealed to Dr. Oliver.  He would operate on Noah and restore his sight.  Then, he declared to Luke, he never wanted to hear from Luke again.  Oliver walked off, and Luke went into the exam room.  Noah said that the doctor really disliked Luke, but he thanked his boyfriend for giving him a shot at having a full life back.\n\n\nDamian went home, and the phone was ringing.  He answered it, and the caller was Sharkey, who was upset that Damian had not picked up his cell phone.  Sharkey said that Meg's brother had showed up at Deerbrook \"with some broad,\" and they had asked questions about Damian.  Sharkey reminded Damian that their deal was supposed to be \"lucrative and risk-free,\" but it wasn't nearly lucrative enough, and was full of risk.  He asked for more money and then hung up.\n\n\nDamian yelled into the phone, and Lily walked in again on her raging husband.  Lily asked him point-blank if he had \"strong-armed\" Luke into doing something that he would never have imagined doing on his own.  Next, she inquired what or whom Damian was hiding from.  Damian was frustrated, and he said that he had arranged a wonderful weekend get-away for the two of them very near Faith's school.  He thought that would please Lily, yet his wife thought he had some hidden agenda.  Lily said she knew that he had forced Luke to use Damian's form of coercion to get what he wanted.\n\n\nDamian shouted that it had worked because Dr. Oliver was examining Noah in town that very afternoon.  Lily brought up the \"end justifies the means\" issue, and Damian seemed to think that was legitimate.  Lily was angry that Damian was passing on that kind of thinking to Luke.  She was unhappy that was how he chose to raise their family, but that especially angered Damian, who blurted out that they wouldn't even be a family if...and his words trailed off.\n\n\nFinally Damian said he took what he wanted, and what he wanted at that moment was to go away with his wife.  Lily seemed to be the only one who recognized the ethical breach that Damian had crossed.\n\n\nBack at the office, Maddie typed up her blog, while Hunter breathed down her neck.  He said that she had written her best work yet, and he was impressed.  He was also complimentary about the relationship that Maddie and Noah had achieved.  Maddie thanked him for amusing Noah with his loud musical diversion.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dr. Oliver tells Luke that he won't take Noah's case because he finds it a boring Case. Dr. Oliver also tells Luke that he thinks that he is being arrogant in assuming that Noah can go ahead of his other patients just because he has money. Luke tells Noah the bad news and Noah tells him that if Dr. Oliver won't do the operation he doesn't want another doctor to do it. Lily advises Luke that he should ask Damian to see if he can find another Dr. for Noah. Luke talks to Damian and explains that Noah has his heart set on Dr. Oliver and Damian tells Luke to blackmail Dr. Oliver by telling him he has information on him and the information could get his medical license revoked. Dr. Oliver flies to memorial and agrees to do the operation because Noah doesn't deserve to be blind. Dr. Oliver makes it clear to Luke that he doesn't like him at all because he thinks he can get anything he wants just because he is rich. Luke tells Noah the good news about the operation and also tells him that he lied to Dr. Oliver and he never had any incriminating information on him. Noah is shocked that Luke would do such a thing but he isn't mad at him and thanks him for making the operation possible. Maddie wants to do a Vlog for the paper asking if you can still be friends with an old boyfriend so she interviews Noah and takes him to Al's for a hamburger. Hunter arrives and asks Noah what its like to be blind and Noah likes that Hunter asks him questions and treats him normally not like a blind person. Noah buys Maddie and Hunter Lunch and then they go back to the newspaper office and listen to music loudly to see if Noah has a better sense of hearing since he has lost his sight. Maddie thanks Hunter for helping Noah today even though he didn't know he was helping him. Lily is angry at Damian after Luke tells him that Damian advised him that the ends justify the means to get Dr. Oliver to come to Oakdale. Lily confronts Damian and they argue and he almost tells her all he has done to make them a family. Meg calls Damian and tells him she will find a way to prove she isn't crazy and after she gets out he knows what will come next for him. Holden and Molly follow Snarky the orderly at Deerbrook to the Lakeview and question him but he doesn't say anything to them. Molly finds out the last call Sharkey got on his phone came from Damian. Molly tells Holden they have to get solid proof against Damian. Holden and Molly go to Deerbrook to talk to Meg who sobs because she is so happy that Holden and Molly believe her. Holden promises Meg that he will get her out of Deerbrook by proving she is telling the truth. Holden tells Meg to stay calm while he and Molly work to get poof against Damian. Molly talks to the police in Kentucky and fins out officer Grady took early retirement and moved to Chicago. Holden and Molly head to Chicago to talk to former officer Grady.",
