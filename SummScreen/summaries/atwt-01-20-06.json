Meanwhile, Barbara found out from Will that Carly was going to lend them $1,000 and went over to Carly's, where she told Gwen that she'd given Carly the money as an advance on the job she'd offered her in exchange for her help in keeping Gwen and Will apart. Will came in, and Barbara told him that Gwen was no good for him and that Gwen and Carly were trying to scam him. Will didn't believe her, and Barbara left. Carly tried to tell Gwen that she actually was scamming Barbara, but Gwen didn't want to hear any of it. Will said it was really his fault that Carly got caught, because he'd told Barbara where they were getting the money, without knowing what Carly was trying to do. Gwen still insisted she would be better off without Carly's help.\n\n\nWill and Gwen went to Java for hot tea; Will thought Gwen should have given Carly a chance, but Gwen said that there's something wrong with the way Carly works and the way she thinks, even when her intentions are good. Gwen and Will got kicked out of Java when it closed early because of a snowstorm that was on its way, and they ended up in sleeping bags outside in the snow, because Will's car was impounded and they had turned down all offers of help from everyone in their families.\n\n\nAt Lily and Holden's house, Luke massaged his friend Kevin's back because Kevin said he'd gotten a knot in it from playing basketball with Luke. Holden saw them through the window and was concerned with the way it looked. Holden went out on the porch, and Luke acted extremely nervous in front of him. Lily came out and invited Kevin to stay for dinner, but Holden nixed the idea, saying it wasn't a good time. Kevin left, and Luke went to get ready for dinner; Holden told Lily he didn't think Kevin was a good influence on Luke, because he was the one who'd gotten him to drink before. Lily said she'd talked to Kevin's parents and that they were keeping an eye on him, and she wasn't concerned anymore about the drinking. Holden was adamant that Kevin and Luke shouldn't hang around together anymore, and Lily thought that would be very hard for Luke, because Kevin was one of his best friends. \n\n\nHolden then called Jack and asked if he could meet him at his house to talk about something. When Holden got to Jack's, he danced around the issue with Luke, just telling Jack that he thought Luke might be hiding something because he thought it was wrong; Jack wondered what it was that Holden was so afraid of. Meanwhile, Lily talked to Luke, asking how things were going with his counseling and whether he was happy; Luke said he wasn't, because he'd caused all the trouble with Keith, but Lily told him not to think that way and assured him he was safe now and shouldn't be afraid to tell his parents anything about how he was feeling.\n\n\nCarly left her house to go find Jack at the station, but Jack had already headed home to meet Holden. Instead, she ran into Nick, who tried to get her to stay for some coffee; in her attempt to get away from Nick, who was holding her by the arm, she spun around and fell down, twisting her ankle. Nick picked her up and carried her to a chair to get ice for her ankle, against Carly's protests. When Carly tried again to stand up to leave, she fell a second time, this time right on top of Nick, who said, \"Now, that's more like it!\"\n\n\nPaul told Meg that if they could find the gun Emily used, they could wipe off her fingerprints and put Paul's prints on it, then leave the gun by the river along with other \"evidence\" that would make it seem like Paul had killed himself and fallen into the river. Paul said if everyone thought he was dead, they'd stop looking for him, and he and Meg would both be safe. Meg ultimately agreed to the plan and went to look for the gun in the area where Paul said he'd seen it. She conveniently fell down and landed within inches of the gun. She put the gun in her purse and then was blinded by someone shining a light in her face and shouting, \"Freeze!\"\n\n\n",

Will and Gwen face more rough times when they end up sleeping on a park bench with a huge snow storm headed to Oakdale. Holden continues to worry about Luke and tries to find a way to help him Meg gets caught by someone while searching for the gun Emily used to shoot Paul.
