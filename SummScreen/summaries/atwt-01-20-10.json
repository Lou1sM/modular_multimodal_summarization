    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAlison sat with Emily, who was still unconscious, and she talked about having feelings for someone like Mick Dante.  Alison thought it was because she was a nurse and had a compulsion to help people.  She related her weird wedding dream to her sister, as Casey walked in and asked why Alison was talking like that.  Alison accused him of eavesdropping, but then she realized that Casey hadn't understood what she had said.\n\n\nCasey offered to postpone the wedding, but Alison said that was not necessary.  She hoped that Emily would recover in time to be at the wedding, and she hugged Casey and called him \"the best.\"  The two of them kissed, and then Alison asked Casey to go with her to Fashions and help her choose a wedding dress.  Casey was skeptical, but he agreed, and they left the room.  Emily slowly wiggled her fingers.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul wanted to return to the hospital after spending the night there, but Barbara tried to discourage him.  Mick was there, too, and he said that he had definitely ruled out his treatments as a cause of Emily's coma, and Susan Stewart had not found anything either.  Mick saw how tired Paul was and urged him to take care of himself.  Paul agreed to take a shower before he went back to Memorial, and after he left the room, Barbara criticized Mick for \"laying it on a little thick.\" Barbara's remarks angered Mick, who said that Emily would recover when Paul accepted him as James Stenbeck.  All Mick wanted was to be back at Fairwinds with his family.\n\n\nWhen Paul entered the living room after his shower, he found only his mother.  Barbara said that Mick was taking a phone call outside, as Paul's phone rang.  The hospital was calling to say that Emily had moved her hand, and she might be waking up.  Paul dashed out, as Barbara told Mick that if Emily told Paul that she was with Mick when she lost consciousness, it could be difficult.  Mick promised Barbara he would handle it, and he ran out.\n\n\nPaul sat with Emily again and asked her to move her hand.  She wiggled her fingers, and Paul ran out to find a doctor, as Mick and Barbara waited in the hall.  Mick signaled Barbara to go with her son, as he entered Emily's room.  He retrieved a syringe from his shoulder bag, and prepared to push it into Emily's I.V. line.  Suddenly, he experienced an excruciating pain in his head, which rendered him helpless.  He willed himself to relax, but he had difficulty concentrating.  He forced himself to continue, and he picked up the photo of Alison on Emily's bedside table and put it in his bag.\n\n\nMick withdrew the syringe again from his bag and managed to push it into Emily's I.V. line.  He put the syringe away, as Paul and Barbara entered the room.  Paul spoke to his wife and asked her to move her hand again, but Emily was unresponsive.  The doctor joined them and watched Emily for a while, but he said he saw no signs of activity.  He promised to check later and walked out, followed swiftly by Mick, who was holding his nose.  Barbara went after Mick and found him attempting to staunch a substantial nosebleed, and she urged him to see a doctor.  Mick got furious and turned on her angrily, with blood streaming from his nose.\n\n\nBarbara returned to Paul, who was very discouraged.  His mother said that if the doctors could not help Emily, then Mick would.  Paul accused his mother of fixating on Mick and believing that the man could do no wrong.  Paul asked if Barbara knew something about Mick that he did not, but she denied it.  Finally Paul asked his mother to leave, and when she did not, he yelled, \"Go!\" at her.  He turned back to Emily and told her that he couldn't lose her, and he rambled that none of it made sense.\n\n\nAt Fashions, Alison chose a bridal gown to try on and headed for a dressing room.   She insisted that Casey accompany her, \"to help with the zipper.\"  Casey felt ill at ease in the dressing room, but Alison kissed away his embarrassment.  Alison's phone rang, and the caller was Mick.  He asked her for immediate help and reminded her that she had offered to listen to him any time he struggled for control. Alison said no, and Mick begged, so Alison hung up.  Casey asked who had called, and Alison passed it off as \"a survey.\" Suddenly, Alison changed her mind and pushed Casey out of the dressing room.\n\n\nAlison put on the dress and looked at herself in the mirror.  She flashed back to her strange dream about meeting Mick in the old church in her wedding dress, and then she realized that the dress she had on was the same as the one in her dream.  She ran out and asked the clerk to unzip her, but she also glanced out the window of Fashions and saw Mick looking in.  Alison ran outside and stopped him, and then she demanded to know why he was in her head and she couldn't get him out.\n\n\nMick claimed he had no idea what Alison was talking about, and he scolded her for not helping him when he had needed her.  Alison said he was always on her mind, and she needed it to stop.  Mick denied that he had done anything to her, but Alison said that she was even dreaming about him.  \"Who the hell are you?\" she asked.  Mick grabbed his head and said that he couldn't keep talking to her.  Alison implored him to see a doctor about his headaches and nosebleeds, and just then Casey ran up.\n\n\nCasey said that Lisa had called after the clerk in Fashions had reported that Alison had run out of the store in a wedding gown. Then Casey turned to Mick and asked what he was doing there, and Mick said that he had just been helping Alison, and he took off. Alison said she had felt a little dizzy because the dress was so tight, and Casey asked her again if she wanted to put off the wedding for a while.  Alison said she did not want to wait another day to marry Casey, and she suggested that they run off to Las Vegas and get married.\n\n\nThe two of them went to Java, and Alison wanted to know if Casey no longer wanted to marry her.  Casey said that was not it at all, but if they ran off, they would regret it for the rest of their lives.  He knew that Alison wanted a real wedding, and besides, Casey did not want to agitate the Marriage Gods.\n\n\nMick went back to his hotel room and was looking at Alison's photo when someone knocked.  He put the frame facedown on the table and opened the door to Barbara.  She said that whatever Mick had done to Emily had worked, because her daughter-in-law was back in a coma.  Barbara asked for another youth treatment for herself, but Mick said that he had no time.  He had to falsify papers that made it appear that he had been researching Emily's condition.  Barbara pushed, so Mick yelled, \"Not now!\" at her.  Barbara spotted the picture frame and turned it over.\n\n\nBarbara broke out in gales of laughter when she saw that the picture was of Alison.  She turned to Mick and said, \"James, you may look 25 years old, but you're not.\"  Mick was pleased that she had finally called him \"James,\" and Barbara retorted that \"all that lying, scheming, and crushing on young girls\" had convinced her.  Barbara walked out, and Mick took a call from Alison.  She asked him to not call her anymore because she could not be his \"savior.\"  Mick picked up her photo and hurled it at the wall where it shattered into many pieces.\n\n\nDamian and Lily discussed their weekend trip as they called on Emma at the farm.  When Emma saw who it was, she refused to invite them in.  Lily said she had the kids' schedules for Holden since she and Damian were going away.  Emma said that Holden was out of town with Molly, and that upset Lily.  Emma said further that Holden had a business trip suddenly, but that she was fully prepared to take care of the children.  Damian listened carefully and flashed back on his conversation with the orderly, Sharkey, who had said that Holden had been asking questions about Damian.  Damian's phone rang, and he stepped away to take the call.\n\n\nLily handed the schedules to Emma and called Holden \"thoughtless.\"  Emma reminded Lily that she was married to Damian and had her own life, and Holden had the same right.  The women heard Damian raise his voice and tell his caller that he would take care of something when he got back in town, but whoever called was arguing with him.  Damian was angry, and he told Lily that didn't know whether he would be able to leave for their trip.  He kissed her cheek and left hurriedly.\n\n\nWith Damian gone, Emma let Lily into the house, but Lily was critical of what she called \"Holden's romantic little getaway.\"  Emma asked why Lily was so concerned about what went on between Holden and Molly, and Lily had no answer.\n\n\nIn Chicago, Molly and Holden entered a pool hall where they had learned that former Officer Grady liked to hang out.  There was no sign of Grady there, but Molly said that was good, because Holden had time to disappear.  Holden was reluctant to leave Molly there alone, so they compromised by agreeing that Holden could stay hidden on the premises.  Grady finally walked in, as Holden stepped around a corner.  Molly chose a bar stool right next to Grady and began a conversation with him.  Grady looked at her and said, \"I know you, don't I?\"\n\n\n Molly had a moment of concern, but then Grady remembered that she was the news anchor from New York who had slept with the congressman.  He offered to buy Molly a drink and began paying her compliments.  Molly turned on the charm and began asking Grady questions, including what he was \"getting away from.\"  Grady only said that he was getting away from \"a lot of things.\"  Holden slipped back into the bar room and sat at a table in the back.\n\n\nMolly poured them both generous drinks from the bottle, and then managed to dump most of hers without drinking it.  She learned that Grady was from Kentucky, so she asked what he did down there.  Grady said he had been a cop, and the song, \"Crazy,\" began to play on the jukebox.  Grady asked Molly to dance, and as they took to the floor, he asked her to go to his place to see what developed.  Then he kissed Molly, and it was all Holden could do to restrain himself.  He shot to his feet, but Molly gave him a hand signal to back off.\n\n\nMolly asked Grady to refill their drinks, while she went to make herself \"more beautiful.\"  She went out the door where Holden met her, and they had a chat.  Holden was worried for Molly's safety if she left the bar with Grady, but she said she could handle it.  She suggested that Holden go back to the hotel, and she would meet him there.  Molly rejoined Grady at the bar and asked him to tell her about one time when he could not resist temptation.  She said he knew all about her temptation with the congressman, so it was only fair.  Grady said he would tell her if she would agree to go back to his place, and Molly did.\n\n\nThen Grady said that he had gotten paid off to cover up DNA evidence that proved that \"a guy wasn't dead.\"  He went on say that the man who paid him wanted the other guy's wife.  He next volunteered that the people lived somewhere around Chicago, in a place called Oakdale. Molly headed for the ladies' room, but again slipped out the door.  She was walking away when she ran straight into Damian Grimaldi.  Molly recovered from the shock and told Damian that she had just met a \"friend\" of his.  She taunted him by saying that the \"friend\" was originally from Kentucky and said he knew Damian \"real well.\"\n\n\nDamian warned Molly not to stick her nose where it didn't belong, but Molly just laughed.  She said Officer Grady had told her how desperate Damian was to marry Lily and how he had paid off Grady to hide the DNA evidence that proved that Holden was still alive.  Damian said that was crazy, but Molly turned the proverbial knife by saying that poor Meg had been telling the truth all along.  She also accused Damian of paying Sharkey at Deerbrook to continue to make Meg look \"like a nutcase.\"  Damian had heard enough, and he threatened to ruin Molly's life if the truth became known.\n\n\nDamian then made the excuse that just because Holden's body was not the one in his truck, it did not mean that he was still alive.  He whined about not giving Lily any \"false hope,\" but Molly was not about to let him off the hook.  She continued to warn Damian that Lily would leave him if she knew what he had done, but Damian had a response for that.  He reminded her that with Lily free, she would run straight to Holden, and that would leave Molly out in the cold.  Molly told Damian to \"go to hell,\" as he advised her that they both had a lot to lose.  He suggested that she keep her \"pretty little mouth closed,\" as Molly turned to leave.\n\n\nMolly returned to the hotel, and Holden immediately kissed her.  He asked what had happened with Grady, and Molly's answer was, \"It's complicated.\"  When Holden pressed for details, Molly hesitated and then said that Grady had told her nothing they could use.  Holden thanked her anyway, and they began to make love.\n\n\nLily went home and got a call from Holden.  He said that he was on an important business trip, and he had needed Molly's help.  Lily was not pleased, and then she told him that the plans for her trip with Damian had unraveled.  She then asked if Holden had made all the bad things happen on purpose, but Holden said no.  Lily got angry and hung up on him, as Damian walked in.  He lied about where he had been and was eager to get started on their trip.  He also assured Lily that everything would turn out fine.\n\n\n",
