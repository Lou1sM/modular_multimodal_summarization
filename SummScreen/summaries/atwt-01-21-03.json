    "tvmega_recap": "A BABY STORY Craig rushed Carly to the ER. Mike, Jack, and Emily are there, also. As Dr. Susan tries to help Carly to the examining room, she has another painful cramp. Carly rambles a guilt-filled conversation about her loving him & her making a BIG mistake before they married & if he would leave her forever. He figures that she's just upset about the baby & reassures her that he loves her, etc. Jack asked her what she was doing when she got into such pain & she had to mention Craig. At that moment, Jack became furious & yelled at Craig about making his wife go back to work. He said that he had to \"let off some steam\" and left Craig to chit-chat w/Mike. Mike thanks Craig for \"taking the bullet\" for him & Craig states that he didn't do it FOR him, but he will pay. Carly gets carted off the sonogram while Jack's away. After she gets back, her and Emily include Susan into the lie of conception. She explains that she wants Jack to think that she's eight weeks preggers. Susan doesn't want to know the details of why. Back in Milltown, Carly tells Jack that they're going to have a baby in July. TEEN SCENE Jack and Aaron have a nice family talk about obsessive women & broken down cars while at Java. Jack leaves when he hears the news about Carly. Aaron tells Alison that she lookes cute in overalls and boots & of course, she's glowing with joy. Aaron has a letter for Lucy and tells Alison that he's going to deliver it himself. She suggests that he not do that & he decides that he's going to call her, instead. Alison doesn't approve of that idea, either! Alison asks Aaron to the show & he tells her that his heart is with Lucy and in other words, back off! He leaves & Craig walks in. Alison is pondering about the previous leters that she was supposed to deliver & decides to give them to Craig! THE COTTAGE Simon and Katie invite Henry over for pot roast, only, there's nothing cooking! He brings expensive Brandy and Cuban Cigars, thinking they're going to have a good time.
