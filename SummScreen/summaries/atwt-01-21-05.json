Aaron tried to explain that sometimes people lose their perspective on things but eventually they work it out. Luke said he didn't think it would happen for his Mom and Dad.  Outside Aaron's room Julia received a phone call from Jack wanting to see her and talk about JJ. After she hung up, Holden appeared. It gave Julia an opportunity to tell Holden that she didn't expect anything after the other night because she didn't want to jeopardize their friendship. They walked into Aaron's room and when Holden saw Luke he wanted to know why he was there. Luke left and Holden followed him trying to get an answer out of him. Holden told him that he has been acting strange lately. Luke told him he didn't want to talk about it and walked away. Holden went back into the room and asked Aaron what was wrong with Luke. Aaron said Luke was definitely upset but couldn't get any details out of him. Julia left the room and asked to speak to Holden. She wanted to know if Aaron was okay. Holden said something was wrong and he needed to get to the bottom of it. Holden asked her to tell Emma that he would bring home the papers she needed later on. Julia said she would but Emma had gone to visit Iva for a few days. Holden made a comment that he and Julia would be alone but Julia corrected him. After Holden left, Julia said to herself that they would be alone because she would make Jack take JJ for the night. Holden went back into Aaron's room and Lily appeared asking if Aaron wanted to come home with her. Aaron said he was good to go back to his apartment and they would be leaving once the paperwork came. Lily said she would wait for it so Holden could take Aaron home right away. After Aaron left the room, Lily asked Holden how the separation was going. He said, \"Just fine\" and left the room. Luke came back surprising Lily. Lily asked why he was acting so strangely, Luke told her she didn't want to know.  Lily pushed Luke until he told her that he saw Holden kissing Julia.\n\n\nJack and Carly continued to argue about Julia and JJ. Jack was extremely upset with Carly but she wouldn't back down. Jack finally told her that no one, not even her, was going to come between him and JJ. As he left, Lily was at the door. Jack told her if she came to conspire with Carly to get rid of Julia to forget it. Lily came to tell Carly about finding Julia at the cabin with Holden. Lily said Julia was very cordial with her and concerned for Aaron. Carly tried to find an ulterior motive but Lily told her not to make it worse. Lily had learned a lot about herself after Holden left her. She told Carly not to make the same mistake. Later, Carly left Jack a message apologizing for the way she acted. At Emma's, Jack and Julia talked about what Carly was doing. Julia was adamant about not having JJ in an environment that would upset him and she felt that Carly would continue to antagonize her. Jack explained that Carly wouldn't be a problem anymore. Julia wasn't convinced and told Jack that maybe they should try to see how JJ would do at Jack's home. Jack agreed to take JJ home for the night. Carly was waiting at home and was quite surprised when she opened the door and there stood Jack and JJ!\n\n\nCraig and Sierra were at Al's Diner talking about Rafi and Lucy. They were both concerned about Lucy's feeling for both Dusty and Rafi. Craig played it cool and said that Lucy will make the right choice when the time comes. Sierra said that Craig had changed. Craig said he was trying. Jordan walked in on them prompting Craig to leave. Jordan told Sierra that he was glad Sierra and Craig were getting along. Later, Jordan made a call to Lucinda and told her that he wouldn't spy on Sierra anymore. He cared too much for her to jeopardize their friendship. Lucinda, however, had other ideas.\n\n\nLucinda met with Dusty and he showed her the two rings he had bought Lucy. He was going to ask her to marry him. He asked Lucinda what style ring Lucy would like, square cut or pear-shaped. Lucinda said to go with the square one. She also told Dusty to stop worrying about everything and go ask her granddaughter for her hand! At Lucinda's, Craig arrived to find Lucy looking sad and confused. She had just told Rafi that she wasn't in love with him but she did have feelings for him. It just wasn't the same as she felt about Dusty. Craig told Lucy she should go away for awhile and experience things on her own. He told her she was young and had so much to accomplish in her life. He told her it would help her see things more clearly. Lucy said she wanted to go back to school but it was too late because the semester had already started. Craig said if you want to get into Williams, they would accept you anytime. Later, Dusty arrived to propose.\n\n\n\n\n",

Lucinda talks with Dusty and tells him he needs to be with Lucy while Rafi is getting the same advice from Alison. Jack fights with Carly over JJ as Holden shows up at the hospital to see Aaron and Julia appraises him of the fact that Emma has gone to stay at Iva's for awhile.
