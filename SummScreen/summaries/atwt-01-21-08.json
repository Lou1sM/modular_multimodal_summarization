    "soap_central": "\n\nAfter getting lost on their way back to Oakdale, Katie and Brad sleep beside each other in the back of the SUV. Katie wakes thinking she dreamt Brad said he loved her.  She hopes aloud that everything was a dream.  She gets out of the car and monologues all the problems that would come along with Brad loving her and walks off.   Brad wakes and finds Katie missing and frantically yells for her before setting off to find her.  In the meantime, Katie has called Vienna and swears her to secrecy before she tells her that Brad admitted he loved her in his sleep.  Vienna congratulates her friend, but Katie explains that his admission is horrible because it complicates everything.   Katie refuses to believe that a man like Brad could love her and sets out back to the car.  She almost slips down a large hill, but recovers and goes back to the car where she expects to find Brad waiting.  Upon her return she realizes he is gone and decides to wait for him.  While looking for Katie, Brad stumbles and slides down a large hill. He lands with a thump against a fallen tree.   After a long wait in the car, Katie decides to search for Brad.  She finds him unconscious at the bottom of the hill.  Brad wakes up, but he is unable to move because of a broken leg. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Barbara's doctor tells her that her tumor is too large to operate on and he wants to begin chemotherapy immediately to shrink the tumor so it can be removed.  The doctor questions Barbara about why she is there alone since he has told her that she will need the support of her family.  Barbara admits she still hasn't told them.  He reminds her that her family will be an essential part of her recovery and she will need them after each treatment.  The doctor details Barbara's chemotherapy and the side effects, and outlines what she can expect in the future.   His truthful, yet intimidating, explanation causes Barbara to reconsider telling Paul and Will.   \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo and Jack pore over the evidence in Dusty's untimely death and try to determine who killed him.  Jack wonders whether he and Margo are too close to the case because of the possibility that Chris and Holden are the prime suspects in Dusty's murder.  \n\n\nLily sleeps off her overdose in the hospital as Holden keeps vigil by her bed.  As Holden watches her, he remembers her waking the night before and declaring, \"Dusty is dead,\" before he had a chance to tell her of Dusty's killing.  Jack arrives and questions Holden about Lily's overdose and Dusty's role in her problems.  After a few of Jack's inquiries, Holden realizes that Jack is there to see if Holden is responsible for Dusty's death.  Holden recaps the evening, but Jack says the police will need to know exactly where he and Lily were when Dusty died.  Holden explains that he and Lily were together the entire time.   Holden says he was at Lily's bedside throughout the evening and didn't hear of Dusty's death until Lucinda told him, but Jack isn't convinced.  As the two continue their conversation, Lily awakens screaming Dusty's name.   Holden asks Jack to get a doctor as he tries to comfort Lily.  With Jack gone, Lily asks Holden if Dusty is dead.  Lily's doctor examines her and says she can release her if someone will watch her.  Holden states he will care for her and asks Jack for some privacy so Lily can get dressed.  Jack agrees to go, but tells Lily he will need to speak to her before she heads home.  Once he is alone with Lily, Holden asks her when she last saw Dusty.  Lily says she doesn't remember and her only memory is waking up with Holden by her side.  Holden tries to plant the idea in Lily's head that he was with her all night and when Lily asks if she did anything wrong; Holden tells her no, but he recalls finding her in the stairwell with the syringe.   When Lily falls back asleep, she is shocked awake by a dream of Dusty.  Holden reminds her they can go home and that he will take care of her.  Before Jack returns, Holden tells her to tell Jack she remembers nothing and to tell him everything before she tells Jack.  When Jack comes in to question her, Lily does what Holden wants and says she remembers nothing about the previous evening.  Lily begins to cry and Jack asks her why she is so upset.  Lily responds by saying she is ashamed of what she has done.  Lily regains her composure and as she is set to go home she tells Jack the only memory she has from the night before was Holden by her bed.  \n\n\nOut in the hall, Jack runs into Susan and asks her if she remembers anything out of the ordinary from last night.  Susan recalls seeing Holden in the hallway, but doesn't tell Jack what she has seen.  Jack asks her to call him if she remembers anything and Susan agrees.   \n\n\nBack at the farm, Lily apologizes to Holden, but he tells her they need to just put everything behind them and she needs to let him take care of her.  Holden offers to make Lily some tea and sends her upstairs to rest.  Moments later he receives a visit from Bonnie who is surprised to learn that Holden brought Lily back to the farm.  A disappointed Bonnie leaves after realizing that Lily is back to stay.  Alone, Holden reaches into his pocket and finds the syringe he took off Lily the night before.  He gets ready to dispose of it, but Sage comes into the room and wants to help him with a snack for Lily. Holden decides to hide the syringe in the kitchen cabinet.   \n\n\nAfter his meeting with Chris, Tom runs into Barbara in the hallway at Memorial and gives her the bad news about Dusty's death.  Barbara is devastated by the news. \n\n\nSusan finds Chris doing rounds at the hospital and asks if he knows Emily's whereabouts because she never returned home last night.  Chris tells Susan he is unconcerned and in the future Emily is responsible for herself.   Susan leaves as Margo approaches Chris and asks him about the events leading up to Dusty's death.  Chris refuses to talk without his lawyer and Margo tells him to get his lawyer and meet her in two hours.  Chris explains his lawyer has just arrived and he can speak with her now.  Margo turns to meet Chris' lawyer and is surprised to find Tom will be defending his brother.   With Chris's lawyer present, Margo begins questioning Chris.  She asks some tough questions, but Tom steps in and stops the questioning by asking Margo if Chris is a suspect.  Margo explains that Chris is a person of interest and she is trying to place everyone during the time Dusty was killed.  Chris says that after the party he went to the Lakeview, and Margo clarifies that she needs to know his exact movements after the Memo 21 event at Memorial.  \n\n\nMargo finds Jack to talk to him about Holden and Lily, and tells him she's returning to the station.  As Margo gets set to leave Memorial, she bumps into Chris and Tom and tells them she has talked to the bartender at the Lakeview, and that now she knows exactly when Chris arrived.  Chris asks his brother why Margo is questioning him, and Tom tells him that Margo has reason to be suspicious of him, because Chris hated Dusty for sleeping with Emily and trying to ruin his new project at the hospital.  \n\n\nPaul arrives at the church and finds Emily sitting quietly.  He asks her why she is there and she tells him that Dusty is dead.   She explains everything that happened and tells him she was there when it happened.  Emily continues by explaining to Paul that Dusty ruined everything.  Paul questions Emily's anger towards Dusty and she remarks that what he really wants to know is if she killed him.   To this, Paul asks her point blank if she killed Dusty. Emily begins to cry because she knows that Paul is familiar with how angry and destructive she can be.  Paul stops her outburst and offers to take her home.  Emily questions why he is helping her and Paul explains that he treated her badly in the past, but never thought Dusty would treat her badly, too.  Emily recalls threatening Dusty and comments that she never thought Dusty would hurt her, either.  Emily asks why Paul is there and he tells her about losing Meg and their unborn child.  The two recall the shared loss of their baby girl and Paul explains that he shouldn't be a father.  He goes on to tell Emily that Meg criticized his ability to care for anyone.   Emily comforts Paul by telling him he is nothing like his father.  Emily gets set to leave and she tells Paul she is sorry for his loss, but happy she got to see him.  Paul tells her she will be alright, but Emily admits she may never be okay again.  \n\n\nAfter leaving Paul at the church, Emily returns to her room at the Lakeview, where Chris finds her and says they need to talk about last night.  Emily thinks Chris is there to work things out, but Chris stops her and says all he wants to talk about is who killed Dusty.  Chris outlines his morning of being questioned by Margo and tells Emily that she will stay quiet about his hatred for Dusty or he will tell Tom about her being a prostitute and all the reasons she had for wanting Dusty dead.  \n\n\nBarbara arrives at the church and finds Paul.  He asks why she is there and she tells him she just learned of Dusty's death.  She recalls fond memories of Dusty and tells Paul she is there to plan Dusty's funeral.  When she laments about how Dusty always seemed so alone, Paul comments that they are all really alone. \n\n\n",
