    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Metro, Vienna griped to Katie about the spur-of-the-moment cocktail party that Carly ordered her to set up. Katie was hardly listening, however, because she was despondent, thinking her marriage to Brad was over. He had accused her of choosing her brother over him, but Katie was afraid if she recanted her alibi, Craig would go to jail. She had seen how joyous he was at Johnny's return, and she could not put him through another separation from the boy. Vienna added that she thought Brad was noble to be defending Katie's honor. \n\n\nDusty thanked Brad at the Lakeview bar for helping in the attempt to get Craig to do the right thing. Brad echoed Katie's sentiments that he wasn't sure he had a marriage any longer. Dusty cautioned him not to let Craig come between Brad and Katie, and Dusty felt bad for enlisting Brad's aid against their common enemy. Dusty promised he would handle Craig and advised Brad to stay out of it. Brad took a call from Katie and agreed to meet her at Metro. \n\n\nCraig dropped in on Margo at work and invited her to cocktails to celebrate his wonderful news: he was getting married! Margo did not take him seriously until he told her his intended was Carly Tenney. A speechless Margo walked away in shock and then returned to ask if his actions were geared toward getting custody of Johnny. Craig defended life with Carly, telling Margo it would never be dull, but he did not convince his sister. He then accused Margo of being on Jack's side-but asked for her blessing. He also told her he needed a best man, and Margo somewhat relented, but swore she would not wear a tuxedo. Craig invited her to Metro for the engagement announcement, and when she tried to wiggle out of it, he told her she was family and he expected her to be there. \n\n\nAt home, Carly went through bills and reminisced over a wedding picture of her and Jack. She experienced a black-and-white fantasy of life with Craig. Craig was a big-time thug, and Carly was his moll wearing a feather boa. She told Craig off and informed him he did not control her because she called her own shots. Craig said for her to shut up and then smashed half of a grapefruit in her face. Back to reality, Carly asked out loud what she had gotten herself into, and she dashed off to Lily's. \n\n\nLily told her she was insane to even consider marrying Craig Montgomery, so Carly said she wouldn't go through with the wedding, but she didn't know how to back out. She confessed it was nice to have someone on her side for a change, and cited how Craig had stood up to Jack on her behalf and caused Jack to back off. Lily immediately suggested that was Carly's real motivation: she was getting back at Jack for dumping her and marrying Janet. Marrying the man Jack hated most in the world would be glorious payback! \n\n\nCarly said she had since made peace with Jack, and, besides, she liked Craig because he was fun, had a wicked sense of humor, and he was rich. She also missed having a man around, and she reminded Lily that Lily's own sister, Sierra, had stayed married to him for years. Carly felt she had an advantage in that she did not love Craig. She claimed she hadn't made a final decision yet, but Lily was sure she had. Carly's phone rang, and it was Craig inviting her to Metro for a drink, so she said goodbye to Lily. She promised she would tell Craig there was no way she would marry him, and then asked Lily to go with her for courage. \n\n\nJack and Janet read a hand-delivered invitation to cocktails from Carly, but they could not figure out why she wanted to socialize with them. They decided to go, if for no other reason than to find out what she was up to. They changed clothes and left for Metro. \n\n\nDusty and Johnny were passing through the Lakeview lobby when a desk clerk handed Dusty a similar invitation to Metro. This one was signed, \"C,\" so Dusty told Johnny the milkshake he had promised the boy would have to wait a few minutes because they had to see Parker's mom. \n\n\nAt Metro, Brad walked in and found Katie. Vienna left them alone and went to work in the back. Both Katie and Brad declared how miserable they had been apart, and Katie promised to forget about Craig and focus on them as a couple. As they were kissing, Dusty and Johnny came in looking for Carly. Vienna, who had returned, told him Carly would be there shortly. Jack and Janet arrived, so Vienna declared the party officially started. Carly came in, and learned all the guests had assumed the invitations were from her, but she was in the dark, too. \n\n\nSuddenly Craig arrived and announced he had invited them all. Carly was upset and asked Craig what he was doing, so Craig made the big announcement that he and Carly were engaged to be married. Everyone was stunned, and Jack spoke up and said he thought Carly's leaving her kids to run off was the worst thing she could ever do, but she had just topped herself. Craig tried to get Jack to back down, but Dusty threw in the conversation stopper by announcing that what Craig was really after was custody of Johnny. Craig responded hotly, so Katie took Johnny into the kitchen. \n\n\nCraig grabbed Carly and planted a big kiss on her lips to show the world just how happy they were. Jack went after Craig, but Janet held him back. Craig then accused Jack of not letting go of his feelings for Carly. Katie brought Johnny back, and Dusty took the boy's hand and announced they were leaving. Craig detained him and made a move towards Johnny, so Dusty decked him with one punch. A horrified Johnny screamed, \"No!\" \n\n\nDusty ended up in Margo's office in the Oakdale police station on the other side of the desk from a lecture. Lily came and asked to see him, and she told Dusty how atrocious his behavior had been. Dusty said he was afraid Craig would show up in court looking like the perfect family man if he was married. Lily said she did not think Carly would actually marry Craig, and she suggested Dusty apologize to his son and to Craig. \n\n\nCraig and Carly took Johnny home to her house where the boy asked about his \"other daddy.\" Craig asked the lad what was bothering him, so Johnny questioned why Dusty had hit Craig. Carly brought him a brownie with ice cream and told him what had happened between his two daddies would never happen again. Craig promised that, also, and Carly produced crayons and paper to keep the boy occupied. Craig went into the kitchen after her, and she chewed him out for using her to stick it to Jack. She said if that was the way it was going to be, then he could take his lame proposal and get out of her life. Craig asked her why she had agreed to marry him in the first place, and got her to admit some part of it was to get back at Jack. \n\n\nMargo released Dusty, so Lily offered him a ride home. He wanted to stop by Metro and pick up Johnny until she explained that Craig and Carly had taken the boy to Carly's house. Margo warned Dusty to keep his temper in check, and he and Lily left. \n\n\nKatie and Brad danced at Metro, and Katie worried that they had let Johnny go home with Craig and Carly. Brad told her to let all that go, and Vienna poured them some more champagne. \n\n\nDusty rang Carly's doorbell, and she let him in. She told Dusty that Johnny was sleeping on the couch and was welcome to spend the night, but Dusty walked in without saying a word, picked up the sleeping boy, and went out.\n\n\n",
