Jack, who was calling from the Oakdale police station where he had spent the night, offered to pick up the boy's homework from school, and Parker appreciated it.  Jack asked to speak to Carly, so Parker yelled for his mother who was in the kitchen pouring him a glass of orange juice.  When Carly heard who was calling, however, she kept mum and did not take the call.  Jack said he would call back later.  \n\n\n\n\nWhen Carly brought Parker his orange juice, he told her about Jack's call and mentioned that his dad was bringing his homework.  Carly flashed back to how Jack had kissed her on his last visit to the house, and she asked Parker if he would be all right alone for a while.  She said she had something she had to do, and she hurried out.  Carly went immediately to an AA meeting where she shared that she and Jack had really kissed.  She referred to Jack as the love of her life, so she wondered if reconciling with him fell under the category of new relationships which the rehab counselors discouraged.  She said that, although he hadn't said it lately, she knew that Jack loved her.\n\n\nMargo arrived at the station and knew where Jack had bunked. He asked to speak with her privately, and they went into the interview room where Jack said that he wanted to return to work.  Margo asked if he was ready to resume the responsibility, and Jack gave her his litany of reasons.  Margo's response was a resounding, \"Bull!\"  She was worried about the state of mind of a cop who was estranged from his wife, homeless, and brooding about his ex-wife.  Jack said he wouldn't have asked for his job back if he couldn't handle it, but Margo suggested that he get his personal life back on track, and then he could concentrate on his job.\n\n\nJanet and Liberty went to the high school because Liberty did not want to miss her biology midterm, and Janet wished to speak with the principal.  Liberty was unhappy that her mother wanted to tell the principal and the school nurse that she was ill, but Janet thought that someone in authority should know about her daughter's condition in case there was a problem at school. Janet said that Liberty needed to reach out to the people who could support her, and she suggested that the girl tell her best friend, McKenzie.\n\n\nLiberty then asked her mother why she had not told Jack about her condition, and Janet's excuse was that she had been concentrating solely on her daughter.  Janet promised to think about telling Jack, and she sent Liberty off to class.  She headed down the hall and ran straight into Jack.  He explained that he was there to pick up Parker's homework, and Janet said that she was there to speak to the principal. She almost broke down and told Jack about Liberty's illness, but instead she told a fib about having to make her daughter crack the books a bit harder.\n\n\nJack apologized for not being around for the girl lately, and then he asked if Janet still wanted to work on their marriage.  He said that he'd been staying at the police station, so Janet assumed that he was back at work.  He told her, however, what Margo's conditions for reinstatement were, and Janet asked if he wanted to talk with her just so he could get his job back.  Jack protested, but Janet turned down his offer of coffee and walked away.  \n\n\n\n\nLiberty met up with her friend, McKenzie, and told her about the adventure in the woods with Parker.  \"Mac\" was very worried about the biology midterm exam, and she told Liberty that if she didn't ace it, \"Mac\" would never get accepted to Princeton.  Liberty considered her friend's words but did not follow here into the classroom.  Instead she left and walked to Carly's house to see Parker.  He was surprised to see her and asked her about the biology test, but Liberty said it was certainly not a \"matter of life or death.\"\n\n\n\n\nLiberty wanted to take Parker out somewhere to \"do something crazy,\" but he explained that his leg hurt every time he moved it.  Liberty announced that they would just have to do \"something crazy\" there at the house, and she began nuzzling Parker's neck.  The she asked him to go upstairs with her and have sex, but Parker asked why.  He did not understand what Liberty wanted, and that angered her.  She made a break for the door, so Parker shouted that he would break his leg again chasing her if she ran out, so Liberty stopped.  \n\n\n\n\nParker said that whatever was wrong, she had to tell him, and they would \"fix it together.\"  Liberty began to cry and blurted out that she had leukemia.  Parker was silent, and then he began to laugh and said that she was tricking him.  Liberty said it was true, and then Parker realized she was not lying, and he hugged her.  He said there was no way she was going to die, and he promised to be at her side every step of the way to her recovery.\n\n\nTeri arrived at Metro, and she irritated Dusty by calling him \"Boss.\"  She asked when Janet was starting her shift, but Dusty said that her sister was in no shape to work that day.  Teri said she hadn't spoken to Janet in a couple of days, so Dusty broke the news that Liberty was sick.  When Teri asked for more information, Dusty said the girl had leukemia.  Teri was stunned and wanted to call Janet immediately, but Dusty advised her to wait until her brain had processed the information a bit more.  He said Janet shouldn't have to comfort her.\n\n\nDusty then said that Liberty was out of the hospital, and they were awaiting the results of more tests.  Teri wondered aloud how Dusty knew so many details, and he said that he had been with Janet when she had gotten the news.  Teri asked if Jack knew, and Dusty said that he certainly hoped so.  Teri said that Janet and Jack would surely put aside their marital dispute to rally around Liberty, as long as nobody got in the way.  Dusty asked her whom she meant, and Teri answered, \"Carly.\"\n\n\n\n\nJanet showed up at Metro and told Dusty that she had gone to the high school with Liberty with the intention of telling the principal about her daughter's condition, but instead she had run into Jack.  Dusty was disappointed that Janet had not told her husband about Liberty, as Janet said that she wanted to be friends with Dusty.  He also remarked that she ought to talk to her husband.  Janet admitted that she would rather talk to Dusty than Jack about Liberty.\n\n\nDusty said that he had to take Johnny to Memorial for a checkup since Craig was out of town, so he called to Teri in the kitchen to talk to her sister.  The women hugged, and Janet told Teri that she had not given Jack the news yet.  Teri asked what she could do, but Janet couldn't even discuss Liberty with her sister.\n\n\nJohnny had his checkup, and as he and Dusty were leaving the hospital, Liberty's admitting doctor called to Dusty.  He was looking for Janet, but he was willing to share the girl's latest test results with such a close friend of the family.  Dusty tactfully suggested that the doctor discuss that with the family, and he excused himself and took Johnny away.  The boy asked immediately if Liberty was sick and Dusty said that she was.  Johnny asked if Liberty was going to die \"like mommy,\" but Dusty said that Liberty's family would make sure she had \"all the right doctors\" so she would get well.  Then he offered an ice cream sundae at the diner, and that distracted Johnny.\n\n\nJohnny was enjoying his sundae when Margo walked in and gave him a big hug.  She and Dusty stepped away from the boy as Margo said that Craig had mentioned that Johnny had been talking a lot about his mother lately.  Margo suggested that Dusty tell him about Jennifer, and then she said that she hoped Dusty found himself another special woman.\n\n\nJack went to a small lake and remembered how, years ago, he and Carly used to meet at a boathouse there.  He particularly recalled a day when he was working on a boat named \"True Love,\" which he had named for Carly, and she had walked in wearing a pink dress.  They had tried to stay away from one another, but Carly had told Jack that she loved him and could not bear to be apart from him.  Jack said aloud, \"We've made so many mistakes,\" and Carly walked up behind him and suggested that they not make another one.  \n\n\n\n\nCarly said that after Jack had called, she had attended an AA meeting because he was like an addictive drug to her.  She compared him to alcohol, and said she just couldn't stop where he was concerned.  It was easier, she went on, never to start with him again, so there would be no more kisses, no more \"hanging out.\"  She was insistent, and Jack agreed.  He said he had not gone to the lake to feel guilty for kissing her but because he wanted to remember the times with her in the boathouse.  Carly suggested they just walk away from each other and keep their distance.  Jack concurred, but he said to her, \"You first.\"\n\n\n\n\nCarly told Jack to go home to Janet, but he was sure that Janet was no longer interested in their marriage.  He said she had walked away from him at the high school, and he had not bothered to go after her.  Instead, he had driven to the lake because it was too late for his marriage.  Carly told Jack to leave her alone, and she turned away, but Jack called her back.  He said they had to face their feelings, and he thanked her for bringing him back from the brink after Brad's death.  He said no one else could have done that, but Carly informed Jack that she couldn't tell him how she felt.  Jack asked her to show him, and Carly kissed him.  Then she pulled away and insisted that Jack tell Janet face-to- face before he and she went any further.  Jack was positive that he wanted to try again with Carly, and he promised to go directly to Janet.  Carly said that when he was finished with that, he should return to her.\n\n\nCarly went home carrying an armful of yellow daffodils.  She told Parker that the flowers would cheer him up, and she appeared almost euphoric.  \"Not likely,\" remarked Parker, and his mother asked him what he had to be so sad about.  Carly said for the first time in a long while, she was excited for life and was looking forward to what would happen next.  Parker said his mother's cheerfulness had given him a headache, and he went up to his room.  Carly picked up the phone and ordered a large pizza, and as an afterthought, she added a six pack of beer to the order.  \"For Jack,\" she said softly.\n\n\nJack went to the farm, but he almost didn't go inside.  He forced himself, however, and found Janet crying softly at the kitchen table.  He asked her what was wrong, and Janet threw her arms around him and said it was about Liberty.  Then she told him how thankful she was that he was home.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liberty doesn't want to tell anyone she has leukemia but Janet encourages her to tell her close friends because she will need some support. Liberty tells Janet to take her own advice and tell Jack about her illness so that he can offer moral support to her. It seems, though, that the only person Janet can talk to is Dusty who is trying his best to put some distance between him and Janet because he knows the right thing to do is for Janet to be with Jack. Dusty also advises Janet to tell Jack about Liberty's illness. The doctor wants to tell Dusty about Liberty's tests and next course of treatment but he tells the doctor to discuss that with the family. Johnny asks Dusty if Liberty is going to die just like his mommy died. Dusty tells Johnny that the situation with Liberty is different and she has good doctors that will help her survive.
