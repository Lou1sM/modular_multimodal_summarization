Parker came out to see him and asked him if he knew if he was ever going to see Carly again. Paul said he didn't know and the visions were a burden. Parker left and Paul threw the picture back into the fire. He then had a vision of blood flooding the hospital floor.\n\n\nMeg attended to a patient in the hospital when suddenly the monitors went off. Meg called a code blue and a doctor came into help. After their attempts to save the woman failed, Dr. Bob came by to console her. Then Craig showed up and tried to reassure her. Craig wondered if Paul was on her mind and then offered to take her out. She declined but on good terms. Later as she was leaving, Dr. Bob asked her to stay and help with the blood drive. She agreed. \n\n\nKatie asked Mike, at home, if he forgave her. He said he did. She then asked him if they should start back trying to have a baby. Mike said it was too soon. She wanted to know if he was 100% in their relationship, and if he wasn't he should leave. Mike told her it would take a while to get back to that point. They went to see Tom at home.\n\n\nTom was brought home from the hospital. Maddie made him a healthy breakfast and he sat down to enjoy it. Adam was there too. Casey showed up and Margo caught him outside. She discovered his poor grades and agreed to not tell Tom about them just yet. Back inside Margo went to get some of her mad money and discovered it was missing. They tried to figure out where it went when Mike and Katie came in. Adam and Casey leave. Adam grabbed Casey outside and asked him if he stole the money. Casey denied it. Maddie came out and she and Casey went to Java. Back inside Margo told Katie it was probably best to wait on a family. Katie planned a party for all the good news. \n\n\nAt Java, Casey confessed to Maddie about his bad grades. Maddie blamed the gambling. Casey said it wasn't a problem anymore. He pulled out his laptop to work on a paper. Maddie left him to it. He went to the poker site. \n\n\nAt Emma's, Jack and Brad caught up. Brad called Carly a lying tramp and Jack said to stop all the Carly bashing. Jack asked him why he was back. He said it was to help out around the farm and to take a break from his factory job. Vienna showed up. Jack introduced her to his shirtless brother. Vienna explained she had been banished from Leonia and needed a place to stay. Since Emma was OK with it, Jack agreed. Jack told her she had to pull her weight around there and had Vienna stacking firewood. He asked again why she was there. She said it was the people. She went for a walk. Brad congratulated Jack for still having what it takes with the ladies, after watching him with Vienna. \n\n\n",

Margo finds Casey's grades that he was trying to hide from her, and is upset to see how poorly he did this semester, but agrees not to tell Tom right now.
