This leads them to believe the most likely suspects are Chris and Craig, both of whom were involved with the new research project. Craig arrives at the station because Margo called him. He thought she might be offering sympathy for his breakup with Meg, but instead, she asks him why he wasn't at the party the night before. He says he was too upset about his breakup with Meg to go to a party. Instead, he went to the airport and looked for a flight out of town, but then he changed his mind and drove back to the Lakeview. When Margo asks if he has any witnesses to that, he realizes she thinks he may have killed Dusty. He says he didn't kill Dusty, even though he hated him for driving Lucy and Johnny away, and putting a bullet through his chest. He is upset that Margo always thinks of him as a suspect. She says the opposite is true, that she always wants to believe he's innocent and even went looking for something that would clear him but couldn't find anything. He thanks her for that and then leaves.\n\n\nBarbara goes to the Snyder farm and tells Meg that she's organized a funeral for Dusty for the next day, saying Dusty was still her son-in-law and part of her family. She also offers Meg condolences on the loss of her baby, but Meg says she doesn't want to talk to her or Paul about it. Barbara points out that both she and Paul are also grieving the loss of this child, but Meg doesn't care and says she won't come to the funeral if Barbara's going to try to get her to forgive Paul. Barbara leaves but asks her again to please come, saying Dusty would have wanted her there.\n\n\nBarbara runs into Craig in Old Town and overhears him leaving a message for Meg. She snipes at him that Meg doesn't want anything to do with him, and he tells her she sounds \"a bit off.\" She says it's because she's planning Dusty's funeral, and that he made Dusty's last months miserable, because it was his fault Dusty didn't have his son with him. Craig firmly tells her that Johnny is his son and that one day, he will have him back again. Barbara tells him not to even think about showing up at Dusty's funeral, saying no one wants him there, \"least of all Meg.\" She leaves Craig to ponder that idea. Craig then calls someone at work and reschedules some meetings, saying he has a funeral to go to tomorrow.\n\n\nAt Old Town, Jack runs into Parker and two slightly older friends who are trying to get Parker to go to a beer party. One of the boys is smoking, and Jack tells him to put out the cigarette because he's not old enough to smoke. Parker introduces them to Jack, but they make a hasty retreat. Jack asks who they are, and Parker says they're on his hockey team. Jack reminds him that he was supposed to go straight home after school because he's grounded. Parker tries to change the subject to Sam and Carly, but Jack takes him to Al's Diner for a bite to eat and tells him Carly can handle Sam. When Jack reminds Parker how he and Carly feel about drinking and smoking, Parker asks why they're allowed to screw up and no one calls them on it. Jack says they aren't happy with it, and that's called \"guilt.\" Parker asks what would happens if Carly started dating Sam, but Jack says she'd never date a man whose best friend is a wooden doll. He tells Parker if he wants to help them, he needs to help himself and stay clean-no drinking, drugs, or cigarettes. Then he tells Parker to go on back to the farm. \n\n\nAt Metro, Sam tells Carly it's a little lonely hanging out there all the time now that he's bunking there, too. He asks if she wants to go grab a bite to eat. She says she would, but she's on her way to visit her sister. She thanks Sam, and tells him he's a real pal. She leaves, and Cowboy Jack tells Sam that he needs to make a move on Carly before she calls him a \"pal\" again. The phone rings, and it's Kit, who tells Sam that her court date's been postponed for the third time and that she misses him. He suggests she not call Carly at Metro anymore, and she asks why. He says Carly needs some space because of what happened, and because of Jack. Kit wonders if Sam is getting involved with Carly. He assures her that he's not and tells her he's now living at Metro. He tells her he'll call her every day to keep her updated on how Metro is doing, and she asks him to keep sending her love letters. He tells her he loves her and hangs up. He picks up Cowboy Jack and says he'll win Carly over the same way he won Kit over, through a letter. He begins writing something down.\n\n\nCarly goes to see Rosanna, who tells her that Paul broke up with her. When Carly asks why, Rosanna tells her about the DNA test results and how she switched them. Carly says she doesn't think she knows how to help Rosanna get Paul to forgive her for something like that. Rosanna nearly faints, and Carly makes her lie down, telling her she needs to get some rest and reminding her that her doctors told her to be careful. When Rosanna asks what she can do about Paul, Carly tells her to take the high road and be the woman that Paul fell in love with. She tells Rosanna to rest, and she leaves, but Rosanna gets up and leaves, too.\n\n\nRosanna goes to the Snyder farm, where she tells Meg she's there to get her husband. She offers her condolences about Meg's miscarriage. Meg says Rosanna's responsible for the whole thing, because if not for her, Paul would have known right away that he was the baby's father, and they would have been together all along. Rosanna says the miscarriage probably would still have happened and then reminds Meg that she and Craig aren't the ones who broke their wedding vows. Meg asks why Rosanna wants Paul back if she feels he's so much to blame, and Rosanna says, \"Because I love him. Because I need him. Because I would forgive him anything. Would you?\" Meg tells her to get out.\n\n\nParker arrives back at the farm and finds Rosanna sitting on the porch. He greets his aunt and asks how Paul is. Rosanna asks him if he's seen Paul, maybe visiting Meg. Meg comes out and suggests that Parker go inside and call Jack to let him know he's home. Then, Meg tells Rosanna she can't believe Rosanna was asking Parker about Paul. Rosanna says she wouldn't have asked him if Meg had been more forthcoming, then asks Meg if she still loves Paul. When Meg doesn't answer, Rosanna says, \"I'll go ask Parker!\" Meg replies that yes, she still loves Paul, but no longer wants to be with him given everything that's happened. She tells Rosanna to \"go for it\" if she thinks she can get Paul back, but doubts Paul will ever forgive her. Rosanna says Meg is underestimating both Paul and Rosanna. She leaves and calls Paul, leaving a message that says she needs to see him in person right away.\n\n\nWhen Carly returns to Metro, Sam tells her he received a \"Dear John\" letter from Kit. Carly can't believe it and says she'll call Kit and talk some sense into her, but Sam says that would just make things worse. Carly thinks Kit will want Sam back after her legal troubles are over, but Sam says he can never seem to make Kit happy. Seeing how sad Sam looks, Carly suggests they go out after all and grab something to eat. After getting dressed up, they meet at the Lakeview. Carly likes the song that's playing, so Sam insists that they dance to it. At that moment, Jack arrives, having come to collect Dusty's things and take them to the station. On his way out, he sees Carly and Sam dancing and walks over by them. Carly sees him and abruptly stops dancing. She tries to explain about Sam being a little bit down, but Jack stops her and says she doesn't have to explain anything to him. He leaves as Carly watches, frustrated.\n\n\nIn the middle of the snowy woods, Brad has fallen down a hill and broken his leg. Katie finds a stick he can use to help support his weight, lifs him up off the ground, and starts to walk him back up to their car. Brad turns to look at her, though, and tries to kiss her. He loses his balance, sending them both tumbling back down the hill. Katie manages to get Brad up again, and they make their way to the car, but when Katie tries to start it, they discover the battery is dead. They can't get any cell phone reception, and Katie begins to panic. Brad says his head hurts, and Katie sees that he's cut his head and is bleeding. Worried he has a concussion, she tells a drowsy Brad that he can't fall asleep, and instead, she tells him they should play a game. She wants him to name ten things he knows about her, and he begins doing so, but becomes a little disoriented in the middle of it and asks for a kiss. She kisses him and realizes he is feverish, too. She tells him she's going to walk away from the car, because earlier, she was able to get reception on her cell phone when she went walking. She tells Brad to stay awake, and he says he will, but when she leaves, he nods off. When he wakes up again, he's confused and tries to get out of the car. He falls down again. Katie finds a spot where the cell phone works and is able to call 9-1-1 and ask for help. She returns to the car to find Brad on the ground and asks him what happened. He tells her he didn't know where she had gone. She tells him she got through to 9-1-1 and that they were able to locate her by the cell phone signal and had sent an ambulance and a tow truck. \n\n\n",
