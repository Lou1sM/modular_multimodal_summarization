She was very anxious to find out whether Derek Coburn was her biological father. Casey went on to the park with his skateboard and saw Derek sitting on a bench. Casey asked if Derek was not supposed to be at the hospital finding out the results with Jade, but Derek said he already knew he was Jade's father. Casey urged him to be there for his newfound daughter. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Bonnie left a message for the missing Derek, telling him the same thing: he needed to exhibit enough interest to show up and find out the verdict. Jade arrived and was not surprised that Derek was a no-show. Alison came with the paperwork, but Jade wanted to wait a bit for Derek. Alison told her and Bonnie that Derek had already been there, and she had told him the results. The women were surprised, but ready to hear the news. Alison said the test proved that Derek was, indeed, Alison's birth father. Jade assumed that Derek was absent because he was unhappy with the results, but Bonnie was concerned for him and left to find him. \n\n\nDusty sat at Emily's desk in the Intruder office and talked with Tom Hughes about his dustup with Craig at Metro. Emily came in and remarked that Dusty had not been happy since he had returned to Oakdale. She also mentioned his trouble with Craig, and Dusty said his nemesis had come up with some interesting strategies in the custody battle for Johnny. Emily said she knew how much Dusty cared for the boy and asked if she could be of help. Dusty confided that Craig was marrying Carly, and Emily suggested that Dusty could play that game, as well. Dusty could not figure out who would be his best candidate to marry, so Emily suggested herself. Dusty thought she was kidding, but when he realized she was not, he said the idea was crazy. \n\n\nEmily blamed herself for not stopping Paul from keeping Johnny from Jennifer and was eager to help Johnny. Dusty reminded her how angry she had been with him lately, but Emily assured him she was past that. She knew the marriage would be strictly one of convenience with no expectations on her part. Dusty said it was just not possible, but he hesitated to say why. Emily soon realized that it was because of her past history as a prostitute, and that angered her. She threw it up to Dusty that someone who had faked his own death was not exactly good daddy material. Dusty said he appreciated her offer and walked out. Emily hurled her glass against the closed door. \n\n\nMeg played with Eliza as Emma enjoyed looking at her new granddaughter. Paul knocked on the door, but Emma refused to let him in until Meg intervened. Paul brought two large bags of baby clothes and toys and asked to take the baby on a sleigh ride as soon as they had enough snow. Emma was nasty to Paul, and when Meg took the bags upstairs, Emma demanded that Paul hand over the baby to her. Paul refused and they argued until Meg returned and asked her mother to back off. Paul thanked Meg and reassured her he would never hurt baby Eliza. He finally got tired of Emma's constant scrutiny and proposed that he and Meg go back to Fairwinds, but Emma declared the baby would leave the house over her dead body. Meg talked with Emma until Emma walked into her parlor in a huff. Meg and Paul packed up Eliza and her equipment, and Paul went to sort out the car seat. Emma came back and apologized to Meg, but when she realized Meg was taking the baby out, she was fearful. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Bonnie dropped her purse and Casey helped her pick up her things. She was looking for Jade, and Casey told her he had seen the girl earlier. Bonnie then realized that Casey already knew the DNA test results and questioned him about that. He said he had seen Derek in the park, and he had said he was the last thing Jade needed. Bonnie went to the park and found Derek. She told him she had never taken him for a coward, but he asked to deal with the news in his own way. Bonnie recognized that Derek was feeling inadequate and was afraid Jade would realize she was better off having no father. He and Jade had nothing in common, voiced Derek, and he said he barely remembered Rose D'Angelo, her mother. Bonnie tried to reassure him he was still worth knowing. \n\n\nAlison found Jade crying in a stairwell in the hospital. She sympathized with her and told her the two of them shared something: their fathers' rejection. Jade exclaimed she didn't need a pep talk, but Alison said Jade must not take Derek's disinterest personally. Jade took a call from Bonnie, who asked her to come to Metro, so she took off. Alison next saw Casey and talked with him about parental rejections. Alison got emotional, and Casey took her to Java for coffee. There, she told him how inconvenient she was to her father and his new family, and described how the business with Jade and Derek had brought it all back to her. She said she felt she could tell Casey anything, and they shared a close moment until Emily interrupted. She said she needed to speak with Alison privately, so Casey excused himself and went back to work. Emily said she was having a rough day and didn't think she could stomach watching her little sister take another man from her. Alison denied there was anything between Casey and her, but then Emily brought up how Alison had slept with Dusty. She demanded Alison stay away from Casey. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul and Meg changed their baby, and Paul produced a beautiful bassinet for Eliza's nap. He put the baby down, and she instantly fell asleep, much to Meg's amazement. Paul urged Meg to stay longer and let the baby sleep, so the two of them watched their daughter. Paul moved in closer and finally kissed Meg, something Meg found out of bounds. She said going to Fairwinds had been a mistake, although Paul begged for another chance, and Meg took the baby and walked out. \n\n\nAt Metro, Jade discovered Bonnie was not alone; Derek was also there. He apologized for not being at the hospital when she heard the paternity news, but their attempts at finding a common ground to talk about did not go well. Bonnie suggested the two take some time to get to know each other, but Derek's first question to his daughter was about her relationship with Robby Sanchez, the holdup man. Jade immediately accused Derek of judging her and called him an ex-con. Bonnie played referee and asked them both to take a step back. Derek took out a wad of money and attempted to give it to Jade, who refused it and stormed out. \n\n\nPaul went back to the farm, searching for Meg. Emma accused him of doing harm to her girls and yelled at him to let Meg go on with her life. Paul said Meg still wanted him, no matter what her mother thought, and that was what was bothering her so much. He vowed to get his little family back. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty saw Meg and the baby at the front desk asking for Barbara Ryan. Barbara was not home, and Meg told Dusty that Paul had not hurt her or the baby, but, as usual, had gone too far by kissing her. Dusty said her getting back together with Paul would be the worst thing that could happen to her. Meg said she realized she could never let Paul get too close again, and Dusty offered a solution. Suddenly he asked Meg to marry him.\n\n\n",
