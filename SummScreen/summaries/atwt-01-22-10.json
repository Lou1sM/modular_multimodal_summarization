He agreed to perform Noah's surgery that day, just to get away from there. Luke questioned Reid's decision to perform an impromptu surgery. Reid reminded Luke that Luke had kidnapped Reid to perform the procedure, and that was what Reid would do, if Noah okayed it. Noah responded that he was more than ready to do it that day.\n\n\n       When Reid saw Bob in the corridor, Reid noted that Bob looked important. Bob frowned as Reid ordered an operating room, a \"neuro team,\" and a host of equipment. \"Who are you? What are you doing in my hospital?\" Bob asked. Luke introduced Reid as the neurologist that Luke had flown in from Texas. Bob recalled granting Reid temporary privileges, but Bob had no idea that Reid intended to perform surgery that day. \"Well...now you do,\" Reid quipped.\n\n\n       Luke and Reid returned to Noah's room to get the consent form, but Luke urged Noah to slow down and at least read the paperwork first. Reid noted that Luke had stressed the urgency of the situation before, but Luke's procrastination made Reid think that the trip was a waste.\n\n\nBob pulled Reid into the corridor to warn him against rushing Noah into the risky procedure. Bob cited that the surgery could worsen Noah's condition, or even kill him. Reid made a flippant remark, and Bob pointedly said that the patient and his partner were scared to death because Reid had under-informed them. Bob ordered Reid to reassure Noah, and once Reid received proper consent, Bob and the staff would fully assist Reid.\n\n\nReid returned to Noah's room to explain that the procedure had no guarantees and it could kill Noah; however, if Noah wanted his vision back, Reid was the best man for the job. Luke said that it didn't have to be done that day, but Noah insisted upon forging ahead.\n\n\nNoah signed the consent, and Reid took it to Bob. Kim overheard Reid arrogantly spewing orders to Bob, and when Reid strode off, she said that she wouldn't let that man operate on her. Bob said that, though Reid was unbearable, he was a genius.\n\n\nReid prepped Noah for surgery, but after reviewing Noah's scans, Reid realized that Noah would require multiple procedures. Reid stated to Luke that Reid had signed on for a \"one-night stand,\" not a long-term commitment. Reid intended to leave, and he remarked that Luke should be lucky that Reid hadn't carved into Noah's brain unnecessarily.\n\n\nReid walked off, and Bob and Kim stated that they'd help Noah and Luke map out the next steps later. Luke saw Reid in the corridor again and insisted that Reid help. Reid refused to do \"drive-by\" surgery with only a 20% chance that Noah would make it. Luke prohibited Reid from taking the Grimaldi jet home, and Reid snickered that it was a big surprise that Luke would take his toys away when he didn't get what he wanted.\n\n\nLater in Noah's room, Luke broke the news to Noah, who brooded about it in bed. Luke ventured into the hallway to hear Reid on the phone discussing flight delays due to inclement weather. Luke pleaded with Reid to talk to Noah and Luke about a treatment plan, but Reid flatly refused to take Noah's case. Reid said that none of Luke's money or possessions impressed Reid, except for Luke's car, which Reid insisted would take him to the airport.\n\n\nIn the parking garage, Bob walked Kim to her car. Meanwhile, Luke showed his car to Reid, but Luke refused to drive Reid anywhere. Reid decided to drive himself in Luke's car. Luke hopped on the hood, but Reid drove forward anyway. Luke hopped off just before Reid collided with Kim's car as Kim backed out of her parking space.\n\n\n       Jack arrived at the farm to find Janet crying. Janet clung to him and revealed that Liberty had leukemia. Janet explained the situation, and Jack wondered why it had taken her so long to tell him. She replied that she hadn't known how to tell him, and she'd also been unable to locate him. Janet sobbed that Liberty needed her mother, but Janet just wanted to run off and hide. \"You don't need to go through this alone. I'm here,\" Jack stated, hugging her.\n\n\n       Janet asked what \"being here\" meant, because she needed her husband, not pity or a friend to lean on. Jack responded that he was her husband and Liberty's stepfather. Janet hugged him, and he sent her to rest. Jack grimaced and followed her upstairs. Fully dressed on the bed, Jack cuddled Janet and urged her to nap. She asked about Carly. He sighed and advised her to concentrate on Liberty, not Carly.\n\n\n       At home, Carly prepared for a family evening with Jack. She recalled Jack's earlier promise to end things with Janet. Carly frowned when Craig arrived to discuss a business opportunity. She said she wasn't interested in vodka, water, or clubs anymore. The thought of working on Liberty's design portfolio had helped Carly decide to return to fashion. Craig offered to revive Monte Carlo, but Carly said that it wouldn't happen.\n\n\n       A deliveryman arrived with pizza and beer. Craig worried about Carly having beer in the house, but then he scoffed upon realizing that it was for Jack. \"You've got to be kidding me!\" Craig exclaimed. He said that he should have known it by how Jack had acted at Katie's party. \"And the couch. Nobody sleeps on that thing unless they're hoping for an upgrade,\" Craig added.\n\n\nCraig warned that tangling with Jack again would end in disaster. Carly claimed that Jack and she had learned from their mistakes, but Craig replied that there were newer and bigger mistakes to be made. Craig asked if it bothered her that Jack was still married. Carly said that she and Jack wouldn't move forward until Jack's marriage ended. Craig quipped that nothing could stop Carly, because \"what Carly wants, Carly gets.\" Carly swung open the door to toss Craig out, and she saw Jack on the threshold. Craig sarcastically wished them the best and left.\n\n\n       Carly asked Jack how it had gone with Janet, but from the pitiful look on his face, she deduced that he hadn't told Janet anything. In Jack's conflicted silence, Carly assumed that he'd changed his mind about them. She promised that rehab had changed her, and she wouldn't let him down. Jack stated that the problem wasn't Carly; it was Liberty, who had leukemia. Jack felt that it would be different if Brad were alive; however, Jack had been the reason that Brad couldn't be there for Janet and Liberty when they needed him most.\n\n\n       Carly guessed that Janet had asked him to return home, and he'd agreed. Jack explained that Liberty was everything to Janet, and he'd made Janet a vow. Carly recalled that he'd vowed to Carly, too, and more than once. Jack regretfully stated that he couldn't walk out on Janet.\n\n\n       Carly understood who Jack was, and his sense of duty was what she loved most about him. \"I love you, too,\" he uttered. Carly realized that it wasn't their time. She knew what it was like to have all of him, and she refused to settle for anything less. Jack said that he had to go. He leaned toward Carly and nuzzled his nose against hers. She choked back tears as he walked out.\n\n\n       Once alone, Carly trembled and stared at the beer. She went to throw it out but changed her mind. She grabbed her coat and left the house with the six-pack.\n\n\nDusty visited Bob to get a recommendation to a New York oncologist for Liberty. Bob agreed to help, but he wondered what it had to do with Dusty. Dusty responded that Janet worked for him, so he wanted to get her daughter the best care possible.\n\n\nLater, Dusty found Craig drinking at the Lakeview. Dusty noted Craig's foul mood, and Craig said he'd just collided with an immovable force. \"To Carjack,\" Craig bitterly toasted. Dusty asked about Janet, and Craig guessed that she'd be left in the cold, just like Craig. Dusty quipped that Craig deserved it, unlike Janet. Dusty left Craig to enjoy his pity party alone. Around the corner, Dusty called to have his assistant cancel his meetings and arrange an extra airline ticket to New York, so that he could go with Janet and Liberty.\n\n\nBack at the farm, Janet awakened alone in bed with Jack's scarf. She stroked it against her face and then went to answer the knock at the door. Dusty entered, and a glowing Janet thanked him for urging her to talk to Jack. Dusty seemed puzzled when Janet explained that Jack and she had decided to work on their marriage.\n\n\nDusty claimed that he was happy for Janet. \"What happened between you and me...\" Janet started to say. Dusty said that it wasn't his secret to tell. He handed her an itinerary with three tickets to New York and stated that they were for Janet, Jack, and Liberty. Janet wondered how Dusty knew that Jack would go, and Dusty murmured that it was because Jack was a good guy. Janet hugged Dusty and said that she was glad to have found an amazing friend in him.\n\n\nOn the street in Old Town, Craig saw Jack and immediately derided him for gearing up to kick Carly in the teeth all over again. Craig stated that he'd do anything to have a love like Carly's, and he wondered what Jack did to her that no one else could do. Jack grabbed Craig by his lapels, slammed him into a wall, and snarled at him to shut up. Craig claimed that Jack was no good for Carly, but Jack snapped that he never wanted to hear Craig dictate what was good for Carly ever again. \n\n\n",
