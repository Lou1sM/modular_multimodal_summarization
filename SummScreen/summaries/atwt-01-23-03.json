Marshall gives Jessica a hug in appreciation for helping out with trying to find his daughter.  Ben walks by and sees the two hugging.  He walks into the room and clears his throat.  Jessica turns around and tells Ben that she was giving Marshall some good news about his daughter.  Ben asks Jessica to excuse them.  Jessica turns to Marshall and says that she will come by later and give him an update.  Jessica leaves and Ben asks, \"So how many times do I have to ask the same question and not get an answer?\"  Marshall asks, \"What question is that?\"  Ben asks, \"What is the real deal between you and Jessica?\"  Marshall tells Ben that Jessica is helping him find his daughter and she is going to Washington to be his advocate.  Ben asks if Marshall asked Jessica to do this or did she volunteer.  Marshall says that she volunteered.  Ben asks if this was a deal that if she volunteered to help Marshall then Marshall would back off on the accusations that he tried to kill him.  Marshall tells Ben that he had better get off his wounded lover routine and he tells him what kind of woman he will be losing.  Marshall reassures Ben that when Jessica gets tired of him and she walks away, he will be there waiting.  Ben turns and walks out of the room.  \n\n\nAaron rushes over to see Lucy.  At first it seems that everything that Aaron says just brings Lucy down.  Finally, Aaron says that they need to do something fun.  He says that he would like to go outside for a walk with Lucy, but the weather is miserable.  Then he says that they will just tool around the hotel.  He gets behind her wheelchair and tells her to hang on because he is going to take her on the ride of her life.  Aaron pushes her very fast out the door.  Later, they return and Lucy is laughing, but she tells him that he almost dumped her out going around that one corner.  He tells her that he will have to bring her helmet the next time.  She asks which helmet it that.  He starts to answer and then she tells him to wait.  She has a flashback of when he gave her the helmet.  She tells him that she remembers that the helmet is black with stickers on it and he gave it to her to ride on his motorcycle.  Aaron is so excited that she remembered about getting the helmet.  She tells him that he is like a magic potion and she feels so good having him around.  She asks him to stay around forever.  He says that he will and the two share a kiss.  \n\n\nAlison meets Craig at the coffee house.  She has an attitude about Craig \"needing\" her now.  Craig tells her to lose the attitude, but she keeps the smug look on her face.  Craig tells her that he does need her to help out with Aaron but they need to set some boundaries.  He tells her that she had better not try to put anything over on him.  She smiles and says that she must have a reputation and she loves it.  Craig tells her that there are certain things that he doesn't want his daughter to remember and Alison knows what \"incident\" he is talking about.  Then he makes a reference that Alison doesn't want Lucy to remember something either and he wonders what that could be.  She says that she admits that she has a crush on her best friends boyfriend and she wants them to grow apart.  Alison then has a flashback of when she told Lucy that she was the one who set the fire in the barn.  Alison tells Craig that they need a plan to help Lucy get over Aaron.    Alison tells Craig that she could work on Lucy and convince her that Aaron had done something really bad and she was running to him the day that she got hit by the trolley to have it out with him.  Craig tells her that she could never pull that off.  Alison says, \"You want to bet?\"    \n\n\nEmily gets a call from Carly and Carly tells her friend that Hal had been at her house and he was in detective mode and acting a little strange.  She tells Emily that she and Molly had been talking and Hal came down from upstairs and she thinks he might have heard something.  Emily asks if they were having the \"who's the daddy\" conversation.  Carly tells her yes and if he presses Emily for any information would she please cover for her because he will go straight to Jack.  Hal walks in the door and Emily acts like she is talking to her mother and gets off the phone.  Hal tells Emily that when he dropped Parker off at Carly's, he found out that Carly is having a baby.  Hal adds that she probably already knew that since they are such good friends.  Emily tells him that she did know that and Carly had asked that she not tell anyone and she didn't want to betray her friend's confidence.  Emily can tell that her husband has something else on his mind.  Hal says that he will come right out with it and he asks, \"Is Carly pregnant by Jack or someone else?\"  Emily tries to evade Hal's questions but Hal tells her about hearing about a disparity in the baby's due date and something was said about Rosanna Cabot.  Emily tells him that he probably heard something out of context.  Hal reminds Emily that he has been on the other end of Carly playing baby games and he doesn't like his friend being played for a fool.  Emily still plays dumb so Hal picks up the phone and says that he will call Jack himself.  Emily stops him and then she tells him about the night that Carly had thought that Jack was finished with her and Jack had called off the wedding.  She tells him that Carly had a one-night stand.  Emily asks Hal not to make waves because Carly was pretty sure that the baby is Jack's.  Hal asks whom the one-night stand was with and Emily tells him that it was Craig Montgomery.  Hal thinks for a minute and tells Emily that couldn't be, because Craig was with him chasing the kids across the country.  Emily says that if it isn't Craig, then she doesn't know who it is.  Hal asks if she is lying to cover up for Carly.  Emily tells him to stop treating her like a perp.  She adds that she hates it when he does that.  Hal says ok and then he goes to the phone to call Jack.  Emily tells him that he has to look at it like this, the baby is probably Jack's and it will be born into a family that will love it.  Hal tells Emily that if he finds out that the baby is not Jack's; he will play the bad guy.  He hands the phone to Emily and tells her that she can warn Carly herself.  \n\n\nAt Java Underground, Isaac and Bonnie are talking about the business and Jessica walks in.

Jack comes in with a tee ball stand for Parker to practice on.  Jack asks if Hal brought Parker back and Carly yells upstairs for Parker to come down.  Carly asks Jack if he thinks now is a good time to tell Parker about the baby.  Jack says that he thinks it would be a great time.  When Parker comes into the room, they sit him down and tell him that they have something to talk to him about.  Carly tells him that pretty soon he will have a brand new baby brother or baby sister to share his stuff with.  Carly asks if it will be cool having a baby in the house.

Carly takes Parker over to the couch and sits him down.  Carly tells him that the new baby is in her tummy right now and that is where he came from.  She goes on to say that in a few months the new baby will come out of her tummy and he will have a sister or brother that he can care for and stick up for and look out for.  Then she asks what he thinks about that.  Parker asks, \"Who's the daddy?\"  Carly gets a strange look on her face.  Jack picks Parker up and says, \"Are you busting by chops?\"  Carly says, \"Parker, Jack is the baby's father.\"  Jack asks Parker if he remembers when he married his mommy and Parker says that he does.  Jack goes on to say that when a man and woman get married and they are having a baby, then the husband, that would be me, is the daddy.  Then he adds, \"Or that is the way it is supposed to be.\"  Jack asks Parker if he understands what they are saying and he says, \"Yes, can I go play now?\"  Carly and Jack tell him to please, go play.  After Parker goes upstairs, Jack sits with Carly on the couch.  Jack says, \"I think that went well.\"  Carly starts to laugh hysterically.  Jack asks if he missed the joke and Carly tells him that he should have seen his face when Parker asks who the father is.  Jack says, \"Yeah, that kids a real joker.\"  The phone rings and Carly answers it.  Emily is calling and tells Carly that Hal knows the score, but she talked him down and he isn't going to say anything.  She tells Carly to stay out of Hal's way.  Carly says, \"Oh.  Okay and we will have lunch and go shopping.\"  She says goodbye and hangs up the phone.  Jack is standing behind her and she tells him that he is a good man.  She turns to him and says. \"I think that you are the very best man that I have ever known.\"  He asks, \"Where is this coming from?\"  She says, \"From my heart.\"  She pulls him to her and they hug.\n\n\n",
