He says, \"I am not letting you get an abortion!\"  Alison's new boss intrudes and asks her to get to work.  Aaron salts his foot, then sticks it in his mouth.  He asks Alison how she plans to take care of herself, and he flips when she tells him she's living at the YWCA.  Aaron tells her Chris found out the baby is his, and promises to stand at Alison's side if he tries to take the baby.  Alison turns to run away again, but Aaron grabs her and tells her to get back to Oakdale and fight.  He knows she will have Susan and Emily at her side.  She gives in and asks him to pick her up at the YWCA in a half-hour.  After Aaron leaves, Alison grabs her jacket, quits her job, then runs for the door.  She opens the door, and Chris is standing there.\n\n\nMike hallucinates at Metro.  He thinks one Katie is telling him to get lost, while another Katie is telling him how much she loves him.  He shrugs both of them off and yells, \"Enough!\"  He snaps back to reality when he realizes he's in a public place.\n\n\nMargo encourages Katie to tell Mike about Simon, but Katie can't figure out how.  Simon walks in and tries to help Katie make up her mind, \"I won't let go of you Katie.  Not ever again.\"  Margo gives Simon a hug, but then lays into him for how he treated her sister.  Katie asks her Margo to give them some time alone, and also asks her to keep Mike away from the house so she and Simon can talk without interruption.  Margo reluctantly leaves.  Simon apologizes for what happened, but Katie wants an explanation.  Simon says he'll give her one, but only after they abandon Oakdale.  Katie won't leave, \"Things have changed.\"  Outside, Margo calls Mike.  She plans to meet up with him at Metro; \"There's something you need to know.\"\n\n\nLily brings Luke and Faith to Rose's place, but Luke whines as he wants to go home.  Lily tries to put an old scarf of Rose's around Faith's neck, but she pushes her mother away.  Lily sends the kids out to play in the snow.  Holden arrives and again tries to reach out and comfort his wife.  He asks her what it feels like to lose a sister...a twin.  Lily cries and shares her heart with her husband, but she feels he'll never be able to empathize.  Holden agrees, \"Lily you are somewhere that I just can't follow.  I need you.  The kids need you.  Stay with us.\"  She hugs him, but pulls away when he encourages her to let go of Rose.  She runs out the door and later finds herself at the Roller Palace.  \n\n\nLily rummages around the salon looking for pieces of Rose, until she stops and yells, \"Where are you!?!  Where have you gone without me?!?\"  Later, someone stops by the salon for an appointment.  Lily tells the woman the shop is closed.  On her way out, the woman catches a sudden chill.  Lily asks her if she needs any help.  The woman says, \"No, but you do...if you want to reach your sister.\"  The woman grudgingly professes to be a medium between the living and the dead.  The woman begins to leave when Lily starts to question her motives.  Lily stops the woman and begs her for the message.  The woman relents and says, \"Rose...she...she wants you to be at peace.\"\n\n\nMargo meets Mike at Metro.  He thinks Katie sent her to return the engagement ring.  Margo says Katie is working through a major issue and she needs the night to be alone.  She asks him to stay away from the cottage.  Mike thanks her for the advice, but heads over to Katie's after Margo leaves.\n\n\nThe judge hammers her gavel to bring the court to attention at Barbara's trial.  The judge recaps Barbara's situation, saying she committed \"grave crimes that warrant grave consequences.\"  In what seems to be the shortest trial ever, the judge sentences Babs to ten years in prison.  But, after listening to Barbara's measured rants about how she did everything for her children, the judge sends the courtroom into chaos as she decides to suspend her sentence and give her probation for five years.  Paul jumps up and demands the judge to reconsider, but she tries to have him restrained instead.  \n\n\nLater, outside the courtroom, Paul presses Tom to get the decision reversed.  Tom promises to file a complaint with the state supreme court, but admits the decision will probably remain final.  He advises Paul to pull himself together and stay strong for Will.  Paul returns to the courtroom where Barbara is triumphantly unfurling her peacock feathers in front of Kim and Jen after her surprise victory.  He cuts her down to size and suggests she tryout for the part of Medea in some area production of the ancient play by Euripides.  She turns away from her son and explains to Kim and Jen that Paul doesn't understand because he's not a parent.  Kim doesn't quite understand either, but she encourages everyone to get along.  Paul tells Barbara to stay out of Will's life.  \n\n\nKatie notices Simon is upset.  He says he saw Katie and Mike being intimate and it killed him seeing her with someone else.  Katie apologizes, but doesn't have remorse.  \"If it weren't for Mike I would have died.  You took away my reason to live, and Mike gave it back to me.\"  She tells Simon she's engaged to Mike.  Simon looks like he's been punched in the gut as he says, \"But you're married to me.\"  He asks her if she still loves him, but she can't sort through her feelings yet.  He holds her head, brushes her cheek, then kisses Katie.  For a moment, she holds his head, but as Mike enters the house downstairs, she says, \"Stop it.\"  Mike rushes upstairs.  Simon says he wants to shake Katie up and keep her confused.  They return to a more passionate kiss when Mike reaches the doorway.  He rushes up to Simon and breaks the couple apart.  Mike is shocked to see Simon's face.\n\n\nBabs excuses Jen and Kim, then let's Paul have it, \"I haven't destroyed Will's life, you have!  You have protected him from ever being happy again!  I will never, ever let you forget this!\"  Paul returns the litany, \"Get over yourself!  You are a sick, self-involved, crazy-lady, control freak! And one day Will will realize that.\"  After a slimy retort from Babs, Paul limply professes his hate for his mother.  She whispers back, \"You don't hate me.  You hate yourself.\"  Jen returns as Paul promises to punish his mother for her bad behavior.  Barbara says Paul used to throw similar fits when he was a young boy, saying his Mommy was bad.  Paul twitches at the thought of his childhood as Barbara turns the screw deeper into his psyche.  She sidles up to her son and whispers at his ear, \"And I'll tell you now, what I used to tell you then...\u2018Don't worry darling.  I know deep down inside, you still love me.'\"  Paul fumes and wretches all at once.\n\n\n",

Alison bustles by her boss and heads to the door, explains that she is not having a domestic dispute and promises to meet up with a friend at the YMCA. Barbara hopes that she will be able to help her son now that she is free, knows that whatever her son says, he still loves her and sees that her son really hates himself. Holden can't answer as to whether his wife will ever really return to her family and can't make his wife see that he doesn't want to forget about his sister-in- law. Lily cries out for a sign from her sister, is told that she is the one that needs help and learns that her sister wants her to be at peace. Margo asks Mike not to go charging over to his fiancee's house and goes off on her brother-in-law. Mike finds his fiancee hugging and kissing another man and starts hallucinating about what he should do. Paul assures his mother that she will not be able to get to her son anymore and has an outburst in court. Simon doesn't believe in an engagement, as he is still married, forces his wife to remember him and tells his wife that they have to leave town right now.",
