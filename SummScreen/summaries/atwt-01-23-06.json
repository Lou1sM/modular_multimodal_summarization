They assume that Luke feels pressure about dating due to his parents love story. He probably feels pressured to live up to that.

Both Luke and Holden look uneasy, as Luke tells her he would rather go with just his dad. Kevin later persuades Luke to leave the house and go drinking with him for their own private party.
