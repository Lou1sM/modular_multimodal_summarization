He goes to the kitchen cabinet and retrieves the needle he has hidden. Just then, Lily comes downstairs and as she frantically gets set to leave the house, Holden asks where she is going. She says she's leaving to help Dusty since she is the one who hurt him. Holden reminds Lily that Dusty is dead and she is shocked at first, but then begins to remember the details around the night Dusty died. Meg comes into the kitchen dressed somberly and when Lily asks if she is going to Dusty's funeral. When Meg tells her the service is that morning, Lily insists on attending.

Emily is awakened by a knock at the door and finds her sister, Alison, ready to take her to Dusty's funeral. Alison questions why Emily is not ready to go and Emily tells her that Dusty destroyed her life because she is convinced that he is the one who told Chris that she was a prostitute. Emily says that if Dusty had left her alone then he would still be alive.

Craig arrives and immediately harasses Lucinda. She confronts Craig and tells him that he shouldn't be there since he and Dusty were enemies. She tells Craig that it's tacky for him to attend the funeral and goes as far as to accuse Craig of being responsible for Dusty's murder. Craig denies any involvement, but stops his conversation with Lucinda when he sees Meg enter the church. Craig tries to talk to Meg, but she quickly tells him to leave her alone and says he shouldn't be there. When Barbara comes in, she immediately begins to yell at Craig and he decides to leave. Barbara confides in Gwen that seeing Craig reminders her of everything she has lost-Jennifer, Johnny, and now Dusty. She thanks Gwen for convincing Will to come, and Gwen tells her that she and Will made the decision together. Before the service begins, Gwen checks in with the sitter and learns they are out for a walk in Old Town. She reminds the sitter she will have her phone off during the funeral. \n\n\nAs Lily and Holden arrive at the church, Lily has a flashback to the night of Dusty's death. She tells Holden that she recalls going into the stairwell that night. Holden tells her that she needs to take it easy and that they should go home. Lily believes she must stay and is convinced that if she can remember more about that night, she might be able to figure out who killed Dusty, or maybe she even saw the murder. As they enter the church, they run into Susan and Alison. Susan recalls seeing Holden at the hospital acting suspicious the night Dusty died. \n\n\nAs the service for Dusty begins, the preacher asks if anyone would like to say a few words about Dusty. Alison is the first to go up and she beings to speak. She stops as her sister, Emily, enters the church. She looks relieved to see that Emily has decided to come to the funeral, and she then begins to relate her memories of how Dusty saved her life. Will is next to speak and recalls Dusty's life with his sister, Jennifer, and her son, Johnny. Talk of Johnny sends Meg from the church as she recalls the recent loss of her own child. When Lily gets up to talk, Holden stops her and Lucinda decides to speak in her place. Lucinda remembers Dusty's loyalty and demands that someone pay for his death. The preacher ends the service and as everyone files out, Emily meets up with her mother and sister.  She tells them she will meet them later, but she wants a few minutes alone in the church first. Emily talks aloud to Dusty and says, \"It shouldn't have ended this way.\" Lily hears her and tells her that it's Emily's fault that Dusty is dead. Lily rips into Emily and blames her for Dusty making so many enemies. When she tells Emily that Dusty deserved better than a hooker, Emily realizes that Lily sent the anonymous note to Chris, not Dusty. Emily starts to cry as she looks at a photo of Dusty and questions what she has done. Susan returns looking for Emily and asks her what is wrong. Emily tells her mom that she is responsible for Dusty's death and becomes distraught. Susan tells her daughter to stay put and leaves the church to talk to Margo. \n\n\nMargo has returned to the station after the funeral and tells Dallas that she really didn't learn anything by going. She asks if Dallas found anything out about the number Dusty was calling. He tells her that it is the number of Neil Perkins, a lab tech that had done work for Dusty in the past. Margo thinks Neil might have the evidence Dusty was waiting for that night and tells Dallas to bring him in for questioning. \n\n\nIn an attempt to get police attention off of Emily, Susan goes to the station and tells Margo that she saw Holden at the hospital in front of an unattended drug cart the night Dusty died. She explains that she didn't see him holding anything, but he was acting very suspicious. Margo wants to know for sure if he was in possession of any drugs, but Susan says she didn't see him with anything. Margo thanks Susan and tells Dallas they need to get a search warrant for the Snyder farm. Susan returns to the church to find Emily apologizing to Dusty's pictures. In the meantime, Margo and Dallas have arrived at the farm and when no one is home they enter and begin their search. At first they find nothing, but Margo decides to check the kitchen cabinet. \n\n\nAfter her clash with Emily, Lily and Holden go to Al's Diner to unwind before heading home. Holden tells Lily she is welcome to stay at the farm as long as she likes, and she questions why he is being so kind to her. Holden explains that by driving her into Dusty's arms, he feels responsible for everything that has happened. Lily maintains that Holden is her hero and has done nothing wrong. Lily asks one more time if Holden is okay with her staying at the farm and he insists she is always welcome there. The two head home and arrive to find Dallas and Margo, who present them with the syringe they found in the cabinet. Holden tells them he was the one who put it there and Margo tells him he has to come with them to the station for questioning in Dusty's death. \n\n\nGwen and Will's babysitter has taken baby Hallie out for a walk. Sofie sees her with Hallie and runs to see the baby girl she gave up for adoption. The babysitter is apprehensive of Sofie's nearness to the child and the questions about her ability as a caregiver for the newborn. The sitter asks why it is any of her business and Sofie tells her that she is a close friend of Will and Gwen's. Alison overhears their conversation and asks Sofie if Will and Gwen are okay with her seeing the baby. Sofie insists she is allowed to see Hallie and defends her right to see her daughter because of the open adoption. Alison is mistrustful of Sofie, but leaves her with Hallie and the sitter and heads to Al's to meet her mom. The sitter tells Sofie she has to get the baby home for a nap and Sofie asks if she can walk home with the two. When they arrive home, Gwen is shocked to see Sofie walking with Hallie and the sitter. Will and Gwen asks Sofie to give them some family time alone. After she leaves, Will tells Gwen it is time to set limits about Sofie's contact with the baby. \n\n\nMeg sits in Old Town and sadly watches the babies being carried through town. As tears begin to form in her eyes, Craig approaches and hands her a handkerchief. She refuses it and begins to storm off, but returns when Craig tells her they need to decide what to do with Montgomery Enterprises. She tells him she doesn't care what happens to the company, but Craig argues he does and wants control. He demands that Meg let him finish his work and she relents under the one condition-that he never contact her again. Craig agrees and when he tries to shake Meg's hand, she storms off. \n\n\nCraig goes to the Lakeview for a celebratory drink and finds Lucinda. She immediately lashes out at him for celebrating on the day of Dusty's funeral. Craig tells her that he isn't rejoicing in Dusty's death, but in retaining Montgomery Enterprises. Lucinda reminds Craig that the company was once hers and says she will get it back. \n\n\n",
