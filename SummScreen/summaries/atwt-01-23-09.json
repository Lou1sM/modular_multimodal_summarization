Craig showed up and unexpectedly asked Sage if she was excited about being the maid of honor in his wedding to Carly. Sage was stunned to hear that her mom planned to marry Craig, and she complained loudly about it. Jack left with Sage, after telling Carly he would try to calm Sage down. Carly was angry with Craig for telling everyone about their engagement without consulting her first. Craig tried to take Carly's mind off of that by showing her the large engagement ring he had bought for her, but Carly refused to put it on. \n\n\nCarly told Craig the ring was too big, but Craig managed to convince her to try it on. As Carly admired the ring, Craig told her that the custody hearing had been scheduled, so their wedding needed to take place in the next couple of days. Carly reminded Craig that he had said she had at least two weeks before the wedding, but Craig said that the stepped-up schedule couldn't be helped. Carly reluctantly said they could go to the courthouse to get married as soon as they had their wedding license. Craig nixed that idea, saying Dusty would use a rushed courthouse wedding as a sign that Carly and Craig's marriage was a sham. Craig felt they needed to get married \"with conviction.\" When Carly protested that she was not going to have a church wedding to Craig, he agreed, saying, \"If I'm not struck down by lightning, then you probably would be.\" He suggested they get married at Carly's house. \n\n\nCarly didn't like the idea, but Craig said it might help the children get used to the idea that he would be living there. Carly hadn't thought that far ahead; she told Craig her house was small, and she asked where he would be sleeping. He said he intended to sleep with her, of course, but Carly protested that although she'd agreed to marry him, she had never said she would sleep with him. \n\n\nJack took Sage to Al's Diner, where Sage tried to convince him to stop her mother's wedding. Sage wanted Jack to agree with her that Craig was a bad man, but Jack said he wasn't going to \"talk trash\" about Craig. Sage said it wasn't trash if it was true, and she pointed out that everyone said Craig had caused her Aunt Rosanna's car accident and had lied to her Aunt Gwen about her baby. Jack agreed, but said his hands were tied. Sage asserted that she would do something herself if her dad couldn't stop the wedding. \n\n\nJack dropped Sage off at Carly's, where Sage ignored her mother and Craig, and went straight to her room. Craig offered to talk to her Sage or buy her a ring or whatever else it might take to bring Sage around, but Carly told him to leave. Craig went to the diner, where he found Jack. Craig told Jack that he and Carly were moving ahead with their wedding, and he promised to be a good husband to Carly and a good step-father to Jack's children. When Craig said he knew Jack objected to the marriage, Jack said he didn't object. Jack said he had no right to tell Carly what to do anymore, and that Carly always did what she wanted to do anyway. \n\n\nAt home, Sage came downstairs with a suitcase and informed her mother that she was going to go live with her dad and Janet, because Craig Montgomery was a bad man. Carly reminded Sage that she Sage had had felt that way about Janet at first, but Sage said that was different, because her father loved Janet. She asked if her mother loved Craig, and Carly responded that her upcoming marriage wasn't about love. Carly tried to explain that sometimes, there were special circumstances. \n\n\nBefore Carly could explain further, a car honked its horn, and Sage announced that it was her cab. Sage said she had called a cab because she had assumed Carly wouldn't want her to leave, and Sage didn't want Jack to have to come and get her and potentially fight with Carly about it. Carly told Sage she was too young to ride in a cab by herself, that it wasn't safe; Sage asked if her mom thought it was safe for her to live there with Craig, and Carly said absolutely, or she wouldn't have agreed to marry Craig. Carly went to pay the cab driver and called Jack to discuss the situation more thoroughly with Sage. \n\n\nJack arrived, but he was prepared to take Sage home with him. Jack said he wasn't going to force Sage to stay at Carly's if Sage was uncomfortable with Craig. Carly asked if Jack had prompted Sage to mention Rosanna's accident, but Jack said he had not; he reminded Carly of how upset she had been when Rosanna had been hurt, and how Carly had blamed Craig. Carly told Jack that people could change, but Jack said they didn't change that much. Carly pointed out that Jack used to love her, and obviously, he had changed. Jack said he was done making concessions, and he went upstairs to help Sage finish packing. \n\n\nCraig returned to Carly's with the marriage license. Carly told him it was a bad time. Craig assumed Carly was worried about Sage, so he told her he had spoken to Jack to try to smooth the waters. He was surprised when Jack came downstairs with Sage. Carly asked Sage if she was sure she wanted to leave, and Sage nodded. Sage told her mom she loved her, and then she left. \n\n\nCarly told Craig that Sage had left home because she couldn't stand him. Carly said that she would not lose her daughter while trying to help Craig keep his son. Craig tried to convince Carly that Sage's rebellion had been directed by Jack, in an effort to control Carly. Carly insisted Jack would never manipulate his children that way, but Craig pointed out that all Jack would have to do was to sit there looking upset and wait for his loving child to ask what was wrong and what she could do to help. Carly said even if that were true, Jack had won, because if Carly had to make a choice between Sage and Craig, then Craig would lose. Craig told Carly that if she gave in, then Jack would win yet again. \n\n\nWhen Carly asked what Craig's plan was, Craig said Carly should do nothing, and when she didn't overreact, Jack's plan would fall apart. He assured Carly that Sage would change her mind once she saw that her plan hadn't worked, and everything would be okay. \n\n\nJack took Sage to the diner and let her have ice cream for dinner. Sage asked her dad, \"Do you think it worked?\" Jack said only time would tell, but he thought they had Carly right where they wanted her. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview restaurant, Dusty tried to convince Meg that marrying him would solve both of their problems, by giving him a family unit to help him in his custody battle and by showing Paul that Meg and Eliza were part of someone else's family. Meg said she couldn't take part in such a scheme, but Dusty said it was no more of a scheme than when Meg and Paul conspired to keep Johnny away from him and Jennifer. Meg told Dusty how ashamed she was of that, but she didn't appreciate Dusty trying to guilt her into marrying him. Dusty said that wasn't what he was doing, and he begged her to help him and Johnny. \n\n\nDusty assured Meg he could support and protect her and Eliza if she would agree to marry him. Meg asked why Dusty didn't ask Josie to marry him, since she could tell they had feelings for one another. Dusty said he didn't trust Josie, and that Josie didn't understand how dangerous Paul and Craig could be. Dusty reminded Meg of what she'd lost because of Paul and Craig. He assured her that after the custody situation with Johnny was settled, they could have the marriage annulled. Meg agreed to at least think about Dusty's proposition. \n\n\nJosie walked in and saw Meg hugging Dusty. After Meg left, Josie showed Dusty some toys she had bought for Johnny. Dusty warned Josie not to get too invested in her relationship with Johnny, and then he sat her down and explained to her about his proposal to Meg. Josie was hurt and wondered why Dusty had turned to Meg, when Josie and Dusty were trying to build a relationship together. Dusty said he had to put his son first. \n\n\nBarbara went to Fairwinds to visit Paul, who told her about his visit with Meg and Eliza. After he told Barbara about Meg's reaction to his kiss, Paul asked her to go talk to Meg and apologize for him. Barbara told Paul he would have to be patient with Meg, and he replied that it would be easier to be patient if he had something to hope for. \n\n\nBarbara went to the farm to talk to Meg. Barbara said Paul had told her about Meg's visit to Fairwinds with Eliza, and that Paul felt he and Meg had bonded over the baby. Meg said that although she still loved Paul, she couldn't be with him. She asked Barbara to try to get Paul to understand that their marriage was truly over. Barbara felt that instead, Meg should talk to Paul herself. When Meg was reluctant, Barbara asked if she was afraid that Paul would convince her to give their marriage another try. Meg said she was afraid, because she didn't believe Paul had recovered completely yet. She thought Paul had that look of wanting to do anything to keep Meg with him. Barbara explained to Meg that Paul had told her that he had pushed things with Meg earlier, and he was sorry. Barbara knew Meg was frightened, but when she asked what else Meg felt, Meg said she felt love for Paul. Barbara told her perhaps it was just a matter of time before Paul would earn Meg's trust back, and she asked Meg to think about that. \n\n\nJosie went to Fairwinds and informed Paul of Dusty's proposal to Meg. Paul was taken aback, but he insisted Meg would never accept such a proposal, because he believed he and Meg were going to reconcile. Josie said Dusty seemed convinced that Meg would agree to marry him. Paul became irate and told Josie he was going to go tell Dusty to stay away from his wife. Josie reminded Paul that Meg was no longer his wife, and she said that if Paul got into a fight with Dusty, Meg might run into Dusty's arms. Paul said Meg loved him, and Josie told Paul to work with that and get it right, or he would lose Meg. \n\n\nBarbara returned to Fairwinds and found Josie instead of Paul. Josie told Barbara that Paul had gone to see Meg, and she told Barbara about Dusty's proposal. When Paul arrived at the farm, Meg was surprised to see him, because Barbara had only just left. Paul said he had wanted to apologize in person for having misread things with Meg earlier. Meg said maybe Paul hadn't misread her signals, and Paul asked if Meg still had feelings for him. She admitted she did. \n\n\nPaul wondered where they went from there, and he suggested that Meg move into Fairwinds but stay in her own wing of the house, with her own staff, so that they could share their love for Eliza. Meg said that sounded wonderful, but it would never work, because they were bound to have a weak moment, and then the complications would begin again. Paul appeared to accept that, but then he asked why Meg felt she could have that type of arrangement with Dusty. Meg was surprised that Paul knew about Dusty's suggestion. When she saw how upset Paul was becoming, she told him to leave. Paul wanted to see Eliza first, but Meg said no. Meg said she thought Paul had meant it when he talked about trying to be a family and being patient with her, but apparently, all he wanted was for her to not be with Dusty. Paul shouted that Meg didn't belong with Dusty, ; she belonged with him. Paul insisted that Meg loved him, and Meg agreed, but she said Paul was proving yet again why she couldn't be with him. Obviously rattled, Meg again told Paul to leave. \n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds, where Barbara was waiting for him. He told his mother how badly things had gone at the farm, but he also said how close he'd come to getting things right. Paul was convinced more than ever that he would reconcile with Meg. Meanwhile, Meg went to the Lakeview and went up to Dusty's room. She walked in and told Dusty, \"If you still want to do this, I'll marry you.\" \n\n\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Jack picks Sage up so they can work on a school project. Carly thanks him for understanding and wants Sage back early so she can break the news to her about her marrying Craig. Craig shows up though and spoils the surprise. Meg tells Dusty she divorced Eliza's father and she will not make the same mistake with him. Dragging her into Johnny's life is wrong. He needs more permanence, not a merger. He begs her and she says she will think about it. Craig bestows a huge engagement ring on Carly and insists they not just go to city hall but do this right and it must done within a few days. Sage is bummed by this and asks her dad if there isn't something he can do. He feels his hands are tied. Barbara commiserates with Paul over Meg. Although she does not feel she can help matters by talking to her, she agrees to try. Dusty busts Josie's bubble by telling her that he proposed to Meg and he thinks she will accept. The court date has been set and he needs to offer something better than Craig can. Craig tells Carly too that whatever they do, they have to do it with conviction otherwise Dusty will call him on it. She declares she will marry him, she never said she would sleep with him or share her home. Paul snaps at Josie that Meg will never be Dusty's wife, she belongs to him. He storms out to talk to Dusty. Craig tracks down Jack and shares with him that he will be a good husband to Carly and a good father to his children. Jack has a laissez faire attitude and says that is up to Carly, not him. Sage drags her suitcase down and declares that if Carly marries Craig, she is going to move in with Janet and her dad. Carly reminds her that she felt this same way at one time about Janet. In time she will come to like Craig more. She pays for the taxi and convinces Sage to stay for now. She tells Jack that people like Craig can change. She begs Jack not to take Sage, give her a few months to get over this. Craig returns and is one step closer to the walking down the aisle. She tells him that she is only doing this so he can keep his son, but she is not going to lose her daughter in the process. She can not do this. He convinces Carly that this is not Sage's doing, but Jack still trying to control her. He knows exactly how to stick it to her. Jack is expecting this outcome, so just bluff him. Sage will come around and want her own room rather than sharing a farmhouse with 50 other people and dozens of animals. Trust him, all of this is going to work out just fine. Barbara is surprised when Josie tells her that Paul is gone, and Meg is going to marry Dusty. Paul shows up at Meg's. She agrees she still has feelings and is attracted to him, but she can not be married to him. He asks her to move back into Fairwinds, she can have her own wing. They can be together and be with their daughter. Frantically, Meg shows up at Dusty's and says if he still wants to get married, she will marry him.",
