Since Marshall is recuperating, she is going to go check it out on his behalf.  Jessica leaves to visit Marshall at the hospital.\n\n\nMarshall tries to sneak himself out of the hospital, but is caught when John and Bob stop by for rounds.  Just as he tells the doctors that he doesn't want to let Jessica help in the search, she walks in his room and asks, \"Why not?\"  John and Bob wash their hands of the situation, and leave Marshall alone with Jessica.  After a small heart-to-heart, Marshall decides to cut Jessica loose so she can be with Ben.\n\n\nCarly comes downstairs with all her travel bags ready to go on her honeymoon.  Carly says she moved up her appointment with Dr. Schiller.  Molly intrudes and tried to go with her, but Carly pushes her away and says she will go on her own.  Molly doesn't know what to think about Carly's sudden rage.  Carly recovers, and settles on asking her to help out by watching Parker.  Molly buys it and stays behind.  Jack heads for the station to tie up some loose ends, leaving Mike and Molly to house-sit.  Mike mentions how proud Jack sounds about having a baby, and Molly begins to suspect that Mike may be the real father of Carly's child.\n\n\nEmily and Hal talk about Will returning to school full time.  Hal can't tell if his son is telling the truth any longer.  Emily says she's going to help Carly through her pregnancy.  Hal encourages Emily to tell Carly to get a paternity test.  He thinks Carly owes that to Jack, but Emily tells him to mind his own business.  Hal says he needs to tell Jack what's happened, but Emily pleads with him to wait until after he goes on his honeymoon.  After Hal leaves, Carly slips in to get advice from Emily.  Emily tells her that Hal knows everything except that Mike is the true father of the baby.  Carly feels like her world is crumbling around her.  Emily tells her to just focus on the next few days.  Her world can come tumbling down around her AFTER the honeymoon.\n\n\nCraig shuffles Rosanna out of his Lakeview suite so he can make engagement plans.  Rosanna asks if she can come back after her appointment with Dr. Schiller, and Craig consents.  They kiss good-bye.  Katie comes out of Lucy's room, and then there is a knock at the front door.  A jeweler arrives with an assortment of wedding rings for Craig to choose from.  Katie briefly tries to talk Craig out of marriage, but he won't hear it.  Katie directs Craig to a great engagement ring choice, and then Craig tells the jeweler he'll come by later to complete the sale.  On his way out the jeweler compliments Craig for being such a great customer.  Katie hints that she knows about Carly's situation, but doesn't press the issue.\n\n\nRosanna gets the good news from Dr. Schiller that she won't have to schedule a follow-up appointment for another six weeks.  Rosanna brings up Carly, and the doctor lets it slip that Carly will need to come in more often, now that she's starting her second trimester.  This news hits Rosanna like a brick.  Is it possible that Craig is the father?\n\n\nRosanna rushes home to confront Craig.  Katie sees that she's no longer needed, and leaves the two alone.  Rosanna accuses him of being the father of Carly's baby, but Craig comes clean with the truth.  \"I didn't sleep with Carly that night.\"  Rosanna starts off on a very logical tirade, based on the lies she's been fed over the past few weeks and months, then tries to leave Craig in the dust.  Craig blocks her from getting to the door, then he takes the phone out of her hands as she tries to call security.  He sternly says, \"You are not going to leave until you hear what I have to say.  Carly was desperate, and needed to be rescued.\"  Rosanna asks him if he knows who slept with Carly.  Craig says it was Mike.  Rosanna soaks it all in, and tearfully says, \"You know I can't imagine anyone feeling like a bigger fool at the moment than I do.\"  She turns and walks toward the door.  Craig drops his hands at his side and says, \"You know, I do...I do love you.\"  Rosanna opens the door, turns around, and says, \"Yeah...you just don't know how.\"  She gently closes the door and walks out of his life.\n\n\nOutside Craig's suite, Rosanna calls Mike on his cell phone and demands to meet him at Java ASAP.  Molly hears that Mike is talking with Rosanna and takes the phone away from him.  Molly tells Rosanna that she won't need to buy back her old apartment after all because she and Mike \"are really very happy at the lake.\"  Rosanna tearfully dismisses her enthusiasm by saying, \"Well, I'm just thrilled for you...would you please put Mike back on?\"  Mike gets back on the phone and Rosanna grits her teeth and says, \"Meet me at Java, or there will be no mercy for you!\"  She successfully pulls Mike's strings, and hangs up the phone. \n\n\nJack is confirming his travel arrangements at the station, when Hal walks in.  Jack is happy to pass along all his open case files to Hal to handle while he is away.  Hal measures Jack's attitude and somberly says, \"I need to talk to you about something.  It's about Carly and the baby.\"  Jack spews the story of his recent bit of good news, and Hal decides to not break his heart at that moment.\n\n\nCarly and Emily arrive at Dr. Schiller's office.  The doctor is surprised to hear about Carly's travel plans.  Carly realizes that Rosanna spoke with Dr. Schiller in the morning and worries about what was said between the two.  Her suspicions are quickly confirmed when the doctor tells Carly that she told Rosanna about Carly being in her second trimester.  The doctor walks away, and the news starts to sink in.  Emily tries to comfort Carly, but Carly thinks it may be too late unless she can \"stop my sister from destroying my life!\"\n\n\nCraig calls Carly's house, and Molly answers the phone.  He doesn't wait to confirm that it is Carly he's speaking with and says, \"Carly, we have a problem.  Rosanna knows everything.\"\n\n\nMike meets a rigid, frigid, and jilted Rosanna at the Java Caf\u00e9.  He says, \"What's this all about?\"  She sizes him up as he takes a seat and says, \"You got Carly pregnant again.\"  Mike can't believe, or doesn't want to believe, what he's hearing.  He admits that he slept with her, but \"that doesn't mean the baby's mine.\"  \"It does if she's three months pregnant.  I spoke to her doctor.\"  Mike's jaw drops as he absorbs the truth.  \n\n\nRosanna fixes her eyes on Mike, grits her teeth, and spits, \"So, why aren't you smiling?  You're going to be a daddy.\"\n\n\n",
