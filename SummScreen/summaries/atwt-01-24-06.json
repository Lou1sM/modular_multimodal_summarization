But just when it looks like he can't take any more, he gets a call from Hal asking him to clock in on the Paul Ryan case. Meanwhile, Paul's hoping the police will assume by what he left behind that he killed himself. Paul sends Meg off to see if the cops are buying the story. To her dismay, she discovers that while Nick believes it, Jack insists that with a guy like Paul Ryan, things aren't always as they appear. But, Hal seems to agree with Nick's theory of suicide and when Jack questions whether this has more to do with Emily then with finding Paul, a defensive Hal blows up at Jack, giving the body search one more night before ordering the case closed. At the Lakeview, Lisa, like Kim, is only willing to put either Gwen or Will up in her hotel. Gwen surprises Will by taking her up on her offer on the condition that Lisa throw a job into the offer. Lisa initially hesitates hiring an underage teenager, but eventually agrees. Later, despite Gwen's conviction this is what's best for both she and Will, they realize it's time to say good night and it's clear neither one is looking forward to the night alone. Margo finds Casey in bed asleep and assumes he made curfew. What she doesn't know is the clump under the sheets is Maddie, who's covering for Casey. When Casey finally does get home, it looks like Maddie might give him away for being an ungrateful lout. But, he redeems himself and thanks her for getting his back, suggesting, without any protest from Maddie, she stay in his room until they know his parents are really asleep.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Jack doesn't want to just accept the theory that Paul committed suicide despite Nick's conviction, but manages to anger Hal when he suggests that Hal is biased because his concern is more for Emily than Paul. Gwen surprises Will when she accepts Lisa's offer to stay at the Lakeview alone and asks her for a job, but she convinces him that it's best. Maddie covers for Casey when he's out after curfew by sleeping in his bed so that Margo doesn't know he's gone, and when he comes back, he suggests she stay there.\r\nSource: tv.com",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gwen and Will reluctantly separate in order to have a place to stay. Gwen then pleads for Lisa to give her a job, which Lisa does. Maddie pretends to be Casey under his comforter when Margo comes into Casey's room to see if he is home from his party by curfew. Margo happily talks to Maddie, thinking he is Casey, telling him she is thrilled he is following the rules. Casey almost gets caught coming in through the window. Maddie lets him in, and then Casey suggests she stay longer under the pretense that she shouldn't leave until his parents go to sleep. Jack and Carly have a fight about why she didn't tell him that Nick was the one who helped her when she fell. Carly alleviates his fears by assuring Jack he is the only one for her. Later, when Hal calls Jack in to give him his input on the Paul Ryan case, Carly is convinced that is a good sign. Paul convinces Meg to go eavesdrop to find out what the police think. Nick finds the evidence Paul and Meg planted, and is convinced the bloody shirt, gun and car in the river proves Paul committed suicide. Jack is not so sure; he thinks it is too easy, and without a body they should assume Paul is alive, but Hal wants the case closed, which causes Jack and Hal to butt heads. Jack wonders if Hal wants the case closed and Paul dead so he can have another shot at Emily, which infuriates Hal. Hal tells Nick he has until tomorrow and then the case is closed. A frustrated Jack leaves with Carly hot on his heels. Meg reports back to Paul what she has heard and Paul can only hope Nick has more pull with Hal then Jack, and based on their argument, he might get his wish.",
