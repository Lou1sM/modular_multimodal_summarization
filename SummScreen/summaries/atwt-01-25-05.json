They clearly enjoy each other's' company and struggle to follow Ben's advice that they not have sex until he is recovered.  Ali has a brainstorm and calls Nancy Hughes to \"chaperone.\"  Nancy comes right over with a plate of homemade cookies and some old fashioned advice.  She is worried that Alison doesn't want to be alone with Aaron, but when Ali explains that it is because they are so much in love, Nancy understands clearly.  She tells Ali that this is a time for them to get to know each other, to dream together, and that their love will grow.  Later, when Aaron is ready for bed he finds that Ali has separated their bed with a sheet, as she's probably seen on old movies.  He laughs at her strategy, but it works!\n\n\nWill shows up at the Lakeview, believing he was there to meet his sister.  He is not happy when he sees Barbara and she tells him she had to lie to him because she knew he wouldn't come to see her willingly.  Barbara tries very hard to convince him that he must come live with her and Hal (she claims that Hal doesn't love Emily any more).  Will doesn't buy it -- but he does believe Barbara when she tells him that Paul in working with Emily to try to prove her innocence.  Will later finds Paul and Rosanna and accuses them of trying to betray him.\n\n\nSusan and Emily try to enjoy an evening out, but talk turns, of course, to Emily's arrest.  Susan doesn't trust Paul and is afraid Paul is trying to use Emily to get back at his mother, whom he hates.  Emily doesn't agree with her about Paul, but she asks her mother some questions about what kind of drug could've been used to make her terrorize Rosanna.  Susan suggests perhaps a psychiatric, hypnotic drug.....and Emily goes looking for it in Barbara's Lakeview Suite.  However, instead of finding a drug, she finds Barbara.  An argument ensues.\n\n\nJack is still angry at Carly because JJ overheard her rant about Julia.  And he is also incredulous when Carly tries to tell him that Julia is now after Holden, and that she wanted JJ to stay the night with them so she could have Holden to herself.  Jack insists that Luke didn't understand what he saw between Holden and Julia and that Holden loves his family, and would not let Julia tear them apart.  Jack is well meaning, but wrong, as Lily has walked in on Holden and Julia in his bed at the Snyder farm.  Lily is angry and hurt but Holden doesn't seem to be particularly sorry that she saw them.  He is concerned, however, when Lily tells him that Luke saw Holden and Julia kiss at the cabin.  Adding insult to injury, Julia can't keep her mouth closed: \"If it makes you feel better to blame me, then go ahead,\" she says carelessly and leaves the room.  Holden can't tell Lily that he loves Julia, but he does admit they slept together.  \"How can you be unfaithful to me again?\"  But Holden doesn't see it as infidelity as he feels the marriage was over a long time ago.  He had better not put too much faith in Julia, however, because as soon as she dressed she drove right out to Jack and Carly's home. Although she claims to have come to pick up JJ so they could both spend the night at the Lakeview, she must know that JJ is asleep by now.  Getting to the real purpose of her visit, she goes on to tell Jack and Carly that she left the farm because Lily caught her and Holden in an awkward situation.  Jack is shocked!  But \n\n\nCarly is not.  \"You and Holden have an intimate moment and you come to tell Jack?\" she says.  Julia insists what happened between her and Holden is their business, but she does admit that she wanted to tell her side of the story to Jack before Lily told Carly.  When Julia leaves, Jack still can't believe it is happening.  \"I can't believe he'd do this to me!\" he says.  Carly reels at the words, but Jack denies that he is jealous.  Carly tells Jack that the only reason Julia came to their house was to make him jealous and \"she succeeded in spades!\"\n\n\nJulia runs to the Lakeview to get a room for the night.  She sees Lisa and is crazy enough to tell her that she and Holden are seeing each other.  Lisa is shocked and stammers \"I used to care about you!\" Julia insists that Lily and Holden's marriage is over: \"We're together now,\" she says, reminiscent of the comments she made to Carly before Jack regained his memory.  Also in characteristic form, Julia breaks into tears.  She is relieved when she hears Holden's voice over her shoulder.  She cries some more as they embrace and he tells her: \"I told Lily our marriage is over.\"\n\n\nAnd indeed he must have, for Lily is still in Holden's room at the Snyder farm, collapsed in a heap of tears.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Lily's rattled but goes to see Carly, who is dealing with the unexpected arrival of Jack and JJ. Jack thinks it's important that JJ be there, thinking that it might help the families merge in the long run. Carly says she'll do her best to get along with the boy for Jack's sake.",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Lily catches Holden and Julia together, Julia leaves and runs to Jack's house saying she's come to pick up JJ and take him to the Lakeview with her. She also proves that Carly has been right to Jack by admitting that she and Holden were caught in a compromising position. At the Lakeview Julia is shocked when Lisa won't condone her and Holden's relationship but her grief soon turns to comfort when Holden advises her that he told Lily that he wants a divorce. Lily is devastated and mourns her marriage. Jack is mystified at the revelation Julia made but adamant about keeping his relationship with JJ. Carly is also determined to make sure that Julia can't fool around in their lives anymore. Barbara tells Will that Paul is supporting Emily and isn't the brother Will believes him to be, encouraging him to move back to Hal's. Will tells her to take a hike but confronts Paul \u0096 he then storms off when Paul admits that he believes Barbara is behind Emily's behavior. Emily confides in Susan about everything, receiving not only a scolding for being involved with Paul but also information about the type of drug that Barbara used to hypnotize her. Alison enlists Nancy's help to keep her and Aaron from making love by agreeing to baking lessons. Nancy also advises her that waiting is a virtue and that she and Aaron can grow much closer by abstaining, giving them a great foundation for a beautiful relationship.",
