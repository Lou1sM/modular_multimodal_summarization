She told him no and that Craig was not responsible for his kidnapping.  \n\n\nCasey's phone rang. He went outside to talk. It was Elwood. Elwood's parents were demanding to be paid immediately or they would call Tom and Margo. Casey told him he had the money. He slipped away to Java to meet Elwood. Katie then arrived at Margo's.

Craig then came in and was made to get on the floor too. Meg questioned the man about his wife and tried to placate him. The gunman then found Barbara hiding, trying to make a phone call. He thrust the gun to her head and dragged her out. Meg realized the man's wife was the lady who died with her there. The man realized Meg knew something. He forced her into a room and let everyone else go. Meg told him she was there and what happened. The gunman said she knew whose fault it was and explained all the allergies his wife had. Meg then remembered the lady giving a litany of her allergies and her mind wandering. Craig sneaked into the room. The gunman figured it was Meg's fault and said she killed his wife and he was going to kill her. Craig tackled him right before he shot Meg. The two struggled on the floor. \n\n\n",
