    "soap_central": "\n\nCarly goes to the farm to find out if Parker stole Sam's dummy, Cowboy Jack. Parker doesn't tell his parents that he found Cowboy Jack in his bed when he got home, and he denies having taken the dummy. He lies about having gone to the dance, and Jack and Carly believe him. Carly apologizes for having given Parker the third degree, and he goes up to bed. Carly leaves and returns to Metro, where she tells Sam that Parker says he hasn't seen Cowboy Jack. Sam apologizes again for having gotten off on the wrong foot with Parker, and Carly tells him she wishes he could see the real Parker. She describes him as \"sensitive and insightful\" and tells Sam that Parker sees things that other people don't see. Carly becomes depressed that Parker has been having so much trouble lately and blames herself for it, while Sam tries to assure Carly that she's doing the best she can. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Parker tries to sneak out to bury Cowboy Jack, but Jack catches him. Parker swears he didn't have anything to do with Cowboy Jack's appearance at the Snyder farm and says Sam is trying to frame him, because Sam is out to get him. While Parker and Jack are talking, Parker's hockey coach stops by and tells Jack he just wanted to be sure Parker was doing okay, since he didn't come to the school dance like the rest of the hockey team. Jack assures the coach that Parker is okay and thanks him for stopping by. An angry Jack tells Parker he'd better start telling him the truth now about what happened. Parker tells Jack that he followed Carly to Yo's and watched her with Sam, who he says was \"all over her.\" He tells Jack that Sam saw him at Yo's and told him there was nothing he could do to stop him from getting together with Carly. Jack asks if that's why Parker took the dummy, and Parker says yes, but he tells Jack that he trashed Cowboy Jack and doesn't know how the dummy got into the farmhouse. Jack tells Parker he understands that Parker doesn't like his mom hanging out with other guys, but Parker says it's not other guys he objects to, just this specific one. He tells Jack he thinks Sam is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and that Carly is going to regret it if she keeps hanging around with him. Jack tells Parker that at this point, Carly probably trusts Sam more than she trusts Parker, and he says he doesn't know what to do about that. \n\n\nJack calls Carly and tells her that Parker had Cowboy Jack after all. He asks her if she can come retrieve the dummy, and she says yes. Carly tells Sam, and he tells her he'll go with her to get Cowboy Jack, because he can see how upset she is. They arrive at the farm, and Jack makes Parker apologize to Sam for taking the dummy. Parker leaves the room, and Sam goes out to wait on the porch with Cowboy Jack so Carly and Jack can talk about what to do about Parker's behavior. Parker finds Sam on the porch and tells him he thinks Sam put the dummy in his bed to make it look like Parker was a liar. Sam says Parker is a liar and that he had nothing to do with Parker skipping the school dance. Sam warns Parker not to mess with him, saying bad things happen when he does. Parker walks back into the house and tells Carly and Jack that Sam is out to get him. Jack tells Parker he and Carly have decided to put Parker back in therapy. Parker goes upstairs, and Jack and Carly share a close moment while Sam watches through the window. \n\n\nLily meets Lucinda at Old Town and tells her about Holden being taken to the police station for questioning. Luke and Noah walk by, and Luke sees his mother and grandmother. He goes over to find out what they're doing, since Lily just got home from the hospital. They don't answer directly until Luke insists that he doesn't deserve to be treated like a child. Lily tells him about Holden, and both Luke and Noah are shocked that anyone would think Holden could murder someone. Lucinda tells the boys that she and Lily will go to the police station and straighten this out. Luke wants to go with them, but they tell him they can handle it and ask him to go home with Noah. Luke is worried, though, and Noah says he should go to the police station himself if he's that upset about it. \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo tries to get Holden to talk about how he came to have a syringe at his house, but Holden refuses. Lily and Lucinda arrive and try to get Dallas to let them see Holden or talk to Margo, but Dallas tells them they'll have to wait. Margo comes out, and Lucinda threatens to sue the police department if they don't let Holden go home right now. Margo threatens to throw Lucinda in jail if she keeps talking like that. Lily pleads with Margo to let her see Holden, and Margo agrees, saying maybe Lily can get through to him. However, Lily is unable to convince Holden that he needs a lawyer, and Holden asks Margo to make sure Lily gets back home okay. Lucinda leaves with Lily and takes her to Al's Diner, where Lily remembers Holden telling her in the hospital that he would \"take care of everything.\" Lucinda insists Holden would never kill anyone. Back at the police station, the forensics report is given to Margo, who tells Holden that the syringe he had at the farm had traces of the same substance that was injected into Dusty. When Holden continues to refuse to answer any questions about how he came to have the syringe in his possession, Margo places him under arrest. \n\n\nLuke and Noah walk in as Holden is being handcuffed and waiving his right to a lawyer. Luke shouts that Holden is innocent and shouldn't be there, but Margo says she had no choice. Holden asks Luke to go home, but Luke won't leave until Holden tells him exactly what's going on. Holden does, and then he asks Noah to get Luke back home. Luke calls Lily and tells her what has happened. Lily and Lucinda rush back to the police station, and Margo tells them to get a lawyer for Holden. Holden says all he needs is for Lily to go home and take care of herself, and he asks Luke to keep an eye on her. Luke and Noah leave together to go home, and Luke tells Noah that Holden called him the night Dusty died and said Dusty wouldn't be a problem anymore. He asks what that could have meant, and Noah tells Luke that Holden isn't capable of killing someone. Luke points out that Noah probably felt the same way about his own father, who turned out to be a murderer. Noah says that looking back on his life, there were signs that his own dad was capable of that, but he makes Luke realize that Holden is not. \n\n\nLily goes to the Lakeview, where she has arranged to meet with Bonnie. She tells Bonnie what's happening and explains that Holden has refused to get a lawyer. Given Bonnie's more personal relationship with Holden, Lily hopes that Bonnie can get him to change his mind. Bonnie and Lily go to the station, where they see Margo and Holden. Holden again insists that he doesn't want a lawyer, but Lily says Bonnie is his friend and wants to help him. Holden agrees to speak to Bonnie, so Margo lets them meet in the interrogation room. Holden lies to Bonnie about finding the syringe, saying it was just laying in the hallway at the hospital and that he'd been worried it was some other drug Lily had taken. He tells Bonnie he wanted to find out what it was, and he was at the drug cart when Susan Stewart walked by and saw him. Bonnie asks if Lily was ever in possession of the syringe, and Holden lies, saying Lily was asleep in her room the whole time. Margo comes and tells them that the judge has agreed to an immediate arraignment, so Lily will probably be able to get Holden out on bail. \n\n\n\n\n",
