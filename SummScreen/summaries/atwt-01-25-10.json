She tried to tell herself that it was \"time to move on,\" but she opened a bottle and took a drink.  Suddenly she heard footsteps, and for a moment she thought it was Jack, but Craig stepped out on the dock.  He questioned Carly about why she was sitting alone, drinking, on a dock on a freezing afternoon.\n\n\nCarly told Craig to mind his own business, but silver-tongued Craig responded by asking if Jack had gotten a \"case of family obligations,\" so Carly had decided to trash her life again.  Carly said that she had one sip of beer, and it had hardly ruined her life.  Craig said it didn't matter because he was \"so done\" with Carly, but she didn't believe him.  Craig also went on that he had not been overjoyed that Carly had gone back to the \"Jack Snyder Wheel of Pain.\"  He said Carly needed something else to occupy her time and energy.\n\n\nCarly brought up reviving her Monte Carlo design business, and they discussed working together on it.  Carly said she needed someone to \"run the back office\" for her business, and she asked Craig if he was interested.  Craig said he would work with her on one condition:  if he saw her take one drink of alcohol, he was out the door.  He declared that he would not be her police or her enabler.  If Carly drank, Craig walked.\n\n\nCarly gave Craig her word and poured the open beer into the lake.  She then said that she was going to an AA meeting.  She left the unopened bottles of beer on the dock and thanked Craig for stopping her from losing her hard-won sobriety.\n\n\nIn the parking lot of Memorial, Kim was backing out when Dr. Oliver, who had commandeered Luke's car, collided with her.  Bob ran to his wife immediately, as Luke called 9-1-1.  Oliver continued to sit in Luke's car and honk the horn, much to everyone's annoyance.  Bob made Kim get out of her car and insisted that she go back in the hospital to be examined.  Oliver tried to convince Luke that he was continuing to the airport for his flight back to Dallas, but Luke told him that he wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\nKim admitted that her neck was a little stiff, so Bob put her in a wheelchair, as Kim urged Luke to let the arrogant doctor leave.  A police officer arrived on the scene, and Luke reported that Dr. Oliver had caused an accident.  The cop asked Oliver for his license and registration, but the arrogant doctor called him \"Officer Fife\" and attempted to talk his way out of trouble.  The officer wrote out a summons and handed it to the doctor, who promptly suggested that the cop add littering to the charges against him.  Then Oliver wadded up the summons and threw it on the ground.\n\n\nThe officer immediately arrested Dr. Oliver and put the doctor in his squad car.  Bob asked Luke what the summons had cited Oliver for, so Luke picked it up and they had a laugh over the charges, which included driving with an expired license, operating a stolen vehicle, attempting to leave the scene of an accident, and resisting arrest.\n\n\nInside the hospital, Noah asked his nurse for a release form, and he began getting dressed.  He was disheartened that Reid Oliver had left with words of gloom and doom and without doing any surgery.  Luke arrived from the parking garage and tried to help his boyfriend, but Noah would not allow it.  He ordered Luke to \"stop hovering,\" and then he said that the two of them needed some space.  Luke asked Noah not to take his frustrations out on him, but Noah said that he was just trying to be honest.\n\n\nThe boys exchanged harsh words, and finally Noah shouted that Luke had no idea what it felt like to be sightless.  Then he talked about how much he had changed since the accident, and he said that he did not feel the same way about things, including their partnership.  Luke did not believe what he was hearing, and he continued to try to persuade Noah to return to Lily's house until they could make a plan.\n\n\nBob examined Kim in the hospital, and she complained vigorously, but she could not talk him out of ordering an EKG for her.  He reminded her that her doctor knew best, and he called Reid Oliver \"a jerk, but a talented jerk.\"  Meanwhile, Oliver appeared before a judge where the imperious doctor declared that he had run into \"a confederacy of idiots\" in Oakdale.  He protested that the doctors there \"all went to clown college,\" and the cops were \"dumber than rocks in a town that time forgot.\"  His fondest wish, he confessed to the judge, was to be able to sprout wings and fly right out of the courthouse.\n\n\nThe judge was tired of Oliver's harangue, and after the doctor's last remarks, he declared him a flight risk and remanded him over for a trial the next month.  At that moment, Bob Hughes entered the courtroom and asked to approach the bench.  He spoke to the judge, who was obviously a friend, about Oliver's \"enormous skill as a physician,\" which was, unfortunately, in \"direct proportion to his enormous ego.\"  Bob asked the judge to release the doctor to him and to allow him to practice medicine under Bob's guidance until his trial.  The judge banged the gavel and said, \"He's all yours, Bob.\"\n\n\nBob returned to Kim at the hospital, and she could not believe that her husband was going to take responsibility for the egotist Oliver.  Bob said he could use Oliver's skills on his staff, but Kim said he would hate having to ride herd on such a hotdog.  Bob agreed, but called the man \"a genius.\"\n\n\nElsewhere in Memorial, Like wheeled Noah from his room, and they made plans to go back to Lily's.  Reid Oliver walked by and asked \"Mr. Snyder\" if he was proud of himself.  Noah could not believe that Oliver was not winging his way to Dallas, so Luke mentioned that the good doctor had \"a little accident.\"  Oliver said that, thanks to Luke, he was \"stuck in Oakhell\" for another month.  Luke gave him back some smart remarks and then pushed Noah to the exit.\n\n\nAt the farm with Dusty, Janet talked to the cancer specialist in New York, and she was amazed that Dusty had already arranged for the doctor to get Liberty's medical records.  She thanked Dusty for the appointment, plus plane tickets and hotel reservations, and she gave him a big hug.  At that moment, Jack walked in, so Janet explained all that Dusty had done for them.  Jack called it \"an incredible gesture\" and shook Dusty's hand.\n\n\nJack walked Dusty out to his car, and Dusty told him that they needed \"to get a few things straight.\"  Dusty said that he knew that Jack had almost gone back to Carly that day, but Jack interrupted and said that discussion of his marriage was off-limits to Dusty.  Dusty warned Jack to be there for his wife and to never let Janet know how close Jack had been to leaving permanently.\n\n\nInside, Janet told Liberty that she had good news for a change: they were going to New York!  Liberty was thrilled because she thought that meant that she could talk directly to the Fashion Institute of Technology about her application, but Janet said that the visit was about seeing a cancer specialist.  Liberty said no to that because she said she had already resigned herself to face chemotherapy.  Janet mentioned that Jack would be with them on the trip, and Liberty was unhappy about that.  The girl asked her mother bluntly if Jack really loved Janet or just \"felt guilty\" because Liberty was ill.\n\n\nJack walked in and heard Liberty's question. He sat with her and said he didn't blame her for feeling that way, but he assured her that he wanted to be with and take care of her and Janet.  Jack said the trip to New York could also be fun, and he suggested they \"test the waters\" by letting him take his two girls out for a meal.  Liberty insisted on Al's Diner, and her other condition was that there be no leukemia talk at dinner.\n\n\nAt Al's, Liberty wasn't eating, and she finally confessed that she had ordered what Brad liked to eat instead of her favorites.  She admitted that she had been thinking a lot about her dad lately, so Jack began telling funny stories about the Snyder brothers when they were young.  The stories made Liberty laugh, as Jack and Janet both looked out the window and saw Carly watching them.  Carly walked into the diner and approached their table.  She spoke to Liberty and offered to help her on her fashion portfolio, but Janet was quick to speak up and say that was not necessary.\n\n\nCarly went to the counter and ordered take-out, and she sat on a stool and waited for her food.  Janet excused herself to go talk to the cook, and she went into the kitchen.  Alone at the table with Jack, Liberty said that she knew that Jack had returned home just because of her leukemia.  Jack protested, but Liberty gestured towards Carly and said, \"She changed it.\"  Jack kept talking to his stepdaughter, and Carly got her order and walked out.\n\n\nJanet was waiting outside to speak with Carly.  She pleaded with her to stay out of Jack's life unless it was about the children they shared.  Janet begged to be allowed to face Liberty's problems without having to worry about her husband, too, and Carly was moved and hugged her.  Janet said she needed to know if Jack was \"really back,\" and Carly assured the woman that he was.\n\n\nIn the Lakeview bar, Craig spotted Dusty downing scotches.  Craig said he was celebrating something, but Dusty showed no interest in knowing what it was.  Finally Craig said he knew a secret: Jack and Carly were not getting back together.  Dusty asked if Craig knew about Liberty's illness, and when Craig said that he did not, Dusty told him about the girl's leukemia.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Thanks to an accident with Kim in Luke's car and belligerent behavior towards everyone including a police officer, Dr. Oliver is arrested. Noah vents his anger towards Luke again thanks to the canceled surgery, but Luke is able to get through to him a bit again after Noah explains that his feelings are different regarding everything after he became blind. In between doting on Kim, making sure she is ok after her car accident with Dr. Oliver, Bob goes to court and speaks with his friend the judge, who is about to remand Dr. Oliver to custody thanks to more of his mouthing off. Bob asks that Dr. Oliver be released into his custody, which doesn't please the miserable doctor.

Liberty learns Jack is back and is sure that it is because she is sick even though Jack and Janet promise that is not the case. Liberty is not too happy to learn she is going to NY to see a doctor and not because of FIT. Jack promises to make it fun too. Jack, Janet and Liberty go to get some food when they have an awkward run in with Carly. Carly offers to help Liberty again with her portfolio, but Janet shoots her down.

Carly and Janet hug, as Carly promises that she won't get in her way. Jack and Liberty talk about Brad and he promises that he will be there for both her and Janet no matter what.
