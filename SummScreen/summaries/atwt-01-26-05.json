She promises she's not mad at him just because Emily's her sister and she tells him she'll always be there for him. Meanwhile, the dishes from Emily's kitchen are tested and come up spotless -- unusually spotless for an old set of cups. Hal, Emily and Paul quickly speculate that these could be brand new cups used to replace the ones Barbara used for drugging Emily. Rosanna then bursts in with the news of Will's disappearance and begs Paul to get his priorities straight by concentrating on his family and letting Emily take care of herself. Later, while Barbara is brought in and remains defensive in her involvement, Paul agrees to concentrate more on his family and later, Will returns. Meanwhile, Susan checks in with Barbara's old psychiatric hospital and learns that a vial of suggestibility drug has turned up missing.\n\n\nLucinda tells Jordan that Sierra will be his new boss at World Wide, but Jordan realizes that it's just another ruse Lucinda concocted to separate Craig and Sierra. Jordan then surprises Lucinda by resigning. Later, Lucinda makes a mysterious call offering someone else Jordan's old job. Meanwhile, Sierra tells Dusty she applauds him for letting Lucy go without proposing, but he surprises her by saying if he had it to do over again, he'd ask her to marry him. Sierra still thanks Dusty for always being there for her and they agree to always keep in touch.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "When Will disappears, Alison finds him and reminds him that she will always be his friend no matter what. She then convinces him to let everyone know he's safe. Susan finds out for Emily that when Barbara's therapist did his monthly check on his medicine cabinet, the drug that helps make a patient suggestible was missing. Roseanna reminds Paul that the world doesn't revolver around making Barbara pay for her crimes. When Barbara comes stomping out of the interrogation room howling about the fact no one is searching for her son, Paul tells her that it's ultimately her fault. Barbara vows that she'd go back to prison if it only made Will happy.",
