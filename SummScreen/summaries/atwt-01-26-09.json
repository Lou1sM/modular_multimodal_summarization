Margo said she had never agreed to stand up for her brother, but Craig gave her a hard time until she agreed to at least show up at the nuptials. Craig also asked her to invite Katie, as well. Margo called their sister and left a message. \n\n\nLily went out early and returned to break the news to Holden that Carly was marrying Craig at noon. Holden was stunned, and Lily said she felt somewhat responsible because she had planted the marriage seed in Craig's mind while they were discussing the custody battle for Johnny. \n\n\nCarly asked Parker what he really felt about her marrying Craig, but Parker was noncommittal. He was concerned, however, about Sage's reaction to the news, which had caused her to move in with her father and Janet. Parker left for hockey practice before school, just as Craig arrived. He told Carly he had arranged a simple civil ceremony before a judge at the Lakview, followed by a small reception with champagne and a wedding cake. By the way, he said, all of that was happening at noon. Carly complained the marriage revolved around the impending custody hearing for Johnny, but Craig gave her a choice of \"now or never.\" Carly asked if \"never\" worked for him, because she was not about to marry him unless her children agreed. Craig said he could fix the problem if only she would trust him. He told her to go upstairs and put on a lovely dress while he arranged everything. \n\n\nJack tried to hurry Sage to get ready for school, but the girl said her head hurt and she wasn't going to school. She told her dad she had a bad dream that she went back to Carly's, and Craig would not let her in and had given her room to Johnny. Jack took her to work at the police station where Margo let her play with an identity sketch kit. Jack mentioned he did not think Carly would go through with the wedding, so Margo broke the news to him that the marriage was happening soon. \n\n\nCraig found Parker leaving hockey practice and told him he had spoken to the school principal, and Parker did not have to go to school that day. He told the boy that he and Carly were getting married right away, on the condition that Parker, Sage, and J.J. approved, and those in town agreed to attend. Parker said J.J. was out of town, so Sage would be the big problem. Craig asked Parker for a chance to defend his case. He told the boy he wanted Parker to understand that he wanted to raise Johnny in a family with other children, and in return, he would support Carly and her children for the rest of his life. Craig also mentioned his dead son, Bryant, and asked Parker to give him a chance at a \"do over\" in raising another boy. \n\n\nKatie and Brad made love on the floor in front of their fireplace and later were starving. Brad fantasized about the Swedish meatballs with cheese from Al's Diner, and he offered to get dressed and go get the food. He made Katie promise she would not get dressed while he was gone, and off he went. Margo showed up soon after and told Katie that Craig was marrying Carly, and Katie thought Carly was out of her mind. Neither of them could understand why Carly was willing to put herself in such a position with their brother. Katie suggested they go along with the plan, however, in order to keep a close eye on the Johnny situation. Margo left to change her clothes, leaving Katie to ponder how she could get Brad to attend the nuptials with her. \n\n\nHolden dropped in on Carly and expressed concern for her decision. He, too, asked her if she was out of her mind, and Carly took offense at his intrusion into her business. She asked him why he could not leave her alone to live her life, and hinted that perhaps he could not bear to see her with another man. Holden could not believe that Craig had changed for the better and felt it was all about custody of Johnny. Carly explained that she was tired of being alone and raising kids on her own while trying to run a business at Metro. Holden told her not to settle for security in place of love, and he suggested someone wonderful would find her in the future. Carly said she was tired of struggling, and had made up her mind. \n\n\nParker went to the police station and told Jack he wanted to talk with Sage. Jack took him to his sister, and Parker told her he didn't feel the children had the right to stop Carly from marrying Craig. Sage admitted she wanted her mother to be happy, but she felt Craig was a bad man. Parker asked the girl to go with him to the wedding, and Sage reluctantly agreed. \n\n\nBrad got home with the meatballs and found Katie dressed for the wedding. She told him they had to go and support her brother, but Brad protested and reminded her they had almost broken up because of Craig. He refused to give his brother-in-law another chance and refused to attend the ceremony. He suggested they both stay home and work on their own family. They talked about conceiving a baby and Katie's becoming a mother. Brad convinced Katie to skip the wedding and to start on the baby making immediately. He removed her dress, and they fell on the bed. \n\n\nCraig went back to Carly's, followed shortly by Parker and Sage. The kids said they were taking the day off to attend their mom's wedding, and Carly embraced Sage while Craig beamed. Mother and daughter went to find suitable attire, and Craig asked Parker to be his best man. Craig left to stall the judge at the Lakeview, and Carly asked Sage to upgrade from flower girl to maid of honor. \n\n\nCraig talked with the judge about keeping the ceremony as short as possible, as Holden and Lily arrived. When Craig began musing that he hoped their two families could become even closer in the near future, Holden gagged and left to get a drink. Lily asked why Carly was not in evidence, as the judge approached and mistook her for the bride. As Craig paid off the judge to stall for more time, Margo showed up, also wondering where the bride was. Carly and Sage finally came in, and Craig presented them both with nosegays. The judge assumed his position as Craig said a few words. As the ceremony began, Carly looked around the room and froze as Jack walked in.\n\n\n",
