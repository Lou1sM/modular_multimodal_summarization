Susan Stewart entered her daughter's room and chewed out Paul for pushing Emily to have a baby with him.  She suggested that Paul \"take a walk\" while she checked Emily's vitals, so Paul went outside.  Barbara tried to get her son to eat, but he refused.  Susan left Emily's room and approached Barbara to ask if she was still getting \"treatments\" from Mick Dante.\n\n\nBarbara confirmed that she was still taking Mick's serum, so Susan warned her that she could be in a coma next.  Susan walked away, and Paul said, with bitterness, that he would like to \"take a break from Mick.\"  He went back in with Emily, as Barbara hurried out and headed to Old Town.\n\n\nAlison walked through Old Town, too, and Mick followed her at a distance.  She opened the door to Java, but then she turned and looked behind her.  She did not see Mick, who was hiding behind a pillar.  Alison went inside and looked at photos of bridal gowns, but then she remembered the dress she wore in her dream at the old church.  Someone grabbed her shoulder, and Alison overreacted, but it was only Casey.  Mick, however, watched her through the glass door.\n\n\nBarbara walked past Mick, and then she recognized him.  She looked at whom he was watching and made a remark about never trusting him.  Mick was not pleased that Barbara had witnessed his voyeurism, so he followed her.  He told Barbara that he had no desire for Alison; he was just making sure that the girl was focused on her wedding rather than entertaining suspicions about him.\n\n\nBarbara told Mick that Paul would not leave Emily's side, even to eat or sleep, and he no longer had any trust in Mick.  Mick called Barbara \"more of an alarmist than an ally,\" so she remarked that Paul would still be angry with Emily if she hadn't gotten ill.  Mick agreed that there needed to be \"a permanent rift\" between them, and Barbara questioned why Mick didn't just wake up Emily for damage control.\n\n\nPaul went back into Emily's room, and Susan declared that comas didn't just happen without a medical explanation.  She said the only variable with which they were dealing was the serum that Mick was administering to Emily.  Susan suggested that perhaps Mick had not given them the real serum to test or that he was hiding something that could kill her daughter.  Paul jumped up and told Susan that he was going to deal with Mick Dante.\n\n\nSusan ran after Paul, and they both went to Mick's room in the Lakeview.  Paul pounded on the door until Susan made him stop.  Then Paul pulled out a key, and Susan was horrified that he was going to break into the room and possibly get arrested.  Paul told his mother-in-law to go away because one of them needed to be available to help Emily.  Susan left reluctantly and cautioned Paul to be careful.\n\n\nPaul let himself into the room and began rummaging in drawers.  In one drawer, he found a box that contained a vial of blood labeled \"P R.\"  He mused that he had no memory of ever giving Mick a blood sample.  In the same box, Paul also found the childhood photos of him, Barbara, and James, and he was stunned.\n\n\nAt the Hughes home, Margo scolded Tom for drinking coffee and reading the newspaper at the kitchen table.  She was tidying up in preparation for a meeting with Susan and Alison about the wedding.  Margo snatched away Tom's cup and reminded him that the Stewart women would be arriving any minute, and Tom suggested that since they would soon all be related by marriage, perhaps Margo should refer to the Stewarts as individuals instead of an \"organism.\"  Margo encouraged her husband to make the day a happy one and not to ask too many practical questions, such as how or where the newlyweds were going to live.\n\n\nAt Java, Casey looked at apartment ads, but Alison was distracted.  She blamed it on being tired and worried about her sister.  She looked at her watch and announced that they had to go to Casey's right away or they would be late.  She was not eager to give her mother and Margo any time alone in light of their families' histories.\n\n\nSusan arrived at the Hughes's, and she asked Tom if he had mentioned anything about Emily's illness to young Daniel.  Tom said no, because Paul had said that he did not want to upset the boy who was away at boarding school.  The thought that Paul was making decisions for her family put Susan in a foul mood, and when Margo graciously suggested that they were willing to contribute a large share of the money for the wedding, Susan bellowed, \"You people are always trying to run everything.\"  Susan took every offer of help the wrong way, and finally declared herself \"mad as hell.\"  Alison and Casey arrived in the midst of one of Susan's tirades, and Casey turned to his fianc\u00e9e and asked her how elopement sounded to her.\n\n\nThe engaged couple developed a plan while helping themselves to coffee.  They decided to be non-committal to all suggestions, so they agreed to look at two different florists, photographers, and other wedding vendors.  Then Margo dropped the bomb that she and Tom would love to have the newlyweds live with them at their house, and that caused Casey to abandon the plan and say, \"Oh, oh.\" Casey covered by saying that he and Alison needed to discuss that, and both mothers thought that was reasonable.\n\n\nSusan offered to help her daughter find a wedding dress, but Alison said that her mother needed to take care of Emily.  Susan apologized for not being more available, but Alison freaked out and told her mother to quit putting so much pressure on her, and she ran out on the patio.\n\n\nCasey joined Alison outside, and she said she was sorry for losing it.  Casey said that he'd play the non-committal role again, and they kissed.  Casey went back in to talk with his dad, and he told Tom that he had decided to major in pre-law.  Tom's reaction was something less that Casey had hoped, and the young man was upset that his father thought that he would make a lousy lawyer.\n\n\nOn the patio, Alison took a call from Mick, but Susan walked out at that moment, so Alison hung up.  Susan hugged her daughter and said she had to return to Memorial, and they parted on good terms.  Alison then called Mick back to tell him again to stop calling her.  Mick reminded her that she had just called him, and he agreed that they should stay out of one another's lives.  Before she hung up, Alison asked if Mick had followed her in Old Town that day, and he was pleased that she had felt his presence.  He told her to visit Emily soon, and he hung up.\n\n\nAlison went back inside and told Margo that she had made up her mind: not only would she and Casey like to move in with them after their marriage, but she would like to make the move immediately.  Margo was delighted, and Casey was somewhat taken aback.  Casey and Alison went to Casey's room to discuss their plans further, but Alison could not keep her eyes open.  Casey offered his bed for a nap, since he had to do homework elsewhere.  Alison lay down, saying how safe she felt there, but as she fell asleep, Mick Dante watched her through the window.\n\n\nTom and Margo talked about Casey's plans to be a lawyer, but Tom reminded his wife that their son was a convicted felon.  In order to sit for the bar exam, Casey would have to produce a Certificate of Moral Character and General Fitness, and there were some people in town who would protest that.  Tom was afraid that being a lawyer was an unattainable goal for Casey.\n\n\nMick returned to the hospital and skulked around until he had a chance to slip into Emily's room.  Paul had not returned yet, so when a nurse left, Mick went inside.  He removed a syringe from his bag, but he first had to fight through one of his horrendous head pains before he could insert the drug into Emily's IV.  Paul suddenly opened the door and found Mick monitoring Emily, and Paul slammed him against a wall and asked Mick why he had photos of Paul in his room.  Mick said it was part of his \"research\" on Paul, but then Paul yelled at Mick, and asked him who he really was.\n\n\nBoth men heard Emily's voice say, \"Paul?\"  They looked at Emily and she was awake.  Paul ran to his wife's side and explained where Emily was.  She could not believe that she had been in a coma for a week.  Mick stepped up and claimed to have found an anomaly in Emily's blood work that was caused by an Indian herb she was using as a supplement.  Emily apologized for not telling Mick about the herb, but Paul was more upset that Mick had given Emily some sort of antidote without checking with anyone  on the staff first.  Mick left the room in a hurry, but he stuck around, peering through the glass.\n\n\nEmily asked Paul to find her mother, so Paul walked out.  Mick slipped back in and plunked himself down on Emily's bed.  He made direct eye contact with her and stated that she had no idea how the coma had happened to her, and he needed her to remember that he had saved her life, and she trusted him completely.  Emily agreed to all the conditions, and then he said that he wanted to talk about Paul.\n\n\nWhen Paul returned, his wife was alone.  He asked her about the last thing she remembered before blacking out, and she said that she was sitting on their couch and felt dizzy.  She said she was comfortable with Mick's antidote, but Paul was not certain about that.  Suddenly Emily said that she remembered something bad, and she got angry.  She recalled that she was upset because Paul believed that she had called the police about Meg, and she began to get wound up.  Paul immediately apologized for doubting Emily and begged her forgiveness.  Emily said she could forgive him if he would let them continue their quest to have a baby together.\n\n\nMick returned, and Emily immediately told him her plan to continue the treatments.  Paul got furious, and Mick wisely told the two of them to settle their own differences, and he left.  Paul looked at Emily and said that he thought there was still something very wrong with her.\n\n\nSusan was on her way back to Memorial when she ran into Barbara.  Barbara asked if there was any news about Emily, but Susan said no.  Then Barbara said that she thought Susan should be worried about her other daughter, as well, but Susan didn't understand.  Barbara said that Alison had been \"seeing Mick Dante,\" and that disgusted Susan, who walked away.  She went up to Emily's room and was overjoyed when she saw that her daughter was awake.\n\n\n Emily told her that Mick had figured out about the herbal supplement, but Paul said Emily had been talking crazy about wanting to keep trying to get pregnant.  Susan totally agreed with Paul that it was way too soon for Emily to think such thoughts, but Emily was adamant.  She swore that Mick Dante had saved her life, and she trusted him implicitly.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Alison continues to struggle between her feelings for Mick and Casey and the pressure only gets worse when the Hughes Stewart feud begins again as they argue over which family should pay for the wedding. Tom and Margo offer to pay for most of it since they have a larger family but Susan thinks that the Hughes don't think she has the money to give Allison a fancy wedding. Margo and Tom ask Casey and Alison to live with them after they are married. Alison agrees with Casey but later changes her mind when she feels Mick I following her and he calls her again. Alison makes it clear that Mick should stop calling her and he says that he will never call her again. Alison is tired and she falls asleep in Casey's bed and Mick watches her sleep from outside the Hughes house. Casey tells Tom he wants to be a lawyer and is upset when Tom thinks he should consider another career. Tom later tells Margo that since Casey is a convicted felon he needs a letter of good moral conduct and mental and physical readiness before he can take the bar exam. Tom fears that the local D.A. or a judge that wants to appear tough on crime won't allow Casey to take the bar exam. Tom didn't want to tell Casey this because he couldn't bear to crush Casey's dream of being a lawyer. Paul is suspicious when he finds a Stenbeck family picture in Mick's room and confronts Mick about his identity. Mick doesn't answer because Emily awakens from her coma thanks to a drug that Mick put in her IV before Paul cane to visit her. Mick also put a mind control drug in Emily's IV and he tells Emily to tell Paul that she trusts him with her life since he saved her. Mick also tells Emily to tell Paul that since she trusts him with her life she wants Mick to continue giving her the treatments so she can have a baby. Emily does as Mick told her and Paul and Susan both agree that she shouldn't continue the treatments to have a baby.",
