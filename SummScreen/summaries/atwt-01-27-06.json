Margo and Hal were there, along with others of Oakdale's finest, and Mike decided to call Jack and invite him and Carly to come join them. Katie questioned the wisdom of that, given the job situation between Nick and Jack and Nick's constant flirtations with Carly, but Mike told her it was no big deal. When Jack and Carly arrived and saw Nick, Carly wanted to turn around and go home, but Jack said they should stay. Jack approached Hal and apologized for the things he'd said at the station about Hal still wanting Emily; Hal accepted the apology but then told Jack he was going to pair him up with Nick to finish working on the illegal gambling investigation. Jack told Carly the news, then went to get a couple of beers for them to drink. Nick approached Carly and asked her to dance, but Carly refused. Jack returned with the beers and began drinking fast and furiously. Margo offered a toast to the engaged couple; later, Nick jokingly toasted Paul Ryan, thanking him for being dead and thus making the investigation so easy to wrap up. Jack shouted that Nick was being a jerk by laughing at a dead man who had plenty of connections in Oakdale and who was a human being, no matter what he'd done. Nick and Jack got in each other's' faces, and Nick offered to \"take it outside.\"\n\n\nCasey found Maddie at Java and invited her to a \"Star Wars\" movie marathon. Maddie said she had other plans, but Casey didn't believe her and pressed her for details. Spotting a classmate nearby, Maddie pointed to him and said she had plans with him. Casey was entirely disbelieving, so Maddie got up and walked over to the boy, whose name was Nate, and asked if he knew who she was. He not only knew who she was but had been wanting to talk to her for a long time, so they sat down at a table together as a disbelieving Casey looked on. Nate told Maddie he enjoyed her sense of humor and her intelligence, and Maddie was flattered to find that he really was interested in her. Nate had to leave but told Maddie he'd be back later and asked her to watch his stuff for him; when he left, Casey told Maddie that Nate was all wrong for her because he was too brainy. Maddie asked why Casey cared, since she was like an \"annoying little sister\" to him, and Casey realized Maddie must have overheard him calling her that when he was talking to his mom. Casey told Maddie he'd just told his mom that and that he really cared about her a lot, as a friend.\n\n\nAt the cabin in the woods, Paul insisted to Meg that he was going to go to his own memorial service, telling her he had to go so he could find out whether his sister could ever forgive him for what he'd done. Meg told him he couldn't go, for obvious reasons, but said that she'd go instead and report back to him on what was said.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Will told Gwen he wasn't sure if he should go to Paul's memorial service or not, but then he remembered that Paul had forgiven him after he'd killed Rose, and he said maybe he should have forgiven Paul, too. Gwen told him he should go to the service, and he said he would if she went with him. When Emily arrived at the service, Barbara tried to kick her out, but Emily told her she'd been invited by the minister and she was staying. After more harassment from Barbara, Emily turned to leave, but Henry walked in and told her she had to stay for appearance's sake. Barbara stood and gave a eulogy for Paul, in which she blamed herself for not having been able to keep him safe from his father and for not being there when he needed her the most. Meg walked in, much to Dusty and Jennifer's surprise, and then Will and Gwen arrived. Just as Barbara said she had failed Paul, Paul arrived, listening from the vestibule. Jennifer then stood and spoke about Paul and how much he had hurt her, but in the end, saying that she forgave him and probably would eventually have forgiven him if he had lived. Meg spotted Paul at the back of the church looking in and got up and went to the vestibule to try to get him to leave. The minister then asked Emily if she wanted to speak, which made Barbara very upset, but Emily was unable to complete her remarks. She quickly left the church, but when she got to the front door, she overheard Paul's voice.\n\n\n",

Paul wants to go to the memorial service because he needs to know if his family forgives him, but Meg refuses, insisting she go in his stead. She's furious when he shows up and is nearly caught by Emily. Casey can't understand why Maddie is blowing him off for a guy in her calculus class until he realises she overheard what he said to Margo.\r\nSource: tv.com",

Jack gets drunk and Nick challenges him to a fight at Mike and Kate's engagement party. Jack isn't happy that Hal wants him to partner with Nick on the gambling case. Emily runs out of the church crying and thinks she hears Paul's voice as well as sees his face outside the church.",
