Finally, Carly answered, \"I don't!\" Craig tried to smooth things over by inviting everyone to have a drink while he solved the little \"hiccup\" that seemed to be holding Carly back. He escorted his unwilling bride outside, but Carly stopped him and said she could not marry him because she was not in love with him. Craig said he didn't love her, either, so that had nothing to do with it. It further irritated Craig that Carly had chosen that moment to have an attack of conscience, and he reminded her that the two of them had a deal. Carly declared the wedding off and went back inside to make that declaration to their guests. She thanked everyone for coming, as a bitter Craig walked out. \n\n\nJohnny and Dusty, holding baby Eliza, were in Reno, and Johnny was hopeful they were going to a rodeo. His dad explained they were in Reno for a different reason, and it was apparent they were waiting for Meg to appear. A judge was also waiting, and suggested Meg might have had a change of heart, but Dusty assured him she would be there. Finally Meg walked in and told Dusty her divorce from Paul was official. Dusty asked her if she was ready to tie the knot, and she replied, \"Absolutely.\" She went on to tell him that Paul's recent actions had scared her, and she wanted Dusty by her side for protection. The judge urged extended readings and some romance, but Meg and Dusty just wanted to get the formalities done. As the ceremony began, Meg put on a veil and picked up a bouquet, as the judge led them through their brief vows. The judge then declared them man and wife, so Dusty kissed Meg on the cheek. The judge razzed him so badly that, with Meg's permission, Dusty planted a healthy kiss on her lips. Johnny tossed rose petals as they all left to catch the jet back to Oakdale. Johnny asked if Meg was his new mother, and she suggested he just call her Meg. \n\n\nMargo found Craig in the Lakeview lobby and told him that marriage to Carly would have been a mistake any custody judge would have seen right through. Craig got into the elevator and expressed anger and disgust with Carly, and complained that he was still alone. Lily knocked on Craig's door a few minutes later, and she returned to him the wedding rings Parker had been holding for the wedding. Craig was suspicious that Lily was supporting him over Dusty in the custody battle for Johnny and asked her to leave. He said he needed to begin forgetting about Carly and her affair with Holden and her marriage to Jack. After Lily left, Craig threw the rings into the wastebasket and poured himself a drink. \n\n\nHolden asked Carly what had stopped her from going through with the marriage, and she told him it was seeing Jack walk in and remembering how it felt when she was marrying him. That was how it felt to be marrying someone you really loved, she said. Lily interrupted them and told them Craig was in a bad way. \n\n\nBack at Carly's house, her children went to change their clothes as Jack needled Carly for almost making another terrible mistake with her life. As he left for work, he gave Carly a hug and told her he was glad she had not gone through with the marriage, because Craig wasn't worth it. After he left, Carly looked hopeful. \n\n\nAt the farm, Lily seemed put out that Holden had held an intimate conversation with Carly, and he discovered his wife was giving him credit for bringing Carly to her senses. They squabbled about Lily's perception of what kind of relationship he and Carly still shared. \n\n\nAn inebriated Craig knocked on Carly's door and then barged in, making remarks about the \"infamous Carly Tenney.\" He accused her of using him and his son to make someone else jealous, and then he asked if that someone was Jack or Holden, or perhaps both. He said she had managed to destroy his life and make it impossible for him to be with the one person he cared most about: Johnny. He further suggested she had played him, but then changed direction by saying she had stopped the wedding to see what Jack would do. Carly defended herself by saying she had backed out because her children hated him. Craig said when she \"fell out of favor with the flatfoot and the farmhand,\" she need not come crying to him. Then he added that he was calling in his loan, and she owed him $200,000. Carly followed him outside and yelled that he should not be driving in his condition, but Craig took off. Carly yelled at Parker to keep an eye on his sister, and she followed Craig. \n\n\nDusty brought Meg back to the farm, and they were surprised to find Lily and Holden there. Lily informed them that Craig and Carly had not gone through with their wedding, and that shocked Meg. She then told them that she and Dusty had gotten married in Reno. Holden did not believe her because he thought she was still married to Paul. Meg explained that Dusty had expedited the divorce, and she and Dusty were legally married. Lily pushed Dusty outside to allow the siblings some private time. Outside, Dusty told Lily he needed her help. \n\n\nInside the farmhouse, Holden warned Meg that Paul would flip out when he learned that Meg had married someone else, and especially if that someone was Dusty. Meg accused Holden of taking her marriage to Dusty personally because he and Lily had been lovers. Holden asked what Johnny got out of the marriage besides a fake family. Meg countered by asking her brother how he could get on his high horse after what he had done with Carly over the summer. Lily and Dusty came back, and after a few words, Holden and Lily left for home. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Margo told Jack that Craig was not taking Carly's rejection well. She also cautioned him to beware of Carly, who was still single and lonely. Jack said his concern for Carly only extended to the children they shared. \n\n\nDusty told Meg he would return in the morning and pick her up so they could find somewhere suitable to live. She kidded him about his inherited fortune, and suggested they find a very expensive home. \n\n\nCarly found Craig pounding on Dusty's door at the Lakeview, yelling for Johnny. He screamed at her never to come near him again, and he dashed off.\n\n\n",
