    "soap_central": "\n\n \nPaul spoke with Emily, who was refusing any more tests at the hospital.  She said that she knew there was nothing wrong with her, and she urged Paul to trust her.  Paul said that if Susan agreed to Emily's release, then she could go home.  Emily answered her phone, and her face assumed a frozen expression.  Mick's voice asked if everything was \"on track,\" and Emily assured him it was.  Mick guaranteed that Emily would be pregnant very soon.\n\n\nAlison awoke suddenly from her nap in Casey's bedroom and looked out the window and screamed.  Casey rushed in, but Alison saw nothing.  Casey dismissed her upset to a bad dream, and he hugged his fianc\u00e9e.  Meanwhile, Paul went out into the hall at Memorial and called Alison to tell her that her sister was awake.  Alison was excited and promised to rush to the hospital, but Paul said that Emily was waiving any treatment and was heading home to Fairwinds.  Alison left Casey in a hurry, and while she was happy that her sister was apparently all right, she hoped Emily didn't put herself right back into the hospital.\n\n\nPaul and Emily arrived home and kissed.  Paul begged forgiveness again for believing that his wife had called the cops on Meg.  Emily forgave him, as Mick walked in with a bag.  Paul was surprised, but Emily said that she had invited Mick to move into Fairwinds with them.  Paul was aghast, but Emily explained that they needed Mick in order to make a baby.  Paul did not believe that, and he pointed out that Mick was the reason that Emily had been in a coma.\n\n\nEmily said that Paul was wrong, but Paul suggested that Mick walk back out the way he had arrived.  Emily made Paul be quiet, and she asked Mick to wait in another room while she had a private conversation with her \"hard-headed husband.\"  Mick complied, and Emily lit into Paul and said she really needed Mick there at Fairwinds.  Alison ran in and hugged her sister, and she was amazed to see Emily on her feet and displaying no weakness.  Alison said she was very happy that Emily would be at her wedding.\n\n\nAlison wrongly assumed that Susan and the Memorial medical team had gotten Emily out of her coma, but Emily revealed that Mick was the hero.  Mick walked in at that moment, as Emily gave him the credit for reversing her coma.  She said she didn't know what she would do without him.  Mick said he had just stumbled across why Emily was in the coma, and Emily walked over and kissed him on the lips.  He suggested she lie down and rest, and Emily agreed instantly, and she invited Paul to go with her to \"tuck her in.\"\n\n\nWhen they were alone, Alison asked Mick \"what the hell\" was going on.  She said she could not understand how a \"New Age vagabond with a mysterious plant\" did what none of the medical experts at Memorial could do.  \"Just lucky, I guess,\" quipped Mick.  Alison asked how he had pushed himself into Paul and Emily's marriage and lives, and she didn't even know who Mick Dante was.  Alison accused him of spying on her from the window ledge at Casey's, but Mick contended that she had dreamed that.\n\n\nAlison finally insisted that Mick stop messing with her head, but he interpreted her dreams as her brain's recognizing that the \"ideal\" life she had planned with Casey was not so great after all.  Mick mentioned the collage on the wall of Casey's bedroom, and Alison knew that Mick had been spying.  He admitted that he cared about her, but Alison ordered him to leave.  Mick said he couldn't because he was too close to his goal.  He referred to \"this thing\" between the two of them as a \"distraction\" to his research, but Alison denied having any kind of a connection with him.  She turned on her heel and ran out.\n\n\nUpstairs, Emily and Paul began kissing on her bed until she began a serious seduction.  Paul was nervous that Mick and Alison were just downstairs, but Emily was a woman on a mission.  She did not appear to be just recovering from a week-long coma.\n\n\nAlison went back to Casey's, and the two of them kissed in his room.  They had just begun to get serious when Alison thought that she heard a noise outside.  She made Casey open the window and look outside, but there was no one there.  Casey joked that there were no \"killer spiders or spying squirrels,\" but Alison was too jumpy to continue.  She said she still wanted to wait to have sex until after they were married, so they just cuddled.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Mick downed a large tumbler of scotch as Emily and Paul returned to the living room.  Paul then asked Mick to move in and become part of their family.  Emily was ecstatic that Paul had changed his mind.\n\n\nHolden visited Meg at Deerbrook, and he told her that he and Molly had tracked down former officer Grady, but unfortunately Grady had not admitted that Damian had paid for his silence.  Meg cried with disappointment and declared that Grady was lying, but Holden said that Molly was an experienced reporter and had done everything she could to get Grady to tell the truth.  Meg got even more upset and declared that Damian had won.\n\n\nMolly saw how discouraged Holden was when he walked out of Meg's room, and, with tears in her eyes, she apologized to him.  Holden kissed her and thanked her for trying to get Grady to incriminate Damian, and he said that he would never forget what she had done.  As the two of them left Deerbrook, Sharkey, Meg's orderly, walked into Meg's room to taunt her.  He said that Mr. Grimaldi had called and was sorry that he could not visit her because he was off on some romantic weekend trip with his wife.  \"Go to hell!\" yelled Meg.\n\n\n Sharkey advised that Meg shouldn't take it out on him because she wasn't \"getting any action at the Branford Inn.\" Meg began to sob, and Sharkey offered her his handkerchief.  Meg took it and threw it on the floor next to her bed.  When Sharkey bent down to retrieve it, Meg grabbed a metal tray she had hidden between her pillows and bashed Sharkey over the head with it.\n\n\nOn their weekend getaway, Lily and Damian lay on their bed, and Damian kissed her and promised to bring her a cup of tea.  Lily then suggested that they head back to pick up Natalie and Ethan, who were at the farm with Holden and Emma.  Damian reluctantly agreed, but he left the room to pick up some coffee \"for the road.\"  When he stepped outside, however. Damian called Molly on her cell phone, and she confirmed that she had not told Holden the truth about Damian's paying off Grady.  Molly reminded Damian, though, that the truth always surfaced.  He said the only way for her to keep her relationship with Holden was to continue to hide the truth, but Molly hung up on Damian.\n\n\nBack at the Snyder farm, Holden was discouraged that Meg had apparently lost her grip on reality.  Molly suggested that he not beat himself up about it, and she urged him to get away for a few days.  Holden thought for a moment and then suggested that the two of them go to California to visit Abigail.  They clinked their beer bottles in a toast to their trip, and then they kissed.\n\n\nMolly's conscience got the better of her, however, and she announced that she couldn't lie any more.  She turned to Holden and admitted that Damian had gotten to her.  She began crying that Holden would hate her forever, and then she said that Grady had admitted that Damian had paid him off.  Molly was ashamed that she had let Damian convince her that Holden would leave her to go back to Lily when Lily was free again.\n\n\nHolden could not believe that Molly thought he would leave her.  He said it was over with Lily, and Molly was never \"the other woman,\" and she should have trusted him.  Molly was afraid that she had really blown it with Holden, and he could give her no reassurance.  Holden was especially upset that Meg had been in Deerbrook the whole time for no valid reason.  Then Holden realized that Damian had let Holden's whole family believe that he was dead, and he swore that there was \"no way in hell\" that he was going to let Damian get away with it.  He next worried about Lily and said he needed to find her and warn her.  Molly cried as Holden dashed out.\n\n\nDamian cursed loudly on his end of Molly's dropped call.  Lily heard him swearing, so she opened the door and asked what was wrong.  Damian blamed his bad mood on problems at the office, and then he told Lily that he had a surprise for her.  He said that instead of going home, they were flying to Malta on his company jet.  Lily said that she needed to go home to take care of her children, but Damian extolled the virtues of \"long days on a Mediterranean beach and long nights making a baby\" with Lily.\n\n\nLily looked at Damian as if he were crazed, and she said that he was not listening to her.  She told him she could not leave for Europe without some advance notice.  She also felt that she needed to speak with Holden first.  Damian lost his composure then and shouted the question of why everything had to involve Holden.  Lily was stunned to hear her new husband say that he was sick and tired of hearing Holden's name on Lily's lips all the time.  Damian apologized for blowing up, and he said that he felt that certain forces were trying to pull them apart.  Lily promised that they would be together, but she was confused by Damian's apparent desperation to leave the country.\n\n\nThey went back into their room, and Lily told her husband that she was sure there was more going on than he was telling her.  Damian denied that and only said that he didn't want to lose her again.  Lily tried to convince him that her relationship with Holden was finished forever.  They kissed, and Lily asked to go home.  Damian agreed and said how much he loved her.  He suggested that Lily pack their belongings while he settled the bill.  Lily began picking up their clothes, but she suddenly thought of something, grabbed her purse and coat, and left the room.  A few minutes later, a woman's gloved hand opened the door with a key card and turned off the lights.\n\n\nDamian returned to the room and asked why Lily hadn't met him downstairs as they had planned.  He noticed clothes on the floor and then spotted a person in the bed with the covers pulled up.  Damian grinned and assumed that Lily \"had a much better idea\" than rushing home to their regular lives.  Damian pulled off his shirt and pulled back the bedclothes.  In the bed, lay an unsmiling Meg.  Damian jumped up, called Meg \"crazy,\" and asked how she had gotten out of Deerbrook.  Meg denied that she was crazy and slipped a syringe into her right hand.\n\n\nMeg taunted Damian and then told him that she still loved him.  Damian shouted that she was \"insane,\" but Meg got out of bed and walked very close.  She leaned up to kiss him and flicked the needle guard from the syringe. Damian began his old litany of lies and compliments to Meg, and when he said he had always loved her, Meg kissed him again and attempted to jab him with the hypodermic.  Damian caught her wrist and shoved her back, but Meg recovered and leapt on him.  They struggled until Damian was able to force Meg back on the bed, and he jumped on top of her and put his hands around her throat.\n\n\nMeg writhed and fought, but Damian overpowered her, and eventually Meg went limp.  Damian got frantic and, trying to revive her, muttered, \"What have I done?\" over and over.  Lily slipped her key into the lock at that moment and opened the door.\n\n\n",
