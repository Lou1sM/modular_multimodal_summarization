She told her mother that she had learned that Holden had been charged with killing Dusty, but she believed Holden wasn't responsible. As she continued to expand on her regrets over the events surrounding Dusty's death, Susan told her to stop talking like she was guilty of killing him because Susan had made sure that no one suspected her. Emily was confused by Susan's confession and wanted to know what her mother meant when she said that she had taken suspicion away from Emily. \n\n\nSusan explained that she had told Margo about seeing Holden in front of the drug cart at the hospital the night of Dusty's murder. Emily was shocked, but Susan made it clear that everything she had said had been true and that if Holden were innocent, he would be exonerated. She reminded Emily that if the police were focused on Holden, then they wouldn't be looking at Emily as a suspect. Emily told her mother that she didn't want Holden going to jail just to take suspicion off of her. \n\n\nSusan reminded Emily that if Margo took her in for questioning, she would have to admit that she had been fighting with Chris about her past as a prostitute, which could lead to her losing visitation with her son, Daniel. As the two continued their talk, Tom arrived and asked to speak with Emily about something that would affect Daniel. Alison walked in, and Emily tried to use her to escape talking to Tom, but he revealed that he had called Alison because he needed to talk to both of them about Dusty's final wishes. \n\n\nTom sat with Emily and Alison in the Lakeview and explained that Dusty's will had a college fund set aside for Alison. He also handed Alison a letter from Dusty that heartened her to move on with her life and go to school. Emily encouraged her sister to return to college and reminded her that it would have made Dusty proud. Tom then focused his attention on Emily and told her that Dusty's will might drastically affect how much time she would be spending with her son. \n\n\nEmily opened the envelope Dusty had left her and found ownership papers for the Intruder. Tom explained the paper was hers alone and that Dusty had wanted her to own it free and clear. Emily tearfully claimed she didn't want to benefit from Dusty's death. Tom left so Emily and Alison could discuss Dusty's gifts. Alison told her sister to appreciate Dusty's generosity, but Emily began to cry, saying she couldn't profit from his death. Alison asked her sister to say what was going on, but Emily rushed from the room. \n\n\nAlison found Susan and told her the good news about Dusty offering to pay for her college and giving Emily the newspaper. Susan was grateful for Dusty's gifts and believed that he had to have felt he owed the girls something. Alison went on to tell her mom that Emily was freaking out over the will and Dusty's death. Susan explained that Emily was just grieving and advised Alison to let Emily deal with it on her own. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Emily had an ice cream cone and thought back on happy memories of sharing a cone with Dusty. She sadly threw the cone away and walked off. \n\n\nAt the farm, Holden sat at the kitchen table as Lily entered and asked how he had been doing since he had gotten bailed out of jail. He admitted that he wasn't sleeping well but didn't want Lily to worry because she was still recovering from her drug overdose. Lily told Holden she wanted to help in his defense and would go with him to see Bonnie. Holden explained to Lily that Bonnie was not his lawyer, and even though she had helped him get out on bail, she would not be representing him if his case went to trial. \n\n\nLily felt as if Holden wasn't being honest with her about the night of Dusty's death, and she wanted to know what he was hiding. Holden encouraged her to rest, and when Meg entered the kitchen, she also asked Lily to relax. Lily relented to Meg and Holden and headed to her room, while Meg grilled her brother about what had really happened the night Dusty had died. Holden angrily told Meg to back off, but she refused to relent and continued to ask what he knew. Holden refused to talk about it but asked his sister to help take care of Lily and his family. \n\n\nUp in her room, Lily dreamed about the night of Dusty's death and remembered seeing his lifeless body on the floor of Bob's office. She immediately ran downstairs, looking for Holden, and told her husband she thought she remembered seeing Dusty dead. Holden, trying to protect his wife, told her that it was impossible for her to have seen Dusty that night because she had been in a hospital bed, recovering from her overdose. Holden told Lily to get dressed so he could take her to the doctor to make sure she was all right, but before they left, he asked her to promise that she would try to forget about that night and move forward. Holden feared she might remember something awful about Dusty's murder. \n\n\nPaul arrived at the Oakdale Police Station to give a statement against Rosanna, but he learned from Margo that Rosanna had confessed. Margo told Paul that Rosanna had admitted everything. Rosanna asked for time alone with Paul, and she told him that she had been honest about everything and hoped that Paul would accept what she had done and try to forgive her. Paul explained that he'd had the best of intentions when he had taken her back to Oakdale, but he couldn't move past what she had done. As Rosanna reacted by yelling at him for his affair with Meg, Margo returned and took Rosanna down to be booked for her crimes. Paul thanked Rosanna for helping him to see that he needed to get his priorities straight. He left to find Meg. \n\n\nPaul went to the farm and banged on the front door, looking for Meg. She told him she didn't want to see him, but he refused to leave until she heard what he had to say. Paul said that the two could be happy since Rosanna had confessed everything, but Meg pointed out that what he really wanted was for Craig to pay for his crimes. Paul claimed he just wanted her, but Meg told him all she really wanted was her baby back. Paul said they could try again for another baby, but Meg said that wouldn't happen because he would always be looking for revenge against the people who had hurt him. \n\n\nMeg went on to explain that she could have pressed charges against Rosanna and Craig but had only wanted everything to be over so she could move on -- something he refused to do. Paul tried to convince Meg to give their relationship another try, but Meg told him it was too late. Paul refused to give up and begged Meg to let him prove that he would do anything to make her love him again. Meg told Paul there was nothing he could do and that her family needed her. She pushed him out the farmhouse door. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Lily told her doctor she was feeling much better but was starting to recall events from the night of Dusty's murder. He told her to give it time, but she explained that she wanted to know what had happened, even though Holden didn't want her to remember. The doctor agreed to talk to Holden, and when they went into the hall, she excused herself while the doctor and Holden talked. \n\n\nHolden told the doctor that he didn't think Lily needed to get her memory of that night back, but the doctor said that she might need to process the memories to get past them. He suggested that Lily return to rehab, but Holden refused, saying he wanted Lily home with him and his family. The doctor asked Holden if he could really watch her 24 hours a day and then emphasized his point by asking Holden where Lily was at that moment. Holden said he would find her and set off looking for Lily. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Lily had returned to the site of Dusty's murder to try to trigger her memories of that fateful night. Lily arrived at Bob's office and recalled seeing Dusty dead on the floor. She sat on the floor of the office and remembered finding the syringe by Dusty's body. Meg arrived at the hospital and asked Holden what the doctor had said. He told her everything the doctor had said and asked his sister to help him find Lily. \n\n\nHolden found Lily in the stairwell and asked her if she was all right. Seeing Holden in the stairs reminded Lily of the night he had found her passed out, and she told him she remembered. Lily said that she knew what had happened the night of Dusty's death and that she understood why he hadn't told the police everything about that night -- because she would have been the suspect. \n\n\nAfter his meeting with Meg, Paul returned to his room at the Lakeview and poured himself a drink. He fell asleep and dreamed that Rosanna was by his side. Paul questioned how she had gotten out of jail, but Rosanna said he would know soon enough. She explained she only wanted to say goodbye and explain herself. She told Paul that she loved him and that she had known he had loved Meg, but she had done everything she had been able to do to hold on to him. She told him she was sorry for causing him pain, but she had been desperate to keep him. She finished by telling Paul she would wait for him if he ever decided he could love her, and then she vanished as quickly as she had appeared. \n\n\nPaul hurried to the station, demanding to know why Rosanna had been released. Margo took Paul into a private room and told him that when she had checked on Rosanna, she had found her passed out in her cell. She told him that Rosanna had suffered a relapse, and she was back in the hospital. Paul went to Memorial and talked to Rosanna's doctor about her condition. He learned from her doctor that she had slipped back into a coma that had most likely been caused by trauma or stress. The doctor went on to explain that she might never emerge from it. \n\n\nPaul was upset by the diagnosis and the doctor's suggestion that Rosanna be sent back to Switzerland. Paul sat at Rosanna's side and marveled at the way she had appeared to him in a dream to say goodbye. He realized that he destroyed everyone he loved and feared that he might be destined to spend his life alone. He went into the hall and saw Meg there, but she turned and walked away.  \n\n\n",

Paul sleeps and dreams that Rosanna tells him she will always love him and if he ever loves her again she will be waiting for him. Margo later tells Paul what happened to Rosanna, and the doctors at the hospital want to send her back to the clinic in Switzerland. Paul asks Meg for another chance to be happy with her, and she tells him no because she can't be with him, since he only wants revenge and won't let the past go. Dusty leaves Allison a college scholarship in his will, and she wants to take advantage of the opportunity in honor of Dusty. Dusty leaves Emily The Intruder, but she refuses to take it because she doesn't want to profit from Dusty's death. Lily remembers that she was in the hospital lab kneeling next to Dusty's dead body, and she picked up the syringe which was on the floor and held it in her hand. Lily finally figures out that Holden has been covering for her because he thinks she killed Dusty.",
