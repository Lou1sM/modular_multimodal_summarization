Paul called Meg and asked for time with their daughter, but Meg told him it was not a good day for a visit. She was hesitant to leave Eliza with him because she was unsure how Paul would take the news that she and Dusty were married. Dusty told Meg she never needed to see Paul again if she didn't wish to, and he would arrange for a safe visit with the baby. \n\n\nJade came home to Lily's and talked with Luke. She was concerned about sponging off Lily, so Luke suggested she either go back to school or find a job. Jade was also sad that Derek seemed to have no interest in getting to know her as his daughter. They looked on the Internet for available jobs in the area, and one popped up for a publisher's assistant. The two of them got excited over that one until Luke realized the job was Casey's old one with Emily at the Intruder. He explained that Casey and Emily had gotten married, and that it had ended badly. Jade was undaunted by Luke's caveats, however, and mentioned that she hoped Alison would give her a good recommendation. She filled out the online application. \n\n\nCasey looked for Alison at Memorial and invited her to go to Chicago for a night on the town. Alison complained that they had talked about having some sort of relationship other than friendship, but she assured him that was not going to happen. Alison pushed for friendship, but Casey was convinced there was a spark between them that needed further fuel. Alison flashed back on Emily's plea to her to stay away from Casey. Casey was bewildered what reason Alison might have for not wanting to explore the possibilities of a relationship with him, and he fixated on the whole Hughes/Stewart dynamic. Then he realized that Alison's reluctance probably traced directly back to Emily. Alison would not confirm that, and she hurt his feelings by bringing up his treatment of Maddie. Casey got angry and left to confront Emily. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul was surprised to see Dusty walk in carrying baby Eliza in her car seat. Dusty said Meg did not want to see Paul anymore, so he had brought the baby for a supervised visit with her father. Paul vowed that Dusty would never come between him and Meg, and Dusty responded by saying he already had. He dropped the bombshell that he and Meg had married in Reno, so she was his wife. Paul did not believe him, so Dusty explained that the divorce had come through and the marriage was a done deal, and Paul had better get used to it. Paul tried to phone Meg for confirmation, but she did not answer. Dusty then laid down the visitation rules for Paul: he could not see Eliza alone; Dusty had to be there. Additionally, Paul could have no contact with Meg directly. Paul ordered Dusty to put down the baby immediately, but instead Dusty handed the baby to him. Paul then ordered him out of the house. Dusty called him a \"freakin' lunatic,\" and picked up the phone to call the police. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Meg met with the realtor and made appointments to see some houses. The realtor called her \"Mrs. Donovan\" as Josie walked in. A stunned Josie questioned Meg about the name, and Meg explained about her recent wedding to Dusty. She tried to tell the girl that Dusty had no other options, but Josie did not agree. She was incensed that Dusty was the one telling Paul about the marriage, and called Meg a coward. \n\n\nJade went to the Intruder office and found a frazzled Emily. While interviewing Jade, Emily took a call from a reporter who displeased her, so while she was chewing him out, her other line rang. Jade stepped up and answered the call and took a message. Unfortunately, she did not get a call back number, so Emily lit into her until the two of them were reduced to simultaneous yelling. Emily fired Jade, who claimed she had not yet been hired! Jade stalked out after pointing out the caller ID number on the phone. An irate Casey passed her in the corridor on his way into Emily's office, so Jade sneaked back to listen. The first things she heard were Casey's challenge to Emily and his asking why the hell she was screwing up his life. \n\n\nJosie walked into Fairwinds and asked Dusty to put down his phone. The three of them argued, and Josie pleaded with Paul to return the baby to Dusty or the authorities would intervene. Paul handed Eliza to Josie, who, in turn, gave her to Dusty. Josie \"congratulated\" Dusty on his marriage and went back to comfort Paul. Dusty left with Eliza, as Paul told Josie she was not the first girl Dusty had used and dumped. Josie called the two of them \"losers,\" but that upset Paul. He said he was not going to let Dusty get away with what he had done, but he would share no details with Josie. Paul vowed when he was through with Dusty, Dusty wouldn't know what had hit him. \n\n\nLuke approached Alison and asked her to put in a good word for Jade to Emily. Alison said she and Emily were on the outs, so perhaps her speaking up was not a good idea. Luke correctly guessed that the sisters were arguing about Casey and suggested she do what she felt like doing with his friend. \n\n\nOutside Emily's office, Jade continued to listen to Casey argue with Emily. He accused her of being jealous of his relationship with Alison. Emily sarcastically said if he was really considering going into family therapy as a career, he might want to finish college first. Casey told her to go to hell and stay out of his life. As Casey exited, he spotted Jade, and they had a short conversation. Emily came out and asked Jade how she knew Casey. The girl explained that Casey had saved her life not long before at Metro. Emily offered to pay Jade to go out with Casey! To be more specific, she said she wanted Jade not to just go after Casey, but to catch him. Jade was outraged because she thought Emily was suggesting she sleep with Casey, so Emily more clearly explained the job description and tripled the salary. Emily said she wanted Jade to keep Casey occupied and far away from her sister, Alison. Jade questioned whether Casey would even be interested in her and told Emily she would get back to her with an answer. \n\n\nAlison and Luke went out on the hospital roof, and Luke urged her to keep trying for that perfect guy. He asked her to come back in half an hour and promised that Casey would be there. Luke left, as Alison waited in the cold. \n\n\nDusty took Eliza back to the farm, and Meg asked how badly Paul had taken the news that Meg was married to him. Dusty said Paul was not thrilled, and then he mentioned that Josie had shown up, as well. Meg was concerned about Josie, but Dusty felt she would get over it. He also told her Paul was upset that Dusty would not leave him alone with the baby, and said he was glad Meg had not been involved. \n\n\nJade went to Java, where she saw Casey through the window. She took a call from Luke and told him the job interview had been interesting. She said she hadn't gotten the assistant's job, but Emily had offered her a \"special projects\" position. She wasn't sure yet if she would accept it. Luke was looking for Casey, and when Jade told him she was looking at him, Luke asked her to tell him to get to the roof of the hospital immediately. Jade asked why, so Luke explained that Casey and Alison needed to get past some issues. Jade pretended to embrace Luke's scheme, and he thanked her. Jade went into Java and sat with Casey, but she failed to pass on Luke's message. Jade told him not to dump on himself because he certainly looked good to her. When Casey went to get a latte, Jade called Emily and accepted the job, telling her boss she had already started work.\n\n\n",

Dusty tells Meg that he will go in her place so she doesn't have to deal with Paul in order for him to have a relationship with his daughter. Dusty shows up at Paul's with Eliza and Paul doesn't react well and is even more angry when he finds out that Meg and he got married. Meanwhile, Josie finds out by accident about Dusty and Meg's marriage and doesn't react well either when Meg admits that Dusty is breaking the news to Paul about them. Josie points out that Meg has come between her and Dusty and he chose her; she is convinced that both Dusty and Paul are obsessed with her. Dusty lays down the ground rules with Paul, which incites him. When Dusty finally hands over Eliza, Paul orders him out of his house. Dusty threatens to call the police until Josie shows up and talks everyone down. Meg learns of Paul's displeasure in her new marriage, as Josie soon learns that Paul is not going to take this lying down; Dusty won't know what hit him when he is done with him, Paul promises. Casey tries to make plans for dinner and dancing with Allison, but she tells him that she is not interested. Casey wants to know what is stopping her. Finally, he figures out it has to do with Emily, as Allison admits that Emily wants them to keep their distance. Casey is furious and tells Allison that he won't stand for that, as he storms off. Luke wants Jade to stay in town when he learns she is down because she doesn't want to be around Derek. They look online for a job for her and they come across Emily's listing. Luke warns her, but Jade is up for it. Jade and Emily speak, but soon Emily is berating Jade for something she didn't do when she answered her phone and she orders her out of her office. Casey shows up loaded for bear at Emily, as they have it out. Jade overhears and Emily notices that Casey and Jade are somewhat close. She tries to entice Jade to take a job with her \u0096 one that keeps Casey away from her sister and with Jade instead. Jade sees she has Emily over a barrel and tells Emily that she will let her know. Luke and Allison talk about her fears about getting into a relationship. He thinks she has nothing to lose if she throws caution to the wind and dates Casey; he thinks he might be the right person for her. Allison is unsure, but Luke takes the same tactic as hers when she and Casey locked Noah and he on the roof. He instructs her to wait while he finds Casey to meet her on the roof. Casey calls Jade to find out about the job interview, which she dodges. He asks her to find Casey and send him to the roof to meet with Allison. Instead, Jade talks to Casey about how good of a guy he is and if Allison doesn't see that then maybe he should cut his losses. She asks him to have coffee with her instead of delivering the message. When Casey gets the coffee, Jade calls Emily and accepts the \u0091job'. Emily asks when she will start. Jade tells her that she already has.",
