He was just trying to get caught up on what he had missed.  Holden rushed in and told Jack that he needed Jack's help because Lily was in big trouble.  He explained what had happened with former Officer Grady, but Jack said that Holden's story had no evidence to back it up.  Besides, said Jack, he was not officially on duty yet, but he did offer to call the local police near where Lily and Damian were staying to handle it.  He warned his cousin, however, not to go off like a vigilante after Damian.  Holden turned around and ran out of the station, as Jack picked up his phone.\n\n\nAt the farm, Liberty took in the mail and found a letter to her from the Fashion Institute.  She threw it into the trash without opening it, but then thought better of it and plucked the envelope out of the can.  She read the letter and snarled, \"Perfect!\" and crumbled the letter and stuffed it into her pocket.  Janet walked downstairs then and asked if Liberty was ready to leave for her appointment with Dr. Hern.  Liberty said she wanted to see Parker instead, but Janet insisted that they keep the appointment.\n\n\nJanet reminded her daughter that they were leaving for New York City the next day.  Liberty said she thought the visits to the New York doctors were a waste of time since she was probably dying anyway.  That upset Janet, who asked the girl to be more optimistic.  She said the trip was definitely worth it if it gave Liberty her life back.\n\n\nLiberty asked why Dusty was not gong with them since he had made all the arrangements, and Janet said that it was supposed to be a family trip.  She reminded her daughter that Jack was in that family, and he would be going with them.  Liberty mused why Dusty had gone to such trouble for them, and Janet said that he was her boss, but Jack was her husband.  She advised Liberty to \"keep the lines clear.\"\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, Jack was late, so Dr. Hern talked with Liberty and Janet.  He suggested that Liberty undergo chemotherapy, as it was the most aggressive form of treatment.  Jack arrived and Liberty caught him up on what he had missed.  She said she would be bald in three months, just in time for the prom.  She made other caustic comments, but the doctor was not offended.  He told Liberty to \"stay feisty,\" because cancer cells hated it.  He also encouraged them to keep the New York appointments and wished them well.  Liberty left to take a walk, and Jack pulled Janet out of the room and dragged her home.\n\n\nCarly was drawing at home, but none of her designs pleased her.  Molly dropped in unexpectedly, and Carly was grateful for the interruption.  Molly was depressed, and Carly said that she bet she could top her cousin in a lousy day competition.  Molly agreed to play the \"Whose Life Sucks More?\" game with Carly, with chocolate chip cookies to the winner.  They got cups of tea and sat on the couch, and Molly began her tale of woe.\n\n\nMolly told her cousin that she had moved into Holden's room at the farm just a week before, and they had been talking about getting a place of their own.  Then she talked about Holden's suggestion that they both visit Abigail in California, but Molly said that no matter how wonderful Holden was, she was a \"two-faced, self-serving witch.\"  She told Carly that she had found out something very bad about Damian, but she had not told Holden.  Molly went on to say that she thought the news would split up Damian and Lily and pave the way for Lily and Holden to get back together.  She felt so guilty about the secret that she finally told Holden everything, and it infuriated and disgusted him.  Holden was on his way to tell Lily the whole sordid story.\n\n\nCarly thought she could still win the \"Life Sucks\" game, so she began her sad story.  She said that she and Jack had met by chance at the lake where the old boathouse had stood, and \"the passion was still there.\"  Carly went on to say that while they were kissing at the lake, Liberty was in Memorial Hospital finding out that she had leukemia.  That, of course, had ended Carly's chance with Jack.  Molly graciously said that Carly won the prize, and then, Carly added the clincher: she had also had one sip of beer at the lake, but only one.  The two made a pact to honor the premise that work was the new love, and Carly's doorbell rang.\n\n\nLiberty was at the door, and was looking for Parker.  Carly said he had gone to school that day, crutches and all, and she invited the girl in for a cup of tea.  Liberty said that she was tired of having people treat her differently because she didn't feel sick.  Molly said her goodbyes and left, so Carly suggested that she and Liberty work on the portfolio the girl needed for FIT.   She warned Liberty that she mustn't let cancer stop her from living her life.\n\n\nLiberty reported that she had asked for an extension on her portfolio from the school, but they had turned her down.  She also told Carly that she had burned the few sketches she had finished while she was angry in Detroit.  Then Liberty noticed the crumpled sketches of Carly's on the floor and picked them up to look at them.  She offered some constructive criticism, and instead of being irritated, Carly handed the girl a sketchpad and a pencil and asked Liberty to show Carly what she had.\n\n\nBack at the farm, Jack tried to tempt Janet with his pancakes, and he did get her to eat a little.  Janet was pondering all the things she might have done differently in raising Liberty that might have warded off the cancer.  Jack said the only thing that Janet should be thinking of was getting Liberty well.  His phone rang, and he was willing to let it go to voicemail, but Janet saw that it was from Carly, and she urged him to take it.  Carly said that Liberty was with her, and she urged both of them to join them right away.\n\n\nAt Carly's, Janet and Jack arrived, worried, but Liberty said that for once she had some good news: Carly had offered her a job at Monte Carlo.  Carly confirmed that she was reviving her old design company, and Liberty was excited to be her assistant.  Janet thanked Carly, but she said they would be \"turning down the offer.\"  Her argument was that with school full-time and then a job and dealing with her cancer, it was too much for Liberty.  Liberty declared that she wasn't dead yet, and she still had a few sketches left in her.\n\n\nJack took Carly aside and asked about Monte Carlo.  Carly said that Craig had suggested that they work together again, and Jack was not surprised.  Janet continued to nix the idea, but Liberty protested that it was her call.  She demanded to have \"a life outside of being sick,\" and she stood up and ran out.  Janet then verbally attacked Carly, who defended herself by saying that Liberty had knocked on her door while she was looking for Parker because she was upset about her rejection letter from the institute.\n\n\nJanet had no idea what Carly was talking about, and she warned her \"to stay the hell out\" of her daughter's life.  Janet went out, slamming the door behind her.  Carly defended herself and told Jack that Liberty was actually quite talented.  Jack tried to get Carly to see Janet's point of view, however, and he said that he also felt the job would not be good for Liberty if Craig was involved.  He mentioned that they were leaving for New York in the morning, thanks to Dusty, and Carly said, \"Ah, Dusty.  Go figure.\"\n\n\n Jack asked what that meant, and Carly assumed a knowing look and commented that Dusty surely wasn't doing it for Jack.  Jack didn't catch the innuendo and said that Dusty was very fond of Liberty.  He wished Carly good luck on Monte Carlo, if it was something she loved, and Carly said that she did.  She went on to say that there was no point in doing something without love.\n\n\nOn the porch, Liberty told her mother that she knew Janet was scared for her, but she wanted more in her life than just chemo and surviving.  She wanted something to hang on to that she enjoyed, and she walked away.  Jack joined Janet on the porch, and she hugged him in desperation, as Carly watched from inside.\n\n\nIn his hotel room, Damian attempted to revive Meg, whom he had strangled, but he was unsuccessful.  He began shouting at her to wake up, as he heard Lily approaching in the hall.  Damian put on his shirt and intercepted Lily at the door, and asked where she had been.  Lily said she had taken a walk to clear her head, and Damian said he suddenly was craving a cognac, and he suggested that they go to the bar and have a drink.  Lily tried to go into the room, but Damian blocked her.\n\n\nFinally, Lily told Damian that he was acting strangely, but Damian justified everything and let his wife into the room.  The bed was empty, and Lily kidded her husband about having another woman in the room.  Lily did not notice that part of Meg's clothing was sticking out from an old steamer trunk at the foot of the bed.  She and Damian sat on the bed, and Lily apologized for overreacting at Damian's suggestion of a spontaneous trip to Malta.  She said that she just couldn't do things on the spur of the moment with young children.\n\n\nDamian hustled Lily out of the room and said he would meet her in the bar.  He said he had packed all their belongings already, but Lily reminded him of two sweaters that she had put in the trunk.  She got up and started towards the trunk, but Damian stopped her.  Lily was suspicious, but Damian said that he would join her by the fireplace in the bar in ten minutes.  He promised to pack everything, so Lily walked out.  Damian ran into the bathroom to take down the shower curtain, as Lily sneaked back into the room.\n\n\nLily walked to the steamer trunk and was about to open it when Damian appeared with the shower curtain.  He claimed it had fallen down, and he said he was almost finished packing.  Lily was annoyed and raised her voice, demanding to know what was in the trunk.  She lifted the lid and saw Meg's body inside.  Lily tried to scream, but Damian clamped his hand over her mouth.  Lily was close to hysteria, as Damian held up Meg's syringe and claimed that she had attacked him and caused him to have to fight for his life.\n\n\nA stunned Lily wanted to know how Damian had killed Meg, and then she guessed that he had strangled her.  She was horrified that Damian would never have told her about Meg if Lily hadn't returned to their room.  Damian still swore that it had been Meg's life or his, but Lily wanted to call the police.  She said if Damian had killed Meg in self-defense, then he had nothing to worry about.  Damian said that he couldn't take the risk, and he got furious and accused Lily of not believing him.\n\n\nLily said that Damian was in shock and just wasn't thinking clearly.  She reminded him that Meg had escaped from a psych hospital and had deliberately lain in wait for him with a hypodermic full of poison.  Damian announced that the discussion was over, and they were leaving.  Lily took out her phone, but Damian grabbed it and hurled it against a wall.  He assured Lily that she had nothing to fear from him, but they were not calling the police.  Lily couldn't believe that her husband thought they could go back to Oakdale and resume their lives, but that was not Damian's plan.  He said they were flying directly to Malta and would send for the children later.\n\n\nLily said that was not acceptable, and running away was the worst thing they could do.  A crazed Damian said it was their only option, and he forced Lily to the door.  He pulled her out into the hall where they ran face-to-face into Holden.\n\n\nHolden confronted Damian and said that he knew all about Grady and the faked DNA report, and then he informed Lily that Meg had been right all along.  Damian told Holden to get out of the way, but Holden said they were not going anywhere.  Lily asked what was going on, so Holden related how Damian had paid off Officer Grady to lie about the DNA of the body in Holden's truck.  He went on about Damian's romantic promises to Meg in order to keep her silent. Damian interrupted and said that Holden could never prove any of that.\n\n\nDamian yelled at Lily that everything he had done had been for the two of them.  Lily got hysterical again, as Holden told Damian that his \"reign of terror\" was over. He said the sheriff's department was on its way, but Damian yelled, \"The hell it is!\"  Damian pulled a revolver from his pocket and aimed it directly at Holden.  Lily screamed at Holden that Meg had escaped from Deerbrook and had followed them to their hotel.\n\n\nDamian ordered Holden to move, but Lily continued to beg Damian to tell Holden about his sister.  Lily said that Meg had attacked Damian and was inside their room, but Damian had tried to cover it up.  She said Meg's body was in the trunk, and Holden lunged for the gun.  He and Damian struggled, and Holden yelled to Lily to call the cops.  Damian got control of the gun and Holden, and he told Lily that he would kill Holden if Lily left.  Holden called out to Lily to run, but she argued with Damian instead.\n\n\nDamian herded them into the room, where Holden called out for Meg.  Damian told him to save his breath, and Holden vowed that Damian would never get away.  Lily said she wasn't going anywhere with Damian, but he ordered Holden to step on to the shower curtain.  Damian said Holden and Meg would be found together, as a terrified and helpless Lily looked on.\n\n\n",
