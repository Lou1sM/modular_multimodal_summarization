Gwen and Will, meanwhile, had agreed that they needed to set some boundaries for Sofie with regard to visiting Hallie, so Gwen called Sofie and asked if she could stop over to chat. \n\n\nWhen Sofie and Aaron got to Will and Gwen's place, they heard the baby crying, and Sofie offered to get her. Will stopped her but let Aaron go instead. Sofie asked why he hadn't let her go to the baby, and Gwen explained that she and Will thought Sofie had been getting a little too attached to Hallie. Sofie asked what she had done wrong. Gwen said Sofie could still see Hallie but that there had to be some boundaries. \n\n\nSofie protested, \"But she's my daughter!\" and then said that hadn't been what she'd meant to say. Will told her they just wanted to put a little space between Sofie and the baby for the time being. Gwen said she hadn't realized how hard it would be on Sofie and that she had never meant to hurt her. Sofie responded, \"It's too late.\" \n\n\nAaron took Hallie out into the living room, and Sofie asked if she could say goodbye to her. Sofie told Hallie she wouldn't be seeing her for a little while, \"and you're not even gonna notice I'm not here.\" Crying, Sofie left. Aaron followed after Sofie. Gwen told Will, \"That was hard,\" and said that she felt like she had betrayed Sofie. \n\n\nAt Old Town again, Sofie said she had thought she could do it, but she hadn't known that saying goodbye would be like giving up her little girl all over again. Aaron told Sofie he'd walk her back to the Lakeview, but Sofie said she was okay and told Aaron that his family needed him. She got up and left.\n\n\nTom went to the police station and told Margo to take the rest of the day off and go home with him. Once home, she was surprised and thrilled to see Casey, who had been released from prison early for good behavior. Margo hugged him and then playfully slapped him, telling him that was for having gotten into a fight with a prison guard. She asked Casey what had happened, and Casey said he was not ready for an interrogation already. \n\n\nIn Bob's hospital room, Chris told Kim there was no change in Bob's condition. Chris left, and Kim took Bob's hand and told him she was ready for him to wake up again because it was hard putting up such a brave front for the family. Just as she turned to leave, Bob reached out and grabbed her hand, startling her. She looked at him, and he opened his eyes and said haltingly, \"Hello...beautiful.\" She whispered, \"Hello, handsome!\" and told him she had to go get Chris. \n\n\nChris bumped into Evan Walsh outside Bob's room. Evan pulled Chris into a private office and shoved the contract for Memo-21 in front of him, telling him to sign it. Chris was hesitant because of the whole situation with Dusty's death, but Evan told him to sign it anyway because Chris had promised Evan the deal would go through. Chris signed the contract.\n\n\nBack in the hallway, Kim told Chris his dad was awake, and they went back into Bob's room, where Chris asked his dad how he was feeling. Bob replied, \"I'm hungry!\" Chris took a nurse into the room and ordered some tests for Bob. Kim asked if it was really necessary to run tests right away, but Chris said he just needed to see where they stood, and Bob added that he would order the same tests himself. Kim left to call the family and let them know Bob was awake, and Chris sat with Bob and said how glad he was that Bob was back with them. Bob asked, \"Where's Dusty?\" Chris, not sure what to say, replied, \"He's gone.\"\n\n\nTom, Margo, and Casey finished eating, and then Margo asked Casey what he was going to do with his life. Casey was upset that Margo was already pushing him to make decisions like that when he had just gotten out of prison. Tom agreed and said they had plenty of time to figure things out. The phone rang. It was Kim, who said, \"Tommy, I have the most wonderful news in the world! Your father is awake, and he's talking!\" \n\n\nTom, Margo, and Casey all went to the hospital, where Bob jokingly pretended not to know who Tom was. Bob was happy to see Casey and welcomed him back.\n\n\nEmily stopped by the room where Dusty had been murdered. Ignoring the crime scene tape, she went in and knelt down by the spot where Dusty's body had been found. Talking to herself, Emily said, \"I need to make peace with what happened, with what I did that night,\" and then crying softly, she said, \"I'm so sorry!\"\n\n\nIn the hospital stairwell, Lily realized that Holden thought she had killed Dusty and that he had been trying to cover for her. She told Holden he couldn't try to protect her that way, but Holden said he owed it to her. He told her that before Dusty had died, he had told Holden some truths about the way Holden had been treating Lily, and Holden felt like he had driven Lily into Dusty's arms. \n\n\nHolden asked Lily if she remembered where she had found the syringe the night Dusty had died. Lily had a flashback of having seen Dusty lying on the floor, with the syringe next to his body. She told Holden and said she had picked up the syringe then, but she hadn't killed Dusty. \n\n\nLily took Holden to the crime scene, to see if that would jog her memory further, and when they got there, they saw Emily rushing out the door. Lily asked what Emily was doing there, but Emily told Lily it was none of her business. Emily asked Holden if he had really been arrested and if he'd actually had the murder weapon at his house. Lily said it was all a mistake and that Holden hadn't killed Dusty. Holden told Emily that he was sorry about what had happened to Dusty because he knew Emily and Dusty had been close. Emily said Dusty had hurt a lot of people, \"and I'm sorry you were one of them.\" Emily left, and Holden wondered why she had been acting so strangely. \n\n\nLily and Holden ducked under the crime scene tape, and Lily remembered having seen Emily leave the room just before she had gotten there the night Dusty had been killed. Lily told Holden that Emily had most likely killed Dusty. Holden asked why, and Lily said it had been because of her. She told Holden about Dusty breaking things off with her because he had still been in love with Emily. Lily told Holden that she had gone to a bar and met one of Cheri Love's \"girls,\" who had told her that Emily had once been a prostitute. \n\n\nHolden didn't believe it, but Lily said when she had gone to tell Dusty about it, he had said he had already known. Lily said she had been so upset that she had decided to write an anonymous note to Chris Hughes and tell him about Emily's past. When Chris and Emily had read the note, Emily had assumed it had been Dusty who had written it and had blamed him for it, and Lily had let Emily and Chris go on believing that. Lily said Dusty's death was her fault, because she had \"set things in motion.\" \n\n\nHolden said he should have known Lily couldn't have killed Dusty, because he knew Lily better than that. Lily said they needed to call Jack, because he'd believe her about having seen Emily leaving the crime scene the night Dusty had been murdered. She offered her hand to Holden, and he took it. They left together, and Holden put his arm around Lily as they walked out.\n\n\nEmily ran into Chris and told him she had heard that Bob was awake, and she wanted to know how he was doing. Chris took Emily into an empty office and told her it was not her business anymore, but she reminded him that Bob was Daniel's grandfather, so she had a right to know. She told Chris he didn't seem too happy, and he told her one of the first things Bob had asked was where Dusty was; Emily asked what he had told Bob, and Chris said he had just said that Dusty was gone. He walked out of the office, and Emily saw Tom and told him she'd call Daniel at school and let him know his grandfather was doing better. Tom thanked her, and she left.\n\n\nEmily again ran into Chris, and she said they needed to get their stories straight. Chris said he didn't have a story, but Emily said, \"Dusty died believing you poisoned your father and caused his stroke; that sounds like a story to me.\" Chris couldn't believe that Emily would believe he could poison his own father, and Emily couldn't believe Chris would think she could kill Dusty, so Chris said they were at a stalemate. Chris told Emily, \"Keep your mouth shut, and nobody else will get hurt.\" \n\n\nTom found Kim and told her he had reached both Lisa and Nancy, and they would both be there soon to see Bob. Margo suggested to Casey that he go and visit Will and Gwen. Casey said his friends probably wouldn't want to see him, but Margo reminded him that if anyone could relate to Casey's situation, it was Will. After Casey left, Tom told Margo that maybe she should give Casey a break and let him adjust at his own pace to being out of prison. Casey went to Will and Gwen's house. When he got there, he glanced in the window and saw them with the baby.\n\n\n",

Lily remembers that she found the syringe next to Dusty's dead body and then took the syringe and ran away. Lily also remembers that before she went into the lab she saw Emily running out of the lab.
