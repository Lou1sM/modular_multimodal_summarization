Josie reminded him that Dusty did not put a gun to Meg's head to get her to marry him; Meg had entered into the marriage of her own volition. Josie said she was not upset about the marriage because she was sure it would not last. She mentioned the custody hearing for Johnny, which was scheduled in a couple of hours, and said that was why Dusty and Meg had tied the knot so suddenly. Paul chuckled and accused her of trying to keep him from going after Dusty. Paul took a call, which prompted him into action. \n\n\nCarly came home and found Craig nursing a giant hangover on her porch. He said he was not there to rehash any unpleasantness, but rather to apologize. He regretted that he had said things out of anger at the faux wedding. He told her he was on his way to Johnny's custody hearing and wanted her to be a character witness for him. All he wanted her to do was tell the judge that he would be a better father to Johnny than Dusty. Carly was reluctant and called Craig insane. She reminded him that Tom Hughes would have a field day impeaching her credibility in court. Craig urged her to simply say he would be a good father, but Carly suggested he just be himself at the hearing and tell the judge how much he loved the boy. When he asked Carly if she thought he really was the best person to be raising Johnny, she hesitated, and Craig walked out. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Johnny and Dusty came to see Meg. Emma ignored Dusty but was pleasant to the boy, and did offer to watch him while the adults were at court. Meg said Lily and Faith were coming to watch baby Eliza, and Dusty was excited that after the hearing, no one could take away his son. Meg promised again to do whatever she could to help Dusty. \n\n\nLater at court, Dusty told Tom that Meg was his wife of two days. Tom was not overjoyed, and mentioned that Craig had attempted a similar maneuver with Carly, but had not pulled it off. In another room, Craig talked with his lawyer but did not like what he heard. He fired the man on the spot, just as Carly walked in. She apologized for letting him think she did not feel he would be a good parent. She said she was there for moral support for him. They walked into the courtroom and ran into Meg and Dusty. The two men glared at each other, but did not speak. Craig went to Tom and spoke to him, likening his present to what Tom had gone through raising Hal's son, Adam. Being Craig, however, he had to enhance his remarks with the comment that because of how Adam turned out, perhaps he would have been better off with his birth father. \n\n\nMeg spoke briefly to Carly, who said she assumed Meg was there to support Dusty. Meg said it was a bit more than just that; she and Dusty were married. Carly was stunned. \n\n\nJosie arrived and warned Dusty that Paul might show up and try to disrupt the hearing in order to teach Dusty a lesson. Dusty felt there was nothing Paul could do, but the arrival of the judge ended any further conversation. The judge asked Craig why he was without counsel, and Craig answered that he had released his attorney recently. Next the judge asked him why he had brought the court action, so Craig explained that because he had been unjustifiably imprisoned for something he had not done, he had nonetheless missed a significant portion of his biological son's life. He made a plea for custody, saying he felt the boy was better off with him. \n\n\nTom spoke on behalf of Dusty, citing the desire of Johnny's mother that her husband raise the boy. He further mentioned the possibility of Craig's being a flight risk because of his history and requested that the court revoke Craig's visitation privileges. The judge asked what Dusty could provide that Craig could not, and Tom replied that Dusty could give Johnny a stable home environment. Craig blurted out that Dusty was a single man living in a hotel, but Tom countered by telling the court that Mr. Donovan had recently married Meg Snyder in Reno. Craig was shocked and called out to Meg, \"You're his wife?\" To everyone's amazement, Paul burst into the room, shouting, \"No, she's not!\" Paul continued by saying that Dusty and Meg were not legally married, and he waved a file folder at the judge. Craig snickered. \n\n\nAfter an exhausting night of potential baby-making, Katie and Brad went to WOAK to speak to Kim. They told her they wanted her to reinstate their program, \"Oakdale Now,\" and to hire them both back. Kim seemed favorable to having Katie back, but she told Brad that unfortunately, his job was no longer available. She acknowledged that the chemistry between the two of them had always been a draw, but Brad was just more trouble than he was worth to the station. Brad got put out, and walked away. Katie apologized and mentioned they were tired because they had been trying to have a baby. That sparked Kim's interest, and she mentioned that Brad and Katie had met on the show, had fallen in love on the show, and had even been married on the show. What could be better than a follow-up on the show about a pregnancy? She suggested a reality show starring the two of them documenting the whole pregnancy and birth process. Katie was excited and made Kim promise that if the show was successful, Kim would give Brad his old job back. \n\n\nBack in court, the judge asked Paul to identify himself, and Dusty spoke up and asked the judge to remove Paul, who had a history of mental instability and illness. Meg asked Paul to leave, but Paul waved his file and shouted he had proof. \n\n\nTom objected that Dusty's marriage was not the subject of the proceedings, but the judge said if Dusty claimed to have a two-parent household, then the validity of his marriage was very much an issue. He asked to see the file, so Paul produced it. It contained his and Meg's divorce papers, Meg's marriage certificate to Dusty from Reno, and a false record showing Meg as a Nevada resident even before Eliza was born. Paul maintained the divorce was not legal since Meg was in Oakdale, not Nevada, so therefore, Meg was still his wife. \n\n\nDusty claimed he and Meg thought all the paperwork was in order, but if there were a glitch, they would simply repeat the ceremony. The judge asked Meg if she wanted to end her marriage to Paul and begin one with Dusty, and she answered in the affirmative. She gave a little speech about how content she and her baby were with Dusty. Paul began to lose control, so the judge ordered him out of the courtroom. Paul saw Josie standing in the back, so he pointed at her and shouted, \"Ask her!\" \n\n\nThe judge called Josie to the stand and allowed Craig to act as his own attorney and question her. He asked about her relationship with Dusty and got her to admit that she had more than just friendship feelings for him. He explored that some more and then finally asked if Dusty had told her why he was marrying Meg. She answered that he said it was to prove to the court that he could provide a stable family for Johnny. \n\n\nDusty stood up and brought up all of Craig's past mistakes and malfeasances with his other children until the judge asked him to be quiet. Tom declined to question Josie, so the judge dismissed her. Dusty stood again and said he could give Johnny a real home, and Craig countered with his own remarks, culminating with shouting at the judge that Dusty had faked his own death. The judge finally had heard enough. \n\n\nKatie went home and found Brad unpacking groceries. She told him she had made a decision that would add an exciting element to their baby-making. Brad got excited for all the wrong reasons, so Katie was just about to explain when the doorbell rang. Brad answered it, and there stood two cameramen from WOAK with cameras rolling in Brad's face. Katie explained about the new show Kim had proposed, and Brad was speechless. He asked Katie if she really wanted to do it, and when she said yes, he agreed. He shoved the camera crew out, however, telling them some parts of the process were definitely private. \n\n\nIn the courtroom, the judge accused Dusty and Meg of attempting to perpetrate a fraud on the court, and said they did so in order to preserve custody of a child on whom Dusty had no biological claim. The judge rescinded the custody arrangement and awarded full custody of John Dustin Donovan to Craig Montgomery, the child's biological father. The judge left, and Dusty went immediately for Craig's throat. Meg and Tom held the two apart until Dusty calmed down. He told Tom he wanted to appeal the decision, but Tom was not hopeful it would be successful. Dusty begged Tom to find a way for Dusty to keep his son, and then he walked out. Paul approached Meg, who told him she could not bear to look at him. She accused him of betraying his sister again, and told him to enjoy telling Barbara that Craig Montgomery was raising her grandson. \n\n\nCarly went home, followed closely by Craig. He thanked her for her support and threatened to kiss her, but she warned him away. \n\n\nLater, at the Lakeview, Dusty asked Josie why she told Paul the reason he had married Meg, and then he told her he had lost the most important thing in his life.\n\n\n",
