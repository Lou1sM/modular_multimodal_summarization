Damian pulled Lily toward the door, and Holden sprang toward them. Just then, Meg popped out of the trunk. \"I'm not dead yet!\" she gasped and loosened the scarf around her neck.\n\n\n       In the confusion, Holden wrestled Damian for the gun. It fell on the floor, and Meg dove for it. She pointed it at Damian, and in a crazed voice, she exclaimed, \"You stuffed me in that trunk!\" Holden implored Meg to hand over the gun, but she said, \"I'm crazy, remember?\" Damian made all sorts of promises to Meg, but she yelled, \"You tried to kill me!\"\n\n\n       Damian stated that there was no chance for Meg and him if she gave Holden the gun. Meg agreed and surrendered the weapon to Holden. Lily jumped on Damian's back, but he flung her off. She hit her head on the trunk as she fell. Holden rushed to Lily, and Damian slipped out the door. Meg chased Damian, and Holden yelled out Meg's name.\n\n\nLily reeled from the bump on her head, and Holden held her. She wanted to pursue Damian and Meg, but Holden insisted that she go to the hospital. Sirens blared in the background, and Molly arrived. As Holden recapped what had happened in the room, he obviously seemed upset with Molly still. He advised Molly to wait for the police while he took Lily to the hospital.\n\n\n       Later, Meg returned to Oakdale and stormed into Damian's vacated hotel room. She grabbed a discarded sweater off the floor and recalled Damian asking her to move in with him. Meg cradled herself on the sofa and wondered how it could have happened to her.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Lily couldn't believe that she and Meg had been so desperate to hold onto Damian. Holden reassured her, and Molly entered to report that the police hadn't found Damian or Meg. Holden and Molly went into the corridor while the doctor examined Lily. Molly wondered if Holden could forgive her for making a desperate decision out of love.\n\n\nHolden raged that Molly's delay in telling the truth had given Damian the chance to almost kill Meg and abscond with Lily. Molly sobbed that she'd been terrified of losing their relationship, and she begged him to give it another chance. Just then, the doctor exited Lily's room and said that Lily wanted to see Holden and Molly.\n\n\nHolden and Molly reentered the room, but Holden left again to take a call. Lily sensed the tension between Molly and Holden, and Molly admitted that she'd let Damian convince her to keep his blackmail secret. Lily didn't blame Molly for falling for Damian's machinations, but Lily didn't understand Molly's insecurity. Molly said she'd feared that Holden would go running back to Lily. \"Guess what? I was right,\" Molly sadly concluded.\n\n\n       At Memorial, Luke broached the crotchety Dr. Oliver about taking Noah's case. Luke promised to put in a good word with Bob and help the doctor pay his legal fees. Dr. Oliver accused Luke of blackmail, but Luke responded that he'd do whatever worked. Dr. Oliver stated that he couldn't be bought or pushed around, which meant that Luke was out of luck.\n\n\n       At home, Noah threw his movie disk across Lily's living room and called Maddie to the house. When she arrived, Noah griped about making movies that he'd never see. Maddie said that if Noah wanted a pity party, he'd dialed the wrong ex. Noah claimed that Luke had alienated the doctor, and Maddie responded that Luke had probably acted out of love.\n\n\nNoah asked Maddie to take him to Memorial to beg for Dr. Oliver's help, and Luke arrived as they headed out. Luke said that appealing to Dr. Oliver was impossible. Noah retorted it was for Luke, but Noah had to try for himself. After Maddie and Noah left, Luke received a call from Damian, who requested that Luke go to the office immediately.\n\n\n       In his office, Damian packed up pouches of jewelry and diamonds. He reviewed a freighter itinerary, and when Luke entered, Damian claimed that there wasn't much time. Damian planned to hop a freighter out of the country. A puzzled Luke questioned Damian, but Damian only said that he couldn't leave without saying goodbye. He requested that Luke take over the company, and Luke wondered what Damian had done to make him go on the run.\n\n\n       Damian said that Luke would hear bad things about his father, but Luke should always remember that Damian had acted out of love for his family. Damian said goodbye in Italian, and Luke replied, \"Dad...be careful.\" Upon hearing the word \"dad,\" Damian turned and hugged Luke tightly. He kissed Luke's cheek and left.\n\n\n       Luke called Holden and reported Damian's bizarre behavior. Luke said that he didn't think he'd see Damian again for a long time. Holden said that he'd explain things later, but Luke needed to meet Lily at the hospital. Holden asked if Damian had stated how he'd leave town, and Luke mentioned the freighter.\n\n\n       At the docks later, Damian stared at the water. He heard Holden call his name. Damian turned and said that Holden just didn't know when to quit. Damian proposed that since Holden had everything, he should just let Damian go. Holden replied that he couldn't do that.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Noah explained to Maddie that the Grimaldi side of Luke might have cost Noah his sight. Just then, Dr. Oliver arrived, and Maddie left. Noah told Dr. Oliver that Noah also disapproved of Luke's tactics, but Noah understood that Luke had acted out of guilt. Noah asked if Dr. Oliver wanted to lash out at Luke or add Noah to the list of success stories.\n\n\n       Dr. Oliver examined Noah again and decided to work with him. Dr. Oliver said that Noah needed to be prepared for disappointment, because there were no guarantees. Dr. Oliver said that his help contained a condition, and it was a deal breaker. \"Keep Mr. Snyder out of my orbit,\" Dr. Oliver insisted.\n\n\n       Later, Luke arrived at the hospital to see Lily and he encountered Noah. Noah announced that Dr. Oliver had agreed to work with Noah. Luke thought it was great, and he said that he'd check in on Lily before taking Noah home. Noah declined the ride and stated that Luke had to get used to spending time apart, because Dr. Oliver didn't want Luke around.\n\n\n       A stressed-out Katie visited Henry. She complained about Jacob being sick and her refrigerator being on the fritz. She wished that she had some help, and Henry insinuated that she shouldn't live alone. Katie thought that he was hinting that she should move in with Margo. She thanked him for the idea and took off.\n\n\n       Katie and Jacob went to the coffeehouse, where Jacob continuously cried. Dr. Oliver strode up and quipped that she should quiet her baby. Upon noticing that he was a doctor, Katie asked him to examine Jacob. Dr. Oliver rudely refused, and Katie retorted that she didn't know why she was asking a podiatrist who seemed to have his \"foot shoved up his-\" Katie turned to go, but Dr. Oliver agreed to look at Jacob before the baby's crying made him a menace to society.\n\n\n       Dr. Oliver quickly diagnosed Jacob with an ear infection, and Katie surprisingly learned that Dr. Oliver was a neurosurgeon being held against his will for the next month, and Dr. Bob Hughes was playing the warden. Additionally, Dr. Oliver hated staying in \"germ farm\" hotels, where he was forced to share sheets and pillows with strangers. Katie remarked that there were other places in town for him to sleep, and he wondered what she was getting at.\n\n\n       Maddie met Henry at Al's diner, where he explained about how lonely he was without Vienna, Simon, and Brad. With Katie too busy for him, he was on his own. Maddie suggested that Henry see if Katie wanted a roommate. Maddie advised him to pitch his babysitting and foot massaging skills, but Henry insisted that he was looking for a roommate, not a soul mate. \"So what if you happen to get both out of the deal?\" Maddie wondered. Henry insisted that nothing ruined a good friendship the way that love did.\n\n\n       Henry went to Katie's to find her relaxing with a cup of cider. She explained that she'd taken care of Jacob's ear infection and fixed the refrigerator. Henry stated that he'd talked to Maddie, who'd given him some advice to help Katie. Katie wondered what it could have been, and Henry nervously asked her to give her feet to him.  A puzzled Katie complied and melted when Henry began massaging them.\n\n\n       Katie was in ecstasy as Henry massaged her feet, and he commented that if she lived with Margo, Margo wouldn't give foot massages. Henry hinted that Katie needed to live with someone \"less related\" to her. Before Henry could nominate himself, Dr. Oliver let himself in with a key. Dr. Oliver looked around and said the place would work. Henry wondered who the man was, and Katie introduced him as her new roommate. \n\n\n",
