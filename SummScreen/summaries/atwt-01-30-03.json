Chris tells his mother that he will do some investigating and make sure that Will's care is up and up.  When Chris gets to the hospital to start his shift, he goes up to the psyche ward and Alison is sitting at a desk pretending to read a magazine.  Chris starts to talk to the nurse in charge and who has an armful of files.  After flirting with the nurse, Chris asks if he can see Will Munson's file.  The nurse informs him that Will is a patient of Dr. Michaels and she can't let him see the file.  Chris flirts a little more and tells her that Will is a cousin of his and he just wants to check on everything and make sure that Will is being taken care of.  The nurse gives Chris the file.  Alison watches the two intently.  The nurse leaves and Chris starts to read the file.  John Dixon walks in and sees Chris reading the file.  He walks up behind Chris and asks what is he doing.  Chris jumps, closes the file and puts the file in Dr. Michaels' slot.  John yells at Chris when he sees that the file is Will's.  He reminds Chris that it is unethical that he would look into a patient's file that is not in his care.  John asks if Chris would like to be written up and let the board look into the matter.  Bob walks up and sees John talking to Chris.  He walks over and asks what is going on.  John lies and says that Chris was late for his rounds and he was letting him know that can't happen again.  John leaves and Bob tells Chris that he doesn't believe John and he wants to know what was going on between the two.  Chris tells his father that he was looking at Will's file and John caught him.  Bob tells his son how wrong that is and Chris tells him that he found some things in Will's file.  He shows his father that there was an accelerant that was used in the fire, but Will had no evidence of an accelerant on is body.  He goes on to say that Will admits to lighting the matches, but he insist that he stomped the match out.  Chris asks his father to take a look at the file and discuss it with Dr. Michaels.  Bob says that he would have to have a darn good reason to do that.  Chris says that he thinks that Will has painted himself into a corner and is confused.  Alison sits and listens intently.  \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo and Hal are discussing Jack and the tragic situation he and Carly are in.  Jack walks into the room and announces that he has brought rolls for everyone at the station.  Margo and Hal look at each quizzically.  Jack goes to his desk and starts to shuffle papers.  Hal walks over and asks if Jack would do better if he took some time off.  Jack tells his friend that he can't just sit in the house and look at Parker's toys and do nothing.  He adds that if he is working, then his mind will be on other thoughts rather than Carly.  Jack sits down and gets to work and Hal walk over to Emily who has just walked in the door.  As Jack is working, Magda (the security guard at Monte Carlo) comes in and tells Jack that thanks to him she has turned her life around and is starting over.  Before she goes, she hands Jack a mini camera that she had taken from Henry the night that Carly and Mike slept together.  She tells him that the pictures on that camera would be worth a lot, but she is handing the camera over to him.  Jack stands up and throws the camera across the room and orders Magda to leave the station.  Magda is stunned and doesn't know what she has done.  Margo escorts Magda out and Hal deals with Jack.  Hal begs Jack to please take some time off.  Jack points at Emily and tells Hal to be careful of her because they all lie.  Hal grabs Jack and pushes him into the interrogation.

The desk person tells him that Marshall and Jessica are staying in the same room.  Ben decides not to be connected to the room and hangs up.  Ben tells Lien that Jessica and Marshall are in the same room.  Lien tries to get Ben to see the logical side of things.

She sees that he has woken up and tells him that she ordered breakfast for him.  He tells her that she has read his mind.

Lien and Ben tell Marshall how sorry they are and Lien says that she has to leave and get back to her office.  Jessica walks the two to the door.  Lien says goodbye to Jessica.  Ben tells Jessica that he will go with Lien to her office and then the three of them can go back to Oakdale together.  He tells Jessica that he wants to talk to her about being friends again.  Jessica tells Ben that Marshall shouldn't be flying again so soon and she will be staying in Washington with him until he feels able to leave again.  That answer does not make Ben a happy man.\n\n\nMolly is just waking up in her hotel room.
