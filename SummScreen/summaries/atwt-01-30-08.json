Jack explained that Parker's recent actions with Sam and Sam's puppet, and the theft at Metro, had persuaded them that Parker needed more help than they could offer. The therapist arrived at the house and asked to speak to Parker alone. She asked him to tell her what was going on, and the two discussed his recent problems. \n\n\nIn the kitchen, Carly and Jack discussed Carly's sister, Rosanna, slipping back into her coma. Jack encouraged Carly to hang in there, and she remarked that she might be losing Rosanna, but she would not lose Parker. Jack sensed that Carly was upset because of both Rosanna and Parker.  He gave her a reassuring hug and remarked that they would get through it. \n\n\nJust as it looked as if Carly and Jack might kiss, the therapist called from the other room and asked to talk to them. She told them that she and Parker had talked, and she believed that they could work out Parker's problems in family therapy. She asked Parker to leave the room so she could talk to Jack and Carly. The therapist told Jack and Carly that Parker was worried about Carly's friend Sam, and Jack and Carly added that he'd had a tough year that had included losing his biological father and sister, and Carly's recent brain tumor and lie. \n\n\nThe therapist then explained that Parker might be reacting to Jack's anger at Carly. She insisted that Jack's anger was feeding Parker's anger at his mother. Jack was upset at the notion that Parker's behavior was his fault, and both Carly and Jack took responsibility for their son's acting out. The therapist left after setting appointments and encouraging Jack and Carly to seek therapy as well. With their meeting over, Jack, Carly, and Parker set out on their day. \n\n\nIn Katie's room at the Lakeview, Brad continued healing from his broken leg, but his constant demands with their sexual undertones were driving Katie insane. When Brad asked Katie for a sponge bath, she believed Brad's only intention was to get her in bed, but she gave in when he reminded her that he had broken his leg while looking for her. Katie left the room to get water for the bath and returned to find Brad had dimmed the lights and lit candles in an attempt to set a romantic mood. Brad denied that he was trying to seduce Katie, but she refused to believe him and instead of a nice warm sponge bath, washed him with cold water. \n\n\nWhen the sponge bath turned slightly romantic, Katie rushed out of the room. She returned and told Brad that his recovery time was at an end, and he could head home. She handed him crutches, but Brad floundered on them, and he fell to the bed, taking Katie with him. Katie jumped up and told Brad to stop playing games. She got set to leave and told Brad to be gone by the time she was back. \n\n\nVienna arrived to encourage Brad and Katie's romance, but Katie stormed out, leaving Vienna and Brad to plan a new way to get Katie back in Brad's arms. Vienna told Brad to use Katie's emotions to get her back and persuaded him to make Katie believe they could have a future and family together. Vienna set a romantic mood in the room and told Brad to give Katie a call. Brad was reluctant but called Katie to get her back to the room. \n\n\nKatie walked through Old Town and saw Jack talking to Parker. She tried to avoid Jack, but he saw her when he went into Java. He told Katie he could really use a friend and then he told her about his trouble with Parker. The two were interrupted when Katie received Brad's phone call. Brad told her that he had fallen down and needed her to get there right away to help him up. Jack offered to go with Katie to help her with Brad. Before going, Vienna laid Brad out on the floor and left so he could try to romance Katie. \n\n\nBrad was relieved when Katie arrived but not thrilled to see his brother. When Jack looked around the room and saw the romantic setting, he realized what was happening. Jack was reluctant to go but left. Back alone in the room, Katie told Brad not to push his recovery, and Brad took her kind words as a sign she cared for him. Brad opened a bottle of champagne, and when he tried to share his feelings with Katie, she ran from the room. Vienna saw Katie bolting from the room and returned to tell Brad that she knew Katie loved him and that he couldn't give up. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Barbara walked out of an exam room, looking exhausted, and got the good news from Lisa that Bob had emerged from his coma. Lisa realized something was wrong with Barbara and pressed her friend to reveal what it was. Barbara finally admitted to Lisa that she had cancer. She explained her diagnosis of oral cancer, and her dear friend was shocked and saddened. She was even more surprised when she learned that Barbara hadn't even told her children about the diagnosis. Lisa encouraged her to tell the kids right away. \n\n\nCasey looked in as Will and Gwen held baby Hallie. Alison found him on their front porch and encouraged him to go inside and say hello to his friends and their new baby girl. Gwen and Will were surprised to see Casey back from prison and happily welcomed him home and introduced him to Hallie. Casey was reluctant to hold Hallie because of how he had treated Gwen when she'd had his baby, but Will and Gwen told Casey to forget the past and move forward. Gwen left the room with Alison to feed Hallie, leaving Will and Casey to discuss his return to Oakdale. \n\n\nWill, who had spent years in a mental hospital for killing Rose, told Casey that it just took time, and things would return to normal. When Gwen returned to the room, she asked Casey if he had talked to Maddie. Casey admitted he hadn't had any contact with his ex-girlfriend, and Gwen encouraged him to at least call her to let her know he was back in town. Casey seemed unenthusiastic about talking to Maddie and said he had to leave to start looking for a job. \n\n\nAs Will, Gwen, and Alison cleaned up around the house, they received a visit from Barbara, who asked to enter so she could tell Will and Gwen something. Barbara's arrival sent Alison on her way. Once alone, Barbara learned from Will and Gwen that Casey was back. \n\n\nWhen Barbara began to talk about forgiveness and life, Will, sensing something was wrong, asked his mother if she was all right. Tears formed in her eyes, and she told him she wasn't all right but stopped when Gwen carried the baby into the room. Will introduced his mother to her granddaughter for the first time. Barbara was overjoyed to hold Hallie and thanked the two for the opportunity to spend time with her. Will and Gwen asked what Barbara had wanted to tell them, but she commented that she didn't want to ruin the perfect moment. \n\n\nCasey walked through town and realized that he had burned a lot of bridges before he went to prison. He ran into his grandmother, Lisa, who was happy to see him and welcomed him back home. She learned he was looking for work, and she immediately hired him. Lisa took Casey to the Lakeview, and he thanked his grandmother for trusting him again, especially after how he had stolen from her before going to prison. Casey started his work as a waiter, but when he saw a large jar of tips, he looked tempted to take the money. \n\n\nSam sat alone at Metro with his puppet, Cowboy Jack, and the two discussed his relationship problems with Carly. He was upset that Carly and Jack were spending so much time together, and the dummy ominously commented that Sam needed to get rid of Parker if he wanted to be with Carly. Carly arrived at Metro and told Sam that she had just left the hospital, where she had learned Rosanna was on her way back to a clinic in Switzerland to recover from her coma. \n\n\nCarly admitted to Sam that there was a good chance Rosanna might never wake up, and Sam comforted Carly with a hug. Carly explained that she felt bad she hadn't been there for her sister when Rosanna had needed her, but Sam told her there was no way she could have known that Rosanna would slip back into her coma. Since Metro was still shut down because of the broken heater, Carly invited Sam to go to her house to get out of the frigid club. \n\n\nSam and Carly went to her house. Sam immediately handed her a beer, and the two drank their sorrows away. The two discussed their recent heartbreak and Sam leaned in to kiss Carly.  \n\n\n",
