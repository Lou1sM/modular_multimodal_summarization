He asked Meg to cut them up before he changed his mind and used them. Dusty told Meg there was also a suitcase full of cash in the trunk of his car, but he told her not to cut up the cash. Meg said taking Johnny and leaving town was what she would have done, too, so she had called from the courthouse and asked Emma to take Johnny out riding. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Carly tried to convince Craig to give Johnny a couple of days to say goodbye to Dusty, so that Johnny wouldn't feel like he was being abandoned again. Craig insisted that all Johnny needed was to be with him. Craig went to the farm. Dusty asked for more time to say goodbye to Johnny, and Craig agreed, but only to five more minutes. Upset, Dusty walked out of the house. \n\n\nMeg asked Craig why he was antagonizing Dusty, but Craig pointed out that Dusty had done the same to him at every opportunity. Meg wondered whether Craig would let Dusty and Jennifer's family be a part of Johnny's life. Craig said maybe, but he asked if Meg would want her enemies close to her own child. Meg said it wasn't about Dusty, it was about Johnny, but Craig said he would give Johnny everything he needed. \n\n\nDusty walked onto the porch with Johnny and praised him for his horseback riding skills. Dusty then told Johnny that he wanted him to spend time with his other daddy. Johnny asked if Dusty would be there, too. Dusty assured Johnny that he would always be there, even if Johnny couldn't see him, because he loved Johnny so much. Craig walked out and asked Johnny if he was ready to go. Dusty suggested packing some of Johnny's things, and Craig agreed that was a good idea, but he said he would send someone to pick them up later, and he left with Johnny. \n\n\nMeg tried to keep Dusty occupied by having him assemble Eliza's crib. After he was done with that, Dusty told Meg he needed to leave, but he wouldn't tell her where he was going. Meg followed him and saw that he had gone to Jennifer's grave. Meg listened as Dusty wondered aloud why Jennifer hadn't helped him keep their little boy away from Craig. Dusty saw that Meg was there, listening to him. Meg said she had worried that Dusty might leave town. Dusty thought that would be easier than staying, knowing that Johnny was with Craig. \n\n\nMeg took Dusty down to the Snyder pond and reminded him of how they had first seen each other there again after years of having been apart. Meg wanted Dusty to remember that he had a life before Jennifer and Johnny. Dusty said Johnny and Jennifer had changed his life. He said he wanted to kill Craig, but he couldn't, because he wouldn't be able to look Johnny in the eyes if he did that. Dusty said the man he used to be could have done it. \n\n\nDusty returned to his suite at the Lakeview, and Meg arrived shortly thereafter with Eliza. Meg told Dusty that she was worried about him. Dusty said he had been at his best with Jennifer and Johnny, but Meg pointed out that people said, \"The best is yet to be.\" Dusty said it was also true that when people said the worst was over, things got worse. Eliza began to cry, and as Meg went to pick her up, she dropped the pacifier. Meg asked Dusty to pick up Eliza while she went to rinse off the pacifier. Reluctantly, Dusty picked the baby up, and as he held her, he calmed down. \n\n\nJack went to the diner to talk to Janet. While he was there, Wendy, Jack and Janet's real estate agent, called. Jack told Janet that someone had outbid them for the house they wanted to buy. Janet wanted to up their bid, but Jack said they couldn't afford to do that. Janet resigned herself to the news and said they would find a better, cheaper house. \n\n\nParker caught up with Liberty in Old Town. Liberty was upset because she had seen Parker talking to another girl at school, and she had thought he was flirting with the girl. Parker explained that the girl's cousin was a roadie with Metallica, and he had been trying to get tickets to Metallica's Chicago concert. Liberty didn't believe him, so he sent her a text message with the girl's phone number and told Liberty if she wanted tickets, she would have to get them herself. \n\n\nLiberty went to see her mom at the diner and explained about her misunderstanding with Parker. She then asked if she could have $200 to buy the Metallica tickets. As they were talking, Parker walked in. Liberty walked over to Parker, but he turned his back on her and instead began talking to Jack. Parker asked his dad for $200 for Metallica tickets. He told Jack that he had a connection who could get him great seats, and he would never have an opportunity like that again. Janet interrupted and said she thought Parker and Liberty could go to the concert together. They both said they'd be okay with that, but Jack informed them that it was more than they could afford at the moment. Seeing the look on Jack's face, Janet backed him up, and the kids said they understood. They left, and Jack told Janet he felt like he was disappointing everyone. \n\n\nJack left the diner. Later, Craig brought Johnny there to try to get him to eat, but Johnny didn't seem hungry. Janet waited on them and suggested different things to eat, but Johnny said he wanted to go home. Craig told Janet it wasn't Craig's home that Johnny wanted to go to, and Janet suggested Craig call Dusty and let Johnny talk to him. Craig dismissed Janet and instead asked Johnny what he wanted to do. Johnny said he wanted to make brownies. Janet overheard, and she suggested Craig take Johnny back to the farm, but Craig said he wasn't very welcome there. \n\n\nCraig told Johnny that he knew where they could go, and together, they went to Carly's house. Carly answered the door in her robe and told Craig she was about to shower before she went to work at Metro. Craig had Johnny explain that they were hoping to bake brownies. Seeing Johnny's hopeful look, Carly gave in and told the two to go to the kitchen and wash up while she went upstairs to get dressed. Before she could go upstairs, Jack knocked on the door. Carly let him in and watched as Jack took in the fact that Carly was wearing her robe and that Craig's coat was lying on her sofa. Carly asked Jack what he wanted, and he told her about the real estate deal falling through. Carly sympathized and thanked Jack for letting her know he wouldn't be using the second mortgage money right away. \n\n\nCraig walked out of the kitchen, and Jack asked Carly, \"Don't you ever learn?\" Carly asked Jack what she was supposed to \"learn.\" Jack said for whatever reasons Carly hadn't married Craig, she shouldn't be allowing Craig in their home. Carly pointed out that it was her home, not their home, and Craig told Jack he was way out of line. Johnny walked into the room, which surprised Jack, and Craig took Johnny back into the kitchen. \n\n\nCarly told Jack that even though he didn't deserve to know what had happened, she would tell him. She filled him in on why Craig and Johnny were there, and Jack apologized for having jumped to conclusions. Carly said she wanted more than an apology; she wanted to know that it would never happen again. She said she also wanted to know why Jack had really come to see her. She thought Jack had seen Craig's car outside and had decided he had to see what Carly and Craig were doing. She then asked if Jack was okay, or if the house thing was a bigger deal than he was letting on. Jack said he was fine, but he warned Carly again about staying away from Craig. Carly told Jack he needed to leave. \n\n\nCarly went back to the kitchen to make the brownies. Parker arrived, and Craig told him they were celebrating the fact that Johnny was officially Craig's son. Parker said he was glad Craig hadn't needed to marry Carly to make that happen. Carly told Parker not to start, because she'd just gotten an earful from his dad. Parker said he had, too. Carly asked what Jack had talked to Parker about, and Parker said Jack had seemed freaked out about money. He told his mom he was going to go the game store, and Carly told him to be back by dinner. \n\n\nCraig followed Parker out and asked Parker if he would do him a favor by going to buy some toys for Johnny. Craig began handing Parker some money, and he peeled off some more bills and told Parker to keep those for his trouble. Parker's eyes lit up, and he told Craig he could use the money to buy Metallica tickets. Craig worried that he hadn't given Parker enough for something like that, but Parker assured Craig it was plenty, and he said he would get some great toys for Johnny. \n\n\nParker left, and Craig went back to making brownies. Johnny ate most of the brownies by himself, and Carly warned Craig that wasn't good for a little boy. She also said Craig couldn't buy Johnny's love. Craig wasn't so sure, but then Johnny began feeling bad, and Carly had to take him upstairs to lie down for a while. Carly then advised Craig not to give his children everything he thought they wanted. She also warned him that when he was in need of a parental advisor, he would have to look elsewhere, because she didn't want the job. \n\n\nJack stopped by the diner again, and when Janet asked where he'd been, he told her he had stopped by Carly's and that Craig had been there with Johnny, \"trying to worm his way in.\" Janet told Jack she didn't think that was what Craig was doing, and she explained how Johnny had been at the diner with Craig earlier. Janet told Jack that she thought he was more concerned with what Carly was doing with Craig than with what effect Craig might have on Jack's kids. Despite Jack's denials, Janet said she thought that Jack was having trouble letting Carly go, but he needed to, because it was clear that Carly still bothered him. \n\n\nParker found Liberty and told her about his errand for Craig. Liberty was excited, and together, they went to pick out toys for Johnny. Afterward, they went to the diner, where Janet asked why they had been shopping. They told her and Jack, and Jack was very upset that Craig was using Parker to run his errands. Parker tried to tell Jack that it wasn't like that, but Jack didn't care. Parker and Liberty left, and Liberty asked Parker when he thought they could tell their parents about the concert tickets. Parker suggested they not say anything until after the concert. \n\n\nJanet asked Jack what was really bothering him, and he told her it was that Craig had money, and he didn't. Jack said he wanted to be able to give Janet things, and to give his kids things, but he couldn't. Janet assured him that didn't matter, but Jack said it mattered to him.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
