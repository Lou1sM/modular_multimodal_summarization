    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the hospital, Chris Hughes tries to get his father to read Will Munson's psychology file, but Bob scolds his son for snooping and threatens to write him up next time he catches him in an area where he doesn't belong.  After both doctors return to work, the eavesdropping candy striper Alison sneaks over to the wall holding several charts, snatches Will's chart, and tries to find out what doctors have been saying about Will.  She reads, \" 'Patient can't make the connection between playing with the matches and starting the fire.'...So, I help him fill in the blanks.  Make him think he did it, and I'm in the clear.\"  She walks out of the area and into the hallway where she runs into Emily and her mother.  Emily says Hal won't budge because Dr. Michaels advised him to not allow Alison to visit with Will.  Susan doesn't know much about the situation, but volunteers to speak with Dr. Michaels directly on Alison's behalf.  Alison hugs her mother for the first time in months, and Susan gratefully accepts the attention.  Emily doesn't let Alison off the hook so easily.  She demands to know what she was doing in the psyche ward after she was told to stay away.  Later, Susan returns with good news.  Dr. Michaels approved one last visit with Will, then Alison can see him anytime she wants when he returns home.  Susan is rewarded with another hug, then Alison runs to see Will.  Emily is curious why Alison is so happy.  Susan reminds Emily that Alison is acting just like she did when she was her age.  Emily doesn't appreciate the comparison, and still wonders what Alison is up to.\n\n\nIn Molly's suite, she asks Mike, \"You want another chance?\"  Mike pleads with her, \"I made a mistake.\"  Molly zings back, \"You made a baby.\"  Molly can't figure out why, after all this time of using protection with her, why he made love to Carly one night without using a condom.  \"I didn't know you were saving yourself for Carly.\"  She asks him if he has always been loved by his family and friends.  He nods, and says, \"I've been lucky.\"  She tells him of her history, \"Some people haven't always been that lucky.  Because-my parents had little or no use for me.  And my boyfriends were all users.  And I never had a real girlfriend until Carly came into my life.  And nobody loved me until Jake.  I wanted to die with him.\"  She tells him that he won't get another chance to pick her up off the floor.  \"This conversation is over!  Just get out!\"  Before he leaves, Mike says, \"You're wrong about us.  We can make it and I will prove it to you.\" \n\n\nAt the Lakeview Lounge, Jack is getting tanked while pursuing an interested lady.  Joan hikes her dress up over her knee and continues to seductively talk with Jack.  Jack tries to wade through to his senses, and says, \"I-I'm married.\"  The lady plays with her wedding ring and says, \"Me too.\"  Jack asks if her husband knows that she's out looking to get lucky in a bar.  Joan is taken aback and says, \"You don't know me.  You don't know my marriage.  You have no right to speak to me like this.\"  She picks up her purse, and walks out.  Jack apologizes, but it's too late.  As Jack throws a payment down on the bar for the drinks, Mike bellies up to the bar and barks that he wants whatever is ready on draught.  Jack sighs and says, \"I just can't catch a break.\"  Mike tells him he was here talking with Molly, who moved out.  Jack congratulates her decision.  They exchange glares, then Jack storms off.  \n\n\nOutside Marshall's hotel room in Washington, DC, Jessica and Ben argue about why she is deciding to stay and take care of Marshall.  Jessica can see that Ben doesn't understand and retreats to the room.  Ben stops her and apologizes for his recent attitude, and tells her, \"I'm ready to forgive you.\"  Jessica is unmoved by the gesture and says, \"If you don't have anything else to say to me, have a safe flight.\"  She closes the door and Marshall asks her what time her flight leaves.  Jessica storms off to the bathroom telling him she isn't leaving until it's safe for Marshall to travel.  Later, Marshall wonders aloud why Lien and Ben came in person to deliver the bad news.  Jessica says that sometimes when people are grieving, they need the support of their friends.  Marshall wraps his arms around her waist and says, \"I can think of a few better ways to remind me how life is good.  Show me I'm not alone.\"  Jessica stomps her heel into Marshall's foot.  He screams, then asks, \"What did you do that for?!\"  She says, \"I would have slapped you, but you just had brain surgery.\"  She redirects the focus back to his daughter's death, and tries to get him to mourn for Zara.  He focuses on the mistakes he made with Zara and her mother, then finally breaks down and cries.  Outside the door, Ben calls Lien in DC and thanks her for all her recent support.  He hangs up, then walks to Marshall's room.  He finds a \"Privacy Please\" sign hanging on the knob, listens at the door, then walks away when he hears hushed voices.  Inside, Jessica comforts Marshall, then tucks him in for a nap.\n\n\nBack in Molly's suite, she is curled up on her couch crying when there is a knock at the door.  She tells Mike to go away, but it's Jack.  She opens the door and lets him inside.  They commiserate about their similar situations.  He asks for a drink, but Molly pours him a cup of tea.  She admits she still loves Mike, and tells him he still loves Carly.  But, she doesn't love him enough to take him back.  Jack tells her that he hit Mike hard at the station, and that Hal forced him to take two weeks off.  She begins to weep again, and Jack holds her in his arms.  She says, \"I'm so glad you're here.\"  He brushes a tear from her face and says, \"Me too.\"  Later, they're eating some snacks, and Jack starts rubbing her shoulders.  They get into another compromising position and she asks what they're going to do.  Later still, both pull out some photos of Mike and Carly and lay them on a silver plate next to a pair of scissors and a lighter. Jack is first up.  He lifts Carly's photo and sets fire to it.  Molly watches it burn for a short time, then grabs the photo, puts out the fire, and breaks down weeping.  Jack grabs her and tries to console her.  She starts to hit his chest in anger, until she wearily stops and looks into his eyes.  They both pause, then fall into a passionate kiss.\n\n\nPaul meets his mother at the Java caf\u00e9, and confirms that Hal had a secret meeting with Lynn Michaels regarding Will.  Barbara freaks out, wondering if everyone is conspiring against her.  She says a court date has been scheduled to determine if Will can be released from the hospital, but she fears they will assign custody to Hal.  She begs Paul to help stop this from happening.  Paul says he will testify on Will's behalf.  Barbara briefly accuses Paul for being responsible for the fire because he left Will alone.  Paul eyes erupt with flames.  He stands up and starts to walk out.  Barbar stops her son and spits, \"He needs us.  We're an imperfect family, but he needs us.\"  He again says he will support whatever the court finds, even if it means Will is returned to Hal's custody.  Barbara says, \"Oh Paul, I'm beginning to think you're father was right about you.\" \n\n\nLucinda meets Lily for lunch at the Lakeview.  Lucinda wonders where Rose is because she was invited also.  Lily wants to try to talk with her mother about backing Rose's latest dream to open a hair salon before Rose arrives.  Lucinda waffles at the idea while Rose comes within earshot.  Rose blurts, \"It's a good thing I'm not hittin' ya up for a loan then, huh?\"  Later, Rose shows her the business plan.  Lucinda finally offers Rose financial help, but Rose turns her down because she wants to start her business on her own.  Rose runs off to meet up with Paul.  Lily sees Mike walk through.  She rushes up to him and offers him her ear, if he wants it.  They sit at a table and start to talk things through.  Lily advises him to be patient.\n\n\nRose meets Paul at the bar.  They try to have another date, but Paul is still a little uncomfortable.  \n\n\nAlison finally meets with Will and starts to feed him false information.  She tells him that he lit the matches and then dropped them into the straw, but they instead fell onto the oily rags Aaron left lying around, and then the rags caught on fire.  Will says he never said those things, and doesn't remember anything like that happening.  Will then asks her if she was the one who started the fire.  \"Was it you?\"\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Alison reads Wills file and becomes nervous that Chris will notice that Will cannot recall any of the details. Susan gets Dr. Michaels to let Alison visit Will. When Alison visits him she talks about the oily rags so much that Will questions whether she started the fire. Lily and Lucinda offer Rose funding for her new business but she refuses their offer. Rose rushes to her date with Paul who is upset from having an encounter with Barbara. Paul suggests that he and Rose get real about their relationship. When Ben leaves, Marshall makes a move on Jessica but she rejects it and helps him through his grief. Meanwhile, Lien tries to encourage Ben to tell Jessica how he feels about her. He goes back up to Marshall and Jessicas room, but is consumed with jealousy when he hears Jessicas soothing words to Marshall. Molly turns down Mikes bid for another chance. Mike runs into Jack on his way out of the hotel and tells him that Molly has a room there. Jack recovering from being hit on by a married woman, goes to Mollys room and they have a passionate kiss. Mike runs into Lily who convinces him to not give up on Molly. Lily suggests that Mike take Mollys things to her room a little at a time so he can see her as much as possible. Mike decides to put the plan in motion. ",
