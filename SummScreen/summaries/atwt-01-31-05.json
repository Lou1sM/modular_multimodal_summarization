Paul sees that Rosanna is upset, and takes her out for a drink at metro, while the boys prepare for the party.  Rosanna tells Paul that she is still feeling Cabot's presence, and that perhaps they should reconsider staying at Fairwinds.  Rosanna steps outside to call the caterers and senses someone behind her in the dark.  A few minutes later she receives a call from someone claiming to work for the caterer, asking her to return home.  She leaves Paul at metro and starts driving toward Fairwinds, but James Stenbeck appears in the back seat of her car and demands that she continue to drive.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Alison arrives just before the high school kids come in.  A long-haired, smart-mouthed jock named Tyson, is rude to Will, so Alison gives Will a big kiss and pretends to be his \"older\" girlfriend.\n\n\nEmily comes to the police station and tells a stunned Hal that she is not ready to come home yet.  Alison comes to the station to pick Emily up, and they have a very pointed conversation in front of Hal about how supportive Paul has been, in contrast to Hal. Alison and Emily go to metro, where they join Paul and Rosanna, before Rosanna gets the call from the \"caterer.\"  Alison leaves to check out Will's party, and Paul and Emily are left at metro, where Paul reassures Emily that she and Hal will find their way back together, just as he and Rosanna did.\n\n\nIn Julia's bedroom, Lily finds a letter with Keith Morrisey's return address in Chicago.  Just then she hears Julia and Holden entering the bedroom, so Lily hides under the bed.  As she hears the kissing and endearments above her, she sends Carly a text message on her mobile phone, \"Help - I'm trapped.\"  Carly receives the message and starts out the door, but finds Emma there on her way home from the airport.  Emma insists that Carly stay so that she can scold her for playing a trick on Julia and putting Emma in the middle.  Carly immediately apologizes and leaves for the farm as quickly as she can.  As soon as Carly leaves the house, she calls Holden and tells him that she needs to talk to him about J. J.  Holden and Julia are angry at being interrupted, but they dress and come downstairs to find Carly babbling about everyone trying to get along for J. J.'s sake.  Carly distracts Holden and Julia long enough for Lily to sneak down the stairs and out the front door.  Carly and Lily inspect the return address and the note from Keith, and plan to go to Chicago to find him.  Emma returns to the farmhouse to hear Julia turning on the tears with Holden, as the two discuss their affair.  Emma is furious with Holden, who responds, \"I'm tired of looking after everybody but myself.\"  Emma angrily retorts, \"Well, this is my home - and I want Julia out of here by tomorrow,\" and stomps out of the room.  Holden comforts Julia and tells her that nothing will change between them.\n\n\n",
