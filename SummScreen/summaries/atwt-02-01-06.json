    "tvmega_recap": "Holden reads part of Luke's blog, but is caught. Luke is furious and tells Holden he no longer trusts him; Holden persists, but dances around the issue of his son and Kevin. Luke covers saying his negative thoughts posted on his blog were because he feels as if he is being watched 24/7 and he is having a hard time with the pressure being put on him. Lily and Holden decide to go out for the night. While out, Lily questions why Holden still seems bothered by Luke's behavior? What is he keeping from her about Luke? Later, Luke finds his way to the rooftop party where Kevin is. After Lisa fires Gwen for supposedly stealing a guest's diamond necklace, Gwen confronts Barbara about setting her up. Barbara denies any wrongdoing, but panics when Will tells her to open her purse. Lisa interrupts telling them Gwen has to leave the hotel now. A dejected Will and Gwen vow to stay together, and Will concocts a plan to steal from Barbara, because as he sees it, she owes them. Lisa admits she checked out Barbara to make sure she wasn't involved in setting Gwen up to take the fall over the necklace. Barbara secretly wraps the necklace in tissue and puts it on a maid's cart. Paul sends Meg away; Meg fights him, telling him they should go to Waco to get care. Paul refuses and Meg finally agrees to go.

They are interrupted by Meg coming home and are forced to hide. Meg talks with Paul on the phone, when he realizes he misses her after reading the funny notes she left for him.

Henry replaces the phone with an untraceable one he had, so Meg is not suspicious. Meg starts to leave town, and Emily calls the number on Meg's phone, and is shocked to hear Paul's voice say hello.",
