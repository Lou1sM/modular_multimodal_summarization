Parker replied, \"Get rid of Sam.\" Even though Carly and Jack agreed that giving in to Parker wasn't a good idea, Carly was afraid Parker wouldn't be reasonable as long as Sam was still around. She told Jack that she'd fire Sam, and she left. \n\n\nJack told Parker to give his mom a break and try to see how much she was sacrificing for him. When Parker heard that Carly was going to fire Sam, he was thrilled. Jack told him that in return, they expected him to do his homework, go to therapy, help out around the house, and \"stop being such a bonehead to your mother.\" Parker agreed and told Jack that things would be better. \n\n\nCarly went to Metro, where she found Kit and Sam together. She told them that she was sorry, but Sam couldn't work there anymore because of how Parker felt about him. Sam said he understood, but Kit didn't. Kit told Carly that \"if Sam goes,\" she would go, too, and she'd take her money with her. Carly returned to the farm, where she told Jack she couldn't fire Sam without losing her business partner, too, which she couldn't afford to do. \n\n\nCarly tried to think of some way to get the money to buy Kit's share of Metro, but she was out of options. Jack said if Carly didn't fire Sam, Parker would think Jack had lied to him, and Parker wouldn't trust either of them anymore. Carly wanted to know if she had to give up her chance to build a new life just to please Parker. Jack suggested that she tell Parker the truth, and Carly said she would as long as Jack would be there with her when she talked to Parker, to back her up. \n\n\nCarly and Jack told Parker what would happen to Metro if Carly fired Sam. Carly told Parker that she had tried to do what he had asked, but Parker called her a liar. Jack told Parker to back off, but Parker just became more upset, saying, \"When you find out how much of a creep Sam is, you'll be sorry you didn't listen to me!\" He ran upstairs. \n\n\nCarly called Sam at Metro and told him that she and Jack had decided he could stay. Sam thanked her, hung up, and gave Kit the good news. Kit settled back in, and Sam pulled out Cowboy Jack to \"rehearse.\" Cowboy Jack told Sam that with Kit breathing down his shoulder, Sam would just have to take Carly someplace \"private\" if he wanted to be alone with her. \n\n\nHenry arrived at the diner and discovered a \"private party\" sign in the window. Inside, he found Brad setting up for a romantic dinner with Katie. Henry told Brad that Katie didn't want to be with him, but Brad said Katie was in denial. When Henry asked what made Brad think that, Brad said it was what Vienna had told him. \n\n\nVienna, meanwhile, went to Katie's suite at the Lakeview and reported that she and Henry had had a huge fight. She begged Katie to go back to the diner with her to help her patch things up with Henry. When they got there, Vienna grabbed Henry and left with him quickly. Katie saw Brad and realized it had been a setup. She wanted to leave, but Brad convinced her to at least sit down and enjoy the meal that Vienna had helped him prepare for Katie. \n\n\nAs Brad and Katie began to eat, he tried to talk to her about his feelings for her, but Katie kept interrupting him. Katie heard Pepper, Henry and Vienna's dog, whimpering, and she rescued him from the kitchen, where Brad had exiled him. Katie snuggled with the dog, who took a bite out of her dinner. Brad called Henry and asked him to return and get his dog because the dog was ruining his date. Henry and Vienna arrived to get Pepper, and Katie told them, \"That was a dirty trick!\" Henry and Vienna left, with Henry protesting his innocence. \n\n\nKatie told Brad she thought she'd go home, too, but when she tried to leave, she discovered that Vienna had locked them in. Brad told Katie they might as well eat dessert, saying he had Katie's favorite cheesecake. He took two plates of cheesecake to the table, first putting a diamond ring next to Katie's slice. Katie ate, but when she got to the bite where the ring was, she didn't see the ring and put it into her mouth, too. \n\n\nKate began choking, and Brad had to perform the Heimlich maneuver on her. The ring popped out, and Katie asked Brad if he had been trying to kill her. He told her he had been trying to propose to her. Brad told Katie that he had never felt that way about another woman, and he said he had changed because of her. He told her he couldn't help it that his last name was Snyder, but he would never hurt her the way Jack had. Brad pleaded, \"Give us a chance. I love you.\" Katie shook her head sadly, saying, \"It's not gonna happen, Brad; it's not gonna happen.\" \n\n\nKatie turned to leave just as Vienna and Henry returned. Katie rushed out. Henry caught up with her, and Katie told him to get Vienna under control, because Katie never wanted to be put in that position again. Vienna stayed at the diner with Brad and apologized for having returned at the wrong moment. Brad told her it didn't matter because Katie was gun-shy because of what had happened with Jack. \n\n\nAt Will and Gwen's house, Gwen suggested that she and Will go out for hot chocolate and let Barbara babysit. Will agreed but was worried because he sensed something was troubling his mom. Sofie walked into Java but walked back out after spotting Will and Gwen. However, she seemed to realize they had left Hallie with a babysitter, so she headed over to their house to try to see the baby. \n\n\nSofie was surprised to find that Barbara was the babysitter. Sofie asked to see the baby, but Barbara said that Hallie was sleeping. Sofie said she just wanted to have a peek at her and told Barbara that she had a right to see her own baby. Barbara told her to call Will and Gwen and work something out, and she closed the door. \n\n\nBarbara called Bonnie and told her that Sofie had stopped by unexpectedly, trying to see the baby. She asked Bonnie to please remind Sofie of the protocol for visiting the baby. Bonnie, who was at the Lakeview already, agreed, and when she saw Sofie walk by, she stopped her and said they needed to talk. Bonnie told Sofie that Sofie had upset Barbara when she had stopped by Will and Gwen's place, unannounced. Bonnie reminded Sofie that she was supposed to set up a time to visit the baby. Sofie was upset that she had to make an appointment to see her own baby, but Bonnie reminded her that Hallie had become Gwen and Will's baby, not Sofie's. \n\n\nBarbara rocked Hallie in her arms and then put her back down to bed, telling her that \"Nana is tired, too.\" She told the baby that she'd been sick, which was making her tired, but she knew she'd be all right because she had a grandbaby in her life again. Barbara went back to the living room, lay down on the sofa, and fell asleep. Sofie appeared outside, and glancing in the window, she saw Barbara sleeping. Sofie opened the unlocked door, tiptoed past Barbara, picked up Hallie, and carried the baby out of the house without waking Barbara. \n\n\n",
