Alison told Emily that she believed, because of Aaron's continued insistence, that Chris had pushed her off the fire escape after she'd told him that he was the father of her baby, therefore intending not only to hurt her, but to hurt the baby as well. Emily asked Alison directly what she actually remembered about the fall, but Aaron kept interrupting with his version.\n\n\nAlison told Emily that she remembered that Chris had asked her to go inside and had asked her to trust him. She remembered Chris extending his hand to her, and she thought she'd reached for his hand. After Aaron interrupted again, Emily took him aside and sent him home. Emily gently told Alison that she needed to be completely certain about what had happened. Alison lashed out at Emily and Susan for caring more for Chris than for her then she demanded that they leave her alone.\n\n\nChris and Tom Hughes arrived at Kim and Bob's house from Chicago after posting bail. Tom learned from a telephone call that Chris was facing two charges in Cook County: assault and involuntary manslaughter. When Chris wanted to go see Alison, Tom insisted, \"You can't go see Alison -- not now, not ever.\" When the two of them were alone for a few minutes, Chris told Kim that it was the first time he had thought only of Alison and that he still cared for Alison.\n\n\nKim left the room to join Bob and Tom, and Chris grabbed his coat and went out the kitchen door. In a few minutes they found that Chris had left, and Kim told the men there was no way they could keep Chris from Alison because he cared for her. Chris arrived at the door of Susan's house, and Alison tried to close the door on him. Chris finally told Alison that he'd reached out to her because he'd wanted to keep her and the baby safe, \"because, Alison -- because I love you.\" Alison did not believe him, and told him that he was lying and that she did not want to see him. Susan forced Chris to leave, with Chris still protesting that he loved Alison and with Alison in tears.\n\n\nAaron walked into Metro and found Lucy, who was there looking for Craig. Aaron at last told Lucy that Alison had lost the baby and that Chris, not Aaron, had been the father of the baby. He went on to tell her about the abortion clinic and that he believed that Chris had pushed Alison. Lucy questioned Aaron about why he'd kept the truth from her, and he told Lucy that Alison had asked him to keep the truth from everyone. Lucy made him face the truth: he had been so caught up in Alison's drama that he'd forgotten everything and everyone else.\n\n\nHolden took Luke and Natalie home after finding that Lily had taken them to Rose's to meet with Lois, the medium. Luke told Holden that Lois had only been pretending to be Rose because she had not called him Luciano, the way Rose always had. Inside the house, Lily caught Lois in the same mistake and accused her of being a fake. Lois angrily put on her coat to leave, insisting that Lucy had forced all of it on her, but Holden burst in and grabbed Lois' arm to force her to leave. Lois started, then accused, \"You slept with her! You slept with Rose!\"\n\n\nAppalled that Holden had slept with his sister-in-law, Lois left the house, and Holden took Lily home with him, in spite of the fact that Lily saw that as further evidence that Lois was in communication with Rose. In a few minutes, Lily returned to Rose's house on the pretext of having left her purse and immediately called Lois on her cell phone, begging her to return. Lois asked Lily not to call her again, but then gasped and told Lily that \"I have this feeling that she is very, very close to you right now.\" Lily opened the door and went out into the fog, following a mysterious figure shrouded in red.\n\n\nKatie interrupted Simon and Mike on the verge of a fight then took Mike aside to tell them that, although she would always love Mike, she had to honor her wedding vows and go with Simon. She gave the grief-stricken Mike a watch engraved, \"With all my love, Katie,\" and told him goodbye. Mike left with a determined look on his face, and Katie cried. Simon entered with a bag he had packed for Katie and told her they needed to leave immediately.\n\n\nWhen Katie, horrified, said that she had to see Mike one more time, Simon convinced her that they had to leave right away to ensure Mike's safety. Mike went directly to Margo at the police station to tell her what was happening. Margo pulled up the file on Simon's murder of Bartleby Shears and issued a warrant for Simon's arrest, in order to keep Simon from taking Katie away. Mike and Margo burst into Katie's door and found the house empty and Katie's engagement ring lying on the table. Mike saw the ring and reacted, \"The only reason Katie would leave this is to say goodbye. Where the hell did he take her?\"\n\n\n",

Lily finds a figure dressed in red strolling in the dark. Lois gets a vision when roughly handled. Lucy can see that her ex was more caught up in his fling's life than he knows. Mike can tell that his love was rushed into leaving. Margo is angry when she learns of her sister's plan.",
