Faith says she had a salad and that she isn't very hungry. When Lily suggests she needs more than a salad, Faith mouths off to her. As Lily begins to lecture Faith on her attitude, her phone rings again, and it's a business associate with a problem. Luke comes in and tells Lily that he and Faith will be okay while she goes to handle her business problem; when he sees the tension between them, he jokingly says they both need a time-out. Lily goes upstairs to get ready to leave, and Luke asks Faith what's wrong; she says, \"Nothing. I just hate her.\" Faith tells Luke that Lily thinks she's \"queen of everything\" and can order everyone around. When Luke tells her their mom is always on their side, Faith counters that Lily wasn't on Luke's side when she first found out he was gay. Luke is surprised to find out she knew about that, but he tells her that Lily came around and now even defends him if someone says something against gays. As Luke asks again what Faith is so angry about, Natalie walks in and asks why they're fighting; Faith says, \"Because no one ever listens to me --- ever!\" and storms out of the room. Luke asks Natalie if anything is happening with Faith that he should know about; she tells him about Faith throwing up and then not wanting her to tell their mom about it. Lily comes back down as Faith returns and tells Faith she'll take her to Java tomorrow so they can have some time alone to talk. Luke reassures her that they'll be fine while she's gone, and Lily leaves. Luke then tells Faith, \"I know what you're doing.\"\n\n\nVienna packs her bags to move out of Emma's house. As she tells Jack goodbye, she also tells him not to be too bitter about women. She goes outside and asks Brad to be nice to Jack because he's going through such a difficult time. Brad talks her into letting him take her to the hotel so she won't be alone, and they leave. Inside, Jack opens a letter from Parker's school saying that he's been skipping school; after calling for Parker, he realizes Parker's gone. He asks JJ where Parker might be, but JJ is reluctant to be a \"rat\" like Parker was. Jack explains to JJ that Parker's still a kid, and it's important that they find him, because it's getting late, so JJ admits that Parker snuck out after he thought JJ was asleep, and he says it's not the first time it's happened, but he doesn't know where he's been going.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Kim runs into Katie, who's having a drink by herself. Katie tells Kim about Mike leaving her again, and Kim expresses her condolences but says she has an offer for Katie. She's created a new TV show called \"Oakdale Now,\" and she wants Katie to be the hostess. Katie is glad that Kim still believes in her, and Kim says hopefully soon, Katie will believe in herself again. Katie promises to consider the job offer, and Kim leaves. Vienna walks in with Brad, who asks for her credit card so he can get her checked into her room and possibly get an upgrade for her from the female desk clerk; Vienna spots Katie and goes over and starts harassing her about leaving Mike alone right after he took her back. Katie eventually stops Vienna by confessing that Mike has left her again; Vienna apologizes for her remarks, saying she'd never have said those things if she'd known that. Katie gives Vienna a hard time about her \"escort,\" and Brad walks up, asks Vienna who her friend is, and invites Katie to join them upstairs for a drink. Katie tells Vienna that she may be alone, but it's better than this. Vienna decides she's not in the mood for company and tells Brad she'd rather just go upstairs and rest tonight; when she leaves, Brad asks Katie what she said to Vienna. Katie says, \"The truth.\" Brad responds by saying now he knows why she was sitting all by herself when he first saw her.\n\n\nParker shows up at the cabin where Paul's been staying and says he wants to talk to him about his visions, because he used to have them, too. He tells Paul he had several visions when Jack was missing, but he didn't have any about his dad being shot and killed in Washington, so he couldn't warn Hal about that. Paul tells him that's not his fault, that the visions are beyond their control. Parker wants to know if all Paul ever has visions of are big things, bad things, and Paul says yes. Paul says he has a feeling right now that something really bad is happening, but he doesn't know what, and it's driving him crazy. Paul tells Parker about his dysfunctional family and says as a kid, there's not much Parker can be expected to do, but he shouldn't push away the people who love him. He then tells Parker that he needs to go home to Jack and not come back, and he gets Parker to leave. At the farm, Parker tries to sneak back inside, but Jack sees him and tells him he knows about him skipping school and sneaking out of the house at night; Parker sarcastically says, \"Wow --- you should be a detective!\" Jack tells Parker to go upstairs and they'll talk about this in the morning.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Craig tells Meg he knows about the diary and that it clears Meg of any wrongdoing; Meg is stunned to find out he knows anything about it and realizes this means he had something to do with it being found. Craig says he'll tell her everything, but not there at the hospital, and he gets her to agree to go to his place with him. When they get there, Meg says she should just tell Bob and Jack what Craig's done, but he says that won't bring the dead patient back to life, it will just stop Meg from being able to help people in the future. Meg says he's using the 1-2 punch of excuses and then justifications for what he's doing and that he's not doing this to help her, he's doing it so he can have her. Craig tells Meg there's no \"grand design\" here, he's just trying to help her keep her job because he admires her for doing the kind of work she does. When he asks what's the harm in letting him help her, she replies, \"That I might end up being like you.\" Realizing she may have actually hurt Craig's feelings, Meg apologizes. Craig says his \"disregard for traditional ethics\" is what people dislike about him, but he says there's nothing he wouldn't do to keep her being who she is, and that \"a few added lines in a diary\" is all it takes to enable Meg to continue on with her life. Craig then tells Meg that he wants her to like him, \"because if I can get you to like me, I won't be who everyone says I am.\" As she leans in close to him on the sofa, Craig tells her she's \"too close and too beautiful\" for him to remain a gentleman, and she asks what he'd do if he weren't a gentleman. He kisses her, she responds, and as she lays back on the sofa, her bracelet falls off her wrist.\n\n\nIn the cabin, Paul accidentally cuts his finger, and suddenly, he has a vision of a girl's arm with a bracelet on it, and the bracelet falls off her wrist.\n\n\n\n\n",
