Alison felt like a fool and wished she had listened to her older sister in the first place. She apologized to Emily for lying to her. Emily told Alison there was no better way for Casey to get back at her for dumping him than to break her little sister's heart. A discouraged Alison left for work. \n\n\nCasey was drinking coffee in the diner when Luke approached and wanted to know what had happened with his friend and Alison. Casey said that Alison had shut him out. When Luke asked about the rooftop meeting between the two of them, Casey had no idea what he was talking about. Luke explained how he had set up a meeting for them, and Casey was amazed. Luke said he had asked Jade to invite Casey, and she had promised to do it. The boys were stumped over why Jade had not followed through, so Luke, who had spotted Jade outside the diner, told Casey to wait while he dashed out. Jade was headed to the diner, so Luke intercepted her and began asking questions. \n\n\nMeg woke Dusty, who was sleeping on the couch in his room at the Lakeview. Meg and the baby had spent the night to avoid \"unwanted visitors\" at the farm and to escape Emma's sharp tongue. Dusty was grateful for the company, since he was desperately missing Johnny. Meg told him she was going to see Paul, but Dusty forbade it. Meg laughingly told him he could not order her around, since they weren't really married, but then she got serious and said she was determined to impress on Paul that their relationship was over. Dusty suggested she leave Eliza with him, and Meg decided to do just that. Dusty wished her luck before she left. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Barbara railed at Paul for taking part in getting Craig Montgomery named as Johnny's custodial parent. She swore she would not lose another grandchild because of Paul's hatred. Paul explained that technically Meg was still his wife, and that was the key to their finding their way back to one another. \n\n\nLuke brought Jade into the diner, and Casey asked her about not passing on Luke's message to meet Alison. Jade said she just decided not to do it, but when the boys pushed her, she admitted it was because of Casey's previous relationship with Emily. She neglected to mention that Emily was paying her to keep Alison and Casey apart. Her excuse was that she thought it was warped that Casey was interested in Alison after he had been married to her sister. She said she was only trying to help, but Casey was furious. He dashed out to find Alison and make things right. Luke reminded Jade how well he knew her and asked what the real reason was behind her not giving Casey the message. He said he knew she did not go around doing random acts of goodness, so there had to be something in it for her. She denied that she had any romantic interest in Casey herself, but Luke was upset that she had lied to him. Jade said she was willing to fix it if Luke would forgive her. \n\n\nDusty walked through the Lakeview lobby pushing Eliza in her stroller. Emily called to him and remarked about his quick step into the role of step-daddy. Dusty told her about Paul's crashing the custody hearing for Johnny, and that because of a glitch in Meg's divorce, she and Dusty were never legally married. Emily seemed truly sorry that Dusty had lost Johnny to Craig, and she tried to get him to admit that he wished he had accepted her offer of marriage. Dusty disagreed, so Emily asked if there was anything she could do for him, but again he declined. As he fed a bottle to Eliza, Emily told him to enjoy his new family, and she left. \n\n\nPaul and Barbara went shopping for Eliza, and Paul kept declaring that Meg loved only him and would come back soon. His mother warned him to back off or Meg could retaliate by denying him access to the baby. Paul said he was convinced they would be a family again, just as Meg walked in. Paul took her appearance as proof that his theory was correct, but he was disappointed she had not brought their daughter. Meg asked to speak with Paul, so Barbara went to make tea. Meg lit into Paul for his interference in the courtroom, and the two of them argued loudly. Paul claimed he had done what he did for Meg's own good. Meg was upset with those words because they were the same as what Paul had said to Jennifer when he had kept Johnny from her. Meg questioned Paul's motives, and told him she was cutting him out of her life and letting him have only limited visitation rights with Eliza. \n\n\nPaul asked why she was being so cruel. Meg tried to explain that they were no longer a family, but Paul took that to mean that Meg had betrayed him with Dusty. In desperation, Meg got sarcastic and screamed that she did love Dusty and had done so all along. Paul believed her words, so a frustrated Meg attempted to reason with him. Barbara arrived in response to the raised voices and heard Meg say she would make sure Paul would never come near her or the baby again. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Matt Connor, Casey's friend from his prison days, showed up, and failed to recognize Alison from the back. He asked if she knew where Casey Hughes was, and then Alison realized who he was. He had been released from jail and was glad to see Alison. He assumed Alison and Casey were still fast friends, but Alison said the two of them didn't hang out together that much any more. She took her break early, and suggested Matt walk with her to get some air in the park. They had just left when Casey arrived from the diner, looking for Alison. A hospital worker told him where Alison had gone. \n\n\nAlison and Matt walked in the park while she told him that Casey and Emily had struggled through a short-lived marriage. She also explained she had married Aaron and then realized it was a mistake. She was gloomy about her chances of connecting with Casey again, when suddenly she spotted Casey watching them from behind a tree. She asked Matt to kiss her, so he did. Casey saw it all, and then turned and left. Matt asked Alison what was up, so Alison told the truth and said Casey had seen them. She apologized for using Matt, who said it was obvious she had not moved on from her feelings about Casey. Alison returned to work, feeling even worse. \n\n\nBarbara attempted to comfort Paul, but he told his mother that Meg had admitted she was in love with Dusty. Barbara thought that was anger speaking, and she offered to help by contacting a good lawyer so Paul could take legal action to get visitation rights. Paul wanted immediate relief, however, and that reminded Barbara of James, and it frightened her. Then Paul asked his mother for a favor; he wanted her to pay Meg a visit and make sure that Eliza was all right. Barbara reluctantly agreed to call Meg. \n\n\nMeg went back to the Lakeview and told Dusty what had happened with Paul. She admitted she had told Paul that she wanted to be with Dusty, but Dusty was not upset. Barbara called Meg and asked to see the baby. Meg was hesitant until Barbara agreed to come to the hotel and meet Meg in the public lobby or lounge. She also promised that Paul would not show up, so Meg agreed to meet her mother-in-law in the lounge. Dusty thought that was a mistake and offered to go with her, but Meg was comfortable with the arrangement. \n\n\nCasey tried to avoid Jade in Old Town, but she caught up with him. He told her he had found Alison, but she was not in a \"talking mood.\" Jade offered to help, but Casey said any chance he and Alison had was gone. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Luke asked Alison if Casey had found her, and she replied that he had. She really didn't want to talk about it, but Luke persisted with his questions. He said Casey had never gotten the message to meet her on the roof, and Alison was horrified that she had set up the kiss with Matt. She told Luke that she and Casey were never meant to be. \n\n\nIn the Lakeview lounge, Meg brought Eliza to see Barbara. Barbara said Paul was in pain, and she begged for another chance for him. Suddenly, the lights in the hotel went out. In a few moments, the manager apologized for the inconvenience and assured the guests that the generator would kick in shortly. \n\n\nMatt found Casey in the diner, and the two boys talked. Casey had recognized his friend in the park and said he had no interest in Alison. He said Matt could do whatever he wanted with her. \n\n\nJade reported to Emily and collected her paycheck. She asked her boss if Emily had loved Casey, and Emily said she had cared very deeply for him. She said she loved her sister, too, but she did not want them to be together. Jade didn't understand, but she left without further comment. \n\n\nThe lights came on at the hotel as Dusty arrived. Meg checked on the baby, who had been sleeping peacefully in her stroller. Meg was horrified to find the stroller empty. Meanwhile, Paul walked swiftly through the park with his daughter in his arms.\n\n  \n \n\n\n",
