Lucinda warned her daughter that Damian would try to worm his way back into her life, but Lily said that Holden had assured her that Damian was gone for good.  She also promised her mother that she was finished with him herself.  Lucinda suggested that Lily get a divorce from Damian and go get Holden, if she still wanted him.  Lucinda walked out, with Lily yelling after her.\n\n\nAt Metro, Dusty called the office of the oncologist in New York whom Liberty was seeing, and he asked if the Snyder family had kept their appointment.  Teri walked in and asked Dusty if he was checking up on her relatives, but Dusty ignored her.  He was managing the club in Janet's absence, and as they worked behind the bar, Teri asked Dusty if it bothered him that Jack was in New York with Janet.  Dusty answered no, but then he suggested that she go back in the kitchen and do her job.\n\n\nSoon Dusty heard a commotion at the front door, and it was Teri screaming at a departing deliveryman who had dumped a 50 pound bag of flour at the front door.  Teri was struggling to drag it in, so Dusty tried to help, and they each picked up one end.  They tried to control it, but the bag burst, covering Dusty almost completely with flour.  Teri began to giggle, and Dusty laughed, too.  Teri grabbed a towel from the bar and began flicking the flour off.  Then Teri got on her knees and began working on Dusty's pants.\n\n\nLucinda walked in the door and took one look and muttered that she didn't even want to know what was going on.  Dusty turned around and Lucinda began laughing.  Teri excused herself, and Lucinda commented on Dusty's fondness for young women.  When Dusty protested that Teri was only \"the best chef in town,\" Lucinda asked if that meant Dusty was \"not inclined to sample her specials.\"  Dusty asked Lucinda what she wanted, and she asked him to recommend the best private investigator he knew.\n\n\nAfter Lucinda left, Teri returned to the bar and helped Dusty clean up the flour spill.  She had overheard Dusty refer to her as \"a kid,\" and that upset her.  Teri said she was able to think of Dusty not only as a boss but also as a person.  She wanted him to realize that she was a woman, as well as a chef.  Dusty was afraid that Teri had feelings for him, but she said she was thinking more about Dusty's  affection for her sister.  Teri suggested that Dusty was in love with Janet, but Dusty denied that and said Janet was not the reason that there couldn't be anything between him and Teri.  Teri walked back to the kitchen, and said that she hoped Dusty enjoyed being alone about as much as she did.\n\n\nAt the farm, Molly asked Holden again why there was blood on his shirt.  Holden lied and told her the same story about changing a tire.  Molly wanted to know exactly what had happened between Holden and Damian, and again Holden said that he had let Damian go.  He refused to change his story, and he went outside and called Lily.  He told her that Margo had the state police looking for Meg.  He also said that he thought the kids should hear the news about Damian from them, so he asked Lily to stop by the farm where Ethan and Natalie were looking at the horses with Emma.\n\n\nHolden suggested to Molly that it would be better if she were not there when Lily arrived, so she agreed to go as soon as Holden told her the truth about how he had gotten hurt.  He was in obvious pain, and Molly asked what Holden had done to Damian.  Holden told her he had done nothing and for her to let it go.  Molly was not convinced that Damian was really gone, but Holden said that he had refused to stoop to Damian's level, so he had let him leave the country.\n\n\nMolly asked Holden again to take off his shirt so that she could see the cut on his chest, and he finally complied.  The wound looked nasty, and Molly wondered what had happened.  She urged Holden to go to the hospital, but he refused.  Lily pulled up in the driveway, so Holden ran upstairs and asked Molly to tell his ex-wife that he would be down soon.  Lily walked in and immediately spotted a puddle of blood on the kitchen floor.  Molly tried to say it was \"tomato juice,\" but Lily wasn't fooled.\n\n\nHolden returned to the kitchen, and Molly saw that he was in pain, so she offered him something to drink.  He accepted a beer from her, but it hurt him to move.  Molly went outside to give Lily and Holden some privacy while they discussed how to tell the children about Damian.  Holden said that he thought they should not shuffle the kids from Lily's house to the farm, and he was willing to let them stay permanently with Lily.  Lily was worried that Damian might return, but Holden said she would \"never see Damian again.\"\n\n\nThey called in the children and offered them ice cream.  Then Holden began by reminding Ethan and Natalie that lying was never good, and he said that Damian had told some very bad lies and had also hurt some very good people.  He said their mother, Lily, was one of those people, and he explained that they were going home with Lily to try to resume normal living.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Lucinda met with a private investigator and showed him a photo of Damian Grimaldi.  The investigator knew Damian by sight, and then Lucinda passed him an envelope full of cash.  She also promised more money if he could locate Damian and make sure that he never returned to Oakdale.\n\n\nMolly went down to the docks to prowl around.  She walked along the waterfront and found an oar that had lots of blood spatters on it.  Then she heard someone coughing, so he investigated and found a small boy hiding behind a barrel.  He had a toy boat with him, so Molly asked if he was going to put it in the water.  The boy said that his name was Arthur, and he had been planning to sail his boat, but the \"men who were fighting\" had frightened him.  He said there were two men, and Molly asked if one of them had called the other \"Damian.\"  The boy nodded, so Molly showed Arthur a picture of Holden, but that frightened him even more.  He stood up and told Molly that he had seen all the blood, and he ran off.\n\n\nIn New York, Jack and Janet took Liberty to a couple of appointments with specialists, but they had some time before the next consultation.  They went to their hotel rooms, and Janet was unhappy that Liberty was so negative.  Jack unpacked his bag and took out the sweater that he had worn recently when he met Carly at the lake, and he remembered their pledging their love again.  Liberty and Janet out of Liberty's room and Liberty said that she would like to get out until her next appointment, but her mother said the girl should rest.\n\n\nJack thought it was all right for Liberty to have some time by herself, and she said there was a costume exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that she would like to see; she promised to be back in one hour.  Janet was still not convinced, so Liberty got angry and went to her room by herself.  She called Carly and was surprised to learn that Carly was also in New York on business for Monte Carlo.  Liberty asked Carly to go to the Met with her, but Carly said it was best if they stayed on opposite sides of Manhattan.\n\n\nLiberty went back into Janet and Jack's room and said she was leaving, but Janet said it was all right.  Jack had convinced her that one hour away would not hurt her, and he offered the girl cab fare and money for admission to the museum.  Liberty took off, and as she walked up the steps to the museum, she spotted a palm reader who had set up a table near the entrance.  Liberty approached her and gave her $20 and asked for a reading.  The woman took Liberty's hand and commented that her lifeline was very short.\n\n\n Liberty asked what a short lifeline meant, but the woman asked for another $20.  The woman said something rude, as Carly swooped in and plucked Liberty out of the chair and scolded the woman for cheating a child.  Carly showed the girl her hand, and Liberty noticed that Carly had an almost non-existent lifeline.  Then Carly said that she barely had one at all, but she planned to live \"forever.\"\n\n\nBack in the hotel, Jack tried to be encouraging about Liberty's prognosis, and the girl opened the door and walked in, followed by an uncomfortable-looking Carly.  Janet could not believe her eyes and asked why Carly was there.  Liberty spoke up and said she had invited Carly to go to the museum with her, and then Carly shared the story about the bogus palm reader who was ripping off the girl.  Janet swallowed her feelings and thanked Carly, who said she had to go to her lunch meeting.\n\n\nJack called downstairs to make sure there were cabs available, as Janet went into Liberty's room with her daughter.  Jack also attempted to explain to Carly that he and Janet were not sleeping together, but Carly said it was none of her business.  Jack blurted out that whenever he was alone with Janet, he felt as if he was cheating on Carly, and that devastated Carly.  She said he was telling her things that only made the situation worse.  She left in a hurry, but before long, she was knocking on the door again.\n\n\nJack opened the door and Carly said she had lost a glove.  Jack found it in the room, and as he handed it to her, he apologized for his earlier comments.  Carly closed the door herself and walked away.\n\n\nWhile Liberty was in her bathroom, Janet's cell phone rang.  Her caller was Dusty who told her that \"the bar\" missed her.  Janet smiled and replied that she missed \"the bar,\" as well.  They agreed that they would talk later, and they both hung up.\n\n\n",
