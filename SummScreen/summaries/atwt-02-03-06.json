Casey told Maddie he bet it was from another girl from St. Vincent's who Nate was supposed to be seeing, and when Nate got off the phone, Maddie quizzed him about the phone call before admitting what Casey had said to her. Nate said his sister was the \"girl from St. Vincent's,\" and then he kissed Maddie, just as Margo walked in. Maddie and Nate excused themselves to go outside for a few minutes, and when Casey came back downstairs, Margo asked him if he was jealous.

She sobbed that she wished he were still alive, but as Paul moved from out of the shadows to reveal to Jennifer that he was indeed alive, Dusty came in with Johnny, and Paul went back into hiding. Dusty was upset that Jennifer was so distraught about Paul's death, and he threatened to burn all the papers Paul had left, but Jennifer told him he shouldn't try to control her like Paul had. Jennifer told Dusty they had to go meet Barbara for dinner, and they left, with Jennifer calling out, \"Goodbye, Paul.\" When they were gone, Paul responded, \"Not goodbye, Jennifer --- not yet.\" He then grabbed dark glasses, a ski hat and a cane, called a hotel or motel and asked about room availability. He then left.\n\n\nLuke hit a young woman with his car, and as he tried to find her pulse, his parents happened upon the scene. They called an ambulance and went to the hospital to see if the woman was going to be okay and to make sure Luke was alright. Holden questioned Luke as to where he'd been, since he was supposed to be home that evening, and when Luke admitted having gone to a party, Holden assumed he'd been drinking again, even when Luke denied it. Margo arrived and told Luke he'd have to take a breathalyzer test, which Luke did willingly, passing it with no trace of alcohol. Holden apologized for jumping to the wrong conclusion, but Luke admitted he had reason to. Holden and Lily again asked Luke to please tell them what was wrong, and just as he seemed about to reveal his secret, the doctor approached and said the woman he'd hit had regained consciousness. When Holden, Lily, and Luke went into the room to see her, she looked at Lily, smiled weakly, and said, \"It's you!\"\n\n\nLisa went to see Barbara in her suite at the Lakeview, bringing flowers as a peace offering.

Lisa told Barbara that the second chance she thought she'd lost with Paul, she still had with Will.\n\n\nDownstairs at the Lakeview, Gwen tried to talk Will out of his plan to steal $1000 from Barbara's room while she was at dinner.

They waited until it was time for Barbara's dinner reservation, then they went up to her room, and Will took the money from its hiding place. Before they made it out the door, Barbara came out of her room, asking what they thought they were doing. When she realized they had stolen money from her, she said she was calling the police, but as she reached for the phone, Will pushed her away from it and she fell, hitting her head on an end table.\n\n\n",
