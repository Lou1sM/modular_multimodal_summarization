She was at a loss as to what happened, as well, and told them she had been at Fairwinds with Paul when he asked her to meet with Meg and see the baby for herself. As Dusty comforted her, Meg accused Barbara of helping Paul with the abduction. \n\n\nJosie went to the front desk of the Lakeview to leave a letter for Dusty. In it, she said it was time for her to move on, since it was apparent he had no room in his life for her, and she wished him well. She handed the note to the clerk, and left. In her car on the road, she was stunned to find Paul and Eliza hiding in the back seat. When Josie questioned Paul, he told her to shut up and drive. \n\n\nCarly began fixing dinner for Parker when the boy told her he was going to a friend's house to work on a science project and would spend the night. Carly was perturbed that her son had announced his plans rather than asking for permission. When Parker remedied that, Carly gave him permission. She had no idea Parker was really headed for a Metallica concert in Chicago. When she realized she would be by herself, Carly put the uncooked meal back into the freezer and headed to Old Town. She ran into Craig and Johnny, and the boy asked to go to Carly's house. She remembered the food she hadn't cooked for Parker, and offered Johnny French fries, and he was delighted. The three of them went to Carly's. \n\n\nLiberty took a call from Parker, who was waiting for her in Old Town. She asked for a minute to make her \"escape,\" and then asked Janet if she could spend the night at her friend Sasha's house. Janet agreed, so Liberty said goodbye and left. She met Parker, who told her they were getting to Chicago in a limo rented by an older friend. They took off for the Windy City. \n\n\nJosie tried to tell Paul that he could not just take the baby without Meg's permission, and declared that she was turning the car around and heading back to Oakdale. Paul put a gun to her head and told her to keep driving. Josie told him she didn't think he was crazy, only hurting, and Paul said sarcastically that she thought she had a chance with Dusty, too, and she was wrong. \n\n\nJack and some other cops arrived at the Lakeview, and Meg collapsed in his arms. He began asking questions, and then he instructed Barbara to call Paul at Fairwinds. Paul did not answer, so Jack put the usual police procedures in motion, including a search of Fairwinds. He reassured Meg they would find her daughter. No one could imagine where Paul would have taken the baby, since all his cars were at home. Jack told Meg to keep her phone on and to get some rest. \n\n\nAt the diner, a woman came in to pick up an order, and Janet recognized her as the mother of Liberty's friend, Sasha, with whom Liberty was spending the night. The woman mentioned that her daughter was in Indiana visiting a sick grandmother, so Janet clued in that Liberty had pulled another fast one on her. She drove to Carly's and asked if Liberty or Parker was there, and then she and Carly compared notes and tried not to panic. Craig was still there, as Johnny had fallen asleep after dinner, and he spoke up and said there was a good probability that the two teens were together. Carly asked how he would know, so Craig admitted he had given Parker some money as a reward for doing toy shopping for Johnny. He said Parker had mentioned something about concert tickets. Janet blurted out, \"Metallica!\" and they realized their kids had gone to Chicago. Each mother vowed to kill Craig, who didn't see that he had done anything wrong. Craig offered to go to Chicago to bring back the teens and asked if Carly wanted to go with him. Carly had to remind him that he had a small boy sleeping upstairs. Janet thought Craig was crazy, but she agreed to stay with Johnny until they returned. \n\n\nJanet called Jack, who told her he was having a rough night. Janet said it wasn't about to get much better. She told him what stunt the kids had pulled. Jack was furious, both with the teens and with Craig for handing out money to Parker, and said he wanted to be there when the kids got home. He left work and went to Carly's. \n\n\nMeg agonized over her missing baby and blamed herself. Dusty said Paul had set everything in motion, and Dusty asked what he could do. Meg simply asked him to keep her from falling apart. She paced the floor until Dusty made her lie down, and he lay next to her. He comforted her by telling her Paul was always gentle with Eliza and would never hurt her. Meg just prayed that Eliza was all right. \n\n\nWhen Jack got to Carly's, Janet sensed that something was troubling her husband other than the dustup with the children. Before she could ask about it, Johnny appeared, asking for his dad. Janet put him back to sleep on the couch. \n\n\nIn Josie's car, Paul's phone kept ringing, but it was always from Barbara, and he refused to answer. Josie suggested that his mother might not be so worried if he answered and said he and the baby were okay, so Paul took a call. Barbara was shocked when Paul answered and told him Eliza was fine. Barbara asked him to come back and explained that he could not just take the baby away. Paul shouted that Eliza was his little girl, and she belonged to him. He suggested Meg go have other babies with Dusty. Barbara told her son that he was not thinking clearly, but Paul told her to quit calling. He said if she went to the police, she would never see either him or Eliza again. He reminded her he was James Stenbeck's son and hung up. \n\n\nCraig and Carly brought the teens back and found Jack and Janet waiting. Jack warned Craig that if he crossed the line with Parker one more time, Jack would slap him with a restraining order. Craig promised never to interfere again. Jack mentioned that he had to continue looking for Eliza, and everyone was shocked that the baby was missing. Jack left, followed closely by Janet and Liberty. Carly sent Parker to his room and offered to let the sleeping Johnny stay. Craig asked if he could stay, too, and Carly agreed, but told him to go tuck himself in. \n\n\nA room service waiter brought coffee for Meg and handed Dusty the note Josie had left for him at the desk. Dusty saw that it was from Josie, but he did not take the time to read it. Meg wanted to go to the police station to see if there was any news, so they left. \n\n\nJosie stopped the car in the morning and said she was exhausted. They were in Brooklyn, New York, and it was snowing. Paul threatened again to shoot her if she got out of the car, but Josie was desperate and got out anyway. Paul followed her and admitted his \"gun\" was nothing but a baby bottle covered with a blanket. Josie was furious, but Paul asked her to listen to his story before she called the police. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Jack was discouraged that there had been no leads on Paul and the baby. Meg and Dusty arrived and were also disappointed. Dusty asked if the police had searched underground at Fairwinds, and Meg remembered the extensive tunnel system under the estate. Jack had forgotten that, so they left to continue the search. They came up with nothing, and Meg had a meltdown. Dusty took her back to the hotel and tried to get her to sleep. He finally read Josie's note and then tried to call her. He got no answer, so he left a voice mail. \n\n\nJosie and Paul went to a clinic where they knew they could get some milk for the baby. A television crew was there filming a reality show, and the nurse assumed they were part of the cast. Josie sat down and fed Eliza, and both fell asleep. Paul wandered around looking for snacks, but he returned when he heard Josie's phone. He listened to the message from Dusty and then deleted it and turned off the phone. \n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Parker apologized to his mother, but she lit into him, and when Craig tried to help, she warned him not to tell her how to raise her child. Carly sent Parker back upstairs, and when he passed Craig, Craig asked how the concert was. That was the last straw for Carly, and she ordered Craig out. She was tired of how he kept egging on and enabling the teens, and she was ready to agree with Jack, who thought Craig should be nowhere near their children. Craig picked up Johnny and went out. \n\n\nIn New York, Paul woke Josie from the couch and took her and Eliza into a dressing room, where they had some privacy. Josie fell right back to sleep, so Paul took the baby and sat down to hold his sleeping Eliza.\n\n\n",
