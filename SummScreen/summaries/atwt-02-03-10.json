Casey was worried about her, and Alison admitted that she was having difficulty sleeping because of weird dreams.  Casey had a meeting with his father, so he left, while Alison lay down to rest.  She could not relax, so she did some yoga, but she still tossed and turned.  She remembered her dream of going to the old church with Mick, and she put on her boots and left the house.\n\n\nAlison walked to the old church and went up to the belfry.  She called out to Mick, but he was not there.  She found his scarf on the floor and picked it up and pressed it to her face.  She sat down for a long while, holding the scarf in her lap.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Casey went to meet his dad, and he said how pleased he was that Tom and Margo had welcomed Alison into their family.  Tom said that he was very proud of Casey, and they began talking about Casey's goal to be an attorney.  Tom cautioned his son about the challenges facing him because of his criminal record, and Casey seemed surprised and discouraged.  He asked Tom for more details, and his father said that the District Attorney and members of the city council might decide to weigh in on the issue of Casey's morals and ethics.  Casey was afraid that his being an ex-con would hang over him for the rest of his life.\n\n\nLater, Alison returned to the Hughes home, and she told a worried Casey that she had just gone for a walk.  She was shaking, but she blamed it on the cold weather.  Casey held her, and Alison asked him not to let go.  They went to their bedroom, and Casey told her about Tom's remarks.  He was concerned that getting approval from community members would be a nightmare.  Alison said that they would do whatever it took to let Casey achieve his dream.\n\n\nCarly was surprised when she went home after returning from New York, and Jack opened the door for her.  He said that they had flown back earlier, but his conversation with Carly was strained.  Then Jack mentioned that they needed to discuss the children's winter school break, so they went to the kitchen to make coffee.  Jack found his favorite old Chicago Cubs mug, and he remembered how he and Carly had gone to a game several years before.  Carly was uncomfortable walking down memory lane, so Jack switched the talk to a discussion of a ski trip for Sage.\n\n\nBoth Carly and Jack thought Sage would enjoy the trip with another family, and then they turned to Parker.  Jack said that Parker's plans were probably on hold until he knew when he could remove the brace on his leg, and Carly thought that their son would want to stick around home to be near Liberty, anyway.  Jack agreed, and then he apologized again for what he had said to Carly in New York about feeling unfaithful to her every time he was alone with his wife.  Someone rang the doorbell, and Carly went to answer it.  Jack heard her say, \"Hello, Janet.\"\n\n\nJanet asked to speak to Carly, and explained that the doctors in New York had suggested that they build a support team around Liberty while she was undergoing treatment for her leukemia.  Janet hoped that Carly would pitch in to help, and Carly instantly agreed.  Janet admitted that Liberty had caught her mother watching her sleep, and it had frightened the girl even more.  Janet cried and said that she had no time to feel sorry for herself because she had to focus on her daughter.\n\n\nCarly volunteered to involve Liberty in a design project, and Janet thought that was a fine idea.  Jack listened to the conversation from the kitchen, and he agonized to hear the two women he loved put aside their feelings to support Liberty.  Janet left, and Jack appeared from the kitchen.  He said that he had stayed in there so that Janet would not \"jump to conclusions.\"  The two of them agreed that more had been going on between them than a simple cup of coffee, and Carly asked Jack what they were going to do.\n\n\nBoth of them admitted that they couldn't stay away from each other, and Carly cried and said that she needed to not love Jack so much.  Jack thanked her for helping Liberty, but Carly told him that she could see no \"us\" in the future.  Both of them were close to tears as Jack took his leave.\n\n\nJack went to the farm, and he told Janet that he had \"run some errands.\"  She told him that she had gone to see Carly to ask Carly to be part of Liberty's team.  Jack said that he was fine with that, and Janet said that she needed to be reassured that she didn't have anything else to worry about besides getting her daughter well.  Jack said there was nothing else to concern herself about, and Janet said how much she needed to hear that.\n\n\nAt home, Carly threw Jack's Cubs mug into the trash.\n\n\nMick walked into Fairwinds and saw an invitation for Emily to attend Alison's bridal shower.  It shocked him, and he dropped his bag on the floor.  Emily arrived home and almost tripped over Mick's bag.  She looked at it and suddenly remembered seeing Mick with the bag, and she realized that it had contained photos of Paul as a child and young man.  She turned and found Mick standing right behind her, and he frightened her.\n\n\nEmily said that seeing Mick's bag had triggered some sort of vague memory that had to do with something that had happened to her just before she had blacked out in her coma.  Mick asked her if she was listening, and then he looked directly into her eyes and said that sometimes memories were too painful to remember.  It was time \"to get the ball rolling,\" he said, and to focus on getting a baby with Paul.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Barbara and Paul argued about Mick.  Barbara wanted Paul to give the young man another chance, and she asked her son to trust her on that.  Paul asked if Barbara knew something about Mick that he didn't, but Barbara stopped him.  Paul continued by saying that something \"odd\" had been going on between his mother and Mick ever since Mick had been \"sticking her with his needle.\"  Paul demanded to know what it was, but they had reached Fairwinds, so he warned Barbara that their conversation on that subject was not over.\n\n\nEmily and Mick were sitting in the living room, and Paul was pleased that they were both there.  Barbara excused herself to go upstairs and visit Eliza, as Paul asked what was going on.  Emily said that everything was wonderful, and she was ready to focus on their future and making their baby.  \"It's time to get the ball rolling,\" parroted Emily, and Mick smiled.  Paul could not believe that Emily was still fixated on having a child, and he reminded her that she had just awakened from a coma and a stay in the hospital.\n\n\nMick spoke up and said that Emily was ready, but Paul challenged him by reminding Mick that he was not a physician.  He asked to have a private conversation with his wife, so Mick left the room.  Barbara returned, however, and Paul asked her, too, for alone time with Emily.  Barbara and Mick left Fairwinds, and Emily bluntly asked Paul if he no longer wanted to have a baby with her.  Paul stated that nothing was worth risking Emily's health, but Emily repeated that it was \"time to get the ball rolling.\"\n\n\nPaul suggested that Emily get a full medical workup at the hospital before they even thought about getting pregnant, but Emily said that Mick had said that she was fine.  Paul yelled that Mick was not a doctor, and all Paul wanted was to keep her safe.  Paul then picked up his coat and said he would be back soon.  He ran out the door, and Emily began to sob.\n\n\nBarbara and Mick went to her room in the hotel, and she asked him when he would tell Paul the truth.  Mick answered that he would tell their son when the time was right.  He said his living at Fairwinds gave him the advantage of keeping an eye on Paul.  Barbara believed that there was \"more to the story,\" however, and she was curious as to how Mick had managed to have Emily not remember that she was with him just before she had slipped into a coma.  Mick's only answer was that he could be \"very persuasive.\"  Then Barbara brought up the subject of Alison Stewart, and Mick got visibly upset.\n\n\nBarbara accused Mick of \"chasing Alison around the bleachers like a school boy,\" and Mick reached into his pocket and handed Barbara a jeweler's box that he opened to reveal a large diamond ring.  Barbara took it and asked what the occasion was, and he asked her to read the inscription.  It said, \"From J to B with eternal love.\"  Mick said the ring was a token of his \"appreciation and undying affection.\"  Barbara asked what the catch was, but Mick assured her that there were \"no strings attached.\"  Barbara slipped the ring on her finger.\n\n\nBarbara answered a knock on her door, and Paul burst in and grabbed Mick around the throat.  He screamed at Mick, and asked him what Mick had done to Emily, but Mick said only that he had told her that she was ready to get pregnant.  Paul was furious, and he told Mick to \"back off\" immediately.  Barbara ordered Paul to let Mick go, so Paul released him, but Paul warned Mick not to interfere in Paul's life.  Mick promised not to \"cross that line again,\" and he excused himself and left.\n\n\nBarbara asked Paul \"what the hell\" he was doing, and Paul said that he was defending his family.  He suggested that Barbara try it some time, herself.  She said that she had faith in Mick Dante, and then Paul noticed the ring on his mother's finger. He asked if Mick had given it to her, and he jerked it from her finger.  Paul read the inscription but could not figure out who \"J\" was.  Barbara lied that Mick had found it in an antique shop, but Paul did not believe her.  He demanded to know who Mick Dante was, and Barbara cried that she could not tell him.\n\n\nMick returned to Fairwinds and spoke to Emily.  He asked what was going on, and Emily explained that she and Paul had fought about the baby.  Mick said that Emily could make that decision herself since it was her body involved.  Emily said she couldn't get pregnant by herself, so Mick said that if Paul was not willing to give her a baby right away, then he would.\n\n\n",
