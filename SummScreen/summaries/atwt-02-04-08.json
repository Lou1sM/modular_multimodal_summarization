Barbara wakes when the two come in and they thank her for watching Hallie. Gwen goes into the bedroom to check on the baby and finds the crib empty. She rushes back into the living room frantically asking where Hallie has gone. Will asks his mom how she could let this happen and Barbara is at first confused, but then realizes Sofie must have taken Hallie. She tells Will and Gwen about Sofie's earlier attempt to see Hallie and concludes that Sofie must have returned and taken the baby while she slept. Gwen is convinced that if she calls Sofie that she will bring Hallie back. She tries to phone Sofie, but Sofie refuses to pick up. Will and Gwen decide to go to the Lakeview to look for Sofie, while Barbara agrees to stay at the house to wait for any news. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Sofie exits the elevator at the Lakeview holding Hallie. She comforts the baby girl and reassures her that everything will be okay, since Sofie is her mother. Later we see Sofie sitting on a bus and holding her baby as she ignores all calls from Gwen. \n\n\nWill and Gwen arrive at the Lakeview to look for Sofie and run into Aaron, who is getting off work at the Lakeview bar. He learns from the two that Sofie has taken Hallie and agrees to help them look for their baby girl. In a desperate attempt to find Sofie and Hallie, the three go upstairs to Sofie's room and Aaron lets them in with a master key. They search the room and find Sofie has packed up all of her things and they now firmly believe she has run away with Hallie. Aaron agrees to call Sofie to find out where she is. When Sofie sees the call is from Aaron, she decides to pick up. The two start out having a normal conversation, but when Aaron asks her if she took Hallie, Sofie tells him that the baby is hers and she has every right to be with her. Aaron asks her where she is and all Sofie will tell him is that she has the baby and they are never coming back to Oakdale. \n\n\nWill, Gwen, and Aaron go to the police station and tell Margo that Sofie has taken Hallie. They explain the entire story and Margo tells them she will issue a statewide Amber alert for Sofie and Hallie. A distraught Will and Gwen aren't convinced that Margo has done enough, but she explains the procedure and then sends them home to wait for news. Aaron stays behind to help in the search for Sofie. \n\n\nWill and Gwen arrive home and find Barbara crying. Will scolds his mother for falling asleep while watching their baby. She leaves the two after they promise to call with any news about the baby. Alone in their home, Gwen explains to Will that she knows why Sofie took the baby and remembers how she felt when she took Johnny from Carly. Gwen blames herself for letting Sofie have so much time with Hallie, but Will tries to persuade her that it isn't her fault. Aaron arrives at the house and tells the two that he believes he knows how to find Sofie. He explains she once ran away to Chicago, and gives Will and Gwen the address where he found her before. The two decide to go to Chicago to see if Sofie has returned there. \n\n\nPaul and Emily arrive at Chris's hotel room and they let themselves in with the key Emily had when she lived with Chris. The two discuss their plan to put a listening device in Chris's room in the hopes he admits he is behind Dusty's murder and Bob's poisoning. While in the room, Emily hears Chris coming down the hall and Paul hides in the closet. When Chris opens the door, he is angry to find Emily in his room and immediately tells her to get out. Emily tells Chris she is there to apologize and she misses him. Chris refuses to believe her and tells her to leave, but Emily tries to seduce Chris. He is reluctant to accept her apology and sexual advances at first, but when she continues to come on to him, Chris relents. The two begin to make love and the entire time Emily tries to convince Chris that she never believed the terrible things Dusty said about Chris poisoning Bob. Chris strips Emily of most of her clothes and then abruptly stops kissing her and asks, \"Where's the bug?\" A shocked Emily denies spying on Chris, but he doesn't believe her and starts to tear the room apart looking for a listening device. Emily tries to get him to stop, but Chris finds the bug behind the headboard and grabs Emily. She yells for him to let go, as Paul rushes out of the closet and tells Chris to get his hands off of Emily. The two men begin to fight, but Emily breaks it up. Both men threaten to call the police, but instead Chris throws the pair out. \n\n\nPaul and Emily head downstairs, where Emily explains to Paul that she and Chris had a deal not to tell anyone what they knew about the other's involvement with Dusty. She is convinced that now that Chris knows she has told Paul, he will tell the police about her problems with Dusty. Emily explains that they need to find the lab tech who was running tests for Dusty so they can prove that Chris was involved with poisoning his father and killing Dusty. Paul wants to go to the police, but Emily initially refuses, since she knows that Chris could reveal her past as a prostitute. \n\n\nEmily heeds Paul's advice and heads to the station to talk to Margo. She tells Margo that there may be a link between Dusty's murder and Bob's stroke. Emily explains that Dusty believed that Chris was trying to incapacitate his father so he could take over the hospital. Margo tells Emily that they have been trying to contact the lab tech Dusty was working with, but have been unable to get ahold of him. Margo is curious why Emily has waited so long to come to her with this information. Emily tells her she couldn't say anything before because she had a deal with Chris, but finally reveals the truth of her prostitution to Margo. A shocked Margo is doubtful of Chris's involvement in Bob's stroke and then criticizes Emily for making such bad choices. Margo and Emily are certain they need to find the lab tech to find if he has evidence to exonerate Holden and Emily, or if the evidence might pin suspicion on Chris. \n\n\nPaul waits at the Lakeview and overhears a meeting between Chris and Evan in the hotel bar. Chris details his latest run-in with Emily and Paul and both he and Evan agree that Emily's allegations could cause problems for their joint venture, Memo 21. Evan voices the idea that Emily must be taken care of, but Chris thinks that his warning will keep her from making any trouble for the two. \n\n\nNoah and Luke enjoy a coffee at Java, and Noah tries to comfort Luke as he stresses over his father's arrest. Noah encourages Luke to focus on helping his mom and dad. As the two are talking, a friend of Luke's from college, Reg, comes into Java and Luke introduces him to Noah. Luke explains that Reg is the president of the Oakdale University alliance for homosexuals. Reg invites Luke and Noah to a friend's house for a weekend getaway with other gay couples and gives the two a moment to talk it over. Noah thinks the time away at the lake house, might be just what Luke needs to relax. The two are also excited by the idea of getting a chance to share a bed together. They discuss their relationship and the lack of alone time they have. Luke tells Noah how much he loves him and wants to be with him, but he is worried about going away when his father is being accused of Dusty's murder. Noah is understanding and realizes that this isn't the time for a romantic getaway. \n\n\nLater in Old Town, Luke tells Noah that he called his dad, and Holden told him to go ahead and go on the trip with Noah. Luke is excited at the prospect of meeting other gay couples and spending time alone with his boyfriend. Noah is equally thrilled with the prospect of a passionate weekend with Luke. The two run into Reg and his boyfriend, Tony, and tell them they will happily accept Reg's invitation to the lake house. Noah heads out to pick up supplies for a class as Luke continues to talk with Reg and Tony about the upcoming trip. Luke looks a bit apprehensive after hearing the two describe the parties that take place at the lake. Noah returns to find Luke alone and when Luke explains that the party sounds a bit wild, the two decide they will leave the partying to the other boys and just focus on getting a little alone time. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Noah and Luke decide not to go to the party. They feel that it really isn't their crowd and that their time together will be better spent once Holden is cleared of harming Dusty and they can focus on each other with friends they have more in common with. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Lily and Holden try to figure out how to clear Holden of the charges of Dusty's murder. Lily asks Holden to let her get one of Lucinda's attorneys to represent him, but Holden refuses because he fears they will make him accuse Lily. Holden reassures his wife he isn't going to jail, but more importantly he will make sure she is never a suspect. Lily admits to Holden that it is hard to get used to him being on her side since just weeks ago they were bitterly fighting. Holden remarks that everything has changed and they need to focus on their family. Just then, Lily receives a phone call from an unknown number and the man on the other end tells her he has a message for her from Dusty Donavan. Lily wants to know who the man is and he explains he is Neil Perkins, the lab tech Dusty hired to analyze Bob's coffee cup. He explains that he can't go to the police with the information he has and that Dusty had told him to go to her in case anything happened to him. He asks Lily to meet him at Yo's in twenty minutes and warns her to come alone. Lily thinks this might be the break they have been waiting for and tries to go alone, but agrees to take Holden with her to meet Neil to find out what information he has. \n\n\nAt Yo's, Lily and Holden wait anxiously for Neil to arrive. While the two sit in the bar, Lily relates her last experience at Yo's to Holden and explains that this is where she started her day the time she overdosed. As the wait continues, they begin to doubt Neil is coming, but a stranger arrives with a note from Neil telling her that she was supposed to come alone. Her phone rings again and Neil tells her that she has once last chance to meet him alone at his car or he will disappear with the information. Holden is reluctant to let Lily go by herself, but she convinces him she can do it. \n\n\nLily arrives at the man's car, but finds he is not there. Lily waits for a time alone and is startled by Holden when he grabs her shoulder. She tells him she wanted to do this on her own. He explains she has been waiting long enough and he believes she is being set up. Holden notices the man's car is unlocked and finds his keys inside the car. Holden uses the keys to open the trunk and finds Neil inside. Neil is obviously injured and might even be dead. \n\n\n",
