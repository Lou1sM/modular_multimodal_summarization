He explained to the crew that they had to knock before they used their key, and they had to wait in the living room until Brad and Katie made an appearance. Katie said she wasn't sure she could take all the intrusion into their privacy, but Brad announced he had a plan. He and Katie went into the living room in their bathrobes and suggested the crew set up in the bedroom. When the crew left the living room, Brad and Katie shed the robes, and, fully dressed, they made their escape. \n\n\nVienna and Henry had breakfast at the Lakeview and discussed how their puppy, Pepper, had gotten way too fond of \"people food\" and how he had also failed obedience school. They argued about whether the dog should be allowed to eat table scraps, and then the conversation rapidly turned to children. Henry was afraid any children he and Vienna might have would spend the majority of their lives in therapy. That comment, however, offended Vienna. Henry took a call about Metro business, as Vienna packed up the extra breakfast food and stashed it in her purse. \n\n\nMeg dreamed she heard Eliza crying and awoke in a panic. Dusty comforted her until his phone rang. The call was from a hostile Holden, who insisted his sister come home to be with family. He would not listen to Dusty and said he was on his way to get Meg. Holden spoke with Lily as he was leaving, and he did not disguise his disgust for Dusty. \n\n\nJosie awoke and saw Paul still sleeping. She checked her phone, but it was not operational. Then she noticed that Paul was holding up the battery. The two of them argued about his treatment of Meg, and Josie said she was no longer going to be a part of the abduction. Paul grabbed her and asked what made her think she had any choice in the matter. Josie asked if he was going to hold another baby bottle to her head. He was bitter about Dusty's marriage to Meg, and told Josie she was in for the duration. He explained that if she sold him out to the cops, he would tell them everything was her idea. Josie pleaded with him to do the right thing for the baby's sake, otherwise, she was leaving. She gave him an ultimatum: he had one hour to call the police or she would tell them herself. Their raised voices woke Eliza, who began to cry. \n\n\nHolden arrived at Dusty's room, and Dusty opened the door. Before he let Holden in, however, Dusty cautioned him that Meg really wanted to stay with Dusty. The two men argued until Meg called a halt and decided to leave with her brother. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to the Lakeview and saw Henry and Vienna at breakfast. Brad told Vienna they were being stalked, but Katie admitted it was of their own doing. They explained the concept of the new television show Kim had envisioned and said they were trying to conceive a baby. Vienna was excited, but Henry appeared less than enthusiastic. Brad went to get a room, while Vienna gushed to Katie about how wonderful babies were. When Henry made some negative comments, his beloved \"pepparkakor\" accused him of being a \"miserable old grouch.\" Brad returned, discouraged; there was a convention in town and not a room at the hotel to be had. \n\n\nSuddenly, the film crew came through the lobby, so Vienna grabbed Brad and Katie, and the four of them scooted for the elevator. They went to Henry's room and discussed ways of stalling the crew. Katie said they really had to honor their promise to Kim to cooperate, but then Henry mentioned that if the crew was filming Vienna and him, they would have some spectacular shots, perhaps some only suitable for cable. He suggested he and Vienna dress like Brad and Katie and try to buy Brad and Katie some really private time. Vienna got one of her blonde wigs from their role-playing escapades, and Henry put on Brad's clothes. \n\n\nLily knocked on Dusty's door, and Dusty explained that Holden and Meg were long gone. Dusty blamed himself for pushing Paul over the edge, but Lily tried to make him feel better. They rode down in the elevator, and Dusty was gloomy and disconsolate. He was missing Johnny and felt Meg no longer needed him. He said goodbye to Lily and went back to his room. \n\n\nIn New York, Josie could find no one else around the studio. Paul approached and asked her to listen to him. He wanted her to give him one week with his daughter, and then he promised to return the baby to her mother. No one needed to know that Josie was involved. He pleaded for a chance with Eliza, and Josie could see that he loved the little girl, and it was unlikely he would ever harm her. She made him promise again that he would give back the baby in one week, and they made a deal. They went into an empty control room, and while Paul danced with the baby, Josie spotted a telephone under some file folders. They put Eliza in her stroller and talked about Josie's plans. She said she needed a break from the human race, and Paul said he sometimes felt that way, also. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna came into the hotel lobby dressed like Katie and Brad, and as soon as the film crew spotted them, they ran out. They went to Brad's house and enjoyed their new roles so much they decided to add them to their play list. Vienna suggested she play Katie as \"bubbly,\" and she assigned Henry the role of \"dumb Brad.\" He complained that he was too smart to play dumb well, but Vienna reminded him of some of his dumber moves in the past. He resented that, but said he would give the role a try. As they were doing a humorous parody of Brad and Katie, the doorbell rang. Henry and Vienna dashed for the bedroom, knowing the crew would use their key and enter. The couple faked lovemaking while the cameras rolled. The crew broke for lunch, while Henry, wearing only his boxers, checked out the house. \n\n\nVienna got solemn when the conversation turned to getting pregnant, and she asked Henry, again, why he was opposed to having babies with her. He said it was because of the diner, and Metro, and their puppy. He especially did not want to give up their role-playing fantasies, but Vienna suggested a new game: mommy and daddy. Vienna whipped off her Katie wig and declared she was serious; she wanted to get pregnant. Henry asked her how long she had been thinking about marriage, but Vienna said marriage was not in the equation. Either they loved each other, or they did not. Henry was trying to be a realist, but his experiences raising his siblings had broken his heart. Vienna was willing to take a chance, but Henry was not. He flatly refused to give her a baby, so Vienna said she would find someone who would. \n\n\nIn Henry's room at the Lakeview, Brad and Katie took full advantage of the big empty bed and made love. They pondered whether they had already made a baby. Brad talked to his \"kid,\" and the two had some tender moments. \n\n\nPaul left Eliza with Josie while he went to make a bottle, so Josie took the stroller and went back to the control room. She quickly called Dusty and told him the baby was all right and that Meg would get her back, but she had to be patient. Dusty demanded to know where Josie was, but she would not say, and hung up. She looked up and saw Paul standing and watching her, and Josie realized he had set her up to see if she would use the phone. Paul said he needed to see if he could trust her. \n\n\nAt the farm, Lily and Holden talked with Meg. Meg was worried that the baby would not eat properly, but Holden had the same concerns about his sister. Dusty knocked on the door and told Meg that he had heard from Josie, and she was most likely with Paul. He reported that Eliza was safe, and Meg would get her back soon. Holden offered to call Jack, while Lily questioned why Josie was with Paul.\n\n\n",
