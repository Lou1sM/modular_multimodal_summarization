Mick said that the goal was for Emily to carry a healthy baby to term while living with Paul and to allow him to believe that the child was his.  Emily refused to entertain that idea, and she began to cry.  She knew that she would have to undergo in vitro treatments, and Paul certainly would know that he hadn't made a \"contribution.\"  Mick said to remember that anything was possible.\n\n\nWhen Emily was reluctant to go for Mick's scheme, he looked her in the eyes and said, \"Are you listening, Emily?\"  Those words put Emily into hypnotic receptiveness, as Mick continued to tell her that if she was happy about the baby, then Paul would be happy.  Mick assured Emily that being pregnant was what she wanted.  Emily asked how soon she could be pregnant, and Mick answered, \"Within a few days.\"  Emily wanted to discuss it with Paul, but Mick said that if she went with him to do the procedure immediately, she would not regret it.\n\n\nMick asked Emily once again if she was listening, and then he convinced her that the baby would belong to both Emily and Paul.  They began to leave, but Emily suddenly remembered  that Alison's bridal shower  was taking place within the hour at the Lakeview.  She said to Mick that she had to support her sister who was getting married.  Mick got angry and said that marriage was not going to happen.  Then he reminded her that they had to harvest Emily's eggs that day, but she could attend the shower after the procedure.  Mick mentioned that they were not going to Memorial but to a small clinic to preserve Emily's privacy.\n\n\nEmily was still hesitant and said that something just didn't seem right.  Mick repeated \"Are you listening, Emily?\" and then told her to tell everyone that the pregnancy was what she had always wanted.  The two of them left Fairwinds and went to the clinic where Mick prepared to harvest Emily's eggs.  Emily was on an exam table and was covered by a sheet; she acknowledged that she was ready.  Mick lifted the sheet and picked up a hypodermic syringe.\n\n\nCasey asked his folks about the recipient of a gaily wrapped package on their kitchen table, and Margo said it was a present for Alison's bridal shower that day at the Lakeview.  Casey knew the nurses at the hospital were throwing a shower for his fianc\u00e9e on the weekend, and when he mentioned that, Margo was irked at Susan Stewart for not combining the showers into one.  She asked Casey to get Alison to the Lakeview in half an hour, and then Alison walked out from the bedroom.\n\n\nMargo hid the present under her coat and said she had to run.  Tom suggested that the young people head over to the Lakeview to get some lunch, but Alison began to get suspicious.  She agreed to go because no one there could cook very well, but she warned Casey that if someone yelled \"Surprise!\" in her vicinity, he was in deep trouble.\n\n\nAt the hotel, only Margo, Lisa, and Susan were in attendance.  Lisa told them to look on the bright side; the mother and mother-in-law of the bride were both there and seemingly getting along.  Alison and Casey walked in, and the women yelled \"Surprise!\"  Alison gave Casey a look, but she was gracious.  She asked where Emily was, and Susan said that she must be running late.  Lisa threw out Casey, and they turned to the presents.\n\n\nUpstairs in the Lakeview in his mother's room, Paul examined more closely the ring he had pulled off Barbara's finger.  He asked again who the \"J\" in the inscription referred to, but Barbara said she didn't know.  Paul insisted that she knew more than she was telling, and he angrily yelled that he would go find out for himself who Mick Dante really was.  Barbara grabbed her coat and followed her son to Fairwinds, where she walked in to hear Paul leaving a message for Emily on her phone.\n\n\nPaul spotted Mick's bag and opened it and looked through it.  He was desperate to get a straight answer about who Mick was, and he worried that Mick might in some way hurt his wife.  Paul listened to his mother go on about how much Emily wanted a baby with him, but then Paul said that Mick's presence in their lives had put a damper on everything.  He told Barbara that he had found photos of himself as a child in Mick's room, and he asked her for one good reason why Mick Dante would have pictures of James Stenbeck and his family in his possession.  Barbara hedged and said she was sure that Mick would reveal all in good time, and then she made her exit.\n\n\nAlison began opening her presents at the mini-shower, and Lisa brought sex into the conversation.  That made Margo uncomfortable, so she kept shoving presents at Alison and hoping they did not contain lingerie.  Kim's present was a set of towels monogrammed with the initial \"H.\"  Susan sneered and declared it presumptuous of Kim to think that Alison would change her name to Hughes.  Lisa, on the other hand, was sure that Alison couldn't wait to be a Hughes.  The bride-to-be said she hadn't even thought about it, and she looked up and saw Mick Dante grinning at her in a doorway.  Alison excused herself to go to the ladies' room, while Lisa chewed out the other two guests for ruining the party.\n\n\nAlison dragged Mick out to the lobby to be away from the shower guests, and he told her that he hadn't meant to interrupt the festivities.  She thanked him for that, but then Mick said that he thought Alison was putting on a good show for the ladies.  He said he knew that she would rather be somewhere else with someone else.  Mick pulled Alison into an elevator, and then he shut it down. He claimed he was \"saving\" her, but Alison demanded to be let out.  Mick said she was not ready for marriage, and she was hiding something.\n\n\nAlison protested that Mick was confusing her, but he said that he wanted to save her from \"a trap.\"  He told her he had visited the bell tower and knew she had held his scarf because he could smell her scent on it.  He claimed that he knew she was as drawn to him as he was to her, and he only asked that she give him one night before she resigned her life away.  They almost kissed, but Alison pulled back and started the elevator again.\n\n\nEmily arrived at the shower and asked where the guest of honor was.  Susan was concerned because Alison had been gone so long, but Lisa interrupted Emily by telling her that she looked a little flushed.  Emily began to giggle and announced that she was going to have a baby.  She asked for Alison because she wanted to celebrate.  Lisa and Margo went to look for Alison, and Susan told Emily to tell her precisely what she had done that day.  Emily grinned and told her mother that she had her eggs harvested, and it was what she had always wanted.\n\n\nBarbara walked through the lobby on her way to her room in the Lakeview and saw Mick and Alison exit the elevator.  Alison started back to join the ladies, but Barbara grabbed her by the arm.  Barbara asked what Alison had been doing with Mick, but just them Lisa and Margo walked up.  Barbara slipped away, but Lisa asked what had happened.  Alison said she had gotten stuck in the elevator, and Margo directed Lisa to have it checked right away.  Susan said she was taking Emily home, and the two of them left.\n\n\nEmily and her mother walked into Fairwinds, and Susan got on her soapbox and said how irresponsible it was for Emily and Paul to begin the in vitro process with Emily's having a recent hospitalization.  Paul said that they had decided to put that project on hold, but Susan said he might want to check with his wife.  Emily spoke up and said that she had not decided to put anything off, and she had already had her eggs retrieved.  Susan left, and Paul demanded to know why Emily had done that without even talking to him.  He reminded her that it took a woman and a man to make a baby, so Emily looked her husband in the face and said that if Paul was not willing to father her child, then Mick had volunteered to do it.\n\n\nPaul could not figure out why Emily would talk to another man about having a child.  Emily said she truly wanted Paul to be the biological father, so Paul asked if he had to hurry and make up his mind or else he would lose his spot in line.  He went on to say that he wanted Emily more than he wanted a baby from Emily.  Suddenly in her head, Emily heard Mick's voice hypnotizing her to answer all naysayers by swearing another baby was what she had always wanted.  She shrieked and pushed Paul away, screaming that Mick had made her say and think things.  She was very frightened that he had brainwashed her.\n\n\nCasey arrived at the Lakeview, and Alison was ready to go home.  He had spent the intervening time with Tom, eating pizza and drinking beer, as a feeble attempt at a bachelor party.  They had talked about how much better Casey's relationship with his mother was, and Casey answered his dad's question about why he and Alison were sleeping in separate beds until the wedding.  Tom suggested that Casey do \"something fancy\" for his bride during the honeymoon, and he offered to foot the bill.  Casey also told Tom that he was determined to do whatever it took to get through law school and sit for the bar.\n\n\nMick returned to the bell tower and lit dozens of white candles.  He had a rug and a chair arranged, but he wondered if Alison would show up.  He sniffed his scarf, which carried Alison's scent, and he blew lightly on some of the candles to make the firelight dance.  Mick heard footsteps on the wooden stairway, and he began to smile.  The door opened, and Barbara slipped in.  She put her hand on Mick's shoulder, and he said, \"Alison.\"  \"Guess again,\" said Barbara.\n\n\nMick was very angry that Barbara had intruded on his special place, and he tried to tell her that, rather than being romantic, candlelight was \"restful.\"  He said he liked to meditate, but Barbara accused him of expecting a tryst with Alison Stewart.  Mick grabbed Barbara roughly and told her that he was sick of her and her vanity.  She said that Paul was on to Mick, and it was just a matter of time before her son pieced it all together.  Barbara declared she was tired of running interference for Mick, and he was on his own.  She ran out and down the stairs.\n\n\nBack in Casey's room, he excused himself to study for an exam.  He and Alison kissed, and Alison said she was tired and could probably sleep.  She lay on the bed, but after a few minutes, something pulled her to get up.  She walked to the church and went up to the bell tower.  Mick took her hand and rubbed it over his face in a sensual manner.  He kissed her fingers and moved to remove her coat, but Alison stopped him.  Then she stepped up, and they kissed with great passion. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Margo and Susan give Alison a surprise bridal shower but then Susan start to argue with Margo about the monogrammed towels that Kim gave to Alison. Alison sees Mick and tells him to leave her alone but then he stops the elevator so they can talk. Mick tells Alison that marrying Casey is the wrong thing to do because marrying him won't make her the good girl she thinks she is supposed to be. Mick and Alison almost kiss but Alison backs away from Mick and someone arrives to get them out of the elevator. Barbara can't help but be jealous when she sees Alison get of the elevator with Mick behind her. Tom and Margo are happy that Casey has decided to pursue a career in law despite the up hill battle he faces because he is a convicted felon.

Barbara tries to persuade Paul to allow Emily have the child she wants with him but Paul tells Barbara he doesn't trust Mick because he found pictures of James in his room. Mick continues to use his mid control with Emily and persuades her to have her eggs harvested and tells her that if Paul doesn't want to father the baby he will father the baby and she and Paul can raise the baby. Mick tells Emily that Paul doesn't have to know he isn't the biological father of the child. Emily comes home from the clinic and tells Paul everything and he is hurt and angry that Emily wants a child so badly that she would consider having another man be the father.
