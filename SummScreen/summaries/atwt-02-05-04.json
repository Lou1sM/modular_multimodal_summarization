Lily sadly told Holden, \"You took something away from me today -- and I've already lost so much.\" When Lily and Holden returned to Rose's house, Lily described the terrible pain that she was feeling since Rose's death.\n\n\nHolden talked to Lucinda, who suggested that Dusty might be able to help Lily. Dusty went over to Holden and Lily's house at Holden's request. Holden asked Dusty to talk to Lily to help her through the rough time. Dusty protested, but Holden finally told Dusty that he was desperate for help with Lily. Finally, Dusty agreed and went to see Lily at Rose's house, but Lily angrily asked him to leave.\n\n\nMike found Katie in the abandoned railroad car where she and Simon had been hiding. Katie showed him the body of the man who'd warned Simon and her, and Mike continued to urge Katie to leave with him. When Simon returned, Mike confronted Simon and forced him to admit that Katie's life would be in danger if she stayed with him. Katie told both men, \"I'm still Simon's wife, so as long as he is alive, I am going to stay with him.\" Mike started to leave, but Katie asked him to let her and Simon leave on a supply boat of his that was going to Costa Rica.\n\n\nWhen Katie took Mike aside and told him that she would always love him, but Simon was the one who needed her, Simon overheard the conversation. When Mike left, Simon took him aside and asked Mike to help him with a plan that would keep Katie safe, but \"the downside is that she will hate both of us.\" When Simon returned after making plans with Mike, he found Katie crying. Simon told her that he had been selfish in asking her to go with him, but again she promised never to leave him. Mike returned after making arrangements for Katie and Simon to leave on his boat.\n\n\nSimon walked out, telling Katie, \"You're the most glorious person I've ever known.\" Katie started to tell Mike goodbye, but he stopped her, saying, \"You might want to hold off on that.\" Outside, Simon said, \"Goodbye, my love,\" and disappeared around the corner of the railroad car. Katie frantically looked for Simon, but Mike told her that he and Simon had planned for her boat papers to be bogus to prevent her from following Simon.\n\n\nAt Metro, when Molly asked Paul if he would keep Craig's illegal adoption of Cabot a secret, Paul instead promised to protect Molly and rushed out of Metro. Next, Carly walked in to ask Molly for help in protecting Rosanna by not letting Rosanna find out the truth about Cabot's adoption. Molly answered, \"If the cops find out about Cabot's adoption, it won't be from me.\" Carly left, realizing that Molly had to have told someone else about the adoption.\n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Craig and Rosanna were enjoying an idyllic time with Cabot, picturing him as a teenager. Carly arrived at Fairwinds and found an opportunity to warn Craig that Molly might have told someone. Craig made an excuse to leave, went directly to Metro, and demanded that Molly tell him whom she'd told. Molly retorted, \"Life's tough. It's every baby for himself.\" Meanwhile, Annabelle Fettle, ready to confess to the Canadian Mounties, asked for the name of \"that backstabber\" who'd turned her in.\n\n\nPaul called the Canadian authorities, who told him they had Annabelle Fettle in custody. He then anonymously told them that Ms. Fettle had brokered an illegal adoption for Craig Montgomery of Oakdale, Illinois. He then fell asleep and dreamed that Rosanna went to him, crying that the authorities were trying to take Cabot from her. He awakened asking, \"What have I done?\"\n\n\nMolly arrived at Paul's door, asking if he had told anyone about Cabot's adoption. Paul answered that he was going to make someone face justice. When Molly worried that everyone would find out that Paul had turned Craig in, Paul explained that he had identified himself as Ms. Fettle's ex-boyfriend and that Molly could not be linked to the accusation.\n\n\nJack's telephone rang. The Canadian authorities asked him to check out Craig Montgomery and tell him they were on their way to Oakdale. Carly was still with Rosanna when Jack entered, and Carly pretended that Jack was visiting Cabot with her. When Rosanna went to get Cabot, Jack told Carly that he was there to question Craig. Carly admitted to Jack that Craig had cut some corners on the adoption, but she begged Jack to protect Rosanna from the truth. However, Jack explained that the Canadian police were on their way to Oakdale to investigate for themselves, so Carly knew that no one could prevent the truth from being discovered.\n\n\nCraig arrived at home, and Jack told him that he needed to go to the police station, since Annabel Fettle had been arrested, and the Canadian police were on their way. Craig begged Carly and Jack not to tell Rosanna, so they tried to cover up Craig and Jack's departure the best they could. Rosanna immediately looked at Carly, saying, \"My husband just lied to me.\" When she asked Carly if it was something serious, Carly nodded sorrowfully.\n\n\nSoon after Jack and Craig arrived at the station, Annabelle Fettle burst in, confronting Craig about the adoption. Unfortunately, Rosanna arrived at the door just in time to hear Annabelle say, \"You and your wife had better kiss that baby goodbye.\" Rosanna looked at Craig and gasped, \"What have you done?\n\n\n",
