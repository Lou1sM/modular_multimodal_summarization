He then asked why she missed the meeting with Lucinda. She said she forgot. Dusty told her he was tired of her pity-party, and that she loved running the paper. Emily said she was not up to it anymore. Dusty told her she was just scared. Emily's phone rang. It was her trick from the night before. He told her he had a great time and asked if he could give her number to a friend. She agreed. Dusty told her about another meeting--another chance for the paper. Her phone rang again. It was her \"john's\" friend. She headed upstairs to his room. Inside, she and a man had a drink and she told him it was $1000 upfront.   \n\n\nAt home, Luke told Faith he heard her throwing up. He asked what was wrong. At first she said she wasn't sick, but after Luke's prodding, she said she was sick. Luke then asked her about losing weight. She said everyone in the house was obsessed with food. Faith went away and Luke called Lily. \n\n\nLily chatted over coffee at Java with two possible business partners. They left and Lucinda happened by. Lily told her about the business idea, organic baby food. Lucinda shot the idea down. Lily asked her mother if she trusted her or not. Lucinda said she did, but maybe the job was too much for her to handle. Lily's phone rang. It was Luke telling her to come home.  \n\n\nAt home Lily wanted to know what was going on. Luke told her about Faith throwing up more than once that he knew of. Faith walked in and called him a liar. Lily asked if she made herself sick. Faith denied it but did mention other girls in her school did it. Lily convinced herself it was a stomach bug. Lily then got a call from her business associates from earlier. Lily promised them seed money by the next day. \n\n\nAt the cabin Paul tried to decipher his bracelet vision. He figured it was Meg and ran off to Fairwinds. At Fairwinds, Meg and Craig kissed on the couch. Craig stopped and Meg asked him why. He said he didn't want her like that. She said she owed him still for the fake diary entries. She didn't like him toying with her. He said he wasn't and let her take a nap. Paul banged on the door and let himself in. He tried to take her away. Meg resisted and asked if a vision spurred this episode. He told her about the bracelet and said he sensed trouble. Craig came back in the room. Meg sent Paul off and told him to not try to save her from his visions anymore. Paul told her to be careful and he told Craig not to hurt her. \n\n\n",
