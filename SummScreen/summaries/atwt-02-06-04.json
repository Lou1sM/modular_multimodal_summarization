Holden admitted he hated Rose because she'd died and taken his wife with her. He left to check on how Dusty was doing with Lily.\n\n\nSarah asked Jessica if Bonnie had gotten her letter. Jessica lied and told Sarah that Bonnie had enjoyed the letter. Ben stopped by and asked Sarah to find Curtis. While she was gone, Ben encouraged Jessica to tell Sarah the truth. Jessica wouldn't break Sarah's heart and forced Ben to keep quiet.\n\n\nDusty tried to get Lily to grieve for Rose and move on, but she didn't want to listen to his plan. She lashed out at him, \"Rose was my sister. To you she was nothing but another notch on your belt!\" He wanted to use the money from Rose's life insurance policy as seed money for some sort of foundation. He said, \"If we're gonna spend time missing her, let's make it count.\"\n\n\nLily was skeptical at first, but later warmed to his idea. When Holden arrived, Lily saw through the plan. Her defenses immediately resumed, and she told both Holden and Dusty to get out. Holden waited outside while Dusty did damage control. She headed home, leaving him alone in the house. Outside, she scolded Holden for trying to manipulate her feelings.\n\n\nRosanna found Craig at the station. Annabelle was nearby and promised to get Rosanna up to speed on all the sordid details of Cabot's adoption. Craig tried to blame everything on Annabelle, but she defended herself, \"You laid down a truckload of cash for that baby. No way did you think the adoption was legal!\" Rosanna couldn't believe what was happening. She asked Craig how much he'd paid for the baby, but he couldn't name a figure.\n\n\nRosanna knew in her heart the baby was not hers any longer. She wept as she thrashed Craig, \"I asked you! I begged you! I made you promise me that everything was in order. You named him Cabot Montgomery! He was ours! We've lost him, and it's because of you!\" All Craig could muster was a weak, \"I didn't know.\"\n\n\nRosanna didn't buy Craig's lie and shoved his hand from her shoulder when he touched her. She spat, \"I have no love left for you.\" She stormed out of the station as Craig shouted after her. Jack stopped Craig from pursuing his wife because a Canadian police office was ready to interrogate him.\n\n\nMargo met up with Mike. She pleaded with him to let them know Simon's location. Mike told her Katie wouldn't be going with Simon because only his travel papers were certified. Katie's were fake.\n\n\nKatie ran after Simon, but was stopped in her tracks by a locked shipyard fence. She screamed for her husband, and he popped out of the shadows. He told her it would be their final goodbye. She tried to climb the fence, but Simon coaxed her back down to the ground. Katie frenetically started to fall apart. She couldn't bear the thought of losing Simon again so soon after she'd found him.\n\n\nKatie pleaded, \"What about what I think? What about what I want? If you could love me like that, how could you leave me like this?\" She and Simon kissed each other for the last time, and he walked away to the boat. Katie screamed after him, saying she would hate him forever for leaving her that way. As she wept, Mike appeared in the background.\n\n\nCraig tried to bribe the officer, but the investigator said the baby had to be returned to Canada immediately.\n\n\nHolden asked Dusty to keep trying with Lily, but Dusty said Holden was on his own from then on.\n\n\nRosanna burst into Fairwinds. Carly was holding Cabot. She told Carly to stay put while she ran into the other room. While Rosanna was gone, Jack called Carly and also told her to stick around -- and to not give Rosanna her baby. He said he'd be over in a jiffy.\n\n\nRosanna returned with an overnight bag packed. She asked Carly for Cabot, but she said Jack had told her not to give Rosanna the baby. Rosanna wept tears of desperation and begged Carly for help. Carly looked with pity upon her sister and said, \"I can't.\"\n\n\n",
