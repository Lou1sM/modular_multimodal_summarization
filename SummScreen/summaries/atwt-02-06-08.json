She hollers Parker's name, assuming he is the one behind Cowboy Jack's fate. Parker comes downstairs and immediately tells her he didn't do anything. Carly doesn't believe her son and calls Jack to help deal with the situation. When Jack arrives, Parker continues to proclaim his innocence, but because of his recent run-ins with Sam, neither Jack nor Carly believe him. A phone call from Sam asking Carly if she has seen Cowboy Jack only adds to Jack and Carly's suspicion of Parker. When Parker realizes who is on the phone, he grabs it away from his mother and demands that Sam confess to setting him up. Sam plays dumb and refuses to change his story. Jack pulls the phone from Parker and apologizes to Sam. Jack and Carly try to talk to Parker and get him to admit he stole the doll again, but Parker tries to explain that all of this is Sam's plan to get him out of town so Sam can get closer to Carly. Jack sends Parker to his room to cool down and talks with Carly to figure out what to do with their son. Jack decides to call Parker's therapist and when she arrives, she explains that Parker needs more therapy, but even more than that, he needs time with his entire family together to give him a sense of security. She goes upstairs to talk to Parker. Carly and Jack decide they will work together to help Parker, and Carly admits she needs to quit Metro to help the process. Jack tries to talk her out of giving up Metro, but Carly is convinced it is the right thing for her family. She leaves to return Sam's dummy and tell Sam and Kit that she is leaving the business. \n\n\nCarly arrives at Metro and returns Cowboy Jack to Sam who is there alone. She explains she is quitting Metro, but Sam says he can't let her do that. Carly details for Sam the importance of giving up the club to try to save Parker. Sam is upset, but can't change Carly's mind. Once Carly leaves, Sam talks to the burned up Cowboy Jack and they agree that if he wants to be with Carly, he needs to get her away from her family, especially her son, Parker. \n\n\nAt home, Jack tells Parker that Carly is giving up her part of the business. Parker is hesitant to believe Carly would give up Metro for him, but Jack tries to convince him that nothing is more important to him and Carly than their children. When Carly returns home, she tells Jack she quit and that she knows they can do this together. She tells him she realizes they aren't together as a couple, but as a family for their kids. Jack stops her and tells her that they will get through this. Jack calls Parker down and gives him a hug and tells him he loves him. Carly does the same and they seem to be on the path to being a happy family. \n\n\nGwen and Will continue their search for Sofie and baby Hallie. They are in Chicago and are looking in the neighborhood that Aaron said he found Sofie in the last time she left Oakdale. They question a woman on the street, who says she believes Sofie lived in the area at one time. The two ask if she has seen Sofie recently and the woman admits she hasn't seen Sofie since she moved. They continue to ask around, but become discouraged when no one else recognizes the photo. Will checks in with Margo and learns that there is no news about the baby or Sofie. Margo tells the two that going to Chicago was not a good idea and that they should return home and let the police handle finding Sofie and Hallie.

He explains that he gave them the information from her employment records, but refuses to show Aaron the papers when he asks. Aaron explains that he needs to see where Sofie might have gone so he can help her. When his boss hears Aaron's plea, he agrees to let Aaron see her application. Aaron looks through her paperwork and learns that there is really nothing there to offer any help in locating Sofie and Hallie. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Sofie has arrived in New York, not Chicago, and looks around at the immensity of the city she has just entered. A police officer, questions if Sofie and the baby are fine and her curt response seems to spark suspicion in the cop, as he watches her from afar.

She tells him she is in Central Park and that she has lost all of her money and needs help. \n\n\nSome time later, Aaron arrives in Central Park and tells Sofie he will help with the baby and then they need to go home. Sofie says she can't go back, but Aaron insists he can fix everything.

Will shares the bad news with Gwen who looks devastated. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Lucinda meets with Evan and learns that her cohort is responsible for poisoning Bob and killing Dusty and Neal. He claims that he did what had to be done to continue his research. Evan eerily locks the door and closes the blinds to the lab and turns on Lucinda. She asks if he has lost his mind, but Evan tells her that his research is more important than three lives. Evan shoves Lucinda on to a chair and removes a syringe from his coat pocket and holds it ominously close to Lucinda. She tries to talk him out of harming her by telling him that she will help him get away and to continue his research somewhere else. Evan is persuaded and tells Lucinda he wants 10 million dollars and a private jet to take him someplace with no extradition. Lucinda agrees and says she will do it first thing in the morning, but Evan wants it done immediately. \n\n\nAt the farm, Holden tries to send Lily to a spa getaway in the hopes of getting her out of Oakdale, but Lily overhears and cancels his plans.

Holden reminds Lily that the killer may be after her next and he just wants to protect her. Lily believes Holden is in just as much danger, but he is not concerned for his own safety, just hers.

Evan brandishes the syringe at the ladies and Lucinda tells Lily that she wanted her to go for help. Lily finally realizes what is going on and that Evan is behind the recent mayhem in Oakdale. Evan explains to Lily that Lucinda was the one who brought him to town and told him to do whatever it took to get her company back. Lily is furious that her mother brought this monster to Oakdale, but Lucinda explains she didn't know Evan was a lunatic. She only brought him to set up a medical project that would fail and bring down Craig's company. Lucinda's phone rings and Evan lets her answer when she and Lily explain that Holden will come looking for them if they don't talk to him. When Lucinda starts to drop hints, Evan pulls the phone from her and tells them it is time for them to help him get out of town. When Evan grabs Lily and holds the syringe to her neck, Lucinda agrees to be his hostage, while Lily gets the money and plane in order. Evan decides he needs two hostages and that they need to figure out another way to get the money. Lily persuades Evan that the only other person who can get the money is Holden and that she needs to call him to arrange everything. \n\n\nHolden arrives at the police station and tells Margo that Lily is in trouble. Just then, he gets the call from Lily explaining that she needs ten million dollars in cash and that he can't tell anyone. Holden understands and explains to Margo that the call is from Lily and everything is fine, but Margo senses something is wrong and decides to follow Holden. Back in the lab, Evan looks for Holden as he continues to threaten Lucinda and Lily. When Holden arrives he knocks on the door and Evan grabs the duffle bag and closes the door behind him, leaving Holden in the hall. He checks the money and tells Lucinda it is time for the company jet. When he peeks into the hall, he sees the cops have followed Holden and grabs Lily, threatening her with the needle. \n\n\n",
