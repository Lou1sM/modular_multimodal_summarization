    "soap_central": "\n\nAlison and Casey sparred while at work, until Matt stepped in to put an end to it. Matt told Casey the kiss Casey had witnessed in the park had been a setup by Alison to try to make Casey hurt the way she was hurting. Despite Alison's reluctance to discuss the situation, Matt continued to encourage her and Casey to get things out in the open, and ultimately, he got them to agree to go up to the hospital roof to talk. \n\n\nOn the roof, Alison explained that she had kissed Matt when she saw Casey at the park because she was angry that Casey had stood her up the day that Luke had told her to meet Casey on the roof. Casey explained again that Jade had never given him the message to meet Alison that day. Casey asked if Alison was still mad at him, and she said no; she wanted to know if Casey was mad at her. He said he wasn't anymore, but he had been upset by the kiss. Alison pointed out that Casey should have known the kiss was a setup, because she didn't know Matt very well. Casey said thinking things through wasn't one of his strong points.\n\n\nCasey wanted to know why Alison had agreed to Luke's request to meet Casey on the roof in the first place. Casey got Alison to admit she liked him. Alison still thought that although their friendship was easy, the attempt to change their relationship was too hard, which she interpreted as a sign that they weren't meant to be anything more than friends. Casey disagreed, but in trying to convince Alison, he kept putting his foot in his mouth. \n\n\nWhen Alison asked Casey what he wanted, he said that truthfully, he wanted to have sex with her. Alison walked away in a huff, exclaiming that they obviously weren't meant to be together. Casey followed and apologized but said he couldn't help it if he was attracted to her. Alison said the whole discussion they were having was proof to her that they shouldn't be more than friends. Casey said as long as they were being honest, he wanted Alison to know that he didn't need any more friends. Casey left the roof, without Alison.\n\n\nJade went to the hospital to see Casey, but Matt stopped her and told her Casey was busy on personal business. Jade wanted to know who Matt was and why he knew about Casey's personal business. Matt introduced himself as a friend of Casey's, and Jade introduced herself the same way. When Jade guessed that Casey was on the roof, Matt insisted that Jade couldn't go up there. Jade said Matt couldn't stop her, but Matt said he thought maybe he should tell Jade the story of his friendship with Casey, over coffee, someplace else. He took Jade by the arm and walked her out of the hospital, with Jade protesting the entire time.\n\n\nMatt took Jade to Java for coffee, and Jade continued to wonder why Matt was so concerned about Casey and Alison. Matt thought Jade might be interested in Casey, but he knew that Casey was into Alison, and he wanted to be sure Casey and Alison got a chance to work things out. When Matt said again that he owed Casey, Jade realized Matt and Casey had been in prison together. She got up to leave, and when Matt tried to stop her, she told him if he put his hands on her again, she would scream, and he would be back in jail very quickly.\n\n\nBefore Jade could leave, Casey walked into Java. He was surprised to see Jade with Matt; they explained they had just met. Matt asked what had happened with Alison, and Casey said nothing, which was what was always going to happen with Alison. He told them that Alison kept throwing up walls and making it clear that she did not want Casey to knock them down. Matt thought Alison didn't really mean that, but Jade said it sounded like Alison was dumping Casey. Casey said he was going to go home; Matt offered to go with him, but Casey said he wanted to be alone to lick his wounds.\n\n\nJade went to see Casey at home. After she apologized for having interfered the first time Casey was supposed to meet Alison on the roof, Jade said she could tell a relationship between Casey and Alison would have been a train wreck, because Alison had her stuff together, and Casey didn't. Jade then spotted Casey's Rock Star video game, and a challenge was soon issued for the two to determine who was the better player. \n\n\nMatt went to the hospital roof to check on Alison. Matt asked her what the problem was, and she said Matt was right earlier when he said Alison and Casey both needed to grow up. Matt told Alison he had been thinking about going back to school, and Alison told him he should do that. When Matt asked what Alison was going to do about Casey, she said, \"Nothing. It's over.\" Matt asked if that was what Alison wanted; she replied, \"That's just how it is.\" She began to cry, and Matt hugged her.\n\n\nDusty and Meg went to the police station to try to find out more about Josie and Paul's whereabouts, but the police didn't have any new information. Holden walked in and told Dusty that Jack was following up a lead. Dusty demanded to know why Jack hadn't informed him of the new lead, and Holden angrily reminded Dusty that Dusty wasn't family and had no business being involved in the investigation.\n\n\nMeg said she wanted anyone and everyone's help in finding Eliza, but Holden said Dusty had a bad track record of hurting the people he got close to and having things blow up in his face. Holden warned Dusty to stay out of it, but Dusty warned Holden that he would not be stopped. When Dusty stormed out of the police station, Meg asked Holden why he had been so opposed to Dusty's help. Holden told Meg that every time Dusty did anything that involved Paul, it only served to provoke Paul even more. Holden told Meg that she owed it to her baby to keep Dusty out of it. He believed that Meg had built a powder keg by marrying Dusty after having Paul's baby, and when Meg had sent Dusty to tell Paul about the marriage, it had been like lighting the fuse.\n\n\nNoah walked into Holden and Lily's house and found Luke looking something up on his laptop computer. Noah pestered Luke to let him know what he might be getting for Valentine's Day. Luke finally revealed that he had been looking at a listing for a one-bedroom apartment, which Luke thought they could rent together. Noah wasn't pleased by this news and told Luke that neither of them was ready for that.\n\n\nLuke couldn't believe Noah's reaction, because they had talked about what kind of place they would like to have one day. Noah pointed out that it had always been a \"some day\" conversation, and he had expected they would talk about it more after Noah finished college. Luke didn't see any point in waiting, but Noah said he was trying to be logical about the whole thing. As they fought, Holden walked in and asked if Lily was home. Luke explained that his mom had gone grocery shopping. Holden said he had argued with Meg and blamed her for aggravating Paul, and he needed to straighten things out. Since Lily wasn't there, Holden said he'd have to go try to set things right by himself. After Holden left, Luke told Noah that if Holden was strong enough to admit he was wrong, Luke was, too.\n\n\nNoah told Luke he understood his excitement about the apartment, but Noah wanted to be sure that when they got a place of their own, it was truly theirs. That meant they would have to be able to be equal contributors on the finances, which wasn't possible at that time. Luke told Noah he was glad to hear that Noah thought it would happen one day, and Noah promised it would. They kissed. \n\n\nPaul continued to hide out at the TV studio in New York with Eliza and Josie, but a security guard found them and figured out they were lying about why they were there. Paul told Josie he thought they should leave town. He suggested they drive to Florida, where it would be warm. Josie wasn't sure that was a good idea, but she agreed that as long as Paul would return to Oakdale with Eliza in one week, it didn't matter where they spent the next few days. However, they got to the place where Paul had parked the car and found that the car was gone.\n\n\nJosie noticed a sign about parking, and she told Paul the car had probably been towed. Paul said he was open to suggestions as to what they should do next, and Josie said Paul should turn himself in. After Josie pointed out that they couldn't use any other form of transportation without alerting the authorities to their presence, Paul agreed that she was right. Josie was surprised. Paul thanked Josie for letting him have a couple of days with his daughter. Josie told Paul to call Meg, and he said he would, but after that, he wanted Josie to say goodbye.\n\n\nMeg went to see Dusty at the Lakeview. He told her his private investigator had learned that Josie's car had been impounded in Brooklyn. Dusty thought Paul would try to get the car back, because it was his only transportation, and he assured Meg the police would be waiting to arrest Paul when that happened. Meg asked if Dusty had given this information to Jack. Dusty said Meg could tell Jack, but he was going to the airport. \n\n\nMeg told Dusty she didn't want him to go to New York. She said that Paul might surrender if the police found him, but he would run if he saw Dusty. Dusty said that was Holden talking, but Meg said Holden was right. Dusty told Meg not to let Holden put himself ahead of her daughter; Meg replied that she would never do that, but neither would she let Dusty put himself ahead of Eliza. Meg told Dusty she knew he was only trying to help, but she thought it was better if he didn't. She said she would let Dusty know what happened next, and she thanked him before leaving his room. As soon as Meg left the room, Dusty made a call and asked that his jet be made ready to take him to New York.\n\n\nJosie told Paul she needed to go back to Oakdale with him to help him explain things to the police. Paul said he would tell the police that he had forced Josie at gunpoint to drive him to New York and then had held her hostage until she was finally able to escape. Josie said that wasn't true, and there was no reason for Paul to have a weapons charge added to the charges against him. Paul said it didn't matter, and that it wasn't Josie's problem anymore. \n\n\nPaul called Meg, who was back at the farm, and told her he would bring Eliza back to her the next day. Meg asked if Paul was just trying to buy some time, but Paul assured her he wouldn't lie to her about something like that. Paul said he was really sorry, and that everything had gotten out of control. Meg asked Paul to call her again to let her know they were on their way back, and he said he would call every few hours. He apologized again; Meg thanked him, crying in relief. Holden arrived at the farm, and Meg told him what Paul had said.\n\n\nPaul handed Josie some cash and told her to get her car out of the impound and then leave and find someplace where she could start her life over. He suggested she get a studio and start painting again. Josie asked how she would afford that, and Paul said she should set up an offshore bank account and send him the account number; he would then put money into it so that Josie could be comfortable while waiting for her career to take off. Josie asked why he was willing to do that, and he said he owed Josie more than money. Josie hugged him, said goodbye to Eliza, and left. Paul walked away, carrying Eliza. Soon afterward, Dusty approached Josie at the impound lot and grabbed her, demanding to know where Paul and the baby were. \n\n\nPaul managed to get another car. As he went to get cash from an ATM machine, a man watched him from the sidewalk. When Paul returned to the car, the man hit Paul with a bat and drove off in the car, with Eliza still inside. Paul got up from the ground and yelled after them, but the car didn't stop. \n\n\n\n\n",

She has an attitude and questions why he would even care. Casey feels Alison is doing a 180 on him when she insists on just being friends. Dusty is livid that the police can not trace Josie's call or the car. Security questions Paul of how and why he slipped past the front desk when he's not supposed to be there at the studio. He tells Josie that she can go home; she should not be punished for what he did. Later Dusty's P.I, picks up the car in Brooklyn and he tells Meg he is heading to New York. She argues that he should let Jack and the police follow the leads and not interfere and make this worse. He agrees to her face, but then calls for the jet to be ready to go to New York. Paul calls Meg just to tell her that Eliza is safe and he is bringing her back. Paul gives Josie a big wad of money to keep her afloat until she can get her career going. Luke is sick and tired of everything being talked to death and not spontaneous with Noah. Holden hopes Meg is still speaking to him for giving his views about her marrying Dusty. Jade apologizes to Casey for interfering with the Alison situation. Alison explains to Matt that she and Casey need to grow up, it didn't work out between them. Dusty catches up with Josie and demands to know where Paul and the baby are. Holden comforts Meg and is happy about her news that Paul is returning Eliza.
