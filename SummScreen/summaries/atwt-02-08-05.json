They try to convince the boys that if they work on it, they may grow up to be friends, too.  Meanwhile, in a car outside Julia's new apartment, Lily and Carly spy on Julia and Keith.  Julia figures out that it was Lily and Carly who brought Keith to Oakdale, and she told him that they would be sorry for interfering in her life.  Carly concocts a plan to get Holden to walk in on Julia and Keith, but when Holden shows up with JJ, Julia convinces Keith to leave through the window because she doesn't want Holden to see him.  Unbeknownst to Keith, Lily has caught his escape on her cell phone camera!  When Carly finds Jack and Parker at the coffee shop, Jack is curious about where she has been.  Jack isn't happy when she admits she was with Lily, but Carly reminds him that if she hadn't tricked him into going to Montana, he would not have gotten his memory back and they would be divorced.  Jack is called back to the police station before he can argue with her.\n\n\nJack will find that the police station has become a very busy place.  Barbara's refusal to sign the \"deal\" Tom Hughes offered has caused a lot of anger.  Hal, Paul and Will are furious when she refuses Tom's final offer, but Barbara sees Rosanna through the interrogation room's window and cannot sign.  When the men leave the room, Rosanna comes in to talk to Barbara.  She wants details about how Barbara brainwashed Emily.  Barbara suspects it is a trap and questions Rosanna about how she plans to convince anyone she is innocent.  Rosanna replies that it is simple -- that she will convince people that she did these things to herself.\n\n\nKatie and Henry are visited by Reverend McKenzie and his wife.  They want him to perform the \"nuptials\" but the Reverend has a lot of questions for the couple.  Henry actually admits to the Reverend that he isn't sure that Katie loves him, and the Reverend's wife wonders why Katie has so many photos of Mike in her room.  When Mike stops by for a visit, the Reverend has questions for him, too.  Mike only says that Henry is his best friend and that he hopes Katie makes him very happy.  When Katie and Henry are left alone, the only thing Katie can think about is how Mike doesn't seem upset about their marriage at all, and that her plan is failing.  Henry is so upset that he excuses himself and sits on the front doorstep.  He bursts into tears and Katie sees this.  Margo, who has been upstairs wrestling with her bridesmaid dress, comes downstairs for Katie's help.  She sees her sister is upset, and Katie declares she has destroyed Mike's life, her life, and now Henry's life.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara goes along with Roseanna despite her instinct not to trust James and the risk of further alienating Will. Roseanna also reveals that there are no lawyers, but her plan to make it look like she was haunting herself. Keith remains a mystery and Lily is stunned that he crawls out the window when Holden arrives. She takes his picture as he crawls out. Jack and Carly run damage control with Parker, Carly hinting that she may be up to something to Jack, who somewhat disapproves. The minister comes to interview Henry and Katie and when Mike comes in, he seems to push Katie toward Henry. When Henry asks Katie what would be so bad about being married to him, she tells him she only did any of this to get Mike back which devastates Henry but finally makes Katie realize how selfish she's being.",
