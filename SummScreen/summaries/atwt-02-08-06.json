    "tvmega_recap": "Jack finds Carly's Galaxy strip club outfit hidden in a bag, but she claims it was bought at a yard sale for them to use in role-playing (wink, wink). Nick interrupts by showing up at their house, much to the annoyance of Jack. Nick continues to flirt with Carly when Jack is out of the room, even claiming he is crazy about her. He taunts her about losing her bracelet at the club, but eventually gives it back to her. Carly continues to deny the attraction to someone whom she claims to hate.

They make plans to leave for Chicago after dark. Margo tells Casey and Maddie about Gwen and Will's arrest warrants. Casey believes Gwen is capable of pushing Barbara, which leads to another fight between him and Maddie. She leaves with Nate but can't get Casey off her mind, which does not go unnoticed by Nate, who later walks out on their date because of this. Maddie comes faces to face with Will and Gwen. Barbara continues to claim it was Gwen who tried to kill her, and pleads with Jen to make a public appeal for Will to come home. Barbara claims that Paul's death has taught her that she is not doing enough to save her children, and she will risk losing Will forever to keep Gwen away from him. Luke and Jade bond over breakfast while Lily checks out her story. The nuns at the orphanage weren't sure how Lily and her family would react to a mixed race child, but that clearly doesn't bother Lily. It appears that Jade is really Rose's child, and when she and Luke come home, Lily welcomes her with open arms.",
