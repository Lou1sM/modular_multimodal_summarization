    "soap_central": "\n\nLuke joins Lily, Holden, Faith, and Natalie at the farm. After sending the girls out of the room, Lily fills Luke in on the details of the ordeal Evan Walsh put her and Lucinda through. Luke is relieved to find out Dusty's killer has been exposed, which means Holden's name has been cleared. He asks why Holden didn't do more to protest his innocence; Lily says Holden was trying to protect her. Lucinda arrives and asks if she's welcome at the farm. Luke doesn't understand why she wouldn't be. Lucinda makes it sound as though she just didn't want to interrupt a family moment. \n\n\nWhen Lucinda goes to get something from her car, Luke follows her and asks her what's really going on. Lucinda says she blames herself for what Evan Walsh did, because of her connection to him. Luke assures her that she could not have anticipated what happened any more than anyone else at the hospital or on the board of directors could have. He tells his grandmother to remember that she and Lily were the victims, and he's glad they got out alive. Lucinda points out that Dusty wasn't that lucky. \n\n\nInside, Meg joins the rest of the family in the kitchen, and Holden asks her why she was with Paul at the hospital. Meg tells Holden that Paul wanted to help clear Holden's name. Holden says he hopes that isn't enough to make Meg want to be with Paul again. Meg says she still loves Paul, but she knows she can't be in a relationship with him because he's no good for her. Holden tells Meg she's not alone, because her whole family is there to support her. \n\n\nLuke goes back inside and tells his mom that Lucinda is upset. Meg offers to check on Lucinda, saying she has something that will make Lucinda feel better. Outside, Meg offers Lucinda the paperwork to transfer Montgomery Enterprises back to her. Meg is shocked when Lucinda pushes the paperwork back at Meg and claims she doesn't want the company anymore. \n\n\nInside the farmhouse, Holden tells Lily it's time to start all over again. Lily asks if he means alone or with her. Holden tells her that the only way he can start over with her is if she promises not to keep secrets from him anymore. \n\n\nMeg goes inside and tells Holden and Lily that Lucinda has turned down her offer to return the company. Lily suggests that perhaps her mother feels the events with Evan Walsh have tainted the company somehow. Lily tells Lucinda, \"Maybe it's time for all of us to make a fresh start. Meg's giving you another chance; I think you should take it.\" Privately, Lucinda tells Lily not to let Lucinda's mistakes jeopardize Lily's relationship with Holden. Lily says she'll keep her mother's secret (that she's the person who brought Evan Walsh to town) on one condition-that she sign the paperwork to take back her company. Lucinda does, and she tells Lily that she'll try to make her proud again. \n\n\nAfter Lucinda leaves, Lily tells Holden that she does want to start over, but she confesses that she has a secret. Lily tells Holden the secret is one she can't share with him because it's not hers to tell. Holden asks whose secret it is, and she says it's her mother's. Lily says if she tells Holden, it would involve him in another legal mess. Holden tells Lily that he'll have to trust her enough to not ask for any more details. Surprised, Lily asks if he means that, and Holden says he does. He says they need to start over \"right now, right here.\" \n\n\nAt the hospital, Chris apologizes to his dad for having gone ahead with the Memo-21 project and admits he was wrong to go behind Bob's back. He asks his father to forgive him, and Bob does, but Bob points out that others might not be as forgiving in light of all that has occurred under Chris's watch. He suggests Chris might find it easier to leave Oakdale and start all over again someplace else. \n\n\nWill and Gwen go to see Margo at the police station. They tell her that Aaron has gone to New York City and found Sofie, but Sofie managed to get away from him. Margo calls the authorities in New York and tells Gwen and Will that the best thing they can do is to go home and wait. They leave, reluctantly. \n\n\nIn New York, a police officer questions Sofie about why her baby is outside in the cold weather crying so much. Sofie says she's the baby's mother and is taking good care of her. The officer thinks the baby is sick and that perhaps Sofie has no insurance and doesn't know what to do. He tells her any ER will have to treat her whether or not she can pay, and he offers to take her to the nearest hospital. As he makes a call on his phone, Sofie slips away with the baby. \n\n\nSofie finds a business card for Chris Hughes in her pocket. She calls Chris and tells him the baby has a fever. Chris asks her to bring the baby in so he can examine her, but Sofie tells him they're not in Oakdale. Concerned, Chris asks if Sofie is with Gwen and Will, but Sofie hangs up. Chris calls Sofie back and tells her the baby's fever needs to be treated. He asks her to bring Hallie home. Sofie tells him Oakdale is no longer her baby's home. Chris tells Sofie that one of the toughest parts of being a parent is knowing when to put your child's needs ahead of your own. Sofie hangs up again, but she takes out the plane tickets to Oakdale that Aaron had given her. \n\n\nA car drives by Sofie and the baby, and the driver offers her a ride to the airport. Sofie gets into the car as Aaron comes up the street, shouting for her to wait. Aaron watches as the car drives off, then he calls Gwen and Will and tells them what just happened. After they hang up, Gwen listens to a message from Chris about his phone calls with Sofie. On the message, Chris tells Will and Gwen that it appears the baby is sick. \n\n\nWill and Gwen rush to the hospital, where Chris tells them he doesn't know exactly where Sofie is. Will says he's going to get on a plane and go to New York to find her, but Sofie comes walking around the corner, holding the baby. Gwen tries to take the baby from her, but Sofie won't let her. Instead, she gives Hallie to Chris, who asks both Gwen and Sofie to wait in the hall while he examines Hallie. \n\n\nGwen is very upset that Sofie took the baby away. Sofie reminds Gwen that she and Will promised her she could spend time with her baby, and then Will's mother shut the door in her face when she tried to go see Hallie. Gwen agrees that she's at fault for not realizing how difficult the open adoption would be for Sofie and not setting reasonable boundaries sooner. As they are talking, Will walks up with Margo, who arrests Sofie for kidnapping Hallie. \n\n\nAt the police station, Jack finds two tickets to a hockey playoff game in an envelope on his desk and assumes that Parker's hockey coach has left them as a gift. He leaves early to surprise Parker with the tickets. When Jack meets Parker for dinner, he tells him about the tickets. Parker says it's impossible for the tickets to be from his coach. He asks if Jack knows for sure that his coach left the tickets, and Jack admits he doesn't. Parker thinks Sam left the tickets for some strange purpose of his own. Jack asks why Parker would think Sam left the tickets since Parker thinks Sam hates him. Parker doesn't have an answer for that, so Jack insists that they go to the game and enjoy themselves. Parker wants to stop by Metro first, but Jack says they can see Carly after the game. \n\n\nAt Metro, Sam asks Cowboy Jack if he thinks Jack \"took the bait.\" Carly arrives and apologizes to Sam for having to let him go. Jack calls Carly and tells her about the hockey tickets. Carly thinks this might be a good way for Parker and Jack to spend some time together. After she hangs up, she tells Sam she has to go work on the books for Metro. Sam takes out Cowboy Jack, who tells Sam, \"It's time to make your move!\" Carly walks by and asks Sam what he meant by that. Sam tells her he just meant it was time for him to pack up and move on to something new. \n\n\nSam goes upstairs, and Carly answers the Metro phone when it rings. The caller is from the band whose appearance was cancelled. The band member ultimately tells Carly that the band didn't cancel the gig, Sam did. When Sam comes back downstairs, Carly confronts him with this news. Sam admits it's true. He tells Carly he did it because he's in love with her. Carly is shocked to hear this and tells Sam she had no idea he felt this way. When Sam tells her he arranged for Kit to be out of town so he could be alone with Carly, Carly responds forcibly by saying that nothing will ever happen between them. Sam asks Carly not to tell Kit about this, since nothing actually happened. He then says he'll leave after he finishes his beer. When Carly returns to the bar area later, Sam has five or six empty beer bottles in front of him. Carly tries to get Sam to leave, but he refuses. \n\n\nJack and Parker arrive at Carly's house after the hockey game only to find that she's not home yet. Because Parker's worried about his mom, Jack calls Carly at Metro. She answers, but before she can say much to Jack, Parker grabs the phone and asks if Sam is bothering her. Carly tells Parker she's okay and will be home soon. She hangs up. Parker tells Jack he has a gut feeling that something's wrong. Carly again asks Sam to leave so she can lock up and go home. Sam tells her he'll leave after she gives him one kiss. He pushes himself on her, and when she resists, he shoves her down onto a loveseat. As he tries to force himself on her, a shot rings out; he slumps over and falls to the ground. \n\n\n\n\n",
