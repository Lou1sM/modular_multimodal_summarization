    "soap_central": "\n\n \nCarly packed a tote bag with goodies for Liberty and muttered to herself that she had to keep in mind that it was all to help the girl.  She left her house and headed for the hospital.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet read a pamphlet about chemotherapy and discussed its side effect with Jack, as they waited for Liberty to appear.  Janet had never considered some of the side effects, and their descriptions frightened her.  Jack gave her a pep talk about keeping their eyes on the prize, and that was a happy, healthy daughter.  Liberty joined them, but she was focused exclusively on the fact that she was about to receive a poison that was supposed to kill something in her body that was trying to kill her.\n\n\nThe trio went to the hospital, and Janet attempted to distract Liberty from what she was feeling, but her daughter just wanted the treatment to be over.  Liberty excused herself to go to the bathroom, and Jack complimented Janet on how well she was holding up.  Janet hugged him, and Carly walked in and saw the couple.  She backed off and ran into Liberty, who had been crying in the ladies' room.  Carly handed the girl the tote bag with sketchpads and pencils, and Liberty asked Carly to \"stick around.\"  A nurse called Liberty into the treatment area, so Liberty hugged her mother and went with the nurse.\n\n\nAfter some time, Carly went in to sit with Liberty, who was cheerfully designing her prom dress.  She was excited until she waved her arms and disturbed the needle in her arm.  The nurse checked and found it all right, but Liberty's better mood was gone.  She told Carly that she might not even make it to prom, and that made Carly sad.\n\n\nOutside in the corridor, Janet told Jack how helpless she felt about keeping her daughter safe.  Carly walked out and told Janet that Liberty needed her mother, so Janet went in.  Jack got Carly a coffee and told her that he was glad she was there.  Susan Stewart walked by and asked how Liberty was.  She also suggested to Jack that he have every family member tested as a potential blood marrow donor.  She said anyone who was compatible could be a donor, whether a family member or not.  Carly suggested that they get tested while they waited, and she told Jack that they could do it together.\n\n\nJack and Carly were successful in getting their blood tests, but Carly felt a bit woozy afterwards.  Jack got her a chocolate bar, and Janet joined them.  Jack told her what he and Carly had done, \"just in case,\" but Janet was irritated because it had never occurred to her that chemotherapy would not work for Liberty.  Carly went in to say goodbye to Liberty, as Jack calmed Janet by telling her that Susan had made the suggestion.  Liberty was grateful to Carly for keeping her company, but she did ask if Carly was still in love with Jack.  Carly dodged the question.\n\n\nJanet hated to think that her daughter might endure the chemo treatments and still not be all right.  Jack said it was just good sense to have a backup plan, and the bone marrow donors was a good one.  Janet saw the truth in his idea, and she hugged Jack as Carly passed through on her way out.\n\n\nAlison had the day off from the hospital, but she was there as a patient.  Susan spotted her in one of the treatment rooms and asked why she was there.  Alison said she was \"meeting a friend,\" but then she admitted that she was there to get a prescription for a \"morning-after\" pill.  Susan asked if her daughter had discussed the matter with Casey, but Alison refused to talk about it.  Susan suddenly realized that Alison's partner was not Casey, but the girl only told her mother that she had \"made a mistake.\"\n\n\nSusan dredged up Alison's history and asked why she had slept with someone else if she was so ready to marry Casey in a week.  Alison would still not say who the man was, but Susan correctly guessed that it was Mick Dante.  She remembered Barbara's blunt warning about Mick, and she told Alison that she obviously wasn't ready to get married.  Alison protested that it had only been one time with Mick, and they were \"just friends.\"\n\n\nSusan asked if that friendship meant \"with benefits,\" Alison was horrified and said that the sexual encounter had \"just happened.\"  She said being with Mick was like an out-of-body experience, but Susan did not trust Mick, and she was worried that her daughter was involved with him.  Susan wrote a prescription for the morning-after pill, and advised Alison to \"take it and not look back.\"\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Barbara grabbed Paul's arm and yelled at him to let Mick go.  \"He's your father!\" Barbara screamed, and Paul recoiled.  He made his mother repeat herself, but he decided that she was making a sick joke.  Mick assured Paul that Barbara was telling the truth, but Paul didn't even know how to respond.  Mick called Paul \"son,\" and that set Paul off again.  He was incredulous that Mick could even make such a statement, but Mick claimed that his anti-aging treatments had made him younger.\n\n\nMick continued to say that he would like to make up for damage that James had inflicted on his family, and Barbara backed him up.  She said that Mick's fingerprints and scars proved the truth.  Emily wasn't buying a word of that, as Paul threw Mick to the floor.  Mick got up again, and Paul went after him and accused him of \"preying\" on his mother's vanity and his wife's desire to have another child.  Paul called Mick \"sick,\" and declared that he was either a liar or just plain insane.\n\n\nBarbara wanted to prove that Mick was really James Stenbeck, and Mick pleaded for another chance.  He said he had returned to Oakdale for Paul, as his \"son\" reminded him that he had left Oakdale in a coffin.  Paul refused to believe that Mick was anyone but a con man, and as Mick tried to convince him otherwise, Emily admitted a policeman.  The cop arrested Mick for fraud and assault, as Paul suggested they add another charge: \"impersonating a lunatic.\"  The officer led Mick away, but Paul detained him for a minute.  He yanked some hair from Mick's head and then told the officer to proceed.\n\n\nBarbara told Emily that her daughter-in-law's only chance of getting pregnant had just been arrested, but Emily said sadly that was never possible because it was all part of Mick's scam.  Barbara declared that the anti-aging treatments were real, but Emily suddenly decided that she had to warn Alison.  After Emily left, Paul asked his mother how long she had known that Mick was pretending to be James.  She answered, \"A few weeks,\" and Paul asked for one good reason why Barbara shouldn't rot in jail along with Mick for building up false hopes in Emily.\n\n\n The only part that Paul could swallow was that somehow James had been responsible for sending Mick Dante to them as a \"last laugh from the grave.\"  Barbara was still on her soapbox about James's \"making amends\" as Mick, but Paul said that she had fallen for that line because of her own desperate need to feel young again.  Barbara swore that the treatments had made her appear younger, but Paul shook his head.  He told her that to him, his mother looked even older and \"very much like a fool.\"  Paul threw his mother out of his house.\n\n\nAlison retuned to Casey's and found a note from him that said he had gone to have his tuxedo fitted.  She took the morning-after pill from her purse and was reading the directions when someone knocked on the door.  It was Emily, who said she had news that Alison wouldn't like.  Emily told her sister that Mick had just been arrested for putting Emily in a coma, and, besides, he was not who he said he was.  Emily recounted how she had confronted Mick about the photos of Paul as a young man, and then everything had gone black.\n\n\nAlison was not inclined to believe Emily until she said that incident had taken place in the old church bell tower.  That eliminated some of Alison's doubt, but the girl was still hesitant.  Emily went on that Mick was claiming to be a younger version of James Stenbeck, but in reality he was a con man who had fooled them all.  Alison could not understand why Mick would make up a tale like that, and she blamed herself for taking him to meet Paul and Emily as possible investors. Emily left, and Alison swallowed her pill and took off.\n\n\nAt the police station, Mick told the officer who was fingerprinting him that everyone was going to get a surprise when the cops revealed the print results.  He suggested that his \"son,\" Paul, be invited especially.  The officer put Mick in the interview room, as Alison walked in.  She joined him in the room, and he volunteered to explain everything.  Alison demanded the truth, and Mick said that she was the only person he had been completely honest with.  Alison asked who he was, but Mick instead asked her for a favor.\n\n\nMick began by talking about the connection they had shared in the bell tower, and he reminded her about the battle inside him that pitted good against evil.  Mick said that was the heart of what was going on, but just then Barbara charged in and ordered Alison out.  She said there was a lawyer outside, and Alison was to get out immediately.  Mick looked at Barbara, and then he backed down and asked Alison to leave.\n\n\nEmily returned home and told Paul that she had warned Alison about Mick.  Emily could not figure out why Mick had thought they would believe that he was Stenbeck.  Paul said it was over, but Emily still had questions.  Paul put the strands of Mick's hair into a baggie and said that he would take it to the lab for DNA tests.  Emily got sad that they had lost their only chance to have their own baby, and she began to cry.  Paul said they had won, however, because they still had each other.\n\n\n",
