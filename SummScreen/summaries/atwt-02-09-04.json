Then Chris will be able to really help Alison when he is allowed to talk to her again.  While Chris is talking to Molly, Alison arrives at Aaron's apartment with her suitcase. The first thing she sees is a box of baby things.  When Aaron arrives, he finds Alison clutching a Teddy bear and crying.  Aaron rushes out with the box of baby things, and when he gets outside the door, he immediately calls Emily to come help Alison.  As soon as Emily arrives, Aaron leaves to dispose of the baby things.  Alison cries to Emily that she feels totally alone without the baby.

At last, Emily convinces Alison to go to a support group that is meeting in ten minutes.  They arrive a little late at the Durgin Street Shelter.

When Katie asks Henry how she can go on, knowing that Simon is alive somewhere and still loves her, Henry tells her that this is what real life is like, and that she has to go on.  When Henry reminds Katie that Mike loves her, Katie retorts, \"That's not the kind of love I need.\"\n\n\nThe Canadian inspector bristles at Craig's offer of \"compensation,\" telling Craig that the inspector's job is to bring the baby back to his birth mother.
