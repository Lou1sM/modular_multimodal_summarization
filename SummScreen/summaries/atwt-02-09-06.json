    "tvmega_recap": "Jack tells Carly about Gwen having an arrest warrant issued for her, and naturally Carly wants to desperately help out, but Jack suggests this time she leave it to the police because when she gets involved things usually go horribly wrong. Carly has bigger fish to fry anyway with going undercover at the Galaxy Strip Club in order to get Jack's job back. She agrees to go into \u0091work' that night, but when Jack surprises her by taking the night off, he is stunned when she tells him she doesn't want him staying home! Barbara convinces Jen to make a public plea for Will's return, against Jen and Kim's better judgment. They think Barbara will do better with Will, and he will come home, if she drops the charges against Gwen. Barbara will not be deterred. A mysterious woman tells Jen that the grief for her older brother has been misguided. Emily continues to believe Paul is alive and well and Meg is the key to finding him. Emily cons Emma into telling her where Meg is. She forces Henry to help her find out which hotel Meg is staying at, by holding BJ's money over his head. Henry locates Meg at a Mexican hotel and leaves her a message pretending to be Paul in hopes she will come home. Emily is right; Paul is close; he has disguised himself as someone from France, who is staying in a run down Oakdale motel, and is making mysterious phone calls. Maddie helps Will and Gwen find a place to stay while on the run. They end up holed up at the closed down Metro. Maddie goes and gets them lots of food from Java, but is forced to lie to Henry when he sees her with all this food and mistakenly thinks she has an eating disorder. As she is heading out the door, she runs smack dab into Casey who is also real curious at what she is doing with all the food she has.",
