    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Worldwide, Lucinda, Dusty, and a businessman named Chauncy Kelman are waiting for Emily to finish a phone call and make her presentation about the Intruder. Dusty goes out to see what's keeping her, and Emily tells him Daniel called to wish her luck, but Kelman reamed her up and down about that and about her time in both a psych ward and jail; after all that, she's not so sure she wants to fight for her position at the paper. Dusty says Kelman wants her job running the Intruder, and he convinces her that he believes in her and that she needs this opportunity, so she goes ahead and makes her business presentation. She does a great job of selling both the paper and herself as its editor, and Lucinda ends up telling Dusty that she'll offer Emily the job \"on probation.\" Dusty tells Emily she got the job, then invites her to dinner so they can brainstorm about the paper, but Emily says she has other plans tonight.\n\n\nAt the psychologist's office, Lily makes phone calls trying to locate Faith. Jack comes in to pick up Parker from his appointment and finds that both Parker and Faith have gone missing. The doctor tells them that since they're friends, they're probably together, and Jack agrees, saying Parker's been doing a lot of running off lately. He asks Lily to give the kids a few more minutes before they panic about them, and he has security at the hospital check the security cameras to be sure the kids left by themselves and not against their will with someone else. Lily calls Luke to let him know what's going on, and she and Jack commiserate about how much their kids hate them right now. Jack tries calling Parker's cell phone several times, but Parker never picks up.\n\n\nFaith and Parker go to Java to get something to eat and drink, but they're not there very long before Will comes in. They leave before Will can spot his brother, and Parker takes Faith out to the woods near Paul's cabin. Lying down on the ground, he tells Faith they're in a spot his dad used to bring him to, with a hot spring underneath that warms the ground above. When his cell phone rings again, he sees it's JJ, but he knows Jack probably had JJ call him to see if he'd answer. He tosses the phone to Faith, who tosses it back, and they keep this up until Faith throws it too far, and Parker has to go look for it in the bushes. While he's gone, Faith turns and screams when she sees someone standing over her; Parker hears her and tackles the man, who turns out to be Paul. They tell Paul what they're doing, and he offers to take them back into town and help with \"damage control.\" They get to Java, and just as Paul is telling Parker to call Jack, Lily and Jack walk in and see them. Paul tells them the kids left their doctor's office alone, which was wrong, but then found him in the woods, where he'd slipped on some ice and hurt himself; he tells them the kids helped him hobble back to town. He limps out of Java, and Jack tells Parker to tell him what really happened. Parker asks how much trouble he's in, and Jack says lots, but he wants Parker to know that he understands that he's been through a lot, and they'll help each other get through this. Meanwhile, Lily takes Faith outside and tells her she was worried sick about her, but Faith tells her she waited for her like she was supposed to, but once again, her mom forgot all about her.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Craig spots Katie and tries to make nice with her, saying he misses her. She becomes sarcastic with him, telling him he could help her do a spot on her new TV show about how to alienate everyone you know; he says he thinks she knows how to do a bang-up job of that herself. When she tells Craig she thinks he's responsible for Daniel being hurt, even if he didn't actually have him kidnapped, he fires back that perhaps she's the reason Carly's kids have been hurt. As she tries to leave, Craig grabs her arm, but Henry walks up and tells him to leave Katie alone. Craig walks away, but after Henry and Katie sit down, he comes to their table and tells Katie that Henry might be filling the role of \"absent husband,\" but Mike's not coming back. He suggests she not keeping pushing away the people who still care about her, or they might not come back, either. Henry again tells Craig to leave, and he does; Henry then reassures Katie that she's nothing like Craig, and she says that at least she wants to try to change and become a better person. When she suggests they toast to \"growing older and wiser,\" Henry says he'll toast to the \"wiser\" part.\n\n\nGwen goes to the police station, where she sees Maddie but not Will or Adam. In the interrogation room, Casey confesses to Tom and Margo that he had been gambling online and losing money because he couldn't stop. He tells them he and Elwood figured out a way to cheat at online poker, but the people behind the Web site found out and came after him; they ask how much he had to pay them, and he tells them about $2,800. Margo asks who on earth would loan Casey that kind of money, but he says he just borrowed from different people in the dorm, thinking he'd win it all back. Tom says he'll try to get bail set so Casey won't have to spend the night in jail. Elwood arrives, and Maddie accuses him of being behind everything that happened, but Elwood explains how the whole gambling thing became an addiction for Casey. Dallas comes to take Elwood's statement, and Gwen tells Maddie she's going to keep looking for Will.\n\n\nDallas comes in and tells Tom and Margo they've recovered all the missing bonds. Tom and Margo ask Casey if he's told them absolutely everything, and he says yes. Just then, Will arrives and bursts into the interrogation room, demanding to know why Casey would do this to him. He tells Tom and Margo about Gwen finding one of the bonds at their house and accuses Casey of planting it there so that it would look like Will stole the bonds, knowing that Gwen wouldn't want to prosecute her own husband for stealing his own money, and thereby getting himself off the hook for the crime. Casey doesn't deny or confirm this, and Tom and Margo take Will out of the room, where Margo tells him he's free to make a statement if he wants to; he does, and Tom tells Margo they need to get to the judge right now before the statement is part of Casey's record, or he won't get out of jail tonight.\n\n\nMaddie goes into the interrogation room and tells Casey she knows he couldn't have been the one to set Will up. She tells him if he won't tell her who did, she'll find out for herself, and she says it will break her heart if he doesn't tell her the truth right now.\n\n\nAt Tom and Margo's, Adam calls and makes a reservation for a flight out of Oakdale, then packs his bags to leave. On his way out the door, he runs into Jade, who asks where he's going. He says he has to go back to LA because of Gwen's demo, but Jade tells him to try again, saying that with both of his brothers in trouble, that's a poor excuse. She accuses him of being the one who set it up to look like Will stole the bonds, but he denies it. She tells him he used her, but he says they enjoyed each other's company and had some great sex. She agrees, then asks for a goodbye kiss, but when he kisses her, she reaches in his pocket, grabs his car keys, and tosses them off into the bushes. Angry, Adam tells Jade to leave; she does, but when he turns around, he spots Gwen coming his way, so he takes off, too. Gwen catches up to him in the woods.\n\n\n\n\n",
