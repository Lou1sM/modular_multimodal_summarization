She was concerned how fast the money Craig had loaned her was disappearing. Henry listed all the selling points of his new drink, the \"Hopetini,\" and declared it \"full of promise and rosy days to come.\" Carly picked up the drink to give it a try as Craig walked in. He sat down and said he was there to check on his investment, but Carly reminded him the money he gave her was a loan, not an investment, and she promised to pay him back. Henry introduced Craig to the \"Hopetini,\" and Craig took a swig. They all tasted it and declared it still a work in progress. Henry took offense and walked out. Craig told Carly she was thinking too small if she thought a drink would turn the tide of her business. He said she needed her own brand of product, preferably a designer vodka. He suggested she create a world-class label that would assure her success. Carly admitted she was intrigued, but she wanted to know why Craig kept referring to \"we\" when he talked about Carly's business. \n\n\nBrad came home toting comfort food for Katie and saw a parenting magazine on the counter, which he tossed into the trash. He called Katie to come out of the bedroom, which she did, wearing a negligee. She greeted him with a passionate kiss, but Brad stopped the action declaring, \"Code blue.\" Katie was eager to have sex, but Brad reminded her that Dr. Bob had said she needed to take a break and rest. She continued to smooch, however, and finally Brad picked her up to carry her to the bedroom, but when he realized she wanted unprotected sex, he said, \"No thingy, no sex.\" Katie was irritated and put on sweats and ran the dust buster over Brad as he sat on the couch. She was hurt that he didn't want sex with her, but he told her that was not true. He just wanted to do what Bob had recommended. Katie claimed Bob was too conservative, but Brad did not want to put his wife at risk. She tried kissing him again, and this time Brad could hardly resist, so he ran out instead. \n\n\nIn snowy Brooklyn, Dusty caught up with Josie and demanded to know where Paul was. She told him Paul and Eliza were on their way back to Meg in Oakdale, but Dusty did not believe her. She explained how Paul had forced her to drive him and the baby to New York, and said Paul was on his way to a rental agency to begin his journey home. They went to reclaim Josie's car and then visited five rental agencies, none of which had rented a car to Paul. This reinforced Dusty's thinking that Paul had snookered Josie once again. \n\n\nAfter being carjacked, Paul screamed for baby Eliza in frustration. He called Meg and broke the news that the baby had disappeared. At first, Meg thought Paul was lying, but then he explained how he had lost the car and their daughter. He swore to God that he would not let her down, and he hung up. A frantic Meg broke down and sobbed. \n\n\nPaul called the rental agency and asked them to call the police and give them a description of the car. He also talked to Barbara and begged for her help. His mother promised to come, so he waited. Eventually she found him hiding behind a building, but Meg was right behind her. She flew at Paul, screaming for her baby, but Paul swore that he would never intentionally hurt her or their child. \n\n\nCraig told Carly that they had worked together well in the past and could do so again. He said she would be the product's spokesperson, and he would be the money man. He suggested she take back the controls and start living the life she deserved. She thought about that and then announced Craig was right, because she had nothing to lose. Carly tasted several different types of vodka and agreed with Craig that they all tasted very similar. Craig said the magic was in the container, the shape of the bottle and the label. Carly insisted that they keep things strictly business, so Craig agreed to provide the start-up cash, and Carly would handle the creative end. They would split the profits, 50-50. Carly tried another vodka, and then a few more. Finally, Craig asked her, \"Deal or no deal?\" Carly answered, \"Deal!\" and they shook hands. Craig asked her to come up with a name for their designer vodka, and Carly began thinking of the film, \"Dr. Zhivago,\" and that imagery brought her to the name, \"Midnight Sun.\" \n\n\nHenry was drinking many types of martinis at the Lakeview bar, supposedly checking out the competition. Brad found him there and told him Katie was still in baby mode, but she was not physically ready to be pregnant. Henry was still down on the \"baby makes three\" scenario after his arguments with Vienna, so he told Brad to put his foot down and rule his own roost. \n\n\nKatie took some baby clothes from a dresser and vowed she was not giving up. She went to her bedside table and took out her birth control \"thingy\"-a diaphram-and threw it in the trash. She went to the Lakeview and found Brad, and when no one else was watching, she opened her coat for just Brad. That drove him crazy, and he followed her out. They went home and stumbled into the bedroom, shedding clothes as they went. Brad asked about her \"thingy,\" but Katie assured him it was right where it needed to be. They fell on the bed. \n\n\nJosie and Dusty were arguing as they ran into Paul, Meg, and Barbara on the street. Dusty went after Paul and demanded to know what had happened to the baby. Everyone started screaming, until finally Meg was able to explain that the baby was in Paul's rental car, which had been carjacked. Dusty checked Paul's story with the correct rental agency, and he was amazed that Paul had told the truth. \n\n\nCraig proposed a toast to \"Midnight Sun,\" the world's most fashionable new vodka, but Carly had imbibed more than enough alcohol. Craig wanted to drive her home, but Carly called and ordered two cabs instead. \n\n\nDusty, Paul, Josie, and Meg walked the streets in the neighborhood where Paul's car had disappeared, until Paul recognized the car parked along the curb. He rushed to it, but the car seat where Eliza had been riding was empty. Meg became hysterical when she realized her baby was still missing, and she threw herself into Dusty's arms. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Henry and Carly try to come up with ways that they can get Metro back in the black when Craig arrives with ideas.
