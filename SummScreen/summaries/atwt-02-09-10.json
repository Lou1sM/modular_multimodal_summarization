Liberty was exhausted and went upstairs to go back to bed, as Jack took a call from Carly.  She said that Parker's principal had called and wanted to see both of them right away, so Jack grabbed his coat and ran out.\n\n\nAs soon as Jack was gone, Parker sneaked into the house and went upstairs to keep Liberty company.  He said he had tried to concentrate in school, but he could not stop thinking of her.  Parker asked how the chemo session had gone, and Liberty said it was rough.  She admitted that she was really tired, and the smell of the flowers that Natalie had sent was making her sick.  Parker moved the flowers and told Liberty that she looked beautiful anyway, but then she always did to him.\n\n\nParker assured Liberty that she was not going to die, even though the girl could still not understand how \"pumping poison into someone's body could cure anything.\"  Parker said that he had read that \"visualization\" could help, but Liberty had begun to cry.  Parker explained that she needed to imagine the drugs as a force that would move like spaceships through her system and obliterate the cancer cells.  Liberty admitted that she had never been so frightened.\n\n\nJack and Carly waited to see Parker's school principal, and they talked about Liberty.  Jack finally said that it was killing him to exchange small talk with Carly, but just then the principal appeared to escort them to his office.  Neither Jack nor Carly had any idea that Parker had been showing up for morning classes, but he was gone by early afternoon.  Jack took offense at the principal's not-so-veiled reference to the possibility of Carly's drinking again as \"turmoil in the house.\"\n\n\nJack told the principal that Carly had been sober for months, and if the principal had done his homework, he would have known that Parker was upset because Liberty had leukemia and was fighting for her life.  Jack chided the man to \"do the math\" next time, and he stood up and declared that he and Carly were done.  They went to the farm where they spotted Parker's bike outside.  Jack and Carly walked upstairs and opened Liberty's door to find both the teens asleep on Liberty's bed.  They decided that chewing Paker out for missing school could wait.\n\n\nJack was still riled about the principal's allusion to Carly's alcoholism, and Carly admitted that she had fallen off the wagon recently for a brief moment.  She told Jack that she had ordered a six-pack of beer and a pizza on the night she expected him to return to living at her house, but that had not happened because Janet had broken the news to Jack about Liberty's illness.  Carly had taken the beer out to the lake, but again she had drunk only one sip and dumped the rest and gone to another AA meeting.\n\n\nParker joined them downstairs, and he apologized for cutting classes.  Jack said that they were proud of him for being so caring about Liberty, and Carly called her son \"amazing.\"  Jack asked Parker to let them know when he felt he had to leave school and be with Liberty, and they would notify the teachers.  Parker said that Liberty was very tired and scared, and he was worried that the doctors could not save her.  His parents talked about having faith, and Parker admitted that he couldn't imagine life without Liberty.  Carly hugged him, and Parker went back upstairs.\n\n\nCarly complimented Jack by saying that Parker was growing up just like Jack; he was brave, strong, and loving.  Jack leaned over and kissed Carly, who struggled but finally pulled away.  She said that they could not do that, especially there, and she warned Jack never to touch her like that again.  Carly grabbed her coat and took off.\n\n\nUpstairs, Parker lay next to Liberty again, and she awakened.  She smiled at him and reminded him that she was going to get worse before she got better.  Parker said he was in for the long haul, and besides, he had seen her throw up before.  He offered to hold her hair back while she \"hurled,\" and that made Liberty smile.  She said she probably wouldn't have hair by then, so Parker said he would hold her by the ears.\n\n\nLuke stopped by the police station and explained to an officer that his father, Damian Grimaldi, had disappeared mysteriously.  The policeman said that finding Damian would be their top priority, but he had no news for Luke about his Aunt Meg.\n\n\nLily arrived home with groceries, and she was surprised to find Meg hiding in the house.  Lily made a break for the door, but Meg beat her to it and prevented her from leaving.  Meg said that she had been hiding so that she would not have to return to Deerbrook, and she ranted about Damian, but Lily said that no one knew where Damian was.  Meg called Damian evil and declared that he had conned both of them into believing his lies.  Lily was angry that Meg had hurt her with broken glass, and she asked why, \"in God's name,\" Meg thought that Lily would help her.\n\n\nMeg cried out that she had threatened Lily because Damian had set her up.  Then Meg realized that Damian had poisoned his own wedding cake in order to \"seal the deal\" on Meg as a suspect.  Lily did not know what to believe, but suddenly the women heard police sirens in the distance.  When Meg realized the sirens were getting closer, she cried, \"What did you do, Lily?\"  Lily admitted that she had triggered a silent alarm because she was frightened.  Lily then wanted to know if Meg had done something to Damian, but Meg was frantic.  Meg started rambling about not seeing Eliza for days at a time, but she couldn't believe that Lily had summoned the cops.  She yelled at Lily to \"go to hell\" as she ran out the door.\n\n\nHolden and Molly sat in Java and tried to figure out where Meg might have gone.  Molly said that Holden had the best chance of determining that, and Luke walked in and joined them.  Holden asked if Luke was all right, and Luke said that he needed to tell Holden that he had gone to the police about Damian's being missing.  Holden was not pleased, and he said that Damian was gone because he was only concerned about saving his own skin.  Luke was worried that Damian had not left town, or even worse, that Meg had found him before he had a chance to leave.\n\n\nHolden attempted to calm the boy down, but Luke was insistent that something about Damian's disappearance made no sense.  Luke was determined to find out exactly what had happened.  Holden was worried that with the police involved, it would be much more difficult to find Meg.  Molly got a text message from the television station and said she had an assignment, so she ran out.  Holden continued by telling Luke that he was much more worried about finding his sister than Damian Grimaldi.  Holden felt they had all earned the right not to have to think about Damian anymore.\n\n\nLuke admitted that he knew Damian had done some inexcusable acts, but then he referred to him as his \"father,\" and Holden went ballistic and shouted, \"I'm your father!\"  Then he apologized to Luke, and the boy said that Holden had raised him and would always be his \"dad.\"  Holden was positive that Damian had left Oakdale, but Luke would not let it go.  He needed Damian to tell him face-to-face why he had hurt the family.  Holden suggested that he search for Meg, and Luke could concentrate on Noah, and Luke agreed.\n\n\nThe two drove home and were shocked to see police cars in their driveway.  Lily explained that Meg had shown up and asked for Lily's help, but Lily had managed to press the silent alarm button.  Holden was angry at his ex-wife, and Luke took a call that summoned him back to the shipping company.  Lily and Holden continued to argue about what might have happened to Damian.  He ranted at her to back off so that he could find Meg.  When Holden insisted that his sister had done nothing to Damian, Lily demanded to know what Holden knew that she didn't.\n\n\nMeg ran from Lily's house through the trees, to avoid the police.  She reached a street, and a car pulled up.  The driver was Molly, who shouted at Meg to get in.  Meg did so, and Molly took off and drove quite a distance away.  Finally she pulled over and told Meg that she had figured out what was going on because of an alert from work, but she promised that she had mentioned nothing to Holden.  Meg said that she had been living in the boiler room of the Lakeview, and had been dodging maids and valets.  She begged Molly to drive her out of state.\n\n\nMeg almost broke down when she thought about not seeing Eliza for many days, and she asked Molly not to tell Holden that she had seen Meg.  Molly said she could not do that to Holden, and that angered Meg, who jumped out of the car.  Molly followed Meg, and finally got her to stop.  She tried to persuade Meg not to run, and she said she knew the family would take care of Meg, just as they were taking care of Liberty.  Meg did not know that anything was wrong with Liberty, so she was shocked to hear that the teen had leukemia.  Molly asked Meg what would happen if Meg had the correct bone marrow to help Liberty, and Meg realized that Molly believed her about Sharkey, the orderly, and Damian's lies.\n\n\nMolly said that they had also caught Grady in his lies, and Meg was stunned that her family knew the truth.  Meg questioned why Lily had called the cops, and Molly replied, \"Because she's Lily.\"  The two of them got back into Molly's car, and Meg finally admitted that she needed help to recover.  Molly reassured her that Meg would get good treatment at Deerbrook, so Meg agreed to go back there.  First, however, she asked Molly to drive her to Memorial so that she could get her bone marrow tested for Liberty.\n\n\nLuke met with the first mate of the Grimaldi freighter that had left for Malta the week before.  The mate said that just before the ship had arrived at Malta, he had seen a beaten and bloodied man on the deck below, but by the time he had gotten down there, the man was gone.  The first mate assumed that the body had washed overboard.\n\n\n",

Molly and Meg have a long talk and Molly persuades Meg that her family is horrified by what Damian did to her and they love her and want her to get well.
