Simon explained to Jack that Bartleby Shears was trying to pay Simon back for the eight years Bartleby had spent in prison.  Jack left for the station to put out an immediate APB for Bartleby.  Meanwhile, Katie and Bartleby were at Java Underground, admiring the gift Katie had helped select for Bartleby's mother.  Lisa met Bartleby and was immediately suspicious of him, so Isaac called Simon to report that Katie was at Java Underground with Bartleby.  \n\n\nSimon called Jack, then Simon rushed to Java to save Katie.  Simon was taking Katie away when Jack rushed in and took Bartleby to the police station for questioning.  As Bartleby passed Simon, he snarled, \"You'll pay for this, Frazier.\"  Back at home, Simon told Katie that Bartleby was a bad guy and that Simon was afraid that Bartleby would hurt Katie.  The two agreed to try to make a baby that night, and Katie went upstairs to get ready for bed.  The phone rang, and Jack told Simon that he had been forced to let Bartleby go after questioning him.  \n\n\nSimon heard a noise outside, and finding Bartleby there, grabbed him by the lapels and threatened, \"Stay away from my wife, or I'll kill you!\"  Simon refused to help Bartleby in his confidence scheme, but Bartleby threatened to have his mates kill Katie, and then Simon, if Simon did not help him.  Simon finally agreed, but asked for three days, which he would use to break Katie's heart and keep her from following him.  Simon went back in the house and told Katie that he never wanted a baby with her.  Simon slammed out the door, then collapsed outside, brokenhearted.\n\n\nChris went to the police station to apologize to Hal and Emily, but he told them that he still believed that Will had not started the fire.  He asked Hal for permission to get Tom Hughes to help question Will, but Hal refused and asked Chris to leave.  Emily followed Chris out the door and asked him why he was so convinced that Will had not started the fire.  Chris explained that there was no trace of the accelerant that had started the fire on Will's hands.  Chris agreed not to bother Hal or Barbara, but he told Emily that he was determined to find out the truth, even if his search ended his medical career.  Emily went back inside and reassured Hal that their family would be back together soon.\n\n\nWhile Paul and Rose were at the bar, waiting for Mitzi to arrive, Paul was disturbed to find that Rose had talked to Mitzi daily when she was in Europe, while she was not in contact with him.  However, the two agreed to talk about nothing more than one day in the past, which led them to reminisce about the water fight and the kiss the night before.  As they kissed again, Barbara burst in and interrupted them, taking Paul to the side to talk to him.  \n\n\nMitzi rushed in and was ready to see the new business, but Rose admitted that the bank hadn't loaned her the money yet.  Before she went upstairs to unpack, Mitzi advised Rose not to let Paul get away.  Barbara asked Paul to become a partner in her new children's line, but Paul refused, saying that a partnership with her might get between him and Rose.  Rose walked up to Barbara and Paul, and Barbara, glaring at Rose, withdrew her offer to Paul, spitting, \"He's all yours, Rosie.\"\n\n\nMarshall asked why Jessica had gotten the court to release him into her custody, since that meant he would be living with her.

Bonnie asked Isaac if she could stay with him that night until she could find a room the next day.  Marshall reminded Jessica that it would be almost impossible for the two of them to resist each other.  Jessica denied that she would have any problem, defiantly standing there with her shirt unbuttoned a little too far.  After Marshall went upstairs, Jessica called Ben and left a message for him to call her, but she didn't tell him why she was calling.\n\n\n",
