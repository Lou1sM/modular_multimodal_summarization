Jack told Carly she was \"like Lucy Ricardo on the edge.\" After Jack left, Carly called a neighbor to watch the kids then headed to the strip club. Nick was already there, asking to get in on another poker game. \n\n\nCarly received a call from the neighbor saying her son was ill, so Carly had to leave, but her car wouldn't start. When she told Nick, he offered to give her a ride, but she refused, saying she wouldn't ride with him if he were the last person on earth. However, when she found out it would take 30 minutes before a taxi could pick her up, Carly swallowed her pride and asked Nick for the ride after all; he made her apologize for her previous attitude before agreeing to take her home. When they arrived at her house, Nick asked if she planned on going inside, wearing all that makeup, and then he wiped off her lipstick for her. Jack opened the door suddenly and asked them what was going on.\n\n\nAt Java, Maddie had bought food and drinks for Gwen and Will. Casey told her he wanted to apologize to her for the way he had acted about Nate; Maddie shrugged off his apology and told Casey that she was on her way to have a picnic with Nate, but when Nate showed up unexpectedly, Casey realized Maddie hadn't actually had plans with him. Maddie covered by telling Nate it was supposed to be a surprise, which confused Nate, who thought Maddie didn't really want to see him again. Casey was amused by the turn of events, but Maddie brushed him off and then asked Nate to leave after Casey went back into Java.\n\n\nGwen and Will were still in hiding, but Gwen told Will she was happy just to be with him. They heard a noise, but then Maddie walked in with food, drinks, and a game plan. Maddie later had a fantasy that was like a 1940s movie, like Casablanca, in which she was helping Gwen and Will escape the country; as Gwen and Will left, Margo arrived and told Maddie she had to take her away. Then Casey walked in, telling Maddie he needed to tell her how he really felt about her, but as he said her name repeatedly, Maddie snapped out of her fantasy and found Casey calling her name and asking her what was wrong. \n\n\nAt the Wagon Wheel Motel, Margo knocked on \"Mr. Pollack's\" door, saying she had a search warrant and wanted to search his room. Paul let her in, but in the darkness, she didn't recognize him in his disguise. She showed him pictures of Will and Gwen and asked whether he had seen them, but he said he hadn't. As Margo left, Paul had a coughing attack, which Margo thought sounded pretty severe. She asked him if he wanted a ride to Memorial Hospital to see a doctor, but he declined. \n\n\nMargo told the motel manager that Mr. Pollack sounded like a seriously ill man then she got a call from Maddie. Paul overheard that it was about Gwen and Will and that Margo was going to meet Maddie at Java in ten minutes. Margo went to Java and asked Maddie what she had found. Maddie said she had been up on the rooftop where Gwen and Will liked to go sometimes and had found a bus schedule with several departure times circled, plus takeout food containers in the trash can. Margo thanked her and left. Casey told Maddie he wanted to know what was up because Maddie had told him she was on Gwen's side, yet she seemed to be turning Gwen in. Maddie simply told him she believed in doing the right thing.\n\n\nKatie was talking to a wedding planner when Mike arrived and said the April wedding would have to wait because his brother Mark had an urgent need for Mike to consult with him on a big project in Latvia. A disappointed Katie told him she was afraid they'd never get married, but Mike assured her it was just a three-week trip. Katie wanted to go with him, but Mike tried to talk her out of it, telling her she'd have to cancel her TV show obligations and that she wouldn't see him much in Latvia, anyway. Ultimately, he left the decision up to her. \n\n\nAs Mike got up to get coffee, he accidentally knocked a figurine of a bride off the table then tried to glue it back together. After that, he had to offer Katie more reassurances that their relationship was not jinxed. He also told Katie that he had asked Nick to stay with her while Mike was in Latvia.\n\n\nAt Jennifer's apartment, Madame Nina Lacoste told Jennifer it was not too late for her to make peace with Paul, but Dusty arrived and interrupted them before Jennifer could find out what that meant. When Dusty left the room, Madame Lacoste gave Jennifer her card; Jennifer saw that it said Madame Lacoste was a psychic and asked her to leave, crumpling up the card. When Dusty asked what that had been all about, Jennifer lied to him, but he knew she was lying. \n\n\nLater, Jennifer had a nightmare in which Paul went to her apartment and asked her to forgive him; she told him she'd try, but he said that was not good enough, took out a gun, and shot himself. She awakened and rushed over to find Madame Lacoste's card to call her. Dusty walked out and asked why she was so upset; she told him she'd had a bad dream about Paul and asked him to go get her some aspirin because it had given her a headache. While he was out of the room, she called Madame Lacoste and asked if she could go to her apartment. Madame Lacoste said she would be there, hung up the phone, and turned to Paul, saying, \"She took the bait.\"\n\n\n",

He almost blows it, though, when she hears his cough and tries to take him to the hospital. Dusty interrupts Jennifer's meeting with Madame LaCoste, but later, after a vision of Paul, she calls the psychic to set up a meeting, not realising that Paul hired her. When Carly's sitter has to go, Carly needs to find a ride home from the strip club and when Chardonnay is unable to help, she reluctantly accepts Nick's help.
