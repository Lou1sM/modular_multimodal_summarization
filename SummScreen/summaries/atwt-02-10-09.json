Janet reminded him how important it was for him to be upbeat for Sage's school play that afternoon. Carly arrived with tickets for Janet and Jack, and she announced that Sage looked amazing in her Tinkerbell costume. Carly's phone rang, but she did not take the call. Instead, she went outside and found her caller, Craig, brimming with good news. He told her that he had found a distributor for their designer vodka, and the man wanted to meet with them in Chicago right away. Carly was joyful until she realized the time would conflict with the school play. Craig explained that the meeting with the distributor was a one-shot deal and could affect their whole financial future. When Carly hesitated, Craig chided her for not being serious about providing for her family. Reluctant as she was to miss \"Peter Pan,\" Carly figured out if she got someone else to transport her daughter back and forth and help her dress and apply her makeup, she could make it back in time to see Sage perform. \n\n\nInside the diner, Jack watched Carly's discussion with Craig, while Janet talked about all the preparation time she needed for her first public appearance as Sage's stepmother. Jack appreciated her concern, and the two of them smooched. Carly returned to ask Jack or Janet to pick up Sage from school, get her into her costume, and do her makeup. Janet assured Carly that she could do subtle makeup, so the two women agreed on that plan. \n\n\nIn New York, Dusty told Josie and Meg that the cops had nothing new to report. Meg agonized that the kidnappers might get scared and bolt if the police got too close. Paul arrived and said Barbara was resting. Josie talked with him and suggested Paul should look inside himself for a vision to give them answers, but Paul said he had been trying that already, to no avail. Dusty thought the idea was nothing but \"stupid hocus-pocus,\" and told Josie to drop it. Meg begged Paul to continue trying, however, so he held Eliza's blanket and concentrated. Suddenly Paul saw red flower petals and then heard the howl of an animal, perhaps a wolf. After thinking longer, he changed the animal to a dog, possibly pulling a sled. Dusty picked up a New York guidebook and began reading. \n\n\nBack at home, Carly was reluctant to leave with Craig, and she confessed she was fearful of success. Craig talked her through her phobia and urged her to take the leap for her kids. Carly left Sage's costume for her and put a bag of pixie dust on top. \n\n\nAs Dusty was perusing the guidebook, Paul spotted a photo of a Siberian Husky in Central Park. They decided to check it out in person, and went to the park. They located the statue, but they could see no flowers in the snow. Finally Josie spotted a couple who appeared to be waiting for something, and the woman was carrying a bouquet of red roses. Paul went to speak with them and asked if they were there \"about the baby.\" The nervous couple answered yes, so Paul asked them to come with him. First, however, he took the roses from the woman and dropped them in the trash. As soon as they had left, Meg and Dusty scooped up the roses and took the couple's place. Before long, the carjacker walked up the path and approached them, asking if they had the money. Dusty assured him they did and asked about the baby. The kidnapper said he had the \"sweetest little baby\" they ever saw. Dusty handed over $5000, and the thug told them to wait there. As the kidnapper walked away, Dusty told Meg they had to follow him, but she was so frightened that she talked him out of it. Josie, however, was waiting by some trees, and she began to follow the man. \n\n\nPaul led the couple through the park until the woman became suspicious and asked where they were going. Paul got angry and yelled that they were disgusting people to attempt to buy a baby. The couple took off running when it became apparent that Paul was out of control. \n\n\nJack and Janet picked up Sage at school, and the girl was concerned about who was going to do her hair and makeup. Janet said she would do it, but Sage was worried that Janet could not do it in the special way her mother did. They picked up the costume and headed for the farm. \n\n\nIn Chicago, Carly and Craig finished their meeting with the distributor and waited for the valet to bring their car. Craig was pleased that the distributor had promised to even consider their offer to do business, but Carly was upset that they were not yet on the road headed to Oakdale and Sage's performance. The distributor came outside and gave them his decision to represent them, inviting them back inside to finalize the details. Carly was reluctant to spend more time in Chicago, but Craig persuaded her to go back to work. \n\n\nJosie followed the kidnapper, who led her back to a car where his accomplice waited. The two men decided to take Dusty's money and leave town. They said they could always sell the baby to someone in another location. When they opened the door to the car, Josie heard Eliza crying, so she ran to the car and yelled for help. One of the thugs struck her hard in the face with his fist, and Josie lost consciousness. He pushed her into the back seat with the baby, and they took off. \n\n\nAt the farm, Janet was ready to begin Sage's transformation into Tinkerbell. Jack was nervous that Janet could not do \"subtle,\" so she quietly threatened him with a sex boycott if he didn't go outside and wait. Sage missed her mother, and Janet admitted that \"subtle\" was really not in her, but she would do her best. She applied makeup and finished with some glitter on Sage's cheeks, which made her sparkle. Sage was delighted with the result, and she ran upstairs to get her wings. Jack returned and gave Janet a big kiss. \n\n\nCarly and Craig finally finished the deal, but Carly was so anxious to get on the road that she asked him to fetch the car himself. They took off for Oakdale, way behind schedule. \n\n\nBack in the park, Meg worried because the man who took their money had not returned with her baby. Dusty realized the crook was not coming back, and he motioned for Paul to return. Meg knew Dusty had been right and they should have followed the money, but Paul suggested they find out if Josie knew anything. They could not find Josie, so they returned to the neighborhood where Paul had lost the car. Paul called Josie's phone, but she did not answer. It began to snow again, but the three of them decided to canvas the neighborhood and offer money for information. \n\n\nJosie regained consciousness and held Eliza in the car. When the kidnappers stopped, she asked them to let the baby go, but they said they needed the kid more than they needed her. The men forced Josie into a building, but not before she managed to drop a colorful bracelet in the snow. They locked her and Eliza in a storeroom. \n\n\nCarly and Craig dashed into Sage's school, but the play was finished. Carly cursed at Craig, and they found Janet and Jack waiting for Sage with flowers. Janet said Sage did well and looked beautiful, and the school had videoed the production, so Carly could see it as many times as she wished. Sage arrived and hugged her mother, not knowing Carly had missed the entire performance. \n\n\nMeg questioned why they were trudging in the snow, so the trio decided to search 15 more minutes and then go notify the police. Dusty spotted Josie's bracelet in the snow, and when they stopped moving and got quiet, Meg could hear Eliza crying from inside the closest building. As they approached the door, the two kidnappers exited, and Paul and Dusty jumped them as Meg ran inside. She located the storeroom and found Josie and Eliza. \n\n\nSagre asked to spend the night at the farm and declared she had just spent the best day of her life. She wanted to see Aunt Emma and visit Faith and Natalie while she was still wearing her costume. She also hugged Janet and thanked her for the awesome makeup. Jack and Janet were pleased with how it all went. \n\n\nCraig took Carly home and was in the mood to celebrate their stellar business deal. Carly was not in party mode, however. She could only think that she had missed Sage's play, so Craig took a special bottle of vodka from his briefcase and poured toasts for the two of them. Carly relaxed and proposed they drink to \"the best of everything.\" \n\n\nMeg, carrying her baby, and Josie left the building and found the police taking away the kidnappers. They also arrested Paul for taking Eliza from Meg. They looked at Josie, but both Meg and Paul asked that no charges be filed against her, so the police let her go. \n\n\nMeg thanked Josie for her part in rescuing Eliza, and she left with Dusty. In the squad car, Paul saw a cold and forlorn Josie standing in the snow, watching everyone depart.\n\n\n",
