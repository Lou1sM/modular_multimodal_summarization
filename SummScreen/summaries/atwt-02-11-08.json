As she resisted, a shot rang out, and Sam rolled off of Carly onto the floor. He was shot in the shoulder and lay on the ground, motionless. As Carly got up, she was surprised to see Parker at the door, holding a shotgun.\n\n\nA stunned Carly looked at Parker, who told his mom that he wasn't going to let Sam hurt her. Carly asked Parker to put the gun down, but Parker refused until he knew Sam was dead. Carly told Parker that she believed Sam was dead, so Parker dropped the weapon and ran out of Metro. Carly chased after her son and left Sam bleeding on the floor.\n\n\nCarly caught up to Parker in Old Town and told him to talk to her, and the two went to the local church. Once there, she asked why he had gone to Metro. He explained that after talking to her earlier, he'd known Sam would hurt her, so he'd taken the gun from the farm and gone to Metro. Carly said they needed to call Jack, but Parker begged her not to call his father. Parker was concerned that Jack would be angry that he'd taken the gun from the farm and would turn him in.\n\n\nParker wanted his mother to leave town with him and help him get away, like she had when Simon had been in trouble with the law. Carly tried to explain to Parker that they needed to do the right thing and that she wouldn't ever let go of him. She went on to tell Parker that she knew he'd shot Sam to protect her and that his father would believe it too. She insisted that they call Jack and get his help, and Parker agreed. They reached Jack and told him they needed to meet with him right away.\n\n\nAs Carly and Parker waited for Jack, she promised Parker that everything would be all right. When Jack arrived, he was concerned with why Parker had sneaked out of the house, and Carly explained that Parker had sensed something had been wrong and had gone to find her at Metro. She went on to tell Jack that Parker had stopped Sam from raping her. A concerned Jack said they should get Carly to the hospital, and he would get an APB out on Sam right away. Carly then told Jack that Parker had shot Sam with the gun from the farm.\n\n\nJack was surprised that Carly and Parker hadn't called 9-1-1 from Metro, and he wanted to call the station right away, but Carly stopped him. Carly was worried that Parker would go to jail and begged Jack not to call the police, but he explained they needed to call the authorities immediately to avoid any suspicion. She convinced Jack to check on Sam first and see how badly he was injured before going to the police. Jack agreed, and the three returned to Metro.\n\n\nUpon arriving at the club, Jack saw Sam on the floor and checked his pulse. He confirmed what everyone had feared -- Sam was dead. He immediately called in the shooting to the station and got ready to take Parker in. Carly tried to persuade Jack not to take Parker in, but he explained that the best thing for them to do was to tell the police how Sam had tried to rape Carly and let the authorities work everything out. Jack embraced Parker and encouraged his son to be brave.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna were busy working at Al's Diner and began to discuss the disastrous love life of Katie and Brad. Henry cautioned Vienna to stop meddling before someone got hurt, but she was convinced that Katie and Brad were destined to be together. He believed Katie was better off away from Brad, but Vienna would not give up.\n\n\nKatie arrived at Al's to pick up a cake and overheard the two talking about her relationship with Brad. Both Henry and Vienna offered their opinions of Katie's love life, but Katie explained that she and Brad had no future. Katie got the cake and headed to Tom and Margo's for dinner. Henry and Vienna continued their bickering over Katie and Brad, so Henry decided to leave the diner to take a break.\n\n\nMargo arrived home, where Tom and Casey greeted her. Tom and Margo discussed her day, and she explained Gwen and Will's recent trouble with Sophie kidnapping Hallie. Margo encouraged Casey to call his friends and check to see how they were doing, but Casey was reluctant to get involved with his old friends since his return from prison. As Margo tried to convince him of the importance of staying in contact with his old friends, Katie arrived for dinner and greeted her nephew. She sensed she had interrupted something, and Casey mentioned that his parents were giving him another lecture about returning to life in Oakdale.\n\n\nKatie explained that her friends, Vienna and Henry, both kept pushing her love life in different directions, and she understood how meddling some people could be. As dinner continued, Casey received a call from a former prison buddy named Matt. He wanted to see Casey right away and told him they had business to discuss. Casey was apprehensive at first but agreed to meet up with Matt. Right after Casey left, Margo got a call from Jack explaining what had happened at Metro. Jack asked Margo to meet him at the station with Tom to help deal with the situation.\n\n\nDown at the station, Margo took Parker in for questioning. Tom attended the interrogation as Parker's lawyer, while both Jack and Carly sat in to hear what their son had to say about Sam's shooting. Margo asked Parker if the shooting had been an accident and Parker responded that it hadn't. He detailed for Margo the events leading up to Sam's killing. When Parker explained that he'd gotten the gun and then gone to Metro, Margo pointed out to everyone that Parker had had the gun before he'd known that Sam had been attacking Carly.\n\n\nTom stopped the interview and met with Carly and Jack outside. Tom explained to the two that Margo was proving that Parker had gone to Metro to kill Sam before he'd ever known Carly had been in danger. He and Jack realized that a prosecutor could prove Parker had acted with premeditation in Sam's killing. Carly tried to explain that Parker had always had perceptive powers and had known she had been in trouble, but Tom and Jack realized that Parker might be in deep trouble.\n\n\nMargo walked out and told Jack and Carly she needed to hold Parker until they could meet with a judge. Jack and Carly went in to tell Parker he had to stay there for the night. They promised their son they would work together to make sure he was safe and that he wouldn't be in jail long. Margo escorted Parker to lockup as an emotional Carly broke down in Jack's arms.\n\n\nCasey greeted his prison buddy in Old Town and learned that the prison guard who'd helped them get out early wanted the rest of his money immediately. Casey told his friend, Matt, not to worry and that he would find a way to get the guard what they owed him. Casey arrived at the Lakeview and noticed one of the bartenders was very busy. He told the guy he would watch the bar so the bartender could get some other things done, and once the bartender left him behind the bar, Casey eyed the cash register. When the opportunity arose to take the money, Casey grabbed it and headed out.\n\n\nHenry arrived at Yo's Bar and found Brad sitting at the bar. He wasn't happy to see Brad there but decided to sit there and have a drink nonetheless. Henry explained that he was there because he and Vienna kept fighting over Brad and Katie's relationship. Brad was discouraged to hear that Katie believed they had no future together. He explained that because he was Jack's brother, he'd really never stood a fair chance with Katie and that he really loved her. Henry reminded Brad that Katie had had many crazy relationships before he and Jack had happened along and that if he really loved her, he would just let Katie get her life together. Brad reminisced about his memories of Katie, and a frustrated Henry decided to refocus Brad's attention by taking him to a local poker game.\n\n\nIn a room at the Lakeview, Brad and Henry played in a friendly but high-stakes game of poker. Brad was distracted and drunk but tried to keep up with the game. Henry won big, just as Vienna arrived and told Henry to leave immediately. One of the players, Gray, was obviously taken with Vienna's beauty and greeted her enthusiastically.\n\n\nHenry refused to leave the game because he was winning, but Vienna took a seat in the room and told her boyfriend she wouldn't leave without him. Henry explained he had to play at least one more hand, but Vienna and Gray convinced Henry to leave. Vienna was grateful for Gray's help, but Gray looked to want more from Vienna than her gratitude. Brad remained behind, and the poker players looked to win their losses back from a visibly drunk Brad.\n\n\nKatie sat at Java, enjoying some coffee, and saw a naked Brad walking through town. She grabbed an old tablecloth and ran after him. She asked Brad what he was doing strolling through town without clothes and noticed immediately that he was drunk. Brad tried to explain what had happened but had no real explanation. He instead decided to kiss Katie and lost his tablecloth in the moment.\n\n\nA cop saw a naked Brad kissing Katie and asked her if she wanted to press charges. At first, Katie tried to explain Brad's behavior to the cop but later decided a night in jail for indecent exposure might do Brad a little good. Brad begged Katie to help, but she refused. Bonnie saw what was going on and stepped in to help Brad. With Bonnie's help, the cop decided to let Brad go. Katie looked on as Bonnie escorted Brad home.\n\n\n",
