Teri offered her more coffee, but Carly said that wouldn't solve any of her problems.  Teri admired a design sketch, and Carly told her that Liberty had helped on it.  Teri thanked Carly for getting tested as a potential bone marrow donor and also for sitting with Liberty during her first chemotherapy session.\n\n\nJack found Janet asleep at Emma's kitchen table, so he covered her with a blanket and walked out quietly.  Janet awoke almost immediately, however, and she called out for Jack, but she had missed him.  Janet went to Memorial to give blood in order to find out if she was a suitable bone marrow donor for Liberty.  She found Dusty was ahead of her, and he had already been tested.  Dusty asked if Jack was with Janet, but she said no; he had already given a sample.  Janet said she had a phobia about needles, so Dusty offered to stay and make sure she didn't pass out.\n\n\nA nurse entered, so Dusty made goofy faces to distract Janet from looking at the needle.  The nurse completed the blood draw, and Janet did fine.  Finally Dusty told her that she could open her eyes any time, and he held her hands.   Teri walked in, and Janet began explaining how helpful Dusty had been.  Dusty left, and Janet thanked Teri for stepping up, as well.  Janet was pleased that everybody she loved had shown up, and Teri suddenly asked her sister if she loved Dusty Donovan.\n\n\nJanet took offense at that and reminded Teri that she was married.  Teri said that she wasn't blind, and she could see what was going on between Janet and their \"boss.\"  Janet let loose a string of babble about when she and Jack were apart, so she and Dusty -- and then she stopped talking.  Teri realized that Janet had slept with Dusty, and Janet admitted that it had only happened once and would never happen again.  Teri said she could tell when she walked into the room that Janet had \"feelings\" for Dusty.\n\n\nJack walked by Fashions and saw the Valentine decorations in the window.  He realized that he had not gotten Janet anything for the holiday, so he walked in and asked the sales clerk for help.  She began to show him lacy nightgowns and lingerie, and Carly walked in.  She spotted Jack holding a hanger with a black lacy nightie on it, and they stared at each other.  Jack told the clerk that a dress was more his wife's style, so she asked Janet's size and went to look.  An embarrassed Jack told Carly that he had \"completely spaced\" on Valentine's Day, and Carly assured him he needn't feel guilty about buying his wife a present.\n\n\nCarly went on to say that whatever went on between them before Liberty got sick was a \"complete non-issue.\"  Carly began looking through the dresses and found a lovely blue one that she recommended to Jack.  Jack hung up the black lacy one but spotted another sexy one.  He looked at it a while and then told Carly that she had one just like it when they were in Montana.  That memory upset Carly, so Jack left the store, but Carly soon followed.  Jack told her she was more than just \"an ex-wife,\" but Carly said she couldn't be more than that.  They sat on a bench, and Carly rested her head on Jack's shoulder.\n\n\nDusty walked around the corner and approached them.  Carly hastily explained that she was helping Jack pick out a Valentine's present for his wife.  Jack wished Carly a happy Valentine's Day, and he ran back into Fashions to buy the blue dress.  Dusty smiled at Carly, who walked into Al's Diner.  Dusty went to the diner, as well, and joined Carly at the counter.  \n\n\nCarly finally suggested that he \"cut to the chase\" and say what he wanted to say.  Before Dusty could begin, however, she said she had only been helping Jack pick out a dress for Janet.  She said Jack was her friend, and Dusty told her Janet was his friend.  Carly said there was nothing going on between her and Jack.\n\n\nJack left Old Town and returned to the farm, and Janet arrived soon afterward.  She told him that she had gone to the hospital to get the blood test, but she was still worried that they might have to use a donor.  Jack handed her a bag from Fashions and told her it was an early Valentine's present.  Janet opened it and was delighted to find the blue dress that Carly had picked out.  Janet wanted to know how Jack had chosen such a perfect present by himself.  She tried it on, and Jack said she was beautiful.\n\n\nJack and Janet kissed, and Jack tried to go further, but Janet said she wasn't ready yet.  She said that on Valentine's Day, they would have their special dinner and then...she would see.  That was the best Janet could do at the moment, and as she went upstairs to change, she remembered Dusty's holding her hand and helping her through the needle stick at the hospital.  Jack also recalled Carly's putting her head on his shoulder.\n\n\nPaul received the lab report on the DNA sample from Mick Dante, and he was stunned to read that the sample matched that of the one on file for James Stenbeck.  Emily snatched the report from Paul's hands and screamed that she could not believe it.  Paul thought that James was having one last laugh on him from the grave, and he grabbed his coat and ran out of Fairwinds.\n\n\nAt the police station, Mick told Margo that \"Mick\" did not really exist; he had \"invented\" him.  Mick claimed to be James Stenbeck, but Margo said that she knew Stenbeck, and Mick was \"no James Stenbeck.\"  Mick said Margo could not hold him at the station because she had nothing on him, but Margo said that in spite of having James Stenbeck's arrogance and bullying skills, Mick wasn't going anywhere until she had heard from a judge.  Margo left Mick alone, and he suddenly suffered another splitting headache, as James and Mick appeared to be wrestling for control over his mind.\n\n\nPaul arrived at the station and demanded to know where Mick Dante was.  Margo stopped him and said the question was more like \"who\" was Mick Dante.  Paul alleged that Mick had put his wife in a coma, but Margo reminded Paul that he had no proof of that.  Paul said that he and Emily had trusted Mick and had even allowed him to move into their home.  \n\n\nMargo granted Paul five minutes with Dante, but she sent an officer in with him.  Mick asked what had taken Paul so long to get there, and he called Paul \"son.\"  That enraged Paul, and Mick deduced that Paul had gotten the DNA results.  Paul accused him of falsifying the results, but Mick said that was not possible since Paul had picked the lab, and Mick was confined to jail.\n\n\nMick declared that Paul had the proof that Mick was his father, but Paul screamed that he was looking at the greatest con man of all con men.  Paul said he had a wonderful life that was real.  Then, out of the blue, Paul said that another thing that was real was Alison Stewart's imminent wedding to Casey Hughes.  Mick looked startled and asked why Paul had brought that up, so Paul said that Mick had gone after Alison first and had used her to get to him and Emily.  Paul warned Mick not to screw up that wedding, or else Paul would break him.  Mick got panicky, and his nose began to gush blood.  Paul called Mick \"a little freak,\" as Mick collapsed on the floor.\n\n\nIn the break room at Memorial, Casey told Alison that he was glad she was wearing her engagement ring again.  He questioned her pacing the house at night, but Alison chalked it up to bridal nerves.  Emily walked in and asked for a minute alone with Alison, so Casey excused himself.  Alison noticed how pale her sister was, as Emily handed her the DNA conclusions.  Alison read the report aloud, and then she screamed, \"Oh, my God!\" when she realized that Mick's sample matched that of James Stenbeck's.  Casey ran back in, but Alison told him that it was just a silly \"bride thing.\"  Casey was uncertain, but he left.\n\n\nAlison turned to Emily and gasped that her sister couldn't possibly believe that Mick Dante was really James Stenbeck.  Emily said that Mick, whoever he was, had played them all, and it was not good.  Alison read the report again, and she declared that it was simply not true.  Emily told her not to feel guilty but to concentrate on her wedding the next day.  Alison went back out on the floor to get back to work, and the ambulance arrived with Mick on a gurney.\n\n\nPaul ran in with the gurney and the paramedics, and he explained to Alison that Mick had suffered a massive nosebleed and then passed out.  Mick heard Alison's voice, and he briefly opened his eyes.  The orderlies transferred him to a bed, and Alison began cleaning off the blood.  Paul said that perhaps Mick would do everyone a favor and bleed to death, so Alison threw him out of the room.  She said she had a \"patient in crisis\" to tend to, and she kept calling Mick's name.\n\n\nMick opened his eyes and asked what had happened.  Alison said that she finally believed that the two of them were connected, as Mick had suggested.  The one thing she was positive of, however, was that Mick was not James Stenbeck.  She believed that something inside was destroying him, and she urged him to fight it.  Mick asked to speak to the police officer outside, so Alison asked the officer to step into the room.  When the cop walked in, Mick jumped him from behind the door and squeezed his throat until the cop passed out.  Mick stretched out his hand to Alison and asked her to go with him.\n\n\nCasey carried a box of gifts that the nurses had given Alison to his home.  Margo was at home, although she was on call for the station.  She asked Casey if Alison had mentioned Mick Dante lately, but before Casey could answer, Margo also asked how much Casey knew about Mick.  Casey didn't understand why his mom was asking, so Margo said that Mick had been arrested for assault and fraud.  Margo also told him that Mick was claiming to be James Stenbeck, and Casey laughed and said, \"So he's nuts, then.\"\n\n\nMargo said that Mick had a DNA report to prove it, but Casey chuckled and said that James was \"old, not to mention dead,\" but Margo asked if he knew anything about Alison and Mick together.  Casey said only that Alison had introduced Mick to Paul and Emily, who had subsequently invested in Mick's research.  Casey was positive that Alison didn't know anything about Mick's claim to be Stenbeck.  Margo said that Mick was locked in on Paul and Emily, but she wanted to figure out where Alison fit.\n\n\nCasey said he knew his fianc\u00e9e, and he accused his mother of \"taking pot shots\" at Alison and her family.  Margo denied that, but she believed that her son should \"seriously consider\" postponing his wedding. Casey got angry and shouted that Mick was no concern of his or Alison's.  He declared that he and his bride were getting married on schedule, the next day, as planned.\n\n\nPaul went home to Fairwinds, and Emily immediately saw blood on his clothes.  Paul explained about Mick's nosebleed, but he was sure it was all part of the scam.  Paul told Emily the sad part was that Mick drew out the self-loathing and humiliation that James did, so it was as if his father was still there.  Paul said it was as if James Stenbeck was \"sticking his hand out of the grave\" all over again.  \n\n\nEmily made Paul stop talking, and she kissed him.  Eliza began to fuss, so Emily went to get her.  Paul called the hospital to check on the status of their new patient, and he shrieked when he learned that Dante had escaped.  Paul took a pistol from the safe in the living room and left Fairwinds.  Emily returned to an empty living room.\n\n\nMick took Alison to the bell tower of the church, and she chewed him out for assaulting the cop.  She could not understand why Mick wanted people to believe that he was James Stenbeck.  She also asked why he was doing strange things, and Mick answered, \"Because James wants me to.\"  Ali said that James was dead, but Mick said he had fixed it so that Mick could finish what James couldn't.  He said that James wanted him to hurt all the people he was involved with, and Mick couldn't stop James from making him do it.  Only one person could stop it, Mick said, and that was Alison.\n\n\n",
