He said that if Jack put Carly's stuff in storage, their marriage would be over, yet there was a chance that the baby could be his.  After much persuasion, Jack finally agreed with Holden.\n\n\nMike tried to talk with Molly and told her to be civil, at least for the sake of the child.  He said, \"You're not this cold, Molly.\"  She was still very mad at him and told him she had everything figured out.  As she was leaving the Lakeview, Mike asked her where she was going.  Molly replied, \"Not that it's any of your business, but I think I'm going to pay Jack a visit.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Carly was back in Oakdale and \"ready to settle the score\" with Molly.  She tracked Molly down outside the Lakeview, where Craig also had assembled.  When Carly saw Molly, she asked what Molly had been doing with Jack.  Molly replied, \"Nothing you haven't done with my boyfriend.\"  Carly said Molly had to have seduced Jack, but Molly said it was mutual -- they had just looked at each other and then they were \"hot and heavy.\"  \n\n\nShe continued to upset Carly by saying Jack was the best she'd ever had and she was going back for more. Carly punched Molly in the face, and Molly fell to the ground.  Mike was also there and went to help Molly, but she refused his help.  She got up by herself and said, \"Excuse me.

Brady wanted to help out his old friend and volunteered to talk to Lucy for Aaron.  Brady went to see Lucy, who did recognize him.  He told Lucy there was no way that Aaron had slept with another girl.  She was friendly with Brady, but he got the impression that Lucy didn't want anything to do with Aaron.  \n\n\nBrady went back to tell his friend what had happened with Lucy.  Aaron stormed into the garage and started drinking beer.  He told Alison that he had made up his mind and if Lucy didn't want him, then he didn't want Lucy.  Aaron asked Alison to drink a beer with him. Alison was thrilled to be with Aaron and also happy because Emily had told her that Will's hearing was set and no matter what Chris Hughes found out, it wouldn't matter anyway.  \n\n\nLater on in the evening, Lucy looked at the pictures of Washington University.  Suddenly, she remembered her arguments with Alison.  She finally remembered the conversation and knew that Alison had started the fire.\n\n\nRosanna met Craig for dinner but not before receiving a call from the airline -- Air Mexico -- that his luggage would be sent to their home.
