Henry was obviously bothered that his girlfriend didn't want him to gamble but cheered up when Vienna turned on her seductive charms. The two shared a kiss, just as Henry's poker buddy, Gray, showed up. Gray was obviously taken with Vienna and kept staring at her. Vienna was not happy about Gray going to the diner and didn't want Henry anywhere near him because she feared he would talk Henry into a poker game.\n\n\nVienna decided to take care of Gray on her own and took his order but also took the opportunity to warn Gray against trying to entice Henry to gamble. Gray insisted he wouldn't dream of getting Henry to gamble. The two chatted about the diner and the menu, and all the while, Gray flirted with a seemingly unaware Vienna. Gray continued to flatter Vienna as Henry listened in on their conversation and began to get jealous. Henry pulled Vienna away and told her he didn't like Gray's tone and that he would take care of him.\n\n\nVienna was flattered that Henry was protective and watched as Henry told Gray to leave. Gray asked more about Vienna, but Henry explained that Gray had to accept that he and Vienna were committed to one another. As Gray prepared to leave, he told Henry he was on his way to a poker game and wished Henry could join him. Henry declined the invitation but obviously wanted to go. Vienna walked up and wanted to know what Gray had said to Henry, but he made an excuse and left the diner.\n\n\nHenry arrived at a room at the Lakeview and joined Gray and his pals in a game of poker. Henry quickly began to drink and lost numerous hands of poker, and Gray became more arrogant with each hand Henry lost. Henry started to win and decided to leave the game, but Gray's smug remarks drew him back in the hopes of winning big. Gray and Henry eventually went against one another in a high-stakes match that resulted in Henry losing big.\n\n\nWhen it was time to pay up, Henry admitted he didn't have the money available to meet his bet. Henry suggested he would give Gray the diner, but Gray offered to forgive Henry's debt if he could spend one night with Vienna. Henry was offended by the suggestion and quickly told Gray there was no way he would agree to Gray's indecent proposal. Gray reminded Henry how much losing the diner would hurt Vienna and questioned if she would be able to forgive him. A flustered Henry left to share the bad news with Vienna.\n\n\nBack at the diner, Vienna sensed something was wrong and wondered what Henry could be up to. When Henry arrived back at the diner, Vienna wanted to know where he had been and if he had been gambling. Henry denied gambling and claimed to have been out looking for treats for their puppy.\n\n\nMatt, Casey's friend from prison, showed up at Casey's house and said he'd stopped by for a friendly visit. Casey was not happy to see Matt but invited him in for a soda. Matt looked around and asked Casey about his family but seemed to know more than he let on. Casey and Matt headed to another room to play video games just as Margo returned home. She heard the boys talking and thought Matt's voice was that of her other son, Adam. She called up to the boys, thinking it was Casey and his brother, and was surprised when Casey went downstairs with Matt.\n\n\nMargo asked who Casey's friend was, and Matt told Margo he was a friend from Casey's days at Oakdale University. Matt tried to get on Margo's good side by talking about how Casey should go back to school. Tom arrived home and was introduced to Matt. Casey and Matt headed upstairs to finish their game while Margo told Tom that when she'd arrived home, she'd thought she'd heard Adam's voice and had been hopeful he had returned home. Tom comforted Margo, and they reflected on their missing son. In the meantime, Matt had returned to the room and overheard the entire conversation.\n\n\nOver lunch, Matt began to discuss that he wanted to be a lawyer, like Tom. He kept talking about how he would love to return to school, if he only had the money. Casey was dumbfounded by what he heard from Matt, while Tom and Margo were sympathetic to his struggle to return to school. When Matt hinted that he didn't have a place to stay, Margo immediately invited him to stay with them.\n\n\nWhen Margo and Tom left Casey and Matt alone, Casey wanted to know what Matt was thinking by lying to Casey's parents and staying with them. Matt told Casey not to worry and that he would be gone before Casey's parents ever figured out that they had been in prison together. Matt asked if Casey would be able to get him more money in a hurry like he had the other day.\n\n\nLucinda headed into the Lakeview bar and remembered one of her final conversations with Dusty before his murder. As she was recalling Dusty's belief that she'd had something to do with Memo 21, she expressed her remorse for not controlling Evan when he had gotten to town. Paul arrived and overheard Lucinda talking aloud. He asked her if she was all right. Lucinda explained she was sad about Dusty and the madness that her step-grandson Evan had caused in Oakdale. She didn't admit to taking Evan into town but explained that she believed she should have been more suspicious of Evan and that she might have saved Dusty.\n\n\nPaul offered his condolences and told Lucinda she shouldn't feel guilty about Evan's murderous rampage. He then congratulated Lucinda on getting her company back from Craig, but Lucinda explained the cost of getting it back had been too high. Paul didn't understand why Lucinda wasn't happy about getting her company back and offered to help her make everything better. Paul explained he had \"a plan\" that would destroy Craig, and Lucinda was excited at the prospect at finally getting Craig out of Oakdale.\n\n\nCraig arrived at his office, just as the signs were being taken down and ownership was returning to Lucinda. He went into Meg's office and saw her throwing out a picture of herself and Paul. He was happy to see that Meg was done with Paul and retrieved the picture from the trash to revel in the demise of Paul and Meg's love affair. Meg was not amused and told Craig it was none of his business. Craig told Meg that he believed if she and Paul were over, then he still had a chance with her.\n\n\nMeg explained to Craig that they had no future, but Craig said he just wanted a chance to be with her and have a family. Meg recounted Craig's failures as a father and told him she didn't want to have a family with him. He told her that he wasn't giving up on getting Lucy and Johnny back and wouldn't give up on her either. Craig detailed for Meg his frustration over losing Johnny and Lucy, but Meg condemned Craig's lack of fatherly instincts. Craig reminded Meg that she and Paul weren't perfect and stormed out.\n\n\nPaul called Emily to meet him at Java and said he needed her help. After hearing Paul's \"plan,\" she called Craig and asked him to meet her at Yo's. Craig was initially hostile to Emily but agreed to meet her after she told him he would be very interested in what she had to say.\n\n\nCraig met Emily, and she explained that she could help him find his children, Lucy and Johnny. Craig was excited and annoyed that Emily had news about his kids and wanted to know how she had gotten the information. She told him she'd heard Lucinda talking to Lucy and that if he followed Lucinda, he would be able to get information about where Lucy had taken Johnny.\n\n\nLater in the afternoon, Craig tracked Lucinda's limo through town, hoping to find out where his children had gone. Lucinda saw Craig following her and decided it was a good place to let him overhear a fake conversation with Lucy. It became clear that she, Paul, and Emily had set Craig up.\n\n\nWhen Lucinda got out of the car to talk to Lucy, Craig strained to hear their conversation. Lucinda explained to Lucy that with Dusty dead, the only living parent Johnny had left was Craig. She stressed to Lucy that it was more important than ever that she stay away from Oakdale and Craig. Lucinda made sure to mention that Lucy and Johnny were in Barbados. She got back into her limo, confident that she had fooled Craig. Craig immediately headed to the airport in search of his children.\n\n\nPaul arrived at Meg's office and shared with her the big news that he was the new owner of WorldWide. Meg was shocked that Lucinda had turned the company over to Paul, but he explained that Lucinda's recent brush with death had made her want to focus on her personal life. He told her that Lucinda was still on the board of directors for the company, but he was the CEO. Meg wished Paul good luck with the company, and he told her that she was always welcome at the company. He reminded her that she'd gotten involved with the business to make a difference in the world, but Meg thought Paul was just using his new job as a way to get her back.\n\n\nPaul assured Meg that he wanted her back but understood she was ready to move on, and he would focus on a business relationship with her if that was what she wanted. Meg didn't believe Paul wanted her around for her business skills, but he kept trying to persuade her to stay with the company. Meg turned down the offer and left Paul alone to stew in his disappointment.\n\n\nLucinda, Emily, and Paul met up at the Lakeview bar, and Lucinda revealed that she had succeeded in \"the plan\" by sending Craig off on a wild goose chase in search of Lucy and Johnny. She guaranteed that she could keep him on his search for a long time. Paul and Emily were excited at the prospect of getting Craig out of town and asked Lucinda to keep them posted about Craig's whereabouts. Paul thanked Emily for her help and asked her to let him know what he owed her. She told him she would get back to him and left him alone at the bar.\n\n\nPaul looked at the picture of him and Meg that he had taken out of her trash and thought back on the last time they'd made love. Emily returned, looking for something, and saw Paul looking at the picture. She told Paul to get over it because Meg would never forgive him, but Paul reminded her that nothing was impossible. At the farm, Meg went through her belongings from the office and also recalled her last night with Paul.\n\n\n",
