Margo was relieved that it wasn't Casey, because the victim was the same age as her son. Tom left to check on Casey, as Officer Malone informed Margo that the supposed overdose victim was attending Casey's 21st birthday party when he died. Margo knew nothing about any party for her son. \n\n\nCasey woke up on the couch next to Jade, and both of them were wearing only blankets. Someone knocked loudly on the door, so Casey scrambled into his pants just as Luke and Noah let themselves in. They were surprised to see Jade there, and it appeared Casey was, too. Noah said they had come to see Margo, but Casey explained his mother was out of town. Jade and Casey took some aspirin to quell their hangovers, as Luke asked if the two of them had done anything besides drink the night before. He said he and Noah had noticed some drug activity outside Yo's, and then they broke the news that Reg had died. \n\n\nThey thought they knew who had supplied Reg with the drugs, and Luke produced the bag of pills they had found in Reg's coat. They said they were there to turn over the evidence to Margo and to ask her to investigate. Luke was positive that Elwood was the culprit, but Noah was more conservative and reluctant to name anyone without proof. Casey said it might be difficult to prove that Elwood gave Reg the drugs, but he volunteered to help. He was still angry with Elwood for setting him up with the stolen manuscripts. Casey phoned Elwood and asked to meet him in the park for an \"urgent favor.\" Casey promised Luke and Noah that he would set everything in motion if his buddies would make sure the cops would arrive. \n\n\nMargo went to Memorial and approached Alison to ask about Casey's birthday party. Alison told her a group of Casey's friends put a party together at the last minute at Yo's. Alison knew that someone there had gotten sick, but she had no idea that it was Reg and that he had died. She remembered him as a good guy who had worked on Luke's campaign. Margo asked about Reg's drug habits, but Alison said she stayed away from people like that after her experience with crystal meth. \n\n\nShe overreacted and told Margo she and Casey were no longer seeing each other, so Margo did not have to lock her up in order to get rid of her. The two of them sparred until Matt showed up and surprised Margo, who did not know he had been released from prison early. He apologized for not checking in with her when he first returned to Oakdale, but said he was sticking around and had found employment. He said he had been working the night before at Yo's when the incident with Reg happened, and he added that he had already spoken to the police. Margo left, and Alison told Matt she had experienced a rough night. He invited her to go on a power walk with him in the park when she took a break. \n\n\nCraig visited Carly, and she showed him a design she had created for their new vodka. Craig admitted they had suffered a \"minor setback\" in their manufacturing plans; in fact, the Greek distributor had backed out completely and would not be investing in their \"Midnight Sun\" vodka. Carly flipped out and asked how that could have happened, but Craig had no clue. He said it was just business, and Carly should not take it personally. Craig said he had already set up a meeting with another distributor in New York City that very day. \n\n\nCarly protested that she could not just drop everything and go winging off to New York. She had children to arrange for and could not be away. Craig suggested she make those arrangements fast, because the deal was too big to let it slip away. He claimed they could fly to the meeting and be back before Sage was home from school, demanding her hot chocolate. Carly agreed to go only if he guaranteed they would be back in time and not have another fiasco like the day of Sage's play. Craig gave her the guarantee and also vouched for the new distributor, Harry Siegler, so the two of them left for their whirlwind trip. \n\n\nAfter their meeting, Craig told Carly she had been awesome and completely nailed the presentation. He proposed lunch, but Carly reminded him of his promise to get her home in time to greet Sage, but he promised that would be no problem. He said the lunch involved business. \n\n\nIn the park, Casey waited for Elwood, but Matt happened along first. Casey told him he was trying to put Elwood out of the drug business by setting a trap. Matt offered to stay and help, but Casey assured him he had everything covered. Elwood arrived, but he was suspicious that Casey might want to jump him again. Casey said he was having a rough patch since he had left school, and needed something to \"take off the edge.\" Elwood played dumb and asked if Luke and Noah had put Casey up to that, and then he turned to leave. Casey grabbed Elwood's backpack and slipped the bag of pills from Reg's coat inside, Elwood took off, so Matt came back to see if Casey's plan had worked. Alison also appeared, so Casey apologized for giving her a hard time at his party. Alison said she knew that Casey had taken Jade home and had sex with her. \n\n\nTom went home and was shocked to find the couch reconfigured and a bright red thong on one of his living room tables. He called Margo, and she offered to come right home. When she got there and saw the \"evidence,\" Margo reminded Tom that he was the one who wanted to leave Casey alone on his big birthday. Tom assumed the underwear came from Alison, but Margo said Casey and Alison were no longer a couple. When Tom learned that Reg had died at Casey's party, however, he was concerned and went to find his son. \n\n\nLuke and Jade had coffee, and he asked her why she had slept with Casey. He was not pleased with her response of, \"Why not?\" Luke lectured her about finding the right guy and reminded her that the point of the party was to get Casey and Alison back together. Jade said Casey had made it very clear that he was not interested in Alison any longer. Luke told her to grow up. \n\n\nCraig and Carly went to a restaurant that specialized in many kinds of vodka, and Craig described their tasting many samples as \"critical research.\" After the sampling, Carly declared the vodka business more fun than she had experienced in a long time, but she still insisted they leave to be able to greet Sage. She was a bit wobbly on her feet, however. \n\n\nAlison confided to Matt that she had seen Casey with Jade, but she felt she couldn't blame him, because she had been the one to call it quits. They walked back to the hospital, where Matt told her she deserved better than what she had. \n\n\nCasey went to Java to report to Jade, Luke, and Noah. He said he had slipped the pills into Elwood's backpack, and Noah said what Casey had done was strictly illegal, but Casey didn't care. Luke admitted they had seen no actual drugs in the alley, but the boys agreed to make a police report. They left to go see Margo, and Tom came in. Casey was surprised his parents were back, and Tom got right to the point. He asked his son what the hell he was doing with Jade Taylor, who was worse than Alison and Emily Stewart put together. Tom brought up Reg's death, and Casey said he would do whatever it took to make sure something like that never happened again. Tom handed Jade a bag that contained her bright red personal property. \n\n\nLuke and Noah found Margo at the police station and explained what they had seen in the alley. Margo asked some questions and then asked Officer Malone to bring in Elwood. Malone found him before Luke and Noah left, so they watched Margo interrogate the boy. She asked to examine his backpack, and Elwood agreed, so Margo went through it while Malone searched Elwood. Luke and Noah were dumbfounded that the police found nothing illegal. \n\n\nTom came in and Margo told him that her lead was a dead end. Tom said Casey's mystery woman was Jade, and Margo was not impressed. \n\n\nNoah and Luke went back to Java and told Casey and Jade that the cops found nothing on Elwood. Casey was disappointed and figured that Elwood had found the drugs and dumped them. Jade wanted to know what was next for the two of them, so Casey offered to pick up where they had left off. \n\n\nAlison was pleasantly surprised to find that Matt had prepared a picnic, featuring Mabel's red hots, in an empty room in the hospital, just for her. He said it was part of his plan to abolish her winter doldrums, and it seemed to work. \n\n\nCraig brought Carly home, but she was a bit woozy and allowed him to make the hot chocolate for Sage. Craig's cell phone rang, and he sounded discouraged, but it was a trick to fool Carly into thinking their new distributor had bailed on them, as well. He let her believe that for a moment before he told her Mr. Siegler had promised to back them 100 per cent and had already put a check in the mail. Carly jumped up with joy, so Craig grabbed her excitedly and gave her a big kiss. Carly was speechless, so Craig said that was a \"business kiss,\" as opposed to a handshake. He went back to his cocoa project, leaving a stunned Carly in the living room.\n\n\n",

Tom and Margo are not happy when they discover Casey slept with Jade while they were out of town. Tom tells Casey that Jade isn't the right girl for him and Casey tells Tom it is none of his business whom he dates. Casey is tired of everybody telling him he shouldn't date Jade so he tells Jade that they are going to pick up where they left off last night. Luke and Noah tell Casey that they think Elwood sold Reg the pills that caused his overdose and Casey calls Elwood to set up a meeting at the park. Casey tries to persuade Elwood to sell him pills but Elwood doesn't fall into the trap. Casey places the pills that Reg took in Elwood's backpack and later tells Luke and Noah to go to the police with their suspicions. Margo brings Elwood in for questioning after talking to Luke and Noah. Elwood denies selling the pills to Reg and when Margo searches the backpack she doesn't find anything. Noah tells Casey that Elwood was let go because Margo found no evidence. Casey guesses Elwood found the pills and took them out before he went to the police station.
