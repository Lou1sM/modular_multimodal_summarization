Bob appeared at the door, and Casey asked him to say something on tape about the wedding. Bob looked into the camera and said that he thought Alison and Casey made a perfect couple and would have a long and happy life together. When Casey asked Bob if he had been nervous the day he married Kim, Bob confirmed that he had indeed been nervous. \n\n\nCasey pointed out what a big commitment marriage was, with the intention of spending your life with one person and starting a family with them. Bob corrected Casey by saying he had never been nervous about that part, only about the wedding itself. Bob asked if Casey was having doubts, and Casey said, \"Absolutely.\" Casey turned off the camera and told his great-grandfather that although he had no doubts about his love for Alison, he did doubt his own ability to be the kind of man Alison deserved. Bob replied that the fact that Casey was concerned about that was a good sign.\n\n\nAt All Angels Church, Mick informed Alison that she was the only person who could stop him from hurting the people she cared about. He explained that he didn't want to hurt Paul and Emily, but James wanted him to, and even though James was dead, he felt that James was in his head. Mick said that whenever he tried to resist those thoughts, he developed headaches and nosebleeds. According to Mick, whenever James took over in Mick's mind, it was as though Mick actually was James.\n\n\nAlison pointed out that James was dead, and therefore, he couldn't hurt Mick any more. Mick said James had never hurt him, that James had loved him, and he had loved James. Mick explained that James had taken him in and given him a home; he said James had treated him like a son, and in return, James had asked Mick to go to Oakdale to destroy Paul and everyone Paul cared about, because Paul had betrayed James. Alison tried to tell Mick that it was the other way around, that James had consistently tried to destroy Paul, and she said that James couldn't force Mick to do anything. Mick replied that he wasn't being forced, because he felt that he owed it to James to carry out his plans.\n\n\nAlison said that if that were the case, and if it were true that Alison was the only person who could stop Mick, then that was what she would do. Mick, relieved, told Alison that it must have been destiny for them to meet, because he'd known from the minute he met Alison that she would help him. Alison said she regretted having helped him, because it had made her and her sister's lives miserable.\n\n\nAlison asked Mick to explain how he had become involved with James. Mick told her that he'd been a runaway, but no one had ever tried to find him. He had lived on the streets, and was stealing and foraging for food. One day, Mick had sought shelter in a cabin in the woods during a storm, only to find that James was already using the cabin as a hideaway. According to Mick, he and James hid out together in the cabin, and James treated Mick better than anyone else ever had, and eventually even thought of Mick as his son and told Mick that Mick respected him more than his real son, Paul, ever had. Mick said that he loved James, and James trusted him, to the point that if James needed anything done, all he had to do was tell Mick.\n\n\nEventually, Mick started wondering just how much he really owed James, based on the types of things James asked him to do. Mick said that James began to realize that Mick's heart wasn't in it as much as it had been, so James began having conversations with Mick that Mick couldn't remember afterward. Mick told Alison that James had a device that he would shine into Mick's eyes, and every time James used it, Mick would realize later that he was having thoughts that didn't seem to be his own. Mick told Alison that he hadn't fought it until he had met Alison, and that Alison made him want to be himself again.\n\n\nAlison told Mick he needed professional help to undo the psychological programming that James had done, but Mick said he didn't want to go to prison. Alison said that because Casey's mother was the chief of detectives, Margo could help keep Mick out of prison and get him the help he needed. Mick again said he couldn't go to prison, because then he would lose Alison. Alison told Mick that she wasn't his to lose, because she wanted to be with Casey. Mick told Alison that she was lying to herself, but she insisted she wasn't.\n\n\nPaul went to see his mother and demanded that she tell him where Mick was. Barbara said she didn't know, and then she noticed that Paul was holding a gun. Barbara told Paul that she couldn't let him shoot his father, but Paul yelled that Mick wasn't his father, that he was just somebody whom James had managed to brainwash. Barbara asked why Paul would want to shoot Mick, if that were the case, and Paul said it was the only way to stop him. Paul told Barbara that he would get rid of Mick for good.\n\n\nWhen Barbara told Paul she couldn't help him, he pointed the gun at her. She asked if he would really shoot her, and Paul asked whether Barbara remembered what Mick had done to Emily. He told his mother that if she took Mick's side against his, it would be the end of Paul's relationship with Barbara. Barbara reluctantly told Paul that Mick liked to go to the bell tower at All Angel's Church. Paul said that Barbara had better not be lying, and he left.\n\n\nPaul went to the church and began yelling for Mick to reveal himself. Alison and Mick heard Paul yelling, and Alison went downstairs to talk to him. She immediately noticed the gun Paul was carrying and asked him what he was doing with it, especially in a church. Paul told Alison not to worry about that and demanded to know if Mick was up in the bell tower. Alison lied and said that he wasn't there anymore. Alison told Paul that she had followed Mick to the church after his escape from the hospital. She said she had tried to talk Mick into turning himself in, but he was afraid of going to prison, so he had told Alison he was leaving town.\n\n\nPaul asked if Alison was okay, and she said she was a little spooked but otherwise fine. Paul told her to call her mom and her sister, because they were probably worried about her, and Alison said she would. He asked if Alison wanted him to give her a ride, but she said she had her car and needed to go to Casey's house, so Paul left.\n\n\nMick thanked Alison for lying for him. Alison said she didn't know what to do, because she couldn't hide Mick from Paul and she couldn't just walk away from Mick. Mick told Alison to leave town with him, because if he weren't in Oakdale, he would be free from the programming, since everyone James wanted him to hurt was in Oakdale. Alison reminded Mick that she was getting married the next day, but Mick said that Alison didn't really want to marry Casey. When Alison told him she loved Casey, Mick asked, \"Then why did you sleep with me?\" Alison replied that she'd been confused, but Mick told her he thought she'd been looking for a way out of her wedding.\n\n\nAlison told Mick that she couldn't listen to him anymore and that she never wanted to see him again. Mick grabbed her and kissed her. Alison broke away and ran from the church.\n\n\nAt the hospital, an orderly was holding Henry in a room, on Dr. Oliver's orders. Henry told the orderly that he didn't actually have tuberculosis and that the orderly should let him go, but the orderly ignored him. The phone in the room rang, and when the orderly answered it, he said it was for Henry. Henry picked up the phone and was surprised to hear Margo's voice. He told her he was being held against his will at the hospital, but when Margo asked if Mick Dante was holding Henry, Henry was surprised. Margo told Henry that Mick was claiming to be James Stenbeck and that he might be dangerous. Henry asked if Barbara knew about the situation, and he promised not to go anywhere near Mick. Henry began pleading with Margo again to help him get out of the hospital, but she hung up on him.\n\n\nHenry began coughing and approached the orderly. He reached up and took the orderly's mask off and coughed right in the orderly's face, which led the orderly to run out of the room in fear of catching tuberculosis. Henry took off and went straight to Barbara's suite at the Lakeview, still wearing just a hospital gown. Barbara let him in but asked why he had been in the hospital. When Henry said he'd been put in quarantine for tuberculosis, Barbara covered her mouth and told Henry to leave immediately. Henry explained what had actually happened and then told Barbara about Mick's claims to be James Stenbeck.\n\n\nBarbara told Henry she already knew about that, and that she believed that Mick was indeed James. Henry was shocked that Barbara would believe any such thing, given how young Mick was and the fact that James was dead. Barbara explained that Mick had been using a youth serum to make himself younger. She told Henry that James had returned to try to make things up to her and to Paul and Henry. Henry realized that Barbara had been letting Mick treat her because she believed that Mick's treatments would make her younger. Barbara said that was true, and she told Henry that she'd done it for herself and for him.\n\n\nHenry asked what Barbara meant, and she reminded him that when she and Henry had first become involved, they had been using each other. Barbara said that for her part, it had been exactly what she'd needed. She explained that even though she had beaten cancer, she had felt very vulnerable and old. Barbara said that despite Henry's faults, he was very alive, and he had made her feel that way, too. But Barbara had begun to see both Vienna and Katie as competition for Henry's attention, although Henry protested that he had never meant for Barbara to feel that way.\n\n\nHenry realized that Mick had then appeared with his fountain of youth treatments, and Barbara agreed that she had believed that Mick could not only make her feel younger but could actually make her younger. Henry told Barbara that Mick was a good con man who was only after Barbara's money. He told Barbara that she didn't need to be younger, because she was \"a very attractive, exciting woman who's also sexy as hell.\"\n\n\nHenry told Barbara he had to change clothes, and as he was about to leave, Barbara asked whether he was going to Alison and Casey's wedding the next day. Henry said he was, and Barbara asked if he'd like to accompany her. Henry told her that he would love to, except he had already agreed to go with Katie. Barbara told Henry that she would see him at the wedding if they still let her attend. Henry said the only reason they would have to not let Barbara be at the wedding would be if they were concerned that she would outshine the bride.\n\n\nHoping to find Emily and Paul, Susan went to Fairwinds. Emily told Susan that Paul had gone to buy a wedding gift for Alison. Susan let Emily know that Mick Dante had escaped from the hospital, and she told Emily that she wanted to be sure Emily and Alison were safe. Emily asked why Susan was worried about Alison, and Susan realized that Emily didn't know that Alison and Mick had slept together. When Susan passed that information along, Emily demanded to know how her mother could know such a thing. Susan told Emily that Alison herself had admitted it, although Alison had been at a loss to explain why she had done it.\n\n\nEmily said that things were worse than Susan knew, because Mick was claiming that he was James Stenbeck. Susan pointed out that James was both dead and much older than Mick, but Emily said Mick claimed that the drugs he'd been giving Emily and Barbara had also reversed his aging process and saved his life. Susan was stunned that Barbara believed such a thing, and she asked whether Emily believed it. Emily said she thought Mick was insane, but she had seen Paul take some hair from Mick's head and give it to an independent lab for analysis, and she had later seen the lab report that indicated the DNA from the hair was almost an exact match for James's DNA. Emily said regardless of the DNA test results, Mick was a dangerous man, and they needed to find Alison right away.\n\n\nEmily and Susan went to the Hughes's house, where they told Bob and Casey that they were looking for Alison. Casey said he had thought Alison was with Emily. Emily and Susan said that Alison was probably at the mall doing some last-minute shopping. Bob then suggested that while they were waiting for Alison, Casey could tape Emily and Susan for the wedding video. Emily and Susan looked doubtful but agreed to tape something together. When Casey turned on the camera, Emily said, \"Hi, Ali. We love you so much, and we want you to be safe and happy for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\nLater, Emily went back to Fairwinds. When Paul returned home, Emily saw his gun and asked what he was doing with it. Paul told Emily about finding Alison at the church and that Alison had said Mick had left town. Emily was glad to hear that, but Paul said he planned to track him down and get rid of him. Emily asked if Paul intended to spend the rest of his life in jail, but Paul said he couldn't be convicted of killing someone who was already dead, and if Mick's DNA proved that Mick was James Stenbeck, then that's what Paul would be doing. Emily blocked Paul's attempt to leave and told him that if he left, she wouldn't be there when he returned.\n\n\nEmily reminded Paul that he had worked very hard to not be like his father, but he was reacting exactly the way his father would want him to react. Paul said that he didn't have a choice, but Emily said he always had a choice. Emily told Paul that they could stand together united and be strong and reject what James wanted Paul to do. She asked Paul to believe in her and in their marriage and to give her the gun. He did, and she put it back in the safe.\n\n\nAlison arrived at the Hughes's house, and Casey asked her where she'd been and why she hadn't answered his calls. She told him she'd been shopping and that her phone battery had died. Casey replied that once they were married, Alison wouldn't be able to ignore his calls. Alison said that went both ways, so Casey joked about getting phones that would keep them in constant touch. They kissed, and Mick appeared outside on the patio. \n\n\nAs Mick watched Casey and Alison, his nose began to bleed. Mick angrily turned and knocked over a patio chair before running away. Casey and Alison heard the noise outside, but when they went to investigate, they didn't see anyone. Alison told Casey she should leave and said that she couldn't wait for their wedding the next day.\n\n\nMick returned to the bell tower, where he had an argument with himself as James. \"James\" told Mick that Paul, Henry, and Barbara had rejoiced at James's death and that they deserved what Mick was going to do to them. Mick told \"James\" that he couldn't ruin Alison's wedding to Casey, but \"James\" told Mick that Alison didn't care about Mick and was just like the rest of them. \n\n\n\"James\" said that Mick needed to take care of all of them while they were all together at the wedding and make them suffer. Mick said he didn't want to hurt them, because they'd been good to him, but \"James\" said he was the only person who'd been good to Mick. \"James\" told Mick that he was James Stenbeck; Mick kept insisting that he was Mick Dante, but eventually, when \"James\" asked again, \"Who are you?\" Mick responded, \"I'm James Stenbeck.\" \n\n\n",
