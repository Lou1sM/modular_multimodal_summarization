Nick is an untidy housemate, and Katie is tired of it.  Mike, however, feels Katie is safer with Nick in the house, especially since he will be leaving soon to help out his brother Mark.

    "tvmega_recap": "Jack wants to know what is going on between Nick and Carly when he finds them together when Carly says she was going to be home alone? Jack and Carly argue about her lying. His trust has been broken, but Carly thinks Jack is simply mad because Nick brought her home. She covers by trying to explain she felt obligated to look for Will and Gwen and didn't want to involve him because he is a cop. Either way, Jack leaves angrily and Carly decides going undercover at the strip club isn't worth her marriage. Katie is worried if Mike leaves, their wedding will go up in smoke. He promises that they will be fine. She needs to stay in Oakdale and plan their wedding so when he gets home they can tie the knot. Mike is glad Nick is going to stay at the cottage for a while longer to look after Katie when he is gone. Katie continues to notice Nick's subtle comments about Carly. When he looks longingly at the handkerchief he wiped Carly's lipstick on, we have to ask what kind of feelings does he have for her? Lucinda meets Jade, and is skeptical. She thinks her accident with Luke might have been too coincidental. She pleads with Holden to get a DNA test. Jade asks Lily a personal question \u0096 is she pregnant? Meg arrives back in Oakdale expecting a message from Paul (thanks to Henry's phony message), and is surprised to hear there is no message. Paul disguises himself as the French man as he eavesdrops on Jen's conversation with Madame Lacoste, who now changes her tune, and tells a shocked Jen she thinks Paul is in fact alive. A disguised Paul comes face to face with Jen, who doesn't recognize him. He later slips Meg a matchbook with a message on it and she realizes who the strange man was.",
