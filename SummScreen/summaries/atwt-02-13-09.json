Craig said he was sure the deal with Mr. Siegler was going to work out, but to ensure that things went their way, Craig wanted Carly to do some more drawings of the vodka bottle. When Carly mentioned her hangover, Craig said he had to admit that he liked her better after she'd had a few drinks, because she was friendlier to him then. Carly asked what Craig meant, but then she remembered that they had kissed. Horrified, Carly quickly told Craig goodbye and hung up the phone. \n\n\nCarly called Lily and said she had a business proposition for Lily that she wanted to discuss in person. When Lily arrived at the Lakeview restaurant, she took one look at Carly and remarked that someone had obviously had a good time the night before. Carly said that it had been business, and that it was the subject of their meeting. She then explained to Lily the idea behind \"Midnight Sun,\" although she was careful not to mention Craig's involvement. In fact, Carly lied when Lily asked if Carly had come up with the idea by herself. \n\n\nLily was intrigued by Carly's idea and by the drawings Carly had already made for the bottle's logo. Lily told Carly she thought the idea had great potential, but Lily wanted to go home and run the numbers and think things over before committing to becoming involved as an investor with Carly. Carly understood, but asked Lily to let her know as soon as possible if she was interested. \n\n\nLily walked into the lobby and ran into Craig. Craig noticed that Lily had one of Carly's drawings for the vodka logo. Lily told Craig that Carly had explained the business idea to her. Craig asked Lily for her opinion of the venture, and Lily told him she thought it was a great idea. Craig wondered why Carly had been discussing the idea with Lily, and Lily said Carly needed a partner. Craig was surprised, but he didn't tell Lily about his own involvement with Carly and the vodka business. \n\n\nAt home, Carly tried to reach Mr. Siegler. He was unavailable, but Carly left a message saying Craig Montgomery would no longer be involved in their business transaction. As she hung up, Craig rang her doorbell. He told her he had come to check on her progress with the drawings. Craig told Carly he had run into Lily at the Lakeview, and that Lily had one of Carly's drawings. Carly tried to cover, but Craig knew she was lying. He was angry that Carly had tried to take credit for his idea. He reminded her that he had been the one to find a distributor and get their product ready to launch quickly, yet Carly had repaid him by going behind his back and trying to squeeze him out of the deal. \n\n\nLily went home and told Holden about Carly's business proposition. Holden was surprised Lily would even consider becoming partners with Carly, given that he and Carly had an affair. Lily agreed, but she was excited about the business idea. After Holden reminded Lily that she hadn't wanted to loan Carly any money because it would have been a way of inviting Carly back into their lives, Lily realized that a business venture with Carly would be an even worse idea. \n\n\nCraig told Carly he thought Carly's machinations had all been because he had kissed her the night before. Carly denied it, but Craig insisted that Carly was worried about a possible romantic entanglement. He then assured Carly that what she had done behind his back had killed any desire he might have had for her. Craig grabbed Carly's drawings and ripped them in half. He said since the project was his idea, he would replace Carly, not the other way around. At that moment, Lily called Carly to let Carly know that they couldn't be business partners. Carly tried to cover by sounding enthusiastic and saying she couldn't talk because she had company. Craig realized when Carly hung up that it had been Lily on the phone, and he correctly guessed that Lily had turned Carly down. Craig seemed delighted to find that he had Carly right where he wanted her. He told Carly he would have to review his options, and he left. \n\n\nBarbara went to see Paul at the police station. She told him that her lawyers had looked at the case against Paul, and they thought there were several holes in it, as well as the good possibility of an insanity defense. Paul told his mother that he didn't need lawyers, because he intended to plead guilty. Paul cracked jokes about there being little difference between prison and a mental institution as far as he was concerned, but Barbara tried to get him to focus on being able to be there for his baby daughter. \n\n\nAs Barbara and Paul talked, Josie walked in and announced that she had come to tell the police what really happened. Paul told Josie she should leave, but Josie told Paul his chances were much better if she stayed. Barbara asked what Josie meant, since Josie had been Paul's victim. Josie told her that wasn't entirely true. Paul told Barbara to put Josie on a bus out of town. \n\n\nWhen Josie heard that Paul planned to plead guilty, she told him he couldn't do that. Josie said Eliza didn't need to grow up with a father who was in prison. Paul said he was tired of defending himself, but Josie said Paul just enjoyed being the victim, with a mean daddy, a mean wife, and the mean wife's mean friend. Josie suggested that Paul grow up first if he planned on being any kind of father to Eliza, and she walked out. \n\n\nPaul told Barbara that it wasn't up to Barbara or Josie to get him out of trouble. Paul said no matter how much Barbara or anyone else wanted him to change, he would always be the way he was, and the best thing for everyone to do would be to stay away from him. \n\n\nMeg took Eliza to the hospital to be examined after the kidnapping. There, Meg ran into Dusty. Dusty offered to follow Meg and the baby home, but Meg pointed out it was only a five-minute drive. Dusty said he didn't want to intrude, but Meg told him that after all he'd done to help her get Eliza back, he was welcome to check up on them any time he wanted to. \n\n\nHolden arrived at the farm and found Dusty waiting in the kitchen for Meg. Dusty explained that Meg had just returned from having Eliza examined at the hospital, and he told Holden that the baby was fine. Meg came downstairs and said Eliza had gone right to sleep. Holden took the opportunity to apologize to Dusty for the things he'd said to Dusty while Eliza was missing. Holden thanked Dusty for Dusty's role in bringing everyone safely back to Oakdale. Holden offered his hand, and Dusty shook it. Holden then excused himself, saying he had chores to do; Dusty jokingly asked if Holden needed a hand, but Holden declined. \n\n\nMeg told Dusty she thought Holden had been sincere in his apology, but Dusty said it hadn't been necessary. Meg said she owed Dusty an apology, too. Dusty told Meg she had nothing to apologize for; he admitted that marrying Meg had made things worse with Paul. Dusty said he had made it easy for Paul to get carried away, but Meg said Paul would have done something crazy regardless of what Dusty had done, and she was glad Paul was locked up. \n\n\nMeg went upstairs to check on Eliza, and while she was out of the room, Josie showed up, looking for Meg. When Meg came back downstairs, she asked Josie what she was doing there. Dusty quickly said Josie was there to thank Meg for not pressing charges against her. Josie agreed but said she had also come to tell Meg that she was going to testify on Paul's behalf. Josie wanted to let Meg know that Paul was in despair and was completely giving up on his own defense, so Josie intended to try to help him. \n\n\nJosie told Meg that she knew that Meg had once cared about Paul. Josie thought Meg could make an appeal for leniency. Dusty asked why Meg would want Paul back out on the streets. Josie said she knew that Dusty had faked his own death and had let someone be falsely accused of his murder, and that Meg had married a man she didn't love just to help him try to get custody of his child. Josie wasn't sure what made Dusty and Meg think they were so much better than Paul. Josie told Meg that Paul needed Meg, and Eliza needed Paul. \n\n\nJosie walked out. Meg told Dusty she had to see for herself what kind of shape Paul was in. Despite Dusty's objections, Meg left. Josie again approached Dusty, saying she wanted to make sure Dusty didn't hate her. Dusty said he didn't hate Josie, but he didn't trust her, either. Dusty said what he felt for Josie had been built on a lie, so he thought it would be best if they let it go. He told Josie that one day, she would realize he had been right about them, and Josie replied that Dusty was always right. \n\n\nMeg arrived at the police station, where Barbara was surprised to see her. Barbara told Meg that Paul needed Meg's help, but Barbara didn't want Meg to visit Paul if all she was going to do was disappoint him again. Meg said she just wanted to talk to Paul. \n\n\nMeg went into the interrogation room, and Paul told her he was happy to see her. Meg told Paul she still hated him, and she couldn't believe anyone who actually loved her would have made her suffer the way Paul had. Paul said he was sorry. Meg told Paul that Barbara and Josie both wanted her to help him, but Paul said he didn't want that. Paul said he had decided he belonged in jail. Meg said the only problem with that was that it might not be good for Eliza to have a father who was in jail; on the other hand, it might be the best thing. Paul said that was up to Meg, but Meg asked Paul to give her one good reason why she shouldn't want Paul out of her and Eliza's life for good. Paul apologized again for the pain he'd caused Meg, and Meg said she needed to think about whether Eliza needed a father in her life. Meg left and returned to the farm, where she told Dusty she was afraid that Eliza would grow up hating her if she helped put Eliza's father in prison. \n\n\nWhen Paul was brought out of the interrogation room, he saw Josie again. Josie said Barbara had indicated that Meg might help Paul. Paul asked if Josie had talked to Meg. Josie admitted it, saying she thought Meg had a right to know what was going on. Paul told Josie that she had done her good deed for the year and could leave. When Josie said she was staying, Paul asked if Josie thought she still had a shot with Dusty. Josie explained that Dusty had made it quite clear she didn't have a chance with him. Paul asked what Josie was staying for, and Josie replied simply, \"You.\"\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Carly has a whopping hangover and stumbles to the kitchen for some aspirin and water. The phone rings and it is Craig. Her head is pounding and she hates his chipper, cheerful sound. Barbara tells Paul she wants him to stay calm and not panic. She's got her lawyer working on his case and he can say he was not responsible for his actions. The treatment can keep him out of jail, but he must help himself. Josie shows up and Paul objects. He wants to handle this alone. He doesn't care now what happens to him, and Josie and Barbara shouldn't either. Josie huffs out that if he wants to be a father, he should grow up first. Paul tells Barbara that he loves her, but she has done all she can and now she needs to stop. He will not change and they all need to stay as far away from him as they can. Dusty shows up at the hospital to be with Meg as he knew she would be taking Eliza there for a checkup. She smiles that after all he has done, he can check up on them all he wants. Dusty takes Meg home. Holden disapproves, but he does shake his hand for making things happen. Eliza is home and well and that is all that matters. Dusty warms a bottle of milk while Meg goes upstairs to the baby. Josie drops by and tells Meg that she wants to thank her for not pressing charges. Josie fills them in that Paul no longer cares what happens .he needs help. Dusty asks Meg not to fall for this Paul in despair routine. When she leaves, Josie returns to make sure Dusty doesn't hate her. He says he doesn't. He just doesn't trust her. It's better for both of them if they just let their relationship go; it was based on a lie from the beginning. Carly calls Lily; meets her and lays out her plans for Midnight Sun and asks her to consider investing her money to the project. Lily thinks this has great potential, but she's not sure about them being partners. She needs more time and will get back with her. When leaving, Lily runs into Craig and she lets slip that Carly asked her to be her partner. Going along, Craig says Carly is always full of surprises. Craig then shows up at Carly's and wants to see what progress she has made on her designs .the ones she gave Lily. Carly tries to wiggle out, but Craig is too sly and tells her she has stabbed him in the back when it was his idea and she is now acing him out. That's beyond low. He admits he had an attraction for her and despite her denial he knows she had one for him too, but whatever they had is dead now. He tears up the paperwork and tells her that she can not replace him. He will replace her. Lily calls and says while it sounds like a terrific idea, they would be asking for trouble and should not be partners. Craig gloats and says he realizes now that he has Miss Tenney exactly where he wants her. Meg shows up to see Paul, and Barbara warns her not to hurt Paul again, don't build up hope. He's surprised, but she tells him that she still hates him. That has not changed, so don't dare make her feel sorry for him. She doesn't want her baby's father in jail though. He needs to give her one good reason why he should not be in jail the rest of her life. She isn't sure that Eliza needs him that badly in her life. Paul asks Josie if Dusty is not interested, why is she staying in Oakdale? She tells him it is for him. Carly tells Craig that he inspires her to work harder and better. She just got nervous with this huge undertaking. So if he can just cut the personal business of trying to get her in bed, then they can work good together. He assures her that is not what he is trying to do, maybe in a drinking mood but not in a sober one. So he will have to consider his other options. He leaves with Carly still nursing her hangover.",
