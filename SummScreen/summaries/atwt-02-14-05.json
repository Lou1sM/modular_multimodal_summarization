As Katie gets dressed in the locker room, Jennifer tries to draw Mike's feelings out about Katie getting married but Mike shuts her down and tells her he doesn't want to talk about it. Meanwhile, Henry worries that Mike might declare his love for Katie and stop the wedding. Even though he knew it was a possibility, he isn't prepared for it to happen. Privately, Margo asks Katie if she's sure about marrying Henry and Katie insists she loves Henry. With minutes to spare before the ceremony is to begin, Henry tells Mike he'd gladly step aside for someone Katie loves more than him. Mike then goes to see Katie in the locker room and questions whether she can live a life without passion. Katie responds that she's had passion and it didn't work. She's ready to give it a go with a man who loves her unconditionally and will never leave her. When Mike doesn't say anything to stop her, Katie bids him goodbye. The wedding then begins and the minister asks if anyone objects. \n\n\nAll eyes are on Emily as she freezes when asked if she remembers who drugged her. She runs from the interrogation room, leaving Barbara to wonder if Rosanna's hypnosis of Emily worked. Rosanna insists she did her best and admits she feels terrible about what she's doing to Emily but Barbara reminds her she's doing it all to get back her son. When Emily makes clear it wasn't Barbara who drugged her, Paul accuses his mother of threatening Emily but Barbara tells him to finally accept that she's innocent. Later, Rosanna hurries home and gets a call from James warning her not to let her emotions get in her way. Emily then shows up, locks eyes with Rosanna and says she knows it was Rosanna who drugged her.\n\n\nOn a business trip, Dusty and Sierra tour a spa that they are interested in buying. Dusty balks at taking a mud bath but playful Sierra teases him into it. Later, to Dusty and Sierra's chagrin, the spa's owners inform the World Wide team that they're not interested in selling to a huge, impersonal corporation. However, Sierra jumps in to salvage the deal by claiming she and Dusty are married and that their business is indeed a family owned and operated one.  \n\n\n",
