Just as the two were set to stumble on Gwen and Maddie, a call from Margo interrupted them.

Bob immediately questioned Meg about the diary that Sarah had supposedly written telling how she'd wanted to die.\n\n\nMeg thought back on Craig's involvement in faking and planting the diary, but Meg said the diary wasn't relevant, but what was significant was Meg's failure to write down all the allergies.
