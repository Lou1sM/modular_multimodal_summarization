Henry was relieved when there were no objections and the wedding proceeded.  However, Katie refused to say the vows he chose (lyrics from a Barry Manilow song) and replaced them with her own heartfelt words about her \"soul mate.\"  When they are pronounced man and wife, Henry cries \"Thank you Bubbles!  You've made me the happiest man alive!\"  But if Henry is the happiest, Mike is the unhappiest -- misery is written all over his face.  He runs from the room after the ceremony and Jennifer follows him into the locker room just in time to see him slam a fist into a locker.  He tells Jennifer he is okay, but she knows differently.  Her day improves greatly, however, when Craig whisks her off to a country western bar for a meeting with Scott Reeves, a singer she wants to hire for her Street Jeans campaign.  Scott is flattered but not interested in advertising.  Craig, knowing Jennifer is a fabulous pool player, challenges him to a game.  Scott takes the challenge thinking Jennifer doesn't look the type of woman who can play pool.  But he is wrong!  When Craig and Jennifer win the game, Scott agrees to help with the campaign.  When they return to the wedding, they find the party is over.  Jennifer also finds Mike in tears.\n\n\nSierra and Dusty are about to lose their chance to buy the spa when its free-spirited owners find out she represents WorldWide, a corporate-capitalist interest.  But when they recognize her as Sierra Esteban of Montega, they are thrilled to meet their hero and tell her how much they admire what she did for the country.  The couple agrees to the sale and they treat Dusty and Sierra to champagne to toast their success!\n\n\nEmily simply cannot bring herself to tell Tom Hughes that she remembers it was Rosanna who drugged her instead of Barbara.  She later goes to Rosanna and confronts her about her memory -- but Rosanna denies the accusation.  Paul comes home and is furious with Emily, who tries to defend herself.  She leaves in exhaustion and confusion.  Paul and Rosanna enjoy their first Valentine's Day together, but Paul cannot forget his anger.  Rosanna begs him to forget it for just the evening, and he agrees.\n\n\nWhen Emily finds her mother, they try to figure out what drug she was given.  Susan tries to help, but Emily is tired and confused.  Hal is glad to find them -- he's been looking for Emily.  He asks her to come home with him that evening so that he can take care of her.  A very tired, but very happy, Emily agrees to join him.  \n\n\n",
