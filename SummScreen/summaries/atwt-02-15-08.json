She wanted Chris to say that she'd had postpartum depression and had been incapable of making a rational decision to give up her baby for adoption. Chris reminded Sofie that he was Will's cousin, but Sofie said Hallie was the only family she had. Chris agreed to testify, and Sofie's lawyer, David Graham, took Chris aside to discuss the case with him.\n\n\nWill and Gwen went to the courthouse. There, they ran into Sofie. Sofie told them she'd get her baby back and that Hallie was young enough that Sofie would be the only mother she remembered.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Brad was hungover from the previous night's escapades. He told Katie he couldn't believe she hadn't rescued him when he had been about to be arrested, but Katie told him they were no longer anything but coworkers. Brad tried to convince Katie to join him for breakfast but realized he didn't have his wallet. Bonnie walked up, holding up Brad's wallet and his Valentine-themed boxer shorts. Bonnie assured Katie it was not what it looked like and told Brad that the police had given them to her after they'd found the items the night before.\n\n\nBrad began flirting with Bonnie and told her he'd like to accompany her to the courthouse and watch her in action. Bonnie told Brad the case she had was a closed hearing about an adoption issue, but Brad said he'd go anyway and just wait for her to finish. They left together, and after arriving at the courthouse, Bonnie told Brad she assumed he'd accomplished his goal of making Katie jealous.\n\n\nBonnie found Will and Gwen and assured them they had a good case against Sofie. Barbara walked up, and Will asked her to leave, but Gwen informed him that she'd invited Barbara to attend the hearing, to help present a family image to the judge. They entered the courtroom together and were shocked when the first person Sofie's lawyer called to the witness stand was Chris. Chris talked about postpartum depression and how it might have affected Sofie's mental state and decision-making ability.\n\n\nSofie's lawyer then told the judge that Sofie's ex-boyfriend, who happened to be Gwen Munson's brother, and his mother, who was also Gwen's mother, had tried to pressure Sofie into giving up their baby for adoption. The lawyer mentioned that Barbara was also involved, and Barbara had to take the stand. Barbara admitted that Iris and Cole had told her that Sofie had wanted to place the baby for adoption, but when the lawyer asked whether Barbara had paid them money for the adoption, she denied it. Sofie stood and accused her of lying.\n\n\nWill then spoke up, saying that after he and Gwen had found out about what Cole and Iris had done, they'd tried to help Sofie have the baby and keep the baby herself. Bonnie said that she had been present when the adoption papers had been given to Sofie and that she had personally explained them to Sofie. Chris stated that Sofie had been \"under duress\" when she'd signed the adoption papers, and Will asked, \"How could you say that?\" The judge, sensing the tension in the courtroom, declared a short recess.\n\n\nWill told Chris that he would never forget Chris's betrayal. Chris said he was sorry Will felt that way. He wished Will and Gwen good luck and left.\n\n\nWhen the judge reconvened the hearing, Bonnie said that her clients had acted in good faith when they'd entered into the adoption. She said that Sofie had no direction in life and pointed out that Sofie had \"recklessly endangered Hallie's life.\" When Mr. Graham said Bonnie had represented both sides in the adoption issue, Bonnie insisted she'd explained the adoption paperwork to Sofie thoroughly. She reminded Sofie that she had reviewed the terms of the adoption with her carefully and pointed out that Sofie had had a certain number of days to change her mind. Bonnie told the judge that the day after that time period had expired, Sofie had kidnapped Hallie.\n\n\nMr. Graham gave his closing arguments, and Bonnie then asked the judge for the right to present more testimony later. The judge told her she had until the close of business. Will and Gwen asked Bonnie why she'd requested more time, and she told them she didn't want the judge to make his decision yet. Bonnie said they needed to find someone who could testify to Sofie's state of mind and her determination to give her baby away. Will said Aaron could do that, and Bonnie told him to ask Aaron to testify for them.\n\n\nCarly, Jack, and Parker were all dressed nicely for an appearance at the Oakdale Police Station, where Parker was to be interviewed by a court-appointed psychiatrist. When they arrived, Tom accompanied Parker to the interview with the psychiatrist. The doctor questioned Parker about his feelings regarding Sam. Parker freely admitted that he hadn't liked Sam and had been afraid Sam would do something to hurt his mother.\n\n\nThe psychiatrist said Parker couldn't have known his mother was in danger when he'd gotten the gun and gone to Metro. Parker responded, \"I did know! I knew all along that Sam was after my mom! That's why I brought the gun, because I couldn't let that happen!\" The doctor pointed out that it meant Parker's actions had been premeditated.\n\n\nKatie went to the police station, looking for Margo, and instead saw Jack and Carly. Jack told her about Parker's predicament. Katie asked Jack if Brad knew what had happened, and when Jack said no, Katie offered to fill him in. Katie was confused about how it could have happened, saying it obviously couldn't be Parker's fault. Carly assumed Katie meant it had to somehow have been Carly's fault, and Carly said Katie had no idea what had happened.\n\n\nCarly yelled at Katie to leave and stay away from her family. When Katie lingered, Carly shouted, \"What's the problem, Katie? Can't tear yourself away from Jack?\" Parker walked out of the interrogation room and asked his mom what was wrong, saying they had been able to hear her shouting. Carly reassured him that it had nothing to do with him, and Parker went back into the interrogation room after exchanging hellos with Katie.\n\n\nBack in the psychiatric interview, the doctor asked Parker if he had \"issues\" with his mother. Parker admitted that Carly sometimes did things that made him mad, and the doctor asked if Parker got angry enough to kill someone. Parker said that when he'd gotten to the club and seen Sam hurting his mother, he'd had to stop Sam -- and he would kill Sam again if he had the chance.\n\n\nKatie left, and Jack told Carly she needed to calm down for Parker's sake. Carly apologized, but Jack told her it was not her fault and that they couldn't make it about them. Meanwhile, Katie went to the courthouse and found Brad. She told him what was happening with Parker, and he left for the police station to check on things. When Brad found Jack and Carly, he told them how sorry he was and offered his support. He left. He found Katie waiting for him, and they returned to WOAK.\n\n\nParker and Tom exited the interview room, and Parker told his parents that it had gone badly in there. Tom told Jack and Carly that it wasn't as bad as Parker had made it sound, but they could all use some really good luck. Parker, Jack, and Carly returned home. They sat down to eat lunch, and Jack said he thought it would be a good time to pray. Jack gave thanks for his family, because they could be counted on in times of need, and he asked God to watch over them. Carly added her own prayer, \"Protect this family.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brad uses Bonnie to make Katie jealous and his plan works. Will and Gwen go to a preliminary hearing to determine if the custody case should go to trial. Chris testifies that Sofie was suffering from post partum depression. Bonnie tells Will and Gwen that Chris's testimony hurt their case so Will suggests that if they can testify to Sofie's state of mind, it could help their case. Parker goes to talk to the court-appointed psychologist and tells him that he killed Sam to keep him from hurting Carly, and he would do it again if he had the chance. Carly gets angry when she sees Katie comforting Jack and yells at her to leave her family alone. Parker gets upset and the psychologist notices and thinks that Parker is really affected by his mother's actions. Carly and Jack worry about what could happen to Parker.",
