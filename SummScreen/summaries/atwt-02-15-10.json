Mick Dante was on the loose, but Tom suggested Margo not tell Casey because their son would be anxious enough, and he needed to concentrate on his wedding.  Casey joined them, as Margo set up the camera and took photos.  Casey said that he hoped he could make his marriage to Alison as successful as his parents had made theirs.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Barbara appeared as Paul was also getting dressed.  He berated his mother for still insisting that Mick Dante was his father, and he urged her to concentrate on the impending wedding.  Barbara kept insisting that Mick was really James Stenbeck, and finally Paul told her that the wedding was really important to Emily, and he asked his mother not to attend.\n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Kim urged Bob to hurry up for fear they would be late to their grandson's wedding.  Dr. Reid Oliver walked up and made a crack about Bob's mental health by asking how advanced his dementia was for assigning a patient to him who needed \"compassion and reassurance.\"  Kim lit into Dr. Oliver, as Bob brought up Oliver's putting a healthy Henry in quarantine simply because Henry had annoyed him.\n\n\nBob reminded Oliver that Oliver had agreed to conform to Memorial's standards when Bob had given him temporary privileges there, but Dr. Oliver whined that he hadn't had a choice because \"the rich kid wanted him to take care of his boyfriend.\"  Dr. Bob decided that Dr. Oliver was just the physician to take care of a particularly nasty cyst in room 406, and he and Kim left for the church.\n\n\nHenry went to pick up Katie for the nuptials, and he told her that he had jumped out of a window at Memorial in his hospital gown in order to escape.  Katie giggled, but then she demanded to know what Henry had done to irritate Dr. Oliver.  Henry admitted that he had hired a private investigator in Dallas to poke around the good doctor's background.  Henry claimed he was only trying to protect Katie, but she crossly reminded him that she didn't need looking after.  Katie was really aggravated, and she refused to go to the wedding with Henry.\n\n\nWhen Henry argued with Katie, she threw him out of her house.  He went back to the Lakeview and knocked on Barbara's door.  She was in her dressing gown and told Henry that Paul had forbidden her to attend the wedding.  Henry said that he wanted her there, and he persuaded her to go with him to prove to people that she had nothing to be ashamed of.  Barbara got dressed in four and a half minutes, and she knocked Henry's socks off when she emerged.  He appeared quite smitten, and the two of them flirted before they left for the church.\n\n\nEmily picked up Alison's dress at Fashions, and Paul surprised her as she was in Old Town.  Emily said that Alison had wanted a little \"alone\" time before the wedding, so she had picked up the dress for her sister.  Paul told Emily how much he loved her, and they kissed.  Then Emily sent Paul to check on the reception plans, and she headed to All Angels Church.\n\n\nAt the empty church, Alison walked around the sanctuary and looked at the programs.  Mick entered through the door to the bell tower, and he said that he wanted to congratulate Alison.  She thought Mick had left town the night before, but he said there had been a \"change of plans.\"  He announced that Mick was no longer there, and he pulled out a gun.  He addressed Alison as \"Miss Stewart,\" and she realized that she was talking to James Stenbeck, who mentioned that he had \"a few scores to settle.\"\n\n\nFirst, Mick said that he was taking control of Alison's wedding, but she begged him not to do that.  She called him \"James,\" and she asked him to go up to the bell tower and promised to meet him there.  He agreed, but he warned her not to even think about double-crossing him.\n\n\nEmily arrived at the church, and Alison told her that Mick was there, and he had a pistol.  Emily immediately called Margo, and she said that Mick Dante was in the church with a gun.  Margo asked a few questions, and then she ordered the two women to \"find a safe place\" and lock themselves in.  Instead, Alison went to the bell tower where she continued to talk to Mick as himself.  She promised to go away with him, and she protested that she didn't really love Casey.  She thought that would break James's hold on Mick, and she kissed him.\n\n\nMick pushed Alison away and screamed that she was lying.  Margo walked in the door, and several policemen with guns drawn followed.  Mick dropped his gun as the officers handcuffed him.  He warned Alison that he was never going to forget how she had sold him out.\n\n\nEmily ran down the steps of the church to embrace Paul, who wanted to kill Mick Dante.  Margo led the procession down the stairs, as Casey ran to Alison.  She assured him that Mick had not hurt her, and Paul walked in.  Mick looked at Paul and said, \"Hello, son.\"  Paul was outraged, and claimed to have been looking for Mick to kill him, but Alison continued to defend Mick by saying the man \"only needed some help.\"  Casey was worried about Alison, and he suggested that they postpone the wedding, but Alison would not hear of it.  She asked only for a minute in which to put on her dress.\n\n\nThe police took Mick away, as Margo opted to stay for the ceremony.  The police car pulled away, and Mick introduced himself to the officer driving as \"James Stenbeck.\"  Inside the church, Emily took Alison and their mother into the bride's room to help her dress.  Alison looked beautiful in her wedding gown, and she declared it was the happiest day of her life.  In the church, Lisa told Bob and Kim that she had heard that the police had just made an arrest at the church, but she knew none of the details.  Kim, always the newswoman, got out her phone to call WOAK, but Bob reminded her that they were at a special wedding, and business could wait.\n\n\nWhen Dr. Oliver finished his shift, he returned to Katie's.  He found her dressed for the wedding, sitting glumly on the couch, and inhaling a tub of ice cream.  Reid took one look at Katie and announced that they were going to the wedding.  He said he needed to \"suck up to Dr. Hughes\" so that he would not have to deal with nasty cysts any longer.  Katie agreed, and the two left for the church as soon as Reid had gotten dressed.\n\n\nKatie and Reid ran into Bob and Kim in the foyer of the church, and they exchanged almost pleasant remarks.  Then they ran into Henry and Barbara, and both Henry and Katie were startled.  Reid asked Henry how his \"recovery\" was going, and Henry gave the doctor one of his killer looks.\n\n\nTom and Casey took their places in front of the altar, and the organ music began.  Alison appeared and began walking down the aisle alone.  She reached the front and turned to Casey, who began his vows, straight from his heart.  He praised her for her honesty and for never lying or \"playing games\" with him.  Alison began to speak, and she told Casey how understanding and forgiving he was, and she promised to make him happy for the rest of his life.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the car with Mick Dante in the back seat, drove through some rural areas.  All of a sudden, Mick screamed that his head felt as if it were going to explode, so the officer pulled over and got out.  He drew his gun and opened rear door.  Mick grabbed him around the neck with his cuffed arms and put him in a strangle hold until the officer was unconscious.  Mick rummaged for the keys to the cuffs in the officer's pocket and was able to get free.  Then he picked up the cop's gun and took off on foot.\n\n\nSitting in a pew in the church, Margo received a text message on her phone that caused her to jump up and whisper to Tom and dash out of the church.  Tom looked puzzled, as Paul and Emily stood to read from Shakespeare's sonnet, \"True Love.\"  Paul read the first two lines when suddenly a shot rang out, and Paul slumped to the floor.  Mick Dante walked into the sanctuary and finished reciting the stanza.  He finished by shouting, \"God, I like Shakespeare!\" as Paul writhed in pain.\n\n\nEmily screamed that Paul was bleeding, as she, Susan Stewart, Bob Hughes, and Reid Oliver all rushed to the front of the church.  Reid found a bullet hole in Paul's thigh, and he made a tourniquet with his tie.  Barbara ran to Mick and told him that he had shot their son, and Mick proudly proclaimed, \"I know.\"  Then he fired another shot into the ceiling to get everyone's attention.  He shouted, \"Everyone should listen to the guy with the gun,\" and he demanded that everyone throw their cell phones into a pile on the altar.  Bob yelled for an ambulance, as Barbara said that James Stenbeck would not let his own son die.  Mick, however, said, \"Why the hell do you think I'm here?\"\n\n\nPaul demanded to be helped up, so Reid and Bob got him standing.  He called Mick \"Dad\" and asked him to let everyone else go.  Instead, Mick began taunting Emily.  Paul asked what Mick wanted, and Mick answered that he wanted revenge on all of them.  Reid made Paul lie down again, because he was losing too much blood by standing.  Mick's phone rang, and the caller was Margo, who demanded that he unlock the church doors.  Mick insisted that people call him \"James,\" then threatened to kill a hostage if he saw one police car outside.  He lost control and screamed at Margo that he would be happy to kill any one of them.\n\n\nSuddenly, Dr. Bob collapsed on the floor next to Paul.  Kim began to scream, and Reid Oliver knelt next to him.  Bob opened his eyes and whispered, \"I'm okay,\" and Reid and Kim realized that Bob was creating a diversion.  Reid, however, announced that Bob was having a stroke, and Alison pleaded with Mick to let Bob go.  Mick considered that, and then he decided that he could handle a smaller group of hostages more easily.  He allowed the minister, Lisa, Bob, Tom, Kim, Susan, and Dr. Oliver to line up by the door.  He kept Alison, Casey, Emily, and Paul inside with him, as Henry, whom no one had noticed sitting quietly in a pew, asked for Mick to let Katie go.  Mick agreed, but he said Barbara and Henry, whom he called \"Junior,\" had to stay.\n\n\nMick got on the phone with Margo and asked for an ambulance, but he would not tell her for whom.  \"You'll find out soon enough,\" Mick teased.  Margo waited outside the door and helped the hostages out.  She got frantic when she realized that Casey was not among them, however, and she called Mick back and asked him to release Paul to the ambulance.  Mick refused, saying that he wanted to spend some \"quality time in the loving bosom\" of his family.  Casey mouthed off at him, and Mick put the gun directly to Casey's head.\n\n\nAlison tried to calm Casey, as Barbara urged Mick to run, and she even offered to go with him.  Mick laughed cruelly and called her \"an old sex kitten,\" and then he turned his viperous tongue on Emily and her desperate attempts to conceive another child.  Alison stepped forward and attempted to talk Mick into handing her the gun.  Mick told Alison that was a nice try, but her \"little friend Mickey\" was long gone.  He called her \"the little porn queen,\" as Casey stepped forward to protect her.  Mick began to laugh wildly, and he told Casey that he \"didn't know the half of it.\"\n\n\nMick turned to Alison and asked if she was going to tell Casey something, but Alison tried to shut him up.  Mick then blurted out that he and Alison had had sex in the bell tower, as Casey looked at her incredulously.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Bob insisted that Kim get checked out, but Susan gave her a clean bill of health.  Bob stayed with his wife, as Dr. Oliver walked out of the exam room and ran into Katie.  She was worried about Henry, but Reid assured her that Henry could take care of himself.\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dr. Oliver and Bob butt heads again, but Bob gets the upper hand. The Hughes family prepare for Casey and Alison's wedding, as Alison goes to the church beforehand where she finds Mick. He is clearly not in his right mind, as he seems to have taken on a different persona and soon Alison realizes she is talking to \u0091James.' She talks him into waiting for her in the tower to talk with him after he tells her that he is there to exact his revenge. Emily comes in, and Alison tells her what is going on. Emily calls Margo, who rushes over to the church. Alison tries to convince Mick that she wants to go away with him to calm him down, but he isn't buying her act. Margo shows up though and is able to take him into custody, as Mick promises to pay her back for this. Alison still defends Mick to Paul and Casey though. Casey wonders if they should postpone the wedding, but Alison wants to marry as soon as possible. Henry and Katie argue about him hiring a PI to find something on Dr. Oliver, as Katie tells Henry she doesn't want to go to the wedding with him anymore. An aggravated Henry then asks Barbara to be his date. At first, she turns him down, as she doesn't want to be his rebound and Paul told her to stay away, but they wind up deciding to go. Henry is taken by how beautiful Barbara looks when she gets ready, as they seem to bond a bit. Katie and Dr. Oliver talk about how she broke her date with Henry because of what he did and Dr. Oliver jokes that he owes her; he will take her to the wedding and besides he has to suck up to Bob a bit. At the wedding, Henry and Katie are each annoyed at the other's date. The wedding begins and seems to be going along nicely, but unbeknownst to everyone, Mick has escaped custody, which Margo finds out mid ceremony and leaves quickly. Paul is doing a reading when Mick shoots him in the leg. Mick takes hostages, as everyone struggles to stay calm and try to convince Mick to let certain people go. In the end, after Bob feigns a stroke, Mick lets everyone go except for Barbara, Paul, Emily, Henry, Alison and Casey. Mick is ranting about exacting revenge against those who betrayed him, as Alison tries to talk him down, but Mick is not in charge and so she seems to have no effect over the \u0091James' personality. Soon Mick is insinuating things about Alison right before he tells Casey he shouldn't start his marriage with a lie, as Casey doesn't understand. Alison assures him it is nothing, as Mick becomes very vocal about how sleeping with someone is not nothing.",
