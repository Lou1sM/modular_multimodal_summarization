Lily is unenthusiastic and asks Dusty to \"get it over with\" because she has another appointment.  When Dusty throws out ideas to formulate a mission statement, Lily sarcastically puts down every suggestion he makes.  Lucinda comes in to give them some informational materials on foundations, but Lily gives her the cold shoulder, lying that she and Dusty are working well together and \"make a good team.\"  After Lucinda leaves, Dusty tells Lily that he has figured out that she is pretending to work with him on the foundation to keep Lucinda and Holden from sending her to the nut house.  Lily starts to leave, but Dusty tells her that he is going to prove to her that he is sincere about setting up the foundation properly by going to Chicago to take a course on creating and administering charitable foundations.  He tells Lily that, when he gets back, the two of them can really do things right.\n\n\nAlison surprises Kim in the kitchen, where she is painstakingly making an angel food cake.  Alison has brought a brochure for a luxury apartment building, calling Chris \"Dr. Moneybags.\"  Kim rolls her eyes in disgust in the background.  Chris leaves for work, telling Alison to make an appointment to see the apartment.  As soon as the door shuts behind him, Kim turns to Alison and says, \"It's time we had a little talk.\"  Kim informs Alison that Chris can barely survive on his resident's salary, plus he owes lots of money on student loans.  Alison appears to thank Kim sincerely for the information, but she then opens the door to see the cake.  When Kim exclaims, \"No!\" Alison slams the oven door, ruining the cake.  Nancy comes in to find Alison apologizing for ruining the cake, and to hear Kim graciously assuring Alison that she would just whip up another one.  Alison impulsively hugs Kim and thanks her for being so nice.  After Alison leaves, Kim unloads on Nancy about how hard it is to be sweet to Alison, after all the trouble she has caused Chris.  However, Kim and Nancy agree that Kim's best strategy is to continue to being nice to Alison, to \"give 'til it hurts.\"  Later that morning, ignoring Kim's advice, Alison and Chris meet with the real estate agent, Leslie Holman.  Alison immediately falls in love with an unfinished condo, and tries to bulldoze Chris into buying it.\n\n\nAt metro  Aaron worries that he can't get in touch with Lucy.  Worried because she was feeling ill the night before, and because he doesn't trust Clark, Aaron calls Fairwinds and finds that Lucy spent the night at Paul Ryan's penthouse apartment.  At the penthouse, Lucy is with Rosanna and Paul, who have taken care of her.  Rosanna calls Carly, telling her that she left a note at Craig's hospital bedside which informs him that she is leaving Oakdale forever.  Rosanna asks Carly to meet her at the Cabot Enterprises gate at the airport before she leaves.  Paul and Lucy overhear the conversation, and are upset that Rosanna plans to leave, but Rosanna makes Paul promise to take care of Lucy.  As Rosanna leaves, Paul tells her, \"I didn't intend for this to happen,\" but Rosanna doesn't understand, not knowing that Paul is the one who turned Craig in to the Canadian police.  In the  hospital, Craig reads Rosanna's note and sneaks out of the hospital, despite Dr. John Dixon's admonition that his blood pressure is sky high.  He pounds on Paul's door looking for Rosanna, but, when Lucy tells him that Rosanna is at the airport, he rushes off.  Soon after Craig leaves, Aaron comes to the penthouse to see what happened to Lucy.  Lucy coldly tells him, \"I don't want you fighting my battles for me.  You're not anything to me any more.\"  Meanwhile, at the airport, Rosanna tells Carly that she will miss her more than anyone else.  She hands Carly an envelope \"to remember me by.\"  Carly looks into the envelope and exclaims, \"Oh, my God!\"  She stares at the blank check Rosanna has given her so that she can start her own company.  She protests, \"I can never repay you,\" but Rosanna insists.  The sisters embrace, and Rosanna goes out the door to the plane, and the door locks behind her.  Craig arrives and dashes to the door, shouting, \"Rosanna!  Don't leave!  Rosanna!\"\n\n\n",
