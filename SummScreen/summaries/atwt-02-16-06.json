But, Dusty's worried she's letting her dead brother come between the two of them and sets out to get the scoop on Madame Lacoste himself. Meanwhile, Emily and Meg have come face-to-face at the Lakeview and Emily presses Meg to tell her where Paul is. But, Meg gives nothing away and suggests Emily cut her losses and be happy she's not being charged with attempted murder. Later, Henry urges Emily to let this whole thing with Paul go but Emily is unable to forget this man she loved and lost. She surprises Henry when she suggests the reason Paul's back in Oakdale and hasn't turned her in is because he still loves her. Meanwhile, Meg's gone back to Paul, who takes full blame for Emily's obsession with him, then enlists Meg to make a delivery to Madame Lacoste on his behalf. Meg balks at first but Paul ultimately gets to her and later at Java she makes the exchange with the psychic just as Dusty arrives in time to witness the whole thing. Maddie thinks she's been careful in her efforts to keep Gwen and Will hidden but her one mistake was underestimating Casey, who's followed her and has seen for himself the reason for all her lies of late. But just when it looks like he's about to be discovered, he backs away, content instead to play with Maddie's head until finally, he directly calls her on her subterfuge. While this showdown is going on, Will and Gwen are enjoying what they both know could be their last moments together before they head off to their new life on the run. They wait until nightfall to leave but it looks like their plan could be blown out of the water when Margo overhears Casey and Maddie discussing them.\n\n\n",
