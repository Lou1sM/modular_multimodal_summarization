Lily went to the counter to order something, and Holden tried to get Faith to open up to him, but she insisted she didn't actually have a problem and wasn't purging and using laxatives like they thought she was. Her cell phone rang, and it was Parker, who told her he was standing outside and suggested she make up a story so she could ditch her parents and go somewhere with him. She pretended the call was from a classmate with whom she was doing a science project, and she claimed that because she'd had to go to the psychologist appointments, she and the other girl needed to make up some time on their science project or they'd both get an F on it. \n\n\nHolden agreed to let Faith go back to school to work on the project. Faith hung up her phone and said she'd walk to school. Lily, who had returned to the table, said she'd drive her, but Faith resisted, saying it was just a couple of blocks and questioning their trust in her. Holden and Lily agreed she could walk to school, so she left and met Parker outside. They headed for Paul's cabin in the woods. \n\n\nAfter Faith left, Holden wondered what had happened to make things so much worse for Faith between the time he'd left for his business trip and that moment, and Lily took that as an indictment of her mothering skills. Holden assured her that was not what he'd meant, but he said he had been talking to Lucinda about how maybe Lily was trying to do too much. Lily grew even more upset that he and her mother had been discussing her job and her kids. Holden tried to calm her down and apologized for making her feel he was accusing her of anything then he said he had to go to the farm to check on things for Emma.\n\n\nLily said she'd wait at Al's because she had a business meeting in 20 minutes. Later, the two women from the organic baby food project met with her, and Lily suggested some advertising in alternative parenting magazines and on cable TV, They said that would take more money and asked if she'd need Lucinda's permission. Lily bristled at the very idea and opened her checkbook, asking how much they thought they'd need.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Jack greeted J.J. when he returned home from school, but Parker was not with him. J.J. said he didn't know where Parker had gone and that Parker barely talked to him anymore, even when they passed each other in the halls at school. Jack told J.J. how much he appreciated his help since Carly had left but also said J.J. didn't need to try to be strong all the time, and he promised J.J. that he'd get a handle on Parker and his anger. \n\n\nJ.J. went to play video games, and Jack called Parker's school. Holden walked in, and Jack told him that Parker had skipped school again. Jack asked Holden where Faith was, and he said she was supposed to be at the science lab. Jack asked the person at school if the science lab was still open, but he was told that it was closed. Jack told Holden, and he said he thought they were together and visiting a \"new friend\" of Parker's. He told Holden he'd explain in the car, and they left.\n\n\nPaul had a vision of a bracelet hitting some rocks. He left the cabin for a while, and while he was gone, Parker let himself and Faith in, not knowing whether Paul was there or not. Faith got spooked and decided to leave, but when she opened the door, Paul was standing there, about to walk back in. He asked if they were having a meeting of the Oakdale Juvenile Delinquents Club, but they told him they were there to thank him for covering for them the other day. When he asked what their parents had done that was so horrible, they told him their parents thought they were crazy and wouldn't leave them alone. He said parents weren't supposed to leave kids alone but that their parents were at least decent people, unlike his own father, whom he'd had to escape.\n\n\nWhen Parker and Faith asked how Paul had \"escaped,\" he told them he had looked at paintings in art books, and he told them about a particular painting called \"The Sleeping Gypsy.\" Paul described the Rousseau painting to them, saying there was a gypsy asleep in the desert with a powerful lion standing over him; Paul had always thought the lion was there to protect the gypsy, so he'd told himself that the lion would protect him, too, while he had been a kid, and then when he'd gotten older, he'd thought of himself as that lion, protecting the people he loved. As they discussed how cool it would be to actually hang that painting over the fireplace at the cabin, Holden and Jack entered, with Jack demanding to know why the kids were with Paul.\n\n\nAt Tom and Margo's house, Casey tried to reach Adam on his cell phone, but Maddie told him to stop trying to call Adam. When Casey said he needed to talk to his brother, Maddie apologized, but Casey said he was the one who should apologize, for lying to her, and he told her he wanted to go see Will and Gwen and apologize to them. Maddie tried to tell him that it was not the right time to do that, but he said he was going anyway and invited her to join him. She said she just couldn't, so he left, but she changed her mind and started out the door to find him.\n\n\nAt home, Gwen realized she'd lost her wedding ring and freaked out about it, even though Will tried to assure her it was okay, since it had just been a gumball machine ring in the first place. When she wouldn't calm down, he told her she hadn't had it on when he'd seen her in the shower the night before, so it dawned on her that she had to have lost it while she had been digging a grave for Adam. Frantic, she told Will she had to go find the ring. He offered to go with her, but she said she wanted to go alone.\n\n\nGwen went to Margo and Tom's and caught Maddie on her way out the door, telling her about the lost ring and asking for Maddie's help. Maddie didn't want to go back there, but she ultimately agreed when Gwen pointed out that if anyone found Adam, they would find her ring, too, which would link her to his death. Gwen grabbed some of Margo's gardening tools, and they headed for the woods. Once there, Gwen told Maddie they needed to dig around Adam's \"grave\" to look for the ring. As they dug, they uncovered Adam's gloved hand, and Gwen screamed.\n\n\nAt Will and Gwen's place, Casey got Will to let him in, and he apologized for all that had happened. Will wanted to know if it had been his idea or Adam's to set him up, and Casey said it had been Adam who'd said he'd cover for Casey but that if he'd known that Adam had meant to frame Will, he wouldn't have let him do it. Casey said he'd almost told Gwen the truth, but Adam had stopped him by saying Will would never go to jail for stealing his own money. \n\n\nCasey apologized again and told Will his dad said he could get six months to ten years in jail for what he'd done. Will told Casey that he was never going to forget what Adam had done to him and Gwen, and he said Gwen didn't even want to say Adam's name anymore. Casey remarked that Maddie also seemed particularly upset about Adam's involvement in the whole thing.\n\n\n",
