    "soap_central": "\n\n        A  SPECIAL VALENTINE'S DAY EPISODE FEATURING ALL THE \n                  CHARACTERS RELATED TO JOHNNY DONOVAN\n\n\nLiberty met Parker in Old Town, and she spied a Classic Fairy Tale book in the window of the bookstore. She remembered how much she had enjoyed that book as a child, and she suggested they buy it for Johnny. They bought the book and went to the Lakeview to give it to the child. Johnny wanted a story immediately, so Liberty began with \"Pinocchio,\" but Parker grabbed the book away from her. He reasoned that if he did the reading, he would stay awake. \n\n\nThe story started with the Italian woodcarver, Geppetto (Jack Snyder), who fashioned a life-size boy puppet (Parker Snyder). The craftsman was pleased with his work, but longed for a real boy who could walk and talk. He named his puppet Pinocchio, and suddenly the Blue Fairy (Carly Tenney), dressed all in denim, appeared in order to grant his wish. She blew fairy dust on the boy, whose first words to his father were, \"Don't expect me to tell you anything about my personal life.\" Geppetto loved his new boy, but he was distracted by the Blue Fairy, whom he declared to be \"hot.\" The fairy said she looked even better out of her work clothes, so Geppetto led her into his shack. \n\n\nThe Fairy remembered one more favor she had for Pinocchio, so she came back outside and blew more fairy dust. There appeared Liberty Cricket (Liberty Snyder), the boy's conscience. The Fairy also explained how Pinocchio's nose would grow if he told a lie, to which the boy replied, \"Shut up!\" Liberty told her \"stick boy\" that was a fact. The fairy handed over a backpack full of schoolbooks, and Geppetto wished his boy a good day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe teens left for school, but soon ran into a fox-coated flimflam man (Craig Montgomery) and his purring cat companion (Carly Tenney). The two tempted Pinocchio with car keys and led him and a reluctant Liberty to a bar where Pinocchio drank a glass of vodka. The furry folks made off with Pinocchio's money and backpack, as Liberty Cricket screamed at the blockhead that he would never be a real boy-or she a real girlfriend-if he didn't shape up. \n\n\nThe Blue Fairy appeared and asked what Pinocchio was doing, and he lied and made up a story. His nose promptly gained six inches in length, so the boy blurted out the truth. Geppetto stumbled in, choking on a piece of salami, and Pinocchio did a successful Heimlich maneuver on him. As a reward, the Blue Fairy put back the boy's original nose. Geppetto promised to always love and protect his son, and the real Parker finished the story by saying they all lived happily ever after. \n\n\nJohnny asked for another story as Barbara came in with valentines for her grandson. Craig arrived, as well, and Barbara recognized the book as a favorite of her children. Barbara offered to read a story and began the one in which a down-on-his-luck merchant (Bob Hughes) got lost in a forest and sought refuge in a huge mansion. He could find no one at home, but the fire was warm and there were three red roses in a vase on the mantel. He picked up the vase but a thunderclap startled him, and he dropped it, and it shattered. In its place, lay a hairy ugly beast (Paul Ryan), who told the merchant that he would spare the man's life if he brought the beast his \"sexy daughter, the one with the dark hair\" as a substitute. \n\n\nThe merchant sent his beautiful daughter (Meg Ryan), who commented that she could see why they didn't call the beast \"Hunk.\" The beast kissed Beauty's hand, and before long, he was deeply in love. The beast proposed, but Beauty turned him down. The beast howled and then collapsed, so Beauty came back, declared her love for him, and kissed him. He immediately turned into handsome Prince Paul, heir to the throne. Barbara finished the story and wished them all a happy Valentine's Day. \n\n\nThe kids went to the diner for lunch, but Johnny was more interested in another story than his food. Dusty came in and volunteered to read. He started a story about a handsome young king (Dusty Donovan) who was searching for a wife. He interviewed all the maidens in his kingdom, and one candidate was the miller's daughter (Meg Ryan). She handed him her resum\u00e9, written by her father, and the king was taken with the fact that she could turn paper into gold. This was news to the girl, but she bluffed her way through the rest of the interview. Finally, the king took her to a room filled with stacks of paper and urged her to turn it all into gold. If she could, he promised to marry her; otherwise, she would die. The king left, and the miller's daughter began weeping. She cried so hard she did not notice that a disgusting troll (Craig Montgomery) had entered the room. He told her he could change paper into gold in exchange for the king's firstborn child. \n\n\nThe girl agreed, and the troll began shredding the stacks of paper, which turned into thousands of gold credit cards. The next morning, the king was overjoyed, and married the girl right away. One year later, the queen was rocking her newborn daughter when the troll appeared to claim his prize. The queen begged to keep her baby, so the troll said if she could tell him his name, she could keep her baby. He agreed to come back for her answer the next day. That night at the local pub, the troll got loaded and blabbed his name to most of the patrons, including the piano player, who was the king in disguise. When the troll showed up the next day and the queen told him his name was \"Rumplestiltskin,\" he got so angry he vaporized, and, said Dusty to Johnny, they all lived happily ever after. \n\n\nCraig took the kids home and decided to read them a story himself. He began by saying that there once was a rich, arrogant old crone (Barbara Ryan) who lived in a grand mansion. Her most prized possession was a magic mirror who would tell her things. When she asked who was the most clever in the land, the mirror said, \"Cinderfella,\" and that angered the woman so much that she smashed it. The woman had two wicked daughters (Margo Hughes and Katie Snyder) and a stepson, Cinderfella, who had to do all the chores in the mansion. The girls could only talk about an upcoming ball at the palace given by the King for his beautiful daughter, and poor Cinderfella had to scrub the floors from dawn to dusk. \n\n\nThe woman and her daughters left for the ball, and Cinderfella was working, when POOF!-a fairy godfather (Parker Snyder) appeared. He said Cinderfella could go to the ball and handed over his car keys and the usual warning about returning before the clock struck twelve at midnight. Cinderfella, dressed in a white dinner jacket, drove to the ball and was immediately smitten with the beautiful princess (Carly Tenney). No one recognized him, and the royal footman (Jack Snyder) snubbed him. The princess was taken with Cinderfella, and they two were about to kiss when the clock began striking midnight, and Cinderfella fled. The princess collapsed. \n\n\nThe next morning, the ugly sisters howled with laughter when Cinderfella was commanded to go to the palace to kiss the princess to see if he could wake her from the coma she had slipped into out of disappointment. He kissed her once, and the princess fluttered her eyelashes. Then she looked at him and said, \"Plant another one on me, Tiger,\" and...they all lived happily ever after. \n\n\nParker and Liberty went home as Meg arrived with baby Eliza and volunteered to read a story about a girl in a red dress named Dorothy (Meg Ryan). She was walking in a park when a scarecrow (Dusty Donovan) called to her off the path. They discussed some things, but the scarecrow said he didn't understand much of what she said because he didn't have a brain. She invited him to join her as she went to the Emerald City to see the Wizard to ask him to send her home. The two of them walked on until they saw a man dressed in silver (Craig Montgomery), who asked if they were bound for the Emerald City. He said some cruel things, so Dorothy called him \"heartless,\" and he told her that was exactly his problem. He joined the pack after making a move on Dorothy. \n\n\nOut from behind a tree jumped a lion-haired creature (Paul Ryan), who was frightened of being in the woods alone, and so he joined the others. Meg stopped reading and wanted to skip the part about the Wicked Witch, but Craig declared that his favorite chapter, and he took the book and continued. The Wicked Witch (Barbara Ryan) appeared before them, but the Tin Man told her to buzz off. The Wizard (Bob Hughes) showed up in top hat and tails, and he dumped magic snow from his hat on the witch, who dramatically melted into the underbrush. Dorothy asked to go home, so the Wizard asked if she wanted to take the \"three losers\" with her. She opted to go alone, but the three declared they were all in love with her. The Wizard could see Dorothy's problem, so he called upon Glinda, (Margo Hughes) who told Dorothy about the click-your-heels-three-times-and-go-home trick. Dorothy tried it, and returned home, never to leave again. \n\n\nJohnny was asleep, leaning on Craig, so Meg left with her baby. Craig whispered to his little boy that they all lived happily ever after. \n\n\n",
