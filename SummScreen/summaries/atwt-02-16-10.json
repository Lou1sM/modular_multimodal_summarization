    "soap_central": "\n\n \nOutside All Angels Church, Margo called the police station and requested that they not send cars because Mick had threatened to begin killing hostages if he saw even one cop car.  She was furious when she learned that a SWAT unit was on its way.  Tom approached and told his wife that he was there to support her, and she had to do her job and get Casey and Alison out safely so that they could all go home together.\n\n\nMargo called Mick's cell phone, but he did not answer.  Tom counseled Margo to think what James Stenbeck would do under the same circumstances, and she said that he would play mind games with everyone.  Margo was upset that the state police had overridden her orders because her son was one of the hostages.  She said that Stenbeck had always had a master plan, and Mick Dante's scheme seemed to involve Alison Stewart.  Margo asked Tom to make some calls and find out if there was some connection between Alison and Mick that they weren't aware of.  Suddenly, they heard a gunshot from inside the church, and they ran to the door while Margo dialed her phone.\n\n\nInside the sanctuary, Casey loudly disputed Mick's claim that Mick and Alison had slept together.  He said that no one in the room would believe that, as Emily bit her tongue.  Mick yelled, \"Emily!  Front and center,\" but Paul protested that Emily should stay seated in a front pew with him.  Mick reminded Paul that Paul had shot James enough times to know that the guy with the gun always won.  Emily stepped forward, and Mick embarrassed her by taunting her that she had once been married to Casey and had chosen to have a tubal ligation to prevent pregnancy.\n\n\nMick next gave the rule for his impromptu game: \"If you lie, you die.\"  Casey protested once more, so Mick told him to ask Emily himself if Alison had slept with Mick.  Just then, however, Mick's phone rang, but he saw that it was Margo, and he chose to ignore it.  Mick asked Alison if she had something to say, but Casey jumped in and called Mick a liar.  Alison blurted out, \"It's not a lie.\"  Casey was stunned as Alison began to apologize to him.  Mick bragged that Alison had enjoyed the sex \"at least as much\" as he had, and at that, Casey charged Mick, and the two struggled for the gun as it discharged.\n\n\nMick answered another call from Margo, as Casey lay on the carpet.  Mick told Margo that the next time, he wouldn't miss, and he had Barbara shout out to her that no one was hurt.  Margo demanded to hear Casey's voice, so Mick held the phone down so his mother could hear Casey say, \"I'm okay.\"  Casey got to his feet and asked Mick if he had drugged Ali in order to have sex with her, but Mick said no, because girls always went for \"the bad boy.\"  Casey was out of control, but Henry was able to restrain him.\n\n\nAlison begged Mick to let everyone go, and she said that she believed he was still there.  Mick, however, said only James was present, so Alison asked if he had killed the cop in the squad car when he had escaped.  Mick put his hand on Alison's throat and explained how he had disabled the officer, as Henry had to hold back Casey again.  Suddenly Mick dropped his guard and appeared to experience a horrendous pain in his head.  Alison called out to him to fight, and Mick recovered.\n\n\nMick ordered Henry to tie Casey and Alison together and sent Henry behind the altar for a rope.  He next told Barbara to get a collection basket and gather all the cell phones.  Margo called again, and Mick assured her that everyone was content playing \"Truth or Dare.\"  No one would be leaving, however, until he won the game.  Mick took Casey and Alison out the back of the church to an anteroom and tied them back-to-back in two chairs. Casey promised to kill Mick when he got loose, but he had to endure more taunting and bullying from Mick.\n\n\nThen Mick went around and got in Alison's face and said terrible things about her past history.  It looked as if Mick was about to go back into the main church, but Alison began a conversation with him to stall for time.  She was hopeful that, despite Mick's warning that if anyone escaped he would kill her and Casey, the hostages had made a break for it.  Mick was wise, however, and he figured out her ploy.  He told them that it was just about time for him to run back into the church and shoot the hostages for trying to escape.\n\n\nIn the sanctuary, the four hostages debated whether they should make a run for it.  Emily felt that because Alison had called her \"Emmy,\" a name she had used for his sister when she was small, that Alison was sending a message that they should leave if they got the chance.  Barbara agreed, and she urged them to help her get Paul on his feet.  They all supported Paul as they made their way back to rear of the church where the doors were.\n\n\nOutside, the state police gave Margo ten minutes to bring her operation to a close, or they would take over.  Margo heard Emily cry out from inside the door, and Margo answered her.  Emily said that the door was locked and they had no key, and Margo realized they would need a battering ram to get the people out.  Suddenly Emily screamed again, as Mick appeared and grabbed her around the neck and put the gun to her head.  Mick yelled out to Margo that he was back in control.  \"You know how families get at weddings,\" he joked.\n\n\nHenry, who pointed out that he had no one waiting at home for him, offered to stay if \"Dad\" would let the others go.  Mick said that he still was not done with his number one son, Paul.  Mick pushed Paul to the floor and ordered him to beg for his life.  Then he lied to Paul and said that Emily had been willing to bear Mick's child and conceal its paternity from Paul.  Emily called Mick a monster, and he responded by saying she was \"a common whore.\"  Paul refused to beg for his own life, but he begged for Emily to be spared.\n\n\nFinally, a frantic Barbara cried out to Mick to stop torturing her son.  Mick turned his attention to her then, and he accused her of smothering Paul.  Barbara called Mick \"a freak,\" and she said that no way was he James Stenbeck.  Mick continued to verbally abuse her until Henry spoke up to defend her.  Henry made a run at Mick, who punched Henry hard in the face.\n\n\nAlison attempted to get Casey to work on the knots of the rope, but he was still reeling from Alison's confession.  Finally he asked her how long she and Mick had been \"doing it,\" and Alison said it had only happened one time a few days before.  Her only explanation was that Mick needed her.  She could not understand why she had done it, but she said she was powerless to stop herself.  Casey said the joke was on him, because Alison had not changed a bit.  He brought up the fact that she had slept with Chris Hughes the night before her wedding to Aaron Snyder, and she had just done the same thing to Casey.\n\n\nA very angry Casey told Alison that he never wanted to see her again.   Alison slipped the ropes from her arms, but Casey would not let her help him.  He finally got his hands free, as Alison said she was going back in to talk Mick down.  Casey did not want her anywhere near \"a madman,\" but Alison was determined.  She finally resorted to saying some hurtful things so that Casey would not stop her.\n\n\nOutside, the state police notified Margo that their sharpshooters were in place, and they were ready to blow the door.  Tom asked for a moment alone with his wife, and he comforted Margo and told her that no matter what happened, she should not blame herself.  Margo said she wished that their boys were still little when they were so much easier to protect and keep safe, and that triggered a memory in Tom.  He reminded Margo of the time when Adam was in a Christmas pageant at that church, and it had been snowing.  Margo then remembered that there had been a tunnel from the classrooms to the church that the children had used that night.\n\n\nIn the church, Mick was back to tormenting Paul to ask for forgiveness for \"years of being a crushing disappointment as a son.\"  Paul refused, as Emily held him and sobbed.  Paul said that he had love in his life, the kind of love that James Stenbeck had never had nor was capable of giving.  Paul then told Emily that he loved her, and she kissed him.  \"Game's over,\" said Barbara, \"you lose.\"  Mick said to Paul, \"Your life is up,\" and his finger tightened on the trigger.  Alison ran in, screaming, \"Don't shoot!\"\n\n\nAlison offered to go away with Mick, as Casey ran in after her.  Alison said that she knew that Mick Dante was just as much a prisoner of James Stenbeck as the rest of them were.  She denied Mick's allegation that she was marrying Casey \"for respect,\" so he changed his tack and related how Alison had \"lusted\" for him.  Casey spoke up and said that Alison had already told him that she dreamed about Mick and not him, and she had admitted that she could not help herself.  That appeared to confuse Mick, who asked Alison if that was true.  Alison said yes, and she asked him to go away with her.  Mick suddenly suffered one of his nosebleeds, so he grabbed Alison's hand and they ran out the back of the church.\n\n\nMargo talked with the patrolman outside, and he allowed her to try the tunnel approach to the church.  She and Tom got inside the church that way and found Barbara, Henry, Paul, and Emily making another attempt to get to the door.  They told Margo that Alison had offered herself to Mick, but Casey had followed them.\n\n\nAll the hostages went outside where they waited for the ambulance for Paul.  Henry comforted Barbara, as Margo decided to go after Casey.  She kissed Tom and took off.  Henry drove Barbara to the Lakeview, and he said that when he had offered himself as a hostage because he \"had no one at home waiting for him,\" Barbara had given him \"a look.\"  Barbara said that was because Henry was wrong; Henry had Katie.  \"Not even close,\" complained Henry.  \n\n\nHenry told Barbara that she was a terrific woman who was \"strong and sexy, and had beaten cancer.\"  That, he said, made her much stronger than any James Stenbeck.  Henry said that Barbara was a formidable woman and more gorgeous than ever.  Barbara suggested that Henry go home, but instead he told her to close her eyes and relax, and he began to give her a neck massage.\n\n\nMick and Alison ran away from the church, and finally Mick stopped and told her that she need not keep pretending.  Everyone was safe, he said, and Alison realized that Mick Dante was back, and James was gone.  She remarked that it was sad that James could take over so quickly and completely.  Mick thanked Alison for saving everyone in the church, but it was not necessary for her to pretend that she cared for him.  Alison said that she did care for him, and he apologized for all the hurt he had caused.  The one thing that Mick was not sorry for was that he had stopped Alison from marrying Casey Hughes, and then he told Alison that he loved her.\n\n\nAlison smiled and said she was very glad that Mick Dante was back.  He asked her to go away with him, but suddenly Casey screamed Alison's name, and Mick raised his gun.  Margo sneaked behind Mick and called for him to drop his gun.  Mick said, \"Goodbye, Alison,\" and he hurled down his gun and sprinted across the street.  A blue van was driving on the street and was unable to stop in time. The car hit Mick, as Alison screamed.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Emily told Paul how much she needed him.  She said as long as they had each other, they were complete and did not need another child.  An ambulance pulled up at Memorial, and the paramedics wheeled in a gurney with Mick on it.  Alison followed right behind, and she asked about Mick's condition.  The EMT said it didn't look good, and they shut Alison out of the room.\n\n\nAlso at the hospital, Margo led Casey to Tom.  Tom asked where Alison was, and Casey said that he had wanted to tell them both at the same time.  He took a big breath and said that he had just found out that Alison had slept with Mick.  Margo and Tom were shocked, but Margo had to go check on Mick's condition.  Casey said he wanted to wait in the car, so the three of them walked by Mick's room where Alison was waiting.  They all looked at Alison, but no one spoke.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The hostage crisis continues inside All Angels Church as Mick who has been taken over by James personality forces Alison to admit to Casey that she slept with him. Casey is deeply hurt and tells Alison that he thought he was the one who was foolish because he thought he wasn't worthy of her love. Casey tells Alison he never wants to see her again. Mick as James also makes Paul beg for Emily's life and Paul does that until he realizes that James or a brainwashed form of him can't hurt him anymore because he has Emily's love and that is all that is important. \"James\" tells Barbara that she is pathetic because she tried so hard to be young that she slept with a man that only used her for her money. Henry defends Barbara and tries to go for Mick's gun but fails in his attempt. Alison pleads for the real Mick to come out and when he eventually does she leaves the church with him. Margo remembers a secret tunnel to get into the church and gets the rest of the hostages out and gets them to the hospital. Casey goes after Alison and Mick and Mick tells Alison he loves her and asks her to go away with him because he knows that she doesn't love Casey.
