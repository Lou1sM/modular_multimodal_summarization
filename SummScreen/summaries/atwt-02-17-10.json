Mick was also in the hospital, but he was unconscious and on a ventilator.  Alison stood and watched through the window as Mick struggled to breathe.  Casey walked by and remarked to Alison that she obviously couldn't stay away from Dante, but Alison said that she had been making rounds and had just stopped to see how the patient was doing.  Casey said he hoped Mick made a full recovery so that the police could put him in jail for \"the rest of his miserable life.\"\n\n\nCasey screamed at Alison that she had slept with Mick, and he questioned that she hadn't known what Dante was capable of.  Casey didn't want to listen to anything Alison had to say, because she had chosen Mick over him.  He wondered why she had wanted to marry him when she had dreamed about and had sex with someone else.  Alison protested that she had never stopped loving Casey, but he didn't want to hear any more, and he hollered at her to stay away from him and ran out.\n\n\nAlison called to another nurse to cover for her, and she followed Casey to Java.  She repeated that she still loved him, and Casey demanded to know where she and Mick had their tryst.  When Alison told him it was in the bell tower of All Angels Church, Casey could not believe that she had slept with Mick in the very church in which she was marrying Casey.  Casey said he was hurt and humiliated on what was supposed to be the happiest day of his life, and he felt like \"the world's biggest chump.\"  In true Casey style, he bolted out the door.\n\n\nEmily told Paul that Mick had been under the control of James Stenbeck, but Paul reminded her that Dante had hurt her, shot him, and ruined Alison's wedding and relationship with Casey.  He declared that Mick had to pay for his actions, but Emily said the police were in charge of that.  She urged Paul to take care of himself, as her cell phone rang.  The caller was Hunter, who had set up a conference call that Emily needed to take.  Paul, as Emily's biggest investor, suggested that she go take care of business, and they kissed before she left.\n\n\nPaul disconnected his I.V. line, and, with the help of a crutch, he hobbled into Mick Dante's room.  He stood over the unconscious man and began talking to him.  Paul said that \"dear old dad\" no longer controlled him.  Then Paul looked at the ventilator that was assisting Mick's breathing, and told Dante that what he was about to do was his own idea.  Paul checked out the machine carefully, as Mick opened his eyes slowly.  \"I was just about to kill you,\" said Paul pleasantly.  Mick waved one hand towards the ventilator machine, and Paul asked him if he wanted Paul to pull the plug.  Mick nodded, so Paul answered, \"With pleasure.\"\n\n\nPaul shut off the ventilator, and Mick began to labor to breathe.  Paul waited a few seconds and then restarted the machine, and Dante appeared out of distress.  Paul talked and wished him good luck, and then he hobbled back to his own room.  When Emily returned, Paul told her what had happened, and he said that killing Mick would have put his wonderful life with Emily at risk.  Nothing was worth that, Paul said, and he was pleased that he might actually turn into someone whom Emily could like.  Emily responded, \"Maybe I already do.\"\n\n\nJack prepared to leave the farm and mentioned to Janet that he hoped that Liberty's chemotherapy went well that day.  He promised his wife that he would be home that night and would \"take care\" of her.  The two of them hugged, and Janet walked Jack out.  Liberty walked into the kitchen from upstairs, and she found Janet's folder with her list of potential bone marrow donors on the kitchen table.  Janet returned and snatched the list away from her daughter, but Liberty was already upset that her chemo treatments were not working and that she was dying.\n\n\nJanet assured the girl that she was not going to die and that the donor list was just a backup plan that was a good distraction for her mom.  She also reminded Liberty that anyone who got tested was put into the National Donor Bank and could help other people down the line.  She apologized for wanting to feel pro-active and needed, and Liberty understood.  Janet told Liberty to get her coat because it was time to leave for her appointment with Dr. Hern at Memorial.\n\n\nWhen they arrived at the hospital, Janet and Liberty learned from a tech that Dr. Hern was suspending the chemotherapy for a while to give Liberty a breather and to get her white blood count up.  Liberty was worried that the doctor had given up on her, but Janet put a positive spin on it, and the two left the hospital.\n\n\nCarly met Craig in the Lakeview lounge in preparation for an important meeting with Maurice, an investor with whom they had been involved in the Midnight Sun Vodka business.  He was a heavy hitter, and Craig warned that there were no other investors lurking on the horizon, so they had better play their roles perfectly.  Craig's words to Carly were, \"All you have to do is pretend to like me.\"\n\n\nWhen Carly questioned him, Craig admitted that their potential investor had assumed that Carly and Craig were a \"couple\" again, and Craig had not bothered to correct him.\n\n\nCarly could not believe that, but Craig said that she only had to be cozy with him for an hour until they locked in Maurice.  The investor arrived, and Craig suggested that Carly begin fluttering her eyelashes at him immediately.  Carly played the role and made her pitch, telling Maurice that she and Craig had learned a lot from their previous mistakes.  The investor said he had to discuss the deal with his partners, so Craig suggested that Maurice step into the lobby to use his phone in privacy.  As Maurice stood to make his calls, Craig laid the \"sweetheart\" role pretty heavily on Carly, and then he leaned over and gave her a big kiss on the lips.\n\n\nJack walked into the lounge just in time to see Craig plant the kiss on Carly.  He walked up as Maurice was walking out and said sharply to Carly, \"What the hell are you doing?\"  He grabbed her hand and led her out to the lobby to grill her about why she had allowed Craig to kiss her.  Carly scolded Jack to get off his high horse, and Jack apologized.  He said he had just lost it when he saw Craig and Carly kissing, and he warned Carly \"not to go down that road again.\"  Jack admitted that he was jealous, and that had caused him to overreact to what he saw.\n\n\nCarly told Jack that she and Craig were pretending to woo an investor who was also in the lobby on his cell phone.  Carly complained that she needed a project, something in her life she could hold on to.  Jack raised his voice and argued with her until Carly yelled at him to leave her alone.  Jack warned Carly to be careful, and he said, \"You win,\" as he walked out.\n\n\nCarly returned to Craig, who told her that Maurice was still consulting with his three sons, who were his partners.  He told her not to worry because the sons always did what their father wanted them to.  Carly was still irritated with Craig for kissing her, so she packed up her design sketches and told him to \"wrap it up\" on his own.  She drove to the police station and ordered Jack into the interview room.  She chewed him out royally for butting into her business meeting, and Jack apologized again.  Carly said she was jealous of Janet, too, but she didn't go charging into Jack's life to interfere.  Jack said that he knew Craig still wanted her back, and he grabbed Carly and kissed her hard.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Craig was shocked when Maurice returned and turned down the opportunity of investing in Monte Carlo.  He said the problem was Carly, because \"chaos followed the woman around in men and in business.\"  Craig realized that Maurice had done a background check on Carly while on the phone, and he admitted that Carly had \"a lot of issues,\" but she had conquered her drinking problem and had talent to spare.  Maurice stood up with the pronouncement that the deal was \"too risky\" for him, and he left the Lakeview.\n\n\nJanet and Liberty went back to the farm, and Janet offered to make her daughter's favorite \"mac and cheese\" for her.  Janet went upstairs to change her clothes, and Liberty picked up the donor list again and reached for the phone.  She called the donor bank and said she was Janet Ciccone, and she asked if there had been any matches for her daughter, Liberty.  When she learned there had been none, Liberty grabbed her coat and slipped out the door.\n\n\nLiberty went to the police station and asked to speak with Jack.  The duty officer sent her to the interview room where Jack and Carly were in a passionate embrace.  Liberty knocked, so Jack hid Carly behind the door and walked out.  He was surprised to see Liberty there, since it was time for her chemo.  The girl told Jack that her treatment had been cancelled so that her white blood cells could multiply, but she said she needed Jack's help with another challenge.  Liberty said that no one had matched her in the donor bank, and she knew almost everyone in the family had already been tested.  She asked Jack to go home with her to help break the news to Janet that there were no donors available.  Jack agreed, but he asked for \"a moment.\"  He went back into the room and told Carly that he had to go, and he and Liberty drove to the farm.\n\n\nJanet called the donor bank herself from the farm and learned that no one had matched her daughter.  She assumed Liberty was upstairs resting, so she called Liberty to join her downstairs, but there was no answer.  Just then, Jack and Liberty walked in, and Janet realized that Liberty had already called the donor bank, and pretended to be Janet.  She and Jack put on cheerful faces and sent the girl upstairs to rest.  Janet then turned to Jack and said she had never been so frightened in her life.  Jack suggested she call her estranged parents, but Janet said they hated her because of Liberty, but Jack talked some sense into her.  Janet said she was so tired, and she asked Jack to go upstairs to lie down with her, but Jack said he had to go back to work.  Janet was disappointed.\n\n\nCasey went home and was surprised to see Alison there, packing her things.  She said that she knew she couldn't stay there any longer, and Casey gave her no argument.  He said that he had wrongly thought that their lives were on the same track, but in retrospect, he wondered if he had pushed Alison into marrying him before she was ready.  Alison denied that, and she walked to the door, but Casey called out to her to wait.  Alison's phone rang, and she learned that Mick Dante had \"taken a turn for the worse.\"  Casey sneered at her and said, \"Don't let me keep you,\" as Alison sadly slipped his engagement ring from her finger and left it on a table.  Alison walked out, and Casey picked up the ring and said, \"Well, Gram, it looks like you're getting your ring back,\" and he fought back tears.\n\n\nAlison rushed to Mick's room and spoke to him about his good side.  She said she had tried to be the person he needed, but suddenly Mick coded and an alarm went off by his bed.  Another nurse ran in and dashed for a crash cart, as Alison leaned over and kissed Mick on the lips.  She looked at the monitor and was amazed to see that his heart rhythm had returned to normal, and she cried tears of joy.\n\n\nCarly surprised Craig at his hotel room at the Lakeview, and she asked him to take her out for a very expensive dinner.  She said they needed to celebrate that Monte Carlo was a \"go,\" and she looked at him with a question in her eyes.  In a split second, Craig announced that they absolutely needed to celebrate and that Maurice was very excited to be a part of the project.  Carly was happy, and she said she would be ready when Craig picked her up.  Craig shut the door and wondered why he had lied to her.\n\n\n",
