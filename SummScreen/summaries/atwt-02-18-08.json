They explain that they need to prove that Sofie was willing gave up Hallie and that they didn't force her into the adoption. Alison offers to testify, but Will and Gwen say they need someone who can tell the judge what Sofie was thinking during the time of the adoption and they believe Aaron may be that person. Gwen asks Alison if she can talk to Aaron about testifying and Alison agrees to try, but isn't sure that Aaron will testify against Sofie. After Alison leaves, Gwen breaks down in Will's arms at the prospect of losing Hallie. \n\n\nAlison arrives at the Lakeview and finds Aaron. She asks him if he would be a witness for Will and Gwen. Aaron tells her he is unwilling to testify against Sofie out of loyalty. Alison returns to Will and Gwen's house and shares the bad news that Aaron doesn't want to be a witness. They are disappointed and head back to court with Bonnie, leaving Alison to wait for the sitter before she joins them at the courthouse. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Sofie receives a visit from her lawyer who is there to check and see if she is ready for the afternoon's testimony. He tells her that he is confident that she will have her baby back by that evening. \n\n\nCarly makes lunch for Parker at the house and the two discuss his trouble with the police since he shot Sam. Jack arrives and tells them that the district attorney has decided to charge Parker as an adult in Sam's death. Carly is angry about the state's decision to overlook the fact that Parker shot Sam in her defense. Parker is frustrated that his parents can't seem to help him and storms upstairs. \n\n\nHolden arrives at the farm and finds Lily cooking for the family. He remarks that Lily must be feeling better and is happy that she is back to her old self. Lily admits to Holden she is well and didn't know if his offer to stay at the farm ended once she had recuperated from her overdose. Holden asks Lily if she is happy at the farm and she says she is, but doesn't want to take advantage of his generosity. He tells her he wants to make a fresh start, but she reminds him that in the very recent past he was filing for divorce and furious with her. She wants to know if he is making a new beginning for the kids or if he really wants her back. As he thinks it over, Carly calls and tells Lily she needs to see her right away. Lily leaves, but asks Holden to think about what she said and tell her later how he really feels about their future together. \n\n\nWhen Lily arrives at Carly's house, Carly meets her outside and says that she needs to borrow Lucinda's jet to get Parker out of Oakdale. Lily tells Carly she can't help her run away with Parker. Carly explains that she doesn't want to see her baby go to jail and asks Lily what she would do if it were Luke or Ethan facing prison. Carly's words persuade Lily to call and get the jet ready for take off. \n\n\nLily returns to the farm and sees Holden has prepared a romantic dinner for the two of them to share. She tells Holden she is distracted since learning from Carly that Parker would be charged as an adult. Holden wants to call Jack to talk, but Lily asks him not to call since they haven't told a lot of people yet. Holden senses that Lily isn't telling him the total truth and asks her what Carly really wanted to see her about. Lily tells Holden she has been sworn to secrecy, but Holden reminds her that her keeping secrets led to their earlier separation and if they want a future together it needs to be based in honesty. She decides to tell Holden the truth and explains that Carly wanted her mother's jet to take Parker out of Oakdale. Holden says that she can't help Carly that way and that she knows the only right thing to do is to have Parker stay and fight. \n\n\nAfter talking to Lily, Carly goes inside and starts looking for passports. Jack finds Carly and tries to encourage her to believe everything with Parker will be fine if they work within the justice system. Carly doesn't believe Jack and once he is gone tells Parker to pack because they are leaving Oakdale. Parker tells Carly that Jack wants him to stay and fight, but Carly says she doesn't trust that he will stay out of jail. She convinces Parker it is best if they leave and the two get set to go. They arrive at the jet and Parker is concerned that they didn't get to say goodbye to anyone and that his siblings will be mad at him for being the reason Carly is leaving town again. Carly tells Parker they will find a way to come back to town. As the two decide on their destination, Jack arrives and tells Carly this is the worst thing she could do for Parker. The two begin to fight over whether or not Parker should go, but in the end Parker tells his parents he wants to stay. Everyone returns to Carly's home and Jack tells Parker he is proud of him for returning to Oakdale ready to fight the charges. Carly apologizes to Jack for her hasty reaction to Parker being charged as an adult. Jack tells Carly they will get through Parker's trial as a family. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Lily explains that she knows she needed to tell Jack about Carly leaving town, but she doesn't know if Carly will ever forgive her. Holden explains it was the right thing to do and that he is proud of Lily for not taking the easy way out. Lily gets a call from her pilot saying that Carly and Parker aren't going and she and Holden are relieved that Jack got there in time. With that problem solved, Holden and Lily turn their attention back to their relationship. Holden tells Lily he wants to try again to make their marriage work. He invites Lily to move out to the farm with him and the kids and Lily happily accepts. \n\n\nAaron arrives at the farm to talk to Holden about whether or not he should testify against Sofie for Will and Gwen. He is conflicted about if he should break Sofie's confidence to help his friends keep their baby. Aaron believes that if Sofie loses the baby because of him she will never forgive him. Holden tells Aaron that the only person he should be concerned with right now is the baby, Hallie. \n\n\nAt the courthouse, the judge is ready to continue the case of baby Hallie's adoption. As he explains the difficulties of deciding the case, Aaron arrives and says he is there to testify. The judge asks Aaron to tell him what Sofie was thinking at the time of the adoption. Aaron begins by apologizing to Sofie and then explains that she originally wanted to abort the baby and then put the baby up for adoption at the urging of her ex-boyfriend Cole. Aaron goes on to explain that Will and Gwen backed out of the adoption when they learned that Sofie was being pressured by Cole and even offered to help her keep the baby if she wanted. He details Sofie's decision to give up Hallie and even goes on to say that she wasn't emotionally ready to have a child. He states that Will and Gwen were willing to be Hallie's parents from the beginning of her life, something it took Sofie months to decide. The judge adjourns to make his decision and Will and Gwen thank Aaron for coming to testify. He is obviously conflicted about what he has done and when he sees Sofie he tries to apologize, but she is furious and tells him she never wants to see him again. Will and Gwen return home to wait for news about the adoption. Sofie returns to the Lakeview and waits, but avoids all of Aaron's attempts to reach her. She asks God for another chance to raise Hallie. \n\n\nLuke and Noah walk through town after classes and as they are talking a letter falls out of Noah's pocket. At first, Noah doesn't want to show Luke the note, but he eventually does and Luke is surprised to see it is a letter from Noah's father, Colonel Mayer. Noah tells Luke that he got the letter a while back, but did not open it because he doesn't care what his father has to say to him. Luke asks if he can read it to him and Noah agrees to listen to what his father wrote. They go to Java where Luke reads the letter in which the Colonel claims that killing Noah's mother and attacking Luke was to protect him. Noah tells Luke he wants nothing to do with this father, but Luke tries to convince Noah that dealing with his father may help him get over everything that happened. Noah is outraged that Luke would suggest he should talk to his father and storms out of Java. Luke catches up with Noah at the farm and apologizes for upsetting him. Luke explains that if Noah forgives his father, it will help him find peace; it's for Noah's benefit, not his father's.\n\n\nThe two make up and go out to do chores, leaving their backpacks on the farm porch. When they return, Noah finds his backpack open and the letter from his father gone. At first they think one of the Luke's sisters might be playing a practical joke, but when they check inside they learn the girls aren't home. Noah claims it was no big deal, but looks concerned. \n\n\n",
