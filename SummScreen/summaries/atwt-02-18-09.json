She told Brad she had just gotten her period, and it made her realize she had to wait even longer to achieve her dream of motherhood. Brad reminded her that Dr. Bob had asked them to wait before getting pregnant, and Katie perked up somewhat. He offered to go to Al's and get lunch, including apple pie a la mode, her favorite. As Brad was leaving, Margo was about to knock on the door, so he asked her to stay with her sister until he returned, because Katie was depressed. \n\n\nDusty came to the farm and offered Meg and her baby financial help, but she turned him down, saying she wanted to make it her own way. She reminded him that Emma had raised six kids by herself, plus she ran the farm, so Meg came from strong stock. Dusty asked what Meg would do if Paul offered help, but she gave him the same response. She was determined to be the kind of person her daughter could respect. She went upstairs to get Eliza, and a messenger arrived with papers for her, which Dusty signed for. The envelope came open, so Dusty read the contents and was disgusted that they were legal papers giving Eliza most of Paul's worldly possessions, including Fairwinds. Meg returned to get a bottle for the baby, but did not notice the envelope on the counter. Dusty left, but at the last minute, he grabbed the papers and took them with him. \n\n\nMargo found Katie on her cell phone making a doctor's appointment for that day. The nurse told her the doctor could see her immediately if she came right over, so Katie agreed. She told Margo she was seeing a fertility specialist at the hospital. She wrote a note to Brad and left with Margo, who offered to go with her \n\n\nHenry returned to the diner, but could not reach Vienna by phone. He emptied a drugstore bag full of home pregnancy tests onto a table and began sorting through them. Brad arrived and ordered his take-out, which Henry could recite from memory from his days with Katie. Brad was interested in why Henry was shuffling pregnancy tests, because he thought Henry and Vienna had agreed on a \"no kids\" policy. Henry said he caught Vienna poking holes in his condoms, which sent Brad into huge guffaws until he figured out Katie might be pulling a similar stunt. He said that lately Katie had not been taking her \"thingy\" into the bathroom with her before they made love. He dashed out without his take-out, with Henry right on his heels. \n\n\nThey went back to Brad and Katie's house and found Katie's note. The doctor's appointment seemed odd to Brad, and he mentioned to Henry that Katie had seemed shocked when she realized that morning that she was not pregnant. He could not figure out why, because they were using birth control. He went into the bedroom and found Katie's diaphragm container, but it was empty. The two men looked all over the house, but could not find the device. Brad could not believe that Katie was being untrustworthy about something so important. Henry was still concerned about Vienna, and he said he had been toying with the idea of having a vasectomy. Brad thought about that - very briefly - for himself, and then shouted, \"Hell, no!\" Henry asked Brad to go with him to get information on the procedure, and Brad agreed. Henry mentioned a two-for-one special, but Brad didn't even want to think about that. \n\n\nMargo sat with Katie as she waited for her doctor's appointment. Margo was concerned that her little sister was trying desperate measures way too soon. Katie was afraid something awful would happen before she and Brad could produce a baby. The nurse arrived and got Katie for her appointment, and Margo stayed at the coffee bar to wait, and that is where Brad found her. He began asking questions about Katie just as his wife returned from the appointment. Both of them lied about their reasons for being in the hospital, and they agreed to meet in a few minutes in the parking lot to go home. Brad left to tell Henry he was leaving, so Margo told Katie she was uncomfortable lying for her sister. She said Brad should be the one person Katie should be confiding in, but Katie didn't want to hear it, and she left. \n\n\nJosie walked in on Paul at Fairwinds, and he was furious with her for speaking for him in court. Josie said he was nuts to want to spend his life in prison so his ex-wife and baby would love him. He should be figuring out how to offer his talents to his daughter so that Meg would trust him again. Paul declared he was not going to change, and suddenly grabbed Josie and kissed her hard. He apologized, but a tearful Josie wondered why she just couldn't seem to leave Oakdale. She only wanted Dusty, and he wasn't interested. \n\n\nDusty walked in on Paul and Josie and asked to speak with Paul. He returned the legal papers Paul had drawn up and sent to Meg, and told Paul that Meg wanted nothing to do with him or his assets. Paul slyly figured out that Dusty must have offered financial help, as well, and Meg had turned him down. Dusty attempted to leave, but Josie stopped him to make sure he realized there was nothing between her and Paul. Paul was upset that Meg had sent Dusty to turn down his offer instead of telling him herself, so he prepared to go see her. \n\n\nPaul showed up at the farm and lit into Meg for using Dusty as a messenger. Meg had no idea what he was talking about and claimed never to have seen any paperwork. Both of them calmed down, and Paul produced the papers that gave their daughter everything she would need. Meg suggested he set up a trust fund instead, but until Eliza turned age 21, she was Meg's responsibility. She agreed that Dusty was wrong to snitch the papers, but she was not taking anything from either him or Paul. They woke the baby with their loud voices, and Meg allowed Paul to hold Eliza. He offered to give her a bottle, but Meg said it was time for him to go. She also gave him notice that from that time on, he would only have supervised visits on neutral turf with his child. Paul was crushed. \n\n\nJosie saw Dusty in the Lakeview bar as she was leaving town, and he said he was angry with himself for trusting her. Josie was not sorry she had met him, but she was leaving Oakdale forever. She refused to tell him where she was going, so she could pretend that he still cared but just couldn't find her. They shared a poignant kiss, and Josie walked out. \n\n\nAt home, Brad remarked that Katie had been unusually quiet on the ride home from the hospital. Katie went to change her clothes, and she noticed that a drawer had been rearranged. She called to Brad and asked if he had been looking for something in there, and at first, he denied it. Then he came into the bedroom and confessed he had been looking for her diaphragm. He apologized and explained how Henry had caught Vienna in the act of puncturing his condoms, but he also asked where her \"thingy\" was. Katie declared it was time to eat, but Brad asked his question again. Katie said she had thrown it out, and Brad was shocked, but Katie quickly lied by saying she had pitched it because she had gotten fitted for a new one that very afternoon at the doctor's office. Brad relaxed and felt guilty for not trusting his wife.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie continues her ruse, but when she gets her period, she finds it hard to cover the fact of how disappointed she is. Katie makes an appointment with a fertility specialist when Margo is with her, as Margo is confused and Katie isn't ready to explain the whole thing. Margo is bothered by the fact that Katie is leaving Brad in the dark though. Henry is worried that Vienna is pregnant, as he admits to Brad about how he found Vienna punching holes in his condom. This strikes a nerve with Brad, who starts to think that Katie is trying to get pregnant even though Bob told them to wait. Brad looks for Katie's diaphragm and can't find it, as he later accompanies Henry to the hospital so Henry can get information on vasectomies. Brad finds Katie at the hospital and she covers her lie, which bothers Margo more. Later, when Katie sees her stuff is moved, Brad confronts her about his suspicions and admits her searched for her missing diaphragm. Katie almost comes clean but then claims that she threw it away because she was getting a new one. Brad feels badly for doubting her, as Katie is wracked with guilt over perpetuating her lie. Josie tries to get through to Paul because she believes the best in him, as Paul tries to dissuade her by planting a kiss on her, as Josie pushes him off. Meg turns down Dusty's offer for help wanting to do it on her own. Dusty intercepts an envelope from Paul wanting Meg to have all his asset and Fairwinds. He goes to see Paul and interrupts him and Josie without sharing this with Meg. Paul is furious because he thinks Meg sent him over, as they have it out. Josie can't stand by and watch Paul self-destruct over Meg, as she bids him goodbye. Paul confronts Meg, but she tells him that she knew nothing about the papers. Meg explains that she doesn't want his or Dusty's help. Paul becomes insecure over Dusty but when their arguing awakes Eliza, they work as a team to quiet her, and Meg seems moved by Paul's paternal way. Josie tries to talk with Dusty to explain herself but in the end, she realizes that she has to say goodbye to him. She hopes that he takes a good hard look at what his life has become and works to get himself back on track. Even though Meg is moved by Paul with Eliza, she explains that he won't be seeing her at the farm anymore \u0096 only a neutral location as the judge suggested. Paul pleads with her to reconsider putting their daughter through that, but Meg stands her ground. Paul stops trying to pressure and leaves without a word, as an emotional Meg starts to tear up after he leaves.",
