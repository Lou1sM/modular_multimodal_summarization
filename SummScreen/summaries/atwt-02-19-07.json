Paul told them the kids just stopped by and maybe they just needed a friend. Jack warned him to stay away from the kids. Paul said they just liked to talk with him. Holden warned him too, and then they left. Back at the farm the guys told the kids running off wasn't a good idea. They were caught in their lies and were told to stay away from Paul. He was bad news. Holden and Faith went outside. Holden asked her why Paul. Holden reminded her of the pain Paul had caused their family. Holden grounded her for a month. Faith just seemed worried about missing dance class. Inside Jack questioned Parker. Parker said no one could fix his problems. Holden and Jack go outside. The kids commiserate about being grounded. Faith picked up Meg's bracelet from the trash and she put it on. \n\n\nGazing at the cabin fire, Paul saw the vision of the bracelet falling on the stone and a barking dog.\n\n\nEmily, out shopping, ran into Dusty. He asked her where she's been since Intruder business was falling by the wayside. Dusty asked her if she was in trouble. Emily told him to stop checking up on her and she was really working on a story. Dusty didn't believe her. She confessed she didn't know what she wanted. Dusty told her to decide or she was fired and he left. Emily made a call. The madam soon came by and asked her what she wanted. Emily said she was flattered by her attention and wanted to try it. Cheri told her the terms and set up a meeting at the bar to get to work.\n\n\nCasey apologized to Will and he accepted. Casey headed out the door and Barbara was there. She read Casey the riot act about the theft. Then Margo showed up, and Casey left. Will got a call and Margo was leaving since she saw Babs. Barbara stopped her. Margo apologized. Barbara said she was pressing charges and cut Margo down on her parenting skills and their shared history with Tom and Hal. Margo left. Will came back out. Will told his mother he was not dropping the charges and for her to leave him alone. He told her that he and Gwen were OK, and he thanked her for her help. Barbara told him how much she liked Gwen and wanted the best for them.  \n\n\nThe girls scratched at the grave in the woods looking for Gwen's wedding ring. Maddie freaked out when she saw a glove in the dirt. Gwen calmed her down. They kept digging for a moment and gave up. Gwen covered the grave and they left for the diner. There they talked about the accident with Adam and of how scared they were. They discussed going to Margo but Adam was her son. They hoped no one would find the body or her ring. Isis came up. Maddie ran off and Iris sat down. Iris asked about Will and Adam. She knew about \"Adam\" planting the bond. She asked Gwen about her music. She then noticed her missing ring and dirty hands. Gwen said she was gardening.  Gwen left and Maddie was outside. Maddie left her bag under the table. They decided to leave and come back for it.\n\n\nGwen went back home to Will. Will told her about the visitors. Gwen acted nervous and Will asked about the ring.  She told him she loved him. She went to the car and washed her soiled hands in some snow. Isis saw from the bushes. \n\n\nCasey and Margo met up at Al's. Margo said she was checking up on him when she went to the cottage. They wondered about Adam. Casey said he didn't know.  Maddie came back in and eavesdropped on them talking about Adam. \n\n\nThe ring rested on the grave. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Holden and Jack find Faith and Parker with Paul at his cabin and warn him to steer clear of their kids. Emily and Dusty argue about what is wrong with her after she misses another meeting. Emily doesn't want a man to tell her what she needs or feels anymore. Barbara lights into Casey when she finds him apologizing at Will's, and then she lights into Margo. Gwen and Adam see a gloved hand/glove at Adam's burial site. They look but can't find Gwen's ring and come up with a story if the ring and body are found. Dusty tells her that he wants an Editor or he will be forced to fire her. Emily calls Cheri. Maddie and Gwen are talking when Iris surprises them and interrupts wanting to check on her daughter after reading what Casey and Adam did to her. She wants to know why Gwen's hands are muddy and her ring is missing? Gwen covers, but she later tells Maddie that Iris seems suspicious. Jack and Holden try to get through to Faith and Parker and tell them to stay away from Paul. They ground their kids and hope this will do the trick. Faith and Parker plan a new way to keep in touch. Faith finds and keeps Meg's bracelet that she threw away. Cheri and Emily agree to work together. Emily tells her that her rate is $1,000. Paul has a vision of Meg's bracelet falling onto the rocks and a growling, barking wild dog/wolf. Casey reassures Margo that he won't skip out on her like Adam did; he is sure he will come back to town, as a guilty Maddie listens. Will surprises Gwen, who is about to clean the mud off her hands; he wants to show her how much he loves her, so Gwen is forced to go outside and use the snow to clean off her hands, as Iris watches. Gwen's wedding ring is now on top of the ground by the site where Gwen and Maddie buried Adam.",
