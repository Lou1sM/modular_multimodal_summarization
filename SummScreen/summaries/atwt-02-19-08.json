Katie warned Brad not to promote shows he hadn't gotten approval for, and Bonnie reminded Brad that she hadn't agreed to do the show yet. Brad asked Bonnie how Will and Gwen's custody hearing was going, and Bonnie told him they were still waiting for the judge's decision. Bonnie asked Brad how Parker's case was going and offered to help if needed. Bonnie hugged Brad in sympathy for what his family was going through. \n\n\nMargo arrived and saw Katie watching Brad and Bonnie. Margo asked Katie if she was jealous. Katie denied it at first but then admitted it did bother her to see Brad with Bonnie. Margo told Katie if Brad was what she wanted, she should go for it. Brad came and told Katie that he and Bonnie were going out. He asked Katie not to call or text him unless it was an emergency. Katie said she wouldn't think of it. \n\n\nHenry appeared distracted at the diner. Gray Girard walked in, and when Henry tried to get rid of him, Vienna realized something was seriously wrong. Henry confessed that he had lost the diner in a poker game to Gray. Vienna was upset and told Henry he had to do something. Gray told Vienna that he had offered Henry a way to get the diner back. Vienna insisted on knowing what Gray's offer was, and Henry was forced to tell her that Gray had said he would let Henry keep the diner in exchange for one night with Vienna. Vienna looked distraught momentarily but then told Henry, \"Why not?\" \n\n\nHenry was shocked and told Vienna that she couldn't exchange sex for the diner. Vienna pointed out that it was just sex, and if it allowed them to keep the diner and the life they had built together, it would be worth it. Gray approached them and asked what their answer was. Henry told him the answer was no and handed him the deed to the diner. Gray said Henry and Vienna had one week to vacate the premises. Gray left, and Vienna hit Henry, angry at him for declining the indecent proposal. \n\n\nAs Vienna tried to convince Henry to let her accept Gray's proposal, Brad and Bonnie walked into the diner. Vienna told Brad what was going on, including the proposal Gray had made. Bonnie said it didn't sound that different from how Vienna used to support herself in Europe. In response, Vienna dumped a bowl of oatmeal down the front of Bonnie's dress. Vienna told Bonnie she deserved that for what happened at the ball in Edinburgh. Bonnie asked if she meant the ball where Vienna stole her escort. Vienna responded that Bonnie was the escort and had been overpriced at that. They started to fight, but Brad separated them. Bonnie told Brad she had to change clothes, and she left. Henry and Vienna then asked Brad's opinion on the situation with the diner. Brad told Vienna that it's never \"just sex,\" and he told Henry to stick to his guns and let the diner go rather than let Vienna accept the offer. \n\n\nVienna left and went to WOAK to discuss the situation with Katie. Katie asked if Brad knew about this and what he thought about it. Vienna told Katie that Brad was on Henry's side. As they talked, a package arrived for Vienna. Inside were a diamond necklace and a note that read, \"Just one night, and you could have so much more. Gray.\" Vienna was excited to have diamonds in her hands again, and when Katie asked if she was going to return the necklace, Vienna said no. \n\n\nHenry told Brad he had completely messed up by losing the diner in the poker game, but Brad said if anyone could work it out, it was Henry. Henry told Brad he was worried about how Vienna would feel if she were around someone like Gray again, someone with money and connections and all the things Vienna used to have before she met Henry. Brad assured Henry that Vienna preferred being poor with him to being the rich jetsetter she used to be. \n\n\nMatt got a job at the Lakeview, primarily because Margo gave him a good recommendation. Casey was upset that Matt was playing Margo and Tom like that, but Matt said he was just trying to get back on his feet. Matt told Casey that if the whole situation was freaking Casey out, he'd leave and go to a halfway house. Casey told him not to do that but asked him to please lay off a bit with Tom and Margo. Matt thanked Casey for giving him a place to stay, and he hugged Casey. Alison walked up and said hello to them, wondering if they were always together these days. Matt said he was living at Casey's parents' home for the time being, and Casey said it was a temporary arrangement. \n\n\nMatt left, and Alison told Casey how nice she thought it was that he was helping another friend. Casey asked Alison about the custody hearing, but she told him she didn't know the outcome yet. Alison asked Casey if she could buy him breakfast, but he declined, saying he had to work. Alison told him to call her sometime, and then she left. Alison ran into Matt in the lounge, and Matt asked her if she'd like to go out with him sometime. Alison was somewhat surprised, because she and Matt didn't know each other, but Matt said he was attracted to her, and since he was single, he didn't see a problem with asking her out. She told him to call her sometime. He asked for her phone number, but she told him to get it from Casey. \n\n\nCasey walked up as Alison left, and he asked Matt what was going on. Matt told him he had asked Alison out. Casey and Matt went back to the Hugheses' house for lunch and found Margo there. Margo had brought lunch home for everyone. Matt excused himself to get his cell phone out of the car. While outside, he made a call to someone to let them know that everything was working out fine so far. \n\n\nSofie found Chris at Memorial Hospital and thanked him again for his testimony in her custody case. Chris suggested they go for a walk in the park together, and Sofie agreed. Chris took Sofie's arm just as Emily walked up and saw the two of them leaving together. Chris and Sofie went to the park, where Chris asked Sofie to tell him all about her life. Sofie claimed that it wasn't very interesting. She told him her parents died when she was very young and her grandmother raised her until her grandmother became ill and died, too. Sofie then went to live in a convent school. When she left there, she met Cole, which led to her pregnancy and to Cole's attempts to sell their unborn baby. \n\n\nSofie told Chris that Cole had literally been all she had in life, but she had never felt good about herself when she was with him. She said that after Hallie was born, she finally began to see herself as a person who deserved to be loved. Chris took Sofie's hand and told her everyone deserved to be loved. Because Sofie seemed to be cold, Chris told her he would buy her a hat or some gloves at a vendor's stand in the park. Sofie saw a baby's knitted cap there and picked it up and began crying. Chris hugged her as she cried. Sofie tried to calm herself down and asked the vendor in Spanish if she could have a tissue. The vendor asked Sofie in Spanish if Chris had made her cry, but Sofie assured her that Chris was nice and was helping her. The vendor was glad to hear it because she thought Chris was cute; Sofie agreed and thanked the vendor again. When Chris asked what they'd been talking about, Sofie told him they were discussing the weather. \n\n\nOutside Java, Paul spotted Meg and waited around a corner so he could \"accidentally\" run into her. Meg saw through Paul's trick and told him she was done with him. Paul tried to convince Meg that he needed her at Worldwide. He told Meg he wanted to help her get her life back on track, but Meg replied that she didn't need any help with that. Meg pointedly told Paul it was over between them, and she left. Outside, someone watched as Paul went into Java. \n\n\nEmily arrived at Java, and someone outside watched as she went in and joined Paul. Paul told Emily that he wanted to have the Intruder newspaper back under the Worldwide umbrella. He told Emily he would even expand her budget. Emily wanted to know what was in it for Paul, but he said it was just good business. Paul asked Emily why she was acting so irritable, and she told him it was because of Chris. Paul told Emily she'd do better than Chris next time, and Emily replied that Paul was not the person who should be offering relationship advice, since he'd also been dumped. Paul told Emily their situations were different, because Meg still loved him and would come back to him one day. \n\n\nMeg went home to the farm, where she found a single rose and a note that read, \"I will always be with you.\" Meg grabbed the rose and went back to Java, where she threw it in front of Paul and asked him, \"What part of 'no' did you not understand?\" Paul told Meg he hadn't sent her the rose, but Meg didn't believe him and warned him that if he kept this up, she would indeed end up hating him. Meg left, and Emily laughed at Paul. Paul told Emily he didn't send Meg the rose, and Emily said that meant Meg had a secret admirer. Paul was not amused, and he left. \n\n\nEmily walked out of Java and spotted Chris and Sofie in the courtyard at Old Town\n. Chris told Sofie he had to get back to work, and then he told her goodbye in Spanish. Sofie was embarrassed to find out Chris spoke Spanish. Chris told Sofie he was glad she thought he was cute, and then he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek before leaving. \n\n\nMeg returned to the farm, where she found another red rose and another note. This one read, \"I knew you'd think it was from Paul.\" Meanwhile, Paul returned to his office at Worldwide, where he found Craig sitting behind Paul's desk, waiting for him. \n\n\n",
