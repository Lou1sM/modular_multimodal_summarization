Luke was upset that life was not fair, and Kevin's presence further put him off. Kevin took off as Luke and Noah dropped into Java for a coffee, and they ran into Elwood. Luke grabbed him by his lapels and accused him of killing Reg. Both Luke and Noah claimed Elwood had sold bad drugs to their friend, but Elwood again denied any involvement. He told them to back off, but Luke shouted that he would prove Elwood's guilt. Kevin came in and questioned Luke about why he thought Elwood was guilty, so Luke explained that he and Noah had gone to the police with their theory, but they had no proof. Kevin told them Elwood had just returned to the university; in fact, he was living in a dorm room just across from Kevin's. No one could figure out why the school would let an ex-con back into school. Kevin offered to keep an eye on Elwood and paid for their coffees before he returned to campus. \n\n\nLuke mocked Kevin's offers of help and said he did not trust him. He told Noah they had to take their investigation to the next level and prove Elwood's guilt themselves by breaking into his dorm room. Noah warned his friend that they couldn't do that, but Luke was adamant. Noah pleaded with him to let it go and left for class, after telling Luke he loved him. Luke suddenly got an idea and took off. \n\n\nJade picked out a dress at Fashions that Lily declared made a definite statement. Jade said she was trying to impress her new boyfriend, so Lily asked who the \"lucky guy\" was. She was surprised when Jade named Casey Hughes. Lily also noticed the price of the dress Jade had chosen and said it was pricey, but Jade told her aunt she could pay for it herself. Lily remarked that Jade wasn't working, but Jade said she could always figure out how to get what she wanted. Emily, who was Jade's secret employer, walked in, so Jade grabbed a dress for Lily and urged her to try it on. \n\n\nLily took the dress into a changing room, as Jade approached Emily and told her she wanted Emily to buy her a dress. Emily was not about to put out money for a dress for Jade, so the girl told her she had accomplished her mission, and Alison and Casey were done for good. Emily then agreed to pay for the dress, but Jade pushed her further by asking for money for the weekend, as well. Emily asked if Jade was out of her mind, a statement Lily overheard as she exited the dressing room. Emily further told Jade not to push her luck, and she walked out. \n\n\nCasey and Margo had a chat, and Margo told her son that it was likely Reg died from bad drugs, and Luke was accusing Elwood. Casey also voiced his opinion that Elwood was the culprit, so his mother asked if he had ever seen Elwood hanging out with druggies during their time in the dorm. Casey did not respond because he was distracted when he saw Alison and Matt enter the diner. Margo noticed them, too, and she asked Casey what was going on with Alison. Casey said Alison was no longer an issue and proceeded to dump ketchup on his coleslaw. Margo asked Casey to concentrate on anything that might lead her to Reg's drug dealer, and she particularly wanted to know if anyone not in their usual crowd had attended Casey's birthday party. Casey said Elwood was the only one, but then Margo asked about Matt. She inquired about Matt's source of income since his return to Oakdale, and Casey explained about Matt's bartending job. Margo then upset Casey when she asked if Matt might be supplementing his salary by selling drugs, and he walked out. \n\n\nAlison was in a fog after seeing Casey in the diner, so Matt suggested they go elsewhere. He knew Casey was the cause of Alison's confusion, and as they left the diner, he suggested she was not over her feelings for him yet. Alison admitted that seeing Casey made her uncomfortable, so Matt told her she needed to explore that. He walked her back to the hospital. \n\n\nOn campus, Luke found Elwood's room and knocked. When no one answered, he used a credit card to pick the lock and went inside. He began looking for Elwood's stash of drugs, but instead he found a printed card that read, \"GOT YOU COVERED. M.\" Luke puzzled over what that meant and continued looking. Suddenly the door burst open and Elwood, Kevin, and a burly security guard entered. Elwood demanded that the guard arrest Luke for breaking and entering. The guard escorted out Luke, who muttered, \"Thanks a lot, Kev.\" \n\n\nAt Fashions, Jade suggested that Lily call Holden and tell him they were going out to dinner and to wear her new dress. Lily was not dissuaded, however, and she continued to ask what was going on between Jade and Emily. Jade said nothing was going on, so Lily guessed that Emily was jealous that Jade was dating Casey. Jade jumped on that and agreed. Lily advised her niece that Emily seldom played by any rules, so to beware. Jade countered by saying there was no telling what she might do, either. \n\n\nMatt and Alison got to her floor at Memorial, and she prepared to go back to work. Matt said he would get a sandwich from the cafeteria and stay in the hospital and check on her in a while. After Matt left, Emily found Alison, who gave her sister a cold reception. Emily apologized for reading Alison the riot act about Casey, but Alison said Emily had been right. She told Emily she had seen Casey having sex with Jade Taylor, so Emily hustled her into an exam room and wanted to know all the details. Alison was curious as to why her sister was so concerned with Casey's women friends. \n\n\nNoah went to the police station to see Luke. Luke told him Kevin had called campus security and gotten him arrested while he was searching Elwood's room. Margo came in and told Luke he had committed a felony and could be facing some serious jail time. She asked why Luke was in Elwood's room, so Luke told the truth and said he was looking for drug evidence. He pleaded with Margo not to call his parents, but she told him she had to. When she went out to make the call, Luke begged Noah to continue the investigation and find out who had killed their friend. He slipped the note he had found to Noah as Lily arrived. Noah went back to school, and Lily demanded an explanation for her son's behavior. He told her why he had broken into Elwood's room, and Lily scolded him for his vigilante methods. She promised to do what she could to get him out, but she reminded him that when he took risks, he hurt other people. \n\n\nLily begged Margo to cut Luke some slack, just as Elwood arrived to give his statement. Lily asked him to forgive her son, who was upset because of his friend's memorial service. Elwood replied he would give Luke the benefit of the doubt if Luke apologized to him. Luke came out and told Elwood to forget it. He called Elwood a liar and a drug dealer, as Lily urged her son to apologize. Noah arrived and added his pleas, so Luke gave a feeble apology, but added he was sure it was Elwood who had killed Reg. Elwood took the high road and said he would not press charges, so Margo released Luke. \n\n\nEmily surprised Jade at Lily's and called her a \"snake.\" She reminded the girl she had paid her to keep Alison and Casey apart, but not to sleep with Casey herself. She said Jade didn't belong with someone like Casey, and refused to give her another dime. Jade threatened to tell Alison that Emily had hired her to mess with her love life, so Emily forked out more cash as Casey showed up. \n\n\nJade thought fast and told Casey that Emily owed her for one day's work. She said Emily had hired and fired her the same day, but she was still owed compensation. Emily agreed and warned Casey to stay away from Jade. Casey told Emily to leave, but he continued to question Jade. Jade advised him to sue Emily for sexual harassment, but Casey laughed and declined. Then he told her he had to break their date for that night because he was busy. He said he was sorry and walked out. \n\n\nNoah found Alison at the hospital and asked for Casey. Casey came up, so Noah told him about Luke's arrest. Noah asked for a favor; he produced the \"GOT YOU COVERED. M\" card and asked Casey if he had any idea who \"M\" was. Casey did not know, but promised to check it out. He went into an exam room to clean and found Matt in there. Casey told him the room was off limits, but Matt claimed he was looking for Alison. Casey suggested he check the nurses' station, which Matt did, and Casey watched him find Alison and walk off, hand in hand, with her. He mused about the letter \"M\" and wondered if it meant Matt. \n\n\nNoah and Luke went back to Java and Noah told him Casey was working on the mysterious note. Luke still felt Elwood was definitely guilty, as Kevin approached and offered to help. Noah thought Kevin was sincere, but Luke remained suspicious. \n\n\nLily returned home and told Jade about Luke. She asked the girl to talk to her cousin, and then she noticed Jade was wearing her new dress. Jade said Casey had cancelled their date, but suddenly she got an idea and dashed out. She went to Memorial and found Casey in the exam room. She pulled the blinds, locked the door, and gave Casey an inviting kiss. Casey pushed her away and made a break for the hall. \n\n\nMatt and Alison drank sodas at Yo's at her break time. They flirted a bit, and then Matt kissed her. They kissed again as Casey walked in and saw them. He took the note from his pocket, looked at it, and walked out.\n\n\n",
