Babs' ears perk up and she pieces together whom Paul is talking to on the phone.  She forgets her place, and advises her son to stay away from Rosanna because she is tied to Craig.  Paul starts to reassert his wishes and tells his mother she can no longer discuss anything with him other than business.  Barbara seems to be OK with this and meekly suggests she has some ideas for the spring line.  Paul is happy to hear this news as he shuffles her out the door, encouraging her to get to work.  \n\n\nBob offers Mike another construction job at the hospital, but Mike declines saying he's leaving town, \"for good.\"\n\n\nHenry tries to get Katie to stop moping around the house.  She gets ready to head to the hospital to pick up her check, as Henry chases her with a phone encouraging her to call Mike.  She doesn't think it would be fair to get Mike's hopes up after she told him she chose Simon even though she still has residual feeling for Mike.  She leaves.  Henry calls Mike and tells him the hot water heater is broken and he's seeing smoke (likely coming from his own head).  Mike dashes over.  When he arrives, the 'smoke' is gone and Mike gets to work on the heater.\n\n\nKatie runs into Bob at the hospital and he asks her to talk with Mike about changing his mind about continuing work at the hospital.  She says she can't help him out.\n\n\nAt the Hughes' home, Chris gets off the phone with his accountant who has just told him of Alison's poor credit rating.  Alison hopes it won't stop them form getting the new condo.  Chris says he'll work something out.  Alison leaves to run some errands.  Kim comes into the kitchen and Chris confides in his mother about Alison's status.  She tries to give her son some advice, \"While you're busy being happy, don't forget to throw in a little common sense, OK?\"  Chris scoffs.  She encourages him to buy the condo on his own, then later if he still feels the same way about Alison, he can add her to the mortgage.  \"It's just a little protection for you.  Is that such a bad idea?\"\n\n\nCarly erases message after message Paul has left on her machine, when her front doorbell rings.  She thinks Paul is pestering her with a personal visit, but is stunned to see Craig when she opens the door.  Carly says she isn't interested in a social visit, but Craig steps in anyway.  Craig says he met Ms. Fettle in the Canadian prison and she pointed the finger at 'a man' who turned him in.  Craig is certain it's Paul and presses Carly not to trust the man.  On his way out, he says, \"I'm gonna prove he did it.\"\n\n\nPaul calls Carly again, and this time she picks up the phone.  She asks to meet him in person to ask him a question.  He pops over to her place in a jiff.  Moments after he steps through the door, she zings the money question, \"Did you have anything to do with Rosanna losing her son?\"  Paul gives her a look that reveals he knows more than the common person.  He deflects the blame and points the finger at Craig, \"There is only one person responsible for Rosanna losing Cabot and that's Craig.  The responsibility begins and ends with him.\"  He says he's offended she even asked the question, but she reminds him she attended his wedding where he dumped Rose at the altar in front of the whole town, \"You're not exactly a Boy Scout yourself!\"  She decides she was wrong about Paul and they should put this all behind them.  Paul comes clean with his true feelings about his mother, and Carly shies away from being a part of that revenge plot.  He promises she will have complete artistic freedom, and he will shield her from all of the family drama.  Carly decides she doesn't want the aggravation of starting a company from scratch, and as they are about to seal the deal, Jack comes in and sees the two talking in the living room.  Jack sneaks in the house and is there long enough to hear the two of them finalizing a design deal.  Carly notices her husband on Paul's way out and they all exchange pleasantries.  She admits to her husband she accepted an offer to join BRO, and Jack asks, \"Are you out of your mind?\"\n\n\nAlison arrives at Metro with annulment papers for Aaron to sign.  Alison catches Aaron up on her whirlwind romance renewal with Chris, then gives Aaron the papers.  Aaron hesitates, but accepts the papers.  Then he tells Alison about Lucy's attempted rape.  He feels guilty for not doing enough to protect Lucy, but perhaps he's more upset that Paul came to her aide first spoiling his chance to be a hero.  Kim arrives for an afternoon drink with a friend and spies Alison and Aaron from a distance.  Alison offers to play cupid between Aaron and Lucy.  Aaron doesn't want Lucy to smell a set-up, and Alison promises she won't suspect a thing.  They hug as Kim watches is disgust.  \n\n\nMike fixes the water heater, but his shirt is soaked.  He asks Henry for a sweatshirt.  While he's upstairs, he pulls off his shirt, and Katie walks in.  Her eyes can't make it up past his neck.\n\n\nAlison walks over to Kim's table to say hello.  After Kim introduces Alison to her friend, she confronts Alison about what she was doing with Aaron.  Alison confirms she was bringing annulment papers to Aaron to sign.  Kim brings up how chummy they seemed.  Alison grows a little defensive of her friend, but Kim squashes her argument, \"He's also the guy who tried to put my son in prison.\"  Alison defends herself and says, \"I don't need you lecturing me.  He's going to stay my friend whether you like it or not.\"  Kim has had enough and decides to retreat with her friend in tow, \"I don't like the atmosphere in here.  Let's go.\"  Alison inhales a mouthful of Kim's dust.\n\n\nKim and Alison return home and almost immediately Alison starts to eat crow and apologizes.  Kim doesn't let up, \"I just asked a normal question, and it seemed to me there wasn't a reason to be so... rude.\"  Alison incenses Kim and says she shouldn't have \"taken the bait\" in the first place.  True colors start to appear and Alison accuses Kim of not liking her and plotting to show Chris how wrong she is for him.  Kim says she does like Alison but \"I just don't like the things you do.\"  This time she's referring to seeing Alison's arm's wrapped around Aaron's neck today at Metro.  Alison asks her if she's going to tell Chris.  Kim throws up her hands and walks toward the cutting board.  Alison is in the middle of saying it's none of Chris' business who her friends are when he walks in the door.  He says, \"What's none of my business?\"  \n\n\nAlison and Kim try to smooth things over, but Chris still wants to know what they were talking about.  They both come clean and Alison reasserts it is still none of Chris' business who her friends are.  Kim rolls her eyes, as Chris puts his foot down and says, \"You're wrong Alison.  It's my business too.\"  Alison looks up at her boyfriend with a 'huh?' look on her face.\n\n\nCraig pays Molly a visit and demands to know if Paul called the Canadian police.  She neither denies nor confirms the allegations.  He tries to draw parallels between Cabot, and Bridget & Michelle, and tears start to well up in the corners of Molly's eyes.  She says they have nothing in common, \"You went and found your misery.  Mine came looking for me.\"  He asks her once again, but Molly refuses to answer.  He walks past her toward the door.  He stops as a tear rolls down Molly's cheek, and she says, \"Craig, wait...\"\n\n\n",

Henry fakes an emergency in order to play Cupid. Katie is sure that there is no going back to an old relationship that was very, very good.
