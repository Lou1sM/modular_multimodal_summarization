She wakes up and immediately goes to Jack to tell him that she figured out that Parker only fired one shot at Sam so he isn't the one who killed Sam. Jack is suspicious of Carly's sudden memory of that night, but agrees to go to Metro to try to find evidence to exonerate Parker of Sam's murder. Jack and Carly return to Metro and begin to look around for any evidence that someone else fired the second shot. Carly is visibly upset upon entering Metro and seeing the site of her attack. She pulls herself together and tells Jack that they need to reenact the night of her attack so they can figure out what really happened. Jack is reluctant to traumatize Carly, but she wants to go through with it so she can try to remember everything. Carly goes over the events that led up to the attack and as she and Jack sit on the bench where Sam attacked her, Jack pulls away and says he can't imagine what Sam did to her. Jack reveals that he feels guilty about not listening to Parker's earlier warnings about Sam. Carly says they can't look back, and they have to recreate the attack so she can remember. The two return to the booth where the attack took place and as they walk through the assault, Carly recalls seeing Parker only fire one shot, which means he didn't kill Sam. Jack remarks that Carly's memory isn't enough to clear Parker, but if they find the person who fired the second shot, then Parker will be okay. The two try to figure out who might have killed Sam, as Kit walks in and tells Carly and Jack she has returned to get her share of Metro. Kit demands that Carly pay her right away or put the club up for sale. Carly tries to explain that there is no way to sell the property quickly, but Kit is unrelenting and insists on getting her money immediately. Jack wants to know why Kit is so anxious to get her money and leave town. Kit says she wants nothing more to do with Oakdale and will be leaving soon, and Carly will need to get her the money as quickly as possible. When Kit leaves, Jack suspects that something isn't right because Kit didn't take Cowboy Jack, Sam's dummy, a reminder of the so-called love of her life. Jack believes that Kit may have suspected Sam wanted a romantic relationship with Carly and might have been the one that fired the second shot that killed Sam. \n\n\nJack and Carly return to the police station and find the coroner's report that shows that Sam was killed by a second shot to the heart. A police officer walks in and hands Jack a report that he says will prove where Kit was that night. They are hopeful they can prove that Kit returned to Oakdale from Chicago and shot Sam after seeing him attack Carly. Then, the two return to Metro to look for clues that Kit was there the night of Sam's murder. Jack holds up Sam's puppet and tells Carly he will do anything to get Kit to admit she shot Sam. \n\n\nPaul finds Craig sitting at his desk at World Wide and tells Craig to get out of his office. Craig refuses to leave without first telling Paul that he knows Paul was behind \"the plan\" with Lucinda and Emily to send him on a wild goose chase after his son and daughter. Craig tells Paul he no longer wants World Wide, but there are things in Oakdale he is after. Paul figures that Craig must have returned to Oakdale to try to win Meg back, and warns Craig to stay away from her. Craig laughs off Paul's warning and advises Paul to watch his back. He tells Paul that bringing Johnny and Lucy into the fight was unfair and that Paul will pay for tricking him into looking for his children. Craig leaves Paul to think about his threats. \n\n\nAfter his run-in with Craig, Paul finds Lucinda at the Lakeview and lets her know that Craig has returned to town. Lucinda tells Paul she already knew, but she has been dealing with Craig for a long time and knows how to take care of him. Paul explains that Craig is acting more volatile than usual and that they are most likely his next targets. Lucinda doesn't take Paul's warning seriously, so he decides to make sure Meg is protected and goes to find her. \n\n\nAs Lucinda is finishing her coffee at the Lakeview she sees Bob and Kim coming in for a meal. She congratulates Bob on his recovery from his recent stroke, brought on by Evan poisoning him, and tells him how great he looks. Bob remarks that he is anxious to return to the hospital as chief of staff. Lucinda, who brought Evan to town, looks sad, but when Bob and Susan see her emotion, she dismisses it as relief for Bob's healthy return. Lucinda wishes Bob well and leaves him and Kim to enjoy their meal. \n\n\nAs Kim and Bob sit at the Lakeview, Kim remarks that she has enjoyed Bob's time at home and is sad that he will be returning to his busy job at Memorial. Kim reminds Bob that his work is very daunting and she fears the stress may make him sick again. She encourages him to allow Chris to help him. Bob explains that Chris may not want to stay on at Memorial, but Kim tells Bob to keep Chris on as long as possible. The two toast Bob's recovery. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Meg finds another rose and figures out that the roses must have been coming from Craig all along. Holden arrives home and sees Meg with the rose. He asks her what is going on and Meg explains that Craig must be behind the flowers, but she doesn't understand what he wants. Holden tells his sister he will confront Craig and bring this all to an end, but Meg tells him not to bother. Holden tells his sister he is going to the police to put a stop to all of this before someone gets hurt. Meg tries to stop her brother, but Holden refuses to stand by and wait for Craig to hurt Meg again. \n\n\nAfter his confrontation with Paul, Craig heads down to the police station to report Lucinda for conspiring with Evan Walsh. Margo laughs off Craig's accusations and asks him if he has any proof. Craig tells his sister that finding proof is her job, but he knows that Evan and Lucinda were somehow involved in Memo 21. Just as Craig is explaining his theory, Holden bursts into the police station and demands that Margo arrests her brother. Margo asks Holden why she should arrest Craig and Holden explains that Craig is stalking Meg. Margo asks her brother to leave Meg alone, but Craig says he would never hurt Meg and refuses to stop seeing her. Holden tells Margo to make sure Craig doesn't go near Meg or he will go to a judge and make sure it stops. After Holden leaves, Craig urges his sister to pursue a case against Lucinda, but Margo explains she can't pull charges out of thin air. When Margo refuses to look into his complaint, Craig tells her he will seek his own justice and tells his sister goodbye. \n\n\nSoon after Holden leaves the farm, Meg gets a visit from Paul. She tells him she wants nothing more to do with him, but Paul explains he is there to warn her about Craig. Paul details his latest run-in with Craig to Meg and tells her that he is worried Craig is going to come after her. Paul sees the rose and knows that Craig is stalking Meg. He warns her again, but all Meg can think is that Paul must have done something to set Craig off on his latest vendetta. Paul admits that he and Lucinda had planned to get Craig out of town, and Paul and Meg argue over Paul's intentions. Meg screams at Paul that they are over, just as Craig arrives. Meg tells Craig to leave her alone, but he says he is only there to wish her well and say goodbye. Before leaving, he tells Meg to have a good life and adds that she should do it without Paul. Meg tells Paul he should take a cue from Craig and leave her alone as well. Paul leaves still believing he may have a future with Meg. \n\n\nHolden returns to the farm and tells Meg that he got a restraining order against Craig. He tells her that Craig won't be harassing her anymore. Meg admits she is relieved he got the restraining order, but is worried it won't stop Craig this time. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Lucinda receives a visit from Margo, who wants to know if Lucinda had any contact with Evan before he came to town. Lucinda lies and says she had nothing to do with Evan. She asks Margo if Craig is pressuring her into thinking that Lucinda was involved with Evan. Margo admits that Craig has sparked her suspicions and explains that she has to follow every lead in an investigation. Lucinda tells her to look all she wants, but that she will find no connection between her and Evan. \n\n\nLucinda returns to the Lakeview and finds Craig ready to leave town. She remarks that she is happy to see him go. She tells Craig she won't ever admit it, but wants to know how he knew that she and Evan had prior contact. Craig says that he didn't actually know until that moment, but he figured out she was the only one who could pull off bringing Evan to town. Lucinda tells Craig not to cross her or she may have to try to get away with murder. Craig ominously admits that he has gotten away with murder in the past and hopes he can pull it off again. Lucinda asks Craig who his target is this time and he tells her she will know soon enough. Craig heads off to the airport. \n\n\nAs Paul starts his car there is a violent explosion. \n\n\n",
