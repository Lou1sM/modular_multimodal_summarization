Barbara plops herself down and tells them that the contract Jordan had drawn up will put Barbara back in charge of B.R.O. (and Street Jeans) now that she is free.  Barbara hugs a stony Jennifer before she flounces out.  Afterwards, Craig tells Jennifer, with a crafty gleam in his eye, that they, indeed, will be doing business with Barbara.\n\n\nAt Fair Winds, Rosanna sits by the telephone, awaiting a call from James Stenbeck which will restore Cabot to her.  Paul and Will arrive briefly, but leave for coffee so that they can talk about the Barbara/Emily/Rosanna haunting episodes.  Just before Paul leaves, Rosanna delights Paul by suggesting that the two of them \"raise a child,\" which Paul interprets as a desire to adopt a baby.  As soon as Paul walks out the door, the phone rings and James asks Rosanna, \"How fast can you get up the stairs?\"  Rosanna runs upstairs to find James holding Cabot, whom he now calls \"Jimmy.\"  Cabot holds his favorite toy, a bear, and does not remember Rosanna.  James, true to form, tells Rosanna that he didn't \"intend to hand Cabot over and walk off into the sunset - there's more.\"\n\n\nPaul and Will go to the Athletic Club, where Paul tells Will that Emily believes that Rosanna set up her own haunting.  When Will says, \"That makes perfect sense,\" and adds that he thinks that Rosanna is seriously disturbed, Paul walks out.  He tells Will that he will not pass on Will's comments to Rosanna because they would break her heart.\n\n\nKeith comes to the police station to tell Jack that, after his encounter with Carly, he and Julia have decided that they will gradually separate J. J. from Jack.  Jack calls Carly on her cell phone and finds that she is babysitting at Lily's.  At Lily's house, Holden arrives and tells Carly that he actually was in an accident - in the cab he took after leaving his car at Julia's.  Holden dashes out to intercept Lily, who has gone to Julia's to confront Holden about the lie she thought he told about the car accident.  Carly tries to call Lily, but Lily is in a shouting match with Julia and ignores her phone.  Jack arrives at Lily's and tells Carly that Keith is going to take J. J. away from him completely, \"because of you.\"  When Jack begs Carly to stay out of Julia's business, Carly admits that her spying and the discovery of Holden's car might have made 'a bad situation a thousand times worse.\"\n\n\nAt Julia's apartment, with Holden's car sitting outside, Lily demands to see Holden.  Instead of telling her that she is borrowing Holden's car, Julia snidely offers to let Lily search the place, but warns her that the bathroom floor might still be wet from \"our\" shower.  Julia continues to taunt and Lily gets angrier and angrier.  Finally Julia tells Lily that Holden feels only pity for her.  This pushes Lily over the edge and Lily goes for Julia's throat.  Of course, Holden arrives just in time to find Lily choking Julia.  Holden sadly tells Lily that he is ready for a divorce, \"You have to let me go.\"  Lily tearfully reminds Holden that their connection \"won't go away.\"  Holden reaches out to touch Lily's cheek when Julia re-enters the room.  Lily turns around and screeches at Julia to die and leave them alone, shocking all three of them.\n\n\n",
