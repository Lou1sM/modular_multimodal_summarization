    "soap_central": "\n\nCarly lies to Jack, saying she must have left her wedding ring in the bathroom at the school after the PTA meeting. He offers to drive her back to the school to look for it, but his phone rings, and Jack tells Carly the other guard at WOAK has caught a prowler and is taking him to the Oakdale police station for booking, so he has to leave. Carly calls Nick and leaves him a message that she needs her ring back right away. Meanwhile, at Katie's place, Nick has come home late and dropped his coat on the floor; when Katie picks it up, Carly's ring falls out. She asks Nick what he's doing with Carly's ring, and he tells her it must have fallen off in his car when he gave Carly a ride home the other night, but she doesn't believe his story. Nick then asks Katie to please return the ring for him, which Katie thinks is suspicious, but which she agrees to do. \n\n\nCasey and Maddie tell Barbara she should do the right thing and drop the charges against Gwen, or they'll give the videotape of the incident in her apartment to Margo to prove Gwen is innocent. Barbara takes the tape away, but they tell her they have another copy, so she gives it back and goes to talk to Margo. When she tells Margo she wants to drop the charges against Gwen and dismiss her complaint, Margo and Will both want to know why. Barbara tells Margo it's because one son has recently killed himself and she can't stand the thought of losing another son right now. She tells Will she loves him enough to do this for him. Margo releases Gwen and Will and tells Barbara she has to fill out some paperwork. Will gives Barbara most of the $1,000 they stole back, even though Barbara wants him to keep it. \n\n\nJack comes into the station and sees Gwen, who tells him that the charges have been dropped. Jack is happy to hear the news and tells her Carly has been worried about her. Will comes over, and Gwen suggests they go thank his mom for dropping the charges. Barbara takes the tape from Casey and Maddie and leaves the station, while they congratulate themselves on the fact that their bluff worked. Will and Gwen overhear them and asks what's going on; Maddie tells Casey they should tell Will and Gwen the truth, which they do. When Will and Gwen realize the tape was blank and it was all a bluff, they are stunned that Casey and Maddie would go to these lengths for them; Maddie says it was all Casey's idea. Will and Casey shake hands, then Will and Gwen leave. Maddie tells Casey she, too, was surprised that Casey did all that for Will and Gwen. He tells her he didn't do it for them, he did it for her, because it obviously meant so much to her to help them. Maddie, for once, is virtually speechless, and they are about to kiss when Margo storms up, unhappy about all the money and paperwork involved in the whole Gwen/Will incident, telling Casey and Maddie that it's time to go and they're not off the hook yet.\n\n\nBack at her apartment, Barbara pops the tape into the VCR and turns it on, forwarding through the whole tape before realizing that all it shows is the baby sleeping; she says to herself, \"Those lying brats!\"\n\n\nKatie goes to Carly's house and shows her the ring; she tells Carly she won't give it back until she tells her what it was doing in Nick's coat pocket. Carly tells the same story Nick did about the ride home, but Katie still doesn't believe that story. She tells Carly to leave Nick alone and not to mess up his life the way she once messed up Mike's life, and Carly tells Katie she's way off base, that she  wishes Nick had never come to town in the first place. She demands that Katie give her the ring before she claws it out of her hand, but Katie tells Carly not to go head-to-head with her; Carly asks if she's supposed to be intimidated just because Katie does \"jumping jacks on TV,\" and then they go after each other. Jack walks in and separates them, asking what's going on. Carly slips her ring back on and tells Jack a lie about having been in a hurry on the roads on the way back from finding her ring and accidentally almost running Katie off the road; Katie plays along with the story. Jack is upset that Carly would drive recklessly like that, and he tells Carly she should apologize to Katie, which Carly does. Katie tells Carly not to mess around with the law anymore, and she leaves. Jack tells Carly about Barbara dropping the charges against Gwen, then he has to leave to go back to work. Katie returns home and tells Nick about her fight with Carly, saying that Carly \"protests too much\" about not liking Nick. Nick insists there's nothing going on between him and Carly and tells Katie she should give it a rest; he walks out, and Katie says to herself, \"I don't think so.\"\n\n\nGwen and Will discuss their options for a place to stay, which are basically the same as they were before they stole the money from Barbara. Gwen thinks they should take Bob and Kim Hughes up on their offer of separate rooms at their house, saying maybe she can sneak into Will's room after they're asleep. Will tells her she doesn't want to get a slap down from his Aunt Kim.\n\n\nLily and Jade return from shopping at the mall. They exchange little gifts: Lily gave Jade some earrings, and Jade managed to buy a baby outfit to give to Lily and Holden for the baby. Lucinda comes to visit Lily and Holden and is shocked to find Jade holding the baby outfit; she jumps to the wrong conclusion, saying this teen pregnancy explains why Jade has suddenly shown up on their doorstep. Lily and Holden tell her she's mistaken, that it's Lily who is pregnant, which stuns Lucinda but also makes her happy. Lucinda apologizes to Jade, but when Jade leaves to get some food for Lily at Lucinda's suggestion, Lucinda tells them she still wants proof that Jade is Rose's daughter. When Jade returns, Lucinda asks her questions about the family who raised her, but Jade says she doesn't want to talk about them. The doorbell rings, and there's an express delivery package for Jade, which turns out to contain a letter for her from Rose, via the orphanage. Jade reads the letter, and when Lucinda asks what it says, she asks Lily to read it out loud. Lily does; the letter from Rose apologizes to Jade for having had to place her for adoption, and it offers some \"life lessons\" for her (don't let anyone walk on you, be happy, etc.). Lily thanks Jade for sharing the letter, while Lucinda sneaks away with it and Holden follows. Lucinda tells Holden that although it looks like Rose's writing, she finds it too coincidental that the letter just happened to arrive out of the blue. Lily asks Jade to put the baby's outfit up in the baby's room and goes to see what Lucinda and Holden are talking about. Lucinda tells her, and Lily says the letter is even more proof that Jade is who she says she is. Lucinda leaves, and Holden tells Lily he still thinks she should ask for a DNA test, but Lily tells him she doesn't want to do that, and Holden agrees to drop it for now.\n\n\n",
