Barbara learns Paul is suffering from severe second-degree burns and Chris has sent for a specialist from Chicago. Margo tells Barbara that she is investigating the explosion as an attempted homicide, and Barbara angrily tells Margo to arrest Craig. Margo remembers an implied threat that Craig made against Paul the day before, and she puts out an APB on her brother. \n\n\nPaul awakens and asks his mother to call Meg. Meg arrives and Barbara confronts her. She tells Meg to go into Paul's room because he is asking for her. Meg complies, but Paul becomes agitated when he sees her and begins to go into cardiac arrest. Chris sends him to an OR and Barbara banishes Meg. Barbara also sees Chris and Sofie Duran in a deep conversation. \n\n\nJack can find no evidence that Kit was in Oakdale the day Sam was shot. He suggests to Carly that perhaps Sam's dummy, Cowboy Jack, can help. They set up a plan to trap Kit, but it requires that she not leave town immediately. Parker is sure his parents are up to something, but they are not willing to let him in on the plan. The Snyder kids leave for school over Parker's protests that his classmates are acting weird around him. \n\n\nCraig is flying to the Cayman Islands, sipping champagne. He looks pleased with himself and gives Margo a call to see if Paul was actually killed in the explosion. He is disappointed to learn that Paul most likely will survive. He tells Margo that he feels completely justified in what he did and that even if she searches, she will never find him. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police station, Jack learns that Paul is injured. He shares with Margo his and Carly's theory that Parker only fired one shot and that it was a second shot that finished Sam. He is convinced that Kit is the second shooter and he needs Margo's help to keep Kit in town long enough for him to find the evidence he needs. Margo agrees to his plan. \n\n\nEmily is also at Memorial and spots Chris and Sofie having their earnest conversation. Chris gets paged and Emily zeroes in on Sofie. She introduces herself and warns Sofie not to hurt or use Chris. Sofie tells Emily that her relationship with Chris is none of Emily's business. \n\n\nA nurse tells Barbara that her radiation treatments are scheduled to begin the following day, but Barbara cannot face that with Paul in such critical condition. Barbara leaves just before Meg returns to Paul's room with a bouquet of flowers. She attempts to talk to Paul, but he is unresponsive. After she leaves, he awakens and pushes his help button, which brings Chris. Paul asks him if Meg had been there and Chris does not know, but Paul spies the bouquet Meg left. \n\n\nSofie slips into Paul's room and he asks who she is. He inquires if she saw Meg there earlier, and Sofie tells him yes. Paul doesn't want to be alone and asks Sofie to stay with him. Emily peeks in Paul's door and sees Sofie sitting with him, and that disturbs her. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dallas and Jack play \"good cop/bad cop\" on Kit. Jack pretends to rescue Kit from being held by the Oakdale PD and lets her go free on condition that she stay overnight in Oakdale. Kit is broke and has no money for a hotel room. Carly arranges to \"bump into\" Kit and offers her a bed for the night at her house. Kit is suspicious but she accepts. \n\n\nEmily and Susan have a meal together and Emily tells her mother she has decided to sell the Intruder to Paul. Susan thinks that is a terrible idea and urges her to keep the paper. She reminds Emily that the Intruder is her legacy from Dusty and her only means of support. \n\n\nJack picks up the kids at school and they stop for a snack. Jack tells Parker that he wants him to stay at the Snyder farm overnight, away from Carly's house. Parker knows something is going on and that his folks must be desperate. Jack takes him and the other kids to the farm and waits to hear from Carly. At home, Carly offers Kit a homemade burger and she mixes medication into the ground beef. Kit eats heartily and suddenly becomes very sleepy. She decides to take a nap, and Carly quickly sends a message to Jack. When he arrives, they get out Cowboy Jack and begin the next part of their scheme.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Paul is lucky to be alive after the bomb Craig put in his car, but he has second degree burns over 20% of his body. Margo puts out an APB on Craig who later calls her from his private plane headed to the Caiman Islands and tells her that Paul and Craig deserve to pay for torturing him. Meg struggles with wanting to take care of Paul but later decides she can't help him recover this time. Sofie goes to the hospital to visit Chris and Emily warns her not to hurt or use Chris and Sofie tells her that her relationship with Chris is none of her business. Emily decides to take Paul's offer to let the intruder become a subsidiary of Worldwide. Emily is also worried when she sees Sofie sitting at Paul's bedside because he asked her to stay with him because he didn't want to be alone. Carly and Jack plan to use Cowboy Jack to get Kit to admit she fired the shot that killed Sam. Carly puts a sleeping pill in Kit's hamburger and then the second part of their plan will take place. Parker worries that the plan is going to backfire because any plan that Carly is involved in never works.",
