They went upstairs to their bedroom and began to make love, but Lily stopped Holden. When Holden asked what was wrong, Lily said she was thinking of other things, and Holden correctly guessed that she was thinking about Dusty. Lily apologized but said that if their marriage was going to work, she and Holden needed to be honest with one another. Lily told Holden the reason she went to Dusty in the first place was because Holden had been shutting her out and blaming her for what had happened to Luke. When Lily had seen Holden growing close to Bonnie, she had sought comfort with Dusty. Holden asked what Lily thought they needed to do to put their marriage back on track, and Lily told him they needed to move forward without forgetting the past. \n\n\nAt Java, a young woman wearing a traditional Islamic headscarf watched Noah from across the room. She stood to approach him, but Luke came in and sat down with Noah, so the young lady sat back down at the coffee bar. Luke asked Noah if he had ever found his father's letter, and Noah told him he had not. They discussed their hectic school schedule, and then Luke realized he had left a book at school. Luke went to retrieve the book, and the young lady again looked as though she wanted to speak to Noah. Noah asked if he could help her, but she apologized and said no. However, when Noah left Java, the young woman followed him. \n\n\nLuke met Noah back at the farm and told Noah they were alone except for Luke's parents, who were upstairs. Before they could enjoy their privacy, there was a knock at the door; it was the young lady from Java. She introduced herself as Ameera and said she was from Iraq. When Noah asked how Ameera knew his name, she told him she had known his father. Ameera told Luke and Noah that Noah's father had been in love with her mother in Iraq and had been \"like a father\" to her. Colonel Mayer had protected Ameera and her mother when their family had turned against them because of Ameera's involvement with an American soldier. Even after Colonel Mayer left Iraq, Ameera said he had sent money to help support them, but that stopped one day. After they stopped receiving the money, Ameera and her mother had survived for a few weeks, but then Ameera's mother became ill and died. Ameera told Noah she was in fear for her life because of her mother's involvement with Noah's father, so she came to America. \n\n\nNoah asked why he should believe Ameera's story. Ameera took out a photograph of herself with Noah's father and showed it to Noah. Luke and Noah went outside to discuss the situation, and they agreed that they believed Ameera's story. Noah told Luke he didn't know what to do, but he didn't feel that he could send Ameera out to live on the streets. Luke told Noah he would ask his parents if Ameera could stay at the farm with them. \n\n\nLuke went upstairs and told his parents that they had a problem. Downstairs, Ameera thanked Noah for what he was doing. Noah asked what her name meant, and Ameera said it meant \"princess.\" She then asked Noah who Luke was. Luke came back down, and Noah introduced Luke to Ameera as his \"special friend,\" holding Luke's hand as he said it. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, a bellhop brought a note to Vienna and Henry's suite. Vienna read the note, which was from Gray, inviting her to join him downstairs for drinks. When Henry came out, Vienna told him it was the maid who had knocked on the door. Henry told Vienna he was going to the diner to clear up a few things before Gray took over. He asked if Vienna wanted to go with him, but she told him she thought she might take a nap. \n\n\nHenry left, and Vienna went downstairs and found Gray in the lounge. She told him she would have to decline his invitation for drinks. Gray asked Vienna what she saw in Henry. Vienna gave Gray a long list of reasons why she loved Henry. Gray told Vienna he could tell that Henry was a great guy. However, Gray said he himself was also a great guy, as well as a rich man who had more money than he could spend by himself. Vienna told Gray she wasn't a materialistic person. \n\n\nBrad ran into Katie in Old Town\n, where he had just bought a new dress for Bonnie, to make up for the one Vienna ruined at the diner. When Brad told Katie he had bought the dress for Bonnie, Katie got the wrong impression and appeared upset. Brad tried to explain it to her, but Katie didn't want to hear any of it and left. \n\n\nBrad followed Katie to WOAK, where he again tried to explain to her what had happened to Bonnie's dress. Katie told him she didn't care, but Brad told Katie she was obviously very jealous. Katie told Brad he needed to stop thinking that and move on with his life, but Brad pointed out that every time he tried to do that, Katie somehow got in his way. Brad asked Katie to give him a direct answer to his question of whether they had a chance together; Katie replied, \"We don't.\" Brad asked if Katie would be upset if he went out with Bonnie, and Katie replied that she wouldn't. Brad then called Bonnie and arranged to meet her for a drink at the Lakeview, as Katie pretended not to care. \n\n\nWhen Brad and Bonnie sat down for drinks at the Lakeview, Brad noticed Vienna sitting with Gray. Brad wanted to call Henry to tell him, but Bonnie told Brad it wasn't their business. Brad then gave Bonnie the gift he'd bought for her. Bonnie was thrilled with the dress Brad had picked out and thanked him by giving him a kiss. \n\n\nKatie went to the diner and spoke to Henry. She could tell Henry was feeling bad and asked if he was having trouble with Vienna. Henry said it wasn't about Vienna but rather about the fact that he and Vienna were losing the diner, which had been their safe haven together. Katie assured Henry that he would find something else and that the most important thing was that he and Vienna still had each other. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Brad noticed that Vienna and Gray were drinking champagne, and Brad told Bonnie he had to do something. Brad called Henry and warned him that Gray was making a move on Vienna. Henry told Brad he'd be right there. Brad didn't want to wait for Henry to arrive. He told Bonnie he was going to put a stop to whatever was going on with Vienna and Gray, but Bonnie stopped Brad and told him she would handle it herself. \n\n\nBonnie approached Vienna's table and remarked that every city needed a \"Eurotrash wannabe jet-set bimbo.\" Gray asked Vienna if he should get rid of Bonnie for her, but Vienna said she could do it herself. Bonnie said she'd like to see Vienna try. Vienna remarked that it seemed that Bonnie was still \"stealing men from better women,\" and Bonnie replied that Vienna was obviously \"still a messy drunk.\" Bonnie then knocked Vienna's drink onto her lap, and Vienna jumped up and attacked Bonnie. As Gray and Brad tried to separate the two women, Henry came in, pulled Gray off of Vienna, and punched him, knocking him down. \n\n\nGray told Henry that everything had been perfectly innocent. Vienna told Henry she could explain everything, but Henry said, \"Not here!\" and led Vienna out of the room. Henry and Vienna returned to their suite, where Vienna assured Henry that she'd been telling Gray how much she loved Henry. Henry was angry that Vienna embarrassed him like that. To calm Henry down, Vienna began to kiss him, and Henry gave in to her strategy. \n\n\nLater, with Henry asleep beside her, Vienna got up out of bed to answer her cell phone. It was Gray, who called from the diner to tell Vienna that although he didn't know why the diner seemed to matter to her, it obviously did. Because Gray didn't care for the diner either way, he told Vienna he was giving it back to her. Vienna replied, \"That's very sweet of you, Gray, but I don't think it's going to work for us. But thanks anyway.\" Vienna hung up, and Gray looked puzzled. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Jack and Carly finalized the details of their plan to get Kit to confess to having killed Sam. They had turned off the circuit breakers in the house to keep it dark, and Carly had a camera ready to film Kit. Jack had Cowboy Jack, the dummy, ready to \"perform\" for Kit. Carly ducked out of sight, and Kit came downstairs. Kit was startled to hear Cowboy Jack accusing her of having taken Sam away from him. Jack propped Cowboy Jack up where Kit could see him. Jack then had Cowboy Jack say, \"You know what you did to Sam. Admit it!\" Kit, distressed, said that Sam was going to ditch her in order to be with Carly; Cowboy Jack said that must have made Kit mad. Kit admitted that it had indeed made her mad, but just as she seemed about to confess to having shot Sam, Jack's cell phone rang. Kit became suspicious and started towards Cowboy Jack, thinking Carly might be doing this to her. Carly, however, chose that moment to walk up behind Kit and ask her why she was talking to herself. \n\n\nKit was shocked to see Carly behind her. Carly suggested that perhaps Kit had been sleepwalking, and she offered to make Kit some tea. They went into the kitchen together, while Jack snuck out with Cowboy Jack. Jack looked at his phone and saw that it was Katie who had called. He went to WOAK and asked Katie why she'd called. Katie told him she was just wondering how Parker was doing. Jack told Katie that Parker would have been doing better if Katie hadn't called. Jack then explained that he had been trying to get Kit to confess to having been involved in Sam's death, but Katie's call put a stop to that. Katie apologized and asked what she could do to help; Jack said he and Carly had it under control. When Jack suggested that he and Katie might get together later, Katie told him to go back to Carly and Parker. \n\n\nCarly convinced Kit that she'd had a bad dream. Kit said the whole thing had creeped her out, and she wanted to leave Oakdale as soon as possible. When Jack returned to Carly's place later, Kit had gone back to bed. Carly told Jack that Kit planned to leave town in the morning, and she worried about what that might mean for Parker's case. Jack told Carly that Parker's life depended on them, and they weren't going to let him down. \n\n\nKatie went to the Lakeview to have a drink. She saw Brad and Bonnie doing shots at the bar and laughing together. Katie decided to say hello to them, and Brad invited her to join them, but Katie begged off, saying she was tired. Katie told them to have fun, and Bonnie said they would. Brad then called out a \"goodnight\" to Katie; Katie turned and told Brad goodnight, and they exchanged a poignant look. \n\n\n\n\n",
