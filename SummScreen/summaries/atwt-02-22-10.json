Lily said she realized that Holden didn't know any more about what happened than she did.  Lily also admitted that she had changed her mind because Damian had sent her his wedding ring and a note.  The important thing, Lily asserted, was that Damian was alive and out there somewhere.\n\n\nIt comforted Lily to know that Damian was finally out of their lives, and Holden looked relieved.  Molly walked in, and Holden gave her the news that Damian was still alive.  She hugged Holden, while Lily watched with a sour expression. Lily was suddenly eager to leave, but Holden reminded her that their lunch hadn't arrived yet.  Lily looked at him and said she was sure that Molly didn't mind her \"leftovers.\"\n\n\nMolly and Holden went to the Lakeview, and Holden opened a bottle of champagne in the room.  He poured two glasses and toasted to Damian because Holden was so grateful that \"the S.O.B. was alive.\"  He also thanked Molly for advising him not to go to the police, and they began to kiss.  They made love, and Molly said that she had dreams about making love to Holden again.  Holden thought it was a good idea for the two of them to visit their daughter, Abigail, in California.\n\n\nAt Lily's, Noah had packed his belongings and was waiting for a van to pick him up and take him to his new place with Maddie.  Luke was sad, but Noah reiterated that he needed to know that he could survive on his own.  Luke promised to leave Noah alone if only he would stay, but Noah knew that would not work.  Margo rang the bell and asked for Lily, but when Luke told her his mother was not at home, Margo broke the news that the Maltese authorities had recovered a body that had been positively identified as Damian Grimaldi.\n\n\nLuke asked if the police were sure, and Margo said yes.  The body had been in the water for some time, and the Maltese authorities were handling the investigation.  The coroner was fairly certain that foul play was involved, and that upset Luke even more.  He told Margo that Damian had left him in charge of the shipping company just before he left, but then Luke broke down.  Margo asked him to bring Lily to the station when she returned, and Margo walked out.  Noah offered to stay with Luke, but then the two argued.  Luke urged Noah to make his decision: either Noah was with Luke or he was not.\n\n\nLily went home and found a gloomy Luke waiting for her.  Before Luke could blurt out the bad news about Damian, Lily surprised him by saying that she had \"good news\" for him.  She showed her son Damian's ring, which Luke instantly recognized, and the note, but then Luke blurted out that Margo had brought them news that Damian was dead in Malta.  Lily was confused and asked her son if he thought Damian was really dead, and then she called Margo to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Margo walked on the docks and spotted a small boy, Arthur, who sat with his sailboat.  He was the boy who had spoken to Molly on the day Damian had disappeared.  Margo talked with Arthur, and gave him a deputy's badge for being a good observer.  He told her that he had been very frightened that day, and he had spoken to \"the other lady\" about the men who were fighting.  Margo asked what exactly the boy had seen, and he replied that the man who was bleeding was on the freighter deck, and the \"other man ran away.\"\n\n\nMargo took the call from Lily, who claimed that Damian was alive and had sent her his wedding ring and a note in an envelope.  She also mentioned that Holden swore he had seen Damian get on a ship that afternoon, and then Margo realized that \"the other man\" had been Holden.  Margo asked Lily to take the envelope and its contents to the police station, and they agreed to meet there.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Carly hemmed and hawed, trying to tell Jack what she knew about Janet's affair with Dusty.  She was just about to tell him outside the front door when Janet joined them, and Carly had to back down.  Janet told Carly it was not a good time for them, and Jack filled in that Liberty was running a fever and was back in the hospital.  Because chicken pox was rampant in the high school, the doctor had admitted Liberty to be safe.  Carly offered to stay and talk privately with Jack if Janet had to go to Liberty, but over Jack's protests, Janet said that in order to provide a bone marrow match for Liberty, she and Jack were going to have a baby.\n\n\nCarly was gobsmacked and looked at Jack for an explanation.  When he offered none, Carly asked if Janet was already pregnant, and she answered no.  Jack backpedaled and said there were still a lot that he and Janet needed to discuss, but Janet was obviously convinced that a Ciccone/Snyder child would save Liberty's life.  Carly excused herself and left in a hurry, as Jack and Janet went inside.  Jack demanded to know why Janet had told Carly that, and Janet said that Carly would have found out soon enough, and besides, Janet was convinced that Liberty's life depended on it.\n\n\nJack disagreed and was not willing to make such a life-changing decision without input from the doctors and perhaps even Janet's priest.  Janet said that having a baby was a huge commitment, and she had seen how Jack and Carly looked at one another.  Janet said it appeared that Jack was willing to do anything that would save Liberty's life except commit to his wife.  Jack said that he knew Janet was terrified, and he asked for some time to think about it.  Janet left to take some books to her daughter at the hospital.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview bar, Craig discussed the lack of investors for Monte Carlo with Ellis, his financial advisor.  He asked how much he could pull together on his own if he liquidated all of his assets, and Ellis answered that it would be enough to justify a numbered account in the Cayman Islands.  Craig decided that he would back the new startup company himself, because Carly only needed enough capital to get the company on its feet.  Ellis chuckled and said that Craig probably meant \"off her feet,\" but Craig said he drew no distinction between business and pleasure in some endeavors.\n\n\nCraig returned to his room, where Carly paid him a surprise visit.  She dashed in, full of frenetic energy, and she invited him to supper so that they could \"fiddle\" with the Monte Carlo business plan.  Craig agreed and offered to call down to the dining room for a reservation, but Carly was all over the place with her thoughts.  Craig asked her what was going on, and finally Carly confessed that she wanted a drink so badly that she was \"crawling out of her skin.\"  Craig asked what he could do, and Carly asked to stay with him, \"as the lesser of two evils.\"  She maintained that Craig's \"slimy self\" was better than a drinking binge.\n\n\nCraig asked what had brought on the crisis, and Carly announced that Janet and Jack were going to have a baby so that Liberty would have a blood marrow match.  \"How do you trump a dying kid?\" asked Carly, and Craig answered, \"You don't.  You shut up and take it.\"  On the other hand, Craig offered, it might be the best thing that had happened to Carly because she needed to realize that things never worked out for her and Jack.  If he and Janet had a baby, Carly would have to wait another 18 years for her lover.  Craig thought it was obvious that, for whatever reason, Jack was devoted to Janet, and he would never leave her.  Craig put his arm around Carly and kissed the top of her head, but she went ballistic.  She proclaimed that was \"completely inappropriate,\" and she dashed out the door.\n\n\nMargo stopped by the farm on her way back to the station to meet Lily and Luke.  She interrupted Holden and Molly, who were kissing again after their return from the Lakeview.  Margo told them about Damian's body in Malta, and she said that she understood that Holden was the last person to see Damian alive.  Holden said that Lily had proof that Damian was still alive, but Margo was not at all convinced.  Molly began to get aggressive with Margo, until Holden asked her to back off.\n\n\nMargo said that her witness described a violent physical confrontation between Holden and Damian that ended with an unconscious and bloodied Damian on the deck of a freighter.  Holden admitted that, so Margo said she had to take him in to the station.  As Holden put on his coat, Lily and Luke entered.  They were on their way to the station to meet Margo, so she explained what was going on.\n\n\nJack took some of the kids' books to Carly's house, but no one was home.  He took them inside, and suddenly Craig pounded on the door.  The two of them traded barbs, and Craig said \"Congratulations\" to Jack on his expected \"bouncy bundle of joy.\"  Jack told him to mind his own business and called Craig \"toxic.\"  Then Jack told him that Carly would never be Craig's again.\n\n\nCarly dropped off some magazines and sketching exercises for Liberty at the hospital, but Janet saw her as she was leaving.  Liberty was asleep, so Carly said she had left the material with a nurse.  Janet thanked her and said Carly had \"done enough.\" Then she asked Carly to leave her family alone.  Janet said that Carly was spending too much time with Janet's husband, and Janet wanted it to stop.  Carly reminded Janet that she had asked Carly to be part of Liberty's team, but Janet said that was before she knew that Carly would use Liberty to get closer to Jack.\n\n\n Janet then raised her voice and warned Carly to stay away from Jack.  Carly got really angry and lowered her voice, telling Janet to save her speech for the person who really needed to hear it.  When Janet looked puzzled, Carly said, \"Your boyfriend, Dusty Donovan.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lily apologizes to Holden about how hard she was on him about Damian's disappearance, as she tells him about the ring and goodbye note Damian left for her, as Molly happens upon this conversation as well. Holden is happy to hear this news. Luke and Noah talk about their relationship and why Noah feels he has to move out. Luke doesn't really understand, but their conversation is interrupted when Margo arrives to tell Luke about Damian's body being recovered off of the Malta coast. Luke is very upset and Noah tries to comfort him, but Luke doesn't want him to stay out of guilt. Noah tries to help, but Luke is sure that he only will be around for a short time and then he will leave again because he feels he has to and he would rather deal with this alone if that is what Noah plans on doing. Craig talks to his business associate about putting all of his money into Monte Carlo after getting no bites on financial backing, as his associate, Ellis, is sure it is because he wants Carly back. Molly and Holden celebrate by getting a room at the Lakeview, as Holden is thrilled Damian is alive even though he hates him; he really was worried that he killed him. Molly and Holden wind up in bed and making plans to go see Abigail, which couldn't make Molly happier. Carly wants to tell Jack what she knows about Janet and Dusty, but they are interrupted by Janet, who tells Carly that they don't have time to talk because Liberty is back in the hospital. Carly is worried, but Janet isn't too concerned with her reaction; she is more concerned with telling her that she and Jack are going to have a baby for a match for Liberty. Jack tries to stop her and even explains why, but Carly is thrown and leaves quickly. Carly goes to see Craig talking a mile a minute when he wonders what is going on. She wants to drink, as Craig is able to find out why she is so rattled. In a roundabout way, he reinforces subtly that because of this new baby-to-be, her life with Jack is now over; Jack will always do the right thing. Jack and Janet discuss the baby, as Jack is clearly not on board because of the lifetime commitment, which is not loss on Janet who calls him on it claiming it is because of Carly. Jack promises to think about it. Margo finds a young boy on the docks and learns of Damian and another man fighting. Luke tells Lily about Damian, but Lily won't believe it. She is adamant there has been a mistake and calls Margo to tell her about the ring. Inadvertently, she tells Margo that Holden saw Damian on the docks and Margo puts together that the boy saw Holden and Damian fighting and goes to find Holden. Holden is shocked to learn Damian is dead, as Molly doesn't want him to talk. Holden finally admits to fighting and seeing Damian on the docks. Margo takes Holden into the station, as Lily and Luke show up; Lily insists that Holden tell Margo that he wasn't involved. Craig and Jack have another bit of a showdown, as Craig gloats about knowing about news of the baby. Jack wants Craig to back off, but Craig tells him that he has his priorities now with the new baby and Carly can't be one of them. Janet and Carly run into one another, as Janet tells Carly that she appreciates what she did for Liberty, but she wants her now to stay away from her Jack. Carly doesn't understand, so Janet spells it out; she is spending too much time with Jack. She won't let her threaten her family right now when that is all she cares about to survive. Carly snaps and explains that Janet is talking to the wrong person about her marriage. She is ruining her marriage all on her own; she should be having this conversation with her boyfriend, Dusty, as Janet looks stunned.",

Jack and Janet went to Liberty, and Jack told Janet that he was a marrow donor and that she should go over his protests.\n"
