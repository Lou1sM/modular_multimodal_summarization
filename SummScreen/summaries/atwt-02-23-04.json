Mike told Katie that he felt that he needed to leave town to get off the merry-go-round that their relationship had become.  As the two began to share a tender moment, Henry walked back in, and Mike took advantage of the break in the mood to escape.  Katie planned to drown her sorrows in ice cream.\n\n\nIn the Hugheses' kitchen, Chris protested to Kim that he was not threatened by Alison's relationship with Aaron, in spite of the fact that Kim had seen Alison and Aaron hugging at the hospital.  Aaron arrived at that very moment with the annulment papers and asked to speak to Chris.  He sincerely apologized to Chris, saying that he had been wrong about what had happened in Chicago.  Chris forgave him, and the two young men shook hands.  Alison walked outside with Aaron and thanked him for his apology to Chris.  \n\n\nAlison and Aaron embraced and promised to remain good friends.  Alison went upstairs to get ready to go to the hospital to work, and Chris asked Kim to stop lecturing Alison.  He left a shaky and tearful Kim standing in the kitchen.  Aaron went to Al's Diner, where he found Clark sweet-talking a new girl.  Aaron warned the girl to watch what she was drinking when she was with Clark, causing the girl to stalk away from Clark.  Clark threatened Aaron, \"Back off, or you'll regret it.\"\n\n\nAt home, Jack questioned Carly about her decision to go to work for BRO, and Carly admitted that Barbara didn't know that Paul had offered her a job.  Jack immediately guessed that Paul was planning to kick Barbara out of the business and that he wanted to have Carly waiting in the wings.  He warned Carly that she was bound to get hurt if she went along with Paul's plan, but Carly insisted that she wanted the opportunity to become a success right away and that she was willing to take the risk.  She finished, \"Just don't get in my way, okay?\"  When Jack reminded Carly that when she was designing she got reckless, Carly was hurt that Jack didn't have faith in her good judgment.\n\n\nAt Metro, Molly told Craig that she had let it slip to Paul that there might be trouble with Cabot's adoption.  Molly begged Craig's forgiveness, but Craig blamed only Paul.  Paul had gone to see Lucy at Fairwinds.  She told Paul that she was considering moving back to Montega, but Paul answered, \"I never figured you for a quitter.\"  He put his arms around her to comfort her, and just then, Craig walked into the room.  \n\n\nCraig greeted Paul sarcastically, \"What a good friend you are, always there in times of trouble.\" Craig insisted that Lucy leave the room, and he confronted Paul about betraying Craig to the Canadian authorities.  Paul responded by confronting Craig, \"While you were out there cleaning up your latest disaster, your little girl nearly got raped!\"  Paul told Craig that he was the one who had saved Lucy, accusing, \"You were never a worthy parent to Cabot.  Now Lucy is starting to figure out that she deserves better, too.\"\n\n\n",
