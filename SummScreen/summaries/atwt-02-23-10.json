    "soap_central": "\n\n \nIn the Oakdale Police Station, Lily, Molly, and Luke worried, while Margo interrogated Holden.  Lily and Luke comforted one another by remembering that Damian had to be alive because he had sent Lily the note and his wedding ring.  Molly, however, appeared anxious about what Lily was sure would exonerate Holden, and that was tracing the ring back to Damian.  Molly asked where the ring was, and Lily said she had given it to Margo.  Molly looked upset and grumbled about how long it was taking Margo to question Holden.  She said she needed a cup of real coffee, and she took off in a hurry for Java.\n\n\nInside the interrogation room, Margo told Holden that, despite Damian's long list of transgressions, she could not turn a blind eye to \"vigilante justice.\"  Holden claimed that he had only been defending himself against Damian's attack, and Margo told him that he needn't worry about that any longer because Damian was dead.  She also said that the authorities in Malta wanted to crucify his killer.  Holden admitted readily that he and Damian had fought, but he was positive that Damian was alive when he had boarded the freighter.\n\n\nHolden also relied on the note and ring to Lily as further evidence, but just then, an officer joined them and handed Margo a paper, which she read.  She looked at Holden and declared that the interview was over, and Holden should seek legal representation immediately.  Then she notified Holden that Damian had not sent the ring to Lily; a local jeweler had made it for someone who wanted it to appear that Damian was still alive.  Margo said that changed everything, and she needed to place Holden under arrest.\n\n\nMargo walked out to get the necessary paperwork, and Luke joined Holden.  The boy wanted some answers, but Holden said he didn't have them.  Luke wanted to know if Holden had killed Damian, and Holden's answer was, \"I don't know.\"  He explained about the fight on the dock and that Damian had jumped him first.  Holden was positive that Damian had been alive, because Holden had carried him on board the ship and left him.  The man was unconscious, but certainly alive.  Luke was upset that Holden had lied to them, and he went out and asked Margo for a copy of the coroner's report on Damian.  Margo said it was against regulations to give it to him.\n\n\nIn Java, Molly was talking on her phone to someone about not having the ring traced back to her when Lily joined her. Lily accused Molly of duplicating Damian's ring so that Lily would think that he was still alive.  Molly denied that, but Lily told her that the cops knew that the ring was a fake and would soon trace it back to Molly.  Lily was concerned because Holden was in more trouble than ever because of Molly's dumb stunt.  The women walked outside, and Molly asked Lily to listen, but Lily was too angry.\n\n\nLily reminded Molly that she had lied her way into Lily's house the other day, had faked a coughing fit to steal a photo and set up her hoax, and she had forged Damian's handwriting and signature.  Molly, in turn, accused Lily of doing nothing to protect Holden except to whine, moan, and accuse him of hurting a despicable man who had turned her life upside down.  Finally Molly walked away, but Lily followed her back to the police station, where they learned that Margo had arrested Holden.\n\n\nHolden began talking about the \"fake ring,\" and he said that Tom would be arriving soon to represent him.  He told Lily that Luke was not happy, and he had walked out.  Holden asked to speak with Molly alone, and Margo sent them into the interrogation room.  Holden asked why Molly had sent a copy of Damian's ring, but then he realized that she was only trying to get him off the hook.  He asked her not to mention her involvement to Margo, but Molly said that Lily was on the warpath, and she had probably already told Margo herself.\n\n\nHolden next asked Lily to join them in the room, but the two women began to argue instantly.  Holden asked Molly to step outside, and he told Lily that, sadly, he had stopped trusting her the day she had remarried Damian.  He asked her if she wanted to help him clear his name, or if she was more interested in finding out what had happened to Damian.  Lily cried that she wanted to help Holden.  Margo and Molly entered, and Margo said that the Maltese police had contacted them and wanted Holden extradited to Malta to stand trial for Damian's murder.\n\n\nLuke acquired photos of the body identified by the Malta authorities, and he went to Memorial to look for Dr. Bob Hughes.  He literally ran into Dr. Reid Oliver instead, and he dropped his file of pictures.  Reid helped Luke retrieve his photos after slinging several barbs his way, and Reid glanced at some of the postmortem pictures.  Luke explained that they were shots of Damian's body, and Dr. Oliver said, \"Ouch!\"  Luke shared that he was hoping to show them to Bob so he could tell him exactly how his father had died.  Oliver offered to take a better look at the file, but Luke turned him down.\n\n\nDr. Oliver asked Luke just how stupid Luke was to not let a world-famous neurologist look at the pictures, and he took the file.  He looked at the pictures carefully and then remarked that it must have been very difficult dealing with Damian's \"condition\" before he died.  Luke was confused and mentioned that Damian had been in perfect health.  Dr. Oliver said that the person whose photos he was examining had advanced Huntington's disease, and he could no longer walk or talk.  Luke said Damian had nothing like that, so Reid said that \"the poor bastard in the photos\" was not Luke's father.\n\n\nJack was at Memorial, but he talked to Liberty by phone because he still had to stay away from her since he had never had chicken pox as a child.  He took her a DVD player and some movies, and he asked Liberty to send out Janet to take them to her.  Liberty said her mother wasn't there, and she asked him to send the movies in with a nurse because she was really bored.  When Jack hung up, Dusty walked up, and when Jack found out Dusty had \"the pox\" as a child, he asked Dusty to take the player and films in to Liberty and to set it up.  Dusty agreed, and he went into the girl's room.\n\n\nDusty and Liberty chatted about the fun they had throwing rocks at the windows of a building in Detroit during Sage's pageant, and Dusty reminded her how good it had felt to blow off steam.  Liberty hoped that Dusty had smuggled in more rocks, but he said he had something even better.  He went outside and carried in a child's punching bag that had CANCER written on it in bright red letters.  Dusty held it on Liberty's bedside table and invited her to take a swing.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Carly shadowed Janet, who was irritated that Carly had made a nasty accusation about Janet and Dusty right outside Liberty's room.  Carly claimed that she was \"just bringing the truth to light,\" but Janet scolded her and said Dusty was not her boyfriend.  She called him \"just a friend,\" but Carly teased that he was more like \"a friend with benefits.\"  Then Carly got serious and claimed that Janet had cheated on Jack.  Janet denied that, but Carly wanted to know what else Janet would call sleeping with another man behind Jack's back.  Janet still maintained her innocence, but Carly said that Teri had confirmed it; Janet didn't believe that.  Carly said Teri hadn't meant to, but Carly had bluffed her sister, and Teri had fallen for it.\n\n\nJanet was stunned, but she asserted that she was not having an affair since she had only slept with Dusty one time on New Year's Eve when Carly was wrapped up with Jack in a lousy cabin.  Janet called her liaison with Dusty a \"stupid, foolish mistake,\" but Carly said that was baloney.  She said she had seen the two of them kissing at Metro the other day, and Carly demanded that Janet tell Jack the truth, or Carly would tell him herself.\n\n\nThen Carly asked if Janet was only hanging on to Jack in order to have a baby to provide bone marrow for Liberty, and Janet was horrified.  She said she loved Jack because he was her husband.  Carly urged Janet to \"do the right thing\" and let him go, but Janet got in Carly's face and yelled how ironic it was that Carly Tenney was lecturing her on morality.  Carly accused Janet of hiding behind her faith and her daughter's illness, which devastated Janet.  She argued that she was committed to doing whatever it took to save Liberty.\n\n\nCarly snarled that Janet's marriage to Jack had ended the moment she \"hit the sheets with Dusty.\"  Janet told Carly to use the information against her any way she wanted, but she should remember that Janet was \"sitting vigil\" by Liberty's bedside.  Janet said she knew she couldn't stop Carly, and she walked away. Carly let Janet go, and she realized she was right outside Yo's Bar.  She stood there thinking for a moment, and then started to go in, but Jack caught her.  She claimed she was only there to use the restroom, and she promised that she was not going to drink.\n\n\nJack apologized for Janet's blurting out that they were trying to get pregnant, and Carly suggested that he tell Janet that she was premature in her announcement.  Then she asked Jack straight out if he was seriously considering having a child with Janet.  Jack replied that it was hard to find a reason not to.  Carly said that Jack needed to look at all the factors before he committed to such a step, but he said that he had already done that.  He didn't know what else he could do.  He lamented that Brad was not there, but Carly said she knew that Jack would do the right thing, as he always did.\n\n\nJanet walked into Liberty's room and saw her smacking the punching bag.  The girl got a bit dizzy, so Janet told her to stop, and she asked to speak to Dusty outside.  Janet asked Dusty for a favor: he needed to call her before he visited Liberty at the hospital because of Jack's feelings.  Dusty said that Jack didn't care, and Dusty was tired of pretending.  He wanted to be with Janet, but she asked him to stop talking.  Dusty called Jack a \"part-time husband, at best,\" and he promised to be there for Janet because he didn't want to be anywhere else.  He said he needed to know how she really felt, but Janet did not know.  Dusty asked her to let him into her heart so he could help.\n\n\nCarly ended up drinking club soda at the Lakeview bar, and Dusty joined her.  She told him that she knew he had slept with Janet, and that Janet knew that she knew.  Dusty only said, \"Okay,\" but they continued to converse.  Dusty said that he was the solution for Janet, and he hoped that she realized that.  Carly, however, guaranteed that Janet would stick with Jack because of the baby.  Dusty asked, \"What baby?\" and Carly broke the news that Janet and Jack were considering having a baby to get a bone marrow match for Liberty.\n\n\nAt the farm, Jack drank coffee, as Janet returned.  She was in poor spirits, and she said that she was exhausted.  Jack put his arms around her and said, \"Let's do it.\"  When Janet asked what, Jack said, \"The baby.  Let's have one.\"  Janet was ecstatic, and they went upstairs and sat on opposite sides of their bed. Janet said they were about to share the greatest act of love that Jack could give her, and Jack said that after they had started a baby, there would be no turning back.  They began to kiss, and then lay back on the bed. \n\n\n",
