Casey claimed Matt was dealing and wanted revenge for Casey's attempts to frame Elwood. Margo asked Alison if she had any indication that Matt was involved in drugs, but Alison denied it. Casey and Alison got into a shouting match until Margo intervened. She dismissed Alison, who was more than happy to leave. Margo asked her son directly if he was dealing drugs, and Casey was hurt that she even suspected him. She asked for all the details, so Casey told her about the note signed \"M,\" that Luke had found in Elwood's room. He said they were trying to prove Matt was a dealer, so Matt had retaliated by planting pills on Casey. He swore to Margo that the pills were not his, and asked for an hour to try again for proof. Margo agreed, and Casey dashed out as his father arrived home. Margo explained everything to Tom, who wondered why bad things kept happening to Casey. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to the Lakeview to play cards with Henry and Vienna. They found Henry alone in the lobby, getting ready for a game of poker. He told them he had forgotten his wallet, so Vienna had gone to their room to fetch it. Vienna returned shortly, but she was in a rage. She shoved a pamphlet under Henry's nose and screamed, \"How could you?\" Henry realized she had found the literature that he and Brad had collected from the hospital on the vasectomy procedure. It soon became obvious to everyone within earshot why she was upset, when Vienna accused Henry of wanting to \"get neutered.\" Brad added his two cents, and he and Katie got up to leave, but Henry would not let them go. \n\n\nHenry admitted to Vienna that he was wrong in not discussing the issue with her, but he also reminded her who had poked holes in his condoms. Vienna relented, and she and Henry kissed. Brad suggested they get on with the game, so Henry and Vienna sat down as Henry casually mentioned that it was a good thing that he and Brad had not gone through with the surgeries. Katie realized Henry was including Brad in his statement, so Brad quickly claimed he had just gone along to keep Henry company. That, however, stirred up Vienna again. Katie did not believe her husband, so she stood up and walked out. \n\n\nAlison went to Java and met Matt. She told him how Margo had found pills in Casey's backpack, but Casey had protested his innocence. She also said Casey had accused Matt of planting the drugs. Matt laughed and asked what Casey's problem was, but the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. Alison apologized for coming between the two former friends. She also told Matt she thought Margo was fair and would do what was right, even if it involved her own son. She suggested Matt do a preemptive strike and go to the police first before Casey accused him formally. \n\n\nMargo got a search warrant for her own house and instructed the officer to treat her home as he would any other. Tom tried to comfort his wife, who was almost physically ill at the thought of sending her own son back to prison. She wondered why she sometimes hated doing her job. She told Tom she had to bring Casey in, so they left together. \n\n\nCasey found Jade in Old Town and learned she had been unsuccessful in buying drugs from Matt. She also said she might have made some progress if Alison had not arrived and busted her. Casey told Jade that his mother had found a bag of drugs in his backpack, so Jade explained her conversation with Matt in which he told her that setups work both ways. Margo and Tom approached, and Margo told Casey she was taking him in for questioning. Casey asked Tom if he had put Margo up to it, but his dad said he was there because they were a family. Casey groused that it didn't feel much like one to him. \n\n\nBrad came back after following Katie and told Henry and Vienna his wife had just driven away. He couldn't figure out what he had done wrong that had upset her so. Vienna blamed it all on Katie's hormones, but Brad was confused. Vienna got upset, so Brad just bowed out of the game and left. \n\n\nMatt and Alison went to the police station, and he told an officer that someone would be making false accusations against him, and he wanted to make his own statement since he had nothing to hide. Tom, Margo, and Casey came in, and Casey threw a nasty punch at Matt, who returned the favor. Margo calmed everyone, and Matt spoke about Jade's unsuccessful attempt at entrapment of him at Yo's. Margo asked the officer to call Jade and ask her to come in. Casey then admitted he had sent Jade to get proof that Matt was dealing. \n\n\nMatt let it slip that he knew Casey had been caught holding drugs, so Margo asked Alison if she had told that information to Matt. After Alison admitted that, Casey took her aside and asked her to speak for him, since she knew him so well. Matt yelled that Casey wanted him gone because of Matt's interest in Alison, but Alison stated that she had never seen either boy involved with drugs. The officer searching the Hugheses' home returned to the station and handed Margo a baggie containing a large wad of cash. \n\n\nBrad went home and called out for Katie. She did not answer, so Brad went into the bedroom and found his wife collapsed on the floor, unconscious. She came awake groggily, and Brad realized she was bleeding heavily, so he carried her to his car. He took her to Memorial and carried her into a room. The nurse made Brad go outside while she contacted a doctor. Henry and Vienna arrived, worried sick about their friend. \n\n\nThe doctor came out and told Brad that Katie had an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured her Fallopian tubes, and she had lost a great deal of blood. He said she required surgery, and Brad questioned how it could have happened. He was stunned when the doctor answered that the condition was not uncommon among women taking fertility drugs. Brad thought the doctor had made a misdiagnosis until Vienna stepped up and said that Katie had indeed been taking fertility treatments. Brad realized Katie had lied to him about waiting to begin a pregnancy as Dr. Bob had suggested, and he went off by himself to think. \n\n\nHenry was full of questions for Vienna, who assured him that she would never put her health at risk. Henry was just as concerned about what the deception was doing to Brad and Katie's marriage, and he questioned his trust for Vienna. \n\n\nMargo took Casey into an interview room and asked him where he had gotten the cash. Casey said he won the money betting on a horse at the track, his first slip since stopping gambling. Margo was skeptical and heartsick that the evidence pointed so clearly to her son. She decided she had to order a full investigation, so she sent Matt home, and Alison went with him. Jade arrived, and Margo asked if Casey had sent her to buy drugs from Matt. Jade answered that Matt had sold her nothing, but she still thought he was dealing. Margo next inquired if Casey had ever sold her drugs, and Jade was dumbfounded. Then she remembered the message Matt had given her for Casey about how setups went both ways, so she told Margo. Jade defended Casey, and Margo questioned how well she knew her own son. \n\n\nBrad waited for Katie to awaken, and when she did, he told her she had an ectopic pregnancy that almost cost her life. Katie cried and apologized for not telling Brad about the fertility treatments. She promised it would be the last thing she would ever keep from him. Brad forgave her because he loved her so much. \n\n\nJade visited Casey and told him she had told Margo the truth. Casey asked for help, but Jade said she was done with him because he blew her off after their night of lovemaking. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Alison was glum, so Matt tried to cheer her up. She was sad that her relationship with Casey had deteriorated so badly, because they had a long history. Matt said he liked being her friend, and then he kissed her. They kissed again...and again. \n\n\nMargo told Tom she felt terrible for coming down so hard on Casey. She got back the toxicology report on the pills from her son's backpack, and they matched the drugs that had killed Reg. Margo talked a bit more with Casey, and then she arrested him. Jade promised to find a way to help her friend, as Tom tried to comfort his disconsolate wife.\n\n\n",
