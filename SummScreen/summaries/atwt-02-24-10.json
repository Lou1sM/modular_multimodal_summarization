    "soap_central": "\n\n \nPaul and Emily arrived for lunch at Metro, and Emily remarked that a cozy lunch for two was what \"normal married people\" did, but then Henry joined them.  Emily told him to scram, but Henry said that Paul had invited him.  Emily looked at Paul, who explained that in order to achieve the \"normal life\" that Emily so craved, they had to take care of some business first.  Paul told his \"little brother\" that Henry was paying for lunch, but he could well afford it.  \"Dad's blood money is yours,\" Paul said to Henry.  Both Henry and Emily were amazed, so Paul declared that taking the Stenbeck money had led to nothing but trouble for him, so now it was all Henry's.\n\n\nHenry argued that he had been cursed by it, as well:  Vienna was gone, Brad was dead, and Katie was miserable.  Henry did not want the fortune, either, but Paul said it was too late because the money was already in Henry's account.  Paul and Emily said goodbye and left, leaving Henry mopping his sweaty face with his tie and staring at a ridiculously expensive bottle of champagne that he had to pay for.\n\n\nAt Katie's, she watched Reid Oliver devour a giant Dagwood sandwich.  She asked him what the AMA would say about a doctor's eating like that, and, with his mouth crammed full, Reid replied, \"Bon appetit!\"  Katie said that she doubted that, because his lunch was a heart attack waiting to happen.  Reid handed Katie his share of the rent, but she said that he had paid her for two months instead of one.  The good doctor said that was fair since he was not staying in Oakdale much longer.  Katie reminded him that he had to remain until his court hearing, but Reid said that since he had recently saved both Kim and Bob's lives at the wedding from hell, he figured that Dr. Bob would put in a good word for him with Bob's golfing buddy, the judge.\n\n\nKatie got angry and began slamming food back into the refrigerator.  \"Holy codependency!\" shouted Dr. Oliver. \"You don't want me to leave.\"  Katie said she wouldn't miss cleaning up after him, but Reid was surprised that she was not as eager as the rest of Oakdale to get rid of him.  Henry bounded into the room, and he and Reid traded barbs.  Then Henry said that he had very expensive champagne, and he was brimming with news.  He reported that Paul Ryan had wired James Stenbeck's entire fortune into Henry's account.  Katie looked at him and called it \"blood money,\" but Henry assured her that he wasn't keeping it.\n\n\nHenry explained that he was setting up a trust fund for baby Jacob, but Katie refused to even consider it.  Reid piped up and cried, \"Hell, I'll take it!\"  Katie claimed the money was cursed, but Henry swore that if he gave it to someone really deserving, the curse was reversed.  Katie still declined, but Oliver urged her to take it.  Henry was delighted to learn that the doctor would be leaving town soon, and he said farewell as Oliver left for rounds.\n\n\nHenry suggested that he and Katie consider all the \"cool things\" they could do with Reid's room once he left.  Katie said she liked living with Reid because he made Jacob smile.  She also liked the fact that she didn't know him well and that meant they didn't share any painful history.  Katie admitted that Henry reminded her of Brad, and that was hurtful.  She also scolded that the \"old\" Henry would have understood that she couldn't accept the Stenbeck money, but the \"new\" Henry didn't get it.  Henry was hurt, so he grabbed his coat, abandoned his peanut butter and jelly sandwich, without crusts, and stormed out.\n\n\nIn her room at the Lakeview, Barbara was just about finished wrapping a dozen presents.  She ran out of tape, so she searched through her desk drawers for another roll.  Instead, she found the photo Mick had given her of James, Barbara, and a very young Paul.  Barbara had her scissors in her hand already, so she carefully cut James out of the picture.\n\n\nEmily and Paul went home to Fairwinds, and she made her husband rest after their busy morning.  She reminded him that he was still recovering from a gunshot wound to his leg, courtesy of Mick Dante.  Paul said he felt great since the weight of the Stenbeck fortune was off his shoulders.  He and Emily began kissing, as Barbara walked in with her arms full of presents and a huge stuffed panda bear.  She announced that she was attempting to \"lighten the mood,\" and she began passing out presents.  Both Paul and Emily refused them, but Barbara tried to talk Emily into letting her back into their lives.  Emily let her mother-in-law have a verbal barrage, and Paul added that Barbara ought to give her \"peace offerings\" to charity.\n\n\nPaul also told Barbara that he had given James's money to Henry, and Barbara immediately put her coat back on and congratulated her son on finally growing up.  She shouted that she was through \"mothering, smothering, and bailing out\" her son, and she turned to Emily and said, \"He's all yours.\"  Barbara made her exit, and Emily proclaimed that they were without Paul's mother and his father's money, so they were free.  They began kissing until the phone interrupted them.\n\n\nHenry sat in the Lakeview lounge and contemplated his very expensive bottle of bubbly.  Barbara returned from Fairwinds and joined him at his table.  Henry opened the bottle and poured two glasses.  They downed the champagne quickly, and then had more.  Barbara said that she and her son had just agreed to stay out of one another's lives.  She also prattled that she had only befriended Mick Dante so that Paul could have a \"relationship\" with the father he had always hated.  Henry burst out laughing and asked how Barbara could say that with a straight face.  He said Barbara didn't do much that didn't benefit her in some way, and that irritated her.\n\n\nHenry and Barbara finished the champagne and began arguing back and forth.  Their voices got louder until they were hurling insults one after another.  Finally they both yelled, \"You're full of it!\" and made a beeline for Barbara's room.  They ripped off their clothes and Henry carried Barbara to the bed.  With passion spent, they began the insults again, but they did agree on one issue: they were \"ridiculously good at the sex.\"\n\n\nAt Memorial, Dr. Bob called for a nurse, and he got Alison.  It was awkward for both of them, and finally Alison apologized again for how her non-wedding to Casey had gone.  Bob was surprised that Alison was back to work so soon, but she explained that she was going crazy sitting around her mother's house.  Bob asked if that was the real reason, or if it might be that Mick Dante was a patient in the room across the hall.\n\n\nBob took a break and walked through Old Town where he ran into Casey.  His grandson said he was on his way to the hospital because he couldn't bear to stay at home.  Bob mentioned that Alison felt the same way, and he cautioned Casey that Alison was back on duty.  Casey said he wasn't going to the hospital to see her or to work; he was going because he had heard that Mick Dante was not dead yet.  \n\n\nBob reminded his grandson that revenge was not the answer, but Casey said that Mick had terrorized all their loved ones, and Casey was mortified that he had found out on his wedding day that the love of his life was cheating on him.  Bob said that everyone was fine, except perhaps for Alison.  He advised Casey to make sure how he and Alison felt before he closed any doors.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison looked in Mick's room and then went in.  Mick was asleep, so Alison turned to leave, but he called to her.  Alison warned him not to talk since he had just recently been taken off the ventilator.  Mick had pain in his broken ribs, but Alison said she couldn't be his nurse.  She offered to find someone else, but Mick said he wanted her to get him out of there and up to the roof.  \n\n\nMick said that he no longer felt James's presence in his head, and he was convinced that the devil was gone for good.  Alison was skeptical about getting Mick out of the room because of the policeman on guard outside, but Mick said that he wanted to see the sky and smell the air without having James ruin it for him.  Alison was fearful that Mick was pulling another trick, but she decided to trust him, so she promised him a look at the sky.\n\n\nAlison bundled up Mick and got him into a wheelchair.  She put a blanket over him and took a peek outside to look for the cop.  No one was there, so Alison pushed the chair into the hall and headed for the elevator.  They were almost out of sight when Casey walked around the corner and spotted them.  Out on the rooftop, Mick let the sun beat on his face, and he thanked Alison for helping him.  Suddenly Alison heard a noise, and she worried that the police had discovered that her patient was gone.  Alison hid the wheelchair behind some air conditioning equipment, as Casey stepped out on the roof.\n\n\nCasey called out to Alison, so she left Mick and ran out.  She lied and told Casey that she didn't know where Mick was, so Casey screamed at her that she was helping Mick escape.  He was furious that \"the creep\" had opened his eyes and \"sucked\" her back in.  Mick listened to Casey's passionate words, but when Casey grabbed Alison by her arms, Mick wheeled himself out in the open.  He ordered Casey to take his hands off the girl and not to take out his anger on her.  Casey said that Mick should have died when the van hit him, but Mick countered by accusing Casey of wanting to marry Alison to make him a better man.  He chided Casey for not ever considering what Alison might want or need.\n\n\nMick finally declared that Alison deserved better than both of them, and Casey made a move on him.  Alison pushed Casey away and asked to take her patient back to his room.  Instead, Casey pulled out his phone and said he was calling the police.  Mick taunted him by saying Casey couldn't stand the thought that Alison still had feelings for Mick.  Casey closed his phone and told Mick that he deserved to die, and he grabbed the wheelchair and raced straight to the edge of the roof.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Dr. Oliver spotted Dr. Bob looking at a chart, so he popped in and was very sociable.  Bob asked him if he had \"been in a pharmacy\" because he looked \"happy.\"  Reid said he knew that Bob felt he owed Reid something for rescuing Bob and Kim at the \"sham of a wedding.\"  Then he asked Bob to call up his \"golfing buddy,\" the judge, and get him to drop the charges against Reid.  Bob said that Oliver's legal problems were none of his concern, and he wouldn't \"dream of interfering.\"  Dr. Oliver called Bob \"an ungrateful old man,\" but Bob snookered him into reading a chart of a puzzling patient. After reading it, Dr. Oliver declared himself the only neurosurgeon competent enough to do the required surgery, and agreed to perform it.  He also claimed that he had seen right through Bob's trick, but Bob just grinned.\n\n\nNot long afterward, Bob discovered that Mick Dante was missing from his room.  He called Paul to warn him, since Mick had gone after Paul so violently.  Paul retrieved his gun from the safe, but Emily argued that Paul was again looking for trouble, and she began to seduce him.  Finally, Paul replaced the gun in the safe and began kissing his wife.\n\n\nLater that night, Reid helped Katie fold baby clothes, and she was pleased to hear that he was going to be around for a couple of weeks longer.  She told him how she felt, but Reid cautioned her that she didn't know that much about him yet.  Katie looked at him and said, \"So tell me what there is to know.\"\n\n\n",
