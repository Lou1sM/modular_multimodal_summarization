Noah and Ameera explain the precarious nature of their sleeping arrangement because of Ameera's traditional Muslim beliefs that she shouldn't sleep in the same room as a man outside her family. Noah explains that everything was fine once he put a sheet up separating the two from one another. Ameera tells Noah and Luke that once the privacy issue was resolved she slept the best she had in months. She tells them of her relief of being out of a war zone, but reveals that her visa is set to expire and she may have to return home to Iraq. Noah tells Luke he will be skipping class to spend time with Ameera. Once Luke has gone to class, Ameera admits that she is reluctant to go anywhere alone with a man, but believes she has to change from her traditional beliefs if she wants to live in America. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Ameera explains her life in Iraq and her strict upbringing. Noah asks if he and Luke's relationship would be tolerated in Iraq and Ameera says it would not be accepted. Ameera asks if Noah and Luke's families were accepting of their relationship and Noah explains that Luke's family has been, but his own father hates the idea of his relationship with Luke. Ameera is surprised because she believes Noah's dad, Colonel Mayer, is a kind and wonderful man who wouldn't abandon his own son. Ameera explains how kind Colonel Mayer was to her in Iraq and doesn't believe that Noah's father could be so cruel. Noah is reluctant to believe that his father could be so wonderful and tells Ameera how horrible his father was to Luke, and about his father killing his mother. Ameera is sad to learn about Colonel Mayer's crime in the United States and Noah apologizes for upsetting her. Noah admits to Ameera that he is jealous that his father was able to be so kind to her, but couldn't show his own son unconditional love. Luke walks through town and sees the two sharing their deep discussion. \n\n\nMatt and Alison enjoy their first date at Al's Diner as Aaron arrives and is introduce to Alison's new friend. Aaron begins a friendly interrogation of Matt in an attempt to make sure that Alison isn't getting in over her head. Matt excuses himself for a moment and Alison tells Aaron to stop looking after her, but Aaron warns her to be careful. Matt returns and asks Alison and Aaron if there is a problem. Aaron and Alison tell Matt they are fine and Aaron explains he only came by to tell Alison that his mother had relapsed and he was returning to Seattle to care for her for a while. Alison wishes Aaron and his mother well and returns to her breakfast date with Matt. Gray sits at the diner counter and, after she catches Matt looking at Gray, Alison asks Matt if he knows him. Matt denies knowing Gray. \n\n\nMatt and Alison leave the diner and walk through Old Town, where Alison says she must tell Matt about her past as a meth addict and porn star. Matt is accepting of Alison's past and tells her he believes everyone makes mistakes. Since Matt met Casey in jail, it is obvious that he committed crimes in the past, but he doesn't tell Alison the truth about his time in prison. The two end their date with Matt giving Alison a peck on the cheek. \n\n\nAfter their romantic night together, Henry returns to wake up Vienna with breakfast in bed. Once she is awake, Henry tells her she needs to give the diamond necklace back to Gray. Vienna protests, but Henry explains that Gray will want payment for his gift. Vienna reluctantly agrees to return the necklace and tells Henry that Gray phoned and offered to return the diner with no strings attached. Vienna begs Henry to accept Gray's latest gift, but Henry points out that Gray wants Vienna and they should avoid owing Gray anything. Henry tells Vienna that she has to give the necklace back and not accept any other gifts from Gray or she and Henry will be through. \n\n\nVienna arrives at the diner and finds Gray sitting at the counter. She tells him that she can't accept his gift of the diamonds or the diner. Gray asks her to join him for dinner, but Vienna rejects his invitation out of love for Henry.  She does, however, accept his request to have coffee together. As the two are enjoying their coffee together a loud bang rocks the diner. Gray covertly draws a weapon from his jacket and looks around for the source of the noise. Vienna reassures everyone that it was just the furnace backfiring. Gray puts his gun away without anyone noticing and tells Vienna he will have the new owner fix the furnace. Vienna is sad to hear the diner will be sold. Gray invites Vienna to lunch and she agrees to go as long as Henry doesn't have a problem with her doing so. \n\n\nEarlier, Luke, Noah and Ameera headed into the Al's Diner, where Luke asked about their day together. As the blast rocks the diner, Ameera falls to the ground believing a car bomb has detonated. Noah reassures her that he will protect her and takes her home. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Noah and Luke comfort a distressed Ameera who explains loud noises remind her of the bombs that were constantly going off in Iraq. She remembers the terrible death of her cousin's fianc\u00e9 to a suicide bomber and the two men leave her alone to rest. They go outside and discuss that they can't let her return to Iraq. Ameera looks out the kitchen window as the two talk about her future in America. \n\n\nDown at the station, Kit and her lawyer talk to Dallas about the charges pending against her for moving Sam's body out of state for burial. The lawyer defends Kit's actions and threatens a lawsuit against the police if they don't release Kit immediately. Dallas realizes he is fighting a losing battle and calls Jack. \n\n\nJack arrives at Carly's house and Carly frantically tells him that Kit is gone. Jack calms Carly down by explaining that Kit is at the police station being questioned about transporting Sam's body out of state without the proper paperwork. Carly is worried that she and Jack have missed their opportunity to get Kit to admit she shot Sam because of Katie's phone call to Jack during their earlier plan to trick Kit. Jack tries to defend Katie, but Carly will have none of it and continues to hold Katie responsible for their plan failing.

While Brad details his fun time with Bonnie, Katie becomes overwhelmed and begins to cry. Brad asks Katie why she is upset and she refuses to admit that she is jealous of Brad and Bonnie. Katie tells Brad he has everything wrong and that she is really upset over Jack and Parker. Katie explains to Brad how her phone call to Jack ruined his chances of getting Kit to confess, putting Parker's future in jeopardy. Brad explains that Jack will come up with a new plan and tells Katie it isn't her fault. Henry arrives at the station to ask Katie to help him with Vienna, but Brad interrupts Henry before he has a chance to ask. Brad says that he has a plan to get Kit to stay in town longer so Jack and Carly can get her to confess. \n\n\nBrad goes to the station to tell Jack about his plan, but Jack doesn't want to hear it. Brad explains his idea for getting Henry to trick Kit into staying by posing as an investor who is interested in Kit's part of Metro. Jack dismisses Brad's idea and Henry's involvement as ridiculous, but Brad says he thinks his plan will work. \n\n\nKatie arrives at Carly's house and apologizes for calling during Carly and Jack's attempt to get Kit to confess. She tells Carly she wants to help, but Carly tells her to stay away from Parker and her family. Katie says she is going to help regardless of whether or not Carly wants her to and that the plan to get Kit to stay in Oakdale is already underway. Carly lashes out at Katie, accusing her of using Parker to get Jack back. Katie admits she shouldn't have come to Carly's house and leaves after realizing Carly will never be grateful for her help. \n\n\nKit arrives at the Lakeview to get her bags and prepares to leave for the airport. Henry shows up and tells Kit he is an investor looking to buy Metro from her. He asks if he can see Metro and Kit agrees to show him the club and cancels her plans to leave town. Henry tours Metro, as Kit explains Sam's death, but Henry plays the part of an eager investor well and tells Kit he is willing to buy her portion of the club. He says he can't finish the deal until tomorrow and gives Kit a cash deposit to keep her in town longer. He agrees to meet the next day to finalize the deal. \n\n\nBack at the television station, Henry tells Katie that he was able to get Kit to stay in town. She rushes out to the police station to tell Jack the good news. There she finds Carly ranting to Jack and Brad about Katie's ridiculous scheme to get Kit to remain in Oakdale. Brad tells Carly the plan was his and that it will work. Katie shares Henry's success with everyone. \n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Henry finds Vienna trying on clothes. He apologizes for being harsh earlier and wants to know if she returned the necklace to Gray. Vienna explains she did everything Henry asked and made it clear to Gray that she wants nothing to do with anyone but Henry. Vienna and Henry make up from their earlier fight and share a long kiss.\n\n\n",
