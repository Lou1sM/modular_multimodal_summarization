When she did, she immediately apologized to him for losing their baby, and she felt guilty because she knew that could be one of the side effects of taking fertility treatments. She asked Brad to hold her, but he was afraid because she had just undergone surgery. Katie cried and tried to make Brad understand how desperate she was to have his child. He assured her that they would stay in love always, and eventually they would have a family. He made Katie promise she would take no more risks. The doctor came in, and Katie asked when she might try again to get pregnant, but the doctor said he would talk to them about that after he had more test results. He did promise to check her chart, however, and determine when she could go home. The doctor left, and Brad followed him out, and the two of them talked. \n\n\nBarbara held baby Eliza at the farm and successfully put her to sleep. Meg knew that Barbara resented how she had treated Paul, so she tried to explain how she could no longer trust him. Dusty knocked and returned some of Meg's things she had left at his place. He refused to come in and left quickly. Barbara commented that Dusty was not very friendly, and Meg said he didn't understand that she didn't need his help any longer. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul awoke from a nap on the couch to find an attractive woman standing over him. She called herself, \"Ashley,\" and gave him a warm kiss. They had sex on the couch, and a shocked Barbara walked in on them. She asked Ashley who she was, and Ashley told Barbara she looked way too good to be Paul's mother. Barbara realized that Ashley was a \"working girl,\" and Barbara appeared disgusted with Paul. Paul told his mother if she was so displeased with his lifestyle, she could leave. Barbara told Paul she had just come from the farm and gave him the news that Meg and Dusty were definitely not together. Paul claimed to have no interest in that, but Barbara hinted that perhaps Paul could still get his family back. Paul ushered her out and then returned to tell Ashley to get dressed. \n\n\nCarly was vacuuming at home when Craig appeared at her door. She told him she had no time for him, but he came in anyway. He told her to lose the vacuum and go put on her best dress, because that night was the launch party for Midnight Sun Vodka. He gave her three hours to get everything set up at Metro. He was eager to know what she would be wearing, but Carly refused to participate. They argued, and Craig demanded Carly show up at the party even if she was wearing nothing but a smile. He had buyers coming from a convention in Chicago, and they could not afford to miss the opportunity to introduce their designer vodka. \n\n\nCraig encouraged Carly to look the part and forked out a wad of cash for her to buy a new dress. Carly said no, but just then Craig got a call from Johnny's babysitter. She said she had to leave early because of an emergency in her own family, so Craig promised to come home to watch his son. He implored Carly to handle the launch, since he had to tend to Johnny. Parker came in, and Craig began to schmooze him by saying how well the boy learned from his mistakes and how responsible he had become. Craig announced he had found his babysitter for Johnny, but Carly nixed the idea. Parker really wanted the job, and Craig pushed harder, so Carly gave in. Craig apologized again for not giving her time to create her own spectacular design, but he was sure Carly could find something suitable. She took the money, and Craig left with Parker. \n\n\nMeg went to Dusty's room at the Lakeview and told him they didn't have enough friends. Dusty said he thought Meg did not want him in her life, but she clarified by saying that she just didn't want him running her life. She wanted them to be friends, and she invited him to lunch. \n\n\nBrad returned to Katie's hospital room, and Katie assumed he had bad news for her because she had seen him conferring with the doctor. When she pressed the issue, Brad said they would talk about that later, and he handed her some clothes Vienna had brought for Katie to wear home. Katie would not be distracted, however, and she insisted Brad tell her what the doctor had said. He reluctantly said the doctor had removed Katie's ruptured Fallopian tube, and Katie interrupted by reminding him she had another tube, and she only needed one. Brad sadly told her that her remaining tube had so much scar tissue that there was virtually no chance she could ever get pregnant. Furthermore, if she did manage to conceive, it was doubtful she could carry a baby to term. Katie was devastated that she would never have a baby with Brad, and she dissolved into tears. Brad reminded her there were many ways to be a parent, but first they had to concentrate on getting Katie well. \n\n\nVienna arrived with a lovely bouquet for Katie, and the two friends talked. Katie was stunned when Vienna suddenly offered to carry a baby for Brad and Katie. She felt responsible for not telling Brad that Katie was trying to get pregnant against the doctors' orders and perhaps preventing Katie's medical problems. Katie told Vienna not to feel guilty, and assured her she did not have to be a surrogate to make up for it. Vienna said that Katie would be helping her because that way Vienna could experience pregnancy and childbirth without losing Henry. \n\n\nBrad came in and was pleased to see Katie sitting up. She told Brad how much she loved him, and he asked Vienna what she had done to make his wife smile again. Katie winked at Vienna and told Brad she wanted to go home. They drove home, and Brad was amazed that Katie was upbeat and no longer depressed. \n\n\nCarly bought a dress at Fashions, and Barbara walked in. She asked what Carly's special occasion was, so Carly told her she was launching a new business venture. Barbara sarcastically asked her if she was \"taking another stab at making a buck.\" Carly explained that she was launching a designer vodka, and she handed over the cash to pay for the dress. Barbara shrewdly surmised that Carly was working with someone, and asked who her partner was. She laughed out loud when Carly told her it was Craig, and then she chewed out Carly for her poor judgment in getting involved with Craig in any way. She predicted Carly's venture would end in shambles, but Carly did not back down, and took the dress. \n\n\nDusty and Meg were surprised when Craig, Parker, and Johnny walked into the Lakeview lobby. Johnny ran to hug his \"other dad,\" Dusty, and Meg was amazed to see Paul, with the stunning Ashley on his arm, promenade past them. They sat nearby, so Parker approached Paul. Ashley asked to be introduced to Parker, but instead, Paul dismissed the girl. Craig called Parker away, and they and Johnny exited. \n\n\nPaul was leaving the lobby when Barbara swooped in and grabbed him. He was feeling good that Meg had seen him with his beautiful companion, and he was hopeful his ex-wife was jealous. Meanwhile, Meg told Dusty her plan was to raise her daughter and get over Paul. Dusty said he felt at a loss without Johnny to care for anymore, and Meg hugged him. Meg left the lounge, and Dusty discovered Johnny had dropped one of his toys on the floor. \n\n\nAt Metro, an elegant-looking Carly was setting up when Craig arrived. He was not dressed for the launch yet, but he was bearing cases of vodka to serve the prospective buyers. He left to get dressed, as Carly poured herself a sample shot. She began to get nervous, so she had some more \"samples.\" She called Craig and told him to \"get his butt in gear,\" and he promised he was on his way. Carly greeted her first visitors and poured them all shots of vodka. She joined them in celebrating her new company. \n\n\nCraig was leaving his hotel room when a visitor knocked. He opened the door and said, \"You have a lot of nerve showing up here.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie and Brad work through their issues about how she lied to him and risked her life to try to get pregnant, but then Katie learns some bad news from Brad. There was damage done during the Ectopic pregnancy and ensuing surgery; the likelihood of her getting pregnant or carrying to term is almost impossible. Katie is devastated and blames herself for ruining their dreams. Brad tries to comfort her to no avail. When Vienna visits, she makes a startling and generous suggestion \u0096 she would like to be the surrogate for her and Brad so she can still have a baby. Katie isn't sure how to feel, but she is elated by the offer and seems to break out of her funk. Katie and Vienna keep it to themselves until Katie knows how she feels. Katie is able to go home, as her outlook has much improved about how things are in her life. Barbara visits with Eliza (and Meg) and notices the tension between Meg and Dusty when he drops off her belongings. Meg explains he might be hurt that she wants to do this on her own. Barbara races over to tell Paul the news, but she finds him otherwise engaged \u0096 with a \u0091professional'. Paul pretends he doesn't care about the news, but after Barbara leaves, he decides to take Ashley out in public. Meg visits Dusty and asks him out to lunch because she wants to be friends still and thinks it would benefit them both to hang out regularly and do lunch. Dusty finally agrees. Craig stuns Carly when he tells her the Midnight Sun vodka launch party is that night at Metro. Carly is angry at first, but Craig turns on the charm and soon she is on board. Craig almost has to back out him self in the end though when his babysitter can't look after Johnny so he convinces Carly to let Parker step in. Barbara chides Carly for her news that she is going into business with Craig. Barbara tries to warn her by reminding Carly of all Craig has done, but Carly doesn't change her mind. Dusty sees Johnny, as they get to briefly hang out, which is at the same time, Paul strolls in with Ashley on his arm. Meg can't help but stare. Paul doesn't stay with Ashley long, but when he approaches Meg to ask about Eliza, Meg can't help but ask about Ashley. Paul tries to play it off as to why she would care since they are no longer married. After Paul leaves, Meg tells Dusty she will get over Paul and raise her daughter on her own. Paul is thrilled to tell Barbara that Meg was jealous and that is all he needed to see. Carly is nervous about the party, as Craig drops off some vodka to pass off to the investors. Craig calms her nerves and promises that he has her back. The investors arrive at Metro before Craig is back so Carly starts to pour glasses of vodka for them to try. Craig is headed to the launch party when there is a knock and he opens the door; he looks annoyed at who is standing in front of him, as he thinks the person has nerve to show up back there.",
