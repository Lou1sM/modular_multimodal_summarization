    "soap_central": "\n\n \nOn the hospital roof, Alison ran after Casey, who was pushing Mick Dante in a wheelchair to the edge of the roof at full speed.  Mick thrust out his leg against the low wall on the edge and stopped his forward motion.  Casey yelled that he was finishing what he had started, while Mick taunted him and told him to \"do it.\"\n\n\nCasey demanded to know if the \"psychopath\" was the guy Alison wanted to be with, but she pleaded with him to let Mick go.  Casey told her to answer the question, so an agonized Alison said that she didn't love Mick because she was still in love with Casey.\n\n\nMick encouraged Casey to shove him to the pavement because that beat \"spending 20 years in a cell.\" Casey yanked the wheelchair away from the edge, and he got in Mick's face to shout that he knew prison was worse than dying.  He said he wanted to make sure that Mick spent every miserable day there for the rest of his life.  Mick swung and punched Casey in the face, and Casey fell back and cut his hand badly on something on the roof.  Alison ran to Casey to help him, as Mick wheeled himself away and across the roof.\n\n\nAlison said to forget Mick because he couldn't get off the roof, and she insisted that she help Casey downstairs for medical treatment.  Alison put Casey in an exam room and hurriedly checked her messages.  She saw that Dr. Bob had already alerted the police and the staff that Mick was loose, so she concentrated on Casey's wound.  She cleaned it as well as possible, but she told him that he needed stitches and a tetanus shot.  Alison also chewed Casey out for putting her on the spot by asking her whom she loved.  They talked about whether either one of them had been ready for marriage, and Casey apologized for springing his proposal on her.  He also admitted that he still loved her.\n\n\nAlison left to send a doctor to Casey, and then she went into the hospital stairwell and found Mick Dante sitting there.  He asked if she was going to call the cops, but Alison said that the police were already on their way.  She recommended that Mick turn himself in, and she was hopeful that he would receive medical help rather than a prison term. She offered to help in any way she could, and Mick said he was sorry that he had hurt her.  He was also thankful that James was dead inside him.  A police officer arrived with gun drawn, and Mick gave up peaceably.  They left Alison in tears on the stairs.\n\n\nThe doctor finished stitching up Casey's hand, as Tom showed up at Memorial looking for his father.  He noticed his son's bandaged hand, and Casey explained that he'd gotten into fight with a \"guy in a wheelchair.\"  He said that Alison was all right, however, and had said she was still in love with him.  Tom was encouraged that the young people could work things out when he learned that Casey still loved Alison, too.  Tom remarked what a different person Casey was from the punk who had committed earlier crimes.  He suggested that they work on getting Casey's record expunged so that Casey would not have to explain anything on his law school applications.  Casey was pleased that his dad had renewed faith in him.\n\n\nLater, Alison surprised Casey at home alone, and she told him that the police had taken Mick for a psych evaluation at Margo's suggestion.  Alison noticed that Casey was reading \"Law School for Dummies,\" and she encouraged him to go for it.  Casey asked if she thought he was a lost cause, but Alison was very supportive.\n\n\nAt the police station, Tom spoke with Holden and Molly about the Maltese authorities' request for Holden's extradition.  He was hopeful that since Holden had committed the alleged act in the United States, any federal judge would rule that Malta had no jurisdiction over him.  Molly was upset and said that she could not sit quietly by while the wheels of justice ground to a halt.  Holden asked her to arrange for Lily to visit him as soon as possible, and then Tom told them that he would speak with the US Attorney who would be arguing for the government at the hearing.  Molly offered to \"dig up some dirt\" on him, but Tom preferred to talk to him first.  Tom left, and Holden again urged Molly to find Lily so that he could work out arrangements if he had to go to Malta.  Molly hugged him and promised not to give up.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Luke explained to Lily that Dr. Oliver had said that there was no way the body in the Maltese report could be Damian.  He began looking for Oliver, but the doctor was in consultation with a patient.  The patient, Jillian, was the one Bob had tricked Reid into agreeing to operate on earlier, and Reid told her immodestly that he was the only neurosurgeon around who could give her a shot at not being in a vegetative state for the rest of her life.  Luke saw Dr. Oliver in the exam room, and he opened the door and apologized for interrupting.  Oliver turned to Luke and told him to \"get lost.\"  Luke was upset at the brush-off, but Lily said she was sure Dr. Oliver would speak with them when he was finished with his consult.\n\n\nReid Oliver exited the room and threatened that if Luke ever interrupted one of his conferences again, he would let Noah stay blind forever.  Lily challenged Oliver's attitude and asked him to please explain why the Maltese body could not be her husband.  They all started to move into the exam room, but Molly caught up with Lily and gave her Holden's message that he needed to see her right away.  Lily was shocked when Molly said the Maltese government wanted to extradite Holden immediately, and she agreed to go to the police station.\n\n\nIn the room, Luke explained to Reid that Holden would be on his way to Malta unless Dr. Oliver explained in court what he had seen in the autopsy report and photos.  Luke begged Reid to go right away to the police station, but Dr. Oliver said he had patients to see.  Luke railed at Reid that Luke could lose both his fathers because of the doctor's stubbornness, and he stormed out.\n\n\nAt the station, Tom argued to the US Attorney that Malta had no jurisdiction in the case, and Molly and Lily barged in.  Holden asked for time alone with Lily, so Tom took the federal attorney outside \"to explain all the ways he was violating the Constitution of the United States.\"  Holden thanked Lily for helping, and she told him that the body in the Maltese photo could not be Damian because it had shown signs of advanced Huntington's disease.  Luke joined them and he was discouraged that Dr. Oliver was \"too busy\" to put in an appearance.  He also explained that the doctor was a \"selfish, self-absorbed little jerk,\" because he wouldn't give a statement to the police.\n\n\nTom walked in and gave them all the news that the US Attorney was going strictly by the book and had found a judge who was probably willing to grant the extradition order.  Holden went out to calm down Molly, who was shouting at full voice at the federal attorney.  Luke told Tom what Dr. Oliver had discovered about the photos, as Molly rejoined them and promised to find an even better neurologist that Reid Oliver.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Reid dictated notes from Jillian's case and then picked up the autopsy file that Luke had left on his desk.  He asked himself why he even bothered to be concerned about a \"Maltese corpse.\"  Noah arrived, and they discussed when it would be appropriate to do his actual surgery.  Dr. Oliver was distracted, however, and Noah questioned him about it.  Reid said that, once again, it was Noah's boyfriend who was the cause of his consternation.  Noah asked him to cut Luke some slack because Luke's birth father had just died, but Oliver said that was \"open to interpretation.\"\n\n\n He told Noah what he had seen in the autopsy and photos, and unless Damian Grimaldi was physically and mentally incapacitated before he died, the dead man in Malta was not Luke's father. Noah could not believe that Oliver had blown off Luke's request to make a statement to the police.  Reid claimed his job was to \"help sick people, not wrongly accused people.\"  Noah blasted him about his arrogance until Oliver declared that they were done, and he walked out on Noah.\n\n\nThe mood was glum at the police station until Dr. Oliver walked in.  Luke was greatly relieved as the doctor began to explain why the body could not be that of Damian Grimaldi.  Tom suggested that Oliver call his father to confirm that, and Oliver asked who that was.  Tom said he was Dr. Bob Hughes's son, and Oliver, in his typical cavalier manner, said that he had forgotten more neurology than Dr. Bob ever knew, but he also agreed to do it.  \n\n\nTom left to talk to his dad, as Molly hugged Holden.  Luke thanked Dr. Oliver and acknowledged that he \"owed him.\"  Reid said he knew exactly how Luke could pay him back: Luke could tell the judge at Oliver's hearing that the doctor had not stolen his car, only \"borrowed it.\"  Luke refused to lie, but Oliver promised that he would take care of Noah's surgery no matter where he was practicing.\n\n\nThe US Attorney returned and announced that he was not dropping the extradition charges against Holden, and Molly had a tantrum.  She screamed at him and followed him out like a woman possessed.  Holden wanted to be helpful, but he felt even more urgency to speak with Lily and Luke while he still had time.  Lily was panicky that Holden was so worried, and he made it clear that Lily knew that he did not want the children to ever see him in a Maltese prison.  He also asked her to remind the kids every day that he loved them.\n\n\nMolly raced to the WOAK studio and told her supervisor that she had \"breaking news\" and needed to \"go live\" right away.  She said that Kim Hughes had okayed her copy, so the crew put Molly on a set.\n\n\nAn officer walked into the interrogation room and told Holden that it was time for him to go to the courthouse for his extradition hearing.  Luke was pleased to see that Dr. Oliver was still in the station and that he was prepared to go to the hearing to testify to the medical evidence.  Oliver, however, was glued to the television set in the station, and he mentioned that he doubted that he would need to testify after all.  Everyone stopped to look and listen, as Molly began her broadcast by saying that WOAK had just learned that the United States government was planning to send a US citizen to stand trial in a foreign country for a murder that might not have even happened.  She gave details, including mention of available testimony by Dr. Reid Oliver, and cited the clear violation of Holden Snyder's right to due process.\n\n\nThe US Attorney then took a call on his cell phone from the Attorney General, as Molly promised later updates.  She signed off, and her supervisor informed her that the network had asked for the feed for the national nightly news.\n\n\nTom arrived with the news that the Attorney General had suspended the extradition hearing pending an investigation, so Holden was all right for the moment.  Lily hugged him, and Luke thanked Reid for his help.  The good doctor said he would soon be collecting his due from Luke, and he also asked Luke where he supposed Damian really was.\n\n\nSomewhere in an ornate office, a very much alive Damian Grimaldi received a text saying EXTRADITION HEARING POSTPONED, and he hurled his phone across the room and knocked everything off his deck in a fit of temper.\n\n\n",
