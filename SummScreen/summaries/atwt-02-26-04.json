Jennifer was bored and wanted something constructive to do. Barbara told her to go out and get something to eat. After Jennifer told her mother to settle down, Barbara decided to take Jennifer out to dinner instead. \n\n\nMeanwhile, over at Paul's, Carly and Paul were toasting Barbara's downfall from BRO.  They started talking about a name change. Paul thought of a something simple like \"Carly.\"  Carly was impressed, and as they were drinking a toast, there was a knock at the door. It was Lucy, who told Paul that she didn't know where else to go. Paul was very understanding and sympathetic. \n\n\nPaul truly understood what Lucy was going through, and they shared a wonderful conversation. She confided in Paul that it was very hard to have everyone do and say everything for her. Paul told her that she shouldn't let people do that to her and that she should make some noise and let everyone know what Lucy Montgomery was made of.  Paul told Lucy she was welcome anytime, and Lucy asked him if she could spend the night.\n\n\nLucinda, Craig, and Lucy were at the police station. Craig was telling Lucy that he would do anything to protect her. Lucy wasn't buying any of it. One minute Craig was trying to get Aaron out of her life, and the next, he was Aaron's best friend. Lucy told her father he couldn't be trusted and walked out.  Lucinda tried to tell Craig that there was more going on with Lucy than the attempted rape. \n\n\nLucy was very upset about losing Rosanna and Cabot. Craig tried to leave, but Lucinda stopped him and told him to give Lucy some time. Craig tried to call Lucy several times, to no avail. He suspected that she had gone to Paul's, but Lucinda told him to leave it alone. Lucy would return when she was ready. \n\n\nCarly went into the station and was writing a note to Jack while Craig was looking over her shoulder. He started to question her about her secret, but Carly promptly told him to mind his own business and left.  Carly went to BRO and was fantasizing about her success when Barbara entered and started taunting her. Barbara said that there was no way Carly could be a threat to her, but Carly said she already was.\n\n\nAaron, Jack, and Chris were trying to find out where Clark had taken Alison. Chris told Aaron that Clark was dangerous, and Chris was holding him responsible if anything happened to Alison.  Chris was about to leave to go searching for Alison, but Jack asked him what he thought he was going to do if he found her. Jack found the camera, and Aaron told him that everything that had gone down was on tape. Holden said to Aaron that every time Aaron tried to take the law into his own hands, something went wrong, and he didn't blame Chris for being mad at Aaron. \n\n\nIn the car, Clarke told Alison that she was about to have the best time of her life. Alison pretended to fall asleep and took out her phone to call Chris. Alison tried to get Clark to tell her where they were going, and just as he did, the phone went dead. Chris heard and told Jack that he knew where they were going and said he had to get there first. Jack got it out of him that they were going to the Old Mill, so he had a squad car go out there. \n\n\nClark got Alison into the room and started to rape her when Chris barged in and knocked Clark out.  Clark awoke and knocked Chris out. He said to Alison, \"Now, where were we?\" \n\n\n",
