Jack asked Henry to wear a wire so that they could tape his conversation with Kit. Henry then went to Metro to meet with Kit. Kit thought Henry was going to buy her share of Metro, but Henry told her he had just found out that her co-owner was Carly Tenney. He told Kit he couldn't do business with Carly. \n\n\nKit asked Henry why he didn't want to do business with Carly, and Henry told her Carly had broken up his marriage because she couldn't keep her hands off of him. Kit sympathized and told Henry Carly had tried to steal her man from her. Henry told Kit that Carly could \"drive an innocent person to murder,\" and Kit agreed. However, Kit became frustrated and told Henry it appeared their deal was off. Henry told her he would step outside and call Carly to discuss it. Outside Metro, Henry climbed into the van where Jack and Carly were monitoring the wiretapped conversation. Jack told Henry to tell Kit that Carly had agreed to give Kit her half of Metro free and clear to do with as she pleased. Carly said Kit would never buy that, but Jack said Henry could make it sound believable. \n\n\nHenry went back into Metro and told Kit that Carly had agreed to give up her share of Metro, either because she felt guilty about how she had treated Henry or about how she'd treated Kit. He told Kit that Carly sounded like she owed Kit \"big time,\" and Kit agreed that was true. Kit then said, \"I wouldn't have done what I did if it weren't for Carly.\" Henry asked what it was that Kit had done, but Kit changed the subject, asking when Henry could have the money for the purchase of Metro. Henry said it would take him another day to get the additional cash to buy Carly's half of the business, too, and Kit agreed to wait one more day. \n\n\nJack and Carly took the tape of Kit's conversation to the police station and played it for Margo. Margo told them there wasn't anything incriminating on the tape, and she scolded Jack for using police equipment for an unauthorized wiretap. Margo told Jack he shouldn't be anywhere near the investigation into Sam's murder, given his relationship to Parker, so Jack told Margo, \"Well, in that case, I quit!\" He threw down his badge, and he and Carly returned to Carly's house. Carly asked Jack if he was sure they could come up with a way to save Parker. Jack said there wasn't a doubt in his mind, then he hugged Carly. \n\n\nMatt ran into Gray Girard in the lobby of the Lakeview and questioned the wisdom of Gray putting in appearances at places like Al's Diner. Gray told Matt that he was the one calling the shots, not Matt. Vienna arrived in the lobby to meet Gray, and Gray told her he had champagne waiting for them. \n\n\nVienna and Gray sat down at their table and began drinking and talking. Vienna told Gray that they were just friends, but Gray said he didn't want to sleep with most of his friends. Gray then told Vienna that friends go places together, and he offered to take her and Henry on a trip around the world, beginning on his yacht. Gray offered Vienna a pair of diamond earrings. Vienna drank so much champagne that she became quite drunk. Gray took her upstairs to her suite, where she stumbled around while trying to open her hotel room door. As Vienna stumbled into his arms, Gray embraced her and kissed her, and she kissed him back. Henry walked up at that moment and saw them kissing. \n\n\nBonnie arrived at Will and Gwen's house and told them the judge was going to give them his decision about the custody of baby Hallie in one hour. Gwen called Barbara to let her know. Barbara was at the hospital for her first radiation treatment, but she told Gwen she'd meet them at the courthouse. Barbara then told the nurse she'd have to reschedule the treatment because something very important had come up. \n\n\nSofie received a call from her lawyer saying the judge was ready to render his decision in the hearing. Chris knocked on the door of Sofie's suite at the Lakeview, and when Sofie told him where she was going, he offered to take her to the courthouse. \n\n\nAlison ran into Matt at the courthouse. Alison told him she was there to find out the outcome of the custody hearing, and Matt said he was there to deliver something for Margo. They sat down outside the courtroom to await the verdict. \n\n\nThe judge called the courtroom to order and announced his decision: he awarded custody to Gwen and Will. Sofie stood up and told Gwen and Will how sorry she was that she scared them when she took Hallie to New York without telling them. Sofie said Hallie was a part of her, and she wanted Hallie to always know that, because \"even if I can't raise her, she's the only family I've got.\" Sofie ran out of the courtroom, followed by Chris and her lawyer. \n\n\nGwen, Will, and Barbara left the courtroom and found Alison waiting in the hallway with Matt. They announced their good news, but Gwen felt sad for Sofie. Will said despite any sad feelings they might have for Sofie, this was a cause for celebration for them, and he invited everyone to join them for an impromptu party. Alison introduced Matt as a friend of Casey's and asked if he could come; Will agreed and asked Alison to also invite Casey. Barbara told Will and Gwen that she had an appointment and couldn't come to the party. \n\n\nChris took Sofie to the hospital to talk. Sofie thanked him for being there for her but said that nothing he could say would make things better. Chris received a page and had to leave, but he asked Sofie to wait for him. Barbara saw Sofie and approached her to apologize for having tried to talk Sofie into giving up her baby originally, but she also told Sofie it had worked out for the best for Hallie. The radiology nurse walked up and told Barbara they had been able to reschedule her radiation treatment. Sofie realized this meant that Barbara had cancer, and Barbara asked Sofie not to say anything to Will and Gwen. \n\n\nCasey, Matt, and Alison arrived at Will and Gwen's house, where Matt met baby Hallie for the first time. Gwen convinced Matt to hold the baby, as Casey glared at him from across the room. Casey soon announced that he and Matt had to get back to work. Alison went outside with Matt and thanked him for getting Casey to agree to come to the party, then she kissed Matt on the cheek as Casey watched. \n\n\nWhen Casey and Matt returned to the Lakeview, Matt asked Casey why he was so upset. Casey said Matt was moving in on all of his friends. Matt told Casey that Casey's life was almost perfect and that he'd never had anything like that, but if it made Casey so uncomfortable, he would leave. Casey told Matt he didn't want him to leave and said things were cool between them. \n\n\nMargo visited Paul at the hospital. Paul had called her several times about his \"accident.\" Paul accused Margo of deliberately trying to avoid tracking down Craig to charge him with attempted murder. Margo told Paul she had other cases and that Parker's case was her priority. Paul asked how Parker was, and Margo told him she hoped Parker would be okay. Paul then asked Margo to move his case up on her priority list, but Margo suggested Paul show some patience and stop obsessing about Craig. \n\n\nAt the farm, Parker saw a newspaper with an article about Paul's car explosion. He asked Meg if she would take him to the hospital to see Paul. Meg agreed, and they went to visit Paul. Paul was happy to see Parker and even happier when he saw Meg. Parker asked who had done this to Paul, and Paul said it was an accident. Parker insisted it was obvious someone had tried to kill Paul, but Paul said it didn't matter who it was. Paul said it was partly his own fault for having let things get completely out of hand. Paul then told Parker he'd heard about his legal problems, and Paul said that Jack and Carly would fight for Parker until the end. \n\n\nMeg asked Parker to wait outside for a minute, and then she thanked Paul for telling Parker what he needed to hear. She said she hadn't missed Paul's hidden message for her, that he was trying to give up his obsession for Craig, but she told Paul that it was too late for them. Meg took Parker back to the farm. \n\n\nSofie saw Meg and Parker leave Paul's room and went in to visit him herself. She told Paul the outcome of the hearing and burst into tears. Paul tried to make her feel better, and Sofie laid her head on Paul's shoulder. \n\n\n",
