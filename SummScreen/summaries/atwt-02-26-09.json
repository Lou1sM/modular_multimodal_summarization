She joined them in their drinking, all the while wondering why Craig had not shown up. She finally called him but was disappointed to get his voicemail. She left him a desperate message telling him to get there to give his sales pitch. The buyers lined up for more shots of vodka. \n\n\nCraig's unexpected visitor turned out to be his daughter, Lucy. He was bitter and told her he would not believe a word she said. Lucy asked immediately about Johnny's welfare, so Craig told her the boy was thriving under his care. Lucy knew that her father had custody of his son, and she claimed she wanted to make peace with Craig. She was even ready to try to be a family again, if he was willing. Craig said that was tempting, but he wasn't sure how he could deal with the fact that Lucy had kidnapped his son and kept him for years. He said he considered phoning the police immediately, but Lucy reminded him that she was still his daughter. She mentioned that he had arranged for her kidnapping at one time, and she had declined to press charges. She asked him to return the favor, so Craig agreed to take Lucy to the Oakdale Police Station to see if they could get the charges against her dropped. He said they had to hurry, however, because he had somewhere he had to be. \n\n\nJanet and Jack smooched in the kitchen at the farm as they waited for Sage to come downstairs. They were headed to a movie, and when Sage walked in on the kissers, she was grossed out. Jack took a call from work that necessitated his going back to the station, but Janet did not mind taking Sage alone. Jack mentioned that the work emergency had something to do with Craig, and he promised Sage he would make it up to her. \n\n\nLiberty found Parker and Johnny eating at Al's. She joined them, and Parker inquired how Katie was faring. Liberty said Katie was home, and then she suggested they see a movie, but Parker thought Johnny was a little young for the shows playing in town. Johnny realized he had lost the toy train car that Dusty had picked up in the Lakeview, just as his \"other dad\" walked in. Johnny ran to Dusty and gave him a big hug, and Dusty asked Parker for a special favor. He requested some alone time with his boy. \n\n\nParker said he couldn't do that because \"Craig would have a fit,\" but Dusty pled his case and reminded Parker that his sister, Jennifer, had wanted Dusty to raise the boy. He also suggested Craig would never have to know, but in case that did happen, Dusty was willing to take total responsibility. Parker agreed to let Dusty take the boy for a couple of hours, and they agreed to meet back at the diner. Parker and Liberty left for the movie, while Dusty and Johnny ordered ice cream. Liberty said that Craig would kill Parker if he found out Parker had let Johnny go with Dusty, but Parker thought his sister would have approved. \n\n\nAt the police station, Jack walked in and was shocked to see Lucy with Craig. He reminded them there were still charges pending against her, so Craig explained that Lucy wanted bygones to be bygones, but after reflection, he thought his daughter should face the consequences of her actions. He shocked Lucy by announcing that he was turning her in and wanted her arrested. She couldn't believe he had double-crossed her, but for Craig, it was all about payback. Craig told Jack to do what he had to do, and he attempted to leave. Jack stopped him and requested a formal statement, but Craig said he was expected at a business function, but he would stop in the next day and give a statement -- if he had time. Jack suggested that Lucy write a confession, but the girl refused. \n\n\nAt Metro, the buyers told Carly that it looked as if her partner had stood her up, but Carly denied that. She kept the vodka coming, and she kept pace with the men. She began to feel woozy and asked for the Russian translation of \"I think I'm going to vomit,\" before making a dash to the ladies' room. \n\n\nIn the movie theater, Parker and Liberty were kissing in the back row when Janet and Sage walked in and spotted them. Janet particularly noticed that Parker's hand was engaged in unbuttoning her daughter's blouse. She covered Sage's eyes and yelled at the teens. She warned Parked that if he wanted to keep that hand attached to his arm, he had better move it. Liberty protested that they were only watching the show, but her mother accused them of checking out each other's tonsils. Janet wondered why Johnny was not with them, but Sage spoke up that the movie was rated PG-13, and Johnny was too young to see it. Janet realized she had picked a bad movie for Sage, as well. As Parker and Liberty got up to leave, Janet continued to read them the riot act and warned them that if they messed up again, they would be grounded until they turned age 40. She took one look at what was on the screen and hustled Sage out. \n\n\nCarly returned to the bar to find it empty. She was horrified to see how much vodka she and the buyers had consumed, and was furious that Craig had never arrived. She nodded off on the bar. \n\n\nCraig went to Al's and saw Johnny eating ice cream with Dusty. He challenged Dusty for being with his son and accused Parker of being involved. Then Craig took it one step further and declared Dusty had brought Lucy back to town so the two of them could run away with Johnny. Dusty was surprised that Lucy was in town and said he had never expected to see her again. Craig told Dusty he had turned his daughter in to the police, so Dusty kissed Johnny goodbye and left. \n\n\nCraig called Carly, who was still at Metro and very drunk. She told him to go to hell and never come back. She hung up on him and then cursed him before she had to make another run to the rest room. \n\n\nParker and Liberty arrived at the diner, but could not find Johnny and Dusty. Parker was worried and said they had to find the boy before Craig did. They left to go back to the Lakeview to see if Johnny was there with Dusty. \n\n\nJack told Lucy that she needed to cooperate. He left her unattended for a moment, and Dusty walked in. He asked Lucy why she had returned, so she told him she missed Johnny so much she couldn't stand it. Lucy confided that Dusty might be her only chance to get out of there, so when Jack returned, Dusty told him that Lucy was not guilty of kidnapping. He said that when she took Johnny, the boy was legally in his custody, and he had requested that Lucy take the boy and disappear. Jack did not believe him, because he remembered what a mess Dusty had been when the child disappeared. Lucy backed him up, however, so Jack threw them both out, but told Lucy not to leave town. \n\n\nJanet took Sage home and found Carly semi-conscious on her couch. She asked if Carly was drunk, and then she realized how bad Carly really was. She ran interference with Sage, who went upstairs to bed. Carly passed out, but Janet revived her by slapping her face several times. Carly claimed she had \"gotten the flu,\" but Janet knew drunk when she saw it. \n\n\nCarly was still angry at Craig, the no-show, and Janet said she hoped Carly had not puked on anyone. Carly couldn't remember, so Janet attempted to get her to move and led her to the kitchen for some water. Carly got saccharine and called Janet \"the salt of the earth\" for helping her. Then she delivered two bear hugs that nearly suffocated Janet. After Carly tried to get into the sink, Janet suggested she try the shower upstairs instead. Janet implored Holy Mary to give her guidance. \n\n\nCraig went to Metro but found it deserted except for the empty vodka bottles. He took Johnny back to the hotel where he arranged for a sitter for the boy for a few minutes. They waited for an elevator, and who should get out but Liberty and Parker. Craig was angry and sent Johnny to get a lollypop while he lambasted Parker for letting Dusty spend time with the boy. Parker answered that Jennifer had wanted Dusty to raise her son, but Craig yelled that the courts had made a ruling about that. He told the teens to get out of his sight. \n\n\nLucy thanked Dusty, who was wishing he could see Craig's face when he realized Lucy was free. She asked him why he had lied to the cops for her, and he answered that it was for Johnny's benefit, because the boy missed Lucy desperately. He said he wanted to be able to see Johnny on a regular basis, and he wanted Lucy to make it happen. He threatened to put her behind bars if she didn't help him, so she had to figure it out. \n\n\nCarly came back downstairs after her shower, and Janet handed her a cup of her special hangover cure. Carly was despondent that the vodka deal was probably going south, and she would be financially doomed. Janet told her things would look better in the morning, so Carly went upstairs just before Jack arrived at the front door. Janet covered for Carly and hustled Jack home. She explained how she had found Liberty and Parker in the theater, but neither of them could figure out why the kids had not been watching Johnny. Janet said she had prayed for so many years to St. Margaret, the patron saint of single mothers, that she felt she could call her \"St. Peggy.\" She also referred to herself as \"St. Janet,\" as she remembered helping Carly earlier. Jack told her she had a great heart. \n\n\nCraig showed up at Carly's, and she went ballistic. She said she had drunk way too much and had totally screwed up the product launch. Craig explained that Lucy was back, and went into a self-serving description of how she had brought back all the bad memories of when Johnny was missing. Carly was shocked that Craig had turned in his own flesh and blood, but she said she would stick with him on their business deal. Craig promised to \"fix everything,\" and he walked out.\n\n\n",
