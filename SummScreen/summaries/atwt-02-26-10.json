Carly didn't hear because she was listening to a portable music player, so when Parker tapped her on the shoulder, he startled her. Parker told Carly that he was leaving for school but reminded her that he only had one class that day, since he wasn't planning to attend the field trip that was scheduled. Carly was distracted and waved him off to school.\n\n\nAfter Parker left, Carly thought about Jack and about her discovery that Janet and Dusty had engaged in an affair. Just the thought of Janet with Dusty while Carly couldn't be with Jack was enough to put Carly in a foul mood; she proceeded to indulge herself in the bad mood by beating a small area rug on the porch.\n\n\nCraig walked up, and Carly immediately tried to get him to leave. Craig told Carly that he had a feeling he wasn't the person she wanted to beat up, but she retorted, \"Want to bet?\" Craig insisted that he had the answer to Carly's problems with Jack, because work was \"the antidote to the poison that is Jack Snyder.\" He then told Carly that their client, Morris, was \"blown away\" by Carly's designs. Craig thought that it would be easier to launch Carly's new line and make a bigger statement about how serious they were about being in business if they moved to New York.\n\n\nCarly was stunned and told Craig that she wouldn't move to New York with him. Craig said that he wasn't asking Carly to live with him, although he'd be okay with that idea. Carly said it was never going to happen, but Craig gave her a list of reasons why it would make sense, including the fact that the best fabrics and seamstresses were in New York, and the runway shows were there, too. Carly reminded Craig that she had run a successful fashion business from Oakdale before, but Craig thought that would make things harder than necessary. Carly then pointed out that her children had friends, school, and family in Oakdale, and that her life was in Oakdale, too.\n\n\nCraig told Carly that as his business partner, she needed to be focused, and he thought that in order to do that, Carly would need to put some distance between herself and Jack, Janet, and their soon-to-be baby. Carly replied that she didn't need to run away from Jack and Janet. Her phone rang, and Carly checked the caller ID and saw that it was Jack. Craig told her to answer it and prove that she was dealing with her situation well, but Carly let her answering machine pick up the call.\n\n\nJack left a brief message and said that Carly didn't need to return his call. Craig told Carly that he didn't like to see her so upset. Carly suggested that Craig leave. Craig asked Carly to think about the New York idea, and he left. When Craig got back to his suite at the Lakeview, he called his business contact, Ellis, to let Ellis know that he thought Monte Carlo should relocate to New York and to find out how much he could afford to put into Monte Carlo. Ellis informed Craig that Craig didn't have enough funds to finance a line of socks, let alone fancy dresses.\n\n\nAt the farm, Janet entered the kitchen and was carrying groceries. Jack offered to put them away so that Janet could go to the hospital to make sure Liberty ate a good breakfast. Janet asked Jack if he was going to visit Holden, but Jack informed her that Holden didn't want him to get involved in the mess with Damian. Janet then told Jack that it had been nice to be with him again, and Jack agreed, saying it had been a long time. Janet asked if Jack was planning to work late, but Jack said no. Janet smiled and told Jack, \"At this rate, I'll be pregnant before you know it.\" Jack replied, \"That's the plan.\" Janet kissed Jack, but when she turned to leave, Jack wiped his mouth off with his hand.\n\n\nAs Jack put away the groceries, he found a pregnancy test in one of the bags and sighed. Parker walked in and asked whether anyone else was at the farm. Jack said no and asked Parker what was wrong. Parker told Jack that he was worried about Carly, and he explained Carly's manic cleaning. Jack told Parker that Carly wasn't drinking again, but Parker asked if Jack knew what had gotten Carly into such a strange mood. \n\n\nJack suggested that perhaps Carly was stressed about her new business venture with Craig, and then he changed the subject by asking why Parker wasn't in school yet. Parker told Jack that he had some time before he had to be in school and that he was planning to visit Liberty. Jack told Parker that Liberty was lucky to have him, but Parker simply said, \"When you love someone, it's easy to be there for them,\" and he left.\n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Dusty spoke with someone on the phone about the possibility of enrolling Liberty in a cancer study. After Dusty hung up, Liberty, who had been standing outside her hospital room, told Dusty that she'd heard him talking about her, and she asked him what he'd been talking about. Dusty told Liberty that he had found a study in Minneapolis involving young adults with cancer that was having incredible success, but he thought they should talk to Janet about it first. Liberty was adamant that she wanted to go to Minneapolis to join the study.\n\n\nJanet approached and shooed Liberty back into the hospital room. Liberty told Dusty that no matter what her mom might say, she wanted to go. With Liberty back in her room, Janet turned to Dusty and reminded him that she didn't want him to be at the hospital. Dusty replied, \"Well, I want you.\" Janet told Dusty, \"I can't do this now,\" so Dusty told her to meet him in the waiting room right away.\n\n\nWhen Janet followed Dusty into the waiting room, she told him he had no right to demand that she talk to him. Dusty told Janet he was just trying to help, and he said that she didn't have to have a baby with Jack, because there was another way to help Liberty. Janet asked who had told Dusty that she was trying to get pregnant, but Dusty said it didn't matter and told Janet about the Minneapolis study. When Janet said that having a baby with Jack was the only option, Dusty insisted that it would only make things worse. Janet stopped and said, \"I don't believe this ... You're jealous that I'm having a baby to save Liberty's life!\"\n\n\nJanet told Dusty that he of all people should understand why she was doing everything possible to keep her daughter from dying of cancer. Dusty responded that he did understand, but he didn't think it was the best time for Janet and Jack to introduce a baby into their lives. Janet insisted it was the only way to save Liberty, but Dusty reminded her that the study could offer hope for a cure. Dusty gave Janet some information about the study. Janet said, \"What I said before, about being jealous ...\" and Dusty responded, \"I'm jealous of Jack.\" Janet shook her head and said that Dusty could have anybody he wanted, but Dusty answered, \"I'm looking at who I want.\" Janet left the room.\n\n\nParker walked into Liberty's hospital room and saw Liberty sitting on the bed with her hands on her temples. Parker asked if Liberty was okay, and Liberty answered that she was fine. Parker was doubtful and asked if Liberty was sure. Liberty confessed that her head was itchy, and because a nurse had told her that that was a sign that her hair might be about to fall out, Liberty was trying not to scratch her head, to prevent that from happening.\n\n\nParker then told Liberty that he had snacks for her, and he offered her a chocolate bar, but she told him that her taste buds seemed dead to her, so that things didn't taste the same, although popcorn still tasted amazingly good. Parker promised to bring tons of popcorn for \"movie night.\" Liberty asked what he meant, and Parker told her that he planned to download four or five really bad movies that they could watch together that weekend, and he would even bring a pillow so that he could sleep in the chair in Liberty's room.\n\n\nLiberty told Parker that she hoped not to be in the hospital that weekend, and she filled him in on the study in Minnesota. She said that she had called Dr. Hearn to ask him about the study, and he had directed her to a Web site that had information on it. Liberty pointed to her laptop, and Parker looked at the screen, then said worriedly that there seemed to be a lot of details about the side effects. Liberty agreed but said that didn't matter if it made her better, and she told Parker she planned to go to Minnesota for the study whether her mom wanted her to or not. Parker offered to accompany Liberty, but Liberty said she didn't want him to do that.\n\n\nParker pulled his laptop computer out of his backpack and showed Liberty that he had set it up for video calling, so that he and Liberty could speak to and see one another whenever they wanted to. Liberty was touched but told Parker that she probably wouldn't be looking very good after her treatments. Parker assured Liberty that at the worst, she might be downgraded from \"beautiful\" to merely \"pretty.\"\n\n\nJanet walked in and greeted Parker. Parker said he had to get to school, and he told them both goodbye. Liberty asked her mother where Dusty was, and Janet replied that she had sent him home because he had been pressuring Liberty about the study. Liberty assured her mother that she really wanted to participate in the study, and she asked if Janet would go with her to Minnesota. Janet said, \"You just try and stop me,\" and they embraced.\n\n\nJanet met with Jack in Old Town and told him about the study and the fact that a bed was available for Liberty, but they had to leave that day to drive to Minnesota. Jack offered to take a day off from work to drive Janet and Liberty, but Janet reminded Jack that he couldn't accompany them, since he'd never had the chicken pox. Janet assured Jack that she could drive Liberty herself. When Jack asked how long they would be gone, Janet said it was hard to tell, but she would drive back and forth to Oakdale so that she could keep working on the pregnancy. Jack suggested that the pregnancy could wait, but Janet didn't want to give up on the idea in case the leukemia study didn't work out well.\n\n\nHoping to speak to Lisa about Monte Carlo, Carly went to Fashions. When the salesgirl told Carly that Lisa would be back soon, Carly said she would take a few minutes to look around and scope out the competition. She found a little black dress to try on, and as she walked through the store in the dress, she glanced out of the storefront window and saw Jack and Janet talking. As she watched, Jack and Janet kissed. Carly stepped away from the window and accidentally knocked over a rack of clothes, which made a very loud noise that Jack and Janet heard from outside the store. Carly made a beeline for the exit, over the salesgirl's objections, as Jack told Janet that he would find out what the ruckus was about.\n\n\nWhen Jack entered the store, he asked the salesgirl what had happened, and she told him that a woman had just left the store while wearing one of the store's dresses. Jack asked for a description of the woman, but the salesgirl told him that she knew the woman's name, because Carly had left her business card for Lisa. When Jack heard that the woman was Carly, he appeared surprised.\n\n\nJack went back outside to speak to Janet, and he told her there wasn't anything to worry about. Janet became upset and told Jack that she would be lonely without him while she was in Minnesota, but she had to be strong for Liberty. Jack assured Janet that she would be strong, and he said that when she couldn't be, she could call him. They embraced, and Janet told Jack that she would call him as soon as she and Liberty got to the hospital in Minnesota.\n\n\nWhen Liberty and Janet arrived at the hospital in Minnesota, a nurse met them and suggested that they both get some rest. Dusty then appeared, much to Janet's surprise, and offered to give Janet a ride to her hotel room. Liberty thanked Dusty for arranging for her to get into the leukemia study, but when she told him she felt tired, he said he would leave. Liberty asked him to do her a favor and take Janet with him, and he agreed.\n\n\nDusty told Janet that he had felt he needed to make sure the hospital was a good one, since it had been his idea for Liberty to try the study. Janet thanked him profusely.  Dusty asked if all Janet wanted was to thank him for helping Liberty, but Janet replied that she didn't know what she wanted. Janet became uncomfortable and told Dusty that she wanted to return to the hospital, in case Liberty needed her. Dusty pointed out that the nurse had suggested that both Janet and Liberty get some rest, and he steered Janet to the bed, where she sat down. Dusty stroked Janet's cheek and told her that he would take care of her, and that he wasn't giving her any choice in the matter.\n\n\nAs Liberty lay down on the hospital bed in Minneapolis, she noticed some of her hair on the pillow. She then put her hands to her head and saw even more hair in her hands. At that moment, her laptop rang, and she could see Parker, who was calling her from Java. Liberty put her finger over the camera on her laptop so that it wouldn't broadcast her image. Parker asked what was wrong with her camera, but Liberty said she wasn't sure, and she was too tired to figure it out, so she asked Parker if they could talk later. When Parker tried to narrow down a time when he could call her back, Liberty was evasive and said she had to hang up.\n\n\nParker went to the Lakeview to ask Craig to release some of his trust fund to him so that he could visit Liberty in Minneapolis. Parker made his case eloquently by telling Craig that he couldn't let Liberty go through the cancer treatments alone. Craig pointed out that Janet would be with Liberty, but Parker said Liberty couldn't talk to Janet the way she could talk to him. He explained that he wasn't trying to blow his money on something stupid, and Craig agreed. Craig told Parker that Parker had inspired him, because \"when you love someone, there's just nothing you won't do and no amount of money you won't spend to make them happy.\"\n\n\nLater, Craig met with Ellis in the restaurant at the Lakeview and told Ellis that he thought he'd found a solution to his money problems. When Craig told Ellis that he would use Parker's trust fund to finance Monte Carlo, Ellis was concerned about Craig not getting Parker's permission to do so. Craig said that because Parker loved Carly, Parker wouldn't be upset if Craig used Parker's money to make Carly happy. Ellis asked whether Craig was sure he could pull it off, and Craig replied, \"I have no doubt.\"\n\n\nCarly rushed back home, where she sat on the sofa and shook her head at the idea that she had just stolen a dress from Fashions in order to avoid seeing Jack. As she sat there, she fantasized about Jack's potential future baby boy, Jack Jr. In Carly's fantasy, Jack and Janet were at the farm, celebrating Jack Jr.'s birthday, and were soon joined by Parker and Liberty. Carly watched the happy family from the porch of the Snyder farm, wine glass in hand, until Jack spotted her and went to ask her to leave. In the fantasy, Craig appeared and apologized for having let Carly get away from him, and Craig tried to get Carly to leave by telling her that she should have listened to him when he'd suggested that she leave Oakdale.\n\n\nJack arrived and knocked on Carly's door. She let him in, and he asked her about the dress she was wearing, which still had the security tag on it. Carly said she was going to return it, and Jack asked what had happened at Fashions. Carly said that unless he was going to arrest her, she didn't have to answer his questions. Jack told Carly that both he and Parker were worried about her. When Carly asked why Parker was worried, Jack let her know that Parker had told him she'd been \"turbo cleaning.\" Carly chuckled and admitted that was true, then she told Jack that he should enjoy that and just move back into the house with Janet and his future bundle of joy. Jack asked where Carly planned to be, and she told him she was moving to New York.\n\n\nJack was shocked and told Carly that there was no way he would let her take his kids to New York to live. Carly pointed out that they were her kids, too, and that the fashion business was based in New York. Jack asked why Carly was acting that way, and she said it was because of him and the promises he'd made to her that he was unable to keep. She told him that he had no idea how hard it had been for her, and then she asked him to leave before she said something that she didn't want to say.\n\n\nJack said he would leave, but he again stated there was no way Carly was going to take the kids to New York. Carly implored Jack to let her go; she told him she was \"tired of trying to do the right thing. I'm not good at it, and I don't want to be good at it.\" Jack then said he wouldn't leave until Carly told him what was really the matter. Carly became exasperated and told Jack that he could stay if he wanted to, but she began to take off the dress she was wearing.\n\n\nJack was caught by surprise when Carly asked him to help her unzip the dress, but he unzipped it for her. As she turned to face him, Carly looked into Jack's eyes, and they began to kiss. Jack stopped himself and told Carly that as much as he wanted to be with her, he couldn't betray Janet like that. Carly laughed and told Jack that Janet had beaten him to it. When Jack asked what Carly meant, Carly told him that Janet had slept with Dusty.\n\n\n",
