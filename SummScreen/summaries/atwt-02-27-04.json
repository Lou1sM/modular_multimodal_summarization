Jessica told Sarah she couldn't take another letter to Bonnie because Lisa was joining her on the trip that time.  Casey and Lisa arrived.  Casey tried to convince Sarah to back off her plan to take down Jessica.  After Jessica and Lisa left, Sarah had second thoughts.  \n\n\nCasey and Sarah rushed off to Al's Diner to catch up with Jessica and Lisa.  Casey created a diversion, and Sarah gave Jessica another chance to be honest about the letters.  Jessica planted another lie, and Sarah decided to leave her letters inside the scrapbook.  Jessica took off for the prison.\n\n\nBob and Susan were conferring at the hospital when Kim arrived.  Kim wanted to apologize for the argument the other day and offered to bury the hatchet.  Susan's beeper sounded, and she was called away, but she reserved the right to finish the discussion later.\n\n\nCarly and Barbara exchanged zingers at the BRO offices.  Carly said,  \"I'll snuff you out with the one thing you will never have...a really good design.\"  Barbara replied,  \"You slay me.  You're a plagiarist and a flop.\"  Barbara shuffled Carly out the door.  Carly simmered as Paul's plan unfolded.\n\n\nClark knocked Chris out with a nearby flowerpot then he grabbed Alison and said, \"I'm not done with you yet!\"  They headed for the door when Chris jumped him from behind.  They struggled until the police arrived and broke up the fight.  Jack found a vial of GHB on Clark and arrested him.  An ambulance took Alison to the hospital.  \n\n\nHolden put two and two together and figured out Craig had encouraged Aaron to set Clark up.  But Aaron covered for Craig, saying the whole plan had been his own.  Aaron and Holden walked away and cooled off.  Carly arrived, and Craig probed her for information about her new partnership with Paul.  He questioned her until he collected enough information about her plans.  He got excited and said, \"And with that bit of information, I stop Paul cold.\"  \n\n\nCraig guessed that Carly was somehow going to replace Barbara at BRO then said, \"Barbara's going to like that as much as she likes her reflection at 6:00 a.m.\"  Carly asked him why he would tell Barbara, because he hated her just as much as anyone.  Craig said Barbara had only tried to put him in jail, but Paul was trying to take his family away from him, which was ten times worse.  \"No one messes with my family,\" Craig said.  \n\n\nSuddenly, Jack arrived dragging Clark behind him.  Craig slithered out of the station, unnoticed.  Aaron wanted to check on Alison, but Holden said Chris needed to take care of her.  Holden finally cut his kid a break and told him how proud he was for taking a stand on a subject like that.  Just then, Carly noticed Craig had left the building, and she suspected he had made a beeline straight to Barbara.\n\n\nBob visited Chris and Alison in her recovery room.  He noticed the cuts on Chris's scalp and left to get a suture kit.  Outside, Bob ran into Kim, and he filled her in on how Alison had gotten hurt.  Kim was angry and badmouthed Alison's lack of maturity.  Susan wandered into the area just at the right moment and blew a fuse, shouting, \"You hypocrite!  You want to bury the hatchet right in my daughter's back!\"  \n\n\nBob filled Susan in on why Alison was in the hospital.  Susan dropped her guard and rushed into her daughter's room.  After she found out Alison was okay, Bob asked everyone to leave.  Bob told Chris how proud he was of Chris for defending Alison.  \n\n\nKim and Susan returned to the hallway, where they picked up right where they had left off.  Susan said, \"I'll make this brief.  All is not forgiven!  You hate me so you take it out on my daughter.  I'm warning you, I will do whatever it takes to defend my daughter.  You and I are at war!\"\n\n\nBarbara opened the BRO office door and found Craig standing tall.  She said she was all stocked up and tried to close the door, but he grabbed her attention.  He said, \"It's your favorite topic...self-preservation, and I think you're going to want to hear what I have to say.\"  She let him inside but tried not to listen to him.  He pushed and pushed, and then she asked him for a pair of scissors.  He gingerly handed her a pair, then said, \"What if I told you that Carly Tenney is working with your son to destroy you.\"  Barbara's eyes revealed that she might think it was true.\n\n\n",
