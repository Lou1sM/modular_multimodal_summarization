    "tvmega_recap": "When Jack comes home fed up and ready to quit the force because of another run in with Nick, Carly decides it is time to let him in on her extra curricular activities. They are interrupted though by Hal calling Jack to the Wagon Wheel Motel pronto. Could this be what he needs to get his job back? With Parker's help, Carly uses the reverse directory online to secure an address for the phone number she has of Anatoli's. Meg and Emma have a heart to heart, but she can't bring herself to admit to her all she has done. Katie confronts Nick about his undercover work with Carly? He continues to defend the fact nothing is going on with him and Carly, but Katie thinks it is strange they both are at the same seedy strip club. Nick lets Katie in on the fact that Carly told him she had to work there to make ends meet because of Jack's demotion. Katie laughs as she explains that Carly was a big time fashion designer who could get a job anywhere. Nick realizes there is something wrong and he confronts Carly later. Did Jack send her to spy on him? When he realizes he didn't, he pushes his way into her house and searches through a few papers; Carly tries to hide Anatoli's phone number, but he grabs it out of her hand. Jen tries to explain to Hal how Paul is alive. She is very concerned though to find his motel room in shambles with blood on the floor. Jen is sure he wouldn't leave her again, but Hal thinks he is on the run again. Barbara, who has since arrived, is sure James is involved, but Hal doesn't believe that either. Jack arrives at the motel to find out that Paul may be alive and Jen came there to see him; Hal apologizes, but Jack tells him not to worry. What can he do for him now? He can go bring in his cousin, Meg because she was supposedly helping Paul all along. Mike calls Katie, who is at her wits end with Nick and Carly, among other things. Can he come home earlier then he thought? Mike explains there was an accident and his brother was hurt badly. He can't abandon him when he is in the hospital, plus he needs someone to run the project now. Katie hides her disappointment, but tells him to stay as long as he needs. Henry worries that Emily has sent Dusty to Paul's doorstep. Paul could be singing about her attempted murder of him by now. Emily decides she is going to stick around and see how this plays out, much to Henry's surprise. Jack catches up with Meg, as she is about to leave and tells her he wants to discuss Paul with her.",
