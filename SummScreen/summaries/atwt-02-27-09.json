Craig said he couldn't do that, because he had to take Johnny in for a follow-up appointment with the doctor. Carly said she would take Johnny so that Craig could meet with the vendors. \n\n\nMeg was surprised when she ran into Lucy at Memorial Hospital. Lucy told Meg that she was back in Oakdale to stay and that Bob Hughes was considering reinstating her at the hospital. Meg was shocked to hear that, considering that Lucy was a fugitive who was wanted for kidnapping. Lucy said, \"Not anymore,\" and she excused herself and walked away. \n\n\nWhen Carly and Johnny arrived at the hospital, Lucy saw them and ran to hug Johnny. Carly was shocked to see Lucy. Carly told Lucy why Johnny was at the hospital. Lucy said she wanted to be there when the doctor saw Johnny, but Carly said she would have to run that by Craig. Lucy took Johnny over to a table to sit and talk, while Carly phoned Craig. Craig told Carly to keep an eye on Lucy and Johnny, and he rushed to the hospital. \n\n\nWhen Craig arrived, he asked Carly to take Johnny aside for a minute so he could talk to Lucy alone. Craig asked Lucy why she wasn't in jail, and Lucy told him that Dusty had the charges against her dropped. Craig was surprised, since Lucy had made Dusty's life hell by taking Johnny from him, but Lucy said Dusty wasn't as vindictive as Craig was. Craig told Lucy that if the police wouldn't enforce the law, he would get a restraining order keeping Lucy away from Johnny. Johnny and Carly approached, and Johnny asked his dad if Lucy could come and live with them. \n\n\nCraig told Johnny that Lucy had probably already made other living arrangements. Craig told Johnny sternly that it was time to go see the doctor, and Johnny became scared. Lucy tried to calm Johnny down, but Craig told her that if she didn't walk away right then, he would make sure she never saw Johnny again. Carly interrupted and took Craig aside. She told him he was scaring Johnny. Craig said he didn't mean to do that, but he was afraid Lucy would try to take Johnny away from him again. Carly reminded Craig how Johnny had reacted whenever Craig and Dusty had fought, and she told Craig that fighting with Lucy was even worse. \n\n\nLucy told Johnny that she had to leave, and that he needed to go see the doctor with his daddy, but she promised she would see Johnny later. The doctor then told Craig that he was ready to see Johnny. Craig said he would be right in, and Johnny went into the examining room with the doctor. Carly told Craig that if he truly wanted what was best for Johnny, he would let Lucy see Johnny again, because Johnny had clearly been ecstatic to see his sister. \n\n\nAfter the doctor's examination, Craig told Carly that the doctor had said Johnny was doing great. Carly asked if Craig was mad at her, but he said no, because he knew she had just tried to stop him from losing his temper in front of Johnny. Craig said Carly was right, because he didn't want to alienate his own son. Carly said, \"Or your daughter.\" Craig, however, insisted that he cared nothing about reconciling with Lucy, because Lucy had committed the ultimate betrayal. \n\n\nCarly reminded Craig that Lucy was basically the only mother Johnny had known. Carly suggested that Craig still loved Lucy, since he was still so angry with her. Carly also thought that part of the reason Lucy had returned to Oakdale might have been because she still wanted her father in her life. Craig said it was too late, but Carly asked Craig to think back on how many times he himself had asked someone to give him another chance and to believe that he had changed. She told Craig to find some way to forgive his daughter. \n\n\nJohnny came out with the doctor. Craig told Johnny that Lucy wasn't there, but he was going to take Johnny to get his favorite lunch. They left, and Lucy saw Carly, alone. Carly told Lucy that Johnny was fine. Carly said she was sorry, but when Craig was angry, he lashed out. Lucy said she was quite familiar with that. Carly told Lucy she thought Craig had changed, and that he wanted to be a good father to Johnny. \n\n\nLucy said she wished Craig could see that Johnny wasn't the only one who needed a dad. Lucy said that although it surprised her, she realized she did want for them to be a family again. Carly said she hoped that would happen, but that Lucy would need to earn back her father's trust. Lucy said she would try. Carly told Lucy that Lucy needed to respect the fact that Craig really was devoted to Johnny. Lucy said she could see that, and she said she wouldn't do anything to take away from Johnny's happiness. Carly said, \"And I would never do anything to take away from your father's.\" \n\n\nLucy went to the Lakeview to see her father. Craig opened the door to talk to her but wouldn't let her in, telling her that he had just put Johnny down for a nap. Craig wondered why Lucy was there, when he had made it clear he didn't want to see her again. Lucy said she wouldn't be scared off, no matter how much Craig shunned her. She told her father that he would only be hurting Johnny by keeping them apart. Craig said that was basically what Carly had told him, and Lucy said it was clear that Carly cared about Craig. \n\n\nMeg went to see Dusty at work and was surprised that Dusty was letting Lucy off the hook for kidnapping Johnny. After Dusty said Lucy was part of Johnny's family, Meg realized that Dusty was hoping Lucy would feel indebted to him for having helped her gain her freedom, and in repayment, Lucy would make it easier for Dusty to see Johnny. \n\n\nMeg left and went to see a movie. A moment later, Dusty walked into the same movie theater and sat down a row or two in front of Meg. Meg began chucking popcorn at Dusty, and he turned around, annoyed, until he saw it was her. Meg asked if Dusty was following her. He assured her he wasn't; he said he had come to the movie for a midday escape from work. Meg moved down to Dusty's row and told him they could share their popcorn. \n\n\nDusty told Meg that he and Lucy used to go and watch movies in the middle of the day, as an escape. Meg asked if Dusty was still mad at Lucy for having taken Johnny away from him. Dusty said he had realized it took a lot of energy to stay angry at someone, although he still had his moments of being angry with Lucy. Dusty told Meg that his \"great escape\" at the movies wasn't working, so Meg told him they should leave. They headed over to the diner, where they spotted Lucy. \n\n\nMeg left, and Dusty went inside and told Lucy that he'd heard she might be getting her job back at the hospital. Lucy said it was true, and that her dad wasn't happy about it. She said she needed to get Craig to trust her again. Dusty said that wouldn't be easy. Lucy said she knew that, but she thought it could be good for both herself and Dusty if she tried. She took Dusty's hand, and Dusty said he was counting on that. \n\n\nCraig went to Carly's house and told her about Lucy's visit. He told Carly that Lucy had suggested that Carly had said nice things about him and might even care about him. Carly said Lucy must have misunderstood; Craig said he was glad to hear it, because he'd worried that Carly had possibly fallen and hit her head or something. Craig then told Carly that she had also been right when she said that he should try to forgive Lucy. He said he didn't know if he could forgive Lucy, but he could try. Carly then asked about the vodka vendors, and Craig told her he had handled that situation. Carly said, \"You're good!\" and Craig responded, \"I know.\" \n\n\nJade went to Metro and found Derek. She told him she needed his help regarding Casey's situation. Jade explained Casey's theory about Matt, and told Derek that Casey's suspicions were the reason Jade had tried to buy drugs from Matt. Jade then asked Derek to try to dig up something on Matt, to help Casey. \n\n\nAlison went to Yo's to see Matt, who was getting the bar ready for the day. Alison told Matt she still thought someone had set Casey up, because she had never seen any sign that Casey either used or sold drugs. Matt told Alison that she was basically agreeing with Casey, who was telling everyone that Matt was dealing drugs and that Matt had set him up. Alison denied believing that, but said something was definitely not right with Casey's situation. \n\n\nAt the police station, Casey's arraignment did not result in him getting out of jail on bail, given his status as a parolee. Casey was still upset that his mother didn't believe his theory about Matt setting him up. Alison arrived to visit Casey, but Casey said he wasn't interested in seeing her. Margo left them alone together anyway, and Alison told Casey she believed him when he said the drugs weren't his. Alison said she knew Casey, so she knew he would never use drugs or sell them to anyone. Casey told Alison that it meant a lot to know she believed he was innocent. Casey asked where that left Matt, since Matt was the one who had planted the drugs on Casey. Alison said Casey couldn't know that for sure. \n\n\nDerek and Jade arrived at the police station, and Jade told Margo that Derek had information on Matt that might clear Casey. Jade said she wanted to let Casey know about it herself, and Margo told her to go on into the interrogation room. Jade told Casey she had good news for him, but it was private. Alison said she was leaving anyway, and Casey thanked her. After Alison left, Jade told Casey that Derek had found out that Matt had been using drugs in prison. \n\n\nAlison went back to Yo's to see Matt. Alison said she had let Casey know she believed him when he said the drugs weren't his, but she had also told Casey that she didn't think Matt had planted the drugs on him. Margo walked in and told Matt she had just found out that Matt had used drugs in prison. Matt didn't deny it, but told Margo that what was important was that he wasn't using drugs anymore, and he offered to take a drug test. Matt said he wasn't using, and he wasn't a drug dealer and never had been. Margo said she hoped for his sake that was true, but she wanted Matt to know that she was keeping an eye on him. \n\n\nAfter Margo left, Alison asked how Matt could have lied to her about using drugs. Matt said that for a while, he had used drugs to try to make himself feel better while he was in prison. He thought Alison would understand, given her own past involvement with drugs, but Alison said the difference was that she hadn't lied to Matt about her experience. Matt asked how Alison thought he could look her in the eye and kiss her and want to make love to her if he had actually had a part in killing a friend of hers. He said he needed Alison to believe he was innocent, too. Alison said she did, but she pointed out that if Matt wasn't the one behind the drug death and the setup of Casey, someone else was, and she had no idea who that might be. \n\n\nBack at the station, Casey asked if Margo had arrested Matt. She told him she couldn't, since there was still no way to prove anything against Matt. Casey said that hadn't stopped her from arresting him, and he wondered why she didn't let him go when she'd already given Luke, Noah, and Matt a pass. Margo said she realized Casey was upset, and he sarcastically thanked her for noticing. She left, and Jade told Casey she was sorry she hadn't been able to help him. Casey said Jade had done more than his own mom had done, and he thanked her.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Carly berates Craig for not being there with their venders when she was forced to drink them under the table and answer their questions. Craig should have been there, and she wants him to fix things. She agrees to stay with Johnny so he can do that. Jade surprises Derek by asking for his help with Casey. He doesn't think he is worth it. She wants him to help her get any dirt on Matt that might help Casey.

He's silenced when Johnny asks if Lucy can come live with them. When Craig wants to take Johnny away to see the doctor, Johnny wants to stay with Lucy.

Alison returns to Matt and tells him that she saw Casey and she believes both of them are innocent. However, Jade tells Casey that Matt did do drugs in prison, so now if they could prove the big leap that he is selling also.

But if he's not behind this, then somebody else is and she has no idea who that could be. Craig tells Carly that he will give Johnny enough love that he won't need anyone else.
