    "soap_central": "\n\nLuke, Noah and Ameera, who were stranded on the highway and spent the night in Noah's truck, awakened and heard a car approaching. The boys tried to flag down the car, which slowed as if to help the teens and then sped off. The car reversed and sped forward several times, teasing the boys. Noah yelled, \"Jerk!\" at the retreating car, which immediately reversed and sped back, aiming directly at them. Two young men who had obviously been drinking climbed out of the car and began to give Luke and Noah a hard time. They also made crude comments to Ameera and about Iraquis. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Lily and Holden discussed the fact that, even though they had gotten closer, Lily needed more time before she could be intimate with her husband. They were surprised to find a note from Luke saying that the boys and Ameera were going to Statesville to visit Colonel Mayer. Lily and Holden worried about the boys, especially after they failed to make phone contact with them. \n\n\nBrad and Katie listened at Henry and Vienna's door for sounds of action. They heard nothing, but inside there was amorous activity. Henry and Vienna had a wild night of lovemaking, which was interrupted by a phone call from an angry Kit. She demanded that Henry meet her at noon at Metro with the $250,000 so they could consummate the sale of the nightclub and she could get out of town. Henry agreed to meet her and left immediately to find Jack, who was collecting the money. After Henry was gone, Vienna received many packages of beautiful high fashion shoes, a gift from Gray. Vienna was torn between her feelings for Henry and her yearning for life in the fast lane again. She called Gray and told him she was returning all the shoes to \"Fashions,\" and she put on one of her most glamorous dresses. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Carly and Brad reminded Parker that he needed to go to school and try to resume as much of a normal life as possible. They vented their frustration that they had not been able to assemble the proof they needed to clear Parker of the charges of killing Sam. Henry arrived at the police station, and he and Brad waited for Jack to arrive with the cash. Jack, however, had not been able to get the money together, and Katie stunned him with an offer of putting up the money for Parker's sake. Jack was reluctant to accept but finally promised that he would return the money to Katie as soon as Kit was arrested. Carly was not in favor of taking Katie's money but relented when no other possibilities arose. Katie went to retrieve the money and brought it back to Henry. \n\n\nOutside \"Fashions,\" Vienna ran into Gray just as she thought she would. He was disappointed that she chose not to keep the shoes, but Vienna told him there was something else he could give her that would make her happier: $250,000 in cash. Vienna had heard just enough of Henry's conversation with Kit to know that Henry needed this huge sum of cash for some purpose. She thought this was her chance to reassure Henry of her love. Gray agreed to give her the money. \n\n\nAt the police station, Brad came up with another of his brainstorms. He suggested that Henry seduce Kit and get her to spill her secrets. Carly and Jack would hide in the back room and listen so there would be witnesses to her confession of killing Sam. They left for Metro to put their plan in action. When Kit arrived, she signed the deed and Henry went into seduction mode. He sweet-talked Kit, and she responded by telling him she felt so guilty about how Sam died, when suddenly in walked Vienna carrying a satchel with $250,000 demanding to know why Henry was kissing Kit. Henry tried to calm down Vienna while Kit grabbed her money and departed. Vienna left in a fit of rage, as well, and Henry tried to follow her, but she got into Gray's car. \n\n\nOn the road, the abusive strangers hit Noah over the head with a tire iron and punched Luke multiple times. Luke put up a good fight, but the boys were bigger and tougher. The strangers wanted to take Ameera with them, but Luke refused to let her go. The boys were just about to take the girl when a car approached, carrying Lily and Holden who helped subdue the punks. \n\n\nBrad and Katie waited at the station for word on how the sting operation went. Henry arrived with the bad news that Katie's money was gone, and so was Vienna. Katie volunteered to look for Vienna and to explain everything to her. Henry began wondering where Vienna had gotten so much money and came to the conclusion that it was from her new admirer, Gray. Henry headed back to the Lakeview, and Brad and Katie shared a kiss, which led to another...and another. \n\n\nVienna gave in to Gray in the car and made love with him. Afterwards, however, she acted distant. In his room at the Lakeview, Henry found one pair of the expensive shoes and a note from Gray. Henry became despondent. \n\n\nLily and Holden took Luke and Noah to Memorial Hospital where Dr. Susan Stewart told them that Luke would be all right and Noah was not injured too badly. Luke and Ameera visited with Noah, and Ameera told a nurse in the room that Noah was her \"brother.\" Noah and Luke took that to mean brother in the sense that all mankind is a brotherhood. \n\n\nParker returned home from school and announced he was going to try out for baseball that afternoon. Jack lamented that he was out of ideas to save Parker from going to jail when Carly said she had come up with a plan. She would tell Kit that she had proof that Kit was Sam's actual killer and see what happened. \n\n\n",

Vienna is devastated to see Henry kissing Kit and she tells him that their relationship is over for good. Vienna is so hurt that she has sex with Gray in his limo thinking of Henry the whole time and crying after the experience is done. Brad and Katie give in to their feelings for each other and kiss as they comfort each other because they are worried about Parker. Carly plans to tell Kit she has proof she fired the shot that killed Sam. Carly hopes that giving this false information to Kit will push Kit to try and kill her.",
