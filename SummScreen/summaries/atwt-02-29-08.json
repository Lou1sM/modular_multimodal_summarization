Margo told him that her family wasn't very interesting, but Matt said he thought they were amazing. Matt asked why Margo was home in the middle of the day, and Margo told him she had forgotten a file because she was preoccupied with a case that involved the son of a friend of hers, who was being charged with murder. Matt asked if he could do anything to help her, and Margo said he could try to convince Casey to go back to college. \n\n\nCasey walked in and saw his mother and Matt talking. He told Margo that he and Matt needed to get back to work, and they left. Back at the Lakeview bar, Casey asked Matt what Margo had been talking to him about, and Matt told Casey that Margo wanted Casey to go back to school. Gray walked into the lounge, and Matt saw him and backed into Casey, which caused Casey to break a glass and cut his hand. Matt told Casey he thought he should go to the hospital to have the cut looked at, and despite Casey's reluctance, they left together. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Casey and Matt ran into Alison, who saw Casey's hand and called a nurse to come look at it. The nurse told Casey he would need stitches, and they left. Alison thanked Matt for convincing Casey to come in to the hospital. Alison said she was about to begin her break, so Matt asked if she would go with him back to the Lakeview. She agreed, and they left. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Katie and Brad became passionate in Brad's office while the office workers were all at lunch. Afterwards, as they were dressing, Katie told Brad the sex had been a mistake. Brad said it was the right thing to do at that moment, but Katie asked why she felt so sad if that was true. Katie then apologized for her emotions, but Brad told her not to worry about it. \n\n\nHenry waited for Vienna in their suite, and when she walked in, he asked if she had been with Gray. When Vienna said yes, Henry asked her if she had slept with Gray. Vienna said that after seeing Henry with another woman, she had gone to Gray and made love with him. She told Henry she loved Gray now, since Henry had cheated on her. Henry told Vienna he couldn't believe she was so mad that she went off to bed with another man, but Vienna accused Henry of having different rules for men and women. Because his pride was hurt, Henry agreed, telling Vienna that she should go to Gray and he would go back to Kit. Vienna told Henry to send her things up to the penthouse, and she left. On opposite sides of their hotel room door, Henry and Vienna looked miserable. \n\n\nAfter Vienna left, Henry angrily dumped all of her clothes in a pile on the floor outside their suite, then went to WOAK to tell Katie and Brad what had happened. When they asked Henry why he hadn't told Vienna that he was just pretending to be involved with Kit, Henry said that after Vienna had slept with Gray, he had to hold onto some semblance of his pride or he would look like a complete loser. Brad told Katie they needed to do something to convince Vienna to go back to Henry, but Katie told Brad it wasn't their business and that people in love get hurt. Henry assumed Katie was upset about the loss of the $250,000 she'd given him to use in his attempt to trap Kit, but Brad told Henry that wasn't what had Katie upset. \n\n\nVienna met Gray in the restaurant at the Lakeview. When Vienna said she wanted to go to the diner to work, Gray told her she didn't need to do that ever again. Vienna said she'd learned to enjoy taking care of herself, and she told Gray that Henry had changed her that way. Gray told Vienna he would change her back and spoil her, but Vienna told him she had to do things her way. She went back upstairs, telling herself that she would apologize to Henry, but then she saw her things lying on the floor outside their suite and became angry again. \n\n\nHenry and Brad went to the diner to talk, and Brad assumed Henry was hoping to run into Vienna. Henry placed a very particular order for a hamburger and salad, and the waitress, who didn't write the order down, went to submit it. Vienna came in; Brad saw her and left Henry alone at the table. Vienna saw Henry, and when his food was ready, she took it to him herself. Henry complained that the food wasn't right, and he and Vienna exchanged veiled remarks about the food and their respective affairs. Vienna brought Henry's order back several times, but each time he complained that something was wrong with it, until finally he asked for his original waitress. Vienna replied, \"She would have quit by now. Why are you being so mean to me when you know how much I love you?\" \n\n\nAs Brad left the diner, he saw Gray sitting outside and greeted him, calling him \"Gray the Destroyer.\" Brad warned Gray to \"leave my friends alone.\" Gray asked if Brad was threatening him, and Brad said, \"You heard me.\" Gray then saw Matt walking up with Alison. Matt suggested to Alison that they go into the bookstore and each buy their three favorite books for the other to read. Alison liked that idea, and they went inside, but Matt came back out alone and approached Gray. \n\n\nMatt apologized to Gray for leaving earlier when Casey cut his hand, and he asked Gray what he could do for him, calling him \"Boss.\" Gray asked how the \"research\" was going at the Hugheses' house, and Matt said it was going fine. Gray told him to take his time, saying, \"When we put this plan into motion, we can't afford any mistakes.\" Gray then pointed to Brad and told Matt he needed him to give Brad a message for him; he whispered something to Matt as Alison walked out of the bookstore and saw them together. \n\n\nGray went back into the diner, and Matt told Alison that Gray was a regular customer at the Lakeview who was a big tipper. Matt then said he had to get back to work, so he told Alison goodbye and left. Alison went back to the hospital, where she saw Casey again. Alison told Casey that although she liked Matt, she felt that he was always hiding something from her. Casey said they all had things to hide, and he didn't have anything bad to say about Matt. \n\n\nWhen Gray walked back into the diner, he saw Vienna crying and accused Henry of not knowing how to treat her. Gray then gave Henry his bill for the repeated orders of his lunch and told Henry that Vienna was his now. To make his point, as Henry left, Gray put his arm around Vienna and nuzzled her cheek, while Vienna watched Henry sadly through the window of the diner. \n\n\nJack told Carly he didn't like the idea of her confronting Kit in an attempt to get Kit to confess to Sam's murder, but Carly said they didn't have any other options. Parker came home and asked what they were up to. Both Jack and Carly tried to assure Parker that they were working on his case, but they didn't want to tell him their plans. Jack told Parker it would be better if he went to the farm to wait for them, and Parker left reluctantly. \n\n\nCarly called Kit and told her to come to Luther's Corners Church to pick up the deed to Metro. Carly and Jack got to the church first, and Jack hid after reminding Carly to be careful. Kit arrived, and Carly refused to give her the deed, saying she knew what Kit had done to Sam. Carly accused Kit of having fired the shot that went through Sam's heart and killed him, and she told Kit she had proof. Kit didn't believe Carly, saying Carly would have gone to the police if she had proof. \n\n\nKit tried to leave, but Carly followed her out and told her that Kit couldn't run from the fact that Sam had wanted Carly more than he'd wanted Kit. Carly continued to goad Kit, saying Sam had just been using her and reminding Kit of all the times Kit had to leave town and Sam made excuses not to go with her. Carly said, \"That's why you killed him, isn't it?\" Kit didn't take the bait, however, and told Carly to \"bug off.\" Kit left, and Jack came out from his hiding spot and told Carly she'd done the best she could do. He then told Carly he had a guy on the police force following Kit for him. \n\n\nMargo called Jack and asked him to come to the station right away. When Jack got there, the cop who'd been following Kit for him told Jack that Margo had found out about it. Margo told Jack he wasn't in a position to authorize a tail on a suspect; she told Jack she would let it slide for now, but Jack had to obey her orders from now on. Jack said he would, and then he went and asked the other cop, Benny, where Kit had gone after she left the church. Benny didn't know, because he'd lost Kit. \n\n\nKatie ran into Parker at Java and sat down with him. Parker told Katie he was thinking about going to the police station to turn himself in and plead guilty to Sam's murder, because he thought it might be the easiest way out for him. Katie told him, \"Don't you dare do that!\" and then told him that a lot of people, including his parents and her, were pulling for him and would help him get out of this situation without turning himself in. Katie made Parker promise not to go to the police station. Parker then told Katie he was supposed to be at the farm, but he said he had left a school book at Carly's and really needed it. Katie told him to give her his keys to the house, and she would go get the book for him and bring it to him at the farm. \n\n\nWhen Katie got to Carly's house, she heard a noise in the kitchen and went to investigate. As she looked around, she was hit from behind and knocked to the floor. \n\n\nBack at WOAK, Brad came in to find the TV station still empty. He called Bonnie and left her a message, saying he'd like it if she could come meet him down at the station. After he hung up and turned to go to his office, he was hit on the head from behind and fell to the ground, unconscious. Matt bent down next to Brad and said, \"I guess he got Gray's message.\" \n\n\n\n\n",
