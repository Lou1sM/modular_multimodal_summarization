Although Mike acts angry that she is there, Katie tells him that Bob Hughes instructed her to stay with him until the nurse arrives.  Katie persuades Mike to tell her how he was hurt, and he tells her that he fell from a tree after saving a little girl and her kitten.  The two admit that they still love each other, but that Simon will always be between them.  The nurse then asks Katie to help Mike into his hospital gown, which almost leads to other things, but the nurse returns.  After Mike falls asleep, Katie returns and kisses him, whispering, \"Wherever you go, wherever I am, I'll never forget you.\"\n\n\nJessica and Lisa arrive at the prison to visit Bonnie with the scrapbook that Jessica made for Bonnie, unaware that Sarah had slipped something into it.  The guard finds the entire stack of letters from Sarah to Bonnie, which clearly violate the court order that the two cannot communicate.  Jessica calls Ben, and Margo also arrives.  Margo gives them the news that the judge will decide whether to suspend Jessica or to disbar her permanently.  Back at Jessica and Ben's home, Casey is distressed with Sarah's actions but still promises to stand by her.  He meets Tom at Yo's and tries to ask Tom's advice without telling any particulars, confusing his dad.  When Jessica and Ben return home, a shaken Jessica tells Sarah that she will not be allowed to visit Bonnie any more, and Sarah snaps, \"What did you expect?\" smugly continuing, \"I did it.\"\n\n\nPaul opens the door of his penthouse to find Jennifer looking for some sketches for B.R.O.  Lucy walks into the room, dressed only in one of Paul's shirts.  Jennifer tells her brother that it is inappropriate for him to have a high school girl stay in his apartment, then accuses Paul of using Lucy to get back at Craig.  After Paul convinces her that he is just trying to help Lucy, she makes him promise to take her back to Lucinda's the next morning.  Before she leaves, Jen softens and thanks Paul for being so forgiving of Barbara and for making them all a family again.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the Barbara Ryan Originals office, Craig breaks the news to Barbara that Paul is plotting to replace her with Carly.  At first Barbara protests, but she remembers seeing Carly with the \"Carly\" logo, and she also remembers seeing Paul with a design drawn by someone besides Barbara.  Barbara declares to Craig that she owns controlling interest in B.R.O.,  but again remembers signing some papers without reading them.  A horrified look crosses Barbara's face.  Craig warns Barbara that the only way she can save herself if to act quickly, before Paul puts all the pieces in place.  Craig leaves, calls Lucy, and finds that she is at Paul's.  Craig goes to Paul's penthouse and asks her what he can do to get her to give him another chance as a father.  Lucy replies, \"You'd have to be somebody else,\" and asks him to leave and not to come see her again.  Outside the door, Craig says, \"Paul Ryan, at least you're finished.\"\n\n\nThe minute Craig walks out the door of B.R.O., Barbara calls Paul and insists that he come to the office immediately.  When Paul arrives, Barbara craftily suggests that they hire her an assistant, the person who created the mysterious design.  Paul's evasion and hesitation seal her certainty.  Barbara gently kisses him and says, \"That, my darling - that was goodbye.\"  Confused, Paul asks Barbara what she means by goodbye.  Barbara answers, \"As of this moment, I am cutting you out of my life forever....You are trying to destroy me and I promise you, son, I will not let you get away with it!\"\n\n\n",
