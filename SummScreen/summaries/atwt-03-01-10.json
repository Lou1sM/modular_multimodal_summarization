    "soap_central": "\n\n \nBarbara awoke after \"Olympian sex\" with Henry, and she found him in his boxers as he carried chocolates and champagne to her in bed.  She was pleased that their relationship was \"superficial and consensual, with no strings attached.\"  They drank champagne and began to make love again, as Barbara cautioned her lover to \"keep it shallow.\"  Someone knocked on Henry's door, and then Katie called out to him.  Henry panicked and asked Barbara to hide in the bathroom.  Barbara fussed, but Henry sweet-talked her into complying.\n\n\nHenry donned his robe and answered the door.  Katie insisted on entering, and she admitted that Jacob was the real reason for her visit.  Then Katie noticed the disheveled bed, and she sniffed the air.  She asked Henry what he had been doing, and commented that whatever it was, he hadn't been doing it alone.  She claimed that nothing hung in the air as much as a woman's cheap perfume.  Katie was horrified that Henry had been squandering his inheritance on booze, chocolate and, evidently, hookers.\n\n\nHenry defended himself by saying that it was his money and his business if he chose to spend it on \"morally challenged women.\"  At that comment, an irate Barbara pounded on the bathroom wall, but Henry sloughed it off as \"horrible neighbors.\"  Katie said that she had been reconsidering Henry's offer to fund Jacob's education, but after seeing how he was frittering away his money, she was turning it down again.  Katie marched out, as Barbara exploded out of the bathroom, furious at Henry.  She read him the riot act and inadvertently slammed his fingers in the door as she left.\n\n\nKatie went back home and enjoyed watching Reid Oliver sing Jacob to sleep.  She said she would miss all of his bad habits when he moved back to Dallas, and Reid said that all depended on the judge at his hearing.  He suggested that Katie rethink turning down Henry's offer of a trust fund for her baby.  Reid said that it all hinged on five words: Jacob could go to Harvard.  Reid soon took off for work.\n\n\nIn great pain, Henry went to Memorial to get treatment for his \"throbbing digits.\"  He was less than joyous when Reid Oliver walked in to examine him.  Henry requested a \"likeable doctor,\" but Oliver convinced him to drag the injured hand out of the ice bucket Henry had brought with him.  Oliver diagnosed a sprain, but he also recommended an x-ray.  He also dished out a dose of advice by telling \"Hank,\" as he liked to call Henry, to own up to the fact that he was in love with Katie but could not help screwing it up.  Henry countered that he and Katie were \"just friends,\" and Reid said that if his court appearance went well, he would be out of Oakdale before \"Hank\" could sober up.  Reid also challenged Henry to prove him wrong and call Katie.\n\n\nKatie ran into Barbara in the Lakeview lounge, and she got a whiff of Barbara's perfume.  She mentioned it, and Barbara said it was \"new and expensive,\" and Katie joked that she had smelled something up in Henry's room that was probably \"Eau de By the Hour.\"  Barbara said that she and Henry had once had a \"thing,\" but it was long over, and she questioned why Katie had turned down the Stenbeck fortune yet again.  Katie wondered how Barbara knew that, and the two women agreed to have drinks.\n\n\nThey sat in the lounge, and Barbara said that, from time to time, Henry had confided in her about Katie.  Katie said that she hated to see Barbara \"use Henry\" like that because Barbara obviously wanted the Stenbeck money for herself.  Barbara flatly denied that and accused Katie herself of using Henry.  Katie got angry and trounced out.  She went home and made Reid a giant sandwich since it might be their last night as roommates.  Reid said he would miss Katie \"and the kid,\" too.\n\n\nBarbara continued to sip her drink in the lounge, and Henry walked in.  He joined her and said there was no insult intended, and he admitted that he deserved it, as he showed her his left hand, which had a big splint on its middle finger.  Barbara chuckled, but she also apologized for overreacting when Katie had arrived.  Henry admitted that being with Barbara made him happy, and he asked her if they went public with their relationship if it would ruin everything.  Barbara gave Henry's hurt finger a kiss, and then she looked around carefully and planted a big kiss on his lips.  They agreed to meet in Henry's room for more sex, and Henry left first.  Barbara chugged her drink and then followed.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, she and Jack argued about his relationship with his wife, and finally Carly blurted out that Janet had slept with Dusty Donovan.  Jack said that Janet would never have done that, but Carly claimed that Janet had told Carly herself.  Jack could not believe Carly had not told him sooner, but she said that Liberty's illness had stopped her.  Jack was stunned and remained silent, so Carly offered him coffee and an opportunity to talk more, but Jack said there was nothing to talk about.  Carly asked when Jack was going to confront Janet about her cheating, but he said that Carly's revelation did not change anything.\n\n\nJack said sadly that Janet was with Dusty not because of him but because Brad had died and Jack had walked out, so she had nowhere else to turn.  He said he was responsible for Brad's death; therefore, he owed Liberty.  Cary was horrified that Jack was still planning on having a baby with Janet to provide bone marrow for Liberty.  She urged Jack to walk away from Janet, but Jack only admitted that he still loved Carly, and he turned and went out.\n\n\nJack went to Metro, and was looking for Dusty.  He asked the temporary hostess where he was, but she said that Mr. Donovan was \"out of town.\"  Jack then realized that, more than likely, Dusty was in Minneapolis with Janet and Liberty.\n\n\nCraig met with Ellis, his financial advisor, in the Lakeview lounge, and he asked in there was enough money in Parker's trust fund to get Monte Carlo up and running again.  Ellis was concerned how Carly would react if she knew that Craig was looting her son's trust fund, but Craig was sure that he could pay it all back, with interest, before anyone was the wiser.  Craig gave the go-ahead to Ellis and also told him to pick up the lunch tab.\n\n\nCarly found Craig in the lounge after Ellis had left, and she told him she was ready to roll on Monte Carlo.  She said that she needed to keep busy, as Craig asked what Jack had done lately to make her unsettled.  Carly said it had made no difference to Jack that Janet had slept with Dusty, and the news of that affair shocked Craig.  He also said that Jack was right, because Liberty was still ill, and Jack was not about to leave his wife.  Carly said all she needed from Craig was money, not advice, and she wanted to go to Metro and eat rare steak and figure out how to get rich.\n\n\nAt Metro, Carly asked Craig just exactly how much money their investor, Maurice, had committed, but Craig fudged his answer.  He said it was \"too sensitive\" to discuss openly, and then he suggested where they might have their warehouse in New York.  He said if they lived in the warehouse, then they could work around-the-clock.  The hostess walked by, and Craig asked to speak with Dusty in order to compliment him on his chef.  The woman said that Craig was the second guy that day to ask for Dusty, but the owner was out of town in Minneapolis.  Carly immediately excused herself and, on the pretense of \"freshening up,\" she approached the hostess and asked if the other person inquiring about Dusty had been Jack Snyder.\n\n\nCarly returned to the table, and Craig asked what she wanted for dessert.  Carly smiled and said what she really wanted was \"a trip to Minneapolis,\" and then she gave a pitch to him about how Minneapolis was the new Mecca for avant-garde designers.   Craig ordered the hired jet fueled, and Carly got excited until she realized that Craig was going with her.  He explained that he was the one who had to sign the checks to lease the warehouse space.\n\n\nAfter the flight to Minneapolis, Carly and Craig went to her room in the hotel she had chosen.  Craig had his own room, but he went to Carly's with her.  He suggested that he begin calling real estate agents to find suitable warehouse space to rent.  Carly asked him to do that from his own room, and Craig suddenly asked her what was going on.  He said their hotel was nowhere near the warehouse district, but it was very close to the research hospital where Liberty was a patient.  Craig accused Carly of being in Minneapolis for Jack.\n\n\nIn the same hotel, Dusty and Janet were about to kiss, but Janet said she needed to be available for Liberty.  Dusty offered to just hold her in his arms until she dozed off, but Janet questioned whether that was enough for him.  Dusty said no, and he kissed her, as they stretched out on the bed.  Suddenly Janet's phone rang, and a tearful Liberty said that her hair was falling out in clumps.  Janet said she was on her way, and she thanked Dusty for everything and told him she would see him back in Oakdale.  Dusty refused to let Janet drive to the hospital in such a mental state, and he took her car keys and hustled her out.\n\n\nThey arrived at the hospital, and Dusty refused to leave town.  Janet was relieved, and she went in to see her daughter.  Liberty apologized for being a \"baby\" about losing her hair, so Janet handed Liberty a cap she had knitted for the girl.  Liberty loved it, and she thanked her mom.  They hugged as Dusty watched from outside the room.  When Janet rejoined Dusty, she said the doctors had outlined a protocol for Liberty's study.  A Dr. Bonner found Janet to see if she had any questions, and he explained that the girl would sleep through her first treatment, and then Liberty would be in isolation.  Her family could see and talk with her, but they could not have physical contact with her.\n\n\nThe doctor wrongly assumed that Dusty was Janet's husband, but he agreed with Dusty that Janet should go home and \"recharge her batteries,\" while Liberty slept off the effects of the chemicals.  Janet did not want to leave yet, so Dusty went back to the hospital when Janet went in with Liberty.  She wanted to hold her daughter while she could.  Liberty asked her mother to get some rest, and she put in some good words about Dusty.  Janet told her how much she and Jack loved her, as Liberty drifted off.\n\n\nWhen Dusty returned to the hotel, he was surprised to find Jack in his room.  Jack said he was in his wife's hotel room waiting for her, and he \"invited\" Dusty to leave.  Dusty talked back, and neither man backed down.  Jack and Dusty each thought he could offer Janet something the other couldn't, and then Janet called Dusty on his cell phone.  Dusty arranged to pick her up at the diner across from the hospital.  Jack opened the door and told Dusty to get out.  Dusty claimed he was better for Janet than Jack, because he was actually in love with her.  Janet stood in the open doorway, listening.\n\n\n",
