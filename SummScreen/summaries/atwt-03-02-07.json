    "soap_central": "\n\nAt WOAK, Brad prepares to interview a college basketball coach about March Madness; Kim wonders where Katie is. Brad tells her Katie is \"blue,\" then explains that she has a black eye. Katie runs in and insists she can do the show, but when Kim sees her face, she tells her she can't go on the air like that, and Brad will have to handle it. Jack walks in and overhears this, and after Katie walks away, Jack asks Brad to please take it easy with Katie, because she's been through a lot. Katie leaves and tries to call Henry but has to leave him a message. She returns to the studio after Brad's interview is over, in time to hear him leaving Vienna a message saying they need to resume their romantic encounter and celebrate his TV success. Katie says he apparently hasn't heard the news that his \"hottie\" is leaving the country to avoid being extradited by the Prince of Leonia. Brad says he can't believe Katie's that tacky, and he suggests she get a life and leave his life alone. Katie storms off, upset, and Jack, who again has just walked up, confronts Brad and asks what he just did to Katie. Brad wants to know what Katie means to Jack, and Katie, looking on unnoticed by the brothers, seems interested in hearing Jack's answer.\n\n\nIn the back of the limo, Vienna snuggles against Henry in an effort to warm up. She tries to get him to walk for help, but he refuses; she thinks he'd do it for Katie, and he tells her he would, but Katie would do it for him, too. As he talks about Katie, Vienna wonders what Katie's got that she doesn't have. Henry starts to make a list, and that convinces Vienna that Henry loves Katie. She tells him Katie doesn't look so good today, and hearing about her black eye, Henry gets worried and tries to call Katie. He leaves a message on her phone, then he tells Vienna he and Katie were married once, but he let her go because she wanted Mike more. Vienna thinks that's the most romantic thing she's ever heard, and she tells Henry he's wonderful and deserves to be the sought-after one. He says maybe someday, but she says, \"No, no, no --- not someday! Now!\" and kisses him passionately. He asks if she's sure about this, and she says yes, so they make love in the back of the limo, and Vienna tells Henry he's the \"most amazing lover\" she's ever had. She writes their initials in the window fog and tells him she's falling in love with him. Henry, taken by surprise, tells her she doesn't mean it, because she needs to leave the country before the Prince can find her and take everything she owns away, leaving her to live with Henry \"below the poverty line.\" She says that gives her an idea.\n\n\nOutside Al's Diner, Meg runs into Craig and tells him her boss just gave her a break so she could go move some things from the farm to her motel room. Craig offers to help, saying he happens to have a large vehicle right there that could haul her stuff for her. It dawns on her that Craig might have arranged with her boss to give her some time off, and Craig asks if she'd be grateful and kiss him in thanks if that were true, but she says if that's true, she'd \"never ever\" kiss him. He manages to talk her into letting him help her move her things from the farm to the motel anyway. They go to the Snyder farm, not realizing that Holden and Lily are there.\n\n\nAt the farm, Lily is meeting with Phyllis and Miranda, the 2 women from the baby food company; they are scouting the farm as a location for their baby food ads. Holden comes downstairs, and Lily introduces them, and then they leave to go look around the farm. Holden says he thought Lucinda put the brakes on that project, and Lily becomes angrily defensive, saying she wishes he would stop grilling her about work. Lily admits she's tense, so Holden has her sit down and begins to massage her neck to get rid of the tension. He asks her how she got the funding for the baby food company, and she says every company has discretionary money, and she found some. When he asks where she found it, she says she thinks she hears the women returning, so she goes outside, but it's Craig and Meg. Holden goes inside with Meg and begins questioning her about what she's doing with Craig and why she feels she has to move out of Emma's house. Meg doesn't want to discuss Craig with Holden but tells him she's moving to the Wagon Wheel so she can prove she can stand on her own two feet for a change. She says Craig wants to be her friend, and she's letting him because she can use a friend right now.\n\n\nOutside on the porch, Craig asks Lily how business is going and whether his tips were helpful. She says yes, and when Phyllis and Miranda return, she introduces them to Craig. They say that now, they'd like to shoot a TV commercial on the farm and have Lily and Ethan be the \"face\" of their baby food company. Craig thinks that's a great idea, but Lily says she'll have to call them tonight with her answer. They leave, and Craig says she should do it, and he says Lucinda won't care how it all came about after the company starts making big money for her. Meg and Holden come out, carrying boxes, and Meg gives hers to Craig and asks him to take it to the car. Then she asks Lily to try to get Holden to give her a break and stop thinking she can't handle things; Lily says to give her a couple of decades for that. She tells Meg to be happy, then she goes back inside. When Meg turns to leave, Paul is there. He tells her he had no idea she'd be there, that he came to see how Faith and Parker were doing after the dog attack incident. While he's there, he says he also needs to tell her he still wants her; then he leaves and goes inside to find Lily. He asks how the kids are, and Lily says they're doing okay; he gives her the bracelet Faith dropped in the woods, but she recognizes it as Meg's and says she knew Meg was the real reason he was at the farm. He says he also bought a book for Parker, mainly because he didn't want it to look like his coming to the farm was all about Meg, but then he admits that it's always all about Meg. Holden walks in and rudely tells Paul that Meg's gone, so he can leave now; Lily stops him and walks Paul out to the porch, where she apologizes, saying he's welcome anytime because he saved Faith's life. He thanks her, and she goes back inside, where she tells Holden about the baby food commercial idea. Holden seems to think it's a good idea to have Lily be the spokeswoman for the company, but she asks him not to mention it to her mother just yet. He says he won't, and he tells her he needs to finish some chores, but he'd like to have a \"secret rendezvous\" with her later. Holden leaves. \n\n\nOutside on the porch, sitting over in the corner, Paul sees a small stuffed bear and picks it up; immediately, he gets a flash of something bad and puts it back down. However, he picks it up again, this time holding it longer, and he sees a woman picking up a baby from a crib, with the bear lying by the pillow, and as the woman holds the baby, she screams.\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brad wants to take over Katie's show now that she has a black eye and should not appear on camera. Katie tries to convince Kim to ignore her bruised face, but Kim agrees to let Brad run the show. Lily snaps at Holden again. The women from Valley's Best Baby Food scout the Farm. Craig convinces Meg to let him help her move more stuff to the motel. Vienna deduces Henry is still in love with Katie; she also learns they were married, but he made the ultimate sacrifice when he let her go. This is a huge turn on for her, and she now sees Henry through different eyes, as she throws herself at him. Jack asks Brad to cut Katie some slack. Holden questions Meg's decisions about Craig. Lily and Craig talk business again. The baby food women ask to use the Farm in commercials (a bit more money involved) and want Lily as their spokesperson. Paul and Meg bump into each other and Paul takes a casual approach to her, which surprises Meg. He later admits his feelings to Lily. Vienna becomes obsessed with Henry suddenly. Katie takes pleasure in telling Brad that Vienna is gone, which causes him to snap at her saying harsh things to her. Jack comes down on Brad for this. Brad wonders what Katie means to him, as Katie secretly listens. Lily worries about being in a commercial adding pounds, and she pops more diet pills. Paul has a vision off of the teddy bear Meg touched; it is a crib and someone takes something out of it and then there is a blood- curdling scream.",
