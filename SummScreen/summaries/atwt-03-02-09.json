Katie was worried that something was wrong, but Vienna only wanted to show her how cute she would look in maternity clothes when she was a surrogate and carrying Katie and Brad's baby. Katie reminded her that she had not agreed to go through with the plan, but Vienna insisted she was the answer to Katie's prayers. Katie admitted she had not yet talked to Brad about it, but Vienna was eager to get the process started. Katie asked if Vienna had told Henry about the baby, but her friend said she would handle it when the right time came. \n\n\nBrad called Henry to come to the house because he needed his help in filling out paperwork for an adoption agency. Henry realized Katie did not know about Brad's thoughts on adoption yet, but Brad was sure it was the next best thing if he and Katie could not have their own child. They worked on the papers until they heard Katie arriving, so Brad stashed them away. Henry lied and said he was there to watch the poker world championships on television, but he decided to go home instead. Katie was confused, but Henry's behavior was typical for him. \n\n\nKatie was glad Henry left early because she wanted to talk to her husband alone. She reminded him there were several ways they could have a family, and she wanted to explore some other options. Brad thought she was referring to adoption, so he told her he had already gotten the process rolling. Katie was surprised and asked if Vienna had spoken with him, but Brad asked why Vienna would have anything to do with it. He said he had talked to Henry, however, and Henry had actually been there to help fill out the paperwork. \n\n\nBrad produced the papers and the two of them continued to talk at cross-purposes. Finally, Brad mentioned the adoption agency. Katie was disappointed and explained that Vienna had offered to be a surrogate and carry their baby. Brad was stunned that their good friend was willing to do that for them. \n\n\nLuke and Noah went to the diner, where Elwood confronted Luke about breaking into his dorm room. Elwood was feeling sorry that he had dropped the charges against Luke, but Luke suggested Elwood did not want the cops to see what Luke had already found in Elwood's room. He mentioned the mysterious \"M\" who had signed the note that told Elwood he was \"covered.\" Luke promised that as soon as the police positively identified \"M,\" Elwood would be the next arrest. Elwood left, and Luke told Noah that all they had to do was get a confession from Elwood that the police could use. Luke thought Elwood reacted strangely when he said they knew who \"M\" was. \n\n\nKevin entered the diner and asked about Casey. Luke told him Casey was innocent, but they were sure Elwood had killed Reg while he was working for Matt O'Connor. Elwood called Luke, and he was upset. He said he did know something about what was happening to Casey, but he was fearful he might get in trouble with the police and have to return to prison. Luke offered to help and implored Elwood to tell him what he knew. Elwood asked instead to meet Luke at the bridge on Mill Road. Luke agreed and hung up. He told Noah and Kevin that they had Elwood. Noah begged Luke to call the police and not to get involved himself, but Luke felt he owed it to Casey to help prove him innocent. \n\n\nAt the police station, Alison visited Casey, who was still worried that Matt might hurt her while Casey was incarcerated. He urged her to stay away from Matt, and reminded her that Matt had been a drug user in prison. Alison defended her friend to Casey and accused Casey of going after Matt because Matt liked her. She was worried that they were letting their personal feelings get in the way of catching someone who could kill again. Alison took a call from Luke, who told her about Elwood's call and the rendezvous on the bridge. Luke told her she could tell Casey, but asked her not to tell anyone else. \n\n\nNoah announced to Luke that he was going with him to meet Elwood. He said he loved Luke and did not want him to get hurt. The two of them went to the bridge and waited for Elwood. Finally the boy appeared and began walking towards them on the bridge. A car appeared suddenly and sped over the bridge, forcing Elwood over the side. The boys ran to the side and saw Elwood's body on the rocks below. They ran down the bank and tried to revive him, but they could find no pulse. Noah called 9-1-1, while Luke began CPR. \n\n\nMatt called Alison and said he was running late for their lunch date at the diner. Alison hinted that there might be some good news when she saw him. When Matt pressed for more details, she said she had promised Luke that she wouldn't say anything, but then she decided Matt would not tell anyone else, so she mentioned that Luke was on his way to the bridge on Mill Road to meet Elwood, who was going to \"come clean.\" Matt agreed that was good news, but hung up looking worried. \n\n\nVienna told Henry that she had made a decision; she had decided to help Brad and Katie have a baby. Henry was pleased and said he had chosen to help them, as well. In fact, he explained, he had already helped Brad that day. Vienna misunderstood Henry's intentions and told him she was going to be Brad and Katie's surrogate. Henry flipped out and argued that she had no idea what changes her body would go through with a pregnancy. She mentioned her desire to carry a baby and her always-raging hormones, but Henry told her to fight, fight, fight those hormones! Vienna could not understand why Henry would deny her that one passion. \n\n\nAlison waited at the diner for Matt, and she was surprised when Mark Viro, her attacker from Halloween night, walked in. He told her he had spent some time in a psych ward, but was getting progressively better. He thanked her and Casey for talking him off the hospital roof, and apologized for hurting her. Kevin arrived and told Alison he, too, wanted to apologize for what had happened to her during the school election campaign. \n\n\nKevin went to sit with Mark and asked him if Alison had accepted his apology. He was pleased that she had accepted both their apologies, but he cautioned Mark to leave Alison alone. He was upset when Mark appeared interested in Alison in a romantic way. Matt dashed into the diner, apologizing that he was late. He was upset because someone had stolen his car. \n\n\nAt the scene of the accident, Luke and Noah watched paramedics load Elwood's body into the ambulance. Margo was there, as well, and questioned the boys about what had happened. Margo understood that it was Elwood's idea to meet at the bridge, and Noah described the accident and said it appeared that the driver had aimed the car directly at Elwood. Noah described the vehicle as a gray SUV, so Margo put out an all points bulletin on it. The boys wanted to leave, but Margo said if Elwood was really murdered, they were her only witnesses and she wasn't through with them. \n\n\nBack at the station, Margo continued her queries. The boys thought the driver was a man, but neither one saw the license plate well. Noah was able to remember a couple of numbers at the end of the plate, so Margo went with that. Casey asked what was going on, so Margo let him go into the interview room with his friends. Luke broke the news that someone had killed Elwood on the bridge. Casey was shocked, and Luke said he was sorry he had not gotten the information from Elwood sooner. Noah announced that he was the only one who got it; Reg's death was an accident, but whoever was driving that car had murdered Elwood. \n\n\nMatt told Alison he had not reported his car stolen because he was an ex-con. Alison would not accept that and took him under her wing and insisted they go to the station and report his missing car. At the station, Alison spoke to an officer who suggested that Matt begin filling out a report. Alison saw her friends in the interview room and went in. She asked if they had learned anything important from Elwood, and Casey had to tell her that Elwood was dead. Noah said the death was not an accident, as Margo walked in and told them that the car that hit Elwood was registered to Matt O'Connor. \n\n\nCasey pumped his fist with jubilation, but Alison quickly told them all that Matt's car had been stolen earlier in the afternoon, and that was why they were at the station. She went out to bring in Matt to verify her story, but he was gone. Casey was excited that there was evidence to link Matt to the crimes. No one could understand, however, how Matt would have known that Elwood was meeting the boys on the Mill Road bridge. Alison admitted she had told Matt, so Margo said she would put out a pick up order for Matt. She also would not allow Alison to leave before answering more questions. \n\n\nBrad told Katie he felt weird that Vienna would be carrying their child. He was concerned that she would feel like its mother for nine months and not be able to give it to them after she delivered. Katie said they would do everything legally, with signed papers and all the bells and whistles. Brad still voted for adoption as his first choice, but Katie really wanted to try surrogacy first, and Brad loved her so much, he agreed. Katie's heart was set on having a baby from the two of them, so she thanked and hugged him. \n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and when Katie opened it, Vienna said, \"Hello, Mama.\" Henry, however, looked numb and said not a word. The women chatted, but Henry was like a zombie and simply followed Vienna out. Katie was ecstatic that she was going to be a mother.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Vienna wants to push full steam ahead with plans to be Katie's surrogate, but Katie is still not sure. Brad asks for Henry's help filling out paperwork to start adoption proceedings; he doesn't want to push Katie yet, but when she is ready, he wants to be all set. Katie finally talks to Brad about their other options, as Brad thinks she is talking about adoption and Katie thinks he is talking about surrogacy. They have their signals crossed, but finally they understand what each is talking about. Brad is unsure and worried about Vienna carrying a baby for nine months and giving to them, as Katie tries to get him to see she would like to go this route first because it is the closest option to giving him their own baby. Brad finally agrees, but reminds her that Henry has to be on board too. Vienna talks to Henry about helping Brad and Katie, as their signals get crossed too, and he thinks she is just talking about adoption paperwork while she thinks he realizes what she wants to do. Finally, they also understand what each other wants to do, as Henry is not on board at all at first, but Vienna can be convincing. Henry and Vienna come over to Brad and Katie's with news that they are all on the same page. Katie and Vienna are thrilled, as Brad and Henry look much more unsure. Luke continues to push Elwood about what he knows and even reveals about knowing about \u0091M'. Later, an anxious Elwood calls Luke and wants to meet to tell him what he knows. Kevin and Noah hear this; Noah worries about Luke's involvement, but Luke is adamant they have to do this for Casey, as Noah wants to go with him. Luke tells Alison, who in turn happily tells Matt, thinking he is about to be cleared. Luke and Noah show up to meet Elwood, and as they see him walking towards them, an SUV drives towards him knocking Elwood over the bridge. Despite Luke and Noah's efforts, Elwood dies. When Margo questions them, Noah is able to remember part of the plate. Mark Vero is back from the psychiatric hospital and when he sees Alison, he approaches her to apologize. Mark seems stuck on Alison, which doesn't go unnoticed by Kevin when they meet; he reminds him Alison would never be interested in him because he tried to rape her. Matt is late to meet Alison and explains that his car was stolen. Luke and Noah break the bad news to Casey about how Elwood is dead. Alison brings Matt into fill out a report, as she goes into talk with Casey, Luke and Noah. She learns the bad news, but then Margo tells them that the car, which drove at Elwood, was traced to Matt. No one can figure out how he knew where they were meeting until they realize Alison told him. Alison still defends Matt until she realizes he is no longer at the station. An emotional Alison angrily wonders if Casey is waiting for an \u0091I told you so'. Casey wants to comfort her, but he pulls back and doesn't.",
