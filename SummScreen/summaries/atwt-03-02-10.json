    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLily read the City Times newspaper, which featured a story and photo called \"Deadly Triangle.\"  It was about Lily, Holden, and Damian, and it disturbed Lily.  She phoned Faith at boarding school, but fortunately the girl had not seen the paper.  Faith said she was busy studying for midterms, and she asked about her father.  Lily was hopeful that Holden would not be in jail much longer.  Faith did not agree with her mother when Lily pointed out that it would be helpful if Faith returned home to support her dad.  The girl was reluctant to bail on her exams since she had arrived halfway through the school year, but she promised instead to be home right after exams.\n\n\nFaith hung up, and Miss Gibson, the head of school, called out to her.  The administrator informed Faith that they had found marijuana in the girl's locker, but Faith denied any involvement.  She said she did not smoke pot, and she blamed several other students by name.  Miss Gibson said that Faith was very lucky because her father had \"intervened\" on her behalf, and then Damian walked up behind Faith and provided support.\n\n\nDamian thanked Miss Gibson and asked to speak to his \"daughter\" alone.  Faith tried to protest that Damian was not her father, but he kept her quiet with a veiled threat.  The two of them walked away, and Faith insisted to Damian that he was supposed to be dead because Holden was in jail for his murder.  Damian reminded the girl that she was suspended from school for a while automatically because of the drug bust, and therefore she could not stay in the dorm.  She had nowhere to go except with him.  Faith threatened to call the police, but Damian warned her to cooperate.\n\n\nDamian put Faith in his car and said that he had helped her out of trouble because he was her stepfather, and he loved her.  Faith begged him to go back to Oakdale to free Holden, but Damian said that no one could know that he was still alive.  It had to do with a Grimaldi \"cousin\" who was trying to kill Damian and set up Holden to take the fall.  Faith took out her phone, but Damian convinced her that his \"cousin\" had probably tapped Lily's phone, and a call from Faith would put her mother in jeopardy.  He also said he didn't blame her for rebelling against the school, and Faith admitted that she had smoked a little pot.\n\n\nAfter that admission, Faith heard Damian say that she would never have to go back to the school, and her parents would never need to know about the drugs.  He also advised her that her folks could not know that he was still alive.  Just then, Faith's phone rang, and the caller was Molly.  Molly said she was calling about Holden and she told Faith that her dad really needed everyone to rally around.  Molly offered to pick up Faith at school and take her back to Oakdale, but a flippant Faith said she wouldn't blow off her science exam for her mother, so she certainly wasn't about to do it for her father's girlfriend.  Faith said she would get there when she got there and hung up.\n\n\nAt the police station, Molly arrived and kissed Holden.  She discussed the strong possibility that the body in Malta was not Damian, and Holden reminded her that Damian had never wanted to live in Oakdale, and since he was officially \"dead,\" he could be anywhere in the world.  Holden continued that there was one thing, however, which Damian would not leave without, and Molly said, \"Lily.\" She reasoned that Damian had goaded Holden into attacking him on the docks, because he knew that Holden would not actually kill him.  Damian had gambled, but it had paid off.\n\n\nHolden reckoned that some seaman on the ship had lost his life for Damian's plot, and Molly said that she had a source at the Port Authority who could get her access to personnel files.  Holden warned her to be careful, and the two of them began kissing, as Lily walked in and challenged Molly's presence there. Holden said that he needed the two women to work together since Lily knew how Damian thought and Molly had the contacts to verify leads.  Lily found it hard to believe that Damian would have killed someone to fake his own death, but Molly disagreed.  They began arguing, until Molly left to make some calls.\n\n\nLily told Holden that she had taken the kids to visit him, and that bothered him.  He asked about Faith, and Lily said she was pleased that their daughter was taking her studies so seriously.  Holden played with Natalie and Ethan for a bit, and then he sent them out and told Lily to take the kids immediately and leave town.  He said that Damian was dangerous and was not about to give Lily up.  Lily refused to go as far away as Montega to visit Sierra, and she vowed they were going to stick together.\n\n\nIn the hotel in Minneapolis, Craig scolded Carly for misleading him into thinking that she was serious about relocating Monte Carlo to that city.  He protested that he had better things to do than be duped, as Carly phoned the front desk and asked what room Janet Snyder was in.  Carly also reminded Craig that he had invited himself along on the junket, and she agreed with his scenario that Jack would discover Dusty in a room with Janet, and then Jack would invite Carly back into his arms.  Carly claimed that she and Jack loved each other too much for it to play out any other way.  \"Well, good for you,\" grumbled Craig.\n\n\nThen Craig reminded Carly that Jack was still married to Janet, and her answer was to head for the door, but Craig stopped her.  Carly said she really needed to know what was going on, and particularly if Janet was \"playing the leukemia card again.\"  Craig said that Janet needed Jack, \"who already had one foot out the door.\"  Carly claimed that she had backed off from Jack and had \"respected his marriage,\" but Craig said that truce obviously was over.\n\n\nJanet returned from the hospital and found a verbal sparring match between Jack and Dusty going on in her hotel room.  Jack ordered Dusty out of the room, but Dusty refused.  Janet spoke up, but Jack cut her off by declaring that he \"knew\" everything.  Janet asked Dusty to go call the hospital to check on Liberty's status, and she assured him that she would be fine with Jack.  Dusty walked out, and Janet began to speak badly of Carly, but Jack wasn't hearing it.  Finally Janet admitted that she had slept with Dusty only one night, and that was the very night that Jack was \"holed up in a cabin with Carly.\"  They continued to argue, as Janet maintained that there had always been three people in their marriage from the beginning.\n\n\nJack said that he knew Dusty was in love with Janet, but he wanted to know how she felt about Dusty.  He wondered where he and Janet stood, and he said he was there because Brad couldn't be.  Janet said she couldn't worry about Jack's feelings while her daughter was fighting for her life, and she considered Dusty \"a caring friend.\"\n\n\nCarly started out the door of her hotel room, but she stopped instantly when she saw Dusty at the end of her hall on his cell phone.  Craig peeked around her and said, \"Hmmmm, the gang's all here.\"  Dusty moved on, and Carly returned to her room.  Craig told her that Jack would never leave Janet, and Carly was afraid that Jack would throw away the rest of his life out of obligation.  Craig told Carly to \"move on,\" but instead she grabbed her overnight bag and disappeared into the bathroom.  Craig saw Carly's cell phone on the desk, so he pocketed it.  Then he disconnected the room phone, and stole the cord before he walked out the door.  He got some plastic rope from the maid's cart in the hall and rigged Carly's door so that she could not open it from the inside.\n\n\nCarly emerged from the bathroom wearing a sexy red dress, but she could not open the door into the hall.  She hollered for Craig and then tried to use the \"cordless\" phone.  Lastly, she dived into her purse for her cell, but she realized that Craig had been very thorough.  Carly pounded on the door and screamed.\n\n\nCraig went down to the bar and found Dusty drowning his sorrows there.  He asked the bartender to serve Dusty a beer so he would have \"something to cry in.\"  Dusty asked why Craig was there, so Craig explained that he was there to \"facilitate reconciliation between Janet and Jack.\"  Dusty told him to mind his own business, but Craig said the outcome of the fiasco affected him greatly.  Craig called Dusty \"the sideshow, not the main event,\" as Dusty finished his drink and continued to insult Craig.  Finally, Dusty walked out, with Craig on his heels.\n\n\nWhen someone knocked on Janet's door, Jack assumed it was Dusty and said, \"Right on cue.\"  He was stunned to open the door and find Carly in her red dress.  Jack asked her for time alone with Janet, but Carly said, \"Sorry, Jack, but that's not happening.\"  Carly walked in and said that she had run out of patience waiting for Jack to \"work things out.\"  She also claimed that she had every right to be part of the discussion, to which Janet replied, \"I don't think so.\"  Dusty and Craig arrived, and Janet asked if she was the only one who remembered why they were all in Minneapolis.  Carly said it was not helping Liberty or any of them to \"pretend.\"  She declared that \"the situation\" had to end.\n\n\nDusty agreed that it was appropriate \"to clear the air,\" since they were all there.  Carly said that Janet didn't know that she and Jack had put aside their feelings because of Liberty's illness and because she thought Janet was a \"loyal and honest\" person.  It turned out, however, that Janet was more Dusty's lover than Jack's wife.  Janet was shocked to learn that Jack had been on his way to tell her that he and Carly were back together and that he wanted a divorce when Janet had announced Liberty's cancer.  \"Oh, my God,\" exclaimed Janet, looking at Dusty, \"everybody knew except me!\"\n\n\nCarly thought it was good that everything was out in the open; Dusty loved Janet, and Jack wanted Carly, so they could just \"shift.\"  Craig spoke up, but Jack shut him down.  Janet asked everyone to leave, and Jack informed Carly that included her, as well.  Dusty, Craig, and Carly filed out into the hall, as Craig quipped, \"That went well.\"\n\n\nJack apologized to Janet for Carly's bursting in, but Janet only wanted to know if what Carly had said was true.  Janet then called Jack \"an even bigger liar,\" but Jack answered that he had chosen to be with Janet and had wanted their marriage to work.  Janet was crushed that her husband had returned to her because her daughter was in crisis and out of guilt for causing Brad's death.  Janet said she didn't know how she felt about Dusty, and she asked Jack if he was in love with Carly.  Jack answered yes, and Janet began to weep.  She asked Jack for an annulment and asked him to go.  As he was leaving, Janet stood up and stated that they were going to have a baby for a bone marrow match for Liberty, no matter what.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Dusty declared he was getting a drink, as Carly asked why Craig was still there.  Craig said he still wanted to look at warehouses, but Carly said she was going to her room because Jack would be looking for her after he ended it with Janet.  Carly waited impatiently in her room, and finally she opened the mini-bar, but she took out a chocolate bar instead of something alcoholic.\n\n\nJanet packed her bag and sadly took off her wedding ring.  She put it in the bag and began sobbing.\n\n\nJack walked down a residential street and attempted to remove his wedding band, but it was stuck and he couldn't budge it.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Holden and Molly think that Damian faked his death because he wanted Holden to be blamed for his murder and the best way to do that was to provoke a fight with Holden at the docks and then kill someone so he could use the body and claim that Holden had killed him.
