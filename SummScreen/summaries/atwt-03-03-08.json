Susan explained that the boys were lucky that Holden and Lily arrived when they did and were able to help them get away from their attackers. After Susan walked away, Holden and Lily questioned if Colonel Mayer or Ameera had set up the boys or planned their attack. After their discussion, Holden and Lily decided to talk to Ameera about the assault. She admitted that the attack was her fault because she was the one who talked the boys into going to the prison to visit Noah's dad. Lily and Holden were not sure that was the extent of her involvement, so they asked Ameera directly if she had helped the Colonel hire the men who beat up Luke and Noah. Ameera denied any involvement in the attack against the boys and explained that the two men were after her and that Luke and Noah were defending her, and the fight escalated when the men learned that Noah and Luke were gay. Lily apologized for implying that Ameera was involved and everyone prepared for Luke and Noah to be released from the hospital. \n\n\nBonnie arrived at the television station looking for Brad, but literally tripped over her unconscious friend as he lay on the station floor. At first, Bonnie thought Brad was playing a joke on her, but she quickly realized that Brad was out cold. Matt, Brad's attacker, was stuck in the station and tried to stay out of Bonnie's sight. As he hid from the pair, Matt unknowingly leaned up against a recently painted logo for the station, leaving WOAK across the back of his pants. After a few moments, Bonnie was able to wake Brad up, but when he did not remember what happened she phoned 9-1-1 for an ambulance. She returned to Brad and he stated that he thought he knew who knocked him out. \n\n\nBonnie and Brad arrived at the hospital as Holden was waiting for the boys to be discharged. As Brad was whisked away to receive medical attention, Holden told Bonnie about the attack on Luke and Noah. When Holden revealed that he and Lily would be taking the boys home together, Bonnie concluded that Holden and Lily were reunited. Holden admitted he was back with his wife and Bonnie was happy for her former client. She confessed that she always knew he and Lily belonged together. As Bonnie hugged Holden goodbye, Lily came into the hall and saw the end of their encounter. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Katie was also out cold after Kit, thinking she was Carly, knocked her unconscious. When Kit realized her mistake she tried to make a run from the house, but was forced to hide when Carly returned home. Carly went to the kitchen and found Katie passed out. As she tried to wake Katie up, Jack arrived to talk to Carly, and she explained that she had found Katie unconscious on the kitchen floor. The two rushed back to the kitchen to help Katie just as Kit snuck out undetected. Jack revived Katie who suffered a terrible headache from the blow to the head. Carly and Jack decided that Katie had to go to the hospital and immediately took her to Memorial. \n\n\nJack arrived at Memorial with Katie and, due to overcrowding in the emergency room, Susan placed her into a room where Brad and Bonnie were waiting for Brad to recover from his injuries. Brad was overly concerned about Katie, and Jack told his brother to back off and let Susan examine her. During her examination, Katie asked Brad why he was at the hospital and learned that he had also been attacked. When she questioned how Bonnie came upon Brad, she found out that Brad had called Bonnie for a date. Katie was surprised Brad had a date, but told him he was lucky Bonnie stumbled on him. Jack became convinced that Katie and Brad's attacks might be linked and wanted to learn more, but Susan interrupted and asked everyone to let her finish Katie's exam. \n\n\nOut in the hall of the hospital, Margo ran in looking for her sister and learned from Jack that Katie was fine and Kit was probably the one behind her attack. Jack explained that Kit probably thought Katie was Carly and that Kit was after Carly because they had accused Kit of killing Sam. Margo was angry with Jack for his continued attempts to get Kit to confess to Sam's murder regardless of whom he put in danger. She told Jack to stop interfering and let the police handle the investigation before more innocent people got hurt. Margo told Jack that she would put Carly under 24-hour protection, but Jack did not want Kit to be scared away by the police. Margo rejected Jack's suggestion that he would protect Carly and told him she couldn't afford another murder on her watch. \n\n\nWhen Susan finished examining Katie, she found Margo and told her Katie would be fine. Margo went to visit her sister and noticed that Brad had also been assaulted. She explained that she did not think the crimes were related, but would look into it. Both Brad and Katie were released from Memorial with instructions to not sleep for the next eight hours due to their concussions. Margo wanted to take Katie home with her, but Katie told her sister she would go back to the Lakeview and would have the front desk call her every hour to make sure she wasn't asleep. Margo left Brad and Katie alone and they talked about their earlier sexual encounter-before they were attacked. The two kissed and Brad became light headed, but joked he always got that way around Katie. As the two prepared to kiss again they were interrupted when Jack and Bonnie returned to the room to take Katie and Brad home. \n\n\nJack took Katie back to the Lakeview and offered to stay with her through the night to make sure she was all right. She told him to focus on Parker and said that she would be fine. He apologized for losing her money and for the attack, but Katie just smiled, held Jack's hand and told him that she loved his family. She explained she was glad that she was hit instead of Parker, but Jack told her that Carly was Kit's target, not Parker. Katie decided to send Jack on his way, but not before he admitted that he still cared for her-yet always seemed to get her hurt. Katie sadly agreed it was best for her to stay far away from Jack and his family. \n\n\nAfter being released from the hospital, Brad convinced Bonnie to take him to Yo's for a drink. Bonnie explained to Brad that she knew he was still hung up on Katie and she wasn't interested in being his rebound. She told Brad to wait for Jack to return to Carly for his real chance with Katie. She left Brad at the bar after telling him to call her if he wanted a real date. \n\n\nBrad went to Katie's to see her, but Katie refused to let him into her room because she knew if she did they would probably end up in bed together again. \n\n\nOut at the Snyder farm, Noah, Luke, Ameera, Lily, and Holden returned from the hospital and explained the attack to Faith. She was shocked that the boys were hurt for loving one another, but the family reassured her everything would be all right. After the family discussion, Holden and Lily went to the porch where Lily questioned Holden about his past relationship with Bonnie. Lily told Holden that she wondered if he regretted letting Bonnie go, but Holden said he wanted to be with Lily-unless she did not think their marriage would last. Lily explained to Holden that she didn't want him to feel like he had to stay in their marriage, but Holden said he did not feel that way. Their talk was interrupted when Carly arrived looking for Parker. Holden went inside to find Parker, and left Carly and Lily alone to talk. \n\n\nCarly questioned if things were okay between the two, and Lily admitted that her reconciliation with Holden had stalled because she couldn't \"be\" with him because of her sadness over Dusty's murder. Carly reassured Lily that Holden would wait for her and told her to take her time. Parker came out to the porch to find out why his mother was there as Kit lurked in the trees outside the porch listening to their conversation. \n\n\nCarly detailed for Parker the facts behind Katie's attack and as they talked, Parker got a feeling that there was someone watching him and his mother. Carly sent Parker back into the house and decided to look around the farm to see who was spying on them. As she walked outside, Jack arrived and startled Carly. He said he had just looked around and the farm was secure. Carly told Jack that he could go be with Katie if she needed him, but Jack said he wanted to make sure Carly was safe from Kit. \n\n\nBack in the farmhouse, Ameera explained that she would soon be forced to return to Iraq when her visa expired. Faith suggested that maybe Ameera could get a student visa and stay in Oakdale. The family explained that Lucinda, who was on Oakdale University's Board of Directors, might be able to persuade the university to let Ameera in quickly. Ameera was relieved at the prospect of staying in the United States. The kids decided to go on a hayride to celebrate Faith's idea and left Lily and Holden to discuss their marriage. Lily asked if she was enough for Holden, and he told her she was and he would wait for her. \n\n\nJack and Carly returned to Carly's house as Margo arrived and told them she had placed a police unit outside of Carly's house to protect her. Jack and Carly knew that Kit would not return if the police were watching and began to fear they may not be able to prove Parker's innocence in Sam's murder. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Alison found Casey back at work and questioned why he had returned to his job so soon after getting stitches. Casey told her that he had to fill in for Matt after Matt failed to show up for work. Alison asked Casey if he felt that Matt was acting strange and if he had noticed Matt had any special client at work. Casey dismissed Alison's comment with a laugh, as Matt returned and explained his tardiness by saying he had been to the bank. As Matt turned to wash up, Alison and Casey noticed the WOAK logo on the back of Matt's pants. Casey had a good chuckle at his friend's misfortune, but Alison thought the entire thing looked suspicious. After Alison left, Matt and Casey discussed Alison's suspicions of Matt's behavior, and Matt told Casey that nothing weird was going on. Casey admitted to Matt that he was tired of lying to everyone and wanted to tell his friends and family that he and Matt had met in prison. Matt angrily told Casey that he would not tell anyone where or how they first met. Matt apologized for yelling at Casey, but told him he didn't want people to know about his past. As they continued their talk, Margo walked in and heard Matt tell Casey he would tell everyone the truth soon. Margo questioned Matt about what he would be telling everyone. Matt told Margo that he persuaded Casey to return to college. She was overjoyed with the news and congratulated her son before returning to work. Casey was angry that Matt had lied to Margo again, but the two didn't have time to discuss it, because Matt rushed out after Alison. \n\n\nAlison went to see her mother at the hospital and learned that Brad had been attacked at the television station. Susan detailed the attack, but excused herself to get back to work just as Matt arrived to ask Alison out on another date. Alison questioned if she could trust Matt and he told her she could, so Alison accepted the date, but watched Matt skeptically as he returned to work.  \n\n\n",
