    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the first day back to work at Memorial for both of them, Lucy asked Meg for scheduling information, and Meg told her about an updated procedure. Dusty walked in and confused Meg, who thought he was there to wish her well. Dusty corrected her by saying he had come to see Lucy. He asked Lucy if she had made any progress convincing Craig to let him see Johnny, but Lucy said she could not rush her father, since he didn't even trust her alone with the boy. Lucy had not forgotten her bargain with Dusty: her freedom from kidnapping charges in exchange for regular visits with Johnny for Dusty. \n\n\nAs Lucy was leaving, Dusty grabbed her arm and said her answers weren't good enough. Lucy said her brother's absence had left a gaping hole in her life, too. She received a page, and left. Meg grabbed Dusty on his way out and invited him to meet her at the Lakeview for a drink after her shift. Dusty accepted reluctantly. \n\n\nPaul and Eliza, with the court-appointed supervisor in tow, found Emily in Old Town, and Paul and his daughter joined her. The supervisor sat nearby so she could observe. Paul said he was planning to win Meg back so the three of them could be a family again. Emily said that was a whacko idea, but Paul was convinced that Meg had been jealous when she had spotted him with his hired companion. The supervisor reminded Paul that it was time to take Eliza back to the farm, so Paul said goodbye to Emily and left. \n\n\nCraig called on Carly to explain that he had convinced Stan, a buyer who had attended Carly's launch of the Midnight Sun vodka, to give their business a second chance. Stan, however, had requested another tasting before he would place an order, and he particularly requested that Carly be present. She said she was surprised at that, since she had nearly puked on his shoes. She told Craig she would only agree if he would be there, as well. Craig said he had a sitter arranged for Johnny for a couple of hours, but Carly suggested that he get someone who would love to be with his son for as long as they needed -Lucy. Craig was hesitant because of Lucy's closeness to Dusty, but Carly taunted Craig by saying that he couldn't stand the thought that Johnny liked someone better than Craig. She handed him the phone, and he agreed to call his daughter. \n\n\nMeg finished her shift and went home. She took off her shirt in the kitchen as Paul walked in unannounced, with the baby. Meg was startled but glad to see her daughter. Paul asked about her day at work and then wanted to know why she was dressing to go out again. Meg told him she was celebrating the day with drinks at the Lakeview with a friend. She assured him Eliza would be fine because Emma was watching her, but Paul persisted with his questions. Finally Meg said she was meeting Dusty, but it was not a date, and besides, it was none of Paul's business. Paul walked out and was visibly upset by Meg's answers. \n\n\nPaul went directly to Emily's office and demanded that she go to dinner with him at the Lakeview. Emily already knew Meg was going to be there and told Paul his scheme was childish. Paul was hoping Emily had some other clothes in her office that would make her look \"hotter,\" but she told him not to push it. \n\n\nIn the lobby of the hotel, Craig and Johnny waited for Lucy. When she arrived, Craig asked how her first day back had gone, and then he asked her, if she was not too tired, if she would like to babysit Johnny while Craig went to a business meeting with Carly. Lucy was delighted, and she accepted immediately. Craig made her promise that she would not leave the Lakeview, and she agreed. Lucy took Johnny to Craig's room, and picked up the phone to call room service, but instead she called Dusty. She invited him to join them if he had no other plans, and Dusty jumped at the chance to see his boy. He asked how Craig felt about the arrangements, so Lucy had to admit that her father did not know that Dusty would be included. Dusty was not happy, but he wanted to see Johnny. \n\n\nAt Metro, Carly waited for Craig and poured Stan a shot of Midnight Sun. She touted their bottle shape and the designer label, which Stan admired. It was obvious that was not all Stan admired, because when Carly got up to fetch an order contract, Stan leapt to his feet, called her \"Sweetheart,\" and planted a big kiss on her. Craig walked in at that moment and pulled Carly away. Next, he punched Stat in the face, much to Carly's amazement. Cragi threw Stan out of Metro, but Carly was disappointed to lose his business. Craig blamed himself for putting Carly in an awkward position and got on his high horse by proclaiming that Neanderthals were not allowed to kiss his business partner. He made Carly laugh by declaring that all prospective buyers who wanted to kiss Carly would have to kiss him, too. \n\n\nEmily and Paul walked into the Lakeview lounge and saw Meg waiting for Dusty. Meg didn't believe that Paul was there by coincidence, and she told them whom she was meeting. Emily went on to the bar, and Paul lingered to thank Meg for allowing him to have time with Eliza. He was unhappy that Meg had changed into a sexy dress, and grumbled about that to Emily. Emily said if he wanted to make Meg jealous, he had to be proactive. She leaned over and kissed Paul on the lips as Meg watched. \n\n\nIn Craig's room, Johnny was excited that his Daddy Dusty was coming. Lucy cautioned him to keep that a secret from Daddy Craig, and the boy agreed. Dusty arrived and he and Johnny gave each other big hugs. Dusty had brought another train for his son, and only then he remembered his agreement to meet Meg for drinks. He called her and cancelled their meeting, so Meg pretended she was still at the farm and assured him she was not upset. \n\n\nMeg approached Emily and Paul at the bar and told them they could not possibly expect her to be jealous. She referred to Paul's hooker from the previous encounter and linked Emily to that same category. She warned Emily that Paul was using her and walked out. Paul was encouraged that his plan was working. \n\n\nDusty, Lucy, and Johnny played goofy games, and Lucy pushed Dusty down on the couch and fell on top of him. Johnny jumped between them, and they all laughed. It was bedtime, so Dusty sent his son to put on his pajamas. He also told Lucy that no matter what a court had said, he was the boy's father. Lucy understood and said that she felt like Johnny's mother. She sadly observed that the two of them were playing parents to a child who didn't really belong to either of them. \n\n\nCraig called Lucy's cell phone, but she chose not to answer. She regretted that almost immediately, however, and was afraid that would bring her father running. She told Dusty to leave, and she called Craig back and said she had been helping Johnny brush his teeth and could not get to the phone. Her father asked her to stay even longer, and Lucy said to take his time because she would crash on his couch. \n\n\nCraig hung around Metro, so Carly asked him why. He poured her another shot of vodka and proposed a toast to himself as a hero for decking Stan. They drank, but Carly was ready to go home. Craig, however, said they had business to do and suggested they pull an all-nighter. They needed to finalize the label design so that the printer could begin production. Craig offered to bring Johnny to Carly's house for the night, but Carly wanted to work alone. She thanked Craig for stopping Stan, and he said goodnight. By herself, Carly poured another drink. \n\n\nMeg heard a knock on the door at the farm, and she assumed it was Paul, so she began yelling at him. When she opened the door, however, there stood Dusty. He apologized for standing her up and asked to come in. He explained he had forsaken her for a really good reason: Johnny. He said he had spent the time with Johnny and Lucy. Meg was more interested in the fact that Dusty had to go through Lucy to see his boy until Craig came around. Dusty was amused that Meg seemed jealous, although Meg denied it. Dusty unexpectedly grabbed her and kissed her. \n\n\nPaul and Emily drank at Fairwinds, and Emily sprayed seltzer on her blouse, so she took it off. Paul looked at her and said, \"Wow. You're hot.\" She took the seltzer bottle and sprayed Paul and laughingly told him to back off. He gave her a sweater to wear home, and they discussed going out together again. Emily said she would consider it.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "It's Meg's first day back on the job at the hospital and she shares some information with Lucy on her first day too. Dusty stops by and Lucy tries to avoid anything personal. She does say that Johnny was her whole life and now there is a big hole there. Meg notices the tension between them, but she accepts Dusty's invitation to go out and celebrate her first day back. Emily laments to Paul that she thinks he is whacko for thinking Meg will give him another chance. He insists that she still cares and if she does there is some chance. Paul drops by the farm and is so smooth and polite in thanking Meg for letting him spend time with their daughter. He then dashes to Emily's and asks her out for a night at the Lakeview. They both know Meg will be there with Dusty so if Paul manages to push her buttons, great! Lucy is over the top to be staying with Johnny, never mind that it was Carly's idea. She calls Dusty to give him this opportunity to come and spend time with Johnny. It's all she can do for now, they have to be patient. He brings Johnny a gift and they have a great time playing. Lucy reminisces but Dusty says they can not go back. Dusty calls Meg to break their date. She's already at the Lakeview, but stops on her way out to confront Paul and Emily who have shown up and are conducting a little love session at the bar. She knows it is for her benefit, but states this jealousy bit won't work. Alone with Stan for a few minutes, Carly is greeted by a slick move and an unwanted kiss. Craig arrives just in time to punch him in the mouth. He tells Stan to get out, they are no longer partners. He quips to Carly anyone else that wants to kiss her will have to kiss him first. Dusty drops by the farm and Meg is not too receptive, but he barges on in. He even confesses where he really was with Johnny. She realizes this means every time he sees Johnny that Lucy will be there too. He knows that Meg is jealous and takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her. At Paul's, he gloats that Meg was just using Dusty to get to him. Emily spills her drink and rips off her blouse, but tells Paul not to get ideas. Craig makes a toast with Carly since he was the hero tonight, a chance to celebrate. He's like to pull an all-nighter with her, but she nixes that idea since he has Johnny to think off. She thanks him for saving her from Stan and gulps another slug of vodka.",
