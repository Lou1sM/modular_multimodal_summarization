Holden asked Molly to \"reach out\" to Faith, but Molly said she had already tried on the phone without success.  Molly thought the girl was scared and confused, but she said it meant a lot to her that Holden had trusted her with his daughter.\n\n\nFaith was heading home when Damian intercepted her on the street.  He told her that if she received a text message from \"Max,\" it was from him.  Faith hated lying, but Damian insisted that he would let her know when it was safe for Lily to know the truth.  Damian reminded Faith that her loyalty to him was extremely important, and he sent her on her way.\n\n\nLily spoke with Emma on the phone, and she was shocked when Faith walked through the door at home.  Lily was delighted to see her, and Faith asked why there was a security officer outside the house.  Lily explained that Lucinda had arranged it as a precaution because of Holden's trial.  She also said that there was a chance that Damian was still alive, and Faith muttered, \"Damn him,\" to herself.  Lily heard her daughter, so Faith covered herself by saying that even dead, Damian was messing up their lives.\n\n\nLily promised that they would figure out a way to get Holden out of jail.  Faith was eager to see her dad, so they decided to visit him right away.  After they left the house, however, Damian evaded the security guard, took out his key, and was about to enter the house.  The guard returned, however, and Damian went back into hiding.\n\n\nLily walked in on Holden and Molly, who were about to kiss, and Faith followed.  The girl told Molly that Molly was right; they did need to be a family during times of trouble.  Lily was upset that Molly had called Faith, but Holden jumped in and said it had been his idea.  Molly left, and Faith got upset seeing her dad in custody.  She told her parents that they didn't \"get it,\" and everything was \"messed up.\"  Lily and Holden were concerned, but Faith's cell phone pinged with a text message.  Faith saw that the message was from \"Max,\" and Lily observed that it affected the girl greatly.\n\n\nFaith lied and said that she needed to go home and take her English literature exam over the phone.  She convinced her parents that she preferred to walk there to clear her head, so she said goodbye and took off.  She was almost at the meeting place with Damian when she bumped into Molly on the street.  Molly could tell that the girl was stressed, but Faith said it was just the shock of seeing her father in jail.  Molly offered to walk Faith home, but Faith said she wanted to be alone, and she mentioned having to do a chemistry exam over the phone.  Molly left, and Faith got into Damian's car with him.\n\n\nDamian asked about Molly, but Faith said she had just run into her by chance.  Damian wanted to know how \"she\" was, and Faith knew that he meant Lily.  The girl described her mother as \"a mess,\" and she scolded Damian for keeping Holden in jail.  She begged Damian to tell the world that he was alive, but Damian said he would not reveal himself until it was \"safe.\"  Faith said her parents already thought Damian might be alive, and he was shocked.  \n\n\nDamian said he needed to see Lily and talk to her in person to warn her, but he still needed Faith's help.  He told her to distract the security guard at home, so that Damian could get into the house.  Faith continued to argue for her dad's freedom, but Damian screamed, \"That is not an option!\"  Faith admitted she was \"freaked out,\" and Damian apologized for being so flustered.  He again promised that he would protect Lily.\n\n\nBack at the station, Holden told Lily that Damian was not the person Lily thought he was, and he would do anything to get his way.  Lily did not want to fight, but Holden warned that anything could happen when it involved Damian.  Lily went home, and Molly returned to the interview room.  She told Holden that she had seen a very rattled Faith on her way home, and she asked him if anything had happened after she left earlier.  Holden said that Faith had headed home to take her English lit exam over the phone, but Molly swore that his daughter had mentioned a chemistry test.  Molly also had a sense that Faith wanted to get away from her, and Holden pleaded with her to keep trying.  Molly assured him she was \"on the case.\"\n\n\nFaith arrived home and struck up a conversation with the guard by the front door.  She asked him to help her find a valuable earring in the garden, and he waffled but eventually agreed to help her for five minutes.  They walked around to the garden, while inside, Lily spoke with Lucinda on the phone.  She finished the call and sat on the couch to go through her mail, while Damian looked at her through the shutters on the window.\n\n\nLuke went to Java, and Noah recognized the scent of his aftershave.  Luke asked about Maddie, and Noah said that she had gone back to school at Weslyan in order to qualify for a study abroad program the next semester.  Luke wanted Noah to move back in with his family, but Noah refused. Luke said he understood that his family life was a wreck at the moment, but Noah said that was not the reason.  He said that Luke had more than enough on his plate without worrying about a blind friend.  Noah insisted he needed a friend, not a lover at that point of his life.  Without Maddie, Noah said it gave him a chance to build his independence and confidence. Luke agreed to give Noah the time and space he needed, and he hurried to the courthouse.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Katie prompted Reid Oliver to mind his manners with the judge at his hearing and not to \"act like a bonehead.\"  Reid promised to \"practice being humble\" in front of a mirror, so Katie went into the courtroom.  She was very surprised to see Henry there; Henry explained that he was present to make sure that \"the menace to society\" got what he deserved.  Henry called Oliver a \"slob\" and \"full of himself,\" neither of which, Katie said, were crimes.  Henry finally declared that the doctor was just plain trouble, and he was prepared to do whatever had to be done to get the guy out of town.\n\n\nKim told Bob that there was no way she would perjure herself in front of a judge no matter how much the worldly doctor had softened up Bob.  She knew that Reid Oliver had stolen Luke's car and smacked into hers, and she had yet to hear an apology or see the doctor take responsibility for his actions.  The two of them walked into the courthouse and ran into Dr. Oliver, who was convinced that he would be headed south almost within the hour.  Kim did not take Oliver's bait about his saving their lives at Casey and Alison's \"wedding fiasco,\" and he hurled insults at them about Bob's \"pathetic little excuse of a hospital.\"\n\n\nBob chuckled and told Kim that he loved to see Reid squirm.  They entered the courtroom, and the judge arrived to begin the proceedings.  Kim testified first, and she said that the car collision had been an accident, and Dr. Bob added that Oliver had been remanded into his custody at Memorial Hospital, where he said that the doctor was a fine physician, even though he was obnoxious and overbearing.  After some other laudatory comments, Bob sat down.\n\n\nLuke testified next, and his first statement was that he couldn't stand Dr. Oliver, but the truth was that he had bullied the doctor and forced him to take a plane to Oakdale.  Luke said Dr. Oliver had almost missed his return flight because of Luke, so he let the doctor \"borrow\" his car.  The judge stated that if the car was not stolen, the case was not a criminal matter, and he picked up his gavel.  Henry shot to his feet, crying,\" You want criminal?  I'll give you criminal!\" He began calling Oliver a \"dangerous kidnapper,\" and he described how the physician had quarantined him after falsely diagnosing him with TB.  Henry also accused the doctor of doing unspeakable things to him while he was isolated.\n\n\nDr. Oliver stood in his own defense and said that Henry had been quarantined as a precaution, and the \"unspeakable things\" amounted to one blood draw.  The judge asked Dr. Bob to straighten out the gripes, so Bob said that Mr. Coleman had exaggerated.  The judge banged his gavel and said, \"Case dismissed.\"\n\n\nKatie hugged Reid, as Henry appeared morose, and he followed the doctor out of the courtroom and taunted him.  Reid started in on Henry, and called him \"Hank,\" but then he cut it short to intercept Luke as Luke left the courtroom.  Oliver put out his hand to shake Luke's, but Luke refused and reminded Oliver to keep his end of their bargain.  Bob and Kim joined them, and Bob asked what it would take to get Reid to stay on in Oakdale.  The physician set forth several impossible requirements, including a state-of-the-art neurosurgery unit and an obscene salary.  Bob was disappointed, and he said that Memorial didn't have that kind of money available.\n\n\nKatie, however, shot Henry a meaningful look, and then asked what if that kind of money could be available.  \"No, no, no!\" protested Henry, as he made his escape.  Katie followed him to the diner, where Henry chewed her out for thinking that he would even consider spending the Stenbeck fortune on \"Dr. Jekyll.\"  He also accused her of playing \"the Vienna card\" when Katie remarked how such a donation would impress his former love.  \n\n\nHenry assumed that Oliver had planted that idea in Katie's head, and he was furious at the manipulation.  He told her how disappointed he was in her, and he marched out the door.  Katie ran into Kim and Bob outside Al's, and they thanked her for trying to convince Henry to donate his fortune to Memorial.  Katie said she had another idea, and she took out her phone and called Vienna's voicemail.\n\n\nLuke went to find Dr. Oliver at Memorial, and Reid thanked him for his testimony.  Oliver said that he would be on a plane in the next day or two for Dallas, but Luke was worried about the plans for Noah's surgery.  Oliver said not to be concerned, and that Noah would see again because Noah would be on the plane to Texas with him.  Luke found Noah getting dressed in an exam room, and Luke criticized him for going away to have his surgery.  \n\n\nLuke thought Dr. Oliver had \"played\" him in order to get favorable testimony from Luke.  Noah got angry, as Dr. Oliver joined them.  Luke followed the doctor out and begged him to operate on Noah in Oakdale and then leave for Texas.  Oliver told Luke to \"step back\" and let him handle Noah's care.\n\n\n",
