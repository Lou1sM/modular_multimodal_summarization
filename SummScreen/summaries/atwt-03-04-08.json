When Gwen asked why it was important, Alison said she had doubts about Matt and didn't want to get involved with the wrong guy again. Will and Gwen agreed to help Alison, and they all went to the registrar's office at Oakdale U under the pretense of introducing the registrar to baby Hallie. \n\n\nInside the registrar's office, Gwen purposely knocked over Hallie's baby bottle, creating a mess on the registrar's desk. The registrar left to get some paper towels to clean up the mess, and Alison told Will and Gwen to check the files for Matt's name while she stood watch outside the office. \n\n\nCasey told Matt he wished Matt hadn't told Margo that Casey was going to go back to Oakdale U. Matt told Casey to quit whining and appreciate his family and support system, which was something Matt never had. They then headed over to Oakdale U so Casey could enroll in some courses. \n\n\nWhen Matt and Casey arrived at the registrar's office, they found Alison waiting outside. Alison told them the registrar had stepped out, and she stopped Matt and Casey from entering the office. The registrar returned, and Casey explained he had come to register for classes. The registrar invited Casey and Matt into her office; inside, Will and Gwen were sitting with Hallie. They all acted surprised to see one another. Will and Gwen thought it was terrific that Casey was going back to school, and Casey said they could thank Matt for that. \n\n\nMatt asked Alison why she was hanging out in such a strange place with her friends. Alison said she was thinking of taking some summer courses and asked if Matt had any suggestions based on his time at Oakdale U. Matt suggested medieval history but told Alison she could check out the course catalog online. \n\n\nAlison, Gwen, Will, and the baby left the building, and Alison asked what Gwen and Will had found out about Matt. They told her they didn't find any records of Matt having attended the university, and Will added that he didn't remember ever having seen Matt on campus when Casey was a student there. Alison wondered why Casey would lie about how he met Matt, and Gwen suggested that perhaps Casey had met Matt in prison. Will agreed that would be something Casey would not want his parents to find out. Alison thanked them and left. \n\n\nAlison went to the Lakeview, where she found Casey getting ready for work. She told him what she'd been doing at the college and then asked why Casey had lied to her. Matt walked up behind her and told her it was because he and Casey had met in prison, where they had been cellmates. Matt then told Alison to blame him for the lying, not Casey, but said he would never have gotten a job if Casey's family hadn't helped him. Casey told Alison that Matt had been a good friend and that he would never have gotten out of prison early if it hadn't been for Matt's help. \n\n\nAlison thanked Casey and Matt for being honest with her. Matt asked if they were still on for their date or if Alison would prefer to not hang out with an ex-jailbird. Alison said she was okay with that if Matt was okay with hanging out with an ex-porn star. Matt said it was fine with him, and Alison said she was looking forward to getting to know Matt better. \n\n\nSofie went to the hospital to visit Paul and found him getting ready to check himself out. Chris walked in and said he couldn't let Paul do that because Paul needed a lot of care. Paul told Chris he had contacted a private nursing business, and he was supposed to meet the nurse at Fairwinds. Chris told Paul he wouldn't let him leave by himself, so Sofie said she would take Paul home. \n\n\nChris took Sofie aside and tried to convince her she couldn't care for Paul and shouldn't be involved with him. Sofie told Chris she'd had enough of taking orders from men when she was with Cole. Paul walked out and told Chris he thought Sofie was capable of making her own decisions. \n\n\nAt the farm, Meg told Emma she had accepted her first assignment as a private nurse, but the patient was Paul. Emma pleaded with Meg not to take the assignment, but Meg said the nursing firm was short on nurses and didn't have anything else they could give Meg. Meg explained to Emma that she had told the firm she would take the assignment for one day, so the firm would have time to find another nurse to take over for her. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Sofie helped Paul take off his shirt, revealing a large burned area on Paul's back. Meg arrived, and Paul was surprised to learn she was his nurse. He asked Meg if she had volunteered for the assignment, but Meg explained that she was only there for a day. Meg asked Sofie to get some clean towels. Meg saw the extent of Paul's injuries, and she became upset. Meg told Paul she didn't think she could act professionally around him, and Paul asked if that meant she still cared for him. Meg admitted it did and said she couldn't do this. When Sofie came back in the room, Meg asked if Sofie would be able to apply the burn cream and keep Paul's wounds clean until another nurse could be assigned. Sofie agreed to this, and Meg left. \n\n\nChris came to Fairwinds to check on Paul and found Sofie acting as Paul's nurse. Sofie explained that the nurse had to leave, but Sofie assured Chris she knew how to keep the wounds clean and apply the cream. When Chris continued to sound doubtful, Sofie told him she would call him later and give him a report. Chris told her not to forget to do that, and he left. Paul told Sofie there appeared to be something going on between her and Chris, but Sofie assured him they were just friends. She told Paul the only love in her life was Hallie. \n\n\nEmma was surprised when Meg returned to the farm. Meg fell into her mother's arms and began crying. When she could talk, she told Emma how overwhelmed she'd been by her feelings about Paul when she saw how hurt he was. Emma asked if another nurse had shown up, and Meg told her a young woman had been there taking care of Paul, but she doubted she was a nurse. Emma asked if Paul had a new girlfriend, but Meg told Emma the girl was young enough to be Paul's daughter. Emma remarked that wouldn't stop half the men in town. \n\n\nSofie began reading to Paul again from \"Treasure Island,\" and Paul dozed off on the sofa. Sofie put the book down and laid her head down on the other end of the sofa. She dozed, and Paul woke up. Paul got up and called Gwen and Will. Gwen answered, as Will ran out the door to avoid being late for class. Paul asked Gwen if she could come to Fairwinds to see him. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry ordered a large breakfast. Brad walked in and sat down with Henry, telling Henry he should have told Vienna the truth about what happened with Kit. Henry told Brad that would be a waste of time, because Vienna had moved on with Gray. \n\n\nBrad left and went to the diner to visit Vienna. He told Vienna that Henry had only been with Kit because he was trying to help Parker by tricking Kit into admitting she had killed Sam. Vienna was upset to learn about this and said she should have trusted Henry all along. She took off the diamond earrings Gray had given her and returned them to Gray. When Gray tried to convince Vienna that she deserved more than what she could have with Henry, Vienna told him Henry was the one she loved, and she turned to leave. Brad confronted Gray and said, \"You can't stand in the way of true love.\" \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, the hotel manager took Henry's breakfast away from him because Henry's bills had gone unpaid for too long. When he presented Henry with his room bill, Henry tore it in half and told the manager to get in line with his other creditors. Katie came downstairs and asked Henry what was wrong. Henry told her he had no money, no diner, no Vienna, and no place to stay. Katie invited Henry to move in with her, and he accepted. \n\n\nBrad took Vienna to the Lakeview. She went to Henry's suite, only to find it empty. The maid informed her that the occupant had checked out and that it didn't look like he planned to come back. Vienna went downstairs and gave Brad this news. Brad suggested she call Henry on his cell phone, which she did. Upstairs in Katie's suite, Henry couldn't find his ringing phone, and when he didn't answer, Vienna hung up. Vienna told Brad that Henry must have meant business, and she said she would go back where she was wanted. \n\n\nVienna went back to the diner and told Gray that Henry had apparently left town. Gray said that showed that he loved Vienna more than Henry did, because he was still there for her, whereas Henry was gone. Meanwhile, Brad called Henry and found out he was in Katie's suite. Brad went upstairs and told Henry what had just happened. Although Brad and Katie both told Henry to call Vienna, Henry insisted it was too late. Picking up a bottle of Scotch, Henry said, \"You know what they say? 'Single men love single malt.'\" Brad took the bottle from Henry and said, \"You know what else they say? 'The course of true love ... really sucks.'\" As Brad and Henry settled down with their bottle, Katie wondered what she'd gotten herself into. \n\n\n",
