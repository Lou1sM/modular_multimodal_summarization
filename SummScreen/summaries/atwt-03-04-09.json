Vienna announced that she had a \"new look\" and surprised him by coming out wearing a beach ball on her belly to simulate an advanced pregnancy. Henry had just taken a swig of coffee, and he was so shocked that he proceeded to spew it around the room. He had to breathe into a paper bag until his respiration returned to normal, but every time he looked at Vienna's bulge, he hyperventilated again. Vienna began nuzzling Henry's neck, and that finally made him forget about the ball, which Vienna soon discarded. \n\n\nKatie arrived home and found that Brad had put a Mother's Day balloon in their living room. It reduced her to tears, however. She told Brad she had seen the fertility expert, and he had said she was not a good candidate for in vitro fertilization because her eggs were not viable. Brad suggested \"pumping them up\" and \"whipping them into shape,\" before he realized it was a serious matter. He mentioned they could fall back on Plan B: adoption. However, Katie said there was one other way. \n\n\nThey could get an egg from an anonymous donor and fertilize it with Brad's sperm. Brad thought that sounded too much like a science experiment, and he opted again for adoption. Katie, however, still wanted Vienna to carry a baby that would have Brad's genes. She was afraid that with her multiple marriages and Brad's brushes with the law, the two of them would have difficulty adopting. She also liked the definite time frame of working with a donated egg. She convinced Brad to give her idea a try, and they left to talk to Vienna. \n\n\nCarly slept on her couch until loud knocking awakened her. She was still hung over from the large amount of vodka she had consumed the night before with Craig, so she was not pleased to find him on the other side of her front door so early. He asked for the finished label design that she had promised to have ready, but she could only remember several horrible attempts at drawing. He did find one he liked, however, and despite Carly's protests of needing more sleep, Craig insisted that she get dressed and accompany him to Chicago to show the final label to their distributor, Mr. Siegler. He said Carly needed to be there in case Siegler wanted to make some changes. Craig sent her upstairs to dress. \n\n\nJack and Janet took Parker and Liberty to breakfast at the diner. Parker had stayed overnight at the farm with his dad, and Liberty mentioned that she would like to do that some time, as well. She said Katie had been moody ever since her recent surgery. The teens left for school, and Jack announced he had the day off, and so did Janet. This was news to her, but Jack said he had cleared it with Henry, and he also had a surprise to show her. Janet was concerned about giving up her tip money, but Jack would not take \"no\" for an answer. He escorted his wife out the door. \n\n\nParker and Liberty hung around Old Town instead of heading to school. They were planning their day when Carly called Parker to tell him she was going to Chicago with Craig on business. She said she would be gone all day but would be back for supper. Parker wished his mother a good trip and grinned to Liberty that there was no school that day. They were going to try some \"home study\" instead. \n\n\nJack led Janet through the snowy woods that were part of the Snyder farm. She was still missing the tip money from her work shift, but Jack got her attention when he pointed out that the woods were their woods. He explained that Emma had told Jack he could pick a plot of her wooded land and build his house there. She knew that he and Janet wanted their own place, and she had made a generous offer. Janet was speechless to think they were standing on their own home site. She planned her whole kitchen, complete with stainless steel appliances, and Jack carried her over a make-believe threshold. Jack decided some sort of christening was in order, so they sank into the cushiony snow. \n\n\nParker got a pizza, and he and Liberty ditched school and went to Carly's empty house. Parker put the pizza in the oven to keep it warm, and the teens snuggled on the couch. Liberty said she had talked to her dad, and Brad had agreed that she could go to Ft. Lauderdale for spring break if there were only girls in the group, and they had an adult chaperone. Parker was also going with a classmate's family, so the kids were excited that they might have some alone time on the beach. They began kissing and forgot about Florida -- and the pizza. \n\n\nCarly and Craig finished their business early, and rejoiced that Mr. Siegler had loved the label. They had also again imbibed a lot of vodka, but Carly was anxious to start back to Oakdale. Craig, however, said he had drunk too much vodka to drive, and he suggested they go to a hotel for a few hours and sleep it off. Carly wasn't buying that at all, but Craig promised they would get separate rooms, and Carly could continue her nap. When they went to a hotel, however, only one room was available, and Carly was not a happy camper. \n\n\nCraig plopped on the bed, and Carly took to the chair, but it was uncomfortable. Craig told her not to be silly; they were there to sleep and there was plenty of room on the bed. Carly got on the bed and was about to doze when Craig asked if she was awake. When she answered yes, he said how great it would be to call Stan, the amorous buyer who had kissed Carly, and tell him where he could shove his nightclubs. Carly began to giggle, and soon she was engulfed in laughter. She said she remembered how Craig had punched Stan and then used the words \"punch drunk,\" which had new meanings. Craig began to laugh, too, and soon they rolled face to face, and Craig kissed her. \n\n\nBack at Carly's house, Liberty began coughing, and when she and Parker came up for air, they saw smoke billowing out of the kitchen. Parker wanted to run in there, but Liberty made him leave the house with her immediately. \n\n\nJanet finally admitted the lovemaking in the snow was worth missing work for. She said she and Liberty had never had a house before, and she was looking forward to it. Jack's phone rang, and he took a call from a fellow police officer, who said the fire department was at Carly's house. Jack and Janet raced back to their car and drove to Carly's, where they found their kids, minus some of their clothes, huddled under a blanket on the front porch while the firemen worked inside. A fireman came out and said the pizza had been incinerated, but there had been no real fire, just lots of smelly black smoke. Jack and Janet marched the teens inside. \n\n\nAfter having sex with Craig, Carly was embarrassed and ashamed of herself. She accused him of setting up the whole scenario, but he protested that all that had happened was that they had too much vodka and forgot what was important. Carly could not wait to get home. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna also made love, and then Vienna wanted to try it with the beach ball in place. Henry was relieved when someone knocked on the door, and Vienna jumped up to answer. Brad and Katie came in, and Katie explained what the fertility specialist had told her. She also told Vienna how they could still make a baby using a donor egg with Brad's sperm. Vienna knew there was a lot of money involved in those processes, so she offered to let Brad fertilize one of her eggs - personally. After all, it would save time and money. \n\n\nHenry went ballistic and shouted that Vienna could not sleep with Brad under any circumstances. Katie joined in and agreed that Vienna had made a nice offer, but it was off the table. Vienna then changed the offer to having the doctor do the fertilizing part, but Henry was still freaked out. He yelled about turkey basters and said he could not get certain images out of his head. Katie, however, chimed in, saying she thought the test tube method was worth exploring. Henry ran from the room, screaming that he would be damned if he let Vienna have a baby with another man. \n\n\nJack asked Parker and Liberty why they were alone in the house and not at school, and where Carly was. Parker said his mother was out of town with Craig, and he had found out about it just after breakfast. Janet asked if the kids had sex, and Liberty screamed, \"No!\" but Parker said that was no one else's business. That set off Jack and Janet, who reminded their children that they were under age, so it was definitely their business. Just then, Carly and Craig walked in and wanted to know what was happening. \n\n\nJanet got Liberty out of there, as Jack began explaining to Carly. He got close to her and smelled alcohol on her breath, and then accused her that her \"business\" with Craig had kept her from knowing what was going on in her own house. Craig tried to speak, but both Jack and Carly told him to butt out. Jack told Carly about the fire and about the kids' making out on the couch, and they sent Parker to his room and revoked his spring break trip. \n\n\nJack told Carly they had to keep Parker and Liberty apart, because every time the teens were alone, they got in trouble. He suggested perhaps Parker should go to boarding school with J.J., but Carly protested. She wanted to think about the situation overnight, unaware that Parker was listening behind the door. \n\n\nAt Brad and Katie's, Janet lit into her daughter and reminded Liberty that her final semester was very important for college admissions. She asked Liberty if Parker was pressuring her to have sex, but the girl refused to talk about it and bolted for her room. Janet yelled after her that there would be no Ft. Lauderdale for her in the spring. \n\n\nKatie told Vienna she loved her and Henry too much to ruin what they had just to get what she wanted. Brad still voted for adoption, but Vienna asked what Katie felt in her heart. Her friend said she wanted Vienna to carry Brad's baby, but she worried about Henry. Vienna promised she could win him over, and the women hugged. \n\n\nJack returned to the farm and found Janet upset and eating ice cream. Janet said she had learned it was Parker's idea to skip school and play house, and she was afraid he was pushing Liberty. She said Parker needed discipline and to understand that his actions had consequences. Jack became angry and said he was sending Parker to boarding school and asked if that was enough punishment to suit Janet. \n\n\nParker called Liberty and told her Jack was threatening to send him to school with J.J. They commiserated together about their cancelled spring break fun, as well. Liberty said she had been really psyched about going to Ft. Lauderdale and was very disappointed. Parker thought a minute and then said they should go anyway. \n\n\nCarly walked downstairs and found Craig still in her living room. She told him being her business partner did not give him the right to comment on her personal life. He said he thought she might need a friend, but Carly said she didn't consider him one. She also promised that what happened in Chicago would never happen again. She went into the kitchen and saw the blackened appliances and counters, and it really shocked her. Craig comforted a weepy Carly as she realized she could have lost her son.\n\n\n",
