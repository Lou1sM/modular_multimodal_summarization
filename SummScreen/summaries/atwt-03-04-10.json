They both agreed that she was out of line, but Carly wondered what they needed to do next.  Jack took a break, and he and Carly went to the diner, as Carly wanted to talk about their future.  Jack explained haltingly that Janet still had it in her mind that the only way to save Liberty was to have a baby with him.  Carly got upset, but Jack said he could not walk away if there was even a chance he could save Liberty.\n\n\nCarly, using her best sarcasm, asked Jack if he was planning on moving in with her and visiting Janet when she was ovulating.  Jack assured Carly that he only wanted to be with her, but she said that Jack could not be with Janet and still say that Carly was the one he loved.  Jack asked for time to figure it all out, and he walked out, as Carly appeared to get an idea.  She got out her phone and called her doctor, to ask for about five minutes of her time to find out more about in vitro fertilization.\n\n\nDusty called on Janet at the farm because he was worried about her.  Janet was packing up some clothes to send to Liberty in Minneapolis, and Dusty offered to deliver them, but Janet said there was nothing more he could do for her daughter.  Dusty told Janet that she could not have a baby with Jack, but Janet explained that she was trying to save her child's life.  Dusty continued to try to persuade Janet not to have Jack's baby, and he asked, \"What about us?\"  Janet answered, \"There is no us.\"\n\n\nDusty asked Janet to think about what she needed, but her only answer was a baby who could match Liberty's bone marrow and save the girl.  Dusty didn't believe her, so Janet asked him to leave because she was tired of discussing it.  Dusty warned her that staying with Jack for the sake of a child was not a good idea.  Janet only wanted to keep her daughter alive, and a sibling for Liberty was the only answer.  Dusty asked her to please not do it, and he reached for her, but Janet turned her back, and Dusty walked out.\n\n\nWhen Jack returned to the police station, he found Dusty waiting for him.  Dusty said that Janet was so worried about Liberty that she couldn't think straight, so Dusty asked Jack to \"be a man and do it for her.\"  He wanted Jack to tell his wife that having a baby was not a viable option.  Jack laughed and told Dusty that if Dusty really knew Janet, he would realize that no man told Janet what to do.  Secondly, he said, he didn't take direction well, either, especially from Dusty.  Dusty said the difference between the two of them was that Dusty loved Janet, but Jack didn't.\n\n\nThe two men argued more about the proposed baby until Jack called Dusty \"just a guy who sleeps with other guys' wives.\"  Dusty asked whether, if Jack's child with Janet did not match, they would continue to have children until one did.  Jack walked out on that, but Dusty followed him to Old Town.  Finally Jack stopped and pointed out that Dusty wanted Janet because he had lost Jennifer and his son, and Janet could restore a family to him.  Jack ordered Dusty to stay out of his business with Janet.\n\n\nCarly went to the farm and walked right in.  She stunned Janet by saying that she fully supported the idea of Janet and Jack's having a baby to save Liberty.  Carly said, however, that the best way to achieve that was with in vitro fertilization.  Janet told Carly to mind her own business, but Carly said that the focus was to \"create\" a blood marrow donor for Liberty.  She explained that if Janet went that route, the doctors could test the embryos before they were implanted, so they would be sure that they had a match.  Janet could not believe that Carly had asked her doctor for all that information, but Carly insisted that IVF solved all their problems.\n\n\nJanet asked what happened to the embryos not used, and Carly shrugged her shoulders and said they probably just \"got rid of them.\"  Janet protested that was against her beliefs, but Carly laughed and asked where Janet's \"belief system\" was when she slept with Dusty.  \"How dare you!\" screamed Janet, and the women argued until Jack appeared and asked what was going on.  Carly said that she had presented Janet with an idea that would get Liberty the sibling she needed, while at the same time \"preserving\" their boundaries.  Janet explained Carly's point about implanting embryos that matched Liberty, however she was troubled about what happened to the other ones.  Jack asked Carly to go home, and she reluctantly agreed.  Janet shook her head and said she couldn't even see straight.\n\n\nJanet and Jack talked, and Janet was trying to work out the fate of the other embryos.  She said if they gave them to a deserving couple, it would be like an adoption.  Before she went upstairs, Janet said they had to make a decision soon.  Jack walked out for some air, and Carly was still outside, waiting.  He couldn't believe she was still there, and Carly pressured Jack for information on which way the wind was blowing.  Jack said he wanted to be with her, but he had to figure out how to \"do right\" by his family, also.  Jack went back inside, and a very gloomy Carly walked to her car.\n\n\nDusty sat in his hotel room and talked to a photo of his late wife, Jennifer.  He asked her to please let him know if it was all right for him to move on with his live.\n\n\nLucinda went to the police station to see Holden, and she was disturbed that the police were not taking seriously the proof they had provided through Dr. Oliver's statement that the Maltese body was not Damian.  If Damian were still alive, then Holden was not guilty of murder.  She suggested that they \"smoke out Damian\" from wherever he was hiding, and Holden was positive that Damian would do anything to be near Lily again.  Lucinda questioned Holden about the possibility that Damian was still in Oakdale, and he said he was not even sure that Damian had ever left.\n\n\nHolden suspected that Damian knew that Holden was in custody and was not in a position to protect Lily and the children.  Lucinda waggled her finger at Holden, however, and said that he had to take some of the blame for not telling Lily that he still loved her.  Holden reminded his ex-mother-in-law that Lily had married Damian \"about three seconds\" after Holden was declared dead.  He wanted most for Lucinda to convince Lily to take the children and leave town.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Faith kept the security guard busy looking for a diamond earring and flirted outrageously with him.  Damian watched Lily through a window, but he heard someone approaching, so he hid again.  The visitor was Molly, not a welcome presence in Lily's eyes.  Lily said that the guard usually escorted visitors to the door, but Molly had seen no guard.  Molly asked to see Faith, who was anxious, Molly said, when she had run into her on the street.  Lily was very defensive and said she could take care of her own daughter.  Molly said she just wanted to see if Faith would like to go to a movie, but Lily called that \"imposing\" on her kids' lives.\n\n\nBesides, said Lily, Faith was upstairs taking an oral exam from school, but Molly called her attention to Faith and the guard, who were deep in discussion outside the door.  Lily opened the door and asked what was going on, as Damian continued to watch.  Faith lied and said that she had finished her telephone exam and had gone outside for some air.  She also got the guard off the hook for not spotting Molly's arrival, as Lily pulled Faith inside.\n\n\nMolly asked Faith how her chemistry exam had gone, but Faith said it was an English lit test.  Molly mentioned that it was odd that a \"fancy-schmantzy school\" like Faith's would not have its exams online for students who needed them.  Lily opened the door and asked the guard to escort Molly to her car.  Molly left with the guard, as Damian stepped out of the bushes.  When Faith returned from getting a soda, Lily asked if everything was okay at school.  Faith said yes, but then she said that she thought she should leave the boarding school because her family was breaking apart.  Lily wanted to speak with Holden again, so she left for the police station.  As soon as her mom was gone, Faith grabbed her coat and headed out the back door.\n\n\nLily walked into the interrogation room at the police station and scowled at Holden.  She demanded that he get his \"girlfriend\" off her back, and she said Molly had shown up at the house and hassled her about Faith.  Holden refused to tell Molly to stay away from their family, as Lucinda spoke up and suggested that they focus on one another.  Lily warned her mother not to interfere, so Lucinda said her goodbyes and left.\n\n\nHolden asked exactly what Molly had done, and Lily said that Molly had told Lily that she didn't know how to look after her own children.  Holden said he had asked Molly to go to Lily's to speak with Faith.  Lily got angry, as Holden explained that he hoped an adult other than her parents might be able to get through to their daughter.  Lily felt insulted, however, and thought Holden was making a \"power play.\"  Lily cited Molly's lapse in judgment in sending the fake wedding ring and note to the house, and said that had certainly complicated Holden's legal situation.\n\n\nHolden raised his voice and reminded Lily that he was in jail because of Damian, not Molly.  He said Lucinda had acknowledged the same thing, so Lily suggested that she send a message to Damian that she knew he was alive and wanted to see him.  Holden said he would not let Lily use herself as \"bait,\" and he was adamant about that.\n\n\nFaith and Molly both ended up by chance in Java.  Faith accused Molly of stalking her, but Molly laughed and sat with the girl.  She also said that perhaps she could relate to what Faith was going through better than her mom and dad.  She offered to listen and help without sharing everything with Holden and Lily.  Just then, Faith received a text message from \"Max,\" Damian's code name, so she left in a hurry.\n\n\nFaith met Damian in his car, and he bullied her that she had let him down.  He yelled that he wanted the girl to get her mother away from the house and somewhere private where he could talk to her.  Damian said he would let Faith know the details, and she had better do what he said.  He threatened to reveal her troubles at school, but Faith was angry, and she talked about how much her parents loved her, and she knew they would forgive her.  Damian reminded her that the police would not be nearly so forgiving, and a troubled Faith got out of the car.\n\n\nMolly placed a call to Miss Gibson at Faith's school.  She identified herself as \"Faith Snyder's aunt,\" and she asked if something had happened recently at school.  Miss Gibson referred to an \"incident,\" so Molly asked why Faith's parents had not been notified.  The woman said that Faith's father was told all about it when he had picked her up at school.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Damian is unable to talk to Lily because Molly arrives and he has to leave without talking to her. Lily is upset when Molly tells her that something is bothering Faith and Holden wants her (Molly) to talk to her. Lily confronts Holden and tells him to tell Molly to stop interfering in Faith's life. Holden tells Lily that he asked Molly to talk to Faith and find out what is bothering her. Lily is hurt that Holden thinks she can't connect with her daughter. Faith is ready to go tell the police that Damian is alive in order to get her father out of jail but Damian threatens to tell the police she had drugs in her possession at school. Damian orders Faith to help him get Lily alone some place private so they can talk. Lily tells Holden that she can contact Damian so that he can come out of hiding, but Holden won't allow Lily to put herself in danger. Jack continues to be torn between his obligation to his family and his love for Carly while Janet tells Dusty she can't be with him because she has to concentrate on doing what she must do to save Liberty's life. Carly talks to her doctor and finds out that the best chance of finding a perfect bone marrow match for Liberty is for Jack and Janet to do in vitro fertilization. Janet objects to the procedure because she doesn't want to have to dispose of the remaining embryos but once she and Jack talk about it, she tells him she might consider it if they give the embryo that remain to another couple that needs them. Jack and Janet still can't figure out what they should do but both agree that they must make a decision very soon.",
