Parker was convinced there was no way for Jack and Carly to prove that Kit fired the second shot that killed Sam and he would be off to jail soon. Jack and Carly encouraged Parker to stay positive and the three decided a father-son trip to see a spring training game in Arizona would be just the thing to get Parker's attention off of the trial and back onto being a kid. Jack called Margo and got a 24-hour pass to take Parker on the trip as Carly reassured both Jack and Parker that she would remain under police surveillance to make sure she was safe from Kit. \n\n\nOnce Jack and Parker left for their trip, Carly was alone at the house except for her police guard outside the house. As she walked around alone she heard a thump in another room and went to check on it, but was relieved to find nothing there. As she reentered the living room, Carly received a call from Kit who asked Carly to meet her in Chicago right away. Kit told Carly that she knew who fired the second shot that killed Sam, but couldn't tell her over the phone. Kit denied that it was she who killed Sam, and told Carly she would tell her who it was if Carly met her alone in Chicago that night. Kit warned Carly to come by herself and said she could give her evidence against the killers. Carly questioned why Kit wouldn't go to the police if she knew who killed Sam, but Kit explained she couldn't go to the police herself because the real killers would come after her if they knew she gave the police evidence. Carly was convinced that Kit was setting a trap for her, but felt she had to at least see what evidence Kit had in case it exonerated Parker. She knew her one problem would be getting rid of her police protection. \n\n\nCarly headed to Al's Diner and explained to the waitress that the man following her was stalking her and asked if she could sneak out the back to get rid of him. The waitress allowed Carly to go out the back and when the man came in looking for Carly, the waitress was shocked when he turned out to be a cop and not a stalker. Carly got away and as she drove to Chicago she convinced herself she was doing this for Parker, but became concerned when she realized she had left her cell phone at home. \n\n\nCarly arrived at the warehouse in Chicago and talked herself into going in to find Kit and get the answers she needed to clear Parker of Sam's murder. Once inside the dark and dingy meeting place, Carly yelled for Kit, but received no answer. Kit looked down on Carly from the stairwell above her and moved cautiously to avoid letting Carly know where she was. Carly continued to try to find Kit, but despite her yells for Kit, she received no answers. Frustrated, Carly yelled for Kit to stop playing games, but the only response she got was large panels falling and almost hitting her. \n\n\nAs Parker and Jack prepared to leave for their guys' trip, Parker expressed his concern over Carly's safety. As they waited for their delayed flight, Parker apologized for the events that led to Sam's shooting. Jack told Parker that he saved his mother and shouldn't second-guess himself. As their wait dragged on, Parker told Jack that he had a \"bad feeling\" about his mother. Jack questioned his son's \"vibes\" about Carly, and Parker confirmed that the feelings were bad. Just then, Jack received a phone call from the policeman that was tailing Carly and learned that he lost Carly at Al's. Jack and Parker decided to look for Carly and frantically called her on her phone as they searched. Parker's intuitive abilities kicked in and he warned Jack that he knew for sure that Carly was in danger. Jack reassured Parker that he wouldn't let anything happen to Carly, and told Parker he would drop him at the farm before continuing his search. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul covered Sofie with a blanket on his couch and inadvertently woke her from a nap. She apologized for falling asleep at his house, but Paul said he was grateful for her company. While Paul and Sofie were speaking, Gwen arrived with baby Hallie after receiving Paul's earlier phone call asking her to come and visit with the baby. Sofie and Gwen were shocked to see one another and Paul admitted he had asked Gwen to bring Hallie in the hopes of cheering up Sofie. Sofie told Paul that he should not have arranged the meeting because seeing Hallie only reminded her that she lost her baby to Will and Gwen. Paul apologized and explained he thought it would make her happy, but Sofie stormed out. Gwen explained to Paul that she and Will were unable to trust Sofie, but Paul pleaded with Gwen to let Sofie see the baby and argued that Gwen of all people should understand the pain of losing a child. Gwen was affected by Paul's argument, but left his home without responding. \n\n\nGwen met up with Will at Java after class and detailed her earlier run-in with Sofie at Paul's home. Will was frustrated by his brother's attempts to let Sofie visit with Hallie and told Gwen he was going to confront Paul. Gwen asked Will not to argue with Paul because he was still healing from his burns. Gwen continued to explain that Paul identified with Sofie because he had also suffered the loss of a child. Will told Gwen that he didn't care about anything but her and the baby, and Paul needed to respect the boundaries they had defined with Sofie. He stormed out of Java to confront his brother. As Gwen sat and comforted her baby girl, Sofie arrived and told Gwen that she had nothing to do with Paul inviting Gwen and Hallie to visit. Gwen said she knew Sofie had nothing to do with it and understood Sofie's pain must be overwhelming at times. She offered to let Sofie hold the baby, but Sofie declined, fearing she wouldn't be able to let her go. Sofie explained her frustration at losing the baby and admitted she might need to leave town to get over the loss. Gwen encouraged Sofie to stay in Oakdale where she had people who cared for her and also for Hallie. As Gwen ended her talk with Sofie, she saw that Chris had arrived at Java and asked him to look after Sofie. \n\n\nChris sat with Sofie at Java and vilified Paul for bringing Gwen and Sofie together. He went on to tell Sofie about Paul's past, specifically keeping his sister Jennifer from her own baby. Sofie was reluctant to believe what Chris had to say, but listened as he warned her to stay away from Paul because he always hurt the people he claimed to care about. Chris received a page to head back to work, but before he left he asked Sofie to have dinner with him. She agreed and the two made plans to meet later. \n\n\nBarbara showed up at the hospital to visit Paul and found out from Chris that her son had been discharged with his new friend, Sofie. Barbara questioned why Paul would leave without calling his family. Chris explained that Paul signed himself out against medical advice and that Sofie went with him to help him get settled at home. Barbara believed that Sofie was using Paul to get something, but Chris said that Sofie had been through rough time lately and really didn't need someone like Paul in her life. \n\n\nBarbara immediately set out to Fairwinds to find out what was going on between Paul and Sofie. Once she arrived, Paul explained that he and Sofie were just friends and that she had taken good care of him after Meg left. When Paul began to experience pain, Barbara was forced to see the reality of Paul's burns. She was overwhelmed with sadness as she saw the burns on her son's back and recalled the pain of her own burns years earlier. Paul apologized for bringing back bad memories and told his mom she didn't need to care for him. Barbara was able to get over her grief and applied the ointment to her son's back as she offered him reassurance that he would recover and be healthy again one day soon. Just as she finished caring for Paul's wounds, Will arrived and asked what his brother was thinking when he invited Gwen and Hallie to visit while Sofie was there. Barbara was shocked to hear what Paul had done, but asked Will not to upset his brother because of his injuries. Will told his brother in no uncertain terms to stop interfering and keep Sofie away from his wife and child. Paul tried to convince Will that Sofie was heartbroken over losing Hallie, but Will lashed out at Paul and told him to stop messing up his life. When Barbara tried to intervene on Paul's behalf, Will told her that she always chose Paul over him, but that he would never be their victim again. \n\n\nBack at home, Gwen put baby Hallie down for a nap. She told Hallie how lucky she was to have her baby girl, but how bad she felt for taking her away from Sofie. Will listened silently in the doorway as Gwen explained to Hallie her confusion over the adoption. As Gwen left the room, Will stopped her and asked if she had changed her mind about keeping Hallie. Gwen admitted to Will that she was conflicted over whether they should keep Hallie or return her to Sofie. Will questioned if Paul had put thoughts into Gwen's head, but she denied that Paul had anything to do with how she was feeling. Will reminded Gwen that Hallie was their baby, but Gwen wondered again if the right thing was to let Sofie have her baby back. \n\n\nAfter her talk with Chris, Sofie returned to Fairwinds to talk with Paul. He was relieved to see her again, until she asked why so many people have warned her to stay away from him. Paul confessed that even Will  had gotten to the point where he thought badly of him. Paul admitted he had made many mistakes in his life and was hoping to make changes in the future. Sofie told Paul she believed that he could change and said she would return and visit another day, but had to leave for a date that night with Chris. Paul asked Sofie if she and Chris had a serious relationship, but Sofie denied being anything but friends with Chris. \n\n\n",
