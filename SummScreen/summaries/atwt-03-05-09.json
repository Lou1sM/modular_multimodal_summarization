Casey appeared on the roof and told Alison that he was free and had dodged a bullet by not being sent back to prison. Alison continued to focus on Matt and said she hated feeling like a fool. She couldn't believe she had let him play her so easily. Casey tried to make her feel better by telling her he had thought about her a lot while he was in jail. He missed hanging out with her and asked for a do over. Casey wanted to go back to where they were before all the troubles started, but Alison asked about Jade and the fact that Casey had slept with her. Casey said the episode meant nothing to him, but Alison advised him to make sure Jade felt the same way before she could grant him a do over. \n\n\nLuke arrived at Java to tell Noah that the police had dropped all charges against Casey and released him. They were both pleased until Kevin showed up. Luke told him how sorry he was that that Elwood had died, but Kevin intimated that the two of them weren't that close. Luke also said that the car that hit Elwood belonged to Matt O'Connor. When Kevin found out the police had not caught Matt, he said, \"good.\" He clarified that by saying he just wanted the mystery to be over so he could stop thinking about it. He left in a hurry, and Luke and Noah thought his behavior was strange. \n\n\nLuke was of the opinion that Kevin did not seem to care who killed his friend, Elwood. Noah's theory was that something had happened between the two killings that had really freaked out Kevin. Perhaps, he went on, Kevin had figured out who the real murderer was, and it was not Matt. He was suspicious of Kevin's actions dating back as far as the school election, and he cautioned Luke not to trust him. \n\n\nAn officer in the police station approached Margo and asked her to take a look at something. They went outside, and the officer led her to a parking area where Matt's gray SUV was parked. Someone had forced open the door and hotwired the vehicle, which left Margo wondering why Matt would do that to his own car. \n\n\nAt Lily's, Jade told her aunt that she was taking Casey to a special restaurant in Chicago to celebrate his being out of jail. Casey, however, did not know about her plans yet, but Jade was not concerned. Lily was, and she cautioned her niece to be sure Casey felt the same way about things, because Jade had been hurt before. Casey knocked at the door, looking for Jade. She invited him to dinner, but Casey declared it was not a good idea. He felt he wanted to just be friends with Jade, and he blurted out that he didn't want anything sexual to happen between them again. Jade took offense at that, and she assumed that Casey was going back to Alison. Casey admitted he and Alison were going to try again, but Jade told him to open his eyes. He said he could not give Alison up, so Jade asked him to leave. \n\n\nMargo found Alison at Memorial and asked for a favor. She told the girl the police had found Matt's car, and it appeared that Matt might have been telling the truth about its being stolen. His taking off suddenly did create a problem, however. Margo asked Alison to call Matt, because she needed to talk to him about the car. Alison wanted no part of trapping Matt, but Margo promised not to hold it against him if all he had done was panic and run off. Alison called Matt and, per instructions from Margo, left a message suggesting they meet at a deserted warehouse on Fourth Street. She also promised to help him. Margo thanked her for her cooperation. \n\n\nAlison went back to work after Margo left, but Mark Viro, her tormentor from Halloween, soon interrupted her. He grabbed her arm and told her she was going with him. She thought he might be ill and offered to find him a doctor, but he said he only needed her. He threatened her and her boyfriend, and promised that unless she went with him, he would hurt Casey. He marched her down the stairwell and outside. \n\n\nCasey showed up at the hospital looking for Alison, but he could not find her. Margo called him and asked him to find out from Alison if she had heard back from Matt. Casey was furious that his mother was using his friend as bait, but Margo said they were not sure that Matt was the killer. She also mentioned that Alison wanted to see Matt exonerated. Casey got upset and hung up on Margo and left a message on Alison's phone. \n\n\nStill searching for Alison, Casey next called Luke. He explained how his mother was using Alison for bait, but Luke got confused. If Matt was no longer a suspect, the killer was still unknown. Luke and Noah discussed the latest developments, and Noah reasoned that whoever killed Elwood had to know that the boy was meeting the two of them on the bridge. Besides themselves, the only other person who knew was Kevin. \n\n\nKavin was at Al's Diner, and he called Mark Viro and told him the cops were looking for Matt, so Mark was safe for the moment. As Kevin hung up, Noah and Luke confronted him and demanded to know to whom he had been talking. Kevin denied everything as Noah grabbed his phone and wrestled it from him. Noah checked and announced the last person Kevin had called was Mark. Luke asked if Mark had killed Reg and Elwood, and Kevin said he had just found out that was true. He claimed he hadn't told anyone because he stuck by his friends. \n\n\nMark led Alison to the warehouse where Margo had suggested she meet Matt. Alison suspected Mark of killing Reg, but Mark claimed the pills Reg took were not bad and Reg must have had a weird reaction to them. Alison offered to get help for Mark until she realized Mark must have run down Elwood, as well. Mark complained that Elwood was going to talk, so he had pushed him off the bridge. \n\n\nMark mentioned Alison's porno video and asked her to \"put on a show\" for him. Alison refused, so Mark slapped her around as the girl's phone rang. It was Casey, but Alison pretended it was Matt and repeated that she was waiting for him at the warehouse on Fourth Street. Casey was perplexed, but the urgency in Alison's voice spurred him to action. As soon as Alison hung up her phone, Mark injected her with a drug that made her woozy. He injected her a second time and promised a third to make it look as if she had overdosed. \n\n\nSuddenly Matt dashed into the warehouse and pulled Mark off Alison, who was almost unconscious. Mark took off, but Matt chose to stay and look after Alison. He tried to rouse her, and he picked up the syringe to see what kind of drug Mark had given her. At that moment, Casey burst in and assumed that Matt had assaulted Alison. He hit Matt repeatedly and then scooped up Alison and ran out with her. \n\n\nJade got dressed up, but Lily was not pleased when her niece said she was going to find Casey at the hospital. Jade wanted to be there when Alison dumped him yet again. Lily tried to dissuade her, but Jade would not listen. \n\n\nAt the diner, Luke and Noah continued to question Kevin about Mark. Kevin said Mark had been especially weird since he had returned from rehab. Luke told Kevin he had to help them stop the killing, and he and Noah made Kevin call Mark, who did not pick up. Mark did call back almost immediately, however, and he asked Kevin to bring $500 in cash to the bridge where Elwood had died. Kevin agreed, so Noah called Margo at the police station and gave her the details. All three of the boys left for the rendezvous. \n\n\nAt the bridge, Luke and Noah hid off to the side as Kevin walked to the middle. Mark approached from the other side and asked for the money. Mark also spotted the boys hiding in the brush and yelled at Kevin for not coming alone. Kevin told Mark the madness had to stop, but that angered Mark, who hit Kevin with a heavy pipe. Luke and Noah ran on the bridge, but Mark began climbing the struts. The boys exchanged words as Mark lost his footing and clung to the railings. Luke and Noah struggled to hang on to him, and eventually they were able to drag Mark into the roadway. Margo and her cops arrived just in time and took Mark into custody. She gave the boys her usual vigilante speech and sent Luke and Noah home. \n\n\nAt Memorial, a doctor told Casey that Alison was stable. Casey sat and talked with her until she came around. Casey told her Matt could not hurt her any more, but a groggy Alison made it clear that Matt was not her assailant. Casey was stunned to learn the murderer was Mark Viro. When a beaten-up Matt walked in, Casey apologized as Alison described what happened. A chagrined Casey slunk out of the room, and Jade met him at the door and hugged him. Casey looked back at Matt and Alison through the glass and left with Jade.\n\n\n",
