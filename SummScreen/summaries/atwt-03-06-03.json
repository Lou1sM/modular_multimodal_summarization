He explains that he was so happy that she finally believed that he didn't sleep with Alison and he didn't think and it wasn't fair.  Lucy tells him that it is ok.  She tells him that she remembered something.  She holds up the cross necklace that he had given to her.  She tells him that she remembered that he bought it for her.  He is so happy that she had the necklace.  He tells her about her telling him that she liked the necklace and with his first paycheck from the country club, he had purchased the necklace for her.  She asks him to put the necklace around her neck.   He puts the necklace around her neck.  She says that she wishes she could remember him giving it to her.  He says that it will come.  She says that the last time he put the necklace on he didn't need to bend down.  He tells her to stop it.  She says that she is in a wheelchair and it must be rough for him.  He asks how is it rough for him.  She says that going out for ice cream sodas and holding hands can't be enough for him.  She reminds him that they had slept together.  He says, \"And that means what?  We can't hold hands anymore?\"  He takes her hand and kisses it.  She tells him that she is working hard on her physical therapy, but it feels like nothing is going to work right again.  He tells her that no matter what happens, he is always going to love her.  She says that she wishes she knew why.  He tells her that they don't have enough time for him to explain and she is looking so beautiful sitting there.  Lucy gets a smile on her face and asks him when it will be that he will kiss her again.  He says that he will kiss her again when she is ready.  She asks why is he sitting way over there.  Aaron gets a big smile on his face and leans across the table and kisses her.  \n\n\nCarly goes to Craig to ask for an advance so she can buy a place to live.  She tells him that she needs a place to create new designs and Mike and Molly are trying to get back together and she doesn't need to be there breathing down their necks.  Craig laughs at her and says that he knows her far to well.  He says that she is not concerned about Mike and Molly and she should come up with a new excuse.  Carly rolls her eyes.  She says that she needs her own space.  Craig asks if Mike prancing around in nothing but a towel is making her heart go pitter-pat.  Carly tells Craig that that is only his twisted sexual fantasy.  She adds that Mike could prance around in nothing but a hard hat and she wouldn't care.  She tells Craig that she just needs a place for her and Parker and the baby and maybe...Craig finishes her sentence and says that maybe she could get Jack back.  She tells him not to mock her.  She says that she needs Jack.  She asks, \"Will you help me, please.\"  Craig reminds her that Rosanna is fully involved with the business and she will notice huge sums of money missing from the business.  Carly says that he can handle Rosanna.  Craig says that Rosanna will come after him with her five-inch heel and bludgeon him to death.  Carly turns to him and says, \"Well, well.  You are afraid of a teensy-weensy blond.\"  Craig says, \"Damn right!\"  Craig tells Carly that he values their friendship but he is not going to risk antagonizing Rosanna.  Carly reminds him that when he needed it, she signed over a million dollars to him.  Craig looks at her and then says, \"I will talk to Rosanna.\"  He informs Carly that Rosanna may not forgive him.  Carly says that he is crazy.  She adds that just like her, Rosanna can't resist him.  She gives him a kiss on the cheek and makes him promise to call her after he talks to Rosanna.  They walk out together.  \n\n\nBack at the diner, Lucy and Aaron are finished visiting and Lily tells Aaron that it is time to go.  Lucy asks if she can go with Lily and Aaron back to Lily's house.  Rosanna hesitates.  Lily says that Rosanna is being put in a hard place because she is going against Craig's wishes.  Lucy asks if her father has called yet.  Rosanna says that he hasn't and Lucy says that he isn't worrying yet.  Lucy adds that Lily's house has a lot of memories for she and Aaron and going there might trigger her to remember something else.  Finally, Rosanna gives in and tells Lucy to hurry back.  Lily promises to get her back quickly.  Rosanna finds a booth and orders another cup of coffee.  She keeps looking at her watch and finally says, \"Come on Lucy.  I don't want Craig to kill me.\"  Craig shows up and sees Rosanna sitting at the booth.  He joins her and tells her that he has been looking all over town for her.  She says that she is sorry and she wasn't in the note-writing mood when she left their empty bed.  Craig says that they have some making up to do and she says that he has some groveling to do.  He tells her that is enough abuse.  He tells her that they can get his daughter and go out for some lunch.  He asks if Lucy is with her.  She says that she is.  He looks around and asks where is she.  Is she in the lady's room?  Rosanna says that being patronized is on the top of her pet peeve list.  Craig looks at her and tells her to tell him where is his daughter.   \n\n\nMolly asks Mike to come back to her.  He reminds her that there is the Carly factor.  Molly tells him that he cares more about Carly than he does her.  He says that he does care about her.  Molly tells him that he is being duped.  She says that she feels that Carly is playing the Nora card whenever she can.  He tells her that all Carly wants is Jack and a place to sleep.  Molly asks if he cares what she wants.  He begs her to tell him what that is and he will do it.  Molly says that she wants Mike to tell Carly to get out of his house before it is too late.  Mike asks, \"Too late for what?  Molly, is there somebody else?\"  Molly tells him that there is no one and she sits alone in her room every night and the jealousy consumes her.  She tells Mike to get Carly out of his house.  Mike tells her that this baby might be his daughter.  Molly says, \"It's a girl?\"  Mike tells her that he is not going to throw his daughter's mother out on the streets.  Molly says that he has it all wrong.  She says that it is all about Carly because she can't be without a man for five minutes and it's about Jack divorcing her.  Mike interrupts her and says that he sees what it is all about now.  Mike tells her that everything she has done was to make Carly suffer.  Molly looks at Mike for a second with tears in her eyes.  She says that she is just a terrible person.  Mike tells her that he can leave Carly a note and tell her that the cottage is hers and he will go and live at the Lakeview with Molly.  But, in a few days, Carly will call and she will need him to go with her to a doctor's appointment and he wonders how Molly will handle that.  Molly looks at him and says that it will never be the same.  Tears are streaming down her face and she walks out.  When she gets outside the door, she breaks down and cries.  She runs away from the cottage.  \n\n\nJessica calls Margo and asks for her to come and take Marshall out of her house.  Margo reminds her that if she comes over she will have to arrest Marshall.  Jessica tells her to come and arrest him.  She hangs up the phone and tells Marshall that the police will be arriving shortly and she would like him to wait in his room.  He tells her that he doesn't understand what is going on.  He says that he thought that she enjoyed herself last night.  Jessica looks mortified.  She tells him that what he did was assault her.  He starts to laugh and says that he knows what this is all about.  He tells her that she enjoyed herself and she doesn't want to admit it.  She yells and says that she wants him out of her house.  He looks at her and says, \"Then all you had to do is ask.\"  He goes upstairs to pack his clothes.  When Margo arrives with a police officer, they handcuff Marshall.  Margo asks Jessica if she wants to make a statement before they take Mr. Travers to the station.  Jessica says that there isn't any statement.  The officer takes Marshall out and Margo turns to Jessica and says that he is gone.  Jessica says, \"Good.\"  Margo asks if she would like to say anything now.  Jessica tells her that she has nothing to say.  Margo says that Jessica just had Marshall removed from her home and dropped him as a client and she wants to know what Marshall did to her.  Jessica says that Marshall did not do anything.  She says that she just changed her mind.  Margo says that she doesn't believe her.  Jessica tries to explain that she knew Marshall was grief stricken and she thought helping him out would ease her guilt that she was feeling.  Margo half accepts her explanation and says that she will inform Marshall that he will need new council.  Jessica starts to walk Margo to the door.  Margo stops and says that she can stay.  Jessica says that won't be necessary.  Margo tells her to call if she needs her.  As Margo opens the door to leave, Jessica is choking back the tears and Ben is standing at the door.  Jessica takes a big gulp and tries to smile.  Ben tells Margo that he has Indian food for their lunch and invites Margo to stay.  Margo looks back at Jessica and says that she needs to get back to the station.  Margo reminds Jessica to call her.  Margo leaves and Ben walks in all cheery.  He tells Jessica that it was good that Margo had to leave because he only has enough food for three.  He looks around and asks if Marshall is lurking somewhere.  Jessica tells him that Marshall has been taken back into custody.  Ben asks what happened and then he tells Jessica that is her business and it is the best news he has heard in a very long time.  He gives Jessica a kiss and then gets the food out for them.  They sit down to eat and Ben is talking about their trip to Barbados.  Jessica starts to think about Marshall forcing himself on her.  She snaps out of the nightmare and jumps up off the couch.  Ben asks if she is ok.  Jessica says that she is ok and it has been one of those days.  She asks Ben if they can get together later.  Ben asks if she is feeling guilty about Travers.  Jessica asks why should she be feeling guilty.  Ben tells her that he is not going to pry, but if she needs to talk, he is always there.  Jessica says that Marshall took him staying with her to mean something else and she ended it.  Ben asks again if she is ok.  She tells him that she is and she just needs some time alone.  Ben says that he understands and she walks him to the door.  When she closes the door, she locks it and puts the chain on the door.  \n\n\nAt the police station, Marshall is taken into the interrogation room and has his handcuffs taken off.  He turns to Margo and says that all this is a big mistake and he and Jessica had just had a disagreement.  Margo says that is must have been some disagreement since Jessica refuses to be his council.  Marshall says that everyone knows that he and Jessica have a volatile relationship.  Margo asks how volatile are they talking.  Marshall says that he is not going to discuss his personal issues with her or anyone else.  Margo says that Jessica is not talking and he is tap dancing and she wants to know what is up and she will find out what it is.  He tells her that what she will find is nothing.  He tells Margo that he wants to make his phone call.  Margo leaves the interrogation room.  Later, she comes back and Marshall informs her that his new council is on his or her way.  Margo asks if the new council has any idea how they are going to spring him from this joint.  He says that they don't, but he does.  She informs him that his bail has already been denied.  Marshall tells Margo to believe him when he says that in a few hours he will be sitting at the Lakeview Lounge enjoying a scotch, neat.  Margo says, \"Wow, your confidence is awe inspiring.  Let's hope your right.\"  She turns and leaves the interrogation room.  After she is gone, he says, \"Oh, I know I am.\"\n\n\nCarly shows up at the cottage and catches Mike crying.  She says that she will just go to her room.  Mike composes himself and says that he is fine.  Carly says that he could have fooled her.  She asks if things didn't go well with Molly.  He tells her that Molly came there to see him and told him that she wanted him back.  Carly says that is great and she will go and pack her stuff.  She looks at Mike and asks if that is good news.  Mike says that Molly can't get over the fact that he may be a father soon and that Carly will be a part of his life forever.  Carly sits with Mike and says that if her living there is a problem then she is getting some money together and she will be getting her own place.  Mike says that he doesn't think that will make any difference.  He tells Carly that he has to go to work.  He gets up and leaves the room.  Carly watches him leave and then she says, \"If you can't get Molly back, then I will have to get her back for you.\"  Carly gets up and leaves the cottage.  \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Jessica argues with Marshall, who claims he did nothing to her that she didnt want. Jessica makes good on her threat to have Marshall ejected from her house. Later, Margo is surprised when Jessica says she is no longer Marshalls lawyer. Ben is thrilled by the news. Mike is skeptical when Molly offers to move back in with him. He thinks Mollys change of heart has nothing to do with Mike and is an indication of how much Molly hates Carly. In the end, they part again. Carly sees Mikes distress and is determined to go to Molly on her own. Dusty pays Molly a visit and they begin kissing. Craig wants to know what spurred Carly to want to move out of Mikes place. After many excuses, she admits that she wants to reconcile with Jack. Craig is resistant, but finally agrees to ask Rosanna for an advance on Carlys behalf.

Aaron gave her back the necklace he bought for her back in the summer & they shared a kiss. Lily allowed them to visit more at her house. Craig arrived on the scene wondering where Lucy was.
