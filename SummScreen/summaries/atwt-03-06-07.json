    "tvmega_recap": "Katie can't believe Henry and Vienna's news. Luke and Holden talk, rather awkwardly, about how he doesn't think he is going to attend Spring Break because he doesn't have anyone special. Dusty tries to force Emily to tell Jack what happened when he notices her face, but she angrily puts him in his place. Cheri interrupts when she calls demanding to see Emily because of Elliott. Gwen is about to tell Will what went on between her and Adam when she sees how hurt he is. Maddie intercedes on Gwen's behalf and explains Adam attacked Gwen, but she convinced her not to tell anyone since he didn't actually rape her and that Adam is gone forever. Will is distraught and this propels him onto a mission to find Adam one way or another to make sure he pays. Katie and Henry disagree on Henry's role in Vienna's life and not to mention the role of taking on her money to keep her from having to turn it over to Leonia; Henry won't budge and even signs the papers in front of Katie. Emily arrives at Cheri and ends up being required to attend a group party. Dusty follows her and goes inside. Gwen and Maddie are concerned about Will running off half-cocked, but their fear is interrupted when they see Jade receiving flowers from Adam. Maddie doesn't believe he sent them and Jade wonders if Maddie sent them? Emily spies Dusty at the party and hides. She gets Cheri to cover for her, much to her dismay. Dusty sees her leave and heads out after her, only to bump into someone else. Katie finds Jack at Al's, where he is forced to admit that he used his kids as an excuse. Katie tries to hide being hurt, but tells him it is for the best since she turns everyone against her sooner or later. Jack wants to stay with her and talk. Meg offers Holden a shoulder. Will tells Jade and Luke about Adam attacking Gwen. They all wonder what Adam is up to? Vienna is able to get Henry's mind off of Katie. Gwen receives a package from \u0091AM' and proceeds to freak out. When she opens it, inside is her wedding band that she lost while burying Adam.",
