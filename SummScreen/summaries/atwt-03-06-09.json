    "soap_central": "\n\nHenry brought Katie flowers as a peace offering for having been so upset about Katie's baby plans. Henry told Katie that she had stolen his heart years before and still had it, and he would do almost anything for her. Katie thought he meant he had changed his mind about letting Vienna provide both an egg and act as a surrogate for Brad and Katie's child. Henry said absolutely not, because no matter how hard he tried, he could not see the baby as anything but Vienna and Brad's child. \n\n\nHenry told Katie he was worried by how much Vienna wanted to act as the surrogate, because he was afraid Vienna would end up wanting to keep the baby for herself. Katie said that wasn't going to happen. Katie pointed out that it would be to Henry's advantage to let Vienna do something she so clearly wanted to do and that she so strongly believed would make her happy, because it would make Henry a hero to Vienna. \n\n\nBrad went to the diner to have breakfast. Vienna waited on him and told him she thought Henry was being impossible. Vienna took away Brad's breakfast plate, saying she couldn't stand to hear the word \"eggs,\" much less see them and smell them. She then rushed off, telling Brad she thought she was having \"a mental morning sickness.\" Brad told her he didn't think there was such a thing as \"mental morning sickness,\" and he asked if Vienna could possibly be pregnant. Vienna insisted that wasn't it, because she had taken home pregnancy tests almost every day, but they had all turned out negative. She asked Brad to take her home, because she felt like she was going to be sick all day. \n\n\nAfter Vienna got back to her suite at the Lakeview, she undressed and put a robe on over her bra and panties. She asked Brad to rub peppermint oil on her back, because it would help with her nausea. Henry, of course, came into the room just as Brad was rubbing oil on Vienna's back, and he immediately reacted angrily. Henry said it appeared Brad and Vienna had decided to forego the whole \"artificial\" part of the artificial insemination. Both Vienna and Brad tried to tell Henry that wasn't what was happening. Henry was in no mood to hear them out, and when Brad said he wasn't going to leave until he knew Vienna was okay, Henry threw a punch at him. Brad ducked, and Henry's fist slammed into the wall. \n\n\nKatie called Brad to tell him she had great news, but Brad said he was busy and would talk to her later. After he hung up, Vienna told Brad he should leave, and Henry told him not to ever come back. Henry went to close the door and said he couldn't believe he had almost let Katie talk him into the whole insemination/surrogate deal. \n\n\nAfter Brad left, Vienna became upset with Henry. She told him he should know better than to think she was cheating on him with one of their best friends. She reminded him that she had agreed to give up a dream she'd had since childhood, of being a mother, because Henry had told her she had to choose between being with him and fulfilling that dream. She said she had made a tremendous sacrifice for him because she loved him so much. Henry softened and apologized, saying he knew she loved him. \n\n\nVienna asked if Henry thought she was unaware that he still had deep feelings for Katie. She said she understood that, but she didn't let it make her jealous, and all she wanted was for Henry to show her the same trust. Vienna told Henry that if she couldn't have a baby of her own, she wanted to give Brad and Katie a baby. \n\n\nBrad went home, where Katie told him she thought she had convinced Henry to go through with the baby deal. Brad had to tell her what had happened with Vienna. Brad apologized for having ruined things, but Katie told him it wasn't his fault. She then put on a happy face and showed Brad a computer Web site she had found where people could pick out all the characteristics they wanted their child to have, from hair color to athletic ability. Brad said it sounded like picking out a new car, fully loaded, and Katie ignored the disapproval in his tone and said it was going to be great. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna came to the door. Henry apologized to Brad for the scene he had caused earlier, but Brad told him no apology was necessary. Vienna then prompted Henry, and he said he had given it more thought, and that since he and Vienna felt that Brad and Katie were like family, and Vienna and Katie obviously really wanted the baby thing to work out, he was in favor of giving it a try. Katie was ecstatic and hugged Henry, then Vienna, thanking them both profusely. Brad asked if Henry was sure, and he said he was. Vienna said since it was settled, there was no time to lose. She told Brad, \"Let's get me pregnant!\" and she hugged him. \n\n\nCraig and Johnny ran into Lucy at the Lakeview. Craig asked if Lucy could babysit Johnny again, and she told him she would love to do it. Dusty overheard. Craig told Lucy his meeting wouldn't take more than a couple of hours and that he would be in the dining room of the hotel if she needed him. He gave her his room key and left after hugging Johnny goodbye. Dusty walked by, and Johnny leaped into his arms. Dusty told Lucy he'd overheard her conversation, and Lucy asked if he wanted to join them on their play date. Johnny said excitedly, \"Please say yes!\" Dusty said he took his orders from Johnny, so the answer was \"yes.\" Lucy suggested they take separate elevators to Craig's room, just to be careful, and she left with Johnny. \n\n\nEmily went to Fairwinds to see Paul and asked him if Meg had gotten jealous after seeing Emily with Paul, \"canoodling.\" Paul said Meg wouldn't make the first move even if she were jealous. Soon afterward, they heard Meg calling Paul's name. Paul told Emily to hide behind the sofa, and Meg walked in to find what appeared to be a sleeping Paul, lying alone on the sofa. \n\n\nMeg told Paul she had come to apologize for giving him a hard time when she saw him with Emily. She then told Paul that he had every right to be with anyone he wanted, even Emily Stewart. Paul told Meg he owed her an apology, because he and Emily had forgotten they were in public when Meg saw them together. Meg said she realized she had no reason to be jealous, since she and Paul were divorced. Meg told Paul they both had a right to be happy, and she said goodbye and walked out, with Paul shouting her name in an effort to stop her from leaving. Paul turned to Emily and asked, \"What was that?\" Emily said she thought Meg had just asked Paul's permission to have sex with Dusty. \n\n\nEmily told Paul that Meg had wanted to make sure Paul knew she was okay with him moving on, so that Meg could move on with Dusty. Paul thought Emily was crazy, but Emily said Paul was in denial. Paul got mad when Emily said he should try to find out for sure how involved Dusty and Meg were. Emily decided to leave. She told Paul to find someone else to help him, but Paul stopped her and said he needed her help. \n\n\nMeg went to the Lakeview and found Dusty sitting alone at a table in the lounge having coffee. Meg sat down and told Dusty she had hoped to find him, because she thought they needed to talk since they had kissed the other day. Dusty said he agreed, and he went first, telling Meg that it had been a mistake to kiss her and that he wouldn't put her in that position again. \n\n\nMeg, obviously surprised, agreed and said they needed to stick to their agreement to be friends. She then asked Dusty if he wanted to spend some time with her that day as her friend, because she didn't have to work. Dusty's cell phone rang, and it was Lucy, letting him know it was okay for him to go up to Craig's room. Dusty explained the situation to Meg and excused himself to go upstairs. \n\n\nUp in Craig's room, Dusty found Johnny busy drawing pictures. He asked Johnny to draw a picture of him, and Johnny sat down to try to draw Dusty. Lucy tossed a ball of paper at Dusty, and he threw it back, which started a paper ball war that ended with Dusty and Lucy falling together on the sofa as Johnny busily drew his portrait. \n\n\nMeg saw Craig on her way out of the lounge, and since it looked like he was headed back to his room, she stopped him. Craig tried to leave, saying his business meeting had been cancelled, and he wanted to spend some time with Johnny. Meg told Craig she wanted him to know how happy she was that things were working out for him with Johnny. Craig immediately reminded Meg that she and Dusty had conspired to try to keep him from being awarded custody of his son. Meg agreed but said since the court had awarded custody to Craig, everyone could see how happy Johnny was, and they were all happy for Craig and for Johnny. \n\n\nCraig said Meg's remarks were very suspicious, and he decided she was trying to get on his good side in order to convince him to let Dusty spend time with Johnny. Meg said that would be good for Johnny, but Craig told her it would never happen. After Craig got on the elevator, Meg called Dusty to warn him that Craig was on his way back to the room. \n\n\nWhen Craig got back to his room, he found Lucy putting Johnny's coat on, and he asked where they were going. Lucy said she had decided to take Johnny to the park to swing, and she had planned to let the desk clerk know where they would be so that Craig wouldn't worry. She invited Craig to join them, and Craig agreed. Craig saw the picture Johnny had been drawing and picked it up, asking, \"Who's this?\" Johnny answered, \"Daddy!\" Craig glanced at it and approvingly told Johnny it did look like him. He led the way out of the hotel room as Lucy held up a silencing finger to Johnny. \n\n\nMeg went up to see Dusty. She told him that he shouldn't expect her to run interference for him and Lucy again, but Dusty pointed out that he hadn't asked her to do it that time. Meg reminded Dusty that Craig was a dangerous and smart man, and she said it was only a matter of time before Craig found out what Dusty and Lucy were doing. Dusty said he wasn't worried about Craig, and he asked why Meg was so worked up about the whole thing. Dusty asked if Meg was jealous. She denied it at first, but then she stopped herself, walked up to Dusty, and kissed him. \n\n\nPaul and Emily went to the Lakeview, and Emily found out from the bartender that Meg had recently gone upstairs. Paul assumed Meg had gone to see Dusty. Paul turned and headed for the elevator. When Paul got to Dusty's room, he put his ear near the door and could hear the heavy breathing inside. Emily grabbed Paul before he could try to kick the door down, saying, \"Don't do this!\" Emily convinced Paul that if he broke into the room and started throwing punches, Meg would be forced to side with Dusty, and it might be enough to make Meg forbid Paul from ever seeing Eliza again. Paul decided Meg was right, and together, they went back downstairs. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Meg and Dusty kissed passionately and fell onto Dusty's bed, but they stopped, and Meg asked, \"What are we doing?\" Meg apologized for having started something without finishing it, but Dusty said she had nothing to be sorry about. He told her if the time was right, they would both know, and then he kissed her. \n\n\nCraig returned to the Lakeview with Johnny and Lucy. Craig sent Johnny over to get a lollipop from a hotel employee, and Lucy said Johnny deserved it for having named all the birds they had seen at the park. Craig said Lucy must have taught that to Johnny; she said she had, and that she remembered when Craig had taught it to her when she was about Johnny's age. She told her father that she'd never forgotten that, and then she pointed out that the two of them seemed to be doing better. Craig agreed, so Lucy asked if he wanted to go have some hot chocolate. He said yes, and they went to the restaurant. \n\n\nPaul and Emily went downstairs and saw Lucy, Craig, and Johnny drinking their hot chocolate. Paul wondered why they suddenly seemed to be one big happy family and whether it had anything to do with Meg being upstairs with Dusty. Craig and Johnny finished their drinks, said goodbye to Lucy, and headed upstairs. Paul told Emily he was going to try to find out what was going on. Emily said she couldn't stay to babysit, so she wished Paul luck, and left. \n\n\nPaul saw Dusty and Meg getting off the elevator, so he ducked out of sight. Lucy walked by in time to see Dusty whispering something in Meg's ear that made Meg laugh. Meg told Dusty goodbye, and left. Lucy greeted Dusty and told him he and Meg looked happy. Dusty asked when she thought he could see Johnny again. Lucy told him she didn't know, but Craig was definitely warming up to her. Dusty thanked her for having let him spend time with his son, and then he left. \n\n\nPaul approached Lucy and sarcastically welcomed her back to town, asking why she wasn't in jail. She explained that Dusty had cleared her of any charges and that she was trying to return the favor by mending fences between Dusty and her father. Paul said he wanted to know why she was really in town. Lucy told Paul that she had missed Johnny too much and had come back to make sure he was happy and healthy-and that Dusty and Craig didn't kill each other. Paul said that might be easier said than done, and he reminded Lucy that he knew that she hated her father as much as anyone else did. Lucy said, \"Don't be too sure. Things can change,\" and she walked away.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
