Casey apologized but told his mother that he couldn't let Ameera be arrested. Tom arrived and told Margo and Casey the judge had told him that due to some bureaucratic error, the case against Casey had been dropped. \n\n\nAlison went to the Hughes' house and asked Matt if there was any word on Casey. Matt told her Tom and Margo had gone to the station, and he was certain they would have things worked out in no time. Because of the phone call she had overheard Matt make the night before, Alison realized that Matt was so confident because he had something to do with making the charges against Casey go away. Matt denied that the phone call had anything to do with Casey, but Alison didn't believe him. \n\n\nMatt confessed that Alison was right, and he said he had called a government agent he had known before prison and asked him to get Casey off the hook. Alison wondered what the man wanted in return, but Matt said nothing. Matt didn't understand why it mattered to Alison how he managed to get Casey freed as long as it happened. Alison said it mattered because she was beginning to like Matt and wanted to be able to get to know him, but he kept hiding who he really was. \n\n\nTom and Margo came home with Casey and told Alison and Matt that the charges had been dropped. Margo said they didn't know how it happened, and Alison told her she should ask Matt, since he was the one who made the deal. Matt said he'd contacted someone he had known for a long time and asked if he could help, but Matt said he couldn't name names. Alison asked why he wasn't telling Tom and Margo the rest of the story, and Matt said it wasn't important. Alison said Matt had met the man before he went to prison. Tom and Margo were surprised to find out Matt had been in prison. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Cowboy Jack sat in Carly's living room. Jack told Carly he had searched the whole neighborhood but hadn't found any sign of Kit. Jack was puzzled as to why Kit would take Cowboy Jack out of the trunk of his car, sneak it into Carly's house, and leave the dummy there but not try to kill Carly. Carly told Jack she thought Kit had a much creepier plan. Jack wanted to go see Margo, since the police protection didn't seem to be doing them any good, but Carly suggested that instead, they go back to plan A: use Carly as bait to lure Kit out into the open again. \n\n\nWhen Parker came downstairs, Jack said he would take him to school, although Parker didn't want to go because he was worried about Carly. Carly assured Parker she would be fine, and she said she would just go to the store to get some groceries so they wouldn't all starve. Jack and Parker didn't like the idea of Carly going anywhere, but Carly insisted she would be okay because of her police protection. \n\n\nJack called Carly to check on her as she was loading her groceries into her car. Carly told Jack she could see her police protection nearby in the parking lot. She hung up and got into her car, but when she adjusted her rearview mirror, she saw Cowboy Jack in the backseat. Jack arrived and questioned the surveillance officer as to how the dummy got in the car without him seeing it. The officer said he'd gone for a soda while Carly was inside getting groceries. Jack told the cop he was going to call off the surveillance because it was useless. \n\n\nAt Tom and Margo's, Matt explained that he and Casey had been cellmates. As Margo tried to digest this information, her cell phone rang. It was Jack, who told her why he wanted the surveillance withdrawn. Jack told Margo he and Carly wanted to use Carly as bait to draw Kit into the open and get her to confess to Sam's murder, after which Jack could arrest Kit. Margo reminded Jack that he wasn't on the force anymore, so Jack withdrew his resignation. Margo accepted and told him to be careful. Margo then asked to speak to the surveillance cop, Joe; she told Joe to act like he was going off duty but keep Jack and Carly in sight. Jack left with Carly and, as they drove away, an apparently homeless woman pushing a cart turned to look at them; it was Kit. \n\n\nMargo and Tom asked Casey how he could lie to them about Matt. Matt said it was his fault. He had asked Casey to lie because he could see what a supportive family Casey had, and he hoped to be able to share in that support. Margo told Matt that lying wasn't the best way to ingratiate himself into her family, but Matt pointed out that Margo probably wouldn't have let him stay there if she had known he was Casey's ex-cellmate. Matt explained that Casey felt that he owed Matt something because Matt helped him get released from prison early. Margo asked what kind of people Matt knew who had that kind of power. \n\n\nMatt explained that he'd seen a crooked guard at the prison accept something he shouldn't have from a prisoner. This was the same guard who had caused Casey's sentence to be extended in the first place. Matt said he reported the guard to someone he knew in the warden's office, and the warden's office asked what they could do for Matt in return. Matt had asked for Casey to be released. Margo wondered why he had gone out of his way to be so good to her son. Matt said it was because Casey had always had his back. Tom asked again exactly whom Matt knew in the federal government, and Matt again said he wasn't at liberty to say. Tom then asked exactly what it was Matt had done that had landed him in jail in the first place. Matt related that he had stolen some cars when he was younger, but he said he had done his time and hoped they wouldn't hold it against him. \n\n\nMargo said she had to go back to the station, and Tom had a meeting with a client, but they both told Matt and Casey that their conversation wasn't over. As Margo left, she thanked Matt for his help. After Tom and Margo left, Matt said that went pretty well considering Alison had shot her mouth off about his past. Alison said she felt Tom and Margo deserved to know the truth. Casey walked out of the room as Matt told him a simple \"thank you\" would be nice. Alison left, saying it was obvious Matt and Casey had things to discuss. Matt followed her out and asked why everyone was so down on him when he was just trying to help a friend. Alison told Matt she could tell he was spinning his story for Tom and Margo, and she wasn't buying it. She told Matt to call her when he was ready to tell her the truth. \n\n\nAlison went to the Lakeview and found Tom. She asked Tom if he had bought everything Matt had said; Tom said no, but given how much Matt had helped Casey, Margo was basically in Matt's corner. Alison said she'd spent some time with Matt and felt that something just wasn't right with him. Tom said it was probably best for all of them to keep their guard up around Matt. Alison thanked Tom, and Tom left; Matt, who had just walked into the room and seen the two of them together, ducked out of sight. \n\n\nWhen Tom had gone, Matt walked up to Alison and said, \"You are just determined to blow this for me, aren't you?\" Matt told Alison all he wanted to do was hold down a job, make some decent friends, and start over. Alison said she understood that, and Matt asked if they were cool. Alison said they were, but as she left, she looked very troubled. \n\n\nCasey went to the police station to see his mom. He apologized for having lied to her about Matt and for having gotten into trouble with the Homeland Security people the previous night. Casey then said he thought maybe it would be best if Matt moved out, because it wasn't good for Casey to have a reminder of his past living right in his house. Margo asked if Matt had agreed to this, and Casey said no. Margo thought that other than having lied about being in prison, Matt had been a pretty good influence on Casey. Margo told Casey to go home and sleep on it, and they would talk in the morning. \n\n\nLuke, Noah, Lily, and Holden went to visit Ameera at the local office of the Department of Homeland Security. Holden told the agent who greeted them that they were there to find out why Ameera was being held. The agent replied that when Ameera registered for classes at Oakdale University, her background check had shown connections to a known terrorist. However, after the agents had interviewed Ameera and she had told them about Colonel Mayer, the agency performed a more extensive background check and found out everything she had told them was true. \n\n\nThe agent told Holden and his family that despite the terrorist connection having been proven false, Ameera's visa had expired, and she would have to leave the country immediately. Holden offered to sponsor Ameera, but the agent said she would need a student visa, and for that, she would have to go back to Iraq and reapply like everyone else. The agent said that without a spouse, parent, or child to sponsor her, Ameera had to return to Iraq. He said the Snyders could take Ameera home with them for a few days so she could put her affairs in order before being deported. \n\n\nThe Snyders returned to the farm, where Holden said they would find an immigration lawyer and see what could be done for Ameera. Luke and Noah went outside, and Noah told Luke he thought he should marry Ameera to enable her to stay in the country. Luke was stunned and asked how far Noah would be willing to take this proposed marriage to Ameera. Noah said it would be a marriage in name only, but Luke wasn't so sure that this wasn't an excuse for Noah to go back into the closet. Noah apologized to Luke but said they had a chance to save a life, and he believed they needed to do it. Luke said he just needed to know one thing: did Noah love him? Noah said, \"I love you more than you'll ever know.\" Luke said that was all he needed to hear. \n\n\nLuke and Noah went inside and told Holden and Lily what Noah planned to do. Holden and Lily asked Noah if he understood what he was getting himself into. Noah and Luke said they wanted to go ahead with their plan and have Noah and Ameera continue to live at the farm, but they wanted Holden and Lily to help them. Ameera walked into the kitchen, and Noah told her their plan, explaining that the marriage would only last until Ameera could obtain citizenship. Ameera asked Holden and Lily what they thought of this arrangement. They said they had agreed to support Noah and Luke as long as they understood the responsibility involved. Ameera thanked them all and told Noah she would marry him. \n\n\nBack at Carly's house, Jack spotted Joe, the surveillance cop, who said he couldn't disobey Margo's orders. Jack told Carly about this, and she wondered what they could do to trap Kit. Jack helped Carly put away the dishes, commenting that he didn't even know where things went in his kitchen anymore, but Carly pointed out it hadn't been Jack's kitchen in a long time. Carly told Jack he could leave, but Jack said he didn't want to leave her alone while Kit was still out there somewhere. Carly said she was going to take a hot bath and invited Jack to join her; Jack chuckled and said he'd stay right where he was. As Jack went into the kitchen to get a drink, he heard Carly scream. When he went upstairs to the bathroom, he saw Cowboy Jack sitting in Carly's bathtub. \n\n\n\n\n",
