Holden tells her that Lily refuses to get help for her obsession with Rose's death and now he needs to keep her away from the kids until she gets herself some much needed mental help.  She needs to commit herself to a mental hospital.  Molly offers any help she can give and tells Holden not to blame himself for Lily's condition.\n\n\nAt Lucinda's, Lily complains about Holden to her mother.  Lily wants the name of the private investigator Lucinda uses so Lily can hire him to find where Holden is keeping the children.  Lucinda refuses to help her and urges her to get professional help.  Lily claims she does not need to be institutionalized and is horrified that her mother is siding with Holden on this.\n\n\nAt the coffee shop, Lucy remembers Aaron's pleas for her to testify against Clark at the trial.  Madison comes in and reminds her that Clark's father is connected to unsavory characters and that they should be afraid of him.  Madison also feels sorry for Alison for having her past brought up on the stand.  No way is Madison subjecting herself to that.\n\n\nIn court, Alison tells her story about the attempted rape by Clark.  Tom finishes his questions and Clark's attorney begins a brutal cross-examination.  In the hall outside the courtroom, Susan Stewart and Kim Hughes run into one another.  Susan verbally confronts Kim about her treatment of Alison and Kim defends herself and says she is in court to support Alison.\n\n\nJack arrives at Paul's following a summons from Paul.  Paul is worried that Rosanna has been out of touch with him for several days.  He tells Jack that Rosanna has been on the island of St. Bart's in the Caribbean since she left Oakdale, but she has checked out suddenly and he is worried about her.  Paul was Rosanna's only way of keeping tabs on Carly and Lucy, and it would be unlike her to cut off all contact with him.  Jack promises to make some phone calls.\n\n\nDuring cross examination, Clark's attorney brings up the sad story of Will Munson's burning down the Snyder barn and Alison's allowing him to take the blame for a crime she committed.  Next, the attorney moves on to Will's murder of Rose, and explains that Alison is mentioned in the psychiatrist's report for affecting Will's emotional state.  Then he moves on to Alison's tricking Aaron into marrying her and the subsequent miscarriage of her baby.   Chris can't stand this badgering of Alison and cries out from the courtroom.\n\n\nLily calls Holden and asks if she can come home to talk to him.  He agrees and Lily arrives much calmer and apologizes for her behavior.   Then she notices the kids' belongings all packed.  Holden goes to make coffee, and Lily hits \"redial\" on his cell phone.  The children's babysitter, Dawn, answers, and Lily can hear Luke in the background talking about ice cream.  Lily realizes they are at the coffee shop, and she leaves hurriedly.  Holden returns and realizes that Lily knows where the children are.  He makes a fast call to Molly, asking for her help.\n\n\nLucy comes back to Paul's and asks him to take her for a drive so she can forget about the trial going on.  She does not want to be tempted into testifying as Aaron wants.  Paul reminds her that Aaron and Alison cooked up the plan to trap Clark to help Lucy, but Lucy has a hard time forgiving them for hurting her.  \n\n\nJohn runs into Lucinda in the lounge of the Lakeview and they chat about Lily and how she has turned to Dusty for help.  Lucinda tells John about the foundation for Rose, and John tells her not to trust Dusty who does nothing unless there is something in it for him.\n\n\nJack returns to Paul's and reports that Rosanna checked out from the hotel in St. Bart's and withdrew a million dollars from her account.  Paul then receives a telegram from Rosanna in which she says she has come across a business opportunity for Cabot Motors and that she will be out of touch with him for a while.  Paul seems satisfied with this explanation, but Jack is not buying it.\n\n\nHolden confronts Lily at the coffee shop when she arrives to see the children.  Lily pleads with him to tell her where they are, but Holden remains firm.  When Lily has received treatment at a mental facility, then she can resume her relationship with the children. \n\n\nMolly has the Snyder children safe in her suite in the Lakeview.  Meanwhile, in court, Clark's lawyer asks Alison the ultimate question:  why should anyone believe her when she has such a history of lying?  Before Alison can answer, Lucy rushes into the courtroom and answers the question herself.  \"Because,\" she says, \"he has done this before.\"\n\n\n",
