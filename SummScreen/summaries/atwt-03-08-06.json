    "tvmega_recap": "Casey and Maddie help to make Will and Gwen's wedding night as romantic as possible by borrowing some of the Lakeview's flower arrangements and raiding the kitchen. Luke confronts Jade after he suspects her of trying to steal his mother's bracelet. Lily suspects Jade's motives after hearing about her claims to Holden of learning how to knit in the orphanage and then especially after Emma comes to them with tales of finding Jade with her bracelet in the barn and Luke trying to cover for her.

Luke tries to understand, so Jade shows how he can trust her when she calls Kevin and sets up a secret meeting for them. Margo catches Maddie and Casey at the Lakeview, but Casey explains they were there to meet Lisa. He later worries to Maddie that he will be grounded for life after his parents find out what he did for Will and Gwen but it was worth it to make up for how he treated Gwen. For the first time in a long while, he feels good about himself. Maddie and Casey see Nick being led out of the Lakeview, but the men he is with act as if he is drunk. Lily questions Jade about if she left the orphanage at such a young age, how she could have learned to knit? An unknowing Kevin meets Luke, but when he finds out it was a set up, he is not pleased. Carly calls Chardonnay to ask about the pictures, and she ominously tells her that she no longer has to worry about Nick. Jack sees Nick being beaten by Anatoli's goons and tries to help, which leads Nick and Jack into the middle of a gun fight.",
