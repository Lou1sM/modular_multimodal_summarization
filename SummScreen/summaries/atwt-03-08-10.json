    "soap_central": "\n\n \nMolly went to Faith's boarding school and introduced herself to the headmistress as \"Faith Snyder's mother.\"  Miss Gibson, however, recognized Molly as \"that TV reporter from Oakdale.\"  Molly confessed, but she told Miss Gibson that Sage's father was in jail on \"trumped-up charges,\" and then she asked to whom the woman had released an underage student.  Molly hinted that bad publicity was very different from good, and she asked Miss Gibson to describe the man who had taken Sage.  \"Tall, thin, very convincing, and with an Italian accent,\" said Miss Gibson, and Molly uttered, \"Oh, my God!  Damian.\"\n\n\nFaith talked with Damian on the phone, and he again threatened that Lily was in danger from the people who were after him.  Faith said she wasn't so sure she believed that, but Damian ordered her to get Lily to a house in Forest Hills within the next two hours.  Faith hung up. Lily entered the room and asked who had called her daughter.  Faith said that she had decided to go back to school right away, and Lily had to drive her.  Lily was pleased at the choice her daughter had made, but she said she couldn't take her that day.\n\n\nFaith improvised by saying that her friend Deanna was home with a broken leg, and her parents were driving her back to school, so Faith could catch a ride with her.  All Lily had to do was take her to Forest Hills as soon as possible.  The girl did ask to make one stop first, however.  That stop was the police station, because Faith wanted to say goodbye to her dad.\n\n\nAt the station, Holden was in handcuffs in preparation for his move to the county jail.  He was frustrated at being moved further from his family, but he didn't mention it when Lily and Faith arrived.  Lily explained that she was driving their daughter to Forest Hills to get a ride back to school, and Faith kissed her father goodbye and told him that she knew he hadn't done what the police said he had.  After the family left, an officer entered to take Holden to his transport, but Holden struggled physically.  Just then, Molly ran in and asked the cop for five minutes with the man she loved, and he agreed.\n\n\nMolly said she had gone to the school and learned that Damian had removed Faith from the grounds.  Holden was frantic when he realized that Damian was probably manipulating Faith to lead Lily into a trap.  He spoke to the policeman who was insisting that it was time for Holden to go to the county lockup.  On the way out of the jail, Holden faked a medical emergency and slumped to the ground.  When the cop bent over to check him, Holden was able to put his handcuffs around the officer's neck until the man passed out.  Then Holden got the key and unlocked the cuffs and took off.  Molly picked him up in her car at a designated spot and asked where they were going.\n\n\nLily decided to stop for snacks on their way to Forest Hills, but Faith was stressed and unhappy that a stop would delay them.  Lily questioned the girl about being so rattled, but Faith assured her mother that everything was all right.  Faith's phone dinged with a text message, and she claimed that the message was from her friend, asking where they were.  Lily was suspicious, so she grabbed Faith's phone from her and read the message: \"Hope you are doing your part.  Max.\"  Faith lied further, but Lily knew something was very wrong.  She insisted that her daughter tell her the truth, so Faith tearfully told Lily that \"Max\" was really Damian, and he wanted to see Lily.\n\n\nLily was furious until Faith explained how Damian had snatched her from school with horror stories of people who were after him and not above hurting Lily, as well.  Lily explained how Damian had lied to her and faked his own death.  Then she demanded to know what the text meant, and it dawned on Lily that they were going to Forest Hills to meet Damian.  Lily screamed that Damian was a pathological liar, and no one could believe a word that flew out of his mouth.  \"You used to,\" cried Faith, as Lily took the phone and called the police.  Her connection was poor, but she repeated Damian's name and the Forest Hills address several times.\n\n\nLily began driving and declared that she was tired of all the lies, and she was going to confront Damian.  They arrived at the address in Forest Hills, and Lily told Faith to wait in the car for the police.  She walked to the house and opened the front door.  She called to Damian, but he did not answer.  She walked around a bit until Damian appeared behind her, saying \"Cara!\"  He appeared pleased that she was there.\n\n\nMeanwhile in the car, a very nervous Faith removed a medicine bottle from her purse and swallowed a pill.\n\n\nIn Memorial, Janet was stunned at the news that she was pregnant. The doctor, not realizing that Dusty was not Janet's husband, said that he would give her and \"Mr. Snyder\" a private moment.  When the doctor left, Dusty asked Janet if she was 100 percent sure that the baby was Jack's and not his.  Janet was horrified at Dusty's suggestion, but he reminded her that they had slept together on New Year's Eve, and the doctor had not mentioned how far advanced the pregnancy was.  Janet was sure there was no possibility that the baby was Dusty's, but he said they had to consider it.  Janet said the baby had to be Jack's because it would be a match for Liberty's bone marrow.  She picked up her phone to call Jack.\n\n\nJack and Carly went upstairs in her house and collapsed on the bed.  They laughed with joy at being together again, and Jack told her that she was more precious to him than he ever thought possible.  They made love and vowed never to let go of each other again.  Jack swore that he was Carly's forever, just as his phone rang.  He answered it, and appeared surprised that Janet was still in the hospital.  \"We did it!\" Janet cried joyously.  She gave him the news that she was pregnant.\n\n\nJack and Carly got dressed, and Carly was obviously upset.  She had thought that Jack and Janet were no longer having marital relations, but she declared what was done was done.  Jack said he had to go see Janet, but nothing had changed for them.  Carly looked at him sadly and said, \"Everything has changed.\"  She asked Jack to go see his wife, but Jack was torn.  He was almost out the door when he turned back, ran up the stairs, and kissed Carly again.\n\n\nWhile she was waiting for Jack to arrive, Janet told Dusty that women knew \"about these things,\" and the baby was Jack's.  Jack showed up and correctly guessed that he had walked in on something between Janet and Dusty.  \"You did,\" said Dusty.  He left to give the Snyders some privacy, and Janet told Jack that she would be eternally grateful for the gift he had given to her and Liberty.  She also said she knew Jack loved Carly, and she was willing to continue their plans to end their marriage.\n\n\nSage arrived home from school and saw Jack's sweater on a chair.  She teased Carly that she knew her dad had been there to see her mother, and she asked if her parents were back together.  Carly grinned and said, \"Yes,\" and Sage shrieked with joy and hugged her.  She asked when her dad was moving back with them, but Carly said it was \"complicated.\"  Sage kept badgering her for answers and remarked that it sounded simple enough to her.  Jack walked in, and Sage overwhelmed him with excitement about her parents' reunion and the fact that they were going to be a family again.  Sage ran to post the good news on her profile page, but Jack was leery.\n\n\nJack reminded Carly that he was still married, but Carly told him that Sage had asked if he and Janet were getting a divorce.  Jack could not believe what was happening with the baby, but he swore to Carly that he would always return to her.\n\n\nDusty sat on a bench in Old Town, and Teri walked by.  She joined him and asked why he wasn't with Janet, and Dusty said her sister was with Jack.  He said Janet was pregnant, and Teri felt sorry for him until Dusty mentioned the possibility that the baby might be his.  Teri thought that was unlikely, but the more Dusty talked about it, the more he thought they needed to definitely determine the baby's paternity.  Dusty got up and left, and drove to the farm.\n\n\nJanet was surprised to see Dusty, bearing flowers, at the door, and she asked him to stop pushing her.  Dusty suggested that Janet might have been pregnant the previous two months, and he asked if it would be bad if it were true.  Janet said she needed the baby to be Jack's, but Dusty repeated how much he loved her.  He said they needed to find out about the baby for sure.\n\n\n",
