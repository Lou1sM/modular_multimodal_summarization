Raphael and Celia go to meet with Sierra. She informs them that Celia will be allowed to stay in Oakdale. Sierra offers Celia her credit card, Raphael refuses it and says she doesn't need it. At the airport, James tells Barbara that there is no reason for her to go to Paris, it was simply a way for Craig to get her out of town and out of Jennifer's way. She tells him to quit lying, but then wonders if he's right. She rushes to BRO headquarters to find out everyone is at the Metro, for a press conference that she knew nothing about. Jennifer tells Mike that it isn't necessary for him to be at Metro, Henry needs him more. Mike senses something is wrong, but doesn't know what it could be. Henry explains to Katie that he must go \"to see his family\", without her, because they are upset about not being invited to the wedding. She understands and tells him that she will miss him. Mike drives Henry to the airport. Henry insists that Mike keep a close eye on Katie, since she doesn't like to be alone.
