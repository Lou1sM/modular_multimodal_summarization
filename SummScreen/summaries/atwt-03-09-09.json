    "soap_central": "\n\nLiberty awoke and went  into the living room to find Katie and Brad going over plans for a baby nursery. They explained their dreams for parenthood, using Vienna as a surrogate. Liberty was happy for them when Janet arrived, still furious for her daughter's recent actions with Parker. First she chewed out Liberty for not being in school, until the girl explained there were no classes because of teachers' conferences. Liberty also told her mother about Brad and Katie's baby plans, and Janet was pleased, but she cautioned them that first they ought to take better care of the child they had. Then she told them that Liberty had skipped school, slept with a boy, and almost burned down a house the day before. \n\n\nBrad put on his coat and threatened to teach Parker a lesson, once and for all, but the women stopped him. Janet announced that Jack had come up with a solution, however; Parker was going away to boarding school. Liberty begged her mother to intervene, but Janet was sure separation was the perfect solution. She reminded Liberty how she had thrown away her own life to \"sleep with a jerk,\" but Liberty screamed that she was not her mother and stormed out. Brad didn't like the \"jerk\" remark, either. \n\n\nCarly went into her kitchen and found her vodka label drawings. She flashed back to the day before and having sex with Craig in a hotel in Chicago. Jack, who was standing in her kitchen to survey the fire damage, returned her to reality. He said he was going to help Parker get ready because he had arranged to send him to East Lake Academy, the same boarding school J.J. attended. Parker's classes would start the next Monday, so the boy had to get organized. Carly objected on all counts, but she particularly did not understand how they could pay for two boys at an expensive school. Jack, unaware that Parker was eavesdropping, said they could use the trust fund that Rosanna had left for Parker's education. Carly still protested, but Jack said Parker was bound for East Lake, and that was that. \n\n\nParker walked in and declared he was not going anywhere. He admitted to one small mistake, but Jack told him almost burning down Carly's house was not small. Parker also objected to using his own trust money on something he didn't want to do. Carly explained that it was not Parker's money until he turned age 21, and until then, she and Jack could make the decisions. Parker said he would hate the school almost as much as he hated them, and he stomped out. Jack called East Lake and arranged for Parker to room with J.J. Carly pleaded with him to reconsider, but Jack said he could think of no other solution. Carly lashed out and accused Janet of being behind the sudden \"solution,\" because she could not handle her own kid. \n\n\nCraig talked with Johnny about the portrait he had drawn of \"Daddy.\" Johnny was non-communicative about the drawing, and that aroused Craig's suspicions. He suggested that perhaps the man in the drawing was Johnny's \"other Daddy,\" and Johnny agreed. He also admitted he had already shown it to Dusty. Craig realized what had happened while Lucy was watching her brother, so he called her at work and set her up. He asked her to sit with Johnny again that day, and Lucy said she had finished her shift and could come right away. Craig angrily crumpled the drawing of the \"other Daddy.\" \n\n\nMeanwhile, Dusty remembered his conversation with Johnny the day before. Johnny loved art projects, and Dusty was thrilled when Lucy called and they made arrangements for Dusty to visit again. Lucy decided it would be prudent to meet in Dusty's room instead of Craig's, so they could avoid close calls as had happened the last time. \n\n\nDusty arrived at his room with a sketching toy that used no paper. When he shook the sketcher, the drawing disappeared, and Dusty liked the \"no evidence\" feature. He opened the door for room service, which was delivering milk and cookies, but he was not prepared to see Craig walk in as the waiter was leaving. Craig brought a nanny, who quickly took Johnny outside, so Craig could talk to Lucy and Dusty. \n\n\nHe immediately lit into Lucy and accused her of returning to Oakdale not to revive her medical career but to help Dusty get Johnny away from him. He was so angry that he threatened to make sure neither of them ever laid eyes on the boy again. Lucy took all the blame, but Craig maintained that the day he shared his son with Dusty Donovan was the day that hell froze over. He also accused Dusty of using Lucy, and he dismissed her and said he no longer had a daughter. \n\n\nParker hung out on a bench in Old Town, and one of his friends approached. Parker told him that he had lost his Ft. Lauderdale trip because his dad had gone postal. The friend was off to spring break and offered Parker the use of his car while he was gone. Parker took the keys and wandered around Old Town until he ran into Liberty. She was upset that he was going to boarding school; however, Parker assured her that he was not going. He said he was going to leave town before that, and Liberty was going with him. Liberty asked if Parker meant a little road trip, but the teen hinted it was more of a trip from which they would not return. \n\n\nParker said he loved Liberty and asked how she felt about him. Liberty said of course she loved him, and that thrilled Parker. He said he had \"tons of money,\" but Liberty reminded him that they had tried to tap the trust fund on another occasion, and they had not been successful. He said he would figure out a way to get the money and suggested they each go home and get what they needed and meet in the school parking lot where the car was parked. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Jack complained that Carly was not home enough to properly supervise their children. Carly said she refused to be bullied, but Jack was afraid they would lose Parker if they allowed him to stay around Liberty. Jack left for work, where Janet joined him. She tried to comfort him, but her husband was feeling low. Janet reinforced that he and Carly were doing exactly the right thing, and some day, Parker might actually thank them. \n\n\nLiberty went home and apologized to her father. She also lied to Brad and said she wanted to hang out with girlfriends for a while, and she was going to the mall with some of them. She asked Brad for some cash, and he forked over some bills, but Liberty said it was not enough for new boots, so Brad gave her more. She walked to the door but turned and returned, told her dad he was a great guy, and gave him a hug. \n\n\nCarly cleaned her kitchen and remembered a bottle of vodka in her cupboard. She got it, but then she heard Parker come in, so she put away the liquor. Carly greeted Parker in the living room, and he asked if she and Jack had changed their minds about boarding school. Carly said no, and then to her surprise, Parker said he would give the school a try. Carly hugged her boy and offered to throw him a going away party that evening. She went into the kitchen to thaw some steaks for the celebration, and Parker went into his mother's wallet and took all her cash. Craig rang the doorbell, so Parker let him in and went to his room. Craig joined Carly in the kitchen, and she informed him that Parker was starting classes at East Lake soon. \n\n\nKatie returned home, and Brad told her that Liberty had gone shoe shopping. They lay on the couch and began to kiss, but suddenly Brad jumped up, saying, \"I can't!\" He told Katie that he was thinking of the \"inventory deposit\" he would be making very soon at the fertility doctor's office, and he thought he should abstain so he could \"give it everything he had\" then. Katie was hurt and said she felt like a third wheel, but Brad reassured her that he would only be thinking of her when he \"delivered the goods\" in the office. \n\n\nDusty apologized to Lucy. She was concerned that she couldn't keep up her end of the bargain and that he might reinstate the kidnapping charges against her. Dusty was not interested in that, however, and told her she would not be without Johnny for long. He felt he and Lucy had a bond with the boy that Craig could not break. He held Lucy to comfort her. \n\n\nParker told Carly he was going to shoot some hoops and promised that he would be home in time for dinner. Carly acknowledged that, and Parker left. She also told Craig that she agreed with Jack's harsh solution, and Craig commented that they both were losing a child that day. Carly defended Lucy's actions, as Craig piped up and accused her of listening to Jack too much. That irritated Carly, who asked Craig why he was there, and he said after his argument with Lucy, he just needed to talk to a friend. \"Good luck with finding one,\" was Carly's reply, as she ushered him to the door. He accused her of being afraid to be alone with him, but Carly said she was having a dinner party and he was not invited. Craig slammed the door, and Carly began to cry. She went to the cupboard and poured herself a glass of vodka and drank it. \n\n\nParker and Liberty met at the school parking lot, and she felt bad that she had not said goodbye to her mom. They acknowledged they had stolen their parents' money, and Parker decided to head to Los Angeles. Liberty questioned whether leaving was really the best answer, but Parker did a good job of convincing the girl that it was. As they were getting into the car, Johnny ran up and gave Parker a hug. The frazzled nanny ran up, warning Johnny not to run away from her. Parker said goodbye to the boy, who noticed that the license plate spelled out, \"BOO BOO,\" and he read it out loud.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cary is cleaning up her damaged kitchen, as she eyes a bottle of Vodka and is about to drink some when she is interrupted by Jack wanting to discuss how Parker can start school at the Academy on Monday. Brad and Katie tell Liberty about how they are going to try to have a baby with help from Vienna; at first, she is worried, but then she is happy for them. Their happiness is interrupted when Janet comes by wondering why Liberty hasn't told them about the events from the other day. Liberty tries to stop her, but Janet spills the beans and Brad is irate and wants to go teach Parker a lesson again. Janet informs them all that Jack is taking care of it because Parker is being sent to boarding school. Everyone is shocked and Liberty pleads with Janet to change Jack's mind. Janet thinks it is for the best because she is worried that Liberty is ruining her life. Liberty wants her to stop comparing them, as she races out in a huff. Parker overhears his parents talking about sending him to boarding school and doesn't react well at all, as he tells them how much he hates them before he races out. Carly and Jack worry about the ramifications of this decision. Parker is given his friend's car keys since he is going to Florida. Parker tells Liberty about what is going on and thinks that they need to leave town because that is the only way they can be together. Liberty isn't sure, but is convinced when Parker tells him that he loves her, as she admits she does too. They arrange to head out of town and meet up shortly. Carly, who is considering taking a drink of Vodka to calm her nerves, is interrupted when Parker comes home pretending that he is going to give the boarding school a try. Carly offers to give him a going away party, as Parker goes upstairs to pack unbeknownst to her \u0096 right after he steals money from her purse.

Liberty says her goodbye without Brad knowing. Parker slips out claiming he is going to play basketball, as Carly is busy cooking. Dusty thinks about his time he spent with Lucy and Johnny. Craig realizes that Johnny's drawn picture of \u0091daddy' is of Dusty. He then realizes that Dusty has been visiting when Lucy has been watching him, so he sets a trap by asking Lucy to baby-sit again that day. Lucy calls Dusty to invite him to spend time with them. Craig shows up as they are all hanging gout and reads them the riot act. Lucy tries to get him to understand, but Craig assures her that he will never allow her to betray him again; he also intends on never allowing her or Dusty near Johnny again; he tells her that he no longer has a daughter. Lucy seems distraught and worries about Dusty not being able to see Johnny anymore as well, as if he is going to send her to jail because of that. He tells her not to worry about that and as far as Johnny is concerned, they have a bond with him that Craig can't break and they will see him soon no matter what. Craig learns of Jack and Carly's decision and thinks it is a bad one and she is doing it to appease Jack. Carly kicks him out, as he jokes that she is afraid that what happened between them the other night might happen again. Later, Carly swallows down some Vodka. Katie wants to make love, but Brad wants to save himself to make his deposit at the lab; he also hopes Vienna is doing the same, as Katie starts to feel left out of this equation, but Brad reminds her that this was her decision and he is doing it to make her happy, as Katie looks slightly concerned. Janet assures Jack, who is still having misgivings about his decision, that he is definitely doing the right thing by both their kids. Parker and Liberty meet, as she wonders again if this is the right choice. Parker is sure of it, as they start to leave when Johnny sees them.
