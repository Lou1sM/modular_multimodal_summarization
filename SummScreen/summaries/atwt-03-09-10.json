    "soap_central": "\n\n \nJack held Carly and thanked her for being so understanding about Janet and the baby.  Carly assured him that she realized that they were \"part of the package deal.\"  Carly also said that they just needed to get back to being a family, which would include the new baby and Liberty.  Carly's only question was what Jack was going to do about Janet.  He said he was definitely returning to Carly and their kids, so Carly asked him to handle things with Janet.  Then she went upstairs to make a business call to her fabric suppliers.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Craig met with Ellis, his financial advisor, who advised Craig that \"borrowing\" from Parker's trust fund constituted grand larceny.  \"Only if we do it badly,\" quipped Craig, who also swore that Carly would never know what he had to do to make Monte Carlo \"a raging success.\"  Craig warned Ellis that Carly never needed to know that Parker was her anonymous investor, and neither did Parker.\n\n\nAt the farm, Dusty told Janet that he would be a good father, but she insisted that her baby was not his.  Janet offered to call her doctor and schedule a sonogram to settle the question once and for all.  She went upstairs to finish packing her parcel for Liberty, and Dusty prepared to leave.  Janet's cell phone was on the counter, and it rang, as Dusty headed for the door.  He saw that the caller was Jack, so he answered.  Dusty said there were some \"questions\" about Janet's baby, and he told Jack that he thought that he was the baby's father.  Dusty also said that Janet was having an ultrasound, which would tell the truth.  Jack asked to speak to his wife, but Dusty said she had \"stepped out,\" and he hung up.\n\n\nWhen Carly returned downstairs, she was excited about how well things were going for Monte Carlo.   The fabric wholesaler had met her price, so she was delighted.  Jack told her that Dusty had just told him about the possibility that Janet's baby was Dusty's, and Carly was not unhappy about that.  She hugged Jack and said that she would never let him go again.  Carly urged Jack to go see Janet, and they kissed.  Jack walked out to head to the farm, and Craig showed up at Carly's door soon afterward.\n\n\nCraig announced that he had a \"surprise\" for Carly, and he was carrying a garment bag.  He took some sample dresses that he had instructed a tailor to make with the fabric Carly had chosen, and Carly was stunned and excited to think of beginning a local campaign.  Then she decided that a national campaign would reap even greater profits, so she asked what Craig thought about that.  He said that would take a lot more capital, but Carly said they would just get more from their investor, Maurice.  She was positive she wanted to take the bigger risk for the larger reward, and she ran upstairs to get her sketchbook to show Craig some new designs.\n\n\nCraig followed Carly upstairs to her bedroom and looked at her mussed-up bed.  Carly made an excuse for not making her bed that morning, but Craig asked if Jack had been there.  Carly admitted that he had, but she said he had left earlier.  Craig asked if she and Jack were back together, but Carly said that she didn't really know.  Craig questioned that, so Carly told him that Janet was pregnant, but the baby might actually be Dusty's.  Then Carly asked Craig to go to Maurice for the additional money, and he reluctantly agreed.  He also warned her that she needed to spend a lot more time on the business and not let her personal life get in the way.  Carly promised all that.\n\n\nJanet returned downstairs to Emma's kitchen, but Dusty was gone.  She called Liberty, but Parker answered and said that Liberty was having a rough day and was asleep. Janet sat at the table and cried, as Jack let himself in.  Janet said she was just upset that she wasn't with her daughter, but Jack consoled her.  Then he told her that Dusty had told him that there was a strong possibility that Janet's baby was Dusty's, but Janet said no.  She was a bit frantic at that thought, but she did admit that she was two months late with her period.  She cried that she might have ruined everything, but Jack hugged her.  Then Janet said she had to get to work at Metro, and she promised Jack that she would arrange for a sonogram and let him know the results.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Dusty played with Johnny, who said he wished he had a yard with a swing set in it instead of living in a hotel.  He suggested that Dusty buy a house with a yard and then build him a tree fort.  Dusty said that the boy had just given him a great idea, and when his time with Johnny was over, Dusty took off for Metro.  He walked in, grabbed Janet by the hand, and rushed her out.\n\n\nDusty drove Janet to a neighborhood, and to a specific red brick house with a \"For Sale\" sign on the front lawn.  He told Janet that it could be their home together. Janet was speechless as Dusty pointed out which room would be their nursery and which was Liberty's.  Janet smiled and declared that it was a beautiful house, but she said she could not give him an answer because everything was so unsettled.  Dusty gave her his engagement ring, still in the box, and said that after the sonogram and after Janet was convinced that he was the father of her baby, she could reconsider his proposal.  Dusty said he would wait as long as it took, and they kissed.\n\n\nCraig and Carly went to Al's and continued their business discussion.  Carly asked for a huge launch party for her new designs, if they could afford it.  Craig was happy to see Carly so excited again, and she declared him \"a good guy.\"  Jack walked in the diner, but after Craig shot some barbs at him, he turned around to go back out.  Carly ran after him and asked Craig to go call their investor and wheedle some more bucks from him while she talked with Jack.\n\n\nCraig was hesitant, but he left the diner, and Carly expected Jack to lecture her on doing business with the likes of Craig.  Jack, however, said that he was in no position to tell Carly with whom she could do business.  The two walked around Old Town and talked about how they had found their way back to one another.  They settled on a bench and then talked about Janet's baby.  Jack said an ultrasound would definitely tell them how far along Janet was, and Carly was very accepting.  Jack said he loved her very much, and he was so glad they had each other forever.\n\n\nIn the house in Forest Hills, Lily blamed Damian for frightening Faith and using her daughter, but Damian claimed that he had to do whatever it took so that he and Lily could be together.  Lily said that he had gotten a second chance with her and Luke, but while she acknowledged that Damian had acted out of love, things had gone terribly wrong, and people had gotten hurt.  Lilly begged Damian to make things right by turning himself in to the police.\n\n\nIn Molly's car, Holden argued about how they should track down Damian.  Molly suggested that he call Jack, but Holden said that Jack had done enough trying to help his family.  He said he really only trusted Molly, but then he called a text tracking system he had on Faith's phone and learned the address of the house in Forest Hills.  Molly agreed to drive Holden there if he would promise to call the police once they had determined that Damian was there.\n\n\nIn Lily's car, Faith waited, as it began to snow.  Finally, she got out and ran to the front door.  Inside, Lily reminded Damian that she had believed in him and married him twice, but just then they both heard someone at the front door.  Damian jerked the door open and snatched Faith roughly and pulled her inside.  The girl called him \"a creep,\" and she ran to her mother.  Damian talked disparagingly about Holden, as Lily tried to sweet-talk him.  She asked Damian to let Faith go, and in return, she promised to go with him to talk.  Damian pulled a rope from his pocket, and he told Faith that she had given him no choice.\n\n\nMolly and Holden pulled up in front of the house, and Holden recognized Lily's car.  He got out, telling Molly to stay in the car, and he ran around the side of the house.  Holden spotted Faith through the back door, and she was bound to a chair and gagged.  Damian dragged Lily up behind Holden and smacked him hard on the head with a large piece of firewood.  Holden collapsed, as Damian pulled a protesting Lily away.\n\n\nIn the car, Molly called the cops and watched the house.  When she couldn't stand it any longer, she left the car and got into the house, where she found Faith and freed her.  Molly got very worried when Faith said that she hadn't see Holden, and Molly ran out the back door, screaming for him.  She found Holden unconscious on the ground, but he opened his eyes and called out for Lily.  Molly identified herself, as Faith asked if her father was all right.  Holden wondered where Damian had taken Lily, but Faith said he had mentioned something about \"sailing away\" because Lily could not flee if they were at sea.  Molly told the girl to keep Holden awake and alert, and she took off.  Holden eventually was able to stand with Faith's help, but his daughter was sobbing that Damian might have already hurt Lily.\n\n\nDamian dragged Lily to the engine room of a large boat, and Lily said that she would never abandon Holden.  They argued, but Lily said she would never be happy living without her children.  Damian prattled on about how the two of them could live an idyllic life until death parted them, but Lily shrank away and demanded that Damian never touch her again.    Damian assured Lily that he loved her, but Lily said it was not love but an obsession.\n\n\nLily yelled that she had lied about caring for him, and letting Damian back into her life had been a terrible mistake.  Damian was crushed, but then he got angry.  He gritted his teeth as Lily spewed out how much she hated him.  He claimed that a few months a sea alone with him would change her attitude, or else it would mean her death.  Damian dragged Lily towards the door just as Molly flung it open and said, \"Hope I'm not interrupting.\"\n\n\n",
