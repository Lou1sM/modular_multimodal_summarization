Janet called Liberty to tell her about the invitation, but the girl did not answer her phone. Janet left a message, but she was uneasy that she had not actually talked to her daughter. Jack was relieved that Carly had mentioned that Parker appeared to be resigned to going to boarding school. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker were at a mall outside Chicago when Janet's call arrived. Parker told Liberty not to answer, for fear that \"Jack the Cop\" would be able to track them. They got ice cream, but Parker was eager to get on the road. He felt that Liberty was stalling, but she said she was only trying to make him happy by having fun. \n\n\nLucy appeared at Carly's and asked for Carly's intervention with Craig in their family disagreement about her seeing Johnny. She said she needed to make peace with her father. Carly told the girl she had told Craig to stay out of her personal business, so she could hardly interfere in his. Janet and Jack arrived, so Lucy made a hasty exit. Janet said she had expected Liberty to be there already, and Carly mentioned that Parker was not at home yet, either. Sage came home from her ballet lesson and reminded her mother that she needed money for a class trip the next day. Carly went to her wallet, which was empty of money. She said she knew she had a hundred dollars in it earlier that day, but it was missing. \n\n\nJack gave Sage the cash, and Carly decided she was losing her mind. She went into the kitchen and poured herself another glass of wine. As she puzzled over the missing money, Sage came down from her room and announced that she thought Parker was gone. Sage told the adults that Parker's room showed signs of a hasty departure, so Carly went to see for herself. Janet looked at Jack and asked if he was thinking what she was thinking, and she whipped out her phone. At the mall, Parker and Liberty were eating pizza when Janet called her daughter again. Liberty wanted to answer because she knew they could not keep dodging their parents' calls. Parker told her she worried too much, and they moved on. \n\n\nCarly told Jack and Janet that Sage was correct; there was evidence that Parker had taken off again. Jack said they should start calling kids from school, so Carly went to get the school list. Jack volunteered to take Janet to Katie and Brad's for another contact list, and Jack said he would also cruise around to see if he could find anything to lead them to the missing teens. He discouraged the women from speculating and talking about worst-case scenarios. Instead, he urged them to stay calm. \n\n\nLucy ran into Craig and Johnny outside Al's Diner, and Johnny gave her a big hug. The boy wanted his sister to join them, but Craig spoke for Lucy and told the boy she was busy, and he hustled Johnny inside. He never spoke to Lucy. Jack spied Craig and Johnny inside the diner and came in, followed by Lucy. He approached Craig and asked if Craig had any information about Parker and Liberty. Craig was surly, so Lucy stepped forward and took Johnny to the front of the diner to check out the desserts so the men could talk. Jack said if Craig had given Parker his car keys again, Jack would arrest him on the spot. Craig said he had no idea where the teens were, but he was not surprised that Parker had run away because all Jack had done was make the boy's life miserable. Jack told him to knock off the parenting advice, and he walked out. \n\n\nLucy talked with Johnny, and the boy said he had seen Parker in a car when he was on a walk with his nanny. He told his sister that the license plate on the car was funny and had said, \"BOO BOO.\" Lucy chose to keep the information to herself and told Johnny to keep that a secret and they could make it a game. Craig came to collect his boy and, again, he ignored Lucy. Lucy called someone and asked for help. \n\n\nCarly drank more wine and got morose. She decided not to sit at home and wait for Parker to return, so she grabbed her car keys and unsteadily headed for the door. She ran into Craig, who recognized her condition and told her she was in no condition to drive. She fought him, and Sage came down to see what the fuss was about. Craig asked the girl to go upstairs and watch television, and he promised to bring her some dinner. \n\n\nCraig tried to comfort Carly, and his cell phone rang. The call was from Lucy, who asked him not to hang up because she knew where Parker and Liberty were, and Craig could be a hero. She told him the teens were at the Shorebridge Mall outside Chicago. Craig tired to waken Carly, who had passed out, but he was unsuccessful, so he took off for Chicago. \n\n\nIn the park, Dusty told Meg he had always been into her because she was sexy and smart-and could rebuild a carburetor. She said that since she had ditched Paul, her life had been a train wreck. She wanted to be independent, but she hated to be alone. The two of them began walking back to the farm where Dusty held the baby and missed his Johnny. Meg told him he was welcome there any time, and she put her sleeping infant down and hugged Dusty. \n\n\nCraig drove to the mall where Lucy was waiting. They spotted Parker and Liberty, who likewise saw them and took off. Craig and Lucy gave chase, and they caught them when Liberty turned her ankle and fell. Lucy looked at the ankle and returned to her car for her medical bag. Craig lectured Parker about how tough life on the run was, and when Lucy returned, she added details about her life for the years she had been a fugitive with Johnny. Liberty's injury was only a sprain, so she needed no further treatment. Craig told the kids that he would not force them to go home and that they had to make their own decisions. \n\n\nJack went back to Carly's and awakened her. He asked if she was drunk, but she denied it. Jack had no news, but Sage volunteered that Craig had been there and upset Carly. Janet arrived, and she and Jack were getting ready to go to the police station when Parker, Liberty, and Craig walked in. Craig said he had found the kids outside Chicago, and Jack was suspicious that Craig had known where they were the whole time, but Parker set him straight. \n\n\nCarly was the only one who thanked Craig, and then she hugged him, as well. Janet took Liberty home, while Jack scolded Parker and told him how soon he was off to boarding school. Parker pled with Carly not to let Jack send him away, but his folks sent him to his room. Carly said she only wanted peace in her family, and she was fearful that Parker would only run away from wherever they sent him. Jack claimed their son needed discipline, and they would continue the discussion later. \n\n\nBack at the Lakview, Lucy was waiting for Craig's return. Craig told her he had talked the teens into returning home, and at least Carly had appreciated his efforts. He also said he knew Lucy had given him the information just to get back in his good graces. \n\n\nAt Brad and Katie's house, Janet asked her daughter what she was thinking to run away with Parker. Liberty answered that she was not her mother, and she would not make the same dumb mistakes her mother had made. She refused to discuss it further and ran for her room. Jack arrived, and Janet cried that her dream of a new house and one big happy family was crumbling. \n\n\nParker told Carly he knew she didn't really want to send him away to school, but she told him that as long as he was living in their home, he would have to follow the rules. As she cleaned the kitchen, she poured the remaining wine down the sink.\n\n\n",
