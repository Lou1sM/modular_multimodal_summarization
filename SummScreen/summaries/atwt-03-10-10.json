    "soap_central": "\n\n \nEmma visited Meg at Deerbrook and delivered Meg's favorite cookies.  She also showed her a recent photo of Eliza, who had \"helped\" Sage build a snowman.  Meg was grateful for the gifts, but she reminded her mom that nothing changed who and where she was.  Emma gave Meg a pep talk, but Meg said that she did not need reminders of everything she had lost.  Emma claimed that her daughter had not \"lost\" anything; all her family was still around and loved her.  Emma was sure Meg would get better, but Meg was very discouraged.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul played with Eliza, while Emily kibitzed.  He was showing the baby some of the applications on his cell phone when he received a local news bulletin.  Emily took the phone and read aloud that Holden Snyder had escaped from the Oakdale jail, and then she continued to read that there was new information that shipping magnate, Damian Grimaldi, might still be alive.  Paul stood up immediately and said he was taking Eliza to see her grandmother, Emma.  He wanted to make sure that Emma didn't share the news about Damian with Meg and spook her.  He kissed Emily goodbye and took off.\n\n\nEmma was delighted to see Eliza, and she fussed over her, as Paul asked when she had last seen Meg.  Emma answered that she had seen Meg earlier that day, and then Paul broke the news that Damian was probably still alive and perhaps back in Oakdale.  Paul expressed concern over Meg's well-being, but Emma thought that was ironic.  She said that Paul was just as responsible for what had happened to Meg as Damian was.  Paul said he was trying to make amends for being such a lousy husband to Meg, but Emma said that was hard to do when kidnapping was on your rap sheet.  Emma said that Paul was the last person Meg needed on her side, and she begged him to leave her daughter alone.\n\n\nBack home, Emily received a phone call from Meg, who asked to see her right away.  Emily complied and drove to visit Meg, who told her that she felt that she was making no progress at Deerbrook.  Meg said she worried all the time that Damian was still alive and just biding his time.  She reminded Emily how obsessed she had been with him, and she realized that she was nowhere close to being the mother that Eliza needed and deserved.  Meg asked Emily to \"step in\" for her and be Eliza's mother.  Emily was surprised, but Meg said she was the most logical choice.  Emily said she was honored, and she accepted.\n\n\nWhen Paul and Emily reunited at Fairwinds, they discussed Meg's situation.  Emily explained that Meg had asked her to look after Eliza, but Paul was not pleased.  He was confused as to why Meg had made that request of his wife, and he told Emily that it was all about how he had only shown Meg the worst parts of himself, and he could make up for that by being a very good father to Eliza.  They decided to take the baby to see her mother together and drove to Deerbrook.\n\n\nPaul asked for a moment alone with his ex-wife to get her ready to see her daughter.  He went inside and told Meg that he only wanted what was best for her.  He suggested that he get Eliza from the anteroom, but Meg refused to see her.  She was very upset that the baby was so close, and she insisted that she didn't want her daughter to see her fall apart.  Finally Meg shrieked, \"No!\" at Paul, and he asked her not to give up, and he walked out.\n\n\nAt the house in Forest Hills, Faith and Holden comforted one another, and Holden told his daughter to stay there with her cell phone on to wait for the police.  He was determined to rescue Lily, so he ran off.  Faith was nervous, and she swallowed another pill from her hidden stash.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, the police showed up with a search warrant for Holden.  Luke let the officer in and told him that Holden was already locked up in the Oakdale jail.  The cop informed Luke that Holden had escaped, so Luke immediately drove to the station.  He found Faith there, courtesy of the Oakdale PD, and he noticed that she appeared sluggish and slow in her responses.  Luke demanded to know everything from the beginning, but Faith began to cry and said it was all her fault.  She continued to tell Luke all the lies that Damian had fed her and how frightened she had been.  No one knew where Lily and Damian or Molly and Holden were.\n\n\nFaith was lethargic, so Luke looked at her closely and asked if she was okay.  He also noted how cold her skin was, and he pressed her to tell him what was going on.  Luke took his sister into the interrogation room for privacy, and he asked if Damian had given her \"something.\"  Faith acted insulted, but Luke said she was acting as if she had taken a drug.  He asked to examine her purse, but Faith refused.  Luke said he knew she was high, and he cajoled her into telling him the truth.  Faith cried that Damian had made her lie to their mom and dad and had forced her into tricking Lily into the meeting in Forest Hills.\n\n\nFaith finally admitted that she had taken \"a couple of pills to calm down,\" but Luke insisted on seeing them.  Faith handed over the bottle and asked if he was satisfied.  When Luke asked where Faith had gotten the meds, she answered that her roommate had given them to her when she had sprained her ankle in basketball.  Luke warned the girl that those pills were very addictive, but Faith steered her brother back to the subject of finding her mom and dad.\n\n\nIn the engine room of a boat, Molly interrupted Damian and Lily, and she assured an anxious Lily that Holden and Faith were all right.  She took a photo of the two of them with her cell phone and told Damian that all she had to do was push the \"send\" button, and the rest of the world would know that he was still alive.  Damian threatened Molly, but she reminded him that she was holding his future in her hands.  Lily argued with Molly, and a look passed between them.  The two women got into a shouting and shoving match, and Damian was forced to separate them.  He stood between them, facing Lily, and Molly was able to surprise Damian and throw him down on some heavy machinery.\n\n\n Lily grabbed a rope to tie him up, but Damian rose to his feet and grabbed her.  He told her she wasn't thinking clearly, but Lily called him a \"monster.\"  She refused to go anywhere with him, but Damian promised he would do things \"the hard way,\" if necessary.  He pulled a gun and pointed it at Molly, while also grabbing Lily and pulling her close to him.  Molly pretended that Holden was close by and screamed for him, but Damian refused to be fooled.  Damian made a move to the exit, but suddenly Holden threw open the door from the outside.\n\n\nHolden demanded that Damian release Lily because there was no way out.  The two women ran to Holden, as Damian trained his gun on all three of them. Damian ordered Molly to move, and he pushed her into a closet and shut the door.  He turned to Holden and said he had been waiting a long time for such a moment.  Holden begged Damian to let Lily go, but Damian said she had to go with him because it was time for a \"new beginning.\"  He tried to persuade Lily to walk quietly with him to the door and declared that he would do \"anything\" to hold on to her.  Lily spoke to Damian about Luke, but nothing would dissuade him.\n\n\nFinally Lily promised to go quietly with Damian if he would let Holden and Molly live.  When Damian refused, Lily said then he would have to kill her, too.  Holden began talking about his love for Lily, but his words saddened Molly, who was listening from the closet.  Molly suddenly surged out of the closet and distracted Damian just long enough for Holden to jump him.  The two men struggled for control of the gun, and it fired once.  Damian then punched Holden, who went down, but Molly picked up a substantial piece of pipe and bashed Damian over the head.  Damian dropped the gun when he fell, and Lily grabbed it.\n\n\nDamian got to his feet and found Lily pointing the gun at him.  He continued to work on her to go with him, but her answer was, \"Not a chance.\"  Holden stepped up and took the revolver from Lily and told Damian to give him \"one good reason to pull the trigger.\"  The police arrived and took the gun from Holden, while Lily explained that it was Damian they needed to confine.  The cops cuffed Damian and dragged him out, as Holden grabbed Lily and hugged her.  An officer then put cuffs on Holden, who told Lily to find Faith and to meet him at the police station.\n\n\nMolly had slipped out the door in the confusion with the police, but she returned.  She called herself a \"glutton for punishment.\"  Holden thanked her for playing superhero, but he also scolded her for putting herself in danger.  Molly asked Holden how \"exactly\" he was planning on moving on with his life, so Holden pulled her close, but Molly stopped him.  She wanted to know where they stood, so Holden said that he and Lily had built a life, but even before Damian was back in the picture, what he and Lily had was \"broken.\"  Damian's arrest changed none of that, and Holden kissed Molly before the officer took him away.\n\n\nAs Luke and Faith were exiting the interrogation room, an officer was leading Damian into the station.  Luke just stared at his father, and then Lily ran in and hugged Faith.  She commented on how cold the girl was, but Faith said she was just stressed.  Lily asked how long Damian had been texting her as \"Max,\" and Faith told her it had not been long.  She also told her mother to face the fact that Lily was the one who had let Damian back into their lives.  Lily said that she knew that, as Luke walked out.  Faith slipped herself another pill, but Luke saw her.  The officer led Damian by again on his way to the interrogation room, and Lily slipped off her wedding ring and handed it to Damian.\n\n\nLuke went in to see Damian, and he asked how his father could have done what he did.  Damian tried to say that everything he had done had been to protect Luke and the family, and especially the family name.  \"To hell with the Grimaldi name!\" cried Luke, but Damian reminded him that the Grimaldi empire was Luke's legacy.  Luke said he wanted nothing to do with Damian and declared that Holden Snyder was his father.  He renounced Damian and all that he stood for.\n\n\n",
