Katie went in with blanket and started to make small talk. Pilar mentioned that Mike had given her the flowers and asked Katie to get her some water for them. Katie came back in with the flowers and brought up Mike's name. Katie told her that Mike was a great guy and that he would do everything he could to make sure Pilar was okay.  Pilar sensed that there was something between Katie and Mike but Mike walked in before she had a chance to say anymore. Mike was curious about what Katie had said and asked her to go get Pilar some water. Pilar asked Mike what his relationship with Katie was. Mike changed the subject but it was quickly changed back to Katie again. Mike finally told Pilar that there was something between him and Katie. Pilar said she could see the hurt in his eyes when he looked at Katie. Katie couldn't go back in to the room and left to find Henry. She asked Henry to check into the Mike-Pilar relationship. Henry gave Katie a bad time and told her she was jealous. They bantered back and forth until Henry agreed to her request.\n\n\nCasey got Sarah some money for her trip to Atlanta. Before she left she wanted to eat something. Margo and Jessica were having coffee at Al's and Margo asked the waitress if she had seen Sarah. She said she had seen Sarah and Casey sneak out of Al's earlier.  Margo placed a call to Casey and asked him to get to Al's. Margo interrogated Casey and he came clean about seeing Sarah but he wouldn't tell them where she was or what she was up to. Margo wasn't buying his story and warned him that he better think about what he was hiding. Meanwhile over at Margo's Sarah was looking at some pictures when Lisa came in. Sarah dropped the box of pictures and hid but Lisa found it and started calling out. Casey walked in and covered Sarah's tracks. Lisa accepted his story and left. Casey told Sarah what had transpired at Al's and Sarah started crying. Casey told Sarah that he thought Jessica really cared about her but Sarah told him not to buy it. Over at Al's, Jessica was clearly worried about Sarah. \n\n\nPaul was taking Lucy to her college interview but he asked Carly to go with them so they could get some work done. Carly noticed that Lucy didn't look too happy about Carly joining them.  They arrived for Lucy's interview and Lucy was a little nervous. Paul made her laugh and then kissed her cheek for good luck. Carly gave an exasperated look and said under her breath that Paul was clueless. While Lucy was in her interview Carly showed her sketches to Paul and he was very impressed. Lucy came out and as they were about to leave, Carly noticed that it was snowing very hard and they weren't going anywhere.\n\n\nJack arrived at Craig's to tell him that he was suspicious about Rosanna and the telegram she sent to Paul. Jack thinks that Rosanna has been kidnapped because of what she wrote in the telegram and that a large amount of money was withdrawn from her bank account. Craig was jumping to all kinds of conclusions and wanted to hop on the first airplane to St. Bart's (where the telegram came from). Jack told him to go slow and that they needed to take one step at a time. Later, Jack received a picture of a man that he thought might be involved in Rosanna's disappearance and called Craig. After Craig left, a man fitting the description of the man in Jack's photo stepped into Craig's living room. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Casey gives in, but only tells part of what he knows. Craig is questioned about his wife's disappearance. Katie admits that she knows a local contractor better than she had been letting on. Lucy is not happy when she learns that she will not have her pilot all to herself. Margo orders her son to the diner for an inquisitive little chat. Paul sees nothing different in the way that a girl acts around him. Rosanna wasn't the one that sent the note. Sarah was spotted running out of Al's with a friend. Carly spots a teen crush. Pilar brushes off a nosey, pushy nurse.",
