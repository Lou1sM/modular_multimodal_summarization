Meanwhile, Katie spots an agitated Mike at the Lakeview, claiming Jennifer didn't come home last night. Katie acts as a friend and tells Mike she thinks everything will work out. Across the lounge, Henry, who is now secretly staying at the Lakeview, watches in disguise as Mike has the loving and tender moment he knows he could never have with Katie. Mike and Katie talk about the kiss they almost shared and Mike confides in Katie about how Jennifer turned down his marriage proposal. Katie is comforting and innocently suggests Mike question Craig about Jennifer's whereabouts. Later, when Mike shows up at Craig's, Jennifer hides in the bathroom while Craig plays a guilt trip on Mike for not attending the Street Jeans party. Mike goes and Jennifer is even more embarrassed at her behavior. She splits, half dressed and disheveled as she unknowingly crosses paths with a disguised Henry, who puts two and two together. He marches to Craig's door and when Craig answers, Henry socks him one. Later, a guilty Jennifer arrives in the lounge and comes face-to-face with Mike and Katie. \n\n\nHaving retrieved the partially burned gloves from the alley, Luke tries to finish the job by burning them again but is caught by Lucinda. Luke lies and says he was burning a school paper but Lucinda doesn't buy it. Meanwhile, Lily tells Carly she wants to expose Julia's illegal El Paso past to the authorities in order to taint Holden's perception of her.

Just then, Lucinda arrives to tell Lily that she caught Luke skipping school and burning something in her fireplace. Meanwhile, at the police station, Tom tells Jack that they need physical evidence in order to prosecute Keith. Keith demands his release and tells Jack and Holden to look to the real culprits, their wives. Later, a cop shows up at the police station with Luke, claming he had been lingering around Julia's apartment. Holden tries to talk to Luke about skipping school and hanging around Julia's, but Luke gets defensive and takes off. Just then, another cop appears with news of a print found on Julia's watch band and Jack and Holden set off, hoping the print will lead them to the killer. Meanwhile, Luke returns home and is forced to face Lucinda. He secretly lets Lily know that this inquisition is about the gloves and Lily covers for him. Later, after Lucinda leaves, Luke tells a nervous Lily and Carly that the cops found a print. Meanwhile, Jack gets the results from the print and it shows that the print doesn't belong to Keith. While Keith demands his release, a concerned Holden starts to suspect Luke may have more to do with Julia's death than he's letting on. \n\n\n\n\n",
