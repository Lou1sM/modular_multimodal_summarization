When Paul tried to plead Sofie's case, Will accused him of wanting Will to lose a baby, the way that Paul did. Paul told Will he'd crossed a line with that comment and told him to get out of his house. Will said he wouldn't forget what Paul had done, and he warned Paul that he'd be hearing from Will's lawyer. \n\n\nAfter Will left, Sofie told Paul that this wasn't what she wanted for herself and the baby. Paul tried to convince her to stay, but Sofie said she couldn't, and she left and took Hallie back to the Lakeview. \n\n\nWill returned home, where he told Barbara and Gwen about Paul's invitation to Sofie to live at Fairwinds. Gwen thought they should be happy to hear that, because it meant Sofie would have a safe place to stay with Hallie, but Will was furious, as was Barbara. Will told Gwen that one day, she would wake up and realize the huge mistake she'd made by giving Hallie back to Sofie, but by then, it might be too late, especially if Paul became involved, because he had the financial resources to help Sofie stake a legal claim to Hallie. \n\n\nBarbara left and went to see Meg at the farm. She told Meg what Paul was doing, and she asked Meg to use her influence with Paul to make him see that he should stay out of this situation before it ruined his relationship with his brother. Barbara said that Will was about the only family Paul had left, and when Meg pointed out that Paul still had Barbara, Barbara simply said, \"Brothers need each other.\" She then begged Meg to talk to Paul for Hallie's sake. \n\n\nMeg went to visit Paul at Fairwinds. She told him Barbara had asked her to come and talk to him, and she asked Paul to reconsider having Sofie stay with him. Paul informed Meg that Sofie had decided to leave. Paul then asked why Meg had really come in the first place, and Meg admitted she still cared about what happened to Paul. Paul was happy to hear that and wondered where they could go from there, but Meg pointed out that he'd just gone from trying to get Sofie to move in with him to trying to win Meg back. Meg wondered whether Paul was really that desperate not to be alone. Paul said, \"I'm terrified ... of being without you.\" \n\n\nPaul told Meg that Sofie and her baby made him think of the son he and Meg had lost. He felt that helping Sofie might help him heal from the pain of losing his own baby. Meg said nothing could heal that pain, and then she told Paul she had to leave. Paul asked if he could call her, but Meg said that wasn't a good idea. Paul then asked if they could be friends, but Meg said, \"Friends don't hurt each other.\" Paul said, \"Okay. Wanna be friends?\" Meg smiled slightly but walked out anyway. \n\n\nWill told Gwen she had no right to make the decision to return Hallie to Sofie without talking to him about it first. Gwen said she felt like she had no choice, because she could see how much Sofie regretted having given up her baby. Barbara returned and said she had asked Meg to talk to Paul. Suddenly, Barbara almost fainted and fell into Will's arms. Will and Gwen were concerned, but Barbara said it was just the stress of everyone fighting. Barbara told them that although the baby was important, the most important thing was Will and Gwen's marriage. As she left to go home and rest, Barbara reminded them, \"Life is short, and love is precious. Don't waste it.\" \n\n\nGwen told Will she wasn't sure how she would get through losing Hallie if Sofie decided to keep her, but she knew she wouldn't be able to get through it without Will. Will said he might never be able to agree with what Gwen had done, but Gwen was still the most important person in the world to him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Bob stopped Chris from going to see a patient and told Chris he seemed to be \"under the influence.\" Chris denied it but continued to act as though he were inebriated. Bob told Chris he was suspended indefinitely and told him to go home. Chris had a quick flash of memory of Emily bumping into his table at the Lakeview and realized that perhaps Emily had somehow drugged him. \n\n\nEmily had one of her employees do some quick research on Gray Girard for Alison. Among other things, they learned that Gray was originally from the south side of Chicago and that his name was actually Jerry Polaski. Gray had made many lucrative investments, mostly in real estate, and had remade his image completely. Emily didn't see anything in the file to suggest that Gray was involved in anything illegal. Alison thanked Emily for the information and left. \n\n\nChris went to see Emily and accused her of having drugged his coffee at lunch. He told Emily he'd been suspended from his job and could have killed a patient. Emily was horrified to hear that and told Chris she had thought he would be going back upstairs to his room after his lunch; she said she only meant it to be a prank and never would have done it if she'd known he had to work afterwards. Chris accused her of having done it on Paul's behalf, but Emily said it had been a spur-of-the-moment idea and had nothing to do with Paul. Chris didn't believe her and said, \"I guess being a prostitute wasn't low enough for you. God help you if you're doing Paul Ryan's dirty work for him.\" \n\n\nChris left Emily's office and went to Fairwinds to see Paul. There, he accused Paul of having engineered Emily's \"prank.\" Paul said he had nothing to do with it, but he was happy to hear that Emily had managed to cause Chris some pain, given the pain that Chris had caused Emily. Chris then warned Paul not to get involved with Sofie, and Paul told Chris that if Sofie came to see him, it was her own choice to do so. He wondered if that made Chris angry, and Chris responded by saying he couldn't believe that he had recently literally held Paul's life in his hands. He warned Paul to watch his back, and Paul asked, \"Does this mean I should get a new doctor?\" Chris stormed out. \n\n\nBrad joined Katie on the set of WOAK in time to co-host a segment on how to win back the one you've loved and lost. After the segment was over, Brad told Katie he had helped Henry do just that: win back Vienna. Katie didn't believe him, but Brad said he had convinced Henry to beg Vienna to take him back. Brad was confident that Vienna and Henry were at the Lakeview celebrating their reunion, and he told Katie they should head over there and have a drink with them. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Vienna waited alone at the bar for Henry to arrive. Unbeknownst to her, Matt had kidnapped Henry and taken him, bound and gagged, to a warehouse for the Chicago Loop Scenic Shop. There, Matt told the business manager that since Gray owned the company, he would have to let Matt lock Henry up in one of the rooms in the warehouse until Gray decided it was time to let Henry go. \n\n\nHenry awoke and found himself handcuffed to a pole in the warehouse. Across the room from him, he saw the dummy, Cowboy Jack. Henry began talking to himself and Cowboy Jack about the predicament in which he found himself, saying it obviously meant Gray was worried that Vienna would have reunited with Henry. Henry took that as a positive sign that Vienna still loved him. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, a waiter brought Vienna a note. The note, which was typed, purported to be from Henry and claimed he didn't deserve Vienna and had gone to visit his family and lick his wounds. After Vienna read the note, Gray approached her and asked where Henry was. She told Gray that Henry had dumped her, and Gray said Henry was a coward and didn't deserve her. \n\n\nBrad and Katie arrived at the Lakeview bar and saw Gray talking to Vienna. Brad asked Vienna why she wasn't with Henry, and Vienna showed him the note from Henry. Katie glanced at it and told Brad she didn't think Henry wrote the note, because Henry always hand-wrote his notes instead of typing them, and he would have used his own stationery; in addition, Henry hated his family and wouldn't have gone to visit them. Behind the bar, Matt, who was working, listened to Brad and Katie's conversation. Brad suggested to Katie that they check out Henry's room upstairs. \n\n\nBrad and Katie found that Henry hadn't taken any of his clothing or whiskey from Katie's room. Brad also found a second typed note from Henry, but he showed Katie that in the note, \"heal\" had been spelled \"heel,\" and he said there was no way Henry would have made that mistake. Believing that Gray was behind Henry's disappearance, Brad and Katie decided to try to find Henry. Katie suddenly wondered whether this was some kind of scheme devised by Henry and Brad to get Brad and Katie alone somewhere together, but Brad assured her it wasn't. \n\n\nGray suggested that Vienna go upstairs to rest, saying he would bring her something to make her feel better. When she left, Matt told Gray that Brad and Katie were suspicious. Gray told him that in a couple of days, he himself would go get Henry and play the role of hero in bringing Henry back. As Gray walked to the elevator, he passed Alison, who called out, \"Good evening, Mr. Polaski.\" Gray didn't turn around until he got into the elevator; then, as the doors slid closed, he smiled at Alison. Upstairs, Gray gave Vienna a diamond bracelet and assured her that all would be well. \n\n\n",
