She was still a bit shaky after recovering from the drug Mark Viro had injected into her at the warehouse. The sisters felt closer than they had in a long time, and Emily spoke about Matt and how much he cared for Alison. Alison said Matt understood that she needed to see where things went with Casey before she could take Matt seriously, but Emily said she didn't want to see her sister hurt again. Alison thanked Emily, and they hugged. After Alison left, Emily called Jade and told her to \"get her butt\" to her office. \n\n\nAt Yo's, Casey approached Matt, who was bartending, and he tried to apologize again. Matt declared it was easy for Casey to have jumped to conclusions about Matt's being a drug dealer, because Casey wanted Matt out of the picture so Casey could have Alison all to himself. Matt assured Casey that Casey and Alison would never get back together. Matt thought Alison deserved better than Casey, and she must have agreed, because she said she was through with Casey for good. Alison walked in then, and Casey took off. \n\n\nMatt asked Alison how she was doing, and she thanked him for saving her life after Mark injected her. Matt asked if she was going to give Casey another chance, and he could not believe it when she said yes. He put in a pitch for himself and listed all his sterling qualities. He suggested the two of them plan a two-day getaway, with separate rooms, and Alison thought that sounded good. \n\n\nParker snitched something from Carly's desk and stuck it in his pocket. Carly asked what he was doing, and Parker said he was going out on personal business. Carly asked when he would be back, but Parker reminded her he wasn't a prisoner yet. Craig arrived as the boy was leaving, and Carly said she had a question for Craig. She wanted to know how Craig knew where to find Parker and Liberty at the mall the day before. Craig admitted that Lucy had told him, and he commented that he was enjoying Carly's appreciation. Carly asked him to leave. \n\n\nJade arrived at Emily's office, per instructions, and Emily chewed her out for the news that Alison and Casey were giving their relationship one more shot. Emily offered to double Jade's salary if she would sleep with Casey again and make sure Alison found out. The two were finalizing the details for the seduction, and Emily handed Jade a large amount of cash. Jade promised to do her best, but Emily wanted a guarantee that she could get the job done. Jade told her to get another errand girl if she liked, so Emily backed down. \n\n\nAlison approached in the hall and heard most of their conversation. When Jade left, Alison came up behind her sister and screamed at her. Emily swore she wasn't trying to hurt Alison, but she claimed she was looking out for her. Alison called that crap and told her sister Casey couldn't have broken Emily's heart, because she didn't have one. Alison called her sick in the head, and said she would make damn sure Emily couldn't pull that stunt again. \n\n\nCarly took a detour to Memorial and found Lucy. She thanked the girl for finding Parker and Liberty, and asked if there was anything she could do for her. Lucy reminded her that she had already asked Carly for a favor, to put in a word for her with Craig, but Carly had shut her down. Lucy asked again, but Carly thought Craig was too hardheaded to listen. \n\n\nParker told Liberty that he knew his parents were planning to use his trust fund money to send him to East Lake Academy. He was excited because he had found a clause that stated that the trustee could only use the money for purposes conducive to the welfare of the beneficiary. He explained that Carly was the trustee, and therefore, could make decisions, but Parker could have an attorney challenge any expenditure, and a judge would have to decide. Parker had found a lawyer on Greg's List and was expecting him momentarily. The attorney arrived, and Parker stated his case about the money in the trust. The lawyer said he needed time to study the case law, but Parker panicked because he was due to be \"shipped out\" the next day. The lawyer said there was a way to stop that, but it could get very ugly. \n\n\nThe attorney advised that a judge could remove a trustee who the judge felt was not acting in the best interests of the beneficiary. It would be up to Parker to convince a judge that his parents were wrong, and Parker stated his parents were always wrong. Parker reasoned that if he could prove a pattern of behavior by the trustee that was detrimental to his interests, the judge would remove her. The lawyer called a judge for an appointment to ask for an injunction so that Parker would not have to leave so soon, and he promised to phone the boy as soon as he had news. Liberty asked Parker if he knew how his parents would react when they found out about his actions, but the teen did not care. \n\n\nCarly ran into Craig in Old Town, and she again gave him credit for finding the missing teens. He also demanded she buy him lunch, so Carly said she had another errand to run, but she would meet him in an hour at the Lakeview. Craig promised to be waiting. Carly called Lucy and said she was meeting Craig at the Lakeview, and Lucy could take it from there. Lucy was thrilled. \n\n\nCarly and Craig met, and Carly again expressed her gratitude for his finding her child. She then stated she was doing the same thing for him, and Lucy walked in and joined them. Craig threatened to leave, but Carly reminded him there should be nothing he wouldn't do for his children, including swallowing some pride. Lucy was uncomfortable and got up to leave, but Carly stopped her. She began mediating between Craig and Lucy, but Lucy got upset and walked out. \n\n\nCarly then stood and announced she was ending her business partnership with Craig because she refused to associate with anyone who could be so cruel to his own family. Craig didn't believe her, but Carly scolded him further and said Craig had a choice: work things out with his daughter or find a new partner. \n\n\nJade went to Casey's house, and while he was not pleased to see her, he let her in. Jade said she was not about to let him wallow in self-pity, and asked him to talk to her. Casey began discussing Alison, but Jade shut him up by kissing him. Casey allowed her to continue, and soon she was on top of him as Alison burst in. She pulled Jade off Casey and smacked her hard across the face. Alison yelled to Casey that Emily had paid Jade to have sex with him, but Jade tried to justify that by saying she had wanted to do it, anyway. Alison called her a \"dirty whore\" and a \"dirty liar,\" while Jade screamed at Alison to go to hell. Jade went after Alison, but Casey stopped her and got her to admit her part in Emily's scheme. Casey called Jade crazy and threw her out. \n\n\nAlison started to leave, but Casey asked her to stay. He mentioned that, according to Matt, Alison had changed her mind about the do-over she had promised Casey, but Alison said that was news to her. She remarked that they needed to stop listening to other people, and Casey agreed. Alison also asked him to stop being so free and easy with other girls, and Casey was ashamed, and agreed. \n\n\nCraig went to the hospital to see his daughter. He found Lucy and said he wanted a relationship with her. She tried to make him understand why she had felt compelled to take Johnny from him, and they agreed to work on their little family. Craig, however, had one condition before he would commit: Lucy had to cut Dusty Donovan out of her life completely. He said he was fearful Dusty would try to take Johnny away, so Lucy had to choose. Lucy agreed to that condition and gave her word, because family came first. Lucy asked her father not to completely rule out the possibility of changing his mind about that some day, and Craig was open to that. Lucy hugged her father, and Craig left. \n\n\nCraig went to Carly's to remind her that she still owed him a lunch. He explained how he had made Lucy choose between Dusty and him, and the girl had picked him. \n\n\nAlison went back to Yo's, where Matt was expecting her to arrive ready to hear his plans for their overnight adventure. He was disappointed that she did not bring a bag, and she told him she could not go. Matt figured it was because of Casey, and Alison said it was. She thanked him again for saving her life, and kissed him goodbye. \n\n\nCasey walked in on Emily at the Intruder office. He told her Jade had admitted that Emily had paid her to have sex with him. Emily confessed she just did not want to see him with her sister. She offered to back down, but Casey said that was not enough. He wanted one more favor: her blessing on his relationship with Alison. After he left, Emily went to Lily's to talk with Jade. She wanted her money back, but Jade was not about to let it go. \n\n\nCasey waited for Alison with two skateboards. She arrived and gave him a kiss before they took off to have some fun the way they used to. \n\n\nLucy called someone and told him that her father had gone soft, so they were back in business.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Emily and Allison talk about how she wants to try again with Casey, as Emily hides her dismay. Casey tries to apologize to Matt, but he is hearing it.

Allison confronts Matt and asks him to understand why she needs to see this through, as she says goodbye to him. Emily tells Jade to back off because she thinks that after everyone stops trying to pull Allison and Casey apart, they will fall apart all on their own and then she can have Casey all to herself. Parker enlists the help of a lawyer in respect to some clauses in his trust fund. Parker wants his mom to be removed as trustee so they can't use that money to send him away. Liberty is unsure of this route because it will really hurt his parents. Parker is determined to do whatever he has to, to stay in town.

Carly threatens to no longer be partners with Craig if he treats his family so badly. After hearing Carly out, Craig goes to see Lucy and makes amends.
