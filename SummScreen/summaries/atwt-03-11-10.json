    "soap_central": "\n\n \nBarbara and Henry discussed his new expensive suit and plans for a fabulous sports car.  Henry was sorry, however, that Katie would not allow him to use any of the Stenbeck fortune for baby Jacob.  Barbara flattered Henry shamelessly, and she dropped her robe to tempt him into bed with her again.  Later, the two went to Fashions, and Henry picked out a bright red dress that Barbara thought was \"a little too much\" for a woman of her age.  Henry, however, wanted her to have it, as they flirted among the racks of clothes.  Henry tried to kiss Barbara, as Kim walked through the door and saw them.\n\n\nHenry quickly claimed that he and Barbara had just run into each other, and he lied that he was looking at a birthday present for his sister, Maddie.  Kim looked at the red dress Henry was holding and commented that a thousand dollar designer dress was perfect to \"wear around campus.\"  Henry finally looked Kim in the eye and said he was buying the dress for Barbara as a token of his affection.  Barbara was flabbergasted and pulled Henry aside to scold him, but Henry said that he was not ashamed to date an older woman.    He handed her his credit card and told her to buy the dress.  Then he kissed Barbara on the cheek and said he wanted to go make sure that Katie heard it from him.\n\n\nKim and Barbara went outside and sat on one of the benches in Old Town.  Kim said that Henry was \"an original,\" who did not fit into the category of most men.  Barbara giggled, and Kim left to take lunch to Bob at the hospital.\n\n\nKatie called Vienna and left another message that Henry was much more mature, and besides that, he was loaded.  She explained about the Stenbeck fortune and said that Henry was looking for something good to do with the money, but he needed some guidance.  Katie hung up and went to pick up Jacob, but she noticed that the baby's teddy bear was missing one of its button eyes.  She panicked that Jacob might have swallowed the button, so she quickly bundled up the baby and put him in his car seat, but her car would not start.  Katie got out of the car and began to run across the street, but a gray car appeared and knocked her down.\n\n\nThe driver jumped out of the car and ran to Katie.  He looked at her and said her name in surprise, as Katie opened her eyes and said, \"Chris Hughes?\"  Katie got up, unhurt, and she asked what Chris was doing in town.  He replied that he had just gotten off a plane, and he thought it was time he visited home.  Katie said that she had to get her baby to the hospital, and she showed Jacob to Chris.  Chris offered to check the baby out, and he got his medical bag from his car. They went inside where Chris examined Jacob and pronounced the boy fine.  He also found the missing button on the floor, and Katie was relieved.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Dr. Bob and Reid Oliver discussed a delicate procedure that Reid had successfully performed on a patient at Memorial.  Bob had to admit that Oliver had enhanced the prestige of the hospital, but he said it was still difficult for him to deal with the doctor's ego.  Bob hinted how important it would be to the facility if Reid stayed on board, but Dr. Oliver said that was not going to happen.  \n\n\nReid left to get the final okay from the Oakdale Police for his leaving town, as Kim joined her husband for lunch.  She referred to Dr. Oliver as \"a constant headache,\" but Bob was still a big supporter.  He said he had always hoped to train his replacement at Memorial before he retired, and for a while, he had thought that might be their son, Christopher.  But Chris had left, and Dr. Oliver was the best doctor Bob had seen in a long time.  Kim was opposed because of the doctor's lack of \"people skills,\" and she said she wouldn't miss him when he got on a plane to Texas.\n\n\nAt the police station, Luke explained again to an officer that he did not want to see Damian before he was transferred to another penal facility.  Luke walked out and literally ran into Reid Oliver, who called Luke \"Richie Rich\" and made a crack about his father.  Luke was furious, and he grabbed Oliver by the collar and got right in his face.  He said he was sick of the sound of Reid's voice, and said that the doctor did not care at all that his father was going to jail for the rest of his life.  Oliver interrupted and quipped, \"It's a good thing you have a spare.\"  Luke said that Dr. Oliver might be the world's best neurosurgeon, but as a human being, he was rock bottom.\n\n\nTheir conversation switched to Noah and his impending departure to Dallas.  Oliver told Luke to stop acting like a spoiled brat, and he continued into the police station.  When he had gotten his clearance from the cops, Oliver went home to Katie's, where he walked in on Chris Hughes and Katie conversing.  Katie introduced the doctors, but Chris said he remembered Dr. Oliver well and had hoped never to see his face again.  Oliver looked surprised, and Katie explained that Reid had been her housemate for a couple of months while he was working at Memorial with Chris's dad.\n\n\nReid told Katie that he wanted to know what \"the clown\" had against him, so Chris reminded him that they had gone to medical school together.  He also said that Oliver had \"stolen\" an important fellowship from Chris and a woman doctor from Stanford.  He accused Reid of cheating by reporting lab work he had not actually done, and he said he couldn't wait to clue in Dr. Bob about Oliver's medical ethics.  Reid looked at Katie and said he would be back when \"Doogie\" Hughes was gone, as Chris told him to \"go to hell.\"  Reid decided to stay and have something to eat, and Katie began to wonder if she was wrong to trust Dr. Oliver since everyone else in town hated him.\n\n\nHenry arrived at Katie's, but Reid opened the door.  Reid went back to eating his snack in the kitchen, as Henry announced to Katie that he was not going to interfere in her life any longer.  If she wanted to make \"Dr. Nightmare\" her next big mistake, it was her business.  Katie said Reid was just a housemate, but over her protests, Henry said it was only a matter of time before Katie fell for Reid, who was yet another \"wrong guy.\"  \n\n\n\nChris Hughes walked into the room, and Henry greeted him.  Chris asked who the \"wrong guy\" was whom Henry was referring to, and Katie said it was Reid Oliver.  Chris began to laugh and said that Henry was right about one thing: Reid Oliver was the \"wrong guy\" for Katie, all right.  Chris then turned to Reid and said, \"Do you want to tell him?\"  Reid paused and then said between bites of his snack, \"I'm the wrong guy for Katie.\"\n\n\nHenry asked how that could be, so Reid continued by saying, \"I happen to be gay.\"  Henry looked stupefied, and he walked over and looked very closely at the doctor.  Chris said his goodbyes and promised to contact Katie again before he left town.  Henry accused Reid of buttering up Katie to get Henry to build him a \"surgery palace\" at Memorial.  Reid said he had never hidden the fact that he was gay, and Katie said she had known almost from the beginning.  Henry demanded to know why she hadn't told him, and Katie said because if was none of Henry's business.  Reid left for work to wrap up a few more details before he left town, and Henry kept on with his rant at Katie.\n\n\nKatie finally asked Henry what had happened to his promise that he would not interfere in her life any longer, and she announced that their conversation was over.  She pushed Henry out the door, and he only remembered outside that he had forgotten to tell her that he was sleeping with Barbara.\n\n\nNoah visited Luke at home, and he said that he had heard about Damian.  Noah said he had stopped by to \"take care of a few things,\" and he handed Luke a legal document that nullified Noah's adoption by Lily and Damian.  He said that he felt he could never be truly independent if he was connected like that to Luke's family.  He also said that his surgery with Dr. Oliver wouldn't cost him anything because he was part of a research project, and he would also have a part in the research.  Luke asked what was in it for the doctor, but Noah didn't care.  Luke was concerned to know if Noah wanted his independence from his parents or from him.  Noah asked Luke to drive him to his final appointment with Dr. Oliver before they left town.\n\n\nLuke helped Noah to an exam room at Memorial, and the boys began to say goodbye.  Luke told Noah that he loved him, and the boys kissed, as Reid watched through a window.  When Luke left the room, Reid said that in spite of what he had done, Damian was still Luke's father.  Luke realized that was as close to an apology as he was going to get, and he asked if he could go to Dallas some time during Noah's recovery, just to encourage him.  Oliver said he would get Noah a playgroup instead, but Luke said that he was in love with Noah, and it was a feeling Dr. Oliver should try some time.  Then Luke said he was thinking that Oliver's whole bedside manner was an act.  Reid turned to go in to Noah, and Luke said, \"See you in Dallas,\" and Oliver answered, \"Hope not.\"\n\n\nKim and Bob ate their lunch in the on call room, and Bob had locked the door.  Someone knocked persistently, so finally Bob got up to open it.  He was amazed to find his son on the other side, and he called out, \"Christopher!\"  Kim jumped up to hug her boy, and they both asked their son if everything was all right.  Chris said yes, and he had just wanted to see his folks again.  He chided them about not telling him any of their adventures, such as being held hostage at Casey and Alison's non-wedding.  He also said he was not sure that he would return to practice in Africa, and then he asked his father \"why the hell\" he had hired a person like Reid Oliver.\n\n\nThe three of them went to the diner to get Chris some food, and he called Oliver \"a phony.\"  He explained about the fellowship he had lost to Oliver, and Bob said that the doctor was returning very soon to Dallas.  Kim asked Chris if he would like to help out his dad at Memorial, but Chris asked his mother not to \"go down that road.\"  Then Kim asked if he had returned because Casey and Alison had broken up, but Chris said that relationships just didn't work for him.  He left the diner and bumped into Katie again in Old Town.  She thanked him again for looking at her baby, and he extended his sympathy again for her loss of Brad.  Chris said he was focusing on work at the moment, as they watched Kim and Bob hug through the diner window.\n\n\nBarbara sat in the Lakeview lounge with a drink, and Henry joined her.  She asked how Katie had taken the news about their being a couple, but Henry said that \"Dr. Twisted\" had been there, and he and Katie had fought about him.  Henry told Barbara that Reid was gay and asked if she had known, but Barbara just laughed.  She said he had no way of knowing that, and then she said that she liked Henry just the way he was.  They were about to kiss when Henry's phone rang.  He saw that it was Katie, but he ignored it and kissed Barbara.\n\n\nThey left the lounge, and Barbara said that Henry needed to get over his obsession about Katie.  She knew just the ticket, and she invited him to her room for some activities that would clear his mind.  They got into the elevator, just as Vienna walked into the Lakeview and spoke to the desk clerk.\n\n\n",
