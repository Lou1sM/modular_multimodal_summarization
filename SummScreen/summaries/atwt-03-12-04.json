Later, a security guard makes a round and flashes a light inside Lisa's store.  Sarah ducks for cover until he goes away.  When she feels safe, Sarah starts to rummage through all of the clothes on the racks, trying on outfit after outfit.\n\n\nMargo, Jess, Ben, and Curtis all try to figure out where Sarah could be at Margo's place.  Casey and Lisa return.  Curtis guesses Sarah might be at Lisa's store and finds a way to let Lisa know without alerting everyone else.  A short time later, Lisa, Curtis, and the police catch Sarah all dressed up inside Lisa's store.  Casey tags along and apologizes for dreaming up the idea of hiding Sarah.  Jess and Ben arrive and demand an apology on Lisa's behalf.  After, Jess says Child Services wants to take Sarah away from her.  Jess throws up her hands and says, \"If that's OK with you, that's OK with me.\"  Sarah looks up with her big brown eyes not knowing what's next.  Jess gives an ultimatum.  If Sarah promises to drop the attitude and start showing respect for what Jess and Ben are trying to do for her, then Jess will try everything in her power to fight Child Services to keep her under her roof.   \"But you have to want it Sarah.  It's up to you!\"  Sarah reluctantly agrees.\n\n\nHolden interrupts Lily and Luke playing a game.  It's almost time for Lily's in-home session with Dr. Michaels.  The doorbell rings and Holden answers.  He opens the door and finds Dusty.  He wants to see Lily, but Holden doesn't think it's such a good idea.  Lily intervenes and invites him inside.  The doorbell rings again.  This time Lily answers and this time it's Molly at the door.  Lily's claws drop and she starts to swipe at Molly for recently harboring Luke, Faith, and Natalie.  Holden steps in and pulls the two apart.  He thanks Molly for stopping by and tells her he'll be in touch later.  Dr. Michaels drops by as Holden demands to know why Lily lashed out at Molly.\n\n\nLater at Al's, Holden leans on Molly's shoulder.  He apologizes for getting Molly involved.  Molly says she has no regrets and tells him to call on her next time he needs anything.\n\n\nDr. Michaels asks Lily for honest answers to her questions.  She asks if she wants to be helped by therapy.  Lily says she just wants to return to the way she was before Rose died.  Lynne asks her if she had to choose between Rose and her family, which is the most important.  \"Can you keep your sister's memory alive and take care of your family?  Which would be more important to you?\"  At first Lily says, \"I don't think I should have to choose.\"  But then she relents and says she would of course choose her family.  Lynne says good job, packs up her things, and says, see ya in the morning for round two.\n\n\nHolden returns and Lily informs her husband that she will not be giving him a scorecard on what happens in therapy.  He wants to know why she is shutting him out.  She says, \"I am following your conditions.  Now will you please follow mine?\"  Seconds after he leaves to pick up the children, Dusty stops by.  Lily vows to push forward with the foundation despite Holden and Lynne's advice.\n\n\nJack tells Craig that Rosanna has disappeared from St. Bart's in the Caribbean.

Meanwhile, at Fairwinds, the maid is tied up and gagged on the floor and the place is ransacked.  \n\n\nCarly, Paul, and Lucy check in to a nearby hotel.  Paul reserves two adjoining rooms.  Lucy makes goo goo eyes at Paul, but he doesn't see what's going on.  Carly calls Jack and tells her husband she's snowed in and won't make it back tonight.  Jack isn't happy his wife can't find another alternative, but relents and wishes her a safe return in the morning.  Lucy and Paul return from the gift shop with overnight supplies.  Later, Lucy enters Paul's room dressed only in an over-length college T-shirt.  She starts to massage his sore neck.  After the massage, Paul tells her he doesn't want to do anything to jeopardize their friendship.  Lucy's heart is crushed.  Carly enters his room to break the tension and Lucy leaves to take a cold shower.  Carly thinks Paul asked her to tag along to be a buffer, but Paul pleads stupidity and ignorance.  He promises to stifle Lucy's advances.  Carly starts to talk business since that's why she's there.  She brings up an idea of accessorizing the clothing with jewelry.  Paul loves the plan.  Paul and Carly celebrate the idea with mini-bar beers as Lucy draws a heart in a steamed-up window in the other room.  Inside the heart, she draws the letters PR + LM.\n\n\nCraig ambushes Lucinda at the Lakeview.  He says he's been waiting for her while she was in a Worldwide meeting.  She asks, \"Why?  Do you want to borrow money?  Why are you lurking?\"   He wants to know where Lucy is, and Lucinda is more than happy to tell him Paul took her up to the interview.  When Craig learns Lucy is snowed in, he stiffs Lucinda with the bar tab and heads off.\n\n\nJack investigates the break-in at Fairwinds.\n\n\nCraig drives through the snow toward his daughter.\n\n\n\n\n",
