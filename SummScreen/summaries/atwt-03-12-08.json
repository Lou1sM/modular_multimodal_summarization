Noah asked Luke if he had any doubts about Noah's impending marriage to Ameera and told him that if he did Noah would back out of the ceremony. Luke reassured Noah that he was fine with the marriage and would probably love Noah more watching him save Ameera. As the two were ready to kiss, they were interrupted when Aaron returned home from visiting his mother in Seattle. Aaron was shocked to learn about Noah's nuptials. \n\n\nAs the Snyder family prepared for Noah's marriage of convenience to Ameera, everyone wondered if they were making the right decision. Lily was especially concerned if Luke would be all right watching his boyfriend, Noah, marry Ameera. When Lily and the girls went upstairs to help Ameera dress for the ceremony, Emma asked Holden if he and Lily were getting back together. Holden replied that he thought things were heading in that direction and his mother was pleased that he and Lily were reuniting. As Emma and Holden hugged, Aaron came in and told his dad he needed to talk. Moments later, Lily reentered the kitchen and told everyone Ameera was gone. As the family discussed where Ameera might have gone, she returned and said she had just been on a walk and was troubled that the marriage ceremony was taking place in a church, because she was a Muslim. The family understood her concerns and decided to have the wedding at the farm. With the location taken care of, Noah asked Luke to be his best man and Luke happily accepted. He even agreed to help Noah write his vows. \n\n\nIn the kitchen, Aaron told Holden that he was returning to Seattle and didn't know when he would return to Oakdale. He explained that his mom's cancer might be back and he needed to be with her during that time. He agreed he would stay for Noah and Ameera's wedding and then would leave for Seattle right after. Holden reminded Aaron that he would always have a home with him in Oakdale and hoped he would be back soon. \n\n\nLater, Aaron found Luke at the kitchen table writing Noah's vows and asked his step-brother if he was all right. Luke admitted that things were not ideal with Noah because they would have to hide their relationship. He went on to explain that one reason he came out to everyone was so he wouldn't have to conceal who he really was or hide his relationships from his family. Aaron offered Luke advice and told him to protect himself while hoping for the best with Noah. \n\n\nOnce Ameera was dressed, the family reassembled for the ceremony. As everyone went outside, Emma saw Luke looking sad and explained that great love sometimes required great sacrifice. He confessed he had learned that lesson by watching how much his family sacrificed for him. Emma reminded Luke that Noah was lucky to have someone who loved him so much. \n\n\nThe wedding ceremony finally began and as the justice of the peace spoke, Luke stared longingly at Noah. Throughout the ceremony the two men shared glances as both struggled with Noah's decision to marry Ameera. Noah and Ameera exchanged vows and were declared husband and wife, but when the time came to kiss the bride, Noah gently pecked his new bride on the cheek. When he got the wedding certificate he offered it to Ameera as her \"ticket to freedom.\" Everyone went inside to celebrate the couple's marriage. At every possible moment, Luke and Noah exchanged glances or held hands, obviously trying to validate their love for one another. Ameera went upstairs to bed alone while Noah and Luke looked at the wedding certificate and hoped they could share one someday. \n\n\nLily and Holden were so inspired by the wedding they had just witnessed that they decided to renew their vows again. \n\n\nAfter Aaron left the farm, he stopped by Java for some coffee and called the airlines to confirm his flight. While he was on the phone, Alison came upon him and asked how his mother was doing. The two reminisced about their trip to Seattle together and their past mistakes in love. They wished one another well and Alison watched as Aaron left town again. \n\n\nJack and Carly learned that the dummies of Cowboy Jack that had been appearing throughout their home were being made at the Chicago Loop Scenic Shop, the same Chicago warehouse where Kit had lured Carly and tried to kill her. Carly insisted that they go immediately and look for Kit. Jack initially protested Carly's involvement because he feared for her safety, but he finally gave in and took her with him to Chicago. Jack and Carly decided to wait for dark so that they could slip past the police guard and search for Kit alone. \n\n\nOnce night came, Jack and Carly made the house look like they had gone to bed for the night and snuck out the back into a borrowed car. On the road to Chicago, Carly and Jack discussed their concerns over whether or not Kit had returned to the warehouse, and if they would find her there and get her to confess so they could save Parker. \n\n\nIn Katie's room, Brad and Katie continued their search for Henry, but came up with no good leads on his whereabouts. Brad and Katie were convinced that something bad had happened to Henry. Brad was sure that Gray was behind Henry's disappearance and thought that he could learn Henry's location by confronting Gray and slapping him around. Katie pleaded with Brad not to deal with Gray and he relented. Brad tried to convince Katie that the best way to come up with a plan was to get their minds off everything and relax, may be with a little love-making. Katie refused Brad's advances and told him to focus on coming up with a plan to find Henry. \n\n\nHenry remained tied up in the Chicago warehouse, talking to a Cowboy Jack dummy and struggling to get out of his ropes. While bantering with the puppet, he remembered his cell phone was in his pants. Henry managed to get his phone out and called Katie with his mouth. Henry got through to Katie and Brad and told them that he was trapped in a warehouse with the dummy. Katie asked him where he thought he was, but Henry had no idea until he looked around and saw a board with the name Chicago Loop Scenic Shop. Katie told him that she and Brad were on their way and the two immediately left to rescue Henry. As Henry celebrated his luck, Kit appeared and hit him over the head with a hammer, knocking him unconscious. \n\n\nBrad and Katie sped to Henry's rescue, hoping that no one had discovered he had contacted them. When they arrived at the warehouse the two split up to search for Henry. Moments later, Jack and Carly arrived at the same warehouse and went inside. Jack saw someone lurking around and drew his gun and told them to freeze. He was shocked to find out Brad was the man he saw. Katie stumbled upon the trio and was surprised to see Jack and Carly. She asked if Jack and Carly were there looking for Henry and before they could answer, the lights in the warehouse went out, plunging everyone into darkness. Once emergency lights came on, the four regrouped and learned that Jack and Carly were looking for Kit, while Brad and Katie were searching for Henry. They marveled at the coincidence, and Jack told Brad and Katie to watch the door while he and Carly searched for Kit and Henry. Katie thought she heard a noise and left Brad to man the door as she continued to search for her best friend. As Carly and Jack walked through the dark warehouse, one of the Cowboy Jack dolls was thrown in their direction. They managed to jump clear of the dummy right before it hit them and were comforted by the fact that Kit was probably the one who threw it. As they turned the corner, the two found Henry tied up and looked for a way to free him. \n\n\nAs Katie walked thorough the warehouse looking for Henry, she was startled when she felt a gun at her back. She turned and found Kit holding the gun. Kit was shocked that the blonde she found was Katie and not Carly and, as she cursed her bad luck, Katie reached for the gun. The two began to struggle over the weapon and Kit finally knocked Katie out and ran off with the gun. Brad realized Katie had been gone too long and set out to find her. As he searched for Katie, he found Kit and told her she wasn't leaving. Kit pulled the gun on Brad, just as Jack and Carly arrived and told her to give up. Katie stumbled onto the scene, dazed from being knocked out, and called Jack's name. When Jack was momentarily distracted, Kit took her shot and managed to hit Jack. Kit ran from the scene as Brad rushed to help Jack. As Carly ran after Kit with Jack's weapon, she told Brad to call 9-1-1. As he leaned over Jack to check on him and call 9-1-1, Katie passed out. Carly found Kit and told her to stop or she would fire. Kit reminded Carly that shooting her wouldn't keep Parker out of jail, but when Kit tried to escape the two exchanged gun fire.\n\n\n",
