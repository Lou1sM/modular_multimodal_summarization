    "soap_central": "\n\nBrad and Katie played gin rummy, but Brad couldn't concentrate because he was frustrated since he had to refrain from making love to his wife as they waited for the call from Vienna. He needed his \"boys\" to be at full strength for his trip to the hospital for Vienna's impregnation. Vienna finally phoned and announced she had \"dropped an egg,\" which Katie interpreted as a successful ovulation. They arranged to meet at the hospital, and a buoyant Brad declared his \"torpedoes\" were \"fully loaded.\" Katie was also excited that they finally had a chance to make a baby together. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview Bar, and with martini glass in hand, a glum Henry fantasized about Vienna's giving birth. In his dream, Vienna demanded that Henry catch the baby, but when the time came, Vienna delivered a fully adult, naked Brad, who was hollering, \"Hello, Sucker!\" The real Vienna interrupted Henry by telling him it was time to go to the hospital. \n\n\nLuke and Noah had to relive the deaths of their friends by giving their statements to the police. Noah gave Luke lots of credit for not giving up, and keeping on the case, despite warnings from Margo and personal danger. Noah realized Luke's spirits were down, and he suggested that Luke should go back to college and put his life on another track. Noah had to leave to study for a midterm exam, so the boys agreed to meet later. \n\n\nLily took a phone message for Lucinda and told her mother that she and Luke were supposed to have a meeting with Grant Moran, the director of the Starglow Foundation, to talk about partnering on a joint project with Luke's foundation. Lily called Luke to remind him, but her son did not answer his phone, so she left a message. Lily said Lucinda might have to go to the meeting alone if they did not reach Luke in time, but her mother claimed she was too under the weather from her radiation treatments to venture out of the house. Lily apologized for not being sensitive enough to her mother's condition. Lucinda also admitted that she missed Brian, whom she had really liked. Lucinda suggested that Lily go to the meeting since she was a fellow board member. \n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Brad and Katie met up with Henry and Vienna. Henry tried to get Vienna to change her mind about the surrogacy, because he was concerned that she would carry the child for nine months and then not want to give it up. Vienna asked him to stop harping on that aspect, but she did tell him if he wanted to back out, that it was time he needed to speak up. Henry decided to honor their pledge to Brad and Katie and agreed to go along. A nurse took Vienna to her room, and she handed Brad a sterile container and some magazines. Brad took the container, but scorned the entertainment materials. He went into an exam room alone, as Katie hugged Henry and thanked him again. \n\n\nWithin minutes, Brad called Katie to the exam room and explained that his \"whole business wasn't working.\" Henry asked what the holdup was and cracked himself up with continual raunchy wordplays and puns. Finally Katie got angry and told him she took back all the nice things she had said about him. Brad begged Katie to come into the room with him, but she refused until he said he wanted her to be part of the process. Katie sneaked into the room with her husband. \n\n\nLuke arrived home, and Lily reminded him of the foundation meeting. Luke was willing to cancel the meeting and said he did not feel up to it because he was \"taking a break.\" Lily was irritated, but she said she would go in his place. Lucinda called Luke \"a spoiled brat,\" and scolded him for not taking his responsibility seriously. Lily walked out and called Noah. She asked him to come to the meeting because he knew more about the foundation business than she did. When Noah arrived at Worldwide, Lily asked him why Luke was so down in the dumps. Noah said Luke just needed space to make the right decisions. Both of them were shocked when Brian Wheatley walked into the boardroom. \n\n\nAt Lily's Lucinda asked Luke what he was going to do about the foundation. Luke explained he was no longer the na\u00efve kid who had taken money from Damian Grimaldi and chosen to do good works because he knew it would bug the hell out of his \"so-called father.\" Luke was feeling like just what he was: a dumb college kid who got kicked out of school for stealing an election. \n\n\nAt Worldwide, Brian asked for Luke, and he said he had made the initial contact with Grant Moran, and he wanted to make sure things went smoothly. Lily knew Moran, but she felt more comfortable with Brian there. Moran arrived, and Noah excused himself to make a quick call. He phoned Luke and told him to get to the meeting immediately. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to Vienna's room, and Brad announced, \"Mission accomplished!\" Vienna tried to explain the process of washing the sperm to Henry, but he wanted no details. The doctor arrived with Brad's sample, so Henry positioned Brad so that he could not see Vienna. Vienna requested that Henry actually inject the sample, but Brad turned around suddenly and yelled, \"Swim for it, boys!\" and startled Henry, who spun around and waved his arms, knocking the tray and its contents to the floor. Henry said he was sorry, but Katie said he was not to worry. Brad would just do it again. Brad said he couldn't do it without Katie, so they both left to try again. \n\n\nThe foundation meeting began, and Brian told Moran he was no longer working for the foundation, but that should make no difference. Moran, however, remarked that without Brian's personal involvement, the mission statement of the foundation was too vague. Luke walked in and immediately disagreed with Moran. He suggested instead that Starglow was not comfortable with the fact that Luke's foundation supported the gay arts festival and other controversial events. He stressed that his group celebrated equal rights for everyone, and he invited Starglow to stay and work with them or go their own way. \n\n\nBrian and Lily were pleased at how Luke stepped up and expressed himself and his goals. Luke then asked Brian to speak, and he reiterated Luke's sentiments. Moran stood up and walked out, telling Brian to look for a new partner. Lily congratulated Luke on his words, and then she asked Brian to stop by her house to see Lucinda. \n\n\nBrad and Katie cuddled in the exam room, and Brad suggested they try one of Henry and Vienna's fantasy games. Katie opted out of that, but she did begin describing a romantic scene. They declared their love for one another, and had a close moment. Back in Vienna's room, Vienna asked Henry if he had knocked down the tray on purpose. Henry said no, but he did say he could not be responsible for the actions of his subconscious. He confessed that he was jealous of the baby who would be so close to Vienna for nine months. Brad and Katie came back, along with the doctor and nurse, and a new sample. Brad and Henry left the room, and the doctor went to work, while Katie held Vienna's hand. \n\n\nLuke, Noah, and Lily went home and brought Brian with them. Luke explained to Lucinda that Brian had attended the meeting, so Lucinda invited him to sit with her and tell her about it. Brian described how Luke had spoken up and recommended that Luke continue to be actively involved in the overseeing of the foundation. Luke said he was tired of being a \"spoiled brat,\" and he would be taking a greater interest in the affairs of the foundation. They discussed finding someone with business experience to head the foundation, and Lily said she knew just the person: herself. \n\n\nLucinda asked Brian if he thought Lily could do the job, and Brian was enthusiastic about it. Luke went out with Noah, and Lily left to give her mother some privacy with Brian. Brian said he had missed her, and he held her hand. He told her he had a new job in Minneapolis and had only come back because Lily had requested him. He asked for some sort of relationship or friendship with Lucinda, and Lucinda said she had always wanted a friend in Minnesota. They agreed to keep in touch. \n\n\nLuke and Noah went to Old Town, and Noah said Luke had been his old self at the meeting. He remembered how comfortable Luke was in his own skin when he had first met him. The boys kissed, and they decided to go back to Noah's dorm room to be together. \n\n\nBrad and Katie brought balloons and cupcakes for a celebration in Vienna's hospital room. Vienna referred to the baby as \"little Sven or little Inga,\" and Brad spoke up and reminded her that he and Katie would be naming the baby. Vienna said she had to call the baby something all those months, so Katie agreed that Vienna could call the child whatever she wanted for as long as the baby was with her. They took Vienna back to the Lakeview and put her to bed. Brad kept encouraging \"his boys\" to \"seal the deal,\" until Henry asked him to please knock off the metaphors. Brad and Katie felt Vienna's belly, and Henry finally joined them. Brad uttered a bizarre prayer to the baby, and they all bonded except for Henry, who turned his back.\n\n\n",

Lily decides to be the new administrator for Luke's foundation. Vienna is ovulating so Brad has to do his part but he has a hard time doing that unless Katie is in the room with him.

Vienna is inseminated and Brad, Katie, and Vienna are hopeful that she is pregnant and all three are sure they feel the baby kick.
