Jack didn't want to confuse Sage, and he worried about Janet being comfortable staying at the farm, if the baby were Dusty's. Jack told Carly that if Janet's baby were Jack's, then it would take time to sort through things. Carly wondered how much time, and he promised that Carly and he would be together. Jack left to attend Janet's sonogram, and Carly hustled out of the station.\n\n\n       At the farm, Janet pulled out Dusty's ring, and Dusty arrived. She said that she couldn't wear his ring until she knew who the baby's father was. Dusty asserted that the baby was his, even if Janet didn't want it to be. He'd talked to bone marrow specialists, who'd said that Jack's baby would have only a slight advantage over Dusty's baby in matching Liberty. Dusty asked Janet to try to be happy when the doctor confirmed that he was the father. Janet said she'd be happy, and she'd wear his ring.\n\n\n       Later, Jack surprised Janet when he showed up for her sonogram. Jack felt that she shouldn't have to do it alone. Just then, Dusty appeared and said that she wasn't alone. Carly showed up, and Janet looked outraged. Janet and Carly bickered about Carly's right to be there until Dusty pulled Janet aside. Carly asked if Jack were glad to see her. He replied that he was glad that she'd arrived, but he was also glad that she trusted him enough to leave. Carly frowned as she watched the doctor usher Janet, Dusty, and Jack into an exam room.\n\n\n       Carly went to the Lakeview to work on Monte Carlo with Craig, and she literally bumped into Barbara. Barbara admired Carly's sketches, but soured upon guessing that Carly had partnered with Craig again. Barbara assumed that Craig and Carly had reunited, but Carly revealed that she was back with Jack. Barbara said that she and Carly were both high on life. Carly agreed, but murmured that it was complicated. Barbara remarked that she'd had a good man once, but she'd allowed herself to be seduced by Craig. Barbara cited that Carly was smarter than Barbara had ever been, and Barbara suggested that Carly stay that way.\n\n\n       During the sonogram, an anxious Janet asked the doctor how far along she was. The doctor estimated 5 weeks. \"Then, I guess-uhm-\" Jack said, \"I'm the father?\" Jack broke into a proud smile, and Dusty grimaced. Dusty left Janet and Jack to talk alone, and the Synders agreed that they wanted the best for Liberty and the baby, even if their baby turned out not to be a match. Janet murmured that she'd almost believed that the baby was Dusty's.\n\n\nJack stated that Liberty was opposed to having the baby donor, but Janet said that she'd just make sure that Liberty understood that it wasn't just a donor baby to \"me,\" meaning Janet. \"To us,\" Jack corrected. Janet decided to tell Liberty the news alone, since it'd just be the two of them again. Jack asked about Dusty, and Janet replied that she didn't have the right to ask Dusty for anything. She asked about Carly, and Jack responded that Carly had known that he could be the father. Janet wondered how Carly would react upon knowing that it had been confirmed.\n\n\nJack went to Carly's house, and before the words got out of his mouth, Carly guessed that the baby was his. He said that he'd felt like an interloper at the sonogram, but then he was suddenly a dad. Carly held her head down, but Jack lifted it back up. He said that the only thought he'd had at that moment had been of Carly. \"And how much I need you,\" he uttered. He tenderly kissed her, and the two went upstairs to make love.\n\n\n       Cuddling later, Carly suggested that they talk to the kids. Jack said it'd soon be obvious that Janet was pregnant. Carly rolled her eyes, and Jack realized that Carly wasn't referring to the pregnancy. Instead, she wanted to tell the kids where their parents stood. Jack said he'd be there for Janet and the baby; however, he was with Carly, and that would never change.\n\n\nCarly dressed to run some errands, and Jack decided to go to the police station. He said that it was the first time that he'd known from the beginning of a pregnancy that he was the father. Carly looked insulted, but she said he'd be a great father.\n\n\n       Back at the hospital, Janet told Dusty that she was sorry that it wasn't the outcome that he'd hoped for. She thrust his ring at him, but he refused to accept it. Dusty took Janet to the farm, where he said that the baby's paternity didn't change his feelings. Janet worried about him accepting Liberty and the baby, but Dusty asserted that he loved Johnny like he was the boy's real father.\n\n\nDusty declared that Janet and he would get married and move into the house that he'd shown her. He dared Janet to say that she didn't want that as much as he did. Janet pondered the ring, but decidedly said that she was sorry. Dusty kissed her, and she handed the ring back to him. She started to cry as he walked out.\n\n\n       Moments later, Carly arrived to say that it looked like they were all in the pregnancy together. Janet asked what Carly wanted, and Carly said that she wanted what was best for Liberty and the baby. That way why Carly planned to help Janet with whatever she needed. \"Get used to this face, Janet. You're going to be seeing a lot of it,\" Carly asserted.\n\n\n       Dusty went to the police station to see Jack. Dusty stated that he understood that Jack wanted to be a stand-up guy, but Dusty would be a father to Janet's baby. Dusty said that Jack was free to be with Carly. Jack's eyes widened at Dusty's audacity.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Luke listened in the background as Reid and Katie bid each other goodbye. Katie wished Henry would stop being selfish and donate to the hospital, so that Reid could stay. Reid gave Katie his beeper number, a number that no one but his hospital had. He said that she could call him day or night. Tilting his head to the side, Reid told Luke that Luke had been eavesdropping long enough to know that it was a private conversation.\n\n\n       As Luke and Reid exchanged barbs, Katie received a text message and said she had to take off. Before going, she made Reid promise not to leave without saying goodbye. Katie left, and Reid got a message saying that his plane had been delayed. Luke offered to let Reid and Noah use Luke's jet. Reid liked the offer, but hated that Luke was the one making it.\n\n\n       Luke followed Reid to the Lakeview bar, where Luke suspected that there was another reason that Reid had refused the jet. Luke figured that it was because Luke was gay. Reid found it hysterical that Luke thought that Reid was a homophobic, considering that Reid was also gay.\n\n\n       Luke didn't believe it, but Reid said that he'd been certain of his sexuality since he was 9 years old. Luke wondered why Reid had never told Luke and Noah, but Reid said he hadn't seen a point in it. Luke reasoned that it would have helped them bond, but Reid didn't want to bond with Luke. Reid said he also wasn't interested in spilling his guts to whomever was in range.\n\n\n       After Barbara and Henry enjoyed a romp in the bed at the Lakeview, Barbara wondered if Henry regretted not donating his money to the hospital. Henry said he didn't at all, because Katie had wanted him to do it merely to keep Reid in town. Barbara suggested that they go out to dinner before having more sex later that evening. Henry hesitated, and she quipped that it was \"just a meal.\" He confirmed that it was \"just sex,\" too, and Barbara concurred.\n\n\n       Henry took the elevator downstairs, and when the doors opened, he stood face-to-face with Vienna. Henry stammered that she looked spectacular. Vienna said she'd arrived to tell him how proud she was of him for donating the Stenbeck fortune to the hospital. He wondered who'd told her that, and Vienna replied that Katie had. Vienna smiled, saying that she'd always known that he had it in him to do the right thing.\n\n\n       Vienna and Henry went to Al's, where Vienna wondered if Henry had missed her. She knew that they'd parted on bad terms, but she still longed for him. Before Henry could respond, Katie arrived, overjoyed to see Vienna. Vienna asked if there would be a ribbon-cutting ceremony for Henry's new hospital wing. Looking at Katie, Henry remarked that it was a good question. Vienna decided to pull out her old recipes and throw a party. \"Oh, don't you just love giving away millions of dollars?\" Vienna exclaimed and headed for the kitchen.\n\n\n       Henry seethed that Katie had pulled a dirty trick by calling Vienna. He insisted that it was his inheritance to do with as he pleased. Katie asked what he'd tell the woman that he loved. He replied that the woman he loved no longer loved him. Katie reasoned that Vienna's eyes were filled with love, and that was enough reason to save lives by donating money that he didn't need. \"I suppose,\" Henry murmured.\n\n\nVienna returned, and Henry's phone rang. When he saw that it was Barbara calling, he ignored the call to look at Vienna's recipes. As Vienna discussed food and visiting their old haunts, Henry wandered off to make a phone call. Vienna asked Katie if Henry were happy that Vienna had returned. Katie didn't know why he wouldn't be.\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Henry called Barbara, who was about to take a hot bath. She had bought some chocolate flavored lotion, because Henry liked to nibble. He reluctantly said that something had occurred at the diner, and he needed to cancel their plans. Barbara asked to reschedule for the following evening, but that didn't work for him, either. Though she looked disappointed, Barbara said that the beauty of their relationship was that there were no pressures.\n\n\n       Later, Vienna and Henry went to the Lakeview lobby, where she admitted that she'd missed him and the diner. He wryly smiled. She acknowledged that her arrival was awkward, and Henry conveyed that he didn't want to disappoint her again. She said he was a good man, and his donation to the hospital proved it. Henry appreciated her faith in him. Vienna uttered that he meant a lot to her. She kissed him, and Barbara rounded the corner just in time to see them.\n\n\n       Katie found Reid in Old Town to announce that she'd talked Henry into building the wing at the hospital. Reid was sorry that she'd gone through all that trouble for nothing. He said that he didn't belong in Oakdale. He felt that his life was in Dallas, and the sooner he could get the \"hell\" out of Oakdale, the better.\n\n\n",
