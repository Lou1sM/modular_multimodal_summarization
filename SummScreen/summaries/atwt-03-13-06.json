    "tvmega_recap": "Carly tries to persuade Butch into helping her fix the situation with Nick; he angrily tells her to butt out or she may wind up hurt. Carly realizes her actions caused Anatoli to realize Nick was a cop, subsequently framing him with the drugs. She dejectedly returns home, and when she sees a mug Parker and Jack ordered for her saying, \"Worlds greatest wife and mom\", she breaks down. Nick is determined to get to the bottom of being framed for drugs, all the while protecting Carly still. A frustrated Katie secretly calls Jack and asks him to meet her. She tells Jack about the whole story with Carly working at the Galaxy as a waitress and how she set up Nick so she could get Jack's job back. Jack refuses to believe her at first, but when a few things Katie says rings true, he realizes she may be right. He angrily heads home to confront Carly about what she has done. Emily tells Hal about her and Henry's find at Meg's. He wonders why Emily continues to protect a man that hurt her? Is she casting suspicion on Meg because she is afraid that Meg is replacing her in Paul's life? Emily assures him what they found is on the up and up, and Hal finally heads over to search Meg's room, with Emily hot on his tail. The police search Meg's room and find nothing; Emily is convinced she threw the wallet away once she knew they saw it. When Meg comes home, Hal asks to searcher purse? Meg nervously agrees. Hal finds her leather gloves covered in what seems to be dried blood. He brings her into the station for questioning. Jen demands answers from Paul about where Dusty is buried? Paul cannot give her an answer claiming he was confused and suffering from a concussion when he buried Dusty. Jen doesn't buy it; he is protecting someone. She then realizes Meg had just a good enough reason to want Dusty gone as much as he does. Paul pleads with her to leave Meg out of it, but Jen refuses and then even wonders if Paul's valiant efforts to protect her mean he has fallen in love with her? Gwen and Will arrive at Hal's to share the news of their marriage with him, only to find the place in a pigpen state. After they clean up, Hal comes home and is stunned to hear their news. Meg arrives at the jail cell and a stunned Paul finds out she is there in connection to Dusty's murder.",
