Gwen said she appreciated the effort, but nothing could stop her from missing Hallie. Gwen asked Will if he was still mad at her for making the decision to return Hallie to Sofie without consulting him. Will said he would stand by her no matter what, and they would get through it together. \n\n\nOutside the Chicago Loop Scene Design warehouse, Carly confronted Kit. Kit shot at Carly twice but missed; Carly returned fire, hitting Kit. Carly ran to Kit and asked her to admit she shot and killed Sam, but Kit only replied, \"Damn you!\" before dying. Carly returned to the warehouse, where Brad was cradling Jack's head in his hands. Brad told Carly he had called 9-1-1, but Jack had lost a lot of blood. Carly held Jack, and Brad went to try to revive Katie, who had fainted and gotten cuts on her face. \n\n\nThe police and paramedics arrived and loaded Jack onto an ambulance. Brad and Katie went in search of Henry. The police asked Carly if she knew who the dead woman was, and Carly told them she was Kit Fowler. Carly explained what had happened, and the police said they would take a complete statement from her at the hospital. When the paramedics asked Carly if she was related to Jack, she told them, \"I'm his wife\" and climbed into the ambulance with them. \n\n\nCarly called Gwen and told her what had happened. She asked Gwen to pick up JJ and Sage from a neighbor's house; call Parker, who was at a hockey game; and take care of all 3 kids for her. Gwen agreed but told Carly she wanted to meet her at the hospital. \n\n\nBrad and Katie found Henry and revived him. They asked him who had knocked him out, and Henry said Kit, but he didn't think Kit had kidnapped him. Brad told Henry that Carly had shot and killed Kit. Henry was surprised to hear that Carly had been there, and Brad told him she had come with Jack, who had also been shot. Matt arrived at the warehouse and overheard Henry telling Brad and Katie that he thought Gray Girard was responsible for his kidnapping. \n\n\nAlison went to see Casey at his house. Alison told Casey she thought Matt was up to something and that Gray Girard was bad news. She showed Casey the information about Gray that Emily's assistant had dug up, including the fact that Gray had changed his name and used to be involved in things like money laundering, gambling, and racketeering. Alison told Casey she was afraid Matt was working for Gray and would end up doing something illegal that would land him back in jail. She asked Casey to look into Matt's relationship with Gray to find out whether Gray was having Matt do his dirty work for him. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Vienna told Gray she was worried about Henry and was going to talk to Katie and Brad to try to find out if Henry was okay. When Gray saw how determined Vienna was, he told her he would help her find out what had happened to Henry. Vienna went to freshen up, and Gray called Matt, who told him the cops were at the warehouse. Gray told Matt to make it look like someone else had kidnapped Henry. \n\n\nHenry, Brad, and Katie arrived at the hospital, where they tried to find a doctor to examine Katie, who had bad lacerations on both sides of her face. Vienna walked in with Gray and saw Henry. She rushed to his side and asked what had happened to him. When Henry told her he hadn't left her the note at the Lakeview but instead had been kidnapped and nearly killed, Vienna asked who would do such a thing to him. Henry told her to ask her boyfriend. Alison, who had come into the hallway, stopped and watched the exchange between Henry, Vienna, and Gray. Gray denied having been involved and told Henry he didn't see him as a threat. Henry lunged at Gray, but Brad stopped him from hitting Gray and told Henry he needed to stay calm. \n\n\nBrad went into Jack's room, where Carly and Gwen were by Jack's side. Jack's surgeon came in to let them know Jack's condition. The surgeon said the bullet had missed all the vital organs, and Jack should make a complete recovery. Gwen told Carly she would call the kids and let them know. Brad offered to call Emma and Holden, and he left, too. As Carly spoke quietly to Jack, he awoke. \n\n\nBrad went and told Katie that Jack was going to be fine, and a nurse came in to clean Katie's wounds. He assured Katie that Jack was in good hands, and he told her how relieved he was that Kit hadn't shot Katie. Brad began to tell Katie that if anything had happened to her, he didn't know how he would go on, but he stopped, and Katie asked, \"How you would what?\" Brad said he didn't know how he'd do the TV show without her, and Katie laughed. When the nurse brought Katie her discharge paperwork, Brad told Katie he would drive her home and tuck her in, and they left together. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Brad tucked Katie into bed and told her his services included a bedtime story. He then told Katie a story about a fair maiden named Katie and a knight named Sir Bradahad, who set off on a quest to rescue their friend, Henry the Faint-Hearted. They succeeded on their quest and reunited Henry with his lady love, Vienna the Viennese Virgin. Katie laughed and asked what happened to Lady Katie and Sir Bradahad; Brad told her that chapter had not yet been written. He kissed her on the forehead, told her to have sweet dreams, and sat down in a chair to watch her fall asleep. \n\n\nMargo arrived at the hospital and went to see how Jack was doing. She asked Carly what had happened to Kit, and Carly told both Margo and Jack that Kit was dead because she had shot her. Margo asked if Kit had at least confessed to having killed Sam before she died. Carly said Kit hadn't said anything, and Margo was upset to hear that Carly had killed the only other suspect they had in Sam's murder. Margo told Carly she was very sorry, \"but clearing Parker just got a lot tougher.\" \n\n\nMargo stepped out in the hallway to take a phone call, while Henry and Brad clamored for her attention, telling her to arrest Gray for Henry's kidnapping. Margo, frustrated, hung up her phone and told Henry to come down to the station with her. Gray told Henry this was a game that Henry was going to lose. \n\n\nGwen brought Parker to the hospital to see Jack. Carly told Parker what had happened, and Parker was upset because Carly could have been killed. He also realized this was bad for his case, but Carly said everyone would know now what kind of person Kit was, because she tried to kill Jack. Carly told Parker that Jack needed to rest, and Parker left with Gwen. \n\n\nCasey went to see Will. Will told him about Gwen giving Hallie back to Sofie and about Jack having been shot. Will said he was glad Casey was there, because he could use a distraction. Casey told Will he needed to ask him for a huge favor. He explained to Will about Gray Girard and his previous identity, and he told Will that his friend Matt seemed to be involved with Gray. Casey asked Will if he could use his connections at the police station to get into the police computer and see what information he could find on Gray, because Casey's own reputation had been somewhat tarnished recently by his prison sentence. Will agreed, and they went to the police station. \n\n\nAt the station, Will spoke to an officer he knew, Detective Morrow, and told him that he was doing a project for his Criminal Justice class at college. Will said he needed access to a computer at the station to look up crime statistics for the past 5 years in more detail than he could get on a computer at the college. The officer told Will he could use his laptop in the interrogation room, and Will thanked him. He and Casey looked up Gray Girard on the computer and found nothing, but under the name Jerry Pulawski, they found a long rap sheet, including the fact that he had other aliases. As they were trying to determine what Gray's real name was, Officer Morrow came into the room and said he needed the laptop back. \n\n\nWhen Detective Morrow finished with his computer, he told Will and Casey they could have 5 more minutes and gave it back to them. However, Margo walked in with Vienna, Henry, and Gray before they could find any more information. Margo asked what they were doing, and Casey told her they were doing research for a class. Will got a call from Gwen and had to leave. When Margo tried to look at the computer to see what Casey and Will had been researching, Casey closed the laptop and said it was just boring crime stats. Just then, a man was brought into the interrogation room and said he had come to confess to kidnapping Henry. \n\n\nThe man said his name was Irv Weiner, and he asked Margo to book him. Margo was amused by the idea of someone turning himself in rather than declaring his innocence. When Henry, Gray, and Vienna walked into the room, Henry greeted Irv by name. Irv said Henry owed him money, and that was why he had kidnapped him. He told Margo he had turned himself in because his wife had found out about it and told him she would leave him if he didn't confess. Henry asked how much Gray had paid him to say these things, but Irv insisted no one had paid him. \n\n\nMargo told an officer to book Irv on a kidnapping charge. Gray told Vienna he was ready to go and asked her to leave with him. Henry reminded Vienna that they'd never had their date; Vienna agreed but said they couldn't do it that night. She told Henry she was glad he was free, but she left with Gray, telling Henry she was sorry. Gray took Vienna back to the Lakeview, where he told her to go upstairs and order a bottle of champagne and relax. After she left, Gray walked over to the bar to speak to Matt. Casey followed him and overheard him congratulate Matt on getting Irv to confess. \n\n\nCasey went to the hospital and found Alison. He told her what he had found out about Gray. Alison asked if Matt was working for Gray, and Casey said it looked like it, but he didn't know if Matt was being forced to do so or not. Casey told her this information had to stay between them, and Alison agreed and shook Casey's hand. \n\n\nHenry went to the bar at the Lakeview and told his troubles to Matt, who was tending bar. Matt told him it sounded like he'd gotten a raw deal, so he gave Henry a drink on the house. \n\n\nMargo returned to the hospital, where she told Carly she had spoken to the DA but had been unable to convince her that Kit had killed Sam. The DA said there wasn't enough evidence to drop the charges against Parker, so Parker's trial would go on as scheduled. Margo apologized and left. Carly went back into Jack's room; Jack was sleeping, and Carly turned off the light in the room and laid down in the bed next to Jack.  \n\n\n",
