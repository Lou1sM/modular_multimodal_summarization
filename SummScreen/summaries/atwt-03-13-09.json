    "soap_central": "\n\nEmily visited Paul at Fairwinds. She told him she had hired Jade to seduce Casey, but it had backfired when Alison overheard her discussing the payment arrangements. Emily said she knew Paul would understand her scheming, since he was the same type of person. Paul agreed that it was \"very Ryan-esque.\" Emily said she and Paul were two hideous people, and Paul agreed and suggested they go have coffee together at the Lakeview. Emily asked who he wanted to spy on that time. \n\n\nDusty was in the restaurant area of the Lakeview when Meg called to find out how he was feeling. He told her he was still upset about no longer being able to see Johnny, but he had enjoyed his shopping trip with Meg and baby Eliza. Meg suggested that if Lucy could reconcile with Craig, perhaps Dusty could, too. Dusty was skeptical. Dusty then saw Lucy enter the restaurant, so he quickly hung up on Meg and went to speak to Lucy. Lucy told him she couldn't talk to him anymore. She walked away when Dusty kept asking her whether or not she'd talked to her father, and as she walked out of the restaurant, she ran into Craig. \n\n\nLucy told her father that she had just told Dusty she had been wrong to sneak him in to visit Johnny. Dusty was disbelieving. Lucy told Dusty that she'd been wrong to take Johnny away from Craig, and that Dusty had no legal claim on Johnny. \n\n\nPaul and Emily arrived and stood off to the side of the lobby, listening to the discussion. Lucy said she had promised Craig she wouldn't see Dusty anymore, and she expected Dusty to abide by her wishes. Lucy walked away. Craig told Dusty, \"Losing sucks, doesn't it?\" Dusty said, \"It's not over,\" and walked away. Paul remarked to Emily, \"Lucy just sided with her lunatic father against Dudley Do-Right. What's that all about?\" \n\n\nCraig and Lucy sat down at a table, and Craig thanked her for taking his side. He told her he wished he could buy her lunch, but he had to leave, because he and Carly had a meeting about Midnight Sun. Lucy asked where Johnny was, and Craig told her he was at school. He kissed Lucy goodbye and left. \n\n\nOut in the lobby, Emily asked Paul why he found the whole Craig/Lucy/Dusty thing so fascinating. Paul said Lucy had quite loudly proclaimed her allegiance to her father, and although it pleased him to see Dusty humiliated in public like that, he wondered whether any of it was connected to Meg. Paul wanted to follow Lucy, but Emily told him to stay, saying she would follow Lucy instead, because, \"You've invaded everybody's privacy. I haven't done that all week.\" \n\n\nUpstairs, Emily watched as Lucy tried to get into Craig's room. Emily walked over and asked if Lucy was having a problem. Lucy said she was going to see her father, but he didn't appear to be in his room. Emily said she had seen Craig downstairs, so Lucy said she would try to find him. Emily then pointed out that she'd seen Lucy with Craig downstairs. Lucy nervously said, \"Well, it was really nice seeing you, Emily,\" and walked away. \n\n\nDusty ran into Meg in Old Town and told her about his encounter with Lucy and Craig. Meg asked if he thought Lucy had said those things just to put on a show for Craig. He said that was possible, but he also thought Lucy meant it when she said she didn't want to be around him anymore. Dusty changed the subject by asking what Meg was up to, and she said she was going to the discount store to buy clothes for Eliza, who had outgrown everything. \n\n\nDusty asked where Meg would shop if money was no object, and when she said \"Fashions,\" he told her that's where they would go, and he would buy Eliza some clothes. Meg protested, but Dusty said it would make him feel better to buy something for a beautiful girl. \n\n\nAt Fashions, Dusty insisted that Meg try on a dress, which he picked out from the rack. To humor him, she put it on, and he told her how beautiful she looked. Paul happened to walk by; he glanced in Fashions and saw Meg and Dusty. Meg looked over and saw Paul, too. Afterward, Meg told Dusty about Paul having seen her with him at Fashions, and Dusty thought Paul was spying. Meg thought he had simply been passing by, and the fact that he hadn't gone inside might be a sign that he had begun to accept that they were truly divorced. Dusty then asked Meg if she wanted to go out with him that evening, on a date. \n\n\nPaul went to Emily's office, where she filled him in on her encounter with Lucy. Emily wasn't sure Lucy's sneaking around had anything to do with Meg, but Paul thought it might. Emily decided Paul's interest in what was happening with Lucy was preferable to him sitting around feeling sorry for himself, and she agreed to help him follow up on Lucy's actions. \n\n\nJack went to Carly's to pick up Parker to drive him to boarding school. Carly told Jack that although she had agreed to provide a united front to Parker, she disagreed with the course of action they were taking. Jack insisted it was the right thing to do, and they went upstairs to get Parker. Parker told his parents he wasn't going anywhere, and he handed them an injunction he'd gotten from his lawyer that stated that his parents couldn't use his trust fund for the tuition at Eastlake. \n\n\nJack asked Parker what he thought he was going to accomplish by getting the injunction. Parker said a judge would have to decide whether Carly, as trustee of Parker's trust fund, could use any of the money for something Parker thought wasn't in his best interest. Jack told Parker the lawyer Parker had hired was taking advantage of him, and Carly tried to convince Parker that they didn't need a judge telling them how to act as a family. Parker was very disrespectful to his parents, and Carly and Jack demanded that he go back to his room. He did, and Jack told Carly he wasn't even sure the court order was real. Jack thought the lawyer, Shink, just wanted to get his hands on Parker's trust fund money. \n\n\nJack called Tom Hughes, who came to the house and looked at the court order. Tom said he would check out its validity. When Carly asked if Parker could really get control of his trust fund, Tom said it was possible if the court granted him status as an emancipated minor, one who would be better off away from his parents' control. Jack said that was obviously not the case, and Tom agreed, saying it was usually something that was accorded to minors who intended to get married, and Parker couldn't get married in Illinois without his parents' permission. Parker, upstairs, overheard Tom's explanation. \n\n\nTom advised Jack and Carly not to take Parker to the boarding school that day, even though Jack pointed out that the injunction only prohibited them from using the trust fund, not from sending Parker to school. Jack asked Tom to also check on the lawyer, Shink, to find out if he was legitimate. After Tom left, Jack told Carly he would call Eastlake to let them know Parker wouldn't be there that day, but Carly said she thought it was obvious that they couldn't send Parker at all. \n\n\nAt the diner, Liberty told her mother she needed to buy a book for her history class. Janet said she'd go with her daughter, because she didn't want to leave Liberty alone again until Parker was out of town. Liberty became upset, but Janet pointed out that Liberty hadn't done well with the freedom Janet had given her up to that point. Janet told Liberty she agreed with Jack about Liberty and Parker's relationship, and Liberty accused her mom of putting her husband ahead of her daughter. \n\n\nWhen Liberty and Janet returned to the diner, Liberty pointed out that Janet had been the one who had thought Liberty and Parker should go out together. Janet said that was before they'd demonstrated how immature they really were. Janet said Liberty was too young to be in love. Liberty said Janet had wanted to marry Brad back when she was Liberty's age. \n\n\nJanet said that was different, because she had been pregnant at the time, and she said it wouldn't have worked out if she had married Brad. Liberty asked how she could know that, and Janet said, \"Because it never does! Especially not for teenagers!\" Liberty said maybe she and Parker had something that Janet and Brad hadn't had, and she didn't think Janet should punish her for feeling the way she did. \n\n\nParker called Liberty and told her he had to meet with her. When Janet went to the kitchen to check on a customer's order, Liberty slipped out of the diner. Meanwhile, at Carly's, Carly told Jack that she felt that letting the situation end up in court would be a terrible mistake for their family. Jack said he was going to call Parker's bluff, and Carly said she could see that their \"united front\" only existed as long as she did what Jack wanted. \n\n\nParker and Liberty met at Brad and Katie's house, where Parker told Liberty that if they got married, they could be declared emancipated minors, which would give Parker access to his trust fund. Liberty couldn't believe what Parker was proposing, but he said it was the answer to all of their problems. Parker told Liberty he loved her and wanted them to spend the rest of their lives together. Their cell phones went off, as Jack tried to call Parker and Carly tried to reach Liberty. Parker told Liberty they didn't have to worry about their parents anymore. \n\n\nJanet arrived at Carly's house and told Carly and Jack that Liberty was missing. They told her about Parker's injunction. Jack left with Janet to go look for the kids, telling Carly to stay home in case Parker came back. After they left, Craig arrived at Carly's to tell her about an international marketing firm that thought Midnight Sun would do well in Europe. When he saw Carly's lack of interest in the topic, he asked her what was wrong. She told him about Parker and the injunction. Carly started to cry, saying that she loved Parker so much, but everything she did seemed to make him more miserable. Craig hugged her and told her everything would be all right. \n\n\nParker explained to Liberty how great things would be once they were married, saying they could each have a convertible, and Liberty could buy anything she wanted at the mall. Liberty thought that sounded pretty good, but then Jack and Janet burst into the house. Parker left with Jack. Janet said she couldn't understand why Liberty would want to throw her life away on Parker, and Liberty said she loved Parker. Janet shouted, \"No, you don't!\" but Liberty cried, \"Stop telling me how I feel, because you don't know!\" and she left the room in tears. \n\n\nJack took Parker back home and sent him up to his room. Jack lit into Carly about Craig being there, and Craig told Jack to calm down. Jack told Carly he wanted Craig out of there, but Carly said it was her house. Craig said he would leave, but Carly told him to stay. Tom rang the bell, and when he came in, he told Carly and Jack that Shink was a licensed attorney and would probably push Parker's case as far as he could. Tom's advice was for them all to sit down with Parker and try to work things out. Tom left, and Craig said he thought Tom was right, that they should try to work things out. \n\n\nJack got upset with Craig again, and he stormed out of the house. Carly apologized to Craig, but he told her he was sorry, because he knew they were all under a lot of strain. Craig assured Carly that Parker still loved her, and they would find their way through it. Carly asked about the business deal Craig had mentioned and apologized for being a lousy business partner recently. She said she had been overwhelmed, and Craig said he knew that, and even though he would hate to see it happen, he would understand if she wanted to pull out of their partnership. \n\n\nLucy went back to Craig's room, but on the second atempt she was successful in letting herself in. She started going through files on his desk, and she picked up the one on Midnight Sun. Just then, Craig returned and asked her what she was doing in his room. She said the maid had let her in and that she had wanted to give Craig the updated files on Johnny's medical history. Craig thanked her and then briefly told her about Carly's problems. Lucy offered her help with the business, and Craig thanked her but told her to just go be a brilliant doctor. He gave her a kiss, and she left, but not before she slipped the Midnight Sun folder into her large purse. \n\n\nJanet and Jack took Liberty back to the farm with them. Jack told Janet that he and Carly had never wanted Parker's trust fund to become a big deal to Parker, and he said Hal wouldn't have wanted that, either. Janet asked if Hal would have wanted Jack to send Parker to boarding school against his will, and Jack admitted that he didn't know. Janet suggested that Jack take Tom's advice and try to talk to Parker. \n\n\nParker called Liberty and told her he had found a state where they could get married without their parents' permission, and he thought they should leave as soon as possible. Liberty asked if Parker really wanted to get married, and he said he did. He asked her the same question, and she said, \"I do.\" After they said they loved each other, Parker said he had to hang up because his mom was coming. \n\n\nCarly knocked on Parker's door and asked him if he could try to chill out for just a few days without making any decisions that couldn't be undone. Parker said okay, and Carly thanked him and told him she loved him. She pulled his door closed and took a big sip from the wine glass she was carrying.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jack assures Carly that it is best for Parker to go to boarding school. She puts up a united front, but is really against it. When confronted, Parker hands them a preliminary injunction which prevents them from sending him anywhere. He's surly and taunts that a judge might see things differently than they do. They can't touch his trust fund money to do things not in his best interest. They show the papers to Tom Hughes. He will look into it, but he doesn't think Parker has a chance unless he can prove he is emancipated. Parker is listening and overhears this. Lucy tries to dodge Dusty and explains that she can not be seen with him. Craig's faith is renewed about her. Liberty smarts off to Janet about being in prison. When Janet turns her back at the diner, Liberty chases off to find Parker. He has the answer - they will get married. He makes it sound like pie in the sky. Both parents look for their children. Jack drags Parker back and threatens to nail the window shut if he has to. Having Craig there with Carly doesn't help Jack's mood. He won't listen to his advise how to raise his family. Dusty asks Meg out for a real date and then wants to buy some baby clothes at Fashions. He insists she buy herself a sexy dress. Tom gives Carly and Jack the bad news in that the lawyer can keep this tied up for quite a while and it will be long and expensive. Parker tells Liberty they need to leave soon before the parents miss them. They will find a state that will marry them. Carly checks in on Parker and asks him to give them all a chance to cool off. She's been drinking throughout the day and still has a glass of vodka in her hand behind her back.",
