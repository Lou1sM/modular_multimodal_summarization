He sees Rose and tries to leave, but Lily asks him to stay.  Rose tolerates him.  Lucinda stops by later with champagne to celebrate.  Paul goes down on one knee for a third time and asks Rose for her hand in marriage.  She accepts and as they kiss, Dusty slips outside and makes a phone call.  \"Hey.  It's me.  We got a big problem.\"\n\n\nCraig wakes up on the sofa as Rosanna is at the tea service holding a cup of coffee.  She asks him why he didn't come to bed.  Craig says he just fell asleep.  Rosanna is looking to spend some quality time with Craig, and hopes his attention won't soon be diverted by Aaron, or Lucy, or Alison, or Carly.  He asks her, \"What you're saying is that you miss me?  Why don't you just send me a card?\"  Rosanna smugly grabs a pillow and starts to beat Craig over the head with it.  Rosanna says she gave Carly a loan after all, but there were a couple stipulations.  Carly has to deliver her designs by April 15, and if Carly ever needs a shoulder to cry on, she shouldn't look to Craig for comfort.  She says, \"Consider this romantic methadone.\"  Craig carefully and quickly thinks her stipulations over and says, \"Maybe it's time to let Carly succeed or fail on her own.\"  The phone rings, and a Monte-Carlo representative tells Craig that Carly was rushed to the hospital the night before with pregnancy complications.  Craig tells Rosanna the news, and she picks up his coat with one finger and says, \"You'll be rushing right out?\"  Craig says he won't be going to the hospital, but \"You should.  She's your sister.\"  Rosanna does a one-eighty, and asks Craig to come along with her for moral support.\n\n\nBonnie gets to work early to begin inventory, and to try to clear her head about her mother's rape.  Isaac asks her if she's alright.  Ben stops by looking for Jessica.  Bonnie tells him she spent the night at Margo's house.  Ben wants to show his support, and leaves to go find Jessica.  Isaac encourages Bonnie to go with him, but she decides to stay behind.  Isaac wonders aloud if Jessica should consider dropping the charges because she's put Ben and Bonnie through so much drama already.  Why add to the fire?  Bonnie looks him in the eye and says, \"She was raped.\"  Isaac isn't sure what to believe and asks Bonnie if she is 100% certain Jessica is telling the truth.  Bonnie's eyes betray her true feelings, \"Only my mom and Marshall know for sure what happened.\"  Bonnie thinks Marshall actually loves Jessica based on what she read in his letter.  She gives it to Isaac to read, and after he's finished, he says, \"I think you showed me this letter because you want me to help you find the truth.\"  Isaac wants to show it to Ben, but Bonnie rips it from his hands, tears it in two, and throws it away.  After she leaves to visit her mother, Isaac retrieves the trashed letter.\n\n\nA police escort walks Jessica to her front door.  They offer to walk through the house to confirm that her home is secure, but she declines the offer.  She walks in, closes and locks the door.  She turns around and stares at the couch where the incident happened.  She moves around the couch to get a different view when she hears Marshall's deep voice say, \"Hello Jessica.\"  She turns around, scared out of her wits.  She tries to get to the door, but he blocks her way.  He tries to calm her down by telling her he's not there to hurt her, but to talk about what happened and what's going on.  She reaches for the phone to call the police, but Marshall grabs the phone and angrily says, \"No!  No cops until you and I sort things out first!\"  He backs her up, step by step, into a wall cabinet.  She fumbles for a drawer and finds the gun inside.  She grabs the gun and points it straight at his chest telling him to back up or, \"I'll shoot you!!  I swear to God I will!!\"  He backs away and heads for the door, but he stops and says, \"If I really did rape you, then I deserve your bullet.  Go ahead.  Finish the job.  Let me get a little closer so you get it right.\"  She has the gun pressed against his chest, but can't seem to pull the trigger.  Ben knocks at the door, and bursts in when Jessica screams his name.  Ben throws Marshall to the floor, and two cops rush into the room to arrest the intruder.  Ben and Jessica hug.  After Ben and Jessica are alone, he asks her why she couldn't tell him Marshall raped her.  She says she was ashamed.\n\n\nJack strokes Carly's hair until she wakes up.  When she regains enough of her consciousness, she bolts straight up and yells, \"The baby!  The baby!\"  Jack assures her everything is fine.  Dr. John walks in and tells her they want to keep her in the hospital for a couple of days of observation.  Next up on the visitation list is Mike.  When he walks in, Jack winces.  Carly makes an excuse to chat with Mike alone, and asks Jack to leave.  Jack looks directly at Mike and says, \"I'll be right back.\"  After Jack leaves, she looks at Mike and asks, \"We've been through this before.  Am I going to lose this baby too?\"  Mike counsels her to focus on staying calm for the sake of the baby's health.  Outside the room, Jack runs into Molly.  Molly asks about Carly, but Jack is skeptical of her sincerity, \"Wow.  It almost sounds like you care.\"  Molly walks into Carly's room as Mike is on his way out.  She also counsels Carly to just put all the drama out of her head and focus on staying calm until the baby is born.  They say their good-byes and Molly overhears John confirming to Mike and Jack that Carly is suffering from preeclampsia.  He scolds both men that it is imperative to keep her blood pressure low.  Jack tries to lay down the law with Mike about how Carly will receive her care from now on, and Molly breaks up the fight.  Rosanna is next up to see Carly.  Carly hears the curtain swish open and groggily thinks it's Jack.  Rosanna announces herself, \"It's just your sister.\"  It takes a moment for Carly to figure out what she thinks Rosanna is doing.  Her defenses light up, and she says, \"Here to check up on your investment?  Well...I don't think I'll be making that April fifteen deadline, so you can just sue me!\"  Rosanna only wanted to comfort Carly, yet, she is stunned by this outburst.  Just then, the heart monitor flat-lines, and Dr. John rushes in to assess the situation.  Carly is freaking out, and Craig comes in and asks Rosanna what she said to upset Carly.\n\n\n",
