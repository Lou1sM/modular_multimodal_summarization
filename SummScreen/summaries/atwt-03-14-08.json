Casey finally agreed and said he would let Alison know what he found out. \n\n\nAt the diner, Vienna worked while Gray tried to persuade her to return to the Lakeview with him. Matt appeared and gestured to Gray to come outside. Matt told Gray that Alison was suspicious of him and had already talked to Casey about him, so if Gray wanted his plan to work, they'd better move soon. Gray told Matt not to question his planning and suggested he discredit Alison and Casey. Gray said he had hired Matt to make his problems disappear. Gray went back into the diner, and when Matt turned around, he saw Casey, who said, \"We need to talk.\" \n\n\nMatt and Casey went to Java, where Casey told Matt that they both knew that Gray Girard was bad news. Matt asked what that had to do with him, and Casey said, \"That's what I'd like to know.\" Matt said he didn't know that much about Gray, but Gray paid him well. Casey asked if it was enough to make it worth possibly going back to prison. Matt said if it bothered Casey that much, he'd find Gray and tell him he would quit working for him. Matt left. \n\n\nCarly woke up in Jack's hospital room. When Jack awoke, he asked Carly if the DA had cleared Parker. Carly told him the DA was going ahead with Parker's trial unless they could provide solid evidence that Kit had killed Sam. Jack told Carly that if Kit really was in town the night Sam was killed, there must be evidence of it somewhere. Jack suggested they ask Katie and Brad to get Kit's picture on the air in case anyone had seen her in town on the night of Sam's murder. Carly agreed and left. \n\n\nCarly first went to Will and Gwen's house and told Gwen the DA's decision regarding Parker's trial. Gwen asked what she could do, and Carly asked if she could keep Sage all day. Gwen agreed, and Carly asked if she was sure she could handle the baby and Sage. Gwen then told Carly about having given Hallie back to Sofie. \n\n\nIn her room at the Lakeview, Katie woke up and saw Brad sleeping on the couch. When she walked by him, he pulled her down onto the couch with him. Brad suggested ordering room service breakfast for two, but Katie didn't think that was a good idea. Brad said he understood that nothing had changed between them, but he said they still needed to eat. Katie agreed that having breakfast together was something friends do. Henry came in and said he couldn't eat, because it was over for good between him and Vienna. Brad told Henry to let Vienna go, saying \"if you love something, set it free.\" \n\n\nKatie told Henry that was horrible advice, and she told Brad that if you loved someone, you fought for them. Brad asked how long you were supposed to fight when it was painfully clear they loved someone else. Henry could see that the conversation suddenly was no longer about him, and he left. After more arguing about love, Brad and Katie finally realized Henry was no longer there; Brad told Katie she had scared Henry away with all her talk about Jack. Katie became angry and reminded Brad that she and Brad were just coworkers and friends. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to the TV studio to prepare for the day's taping. Carly arrived and asked them to put Kit's picture on the air; they both agreed, saying they would do anything for Parker. \n\n\nParker used his free period at school to go to the hospital to visit Jack. He told Jack he had decided to plead guilty to the charges against him so he could \"make this whole thing be over.\" Parker didn't like that everyone in the family was being hurt by his situation, from Jack, who had almost been killed, to JJ, who was being picked on at school. Jack told Parker the worst thing that could happen to any of them was losing Parker. Carly called Jack and told him to turn on the TV; Parker and Jack watched as Brad and Katie broadcast Kit's picture. \n\n\nKatie, Brad, and Carly monitored the phone lines at WOAK. Brad wondered how Kit had managed to avoid being caught after she came back to town when the police were trying to keep her under surveillance. It occurred to Carly that perhaps Kit had worn a disguise, and she said that maybe Kit had been wearing a disguise the night she killed Sam. Carly left to tell Jack her theory. \n\n\nKatie paced, thinking about Parker. Brad told Katie it was clear she was thinking about Jack, too, and Katie admitted it. Brad then told Katie to forget about everything else and be with Jack. Brad pointed out that Jack hadn't dumped Katie the way Vienna had dumped Henry; Jack had believed Carly was dying when he walked away from Katie in the first place. Katie decided Brad was right, and she left to visit Jack. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Carly told Parker to get back to school; then she told Jack her theory about Kit having worn a disguise. Jack thought that was a good theory but wondered how they'd ever find someone who had seen the disguised Kit since they didn't know what kind of disguise she'd been wearing. Jack suggested following the trail of Cowboy Jack dummies, beginning with the one left in Carly's car at the shopping mall. Jack told Carly the mall would have surveillance video they could look at, and Carly said she'd take care of getting that. Jack protested that this had to be on the up-and-up, but Carly was on her way out the door before he could stop her. \n\n\nKatie walked in and apologized for having interrupted Jack and Carly, but she told Jack she had to see him. She told him that she had tried to stay away but simply couldn't do it. Katie told Jack that obviously, she still had feelings for him, although she knew he was committed to Carly. Jack told her he was in no way committed to Carly. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Carly went to the security office at the shopping mall. There, she made up a story for the security officer about having lost her wallet in the parking lot and said she had to get it back or her ex-husband would use it as a way to keep her kids away from her. The officer felt sorry for Carly and let her look at the security tape from the day she had been in the parking lot. \n\n\nHenry went to the diner to talk to Vienna, and Gray tried to run him off before he could speak to her. Vienna asked Henry what he wanted; Gray wouldn't leave them alone, so Henry proceeded to tell Vienna how much he loved her. He also said that he could see that wasn't enough, so he had come to tell Vienna that he just wanted her to be happy. Henry said, \"Goodbye,\" and kissed Vienna on the cheek. \n\n\nVienna told Henry he couldn't leave like this, but Henry said he couldn't bear to see her with someone else. He kissed her cheek again and left. Gray told Vienna they could go to London the following week and then to Paris, and that would make her feel better. Vienna said all she dreamed of was Henry, and Gray told her that would change. Vienna gently told Gray her feelings would never change, and Gray said he understood. He wished Vienna all the best and hugged her. \n\n\nMatt came into the diner and asked Gray if the coast was clear. Gray told him Vienna had gone and wasn't coming back. Matt said he was sorry, but Gray said, \"Don't be. Now I know what we have to do. It's time to put the plan into motion.\" Gray told Matt he wanted to move forward with his plan that very day and use Henry and Vienna as bait. \n\n\nSofie brought Hallie to work with her at the Lakeview, but Lisa told Sofie the baby couldn't be there. Sofie said she didn't have anyone who could watch Hallie. Hallie began to cry, and Lisa started to pick her up but noticed that she was very hot. Lisa told Sofie that Hallie had a high fever and needed to go to the hospital immediately. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Alison saw Sofie pacing in the hallway and asked her what was wrong. Sofie said Hallie was sick. The doctor came out of the examining room and told Sofie that although they had brought down Hallie's fever, she was severely anemic. The doctor said Hallie needed a blood transfusion, and she asked if Sofie was compatible. Sofie told her she was A positive, but the doctor said that wouldn't work and asked about the baby's father. Sofie told the doctor she didn't know where the father was, but the doctor said she needed to find him and bring him to the hospital ASAP. \n\n\nSofie called Cole and left him an urgent message. Alison told Sofie there might be another way, since Gwen and Cole were siblings. She suggested Sofie call Gwen to find out if she would be a match. Gwen and Will had taken Sage out shopping, when Sofie called Gwen and told her that Hallie was sick and needed her. When Gwen and Will arrived after dropping Sage off at the farm, Sofie and Alison filled them in on the situation, and Gwen went with Alison to be tested. \n\n\nWill watched Sofie pacing and asked her how she had let it get this bad with the baby. Sofie told Will the fever had only started that morning, and she hadn't realized it was something so serious. Will relented and told Sofie he wasn't blaming her, but he was worried, too. Will told Sofie that Gwen loved Hallie and would do anything for her, including breaking her own heart and his heart, too. Sofie told Will she felt that she should have been the one who could help Hallie, but she couldn't. She said she had even called Cole, and Will asked her what the hell was wrong with her. \n\n\nSofie angrily told Will that Hallie's well-being was more important than Cole's status with her or with Will and Gwen, because the important thing right now was biology. Gwen came back and told them that she was a match. Sofie asked if Gwen wanted to see Hallie before donating blood to her, and Gwen said she did, so Sofie took Gwen and Will into Hallie's room. Will spotted Alison and thanked her for getting Sofie to call them in the first place. After Gwen gave blood for the transfusion, Will pointed out that she was now a part of Hallie. Gwen said Hallie was lucky to have so many people who loved her. At that moment, Cole walked up and said he hoped he wasn't too late. \n\n\nCasey found Alison at the hospital and told her that Matt was lying to them. Alison took a break, and she and Casey went to Java. Casey thought they should drop the issue, but Alison disagreed. When Casey asked what they could do, Alison said she could start using the fact that Matt liked her to her advantage.\n\n\n\n\n",
