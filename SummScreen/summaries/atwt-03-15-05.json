    "soap_central": "\n\nCelia is mortified because Rafi has insisted on taking her to school.  To make matters worse, not only has he told her what to wear, he also tells her that he will be waiting for her after school.  As soon as he leaves, Celia takes her backpack to the girls' room and changes her clothes.  Two snobby girls walk in and make fun of Celia and her clothes.  Later, Celia, Will and Casey meet in the hallway -- and Celia is devastated to find that her backpack is missing.  She is sure that Rafael will be furious.  But Rafael has some problems of his own.... He was scheduled to open the Metro that morning, but since he chose to take Celia to school, he was two hours late to work.  This is finally the last straw for Aaron, who fires him on the spot.\n\n\nJennifer has gone to see Paul at Fairwinds.  He tells her he is worried about her because Barbara told him that she plans to destroy Street Jeans so that she can get the glory when she builds it up again.  Paul tells Jennifer to get away from Barbara and Craig.  Jennifer defends Craig and insists that she can handle her business life -- it's her personal life that she has destroyed.  Paul insists that Jennifer must tell Mike whatever it is that she is afraid he will not understand, or she may lose Mike.\n\n\nCarly takes JJ to Jack at the police station.  Carly has had a rough morning trying to get him ready for Julia's funeral.  Jack tells JJ to go look for a present, and then asks Carly to join him at the service.  She tells Jack that, because JJ hates her, she doubts it will be a comfort to JJ for her to go.  Jack also admits to Carly that he wants JJ to come and live with them.  Carly is a little shocked and tells him they should talk about it later, after the funeral.  She changes her mind and agrees to go to the service when she figures out that it is really Jack that needs her there, not JJ.  But Keith overhears her tell Jack that she will go, and tells her that she is the last person that should be there.  Jack tells Keith that he can go to the service if he would like, but Keith informs Jack that he would rather sit in his jail cell and pray by himself.  And he adds that, if Jack knew what was good for him, that he should pray for his own miserable soul because Jack is the reason Julia is dead.\n\n\nLuke has been \"summoned\" by Lucinda, who confronts him with the glove she found among the ashes in the fireplace.  She asks Luke to explain.  He denies knowing anything about it, but Lucinda knows better.  She told Luke that she didn't believe him and that she would find out what was going on.  If Luke knows his grandmother at all, he knows she isn't kidding!\n\n\nHolden and Lily talk about Luke and about Julia's funeral.  Lily offers to go with him, and at first he doesn't think it is a good idea.  But Lily insisted that he should be alone and he agrees.  Just as Holden opens the door to leave, he finds Lucinda on the doorstep.  He asks her how her talk with Luke went -- she replied that it did not go well.  When he leaves, Lucinda confronts Lily with what is left of the glove she found in her fireplace.\n\n\nJulia's funeral is a somber -- and poorly attended -- affair.  Tom, Lisa, Lily, Holden, Jack and Carly watch as JJ gets up and goes to his mother's casket.  He tells the photo of his mother that he misses her.  When the preacher asks if anyone wants to say anything, Jack declines, but Holden stands up.  Lily is horrified, but composed.  Holden begins to say some nice things about Julia - that she was always there for people, that she appreciated even the smallest gesture (comments with which not everyone in the group agrees!).  His eulogy is cut short when Luke barges into the room and screams: \"That's garbage!  She ruined my life and she deserved to die!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "When Lily finds out from Luke that another print was found at Julia's, she realizes that she must confess to Julia's murder. Luke and Carly try to convince her otherwise, but Lily refuses to back down. Carly talks Lily into allowing her to come along but she won't allow Luke to meet them at the station.",
