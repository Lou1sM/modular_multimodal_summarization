He joked with Noah that he was such a loser that he worked with his mother. He chuckled about how angry his involvement in gay rights would make Damian Grimaldi, his birth father. The boys reviewed how badly their time together in Noah's dorm room had gone the night before. Noah's roommate had walked in on them, but Noah told Luke he had the solution to their problem. He suggested that Luke move in with him for the summer. Luke was ecstatic, and the two agreed to live together and see how it went. \n\n\nMr. Reese, a man who had an apartment for rent, interrupted the boys. Noah had done some scouting and had found a suitable place for them to live. Reese saw that there were two of them and remarked that the apartment had only one bedroom, but Luke said that was all they needed. Noah showed Luke the paperwork he had already filled out, and they told Mr. Reese they were ready to come up with the appropriate deposit. Reese, however, suddenly said the apartment had already been rented, and he wished the boys better luck next time and walked out. Noah could not believe what had happened. \n\n\nPaul played with the giant giraffe he had bought for his baby and urged little Eliza to go to sleep. Emily walked in and admired the baby. Paul told her he had the baby for the day because Meg wanted to spend time with Dusty. Paul vowed he would do everything he could to keep Dusty away from Meg. He thought Lucy was the key to that. \n\n\nPaul wanted Emily to tail Lucy and keep an eye on the girl. He was suspicious that Lucy had sided with Craig against Dusty, in public, and then Emily had caught her breaking into her father's room. Emily turned him down, so Paul suggested she contact Craig and nose around his new vodka business. He said if Lucy was helping Dusty sandbag Craig, he didn't want the fallout to hurt Meg. \n\n\nEmily thought the designer vodka business was not an exciting enough topic for her scandal sheet, but Paul argued that if Craig was involved, there had to be some shady dealing. Additionally, it looked as if Craig was teaming up with his estranged daughter, and that had to be interesting. Emily finally agreed to dig up any dirt she could find, but she said she knew she would regret it. \n\n\nLucy went to Craig's hotel room after her shift at the hospital and found her father in a panic. He had torn the room apart trying to find his file with the international shipping contract for Midnight Sun vodka. He was hoping Lucy could tell him something, since she and Johnny were the only ones who came into his room. Lucy flashed back on her stealing the file from his room, but she denied any knowledge of the contracts. Craig said he thought Lucy might be intrigued by his vodka business and asked if she was trying to involve herself in it. \n\n\nLucy reminded him that she was not yet on a full rotation at Memorial, so she did have some extra time. She also said she probably had more time to spare than Carly, who was involved in Parker's troubles. Craig took a call while Lucy removed the missing file from her briefcase and pretended she had just found it under the couch. She asked for a reward of lunch, and Craig agreed. \n\n\nMeg tidied up the kitchen at the farm and told Dusty she was allowing Paul to watch the baby while they went on their date. Dusty said he was taking Meg to the opening of chef Bruno Ferrari's new restaurant in Chicago that evening, and Meg was thrilled. Dusty left for his office, saying he would pick her up later. She promised to wear the dress he had bought her at Fashions and to look beautiful. They shared a brief kiss, as Holden walked in. Dusty left, and Holden asked Meg if she was completely out of her mind. \n\n\nHolden questioned Dusty's buying his sister a new dress, plus the piles of baby clothes for Eliza in Emma's front parlor. He assumed there were strings attached to those gifts, but Meg explained that Dusty missed his son and wanted to do something nice for a youngster. Meg was irritated with Holden for his criticism, and she yelled at him for being so down on Dusty because he had slept with Lily. Holden reminded Meg that Dusty had left other casualties in their extended family, namely Rose and Emily. He was concerned for Meg because she had switched so quickly from Paul to Dusty, with hardly a breath in between. He urged his sister to be careful for her baby's sake. \n\n\nAt the Worldwide offices, Dusty ordered two dozen white long stemmed roses for Meg. Lily arrived and overheard the order. She asked who the lucky recipient was, and Dusty told her it was Meg. Lily cautioned him that part of his attraction to Meg might be Eliza. Dusty claimed he and Meg were going into a relationship with their eyes wide open. Dusty received a call from Meg, who cancelled their date. She said she needed more time, and when Dusty relayed that to Lily, Lily suggested that Dusty take the baby out of the equation and concentrate on how he felt about just Meg. She also reminded him that sometimes people were better friends than lovers. \n\n\nLucy spoke to someone on the phone and said she had successfully replaced her father's shipping file after making copies of all the documents they would need. She promised she would go right away to the shipping contact and make their arrangements. When Craig arrived, Lucy said she had to return briefly to the hospital to check on a patient, and he promised to wait for her for lunch. \n\n\nEmily spied Craig sitting alone in the Lakeview lounge. She asked to speak with him and promised a big payoff. She said she had a business proposition for him, but Craig told her to keep her muckraking nose out of his affairs. Emily promised to keep the story clean and legitimate, and then she asked if Lucy might be part of Craig's new business venture. Craig said Lucy was a physician, and she would not be interested in the booze business. Emily asked, off the record, why Craig had forgiven his daughter for kidnapping Johnny. She referred to kidnapping as \"the Montgomery family business, the gift that keeps on giving.\" Craig was not amused. \n\n\nEmily suggested that Craig did not trust Lucy, just as the girl walked in and confronted her. Emily asked how much vodka Craig would be exporting, but Lucy spoke up and said her father should not divulge his business plan to a gossip reporter. Craig agreed, and issued a terse, \"no comment.\" \n\n\nMeg went to Fairwinds and saw how comfortably her baby was sleeping in her bassinet. She told Paul her plans had changed, but she cautioned him not to gloat. Paul hoped there was still a possibility for him and Meg, but she discouraged that scenario. Meg said Eliza could spend the rest of the day with her father, and asked him to bring her to the farm by dinnertime. \n\n\nLucy met with the shipping agent on the docks and asked if there was room on the ship for other cargo. The agent said he could accommodate any other shipment she wished to load, and it would not show on the bill of lading. Lucy paid him an envelope full of money for the extra deal. \n\n\nLuke looked up the landlord laws on his laptop and declared that what Mr. Reese had done was illegal. Noah was worried that they could not prove his offense, when their friend, Tyler, overheard and offered the information that Reese was a notorious homophobe with a history of not renting to gays and lesbians. Tyler gave them the card of a real estate broker who was friendlier to gays. Noah wanted to move on, but Luke was determined to do something about Reese. \n\n\nLily told Holden that Meg had cancelled her date with Dusty. She said she had told Dusty to do some soul-searching about his feelings for Meg. Holden got upset at that, and Lily got irritated that her affair with Dusty still rankled Holden. She countered by saying her husband's fling with Carly still angered her. \n\n\nNoah accompanied Luke home and the couple announced their plans to live together. Luke said they had found a place, but they had hit a roadblock. They explained about the homophobic landlord, but said they had no way to prove his actions. Lily suggested that Luke's foundation take on the landlord and others like him as a project, and mentioned her own position with the foundation. \n\n\nHolden was stunned, because no one had told him that Lily had taken a position with the foundation. Lily apologized for not telling Holden sooner. Luke and Noah offered to begin doing research, and they left. Holden was hurt that he was the last to know that Lily was heading up the foundation. They talked it out and hugged, and both were pleased that Luke seemed to have found a focus in his life and had snapped out of his funk. \n\n\nEmily went back to Fairwinds and told Paul she agreed with him that Lucy Montgomery was up to something. She was excited about what she suspected, but Paul was juggling some baby toys and seemed uninterested. He finally told Emily to drop the whole thing. He said the future was looking up because Meg had dumped Dusty, and he was looking forward to being part of a family again. Emily said she was convinced there was a story around Craig, and no one was going to keep her from writing it. She dashed out, and Paul went back to fantasizing about his family. \n\n\nMeg went to Fashions to return the clothes that Dusty had bought for her. Dusty entered right behind Meg and questioned her actions. Meg said she didn't feel right keeping the clothes, and suddenly Dusty grabbed her and kissed her. \n\n\nLuke was amazed at how many states sill had no laws banning discrimination against gays and lesbians in housing and employment. He suggested he continue doing research while Noah found them an apartment. \n\n\nLucy and Craig had lunch, and she told him she cared about him a great deal. She left for work, and Craig muttered that he wished he could believe her. \n\n\nLucy called someone and said her father had no clue what was going on. She did mention, however, that Emily Stewart might be a problem, but she promised to find a way to deal with Emily.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Noah asks Luke to move in with him for the summer. Noah and Luke meet with their potential landlord, but it is clear once he realizes they are gay, the apartment no longer becomes available. They are outraged, as Luke vows to not let the man get away with it. Dusty is taking Meg on their official date to a new restaurant in Chicago, as Meg is thrilled and Dusty wants her to wear the new dress he bought her. Holden and Meg argue about her relationship with Dusty, as he thinks she should take time after her break up with Paul before jumping into another bad relationship. Paul is happily babysitting for Eliza since Meg has plans with Dusty he begrudgingly admits, as he pleads with Emily to find out what is going on between Lucy and Craig; he wants to protect Meg because he is convinced Lucy and Dusty are working together to bring down Craig and Meg could get hurt. Craig misplaces his file (or so he thinks) for the shipping company he plans on doing business with, as Craig wonders if Lucy knows where it is. Lucy pretends to help and when his head is turned, she takes it out from her purse. She plays it off well, as Lucy later talks to someone about making copies from the file and meeting with someone from the shipping company. Meg cancels her plans with Dusty thinking she is rushing things, as Dusty is upset. Lily talks with Dusty about Meg and poses some questions for him to consider. Meg sees Paul lovingly talking to Eliza, as she arrives to pick her up. Paul is pleased to learn Meg is no longer going out with Dusty. He is tickled to learn nothing has gone on and it doesn't look like it will be either, but Meg assures him that changes nothing about them. Meg allows Paul to spend extra time with Eliza, as Paul warmly thanks her. Emily tries to get information out of Craig pretending to be interested in his vodka company, but Craig isn't really biting. Lucy meets with a man from the shipping company that is now working for Craig and pays him to ship some stuff in addition to what Craig ships without anyone's knowledge. The man thanks her and their mutual friend for their business. When Lucy comes back to play the dutiful daughter, she puts the kibosh on anymore questions from Emily to her dad, as Craig follows her leads, which convinces Emily more then ever, that Lucy is hiding something. Holden worries about Meg, but Lily tells him that Meg cancelled her plans with Dusty. Holden is later not pleased to hear Lily offer Dusty advice about Meg, as they agree in the end to no longer get involved. Luke and Noah tell Holden and Lily about the landlord, as Lily thinks they should get this issue out there with help from the Foundation. Holden is surprised to learn Lily is working with Luke, but is happy because Luke seems himself again finally. Luke and Noah blissfully work together to research how to stop discrimination against gays in housing and to find a new place to live. Emily comes to Paul with her beliefs about Lucy, but Paul is no longer interested because he is focused on the fact that Meg is not seeing Dusty anymore. Emily tells him that she won't back down from this story because Paul is seeing stars in his eyes now. Dusty sees Meg returning his clothes that he bought her, as she explains that their relationship is moving too fast and that she isn't sure what is happening between then is even real, as Dusty takes her into his arms and passionately kisses her to prove her wrong. Lucy wants Craig to stay away from Emily's questions for his own good, as she wants to prove her loyalty and trust \u0096according to her. After she leaves, Craig mumbles to himself about how he wishes he could trust her, as he looks unsure. Lucy makes a phone call assuring the person on the other end that her dad has no idea what she is up to, but Emily could prove to be a problem, but she will handle her.",
