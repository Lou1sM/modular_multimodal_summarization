Cole explained that he had received a call from Sofie and was there to make sure Hallie was all right. He claimed that he had changed and wanted to prove he could be a responsible part of Hallie's life. Gwen refused to believe her brother had changed, but he said he just wanted to stay until he learned if Hallie would be okay. Moments later, Hallie's doctor arrived and told everyone that the transfusion from Gwen had worked and Hallie would be just fine. Cole was surprised when he heard the doctor refer to Sofie as Hallie's mother, and he questioned the group about what was going on with Hallie's adoption. Sofie explained that Gwen had returned Hallie to Sofie and Cole seemed enthusiastic to have a second chance with Sofie and Hallie. Gwen immediately began to chastise her brother and refused to believe he could be anything but the selfish individual she had always known. Sofie thanked Gwen for her help with Hallie, but told her she needed to handle the situation with Cole on her own. Gwen and Will left to talk to Bob, but promised to find Sofie later and check in with her. \n\n\nOnce Will and Gwen left, Sofie told Cole that she didn't want to talk to him and wanted nothing more to do with him. She asked Cole to leave and he agreed to go after remarking that he only wanted another opportunity to prove he could be a good father. In the hall, Cole immediately got on the phone and told someone that he was in Oakdale and \"it might be tough\" but he could \"pull it off.\" When Sofie went to check on Hallie, she learned that \"her husband\" had picked up Hallie to bring her to Sofie. Fearing that Cole was the one who picked up Hallie, Sofie began to cry. The nurse tried to reassure Sofie that the baby was fine, but Sofie told her to call security because she was sure that Cole had kidnapped Hallie. Sofie explained everything to security and they set out to find Cole. \n\n\nAs Will and Gwen returned from their talk with Bob, they saw Cole carrying Hallie through the hospital stairwell and chased after him. The two trapped Cole on the stairs and he threatened to drop Hallie unless they let him leave. Gwen ran to get security as Will stood between Cole and the exit. When Gwen returned with security, Cole knew he was trapped and threw the baby at Will, distracting everyone long enough so he could escape. Will safely caught Hallie. \n\n\nGwen and Will returned Hallie to Sofie and she thanked them for rescuing the baby. A nurse took Hallie for an exam as security arrived and told Sofie that Cole had escaped, but they had notified the police, who would continue the search. Sofie was nervous that Cole was still out there, but Gwen and Will tried to reassure her that she and Hallie would be all right. Sofie admitted to Gwen and Will that she loved Hallie, but wasn't ready to care for a baby. She left Will and Gwen in the exam room. \n\n\nBarbara agreed to meet Kim at the Lakeview under the guise of a friendly chat, but when Kim arrived, Barbara told her that she had been diagnosed with oral cancer. Kim was upset that Barbara hadn't told her earlier and sad that she hadn't been there when Barbara needed her. Kim told her that she would be there for her from that point on and would help her through her treatments. Kim encouraged Barbara to focus on getting well and let the kids worry about their own lives for a while. \n\n\nVienna arrived at the diner to say goodbye to Gray and return his diamonds, but Gray didn't want to give up on his relationship with her. She convinced him that she was meant to be with Henry, and Gray finally seemed to accept her decision. When Vienna told Gray she was concerned that Henry wouldn't take her back, Gray ominously told her that he would make sure she and Henry were together forever. Vienna wondered how Gray could help with Henry and he simply asked Vienna to trust him. When she retuned from freshening up, Gray told her he had just talked to Henry and convinced him to meet Vienna at the church at Luther's Corner. She thought it was a good sign that Henry was willing to see her and left to meet him. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview bar, Brad and Henry drowned their sorrows together by drinking the afternoon away. Just as Henry finished a speech about not needing women, he received a note from the front desk telling him to meet Vienna at the local church. Henry immediately ditched Brad and ran to Vienna. \n\n\nAt Java, Matt found Alison on a break from the hospital and hoped to sit with her and talk about their relationship. When Matt sat down, Alison began her new plan to find out what Matt was up to in Oakdale by telling him she was ready to let her guard down and start a relationship with him. Matt was happy that Alison now seemingly trusted him, but he was curious about why she had suddenly changed her mind about dating him. When Alison said she was ready to trust her instincts and see where their relationship could lead, Matt was stunned, but pleased. Still he knew he had to make sure Alison was off Gray's trail. In truth, Matt had come to Java to drug Alison and get her out of the way. Just as Matt was ready to put something in Alison's coffee, he changed his mind and put the drug away. He got a call from Gray, who told him to get started on the plan and make sure everything went as planned. When Alison returned to the table, Matt told Alison that he wanted to come clean about who he really was and what was going on with Gray. Matt explained to Alison that he worked for Gray and that Gray was bad news. He told her to warn Casey, Margo, and Tom that Gray was after them and that he had to go and meet Gray, but wanted to make sure that she thanked the Hugheses for all they had done for him. Matt rushed out of Java, leaving Alison to wonder what Gray had planned. \n\n\nOutside the church, an overjoyed Henry saw Vienna and the two began to kiss. Gray had managed to get to the church and watched as Vienna and Henry reconciled. Henry and Vienna went into the church and he told Vienna he wanted to be with her forever. Vienna asked Henry to exchange vows with her in a sacred place to confirm their love. An emotional Vienna and Henry promised one another to stay together throughout their lives. Outside Gray doused the church with gasoline and prepared to set the building on fire. Henry and Vienna decided to head home and celebrate their reunion, but found themselves locked inside. They decided to make the best of being locked up together and kissed while they waited for someone to return and let them out. Matt arrived and Gray gave him matches and told him he knew what to do. Gray left to set up an alibi and Matt decided not to set the fire and called Margo. \n\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to prove that Kit had been in Oakdale the night Sam was shot, Carly sat at the local mall watching tapes of the parking lot and hoped to catch a glimpse of Kit in disguise. Just as Carly was ready to give up, she saw Kit masquerading as a homeless woman and got the mall security to print out a photo of Kit for her. \n\n\nKatie sat with Jack in his hospital room and after she confessed that she still cared for him, he explained that he would do anything to save Parker, but wasn't looking to return to his marriage with Carly ,and hoped he would have another chance with Katie. Jack refused to promise Katie that they would be back together, but he did assure her he wanted to try again. Just as Jack and Katie hugged, Carly arrived with news that she found proof of Kit's disguise. Jack thought they had finally caught a break and asked Carly to go with Katie and get the new picture of Kit out over the air. \n\n\nWhile Jack and Carly talked over their plan, Katie phoned Brad and asked him to meet her at the television station. Brad met Katie at the station and she knew he was drunk. Brad remarked his drinking was no longer her concern and that he was just there to do his job. Once they made the announcement showing the new picture of Kit, the phones started ringing and Carly learned that a bus driver had picked up Kit the night of Sam's murder, proving she was in Oakdale. Carly rushed out to give Jack the good news. Brad commented that he thought Katie would also want to be with Jack, but she explained it wouldn't have been appropriate. Brad questioned Katie about her future with Jack and she told Brad that she and Jack had both admitted they still cared for one another and were going to try again after Parker was cleared of Sam's murder. An obviously disappointed Brad told Katie that it was good to know where everyone stood and he would be returning to his bottle at the Lakeview bar. Katie stopped Brad and told him she was sorry for hurting him. Brad said he was done waiting for her and was returning to the bar alone. \n\n\nKatie returned to the studio and felt bad for hurting Brad. She called Henry for some support and left him a message that she hoped he was well and that she needed to talk. \n\n\nBrad called Bonnie and told her that he wanted to meet for a drink, and was free of Katie and ready to start a new relationship with her. \n\n\nCarly went to Jack at the hospital and told him about the latest lead in Parker's case. Jack was encouraged, but told Carly they still had to figure out where Kit got the disguise. Carly thought Kit's costume must have come from the scenic shop in Chicago and she was determined to go back, but Jack told her it was too dangerous and she couldn't go alone. When a nurse came in to check Jack, Carly took the opportunity to leave the room. She left a note for Jack with a nurse and ran out, presumably to Chicago. \n\n\nAfter Jack's exam the nurse gave him the note from Carly that explained to him that she had gone to Chicago. He phoned Carly and left her a message to call him, but Carly was unwavering in her search to find out where Kit had assembled her disguise and she went into the warehouse alone.\n\n\n",
