    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt Deerbrook Sanitarium, Meg declined a trip into town because she felt she was not ready to face certain people or circumstances.  Her counselor assured her that it was all part of the healing process, and she urged Meg to try to handle a visit to Oakdale.  Meg reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nEmily and Paul strolled baby Eliza through Old Town, and they paused at Fashions.  Emily suggested that they buy the baby an Easter dress, so Paul told her to do it while he picked up some books at the bookstore.  Emily went into Fashions and began looking at outfits until Paul joined her. Because it was such a nice day, Emily suggested a picnic, so she went to the diner to order some sandwiches, while Paul settled the bill at Fashions.  Outside Al's, Emily was surprised to bump into Meg.\n\n\nEmily began a tirade against Meg; Emily yelled that Meg should not have escaped again and that she had to return to Deerbrook.  Meg was flustered and denied doing anything wrong.  She explained that she was on a \"group outing\" with some other Deerbrook residents, and she pointed out their group leader.  Emily apologized, and Meg asked about Eliza.  Just then, Paul wheeled Eliza's stroller to the diner, and he took out the baby and handed her to Meg.  Meg held her daughter, as Emily looked crushed and went in to order the food.  Paul offered to get Meg coffee, and he left her holding Eliza.\n\n\nPaul changed his mind and returned to take Meg and Eliza to Java.  He encouraged his ex-wife to keep getting therapy and to continue getting stronger.  The group leader called Meg, so she said goodbye to the baby and thanked Paul.\n\n\nPaul and Emily went home to Fairwinds, but Emily seemed depressed.  She said that it was important that Eliza and Meg keep their bond, but Emily pointed out that, for all practical purposes, she was Eliza's mother.  Paul thought for a moment and then said that his job was to protect his daughter from too deep an attachment to Emily.  Emily was shocked at that and asked him to explain what he meant.  Paul said he just wanted Eliza to know that Meg was her mother.  Emily asked for Paul's trust and support, and he kissed her.\n\n\nIn the Lakeview lobby, the stranger who had accosted Reid Oliver continued to harass him.  Luke stopped to watch the action, and he was shocked to hear the man refer to Oliver as \"a murderer.\"  The man also called him \"a smug bastard,\" and claimed that the doctor had killed his daughter.  Luke attempted to intervene, but Reid stopped him, and the stranger knocked Oliver down with one punch.  He continued to pummel the doctor, but Oliver did not fight back or defend himself verbally.  Luke tackled the assailant, who then backed off and said that he thought beating up the doctor would make him feel better, but it didn't.  The man cried that beating up Reid did not bring back his \"Annie.\"\n\n\nThe stranger walked away, as Reid struggled to his feet.  He staggered off, but Luke ran after him.  He caught up and asked Oliver what had just happened, but Reid said, \"None of your business.\"  Luke said that because he was responsible for the doctor's being in Oakdale, he felt it was his business.  Reid said he was in no trouble, and the man was a grieving father of a little girl who had died.  He then declared that he did not discuss his patients with outsiders.  He told Luke to \"Get lost,\" but Luke shouted that Oliver had a real problem answering to people and got very defensive when his back was to a wall.  Oliver said his back was not to a wall; it was to Luke, and he walked away.\n\n\nAt Memorial, a nurse noticed abrasions on Dr. Oliver's face, and she asked him if he was all right.  Reid insulted her and told her to pretend to do her job somewhere else.  Then the doctor left the hospital and drove to Lily's house to see Luke.  Luke was by himself, and when he answered the door, he asked Oliver what he was doing there.  Reid walked in and asked Luke to forget what he had seen that day at the Lakeview.  Luke answered that, in the vein of Dr. Oliver's sick humor, that Noah was the \"blind guy\" in the group, not he.  Oliver said that Luke should keep what he witnessed to himself, because false accusations could reflect poorly on the hospital.\n\n\nLuke said he would keep his mouth shut on one condition: Reid had to tell him the truth about what had happened to the angry man's daughter.  Oliver said the girl was six years old, and she had a terminal brain tumor.  He had operated on her and given her another year of life before she had succumbed.  Luke couldn't understand why the man had been so violent, or why Oliver had not defended himself.  The doctor explained that the guy would not have heard anything he said, and he did not want to jeopardize the hands he used to operate by defending himself physically.  Luke said he thought that Oliver felt he had failed, and he couldn't handle it; but that was what made him such a great doctor.\n\n\nReid Oliver agreed that he was a great physician and said that humility was overrated.  He also mentioned that he promised not to kill Luke's boyfriend when he cracked his skull open for surgery.  Luke said that Noah was no longer his boyfriend, and Reid said that he wasn't surprised because Luke's guilt overwhelmed Noah.  Luke took offense to that, and he declared that the breakup was his decision, and he shoved Dr. Oliver backwards towards the door.  Reid got right in Luke's face and declared that he had been pushed around enough for one day, and he advised \"Mr. Snyder\" to take one very large step back.  Luke did, and Reid turned and walked out.\n\n\nEarlier in the day, Lily told her mother that she was going to get Holden from jail, since all the charges had been dropped.  Lucinda was happy to stay with the children, and she looked forward to a celebration with cake afterwards.  Lucinda was especially excited that Holden was returning home, but Lily reminded her that Holden was no longer her husband.  Lily left for the police station, and Lucinda talked to the kids about how wonderful it was to all be back together.  \n\n\nFaith, however, threw a damper on the celebration by asking who had said anything about her parents getting back together.  Lucinda sent the younger children on an errand to find balloons in their room, and she asked Faith why she was so gloomy.  The girl said they both knew the family would never be the same again.  Lucinda lectured Faith about giving her mother the respect she was due, but the teenager said she was afraid her mother didn't love her father anymore.\n\n\nLily arrived at the police station but was shocked to learn that another woman had picked up Holden already.  She hurried to the farm, where she walked in on a big smooch between Holden and Molly.  Holden had just invited Molly to move back in with him at the farm, and Molly had agreed.  Lily apologized for interrupting, and asked if Holden was ready to go to her house to see the kids.  Holden looked at Molly and said, \"I'm ready if you are,\" but Molly glanced at a scowling Lily and said she would join them later.\n\n\nHolden and Lily arrived at Lily's home, and the children and Lucinda greeted them.  Faith, still in a funk, said she didn't think they could pretend that everything would go back to the way it was.  Natalie asked her father if he was going to live with them again, but Holden said he was going to stay at the farm.  Lily asked Faith what was bothering her, but the girl refused to say.  Lucinda spoke up and said that Faith was \"conflicted\" about going back to boarding school, so Holden questioned his daughter.   Faith said that she did not even want to finish the final semester there, and she claimed she just didn't \"fit in.\"  The girl begged to stay home.\n\n\nMolly took a call at the farm from Miss Gibson at Faith's former school, and she learned of the girl's suspension for smoking pot.  Molly left immediately for Lily's house and rang the doorbell.  Holden let her in, as Lucinda let loose some stinging verbal barbs Molly's way.  Holden told Lucinda that he was with Molly, and he asked his former mother-in-law to \"ease up.\"  \n\n\nNatalie announced it was time for cake, and Molly snagged Faith aside and told her about the headmistress' call.  Faith tried to make excuses, and Molly realized that the suspension was what Damian had used to manipulate the girl.  Molly said she was Faith's friend, and she promised not to tell Faith's parents if Faith would tell them herself.  It was Faith's call.\n\n\nWhen Holden and Lily and the others joined Molly and Faith, Molly asked the girl if she had anything to tell her parents.  Faith thought fast and said that Holden and Lily were right; she would finish the year at the boarding school.  Molly turned away in disgust, as Holden hugged his daughter.  Faith said she wanted to go right back to school that afternoon, and Holden offered to drive her.  Lucinda butted in and suggested that Lily and Holden together take Faith to school, as Molly whispered to Faith to ask what the girl was doing.  Faith promised that she would tell her folks the truth on the way to school, but she couldn't do it in front of everyone else.  Holden and Lily left with Faith, but Molly was concerned.\n\n\nThey arrived at the school and got out of the car.  Faith told her parents she had something to tell them.  She said she needed to apologize for messing up badly with Damian, and then she tried to talk about school, but Lily interrupted and urged the girl to give the school \"a few more months.\"  Holden and Lilly hugged Faith and said again how proud they were of her.  Holden wanted to check in with Miss Gibson, but Faith lied and put him off.  They said goodbye, and Lily and Holden drove away.  Lily said she hoped they were doing the right thing by returning Faith to school.\n\n\nLucinda felt the need to meddle, so she took the younger children to the farm and let them play in the barn with the horses.  Then she called on Molly because she had something to say.  Molly knew exactly what Lucinda's rhetoric would be; she paraphrased it well, so Lucinda only had to ask her how fast she could pack and get out of Holden's life.  Lucinda even offered to close her eyes and write a whopping big check, but Molly said, \"Save your zeroes, old lady.\"  Lucinda was horrified that Holden had asked Molly to move back to the farm, and reminded her that Holden's heart would always belong to Lily.  Molly mentioned that the farm belonged to the Snyders, and therefore she could ask Lucinda to get out.\n\n\nHolden and Lily stopped for coffee at Java, and Holden suggested that they focus on the future and consider Damian's invasion into their lives a bad detour.  Lily was concerned about Faith, but Holden was sure the girl would be fine.  He got a text from Molly asking how they had taken the news about Faith, so they took off in a rush for the farm.  They found Molly there, and they asked what she was referring to.  Molly said she should have known that Faith wouldn't tell them that she had been suspended from school for drugs.  Molly asked if Holden had spoken with Miss Gibson, and she explained that the woman had called earlier.  Molly said she had spoken to Faith about it, and the girl had promised that she would tell her folks.  Holden was upset with Molly, and he promised Lily they would find their daughter.\n\n\nBack at Deerbrook, Meg told her counselor that going to town had been a good idea.  She asked if she could have a chance to spend more time with her daughter, perhaps with an overnight visit.\n\n\n",
