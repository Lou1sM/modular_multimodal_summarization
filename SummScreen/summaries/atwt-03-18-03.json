    "tvmega_recap": "Bonnie tried to encourage Jess not to go ahead with the trial due to her and Marshall's past scandal. Due to Jess's past lie Bonnie didn't believe Jessica was raped. Isaac doubts the truth of the rape. He confronted Ben with the letter that Marshall wrote for Jess. Ben almost punched Isaac. While in the examining room, Marshall asked John for his advice. John suggested that he fight for the truth. Jack slipped & said, \"Our baby\" when he was warning Carly to take it easy. Jack urged Carly not to work due to the amount of stress it may produce. Carly called Craig & told him that she wanted to work on the fall line. Contrary to popular belief, Dusty doesn't have a dime to his name. So, he has made a deal with the She-Devil, Barbara to break up Paul & Rose. Babs will pay him double to get her into bed.",
