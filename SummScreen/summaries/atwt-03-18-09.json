Janet was also upset, but Jack stuck to his theory that the teens wanted to be treated like adults, so the adults should let them act accordingly. Carly said she was going to find the kids, but Jack forbade her to go after them. He also accused her of being a witness to the marriage instead of doing what she could to stop it. \n\n\nCarly explained that the judge threatened to call the cops and have them arrest her if she so much as touched Parker. Craig verified the story. Carly further said that the whole reason for the wedding was that Parker wanted to be emancipated so he didn't have to go away to boarding school. She blamed Jack for that. \n\n\nCarly and Jack argued until Janet intervened. She was furious that Jack was making life decisions for her daughter by himself, so she stormed out, vowing to find Liberty. Craig offered to help any way he could, but Jack told him to get lost. Craig left without comment. Carly broke out a bottle of wine and wished she knew where her boy was going to sleep. \n\n\nJack stood firm about not letting Parker return home. He refused to let Parker think he had outsmarted his parents. He cautioned Carly not to cave in if Parker showed up. He was sick of Parker's lies and manipulations. Carly interpreted that latest outburst as meaning Parker would eventually end up just as devious as she was. Jack proclaimed it was time to draw the line, but Carly told him that instead, he was building a wall. She got incensed and promised never to forgive him if something bad happened to Parker. \n\n\nParker and Liberty dragged their luggage to Old Town and sat on a bench. Liberty asked her new husband if he had really meant what he had told the judge about his being fearful that Carly would help herself to his trust fund. Parker admitted that he had said what was necessary for the two of them to get married. Craig found the teens and asked if they had any money. Parker said they had $30, so Craig told them to grab their bags and follow him. He was getting them a room at the Lakeview as a wedding present, probably the only one they would receive. \n\n\nBrad was cuddling with Katie, but all she could think about was whether Vienna was pregnant with their baby yet. Vienna and Henry rang the doorbell, and Vienna was deliriously happy as she announced she was with child. She waved four positive pregnancy tests in front of Katie's face for proof. They celebrated with champagne for all of them except Vienna, and the women marveled that the procedure had worked on the first attempt. Brad gave all the credit to his \"boys,\" but Henry was less enthusiastic. He appeared to be tired of the whole subject of babies. Brad toasted Henry and Vienna, and Vienna also raised her glass to little Sven or little Inga. Henry and Vienna left, and Brad reassured Katie, who was feeling left out of the process. \n\n\nBrad suggested the two of them go away together, but Katie nixed that idea. His second choice was a luxury suite for the weekend at the Lakeview, and that was much more to Katie's liking. Janet rang the doorbell, and came in, frantically looking for Liberty. She broke the news to Katie and Brad that Liberty had married Parker. Brad flipped out and accused Janet of letting it happen. He wanted to know why Parker was not away at boarding school, so Janet explained how the boy had flatly refused to go. \n\n\nBrad put on his coat in preparation for searching for his new son-in-law, but Janet calmed him down. She suggested he just be Liberty's dad, and said she was disappointed in the way she had handled the news, as well. She left to look for her daughter, and Brad thought about it for a while and came up with a solution. He suggested Parker stay at their house, with Liberty, but Brad would tape the boy's buns to the couch every night. Katie offered to help. \n\n\nHenry was feeling amorous and made his \"signature move\" on Vienna, who told him to get off the bed, \"because of Sven.\" Henry made a caustic remark about \"Sven the zygote,\" which did not sit well with Vienna. She said Henry had to put the baby's needs first, but Henry was more concerned about his own needs. He reminded Vienna that she had promised there would be no changes between them if he agreed to the surrogacy, but, he argued, not making love was a non-welcome change. \n\n\nHenry moved to an easy chair and began reading The Man from Oakdale.   Vienna wanted to talk, so Henry, who was still upset, told her it was a well documented fact that pregnant women enjoyed sex all the time. Vienna said she was sorry, and she made him relax and close his eyes while she began a role-playing game. Soon Henry became more enthusiastic as the game focused on alternate sources of pleasure. \n\n\nJack was still espousing tough love when Carly answered her phone. The caller was Craig, who informed her that he had run into the kids in Old Town and had gotten them a room at the Lakeview. Carly chose not to share the news with Jack, however, and instead asked Jack to leave. Jack waxed melancholy and told Carly he would always love her, but she was not impressed. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker settled in for the night at the Lakeview. They were hungry, but they could not afford room service or even the lounge, and they did not want to risk going to Al's and possibly running into family. Parker checked out the mini-bar and brought Liberty a box of chocolates, which they split. They went to bed, and Liberty asked to postpone the usual wedding night activities because she was exhausted. Parker agreed, and they both admired the expensive bed. \n\n\nCarly called Janet to tell her that their children were safe at the Lakeview, at least for one night. Janet could not believe that Carly had not shared the information with Jack. She asked if Carly was asking Janet not to tell her husband where the kids were, but Carly suggested Janet use her own judgment. \n\n\nJack went back to the farm, and Janet said she could not believe what had happened. Jack reiterated that he was sick of lies and manipulation by the kids, but Janet screamed at him that Parker and Liberty were just kids-their kids-who had made a bad mistake. \n\n\nJanet reminded Jack that she loved Liberty more than herself and him, and she could not believe that he had broken her heart so badly. Jack went outside to think, and he said aloud that he wished Hal Munson were there to give him some advice. He went inside and found Janet bringing down pillows and blankets for him. He was obviously not welcome in her bed. \n\n\nCarly drank all the wine and hurled the bottle against a cabinet. It shattered, and Carly was overcome with tears and sank down on her knees. Craig appeared and found her on the kitchen floor. Carly blamed him for not allowing her to call Jack when they first learned the kids were determined to get married. \n\n\nShe cried for a while and then asked Craig why he was still there. He said he was picking up shards of the wine bottle, and he invited her to go to the hotel to see the kids, but she declined. She said she did appreciate his getting the teens settled for the night, however, and Craig left.\n\n\n",

Blame is tossed around, as they talk about Parker's reasoning for this. Craig and Janet both leave, as Janet is frantic to find them and is furious at Jack as well. Jack admits to Carly that he is afraid at what his son has become, as Carly is sure that he is implying Parker is becoming her.
