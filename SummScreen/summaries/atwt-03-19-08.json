Casey felt responsible for bringing Matt into their lives and letting Nevins get closer to his family through their association with Matt. Margo tried to reassure her son that Matt had fooled everyone and that none of it was Casey's fault. Tom informed Casey that when Nevins was captured, Matt would be testifying against him and probably wouldn't be facing additional charges. Margo and Tom embarked on their busy days and Casey was left with a police guard to protect him as he went to class. \n\n\nHolden arrived at the office of immigration with Ameera, Luke, and Noah to discuss an extension on Ameera's visa. The group explained to the official that Ameera and Noah were married and that she was hoping to receive an extension. At first, the man seemed satisfied with the evidence that Ameera and Noah offered to prove they were married, but when he heard they were living at the farm he became suspicious of newlyweds living with the groom's best friend and his family. Holden tried to explain the living situation and the immigration bureaucrat seemed doubtful at first, but finally seemed to be convinced everything was legitimate. The official told everyone that they should expect follow-up visits to confirm that the marriage was real, but for a while, Ameera's extension was granted. In the hall, Holden warned everyone to stick to their plan to make the marriage look real and he left to check on Jack. \n\n\nJack woke up in the hospital and was greeted by Carly's encouraging face. He asked Carly how Parker was holding up since his trial was set to start. Carly reassured Jack that Parker was nervous, but ready for his case to be heard. Carly's only regret was that she was unable to get proof that Kit murdered Sam, and was unable to avoid Parker ever having to go to trial. She explained that the she wished she could have convinced the homeless woman she met in Chicago to testify that Kit disguised herself as a homeless woman and returned to Oakdale to shoot Sam. Jack wanted to go with Carly to Parker's trial, but she reminded him that he had almost died and needed to stay in the hospital until he was well. Jack agreed to stay in the hospital and asked Carly to give Parker his love. \n\n\nCarly arrived at the farm to pick up Parker and she reassured him that she would take care of him and fix everything. Parker didn't believe his mother and asked her to just get him to court. \n\n\nBrad woke up in the hospital after being poisoned by champagne the night before. He was pleased to see Katie by his bedside. He learned that the champagne he was drinking was poisoned by Gerald Nevins. Katie explained that Gerald Nevins and Gray Gerard were the same person and that the poison was meant for Henry. Brad was confused by the situation, but encouraged that Katie was the one who saved him and stayed with him at the hospital. He was comforted in the belief that since she was there with him, she must still have feelings for him. Just as Brad complained of being hungry, Bonnie arrived with a special lunch for him. With Bonnie there to keep Brad company, Katie got ready to leave, but Brad asked her to stay. Katie declined his invitation and left Brad with Bonnie. In the hall, Katie peeked back into the room and was obviously conflicted about her feelings for Brad. \n\n\nAs Katie watched Brad and Bonnie together, Margo noticed her and startled her sister when she called out to her. The two went to Al's Diner to have lunch, and Margo quizzed Katie about her real feelings for Brad. Katie explained she wasn't over Jack and felt her future would be with someone like Jack, not Brad. Margo counseled her sister to focus on her happiness in the present and not the future. Katie thanked her sister for the advice and told her she needed to get to Parker's trial. \n\n\nAt home Margo received a package from Nivens with an ominous note telling her that, \"I'll be there when you least expect it.\" The police arrived to take the package from Margo and brought back the young man who delivered the package to the Hugheses' home. The police questioned the deliveryman and learned that Nivens had paid him $100 to drop off the package. He then explained that he was just on campus at Oakdale University when Nivens had approached him there. Margo became worried that Nivens was still on campus where Casey was attending classes. She immediately phoned to check on her son and was relieved when he answered. Margo returned to the investigation as the FBI arrived and told her the case was now a federal investigation. \n\n\nAmeera, Noah, and Luke arrived in Oakdale for their classes and Noah was worried that someone from immigration might be watching. He decided it would be best for him to walk with Ameera to class. Luke looked on begrudgingly as Noah walked with his arm around Ameera and they played the part of the happy couple. \n\n\nLater in town, Ameera went to get coffee as Noah explained to Luke his concern that every stranger might try to prove his marriage to Ameera was a sham, and that he didn't know how he and Luke would make their relationship work. Luke reassured Noah that they would find a way to be together in private and for now he needed to focus on making his marriage to Ameera look real. \n\n\nInside Java, Ameera ran into Casey and the two recalled the night they met at Yo's. Ameera thanked Casey for sticking up for her the night of the mixer and informed Casey she would be staying in town thanks to her recent marriage. Casey was shocked to learn the girl he danced with had recently become a married woman. He was even more surprised when he heard that Noah was her husband, since he knew that Noah and Luke were a couple. At that moment, Ameera saw Casey's police guard peering through the window and assumed the police were watching her and asked Casey to leave. Ameera showed Casey the cop watching them and Casey explained that the cop was there to protect him from Nivens and wasn't after her. Casey received a call from Margo who reminded him to be safe and not to ditch his police guard. Ameera asked him if he was scared and Casey admitted he was a little frightened of Nivens. Casey offered to walk Ameera to class, but she declined and when Noah arrived, he criticized Ameera for going on a date with Casey. She explained that Casey said they could be friends and Luke told Noah to relax. Ameera left for class and Luke reminded Noah not to be paranoid, but Noah rushed out to take Ameera to class, leaving Luke to walk behind them. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Brad enjoyed the lunch that Bonnie delivered and learned that he was to be discharged. Brad was happy that he would be able to leave and support his nephew by attending Parker's trial. Bonnie asked to go along with Brad and he agreed. \n\n\nHolden arrived to check on Jack before heading to Parker's trial and found his cousin removing all the tubes and wires he was connected to. Jack asked Holden to help him get out of the hospital so he could help Parker beat the charges he faced. \n\n\nIn the Oakdale courthouse, Parker sat before the judge and listened to the charges against him. Tom sat by Parker's side ready to defend him against the accusation that he killed Sam. Carly was called to the stand where she recounted the events of the night Sam died. During her testimony, Katie, Brad, and Bonnie arrived to hear the case against Parker and offer their support. On the witness stand, Carly detailed Sam's attempt to rape her and the fact that she only heard Parker fire one shot. Tom explained that the second bullet caused Sam's death, not Parker's shot. The prosecution cross-examined Carly and tried to get her to admit she heard more than one shot, but Carly wouldn't budge. Tom asked to question Carly in redirect and asked Carly who she thought fired the second shot that killed Sam. Carly explained her theory of Sam's murder, but the prosecution objected and noted that there was no way to prove that Kit was in Oakdale the night Sam was shot. As Tom was ready to rest his case, Jack arrived with Holden and stated he was there to testify for the defense. \n\n\nTom asked for a recess to talk to Jack and he explained he was there to support Parker so Carly could continue searching for the homeless woman. Carly left Parker in Tom and Jack's care and set out to find the only witness that could clear Parker. Jack sat on the stand and explained his relationship with Parker. He detailed for the judge Parker's special intuition and how he knew that Sam was out to hurt Carly. Jack held himself responsible for not listening to Parker when he warned him that Sam was no good. With Tom's questions for Jack over, the prosecution questioned Jack about Faith's shooting and Jack explained that J.J. left out the gun that had been used to shoot Faith. The prosecution was smug in their response by asking if Parker was ever responsible for anything. After Jack's questioning, the judge ended the proceedings for the day and Parker remarked that his chances of being found innocent didn't look good. With court over, Katie offered her support to Jack and Parker as Brad looked on. Bonnie offered her support to Tom before leaving with Brad. \n\n\nCarly arrived in Chicago to search for the homeless woman who saw Kit in her disguise. As Carly drove through town she found the woman and begged her to tell what she knew about Kit. At first the woman explained that Kit had always been nice to her, but after Carly explained that Kit had framed Parker for murder, the woman finally told Carly that the clothes she had were from Kit and that she found something in the pocket that might help Parker. The woman handed over a receipt and Carly noticed it was from an Oakdale liquor store the night of Sam's murder and hoped it was what she needed to prove Parker's innocence. She set back out for home and found Jack leaving the courthouse with Katie and told him they had the evidence to save Parker.\n\n\n",
