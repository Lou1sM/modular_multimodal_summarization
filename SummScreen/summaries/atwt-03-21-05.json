Jennifer admits that she was hurt when she saw Katie and Mike talking together privately but says she knows she should trust Mike, because he has always been honest with her. This leads Mike to confess that he and Katie almost had a \"moment\" together and that if Henry had not called at that time, he would have kissed Katie and perhaps gone on to make love to her. Jennifer again tries to tell Mike about her night with Craig, but Mike says the two of them should \"take it from right here\" and forget the past, and that if Jennifer is willing to try, he wants to build a family with her.\n\n\nCraig is celebrating the success of Street Jeans in his apartment, alone, when Barbara comes to the door. She suggests that she sell her interest in Street Jeans to Craig with one condition: that he release Jennifer from any involvement in Street Jeans. Craig tells Barbara that she is insanely jealous of her daughter's success, and that the only person who can push him out of Street Jeans is Jennifer herself, which he says will never happen. Barbara leaves, and Craig goes to Mike's house, where he peeks in the window and sees Jennifer and Mike embracing; he realizes that Jennifer has not told Mike about their one-night stand.\n\n\nHenry tells Katie that they should end their marriage to save their relationship, because she is meant to be with Mike. Katie can't believe Henry is ready to let her go that easily and wants to know who's been trying to talk him into leaving her. He says that she herself has, because she couldn't go through with making love with him and because of her actions with Mike, and he admits to having been in town spying on them when they almost had their \"moment.\" Katie tells Henry that she and Mike realized after that moment that they each were in love with someone else and that all they shared was a history. Henry tells her she's a good friend, but she replies that she's a better lover and kisses him deeply. He tells her that if she is still there after he counts to 3, he'll kiss her again and won't stop until tomorrow morning; he gets to \"1\" before Katie begins kissing him again.\n\n\nAt the police station, Tom tells Keith that he is now free to go. Keith insists that Jack should not be handling the investigation of Julia's death because of his conflicts of interest and says he thinks Lily and/or Carly are guilty of murdering his sister. Tom suggests Keith stay out of it and go back to Chicago with JJ. Meanwhile, at the church, Holden tells Jack that he thinks he knows whose fingerprint might be on Julia's watch band. He takes the funeral program that Luke had torn in half and gives it to Jack, telling him to run it for fingerprints, and that what he finds will probably match the unidentified print from Julia's watch band. Jack wants to know whose print Holden thinks it is, and Holden confesses that he thinks it might be Luke's. Jack insists that that is nonsense, but Holden points out that Luke had motive and has been very angry and acting suspiciously, even trying to burn something the night of Julia's death. Jack agrees to run the print, and while Holden waits for the results at the station, he has a flashback to Luke's birth, when he delivered Luke for Lily. Jack comes in and lets Holden know that the print is indeed Luke's.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Luke cryptically tells Lily not to worry about anything because he \"took care of things\" and \"did what he did\" because the police would never believe Julia's death was an accident. Lily worries aloud to Carly that this means Luke killed Julia, saying no one else is likely to have entered Julia's apartment between the time Lily left and the time she and Carly came back. Carly tells Lily to just keep calm and no one will have to know that any of them were in Julia's apartment, and that the murder investigation will eventually just be pushed to the side because of lack of evidence. At that point, Keith rings the doorbell and begins accusing both Lily and Carly of being responsible for Julia's death. Lily asks Carly to call the police, and as Carly leaves the room, Keith advances on Lily, demanding to know whether she killed his sister. Luke rushes in and jumps on Keith, telling him to leave his mother alone. At that moment, Jack, Holden, and some uniformed policemen come into the house, and they separate Luke and Keith. Keith and Luke both want to know why they're there, and Jack says it's because they found out whose fingerprint was on the watch band. Luke asks whose print it was, and Jack says it was his. Keith then shouts that Luke is the murderer and should be charged with the crime, which Carly insists will never happen; Lily, unable to deal with the accusations against her son despite her own suspicions, blurts out her confession, saying, \"I did it! I killed Julia!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Luke interrupts the service and tears up the memorial program in anger. Lily and Holden are horrified. Later, Aaron describes to Holden how on the night that Julia died he saw Luke burning something in the alley behind Metro. He says he begged Aaron not to mention it to anyone.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Henry tells Katie that he saw her and Mike together. He wants them to end their marriage so that she and Mike can be together. Katie refuses, telling Henry that he's the one that she wants and they kiss passionately. Keith is released from prison and heads over to Lily's house where he tells Lily that he knows that she is the one who killed Lily. Luke overhears and attacks Keith. Holden asks Jack to compare the fingerprint on Julia's watchband with Luke's. Its a match. They go to Lily's and confront Luke. Lily can't bear it and confesses to Julia's murder. Barbara tries to bribe Craig to either leave Street jeans or to let Jennifer leave. Craig tells Barbara that she doesn't care about Jennifer's well being, she's jealous of Jennifer and wants to ruin her. Mike tells Jennifer that he almost kissed Katie but that he knows that Jennifer is the one he wants to be with. He also tells her that anything that has happened up to now doesn't matter, they're starting over. Jennifer is tempted to tell him about her one night stand with Craig",
