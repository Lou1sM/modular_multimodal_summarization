Jennifer told Sierra that she wants Craig out of Street Jeans and if Sierra can't make that happen she will no longer be a part of the company. Just in the nick of time Craig interrupted and wanted to know why he was not called to the meeting. Sierra wanted some answers as to what was going on between Craig and Jennifer. Jennifer tried to convince Sierra that nothing was going on between her and Craig but that they just had a difference of opinion on some work issues. Sierra told them that she didn't believe their story and Jennifer told Sierra that she would work around the problem. Sierra stormed off and Craig threatened Jennifer never to go behind his back again. Jennifer continued to tell Craig that she wanted nothing to do with him and that she can't stand to work with him. Craig told Jennifer that if she doesn't stop this charade she should prepare to lose Mike. \n\n\nCarly went to Lily's house to try to apologize for telling Jack the truth about how Luke went to Julia's and trashed her apartment the day she was murdered. Lily told Carly that she can't accept her apology and shut the door in Carly's face. Carly forced her way into Lily's house in an attempt to convince Lily that she had no other choice but to tell Jack the truth. Carly said that Jack would have found out for himself sooner or later what really happened. Lily still did not want to hear anything Carly had to say and showed her the door. Lily asked Carly to do her one more favor, \"Don't help me anymore.\" \n\n\nLuke woke up in his cell to find Holden there, who has slept outside the cell with him all night. Holden tried to explain to Luke why he turned him into the police. Holden said he had failed him and explained how he should have handled things better after he moved out. A police officer interrupted to take Luke to the court house for his arraignment.    \n\n\nKeith went to the police station to tell Jack that he was taking JJ away from him tonight, and that he will be back tomorrow to make sure that Carly pays for her part in Julia's murder. Lily showed up at the police station just as Luke was being taken away to his arraignment. Holden and Lily argued over Luke. Holden told Lily that she needed to find proof that Luke did not kill Julia because Luke was willing to go to prison in order to protect her. Carly came to the police station to see Jack and try to convince him to let Lily see Luke. Jack told Carly that Keith was there and that he was taking JJ away from him. Jack asked Carly to go shopping so he could have some time alone with JJ before Keith took him away. Meanwhile Lily invited Keith over to her house to ask for his help so he could receive justice for his sister. \n\n\nAt Katie and Henry's house, Mike showed up to try to find out what Henry knew about Jennifer. Katie told Mike that Henry lied about his heart problem and that he was in town the whole time. Henry apologized to Mike and asked his forgiveness. Mike wanted to know why Henry sounded so weird when he was talking about Jennifer the other night. Henry denied knowing anything about Jennifer and began to tell Mike that Katie added Henry's name on the lease at the gym. Everyone agreed that Henry would finally have to do some real work for once in his life.   \n\n\n",
