She then begins to play the DVD of Alison's porn movie, looking for clues as to where it might have been shot. Dusty walks in, unannounced, and demands to know why she's looking at that kind of stuff at Worldwide. Emily says she thinks she knows the girl and that the girl looks like she's in trouble and doesn't really want to be doing this. He tells her what the girl is doing isn't much different from what Emily's been doing. Emily wonders how she could track down the girl and asks Dusty where this type of movie is filmed. Dusty tells her usually in basements somewhere but that most of it comes from Los Angeles, but there are too many distributors of this type of movie for Emily to be able to track this particular one down. Emily agrees and asks how the baby food crisis at Worldwide is going and what she can do to help. Later, Emily goes to meet Cheri, telling her she needs to take a few days off. Cheri tells her if she leaves now, she's gone for good. Emily says, \"Okay,\" but Cheri says Emily would miss it too much, all the men lining up for her and all the money she's making. Emily says she's probably right but asks what Cheri would do if she found out her sister or her daughter was hooking; Cheri says, \"I'd get her out, whatever it took.\" Emily says she's somebody's daughter and somebody's sister, and she needs to get herself out now, so she's quitting. She then calls Susan and leaves her a message, saying because of a story she's working on, she has to leave town for a couple of days.\n\n\nAt Paul's cabin, Meg wakes up in bed with Paul, and they make love again. Afterwards, he makes coffee for her, and she says she's the one who brought him that coffee pot, from Emma's place; Paul tells her she can't have it back but he'll lease it to her up there at the cabin. Meg asks why he came back to the cabin, and he says it's because he was healed there once, and he was trying to find some peace. When he asks Meg how she feels about him, she says she feels good but wants to take things one day at a time; he asks her to let him know what kind of day today is. She leaves, and soon after that, there's a knock on the door; it's Faith, bearing a plate of cookies to thank Paul for saving Ethan's life. He makes sure she has permission to be up there visiting him, and she says Luke said it was okay. She says her mom and dad are with Ethan at Emma's, and that her mom is responsible for all the sick babies. Paul tells her to give her mom a break because Lily's probably already feeling guilty enough about the baby food incident without Faith saying things to make her feel worse. Faith says sometimes she says things before she even knows she's going to say them, and Paul says he does the same thing, but the people who love you forgive you anyway.\n\n\nCraig visits Lily and Ethan at Emma's house. He tells her he checked at the hospital and there are no more new sick babies, but that a couple of the babies there are in critical condition. He tells her the families are all threatening to sue Worldwide, but he's going to put his personal funds into Worldwide to take care of all the hospital bills and settle the problem out of court, and he tells her the settlements will include a gag order on the families, so that the only thing they can say is that Worldwide dealt with this crisis promptly and compassionately. Lily wants to call Lucinda to discuss it with her, but Craig convinces her that they don't have time for that and that Lucinda would want Lily to take steps now to save Worldwide. Lily asks for a pen to sign the papers Craig has brought to her concerning his funding of Worldwide. Craig says Lily should probably look them over first, but Lily says she trusts him, and she signs the paperwork. He says he'll take it to his lawyer for filing, and then Meg walks in. Craig greets her and says he tried to reach her the night before and wondered where she was. She notes that he didn't leave her a message, and he says he's trying to give her some distance, per her request. Lily tells Meg that Craig has come to save her and Worldwide; Craig leaves, and Lily tells Meg that Craig is putting his own money into the company to make the problem go away and ensure her mistakes don't have terrible consequences for her or for Worldwide. Meg later runs into Craig in the lobby of the Lakeview, where he and his lawyer are wrapping things up. She tells him that Lily told him what he did, and she's impressed. He tells her, \"That will change --- it always does!\" She says he may want everyone to think he's an evil man, but he's really not, and she likes him, very much. Back at Worldwide, Lily walks into Dusty's office and tells him not to worry about the threatened lawsuits because a very special friend of hers is going to handle it; when he asks who that might be, she tells him, \"Craig Montgomery.\"\n\n\nAt a dirty cabin in Michigan's upper peninsula, Gwen, Will, and Maddie are trying to clean up and get warm. There's a knock on the door, and it's the local sheriff, but he has come just to collect his rent on the cabin, which he owns. When he asks them who they are, they give him phony names and tell him they're from the University of Wisconsin and that they're film majors who are scouting locations for their next film project. He asks what kind of movie they're making, and Maddie says a \"Blair Witch\" type of thing, but with some dark comedy in it. He then asks where their camera is, and they freeze until Maddie pulls out her cell phone and flips it open, saying it films enough video for them to upload to their computers. The sheriff leaves after warning them to keep the door locked because of wild critters, both animal and human, that might wander through. After he leaves, Maddie goes outside, and Will and Gwen realize how close they came to being found out just because they hadn't thought about bringing a camera when they came up with their cover story. Gwen thinks this is too much for Will to deal with, and she tries to convince him to go back to Oakdale, but he says he can't leave her and Maddie alone. He also tells her that if he'd been there when Adam went after Gwen, Adam would probably still be dead, but it would be because Will killed him. They kiss, and Maddie sees them; she walks away and comes back again, knocking this time. Will goes outside to get some firewood, and Maddie tells Gwen how much she misses Casey and how much she loves him. She tells Gwen that she and Casey never did actually make love, and now she'll never have that experience with someone she really loves and wants to be with. Gwen assures her that she will, but Maddie doesn't think it's possible anymore. Will comes back in with the firewood, and Gwen suggests they all go into town and get some breakfast. Maddie asks them just to bring some back for her, because she wants to stay and get the cabin cleaner and warmer. They try to get her to change her mind, but when she insists on staying, they leave. A moment later, Maddie hears someone at the door, and it bursts open; it's Casey, who says he tracked them down by hacking into Will's computer. Casey demands that Maddie stop lying to him and tell him what she's running from; he says he'll love her no matter what, but he needs to know the truth. Maddie tells him she killed Adam, and she explains how. Casey is very upset, particularly that Gwen and Maddie then buried Adam and left him there in the woods without telling anyone what had happened. He tells Maddie that Adam would have come to help him out of the trouble he was in, but Maddie tells him Adam was skipping town when Gwen found him. Will and Gwen return to the cabin and see Casey, and he angrily tells Will he can't believe their brother's dead and Will didn't even bother to tell him. Will says it couldn't be helped, and Maddie cries out to Casey that he said he'd love her no matter what; he responds that he still loves her, but he wishes he didn't, and then he storms out of the cabin. Maddie wants to go find him, but Will and Gwen say they have to leave right away, before Casey goes back and tells Margo what's happened and sends the local cops after them. Maddie doesn't think Casey would turn them in, but Will says he'd do it just to stand up for Adam.\n\n\n\n\n",
