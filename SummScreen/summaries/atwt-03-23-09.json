    "soap_central": "\n\nAlison found Casey, who was mopping floors is the hospital, and paid him back for a movie ticket, and teased him about whether there would ever be a \"next time\" movie date for them. Margo and Tom arrived to talk with their son. They wanted to make amends to Casey, who was furious with his mother for arresting him and not believing in his innocence in the recent murders in Oakdale. After Margo and Tom left, Alison approached Casey and attempted to convince him to listen to his parents. \n\n\nTom and Margo went to Al's Diner, where Margo expressed disappointment that their bright son was pushing a mop instead of using his brain. Tom was more laid back, however, and considered Casey's friendship with Alison Stewart a plus. Margo was not convinced that anyone from the Stewart family could be thought of as a good role model. \n\n\nAt Java, Dusty asked Meg to dinner after her hospital shift was over, but Meg wanted to spend time with her baby. Dusty said he was happy to take both of them out; he admitted they were the only sane people in his life. He missed Johnny terribly, and even Lucy, and he told Meg he had not heard a word from Lucy. They shared a kiss, and Dusty walked Meg to her floor at Memorial, where they ran into Lucy, who ignored them. Dusty remarked that Lucy had cozied up to Craig for Johnny's sake and thrown Dusty to the wolves. Lucy eavesdropped on the conversation, as Meg said she did not understand why Lucy was shutting Dusty out. Meg told Dusty she really cared for him. \n\n\nEmily went to Fairwinds, where Paul surprised her by brandishing a large butcher knife that frightened her. He handed her the knife and asked her to use it on him. He suggested a simple flesh wound, nothing serious, but something that looked nasty. Emily refused to participate, so Paul reminded her that at one time, she had no compunction about shooting him in the back. Emily questioned Paul's sanity and motives, and he told her that Meg had lied when she had said there was nothing going on between her and Dusty. He asked Emily again to stab him, but Emily still demurred. Then Paul said he would do it himself, and Emily ran out. Paul set up the knife and leaned his hand against it, drawing blood. \n\n\nTom and Margo waited at Al's, hoping that Casey would relent and join them. He finally did and sat with them. Margo apologized for not believing him while she was investigating the drug dealing, and Casey complained that his folks always believed the worst about him. He was tired of feeling like a constant disappointment to them. Margo denied that, but she said they would never give up on wanting the best for him. They believed Casey could still do something worthwhile with his life besides push a mop. That infuriated Casey, who got up and walked out. Tom left to go after him, leaving Margo at the table, agonizing over her failure as a mother. Alison came in, and Margo asked the girl to speak to Casey on their behalf. \n\n\nMeg approached Lucy at the hospital and asked if Dusty was still important to her. Lucy said she realized how important Johnny was to Dusty, but there was nothing she could do about the situation with Craig at that moment. Meg asked Lucy to speak to her father on Dusty's behalf, but Lucy said her father would never consider a change in his rules. Craig was fearful that Dusty would take the boy and run, and Lucy said she was helpless. \n\n\nCasey went home and began packing his belongings. Tom came in and the two of them argued. The doorbell interrupted them, and Casey let Alison in. Tom left the two of them and went back to the diner. Casey was unhappy and got further agitated when he learned that Margo had asked Alison to intervene again. The girl told Casey to stop jumping to conclusions without listening to what his parents were really saying. She suggested he go back to the diner and talk to his mother. \n\n\nLucy approached Dusty in the lobby of the Lakeview and asked to speak with him somewhere private. They decided to go to Dusty's room, but Emily spotted them getting on the elevator and she followed. Lucy said Meg had asked her to speak on Dusty's behalf with Craig, but she explained how her dad would cut her off from her brother instantly if she did that. Dusty was unhappy, but he understood what Lucy was saying. He let her out of his room, and the two of them hugged. Then Lucy called her mystery contact and said she was on her way. Emily was lurking around the corner and followed Lucy. \n\n\nPaul, bleeding heavily from his hand, rushed into Memorial and Meg ran to help him. He asked for a doctor to treat him, not her, so Meg put him in a treatment room and tried to stop the bleeding before she summoned a doctor. Meg recognized the wound as self-inflicted, and she went off on Paul. He declared there was no way he would allow Dusty to get anywhere near his daughter. He continued to make threats and then walked out. \n\n\nLucy went to the docks, with Emily following closely behind. Emily overheard Lucy tell the dockworker that her father would have his first shipment of vodka the next week. The man explained that Craig would never know that anything had been added to his load, and Emily watched Lucy leave the docks. \n\n\nCasey went back to Al's and told Margo he forgave her; he initiated a hug. He agreed to join them for lunch at home and promised not to move out. Tom told Margo that Alison had changed their son's mind. \n\n\nAlison was waiting for Casey in Old Town, and she asked how things had gone with his mom. Margo called Casey and asked him to invite Alison to join them for lunch, which Casey dubbed the \"Hughes Family Psycho Drama.\" He admitted to Alison that he had gone to talk with Margo because Alison had convinced him. Alison was reluctant to join the Hughes family for lunch, but Casey told Margo the girl would come. \n\n\nEmily went back to Fairwinds and found Paul with his hand bandaged. She reported that she had seen Lucy and Dusty together and that they had gone to his room for a brief time. Then she told him about the episode at the docks and that she had surmised that Lucy was adding something to Craig's shipment without his knowledge. Paul suggested he ask Lucy herself, and he gave Emily a kiss, then left. \n\n\nDusty found Meg at work and told her he had spoken with Lucy, and she had promised to speak to Craig for him. That surprised Meg, who told him about Paul's injured hand and said she was very worried about his mental state. Dusty said that Paul was just playing her, and Meg confessed she was mostly worried about what Paul might do to Dusty. \n\n\nPaul showed up at Lucy's hotel room in the Lakeview and bluffed that he knew \"the whole deal\" about her father. Lucy feigned ignorance and lied about being in Dusty's room, but Paul told her she had been seen. Then Paul mentioned the \"little deal\" she had going on at the docks and said he knew what she was doing. Lucy asked what he wanted, and Paul gave her a choice: either Paul could notify the cops and put Lucy in jail, or she could do exactly what he told her. \n\n\nLucy asked what he wanted from her, and Paul said he wanted her to get Dusty back for herself and away from Meg. Lucy said she couldn't do that, so Paul threatened to tell Craig about his daughter's extracurricular activities at the docks. Paul gave the girl 24 hours to make her decision. \n\n\nWhen the Hughes family lunch finished, Casey walked Alison out. Margo admitted that she thought Alison was good for Casey. Tom told her it was good to see her smile again, and suggested they forego the dirty dishes and take a nap. Margo grinned and agreed. Outside, Casey and Alison concluded a pleasant conversation.\n\n\n",
