Will is furious about the whole idea, both with Hal for suggesting it and with Gwen for seemingly agreeing with it. Gwen is puzzled as to why living with Hal for 3 months would be such a bad thing, but Will tells her that his mom and dad's house holds terrible memories for him, from when Hal and Barbara decided to divorce to when he was told they were sending him to the mental hospital. He tells Gwen he'd rather be in a ratty apartment and work as a janitor at the hospital than stick around the house, in part because of the bad memories/associations and in part because he feels like it will end up being some kind of \"bait and switch\" or that Barbara will somehow sneak in and set Gwen up for something. Meanwhile, Hal manages to get Barbara to agree to release the trust fund to Will if he and Gwen fulfill their end of the bargain, telling Barbara that when Will and Gwen have no one left to fight, they will probably drift apart like most teenagers who get married too young tend to do. Hal goes back home, pleased as punch with the deal he's made, but he's greeted by an angry Will and a remorseful Gwen, who tells him that they've decided to stick with their original plan of getting jobs and moving out as soon as possible.\n\n\nEmily tells Henry about her visit to Paul, and she asks Henry if he thinks she can believe Paul when he says he's furious with Meg for turning on him and that turning his back on Emily was the worst mistake of his life. Henry looks doubtful about Paul's feelings for Emily but says he has no proof to offer her either way; Emily seizes on that and says she'll go get proof. Meanwhile, Meg visits Paul in jail, where she tries to tell him he's done enough already to try to convince Emily that he's sorry so that she'll realize she doesn't need to continue to hold Dusty hostage. He tells her not to worry about him, but he needs to really convince Emily that he's not involved with Meg and still in love with Emily. While they are talking, Paul spots Emily and begins shouting at Meg, telling her to get out of his life. Emily walks up, and Meg and Paul yell at each other some more before Meg leaves, saying Paul was never her type anyway. Paul sincerely apologizes to Emily for having hurt her after she'd been so loyal to him and so trustworthy, and then he tells her no one ever loved him like she did. Emily tells Paul that she wants to believe him and that she's willing to come back to him if he really loves her; when he reminds her he'll be in jail for a long time, she insinuates that there might be a way around that. When he asks what she's talking about, she simply tells him that if he really loves her still, he can prove it by marrying her --- today.\n\n\nAt Chardonnay's place, Nick and Katie question her about what happened to Nick in the hotel room; she insists that Anatoly wants to kill her because he thinks she's been talking to people about what happened, so she has to leave town. Nick tells her he can offer her immunity if she'll just tell him everything that happened and everyone who was involved. She says she'll do it if he can guarantee she won't get any jail time, and he tells her he can agree to that. Chardonnay then feigns an asthma attack and leaves the room, supposedly to get her inhaler, but she leaves through a back door, where she is grabbed by a man dressed in a black jacket and wearing black gloves. Nick and Katie soon realize that Chardonnay has fled, and Nick tells Katie this means his only hope of clearing his name is gone, and he'll surely end up in prison now.\n\n\nAt home, Carly and Parker are still both slightly rattled after the confrontation with Chardonnay, but Carly reassures Parker that all will be back to normal soon. Carly then goes to the police station with a box of Jack's things to put back on his desk, but he's not there. When Margo tells her that Jack is working the Kasnoff case, Carly panics and heads back home. When she gets there, she sees Jack's car outside; nervous, she opens the door and calls his name, only to see him standing there, in his black jacket and gloves, talking to Chardonnay.\n\n\n",

Nick and Katie confront Chardonnay about setting him up. She tells them she can't help them because Anatoli is already gunning for her. Paul lets Meg in on his plan to get Emily to reveal where Dusty is, and it involved convincing Emily he still loves her and that she was turning state's evidence. Meg worries what Emily could do to him if she finds out he is lying, but Paul feels he has to do this for Jen and her. Emily tells Henry about what Paul told her.

Nick tells Chardonnay he will give her full immunity if she gives up Anatoli and the person who told Anatoli he was a cop.

She then learns Jack is now on the Galaxy/Nick/Anatoli case and she leaves worrying about what he could find out now. Barbara agrees to Hal's terms, and he thinks with noone to fight with now they will simply drift apart like most high school couples. Paul supposedly confesses his undying love to Emily and tells her he will do anything to prove it to her; she tells him she is thrilled to hear him say that. She wants him to marry her tonight. Hal tells Gwen and Will that Barbara accepted his terms, but knowing how Will feels, Gwen tells him they can't stay accept his offer any longer.
