They discussed offering a reward and going public by appearing on WOAK with their story. \n\n\nJack came into the diner while Janet was working the morning shift. The air was very frosty between them, as they argued about what to do with Parker and Liberty. Janet said she thought Jack cared more about being right than the welfare of their kids, and she wanted no part of that. \n\n\nAt Java, Parker counted their pocket change, and the results were dismal. Mr. Schenk, Parker's lawyer, arrived, so Parker immediately asked when he could get his hands on his trust fund. The attorney explained there was no guaranteed access to the money just because of the boy's marriage to Liberty. He guessed it would take about six months for Parker to get the money, if things went smoothly. Parker asked what they could do in the meantime for cash, and Schenk suggested they both get jobs. Parker was willing to dump school, but Liberty was not. Parker considered applying for work at Java, but the manager told him that he was already turning away experienced college help. \n\n\nCarly went to the Lakeview looking for her son. When she found the newlyweds' room empty, she asked the clerk if he had seen them. She argued with the clerk when he called the teens, \"Mr. and Mrs. Snyder,\" and she also denied that they were on any sort of a honeymoon. Craig came up and got the information from the clerk that the kids had gone out. He suggested that Carly leave them alone and let them face reality. He offered to help look for them, however, and they split up to go search. \n\n\nCarly went to Al's and spoke with Janet. Neither mother had heard from the kids, and both were worried sick. They agonized over how to keep their young people from making such terrible mistakes. They decided Jack did not need to know that the kids had a hotel room courtesy of Craig Montgomery. Carly said she would call Janet when she located the missing two. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Kim was flabbergasted that the discrimination Luke described was rampant in Oakdale. She found the story worthy of being on the air, but the fact that Lily and Luke were working together as mother and son was even more fascinating to her. They agreed that an interview was in order, and Kim suggested they do it live right then, since she had a hole in the programming from a cancellation. \n\n\nAt the police station, Craig asked to see Margo, but Jack told him that she was in court. Craig asked if Jack had heard from Parker, because no one had seen the teens since they left the hotel. He explained how he had plucked them off the street and gotten them a hotel room, and Jack came unglued. He accused Craig of continuing to try to look like a hero for Carly, but he also warned Craig not to interfere further with Jack's family. Craig also told Jack that both Carly and Janet knew about the hotel arrangements, and Jack was stunned. He threw Craig out of the station and then headed for the diner. \n\n\nOn the television interview, Luke and Lily talked about raising awareness about gay rights in the community and going so far as to file a class action suit. Kim asked about funding, so Luke explained that his birth father, Damian Grimaldi, had funded the foundation with ill-gotten money, and Luke had chosen to use it for philanthropy. Lily discussed how she had not handled Luke's coming out well, and she wanted to help other families deal with similar challenges. Lily was an articulate and effective spokesperson against discrimination of any kind. Kim applauded them when the segment finished and thanked them for their inspiration. The phones began ringing at the station switchboard. \n\n\nCraig spotted Parker and Liberty in Java, so he called Carly and told her where they were. He went inside and greeted the kids warmly. Carly arrived almost immediately and asked to speak with Parker. She wanted to know what he was going to do about school, but Parker replied that she and Jack had thrown him out of their house, so therefore Carly had no more say in his life. The newlyweds walked out, and Carly was crushed. Craig noticed that Liberty did not look happy, and he revealed that to Carly. He offered to buy her lunch, and she accepted, as long as a very large glass of wine was included. \n\n\nThe teens went to the diner, followed by Jack, who immediately jumped on Janet for not telling him that Craig had paid for a hotel room for their kids. They took the argument outside, while Liberty covered for Janet in the diner. Parker noticed that the cash register drawer was not completely closed. Outside, Jack and Janet argued loudly until Janet defended herself by yelling at Jack that she didn't tell him where the kids were because she didn't think he cared. She also resented that Jack made decisions that affected her daughter without Janet's approval. Liberty heard the yelling and came outside to defend her mother. \n\n\nInside the diner, Parker cleaned out the cash drawer and stashed the money in his pocket. He then went outside and pulled Liberty away, telling her they had to leave. Jack and Janet went back into the diner where Janet apologized to her husband. Then she discovered that the money in the till was gone, and told Jack. Jack took off after Parker and Liberty. He caught them on the street and demanded the money back. Parker denied taking it, but Jack found it in the boy's pocket, which terrified Liberty. \n\n\nJack marched them back to the diner, where he returned the money to Janet. Parker claimed he had won the money in a poker game, but that did not fly. Jack was furious that, after being caught stealing the money, the boy continued to lie. Janet claimed no harm had been done and she wanted Jack to forget about it, but Jack said Parker needed to admit what he had done. Jack cuffed his son, read him his rights, and marched him to the police station. \n\n\nAt the television station, Kim was excited that the phone responses were heavily positive. They were all shocked when Mr. Reese, the homophobic landlord, walked in and offered Luke and Noah the apartment they had wanted to rent. They each stated their terms and reached a fair deal. The boys promised to go sign the lease later, and everyone at the station rejoiced. Kim asked Luke and Lily for periodic updates on their progress, and they agreed. \n\n\nAt lunch, Carly hit the wine heavily and became melancholy. Craig said Jack really went over a cliff with his behavior over the kids' issue, and Carly sarcastically called Craig \"the father of the year.\" He offered to keep the teens in the hotel for another week, and Carly expressed her gratitude. Craig said it was only money, and besides, he loved having her in his debt. \n\n\nAt the police station, Jack arranged for Parker's booking for robbery as an adult. Liberty and Janet protested, but Jack's point was that the boy wanted to be treated as an adult, so he would get a good look at how that worked for him. Liberty begged Jack to do something, and Janet called Carly. \n\n\nCarly was still at the Lakeview with Craig, who was arranging for the room for the kids when Carly received Janet's call. Janet told her Jack had arrested Parker, so Carly and Craig hustled to the police station. Jack explained that Parker had robbed the cash drawer at the diner. He was also resentful that Craig was involved with his family yet again. Carly told Jack he was out of control, but Jack wondered aloud why he was the only one concerned about Parker's following the rules. \n\n\nLiberty got a minute to speak with Parker alone, and she called him as stubborn as Jack. Parker reminded her that Jack was not his real father. He claimed Hal Munson would never have arrested him. Liberty disagreed, so Parker questioned whether she still loved him. She replied that, of course, she still did. \n\n\nCarly begged Jack to let Parker go, but Jack lit into her for being half-drunk. He smelled the booze on her breath and told her to sober up if she wanted to talk with him further. Craig offered to call his lawyer, so at least Parker could get out of jail. \n\n\nLuke, Lily, and Noah went home and continued to make proactive plans for the foundation. There was a knock at the door, but when Lily answered, there was nothing there but an unmarked package. Luke joked about its being a bomb, but Noah was hesitant about his friend's opening it. Inside, Luke found only a note, which warned him to stop defending perverts and sinners, or he would live to regret it. Noah and Lily wanted to call the police, but Luke felt they were overreacting. \n\n\nCraig's lawyer bailed out Parker, so he was free until his trial. The lawyer also said that it was up to the diner to pursue or drop the charges against the boy, so Janet said she would talk with Henry and Vienna. Parker told Liberty that Craig had arranged for them to stay longer at the hotel, so they left with Janet. Craig took Carly home, but not before she screamed at Jack to fix it. \n\n\nExcept for Jack, they all went to the Lakeview to drop off the kids. Craig handed the key card to Parker and told him to use room service and not to go hungry. The kids thanked him and disappeared into the elevator. Craig announced that he needed a drink, but both Janet and Carly declined to join him. Craig took Carly home, and they hugged. \n\n\nAt the farm, a tearful Janet sat on the porch as Jack arrived home. He sat with her, and Janet confided that she hated what was happening. She thought Jack had made a bad situation worse, but she was still his wife and would stick by him. Jack thanked her, and they embraced.\n\n\n",
