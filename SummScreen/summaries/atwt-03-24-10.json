    "soap_central": "\n\n \nHenry asked the bartender at the Lakeview for a \"breakfast martini.\"  Barbara sneaked up behind him and whispered in Henry's ear, but he was nervous.  She said how much she had enjoyed their night together, and if it happened again, so much the better.  Barbara watched Henry sip his drink, and then he headed to the elevator and Vienna's room. Barbara's shoulders slumped, and she looked in pain.\n\n\nIn her room, Vienna tried to choose just the right outfit to please Henry.  Henry knocked on her door, so Vienna untied her robe, answered the door, and said she wasn't quite ready yet.  Henry watched her dress, and Vienna asked him to zip up her dress.  She turned around and moved even closer, until Henry decided it was time to go downstairs.\n\n\nCarly went back to Craig's suite early and wanted to continue to work on Monte Carlo business. She said her house was like Grand Central Station, and she had slept on a trundle bed in Sage's room.  Craig said it was not a good day for that because he had appointments scheduled, and Carly wormed it out of him that Craig was joining Barbara Ryan for an early lunch.  Carly giggled over that, but Craig explained that he thought Barbara was \"up to something,\" and he needed to find out if she was spying on them.\n\n\n Carly left, and Craig went down to the lounge and found Barbara drinking coffee.  He said that the two of them had once had \"an affinity for one another,\" but Barbara corrected him by remarking that Craig's affinity was for Barbara's bank account.  Craig asked Barbara for a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate about the fashion business, but she said first he had to reveal how he had gotten his \"magic investor\" to trust him.  Craig said that was still confidential information, and he asked what Barbara was focused on.  She replied, \"Fun,\" and she grabbed his hand and pulled him away.\n\n\nHenry took Vienna to Metro, but she was more interested in dancing than eating.  She pulled Henry to his feet and put her arms around him.  Vienna wanted to sneak into the coat check room for some privacy, and she was all over Henry. Henry stalled, but suddenly Craig and Barbara walked in and spotted them.  Vienna tried to talk Henry into returning to the hotel with her, but Henry had an urgent craving for dessert.  Vienna was disappointed, so she moved around the table and sat on Henry's lap.\n\n\nBarbara and Craig sat at the bar, and Barbara observed what was going on at Henry's table.  Craig was still thinking business, and he asked her if she was \"gearing up to be the competition.\"  Thinking only of her situation with Henry, Barbara blurted out, \"You bet I am!\"  Craig grinned and said he knew it; Barbara was trying to get some \"dirt\" on Monte Carlo.  Barbara looked at Craig and said it was nothing to do with business, but then she noticed that Vienna was whispering into Henry's ear.  Barbara began touching Craig and smiling, and she said Craig was so right when he mentioned that they shared a \"certain physical affinity.\"  Craig was disturbed and looked at her as if she were delusional.\n\n\nHenry began squirming, and Vienna asked him what was wrong.  He said he had to go to the bathroom and excused himself.  He walked by Craig and Barbara and gave them a long look.  Barbara also excused herself, but she went to Vienna's table and sat with her.  She asked Vienna if everything was all right because she claimed she could sense the tension.  She asked Vienna if she could help, so Vienna said that ever since she had returned to Henry's bed, he just couldn't...and Vienna made a flopping gesture with her finger.  Barbara stifled a grin but looked pleased.\n\n\n Vienna asked for Barbara's opinion, so Barbara said that Vienna had waltzed back to Oakdale and expected to pick things up where she and Henry had left off.  She explained that was a lot of pressure on a man, especially one with a broken heart.  Vienna asked how to fix that, and Barbara said, \"Back way off, and give him time.\"  She also suggested that Vienna let Henry make the first moves.\n\n\nHenry returned from the rest room and stopped to talk with Craig.  He asked if Craig had \"designs\" on Barbara, and Craig burst out laughing when he figured out that Barbara was using him to make Henry jealous.  \"Mystery solved,\" chuckled Craig.  Vienna approached and asked Henry to leave with her because the place had \"bad vibes.\"  Barbara returned to Craig, and he asked her if she really thought she could compete with Vienna Hyatt.  \"Give it up,\" he warned, and then walked out, leaving her stranded.\n\n\nWhen Barbara finally got back to the Lakeview, she hunted for Craig and found him in the lobby.  She ranted that he had invited her to lunch and then stuck her with the bill and made her take a taxi home.  Craig told her to consider it a fee \"for services rendered.\"  He accused her of using him as \"an emotional cattle prod\" so she could get to Henry Coleman.  Barbara let loose on Craig and called him nasty names.  She also let it slip that she and Henry were \"combustible\" in bed, but with Vienna, Henry was having \"hydraulic problems.\"  Craig protested \"TMI,\" but then he admitted that Henry did appear quite jealous.\n\n\nBack at the diner, Vienna made a batch of her famous pepparkakor cookies, and she and Henry waited for them to bake.  Henry said her pepparkakor was unforgettable, and Vienna told him that in Sweden, she had attracted a rich, handsome, and powerful man, but she had resisted because he wasn't Henry.  Life was no fun without Henry, she lamented. Henry talked about how lonely he had been without her after Brad's death, and the two of them kissed.\n\n\nAt that moment, Barbara, buoyed by Craig's assessment that Henry was jealous, passed by the diner and looked in the window.  She saw Vienna and Henry kissing, and it burst her balloon instantly.\n\n\nDusty arrived at Carly's and found Janet feeling much better and sitting on the couch.  He had stopped at the diner and bought her a bacon and egg sandwich, Janet's favorite, with extra-crispy bacon.  She was delighted, and, as she was unwrapping it, Jack walked in from the kitchen with a bacon and egg sandwich he had just made her.  Janet decided she was a bit nauseated, and took off for the bathroom.\n\n\nWhen Janet returned, both Jack and Dusty crowded around her, and Dusty asked her if she still liked the red brick house they had looked at the other day.  Janet said she loved it, so Dusty promised to buy it for them, but Jack butted in and asked all sorts of questions.  Carly returned then and quizzed Jack why he cared so much about Janet and Dusty's house.  Dusty told Jack to go see his lawyer and get a divorce, so that they could all get on with their lives.  Jack agreed, so he left to see the attorney, and Dusty said he would make a deal on the house.  That left Carly to stay with Janet, and she more or less agreed to do it.\n\n\nJanet said she was feeling fine with no more cramps, and she urged Carly to do what she had to, but Carly said they were both stuck.  Liberty called her mother then, and she sounded a bit teary and said she needed Janet.  Janet told her what her doctor had said, so Liberty apologized and said her mom needed to follow the doctor's orders.  Liberty hung up in a hurry, and Janet knew that Liberty was still upset.  Janet told Carly that her daughter needed her, and she was getting on the next plane to Minnesota.  Carly did not try to stop her, but instead offered to go with Janet.\n\n\nJanet and Carly flew to Minnesota, and Janet walked into Liberty's room.  She was amazed to find her father, Rocco Ciccone, sitting there beside his granddaughter.  He introduced himself to Carly, who also walked in, and Liberty was overjoyed to see her mom.  Rocco asked to speak to Janet in the hall, so Carly offered to stay with Liberty.  In the hall, Rocco said he wanted Janet to know that Teri had read him the riot act, and he was there to support his family.  Janet told her father that she was pregnant with a child who could possible save Liberty's life, but she backed away from him when he tried to hug her.\n\n\n Rocco was delighted that his daughter was having a baby \"the right way,\" with her husband at her side.  Rocco said he wanted to be a real grandfather to Janet's kids and to be a part of her life.  Janet hugged him then, and he asked why Jack was not there.  He said he was concerned when he'd learned that Janet had married a cop, because \"of you know what.\"  Janet did not \"know what,\" and she reminded him that they did not know each other very well anymore.\n\n\nInside Liberty's room, the girl told Carly that she needed Carly help to face reality.  Liberty said she didn't know how long she could hang on, and if something happened, Janet would need all the help she could get.  She begged Carly to let Jack and Dusty both help her mother if Liberty died.  Carly insisted that Liberty was not going to die.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Dusty drove to the house he and Janet had chosen, and he saw the realtor leaving.  She explained that Dusty had never called back, so she had sold the house to another client.  She said the deal had just closed, so Dusty asked her to offer the new buyer $50,000 more than he had paid for the house.  Just then, the new owner walked down the front steps, so the realtor introduced Dusty to Mr. Cain.  Dusty offered his deal directly, but the owner turned him down.  Dusty yelled that he had promised that home to the woman he loved, and he grabbed Cain's arm when he tried to walk away.  \"Over my dead body,\" shouted the man, as Dusty made a statement about arranging that.  The realtor reached for her phone.\n\n\nDusty jumped the owner, as Jack arrived and separated the men.  He sent Cain on his way and the realtor went, as well.  Dusty asked if Jack was going to arrest him and complained that the owner was a real jerk.  Jack said being a jerk was not illegal in Illinois, but assault was.  Jack looked at the house and agreed with Dusty that Janet would love living there.  Then he suggested that Dusty tip off the seller that Mr. Cain was under criminal investigation for securities fraud, and it was a good case.  Jack bet that the seller would put the house right back on the market if Cain went down.  Dusty thanked Jack for his help, and he headed back to Carly's.  When no one answered the door there, he called Janet.\n\n\nJanet explained that she was with Liberty in Minnesota, and when Rocco heard her talking, he assumed she was talking with her husband.  He took the phone from her and said hello to Jack.  Dusty identified himself and asked Rocco to tell Janet that he would be there as soon as possible.  Rocco was confused, and he asked Janet about it, but she excused herself and went back in with Liberty. She also sent Carly home, since Dusty was on his way.\n\n\nWhen Dusty arrived at the hospital, he ran into Mr. Ciccone, who asked him why he was there.  Dusty replied that he was supporting his fianc\u00e9e, but Rocco thought he meant Carly.  Dusty clarified the confusion, and Rocco yelled that Janet was a married woman, so Dusty said that Jack was filing divorce papers, and Dusty was going to marry Janet.  Ciccone griped that Janet had already ruined one child's life and she was doing it again.  He called Dusty an \"adulterer,\" and walked off.  Janet ran out of Liberty's room and hugged him. Janet and Dusty shared some time with Liberty, as Rocco looked through the window.\n\n\nAt Carly's Jack was relieved to see her return.  She explained that Janet was visiting Liberty, and Carly had just made a round trip to Minnesota.  She said it was \"a great day, so sorry it's over, you're welcome,\" with bitterness.  Jack thanked her and they cuddled on the couch.  Carly said Liberty was convinced that she was dying, but Jack was sure that things would work out.  He showed Carly the divorce papers from Janet, and those cheered them.\n\n\nIn his room, Craig rearranged the things on his desk and checked the bedroom.  He appeared uneasy and worried.\n\n\n",
