The pawn broker brings out a box of goods which Craig identifies as his and Rosanna's.  The man who brought them, the pawnbroker tells them, has promised to return with more.\n\n\nCarly and Paul arrive on St. Bart's at the hotel where Rosanna was staying.  They are stunned to find Lucy already there waiting for them.  Paul tells Lucy that was a bad decision on her part; Craig will be furious.\n\n\nKatie is waiting at the Old Mill to meet the mysterious \"RC\" from Pilar's phone book.  Instead, she finds herself confronted by her sister, Margo from the Oakdale PD, who berates Katie for this \"Nancy Drew moment.\"  Mike is there too, and asks Katie how Henry got possession of Pilar's datebook.  Then he quizzes her about the number she called from the book.  Mike is furious and calls Pilar who says she is on her way to the Old Mill to meet them.\n\n\nAt Aaron's apartment, Chris and Aaron argue about Alison.  Chris is looking for her and Aaron suggests she might be with her mother.  At the Lakeview, Alison, under the influence of vodka, asks Susan for her college money.  She intends to pay back Chris for the money they lost on the ruined condo.  Susan tells her she smells like a liquor cabinet and tells her she needs to sober up.  Susan will only release the college money when Alison presents her with an acceptance letter from a legitimate college.  Alison is close to hysterical when Chris arrives and asks to speak to Alison alone.  Susan suggests that Kim back off and is defensive about Alison.  Kim and Susan continue sparring.\n\n\nIn the Caribbean, Carly tries to convince Lucy to take the next plane back to Chicago.  Paul, however, decides to let Lucy stay since they are only going to be there themselves for two more hours.  Carly reminds Paul that Lucy has a major crush on him and tells him to be careful.  Paul is the recipient of a big hug from Lucy when he tells her she can stay with them.\n\n\nPaul asks the desk clerk, Ronald Putney, about Rosanna.  Putney says he knows her well, but hotel policy prohibits his telling them if Rosanna left any belongings behind in her room.  Carly turns on the tears and convinces Putney to bring them whatever was left and he brings them paperwork pertaining to Cabot Motors.  On the back of the papers, however, is a phone number with a Miami area code and the name \"De Grassi.\"  Carly then asks for the phone records from Rosanna's room,  and Putney reluctantly pulls them up even though it is against company policy.\n\n\nPilar arrives at the Old Mill and Katie tells everyone about the conversation she had with the  \"RC\" in Pilar's phone book.  She tells Margo that \"RC\" said it would be dangerous for them to meet.  Margo tells Katie to leave Mike and Pilar alone, but Katie will not give it up.  Mike also tells Katie to back off and leaves with Pilar.  Katie calls Henry at Metro.\n\n\nChris tells Alison that he loves her and apologizes for saying hurtful things.  He never wants to hear her talking about breaking up again.  He tells her he could have protected their assets better and that he does not blame her for the loss.\n\n\nKatie confronts Henry at Metro and finds him nursing a terrible black eye at the bar.  Mike did that to him, Henry says.  Katie is horrified until she realizes that the shiner is really makeup.  \n\n\nBack at Mike's, Pilar apologizes for involving the police in the recovery of her book.  Mike asks her who \"RC\" is and Pilar says he is just someone with whom she used to work.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Putney is just handing over Rosanna's phone records when the manager of the hotel approaches and confiscates the records.  \n\n\nIn New York, Craig and Jack wait to see if the mysterious De Grassi will show up again.  Craig continues to nag about Carly's relationship with Paul.  A customer arrives at the pawn shop.....it is De Grassi.\n\n\n",
