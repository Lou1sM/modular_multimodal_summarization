She confesses everything to Mike about her drunken one-night stand with Craig. Mike at first believes Craig took advantage of Jennifer and is furious at the idea, but Jennifer sobs that it was all her fault and that she made the first move. Shocked, Mike sits down and tries to process this information, becoming angry again, this time at Jennifer. He tells her he once did something similar, when he slept with Carly while dating Molly, and he says he now knows how Molly must have felt and why she couldn't forgive him for it. He also wonders out loud what would happen if he and Jennifer remained together and ever had a real fight --- would she run out and hop into bed with the first man she saw? Jennifer, stung by the implication that she is \"a whore,\" tells Mike that at least with that attitude, it will be easier for her to leave him. She packs some of her things, telling Mike that she'll send for the rest and that she will always love him. As she opens the door to leave, Mike shouts, \"Stop!\"\n\n\nCelia, Casey, and Will arrive at Celia and Rafi's place, with Casey asking Celia to go to dinner and a movie with him. Celia says he'll have to ask Rafi, but they find Rafael in a bad mood because he hasn't been able to find another job since being fired from Metro. Will decides to ask Alison if she can try to convince Aaron to rehire Rafael, so that Celia can have some time without her big brother breathing down her neck. Alison says she can't do that, but when Aaron walks in a few minutes later, he complains that he doesn't have enough time to spend with his family in their time of crisis, because he hasn't been able to find someone to help run Metro. Alison suggests that he rehire Rafael, and he agrees that it would be a good solution to his problems. Aaron calls Rafael, who goes to Metro to talk to him. But when Aaron offers him his job back, Rafi refuses, saying he doesn't take handouts. Alison takes him aside and convinces him that he should take the job; he tells her his biggest problem is keeping an eye on Celia, and Alison volunteers to help him do that if he takes his old job back. Rafael agrees and tells Aaron he accepts the job offer. Will is thrilled when Alison calls him with this news, and she tells him that she even got Rafael to agree to let Celia go out with Casey, on one condition: she and Will will go with them as chaperones. Will is happy to hear this bit of news.\n\n\nEarlier, at the police station, Aaron paid a visit to Luke, at Holden's request. Luke, however, is angry with Aaron for having told Holden that he saw Luke burning the gloves outside Metro the night Julia died, which led to Holden turning Luke over to the police. Aaron tells Luke he's convinced that Luke could not have killed Julia intentionally no matter how angry he was, but he leaves having failed to talk Luke out of his confession. Holden then asks Luke to look him in the eye and tell him whether he killed Julia; Luke looks at Holden and says, \"Yes!\" but then quickly looks away, which convinces Holden that Luke is not telling the truth. Luke, however, tells Holden that he can't see the truth just by looking and that all he has is wishful thinking.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Keith has given Jack the letter Lily gave him that purports to be a written death threat against Julia. Jack is in disbelief that the police would have missed something like this letter when they went through Julia's apartment, but Keith tells him that was where he found it. Keith demands that Jack bring Lily and Carly to justice for their roles in his sister's death, and then he leaves. Jack puts the letter in an evidence bag, telling Carly the letter details Lily's plan to kill Julia, but Carly insists the letter must be a fake. If the letter is real, it could result in both Lily and Carly going to jail, because Julia's death would have been premeditated; Jack says he knows that, but he leaves to take the letter to Tom Hughes anyway and try to help get Luke out of jail, if possible.\n\n\nCarly goes to see Lily and tells her about Keith's visit. Lily pretends to be upset that anyone found the letter, claiming that she thought Julia must have destroyed it since no one had mentioned it yet. Carly tells her to save the acting for the others, because she's not buying any of Lily's story. She also tells Lily that she's not going to bring her down with her. Lily continues to pretend that the letter is real, but Carly says Lily could not have done anything that malicious on her own, that she had to lead Lily every step of the way into doing anything nasty to Julia at all. Lily agrees and says it's all Carly's fault that her son is sitting in jail right now, and she asks Carly to leave. Carly leaves, but she swears she will prove that Lily is lying.\n\n\nKeith and JJ are at the Lakeview, waiting to talk to Lisa. Keith tells JJ that they'll be leaving Oakdale in the future, but JJ wants to stay to be near his \"dad,\" Jack. Keith tells JJ that Jack isn't really his dad, but that as his uncle, Keith will always take care of JJ. Lisa arrives and sits down to chat with JJ. At the same time, Carly comes in and asks to speak with Keith. She tells Keith that he's being played, and she wonders if he really wants to get the justice he \"keeps yammering about.\" She tells Keith that she suspects Lily gave him the letter and that Lily is doing this for one reason only: to save her son.\n\n\nBack at the police station, Jack tells Tom that he has new evidence in the case, and Holden wants to see it. Holden reads part of Lily's letter and realizes he can use this to convince Luke to recant his confession. They bring Luke into the room and show him the letter, which he immediately claims must be a fake. But Holden points out that it's his mother's writing, and he tells Luke that if he wants to help his sisters, Faith and Natalie, he needs to finally tell the truth. Jack asks Luke again, \"Did you kill Julia?\" and Luke says, \"No, I didn't kill her.\" At that moment, Lily walks in and says, \"Of course, you didn't; I did it.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
