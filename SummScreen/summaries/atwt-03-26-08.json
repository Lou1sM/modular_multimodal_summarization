Will was surprised by Barbara's diagnosis since she lived such a healthy life, but Barbara explained she got cancer through a strain of HPV.   She told her son about her treatment and that her prognosis looked good, but there were no guarantees she would beat the disease.  Will and Gwen were amazed that Barbara kept her illness a secret for so long and were upset they were not there to help her through her treatment.  Will was upset and worried that he would lose his mother, especially after losing his sister and father in the recent past.   Will and Gwen offered to stay in Oakdale and help Barbara through her treatment, but Barbara was convinced that Will and Gwen were right to want to leave town and didn't want them to stay in town for her.   Barbara told Will and Gwen that she didn't want to stand in their way of a happy life, but Will's only concern was that Barbara gets healthy and tell Paul.  \n\n\nAt the farm, Parker joined Meg in the kitchen and the two discussed the probability that Parker was going to jail for Sam's murder.  Parker explained that everyone knew he shot Sam at least once and there was no way to prove he didn't fire the second shot that actually killed Sam.  Meg tried to reassure Parker that his parents would find a way to clear him, but Parker wasn't swayed.  Parker told Meg that he thought his best bet was to plead guilty and get everything behind him.  Meg called Paul in the hopes that he could help Parker.  Paul rushed over and was happy that Meg had called him to help.  He didn't know what he could do, but agreed to talk to Parker.  Parker was pleased to see Paul had come for a visit and wondered if Paul could offer any insight into what he would face in prison.  Paul told Parker to have faith that everything would turn out alright, but Parker was not persuaded.  He was happy that Paul believed in him and asked Paul for a favor; Parker wanted Paul to help him use his \"feelings\" or psychic \"gift\" to remember what happened the night Sam was shot.  Paul told Parker the only way he could help him was to remind him to focus on that night and stay positive.  Parker thanked Paul's for his help and headed upstairs to bed.  Meg told Paul she appreciated his efforts and Paul explained he had just told Parker to keep his faith.  As Paul got up to leave, Meg offered him a muffin in an attempt to get him to stay, but Paul was reluctant to hang about.  As he walked to the kitchen door, he was shocked to see his mother arriving at the farm. \n\n\nBarbara asked to talk to Paul in private and told him that she was suffering from oral cancer.  Paul simply wanted to know what he could do for his mother and offered to help her through her illness.  Barbara reassured Paul that she was well taken care of and he made her promise to never give up.  After their talk about her illness, Barbara wanted to know if Paul's visit to the farm meant he was back with Meg.  Paul told his mother that wasn't the reason he was there and Paul hugged his mother as Meg looked on.  Barbara left to return home and Meg came out to the porch to comfort Paul and offer her help.  Paul told Meg he was grateful he had come to the farm and she remarked that she was thankful for his visit as well.  Just as it looked like the two would kiss, Paul stepped past Meg and made his exit.  \n\n\nAt their home, Will and Gwen discussed Barbara's diagnosis and rethought their move out of town.  Will reflected on his troubled past with his family, but realized that they were an important part of his life.  He wanted Hallie to know his family and worried that his mother may not be able to fight the cancer since she had suffered such a horrible year, losing Jennifer and Hal.  Will confided in Gwen that he felt his family was followed by a black cloud, but she put him at ease by reminding him that adversity was a chance to make a situation better.  Will and Gwen agreed that it would be best for them to stay in Oakdale until Barbara was well. \n\n\nAt the Hughes's home, Margo, Casey, Alison and Matt were trying to untie themselves after Gerard Nevins had left them all to die in an explosion.  With the timer on the bomb ticking down, everyone was trying to free themselves, but were unable to get loose.   The bomb ticked ominously down to zero and as they prepared for the explosion they were all happily surprised when the bomb didn't detonate.  Everyone questioned if the bomb would be triggered a different way, but while they considered their options, Margo felt Tom would be home soon and could rescue them.  As they sat and waited for Tom, Matt apologized for being part of Gerald's plan and Margo accepted his apology.  Soon Tom arrived home and rushed to untie everyone as Margo explained what had happened.  Margo called the bomb squad as everyone cleared out of the house.  Outside Tom comforted Margo and everyone waited for the police. \n\n\nThe bomb squad told Margo that the bomb had malfunctioned, but had it detonated it would have killed everyone in the house.  Margo turned Matt over to the FBI and reminded him to cooperate and hopefully he could get a reduced sentence.  Susan arrived at the house and asked how her daughter was doing.  Fearing for Alison's safety, Susan asked Margo to put her under police protection and Margo agreed.  The FBI urged Margo and Tom to keep a low profile until they captured Gerald, but Margo and Tom refused to be held prisoner by a heartless criminal. \n\n\nOnce the police and FBI had left the Hughes's home, Margo began to cry because she realized all of this was being perpetrated by the brother of the man who had raped her.  She told Tom, she wanted the entire ordeal to end and then she quickly turned her focus to making her family something to eat.  When Casey, Tom, and Margo sat down to dinner, they paused as Tom offered a prayer in thanks for keeping their family safe.  \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry and Vienna celebrated their reunion with a marathon love making session and only stopped when Henry told Vienna they needed to have a serious talk.  Henry asked Vienna why she gave herself so quickly to Gray, a.k.a Gerald Nevins, and he wanted to know how he could trust her in the future.  Vienna apologized and reminded Henry that she thought he was cheating on her.  Henry worried that Vienna would leave him again as soon as another million showered her with gifts and attention.  Vienna told Henry that she chose him over Gray and that she would try to be faithful from that point on.  Henry was reassured by Vienna's words and asked her to promise to love him and she agreed.   \n\n\nAfter her ordeal at the Hugheses' home, Alison was taken to Al's Diner by Susan for some comfort food.  As the two reflected on the frightening events of that evening, Vienna and Henry arrived and learned that Gerald had held Alison and the others hostage and threatened to blow them up.   They were taken back by the news, but not completely surprised.  Vienna was disgusted that she had been involved with Gerald and worried that he would return to harm them.  Henry reassured her that Gerald would never come between them again and that he forgave her for what had happened.  The two resolved to move on with their life together.  As Alison and Susan got ready to go home, Alison realized her jacket and cell phone were at Casey's house and she returned to retrieve both.  \n\n\nAt the Hughes's home, the family enjoyed a little light television before heading upstairs to bed.  No sooner had they locked all the doors, that Gerald emerged from the shadows ready to exact his revenge on the Hughes family.  He turned the television back on and set the volume up loud to attract the family back to the family room as he hid in a nearby closet.  Margo came down and turned the television off.  At that moment, Alison knocked on the door and Margo let her in to get her coat.  As the two discussed the evening, Gerald snuck his gone out the closet door and fired at Margo.  Luckily, Alison had seen the gun and pushed Margo to the ground.  Gerald came out of the closet and threatened Alison and Margo, but Tom ran in and struggled with Gerald to get his gun.  Margo jumped to her feat and retrieved her weapon from another room and pointed it at the two men fighting for control of Gerald's gun.  Tom lost the struggle and ended up on the couch with Gerald pointing his gun at him and Margo kept Gerald in her gun's sight.  Gerald told Margo to put her weapon down and at first it looked like she might, but when Gerald remarked that his brother had \"always said she was soft,\" Margo aimed her weapon and shot Gerald dead.  The police returned to take away his body and Susan took Alison home. Before she left, Casey asked Alison if he could check on her in the morning and went back up to bed.  Tom comforted his wife and the two were grateful that their torment at the hands of Gerald Nevins was finally at an end.  \n\n\n",
