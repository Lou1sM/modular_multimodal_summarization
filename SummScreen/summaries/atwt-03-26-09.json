Luke reminded Damian how they had parted the last time Damian had come to town when Damian made it crystal clear how he felt about Luke's being gay. Damian asked who Noah was, and Luke explained that Noah was his boyfriend. He ordered Damian to \"get the hell out.\" \n\n\nDamian, calling the boy his pet name, \"Luciano,\" said he hated himself for the mistakes he had made with his son. He deeply regretted how he had reacted to the news that Luke had chosen a lifestyle so different from the way Damian had been raised. Luke yelled that his lifestyle was not a choice, but how he had been born. He asked what Damian wanted, and the man replied that he only wished a chance to get to know the young man that Luke had become. Luke assured his father that was not going to happen. \n\n\nCraig and Carly were having a drink at the Lakeview, and he told her there was no way a robbery charge would stick on Parker. Carly felt she had lost her son; Parker had completely turned his back on her. Craig said Parker still loved his mother and always would. He commented that it could really hurt to see yourself through your child's eyes, but he thought Carly would get her son back. Carly smiled bitterly and said it was shocking that Craig Montgomery was doling out advice on parenting. \n\n\nParker got a call from the District Attorney's office asking him to go to the police station to answer some questions. Liberty was upset that the authorities were going to charge her new husband with robbery, but she hoped Jack would not allow Parker to go to jail. She felt they needed some adult help, and she said she had someone in mind. They both left to go to the station. \n\n\nAt Al's, Jack talked with the District Attorney, Erica, on his cell phone, and then he told Janet that Erica would be questioning Parker in preparation for the preliminary hearing. Janet reminded Jack that Henry and Vienna had agreed not to press charges, but Jack said Parker still took $150 that didn't belong to him. Janet defended the boy, but his father said Parker needed to learn that his actions had consequences. Jack also admitted that he and the District Attorney were going to put Parker through the motions to scare him, but they would go easy on him if he did the right thing. Janet was afraid the plan might backfire, but Jack said Parker only had to admit that what he had done was wrong and be truly remorseful. \n\n\nLily, Holden, and Noah arrived at the hospital and were discussing Luke's accident. They heard Luke yelling for someone to get out of his room, so they all ran in and were stunned to see Damian standing over Luke. Holden grabbed Damian and threw him out, while Luke reassured his mother and Noah that he was all right. Luke told Noah who Damian was, and Noah was speechless. Luke said he wanted nothing to do with the man, and the boys wondered if the foundation money had anything to do with Damian's surprise return. \n\n\nIn the hospital corridor, Lily and Holden confronted Damian. Holden asked why he was there, but Lily realized that it was Damian who had found Luke after the accident and had saved his life. Damian said he was glad he could help, but Holden was more interested in why Damian was in Oakdale in the first place. Lily asked if Damian had seen the accident, and he told them it was a hit and run, and he had noticed nothing except Luke. \n\n\nDamian explained how he had brought Luke to the hospital and written Lily's number so the hospital would know whom to call. Holden asked why Damian had been in Luke's room, and Damian answered that he had just wanted to see his son. Holden resented Damian's calling Luke his son, and reminded him of the pain he had caused the boy previously. \n\n\nDamian explained that he was in Oakdale only to make amends and asked for time with Luke. Holden was still hostile, but he left Lily to deal with Damian as Holden went to sign Luke's discharge papers. Damian tried to call Lily \"Cara,\" but she cut him off and told him he was not welcome there. She accused him of capitalizing on people's weaknesses and vulnerability for his own purposes. Holden returned and told Damian to get lost. \n\n\nCraig and Carly waited for an elevator in the lobby of the Lakeview as Parker and Liberty walked out of it. Parker said he needed to speak with Craig, so Liberty left on her own errand. Parker ignored Carly and asked to talk to Craig in private, but Craig demanded that they include Carly, or he would not speak with Parker. Parker said the District Attorney wanted him to answer questions at the police station, so Carly began calling Jack until Parker stopped her. Carly said the boy needed a lawyer, but Craig said he would handle the situation. \n\n\nAfter Jack left the diner, Liberty entered and asked Janet to get Jack to back off going after Parker. Liberty said they would soon have Parker's trust fund and then she wanted to pay Janet back, perhaps even buy her a house, to pay her back for all the sacrifices her mother had made for her. Janet said she only wanted Liberty to be 17 years old and to make good life choices. Janet considered what the girl wanted, and she grabbed her by the arm, and they dashed out of the diner. \n\n\nLily and Holden went to Luke's room, where Luke was dressed and ready to leave. He could not find the watch Noah had given him, however, and he wondered if it had come off at the scene of the accident. Noah went to Java, but promised Luke he would come to see him as soon as he could. The boys said they loved each other and shared a kiss, as Damian watched from the hall. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Station, Jack discussed Parker with Erica, the District Attorney, and he urged her to be plenty tough on his son. Craig, Carly, and Parker walked in, and Parker became combative with Jack. Craig intervened, telling Jack that Parker had asked for his help and he intended to give it. Jack reminded Craig that Parker had $150 in his pocket after leaving the diner, but Craig said he had given Parker that cash because the kids had nothing to live on. \n\n\nJack asked Parker to tell the truth, as Janet and Liberty walked in. Parker backed up Craig, so Jack asked Janet to tell Erica where Parker gotten the money, and Janet said she thought he had taken it from the open cash drawer, but she had not actually seen him take it. Erica asked to speak with Jack alone. \n\n\nWhen Jack came out of the conference room, he said that he was not arresting Parker because the boy had gotten away with his crime. Parker had won. Jack knew that Craig had not given Parker a dime, only an alibi. He explained how he and Erica had cut a deal, and Parker would never have gone to jail if only he had admitted he was at fault. \n\n\nAt Java, Noah was cleaning tables when Damian walked in. Damian introduced himself and handed Luke's watch to Noah. Noah then realized that it was Damian who had taken Luke to the hospital, and the two shook hands before Damian left. \n\n\nAt the station, Liberty thanked her mother for her help, but Janet said she had only told the truth. Janet told Craig he wasn't helping things, but Craig said he thought her new son-in-law would disagree. Craig and Carly walked out. \n\n\nNoah took Luke's watch to him, as Holden was leaving to go to the farm. Lily was running an errand elsewhere, so the boys could talk freely. Noah said he had gotten a much better impression of Damian when he spoke to him at the coffee shop, but Luke warned him not to be fooled by Damian's lies. \n\n\nLily called Damian and met him at the Lakeview. She asked him to leave town and to stay away. Damian said he could not do that because he was Luke's father. Lily accused him of forcing her to help him push Luke away from being gay, but Damian scolded that she felt that way herself long before he had come into the picture. Lily said Damian gave up the right to call Luke his son years before, but that infuriated her former husband. \n\n\nLily asked if he was going to force his way back into Luke's life again, but Damian denied that. He vowed that he was no threat to Lily's family, so she asked if he was unhappy that Luke was using the Grimaldi fortune in his foundation to champion gay rights. Damian denied that charge, too, and Lily begged him not to undermine Luke. Damian pled for a chance to prove he had changed. Holden interrupted the conversation and suggested that Damian be on the evening flight to Malta. Lily and Holden left, as Damian muttered to himself that he was not going anywhere until he got what he wanted. \n\n\nJanet came back to see Jack and apologized for opening her mouth. Jack said she had done what he had asked; she told the truth. Jack was not upset with her, but he was fearful it was too late to make things right with Parker. \n\n\nLiberty asked Parker if Jack had told the truth about a deal with the District Attorney, and Parker answered that his dad did not lie, so he probably did. He said when he got his trust fund, they would never have to rely on anyone again. \n\n\nCarly poured herself a glass of wine, as Craig lectured her how Jack was verbally abusing her. He said Jack was preventing her from moving on with her life without him. Carly said to hell with Jack, and she drank her wine. \n\n\nNoah asked Luke if he was not being a little hard on Damian, but Luke came back with a remark about Colonel Mayer, Noah's crazy father, and Noah dropped the subject. Luke agonized about why Damian had returned to Oakdale.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Parker gets away with the robbery of Al's Diner because Craig lies to the D.A. and says that he gave Parker the $150. Janet admits she didn't actually take the money out of the cash register. Jack tells Janet and Carly he had made a deal with the D.A. to get Parker a suspended sentence in exchange for an admission of guilt and apology. Jack tells Janet and Carly he was trying to make Parker realize that his actions have consequences but that didn't work. Jack feels defeated and tells Parker he has won that he will stop fighting him. Liberty is concerned when she realizes that Parker doesn't want to make things right with his parents he just wants to get his trust fund so he won't need anyone anymore. Damian tries to make amends with Luke and apologize for not accepting the fact he is gay but Luke is sure that Damian has a hidden agenda and doesn't want him to be a part of his life. Noah tells Luke that Damian was the one that brought him to the hospital and encourages Luke to give his father a chance. Luke tells Noah that Damian is as dangerous as Colonel Mayer and he makes Noah promise to stay away from him. Lily and Holden both tell Damian to get out of town but Damian is determined not to leave until he gets what he wants from Luke.",
