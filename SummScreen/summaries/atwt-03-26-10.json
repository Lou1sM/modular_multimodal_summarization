Parker told Craig that he was concerned because he'd received a recorded message from the bank that indicated there had been increased activity on his account that his debit card was linked to, and there might have been fraudulent activity concerning his trust fund. Craig told Parker not to worry about it and said he would handle it. Carly arrived and asked Parker whether he still planned to go to Minneapolis to visit Liberty that afternoon; Parker said he was just about to leave and would call Carly after his plane landed. After Parker left, Craig told Carly that she would need to wear a gorgeous dress to accompany him to the Monte Carlo event, but Carly told Craig she wouldn't be going with him.\n\n\nCarly took the suit bag she was carrying and went to the police station to ask Jack if he could get ready to accompany her to the Monte Carlo grand opening. Jack was exhausted from his 12-hour shift at the station, but Carly assured him that the open house would only be a couple of hours long. Jack said that he had a conflict. Carly was quick to realize it was something that involved Janet and the baby. When Jack saw how disappointed Carly was, he told her he would call Janet to tell her that he couldn't meet her at her doctor's office for her checkup, but Carly insisted that Janet's appointment was more important. Carly did ask Jack if he would try to show up at Monte Carlo if he managed to get through with the doctor appointment quickly, and Jack readily agreed and told Carly that she was \"the best\" for understanding the situation.\n\n\nLily arrived at home and found Faith sitting at the computer and crying. Lily questioned Faith as to what was wrong and why she wasn't at school, as well as why Faith was wearing the dress she'd seen at Fashions the previous day, which Lily had told her wasn't appropriate for school. Faith tearfully told her mother that she'd worn the dress to school, but the other girls had called her a \"slut\" and were posting hateful remarks on her social networking Web site. Lily tried to encourage Faith to give herself time to fit in at school again, and she told Faith that kids had short memories and would forget all about Faith's faux pas in no time at all. Faith protested that Lily didn't understand because Lily had always been popular and still was, judging from the fact that she'd had Damian and Holden literally fighting over her.\n\n\nParker arrived, but when Faith saw him, she yelled that everything was his fault and then fled from the room. Lily turned to Parker and implored him to help Faith. When Faith walked back into the living room, she asked why Parker was there, and he explained that a teacher had asked him to take Faith's backpack to her. Faith told him that he could leave, but Lily said that she and Parker had been talking, and she thought that Faith should accompany Parker on his next trip to visit Liberty. Parker was surprised to hear that, and when Faith asked if her mother was trying to make her appreciate how trivial her own problems were compared with Liberty's, Lily admitted that was exactly what she was trying to do. Lily then offered to call Lucinda so that Parker and Faith could fly to Minneapolis that afternoon and return that evening. Parker was grateful for Lily's offer, and Faith reluctantly agreed with the idea because she thought Liberty could use a girlfriend to talk to.\n\n\nAfter they arrived in Minneapolis, Lily left Parker and Faith alone in the hospital hallway while she went to sign them in as visitors. Parker remarked that Faith hadn't said much during the flight, but Faith said there wasn't much to say. Parker asked how Lily had found out about Faith taking pills, and Faith said that Luke had told Lily, so Parker wasn't the only one who was snitching on her. Parker told Faith that she had no one to blame for her problems but herself, and he pointed out that they were in a cancer ward, yet Faith was still acting like her problems were bigger than everyone else's. Faith told Parker she could see the \"life lesson\" that Parker and Lily were trying to teach her, and she told him to drop it. Lily returned and said the duty nurse had said that only two people could visit Liberty at a time, so Parker and Faith went into the room together.\n\n\nParker began taking pictures out of the suitcase he'd taken with him. Two pictures were framed prints of various places like Hawaii and Lake Tahoe. The third picture Parker took out was of dogs playing poker, which made Liberty laugh. As Parker began to hang the pictures up, Liberty began coughing. Parker left to get a nurse to administer something for Liberty's cough. \n\n\nAfter Parker had left the room, Liberty told Faith that she was glad Faith was there to visit her. Faith said she didn't think Parker was glad about it, and that it had been Lily's idea for Faith to accompany Parker. Liberty said that without Parker, she didn't think she could have made it through everything, and that Parker was a great guy. Faith looked out the window in the hospital room door and agreed that Parker wasn't so bad.\n\n\nLater, Parker visited with Liberty alone and told her that after she was better, he wanted to go on a cross-country trip with her, driving from New York to California and seeing all the sights in between. As Parker described all the places they would visit, Liberty closed her eyes and told him she could almost feel the sun on her face through the car window. Liberty asked Parker to promise her that if she didn't make it, he would make the trip without her one day, but Parker refused. He told her that it was their trip, and he wouldn't go on it without her.\n\n\nFaith watched Parker and Liberty through the window and then turned away. Lily asked how Faith was feeling, and Faith replied, \"How do you think?\" Lily told Faith that she had wanted Faith to put her problems in perspective, and that it was a good thing for Lily to do, too. Lily said she was blessed to have healthy children, and that she felt lucky, and she wanted Faith to feel that way, too. Faith replied that Liberty was lucky to have someone love her the way Parker did.\n\n\nDusty went to the hospital with Janet, but she told him that he didn't need to stay for her appointment, because Jack was meeting her there. Janet reminded Dusty that he had house keys to pick up. Dusty asked whether Janet had heard anything from her father; Janet was surprised but said she hadn't heard from Rocco since she'd seen him in Minneapolis. Janet told Dusty she was used to not having her father in her life, and he would get used to it, too. She told Dusty that she'd be fine and told him to go ahead and leave.\n\n\nJack arrived and went into the examining room with Janet to speak to her doctor. Jack pulled out a piece of paper on which he'd written several questions about the pregnancy, including when they would know if it was a boy or a girl and when they would be considered to be past the point at which a miscarriage might occur. The doctor told Jack and Janet that every baby should have such a concerned dad and that Janet was a lucky woman.\n\n\nDusty went to Metro to review some paperwork. He called someone on his cell phone and asked whether they had any information about Rocco Ciccone, Janet's father. As Dusty listened, he became very interested in what he was being told, but Teri walked up, and Dusty cut off the caller and hung up his phone. Dusty asked Teri if everything was ready for the catering job at Monte Carlo, and Teri assured him that it was. Rocco walked in and was unhappy to see Dusty. Rocco asked why Dusty always seemed to be wherever Rocco's family was, and Dusty replied that he was the owner of Metro. Teri tried to get her dad to ease up on Dusty, but Dusty told her not to worry about it, and he excused himself and left.\n\n\nAs soon as Dusty had gone, Teri warned her father not to ask her anything about Janet's relationship with Dusty. Rocco asked Teri what Janet's cop husband thought of the way Janet was behaving. Teri told her father that given his long absence from Janet's life, he had no idea of what kind of person she was or what she was going through, and Teri wasn't about to try to explain it to him. She marched out of the room, and Rocco went behind the bar and poured himself a couple of stiff drinks.\n\n\nDusty returned to the hospital, and the doctor walked out of the room and announced to both Dusty and Jack that Janet and the baby seemed to be doing well. Jack asked Dusty if he would take Janet home. Dusty agreed, so Jack left. Dusty went into the examining room and told Janet that he was happy to hear that all was going well. Dusty said he had more good news for Janet, and they left the hospital together.\n\n\nDusty took Janet for a ride and blindfolded her, then helped her out of the car and stood her in front of their new house. When he lifted the blindfold, Dusty told Janet the house was theirs and that they could move in after he took care of a couple of details. Janet said that Liberty would love the house, and Dusty told her he had already sent Liberty some pictures of it. Janet was thrilled that she would finally have a home of her own, and she told Dusty that for the first time in a long time, she felt hopeful. Dusty handed Janet a key on a heart-shaped key ring and told her to check out the house for herself.\n\n\nAs Dusty stood on the sidewalk, Rocco approached and told Dusty that he was \"looking for my no-good daughter.\" Dusty told Rocco that he could tell Rocco had been drinking. Rocco said that Janet had obviously returned her to old ways. Dusty grabbed Rocco by the lapels and told him to get out of there, but Rocco said he had rights because he was Janet's father. Dusty angrily responded that Rocco had lost those rights years before. \n\n\nDusty then told Rocco that he understood that Rocco was still hooked up with Ralph Manzo. Rocco denied it, but Dusty said he knew that Manzo had been greasing Rocco's palm in exchange for using Rocco's business as a cover. Dusty threatened to tell Jack what he knew, and Rocco retorted that Dusty would be sorry he had talked to him that way. Dusty told Rocco that the only thing he regretted was having brought Rocco back into Janet's life, and he made Rocco leave.\n\n\nAfter Janet had seen the house, she returned to the farm, where Teri was waiting for her. Teri demanded that Janet show her some pictures of the house, and Janet happily obliged. Teri was excited to see Janet so happy again, and Janet said it was all because of Dusty. She told Teri that Dusty had been a wonderful surprise, and Teri agreed. Janet then repeated what she had told Dusty about feeling hopeful for the first time in awhile, and Janet said she had a lot to look forward to: Liberty's recovery, moving into the new house, and having the baby. Janet said that since her father was back in her life, it was almost too much. Teri agreed that it might be too much, and Janet asked what Teri meant.\n\n\nTeri evaded the question, and Janet wondered whether Teri was upset or jealous that their father was reaching out to Janet and trying to reestablish a relationship with her. Teri said nothing could be further from the truth. Teri cautioned Janet not to expect too much from their father, but Janet said after years of expecting and getting nothing from Rocco, she truly believed that he had changed and wanted to be a part of her life and her family. Teri pointed out that with all that Janet had to look forward to, Janet should focus on that future, not on a past that she couldn't change.\n\n\nDusty returned to Metro and was looking for Teri, but instead, a strange man approached him and pulled out a gun. Dusty started to hand over his cash, but the man said he didn't want Dusty's money. Dusty asked who had sent the man, Rocco or Ralph Manzo, but the man said it didn't matter, that the person who had sent him was simply \"looking out for his kid.\" Dusty said that meant it was Rocco, and he told the man to tell Rocco that Dusty was cool and didn't want any problems, but as Dusty said that, he grabbed a coffeepot that was sitting on the bar and hit the man in the side of the face with it. Dusty wrestled the man for the gun.\n\n\nAt Monte Carlo, the first guests arrived, and Craig greeted them warmly and offered them food and drink. Carly arrived soon thereafter, and the guests were quite impressed with the original designer dress that Carly was wearing. They told her they would be happy to carry her designs in their stores if what she was wearing was a good example of her work. Craig assured them that it was, and as they walked away, Craig told Carly that she had made a good impression. Carly said she was glad to be someplace where she was appreciated. At that moment, Jack walked in, and Carly rushed to greet him.\n\n\nTeri told Craig that she had found an envelope in the back with his name on it. Craig opened the envelope. Inside was a note pieced together with cutouts of letters from magazines, like a ransom note. The note read, \"Nice party. Enjoy it while you can!\" Craig led Carly away from Jack and showed her the note and asked her who she thought would have sent such a thing. Carly said it was probably a jealous competitor, and she told Craig that he was being \"punked.\" Craig seemed unsure but then told Carly she was probably right, and he asked her not to bother Jack about the note. Carly laughed and said she wouldn't.\n\n\nCraig left the open house and went to the Lakeview, where he met with Ellis and showed him the odd note. Ellis told Craig that as far as he knew, no one had found out that Craig was using Parker's trust fund money to start Monte Carlo. Craig told Ellis that Carly thought another designer was trying to punk him, and Ellis agreed that was a possibility. Ellis suggested that Craig have a drink with him and try to relax. Craig went to the bar to place his order, and as he did, someone watched him secretly. After Craig had finished his drink, he bid Ellis farewell and went to the elevator to return to his room. As the elevator doors closed, the elevator suddenly lurched and dropped down.\n\n\nBack at Monte Carlo, Carly closed the door on the last of the guests and told Jack that the event had gone very well and that she had gotten a lot of orders for her designs. She wondered why Craig had left in the middle of the open house, but Jack said that didn't matter, because the guests had been there to meet Carly. Carly said she'd had a really good time, and Jack admitted he had, too. \n\n\nJack said they should keep the celebration going and head over to Metro to try to convince Teri to make some more of the cheese pastries she'd served at the party, then have dinner somewhere. Carly said that sounded like a date, and Jack asked, \"Have we had one of those recently?\" When Carly said, \"Not that I can recall,\" Jack replied, \"We'll have to do something about that.\" They went to Metro but were surprised when they saw that no one was there. Jack told Carly he would take her somewhere else, and they left, unaware that there was a man lying on the ground beneath one of the tables.\n \n\n\n\nJack suggested they have dinner at the Black Duck in Old Town. Carly was agreeable, and Jack asked why he had been able to make her so happy that day. Carly replied that it was because he'd managed to take care of Janet and still have time for her. Teri walked by, and Jack stopped her and told her that the catering at the open house had been a big success. Teri said she was happy to hear it. Jack remarked that he and Carly had tried to have dinner at Metro and had been surprised to find out it was closed for a private party. Teri said she was sure they were mistaken and perhaps had just arrived a little too early for dinner.\n\n\nTeri left, and Carly asked Jack why he looked worried. Jack replied that he'd had a bad feeling when they were at Metro. Carly told Jack there could be no \"bad vibes\" on their dinner date and that they should go to the Black Duck. Jack agreed, but Carly changed her mind and told Jack he should check things out at Metro to put his mind at ease. When they went back into Metro, there was still no one in sight. Jack told Carly to wait by the door while he looked around. Carly walked over by the bar and gasped in horror. Jack rushed over to her and saw Dusty lying on the ground. He bent down and put his hand behind Dusty's head; when he removed his hand, it was covered in blood.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Carly is disappointed when Jack doesn't want to go to a Monte Carlo buyer party because he wants to go to Janet's check up but she tells him to let her know what the doctor says about Janet's condition.

Craig feels the pressure when Parker tells him that the bank called him because of high activity on his ATM card. Parker wants the password to his trust fund account so that he can check about the problem. Craig tells Parker not to worry because he will take care of the problem. Craig gets very nervous when he gets a note delivered to him at the Monte Carlo which says \"nice party enjoy it while you can.\" Craig talks to his friend Ellis who tells him that he shouldn't worry about the note. Faith has a meltdown when kids from school write slut on the wall of her Facebook page because she wore the sexy dress she stole from Fashions to school.
