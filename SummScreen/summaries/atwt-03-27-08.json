Jack insisted he go with her in spite of his injuries, so Carly drove them both to the Windy City where they prowled the streets. Finally, Carly spotted the woman turning a corner, and the pair confronted her. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Emma made a grand breakfast for Parker and many other members of the family, but Parker couldn't eat because he was worried about going to jail. He wished his parents were there and walked out because he was so upset. Paul intercepted Parker outside and brought the boy back inside where they both ate breakfast. Holden was not pleased that Paul was apparently back in the good graces of the Snyders. It was soon time to leave for court and the decision about Parker's future. \n\n\nLuke met up with Noah to ask him for class notes since Luke would miss class by attending the trial. Noah asked to go with him, joined by Ameera who also wanted to go. \n\n\nKatie was slowly recovering from a monster hangover with some help from Brad who tempted her with coffee and one of Emma's special muffins. Katie was also upset by Jack's delirious ramblings the day before when he imagined he and Katie were still married. Brad and Katie decided to attend the trial. \n\n\nAt the courthouse, the Snyders gathered to await the judge who would resume Parker's trial. Luke confided in his mother that he was not pleased that Noah was spending so much time with Ameera lately. Meg and Paul had a pleasant conversation, surprising both of them, but Meg chose to sit with her family in the courtroom. Tom discussed the previous day's Nevins hostage situation quietly with Holden. The judge called the case and Tom put Parker, himself, on the witness stand. \n\n\nIn Chicago, Jack and Carly interrogated the homeless woman named Ruby Fisk. They wanted to know if Ruby had ever heard Kit confess to firing the shot that killed Sam. Ruby took off, but the anxious couple was able to catch her again. They pled with her to come back to Oakdale with them if she could clear Parker. Ruby admitted that she had a record and wanted nothing to do with cops even though Jack offered what protection he could. Ruby told them she had lost a six-year-old son, and Carly begged her to help save her son. \n\n\nTom questioned Parker about the night of Sam's killing. They talked about how Parker had a feeling that Sam was about to do something awful to Carly and that was why he took the rifle from the farm and went to Metro. He described Sam's attempted rape of his mother. At these words, Ameera suddenly got up and bolted from the courtroom, followed by Noah. In the corridor, Ameera told Noah that Parker's testimony reminded her of terrible things in Iraq. \n\n\nBack in the courtroom, Parker testified how he fired the gun only one time to stop Sam, not to kill him. This represented a change from the boy's original statement. In cross-examination, the District Attorney tried hard to impeach the boy, and the judge called for final arguments. Tom made an impassioned plea for Parker's innocence, while the DA argued that there was no evidence that any other person was involved at Metro that night. The judge called for a recess while he deliberated. \n\n\nIn Chicago, Ruby had a change of heart and agreed to accompany Jack and Carly back to Oakdale and to testify that she heard Kit's confession to killing Sam. On the way back to town, Carly got pulled over by the police for speeding. When the cop heard her reason for excessive speed, he offered them a police escort to Oakdale. \n\n\nMeg and Paul chatted again during the court recess and Meg was grateful that Parker remembered firing the gun only once. Tom was not hopeful of the verdict, however; this judge had a tough reputation. Noah explained to Luke that Ameera had gotten upset because she knew women in Iraq who were raped by men who were never punished. Parker worried that his folks had not arrived yet and was afraid they would not make it back in time to hear the verdict. As the judge returned and announced a verdict of \"guilty\" for Parker, Carly and Jack burst into the courtroom with Ruby and asked the judge to halt the proceedings. They had new testimony, which would shed a whole new light on the killing of Sam. \n\n\nThe judge allowed Ruby's testimony, and she stated that Kit told her that she saw Parker shoot Sam once but that she, herself, had finished him off. Kit was tired of Sam's running around on her. On cross exam, Ruby produced several drivers' licenses issued to Kit in different names and appearances which proved that Kit had several identities and disguises at her disposal. The judge reversed his verdict and released a relieved Parker into the custody of both his parents. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The Snyder family and some friends show up to support Parker as he testifies in his own defense. Parker remembers that he only fired one shot and says he didn't kill Sam. In Chicago Carly and Jack search for the homeless woman who was a friend to Kit. The homeless woman named Ruby doesn't want to testify because she doesn't want to speak ill of the dead. Ruby tells Carly and Jack that her own six year old son died because she didn't have the money to pay for his care. Carly finally persuades Ruby to help save Parker and all three rush to court with a police escort. Tom and the D.A. give closing arguments and then the judge says Parker is guilty of murder. Jack and Carly rush in with Ruby after the verdict and persuade the judge to hear Ruby's testimony in which she says Kit admitted to her that Parker shot Sam in the shoulder and after he ran out of Metro with Carly she went back and finished the job. Ruby also shows the court a fake ID with a different name that Kit had done on the day she shot Sam so the judge reverses the verdict and throws out the charges against Parker. Meg thanks Paul for helping Parker through a rough time Ameera tells Noah that what happened to Carly in Iraq reminded her of how women get raped in Iraq and the men never pay for their crime. Luke tells Noah he did the right thing by marrying Ameera and he is willing to wait to start their future together.",
