Lucy protested that seducing Dusty would be impossible, because Dusty was seeing Meg. Paul reminded Lucy that although her father was dangerous, Paul himself was crazy. Paul left. \n\n\nLucy called someone and told them about Paul's threats to reveal whatever he knew about Lucy's involvement with Craig's vodka shipment. She assured the person she was speaking to that she wouldn't let everyone down. \n\n\nDusty and Meg ate breakfast together in the restaurant at the Lakeview. Meg was concerned about Paul's recent odd demeanor. Paul came downstairs, and Dusty went over to speak to him. Dusty told Paul not to threaten Meg anymore. Paul said that he had not threatened Meg to date; he had simply made his position clear. \n\n\nPaul said no one was going to take Eliza away from him. Dusty stated that no one was trying to do that, and that Meg wanted Paul to be a father to Eliza, as long as he followed the rules. Paul sarcastically thanked Dusty for granting him access to his own daughter, and then made it clear that he didn't follow anyone's rules anymore. \n\n\nDusty asked what Paul intended to do, but Paul said he had nothing further to say to Dusty. Dusty went back to his table with Meg and told Meg that she was right--Paul was acting weirder than usual. Meg said she'd lost her appetite. Dusty suggested they go somewhere else to eat, and they left. \n\n\nCraig went to Carly's and told her that he wanted her to go with him to the docks to watch their first shipment of Midnight Sun be loaded onto the ship for export. Carly declined, saying that she wanted to go talk to Jack and that she was worried about the kids. Craig told Carly not to worry about Parker and Liberty, because he would know if they tried to leave town. Carly was surprised to learn that Craig was essentially spying on the kids, but Craig said it was just his way of making sure his business partner could concentrate on the business. \n\n\nOnce Carly and Craig arrived at the docks, Craig called Lucy to ask if she could pick Johnny up from school. Craig told Lucy where he was and that he wasn't sure what time his business there would be finished. Lucy assured her father that she would pick up Johnny. Carly and Craig went over the manifest and told Cesar, the dockworker, that everything was ready to go. \n\n\nLucy walked up, and, when Cesar said hi to her, Craig asked if the two knew each other. Lucy said no, and Cesar said he was always friendly to pretty girls. Cesar then asked for the manifest, and Carly gave it to him. Craig asked Lucy why she was there. Lucy told him that she had been selected to present a paper at a symposium in Chicago the next day, and she wanted to know if she could take Johnny with her. Craig said absolutely not, but Carly encouraged him to rethink his answer, saying the little trip might be nice for Johnny. \n\n\nCarly reminded Craig that he was supposed to be trying to trust Lucy again. Craig asked how he could be sure Lucy was really going to Chicago. Carly asked Lucy if Bob Hughes knew about her trip, and Lucy said Bob had recommended her for it. Lucy told Craig he could check on that or hire a private investigator to follow her. Craig said he would do something better, by having Johnny equipped with a microchip so that Craig would know his whereabouts. Craig then told Lucy it was a test for her, and Lucy said she would pass it. Lucy thanked her father and Carly and left to go get Johnny.\n\n\nCarly and Craig drank some of their vodka to celebrate their first shipment, and Carly told Craig she thought it had been his plan to get her drunk all along. When he asked why she thought that, she pointed out that he had arranged for a car service to give them a ride home from the docks and for Lucy to pick up Johnny. Carly said that home reminded her of Parker, which made her sad, so Craig picked up the box of vodka and suggested they take the party home with them. \n\n\nWhen they arrived back at Carly's house, they were both quite drunk. Craig plopped down on the couch next to Carly, accidentally sitting on her, which caused Carly to break out in a fit of laughter. They kissed, and, after a moment, Craig stood up and took Carly's hand, saying, \"Let's go.\" She asked, \"Where?\" and he replied, \"To bed.\" Carly laughingly agreed, and they headed upstairs. \n\n\nAt the farm, Jack let Janet know that Tom thought Parker's chances of becoming an emancipated minor were much better because Parker had gotten married. Jack blamed Craig, but Janet tried to make Jack see that they needed to focus on the kids, not on Carly and Craig. Janet said Jack was upset with Parker because Parker reminded him of Carly, in that he had lied to Jack and disappointed him. \n\n\nJanet told Jack she wished that Carly didn't get to him anymore, but she understood why it was so. Janet then said they needed to teach the kids responsibility by backing off and letting them fend for themselves. Jack thought that was what he had done when he had kicked Parker out of the house, but Janet said that hadn't been teaching responsibility, it had been punishment. Jack said he had blown it. \n\n\nJanet reminded Jack that Parker and Liberty had four parents between them, and she thought she, Jack, Brad, and Carly needed to present a united front. Jack agreed they should all discuss it, but he said Craig absolutely could not be there for the discussion. \n\n\nJack and Janet arrived at Carly's. Jack knocked but didn't get an answer. He pushed on the door, and when it opened, he and Janet walked in. Jack called Carly's name. Janet said she would put some coffee on while Jack went upstairs to find Carly. When Jack got upstairs, he opened the bedroom door and found Carly and Craig on the bed, kissing. \n\n\nCarly and Craig asked what Jack was doing there; he said he had knocked, but no one had answered. He saw the vodka bottle lying on the floor and asked if Carly was drunk. Then he asked what Carly would have done if Sage had come home. Carly said Sage was at school, but Jack said school was over. Carly said Sage had an after-school play date, and that Carly wouldn't be up there with Craig if Sage had been around. Craig said, \"Jack, you don't live here anymore, so get out.\" \n\n\nJack stormed off downstairs and told Janet they were leaving. She asked why, but then Carly came downstairs, followed by Craig, who was still putting his clothes back on. Janet quickly understood the personal nature of what Jack had interrupted; she told Carly that she had made some coffee, then she left with Jack. Craig reminded Carly once again that Jack had moved on with his life, and Carly deserved the opportunity to move on with hers. Craig wondered when Jack would finally realize that he had no more claim on Carly. \n\n\nCraig then asked Carly when Sage was going to be home from her play date, and Carly said Sage was having dinner at the friend's house. Craig suggested they go back upstairs and finish what they started, and Carly agreed. This time, however, she locked the door first and went upstairs with less enthusiasm than she had earlier. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Janet asked Jack if he was really upset because one of the kids could have walked in on Carly and Craig, or because Carly had been with someone else. Jack said he didn't care who Carly slept with, but \"the thought of that guy in my bed ...\" \n\n\nJanet pounced and said it wasn't Jack's bed anymore. Jack said it was a force of habit to think of that house as his, but Janet said Jack still thought of Carly as his, too. Jack told Janet he had a right to be mad at Carly, but Janet shouted, \"What gives you the right?\" She then stormed upstairs, after telling Jack that she had the right to be mad at him. \n\n\nLucy ran into Dusty outside Java and told him about her overnight trip to Chicago. She asked Dusty if he wanted to go. Dusty jumped at the chance and said he would meet Lucy at the Lakeview five minutes later. Lucy called Paul, who was at the hospital to have the stitches in his hand removed. She let him know what she had planned and that she was fulfilling her end of their agreement. Paul was impressed by how quickly Lucy had worked. \n\n\nPaul hung up and saw Meg. He asked her to remove his stitches, but she said she would get someone else to do it. Meg said she wasn't going to play his games, so Paul said he supposed that meant she didn't want to know where her boyfriend was going that day. Meg said he was probably at the office, but Paul said he had heard that Dusty was going to Chicago with Lucy and Johnny. He suggested Meg call Dusty to find out if Paul was telling the truth. Meg agreed to call, just to get Paul off her back; she got Dusty's voicemail, which said he was out of town for the day. \n\n\nDusty called Meg to let her know about his sudden trip to Chicago with Lucy and Johnny. Meg thanked him for telling her, and then she told Paul what Dusty had said. Paul was surprised that Meg was okay with it, but Meg said that was what trust was all about. Paul wondered if he should call Craig to find out if he knew about the trip, since Craig was trusting Lucy to keep Dusty away from Johnny. \n\n\nMeg asked why Paul would do something so vindictive, except to try to intimidate her. Paul said he didn't want intimidation; he wanted cooperation. He said that since Meg had no problem with Dusty having access to Johnny, he wanted access to Eliza. Paul suggested that Meg bring Eliza to Fairwinds as soon as her shift ended, and Meg reluctantly agreed. \n\n\nWhen Meg arrived at Fairwinds with Eliza, she soon realized there was no social worker at the house. Paul said that was because the social worker was only needed for scheduled visits, and this visit had been unplanned. When Meg tried to take Eliza back, Paul threatened to call Craig and tell him about Dusty's trip with Lucy and Johnny. \n\n\nMeg wondered why Paul didn't just ask if he wanted to spend more time with Eliza, rather than resorting to threats. Paul said it was much easier to get Meg to say \"yes\" if he made sure she couldn't say \"no.\" He then told her that she was welcome to spend the night with him, if she wanted to make sure he was treating Eliza right. \n\n\nAt the hotel in Chicago, Lucy told Dusty that Johnny had fallen asleep after his big day. Dusty was reading Henry's book, \"The Man From Oakdale,\" and Lucy said it was uncanny how accurate much of what Henry had written about her was. Dusty asked Lucy why she had risked everything by inviting him to join her and Johnny on the trip to Chicago. Lucy said she owed Dusty for having taken Johnny away in the first place. \n\n\nShe said she'd been young and hadn't known whom to trust. She apologized for having been so confused about Dusty before. Dusty said maybe he could have a chance to make up for the time he'd lost with Johnny, and Lucy asked whether she and Dusty might also be able to make up for the time they'd lost. \n\n\nDusty asked Lucy where that was coming from. Lucy said she had loved Dusty for a long time, and that didn't just go away. She said that they were both free. Dusty said he was seeing Meg, but Lucy said that had just started. Dusty said it had started years before, when he and Meg were teens. \n\n\nLucy said that being there with Dusty and Johnny made her feel at home for the first time in a long time. Dusty said he felt the same way and that the day had been wonderful, in part because he had spent it with her. However, when Lucy moved in closer, Dusty said he was going to go lay down with Johnny. He stopped, though, and first told Lucy that he would always be there for her.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Janet and Jack argue. She wants to forget about Craig and Carly and just focus on their kids. She knows he's worried about Parker yes, but he's more worried about Carly and her association with Craig. She thinks Jack is trying to get back at his ex. He hates it when she is right. She says she hates that Carly can still get to him this way. Parker has four parents now and they need to present a united front. This will not include Craig. That would be a deal breaker. Carly is worried that Parker will get his inheritance and leave town. Craig assures her that won't happen. He's keeping them close by so he can keep an eye on them. Lucy tells Paul that she needs more time to get Dusty to sleep with her. He's committed to Meg now. Paul says it's either now or dear old dad will find out about her secrets. So don't even think about double-crossing him. Lucy makes a phone call and states that she will have to do as Paul says as he is crazy by his own admission. Craig calls and says he is caught at the docks with a shipment and needs Lucy to pick up Johnny. She comes to the docks first and is almost outed by a guy, but with a clever spin Craig buys that they don't know each other after all. Lucy finds Dusty and invites him along on her date with Johnny. They make plans to spend the night in Chicago. Paul spies on Meg and Dusty at the Lakeview. Alone Dusty tries to convince him that he can be part of Eliza's life if Paul behaves himself and follows the rules. Paul makes a beeline to Meg to accidentally let her know that Dusty is on his way out of town with Lucy and they will be spending the night. Dusty calls and confirms that he is going to Chicago and he just wanted Meg to know. Meg tells Paul that she is okay with that; it's called trust. In their hotel room, Lucy pours drinks and re-lives the day they just spent. He thanks her for giving him this chance with his son. He knows her dad would disown her if he knew. She's putting her neck on the line. She asks if there is anything else she can do to get to those earlier loving times. He tells her that he will always be there for her, but now he's with Meg. Craig and Carly leave the docks and go back to her house. Drinking and in a silly laughing mood, she kisses him and allows him to haul her off upstairs to bed. Jack and Janet arrive. Jack knocks, but finds the front door unlocked and comes on in. While Janet makes coffee, Jack heads upstairs only to walk into the bedroom at a very inopportune moment. Carly and Jack end up in a shouting match. He spies the vodka bottle and asks how much has she had to drink. He wanted to talk to her about Parker, but he realizes now they can't. Craig reminds him that Jack doesn't live here any more and Carly has a right to do whatever she wants, so he should just leave. Jack grabs Janet and does just that. Janet takes umbrage at Jack for saying Carly was sleeping in \"his\" bed. Craig tells Carly that she has every right to behave how she wants in her own house. He says they should go back upstairs and resume what they started.",
