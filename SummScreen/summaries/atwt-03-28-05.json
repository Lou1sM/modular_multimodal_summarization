Katie kisses Henry and reassures him, then leaves to go tell Mike about Jennifer's infidelity.  Meanwhile, Craig brags to Sierra about how well he and Jennifer are working as a team on Street Jeans.  He convinces Sierra that it is time for her to trust him and to stop feeling responsible for him, and they shake hands and agree to be friends. At Mike's house, Jennifer packs up and is halfway out the door when Mike tells her that he wants to try to get past her mistake with Craig.  The two decide to stay together and try to make things work, even after Jennifer tells Mike that Craig had blackmailed her, threatening to tell Mike if she refused to work with Craig on Street Jeans.  Mike embraces Jennifer as she cries and apologizes.  Mike leaves, ostensibly to get food, but with a steely resolve in his eyes. Alone, Jennifer hears a knock at the door, and finds Katie, who accuses, \"How could you do that to Mike?\"   Craig is on the phone at the Street Jeans headquarters when Mike comes up and punches him!\n\n\nOn one side of the police station, Carly asks Keith to tell the police that Lily handed him the letter, telling Keith that Lily only wrote the letter in order to free her son, Luke.  Carly insists to Keith that Lily did not deliberately kill Julia.  Elsewhere in the station, in front of Jack and Holden, Lily tells Luke that she planned to kill Julia.  Jack immediately places Lily under arrest, in spite of Luke's vehement protests.  Holden watches the police take Lily away with tears in his eyes, then he goes to visit her in her cell.  He asks her pointedly if she deliberately killed Julia, or if she is covering for Luke.  Lily coldly tells Holden that she killed Julia to get him back, and she is just sorry that she got caught.  Tom Hughes interrupts Carly and Keith to arrest Carly as accessory after the fact.  Carly turns to Jack and insists that Lily did not kill Julia.  Jack tells Carly that he will call Jessica, and Jack and Carly sadly kiss goodbye.  After they take Carly away, Tom tells Jack that, as long as Lily's confession stands, both Lily and Carly will go to prison.  The police bring Carly into the cell adjoining Lily's cell.  Carly insists that Lily must tell the truth - \"I'm not losing my husband and my children because of you.\"  Holden returns home and tells Luke that Lily acted as though she had killed Julia on purpose.  Luke insists to him, \"Mom isn't some psycho killer who goes around threatening people.\"  Holden has an idea and goes to the phone saying, \"I think I have a way to help your mother.\"\n\n\n",
