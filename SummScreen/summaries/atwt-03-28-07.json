Gwen and Maddie stick around the cabin to clean up while Will and Casey head into town to check on their fake passports and get supplies.  Once alone the two girls discuss how safe they feel and then scare quickly as they hear approaching footsteps.  The girls peek outside and see nothing and are convinced they probably heard a raccoon.  Maddie heads out to find wood for the fire, leaving Gwen alone to clean up.

Inside Gwen works on cleaning up an old bed frame she found, but is interrupted as the door opens and she comes face to face with Adam.   Gwen screams and asks about Maddie, but Adam tells her he did to Maddie what she did to him and confronts Gwen about her role in burying him alive.  Adam tells Gwen that he was the one who has been haunting her and then describes for her what happened to him when she and Maddie buried him out in the woods.  He tells Gwen that when he first dug himself out of the grave they put him in that he believed that she had nothing to do with burying him.  He goes on to say that he waited for her to return, but when she didn't come back he found her ring and he realized that the person he loved had helped bury him alive.   Gwen apologizes profusely and lets Adam know that she never wanted him to be dead and that the night he was hit was a huge mistake.  As their conversation continues, Adam and Gwen talk about their time together recording her demo and Adam softens his tone and tells Gwen they can share those times again as he tries to kiss her.

Once inside the cabin, Adam throws her to the ground and tells her he wants more with her.

Adam grabs Gwen and tells her that he won't go anywhere until she admits she wants him and he starts kissing her forcefully as Gwen tries to get away.

Out in the snow Maddie begins to wake up.  \n\n\nAt the country store, Will talks to the sheriff about the fake film their scouting as Casey calls his contact with the fake passports and learns he wants additional money to deliver the I.D.s.
