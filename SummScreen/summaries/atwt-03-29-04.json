Before he leaves, Chris assures Alison that he does not blame her for his losing his savings in the condo disaster, and asks her to promise that she will not ask her sister for money.  The second the door closes behind Chris, Alison begs, \"Em, you've got to give me some money.\"  When Alison asks Emily to try to persuade Susan to give her the money from her college fund,  Emily reminds her how young she is.  Alison explains that she feels that replacing Chris' lost money would help her pull her weight in her relationship with Chris.  Next Susan arrives to find that Alison has set up a meeting for her and Emily.  Alison steps outside to give her mother and sister a chance to talk, and finds Aaron arriving to apologize to Susan for his part in Alison's drunkenness the night before.  After they go inside and Aaron sincerely says that he is sorry, Alison throws in a halfhearted apology of her own.  However, Susan refuses to give her the college money, saying, \"That college fund will be used for your education, or it will sit in the bank until you are drawing social security.  I am not going to waste it on a place for you to shack up with your boyfriend - and that's final!\"  Alison turns on the charm, insisting that she has always hated school, and suggests that Susan give the money directly to Chris.  Then Alison apologizes for her behavior the night before, especially because of the way it made Susan feel.  She promises never to touch a drop of alcohol again if Susan will give up the money.  Moved, Susan asks Alison to bring Chris for dinner that night to discuss it.  After squealing with delight, Alison calls Chris and invites him to Susan's for dinner that night, but does not tell him about the money.  When Chris gets the call, he has just finished visiting with Bob.  His dad has advised him to help Alison grow up by introducing her to his doctor friends and their wives and girlfriends.\n\n\nMolly hears from Bob Hughes that there will be a benefit for The Rose Foundation, and muses, \"I don't think I'm invited.\"  Meanwhile, at metro, Dusty, Lily, and Holden are delighted that nearly everyone they have invited has accepted.  Molly arrives at metro and is greeted by Holden, which makes Lily frown at first, but Lily goes up to Molly and graciously invites her to the fundraiser.  Molly, equally gracious, declines the invitation, but offers to write a big check.  Lily tells Holden that she wants to let go of her bitterness and anxiety, and to value her home and family.  Molly comes up with her check as Lily and Holden share a tender kiss.  The two look at the amount of Molly's check with awe, then Lily tearfully embraces Molly in thanks.  After Molly leaves, Dusty takes Lily aside and cynically asks her if she is setting Molly up.\n\n\nWhile Jennifer is at the police station with Hal, she learns that the police suspect that Rosanna has been abducted.
