When she finds Jennifer at home by herself, she learns that not only does Mike know about her night of indiscretion, but Mike has NOT thrown her out and in fact has asked her to stay!  Katie is indignant at first -- \"Do you really think Mike wants you to stay?\" But Jennifer's true regret and obvious love for Mike seem to turn Katie around and they are soon confiding in each other like long lost friends.  When Mike comes home, he is truly surprised to see them talking in friendship.  And when Katie leaves, she tells Mike that she hopes he can forget about what Jennifer has done.\n\n\nCarly is furious with Lily!  Her jail cell is right next to Lily's and she wastes no time in trying to reason with her.  But Lily seems truly surprised that Carly was arrested as \"accessory to murder after the fact.\"  Lily insists that she will not take back her confession, no matter what trouble Carly is in because she believes it is the best thing for everybody.  No matter how hard she tries, Carly cannot reason with her and stops trying.  She calls for a guard and asks for her one phone call -- instead of calling her attorney, she calls Emily!  Her friend comes to the police station with a tape recorder and helps Carly learn how it works and what to say to get Lily to tell Carly the truth so she can record it.  \n\n\nLily has several visitors while Carly is gone.  For whatever reason, Keith believes it necessary to remind Lily that he will see justice is done for his sister and that he is not leaving until it is.  Lily tells him that he has what he wants, she has confessed -- the show is over!  Keith tells her he wants to come to the sentencing to make sure her status in Oakdale society doesn't mean she gets to plea bargain.\n\n\nHolden and Jessica visit Lily, too.  He has enlisted Jessica's help in having Lily found innocent by reason of insanity.  Jessica thinks it may work, but when they approach Lily and ask for her permission for a psychiatric evaluation, she refuses.  Later, Luke asks Holden if his plan to help Lily worked.  Holden admitted that it did not work, and when Luke gets upset, Holden promises to come up with a new plan to help Lily.\n\n\nJack has taken Parker to a coffee shop to try to explain why Carly is in jail.  He tries his best, but Jack seems to be trying to understand the situation even as he tries to explain it.  Parker and Jack agree, however, that Carly made a mistake and that everybody makes mistakes.  Just as they leave, Keith and JJ come in.  JJ is overjoyed to see \"Dad!\"  Keith asks to talk to Jack alone, and when the boys are gone, they talk about the letter.  Keith is surprised that Jack put Carly in jail, but Jack angrily says he didn't have a choice since Keith presented the letter.  However, Jack made sure that Keith knew he thought the letter was bogus because two sets of forensic teams searched Julia's apartment and did not find the letter.  Jack says he has to trust his instincts -- and Keith did not seem surprised or offended when Jack's instincts seemed to tell him he believed Lily did not kill Julia.  But Jack and Keith are going to have to put their personal differences aside -- they have bigger problems!  They are both horrified when Les walks into the coffee shop and announces to a terrified JJ that \"Daddy is here\" and that he is taking JJ.\n\n\n",

Holden contacts Jessica to help with Lily's case and asks her to have Lily plead not guilty by reason of insanity, but Lily refuses. Instead of calling her lawyer, Carly called Emily and had her bring a tape recorder so she can tape Lily telling the truth. In her cell, Carly tries to get Lily to tell the truth so she can record it. Katie asks Jennifer how she could cheat on Mike and makes it clear she plans on telling Mike. Jennifer tells Katie she's already told Mike everything about Craig. Katie is surprised that Mike insisted Jennifer not move out. Finally Katie decides if Mike wants Jennifer there it's good enough for her. Mike punches Craig and tells him it's for sleeping with Jennifer and blackmailing her. Mike tells Craig he has something much worse in mind for him than beating him to a pulp. Mike tells Craig now that he knows there's no reason Jennifer can't tell Sierra and she'll release him from the company. Craig goes to Barbara and offers to allow her to buy back into Street Jeans.",
