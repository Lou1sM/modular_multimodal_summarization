Jade is celebrating her con at home, when Lucinda drops by. Lucinda doesn't buy Jade's poor, little me act and tells her to get out of the house. But then Lily returns and admits that she is allowing Jade to stay - in the guesthouse. Meanwhile, Holden is with Luke, talking his son about how he first fell in love with Lily and confessing that he knows how Luke feels...about Jade. Jennifer gets a note from Dusty telling her he's still alive. She rushes to Hal, who bursts her bubble suggesting that it's all a set-up by Paul and Meg. Jen confronts Meg, who has no idea what she's talking about, but, when Meg hesitates, Jennifer suspects that Meg knows who is holding Dusty hostage. Meanwhile, Emily almost catches Paul trying to call Meg. Hal sees Emily and warns her that Paul is using her. Later, he goes to Paul and shows him Dusty's photo - which the lab says is authentic. Thrilled, Paul says he's recanting his confession. Maddie is at WOAK, screening tapes for a school project, when Casey shows up and she accidentally beans him on the head. Casey wonders if Maddie is still mad about him talking to Gwen the other day, but Maddie insists she's not. After all, it's not like Maddie is his girlfriend or anything...is she? They make out instead of coming to a decision. Gwen and Will drop by the station and Maddie, eager to prove she's not threatened by Gwen, urges Casey to go out and have fun with his ex and her new husband; Maddie has too much work to do.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Holden and Lily plead with Luke to tell them what he is holding back from them, but a setback with him convinces them to tell Luke to hold off on whatever he wants to share with them. In the meantime Luke tells them if Jade isn't welcomed back in their house, when he gets out of the hospital, he won't be going home either. Lily and Holden wonder what Luke was on the verge of saying? Gwen tells Will that she did something that may not make their life easy. She told Barbara where to go when she offered to have a welcome dinner for them. Will is glad she stood up to her, but Gwen is worried she threw gasoline into the fire. Jen reads the note from Dusty begging her not to give up on him. Jen calls Hal who promptly discounts the letter as a hoax most likely from Meg or Paul. When Emily brings a wedding cake to Paul she hints that she feels something may happen soon to change his surroundings, but she will not explain herself. Maddie and Casey agree not to talk about the past. Jen confronts Meg about Dusty's letter and Meg comes close to telling her what she and Paul think, but she changes her mind at the last moment, which was a good thing since Emily was eavesdropping. Lily agrees to let Jade stay, but informs her she is only allowed to stay in the guesthouse. Hal confronts Paul about the Dusty letter and picture when he finds out it is legitimate. Paul excitedly tells Hal he wants to recant his confession.",
