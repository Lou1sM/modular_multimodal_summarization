    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Worldwide, Dusty walks in as Craig is preparing to hold a board meeting; Dusty leaves in disgust and finds Lucinda having a drink at the Lakeview bar. He joins her, and she tells him she's circling the wagons; he tells her the board is meeting with Craig right now. Lucinda says now they know what Craig really wants (to know where Lucy and Johnny are), and that gives them some kind of ammunition to use against him, even though she actually has no idea where they are. When Dusty blames Lily for Craig's takeover of Worldwide, Lucinda says it's her fault, for pushing Lily so hard when she was growing up; she tells Dusty she's going to go find Lily and apologize and tell her she loves her, and Dusty tells her she's a good mother. Dusty returns to Worldwide, where he gives Craig his resignation. Craig thinks Dusty should continue working at Worldwide, so he can see things from the inside, but Dusty says he's not interested. He tells Craig that he didn't win anything, because Lucinda will never tell him where Lucy and Johnny are just to get her business back. Dusty leaves, and as he passes the bookstore in Old Town, he sees Jennifer's reflection in the window; sadly, he says, \"I've lost Johnny.\"\n\n\nAt the farm, Emma tells Lily that Holden called, and he's coming home a little sooner than planned. Lily isn't happy to hear this, wishing she had more time to prepare herself before having to face Holden after what's happened with Worldwide. Emma tries to make Lily feel better, as Faith listens from the porch. When Emma leaves to go check something in the barn, Faith comes in; Lily sees her and tells her she really can't take hearing one more person tell her how she's ruined their lives today. Faith says nothing but walks up to her mother and gives her a big hug, which brings tears to Lily's eyes. They talk about what's happened with the baby food, and Faith is concerned about how her father will react; Lily assures Faith that she and Holden love each other very much, and even when they have fights, they know that they will always be there for one another. Somewhat reassured, Faith leaves, and Lily reaches for more diet pills. As soon as she has taken some, Lucinda comes in. Lily tells her mother she is sorry for what happened with Craig and the company, but Lucinda says she's sorry, too, for having gone on vacation, for not being there, and for being so judgmental. Lily tells Lucinda she can't take back all the things she said earlier at Worldwide, that the damage has been done. Lucinda just wants to know why Lily didn't call her when things were falling apart, and Lily responds that she wanted to try to fix it herself. As Lily moves away from the counter, her diet pill bottle falls to the floor, with the pills spilling everywhere. As Lily scrambles to pick up the pills, Lucinda grabs the pill bottle and says now she has her answer. Lily says it's an over-the-counter drug, but Lucinda says even those can be very dangerous, and she asks if Lily even read the label. Then, Lucinda realizes that Craig probably knew Lily was taking diet pills, and he would have known how that could affect her judgment. Lily insists she doesn't have a drug problem, as Faith creeps up by the door and eavesdrops. Lucinda wants to know how long Lily's been taking the pills, but Lily doesn't give her a straight answer, instead offering her excuses for using the diet pills to make part of her life simpler. Lucinda tells Lily she needs to call Holden and tell him what's going on, or else she'll do it for her. After Lucinda leaves, Faith comes out but sees her mom sobbing, and she retreats back into the other room.\n\n\nAt the cabin, Casey says he has to go back to Oakdale and face the music, but the rest of them (Maddie, Gwen, and Will) don't have any reason to go back or to run anymore, because they aren't in any trouble now that they know Adam's alive and he has agreed to leave them all alone. Maddie asks for some time alone with Casey, so Gwen and Will go to the see the sheriff to pay for the damage to the door of his store. When they get there, Will gives the sheriff $50, and the sheriff tells him to keep his nose clean. Gwen thinks she sees Adam, but when Will grabs the man's shoulder, it's someone else. Outside the store, Gwen tells Will they should probably do what Casey says and go back to Oakdale, because Will's family is all there. Will says, \"You say that like that's a perk.\" He tells her he doesn't care where they go, as long as they don't live in the past. Will tries to kiss Gwen, but she flinches and moves away. She apologizes, but Will says one day, they'll have to talk about what Adam tried to do to Gwen; Gwen says they will, as long as it's doesn't have to be tonight. Will tells her they have the rest of their lives, because he's not going anywhere.\n\n\nBack at the cabin, Casey tells Maddie that he has to go back home, with or without her. Maddie tells him that if he goes back, this might be the last night they get to spend together in a long time. She asks him to play the game, \"What would you do if this was the last night of your life?\" He asks what her answer would be, and she tells him she'd want to make love to him. When he says that this might not be the best set of circumstances for that, she argues that there's always more trouble coming, so why not now. She lights some candles to try to make the cabin more romantic, and she tells Casey he's the kind of man who shows love and patience and forgiveness, and he is in her heart. Casey tells her, \"I love you,\" and she responds in kind as they kiss and lay down on the floor together.\n\n\n\n\n",
