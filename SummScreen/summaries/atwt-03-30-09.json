She was further horrified to find Craig beside her in bed, chuckling over Jack's reaction the night before when he had walked in on them. Craig got dressed while Carly nursed her headache and wallowed in remorse. She remembered that Parker's hearing was to take place in a few hours, but Craig assured her there was no way the judge would not rule in Carly's favor. He left to go back to the Lakeview. \n\n\nParker returned to Liberty in their room at the hotel after sneaking home to Carly's to get his suit for his court appearance. He had also picked up a dress in the hotel gift shop for Liberty, so she could wear it to court and look impressive. Liberty was unhappy that Craig was still picking up their tabs; however, Parker assured her that after the court hearing he would have his trust fund, and they could do as they pleased. \n\n\nAt the diner, Casey met with Alison, who was considering taking summer courses at Oakdale University. She suggested that Casey might like to join her in a class or two, but he demurred. No way, he told her, was he going back to school there. Margo walked in and joined Alison in urging her son to return to school. Casey felt ambushed and defended his noble job as a janitor at the hospital. He and Margo argued loudly until Casey grabbed his coat and declared he was going to work. \n\n\nCraig ran into Parker and Liberty in the hotel lobby, and Parker said he had charged Liberty's dress to Craig's account, but Craig was agreeable. The teens thanked him for all his generosity, and Craig asked Parker a serious question: was he sure that being emancipated and taking control of his trust fund was really what he wanted? Parker hesitated, and Craig bought the kids breakfast and joined them for a while. He further suggested that Parker be really sure that he was seeking emancipation for all the right reasons. Once again, he said he was on the kids' side and promised to attend the hearing. \n\n\nAt the farm, Jack told Janet that he knew she was still angry at him, and Janet said what upset her was his refusal to let his ex-wife lead her own life. Carly walked in unannounced and asked Jack what he had wanted when he had come by her house the night before. Jack refused to discuss it, and he walked out. Carly told Janet that Jack had no right barging into her bedroom, and Janet agreed. She informed Carly that Jack had wanted to work things out with her without Craig in the mix. Then Janet said she had no more time to talk because she had to get ready for court, so Carly left. \n\n\nMargo went to work and asked Jack how she could get Casey to go back to school. Jack laughed and suggested she not take any parenting advice from him. Margo had forgotten that Parker's hearing was that morning, and she apologized. Jack hinted that he had found Carly in a compromising position but stopped short of telling her with whom he had found her. Margo dragged it out of him, however, and when she learned it was her brother, she told Jack to forget about it. They both mused about missing Hal, but Margo suggested that Jack and Carly work as a team for what was best for Parker. \n\n\nCraig surprised Janet as she was leaving the farm, and he asked for Jack. They traded barbs, and Janet accused him of getting in the way of Jack and Carly's being good parents. She told him to butt out of their business and let them be Parker's parents. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Dr. Bob asked to speak to Casey. He told his grandson that the hospital was facing some financial cuts and had to trim the staff. Since Casey was the last person hired by the maintenance department, Bob had to let him go. Casey defended his position, but Bob said it was not his fault, and Bob still believed in him. Casey got upset, and when Bob had to answer a page, Casey stalked off, leaving his mop propped against a door. \n\n\nJack visited Carly and said he was sorry for acting like a jerk when he discovered her and Craig in bed together. He described his actions as a gut reaction that he could not control. He said he and Carly needed to be on the same page as far as Parker was concerned, and Carly suggested he drop his anger and not try to control every situation. Carly's cell phone rang, and she turned down an offer of a ride to the hearing from Craig. She said she was going with Jack, and she hung up and went out with him. \n\n\nIn the courtroom, Parker and Liberty talked with Mr. Schenk, Parker's attorney, as Craig came in. He told the kids he could not stay for the hearing because it was a personal matter between Parker and his parents, and did not involve him. He wished Parker good luck, and left. Carly and Jack arrived soon afterward, and they attempted to talk to Parker to reach some sort of compromise. Parker said he could not do that, and the judge called them to order. Janet arrived and sat with Jack and Carly. The judge reminded all parties that the hearing was informal, but the results were binding. \n\n\nThe judge said he had reviewed the case and pertinent papers, and said Mr. Schenk had petitioned the court to release Parker's entire trust fund and declare him an emancipated minor. The judge asked about the source of the trust fund, so Carly stood up and began speaking. The judge stopped her and asked to hear from Parker instead. \n\n\nParker stood and told the judge that the money had come from his Aunt Rosanna and she had wanted him to have the money, not his parents, who wanted to use it to send him to a boarding school. He insisted he did not want to go to East Lake Academy. The judge was familiar with the school and asked the boy why he objected to getting a fine private education from an excellent institution. Parker replied that his parents were only sending him there to keep him away from his new wife. \n\n\nThe judge continued by asking Parker if he thought that was unreasonable, considering the way he and Liberty had gotten married and their young ages. Parker had no answer, but Schenk spoke up and mentioned Carly's unpredictable temperament. The judge then listed Carly's multiple arrests, her abandonment of her children, a broken bail bond, her fleeing the country, and aiding a known jewel thief. \n\n\nJack spoke up to dispute the facts. He declared that both he and Carly loved Parker and had never touched the trust fund. The judge told Jack to sit down, and returned to questioning Parker. He asked why Parker thought Carly was unfit to be a responsible parent and financial trustee. Parker said it was all in Schenk's petition, and Parker needed to be in control for himself and his wife. The judge called a ten-minute adjournment so he could consider the issues. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison asked Dr. Bob if he had really fired Casey, and Bob explained that Casey was only laid off because of budget cuts. Alison said she had tried to convince Casey to go back to school, and Bob urged her to keep trying. \n\n\nAt the police station, Craig approached Margo, who was surprised her brother was not grandstanding at Parker's hearing to make points with Carly. He said he had backed off and was looking for some positive reinforcement from her. Margo was dumbfounded at his attitude, and suspected that Craig had strong feelings for Carly. \n\n\nCraig told her not to be ridiculous, but Margo declared him a \"man in love.\" Craig denied that and said he and Carly were only business partners and \"very good friends.\" Margo added, \"with benefits,\" and Craig described the relationship as only casual sex. Margo advised him to steer clear of Carly and her family while they were in turmoil. \n\n\nCasey was bored at home, and he began fiddling with his laptop and found a poker site. Alison called and ordered him to meet her in the park right away. When he showed up, she presented Casey with a new skateboard and took off on her own. He followed, and Alison finally stopped right across from Oakdale University, where there was a sign for summer registration. Casey flipped a coin and lost, so he agreed to take a class with her, but he asked to pick the class. Alison agreed, and Casey settled on \"the Fundamentals of African Drumming.\" They went to register. \n\n\nIn court, the judge returned and denied Parker's petition for emancipation, and upheld the existing trust arrangement until Parker reached age 21. The judge continued, however, by saying he was not convinced that Carly was a suitable trustee, and asked for someone outside the family to serve. Parker spoke up and said he had a recommendation, and he named Craig Montgomery. Jack jumped to his feet and pronounced that was not going to happen. Parker said he trusted Craig, who was also his mother's business partner. The judge said he would investigate Mr. Montgomery and, pending approval, would name him trustee of Parker's trust fund. The hearing adjourned. \n\n\nJack and Carly went outside, and a furious Jack said Craig had wanted that outcome all along. He blamed Carly for not putting a stop to Craig, but she cried that no one could have predicted the outcome. Jack asked if Carly had made a deal with Craig while they were in bed, and then Janet intervened and marched Jack out. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker returned to the hotel, and Parker wanted to celebrate. Liberty could not understand why he was so happy, since he had not gotten what he wanted. Parker reminded her that Craig was on their side and would let them have whatever money they needed, but Liberty was not convinced. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet offered Jack lunch, but all he could say was that he could not believe he had lost his son to Craig Montgomery. He was also very sorry that Liberty was under Craig's thumb, as well, but Janet promised to devote all of her energy towards getting the kids to come back, and she asked Jack for his support. He said he was with her, and they hugged and vowed to turn things around. \n\n\nCraig answered his door in the Lakeview to admit a steaming Carly. She congratulated him on winning, and then told him he was her son's new trustee. Craig thought she was joking until Carly asked if he had put the kids up in the honeymoon suite just so he could take charge of Parker's life. Craig swore that he never suspected anything like that could ever happen, and promised never to undermine her as a parent. A disappointed Carly walked out.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Casey is tired of everyone telling him that he isn't living up to his potentially being a janitor at the hospital. Casey is hurt when he gets fired by grandpa Bob since the hospital has to cut its budget. Allison tricks Casey into registering for a class at college but he turns the tables on her by choosing the class which is the basics of the African drums. The judge denies Parker's petition for emancipation but because of Carly's past does remove her as trustee for his trust fund. Parker suggests that the judge appoint Craig as trustee because he thinks Craig will let him do whatever he wants with his money. Carly makes Craig promise her that he won't allow Parker to spend his money on in a reckless way. Margo thinks Craig is in love with Carly but he denies the allegation telling Margo that he and Carly are just friends with benefits. Jack's preoccupation with Craig and Carly continues to cause problems between he and Janet. Janet does finally manage to persuade Jack to focus on Parker and Liberty and how to rebuild the parental relationship between them.",
