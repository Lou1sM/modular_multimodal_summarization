    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLiberty did a live stream broadcast from her hospital bed in Minneapolis, and she mentioned that she would find out that day whether her second round of treatments had worked.  She talked about the ups and downs of life, as two teen girls snubbed Faith, who was walking in Old Town with Holden.  Then Liberty spoke of how parents protected their young and kept them safe, as Craig talked to Johnny about speaking with strangers at school.  Next, the girl said how difficult her illness had been on her mother, as Janet, in her hospital gown, worried about Dusty and admired her engagement ring.\n\n\nJack showed up to be with Janet and helped her back to the exam room where the obstetrician was going to examine her again.  Liberty explained how she had originally opposed her mother's pregnancy, but she had begun to realize that a baby was still a blessing.  She said very soon a guy she barely knew would tell her if she had a chance to live.  Whatever he said, Liberty's life would change, and she would have to deal with it.  She signed off by saying, \"Wish me luck.\"\n\n\nParker sat with Liberty and assured her that she was going to get nothing but good news.  Liberty was glad that her friend was there, but she worried why her mother wasn't there as she had promised to be.\n\n\nWaiting for her obstetrician, Janet complained that she should not be in a bed in Memorial Hospital when she should be in Minneapolis with her daughter.  Jack offered to call Parker, who was with Liberty, to see if there was any news, and Janet agreed, but she cautioned him not to mention Dusty's shooting.  Jack took out his phone, which then rang with a call from Parker.  Parker asked about Janet and why she wasn't there with Liberty, so Jack handed the phone to Janet.  Janet asked to speak with Liberty, and she told her daughter she was stuck in Oakdale because of \"fog.\"  Janet asked the girl to \"stay positive,\" and to call her as soon as they had any news about her treatments.\n\n\nLiberty's doctor finally arrived at her room and went over her chart carefully.  Liberty quipped that if cancer didn't kill her, the suspense would.  The doctor said that her blood count was much improved, almost to normal, so the treatment was obviously working.  Parker asked if Liberty needed to still be in isolation, and when the doctor zipped open the bubble, Parker asked if he could give Liberty a hug.  \"If she wants you to,\" the doctor said with a smile.  Parker jumped on the bed and hugged his friend.\n\n\nAt Carly's, Molly paid a visit, but she was actually looking for Jack.  She wanted to do a story about Dusty's shooting, but she had missed him.  Carly said Jack was already at the hospital with Janet.  When Molly asked how her cousin was handling the crisis, Carly answered, \"One step at a time.\"  Molly asked if Carly trusted Jack, and Carly said that Jack was so honorable that he would do the right thing by Janet and the baby.  Molly asserted that she was there to keep Carly on the right path.\n\n\nCarly said that Molly couldn't be too pleased about all the family obligations Holden had that pulled him back to Lily, and Molly said both she and Carly needed a weekend away.  Carly said she couldn't possibly get away, and then Craig walked in, saying that the door had been unlocked.  He told Carly that they had a meeting that morning, so Molly said her goodbyes.  Craig said Carly looked as if she were about to explode, and he checked out her sketches.  He remarked that Carly had eight unfinished sketches, but nothing to take to manufacturing yet.  Carly drew a bow on one dress and said the meeting was over because she had to go to the hospital to support Jack.\n\n\nCarly arrived at Memorial and ran into Craig again, who claimed he was \"looking after\" his investment.  He said everyone had someone to support him except Carly, so that was his job.  Carly walked into Janet's exam room and found both Janet and Jack listening to their baby's heartbeat.  She realized that she was intruding on a private moment, so she retreated and told Craig that she was \"talked out,\" and wanted to be alone.\n\n\nFaith and her dad sat outside in Old Town and drank cappuccinos. She told Holden that the girls who had snubbed her were \"totally lame.\"  She claimed not to care how they treated her, but Holden could see that she was hurting.  He tempted her with the offer of her favorite chocolate chip cookies from Al's, and Faith agreed that she would like one.  Holden left to get the cookies, and Gabriel walked by.  Faith jumped up, but Gabriel remarked that he was having a very bad day.  He said that his good deed of helping Faith steal a dress from Fashions had gotten him fired.  He said he would manage, but Faith felt very guilty.\n\n\nHolden returned, and Faith introduced him to her friend.  She also said that Holden should hire Gabriel, who was looking for a job. Faith lied that Gabriel used to live in Oakdale, but he had moved away and only recently returned.  Gabriel said that it was not necessary to give him a job, and he walked away.  Faith and her dad returned to the farm, and as they walked into the kitchen, the girl accused him of \"scaring off\" Gabriel.  Molly was pouring coffee, so Faith appealed to her as a referee.  Holden noticed some discrepancies in the girl's story, and he demanded to know what was going on.\n\n\nFaith said that Gabriel was working at Fashions but he got in some trouble that wasn't his fault and got fired.  Holden pinned her down and Faith said she had \"accidentally\" put a dress in her purse to try on, but she had forgotten it and had walked outside with it.  Unfortunately, Gabriel had gotten fired for stealing the dress.  Molly questioned why the security alarm had not sounded when Faith left the store, but the girl threw up her arms in disgust and stormed out.  Both Molly and Holden realized that Faith had stolen the dress, but Gabriel had taken the heat.  Molly asked to speak with Faith first, and Holden agreed.\n\n\nMolly and Faith sat on the porch, and Molly said she needed Faith to talk with her.  Faith said that her dad was being \"totally unfair,\" but Molly disagreed.  She said Faith had stolen a dress, and the teen admitted it.  Faith said she felt awful that Gabriel had lost his job because of her, but Molly asked her why Holden should trust someone who had helped Faith steal a dress.  Faith wanted to make up for it, but she didn't know how.  Molly had an idea, and she asked to borrow Faith's phone.\n\n\nCarly went to the Monte Carlo office and found a congratulatory bottle of wine addressed to Craig.  Carly could not keep her eyes off the bottle, and she finally picked it up and realized it had a screw top.  She laughed at the irony of that, and she opened it and smelled the wine.  Then she poured some into a coffee cup and was about to drink it when she heard someone knock.  Gabriel walked in and said he had gotten a call from someone about a job at the fashion company.  \n\n\nCarly was confused until Molly ran in and explained that Gabriel was a friend of Faith's who needed employment, and Carly had remarked that she needed a staff at Monte Carlo.  Gabriel gave his pitch, and Carly agreed to hire him, although she was still reluctant.  Gabriel promised to be there the next morning, and he made his exit.  Molly noticed that her cousin was a bit \"shaky,\" but Carly said she just had a lot on her mind.  After Molly left, Carly dumped the wine into the trash.\n\n\nHolden joined Faith on the porch, and he explained that he asked so many questions of her because he and Lily were worried about her.  Faith apologized, but her dad said that she needed to trust them.  The girl admitted that she could relate to Holden, but not to her mother.  Faith was unhappy about Liberty's situation, and she called herself a \"screw-up and a trouble maker.\"  She cried and her father comforted her.  \n\n\nMolly returned and told them that Carly was going to give Gabriel a shot at a job.  Faith explained to Holden that Molly had convinced Carly to hire Garbriel at Monte Carlo.  Holden thanked Molly and called her a \"peacemaker,\" and they kissed.  Then he left to find Lily and fill her in on the latest developments.\n\n\nThe doctor dismissed Janet, just as her phone rang.  The caller was Liberty with her good news, and she asked when her mom could get there.  Janet said that she was sorry but she had fibbed to Liberty until the girl had some good news under her belt.  Janet explained that a robbery gone bad had resulted in Dusty's being shot at Metro.  She reported that her fianc\u00e9 was unconscious, but he was stable.  They hung up, and Jack said that Janet needed to go home and rest, even though she wanted to stay at the hospital to be nearby when Dusty wakened.\n\n\nJanet also told Jack that she didn't think she had a home any longer.  He said she would stay with him at Carly's, but Janet still wanted to be by Dusty's side.  Jack said that was too stressful for her, but Janet reminded him that he hadn't even checked with Carly about the living arrangements. Jack won the argument and drove Janet home with him.  Carly walked in and was surprised to find Janet there.  She was gracious and told Janet she was welcome, and then she went to the kitchen to prepare some food.  She took a cucumber and a huge knife, and she mutilated the vegetable on her cutting board.\n\n\nCraig approached the building that housed Monte Carlo, but he thought he saw someone following him.  He called out to whoever it was to \"stay the hell away\" from him.  The man ran off, and Craig gave chase, but he lost the man in the parking lot.  Craig turned back, and after a while, Gabriel stood up from behind a parked car.\n\n\nLiberty told Parker that her mom must be \"going nuts\" worrying about Dusty.  She reasoned that since she was out of her bubble, she could have her treatments anywhere.  Parker was more concerned that Liberty should stay put, and he said he wouldn't help her get out of the hospital in Minneapolis.  He thought she should see her treatment through to the end right there.  Liberty agreed, and then she asked him to get her a soda.  When Parker left the room, she called Faith and asked for Faith's help to get home.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liberty gets great news from the doctor her blood count is up to almost normal so she can get out of the isolation bubble. Janet is thrilled when Liberty tells her the news but tells her she can't go to Minnesota to see her right now because Dusty has been shot and is recovering from his injuries. Liberty wants to go home and be with Janet and asks parker to help her but he refuses telling her its better for her to wait until she is in remission. Liberty calls Faith and asks her to help her get back home to Oakdale. Craig tells Johnny that if he sees the man who talked to him at school he should tell his teacher to call him right away because it is important for him to be safe. Craig senses someone following him and tells the person to come out and vows to find out the person's identity. Craig tells the person to stay away from Johnny and chases after the person but the person gets away from him. The audience sees Gabriel a short distance away from Craig. Gabriel tells Faith that he lost his job at Fashions because he helped her steal the dress that Lily didn't want her to wear to school. Faith later admits to Holden and Molly that she stole the dress and she feels badly Gabriel got fired because of her. Faith asks Holden to give Gabriel a job at the farm but Holden is suspicious of Gabriel because Faith likes him and he doesn't know much about him. Molly saves the day by persuading Carly to give Gabriel a job in the Monte Carlo Office. Faith cries and tells Holden that she is sorry she has caused him and Lily so much trouble and when she thinks of Liberty she feels badly that she doesn't appreciate being healthy and all she keeps doing is messing up her life. Carly tells everyone she is fine but the pressure of her situation with Jack and Janet keeps building as she fears that if Dusty doesn't survive Jack will do the right thing by Janet an the baby even if it kills him. Carly almost takes a drink when she finds a bottle of Champagne in the Monte Carlo office but she is interrupted by Gabriel who arrives for his job interview. Janet gets out of the hospital and Jack persuades her to stay with him and Carly until Dusty recovers. Carly arrives home and finds Jack and Janet there and jack asks her if Janet can stay with them. Carly tells Jack it is fine but takes out her anger by chopping up some food as she fixes something to eat for all of them.",
