    "soap_central": "\n\nHappy 50th Anniversary to \"As The World Turns\"! In celebration of this milestone in television history, the show today showcased most of the actors in sitcom roles loosely based on their family histories. Maddie, who is supposed to be studying by herself at WOAK, is watching an episode of \"Gilligan's Island\" that she found among some videotapes at the station. Casey, Will, and Gwen return from Java and bust Maddie for watching TV instead of getting her work done. Maddie tells them that her project --- to write a report on Oakdale family histories --- has her completely turned around because of all the odd things that have happened to the families and the interrelationships they've formed. Casey, Will, and Gwen tell Maddie to think of the families as different sitcoms, and they begin.\n\n\nMaddie is confused about the relationship between Holden, Lily, Emma, and Iva, and the others try to explain to her about Iva being adopted, so that Lily isn't really married to her uncle, even though it looks that way on paper. When Will tells her the Snyders are basically a farm boy (Holden) who married a rich girl (Lily), he gets the idea to use the \"Beverly Hillbillies\" as an example, and thus is born \"The Snyder Hillbillies,\" featuring Holden (Jed Clampett), Lily as his wife, Lil' Luke (Jethro), Meggie May (Meg as Elly May), and Ms. (Lucinda) Walsh (Miss Jane Hathaway). Holden and Lily encounter Meg(gie) in the barn with \"Pancho\" (Paul Ryan), kissing in the hay. Meg talks Paul into agreeing to marry her, and they announce their engagement at a family dinner. After dinner, Luke and Holden come back in with a wanted poster showing \"Pancho\" as Paul Ryan, a wanted man, and they chase him out with a shotgun. Ms. Walsh tries to talk Lily into attending a charity gala, but in the end, Lily bows out, telling Holden she has everything she wants right there on the farm.\n\n\nGwen tells Maddie about Carly's latest attempts to help Jack by drugging Nick, and she refers to Carly as a scheming blonde, devoted to her husband, who is constantly getting into trouble trying to help him. This makes them think of \"I Dream of Jeannie,\" and we are treated to an episode of \"I Dream of Carly,\" with Carly (Jeannie), Jack (Tony Nelson), Nick (Roger Healey), and Lisa (Amanda Bellows, Dr. Bellows' wife). In this spoof, Jack is in his astronaut uniform, preparing to go on a mission to the moon, when Nick arrives and tells him that he's been chosen to go instead of Jack because of some medical concerns. Jack takes it well, but Carly doesn't, and Jack yells at her not to go interfering and using magic to try to help him again; she promises not to, and Jack goes outside to follow Nick back to work. Inside, Carly uses genie magic to get Nick to come back to her house, where she turns him into a rat. Lisa shows up and tells Carly that she's so sorry to hear that Jack can't go on the mission, but her husband the doctor just can't let him go. Lisa then hears a tiny \"Help me!\" and realizes it's coming from the caged rat. Carly gets her out the door, but she hears Jack returning home, so she turns Nick back into Nick, telling him he won't remember any of this. When Jack walks back into the house, Nick tells him he's decided that Jack deserves to go on the moon mission, and he leaves, as Jack says to Carly, \"See? Good things CAN happen without magic!\"\n\n\nWill insists his family is more like a horror movie than a sitcom, but they come up with a parody of \"The Munsters\" called \"The Munsonsters,\" with Hal as Herman Munster, Barbara as Lily, Will as Eddie version 1, Paul as Eddie version 2 (the werewolf-changing Eddie), Jennifer as Marilyn, Bob as Grandpa, and Kim as ... well, Aunt Kim. Jennifer brings home her date, Dusty, and leaves him momentarily to go get Johnny. Paul comes in and tells Dusty he's Jennifer's brother and that he's very protective of her, then he begins to change into a werewolf. Barbara comes back into the room and offers Dusty a drink, but he chokes upon hearing it contains eye of newt. Hal comes up behind him and tries to help him past his choking spell, but when Dusty gets a good look at Hal/Herman's face, he freaks out. Jennifer comes back in with Johnny, but Dusty says he can't stay, and he leaves as fast as he can. Barbara and Hal console Jennifer about her bad luck with men, when Bob and Kim arrive. They tell Jennifer she just has to wait for that special someone to come along. They all hear an explosion from the basement lab, and Will comes upstairs, saying he was trying to make a potion to get rid of someone from school who was making fun of him. Just then, Paul comes back in, telling his family that he's engaged, and he brings in Emily, dressed identically to Barbara as \"Lily Munster.\" Barbara is thrilled to see someone so much like herself and welcomes her to the family, as Hal tries to kiss Emily's arm while Paul tries to fight him off.\n\n\nAfter this, the teens ask Maddie to describe her family, but she says she really only has Henry, so he'd have to play every role in the sitcom. Casey asks about Katie, and Maddie agrees that Katie and Mike would probably have to be in it, and they come up with \"I Love Katie,\" an \"I Love Lucy\" parody with Katie (Lucy), Mike (Ricky), Henry (as both Fred and Ethel/Henrietta), and a supporting cast that includes Jessica as a sophisticated acquaintance. In this episode, Mike tells Katie he has to go to Latvia to help as a translator, and Katie tells him she wants to learn to drive a car; he says that as the master of the house, he refuses to let her learn to do this. After he leaves, Katie tells Henrietta that she wants to learn anyway and has time since Mike will be gone for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks, Katie and Henrietta come back home, with Katie having crashed the car. Henrietta insists that Katie must have hit a person, because \"she\" heard a yell, but Katie denies it, and they hide parts of the car around the house. Katie convinces Henrietta to tell the police that \"she\" witnessed an accident and to give the police a fake license tag number. Mike and Henry come in then, with Mike having just returned from Latvia and having been hit by a car that didn't stop to render aid. Henrietta goes through with the plan to give the police a false report, but then Katie is at the police station when Mike and Henry come in, saying the police have traced the license tag and are bringing in the hit-and-run driver --- who turns out to be Nancy Hughes. When they return home, Mike and Henry listen to Jessica explain that Nancy Hughes couldn't possibly have been the driver, and she thanks Mike for dropping the charges against Nancy, then leaves. Mike sits on the sofa and realizes there is a large car part hidden under it, and that makes them realize that Katie must have been the hit-and-run driver. Mike and Henry end up having Katie and Henrietta put in jail for their actions, to teach them a lesson.\n\n\nAfter this episode, Casey tells the other teens that one time, Katie did indeed hit Mike with a car and then Nancy was blamed for it, because her car tires and Katie's were the same kind. They don't believe him, even though it's true!\n\n\nGwen says the teens need their own sitcom version, and they decide on \"Happy (Oakdale) Days,\" with Will as the Munz (Fonzie), Gwen and Maddie as Laverne and Shirley, Casey as Richie Cunningham, and Tom and Margo as his parents. In this spoof, Casey is having trouble getting girls interested in him, so the Munz says he'll give him some advice: don't act interested, just ignore them, and the girls will come to him. He then offers to set Casey up with a girl and go on a double date. Casey goes home and tells his parents about the plan, and Margo disapproves of the advice Will gave Casey, but Tom says it's true. Casey and Will get to the diner, where Gwen has just given Maddie similar advice about ignoring the guys and acting like she's not interested. They all then pretend to not be very interested in one another, but Gwen realizes Casey is the boy she's gone too far with once, even though she didn't really like him that much. She tries to sneak out, but Will stops her and tells her he has a past, too. They end up dancing, while still ignoring one another by standing about as far apart as they possibly can, while Maddie and Casey realize they're interested in each other and begin to dance, too. \n\n\nAs this episode ends, the teens, back at WOAK, split off into couples, and as Casey and Maddie hug and kiss, Gwen tells Will she wants things to still be this great in 50 years; Will promises her \"happy endings always, for all of us.\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Today and Monday mark two special anniversary shows commemorating ATWT 50 years on TV as of April 2. This momentous show was not your average show and plot line. This show takes a comic look at the Oakdale's most influential families. It begins as Maddie is preparing for her school project and Will, Gwen and Casey help her put a unique spin on how each family is seen in a whole new light. First up is the Snyder's, who are shown in a black and white type of skit called the \"Snyder Hillbillies\". It shows a poor but proud Lily and Holden. Lucinda appears as a snooty businesswoman and a there is a misguided Meg who always brings home the wrong guy, and this time is no different when her new boyfriend proposes only to be uncovered as none other then a wanted Paul Ryan in disguise. Next up is \"I dream of Carly\" depicting her family. We see Carly as a genie and Jack as an astronaut excited at the possibility of being the first to walk on the moon. A dapper dressed officer Nick interrupts only to disappoint Jack by informing him he was given the green light to lead the mission to the moon. A heart broken Jack leaves and Carly uses her genie powers to turn Nick into a rat so Jack will be given the chance to head up the mission. Jack gets the nod thanks to wife's genie nod of the head to change Nick into a rodent and all the while Jack thinks magic had nothing to do with it (wink). Will's family follows and they resemble the \"Munster's\". We see Barbara and Hal as Lily and Herman. Jen, whose character is Marilyn, brings home Dusty, who runs from her in the end, thanks to Paul scaring him off. Jen worries why men never stick around? Will makes an appearance in the end as Eddie. Next up are Katie, Henry and Mike. The gang comes up with \"I love Katie\" as a sitcom representing them. We see Katie as Lucy and Mike as Ricky. Katie wants to learn how to drive but Mike forbids it, so when he leaves town on a trip, Katie enlists Henrietta's (Henry) help. Disaster of course ensues when Katie hits Mike, who has come home early, with her car , and then she and Henrietta try to cover it up. The plan goes awry when Nancy is brought in as the suspect and Mike finds the hidden damaged fender. In the end, Katie and Henrietta end up in jail. Finally, the four musketeers come up with a sitcom showcasing their lives. It is \"Happy Days\". Casey is the football player and Will the leather coat wearing biker and Gwen and Maddie portray Laverne and Shirley. The foursome all get together and share a happy ending. The final scene shows them agreeing that they all want to live in that sitcom and for it to still be great 50 more years from then!",
