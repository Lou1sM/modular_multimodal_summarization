Katie was fixated on making sure Vienna was not eating sushi or dyeing her hair while she was pregnant, and Brad was trying to figure out how to make sure his son was an all-star place kicker. Henry called, and Katie immediately assumed something was wrong, but he was only inviting them to lunch. \n\n\nVienna scolded Henry for not telling Brad and Katie on the phone that there was no baby, but Henry reminded her that they had decided to broach the subject to Brad and Katie in person. Vienna felt sick to her stomach, so Henry told her to relax. He was sure she would feel better when they told Brad and Katie the truth. The four friends met in the Lakeview lobby, where Katie presented Vienna with a photo album for the baby. \n\n\nVienna felt a wave of nausea and dashed for the rest room. The others sat in the lounge and waited for her return. Henry was remarkably silent, and finally Katie pounced on him and asked what was wrong. He babbled about his book, The Man from Oakdale, until Katie demanded to know what he wasn't telling them. Henry suggested they wait for Vienna for that discussion, and he ordered a double martini. \n\n\nNoah was worried when Luke showed up at Java. He told his boyfriend that he should still be recuperating from his head injury caused by the hit-and-run accident. Luke said that Kim had called to say a donor had contacted WOAK and offered to fund a series of public service announcements against housing discrimination locally. Luke wanted Noah to go with him to meet the donor, so Noah decided to take an early lunch. \n\n\nThe boys arrived at the television station, and Luke mentioned he would not be surprised to learn that Damian had arranged the car accident, but Noah could not believe that Damian would hurt his own son. Luke cautioned Noah not to trust Luke's birth father. \n\n\nKim found the boys and said they would be starting the service announcements soon, but first they had to meet their benefactor. Damian Grimaldi walked out of Kim's office. Luke accused Kim of setting him up, but she said she was only thinking of the benefits to the public. Luke refused to discuss the project with his father, who told the boy he should consider what was best for his cause. \n\n\nLuke told Damian to stay far away from him, and he walked out. Noah followed him, and the boys returned to Java. Luke was furious at Damian, but Noah was more disappointed that the announcements would not go out. Luke flatly refused to take Damian's money. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Holden and Lily talked with Margo about the hit-and-run. She told them there were no leads at all, and no eyewitnesses. Lily suggested the accident could be unrelated to Luke's public appearances, but Holden thought differently. Margo cautioned them to keep a low profile until the police found out who the driver was. \n\n\nHolden threw out Damian's name as a possible suspect, but Lily disagreed. Margo asked if it was possible that Damian wanted the foundation money back because he did not like the cause Luke supported, and Holden thought that was plausible. Margo told them to be alert, and Holden said fortunately he did not have to play by the strict rules that Margo did. \n\n\nLily and Holden went home and continued their discussion about Damian's involvement. Lily had faith that Margo would find whoever was responsible, but she doubted it was her ex-husband. The two of them hugged and kissed, and suddenly Lily noticed that Damian was watching them through a window. \n\n\nHolden threw open the door and accosted him, but Damian said he was only there to speak to Lily about Luke. Lily invited him in, and Damian explained he had tried to fund the public service announcements, but Luke had refused. He asked Lily to convince their boy that he only wanted to help. Lily said she believed the announcements would be a terrific boost to their cause and offered to call Luke right away. \n\n\nLuke and Noah returned to Java, and Luke was furious. Noah was disappointed that the announcements would not air, but Luke again refused to take his father's money. He answered his phone, and it was his mother, telling him that Damian was at the house and wanted Luke to know he had no secret agenda; he simply wanted to make a contribution to the foundation. She also asked Luke to meet her immediately at WOAK, and he agreed, even though Lily sounded mysterious. \n\n\nAfter she hung up with Luke, Lily told Damian that she and Luke were going to do the public service announcements after all, but she was going to pay for them with her own money, not Damian's. Damian was angry and told Lily that she couldn't treat him like that, but Lily said, \"Sure, I can!\" and opened the door and wished him a safe trip back to Malta. \n\n\nVienna finally returned to the group, and she was all smiles and blaming morning sickness for her problems. Henry looked confused, because it was their plan to tell Brad and Katie that the insemination had not worked. Katie and Brad demanded to know what was going on, so Vienna suddenly said that the baby might be twins. Henry was stupefied by that remark, and he suggested he take Vienna upstairs for some rest. \n\n\nVienna argued that she felt wonderful, but Henry insisted and dragged her to the elevator. Katie told Brad she was convinced something was wrong because of the weird way Henry was acting. She was afraid Vienna wanted to keep the baby, but Brad reminded her that their friends had signed a legal agreement to give up the baby. Besides, he said, Vienna and Henry were their dearest friends and he trusted them. He suggested they go upstairs and ask them if anything was amiss so Katie could put her mind at ease. \n\n\nIn their hotel room, Henry yelled at Vienna that she was supposed to tell the Snyders that she was not pregnant, after all, not a goofy story about possible twins. Vienna happily announced that she was pregnant because she knew her body and she could feel that she was with child. Henry said there was no way she could be pregnant unless...the baby was his! He thought Vienna's mind was playing tricks on her, so she offered to prove it. She got out a pregnancy test, and, with a grin, she disappeared into the bathroom. \n\n\nBack at Lily and Holden's house, Damian peeked in the windows again, but could not find anyone there. Then he tried the door. When Lily and Holden arrived home a bit later, they found the inside of their house trashed, and muddy footprints all over the hardwood floors. The maid had heard nothing, but she had noticed a man in the garden wearing a black coat and a gray scarf, just what Damian had been wearing earlier. Holden called Margo and gave her the information. He also included a description of Damian's clothes. \n\n\nAt Java, Luke returned and gave Noah the good news about the service announcements. Damian surprised them by walking in, and Luke confronted him. His father said he was leaving for Malta and said goodbye to the boys. He walked out, and it was then that Noah noticed that Damian had left muddy footprints on the floor of the coffee shop. Luke said he was not at all sorry to see his father go. \n\n\nHenry waited outside the bathroom for the results from the pregnancy test. Finally, Vienna came out and showed him the positive results. Henry immediately collapsed on the bed in a stupor. Brad and Katie knocked on the door, and Henry panicked. \n\n\nVienna let them in, and they inquired why Henry was prostrate on the bed when she was the one who was supposed to be resting. Vienna said that they had been \"not exactly resting,\" and Brad worried that their activity might hurt the baby. Vienna assured him the baby was fine, and Katie asked for more news that the pregnancy was going well. Vienna swore the baby was 100% fine and belonged to Brad and Katie. \n\n\nAfter their friends left, Henry asked Vienna why she had promised Katie the baby, and she said that was why she was having the child. Henry said that applied when Vienna was carrying Brad's baby, but now she was carrying their own baby. They argued about that until Vienna asked Henry straight out if he wanted the baby, and he answered that it would be obvious if the child turned out to be brilliant that it was not from Brad and Katie. \n\n\nHe wanted to know why Vienna was willing to give up what she had always wanted, but Vienna said she had no choice. The baby would belong to Brad and Katie, and no one had to know the truth. Henry began waxing sentimental about the baby, and that gave Vienna pause. \n\n\nDamian was checking out of the Lakeview when Margo approached him. He verified that he was leaving the country, but Margo said she had an interest in his staying in Oakdale a bit longer. She took him to the police station where Lily, Holden, Luke, and Noah were waiting. \n\n\nDamian denied having trashed the Snyder house and disputed the maid's statement. Luke mentioned the mud on Damian's shoes at Java, but Damian still denied breaking into the house. Margo told Damian he was a suspect and could not leave town, and she also impounded his shoes to match them to the footprints on the Snyder floor. Damian asked how he was supposed to get back to the hotel without his shoes, and Margo said, \"In your socks.\" \n\n\nBack home, Katie was not pleased that Henry and Vienna were still living in the hotel. She suggested they move in with her and Brad, so she could cook good meals for Vienna. She reminded Brad that Liberty's room was empty since she was with Parker. Katie begged, and Brad promised to at least think about it. \n\n\nLuke and Noah discussed Damian's possible involvement in recent events, and as usual, Noah was willing to give Damian the benefit of the doubt. Luke went home, and Noah headed back to Java when Damian intercepted him. He told Noah he was not who Noah thought he was, not anymore. Damian asked for Noah's help to reach his son, but Noah turned him down and went inside the coffee shop. Damian stayed outside, peering through the window.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie senses that Henry and Vienna are hiding something from them about the baby and decide to talk to them about it. Vienna feels like she has morning sickness and she heads to her room. A few minutes later Henry thinks that Vienna is going to tell Brad and Katie she was never pregnant and instead she tells them that they could have twins since twins run in her family. Vienna shocks Henry when she tells him that she is pregnant with his baby and not Brad's baby. Vienna tells Henry the baby was probably conceived when they made love after they got home from the doctor's office after hearing the bad news from the doctor about Brad and Katie's baby. Vienna is determined to give Brad and Katie her and Henry's child since Henry made it clear he doesn't want a baby. Henry agrees even though he has doubts about giving his child to Brad and Katie . Henry keeps his doubts a secret from Vienna since she is so happy to be giving Brad and Katie a baby. Brad agrees to allow Henry and Vienna move into the house so Katie can take care of Vienna and the baby. Luke refuses to do public service announcements about housing discrimination because Damian wants to pay for them. Luke later changes his mind when Lily offers to pay for the public service announcements. Lily tries to persuade Luke to give Damian a chance but he refuses to do it. Lily tells Damian to leave because Luke doesn't want him in his life. Holden and Lily's house is broken into and Holden and Luke suspect Damian. It doesn't help that Holden and Lily's made saw a man wearing the same scare and coat Damian was wearing walking in Lily's garden. Margo questions Damian and tells him not to leave town. Margo also takes Damian's shoes so she can compare foot prints. Holden is worried about his family and is determined to protect them at any cost. Damian asks Noah to help him reach Luke so that he and Luke can build a relationship. Noah tells Damian he will have to do that on his own despite the fact that he thinks Luke is being too hard on his father.",
