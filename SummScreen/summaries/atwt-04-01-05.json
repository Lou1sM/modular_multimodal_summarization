Katie tells Henry she thinks everything will be fine between Mike and Jennifer, but Henry questions that and directs her attention to a melancholy-looking Mike sitting by himself. Katie tells Henry she wants to go talk to Mike to find out what's wrong, so Henry goes off to read the paper. Katie tells Mike he looks like he just lost his best friend. He says he keeps picturing Craig with his hands all over Jennifer. Katie tells him he'll have to stop thinking like that if he wants the relationship to last. She asks Mike to answer a simple question: \"Do you love Jennifer?\" Mike says \"Yes.\" Katie tells him sometimes love is hard, but that it can be surprising too and can lead you places you didn't expect to go. He senses she is perhaps now talking about her own relationship with Henry, and he tells her she looks really happy. She says she is happy. Katie goes back to Henry and says she bets he's dying to know what Mike said to her. He tells her he already knows, that his marriage to Katie is over and she wants to be with Mike, because he could see how they were looking at each other. Katie tells Henry that he's wrong, that he is her husband in every sense of the word and that she'd choose Henry over Mike \"in a New York minute!\"\n\n\nAaron gets up in the morning and finds Will's blood-stained shirt on the floor and wants to know what happened the night before. She explains that Will hurt his hand; Aaron eventually realizes that it must have been an intentional injury. Aaron worries about Ali's involvement with Will and tells her he doesn't want her to get herself in too deep; she promises she won't.\n\n\nAt school, 2 guys approach Will and notice his bandaged hand, then start giving him a hard time about how he might have hurt it, given his past. Will responds with equal amounts of derision, and they wander away. Celia arrives and wants to know how Will's date with Gwen went the night before and what happened to his hand. He tells her it was a stupid accident, and he doesn't want to talk about it. She leaves, and Will fantasizes about going to see Alison. He then goes to Aaron and Alison's apartment with a bouquet of flowers in his hands. He is about to knock on the door when he hears Alison and Aaron's voices; he can tell they are being intimate. He accidentally knocks against the door but leaves when Alison calls out, \"Hello? Is anyone there?\" As he leaves, a bud from the bouquet falls to the floor in front of Alison's door, and Alison finds it later.\n\n\nCasey sees Celia at school and tells her a singer she likes is putting on a concert in Chicago, and he thinks they can arrange to go in a group. She says they should invite Will to go with them. Casey leaves, and Celia later sees Will, who is still holding the bouquet he got for Alison. When Celia asks about the flowers, he tells her they're for her, but she doesn't believe him and says he's not acting like himself. He says, \"You thought I was weird yesterday?\" Then he leans forward and whispers in her ear, \"Well, I'm only gonna get weirder.\" He leaves, and Casey walks up, asking Celia, \"What was that about?\" She replies, \"I don't know!\"\n\n\nBarbara has summoned Craig to the Lakeview restaurant, where she tells him she has solved all of Jennifer's problems by taking care of Craig.

But Sierra says she needs to concentrate on work, and they discuss Craig's performance to date. Dusty still doesn't trust Craig, but Sierra thinks he's proven himself. Sierra leaves to take a phone call from Lucy. Jennifer comes in to wait for Sierra, and when Dusty asks her what's wrong, she breaks down and tells him that she slept with Craig and that he has been trying to use that against her to keep her with Street Jeans. She says she cannot continue to work with Craig and wants him gone. Dusty tells her, \"You've got it!\" Sierra comes back into the room and wants to know what they are talking about. Dusty tells Sierra about Craig and Jennifer's night together and about the fact that Craig has been using it to blackmail Jennifer. Jennifer apologizes for not having been able to handle the aftermath on her own, in a professional manner, but she says that Craig blurs the line between professional and personal and is using it to control her. Sierra says she'll take care of the situation and calls Craig to ask him to meet with her right away.\n\n\nCraig goes to the Street Jeans office and tells the 4 employees there that he is leaving to start his own fashion business, Boulevard Jeans, and will give them each a 25% raise to go with him. He convinces the 4 of them to join him, and the employees leave. When Craig gets Sierra's phone call, he goes to see her, and he first tells her how grateful he is for the opportunity she gave him by letting him run a division of Worldwide, but that it's time for him to move on. He offers her his resignation letter, which she tears up. She says, \"Don't deprive me of the pleasure---you're fired!\" He realizes she knows about Jennifer, and he tells her that was a personal matter between consenting adults and should not have been any of her business, except for Jennifer's inability to separate it from business. He tells Sierra that now that he is her new competition, he will bury her.\n\n\nDusty and Jennifer arrive at Street Jeans only to find it deserted. Paul and Barbara come in soon thereafter, as Jennifer realizes that her sketches and samples are all gone. Paul tells her that Barbara has set Craig up in his own fashion business and that Craig must be the one who has sabotaged Jennifer's business. Jennifer, furious, demands that Barbara leave, and Paul makes sure that she does. Dusty says that this is far from over, and says Craig is \"going down.\" Paul agrees, saying they'll take care of Craig and give him what he deserves. Jennifer asks how. Dusty replies, \"We're gonna beat him at his own game.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
