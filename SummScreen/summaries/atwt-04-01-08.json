When Carly asked how she could change his mind, he said he didn't want to go down the same road with her again, because it was too painful. Carly said they could make a different path, but Jack didn't think she was capable of that. Carly told Jack she could be more like Katie if he wanted her to: \"marginally more honest, a lot perkier, and when someone makes me angry ... I'll just write a tell-all book about it!\" Jack got up, groaning with pain, and Carly realized it was time to change his bandages. Doing so, she told him the only time she'd ever been terrified about what had happened to him was when he'd been missing and presumed dead. The other times, she had taken it for granted that he would recover, and they would be together forever. \n\n\nCarly told Jack he was the only man for her and always had been. He laughingly reminded her of the other men in her life. When he asked about Hal, Carly looked wistful for a moment, remembering their departed friend, before laughingly replying, \"Money.\" Jack asked about Brad, and Carly again said, \"Money!\" \"Winston?\" Carly exclaimed, \"He kidnapped me!\" Jack then asked about Craig Montgomery, and Carly claimed temporary insanity. When Jack finally mentioned Simon, Carly said, \"Your fault,\" and reminded Jack that he had moved out before she became involved with Simon. \n\n\nCarly told Jack not to throw her past affairs in her face, because his own past was not squeaky clean. She reminded him about both Julias, and Jack said, \"Oh, but I never said you were the only woman for me!\" Carly hit Jack, and he laughed at her. Carly became serious again, telling Jack that it was fate for them to be together. She said, \"It's our history. It's who we are.\" She leaned over and kissed him; he responded, and seconds later, they kissed again. \n\n\nEmma told Holden and Lily she had decided to sell most of the farm, keeping only the house, the pond, and a few acres. Emma said the farm had become too big of a worry for her, and there were other things she'd like to do with her life, like traveling. Lucinda arrived, bearing gifts for Faith and Natalie, and Lily and Holden told her about Emma's desire to sell the farm. Lucinda thought it was a wonderful idea and offered to buy the farm herself. Emma said all of her children would have to agree to the sale. Meg arrived, and after being told what was going on, she agreed that Emma should do whatever she wanted to with the farm. \n\n\nLucinda said she had always thought the farm would be a good investment for Worldwide and that she would pay top dollar for it, to repay Emma for the many years of happiness Holden had brought to Lily and for giving Lily refuge at the farm when she was a teenager. Meg reminded Lucinda that Paul was CEO of Worldwide and would therefore have to approve the deal. Emma said she refused to let Paul own any part of her farm, but Meg, along with Lucinda, Holden, and Lily, talked her into at least discussing the idea with Paul. \n\n\nBarbara asked Paul to help her convince Gwen and Will to follow through on their plan to leave Oakdale. Meanwhile, Gwen told Will about Sofie's offer to help Barbara get through her medical treatments. Will was surprised and leery about his mother and Sofie agreeing that Will and Gwen should leave town, but Gwen convinced Will that it was best for everybody concerned. By the time Paul and Barbara arrived on their mission to talk Gwen and Will into moving, Will was able to tell them they had agreed it would be best if they left Oakdale. \n\n\nPaul told Will he was happy Will and Gwen would get a new start, and he offered his apologies for having taken Sofie's side about the baby. Paul said he should have learned not to meddle in his family's lives after what happened with Jennifer. Will said Jennifer had forgiven Paul, and he and Gwen did, too. Paul hugged Will, but then his cell phone rang; it was Meg, asking Paul to come to the farm, because she had a proposition for him. Paul told Gwen and Will he had to leave and asked them not to leave town without saying goodbye. They agreed, and Paul left. \n\n\nWill told his mom he thought they would be leaving town in a couple of days. Barbara said that was too soon and that she wanted to have a farewell party for them. Will said that wasn't a good idea, but Gwen thought it would be great. As Barbara left, she thanked them for letting her have the party, saying it would take her mind off her radiation therapy. Will thanked Gwen for being so thoughtful. He then told Gwen he would focus on the details of the move, and Gwen said he was a good dad. They talked about what a good dad Hal had been, and Gwen said Hallie had a lot to live up to, having been named in Hal's honor. Will said they all did. \n\n\nWhen Paul arrived at the Snyder farm, he saw Lucinda, Meg, Holden, Lily, and Emma all gathered in the kitchen and jokingly said, \"A surprise party, for me!\" They told him about Emma's desire to sell the farm and Lucinda's idea that Worldwide buy it. Paul told them he was definitely interested, and Holden immediately pointed out that \"my sister's not part of the offer!\" Meg told Holden she could speak for herself, and Paul said so could he. Paul then told everyone that if Worldwide purchased Emma's farm, he would do everything he could to protect the investment and preserve the farm for future generations. Lucinda asked if everyone was in agreement, and Emma told Paul, \"You cross me, young man, and you'll be staring down the barrel of a shotgun.\" Paul asked Meg if that was a \"yes,\" and then he told Emma he would have papers drawn up in the morning. \n\n\nMeg walked Paul out and told him she was glad the deal was purely business for him. Paul said it was a business deal, but everything he did and thought and dreamed of was for Meg. Meg became angry and threatened to cancel the sale of the farm, but Paul assured her he would be the perfect trustee for the farm and would do what was best for Emma. He said no one else needed to know he'd do anything to have Meg back in his life. \n\n\nLucinda received a call from Gwen, who said she and Will needed to talk to Lucinda. Lucinda left the Snyders and went to the cottage, where Gwen told her they were planning to leave Oakdale. Lucinda thanked them for having been good tenants, told them that change could be good, and wished them good luck. After Lucinda left, Will and Gwen told Hallie a mixed-up fairy tale about 3 bears, a big bad wolf, and Oz, which ended with them living happily ever after, together. \n\n\nAt the end of the workday, Brad invited Katie to dinner, but she said she preferred to go home and order room service. She suggested he invite Bonnie instead, but Brad said he and Bonnie were no longer seeing each other. Brad went to Al's to eat dinner alone. Neither Brad nor Katie could eat, and by chance, they both decided to see a movie and ended up sitting near each other in the theater. Katie asked why Brad hadn't found a date in his little black book, but Brad said the book had been retired, because he only wanted Katie. \n\n\nWhen Brad suggested that Katie was moping because of Jack, she told him she had gone to see Jack, and Jack had made it clear he wasn't ready to resume a relationship with her. Brad said that even though he thought he and Katie would make a better couple (and have prettier children), if Katie truly wanted Jack, then he was sorry she had been disappointed by him. Neither of them was enjoying the movie, so Brad suggested they get dinner instead. They went out to eat, where Katie said at least her appetite had returned. Brad said that was proof that he was good for her, and Katie agreed, but she told Brad she was too confused to get involved with him right away. Brad said he would wait until her confusion had cleared and she had realized she belonged with him. He walked her to her door, and Katie thanked him and kissed him on the cheek. Brad bent down and kissed Katie on the lips, and after a few seconds, she returned the kiss. \n\n\n",
