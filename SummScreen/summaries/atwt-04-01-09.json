Janet was worried that Liberty only cared about Parker's future and not her own. \n\n\nJanet talked to her daughter about going to college and the dreams she had that didn't include having a husband at age 17. She suggested that Liberty get an annulment. Liberty listened to her mom, but she wasn't persuaded. When Parker showed up, Liberty agreed to go with him to look for apartments. Parker assured Janet that his trust fund would pay for both of them to go to college. \n\n\nParker asked Craig to help him get an apartment. Craig informed Parker that he belonged in school, not apartment hunting. Craig made Parker realize that Liberty would be more impressed with him if he concentrated on schoolwork and improving himself. \n\n\nCarly and Jack had it out over Parker's new situation. She contended that Craig would be a good trustee to their son, but Jack believed that Craig manipulated things to get control of the money. Jack urged Carly to do the right thing for Parker by getting the trust fund out of Craig's control. \n\n\nCarly and Jack met with Craig. They asked him to back out of his position as trustee. Craig refused to betray the trust Parker had put in him. Craig reminded Jack that if they kept pushing Parker, he might run away again. Jack asked Carly to choose sides - him or Craig? \n\n\nCarly tried to make Jack understand that Parker made a sound choice in Craig and there was nothing they could do about it. Jack wasn't happy and walked out on both Craig and Carly. \n\n\nPaul confronted Lucy to make sure that she had kept her end of their deal by seducing Dusty. Lucy insisted she had her way with Dusty, but Paul didn't believe her. Later, Paul returned and told Lucy that from that point on, they were doing things his way. Paul was unreasonable and insistent. Lucy was desperate to keep him from telling Craig. When Dusty called Lucy, Paul warned her that she'd better seduce him and make it real...or else! \n\n\nDusty told Meg how great his trip to Chicago had been because of the time he spent with Johnny. He confided that Lucy expected something more from him, but he wasn't interested in Lucy. Meg confessed to Dusty that while he was gone, she spent a night at Fairwinds. She explained that she didn't sleep with Paul; she was there to protect Eliza. Dusty declared that he was going to fix things with Paul. Meg warned him not to go after Paul. Dusty agreed and they kissed. Unbeknownst to them both, Paul was watching from the window. \n\n\nDusty went back to see Lucy. She cried and played the victim. Dusty said he would find other ways to see Johnny and not use her anymore. Lucy threw herself at Dusty and said she wanted him back. Dusty realized that she was lying, and Lucy admitted she needed him to pretend they were lovers. \n\n\nLucy explained that she has been breaking the law by using Craig's company to ship humanitarian goods to the charity that had helped her when she was on the run with Johnny. She went on to say that Paul had been blackmailing her. Lucy then begged Dusty to pretend that they were back together so Craig would remain in the dark. Lucy asked Dusty to give her some time, to keep Meg disillusioned just until the mission succeeded. Dusty said he had to tell Meg something. Lucy was confident that he would figure something out. \n\n\nParker and Liberty found a penthouse apartment and asked Craig for the money for the deposit. Carly was stunned and Craig said he wouldn't release the funds. Craig told Parker that it was impractical to move into an apartment and pay rent when he was not making money. Parker and Liberty realized they had no choice but to stay at Milltown. \n\n\nParker and Liberty went to the diner and told Janet and Jack that they'd decided to stay at Carly's instead of getting an apartment. Janet suggested to Jack that he had misjudged Craig, but Jack remained suspicious of him. Meanwhile, Carly was grateful to Craig and accepted his offer of a drink. They toasted to trust. \n\n\nPaul went to see Meg at the farmhouse about seeing Eliza. Meg refused to be intimidated by Paul, daring him to go to Craig about Dusty seeing Johnny. Paul asked to see Eliza with the social worker present. Paul tried to convince Meg that all he wanted was to spend time with his daughter. \n\n\nDusty returned to Meg and asked her to trust him no matter what Paul tried to say or do in the weeks ahead to make her doubt Dusty's love.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Parker learns that Craig is officially his trustee, as he is thrilled thinking Craig is on his side and will let him do whatever with the money, but Craig tries to sit him down and talk about school and being responsible. Janet tells Liberty that she feels that she is getting lost in Parker and needs to start doing what makes herself happy. After talking more, Janet is able to convince \u0096 or so she thinks \u0096 Liberty to tell Parker that they need to get their marriage annulled. Parker shows up to tell her the good news, and Janet prods Liberty to tell Parker what they were discussing, but Liberty doesn't and instead tells him that she was promising her mom that they would go to college. Janet watches sadly, as a less then confident looking Liberty walks off with Parker to got apartment hunting. Jack and Carly argue about Craig and his being in charge of Parker's trust fund. Jack is convinced Craig is only along for the ride to get his hands on Rosanna's money. He is adamant the only way Craig can prove himself is to step down so Carly calls him to meet. Craig, however, refuses to step down citing Parker's trust in him as the reason. He also reminds Jack it is not a competition and he is the only one Parker is turning to right now so they shouldn't change that. Jack is determined to believe Craig is the last person Parker should be near, and asks Carly to pick sides. When she balks and tries to defend Craig, Jack assumes he knows her decision, as he storms out again. Parker and Liberty show up to see Craig at Carly's telling him about the Penthouse they want to live in, but Craig shoots them down. Parker is annoyed, as Craig doesn't think he is spending his money wisely and furthermore tells them that he can't put them up at the Lakeview anymore. Parker and Liberty are forced into taking the offer to stay at Carly's to their disappointment but to Carly's thrill. Parker and Liberty tell Jack and Janet their news, as Janet is happy, but Jack is just as convinced that Craig wouldn't do anything without an ulterior motive. Meg and Dusty reunite after his trip to Chicago. Meg lets Dusty know Paul's game and why she had to stay at Fairwinds with him and Eliza. Dusty decides he doesn't want to sneak around anymore to see Johnny or put Meg in a position where she has to play into Paul's blackmail and goes to tell Lucy, as Meg looks forward to cutting Paul off at the knees. Paul puts Lucy on the spot as to if she got Dusty in bed, as she coyly alludes to the fact that she did, but Paul later sees Dusty and Meg kissing and confronts and threatens Lucy promising to tell Craig if she doesn't get Dusty in bed; he gives her one last chance. Paul goes to see Meg without notice assuming she will let him see Eliza to keep him quiet, but she gleefully tells him that it is no longer happening. Paul gathers his composure and calmly agrees to her terms because all he wants is to see his daughter, as Meg is unsure of this side of him. Lucy tries to seduce Dusty by telling him that she still loves him, but he doesn't fall for it. Lucy finally has to tell him what she has been up to and asks him to go along with it to keep Paul off her back so people in Africa don't get killed. He doesn't want to pretend to be back in love with her and hurt Meg. Lucy begs him to do this so people don't get hurt and she also claims that Meg and Eliza could be in danger as well. Finally, Dusty agrees to help her out, as Lucy is thrilled. Dusty asks Meg to trust him no matter what she sees or hears from Paul, but he doesn't tell her what exactly he is doing though. Lucy tells Paul that she did what the asked and he will see proof that she and Dusty are back together soon, as Paul relishes in the possibility of having Meg left high and dry by Dusty.",
