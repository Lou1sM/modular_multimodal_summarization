    "soap_central": "\n\n \nCarly and Jack ganged up on Janet and would not let her help with the dishes.  Janet went to see if Liberty was awake yet, and Jack suggested that he and Carly get away by themselves for the day.  Carly was excited, and she went to powder her nose, while Jack answered the doorbell.  He signed for the delivery of a large manila envelope, and he opened it.   Inside were his and Janet's divorce papers, and Jack commented that once he and Janet had signed them, he would be \"a free man.\"  Carly asked if that wasn't what he wanted, and Jack answered yes, but he was sad.\n\n\nCarly got sarcastic and said she would cancel the fireworks and marching band.  Janet returned and said Liberty was still asleep.  Jack told her about the papers, so they prepared to sign them.  Carly was irritated that her \"date\" with Jack had apparently been put on the back burner, so she announced she was going to Monte Carlo.  Jack went after her, but Carly was still miffed, and she blew him off.\n\n\nJack went back inside, and he and Janet discussed the ending of their marriage.  Janet took a call then from Dr. Oliver, who reported that there was no change in Mr. Donovan's condition.  Janet was discouraged that Dusty might not be in her future after all.  She looked through the divorce papers and said that she had changed her mind about settling the child custody issue after the divorce.  She reminded Jack that they had conceived the baby to donate bone marrow to Liberty, but it looked as if that was not needed.  Janet said she wanted the custody issue settled in the divorce and before they went further.  Jack said they could still be fantastic parents, and he was determined to honor his commitment.\n\n\nAt Monte Carlo, Gabriel snooped through papers on Craig's desk, but he heard someone approaching, so he ran back to working on wiring.  Craig and his finance man, Ellis, walked in, and before they noticed Gabriel, Ellis wondered aloud what Carly would think when she found out who was floating the bill for the place.  Suddenly Craig spotted Gabriel and yelled, \"Who the hell are you?\"  Then he ordered Ellis to call the police, as Gabriel asked if burglars usually took the time to rewire a whole office.  Craig asked Ellis to hang up, and asked Gabriel why he was in the office.\n\n\nGabriel said that Craig's partner had hired him to fit the office for Wi-Fi.  He introduced himself as Gabriel Carras, and he showed Craig the key that Carly had loaned him.  Craig took the key back and told the boy that he could only be in the office when he or Carly was present.  Carly walked in and found Gabriel packing up his tools.  She asked what was up, and Craig said he thought he was the one who did the hiring for the company.  Carly said she was sorry, but unless Craig knew how to run a wireless network, they needed Gabriel.  Craig gave in and ordered the boy to \"go fix something.\"\n\n\nCarly showed Craig her finished sketches for eveningwear, and he raved about them.  He hugged her, and then took off.  Carly showed her drawings to Gabriel, who quickly maintained that he didn't know a thing about women's fashions.  Carly said she just wanted his impression of her work, and Gabriel glanced at them and announced that they looked like other clothes he had seen.  Carly appeared unhappy, and then studied her work.  Then she declared that Gabriel was right; her designs were boring, and they stank.  She wondered why Craig had raved over them so loudly, and Gabriel offered the opinion that \"that guy\" would do anything to keep Carly around.\n\n\nCarly said she didn't need a \"yes man,\" she needed someone who believed in her talent like Maurice, their New York investor.  \"If you say so,\" said Gabriel, and that comment bothered Carly.  Gabriel then asked if Maurice had personally told her that he loved her work on those pieces, but she said that Craig was the one who dealt with the investor.  \"Okay,\" said Gabriel, who went back to work.  Carly fretted, and then she called Maurice in New York and spoke to his secretary.  That woman gave Carly the stunning news that Maurice had turned down Craig's offer to invest in Monte Carlo months before.  Carly realized that the man had not put a dime into her company.\n\n\nCraig returned with the good news that their designs were \"in\" for fashion week in Milan.  Carly glowered at him, as Craig prattled on about how great their exposure would be for the European market.  Finally Carly hurled her tape dispenser at Craig's head and called him an \"arrogant slimy creep.\"  She accused him of lying to her, and she said she had called their \"investor\" in New York, who, it turned out, was nOT their investor.  She demanded to know who had financed her company.  \"Me,\" said Craig.  \"I'm the investor.\"\n\n\nCarly was fearful that the 20something demographic for whom she was designing would consider her pieces \"boring and predictable.\"  Craig asked Carly to trust him, but she picked up her purse and coat and walked out.  Craig motioned Gabriel over and promptly fired him.\n\n\nCarly went home, and she asked Jack to hold her before she lost her mind.  Janet walked in and said that Jack was about to drive her to the hospital to sit with Dusty, and she asked Carly to check on Liberty in case the girl got hungry.  Carly agreed, but as soon as they had left, she ranted and vented.  The doorbell rang, and there stood Gabriel.  He said that Craig had just fired him, and he wanted to be paid for work done.  Carly officially rehired him and said she would tell Craig.  She also asked him to keep his \"eyes open.\"  Gabriel went back to the office and eavesdropped on Craig and Ellis.  He heard Craig say that \"Carly would never connect the dots to Parker.\"\n\n\nJack returned to Carly's and told her that he had dropped off the signed divorce papers at Tom's office.  He suggested they take advantage of their \"comfy couch,\" and they kissed and dropped onto the sofa.\n\n\nIn the Lakeview lounge, Bob saluted Kim with a flute of champagne for 25 wonderful years of marriage.  He claimed they were not old but \"classic.\"  Dr. Oliver approached their table and told Bob that they had to talk, so Bob's lunch with his wife could wait.  Kim was not pleased, but she offered to go talk to Barbara for a while so Dr. Oliver could talk with Bob.  Reid said that the father of one of his patients in Texas had filed suit against him for malpractice.  He was worried that if he got dragged through the mud, the hospital, and especially the new wing, would get its reputation damaged.  Bob said that whoever attacked one of Memorial's doctors had to go through him, but Dr. Oliver asked what was in that for Bob.  Bob responded that, for a genius, Dr. Oliver was \"clueless.\"\n\n\nKatie told Chris Hughes that his appearance on her show had generated too many calls for the switchboard to handle.  Chris was not interested in a television career, but he said that he needed Katie's help desperately.  He explained that he was in charge of decorations for his parents' surprise anniversary party that evening, and he was stuck.  He had a lovely picture of Bob and Kim, and he asked if Katie thought he should enlarge and frame it.  Katie said she could take care of that right at the studio, and then Chris agonized over what kind of a gift he should give them.\n\n\n Katie was bitter about how everyone did not get a fair shot at love, so Chris gave her a pep talk about how she would find love again when she least expected it.  Katie said she was tired of ending up alone.  They framed the photo, and then Chris asked Katie to go with him to Tom and Margo's to help him decorate.  His other challenge was how to get the guests of honor there without tipping them off.  Tom had been in charge of that, but he had been called to court before he had come up with a plan.  Chris hated to say it, but he admitted that his father was relating best to Reid Oliver lately, so they went hunting for Reid at the hospital.\n\n\nChris and Katie approached Reid and asked him for help, but the doctor was not in a humanitarian mood.  Then Chris mentioned that he knew that Oliver was facing a malpractice lawsuit, and since Tom was the hospital's lawyer, he suggested that Reid call Bob over to Tom's house that evening to have a powwow about the law suit.  Amazingly, Dr. Oliver agreed.\n\n\nUp in Barbara's suite, Kim complained that her 25th anniversary was looking like any other dull day.  She said she had very much wanted it to be special, but Barbara replied that there was no better way to celebrate than to just be in the middle of her regular life.  Kim looked at her niece and said, \"Shut up, Barbara.\"  Then Kim said she should have learned in 25 years that, with Bob, medicine always won out when challenged by life.  Bob called Kim and asked her to return, so she said goodbye to Barbara.  As soon as Kim left, Barbara took out a beautiful silver candelabrum and began to wrap it.  She also took a call and told the caller that Bob and Kim would be \"very excited\" if that person showed up at the party.\n\n\nThe anniversary couple resumed their romantic champagne date in the lounge, and Bob talked about leaving Memorial a better hospital when he retired and put the place in the capable young hands of physicians like Reid and Chris.  Kim recognized that their son was very happy in pediatrics and had no desire to do administrative work.  Bob said if he left the hospital in Dr. Oliver's hands, it would be his greatest achievement.  When he saw his wife's face, Bob quickly added, \"Second only to our marriage, of course.\"  He reached for Kim's hand, but she pulled it away.\n\n\nBarbara walked up to Bob and Kim and congratulated Bob on 25 years of marriage to \"a force of nature.\"  She urged Kim to give Bob his gift, so Kim handed him a framed photo of their cabin in the woods.  Kim explained that she had arranged a complete renovation of the place and it had been completed that very day.  She was eager to start off the second 25 years of their marriage with a private vacation beginning the next day.  Kim had worked very hard with Bob's secretary to clear his schedule for a few days, but Bob said it was no longer clear because of complications with the plans for the new wing.  He had to meet with the architect the next day, but perhaps he could get away in a few weeks.\n\n\nKim was very disappointed, but Bob went on to say that he needed advance warning about being away from the hospital.  He wanted to leave behind a great legacy, and he couldn't turn his back on the new construction.  \"You and your job,\" grumbled Kim.  She said she wanted to feel as if she was Number One in her husbands' life, and she asked him to prove it by taking a few days alone with her.\n\n\nAt Tom and Margo's, Katie and Chris put the finishing touches on the decorations, despite a scolding from Barbara for using \"tacky\" paper bells.  Chris took all the blame, and he warned his aunt not to beat up on Katie about it.\n\n\n",
