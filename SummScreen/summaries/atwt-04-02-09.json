They sat close together with their drums at Casey's house, and Casey helped her place her hands on the drumhead. Alison laughingly told him to go beat his own drum, so he tickled her. The two began wrestling on the couch until Alison ended up on top of Casey. \n\n\nHis phone began to vibrate, so Casey took the call. It was from Dean Burns at the university. He dropped the bombshell that Casey was not eligible to enroll there because he had been expelled, and the boycott applied to extension classes, as well. Casey was frustrated and scattered all the sheet music. Alison felt responsible because it was she who had recommended they take courses. They began arguing, and Alison attempted to cheer up Casey, who assumed he had screwed up yet again. Alison grabbed him and kissed him hard. \n\n\nLuke stopped at Java to show Noah all the responses he had from the ad he had placed on Greg's List for volunteers for the foundation. Luke wanted to launch a broad campaign against discrimination. Noah blurted out that Damian had stopped by earlier and asked Noah to talk to Luke about giving him one more chance. Luke was pleased that Noah had turned his father down, but Noah took the opportunity to tell his boyfriend he should give the man another chance anyway. \n\n\nLuke said Damian was not sincere, and he felt he had given the man more than enough chances. Besides, Holden was his dad, the only one Luke recognized. He said he was done with Damian. Suddenly, a denim-clad young couple with multiple piercings walked in and headed right for Noah and Luke. The two declared the boys' search was over because they were exactly what the boys had ordered. \n\n\nAt the police station, Holden asked Margo why she had not yet arrested Damian for trashing his house. She said there was no proof that Damian had ransacked the house. They had not been able to get a complete muddy footprint from the floor that matched Damian's shoes. Holden was frustrated that Damian was still in town, and he told Margo he felt Luke was in grave danger. Margo volunteered to put the boy under 24-hour police surveillance, and Holden readily agreed. \n\n\nDamian disturbed Lily at home and asked to speak with her. He said he meant no harm to her or her family. He questioned how she could believe he could run down their son with a car. Lily said she did not know, right when Holden walked in. Damian accused Holden of being overeager to believe that Damian was a bad guy, and that made Holden blind to the fact that whoever hurt Luke was still out there. \n\n\nDamian and Holden argued, as Lily protested she only wanted her family to be safe. Holden told Damian to leave, so Damian did, but not before he reminded Lily that until Holden could get past his anger towards Damian, Luke would not be safe. After Damian left, Holden said he did not want Damian back in their house, and he and Lily hugged. \n\n\nThe odd couple in Java told Luke and Noah that they knew they were meant to be part of the antidiscrimination team. They promised to commit to the cause and give it everything they had. They introduced themselves as Zoe and Zac Finn, and claimed they were very good at attracting attention. Zac looked Noah over carefully and mentioned that Noah probably got a lot of attention on his own. Zac was obviously flirting with Noah, so Luke spoke up and told him Noah was already taken. The couple volunteered to work for the cause if Luke would say the word, and Luke said yes. \n\n\nZoe and Zac suggested they start a blog for gay and straight people to come together and begin a dialogue. They also wanted to put on a dance, so people could move their bodies and open their minds. Zac continued to hit on Noah as he explained that at the dance, people would have to dance with people of their own sex and the opposite sex. Luke thought that was an interesting concept and commented that the couple was really in tune with each other. \n\n\nZoe explained that they were twins, not lovers, but they were very affectionate. Luke took a call from Holden, who asked him to swing by the house to meet the police officer Margo has assigned to Luke for protection. Luke was not in favor of the idea, but he did agree to meet the cop. Zac said Luke's life sounded exciting, and he and his sister left. Noah was befuddled by the whole experience, and Luke headed for home. \n\n\nCasey and Ali got carried away and began disrobing. Casey suddenly called a halt and asked what they were doing. Alison was hurt that Casey had stopped, but he wanted to be sure that she was not willing to make love to him only because she felt sorry for him. Alison was confused, so Casey said she was the one thing in his life he did not want to mess up. \n\n\nThey questioned whether either of them was ready for the next step. They got dressed, but Casey wanted to talk about it. Alison said she was tired of being Casey's life raft and advised him to save himself by finding something in his life he could be proud of. She told him to stop being afraid of failing. She really liked him, but he was determined to become a miserable person. \n\n\nLuke met Officer Cohen at home, and then he argued with Holden about being followed around by a cop. Lily explained that it was not just Damian they were worried about, and she cited the hit-and-run accident as an example. Luke did not like the message that the protection appeared to send: guard the gay guy and let the others fend for themselves. Holden said he was sorry, but it had to be that way until Damian left town. \n\n\nJava was closed, and Noah was cleaning tables when Damian walked in. He collapsed on the floor with bloody hands. Noah reached around to Damian's back and got his hands covered with blood, as well. Damian regained consciousness briefly and told Noah that someone had stabbed him. He asked the boy not to call the police, but then he passed out again. Noah called for an ambulance, and then he called Luke and told him to meet them at Memorial. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Damian stabilized and Noah waited for the family to arrive. Margo got there first, and she asked what happened. Damian awoke and told her that someone had jumped him, but he had not seen him. He said he thought the attacker was after Luke instead. Margo walked out as the Snyder family arrived. Noah got upset thinking Damian's blood on his shirt could have been Luke's. \n\n\nLily and Holden went to see Damian, and Damian credited Noah with saving his life. Lily said Damian was lucky that Noah was there. Holden thought Damian was devious enough to have set up the whole scenario, but Lily tried to keep peace. Holden was still of the opinion that Damian was the only one from whom Luke needed protection, and that upset Lily.\n\n\nMargo informed them that she could not assign Officer Cohen to shadow Luke without the boy's permission, and Lily realized the boys were not at the hospital any longer. Holden had received a text message from Luke, so he told Lily the boys were at Al's diner. Holden went to talk with Luke, but Lily decided to stay with Damian. \n\n\nDamian awakened and tried to convince Lily he was only targeted because he was Luke's father. Lily reminded him that the last time he was in town, he had wanted to send Luke away to de-program him. Damian said he was later convinced that Luke could be happy with the kind of life he had chosen for himself. He swore he had always loved Luke, and Lily, too. \n\n\nAt the diner, Noah tried to persuade Luke that what had happened to Damian had been real, not staged. He defended the man until Luke asked him to stop. Luke said he would never again trust his birth father. Holden arrived, and Luke told him that he still did not want police protection, but finally Holden and Noah convinced him it was necessary. \n\n\nHolden left to secure the arrangements with Margo, and Zoe and Zac walked in. They asked about the cop outside, so Luke explained that Officer Cohen was his new bodyguard. Zac pulled up a chair right next to Noah, while Zoe sat close to Luke. \n\n\nCasey went to Dean Burns's office on the Oakdale U. campus. He told the dean that he had finally realized that Burns had expelled him, but that it had been the reaction to Casey's messing up. Casey said he was 21 years old and his life was a disaster. He said he was not afraid to take a chance and ask for help, however. \n\n\nLater, at Memorial, Casey ran in and grabbed Alison and excitedly pulled her into the on call room. He told her that she had finally gotten through to him, and he had gone to see the dean, and they had made a deal. If Casey would join a community service project and stick with it, the university would consider lifting his expulsion. Alison was thrilled, and she hugged Casey and told him how fantastic that was. Casey said he was thinking of helping Luke and Noah with the foundation, and Alison was proud of him. \n\n\nAt home, Holden told Lily that Luke had agreed to the police protection. He asked her how her conversation with Damian had gone, and she said she was beginning to give credence to his theory. She cried that she could not live with herself if something happened to their son, but Holden assured her he would not let that happen.\n\n\n",
