They talk about the competition between Carly and Barbara and who is going to gloat when they win.  Craig gets a call from Jack and Jack tells him to meet him at the Lakeview.  Craig tells him that he is all wrapped up in nuptial negotiations.  Jack says that it is about Carly and Monte Carlo.  Craig agrees to meet with Jack.  Rosanna asks if that was Carly calling.  Craig tells her that it wasn't Carly, but it was a related distraction that he needs to take care of so she can go on creating.  Craig kisses his future bride and makes a hasty getaway.  After Craig is gone, Rosanna takes out her cell phone and calls Barbara to see how her designs are coming alone.  Barbara gives her good news.  As she is hanging up with Barbara, Carly walks into the garden.  Carly tells Rosanna that she is giving up.  She informs her sister that she is putting her child first.

Jessica tells her daughter that she doesn't have to wait on her.  Bonnie tells her mother how much she looks up to her.  She says that if she were in the position that her mother is in that she doesn't know how she would handle it.  Jessica says that she hopes that Bonnie will never be in this position.  Bonnie leaves to go to work.  After she is gone, Margo asks Jessica why she didn't want Bonnie to know how she was really feeling.  Jessica tells Margo about the night that she thought that Marshall was in her house and she took out her gun and it turned out to be Bonnie.  She goes on to say that she could have shot her daughter.  Jessica tells Margo that everything has changed and she doesn't like where her world is going.  Jessica goes on to tell Margo about wanting to be with Ben the night before, but she couldn't go through with it.  Margo tells her that Ben is patient and he understands what she is going through.  Then she tells Margo about being trapped in the elevator with Marshall.  Jessica tells her friend that she doesn't know what is going to happen to her life.  Margo tells Jessica that all of this is not her fault.  She tells Jessica that she has to let her friends and family support her now.  Jessica says that she will try.  Margo says that she has to get back to work and as she leaves she tells her friend to lock up.  After Margo walks out the door, Jessica locks the door and puts the chain on.  \n\n\nBen goes to Marshall's hotel room and confronts him about the picture of Marshall and Jessica making love.  Marshall tells him that the videotape was ruled inadmissible in court and all he has to do is get one juror to see his side.  He tells Ben that if this picture gets to the public then his case will be over.  He suggests to Ben that he go to Jessica and persuade Jessica to drop the charges.  Before Ben loses his cool, he stomps out of Marshall's hotel room.  \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Jack turns Carly's sketchbook over to Craig.  Jack tells Craig that until further notice, Carly is on hiatus.  Craig asks if Jack stole the items from Carly.  Jack says that this is coming from the designer herself.  Jack tells Craig that he knows that Craig doesn't care about Carly or his baby.  Craig questions Jack about his baby.  He asks if they have confirmation on the paternity of the baby.  Jack tells Craig that he is such a good mood that even his barbs are not going to affect him.  Jack says that he doesn't care what Craig does.  He can go and get hitched to Barbara's star and he doesn't care what she does to him, he just wants Craig to leave Carly alone.  Jack leaves Craig standing by himself.  \n\n\nBack at the Snyder farm, Jack catches Carly tending to her wound.  When he asks what happened, Carly lies and says that she cut her hand while cutting into an apple.  Jack tells her about turning over her sketchbook to Craig.  She says that she is happy that he did it but she is not happy that Barbara is going to be taking her place.  Jack gets a call about an accident that he has to go and investigate.  After he is gone, Carly puts her hands on her stomach and says that she is sorry that her baby won't be able to come into the world meeting a successful, talented mother.  She adds that she wanted her child to be proud of her.  She says that she has made such a mess of things that she doesn't deserve to have her dreams come true any more.  Craig walks in the kitchen.  Carly looks up and tells Craig to not make this worst for her than it already is.  Craig asks, \"You gave up?  Why would you do that?\"  Carly says, \"Sorry Craig, it's all gone.  Every spec of talent that I had is gone.\"\n\n\nMargo goes to Marshall's hotel room and knocks on his door.  When Marshall answers the door he asks if this is a surprise inspection.  Margo says that she knows that Marshall and Jessica took an elevator ride together.  She adds that she knows that Marshall trapped Jessica on the elevator and that is a felony kidnapping.  She asks Marshall if the bullet he took erased that detail from his data bank.  Marshall asks if this is an interrogation.  Margo tells him that this is a warning.  She says that if he pulls a stunt like that again she will have his bail revoked.  She informs him that if he sees Jessica walking down the street, he is to cross to the other side.  Her last words to Marshall are, \"You stay away from her.\"  Margo walks away.  \n\n\nBack at Jessica house, Ben walks in and comments about the people who are still on her lawn wanting answers and taking pictures.  Jessica tells Ben that she thought about cooking dinner for them tonight.  Ben says that there is something that they need to talk about.  Jessica asks what is wrong.  Ben says, \"I think it is time to consider dropping the charges Travers.\"\n\n\n",
