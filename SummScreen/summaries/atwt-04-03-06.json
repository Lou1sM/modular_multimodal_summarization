At the awards banquet, we are treated with clips of Nancy from the beginning of the show.  On the way home on the bus, Barbara is angry because she has just learned of Emily and Paul's jailhouse marriage.  Barbara first persuades the driver to take a short cut, then grabs the wheel to keep the driver from turning back.  The bus is stuck on a dirt road, and the driver walks to find help for the stranded women. While they wait, the women build a bonfire and reminisce, with wonderful film clips from the past.  We see an incredibly beautiful, younger, Kim, learning of Bob's affair with Susan. Barbara goes off by herself and remembers loving James Stenbeck and Hal (we see clips of beautiful young Barbara).  Kim joins Barbara briefly, and remembers following Bob to Florida for a clandestine affair.  Kim goes back to the other women, and Barbara eats a candy bar, which attracts a bear.  Around a campfire, the other women remember their past.  Lucinda recalls hiding the truth about Lily's real parents, Iva and Josh.  Nancy remembers Chris, while Lisa remembers her many, many romances.  The bear follows Barbara to the campfire, and the women repel the bear by singing \"The Bear Went Over the Mountain.\"  When the bear lumbers off, Lucinda and Barbara decide to try again to get the bus out of the mud.  Their efforts turn the bus on its side, pinning Lucinda beneath the steering wheel. Gas is leaking from the bus, and is running toward the campfire.  The heroic women band together to pull Lucinda from the bus, using a rope. Just as Lucinda is freed, the bus explodes.  All the women survive, and have one more memory, of how nearly all of them loved John Dixon at one time.  Emma finds a pickup, which they can use to drive back to Oakdale.\n\n\nFor more on As the World Turns' 50th anniversary, please click here.\n\n\n",
