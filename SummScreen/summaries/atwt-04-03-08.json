Holden asked how Jack was getting along and Carly related that having him at home had been wonderful for the children, but that she was not making any progress in renewing her romance with him. Holden reminded her that it was difficult for Jack to trust Carly again, and Carly accused Holden of being self-righteous. Carly was not pleased when Holden pointed out that sometimes relationships just run out of steam. \n\n\nJack went to the Lakeview looking for Lisa but found Lily instead. They sat and talked a while, and Lily urged Jack to give Carly another chance. She likened Jack and Carly's situation to hers and Holden's, which was now back on track. Jack reminded Lily that Carly had continually lied to him and he could not subject his family to that again. Lily kept up her pep talk for Carly, and Katie came into the Lakeview and overheard her. \n\n\nFinally Lily suggested that Jack might be holding himself back for reasons other than Carly's truthfulness. After Lily left, Jack spoke to Katie who told him about Brad's proposal. Jack was shocked, but told her to go ahead if that was what she wanted. That was not the response Katie wanted, and she went up to her room and threw away her wedding picture with Jack. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Mike Kasnoff explained his affection for the farm to Emma and Meg and was surprised to learn that Worldwide had also made a pitch to develop the land. He was stunned to find out that Paul Ryan was head of that company, as well. Meg went outside and called Paul to tell him about the competitive bid, and Paul said he was on his way. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Katie arrived to speak with Margo. Margo gave her a hard time about the bike theft incident earlier and Katie dropped the bomb that Brad had proposed. Margo could not believe that Katie was considering marriage again and reminded her to count how many husbands she had already had. She kidded her about giving Lisa a run for her money on the number of marriages. Margo let it slip that Jack had told her he was not going to pursue Katie anymore and urged her sister to proceed with caution. \n\n\nBrad shared his proposal story with Henry and Vienna at the diner, and the two had very different reactions. Vienna suggested that Brad follow that up with a spectacular grand gesture that would sweep Katie off her feet. Henry, however, opted for caution. His advice was to let Katie make up her own mind in her own way. Vienna kept pushing for the dramatic flair, but something inspired Brad and he rushed out. Henry bet Vienna $2000 that Katie would turn down Brad's proposal but Vienna did not like Henry's resorting to gambling tactics again, so they agreed on a lovemaking session as the prize instead of cash. \n\n\nPaul arrived at the farm and saw Mike Kasnoff. They discussed the sale of the farm and that neither wished to get into a bidding war. They agreed on a price and then Mike suggested that they each make a pitch to Emma and then to let her choose her buyer. Mike gave the first presentation, complete with architect's drawings and renderings of a proposed housing development, which also preserved the privacy of the Snyder Pond. Paul was discouraged, but he guaranteed that all of Worldwide's resources would be combined with Emma's input to create a remarkable project. Mike reminded Emma that he needed a decision as soon as possible. On the sly, Paul called his researchers at Worldwide and asked for information on Mike Kasnoff and his company. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Brad put his inspiration to work. He looked through old videotapes of \"Oakdale Now\" shows and began taping a special segment called \"Katie and Brad Now.\" The tape showed many of the gaffes and goofy moments on air between the two of them. \n\n\nHolden and Lily came home to the farm and were delighted to see Mike. Lily suggested that Mike and Paul's two companies form a partnership and work together on the Snyder project. All parties agreed to that solution and shared a toast to success. Lily and Mike talked separately, and Mike let it be known that he was not ready to confront Katie, his former wife, again. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Jack and Carly discussed getting back together when they were interrupted by a smoke alarm in the house. The toaster was on fire and Jack put it out with salt. Jack's wounds were uncomfortable afterwards because of the sudden movement, so Carly comforted him. \n\n\nAt the TV station, Katie found Brad and thanked him for the tape and all the memories it brought back. She told him she finally had an answer for his proposal, and Brad was stunned to hear her say, \"Yes!\" He vowed to make her the happiest woman on earth. \n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Mike checked in for an indefinite stay, and up in their room, Henry and Vienna finished a marathon lovemaking session. They laughed that they had already celebrated but did not know who had won the bet about Katie's proposal from Brad. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Carly and Jack get advice from Lily and Holden about their relationship and Carly tells Jack they can take things slowly but Jack still doesn't know if he should get back together with Carly. Mike comes back to town and puts in a bid for Emma's land but since Emma can't decide to whom she should sell the farm she takes Lily's suggestion that Mike and Paul become partners. Brad makes a tape of he and Katie's best moments on Oakdale now to prove to Katie that they belong together. Katie can't decide if she should marry Brad and Margo advises her to take some time and then say no to Brad because it is a bad idea to marry him. Katie runs into Jack and asks him what he thinks of the proposal and he tells her to marry Brad if he makes her happy. Katie goes to the TV station and tells Brad yes and then he vows to make her the happiest woman in the world.",
