Henry said Katie would need x-ray vision to see how big the baby was at that moment. Just then, Katie arrived and excitedly told the couple that she had booked an appointment with the sonographer at Oakdale Memorial Hospital so that she could go with Vienna and Henry to see the baby on a sonogram. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Henry tried to think of ways to stop Katie from seeing the sonogram. He fell and pretended to be so badly hurt that he couldn't move an inch. Meanwhile, Vienna went into the examining room for her sonogram. The technician gave Vienna a printout of the sonogram, and when Katie came into the room with Henry, Henry grabbed the photo. Henry then \"accidentally\" dropped the picture in the hallway, where the janitor was mopping, and the picture was ruined. \n\n\nVienna said if it were up to her, she'd go right back in for another sonogram. The technician came out and offered to accommodate her, so they all went back into the examining room. Henry pulled the plug on the sonogram machine out of the wall. The sonographer didn't know what was wrong with the machine, and Henry suggested they leave to give him time to fix it. Henry promised Katie that she would get her picture soon. \n\n\nLiberty went to Brad and Katie's house to pack her bags so that she could move into Parker's room at Carly's house. Brad mistakenly thought Liberty was trying to come back home to live, and he welcomed her with open arms and told her he had known she would realize what a mistake she had made. Liberty finally managed to make her father see that she was just there to move out, and he reluctantly helped her with her bag. \n\n\nCraig went to the diner. Janet told him she owed him, and Craig asked what she meant. Janet said that Parker had told her and Jack that Craig had refused to give him any of the trust fund money to get an apartment. Craig said he was just doing his job as trustee and that the kids weren't old enough to be out on their own like that. \n\n\nJanet said she was very glad that they were all on the same side, and she told Craig she had asked Jack to back off and leave Craig alone. Craig asked if Janet could get Jack to stop viewing him as the enemy, and Janet said Craig could do that himself by removing himself from the situation. Craig said if he resigned as the trustee, some judge might actually award the trust to Parker, and that would be tragic. \n\n\nJanet asked Craig if he could use his influence to try to get Liberty to agree to an annulment. Before Craig could answer, Liberty walked in, carrying her heavy bag. She told them where she was headed, and Janet asked why Liberty hadn't asked Brad to drive her there. Liberty said Brad was too upset by the whole idea, and Liberty hadn't wanted to make things harder for him. \n\n\nCraig then offered to drive Liberty, and Liberty happily accepted. She went outside to wait for Craig, and Janet asked Craig why he had offered to drive Liberty to Carly's. Craig told Janet to have faith in him, and he left the diner. \n\n\nJack arrived at Carly's house and Parker did not warmly receive him. Jack wanted to know why Parker wasn't at school, and Parker informed his dad that he was waiting for Liberty to move in. Jack pointed out that Liberty could move in even without Parker actually being at home, but Parker said he wasn't taking orders from Jack anymore, and he went upstairs. \n\n\nCarly told Jack that Parker resented him at the moment, and Jack needed to back off and let Craig be an ally for them with regard to Parker. Jack said there was no way he would let Craig replace him in Parker's life, but Carly said that Craig would never replace Jack. However, Carly felt that Jack needed to give Parker some room, and he could begin by easing up on him for not being at school for one day. Jack left. \n\n\nCarly went upstairs and suggested to Parker that he get his room ready for his bride by making dresser and closet space available, changing the sheets on the bed, and picking up the floor. Parker appreciated the suggestion and said being married was more complicated than he'd thought. \n\n\nBrad went to the police station and told Jack that Liberty had just packed up and moved to Carly's. Jack said he wasn't any happier about it than Brad was. Brad wanted to know how Jack had let it happen, but Jack said that since Liberty had lived with Brad, Brad should have told her it was a mistake to get so serious about a young boy. Brad said he had tried, but Liberty wouldn't listen to him. Brad said they needed to try to break up Liberty and Parker, but Jack said they had already tried that. Brad said he was really worried about Liberty, but Jack assured him that Carly would look after her. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna tried to figure out some way to get a sonogram of an appropriately aged fetus to show Katie. Henry even went so far as to approach a pregnant woman and chat with her, ultimately asking if she might be willing to sell him some of her early sonogram pictures. The woman asked, \"What kind of sicko are you?\" and walked away. Henry then spotted a technician placing a pile of sonogram pictures and medical records on a table; he waited for her to leave, then managed to grab a picture from the pile. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna went to Katie's to give her the sonogram picture. They almost chickened out, but Katie heard them outside and opened the door before they could leave. Henry gave Katie the photo, and Katie was ecstatic. \n\n\nBrad arrived back home, and Katie asked him why he looked so upset. He told them about Liberty, and they all sympathized with him. Katie showed Brad the sonogram picture to cheer him up, and then she announced that she and Brad had wondered whether Vienna and Henry might like to move in to Liberty's empty room for the rest of Vienna's pregnancy, so that Katie could help take good care of Vienna. Vienna thought that was a terrific idea, although Henry didn't seem so sure. \n\n\nOn the way to Carly's, Craig made a stop at the Oakdale University campus and told Liberty that Janet had said Liberty wanted to go to college. Liberty admitted she was interested in studying journalism and would one day like to be a fashion editor. Craig said that was a great goal, but it might be difficult to achieve in the current situation. \n\n\nLiberty thought Craig meant he wouldn't release any trust fund money for Liberty's college education, so she said she would get a scholarship or enroll in a work-study program to get by. Craig said money wasn't the issue, because as long as Liberty was married to Parker, Craig would release trust fund money for both of their college educations. However, Craig thought Parker might want to have a say in where Liberty went to school, since it was actually Parker's money she'd be using. \n\n\nLiberty said she wouldn't mind staying in Oakdale for college, to be with Parker, but Craig pointed out that if Liberty majored in journalism, there might be other opportunities for her, like study programs overseas, or interviews that Craig could arrange for Liberty with fashion publications in New York. Liberty was excited at the prospect of overseas study and an inside track for a postgraduate job, but Craig said Parker might not be happy if it would mean that Liberty was separated from him. \n\n\nLiberty said Parker would want her to do whatever she wanted to do. Craig said he was glad he'd brought Liberty to the campus, then, because she could see how many opportunities awaited her. \n\n\nWhen Craig and Liberty arrived at Carly's, Parker took Liberty upstairs to show her what he and Carly had done to make room for Liberty's things. Carly asked Craig why he was making things so easy for the kids, and Craig said because fighting them had not been working out all that well. Craig then sat down and told Carly he was getting \"a good seat for the show. Should be starting any minute.\" \n\n\nUpstairs, Liberty told Parker about the detour to Oakdale University's campus. Parker asked why they'd gone there, and Liberty said Craig had lectured her about her future. Parker said Liberty shouldn't listen to Craig and that she should tell Craig to butt out. \n\n\nLiberty became upset with Parker for telling her what to do. Parker went downstairs and told Craig he knew what Craig was trying to do, that Craig was trying to get Liberty mad at Parker. Parker said he thought Craig was doing so in order to win points with Carly, so Craig could get Carly into bed with him. Carly was aghast, and Craig told Parker that wasn't how he operated. Parker told Craig to stay out of his life. \n\n\nParker marched back upstairs, where he told Liberty that he didn't want her to talk to Craig anymore. Liberty told Parker to stop yelling at her. Liberty said that Parker had been aware that she wanted to go to college, and it wasn't something Craig was talking her into doing. Parker calmed down and apologized, and then he tried to kiss Liberty. Liberty stopped him, saying she thought they were talking. \n\n\nParker said that since they were married, they could spend all day in bed together. Liberty, upset, said that Parker must not have been listening to her, because that wasn't going to fix everything. She marched downstairs and left the house, leaving Craig to tell Carly, \"Mission accomplished.\" \n\n\nLiberty went to the farm, where she found her mom and Jack. Liberty asked if she could stay with them for the night. Janet was surprised, because she'd thought Liberty was moving in with Parker. Liberty told them that she and Parker had gotten into a fight because Craig had taken her to Oakdale University, and Parker had freaked out. \n\n\nJack asked why Craig had taken Liberty to the college campus, and she said it wasn't a big deal, that Craig had just asked her some questions about college, and she had started thinking about all the things she would still like to do with her life. Janet told Liberty that she understood completely, and she suggested Liberty go upstairs and relax. After Liberty left the room, Jack warned Janet not to try to tell him what a great guy Craig was; Janet said Jack could figure that out for himself. \n\n\nCarly checked on Parker, but he told her to leave him alone. She went back downstairs and told Craig it might be a good thing for the kids to see that \"marriage isn't a walk in the park.\" Carly told Craig not to gloat, so Craig said instead of gloating, he'd like a reward: a date with Carly. Carly thought Craig was only asking her out to irritate Jack, but Craig said, \"You need to understand one critical thing. Jack has nothing to do with this.\" Craig then gave Carly a long kiss, and said, \"I'll pick you up at eight.\" With that, Craig left.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Vienna is pregnant again. She tells Henry that Brad and Katie will get their baby so there is no need to concern them that she lost the first baby. Katie shows up unexpectedly and insists they go do another sonogram so she can see the baby. At the hospital, Henry feigns a fall and Katie must help him, so she misses the test. Henry and Vienna manage to pawn off an ill-gotten sonogram as their own and shows it to Katie and Brad. Katie blurts out that she'd like Vienna and Henry to move in with them. Brad is uncertain and so is Henry, but Vienna accepts immediately. Brad is shocked when Liberty tells him that she is not moving back in with him, but living at Carly's.

They are not enemies so they need to work together, not be so soft this time. Craig drives Liberty by the University and they sit and chat about her future. He focuses on her decision to be a journalist in the fashion industry. He encourage that but points out that will only work if Parker doesn't mind and lets her go to New York and abroad. Parker is not happy and informs Craig that he's on to his plan. First, he won't give him his money and now he's talking to Liberty and saying things so she will get mad at him.
