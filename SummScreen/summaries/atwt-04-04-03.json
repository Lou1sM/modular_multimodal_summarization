He asks her where the emergency room is because he accidentally cut a piece of his finger off and he needs attention.  Katie swoons and feints into his arms.  Somehow Mike catches her, and carries her to a nearby bed.  She wakes up a moment later and Mike presses the nurse-call button.  Chris Hughes comes into the room, and then Mike heads for the ER.  Katie tries to get back to work, but too much time has passed and her shift is now over.  She's discouraged about working in the medical field because she feinted at the sight of Mike's blood.  Chris tells her not to give up on her new job so quickly.  He invites her out to Java with his buds later, but she's skeptical of his motives.  Chris tells her to stop by if she changes her mind.  After Chris leaves, Katie pouts and then screams \"Simon!?  Why did you do this to me!?\" as she hurtles a empty bedpan behind her in frustration.  The bedpan almost hits a patched-up Mike in the shins.  He tells her he found the finger part attached to some gray tape.  Katie starts to swoon again, but gets a hold of herself.  Katie explains part of her frustration about throwing the bedpan, and Mike also encourages her not to quit after the first day on the job.\n\n\nEmily and Hal walk into a holding cell at Alison's prison where a prison coordinator greets them.  Regina advises that according to house rules, Alison isn't supposed to have any visitors for her first month in the joint.  But since Hal has been generous with favors in the past, Regina looks the other way and allows one final visit.  Regina tells them that Alison was judged to be fit enough to stay in Level 1 of the prison, the level with the least supervision.  Emily is relieved to hear the good news.  Alison is brought to the holding area and races up to hug Emily.  She begs Emily to take her back to court so they can try to cut a different deal.  Hal says it's too late for that.  Alison says she'll be staying with two roommates.  Emily tries to give Alison encouragement to stay strong.  Hal and Emily leave, and Regina takes Alison to her cell.  Emily looks at her bag of belongings, then the lockers along the wall.  Next she sees something on her roommates bed.  She sits down and picks it up.  Just then her two cellmates walk in.  Both have a gruff and superior attitude.  The leader, a tough redhead named Nicole, brushes Alison's hand away when she tries to introduce herself.  Nicole asks, \"Who are you supposed to be?  Malibu Barbie?\"  Her sidekick snickers.  Alison again tries to make friends, but Nicole calmly threatens, \"I don't care who you're supposed to be.  You touch my stuff again, and I'll cut you.\"  Alison starts to reveal her backbone knowing that these two girls won't be friendly anytime soon.  She retreats to her duffel bag and continues to unpack.  Nicole says they know she's part of a cop family and that Malibu will probably be getting special privileges.  The dinner bell rings, and as the girls leave, Alison asks if she could sit with them since they're the only two girls she knows.  They both tell her she can sit with them only if they she gives them her dinner.  Alison scoffs, and Nicole tells her, \"You try to sit with us and I'll shove your tray down your throat...sideways.\"  Later, after dinner, Alison is looking for her teddy bear.  Nicole and her friend play keep-away with it until Alison gets into a tugging match.  The teddy bear loses and its arm is torn off.  Alison curls up into a fetal position on her bed, as Nicole and her friend laugh.\n\n\nMarshall's lawyer drops by with a private investigator to see Travers.  The PI gives an envelope to Marshall and he finds a mock-up of his side of the story including an intimate photo of Travers and Jessica from his year-old sex-tape.  The lawyer wants to distribute the story to every tabloid in the mid-west, but Marshall wants to wait and see what he can reap from the seeds he recently planted.\n\n\nJessica doesn't understand why Ben is asking her to drop her rape case against Marshall.  Ben was supporting her 100% just one day earlier.  Ben says, \"I love you and I don't want to see you publicly destroyed.\"  Jessica is shocked, \"Somebody got to you, didn't they?  Who?\"  Ben reluctantly says it was Marshall.  He then goes on to explain what was truly inside the package that was delivered to him last night.  Jessica doesn't care what Marshall plans to do.  \"If I don't go forward, he'll violate me all over again.\"  Ben gets angry, \"You can't win this trial!  You can't win it!!  My own brother doesn't believe you.  How are you going to convince twelve total strangers?\"  Jessica looks as if she's just been stabbed with the truth.  \"At least I'll have my self-respect.\"  She accuses Bonnie, Isaac, and Ben of conspiring against her behind her back.  Ben pushes her further, \"Bury this is some corner of your mind and move on!\"  Jessica stands firm, \"This will hurt me until I see justice done.  I've made up my mind.  I am going through with this.\"  Ben sighs, turns on his heels, and walks out.\n\n\nCraig is again trying to coerce Carly into designing clothes while waiting out her high-risk pregnancy.  Carly isn't filled with the same vigor as usual, and defeatedly tells him, \"I have the desire to design, but no talent right now to back it up.\"  He won't let up, so she starts throwing her sketch pencils at him.  She finally drives him from Emma's kitchen when she throws her sketchbook at him.  Later she pours herself a glass of water, and Craig pops up again from behind the refrigerator.  He doesn't buy Carly's excuse that she's not designing because of her pregnancy.  He says, \"It's just the two of us here.  You don't have to be motherly like for Jack.  You don't have to be monosyllabic-like for Mike.  Just tell me the truth.\"  Carly relents and says she's afraid of not being special, \"without inspiration, I've got nothing!\"  Carly swoons and Craig gets her to sit down.  After Carly determines her blood pressure has returned to normal, Craig gets her to try a breathing exercise.  She lies on the floor and takes a few breaths.  Soon she falls asleep.  When Craig is about to put a blanket on Carly, Jack returns from his wild goose chase.  He wonders what Craig did to Carly.  After all the confusion is cleared up, Jack asks Carly to make a clear decision.  He asks her to tell Craig where she stands with Monte-Carlo.  Carly tells Craig that she's out.  Craig accepts this, and walks out.  Carly sees him to the porch, where Craig pouts that Monte-Carlo is now over forever for the duo.  When Carly returns inside, Craig echos something Carly said earlier, \"Unless Barbar disappears...\"\n\n\nLater, Jessica finds Marshall in the Lakeview Lounge.  She verbally abuses him, putting him on notice.  \"You are going to trial and then you are going to jail.\"  After she leaves, Marshall calls over the PI sitting at the bar.  Travers tells him to go forward with publishing the intimate photo.\n\n\n",
