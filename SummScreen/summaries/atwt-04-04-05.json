Barbara interrupts to confront him, but Craig tells everyone that Barbara is backing the new Boulevard Jeans.  Barbara insists that her intention was to pay Craig to leave Jennifer alone, not to help him steal Jennifer's business.  Barbara leaves and rushes to Jennifer to tell her and Dusty that Craig is meeting with the press.  Jennifer immediately leaves to publicly accuse Craig of stealing her business, and Barbara starts making plans to help Jennifer start over.  Dusty becomes angry with Barbara and slings her over his shoulder to eject her from the office.  Jennifer begins to confront Craig, but just as she starts to talk to the press, she becomes dizzy. Jennifer recovers and, in front of the cameras, tells Craig that he does not have her gift, and that he will never have anything from her again. Jennifer rushes back to the office and consults her calendar, then takes a pregnancy test.  Dusty sees her sitting on the couch through the locked door.\n\n\nKatie tells Henry that the new gym is not making money, so Henry reluctantly agrees to get a job.  However, just as Henry makes his first call to a potential employer, Mike comes into the gym to work out, and Henry immediately hangs up the phone.\n\n\nAttorney Michael Baldwin from Genoa City waits at the courthouse to help Keith get custody of JJ Carly, Jack, Keith, and Holden all offer to testify to Les' abusive nature, but Michael tells Carly that, since she is accused as an accessory to Julia's murder, her testimony could only hurt Keith's chance to become JJ's guardian.  Les arrives and tells Holden, Jack and Keith that, when he wins, none of them will every see JJ again.  All the men go into the courtroom, leaving Carly and JJ in the hall.  JJ clutches Carly's hand.  In the courtroom, Michael introduces evidence of Les' assaulting Julia.  In a surprise move, Les' lawyer tells of Michael's past conviction of attempted murder and attempted rape.  The judge declares this evidence inadmissible. Jack, Holden, and Keith all testify that both Julia and JJ were terrified of Les.  Les' lawyer introduces evidence that Les was rehabilitated in prison and that he has a job waiting for him in Texas.   The judge declares a recess after which JJ will testify. In the hall, Les asks for private time with JJ, and tells JJ that, if JJ says one thing against Les, Les will kill Jack - \"I'll cut his throat.\"  Jack walks up in time to hear the frightened JJ repeat after Les, \"I love my daddy.\"  In the courtroom JJ repeats obviously memorized phrases, \"I love my dad.  He treats me good.  I want to live with him forever and ever.\"  Jack shouts his objections.\n\n\nAt the police station, Lily recalls Keith's promise to find Julia's murder and asks Lucinda to keep Keith away from Luke.  Jessica comes in and reports that the psychiatrist has found Lily completely sane and rational.  Jessica sternly tells Lily that, if she pleads guilty to premeditated murder, she will face a mandatory life sentence with no chance of parole.  Lily steadfastly insists that she will plead guilty, and Jessica leaves to report Lily's decision to the district attorney.  Lucinda tells Lily that she is aware that Lily is protecting her son, but begs her not to abandon her daughters.  Lily remains resolute, so Lucinda brings Natalie and Faith to see Lily. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Michael Baldwin tries to help Keith and Jake with J.J.'s custody case, but Sweeny's lawyer pulls a rabbit out of his hat as he points out Michael's own less-than-stellar history. Outside in the hallway, Carly is touched as J.J. reaches out to her for comfort, and allows her to hold him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig has stolen Jen's Street Jeans designs, and is marketing them at a Trunk Show under the name of Boulevard Jeans, at a fraction of the cost. Jen goes to confront Craig, only to leave after feeling ill. She later locks herself in her office and takes a pregnancy test. Katie and Henry realize the gym they bought is not pulling in the money they need to stay afloat, so Henry begrudgingly offers to become a productive member of the workforce by getting an actual job. He later shows back up having gotten a job as a limo driver. Lucinda comes up with another plan involving Faith and Natalie to try to guilt Lily into finally telling the truth about Julia's murder. Keith, Holden, Jack and Carly join forces at a hearing to keep Les from getting custody of JJ. It looks like Les is going to win when he is able to intimidate JJ by threatening to kill Jack if JJ doesn't support Les' bid for custody on the stand.",
