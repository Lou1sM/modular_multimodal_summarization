Carly gave Jack the news and said she felt like her whole family was deserting her. Then she said she was a big girl and needed to deal with her problems on her own. Jack told Carly he'd like to say goodbye to Gwen and Will, too. Parker came home and said Will had called him, and Jack said they could all go to the party together. \n\n\nAaron told Sofie about Will and Gwen's farewell party and tried to get Sofie to go with him, but she didn't want to have to say goodbye to Hallie once again. Alison convinced Chris that he needed to make an appearance at Will and Gwen's house to say goodbye and to apologize for what had happened during the custody hearing, when he had helped Sofie try to win Hallie back. \n\n\nNoah told Luke he thought he should go to Will and Gwen's party with Ameera, for appearance's sake. Luke said that was fine, and when Casey arrived at the farm, Luke said Casey could be his \"date.\" Casey didn't like the idea but went along with it when Ameera said she was glad he was going to the party with them. \n\n\nAs Paul and Barbara arrived at Will and Gwen's cottage, Barbara almost fainted. She told Paul it was probably the emotion of the day catching up with her. When they went inside, Paul told Will that although Barbara was upset, Will and Gwen needed to make this move for their own sakes. He assured Will he would take good care of their mom. Meanwhile, Barbara said goodbye to Hallie. She then hugged both Will and Gwen and told them each goodbye, becoming tearful as she did so. Barbara left, and outside, she had another episode of weakness. \n\n\nCarly, Jack, and Parker arrived at the cottage to say their goodbyes to Will and Gwen. Carly went to take a picture of Gwen and Hallie, and Gwen asked what was going on with Carly and Jack. Carly said she was working on it, and Gwen said that was good to hear. Carly said she would need to earn Jack's trust again, which would take time and patience. \n\n\nJack reminded Will that Hal had been Jack's best friend and mentor, and he told Will that if he ever needed anything, all he had to do was call. Paul told Parker he realized Parker would miss his brother; Paul then said if Parker ever needed anything, \"I've got the big brother thing covered.\" Will then took a picture of Jack, Carly, Gwen, and Parker. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Sofie saw Barbara, who almost collapsed in the lobby. Sofie and a hotel employee rushed to her side, and Sofie told Barbara she would take her to the hospital. There, Barbara's doctor told her the tumor had become resistant to radiation and that they needed to operate immediately. Sofie wanted to let Gwen and Will know, but Barbara begged her not to tell them. \n\n\nAaron arrived at Will and Gwen's party, followed closely by Alison and Chris. Alison was surprised to see Aaron back in town, and Aaron was surprised to see Chris. When Will and Gwen opened the door, Alison explained that she had invited Chris to come. Chris then apologized to Will and Gwen for having supported Sofie in the adoption proceedings; Will said Chris had ambushed them and should have come and told them what he was going to do before he did it. However, Gwen and Will both accepted Chris's apology. \n\n\nAaron asked Alison if she was back with Chris. After telling him it was none of his business, Alison said they were just friends. Chris started to leave, and Alison followed him and asked how things had gone. Chris said Gwen and Will had accepted his apology. He then told Alison he had the rest of the day off and invited her to join him. \n\n\nChris and Alison went to Old Town and had ice cream cones. They ran into Susan, who said she was expecting Alison for dinner that evening. Alison said, \"Yes, mother,\" and Susan left. Chris took Alison to the park to fly a kite. They had fun flying the kite and then decided to cut it loose, because they'd never been allowed to do that when they were kids. They lay down in the sun and talked about places they'd been. Chris said getting away was nice, but coming home wasn't so bad either. \n\n\nNoah, Ameera, Luke, and Casey arrived at the party, and they explained the marriage arrangement and the phony boyfriend relationship between Luke and Casey. Paul decided it was time to leave, and he told Will he'd like to try to be a better brother to him. They embraced, and then Sofie arrived. Aaron explained that he had told Sofie about the party so she could say goodbye to Hallie, and Gwen took Sofie back to the bedroom to see the baby. After a tearful goodbye to Hallie, Sofie left, followed by Paul. \n\n\nOutside the cottage, Sofie told Paul she hadn't wanted another emotional goodbye with Hallie, and Paul asked why she'd come. Sofie said because Paul hadn't answered his cell phone, and she wanted him to know his mother was in surgery, having her tumor removed. She explained that Barbara didn't want Will and Gwen to know. Paul and Sofie left to go to the hospital. They sat together in the waiting area, and Paul said after everything Barbara had survived, he couldn't believe cancer would be her downfall. Sofie asked what else Barbara had survived, and Paul said his father, for one thing. He then said even when Barbara and he and Will fought, it was usually because Barbara wanted what was best for them. He told Sofie he hoped he would have a chance to tell Barbara he was proud of her. \n\n\nPaul asked Sofie how she was doing after saying goodbye to Hallie again, and Sofie said it helped to have someone else to think about. The doctor came to the waiting room and told Paul that Barbara's surgery had been a success. Paul and Sofie smiled and hugged each other in their relief. \n\n\nGwen told Will that seeing Sofie with Hallie had been hard for her, but she said it also showed her that leaving Oakdale was the best thing for everyone. They rejoined the party, and Aaron told them he was leaving. Will asked Luke to take a picture of him, Gwen, and Aaron. After Aaron left, Ameera told Gwen and Will about the immigration people checking up on her and Noah, and she said she didn't know how much longer they could fool the immigration people, since they were living in separate rooms in someone else's house. Gwen suggested perhaps Noah and Ameera could rent the cottage, because Lucinda would need a new tenant. \n\n\nGwen told Luke that since Lucinda was his grandmother, getting the cottage shouldn't be a problem, and this way, they could all have more time together. Ameera agreed that the plan could work. Casey was reluctant to continue his role as the gay boyfriend, but Ameera told him he'd be doing a good deed and helping her. He then agreed, but said, \"I reserve the right to back out whenever I need to.\" Will then took a picture of the new tenants and their friends, as Luke grabbed Casey and kissed him on the cheek, much to his dismay. The party guests all departed, and Will toasted Gwen, saying, \"Here's to us, and the rest of our lives,\" and they kissed. \n\n\nAaron went to the Lakeview to find Sofie but was told she had taken Barbara to the hospital. He went to the hospital and found Sofie and Paul. Paul told Aaron that Barbara was apparently going to be okay, and he asked Aaron to take Sofie to get something to eat. Sofie said she should wait, but Paul assured her Barbara would understand, and he thanked her again for letting him know about the surgery and waiting with his mom. Paul went in to see Barbara, and Aaron took Sofie out to get dinner. \n\n\nJack, Parker, and Carly went back to Carly's house. Carly went outside to gather her thoughts, and Parker told Jack that if he cared about Carly, he would try to help her feel better. Jack decided to do as Parker suggested and went to look for Carly, but she wasn't on the porch. He found her sitting by the pond. Carly told Jack he didn't need to try to comfort her, since he was no longer her husband or her lover. He suggested he could be her friend, and she said platonic friendship had never been their \"thing.\" Jack agreed and said they had always had highs and lows, moving from one crisis to another, but never had the foundation of friendship to fall back on. \n\n\nCarly asked if friendship was all they could have, and Jack said he couldn't make any promises, but they had to start somewhere. Jack offered his hand and asked if Carly would be his friend, and she took his hand and said she'd do anything he asked. They returned to her house, where she said she thought she'd sit outside and watch the sunset. Jack offered to get a couple of beers and join her, and Carly said that would be nice. Parker came to the door and saw his mom and Jack together outside on the porch. \n\n\n",
