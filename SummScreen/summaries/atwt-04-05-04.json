Bonnie and Isaac have corresponded while she was in prison, and now the two of them want to make a family which includes Sarah.  Jessica lovingly gives her blessing, although she will now have to part with Sarah, just after she has learned to love her.\n\n\nAt B.R.O., Jennifer is disappointed that Jordan has suggested meeting her at metro for the benefit for the Rose Foundation. While she explains to Barbara that she would prefer to go as Jordan's date, Barbara's vision begins to blur again.  Jennifer is a little alarmed at Barbara's demeanor, but Barbara urges Jennifer to go on to the benefit.  After Jennifer leaves, a frightened Barbara collapses on the sofa.  At the Lakeview Hotel, Rosanna tells Jordan that Paul has hired Carly to design for him, and that Paul plans to publicly humiliate Barbara.  Rosanna advises Jordan to \"get out of B.R.O. before it's too late,\" then offers him a job working for her at Cabot Motors.  Rosanna assures Jordan that she has researched him exhaustively and the offer is bona fide.  Jordan leaves, telling Rosanna that he will consider what she has told him, and goes directly to B.R.O., where he finds Barbara fumbling around, unable to see.  He takes her home after she refuses to go to the hospital, which she sees as letting her family down again.\n\n\nAt the metro, Dusty finds Lily placing a single rose beside the poster of Rose, as she finishes preparing for the benefit.  Dusty shows Lily the generous check from Paul, which he suggests destroying.  Holden walks up and gives his opinion, \"The cause is more important than the players,\" which elicits a warm hug from Lily.\n\n\nWhen Alison and Chris arrive at the metro for the benefit, everyone congratulates Alison on her beautiful and tasteful appearance.  Although determined to behave like a lady, the first thing Alison encounters is her new hospital supervisor, Tish Waldren, making a play for Chris.  Trish can't keep her hands off Chris, and then cattily asks Alison where she \"went to school.\"  Tish continues to try to hog the spotlight and make Alison look bad, but Alison holds her own admirably.  Finally, Tish finds Alison in the ladies' room and gets down and dirty, taunting, \"When you break [Chris'] heart, I'll be there to pick up the pieces, just like I was after your five-minute marriage to Aaron Snyder.\"  Alison pushes Tish into a stall, and we hear a flushing sound.  Minutes later, Alison reappears at the party and entices Chris to leave.   In the restroom, a soaking-wet Tish snarls, \"You'll pay for this.  This is war, Alison Stewart!\"\n\n\nPaul makes his entrance at the benefit, and asks to speak to Lily alone.  Paul tells Rose that he is constantly tormented by his part in Rose's death, and he begs Lily to keep the money and not tell anyone where it came from.  He starts to leave, but Lily asks him to stay while she makes her speech.  After urging the crowd to help keep Rose's dream alive, Lily announces that they have already received a large donation from Paul Ryan.\n\n\nJennifer and Jordan meet at the fundraiser, and he explains that he was delayed by a conference call.  Paul comes up and there is noticeable tension between the two men, which Jennifer tries to smooth over.\n\n\nWhen the singer does not show up at the benefit, Lily steps in to sing Rose's favorite song, \"I'll Be Here With You.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty and Lily got ready for the Rose Foundation benefit at Metro. He showed her a check from Paul \u0096 he didn't want her to accept it. Holden said he believed Rose would have forgiven Paul \u0096 but he left the decision about Paul to Lily. Paul arrived just as Lily was going to give her speech. He said his prison was remembering the hateful things he said to Rose at the church. He wanted Lily to take the check \u0096 she never had to mention where she had gotten it. At the end of her speech Lily acknowledged the large donation Paul had made to the Foundation \u0096 Dusty was not pleased. The band arrived without a lead singer \u0096 Lily was disappointed because they were supposed to perform Rose's favorite song. Lily stepped in for the lead singer.
