    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAfter the news that Bob and Kim had not been legally married 25 years before sank in, everyone was stunned, and Kim told Bob that she thought they should \"examine their options separately\" before they rushed into getting remarried.  Bob was shocked that Kim wanted \"space,\" and Kim asked if she could stay with Barbara temporarily.  Kim tearfully thanked everyone for the party, and then she walked out.  Lisa scolded Bob to go after Kim, so he dashed after her.  They talked out on Tom and Margo's patio, and Bob offered to rearrange his work schedule so that they could take several days off and get married again.\n\n\nKim, however, called the wedding fiasco a \"blessing in disguise,\" and she took off.  Bob went back inside and announced that his wife was not sure that she wanted to be married to him anymore.  He was angry and announced that he was going to go have a drink.  He walked out, as Tom declared that if Bob and Kim couldn't make it, there was no hope for any of the rest of them.\n\n\nMargo urged Tom to go after his father, so Tom left with the plan that he would call Casey and Chris for backup when he found Bob.  Casey was gloomy about all happy endings, and Katie rightly deduced that he was still angry about Alison's betrayal.  Casey left, and Margo decided to go to Barbara's suite at the Lakeview to talk with Kim.  Chris took a call then from Tom, who had found Bob drinking at the Lakeview bar.  Chris promised to join them as soon as possible.\n\n\nIn Barbara's suite, Margo told Kim that Bob was down in the bar with Tom, and that relieved Kim.  Barbara suggested that Kim put the poor guy out of his misery by telling him she would remarry him, but Kim refused to even consider it. Her point of view was that Bob needed to figure out how often they had forgiven each other over the years, and she flashed back to when Bob learned that she was pregnant with their child, Frannie.  Then she told Barbara that Bob's job was going to kill him, and she cried that she couldn't watch her husband work himself into an early grave.  She prayed that Bob would realize that he loved her more than he loved the hospital.\n\n\nBarbara explained to Kim that she and Bob were the \"cornerstone\" of their whole family, and therefore everyone was affected by decisions the two of them made. Kim cried that she used to think that she meant everything to Bob, but she no longer believed that.\n\n\nDownstairs in the bar, Bob remembered when he and Kim had first awakened as man and wife.  Kim had said that she hoped that they would always remain such good friends.  Tom appeared in the bar, and Bob called Kim \"stubborn.\"  Then he declared that he would not have his wife running his life.  Lisa found the men there, and she asked Tom to give her some time alone with his dad.  Tom went to the lobby, and Lisa sat next to Bob and said that she thought Kim was right; the mix-up with the fake minister was, indeed, a blessing for Bob and Lisa.  She reminded him that at one time, the two of them had \"quite a spark,\" and perhaps they had a chance to find out if it was still there.  Bob looked dumbfounded, and then he began to laugh.\n\n\nBoth of them flashed back to when they were expecting Tom and the quiet times they had shared.  Lisa then wondered aloud if they had another chance to rekindle their love, but Bob said he would rather remember the pair of them \"fondly.\"  Then he said that he loved only Kim, whether she was his wife or not.\n\n\nKatie slipped out to the hospital to find Alison.  When she found the girl, Alison said that Casey had made her feel unwelcome at the house, so she had changed her mind about staying.  Katie asked her not to give up because both Casey and Chris cared about her.  Alison said her aborted wedding to Casey had been \"a train wreck\" for the entire family, but Katie said all members of the Hughes family had messed up at one time or another.  Katie wanted Alison to go to the remarriage when it occurred, and Alison promised to think about it.\n\n\nTom, Chris, and Casey moved Bob out of the bar into the lounge, and Bob was stunned that Tom had asked Bob's son and grandson to give him marital advice. He was also hurt that Kim had walked out on him, but Chris reminded his father that Bob had done the same thing to Kim after his affair with Susan Stewart.  Chris said he remembered most the day that his parents renewed their vows after reconciling after the affair, and everyone flashed back on the renewal ceremony in which both promised to deal with their problems openly and honestly.  Chris said that both his parents were scared to death of getting old.\n\n\nCasey blurted out the question of when the last time was that Bob had told Kim she was \"hot.\"  Tom was horrified, but Bob wanted to hear what the young man had to say.  Casey asked how Kim was supposed to feel if her husband kept putting his job before everything and everyone else.  Tom jumped in and suggested that Bob \"woo\" Kim again.  Bob flashed back on his first proposal to Kim, and then he griped that he had already asked her earlier that night, and she had turned him down.  Casey said Bob should try again, but he should ask the woman he loved, not his wife.\n\n\nBob knocked on the door of Barbara's suite and asked to speak with Kim.  He walked in and asked Kim how she was, and she replied, \"Single.\"  Bob said he was drowning in unsolicited marriage advice, but the main issue was that even the slightest chance of losing Kim was devastating to him.  He talked about \"new beginnings,\" but Kim thought he was talking about being with someone else.  They got that straightened out, and Bob said he only wanted Kim.  She stopped him there and said she needed more than \"sweet words;\" she needed him -- alive.  Bob reached into his pocket and brought out an envelope, which he handed Kim.  He explained that it contained his resignation from the hospital.\n\n\nNext Bob asked Kim to marry him again, but Kim did not reply.  Instead, she tore the envelope into little pieces.  She cried that she didn't want him to give up his entire work; she wanted uninterrupted dinners, and date nights, and a weekend rendezvous now and then, and kissing, and \"wooing.\"  Bob agreed and asked for a sunrise ceremony, and then Kim agreed.\n\n\nThe next morning, Barbara asked if her \"Auntie Kim\" was ready, and Kim answered, \"You bet I am!\"  At Tom and Margo's, Susan pinned a boutonni\u00e8re on Bob's jacket, and she made a plea for another chance at romance with him before he got locked in for life.  Bob was surprised, but he said he only loved Kim.  When he walked away, Lisa complimented Susan on her nice \"hit,\" but Susan was mortified.  Lisa said if she had to \"put the moves on Bob,\" then so did Susan, because it was all part of their plan.  Bob realized what had happened, and he laughed.\n\n\nChris walked in with the minister, and Tom and Margo asked for the minister's credentials and his driver's license.  Katie and Henry arrived, and finally Barbara entered with Kim.  Henry told Barbara how hot she looked, and they both left the living room.  Everyone gathered around for the ceremony, but Kim missed Barbara.  She did not know that her niece had followed Henry into one of the bedrooms and both were lying on the bed exchanging kisses.  Tom called out to Barbara, so she got up and ran downstairs.  Casey happened to look outside and noticed Alison standing there with a gift bag.  He had a change of heart, so he invited her in to witness the marriage, as Henry slunk back into the living room, unnoticed by everyone except Katie.\n\n\nThe minister began, and \"Robert\" and \"Kimberly\" recited their vows.  The minister then pronounced them husband and wife, and Tom passed out champagne flutes and gave a lovely toast.  Kim and Bob hugged Alison, and Casey said some pleasant things to her.\n\n\nBarbara sidled up to Henry and began a verbal seduction, which he could not resist.  Finally he asked her if she knew where the bathroom was, and Barbara said, \"Follow me.\"  Chris turned to Katie and accused her of \"meddling\" because she had invited Alison.  Katie was hurt, so she walked out of the living room and headed for the bathroom.  As she reached for the door, Barbara threw it open and was obviously startled to see Katie there.  Barbara adjusted her dress and prattled on about how that was the bathroom.  Katie went into the bathroom, but she noticed movement behind the shower curtain.  She pulled it aside and found Henry rearranging his clothing.  He claimed to have \"blacked out,\" but Katie knew better.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and Bob answered it.  Outside stood Frannie, Bob and Kim's daughter, wishing her parents a wonderful anniversary.  Frannie walked in and made a toast to her folks, and Bob returned the toast by saying how thankful they all were for \"every day the world turned.\"\n\n\n",
