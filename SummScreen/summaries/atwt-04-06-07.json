    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Hughes' house, Margo tells Casey that house arrest is not going to be an easy thing for him; she wants him to know it means no TV, no computer games, no goofing off. She wants him to do chores around the house and study and realize what a deal he's been handed because Tom worked every angle he could to keep him out of jail. Casey tells her he knows that and appreciates it and is really sorry for everything he's put them through. Margo leaves to go to work, and Maddie comes in and tells Casey she's sorry about what just happened, but Casey says he deserves it. They make out, although Maddie pulls back, feeling a little guilty about the whole situation.\n\n\nGwen awakens from a nightmare, but when Will wakes up, too, and tries to hold her, she shies away from him. After she gets dressed, she tells Will she needs some alone time and wants to go check on Maddie and Casey. After she's gone, Margo comes to the door and tells Will she just got a call on her cell phone from Adam, although he didn't stay on the line long enough for her to try to trace the call. She tells Will she tried to talk Adam into coming home, but he hung up. Will tells her he appreciates how good she's always been to him, and Margo apologizes for how both of her sons have treated Will and Gwen. Will reminds her that since Margo has watched him grow up, she's also seen him at his worst, and he says that people change, and maybe Adam will change, too. Margo thanks him for saying that and leaves, asking him to let Gwen know about Adam's call and how sorry she is about everything that happened.\n\n\nGwen goes to Tom and Margo's house, where she realizes she's interrupting a passionate moment between Casey and Maddie. Casey goes upstairs while Maddie follows Gwen outside to find out why she's upset; Gwen says things aren't good between her and Will because of how upset she still is about what happened with Adam. Maddie tells her that will change with time, and that Will knows that and will be patient with her. Gwen says Will said the same thing, but it's hard to believe right now. Maddie says she's living proof that you can get past something like that, since she's now gotten past what happened with Louis enough to be able to be with Casey. Gwen is obviously upset about that turn of events, and when Maddie asks why, Gwen says Maddie's being stupid, taking chances being with Casey like that in his parents' house, where they might walk in on them like Gwen just about did, and when Casey's under house arrest. Maddie angrily tells Gwen that they don't know how long Casey will get to remain at home before he might have to go to prison, and they're in love and aren't going to waste the time they have together. Gwen asks if they're at least using condoms, and Maddie says she's not stupid no matter what Gwen might think. Gwen apologizes and says she's happy for them. Her cell phone rings, and it's Will, calling to see if she can come home so he can talk to her about something. She tells Maddie goodbye, asking if they're still friends, and Maddie says of course they are.\n\n\nWhen Gwen gets home, Will tells her about Margo's visit and Adam's phone call, and Gwen is upset again, saying she's scared that Adam might come back, and she's mad at herself for being scared. Will reassures her that it's okay to be scared but says that she's strong, and she'll get through this, and he'll be there for her.\n\n\nCasey comes back downstairs, and he and Maddie start undressing and getting ready to make love, when Margo walks in unexpectedly.\n\n\nIn Las Vegas, Emily hides in another room in the hotel suite while Dusty talks to Lance, the pornographic movie producer, about hiring some of his \"girls.\" After deciding that Dusty is a legitimate producer, Lance calls the girls and tells them to come on up; Dusty tells him to leave, because he wants to talk to the girls alone. Alison comes in with 2 other girls and is surprised to see it's Dusty; Dusty pays the other 2 girls to leave, and then Alison says Emily should go ahead and come out, because she knows she must be there somewhere. Emily comes out, and they ask why Alison is there, making porn movies. They want to know if Lance has something on her and is forcing her to be there. Alison says this is her chosen career now, and that she's a big girl who can take care of herself. She says she came to Vegas with a guy who promised to take care of everything but then left her there, and that after feeling rejected by the Snyders and her family in Oakdale and now this guy, she just wants to be in control of her own life, and this is how she's doing it. Emily says if she's so satisfied with how her life is going, she won't mind if Emily calls their mom and tells her what Alison is doing. Alison tells her to go ahead but to bear in mind that news like this might be enough to drive Susan back to drinking. Emily backs down but says she won't leave unless Alison comes with her; Alison tells Emily that she and Dusty need to go back to Oakdale and leave her alone or she'll call Susan herself and leave Emily to deal with the fallout from that. She says she has to go \"freshen up,\" and while she's out of the room, Dusty tells Emily that Alison's in more trouble than they thought. When Alison comes back out, Dusty grabs her purse, saying he noticed it doesn't really go with the rest of her outfit, and when he empties it out on the floor, a vial full of drugs falls out.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Jade is looking at her laptop while Luke waits for her to be ready to go to the mall with him.

When Luke comes back in, Jade says she can't go to the mall, and Luke is upset, accusing Jade of not caring about the family. He says yesterday she was worried about Faith, but today, she seems uninterested. Jade protests that Faith is with Lily and Holden, and she says she doesn't think they want her butting into that situation right now. Luke apologizes, and Jade promises she and Luke can go to the mall tomorrow. She leaves and goes to Old Town, where a dark-haired girl approaches her, lugging a large suitcase and saying she's the girl Jade's been looking for. Jade takes one look at her and says no, she's not, but the girl won't take no for an answer and ends up following Jade to Al's Diner. Inside the diner, she tells Jade she came from a town called Turlock, thinking she could make a new life for herself in Oakdale, and she wants to know why Jade wanted to hire a look-alike and when she'll get to meet her \"twin.\" Jade says, \"Never,\" but just then, Will and Gwen walk in, and the girl, whose name is Cleo Babbitt, jumps up, excited to see her \"twin.\" Before she can go over to Gwen, Jade stands up and blocks her way.\n\n\n\n\n",
