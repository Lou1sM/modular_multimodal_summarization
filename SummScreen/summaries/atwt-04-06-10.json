    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt Carly's house, Janet asked Liberty and Parker what they were doing. Liberty told her mom that she wanted to get out of the house, because she'd been confined to the \"bubble\" at the hospital in Minnesota. Janet thought that was a bad idea, because Liberty would be exposed to too many germs. Parker agreed with Janet, which made Liberty mad. Janet thanked Parker and told him to make sure Liberty didn't go anywhere, then Janet left.\n\n\nLiberty told Parker that she really wanted to get out of the house for just a while, and she pleaded with him and looked at him with the saddest expression she could muster. Parker told her to stop but eventually gave in and said they could go out for a while. Liberty hugged Parker and thanked him, then asked if they could get fries somewhere. Parker agreed but told Liberty that they had to stop somewhere first.\n\n\nJanet went to the hospital to visit Dusty, and she talked to him even though he was still unconscious. As she talked, Janet noticed Dusty's hand moving, and then Dusty opened his eyes. Janet was elated, especially when Dusty said her name. However, right after saying Janet's name, Dusty passed out. Janet jumped up and went into the hallway to get help.\n\n\nAt Monte Carlo, Craig spoke to Ellis on the phone and assured him that once Carly had a chance to show off her designs at the fashion show in Milan, investors would line up to put money into the company. While Craig was talking, Gabriel walked in, and Craig hung up the phone. Craig reminded Gabriel that he'd been fired, but Gabriel told Craig that Carly had rehired him. Craig told Gabriel that Carly ran the creative end of the business, but Craig handled the financial end, including making all personnel decisions. Gabriel wondered whether Craig thought he was some type of industrial spy, and whether that meant Craig had something to hide.\n\n\nJack drove Carly to work and began kissing her while they were parked outside the building. Jack wanted to get frisky in the back seat of the car, which Carly said wasn't very grown-up of him, but she eventually agreed to Jack's desire, provided that Jack moved the car to the end of the parking lot first. As Jack got ready to do that, his cell phone rang, and Carly insisted that Jack answer it. It was Janet, who told Jack about Dusty's temporary awakening. Jack could tell that Janet was upset that Dusty had slipped back into unconsciousness, and Jack agreed to meet Janet at the hospital. When he hung up, Jack told Carly that all he wanted was to be alone with her. Carly said it wasn't the right time, and she got out of the car.\n\n\nCarly walked into the office and asked what was happening, and Gabriel informed her that Craig had just fired him again. Carly told him that she would rehire him. Craig implored Carly to reconsider and pointed out that they didn't know anything about Gabriel, including whether he'd ever been arrested, if he did drugs, or whether he had any references.\n\n\nCarly turned to Gabriel and asked if he'd ever been arrested, and Gabriel told her he'd never been convicted of anything. She asked if he did drugs, and he replied, \"Not today.\" Carly then asked if he had any references, and Gabriel replied, \"Well, I was very popular in high school.\" Carly said that was good enough for her. Craig asked, \"But what if he's lying?\" Carly replied, \"Then he'll feel right at home here with you!\"\n\n\nCraig told Carly he was just trying to help her, and that everything he'd done with regard to Monte Carlo, he'd done for her. Carly responded that she wasn't sure about that, but she intended to find out, and she told Craig that she wanted to know everything about the financial situation, including where the money was coming from and where it was going. Craig told Carly that if she wanted Gabriel to stay, Gabriel could stay. Carly said that was good, but she still wanted to see the financials. Craig told Carly that if she wanted to be his partner, she needed to trust him. Carly said she wasn't sure she wanted to be his partner, and she certainly didn't trust him, but she had no other options at that point in her life.\n\n\nAt that moment, Parker and Liberty walked in. Parker explained that Liberty had wanted to get out of the house for a while, and Parker had thought Liberty might like to see Carly's new offices. Craig encouraged Carly to show Liberty around, and Parker said he would wait with Craig, since fashion wasn't really his area of interest. After Carly and Liberty left the office, Parker approached Gabriel and asked him, \"What the hell are you doing here?\"\n\n\nCraig told Parker that he shared Parker's sentiments, but that Carly had hired Gabriel, and he suggested that Parker ignore Gabriel. As Parker and Craig talked, Liberty and Carly returned, and Carly said she couldn't wait until Liberty was well enough to work for Monte Carlo as an assistant. Liberty warned Carly that wouldn't be possible for quite some time, because the doctors in Minnesota would want her to return to the hospital for treatment at some point. Parker suggested that wouldn't be necessary if he used his trust fund money to pay the doctors to travel to Oakdale instead of having Liberty travel to Minnesota.\n\n\nLiberty told Parker it would cost a fortune to bring the doctors to Oakdale, but Parker replied that he happened to have a fortune laying around. Craig told Parker that he should think carefully about what he was suggesting, because that wasn't what the trust was set up to accomplish. Craig asked Carly for her thoughts on the matter, and Carly said that it was Parker's money to do with as he wished. Liberty, however, struck down the idea and told Parker that he shouldn't have even said such a thing without finding out how she felt about it first.\n\n\nParker told Liberty that he knew she hated being in Minnesota, and Liberty agreed but said that her doctors wanted her to be there, and she wanted to continue her treatment there with them. Liberty was upset that Parker had assumed she would go along with his plan without even discussing it with her first, and she told him that she would go to Al's Diner to get a hamburger because she needed some time alone. Liberty said she would call Parker when she was finished eating, and she left.\n\n\nGabriel announced that he wanted to leave for an hour to have lunch. Craig told him to take a week if he needed it, but Gabriel replied that he only needed an hour, and then he walked out. Gabriel went to Old Town and saw Liberty, who looked like she was about to faint. He stopped and asked her if she were okay, and she answered that she was dizzy. Gabriel offered her an unopened bottle of water from his backpack, and she accepted it and took a drink. Liberty recognized Gabriel, and he introduced himself to her.\n\n\nLiberty asked whether Gabriel had been told to follow her, but he said if he'd been told to, he probably wouldn't have, and he explained that he was simply on his lunch break. Liberty offered to pay him for the bottle of water, but Gabriel told her not to worry about it. He said Liberty seemed different from the others, and when she asked what he meant, he said that the others acted as though people owed them something, but Liberty didn't act like that.\n\n\nLiberty told Gabriel about her upbringing and said that she and her mother had never had much money. When Liberty explained about how she'd met her father a couple of years before, Gabriel said that was great and asked where her father was. Liberty told him that Brad had been killed the previous year, right before Liberty became ill. Gabriel told her that he was sorry, because she'd obviously been through a lot.\n\n\nLiberty asked Gabriel how he'd gotten a job at Monte Carlo, and he explained about being hired by Carly, fired by Craig, rehired by Carly, refired by Craig, and rehired by Carly. Liberty laughed and said that sounded about right, and Gabriel remarked that Craig and Carly acted like an old married couple. Liberty told him that Craig and Carly had almost been married once, but then during Carly's extended absence, Craig had become involved with Carly's sister, who had once been married to Craig.\n\n\nGabriel shook his head and said that explained why Liberty's boyfriend was wound up so tight. Liberty told Gabriel that Parker wasn't exactly her boyfriend, although they had been married once and were still friends. Gabriel looked amused and said, \"I take it back. You fit right in!\"\n\n\nParker went to Old Town and saw Liberty and Gabriel. Parker walked up and asked what Liberty was doing. She answered that she was sitting on a bench, talking to Gabriel. Parker said he thought Liberty had wanted a hamburger; when she said she did, he told her, \"Let's go.\" Liberty told Parker, \"You're doing it again!\" and Gabriel said, \"I think she wants you to back off.\" Parker said no one had asked Gabriel what he thought, and he told Liberty that she shouldn't be associating with Gabriel. Gabriel stood up and asked if Parker had a problem with him, and Parker replied that he did and then suggested that Gabriel leave.\n\n\nGabriel told Parker that since Parker was neither a cop nor his boss, it didn't matter what Parker wanted him to do. Liberty asked the two boys to calm down, but Parker said they should leave because Liberty had been outside in the cold long enough. Gabriel pointed out that fresh air wouldn't make Liberty's cancer any worse. Liberty said she hadn't mentioned that she had cancer. Gabriel said he'd assumed she had cancer because of her hair loss and her dizziness. Parker, concerned, asked, \"You got dizzy?\" Liberty assured Parker that she was fine and then thanked Gabriel for the water. He replied, \"No problem,\" picked up his backpack, glared at Parker, and walked away.\n\n\nLiberty asked Parker, \"What's your problem with him?\" Parker said it was a long story and asked if Liberty still wanted a burger. Liberty said she was tired, so Parker suggested they go back to the house and eat there. Liberty said that sounded good, and they left.\n\n\nWhen Jack arrived at the hospital, Janet thanked him for showing up. The doctor walked out of Dusty's room and told Janet that it wasn't unusual for a trauma patient to wake up and fall asleep again the way Dusty had done. Janet asked if Dusty was awake, and the doctor said that although Dusty was awake, he might not be able to respond to Janet.\n\n\nRocco walked up, and Jack told Janet that he would go try to talk to Dusty. Janet said she'd be right behind him. Janet told her father that Dusty had regained consciousness. Rocco asked whether Dusty had said anything about what had happened to him yet. Janet said not yet but that Jack would ask Dusty some questions. Rocco told Janet that was a bad idea, given Dusty's injuries. Rocco said the most important thing was Dusty's recovery, not the need for revenge. Janet assured her father that Jack knew what he was doing and wouldn't put any undue strain on Dusty.\n\n\nJack asked Dusty if he remembered anything about the day he was shot, but Dusty said no. Jack described the events that he had seen on the surveillance camera at Metro. He told Dusty that a man had approached Dusty with a gun, and Dusty had tried to give the man his wallet, but the man hadn't taken it. Jack said it appeared that Dusty and the man talked for a minute, and then Dusty tried to knock the man out. However, none of that jogged Dusty's memory.\n\n\nJanet walked into the room and was thrilled to see that Dusty was awake and talking to Jack. Rocco asked whether Dusty had remembered anything, but Jack told him no. Janet asked Dusty how he felt, and when he replied that he was tired, Janet told him to close his eyes and get some rest. Jack wanted to ask Dusty a few more questions, but Janet insisted that it could wait, because Dusty's recovery was more important than catching whoever shot him.\n\n\nRocco stepped out into the hallway and called Ralph Manzo and told him that Dusty didn't remember anything. Rocco insisted that Ralph didn't need to do anything more to Dusty, and he promised to let Ralph know if the situation changed.\n\n\nJack decided to leave and let Dusty spend time with Janet. Jack went into the hallway and called Carly to update her on Dusty's condition. He told Carly that he wanted to gather some mug shots and take them back to the hospital for Dusty to look over, but Carly suggested that Jack give Janet and Dusty some time together. Jack said it was his job to solve the case, but Carly suggested that Jack was too close to the case and should let someone else at the station handle it. Jack asked if Carly was saying that he couldn't do his job, so Carly backed off and told Jack to do whatever he thought was best, and she hung up.\n\n\nDusty awoke and asked Janet if he was alive or dead. Janet assured him that he was alive, although she'd been very worried about him for a while. Dusty apologized for having worried her, but Janet told him she was just glad he was going to be okay. Dusty asked how Liberty was, and Janet gave him the good news about Liberty's treatments and her return to Oakdale. Dusty said, \"See, I told you so; everything's gonna be okay.\"\n\n\nDusty asked how the baby was, and Janet assured him that she and the baby were fine. Janet reminded Dusty that he'd promised her the rest of his life, and she planned to hold him to that. She leaned over and kissed him. They continued to talk, and Dusty asked Janet where she and Liberty had been staying. Janet told him they were at Carly's, but that everything was fine, because Carly was being as nice as possible about the whole situation.\n\n\nIn the hallway, Rocco approached Dusty's doctor and mentioned that Dusty seemed confused and unable to remember much. The doctor said initial memory loss was common after a major trauma. Rocco asked whether that meant Dusty might regain his memory of the events that had led to him being shot, and the doctor said it was possible but not definite. Rocco went into Dusty's room and asked Dusty how he was feeling. Dusty suddenly remembered the argument he'd had with Rocco, when Rocco had warned Dusty that Dusty would pay for threatening to talk to the police about Rocco's relationship with Ralph Manzo.\n\n\nCarly found herself unable to work, because she was completely distracted. Craig asked whether Carly wanted to have lunch, and she agreed but said, \"Let's go over the books first.\" Craig said he couldn't review the books at that moment because he had to meet Ellis for lunch. Carly reminded Craig that he had just invited her to lunch, and he slapped his forehead and told her he'd forgotten. Carly said she would join Craig and Ellis, and the three of them could discuss Monte Carlo's finances.\n\n\nA deliveryman walked in and asked for Carly. When Carly introduced herself, the man gave Carly an envelope. Carly opened it and found a note from Jack that read, \"Grown up enough for you?\" along with a hotel room key. Carly laughed and told Craig to enjoy his lunch, because she'd just gotten a much better offer.\n\n\nCarly went to the hotel and knocked on the door of the room Jack had rented, but no one answered. She used the room key to let herself into the room. She found the room full of flowers and candles, and then saw Jack, dressed in a suit and carrying a single red rose. Carly asked, \"What is all this?\" Jack smiled and said, \"What does it look like?\" She replied, \"A seduction,\" and Jack smiled again and answered, \"Exactly.\"\n\n\nJack said he wanted Carly to know that no matter what distractions they might have in their lives, they would always find time for just the two of them. Carly said she couldn't believe how romantic Jack was being, and he chuckled and said he had surprised himself. Jack told Carly that she was the most important thing in his life, and he wanted to keep reminding her of that, because she didn't deserve to be left for last. Carly said she didn't feel that way, and Jack said that was good, and that he would make sure she never did.\n\n\nJack apologized for the situation with Janet, but Carly told him she preferred being able to watch over Janet's interactions with Jack. Jack promised Carly that she had nothing to worry about in that regard. Carly told Jack that she thought what he was doing was amazing, and she said she would support him in whatever he needed to do. They kissed and fell onto the bed.\n\n\nGabriel got a cup of coffee and was leaving Java when he saw Ellis walking toward him. He deliberately bumped into Ellis and spilled coffee on Ellis' overcoat. As he apologized, Gabriel managed to pick Ellis's pocket, and he took Ellis' cell phone. Shortly thereafter, Craig tried to call Ellis, and Gabriel answered the phone. Craig, unaware he was talking to Gabriel, said he needed Ellis to cover for him, because he had told Carly that he and Ellis were having lunch together. Gabriel answered, \"Okay.\"\n\n\nCraig then said that they were in trouble, because Carly had insisted that she wanted to review the financial records, and if that happened, Carly would discover that Craig had been using Parker's trust fund to finance their business. Craig said he needed Ellis to \"cook up a clean set of books\" that Carly could review, even though Craig knew that was illegal, and Craig needed it done by the next day. Craig said that if Ellis could do that for him, there would be a big bonus in it for Ellis. Gabriel said, \"Sure,\" and Craig hung up, thinking he'd solved his problem.\n\n\n",
