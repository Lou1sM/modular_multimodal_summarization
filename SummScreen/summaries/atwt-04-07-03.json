Carly is there for her OB check up, and Mike, who is having his injured hand checked, spots her.  They duck into an empty room for a conversation but are unaware that Katie is also in the room.  \n\n\nCarly tells Mike that the hard feelings between him and Jack are becoming a real problem for her.  Mike asks to feel the baby kick, and just as he places his hand on Carly's stomach, Jack walks in and the usual argument ensues.\n\n\nIn the Woman's Reformatory,  Alison is having a wonderful dream about Aaron.  He is kissing her in the dream and stroking her cheek.  She suddenly wakes to find her two roommates tickling and teasing her with feathers.  They taunt her for calling out Aaron's name in her sleep.  \n\n\nHolden and Aaron meet, and Aaron tells him that Lucy is asking Craig if Aaron can attend the wedding of Craig and Rosanna.  Holden offers to ask Craig himself, but Aaron prefers to let Lucy handle it.  Holden warns Aaron about Craig.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Rosanna tells Lucy that Craig will not allow Aaron to come to the wedding but if Lucy insists on asking, to pick her moment carefully.  Craig walks in and Lucy makes her plea, but Craig refuses.  He becomes suspicious that Lucy has been seeing Aaron on the sly.  He asks Lucy about that point blank and also asks if someone has been helping her.  Rosanna keeps a low profile.  Lucy lies to her father about seeing Aaron, and Rosanna intervenes in her support.  She and Craig argue.  Rosanna tells Craig that Carly is out as the designer of Monte Carlo and Craig resists Barbara as her replacement.  The \"about-to-be-weds\" get into a screaming match.\n\n\nKatie surprises Mike in the hospital room after Carly and Jack leave for the appointment.  Mike realizes she has overheard the whole conversation and also that Katie has been crying.  Katie tells him that she cries five times a day for Simon, and Mike tries to comfort her.\n\n\nEmily finally corners Chris in the hospital and pleads with him to go visit Alison.  Chris resisits, but finally gives in and agrees to a visit.  He arrives at the jail at an opportune time for Alison; she is being tormented by her roommates again.  The matron gives Alison some advice: tell Chris to stay away or the cellmates from Hell will never let up on her.\n\n\nAt Emma's farm, Carly and Jack return from the check up.  Jack is still upset that Mike is still so much in the picture.  Carly asks him if he plans to \"move on\" if the baby turns out not to be his.  When Jack hesitates, she asks him to withdraw his divorce papers.  She tells him that she prays every night that the baby is his.  Jack tells Carly he is really angry with her. He does not know how he will feel once he holds the new baby.  Carly has a dizzy spell and Jack rushes to take her blood pressure.  It is normal.\n\n\nLucy meets with Aaron and they are both disappointed that Craig will not allow Aaron to attend the wedding.  Lucy suggests that Aaron show up anyway.  \n\n\nAlison asks Chris to tell Emily she is fine, and Chris gives her a big hug and reminds her that a lot of people lover her.  When she returns to her cell, she pulls up the mattress on her bunk in order to hide some of her private items.  Hidden there already is a knife!\n\n\nCraig wants harmony restored in his household, but Rosanna insists that he at least look at Barbara Ryan's designs for Monte Carlo.  He agrees reluctantly.\n\n\n",

The guard advised Alison to tell Dr. Chris to stay away, to avoid envy. Ali begged Chris to tell Em that she's okay & to never come back. Carly ran into Mike at the hospital while she was on her way to her prenatal appt. Mike requested that they go into another room so that they could talk. Jack came into the room & witnessed Mike's hand on Carly's belly. Jack & Carly got into an argument at the farm & Jack to check Carly's pressure to make sure she was okay. Lucy & Aaron are trying to figure out a way for him to be a guest at her daddy's wedding. Rosanna is trying to convince Craig to put him on the list.
