Katie thinks it would be fun to go, if for no other reason than to find out who wrote the book, but Mike tries to talk her out of it. They play a \"game\" that involves losing various pieces of clothing, but they're interrupted by Nancy Hughes ringing the doorbell. Nancy gives Katie a wrapped copy of \"Oakdale Confidential\" as a \"welcome home\" gift for her and Mike, and Mike tells Katie to tell Nancy their good news: they're getting married in June. Nancy congratulates them and leaves, with Katie telling her she'll see her at Lucinda's party. Katie goes upstairs to get ready for the party, and Mike takes a look at the book; he doesn't like what he sees, and when Katie comes back downstairs, he tells her the book is all about her and him and Carly and Maddie and that he never gave anyone permission to write about his life.

Jade returns to Cal's house while Lily, Luke, and Holden go inside to get settled and eat; however, Jade sends a text message to Luke saying she needs to see him right now, and he manages to sneak out and go down to Cal's. There, Jade stresses that they need to make it look like he is trying to sneak off and be with her whenever they can, to reinforce the idea that they're in love; Luke agrees to this but says that as soon as he knows he's strong enough, he's going to tell his parents that he's gay, and that will end this charade they're playing. He goes back to the house, and Holden sees him coming back inside. He guesses where Luke's been and asks him to please try to obey his mom's rules about Jade. \n\n\nHolden then excuses himself, and he leaves to go talk to Jade; he knocks on the door and calls her name, and Jade opens the door, scantily dressed in panties and a camisole. Holden asks her to please put on a robe, which she does, then he tells her he's concerned about the stress her relationship with Luke might put on Luke. Jade asks him whether it worked when he and Lily were young and people tried to keep them apart, and he admits it didn't, but he tells her his priority right now is Luke's health. She agrees with him, but then she suggests that he not mention their conversation to Lily.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Lily and Luke have a mother-son talk about Jade. Lucinda calls Lily and asks if she's coming to her book party tonight, but Lily says they just got home from the hospital with Luke, so she'll have to skip it.
