She was exhausted from the surgery to remove her tumor and was shocked to find Paul there, since she hadn't told him about the operation. She learned from Paul that Sofie had told him. A little while later, Sofie arrived to check up on Barbara, but before she could go in to see her, Aaron found her and asked if she had forgotten about their breakfast. Sofie apologized for missing their date and Aaron said he understood that she was concerned for Barbara. He offered to wait for Sofie while she visited with Barbara. As Sofie entered the room and asked how Barbara was, she was greeted by Barbara's frustration. Barbara reminded Sofie that she asked her not to tell her children about the operation, but before Barbara could go on, Paul jumped to Sofie's defense, telling his mother that Sofie hadn't interrupted Will and Gwen's going away party and only told Paul because she thought Barbara shouldn't be alone. Paul convinced Barbara that Sofie had done the right thing and Sofie left for breakfast with Aaron, leaving mother and son alone so Barbara could rest. \n\n\nMike arrived at the Snyder farm in search of Emma, but Meg greeted him and said that Emma had gone to visit Iva and would be gone for a few days. He asked Meg if she would help him learn more about the farm and she agreed to answer any questions she could. Since it was still early and neither had eaten, Mike offered to cook them both breakfast. As the two ate, Mike told Meg about his travels in Europe and the two enjoyed reminiscing. As Meg washed the dishes, Mike quizzed her about the farm's infrastructure, but Meg proved to know little about the farm. Mike asked if he could just leave some papers with Meg for Paul to sign and she explained that she was no longer with Paul romantically and had no plans to see him soon. Mike asked Meg what had gone wrong between her and Paul and she told him the story of their turbulent romance and finally detailed her accidental miscarriage at Paul's hands. Mike asked if Meg still blamed Paul and she admitted that they had both behaved badly and that she was hopeful Paul could change. After listening to Meg, Mike confessed that part of the reason he had returned to Oakdale was for Katie. He said that he had tried to just walk away from Katie, but believed he owed her an apology for leaving without more of an explanation. As Mike thanked Meg for listening, she reached across the table and held his hand. At that moment, Paul walked in and saw the two together. \n\n\nPaul asked Meg and Mike if he was \"interrupting something,\" but Mike explained they were just catching up. He thanked Meg for her help and gave the papers to Paul and left. Meg noticed Paul was upset and asked him what was wrong. Paul told Meg that Barbara had just gone through emergency surgery and Meg immediately hugged and comforted him. Meg offered to help with Barbara, but Paul's only request was for Meg to share a lunch with him and talk. Meg agreed to meet him at the Lakeview after she ran some errands and Paul left, happy that Meg had decided to see him later. \n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Sofie and Aaron finally sat down together for their date. Sofie told Aaron that she would be visiting Barbara again after lunch and Aaron was concerned that Paul would be there. Sofie wondered why Aaron was worried and he admitted that he had heard the two were spending a lot of time together. Sofie told Aaron that Paul was her friend and he had helped her when she was trying to get Hallie back. \n\n\nAfter lunch with Aaron, Sofie returned to visit with Barbara. Moments later, Aaron arrived with a huge bouquet and offered his family's prayers for Barbara's recovery. Sofie was taken aback that Aaron would go out of his way to check up on Barbara. The two stayed with Barbara until she drifted off, but as they tried to leave quietly, Sofie's bracelet slipped off and woke Barbara up when it hit the ground. She asked Sofie to stay with her and she agreed, while Aaron left for his day. As Sofie returned to her bedside, Barbara commented on the beautiful bracelet Sofie had made and offered to help her professionally. Sofie was pleased that Barbara had offered to work with her once she was well. \n\n\nKatie prepared for a day of work at the television station and was surprised that she was constantly being congratulated on her engagement to Brad. She was amazed that so many people on the crew knew of her impending marriage because she had yet to tell anyone about her decision to marry Brad. When Brad arrived for work, Katie immediately pulled him into their office and asked him why he had told everyone. Katie told Brad that she assumed they would keep their engagement quiet until they made a formal announcement and she thought everything was moving quickly. Brad admitted he was excited at the prospect of Katie being his wife and began telling people as soon as she said yes. He attempted to calm his fianc\u00e9e down and sent her back to the make-up chair to prepare for their day in front of the camera. \n\n\nOnce Katie and Brad began to film their show, Brad repeatedly turned the focus of the episode back to love. He eventually announced, on live television, that he and Katie were engaged. The two finished filming the rest of the show and when the lights went down, Katie told Brad that she wanted to keep everything private and was annoyed with him for announcing their plans. Brad reminded her they were local celebrities and he only made the announcement after Kim encouraged him to do so. Alone in their office, Brad asked Katie if she really wanted to marry him. When he kept pushing for an answer, Katie told him she didn't want to go through with the marriage and stormed out of the room. \n\n\nBrad followed Katie to her hotel room and begged her to let him in. She only relented when he began yelling in the hall. Once inside, he asked her why she had decided not to marry him. Katie said she had just changed her mind, but Brad argued that he had put up with a lot from her because he hoped she would love him someday and that she shouldn't stomp all over his heart in such a callous way. A frustrated Brad walked out and after thinking about what he had said, Katie rushed into the hall after him, but Brad had left. She went back to her room and asked herself why she had hurt him, but believed he was better off without her. \n\n\nTom and Margo enjoyed a weekday morning at home together and Margo commented about how long it had been since the two had enjoyed a quiet day with one another. Tom decided to take advantage of their time alone and gave his wife a much-needed message. He sensed his wife was tense about something and she told him that Katie was thinking about marrying Brad and she thought it was a rebound from Katie's failed relationship with Jack. Tom reminded Margo that Katie was an adult and needed to make her own decisions. He told Margo that the only couple she needed to be concerned about was the two of them and then he led his wife upstairs for more alone time. When Margo came back downstairs, she was greeted with the news that Katie had accepted Brad's proposal and let out a panicked cry that brought Tom into the room. She explained that she had just learned about her sister's big news and needed to find out what was going on. Tom tried to convince Margo that Katie needed to learn from her own mistakes, but Margo was determined not to watch Katie make another marriage blunder. After some persuading, Margo agreed to stay with Tom and think about Katie another day, but as soon as Tom was back upstairs Margo left to find her sister. \n\n\nBrad took his rejection and went to the Lakeview bar. As he vented his frustration to the bartender, he realized that he would always love Katie and took a bottle of champagne upstairs to Katie's room to try to convince her to take him back. Just as he walked out, Mike, Katie's ex-husband, came in and sat at the bar. \n\n\nMeg found Paul waiting for her at the Lakeview and as the two were talking, Mike saw them and asked Paul if he had a chance to go over the papers he had left. Paul seemed annoyed that Mike was interrupting him and Meg and when Mike sensed something was wrong he excused himself. Paul realized Meg was watching Mike and asked him to join them for drink. In the bar, the three enjoyed an awkward drink, but Mike realized Paul wanted to be alone with Meg and excused himself. Once they were by themselves, Meg thanked Paul for trying to be a nice guy and complemented him on his ability to change. She leaned over and gave Paul an unexpected kiss. \n\n\nUp in his room, Mike ordered room service and prepared to work the night away. Unable to focus on work, he decided to get a bite to eat down in the hotel restaurant. \n\n\nAlone in her suite, Katie continued her talk with herself and realized how great Brad was and how much he loved her. As she got ready to go and find him, she was happily surprised to find Brad had returned to her door. Katie and Brad both apologized and admitted they were scared of what the future would hold for them. Brad asked Katie to marry him again and she agreed. She told him she was only worried about the pressure of setting up the wedding and wanted to marry him quickly. Brad suggested the two elope and Katie agreed. They packed for a quickie wedding in Vegas and as they prepared to leave the hotel lobby, Margo stopped them and demanded to know where they were going. Katie told Margo about her plans with Brad and Margo demanded that Katie talk to her before going anywhere. Katie reassured Brad that Margo couldn't change her mind and kissed him, just as Mike stepped off the elevator. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is upset that Brad announced their engagement to the television audience and later Brad and Katie argue and she considers calling off the wedding but later changers her mind and Brad and Katie decide to elope. Margo feels she must go talk to Katie one she learns about her engagement on the news so she cuts a romantic day with Tom short and arrives just before the happy couple is about to leave the Lakeview. Katie gives Brad a kiss and tells him she will leave after she talks to Margo. Mike steps off the elevator and is shocked to see Katie kissing Brad. Mike and Meg get to know each other as they talk about their failed relationships. Paul is jealous to see Meg with Mike but doesn't show it and continues to show his nice guy side to Meg which also brings them closer. Barbara is touched that Sofie is so concerned about her and when she sees a bracelet Sofie made she offers to help her sell her pretty bracelets. Aaron is jealous of Sofie's relationship with Paul but she tells him Paul is just a good friend.",
