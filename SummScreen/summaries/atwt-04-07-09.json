Luke was attempting to transfer some money from the foundation's savings fund to the checking fund in order to pay some bills. Suddenly the system shut Luke out of all the fund's accounts. Noah tried to gain access, but he got the same results. \n\n\nLily dropped off Lucinda at Memorial for a radiation treatment. Her cell phone rang, and it was Luke telling her about the mishap with the foundation's accounts. He told her the bank was working on the problem, but it was Luke's theory that Damian was pulling some funny business in order to break into the accounts. He was convinced his father had come back to destroy the foundation that was fighting for gay rights. Lily asked Luke if his bodyguard was still on duty, and Luke verified that. Lily promised to go see Damian, so she stopped by his hospital room but found it empty. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul cuddled baby Eliza as Lucy walked in. Paul was not overjoyed to see her, but he was pleased to tell her that he had been granted custody of his daughter. He thanked Lucy for her help, but she was confused, until Paul said if she had not gotten Dusty so riled up, he never would have gone to the farm and used Paul's face as a punching bag. Paul said that once Dusty had beaten the crap out of him, he was able to assert that Meg was exposing their child to danger. Lucy was shocked and then relieved when Paul said he would give her a break and not squeal to Craig. He could afford to be generous since he had his daughter back. \n\n\nMeg and Holden cleaned away residue from the fire in the farm's kitchen. Meg cried that she missed her baby, and left messages for her lawyer that he did not return. She was also concerned about the babysitter who had apparently disappeared and was not answering her phone, either. Holden went outside and headed off Dusty who was about to knock. He told Dusty that Meg did not want to see him and refused to let him in. Dusty said he wanted to help get Eliza back, and he promised to turn things around. Holden warned him off and went back inside. \n\n\nMeg continued to cry because her lawyer had called and said that he thought she would lose permanent custody of the baby. Holden tried to reassure his sister, but Meg was feeling lonely and desperate. She said she was stupid for trusting Paul. Holden offered to have her come back to his house, but she said she needed to wait for more information from the lawyer. Holden hugged her and left. \n\n\nMeg began folding baby laundry and became sad again. She grabbed her coat and ran outside, where Dusty intercepted her. He asked her not to walk away but to give him a minute. He offered to help, but Meg broke away and said only she could put it right. \n\n\nLily called Luke and said Damian had checked out of the hospital against his doctor's orders. Luke said he was sure Damian was the one who had sabotaged the bank accounts. Lily promised to track Damian down, but Luke favored calling the police. Lily reminded him that they had no evidence, but she was sure she could find Damian. After all, he could not get too far with a serious knife wound. \n\n\nZac and Zoe, the oddball twins, joined Luke and Noah at the diner. They wanted to know what they could do for the foundation, and Luke explained that someone was hacking into the accounts. He said they were in need of a cyber-geek. Luke left to check on his mom, while Noah stayed to work on the computer. Zac and Zoe, who referred to each other as \"Z\" offered to stay and help. \n\n\nLily spied Damian in the lobby of the Lakeview, and he said he was bored, so he left the hospital. Lily made him sit down and rest, and then she told him about the problem with the bank accounts. Damian strongly protested any involvement in the strange goings-on, and he swore he would never do something like that to his \"Luciano.\" Lily suggested he start being honest with her, but Damian yelled at her that he had been straightforward with them all, and he walked out. He staggered, and Lily helped him and discovered that his wound was bleeding badly. Damian refused to go back to Memorial, so Lily insisted on taking him to his room at the hotel. \n\n\nNoah continued to work on the computer, and he finally discovered some transactions done by an unknown person. Zac said he was a geek, and took over from Noah. Zac somehow created a \"fatal error\" on the computer that lost all of Noah's work, including the name of the unknown hacker. Noah took back the laptop and tried to remember the screen name. He thought it was PESC1, plus more numbers, but it was not enough to retrieve any information. \n\n\nLily accompanied Damian to his room and helped him take off his shirt. She was shocked to see so much blood, so she went into the bathroom to get some towels. Damian would not agree to see a doctor, so all Lily could do was apply pressure with the towels. Suddenly Luke came through the door and was very disturbed to see Lily with her hands on Damian's bare back. He asked what the hell she was doing, so Lily explained about applying pressure. Luke was convinced there was something else going on, and he shouted at his mother that she didn't owe Damian a damn thing. Luke lost it and ran from the room, and Lily followed. \n\n\nMeg arrived at Fairwinds and discovered Paul in the living room, holding Eliza. He reminded her that child protective services had decided that the baby was safer with him, so Meg had no business there. She denied again that she had left their daughter alone in the house, and accused Paul of setting up the whole scene. She went further by saying she wished they could figure out a way for both of them to raise Eliza. She offered to come back to Fairwinds so that the three of them could be a family again. \n\n\nPaul put Eliza to sleep in her new nursery and then returned to Meg. He accused her of lying about her offer to come back, because she didn't love him. Meg claimed she had never stopped loving him. \n\n\nPaul asked Meg if she was willing to give up Dusty, and she agreed. He also asked if she would stay faithful to only him and be his wife again, and once more she agreed. Paul asked her to prove it, so Meg removed her dress, and she was wearing nothing underneath. Paul asked her to go further, but she asked him not to humiliate her. Paul nastily told her to save it for Dusty, and said to put her clothes on and get out. Meg grabbed her dress and covered herself. \n\n\nNoah could make no headway with the computer, and Zoe and Zac got into a name calling fight. Zoe stormed out, as Zac explained that they were both spontaneous people. Noah just called them insane. Zac began coming on strongly to Noah until he finally grabbed Noah and kissed him on the mouth. Noah was shocked, and a laughing Zac inquired if it was as good for Noah as it was for \"Z.\" \n\n\nDusty approached Lucy at Memorial and wanted to talk. He asked if she knew that Paul had custody of the baby, and Lucy said she had discovered that when she went to see him. Dusty asked her to talk to Meg, the social worker, and child protective services and tell the truth about Paul's blackmail scheme. Lucy said it would ruin her humanitarian efforts for the people who had kept her and Johnny safe in Africa. Dusty said Lucy should be prepared to tell the truth in 24 hours. \n\n\nLily went home and found Holden discouraged about Meg's situation with the baby. He noticed that Lily was upset, so she told him about the trouble Luke had with the financial accounts. She also described what had occurred in Damian's room and how Luke had misunderstood what he had seen. Holden was angry that Lily had taken on the responsibility of Damian in spite of his request that she stay away from her ex-husband. They talked it out and began hugging. \n\n\nZac continued to tease Noah about the kiss, as Luke walked in. Noah had a dazed look on his face, and Luke wanted to know what was going on. Zac talked about the computer malfunction, and then Zoe came back, and the twins hugged and kissed each other. They left, and Noah blurted out that Zac had kissed him. Luke said he had recognized that Zac had a \"thing\" for Noah, but Noah called the incident \"no big deal.\" \n\n\nNoah and Luke went outside and sat on a bench. Luke described what he had seen in his father's hotel room, but Noah looked on it as strictly a medical emergency. He was more worried that his computer was totally trashed. Luke could not stop thinking that Damian was trying to lure Lily back into his clutches so that she would be distracted and would not realize Damian was stealing back the Grimaldi money. \n\n\nIn the Lakeview Lounge, Zac and Zoe saw a woman deliver a message to Damian. As Damian read the note, the twins approached and called him a \"bad monster.\" Zac explained that \"bad\" meant \"good,\" and then the two left, laughing. \n\n\nLucy talked to someone on the phone and said she was going to have to find a way to deal with Dusty, otherwise their \"whole operation would fall apart.\" \n\n\nDusty went to his room and flashed back on a happy time when Meg was holding Eliza. Meanwhile, at Fairwinds, Meg finished dressing as Paul brought the baby in. He told her to leave because he no longer wanted her back. He let Meg hold the baby briefly and told her she wouldn't be seeing Eliza for a while. Paul took the baby back, and Meg ran out.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Luke confides to Noah that he can't access some of his accounts to the foundation and he suspects Damian. He knows he would not want his money used for gay rights. All these weird things started happening when Damian came to Oakdale. When he tells Lily, she says she will find Damian and figure this out. Zac and Zoe show up and want to help. Luke takes off so Lily won't have to meet Damian alone. While Zac is helping Noah with the laptop, he leans over and kisses Noah on the mouth, then laughs when he asks was it as good for him as it was for Zac? Holden and Meg clean up the farm kitchen and are just grateful that Eliza wasn't hurt. They will get her back from Paul. Holden tries to shield Meg from seeing Dusty but Dusty waits until she is alone. She shakes him off and doesn't want his help. Lucy visits Paul and he gloats that he has his daughter back thanks to her. She played right into Dusty's hands. Lily finds Damian and ends up taking him to his room when he starts bleeding badly. He's tired of her accusations and claims to have nothing to do with Luke's current frustrations. She takes off his shirt and starts to change the bandage when Luke barges in. He storms back out as he thinks Damian is taking advantage of his mother's goodness. Meg pays Paul a visit and announces she is willing to work with him so they both can raise their daughter. She admits she will come back to him, be his wife, the family that he always wanted. He doesn't believe her so she has to beg for that chance. Having to prove it, she removes her clothes. Then he humiliates her by telling her to put them back on. He knows what he wants and it isn't her. Once he would have taken her back in a heartbeat, but not now. She runs out after holding her baby one last time. Dusty warns Lucy to tell the truth to Meg and the social worker or he will. When Holden finds out about Damian and Lily helping him, he chastises her for always being there and now with her hands all over Damian. No wonder Luke is so frustrated with her. Zac taunts Noah about the kiss being better than Luke's. Noah does tell Luke but wants him to forget it as the guy is a flake. He warns Luke not to worry about Damian either as it is all probably pure innocence on Lily's part. Luke is not worried about his mother, just Damian's intentions. Zac and Zoe laugh when they tell Damian that he is a bad monster.",
