    "soap_central": "\n\n \nA discouraged Vienna dropped in on Katie, and she complained that Henry had changed so much since her return that she questioned whether he still loved her.  Vienna confided that \"the fire was gone\" from their relationship, and she asked her good friend, Katie, for advice.  Katie said that Vienna just needed to ask Henry what was going on, but Vienna said she already had.\n\n\nVienna was distraught that when she and Henry went to bed, he just slept, so she reasoned that he was tired of her.  She also worried that Henry had met someone while Vienna was gone, but Katie told her not to blame herself.  Vienna begged Katie to find out the truth, and offered to stay with baby Jacob until his sitter arrived so that Katie could get on the case right away.\n\n\nHenry visited Barbara, and it was difficult for him to reject her advances.  He told her that they could not be together anymore because Vienna's return had changed everything.  Besides that, said Henry, Katie was on to them.  Barbara laughed that Katie's knowing made no difference because it was time to take their relationship public.  Henry said he owed it to Vienna to try to work things out because he had broken her heart.  Barbara asked Henry if he was still in love with Vienna, but he said Barbara wasn't listening to him.\n\n\nBarbara was afraid that Henry was too embarrassed to be seen with a much older woman, but he denied it.  Then Barbara said there was no reason not to go public, as someone knocked on the door.  Henry asked Barbara not to answer it, but she opened the door anyway, and there stood Katie.  Katie told Henry she was afraid she would find him there, but Barbara interrupted by saying that Henry had something he wanted to say to Katie.  Henry just looked at Katie, as Barbara prompted him.\n\n\nWhen Henry stayed silent, Kate said that she had something she wanted to say, as well, but in private.  When Henry agreed to go with her, a hurt Barbara declared that she had her answer, and she warned Henry not to return again.  Barbara slammed the door after Katie and Henry walked out.  Katie asked Henry \"what the hell\" he was doing, and then she said she knew all his lame excuses.  She advised him to walk away from whatever Barbara had lured him into.\n\n\nHenry and Katie sat in the Lakeview lounge, and she told him that Vienna was devastated because it appeared that Henry had lost all interest in her.  She yelled at Henry to \"get a grip\" and to start thinking rationally.  Henry couldn't say if he had fallen out of love with Vienna, but he admitted that his feelings had definitely changed.  Katie lectured him that Vienna confessed that it was wrong of her to leave Henry, and she knew that she could not live without him.  Katie warned Henry to \"do the right thing\" and leave Barbara and go back to Vienna where he belonged.\n\n\nHenry reminded Katie that Vienna had returned to Henry because he had donated a bucket of money to the new hospital wing, and Katie had pushed him into it.  He was afraid that Vienna needed more of Henry than it was possible for him to give, so he kept letting her down.  Henry said that with Barbara, there were no expectations, and he could be whoever he was.  Katie called Barbara some nasty adjectives, and then she stood up and told Henry that it was up to him.  She walked out, and in the lobby, Katie called Vienna and said that Henry was having a hard time living up to Vienna's standards.  Vienna thanked her as Katie signed off, saying that Vienna needed to take it from there.\n\n\nBarbara heard another knock on her door, so she opened it, suspecting that Henry had decided he could not live without her.  Instead Katie stood there.  She said that Henry would not be returning because she had convinced him that he had been acting like a fool for thinking that his...Here Katie paused to find the right words, so Barbara interjected \"love affair?\" Katie found her words and said Henry' s \"descent into madness\" was laughable.  Barbara commented that Henry had realized he needed more than a superficial girl with a funny accent, as the two of them continued to spar.\n\n\nFinally Barbara announced that she made Henry happy, and besides that, she would not walk out on him as Vienna had.  Katie said she was making Henry her business as of that moment, and Barbara realized that Katie had just declared war.  Katie remarked that trouble followed Barbara around like \"a heat-seeking missile,\" so Barbara lashed out about how miserable Katie's life was.  Katie asked if Barbara and Henry loved one another, and Barbara laughed and said no.  She claimed love was not a complication that either of them wanted in their lives.  Katie offered that as proof that Barbara really didn't know Henry very well if she thought Henry did not want to be loved.  She urged Barbara to walk away.\n\n\nHenry went back to Vienna's room and said he was sorry he had driven her away.  Vienna interrupted him and said she didn't want to hear any \"history\" from him; she only wanted to think about the future.  Vienna said she loved him and had decided that she wanted to marry him.  She was sure of that, and Vienna got down on one knee and proposed to Henry.\n\n\nIn Java, Luke recognized Mr. Judd, the Texan who was suing Dr. Oliver, so he sat and asked to speak with him.  Judd was not receptive, but Luke went ahead and offered him a great deal of money to avoid the pain and suffering of a protracted lawsuit.  Luke said he knew money could not bring back the man's daughter, but it could save the family the agony of a trial.  Reid Oliver walked up and asked what was going on, and the man called Oliver \"pathetic\" and accused Oliver of sending his \"boyfriend\" to buy Mr. Judd off.  Oliver asked what Mr. Judd was talking about, as Luke jumped up and tried to smooth things over.\n\n\nThe outraged father told Oliver he would see the doctor in court, and he stomped out.  The doctor's pager beeped, so he had to rush back to the hospital.  Luke found Mr. Judd outside, and he explained that he was not Dr. Oliver's boyfriend, and that the doctor had no idea that Luke had made the offer.  He explained that he was just trying to save the career of a talented surgeon.\n\n\nLuke found Reid in his office, and handed Reid his favorite coffee drink from Java.  He also apologized to the doctor for butting into his business, but Reid said he was \"impressed\" with Luke and thanked him for trying to ameliorate the situation with Mr. Judd.  Luke said he had gone to talk to Judd not for Dr. Oliver but for Noah.  He was afraid that if Oliver were tied up in a worrisome lawsuit that Noah's surgery might be delayed.\n\n\nOliver went in to see Dusty and found Janet and her father in the room.  Janet was concerned that Dusty appeared very weak, but the doctor was not concerned.  Rocco Ciccone asked if Dusty would ever remember who shot him, but Dr. Oliver could not give him an answer.  Dusty opened his eyes, and Janet welcomed him back.  Dusty looked at Rocco and flashed back to the day the two of them had a confrontation in front of the new house Dusty was buying.  He remembered Rocco's threat, but just then Jack entered the room and asked if Dusty was up for some talking.  Rocco tried to get Jack to back off, but Dusty said that everything was \"still a blur.\"\n\n\nJack watched Rocco try to get Janet to intervene in the questioning, and Dusty asked for some bottled water.  The others left the room, and Janet headed for the cafeteria.  Jack stopped Rocco from going with her by saying that he had a couple of questions for him.  Jack asked if Rocco actually knew what had happened to Dusty, but Rocco said he knew the same as Jack: somebody had attacked and shot Dusty.  Rocco got defensive and asked if Jack was accusing him of something, but Jack said he was only asking a few questions.  He explained that Dusty's assailant had quite a conversation with Dusty before he fired the shots, and Jack thought perhaps the man was conveying a message from someone else.\n\n\nThen Jack brought up Ralph Manzo, and that got an angry reaction from Rocco.  Janet returned and was surprised to see her father so upset.  Jack took a call and walked away as Janet demanded to know why her ex had been upsetting her father.  Rocco said that Jack was trying to link Ralph to Dusty's shooting, but he swore to Janet that was not true.  Janet, however, reminded her dad that Dusty had helped put Ralph in prison, so Jack's premise was not totally out of line.\n\n\nWhen Jack returned, Janet asked Jack why he was accusing her father, and the two of them argued.  She asked him to lighten up on Rocco, who was just trying to make amends to her and Liberty for being absent so much of their lives.  Jack, however, said that his instincts told him something about Rocco was \"off,\" but Janet said he was wrong.\n\n\nDr. Oliver passed them in the hall on his way back to Dusty's room, where he referred to himself as \"the guy who saved your life.\"  He asked Dusty what he remembered, but Dusty's answer was \"bits and pieces.\"  Reid took a good look at Dusty and then said that he knew that Dusty was \"exaggerating\" his memory loss.  He asked why, and Dusty replied, \"Because Janet's life depends on it.\"\n\n\nJack went into Dusty's room and caught the tail end of the conversation between Dusty and Dr. Oliver.  After the doctor left, Jack asked Dusty if he knew more than he was letting on about the shooting.  Dusty didn't fool Jack, who said Dusty had to give him something to go on.  He promised to protect Janet, but he raised his voice, and Janet heard him and ran in.  Jack said they were done for the moment, and he walked out.  Dusty promised Janet they were all going to be okay, as Jack watched from outside.\n\n\nLater, Dr. Oliver told Janet and Rocco that Dusty was in no danger physically, but mentally he was \"a little cloudy.\"  He also suggested that the family give him room and not push him.  After the doctor left, Rocco told Janet that they had a lot of time to make up for, and he said he wanted to go visit Liberty.  On his way out, however, Rocco used a pay phone at the hospital and made a call to Ralph Manzo.  He gave Ralph an update on Dusty and said that Donovan didn't remember a thing.\n\n\n",
