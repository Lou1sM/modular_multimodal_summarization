Jessica is summoned to the City Times office by Lucinda and Kim, who urge Jessica to call a press conference in response, but Evelyn disagrees. At Java, Ben shares his anger at this situation with Isaac. It has to stop now! Bonnie sees the picture and runs to her mother's side. Bonnie adds her opinion as to what Jessica should do and Jessica unleashes her fury and frustration. Later, Jessica tells Bonnie she knows about the letter. She doesn't fault anyone for having doubts and that she fears Ben is losing faith, as is she. She will make the decision of whether or not she will hold a press conference but if she does, she doesn't want Bonnie there because of her link to the videotape, or Ben because he'd only be coming out of obligation. She is adamant, although privately she wishes Ben would be there. Bonnie and Ben argue. Bonnie declares that if he loves Jessica, he'll be by her side at the press conference. Ben, thinking Jessica is about to self-destruct, leaves on a mission to do something about it. Alison reels over finding the knife under her bed.

They realize that Carly is devastated by this encounter and decide to help Craig.  \n\n\n",
