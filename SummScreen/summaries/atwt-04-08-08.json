Emily walked up and told Alison that Chris was going to hurt her again, but Alison told Emily to mind her own business. Alison assured Emily that she and Chris were just friends and then returned to her coffee with Chris. Alison apologized that Emily was trying to make things difficult for them, and Chris said Emily wanted to make things difficult for him. When Alison asked what he meant, Chris told her about Emily having drugged him, which had almost gotten him fired. \n\n\nEmily went to find her mother at the hospital and told Susan that Alison was still seeing Chris Hughes. Susan said Alison was stubborn like Emily, but Emily told Susan she hadn't been a strong enough mother to Alison. Emily got a call from Alison, who said she wanted to talk to her back at Java. Emily went to Java and told Alison she just didn't want her to get her heart broken again, because Chris was bad news. \n\n\nAlison told Emily she knew that Emily had drugged Chris. Emily told Alison she hadn't known Chris would go back to the hospital that day, but Alison told her to stop trying to justify herself. Emily then warned Alison that if Chris ever found out about her past making pornographic movies, he would dump Alison the way he had dumped Emily when he found out she'd worked as a prostitute. Emily told Alison that for the Hughes men, women were always second rate. Alison told Emily not to worry about her, and she left. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Susan found Chris and told him to leave her daughters alone. Chris told Susan he and Alison were just friends, but Susan thought there was more to it than that and asked whether Alison knew Chris was also involved with Sofie Duran. Chris walked away after telling Susan that from now on, they needed to keep their conversations strictly professional and that Susan should stay out of his personal life. \n\n\nAlison went to the hospital and found Chris. She told him that Emily said Chris had dumped her because she'd been a prostitute; Chris said it was actually because she'd lied about that and about having slept with Dusty. Alison said either way, there were things he should know about her before their friendship/relationship went any further. Alison handed Chris a copy of one of the pornographic movies she had made. Chris asked why she'd made the movie, and Alison told him about her crystal meth addiction and how Emily and Dusty had saved her by getting her out of the movies and off of the drugs. \n\n\nChris asked if they could get together the next night. Alison was surprised he still wanted to hang out with her, but Chris said she had been upfront with him, and he had known her for a long time and almost married her once; he said he'd like to get to know her all over again, and that everyone had done things that they regretted. Alison left and went to see Emily at her office. She told Emily what had happened with Chris, and Emily was shocked to hear that Chris didn't care about Alison's past. She asked, \"How did you get a free pass, and I got dumped?\" Alison said she didn't know and didn't care, but Emily needed to stay out of her life. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Mike Kasnoff narrowly missed seeing Katie, who was with Brad and Margo. Margo insisted to Katie and Brad that their wedding was not going to happen. After Brad told Margo it was none of her business, he left her alone with Katie, who told Margo to back off. Margo told Katie she couldn't give her blessing to the marriage plans because she believed Katie was settling for Brad. Margo wished Katie luck and left; Katie told Brad she was ready to go get married. \n\n\nCarly received a call for Jack from Dallas Griffin, who wanted Jack's help on a case. Carly put Dallas off, telling him it wasn't a good time for Jack to work, since he was still recuperating. However, when Jack came in and asked her who had been on the phone, Carly was honest with him. Jack thanked her for telling him the truth, and then he called Dallas back and agreed to meet him at the police station to help him on his case. Jack told Carly he could drive himself and that they could both use a little space, but he assured her he would be coming back. \n\n\nAs soon as Jack left, Carly's doorbell rang, and she opened the door to find Mike Kasnoff standing there. As they caught up with each other, Mike told Carly about his business deal with Paul to develop the acreage at the Snyder farm that Emma was selling. When Carly recovered from the shock of this news, she asked if that meant Mike would be staying in Oakdale. He said that all depended on Katie. \n\n\nCarly realized Mike didn't know anything about Katie's recent doings, so she filled him in on Katie's TV show with Brad and on Katie's relationships with Jack and Brad. Mike was surprised to hear about Katie's marriage to Jack and her involvement with Brad; Carly said it appeared that Katie had a thing for all of Carly's exes. Carly then said that Brad seemed serious about settling down, so if Mike was interested in throwing his hat into the ring with Katie, he'd better do it right away. Mike asked Carly not to say anything about him being back in town until he had a chance to figure out his next move. \n\n\nMargo went to the police station, where she saw Jack and told him she was upset about Katie and Brad. She told Jack that Brad and Katie were eloping, and she blamed Jack because he hadn't made things work with Katie. Margo asked Jack to call Katie and try to talk some sense into her, but Jack said it wasn't his place. \n\n\nBrad and Katie got to the airport only to find out their flight to Las Vegas had already departed. Brad got tickets for them on the next flight out, but Katie was worried she would spend the two hours hearing Margo's voice in her head. Katie told Brad that it all felt wrong, and Brad asked if Katie wanted to call it off. Katie said she thought it might be a jinx to elope. She told Brad that Margo had been at all of her weddings, so Brad said, \"Maybe Margo's the curse!\" Brad then told Katie they would wait to get married, and he would work his magic with Margo and get her to approve of their marriage. \n\n\nBrad went to the police station and told Margo that Katie was still determined to marry him, but it obviously meant a lot to her to have her sister's blessing, so Brad said he was going to earn it. Margo said it wouldn't happen, and when Brad gave her a list of reasons why he was good for Katie, Margo stopped him and said he wasn't good enough. She told Brad that Katie didn't know what she really wanted. Brad told Margo that if she would go and listen to Katie, maybe she would understand that it was what Katie wanted. He left after telling Margo that if she came to her senses, she could find Katie at the Lakeview. Margo marched out of the station, telling Jack she was leaving but would be back. \n\n\nBrad sat down in front of Jack's desk and told Jack he was waiting for Margo and Katie to have a heart-to-heart talk. Jack said maybe a long engagement would be the best thing, and Brad accused Jack of not wanting him to be happy. Brad left. Jack went back to Carly's, where he said he was tired and was going straight to bed. He kissed Carly on the cheek; she said she knew he could do better than that, so Jack looked at her for a moment, then leaned in and gave her a real kiss. \n\n\nMargo found Katie at the Lakeview and told her Brad had said she should give Katie a chance to convince her that Brad was right for her. Margo promised to listen and not lecture. Katie told Margo how happy Brad made her and how he had promised not to hurt her like Mike and Jack had. Margo said Brad was a rebound relationship, but Katie said she had realized that Jack had been the rebound guy (from Mike). Margo said she just wanted Katie to be happy, so even if Brad wasn't the one she'd expected or wanted Katie to be with, if Brad was the one who made Katie happy, then Katie had Margo's blessing. Margo also told Katie she wanted to have an engagement party for her. Brad walked in, and Margo warned him not to hurt Katie or she would hunt him down. Brad promised, and Margo left. Katie thanked Brad for arranging to make things better between her and Margo. \n\n\nMike arrived at the Lakeview and asked for Katie's room number, but the desk clerk said she couldn't give it to him. She dialed Katie's room on the house phone, but Katie didn't answer. Mike decided not to leave a message and instead walked through Old Town\n, pondering whether or not to stay in Oakdale. \n\n\n",
