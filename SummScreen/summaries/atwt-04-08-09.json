She was preparing to serve them brunch in bed, but they came out and joined Brad and Katie in the living room. Henry was grumpy and didn't like all the coziness. \n\n\nKim came for a visit and was very happy to hear about Katie having a baby. Katie and Brad explained that Vienna was carrying Brad's baby. Kim thought the new development would make the documentary even better. Henry disagreed and wanted nothing to do with the program. \n\n\nKim offered to promote Henry's novel on television and, after some discussion, he reconsidered his decision. Privately, he confided to Vienna that it would be a lie to participate in the movie when the baby she was having wasn't Brad's; it was Henry's. Despite his feelings, Vienna left with Brad and Katie to go to the studio. \n\n\nOn camera, Kim interviewed Brad, Katie, and Vienna about their baby plans. Brad and Katie explained how Vienna volunteered to be a surrogate. Brad made it clear that he was the father. Katie said as long as Brad was the father, she was sure she'd bond with the baby. Henry showed up and watched the taping from the wings. When Kim questioned Vienna about how Henry was handling things, she said he was fine with everything. Backstage, though, Henry tripped on the cables. \n\n\nBrad and Katie convinced Henry to appear on camera with them. Kim asked Henry how he felt about having Vienna carry Brad and Katie's child. Henry flipped out and bolted from the set. Brad followed him and tried to understand Henry's discomfort. \n\n\nHenry nearly told Brad the truth - that Vienna's baby was Henry's. Henry was unable to articulate to Vienna why he was acting so weird. Vienna got him to return to the set. On camera, Vienna said she was happy to be doing this for Brad and Katie. Henry concurred, but he was still acting strangely. \n\n\nBack home, Brad and Katie talked about how Henry was feeling inadequate. Katie disagreed, because she had been married to Henry and she knew that was not his problem. Meanwhile, Vienna confronted Henry about whether he had changed his mind about having kids. He said he still was sure that children were not in his future. \n\n\nCarly tried to connect with Parker because she knew he was upset about Liberty moving out. She told him that if it were meant to be, they would work it out like other married couples did. Craig showed up and offered to talk to Parker. Carly informed him that Parker blamed Craig for his fight with Liberty. \n\n\nCraig spoke with Parker and gave him sage advice about giving Liberty the freedom to make her own choices. Alone with Carly, Craig offered to show her how much wiser he was about marriage than he was as a younger man. Carly asked Craig not to make the situation with Parker about the two of them. \n\n\nJack and Janet were trying to take advantage of being alone, but then Liberty came home early from school. Janet told her daughter that if she didn't want to be married, she should end it right away. Jack agreed with Janet. Janet insisted that Liberty needed to do what was important for her, not Parker. Liberty was sure Parker wouldn't accept an annulment. \n\n\nLiberty went to Carly's, asking to see Parker. He apologized for acting like a jerk. Parker said that whatever Liberty wanted to do, he was okay with that. Liberty was surprised by Parker's new supportive attitude. When he asked her to stay with him, she said yes. Parker and Liberty informed Carly and Craig that they were going to remain married and both would be going back to school. Carly needled Craig about how well he fixed things! \n\n\nCraig talked to Liberty about her dreams for the future. She wanted to get into fashion, so Craig offered to arrange for a summer internship at a magazine in New York. Parker wasn't happy about Liberty spending the summer in New York, even though Carly insisted that was where the fashion world was. Parker was ticked off with Carly. After thinking it over, Parker decided not to stand in Liberty's way. He said he would go to New York with her. Carly thought Parker was being unrealistic, but Parker was insistent. \n\n\nJack told Janet that he would help Parker deal with the Liberty situation by taking him for a fishing trip. Craig showed up at the farm, breaking the news to Jack and Janet that Liberty was moving back with Parker. Craig explained he would separate Liberty and Parker by getting her an internship in New York. Janet was furious with Craig's solution and told him that she would not let Liberty move a thousand miles from home. \n\n\nCraig explained that the internship would be a once in a lifetime opportunity and completely aboveboard. Jack agreed that Craig was making a good offer. Janet asked Jack why he was so gung-ho about Craig helping Liberty, but completely down on anything Craig wanted to do for Parker. \n\n\nCraig returned to Liberty and Parker with word that Janet approved. Parker asked Craig to fund their getting an apartment in New York from Parker's trust. Craig reported that Liberty had to go to New York the next day for an interview for the internship. Parker objected because of baseball tryouts. \n\n\nLiberty asked Craig if they could reschedule, which they couldn't. Craig said he and Carly were going to New York, anyway, and they could take Liberty. Parker wasn't happy, but he was forced to agree. Craig told Carly that everything was going according to plan. Craig offered Carly a drink to toast their plans. She reluctantly accepted, even though it was too early to start drinking.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brad and Katie cater to Vienna's every whim, as Henry at times feels left out. Kim arrives to talk about their show and learns the news about how Vienna is carrying Brad and Katie's baby; she thinks this would make a great curve ball to the original show. Everyone is onboard but Henry. He is finally coaxed into it, but flakes at the last minute leaving Brad and Katie to wonder why. Kim is interviewing Vienna, Brad and Katie about the baby, as Henry quietly watches close by. He has a strong reaction to some things Kim says about the baby and causes a commotion. Henry is forced to join the interview, but he takes off again. Brad tries to get him to tell him what is going on after he puts in his two cents worth, and it looks like Henry might, but Vienna comes to talk with him. Vienna wonders if Henry has changed his mind about having the baby, but he tells her that he hasn't, but he again can't get out of the interview fast enough. After they get home, Katie wonders what is eating Henry. Brad thinks he might be feeling inadequate, as Katie assures him that is not it, but they both put off their concerns and hope Henry comes around. Vienna confronts Henry about his feelings and though he hesitates, he tells her again he is not having second thoughts \u0096 even though he clearly is wrestling with something. An irate Vienna reminds him that Brad and Katie want this baby, so he needs to be a man and learn to deal with this. Carly finds Parker sulking and not wanting to go to school again. She offers him some advice, which Parker doesn't appreciate. Carly and Craig talk about how Liberty and Parker still haven't spoken, but Carly is bothered about how upset Parker is.

Janet and Jack are happy Liberty went to school today and there are no more dramas for the time being. However, Liberty comes home soon and tells them Parker was a no show at school. Jack and Janet use this time to convince her to rethink the marriage at least until they are older. Although Liberty loves Parker, she thinks they might be right. Liberty comes to see Parker, who apologizes and begs her forgiveness. He was not being fair and he wants her to do whatever she wants in the future. Liberty looks unsure but accepts his apology, as they agree to respect the other's decisions and stand by them. Carly and Craig are told of Parker and Liberty's newfound united front. Carly is secretly unhappy, as Craig formulates a new plan. He tells Liberty he can get her into an internship at a Fashion Magazine in NY. Liberty is thrilled and Parker is frustrated. Craig makes some calls, it looks promising, and he goes to talk with Janet for Liberty. Parker doesn't react well, as Liberty tries to talk with him and Carly suggests that he not hold her back because they will resent one another if he does. Parker gives in and decides he is going with her, much to Carly's chagrin. Parker explains that Craig should have no problem giving him money for the summer since this was his idea. Craig talks with Jack and Janet, who are nervously waiting, thinking Liberty is breaking up with Parker. Janet is thrown by the news and is furious with Craig for suggesting NY. Jack and Craig are able to convince her this may be their only option, so she begrudgingly agrees. Craig comes back with his good news only to hear of Parker's plan. Craig gets a call from the Fashion Magazine for an interview tomorrow for Liberty, as Parker doesn't want her to go. He explains he has baseball tryouts, as Craig thwarts his attempt to join Liberty in NY by saying he and Carly have business there and they will take her while he stays there and goes to baseball tryouts. Parker finally agrees and sadly goes to help Liberty pack. Carly is impressed with Craig's help and they are happy so far, as Craig suggests they toast to their plan with some of their Vodka.
