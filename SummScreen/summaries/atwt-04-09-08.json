    "soap_central": "\n\nIn their hotel room, Katie and Brad received a call from Margo telling them that she wanted to throw them an engagement party at her house that evening. She left it up to the happy couple to invite whomever they wanted. Brad was confused by Margo's sudden change in heart, but Katie reassured him that Margo was now behind their impending marriage and was trying to make up for her earlier disapproval. Katie and Brad split up the list of their friends to invite, but when it came time to figure out who would ask Jack, the two were reminded of Katie's past relationship with Jack and the awkward situation it presented. Brad agreed to take on the task of asking Jack, but told Katie he wouldn't ask his brother to be his best man. Katie encouraged Brad to do whatever he wanted and remained hopeful that they could have a happy future, despite her brief marriage to Jack. Both left to tell everyone about the celebration at Margo's. \n\n\nCarly arrived at her home and found a note from Jack telling her that he was feeling better and had gone to the police station to check in. Carly was annoyed that Jack left without her and tried to figure out what her next move should be to keep her relationship with him moving forward. She decided she should go to Lily for advice about how to get Jack back in her good graces. \n\n\nJack went to the police station and told Margo that he had recovered from his gunshot wound and was ready to return to light duty on the force. Margo refused to put Jack back on the streets until his medical leave was over. When Jack started asking about work, Margo realized that he was really there to find out about Katie and Brad. She told Jack that Katie's wedding to Brad was back on. Jack was surprised by the news and unconvincingly faked his approval. Margo asked Jack how his reconciliation with Carly was progressing and Jack said they were starting out as friends. Jack admitted he was anxious about falling in love with Carly again because he feared that she would just continue to make the same mistakes that tore them apart in the past. Just as Margo was ready to offer her take on their relationship, Brad arrived to invite Jack to the party. Jack turned down the invitation and the two brothers exchanged insults. Brad remarked that Jack was a \"sore loser\" and stormed out. Margo told Jack that Brad was right and that going to the party would offer closure for everyone. Jack was concerned if he showed up, Katie might think he was still interested in her, but Margo explained that Katie would know it was over if Jack arrived with Carly as his date. Margo persuaded Jack to do the right thing and go to his brother's engagement party. \n\n\nKatie arrived at the Snyder farm to invite Lily and Holden to the party and found Lily alone. She told Lily about accepting Brad's proposal and Lily offered her congratulations to Katie and said she would be there if she could arrange for a sitter. Katie and Lily discussed their shared inclination to marry and Katie admitted that she hoped her sixth marriage would be her last. Before Katie could leave, Lily asked if she had heard from Mike recently. Katie was taken aback by Lily's question and asked why she was wondering. Lily, knowing Mike didn't want Katie to learn he was back in town, covered for her question by telling Katie she had received a letter from Mike and had assumed he was reconnecting with people from Oakdale. Katie thanked Lily for the news about Mike and began to leave again. Just as Katie walked onto the porch, she found herself face to face with Carly. Carly immediately asked if Katie was there to find Jack, but Katie put Carly's mind at ease when she told her she was there to extend an invitation to Holden and Lily. Carly offered Katie her best wishes for her marriage with Brad and Katie in turn asked Carly to her party. Carly happily accepted the invitation and after Katie left, Carly gleefully gloated to Lily that with Katie married to Brad there was nothing to stop her and Jack from reconciling. Lily reminded Carly that Mike was back in town and his arrival might stop Katie's marriage to Brad from ever taking place. \n\n\nAt the kitchen table, Lily told Carly that Mike was the one who left Katie and that she probably still had deep feelings for him. Carly was quick to point out that she didn't care who Katie was with, as long as it wasn't Jack; Carly was determined to make Jack her husband again. Carly admitted that Mike's arrival complicated things, but Lily explained the only thing between Carly and Jack was their chaotic past. \n\n\nPaul and Meg showed up for the zoning commission's meeting to unveil their plan for the Snyder land and get the city's approval for their development. Meg noticed that Paul was nervous about the presentation and when she asked if he was concerned, he admitted he didn't want to let her family down. Paul quickly changed the subject and asked Meg if she enjoyed their kiss the day before. Meg reminded Paul they were there for business and to stay focused until after the meeting. Paul listened to Meg's suggestion and asked if she knew where Mike was because he was in charge of the information for the zoning board. Paul started to leave Mike a nasty voicemail about not being at the meeting, but Meg grabbed the phone and reminded him that he was trying to be a better man. Paul confessed he was nervous and needed Mike's report, but Meg reassured him that he would do great in front of the committee and moments later the doors opened for their meeting. \n\n\nMike arrived at WOAK in search of Katie and stumbled on a publicity photo of Katie and Brad. When Katie's make-up woman walked into the studio, Mike asked about Katie and learned that she was due into work any moment, but the make-up artist hinted that Brad was probably doing his best to make her late for work. Mike asked the woman if Katie and Brad were serious and much to Mike's disappointment, she told him they had just announced their engagement. \n\n\nIn front of the zoning board, Paul explained their plan for the land. When the committee began to ask tough questions, Paul found himself at a loss to answer with concrete information and kept saying Mike was the one with the numbers. Just as the board was ready to end the meeting without giving approval for the development to move forward, Mike arrived with the reports the committee wanted. Mike eloquently convinced the board that the Snyder project was a great deal for the city. With the meeting over, Meg congratulated Mike on a job well done, but Paul wasted no time in chastising Mike for his tardiness. Mike apologized to Paul, but commented that he wanted to be prepared. When Paul continued to yell at him, Mike told him that he was through supervising the project and was leaving town. Meg and Paul tried to convince Mike to stay and see the job through, but he said Oakdale was no longer his home. Meg knew immediately that his reluctance to stay in town was all about Katie. Mike admitted that after learning of Katie's engagement, there was no reason to remain in town. Meg and Paul wished Mike well, as he left to gather his belongings and leave town that night. \n\n\nAfter Mike walked away, Meg blamed Paul for Mike's decision to leave. Meg reminded Paul that Mike was the right man for the job and that Emma would want him in charge because he cared for the Snyder's land. Paul didn't know what to do, but Meg told him to find a way to influence Mike to stay in Oakdale. \n\n\nAt Worldwide, Mike packed his papers to leave as Brad arrived to share the news with Meg that he was engaged to Katie. Brad found Meg with Paul and invited her to the party. She agreed to go to the celebration and asked if she could bring Paul. Brad was happy both would be attending and left to go to work. Paul was excited Meg had extended the invitation and she admitted she had done it to improve his mood and get him to work on keeping Mike in town. Mike found the two and said goodbye, but Paul immediately started persuading Mike not to leave. Paul reminded Mike that his history with Emma and the Snyder family was essential for the success of the project. Mike agreed that he didn't want to disappoint Emma and decided to stay in town to finish the job. After the deal was done, Meg asked to speak with Mike alone and she offered him some guidance on how to deal with Katie and Brad's engagement. She told him not to run away from his past with Katie, but to figure out what went wrong between them so he would have closure. Mike thanked Meg and left. \n\n\nMeg found Paul in his office and congratulated him on getting Mike to stay. Paul told her he would do anything to see her happy and was grateful she invited him to the party, but he wasn't going to go and disrupt a family gathering. Meg was impressed that Paul was being so thoughtful. \n\n\nKatie showed up for work at the station and was told by the make-up artist that she'd had a visitor earlier. Katie wondered who it might be, but couldn't figure it out by the woman's description. The lady offered to draw a picture of the mystery man and as Katie waited to see who the man was, Jack arrived. Katie was stunned to see Jack and asked him why he was there. He said he was there to see Brad and when Brad arrived moments later, Jack told him he changed his mind and wanted to attend their party. Brad told Jack he didn't want him to come and spoil the night, but Katie stepped in and said he should accept his brother's apology. Brad relented and agreed to let Jack and Carly attend the gathering. \n\n\nJack went back home and told Carly about his day. He invited her to go with him to Brad and Katie's and she happily accepted. As he left the room, Jack asked Carly to invite Parker because he was crazy about Katie and would want to celebrate her happiness. Carly said she would ask Parker to go, but her face showed her obvious frustration with Jack's request. \n\n\nMike went to the police station to talk to Margo and learned that she had already left for the day. He told the officer he was a family friend and would go to her house to visit, but what he didn't realize was that he would be interrupting Katie's engagement party. \n\n\nKatie and Brad finished shooting their scenes for the day and prepared to leave work for their big bash. Right after they walked out, the make-up artist appeared with the sketch of Mike and set it out for Katie to find the next morning. \n\n\n",
