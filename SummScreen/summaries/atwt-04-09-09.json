    "soap_central": "\n\nDamian spotted posters of his face on a bare-chested model from \"Playman\" magazine all around Old Town. He became furious and went straight to Lily and Holden's house. Holden was out of town, so he showed the embarrassing poster to Lily, and he intimated that Luke was responsible. He scolded her for the rotten way she and Holden had raised their son. Damian's accusations angered Lily, and she told him he had no proof that Luke had been responsible; besides, the posters were not Luke's style. \n\n\nIn Java, the \"Z\" twins arrived, bearing one of Damian's posters. They claimed that they had done excellent work for the foundation and showed the poster to Luke and Noah. Noah was horrified and asked why it was appropriate to display Damian's image, but Luke appeared quite pleased. Zac and Zoe said they had been trying to pay back Luke's homophobic dad. \n\n\nLuke was excited about the posters, despite Noah's feeling that public humiliation was wrong. Luke took a call from his mother, who told him that Damian was there; she asked Luke to return home. Luke agreed, and Noah accompanied him. \n\n\nLucy went to Fairwinds and asked Paul for permission to tell Meg about Paul's blackmailing her. She explained that Dusty had requested her to do so, and Paul at first appeared sympathetic and understanding. He told Lucy to tell Meg whatever she liked, but then he added that Lucy should be prepared to divulge all of her secrets, including how she had scammed her own father. Lucy was worried for her humanitarian mission abroad, and she begged Paul to come to a fair custody arrangement with Meg. It was what was best for the baby and the right thing to do. Paul said he was not afraid to use whatever weapons he had at hand. \n\n\nDusty arrived at the farm, but Meg was unresponsive to him. Then she got upset and berated him for beating up Paul and making her look irresponsible to the social worker from child protective services. Dusty promised he could prove that the whole thing was a setup, and that he knew someone involved whom he had given a 24-hour deadline to come forward. \n\n\nMeg said she wanted Dusty out of her life until she had Eliza back. She broke down in tears, as Dusty warned her she must never go back to Paul. Meg said Paul did not want her back because she had been with Dusty. He left to find Lucy. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty confronted Lucy and said they had to settle their problem right away. Lucy suggested they find the missing babysitter and convince her to come forward. She said she had an underground network of people who would help if she asked. Dusty took her to his room where Lucy got on the phone. Her contact was able to learn that the sitter had moved in with a friend across town. \n\n\nThe two of them left to find the address, but when they arrived, the friend told them the girl had left the day before for South America. Dusty declared them out of time, and said they had to contact Meg and the social services people. Lucy argued, but Dusty was determined to help Meg. \n\n\nAt home, Lily showed Luke and Noah one of the posters and said Damian thought Luke was responsible for them. Luke said he was, much to the amazement of Noah and Lily. His mother asked why he had stooped to something so petty, and Luke replied that he just thought it was funny. Damian questioned him, as well, but Luke gave only smart aleck responses designed to further irritate his father. He flatly said he did not want Damian in his life, nor did he respect Damian or even consider him to be a father. Lily asked Luke to apologize, but the boy refused. Noah agreed that they would take down all the posters, and Luke did agree to that. \n\n\nThe boys left and returned to Old Town, where they began tearing down the posters. Luke tried to make Noah understand that he loathed Damian, so Noah suggested he not think about his father so much. Luke confided to Noah that every day he had to remind himself to keep up his guard so that Damian could never get to him again. \n\n\nNoah was further disturbed by Zac and Zoe; he said the two of them creeped him out, and he did not trust them. He stated that under their outgoing personalities, the \"Zs\" were hiding something really ugly. He asked Luke to cut them loose before they damaged the foundation. Luke protested that Zac and Zoe were a great asset to the foundation, not a liability, but Noah warned Luke to tell them to take their jobs more seriously, or else he would. \n\n\nBaby Eliza was extremely fussy, and Paul could not comfort her. He finally called Meg in desperation, because he was out of ideas. Meg talked with him and then left immediately for Fairwinds, which was not really what Paul wanted. When Meg arrived, she checked the baby and declared Eliza had a temperature of 103 degrees and was wheezing, so they headed to Memorial Hospital. \n\n\nDusty continued to try to convince Lucy that his desire to help Meg had nothing to do with Lucy personally. Lucy called that \"bull,\" and said he would never forgive her for taking Johnny away. Lucy told him Meg did not want him anymore or she would not be pushing him away. \n\n\nLily apologized to Damian and asked him to go back to Malta. Damian, however, said their son's efforts to humiliate him showed him that he needed to stick around and find out what was really going on. Lily said she had to go to work, and she hustled Damian out. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Meg and Paul handed the baby over to a doctor, who took her into an exam room. He came out a few minutes later with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Meg lit into Paul for neglecting the baby's symptoms earlier in the day, and she called him selfish. \n\n\nThe social worker arrived, and Meg rapidly changed her tune. She covered for Paul's poor judgment and stated that anyone could have mistaken the baby's symptoms. The social worker left, and Paul wanted to know why Meg had defended him. Meg said that the only thing that really mattered was that Eliza got better. \n\n\nAt Worldwide, Lily and her assistant puzzled over the crash of the company's computer system. The assistant suggested that a hacker was responsible, but he could recover only a partial user name. Lily went to retrieve the backup discs for the work, but she discovered they were not where she kept them. She said the discs were stolen, and she had a pretty good idea who had taken them. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Zac and Zoe spotted Damian sitting on a bench. Zac gave him a wolf whistle and called him \"hot Playman.\" Damian approached and said he recognized them from seeing them at the hotel. He guaranteed that they did not know him or they would never antagonize him. He walked away, and the \"Zs\" made jokes about him and went into Java where Luke and Noah were still arguing about them. \n\n\nZoe said they had just had a clash with \"Daddy dearest,\" and Noah began to challenge them about their bizarre behavior. He asked what gave them the right to insult other human beings, but Zac told Noah to lighten up. Zac and Zoe realized the boys had been arguing about them, so they pushed Luke and Noah together, face-to-face, and urged them to \"kiss and make up.\" They also promised to execute no more practical jokes without prior approval. Luke and Noah kissed. \n\n\nLily used a pass key to go into Damian's room at the Lakeview. She began searching for the missing discs, but Damian walked in and caught her. She demanded her discs back, but Damian claimed to have no idea what she was talking about. He told her that she had misjudged him and said she should be more concerned with whoever was trying to harm their son. Damian vowed to find out who that was, with or without Lily's help. \n\n\nPaul went to the hospital chapel, followed by Meg. She explained how the doctors were stabilizing the baby by administering small doses of antibiotics and then waiting to see how well she tolerated it. Paul was grateful that Meg was there, and he knelt and began to pray more for himself than for the baby. Meg stopped him and urged him to try a prayer of thankfulness instead. \n\n\nLucy and Dusty arrived at the hospital looking for Meg, and Lucy peeked into the chapel and saw her kneeling with Paul. Dusty saw them, too, and Lucy begged him again not to reveal her secret. \n\n\nPaul lit a candle for Eliza, and Meg quietly prayed for the strength to do what she had to do. Then she covered Paul's hand with her own.\n\n\n",

A very upset Damian shows up at Lily's and announces the posters are all over Old Town. He blames Luke for the way she and Holden have raised him.
