Outside the diner, Reid Oliver peeked through the window and watched Luke kiss Noah on the cheek in celebration of his news.  Reid's phone rang just then, and he hurried off to the hospital.\n\n\nLuke offered to take Noah out for dinner, but Noah said he already had \"plans.\"  He said he was having dinner with \"a guy\" he had met, so Luke called it a \"date.\" Noah asked Luke not to make something out of nothing, as his ex began pumping Noah for information.  Noah said the man's name was Richard, and he had met Richard in therapy.  Luke asked if the man was gay, and Noah reluctantly said he was.\n\n\nLuke then insisted that made Noah's dinner a \"date,\" and a frustrated Noah said Luke could call it what he wished.  Luke got very quiet, so Noah explained that it was easy to be with his friend Richard because he didn't feel as if he owed him anything.  He also reminded Luke that Luke had given Noah an \"all-or-nothing\" ultimatum, and Noah had said he couldn't do \"all\" while he was still blind.  Noah claimed that he and Richard were just friends, but Luke said he couldn't watch it happen, so he left the diner.\n\n\nKim and Bob were still \"honeymooning\" by having a drink, and Kim told her husband that she could become accustomed to the kinds of luxuries that Bob had been showering her with since their \"remarriage.\"  Bob's pager went off, and Kim sadly remarked that it had been lovely while it lasted.  The two of them returned to the hospital, where they ran into Dr. Oliver.  Bob informed the doctor that the man suing Oliver in Texas had lodged a formal complaint against him over the death of little Annie Judd.  Bob had to tell Oliver that, under hospital guidelines, anyone under investigation had to be suspended from practicing medicine for the duration of the inquiry.\n\n\nReid Oliver went ballistic and called Bob's rule \"draconian.\"  He demanded that Bob overrule the suspension, and when Bob said he could not, Oliver called him \"a coward.\"  Kim jumped right in to defend her husband, so Reid insulted her by comparing his job of saving lives to hers of producing \"tabloid television.\"  That raised Bob's dander, and he offered to knock Dr. Oliver on his back.  Luke ran in, hustled Dr. Oliver out, and told him to keep his mouth shut.\n\n\nLuke dragged the doctor into a room and told him to stop being outraged and to try and make nice.  He said Oliver had to respect Bob Hughes if he expected to work in Memorial Hospital, no matter what bad news Dr. Hughes had to deliver to him.  Reid said if he couldn't work in an operating room, he had nothing.  Luke advised him to get a lawyer and make someone listen to his side of the story about the little girl's death.  Reid said he was a doctor, and without medicine, he had nothing to hold onto.  Then he told \"Mr. Snyder\" that he needed Luke.\n\n\nOliver said he needed Luke's name, money, and power, \"all of it.\"  Luke left for a while as Reid made an attempt to clean out his locker, but Luke soon returned.  Oliver asked Luke to help him get back in the operating room so he could help Noah.  Luke said he already had, since he had just called his grandmother and asked her to make a few calls, one of which was to the Texas Medical Review License Board.  They had scheduled an emergency hearing, so it was time for Dr. Oliver to go and fight.  Luke also said he was not letting Reid do it alone, and he announced he was going to Texas with the doctor.\n\n\nThe two went to pick up some food at Al's before heading to Lucinda's private jet.  Reid went to buy some magazines in the bookstore, and Luke went to get the food order.  Inside the diner, Luke heard Noah and Richard laughing and having a good time.  Luke took the order out and watched them through the window until Reid returned.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Kim asked Bob why he put up with the attitude and mouth of Dr. Oliver, and Bob defended the man's surgical skills.  Kim's phone rang, and she took a call from the station that sent her running with Bob right after her.\n\n\nMolly walked into the Snyder farm kitchen and found Emma baking both cookies and piecrust.  The place smelled wonderful, and even though Molly was wearing a beautiful new dress for her romantic evening with Holden, she helped Emma take some cookies out of the oven.  Emma broke the news that Holden had gone away with Lily to try to straighten out Faith, and it hurt Molly's feelings that he hadn't called her himself.  Emma said Lily and Holden were trying to get through to Faith in a calm and peaceful environment.  Molly said she understood, and then, much to Molly's surprise, Emma asked if Molly would like the address of the cabin.\n\n\nMolly said that Lily would be furious if Molly showed up unannounced, but Emma shouted that she'd \"had it\" with Lily.  She also thanked Molly for being there for her son when Lily was treating him so badly, and she said she guessed that both Holden and Faith needed Molly there.  Molly was afraid she would look \"desperate,\" but Emma said there was nothing \"desperate\" about helping someone you loved, and she gave Molly directions.\n\n\nAt home, Lily took Faith's phone away from her and ordered the girl to pack a bag for their cabin.  Then she told Holden that he needn't go with them, but he was fearful that Lily could not handle Faith alone.  Holden said they had to do it together, as a family.  He was determined to make their daughter face the consequences of her actions.  Faith returned and announced that she would go to the cabin with them under one condition: Molly had to accompany them.\n\n\nHolden argued with his daughter and reminded her that she was not \"calling the shots.\"  Lily said the purpose of their trip was to be a family again and to learn to trust one another.  Faith accused her mother of hating her, but Holden urged his daughter to keep an open mind.\n\n\nThey drove to the cabin, which had no cell phone service, so Faith complained bitterly about that and having to share a room with her mother.  The only thing Faith didn't hate was the ingredients for \"s'mores\" after dinner.  When her parents went outside to fetch the rest of the groceries, Faith began snooping through the cupboards, and she found a bottle of scotch.  She poured some in a glass and drank it down.  She checked on her parents outside, and then helped herself to a larger drink.  She chugged her third drink, and then put the bottle back in the cabinet, as Lily and Holden walked back in.\n\n\nFaith wiped out the glass, but she was clumsy in putting it back, and Lily noticed.  Faith was awkward in her speech, as well, and she stumbled as she aimed for the couch.  Holden went up to her and sniffed her face before turning to Lily with disgust and saying that their daughter had been drinking.  Lily called Faith stupid and irresponsible, but Holden urged Lily to calm down.  Faith got in her mother's face and said how much she hated her life, and it was all Lily's fault.\n\n\nHolden took over and tried to reason with the girl.  Faith complained that her parents were terrible role models, and she was a laughingstock at school.  Holden and Lily both asked Faith to help them to help her, but the girl burst into tears.  Lily sat with her on the couch and held her, since Faith felt ill.  \n\n\nFaith began to apologize, but suddenly the door burst open, and Molly yelled, \"Surprise!\"  Lily took Faith outside for some air, and Holden explained that Faith was drunk.  Molly said that Emma had given her the address at the cabin, but Molly wasn't sure that she should have intruded.  Holden said that the package sent to Molly at WOAK had contained illegal drugs, so Lily had thought an intervention was in order.\n\n\nMolly asked if Holden wanted her to speak to the girl, but he thought that Lily should handle Faith.  They kissed, and Holden apologized for not having called Molly before they got out of cell range.  Outside, Faith begged to go back to Oakdale with Molly, but Lily refused.  Faith got her bad attitude back, and Lily felt as if she had let her daughter down.  Lily talked about her stormy relationship over the years with Lucinda, and said how much she loved Faith.\n\n\nMolly volunteered again to speak with Faith, but Holden said Lily had to be the one.  They kissed, as Lily and Faith walked back in.  Molly hugged Faith and said goodbye, and Holden and Lily settled Faith on the couch under a blanket.  They remembered happier days when Faith had been young and they had gone camping, and their hands touched on the blanket on top of Faith.\n\n\nKim dragged Bob to WOAK, and then she called Molly on her cell phone.  Molly was just leaving the cabin, so her service was sporadic.  Kim asked if Molly wanted the first crack at a breaking news story that was happening on the courthouse steps in Chicago.  The connection was bad, but Molly heard that the story was at the Chicago courthouse, and she agreed to go.  Kim was concerned because she had not gotten to tell Molly about the nature of the news, so she wondered if she should go to Chicago herself. Bob, however, stepped on one of the television sets and asked a cameraman to begin rolling.\n\n\nBob introduced himself and then his lovely wife, Kim.  He said how much he loved her and presented her with a photo album of their wedding.  He made a romantic speech about their lives together, and then he kissed his bride.  The cameraman yelled, \"That's a wrap!\"\n\n\nMolly arrived at the Chicago courthouse just in time to see and hear Senator Silas Whitman, her former lover, announce that he had been cleared of all charges and was a free man.  Molly was astounded, and she turned to walk away, but the congressman caught up with her.  Molly told him to get away, but Whitman tried to convince her to go back with him.  Molly rebuffed him, but he shouted, \"I'll win you back!\"\n\n\n",
