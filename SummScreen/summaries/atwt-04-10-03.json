After he is gone, Dusty's cell phone rings.  Molly answers it and tells the person that she can take a message for Dusty because she is his wife.  She gets a funny look on her face and hangs up.  When Dusty returns, she asks him why he is accepting money from Barbara Ryan.  Molly explains that while he was gone, his cell phone rang and she answered it and the person on the other end informed her that his wire transfer from Barbara Ryan had not arrived yet.  Dusty questions her about answering his cell phone.  She says that he was so adamant about them taking their relationship public that she didn't think it was a problem answering his cell phone.  He says she is right and he makes a fast excuse about Barbara making an investment through him.  He asks Molly not to mention this investment to Paul.  She asks if this would be a problem for Paul.  Dusty says that he and Paul have been going through some changes and he would rather Paul not know that his mother and Dusty are doing business.  Dusty asks Molly if this is a problem for her.  Molly says no.  Dusty asks her to get him another drink and he needs to call the bank.  Molly takes the hint and leaves the table.  Dusty calls Barbara's cell phone and gets her voicemail.  Dusty leaves a message for Barbara about the money.  He informs her that he needs the money and he asks, \"Where are you?\"  Molly comes back to the table with Dusty's drink.  She starts to bug Dusty about letting her invest her money.  Dusty says that the he doesn't mix business with his personal life.  John Dixon comes in and interrupts them.  Dusty jumps up and hugs John.  He asks John to join them.  John says that he can't, but before he leaves, he tells Molly about seeing Carly.  He tells Molly that Carly has no energy and is pretty much lifeless.  Molly says that is because she is pregnant.  John says that she is unemployed and has no permanent address and she is alone.  Molly says that she is not alone.  She adds that she has two men looking after her and three if you count Craig.  John puts his hands on his head and says, \"How stupid of me!  Carly has everything that a woman would want.\"  He excuses himself and leaves Dusty and Molly to go to the bar.  Dusty sits back down and says that he doesn't know this Carly girl, but it sounds like she needs a friend.  Molly says, \"Great, why don't you give her a call?\"  Molly gets up to leave and Dusty asks where she is going.  Molly says that she doesn't need him to tell her what to do.  Molly walks out of the lounge.  \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Rosanna is setting out some food and champagne for Barbara's visit to show them her designs.  Rosanna goes to the kitchen to get more food.  While she is gone, Craig gets a call from Rose telling him that they have Barbara and they are on their way to drop her.  Craig tells Rose that he will be in touch.  As he is hanging up the phone, Rosanna returns with some caviar.  Craig informs her that he will not be staying to see Barbara's designs.  Rosanna tells him that this is all about Monte Carlo and she thought he would want to be involved.  He says that he doesn't want to have anything to do with Bar-bar.  Craig leaves Rosanna waiting for Barbara.  \n\n\nAfter John leaves from his visit with Carly, Emma walks in and says that John was right about her starting her career again after the baby is born.  Emma tells Carly that she has to go out.  Emma asks Carly to \"punch down\" her bread dough.  Carly says that she doesn't know how to do that.  Emma says that all she has to do is make a fist and rear back and make the dough beg for mercy.  She reminds Carly that the dough doesn't strike back.  After Emma leaves, Carly looks at the dough and sees Barbara's face.  Barbara says to her, \"The favor of the month.  That is all you have ever been and all you'll ever be.\"  Carly makes a fist and starts to beat the dough.  \n\n\nKatie meets Craig in front of Barbara's hotel suite.  Katie still has keys to the suite and Craig tells her that he needs to get inside.  Katie wants to know why.  Craig says that he will tell her once they are inside.  After they are inside the suite, Craig tells Katie that she can leave.  Katie says that she won't leave until Craig explains why he needed to get inside.  Craig tells her that Barbara is out of town and she instructed him to come inside and get her designs for Monte Carlo.  Katie wants to know why.  Craig informs her that he is Monte Carlo.  He tells his sister to start looking for the designs.  Katie isn't sure, but she starts to look around for the designs.  \n\n\nRose, Henry and Emily take Barbara, who is knocked out, to the edge of a wooded area.  Emily informs Rose and Henry that this is the end of the road and they need to carry Barbara a half a mile into the woods to find the cabin.  Henry fakes a back problem and Rose and Emily end up carrying Barbara the whole way into the woods.  When they find the cabin and take Barbara in and dump her onto the bed, Henry is hurt that Rose and Emily don't asks about his back problem.  Rose and Emily shoot daggers at Henry.  Rose's cell phone rings and when she answers the phone, Craig asks her if they found Barbara's designs on her.  Rose says that she had nothing on her.  Craig hangs up on Rose.  Emily and Rose get Barbara situated in the bed and Rose finds some food.  Rose's cell phone rings again and when she answers it she asks, \"Do you have them yet?\"  It is Paul on the other end and not Craig.  He asks, \"What am I suppose to have?\"  When Rose hears Paul's voice, she makes up a story about waiting to hear from her shoe repairman.  She asks how is he doing.  He tells her that he is waiting for his mother at Fairwinds with Rosanna and they are going to see Barbara's designs for Monte Carlo.  Paul adds that he is worried because his mother was so excited about showing her designs and he thinks something has happened to her.  Rose reminds him that he has told her not to jump to conclusions.  She reassures him that Barbara is probably late and will be there soon.  Paul says that she is probably right and they say goodbye and hang up.  When Rose hangs up her phone, she says that she just lied to her fianc\u00e9.  Henry adds that she was good at it, too.  Emily punches him in the chest.  Rose says that she is going to leave and help Craig look for the designs.  Then she remembers that they only have one car.  Emily gives her a phone number to call a car service and tells her to give them directions to get to the edge of the woods and she and Henry will meet them there later.  Rose leaves to help Craig.  As Rose leaves the cabin in the woods, Henry yells out the door that if she and Craig find money in Barbara's hotel suite, they are to share whatever they find.  Henry closes the door and Emily shoots him a look.  Henry says that everything needs to be covered up front.  Emily finds some paper and writes a note.  Henry asks what is she doing.  Emily says that she is leaving instructions.  She takes the food and places it closer to Barbara and lays the note on top of the food.  Emily goes over to Barbara and says, \"This has cost me a lot, Barbara.  But if is brings you a fraction of the pain that you brought me, I'll consider it a good deal.\"  She pats Barbara on the shoulder.  Emily and Henry leave the cabin.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul tells Rosanna that he suspects Craig of doing something to his mother.  Rosanna says that she can understand why he would suspect her fianc\u00e9 since everyone in Oakdale suspects him, but what possible link could he have to Barbara being late.  Paul says that Craig has made it clear that he doesn't want Barbara designing for Monte Carlo and maybe he has distracted her to make her look bad.  Paul picks up his coat to leave.  Rosanna says that she is concerned and if Paul should hear anything to give her a call.  Paul turns to her and says that he hopes he is wrong, but not for Craig's sake, but for hers.  \n\n\nLater, Craig shows up at Fairwinds.  He finds Rosanna in the living room and asks how it went with Barbara.  Rosanna informs him that Barbara didn't show up and Paul had suspected Craig of keeping Barbara away.  Craig reminds Rosanna that he had been with her all day and how could he have detained Barbara.  Rosanna says that he is right.  Craig gives her a kiss and leaves the living room.  After Craig leaves her, Rosanna says, \"Please don't be lying about this, Craig.\"\n\n\nAt the cabin, Barbara wakes up and doesn't know where she is.  She goes over to the window and pulls back the curtain to find the windows are boarded up.  She goes to the door and finds that she is locked in.  She sees the tray of food and goes over to it.  She finds the note that reads, \"You have not been kidnapped.  Try to relax.  No harm will come to you.\"  Barbara starts to yell, \"Help!  Help!!\"  She runs over to the door and starts to bang on it.  She yells, \"Let me out!  Let me out!!\"\n\n\n",

There is a note saying that she will not be harmed. Katie & Craig find Barbara's designs at her suite & Craig likes them. Meanwhile, Paul and Rosanna are concerned of Babs' whereabouts. Rosanna thinks that Craig has something to do with it. At Java Underground, Paul informs Hal of Barbara's disappearance. Hal's going to file a missing person's report on her if she doesn't surface soon. Dusty and Molly share another passionate kiss. Rose sees Dusty outside of Barbara's suite and asks about the 25k she needs for her shop. He's more worried about why she's coming out of the suite if she isn't there. John makes a house call to Carly & requests that she and Molly make nice. John later shares the same info with Molly at the Lake View.",
