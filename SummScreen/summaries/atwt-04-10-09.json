Craig told Lucy it felt good to know he could depend on her again, and he thanked her. \n\n\nCraig went to the farm to pick up Liberty, who was excited about their trip to New York. Craig assured Jack that he and Carly would take good care of Liberty in New York. Liberty went upstairs to get one more thing for her trip, and Jack told Craig he didn't want to see either Parker or Liberty get hurt. Craig said neither did he, but Jack said he thought everything Craig had done had been to further Craig's own agenda. Craig responded by saying that what he was doing was working, because the kids were shutting Jack and Carly out and letting Craig in. \n\n\nLiberty came back downstairs, and she left with Craig after saying goodbye to Jack. They went to pick up Carly at her house, and Liberty asked for a moment alone with Parker. Parker said he didn't understand why Liberty had to go, but she pointed out that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Parker agreed and said that if Liberty did get an internship at the fashion magazine, they could spend the summer living together in New York. He was certain Craig would give them money from Parker's trust fund for that, because the whole internship had been Craig's idea. Parker and Liberty kissed, and she left to join Craig and Carly. \n\n\nParker went to baseball tryouts and was surprised to find Jack there, waiting for him. Jack reminded Parker that he had never missed any of Parker's tryouts, but Parker pointed out that he wasn't in Little League anymore. Jack said if Parker didn't want Jack to stick around, he wouldn't, because he didn't want to be a distraction, but he made Parker promise to let him know how his tryouts went. Jack told Parker to call if he needed anything while Carly and Liberty were gone. Parker said he would, and he thanked Jack. \n\n\nIn New York, Liberty was intimidated by the very building in which the fashion magazine was headquartered, but Carly reminded her that the people inside were just people. Carly and Craig wished Liberty good luck and then waited outside until the interview was over. When Liberty came back outside, she was with a man she introduced as Colin Lowell. Liberty told them that Colin was the head of the internship program at Fashionista Weekly and thus was her new boss. \n\n\nCarly and Craig congratulated Liberty on getting the internship and said they would start looking for a place for Liberty to live during the summer. Colin told them that wasn't necessary, because the interns were expected to live together in a dorm. Liberty asked if she could live in the dorm with someone who wasn't an intern, but Colin said that wasn't allowed. Liberty then asked if she had to live in the dorm, and Colin said yes, but he assured her she would want to. \n\n\nCraig asked Colin if they could have a moment alone with Liberty. Carly asked Liberty what was wrong, and Liberty said that she had thought that Parker could live with her in New York. She said if she couldn't spend the summer with Parker, then she didn't want the internship. Liberty said that Parker wouldn't want to get an apartment to live in by himself while she lived in the dorm, and Craig said that Parker couldn't afford to do that anyway. \n\n\nLiberty questioned whether that meant Craig wouldn't release money from Parker's trust fund for an apartment, and Craig said that was what he meant, because that wasn't what the trust fund was meant for. \n\n\nCarly asked Liberty what the internship would be like, and Liberty told her the exciting things she would get to do if she accepted the position, but Liberty reiterated that she would turn it down if it meant not being with Parker. Carly told Liberty that Parker would understand that the internship was very special to Liberty, and although he might be hurt at first, Carly felt certain that Parker would support Liberty if she told him how much the position meant to her. \n\n\nLiberty decided to call Parker to discuss it with him. When he answered the phone and heard Liberty's voice, Parker told her how much he missed her. Then, he told her he had just made the varsity baseball team. Liberty was excited for him, and she told him she had some news, too. \n\n\nLiberty told Parker that she had been offered the internship, and he told her that was amazing. He asked if she was looking for an apartment, but she told him she would have to stay in the dorm with the other interns. Liberty also told Parker what Craig had said about not paying for an apartment for Parker, but she told him that she still really wanted to take the opportunity to work in New York. Liberty spotted Colin approaching her, so she told Parker that she had to hang up, but would call again later. \n\n\nAfter Liberty hung up, she and Colin went back over to Craig and Carly. Liberty told them that Colin wanted her to attend a mixer with some magazine staff and the other new interns. Craig thought that was a great way to start networking, and Carly said that even though Janet would probably kill her, she thought Liberty should go. Colin promised to return Liberty to the hotel at a reasonable hour, and they left. Carly wondered what they should do next, and Craig suggested they have a party of their own. \n\n\nCraig and Carly went to Battery Park and sat down on a bench. Craig offered Carly a drink of vodka, which she accepted. Carly then told Craig that she thought he had known all along that if Liberty accepted the internship, she would have to stay in a dorm without Parker. Carly wanted to know why Craig hadn't told her that, and Craig said that he had wanted to teach Carly a lesson. Carly asked what the lesson was, and he replied, \"That you can trust me.\" \n\n\nHe told her that if he said that everything would be okay, then everything would be okay. Carly then asked what they would do with the free time they suddenly had. Craig said he had a few ideas. Carly replied, \"I'm sure you do!\" and they kissed. \n\n\nLucy got a phone call from her contact telling her that a shipment was ready to go out that morning. Lucy thought it was short notice, but assured the person that if a shipment needed to go out, she would take care of it. Lucy went down to the docks and spoke with Cesar, the dockworker with whom she was working. After Cesar walked away, Lucy turned and saw Jack, who asked what Lucy was doing there. \n\n\nLucy said that she was surprised to see Jack there. He told her that he was there on business. When Lucy asked what kind of case Jack was working on, Jack told her it was a smuggling operation, although the police hadn't been able to figure out yet what was being smuggled. \n\n\nJack asked again why Lucy was there, and she told him that she liked to walk along the waterfront to clear her mind. Jack warned her that it wasn't the safest part of town for her to be in, and Lucy thanked him and left. \n\n\nAfter Parker's phone call from Liberty, Parker went to the police station and told Jack that Liberty had gotten the internship. He also told Jack that Liberty would have to live in a dorm and that Craig had told Liberty he wouldn't release trust fund money to rent Parker an apartment in New York for the summer. Jack said Craig wasn't the only one who would have had a problem with that, and Parker said he realized that. Parker told Jack that he needed Jack's help. \n\n\nWhen Jack asked what he could do, Parker asked Jack to give him money to go to New York. Jack wondered why Parker couldn't wait until Liberty came back home the next day, but Parker said if his wife was going to spend the whole summer away from him in New York, he wanted to at least be able to see where she would be staying. \n\n\nDusty went to see Lucy at the Lakeview to apologize for his behavior the previous day. Lucy said she understood it was hard for Dusty to see Meg with Paul, but she told him that it might not have meant what Dusty thought it meant. Lucy told Dusty that she had found out that Eliza was sick, and that was why Paul and Meg had been together at the hospital. Seeing Dusty's concern, Lucy also told him that she had checked on Eliza's condition that morning, and Eliza was doing much better. Lucy then suggested that Dusty try to talk to Meg again. \n\n\nPaul and Meg woke up next to one another in chairs at the hospital, having dozed off while waiting for news about Eliza. The doctor came out and informed them that Eliza's fever had broken during the night, and he thought he could discharge Eliza, provided that someone kept a close eye on her to be sure her fever didn't return. Paul and Meg thanked the doctor, and Paul told Meg he would hire a nurse to watch Eliza. Meg protested, saying that was unnecessary since she herself was a nurse. \n\n\nPaul told Meg it wasn't her decision to make, and that if she helped him at all, it would be at his house and on his terms. He told her she could help him take Eliza home, but that was it. Meg told herself that was a start, and together, they left the hospital. At Fairwinds, Meg held Eliza until Paul got a bottle ready for her. \n\n\nPaul said he would feed the baby, since Meg was tired. Eliza fell asleep after her bottle, and Paul saw that Meg had also drifted off. Paul covered Meg with a throw blanket and kissed her on the cheek. As he left the room, Meg opened her eyes, looking pleased with herself. \n\n\nA couple of hours later, Meg awoke from a nap. Paul told her that Eliza was still asleep. Meg offered to leave before Eliza awoke, to make things easier, and she asked if she could come by the next day to check on Eliza. Paul said that wasn't necessary and suggested Meg stay at Fairwinds until Eliza was better. Paul made it clear it would be a temporary arrangement and that he was only doing it for Eliza. Meg said she understood completely. \n\n\nMeg went to the farm to pack a few things for her stay at Fairwinds. She found Dusty there, and he told her that he had heard that Eliza was sick. Meg told him that Eliza was doing better. Dusty couldn't believe Meg was going back to Fairwinds, but she said that was where her daughter was, so that was where she would be, too. \n\n\nDusty said that Paul just wanted Meg back with him, and that was what Paul was getting. Meg said that if that was what Dusty thought, then what she was doing was working. Dusty warned Meg that she was taking a huge risk, but Meg said she wouldn't get caught, because she had learned how to deceive from the master of deception, Paul Ryan. \n\n\nMeg returned to Fairwinds and thanked Paul for letting her be there with Eliza. He told her she was welcome, because he wanted to do whatever needed to be done to make Eliza better. Meg tried to caress Paul's hand while handing Eliza to him, but he removed her hand and reminded her that she was only there for Eliza's sake. \n\n\nDusty went back to the Lakeview and saw Lucy in the lobby. He told her he had gone to see Meg and had found out that Meg was moving back in with Paul. Lucy offered to buy Dusty a drink, but he declined and went up to his room. A few minutes later, Lucy knocked on his door, and when Dusty answered, Johnny went running to him, saying, \"Daddy!\" Johnny asked if Dusty wanted to play with his trains, and Dusty said sure. Dusty told Lucy that she didn't play fair, and Lucy asked if that was a \"thank you.\" Dusty thanked her and sat down to play with Johnny.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
