Emily stops by and frets about what will happen if they're caught.  Emily wavers whether she should unlock the door and let Babs walk free.  Rose tries to knock some sense into Emily by telling her there is NO PROOF linking them to the crime.  The only way they will go to jail is if Emily let's Barbara walk.  Emily decides to cool it for now.\n\n\nRosanna is excited that Mike finished building her wedding Paragon and invites him to her wedding taking place in a couple of days.  He feels uncomfortable about attending, but accepts her invitation.\n\n\nCarly tries to get rid of Emma so she can get in touch with Craig.  Once Emma is on her way to the pharmacy, she calls Craig on his cell phone.  He answers her call just as he walks into Emma's kitchen.  They both hang up and Craig tells her that since Barbara is temporarily out of the picture, Carly should be free from any distraction and she should be able to design a line of clothes.  Carly is skeptical, \"Maybe you and Emily kidnapped her.\"  Craig says, \"What difference does it make?  She's gone.  You can't kill her...she's a cockroach.  She keeps coming back.\"  He ultimately convinces her to give designing another shot, and he leaves her to work her magic.  \n\n\nCraig finds a secluded roaring fire where he plans to burn Barbara's designs.  He reviews her work one final time before he tosses them into the flames.  He is truly impressed with Barbara's talent, but smugly smiles as he watches her work go up in smoke.  Flames reflect on his dark sunglasses where his eyes ought to be.\n\n\nLater, Craig returns to check on Carly's progress.  She is frustrated because she can't find any inspiration.  Craig is full of inspiration after sneaking a peak at Barbar's sketches, and whispers those themes into Carly's ear.  Carly thinks it's brilliant and gets straight to work.  Before Craig leaves, Carly plants a big thank you kiss on Monty's lips for all his inspiration and support.  Craig's breath is taken away, and he accepts her compliment.\n\n\nHal and Paul drop by Barbara's suite and look around for any sign of foul play.  Paul snoops through his mother's checkbook and discovers several checks signed over to Dusty.\n\n\nAt the cabin, Barbara tries to escape through the chimney, but decides she needs to be fifty pounds lighter in order to slip through that hole.  Then she envisions Craig laughing at her at that very moment because she thinks he must have a camera or a microphone set up somewhere in the room.  She scours her backwoods prison for evidence, but doesn't find anything.  She stops looking, and yells into the air that Craig's plan won't work.  \"I'm going to get out of here and sell my designs to Rosanna, then you and Carly will go straight to jail!\"  Later, Emily stops by with a tray of food.  She shoves it through the doggie door, then steps back.  Inside, Barbar is playing with a fire poker when she spies the tray.  She rushes to the door, and gets down on all fours.  She pushes the hatch open and yells, \"Is that you Craig!?  You and Carly?!  Oh, Craig.  You aren't going to have a design empire.  I'm going to send you to jail to rot for the rest of your miserable life!\"  She picks up the tray, shoves it back out the chute, and spits, \"You can have it!  I'm not going to eat it.  And you can tell Hal that the mother of his children starved to death in the middle of the woods!\"  After Emily thinks it's safe, she tiptoes away with a panicked look on her face.\n\n\nMolly and Dusty wake up in each other's arms and Molly offers to order up some coffee.  While she's out of earshot, Dusty again tries to get in touch with Babs.  He leaves a message asking her again for the $25,000.  Molly returns just in time to hear that Dusty needs Barbara's money.  He sloughs her question off, and explains it's for an investment.  Now Molly wants in on the action, but Dusty declines her offer.  There's a knock at the door.  Hal and Paul stop by looking for Barbara.  Molly gets dressed and lets herself out.  Paul asks Dusty about the checks his mother has been writing to him, and Dusty explains that Barbara is a new client.  Rose stops by looking for Dusty's investment money.  Hal and Paul split and go looking for the next logical suspect, Craig Montgomery.  Dusty keeps Rose talking about Barbar until she has a slip of the tongue.  Dusty presses her for the truth.  Rose makes him promise to keep her secret and tells him Barbara is alright, \"She's been detained...just a little bit.\"  Rose brings up the check again, but he says his investor is on a plane, and he can't get in touch with him until later.  Rose's cell phone rings.  Emily is unraveling on the other end.  Em says Barbara wouldn't eat the food and is worried they're going to be guilty of murder after she starves herself to death.  Emily says she's going to drop everything in Craig's lap and wash her hands clean of the whole mess, \"I'm not cut out for this!\"  Emily hangs up, and Rose rushes off to do damage control.  After Rose leaves, Dusty mutters, \"Barbara you idiot!  How am I supposed to get this $25,000?!\"\n\n\nLater, Dusty meets Molly in the lounge and she asks him about the investment he's making for Barbara.  He doesn't give her any details, and cites ethical reasons why he doesn't mix business with pleasure.  Molly is intrigued, and practically begs him to let her in on the deal.  Dusty relents, and says it'll cost $25,000 to get started.  Molly doesn't bat an eyelash, and dashes off for her checkbook.  While she's away, Dusty says, \"Barbara, wherever you are, you better get back soon.\"\n\n\nEmma returns from her day of grocery shopping and Carly quickly hides her sketchbook.  Carly yawns and tells Emma she's already eaten and feels tired, so she's going to turn in for the night.  Emma is suspicious, but plays along.  After Carly leaves, Emma says, \"What are you up to Miss Carly?\"\n\n\nHal and Paul stop by Fairwinds looking for Craig.  Rosanna doesn't want to believe Craig would be involved in Barbara's disappearance, but doesn't think it's out of the question either.  Just then, Craig returns home and quickly denies any involvement.  The doorbell rings, and Gloria answers the call.  Emily rushes in and blurts out, \"Montgomery...we've got trouble!\"  Then she sees that Hal, Paul, and Rosanna are also in the room.  Hal smirks and asks his wife what kind of trouble she's in.  Craig reluctantly says that Emily is secretly helping him plan his honeymoon to Italy.  Hal doesn't understand.  Rosanna is stunned with the news, but ultimately likes the idea.  Emily says that she is very familiar with a place along the Italian coastline, but she rushed over because she's been having horrible luck booking certain dates.  There is one weekend available, but she needs Craig's credit card to book the deal.  The doorbell rings, and Rosanna answers the door this time.  Rose rushes in and is surprised to see Paul.  He asks her what she's doing there.  Rose looks around for an excuse, sees Emily, and says, \"Emily called me.\"  Emily sits with the hot potato for a bit, scratches her head, then smoothly stutters, \"She's the only one here who knows how to speak Italian.\"  She needed a translator with her contact in Italy.  Emily swiftly changes the subject and asks Craig for his credit card.  She mutters, \"This is going to cost you!\"  Craig smirks, gives her the card, and loudly says, \"Whatever you need.\"  Emily snatches Rose's arm and drags her away.  Hal and Paul soon follow.  After the crowd is gone, Rosanna turns to her fianc\u00e9e, smiles, and says, \"If I find out you had anything to do with Barbara's disappearance, you are going to have a very unhappy wife.\"  She turns and walks out of the room.  Craig exhales, rolls his eyes, and says, \"It wouldn't be the first time.\"\n\n\nBack at the cabin, Barbara walks around wielding the fire poker.  \"All the comforts of home.  How very thoughtful Craig!\"  She swings the poker and knocks over a lamp.  \"You were never one to really think ahead.\"  She swings and smashes a vase to bits.  She spies the dog hatch and says, \"That can't be very hard to rip out.\"  She starts to hack away at the door while laughing menacingly.\n\n\n",

Noticing the dog door, Barbara begins to crazily hit it with the fire poker in hopes to be free. Rosanna warns Craig that he better not have anything to do with Barbara suddenly vanishing.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hal and Paul questioned Dusty about Babs' whereabouts after they found several checks written out to him for big money. Rose came to Dusty's room wanting her check for 25K. He doesn't have the money, but lied. Rose ended up lying to Paul about seeing Dusty the day before. Rose lied to Dusty about her knowing where Babs is. Her guilt forced her to tell Dusty that Babs is okay. Molly overheard Dusty's conversation with his \"banker\". He told Molly that he had an inside track on the market. Mol plans to give him 25k to invest. Craig burned Babs' designs & gave Carly some ideas from the designs. Carly was so happy that she gave him a kiss & slapped him on the butt! Rosanna invited Mike to her wedding. After a lot of persuasion, he accepted.",
