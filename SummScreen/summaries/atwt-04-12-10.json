    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt Monte Carlo, Carly showed Craig her new designs and asked for his honest opinion, not just what she wanted to hear.  Craig liked the sketches and reminded his partner that after the Milan show, investors would be begging to give them money.  Gabriel arrived, and Carly picked up her sketches and headed out the door.  She quietly reminded Gabriel to keep his eye on \"that thing\" they had talked about.\n\n\nGabriel worked on the overhead lighting at Monte Carlo, but Craig hassled him.  He said he didn't like the boy, and he ordered Gabriel to go to Al's and fetch two roast beef sandwiches.  Gabriel asked if he wanted mayo or mustard, and Craig answered \"both,\" and Gabriel grinned and said he already knew that.  He took off for the diner, and Craig went to pick up Johnny.\n\n\nLiberty awoke to find Parker asleep in a chair in the bedroom.  She got up and covered him with a blanket, grabbed her coat, and took off.  When Carly returned home, she asked a dazed Parker why he was up so early since there was no school that day.  He said Liberty had \"snuck out\" while he was sleeping in the chair.  Parker was worried because Liberty left no note, nor was she picking up her phone.  Carly reminded her son that he could not make other people's decisions for them, and she suggested that he \"back off.\"  Parker said he didn't like it, and he stomped out.\n\n\nGabriel walked into the diner, and placed his takeout order for the sandwiches with mustard, mayo, and \"arsenic on the side,\" and then he spotted Liberty sitting at a table and frowning at the menu.  He went to sit with the girl, and  Liberty said she had dreamed of an Al's burger all the time she was in Minneapolis, but all of a sudden it didn't sound so great any more.  Gabriel called the waitress and ordered Liberty a grilled cheese sandwich with light butter, white rice, and plastic, not metal, utensils.  Liberty asked how he knew that metal utensils tasted weird if someone was on chemo, and he said he'd seen it in a movie.  He also asked where Liberty's \"bodyguard\" was, and she again explained that Parker was just a friend.  Gabriel stayed while Liberty ate, and she thanked him for allowing her to forget all about cancer for a brief while. He wrote down his phone number for her, and then he grabbed his order and left.\n\n\nBack at Monte Carlo, Craig twirled Johnny in his desk chair until Craig got dizzy.  Gabriel returned, and Johnny took one look at him and announced, \"That's the guy who talked to me on the playground.\"  Gabriel handed Johnny his lunch, and the boy went into another room to watch television.  Craig got in Gabriel's face and said that his son had recognized Gabriel from a conversation on the school ground, and he realized that Gabriel was who was stalking him.  Craig accused the boy of stealing confidential files and sending the threatening note on the night of the Monte Carlo opening.\n\n\nCraig warned that he would call the police, but Gabriel already knew that Margo was Craig's sister, and he said if Craig made the call, he'd have to tell the chief that Craig was stealing Parker's trust fund to finance his business with Carly.  The boy also knew that Craig had asked his accountant to make a false set of books to cover his tracks.  He called Craig' bluff, and Craig put down the phone.\n\n\nCraig asked what Gabriel wanted, and the boy said, \"At least six figures.\"  Craig said he could never raise that much at once, so Gabriel said they could call it \"an allowance.\"  Craig, however, called it \"blackmail.\"\n\n\nParker walked into Al's, pleased that at last he had found Liberrty.  He sat with her and scolded her for being out of touch and pulling a disappearing act.  Liberty said she just wanted to do something \"normal,\" but Parker said she wasn't \"normal\" any more.  Liberty finally said she had to get away from Parker so that she could breathe.  They went outside and sat on a bench, and Liberty apologized, but again she asked Parker to back off and to give her some space.  \n\n\nShe gave him a kiss on the cheek, and she began to walk away. Parker sat alone for a while, and then got up and walked by Al's.  He looked in and saw Liberty back in there, and he started to join her again, but he stopped himself from hovering.  Liberty found Gabriel's phone number and left a message asking him if he wanted to \"hang out\" after his work.\n\n\nDusty asked a nurse to get him his clothes so he could leave the hospital.  The nurse explained that his old clothes were too bloody to salvage, so Janet had delivered him others.  Dusty asked the nurse to get the doctor so that he could leave as soon as possible, but she said that Dr. Oliver was out of town.  She did offer to get the physician on call, however, and she left the room.  Dusty jumped out of bed and grabbed his phone, but then he heard Rocco Ciccone's voice right outside the door, so Dusty threw his phone across the room and yelled that he couldn't remember how to dial a phone.\n\n\nRocco heard the commotion and told the nurse that he would return at a better time.  Dusty watched Janet's dad walk away and leave the hospital.  Rocco stood outside and called his crony, Ralph Manzo, to report that \"Donovan couldn't even figure out how to work his cell phone.\"  He ended by saying that Dusty was no threat to them, as Teri walked up behind her father and heard the word \"threat.\"\n\n\nJanet walked into Dusty's room and saw that he was almost fully dressed.  She said it was too soon for him to leave the hospital, but Dusty said he couldn't just stay there while people he loved were in danger.  Jack joined them and asked if Dusty had remembered anything about the shooting, but Dusty denied that.  He complained that he couldn't rest in the hospital, so Janet reluctantly agreed to talk to the on-call doctor.  After she left, Jack suggested that Dusty and Janet move into their new house right away, but Dusty said that Janet needed Jack, not him, right then.  Jack commented that Dusty wasn't acting like himself, and Dusty made Jack promise to look after Janet, Liberty, and the baby.\n\n\nJanet returned, and Jack said he didn't like her spending so much time at the hospital where people were in and out all the time.  Dusty agreed, and Janet reported that if Dusty's last tests were good, then he could leave the hospital.  She told Dusty that she had already hired movers to get her furniture out of storage and move it into the new house.  Dusty said he couldn't move in with her yet, but Janet objected that they were already a family.  Dusty was insistent that they not live together yet.\n\n\nCarly showed up at the hospital and found Jack in the hall talking to Margo on his phone.  The police were disappointed that forensics had gotten no clues from the surveillance tapes at Metro.  Carly told Jack that she had a long conversation with Parker about not becoming too invested in what was happening with Liberty, but he had told her to back off.  Carly complained that Jack was doing the same thing with Janet and Dusty.  She thought the cause was Jack's immense guilt over Brad's death, compounded by his guilt for not staying with Janet.  Suddenly Janet, in tears, ran out of Dusty's room, and Jack went after her.\n\n\nCarly went into Dusty's room and asked him \"what the hell\" he thought he was doing.  Dusty said he was just trying to get out of the hospital, but Carly wanted to talk to Dusty about the promise he had extracted from Jack.  Dusty wouldn't talk about it, and he asked to borrow Carly's phone so he could call his driver.  Carly handed it to him, and then she remarked that it was odd that suddenly Dusty had remembered how to dial a phone.  Dusty blamed the damage from the bullet in his skull, but Carly couldn't understand why Dusty wanted people to think that it was worse than it was.\n\n\nDusty admitted that he had told Jack that he didn't remember anything about the shooting, but that wasn't true.  He said he only remembered bits and pieces, and he did know that whoever did it was close to Janet's family.  He also thought the shooter was a professional hit man, perhaps ordered by Ralph Manzo or Janet's father.  Carly was horrified, and Dusty said he would be ready when whoever it was returned to finish the job.  In any case, it was too dangerous for Janet to get caught in the middle.  He said as soon as Janet was settled and safe, he would use himself as bait to lure the shooter out in the open.\n\n\nDusty ripped off the bandages from his neck, and Carly was still shocked that he was planning to use himself as a \"human target.\"  She said he could hardly expect her to keep her mouth shut about all that, but Dusty said the call was hers.  It was either to keep quiet and let Jack protect Janet, or Carly could blow the whistle and have Jack take on Ralph Manzo, or Rocco, and the rest of the mob.  Carly reasoned that Jack wouldn't be taking them on all by himself, but Dusty remarked that waiting for backup was not one of Jack's strong suits.  Carly promised not to tell Jack what Dusty was up to, but she asked him not to make her regret it.  Dusty asked one more favor of Carly by saying somebody had to \"bait the trap\" for him, and he wanted it to be her.\n\n\nJanet ran to Old Town and sat on a bench, and Jack tried to comfort her.  She demanded to know who had shot Dusty, just as Rocco walked out of the nearby bookstore.  Jack left to get the car so that he could drive Janet to Carly's.  Janet defended Jack to Rocco, and she said that the only reason Dusty was pushing her away was that he wanted to protect her.  A worried Rocco hugged his daughter.\n\n\nBack at Carly's, Janet asked everyone to stop hovering.  Rocco, Jack, and Carly were all there and watching her.  Carly said she had just seen the on-call doctor, and he had told her that he was still waiting for Dusty's test results.  Carly went to the kitchen to make Janet a sandwich, and Rocco followed her there.  He asked what the doctor had really said, so Carly dropped the bait and said that Dusty was really doing well, but he still didn't want to be a burden to Janet until he was fully recovered.  She said Dusty was probably leaving the hospital at that moment, and he had mentioned returning to Metro to begin \"getting his life back.\"  Carly added that Dusty could get his full memory back as soon as the swelling went down on his brain.  Rocco thought about that, and then he declared he was going to light a candle for Dusty, and he dashed out.\n\n\nJanet called the hospital and learned that Dusty had checked himself out.  She put on her coat, and that worried Carly.  If Rocco had taken the bait, then if Janet went to find Dusty, that would put her in jeopardy.  Carly questioned her about where she was going, but all Janet would say was that she wasn't going to look for Dusty.  Jack stood up to go with her, but then he looked at Carly and said he was \"doing it again.\"  He admitted that Carly was right about his being too involved with Janet and Dusty's lives.  Carly was concerned that letting Janet go out alone might be dangerous, but she loved having some alone time with Jack.\n\n\nDusty walked into Metro and turned on some lights.  He looked around, and then he went behind the bar to the safe.  He crouched down to open it, but he couldn't remember the combination.  Someone wearing a leather coat and carrying a gun slipped into the bar quietly.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty wants to leave the hospital and does what he can to get released. Janet worries about him, but Dusty is more interested on having Jack promise, on the sly, that he will look after Janet, because he is worried about her safety. Jack feels Dusty may know more, but he doesn't let on. Dusty tells Janet that he can't move in with her right now, as Janet runs off and Carly is irate to see Jack once again go after her. Carly confronts Dusty, as he admits to what is going on and enlists her help. Carly isn't sure at first, but then agrees to help him by using himself as bait. Carly later has a conversation with Rocco, Janet and Jack about Dusty, which causes Rocco to excuse himself quickly. Janet is unsure as to why, but Carly thinks she knows. Someone shows up with a gun at Metro, as Dusty is leaning down in front of the safe trying to remember the combination. Craig doesn't like Gabriel and continues to make his feelings known. Johnny tells his dad that Gabriel was the one trying to talk with him on the playground causing Craig to confront him. Gabriel shows his true feelings when he talks about what he knows about him stealing Parker's money; he blackmails Craig into giving him 6 or 7 figures out of it. Craig doesn't take kindly to this, but has no choice since Gabriel threatens to got to the police. Liberty pulls away from Parker, who doesn't know how to not hover over Liberty for fear that she will cause herself a relapse. Liberty and Gabriel connect at the diner and they share some laughs. He gives her his cell phone number to talk. Liberty and Parker later have a conversation on how she feels suffocated by Parker, as Parker agrees to heed her and his mom's advice and give her some space. Liberty later calls Gabriel and asks him if he wants to hang out after he gets off of work. Jack realizes he is spending too much time with Janet and ignoring Carly; he reminds her that she is his priority and promises she will always be first, as Carly is thrilled to hear that but is also preoccupied with Dusty's plan.",
