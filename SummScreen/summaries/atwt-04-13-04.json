    "tvmega_recap": "Henry called Katie and asked her to meet him at Metro. He told her that while the restraining order kept them from Pilar it did not keep them from Russ. He had found out Russ's name: Russell Terry and he has a criminal record in California: fraud and running con games. They went to Russ's hotel room and broke in. They didn't find anything but empty food containers and old newspapers. Henry left the room to watch for Russ's return. Russ walked into the room just as Katie found some papers. Meanwhile, Pilar made a play for Mike who rejected her. He said sleeping with him was not the way to fix her life. She said his life was just as messed up: he is in love with a married woman he can never have. Mike left to sleep at the lake. Pilar called Russ and left a message on his cell phone: since Mike cannot get Katie out of his mind \u0096 it was time to take her out of the picture. Doc hit on Margo who was flattered, but told him she was married. She told Jessica it was a kick to have an attractive man like Doc hit on her. Jessica told Margo she missed Sarah and Bonnie and wanted to have a baby. She told Margo not to mention anything to Ben because she hadn't told him about it yet. Molly wondered why Doc left his last job \u0096 he offered to tell her all about it over dinner. Lily returned to Chicago to get her phone and finally sing a song. The cafe owner thought she had a great set of pipes.",
