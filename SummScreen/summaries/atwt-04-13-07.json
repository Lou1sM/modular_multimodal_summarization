Emily decides to go look in the lobby to see if Susan's there, and while she's gone, Alison gets up and runs into Will, who's waiting for Gwen. Will is happy to see that Alison is back in town. When Alison starts reminiscing about how Will used to feel about him, he tells her he's married now, and she's surprised to hear Gwen is his wife, since their first date was such a disaster. Gwen walks up to find Alison and Will hugging, and when she greets Alison and asks about Aaron, Alison tells them she's not with Aaron anymore and that she's been living in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Gwen asks if she has a boyfriend now, and Alison says no and that since Will's taken, she'll have to look elsewhere. Emily walks up and tells Alison they need to go back to their table and wait for their mom. After they walk away, Will realizes from Gwen's comments that she's actually jealous of Alison. Will teases her a bit, and then they decide to go to Al's to get some breakfast. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Susan comes into the dining room and sees Emily, who tells her she has a surprise for her and points to Alison sitting at the table. Susan is happily surprised to see Alison, but when Alison claims to have returned to Oakdale to stay for a while, Susan says, \"Oh-oh, you must be in some kind of trouble!\" Ali reassures Susan that she's not in any trouble, and Susan suggests they go back to her house so she can make Ali's favorite breakfast of French toast. When they get there, Susan realizes she needs some eggs, and she asks Emily to go get some; the tea kettle whistles, and while Susan's gone tending to that, Alison tells Emily not to worry about her while she's gone, that she doesn't have any meth to use. Emily tells her she knows she doesn't, because she went through Ali's purse and suitcase the night before while Ali was sleeping. She then hands Alison a card and says she's made an appointment for her to go to a drug treatment center the next morning, and if she doesn't go, she'll tell their mom the whole story. Ali walks out of the room, complaining that Emily has gotten all frigid and probably hasn't had any sex in ages. Emily says to herself, \"If you only knew!\"\n\n\nAt the Wagon Wheel Motel, Jade comes to visit Cleo, bringing with her suitcases full of clothes and things for Cleo to use to learn to act like Gwen. Later, Jade quizzes Cleo on the people in Gwen's life, and Cleo does an excellent job of remembering all the important people in Gwen's life, except that she calls Rosanna \"Rowena.\" Jade is impressed by how much she already knows about Gwen, including the fact that she knew the names of Gwen's 2 nephews and her niece even though she doesn't remember telling Cleo what their names were; Cleo says she studied by herself last night. Jade says now they just need to fix Cleo's teeth and help her learn to talk like Gwen. To fix the teeth, Jade has brought a partial plate for Cleo to wear; to help her learn how to talk like Gwen, she's brought CDs to listen to that have Gwen singing and talking. When Cleo protests that she's starving, Jade says they can take a break for something to eat, but then she refuses to let Cleo go out with her, telling her she has to stay at the motel so no one will see her. Cleo asks what Gwen would eat, and Jade says that's a good question, and she doesn't know the answer. She leaves, and Cleo decides that maybe she can find out what Gwen would eat all by herself. Cleo goes to Al's, where she sees Gwen and Will sitting together. She sits down at the table next to them and listens to Gwen's order, then copies it when her waitress asks her what she wants to eat. After eavesdropping on Gwen and Will's conversation, about how much they mean to one another, Cleo drops her notebook intentionally, and while bending down to pick it up, she stares at Will, who notices her and stares back. Jade returns to the Wagon Wheel with some food for Cleo, but she quickly realizes Cleo's not there.\n\n\nKatie and Jack look for Henry in Old Town but don't find him, even though he spots them and hears them talking about him and Vienna. Jack thinks Henry ought to feel bad after what he did to Vienna, calling off the wedding in the middle of the ceremony; Katie thinks it's Vienna's fault for rushing things and for not seeing the signs that Henry wasn't ready for marriage. Meanwhile, at Emma's, Brad and Emma come into the kitchen only to find Vienna hiding under the kitchen table, drinking wine, which she has apparently been doing all night long. Upset, she says she should have listened to Brad when he said the marriage was a bad idea, then she grabs the cake knife and slashes at her wedding cake, destroying it in the process. Emma calls Jack and says Vienna's very upset and has a cake knife, and she wants Jack to come over to help calm her down. Jack tells Katie he has to go, and Katie ends up following him there. When they arrive, Brad says he's already gotten Vienna calmed down, and Jack and Katie ask him to go to Old Town and try to find Henry for them. He doesn't want to go, but Jack points out that the alternative is having to listen to Vienna's bouts of hysteria. Brad leaves, and Jack and Katie go inside, where Vienna erupts in anger the moment she sees Katie. She tells Katie that she's the problem, saying she's ruined her life. Jack tries to calm Vienna down, but Katie says if it helps Vienna to attack her, to go right ahead --- so Vienna literally tries to attack Katie. Jack stops her, and Vienna sobs, saying she's attacking Katie because she's the closest thing to Henry, and Henry's not there; Katie again says it's okay, she understands that, and Vienna then rushes at Katie again, this time cutting her cheek. Seeing what she's done, Vienna breaks down and apologizes, saying she knows it's not Katie's fault that she's the only woman Henry will ever truly love. Emma takes Vienna out of the room, and Katie wonders aloud to Jack if perhaps Vienna is right, that once a person loses their true love, they never get a relationship right again. She tells Jack she doesn't want to believe that, that she wants to believe that you can find a place in your heart for someone else. She asks Jack, \"Don't you want to believe that? Don't you want to have that hope?\" In response, Jack kisses Katie.\n\n\nBack in Old Town, Henry realizes Brad is looking for him, and he ducks into a store to hide, but one of his cufflinks falls onto the bench he was sitting on. Brad sits down and finds the cufflink; pocketing it, he walks away, but when Henry walks out of the store, Brad grabs him. He tells Henry he has to come back and face the music with Vienna, but Henry tries to tell Brad it would only hurt Vienna more if he did that. He thinks it would be best if everyone thought he had left town for good. Brad says he's not Henry's messenger, but Henry says with him out of the picture, Brad can make a play for Vienna himself. Henry walks away, leaving Brad standing there by himself.\n\n\n\n\n",
