    "soap_central": "\n\nCraig accompanied Carly to her hotel room in New York, and she planted a big kiss on him to say thank you for the trip and Liberty's internship. Craig suggested a nightcap, and he opened a bottle of champagne. He toasted to a long, slow, romantic New York evening. They drank their bubbly and relaxed, and Craig gave Carly a neck rub. He easily talked her into a romantic romp, which they began until a knock on the door interrupted them. \n\n\nCarly opened the door and was stunned to find Parker there. Parker spied Craig on the bed and then told Carly that Jack had bought him a plane ticket so that Parker could figure out what was going on with Liberty. He needed to straighten out the living arrangements for her next year's internship. \n\n\nCraig explained that Liberty was at a party for the interns, sponsored by the magazine. Soon they heard Liberty laughing out in the hall, so Parker went out and Liberty introduced him to Colin, her summer boss. Colin was shocked that Liberty was married, a fact that Parker immediately established, but Colin did not think there was any rule against having married interns. Colin left, and Parker lit into Liberty for not telling her work associate that she was married. He had no interest in Liberty's excitement, and accused his mother and Craig of setting up the whole housing problem. \n\n\nThat same night, Lily worked at Worldwide and spoke by phone to Holden, in Louisville. After she hung up, Lily heard someone enter the outer office, and it frightened her. She picked up a sharp letter opener and threw open the door to find Damian on the other side. He wanted to speak with her about the foundation, so he could figure out who was behind the attacks on Luke. \n\n\nLily refused to give him any information, so Damian had to be content just to check out the file drawer where the missing discs had been stored. He made Lily uneasy, so she threw him out, and when she went to close the file drawer, she discovered a ring with the initial \"G\" on it, similar to a Grimaldi family one that Damian had. \n\n\nLuke and Noah were at Lily's, and they hugged and kissed and were looking forward to watching a movie when someone rang the doorbell. In walked Zac and Zoe, who wanted to party. The weird twins begged for forgiveness and brought out a bottle of Green Fairy absinthe. Both Luke and Noah declined the liqueur, and Noah suggested that the \"Z's\" take the party anywhere else but there. \n\n\nZac declared it was time for \"Plan Z,\" and Zoe got out a Ouija board. She suggested that they ask the board who was messing with the foundation. She and Luke sat at a low table and set up the board. \n\n\nZoe called on the spirits and told them she was with Luke. The pointer immediately spelled out, \"HE IS GAY,\" and they both had a good laugh. Next Zoe asked who was sabotaging the foundation, but the pointer did not respond. Zoe asked if the spirits would prefer to speak with someone else, and it spelled out, \"L G.\" Everyone appeared confused until Luke announced that his birth name was Luciano Grimaldi. \n\n\nSuddenly, Zac got sick and made a dash for the bathroom. Zoe asked to see the kitchen, so she could find some fresh fruit and blend some up to quiet Zac's stomach. She headed to the kitchen, and Noah asked Luke if they could please send the Zs on their way. Suddenly all the lights in the house went out, and Zoe screamed. \n\n\nDamian met with Lisa at the Lakeview, and they caught up. Lisa was the widow of Eduardo Grimaldi, Damian's cousin, and she was fond of Damian, but she chewed him out for his behavior with Luke the last time he had come to Oakdale. Damian said he was there to make amends, and Lisa said she had some of Eduardo's belongings, photos and letters, that might be of interest to Damian. Some of the things she could not even identify, and she offered them to him. Damian invited her for dinner, but Lisa had a previous engagement. \n\n\nIn the dark, Zoe returned to Luke and Noah and said she had plugged in a blender and thought she had blown the circuit breaker. Zac had not returned from the bathroom, so Zoe began calling for him. Meanwhile, Zac was in Luke's bedroom, going through papers in his desk with a flashlight. Zoe and Luke lit candles, and Zoe suggested that the candles might bring dead Grimaldis circling. \n\n\nNoah took a candle and located Zac, minus his shirt, in Luke's room. Noah asked Zac what he was doing, and Zac replied that he was visualizing Noah without his preppy clothes. Noah scolded him and told him to put on his shirt. He warned Zac never to pull a stunt like that again, and he walked out. \n\n\nIn the hotel, Damian opened his door to find Lily holding the Grimaldi ring. He appeared surprised and showed her how the ring was much too small to fit on his finger. He also said his ring was back home in Malta, so someone else had left one in Lily's files. He suggested they pool their resources to discover if there was another Grimaldi in town. \n\n\nIn New York, Craig pulled Parker and Liberty into Carly's room and told Parker he was way out of line for accusing Craig of trying to break up the teens' marriage. He also explained how interns functioned as a team, which was why they all roomed together. Parker said he didn't care and was especially rude to Carly, who tried to calm her son. Finally Craig advised the boy to be more respectful to his mother. \n\n\nParker called Carly a \"gross, disgusting drunk,\" and it obviously hurt her deeply. Craig told the boy to apologize, but Parker was furious. Liberty dashed out, yelling at Parker that it was not just his marriage at stake. Parker ran after her, and Carly tried to follow, but Craig advised her not to. \n\n\nOutside Liberty's room, Parker tired to persuade her to let him in, but she told him to go away. Liberty finally let him in and defended her attending the interns' party. She told him how difficult it was for her to be brave and go forth in the Big Apple. She badly wanted to be more than she was, but Parker was hung up on parties. \n\n\nThey argued until Parker asked if the internship meant more to Liberty than their marriage. Liberty did not want to have to choose, and she reminded Parker that he could come to New York whenever he wanted. Parker said she did not love him and did not want to be married to him anymore. \n\n\nLiberty insisted that she had never said she did not want to be married, and she advised Parker to chill out. He apologized to her and said she was the only part of his life that was not totally in shambles. He was afraid he would lose her, but Liberty promised that would not happen. She reconsidered the internship in New York and offered to get one closer to home. The newlyweds hugged. \n\n\nBack in her room, Carly staggered to the champagne bottle, but Craig stopped her. He hustled her into the bathroom to sober her up. \n\n\nAt Lily and Holden's, the lights came back as soon as Luke fixed the circuit breaker. Zoe flirted with Luke, but he pushed her away. Noah and Zac returned and the Zs took the hint that the boys wanted them to leave. \n\n\nLily shared with Damian that Noah remembered part of the computer hacker's name: PESC1...plus more numbers. Damian informed her that \"pesc\" was part of \"fish\" in Italian, and he suggested that \"something fishy\" was going on. Lily cracked up laughing, but then she moved away from Damian and declared that she had to leave. Damian insisted that he see her home, even if it angered Holden. Lily explained that Holden was out of town, but Luke was there. \n\n\nCarly, wearing a hotel robe, came back into her room and told Craig she would never forget what Parker had said to her about her drinking. She said she wanted to stop drinking, so Craig agreed. He said they were \"in this together,\" so he would quit, as well. Craig went to check on Parker, who told Craig that Carly's plan had not worked because Liberty was turning down the New York internship. \n\n\nLuke and Noah discussed the Z twins. Noah no longer felt they were harmless, but Luke called them \"just weird kids.\" Lily brought Damian home then and told Luke about the Grimaldi ring she had found. Lily asked if Luke thought there might be another Grimaldi in Oakdale who was behind the attacks. Luke thought that made no sense, so Damian took the hint and said goodbye to Lily. Luke said he needed proof, and Noah accused him of being too closed-minded. Noah left to study, saying, \"Ciao, Luciano.\" \n\n\nNoah found Damian in the Lakeview and said he believed him. He offered to help Damian catch whoever was behind the foundation's problems. Noah though the numeral 1 in the hacker's name could possibly have been an \"I\" instead, which led them to Pisces, the zodiac sign of the fish. Damian said he was grateful that Luke and Noah had found each other. \n\n\nNoah left the hotel and spotted Zac and Zoe finishing the bottle of green liqueur on a bench in Old Town. Noah looked closely at the pendants around the twins' necks, and he commented on the embossed fish he saw. Zoe said it represented Pisces, and Zac asked Noah what his sign was. Noah revealed that the hacker's name could have been something similar, and both twins burst out laughing that Noah had caught them. Yes, they admitted, they were totally trying to wreck Luke's foundation. Noah knew they were joking when Zac told him to get over himself. \n\n\nCraig told Carly that Parker was all right, and he suggested that they get some sleep. Craig had his own room, but he asked to hold Carly for a while in her bed. They lay down together on the bed, and Craig assured her everything would be all right.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Carly and Craig share more alcohol, as they are happy with how things are working out; their night is interrupted by Parker, who has flown there to see Liberty, thanks to Jack. Parker is none to happy to hear Liberty is at a party. When Liberty comes home with her new young boss, Colin, in tow, Parker is angry and lashes out at Carly and Craig mostly but also at Liberty. Parker hurls insults at his mother, who he spits has become an alcoholic. Liberty storms out and Parker goes after her. Carly is hurt, as Craig tries to comfort her. Parker and Liberty fight about her internship and moving to NY without him. Parker is sure Liberty is no longer in love with him and wants to get away from him. Liberty tries to make him understand and finally tells him that she thinks she will just pass on the internship and find something closer to home. Parker is thrilled Liberty chose him, as he sees it. Craig forces Carly to sober up and then offers to talk with Parker when Carly wants to. Craig learns from a smug Parker that they didn't win, and he and Liberty are staying together; he even tells Craig that Liberty is passing on the internship too. Craig chooses not to tell a distraught looking Carly of the new events when Carly is sure Parker hates her. Craig offers to hold Carly to comfort her, as Carly lets him. Damian appeals to Lily that he isn't the one sabotaging the Foundation. Lily still doesn't believe him, and is even more convinced of his guilt when she finds a Grimaldi ring in the drawer where the disks disappeared. She confronts Damian, who proves it isn't his, since the ring is way too small, but he thinks someone else from his family might be involved. Lily seems to be wondering if he might be true. They start to go over the evidence, as Damian wonders about the partial username that Noah remembered \u0096 PESC1. Damian takes Lily home where he sees Luke, who is not pleased to see him and is still adamant that he is the guilty party. Luke is also not happy to see that both Lily and Noah appear to believe Damian now. Lily wants him to know they are all on the same side, but Luke doesn't think they are. Luke and Noah have another strange run in with Zac and Zoe. Zoe wants to use the Ouija Board to talk to the spirits about who is trying to destroy the Foundation. The initials LG appear when Zoe asks who the spirits want to talk with and Luke admits that is his true initials, but he doesn't want to get more involved. The lights go out, and Noah goes looking for Zac, who has been snooping in Luke's room; he finds him waiting for him without a shirt. Zac comes onto Noah, who again turns him down. Zoe flirts with Luke, who turns her down. Noah is starting to dislike Zac and Zoe and worries that they can't be trusted, but Luke thinks they are harmless. Later, after Noah offers Damian his support in finding who is trying to sabotage the Foundation, and they realize the username may be Pisces, Noah sees Zac and Zoe wearing matching Pisces necklaces and confronts them on it. They react in such a dramatic way that Noah thinks he might be reaching, but he still ultimately looks like he is unsure about them.",
