    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt home, Carly was nervous about Dusty's plan, and she kept checking her phone.  Jack noticed, and he was suspicious that Carly wasn't telling him everything.  Parker arrived home and he was upset with Liberty because she had a chemo treatment later that day, but she was hanging out at Al's \"as if it was no big deal.\"  Jack suggested that Parker was trying too hard to help, and then he chuckled and admitted that, according to Carly, he was guilty of the same crime.  Carly added that Liberty was a smart girl, and she wouldn't do anything that was detrimental to her health.\n\n\nJack saw that everyone was stir crazy, so he suggested that they take a picnic out to the lake, but neither Carly nor Parker was in the mood.  Carly still denied that anything was going on, and she half-heartedly offered to make a picnic lunch for them at home.  Parker couldn't stand it, however, and he said he could not keep his distance from Liberty, and he walked out.  Jack finally pleaded with Carly to tell him what was going on with Dusty, but she got upset and blurted out that Jack should \"let somebody else --\"and then she stopped.\n\n\nJack asked her to please talk with him, and Carly finally said that she had helped Dusty get out of Memorial so that he could smoke out and catch whoever had shot him.  Jack bellowed and demanded to know where Dusty had gone, and Carly admitted that it was to Metro.\n\n\nJanet ran into Liberty outside Fashions and asked what her daughter was doing there.  Liberty said she remembered that she had a chemo appointment a bit later, but she enjoyed looking at the clothes in the store windows and forgetting for a minute or two that she had cancer.  The two of them sat at a table, and Janet said that Dusty had checked himself out of the hospital without telling her.  Janet left, as Liberty picked up her phone and left another message for Gabriel.\n\n\nAt Monte Carlo, Craig arrived and found Gabriel sitting in Craig's chair with his feet on the desk.  The boy asked for his \"allowance\" money, but Craig ordered him to get up.  Craig said he didn't have the money for Gabriel, but Gabriel demanded the first chunk of his million-dollar blackmail by the end of the day.  Craig threatened that if Gabriel ever went near Johnny again, Craig would kill him. He picked the boy up by the lapels and told him to get out, but Gabriel said he still had to fix the light.  \"So do it,\" roared Craig, and he stormed out.\n\n\nGabriel returned Liberty's call shortly, and he said he would like to \"hang\" with her for a while.  He picked an odd place for them to meet, but Liberty agreed. Then Janet returned to where Liberty was sitting and asked her daughter to go shopping with her, but the girl fibbed and said she was meeting Parker at the hospital.\n\n\nCraig went to the Lakeview to meet Ellis, his finance man.  He complained that the \"screwdriver jockey\" was blackmailing him, and he reminded Ellis that if Craig went down, Ellis went with him because of the fake books Ellis was cooking for Carly's benefit.  Ellis claimed no knowledge of any second set of books, so Craig reminded him that they had talked on the phone and discussed it.  Ellis said he had lost his cell phone, right after Gabriel had spilled coffee all over him on the street, and Craig realized that Gabriel had stolen the phone.  Craig then assumed that he had been talking to Gabriel instead of Ellis about dangerous matters.\n\n\nCraig suggested they find out everything they could about the \"punk\" so that they could shut him down.  Craig declared that Parker's trust fund was not a \"bottomless pit,\" just as Parker walked up behind Craig and overheard.  \"Is there a problem with my trust fund?\" Parker asked.  Craig asked to speak to Parker alone, so Ellis stepped away.  Parker repeated his question, but Craig reassured the boy that there was no problem; he and Ellis had been discussing outrageous bank fees.  He convinced Parker that the money would always be available if Parker needed it for Liberty.  Parker was appeased, and he walked away.\n\n\nEllis returned with an envelope full of money for Craig.  Craig moaned that he needed the money for Monte Carlo, Parker needed some for Liberty, but instead he had to pay off the handyman.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Gabriel went to an expensive car dealership and checked out flashy convertibles.  Liberty joined him there, and wondered why Gabriel had picked such an odd spot to rendezvous.  Gabriel sat in a car, but a salesman made him get out and told the \"kids\" to move on.  Gabriel protested that he was thinking of buying the car, but the salesman scoffed until the boy took out a huge roll of money from his pocket.  Liberty asked where Gabriel had gotten all the money, and he answered that he had saved his \"odd job\" money for years.  Gabriel had Liberty sit in the passenger seat, and he got behind the wheel.  He teased her that at least she didn't have to worry about having her hair blow, and Liberty laughed.  Suddenly Liberty noticed the time, and she said she needed to go to the hospital for her treatment.  Gabriel offered to take a \"test drive\" there with her.\n\n\nIn Metro, Dusty was frustrated that he couldn't remember the combination to the safe, so he began looking for it in the cash register.  His original assailant crept into the foyer and cocked his pistol.  Suddenly, Rocco Ciccone grabbed the man from behind with one arm and covered his mouth with the other to keep him quiet.  Rocco said quietly that the thug should leave, but they made a bit of noise that made Dusty call out, \"Who's there?\"  Suddenly Dusty heard glass breaking up the stairs behind the bar, so he went up there.  Rocco held the shooter at gunpoint and told him he was not to touch Dusty.  He sent the man on his way, but Rocco kept the gun.\n\n\nRocco walked into Metro, still holding the revolver, and Dusty got behind him and said he knew it was Rocco.  Dusty accused him of hiring a hit man who had botched the job, so he assumed Rocco was there to finish it.  Rocco said that Dusty was wrong, and that he wasn't there to hurt Dusty.  He claimed he had taken the gun \"off some guy\" who was there to shoot Dusty.  Dusty didn't buy that, and he yelled that if Rocco hadn't shot him earlier, then he'd had \"Uncle Ralphie\" do it.  Rocco told Dusty to shut up and listen, but Dusty made a grab for the gun and turned it on Rocco, just as Jack and Janet ran in.\n\n\nJanet screamed at Dusty to let her father go, but Dusty yelled that Rocco had not turned into a loving, concerned father; he was still the \"same sick bastard\" who had kicked Janet out when she was pregnant.  Janet pleaded with Dusty to free her father, so Dusty let him go.  Rocco tried to explain to his daughter, but suddenly he clutched his chest and collapsed.  Janet yelled at him, but she got no response or pulse.  Jack and Carly walked in then, and Jack ran to Rocco and found a faint pulse.  Carly called 9-1-1, as Jack began CPR.\n\n\nThey all followed the ambulance to Memorial, and the EMTs wheeled Rocco away quickly.  Janet yelled at Dusty for beating up on an old man with a bad heart, and Dusty said he was very sorry.  Jack said it would be a while before they heard much about Rocco, so he suggested that Janet go down a floor to where Liberty took her treatments and check on the girl.  He promised to get her if there was any word on her father, so Janet agreed and left.\n\n\nJack lit into Dusty as soon as Janet left, and he demanded to know what Dusty had been trying to do.  Dusty said he had not been thinking straight, but that infuriated Jack even more.  He said that he didn't want Dusty anywhere near Janet or his kid.  Carly intervened and told Jack that he wasn't being fair to Dusty.  Jack shouted that Dusty had plenty of opportunities to tell Jack that he had remembered the shooting, but instead, Dusty had chosen to involve Carly in his scheme.  Then Jack took a call from the station and told Carly and Dusty that the cops had just looked at tapes of the latest incident at Metro, and they had seen someone with a gun creep in behind Dusty.  After that, Rocco appeared to disarm the man and send him packing.\n\n\nJanet went to the chemotherapy area and found Parker waiting, but no Liberty. Janet railed at the boy for letting her daughter miss her appointment and scolded him for \"not being on top of things.\"  Liberty and Gabriel walked in, and Janet blasted her daughter for being late.  Parker asked what Gabriel was doing there, and Liberty said he had given her a ride. Gabriel left, but Janet continued to harangue Liberty, and said that she didn't appreciate Liberty's lie about meeting Parker for the appointment.  Parker started to walk out in disgust, but Liberty asked him to stay.  They went into the chemo room, and he got ice for her and apologized for having a \"downer\" attitude recently.\n\n\nThen Parker said he hoped that when Liberty got well, the two of them could be more than friends.  Liberty said she thought that Parker was just unhappy because she had arrived with Gabriel, but Parker denied that.  He said he thought that if Liberty was comfortable hooking up with another guy, then he could talk to her about the two of them.  Liberty said Gabriel had only asked her to meet him at a car dealership, and then Parker let it slip that he still loved her, and always had.  Liberty was shocked, and she explained that being friends was the best she could do with anybody with what she was facing.  Parker thought about that and went to get more ice.\n\n\nJanet returned upstairs, and Dusty was stunned to tell her that Rocco had saved his life.  She asked him why he had gone to Metro in the first place, and then she wanted to know why he thought Rocco would shoot him.  Dusty said he had a plan, but it hadn't worked out.  Janet called herself a \"fool\" for buying Dusty's act, but he said it wasn't all an act.  He explained that he had enlisted Carly's help, and Janet was furious.  She told Dusty that because of him, her father might die.\n\n\nCarly spoke to Janet and defended Dusty, but Jack made her leave so that Janet and Dusty could talk alone.  Janet asked why Dusty even suspected Rocco, and Dusty told her about the argument he had with her father in front of the house Dusty was buying.  He said that Rocco was drunk, and had said how much he hated Dusty. Then a few hours later, the shooter had shown up at Metro.  He figured that Rocco had asked Ralph Manzo to send someone to kill him.  Janet was upset that Dusty had not told her about that argument, and he apologized and said how much he loved her.  Janet said she was very fearful for any future for them, and she walked away.\n\n\nJack looked at Carly and said he didn't understand her at all.  He couldn't figure out why she had gone along with Dusty, until it dawned on him that she was protecting him from a confrontation with Ralph's mob.\n\n\nCraig finally returned to Monte Carlo and handed Gabriel his first installment of the blackmail money.  The boy said it would work nicely for the hot sports car he'd been checking out.  Craig said that for the moment Gabriel had the upper hand, but that always changed.  Craig promised that he was going to make the boy very sorry he had ever crossed Craig.  Gabriel asked if that would be like Craig's son, Bryant, was sorry that he had Craig for a dad.  Craig was speechless that, once again, Gabriel had personal information about his life.\n\n\nCraig asked what Gabriel knew about Bryant, and the boy said he had known Craig's deceased son in Miami.  Gabriel said Bryant had helped him with his soccer game when Gabriel was just a kid.  He said he had loved Bryant, and he had chosen to visit Oakdale to pay his respects to the young man's grave.  It was at the cemetery that Gabriel had first seen Craig, and he had begun to do some Internet searches about him.  He had found out that Craig had pirated Bryant's trust fund, too.  Craig was very angry, so Gabriel explained how he had protected himself by having a friend lined up to send emails to Parker, Carly, Jack the cop, and Margo if anything happened to him.  Gabriel ranted that his friend Bryant would still be alive if it weren't for Craig.  He thanked Craig for the \"Benjamins,\" and he ended by saying, \"Keep 'em comin'!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liberty arrives late to her treatment in a fancy sports car driven by Gabriel because he took the car for a test drive. Gabriel intends to buy the car with the money Craig is going to give him to keep quiet about Craig using Parker's trust fund to fund Monte Carlo. Parker is jealous of Gabriel's closeness with Liberty and admits to her that he has always loved her and wants to be more than friends. Liberty tells Parker that she can't think of being anything more than friends right now. Gabriel tells Craig that Brian was a friend of his and he is blackmailing him because he deserves it for causing Brian's death. Parker asks Craig questions about his trust fund but Craig assures him that the trust fund is fine and will be available for him when he needs to use the money. Rocco takes the gun away from the hitman Ralph hired to kill Dusty and tells the hit man that he doesn't need his services anymore. When Rocco goes inside Metro with a gun, Dusty thinks he is the man trying to kill him, so they fight each other until Rocco has a heart attack. Rocco is rushed to the hospital where Dusty tells Janet everything and apologizes to her for lying to her and thinking that Rocco wanted to kill him. Janet is angry with Dusty and doesn't know if she can forgive him. Jack is also upset with Carly for helping Dusty with his plan but eventually forgives her. Jack tells Dusty that the surveillance tape at Metro shows that Rocco took the gun away from the hit man, so Dusty is grateful that Rocco saved his life.",
