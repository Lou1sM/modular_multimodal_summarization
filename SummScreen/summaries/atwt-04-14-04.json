    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica asked if Ben wanted to stay for a recap at the Lakeview. She finally told him she wanted to have a baby.

If everything was okay \u0096 they could discuss having a baby again. Carly told Jack about Barbara's job offer \u0096 he wondered if it was a legit offer. Carly said she was willing to take her chances. He said he would support any decision she made. Walker asked Barbara to get treatment for her tumor. Barbara again told him she couldn't do that just yet. Carly arrived as Walker left Barbara's in a huff. Carly told Barbara she would work at BRO. She was trying to show Barbara her sketches, but Barbara had another attack. She tried to get Carly to leave \u0096 but Carly knew something was up. Pilar was upset with Mike. She asked him to see Russ and talk to him. She thought if Mike told Russ they were lovers \u0096 Russ might finally leave her alone. Mike agreed to talk to Russ \u0096 but only as a friend. Katie hit Russ with her bat and he cried. He said Pilar had a plan for Mike, but if Katie wanted to know about the plan he wanted immunity and money. She hit him again and then pulled his hair. Finally Russ told her that Pilar planned to kill Mike. Just as Mike was getting ready to go talk to Russ \u0096 Katie arrived and told him Pilar was setting him up.",
