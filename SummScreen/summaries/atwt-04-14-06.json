Dusty tries to tell Emily that Paul is setting her up for his murder, but Emily angrily tells Dusty he has no idea what he's talking about. Emily tapes his mouth shut again after chaining him back to his chair, and she leaves. \n\n\nMike tells Katie that since her book has been published, it's possible the woman who gave him the suitcase full of rubies years ago (or an accomplice of hers) will show up now, looking for them. He tells her he put them in a wall in Carly and Jack's house, which is where he lived as a kid. He wants to go to the police with what he knows. Katie suggests that instead, he go to Carly's house and dig up the jewels, then repair the wall, and give the jewels to the police with an anonymous note saying they need to be returned to their rightful owner. Mike doesn't want Katie to be involved in this, but she insists, and together, they go to Carly's house. \n\n\nAs Jack and Carly are about to kiss, Sage drops the valve that Carly took off the hot water heater, and when Jack finds it, he realizes that Carly set up the \"accident\" just to get him over to the house. Carly tells Jack that he's the only one who knows how hard she's fought to get to this point where she has a family and a man whom she loves do much, and she tells him it wasn't a lie when she said \"forever\" on their wedding day. Jack says things have changed, but Carly tells him if he keeps pushing, he'll ultimately push too far, and there will be no going back, and she asks him if that's what he really wants. He tells her it's too late, that they've both been pushed too far, and he asks her to please sign the separation papers; then he takes Sage to have her spend the night with him at Emma's. Carly breaks down after they leave, and Katie shows up, asking if she can come in. Carly tells her no and closes the door in her face. Katie persists and gets Carly to agree to go have coffee with her because it concerns Mike; after they leave, Mike goes into the house and down to the basement, where he begins tearing up the wall. Katie invites Carly to the wedding for Mike's sake; Carly agrees to go but angrily tells Katie that she will never be her friend, that because of what she did, Jack has left her. Katie tells Carly that she and Jack will get back together one day, but Carly tells her that what Katie broke can't be fixed. She tells Katie never to come to her house again and rushes out, with Katie following after she fails to reach Mike on his cell phone. When they get to Carly's place, Katie tries to distract her by apologizing for having caused her so much trouble in her marriage, but Carly hears a pounding noise from downstairs and wonders what it is. In the basement, Mike, oblivious to their return, has broken through the wall and found a body.\n\n\nMeg puts the brakes on Paul's sexual advances but admits she has trouble resisting him. He tells her why he likes her, and she reciprocates, and then he tells her that although it's the last thing he saw coming, he has fallen in love with her. She says she has fallen in love with him, too. Paul warns Meg that Emily really has it out for her and says he'll protect her at all costs. Meg says they both need to look out for each other. \n\n\nEmily meets up with Henry and tells him she needs him to help her get rid of Meg, but she assures him that Meg won't be hurt or killed if Henry helps her with her plan. She then gives Henry a bag (which unbeknownst to Henry contains Dusty's bloody clothing) and has him break into Meg's car and put the bag in it, then call Meg and ask her to meet him at the old mill, because he needs to warn her about what Emily is planning. Meg agrees to meet Henry at the mill, but on her way there, she is pulled over by the police. An officer tells Meg someone called and reported she was driving erratically; he ultimately searches her car, with her permission, and after finding the bag of bloody clothes, he arrests her and takes her to the police station.\n\n\nPaul leaves Meg and goes to the police station, where he tells Jack he needs to get a restraining order against Meg. Jack figures out that that means either Paul has decided Emily is more useful to him now or Emily is jealous and Paul is trying to convince her that he's not involved with Meg, even though everyone else can clearly see that he is. Jack gives Paul the restraining order anyway, saying the best thing for Meg right now would be to be forced to stay away from Paul. Emily arrives at the police station to check on Paul and the restraining order, and she is kissing Paul when the cops bring Meg into the station in handcuffs. Paul says he'll go find out what's up, but Emily tells him not to worry about it.\n\n\n",
