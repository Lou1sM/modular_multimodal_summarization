Sofie commended Paul on bringing Barbara to his house to take care of her after her surgery. Paul admitted that the \"old Paul\" probably wouldn't have stepped up to look after his mother, but the new and improved Paul wanted to help any way he could. Sofie commented that Meg must have brought on Paul's new attitude. As they talked, Aaron phoned to check up on Sofie and she thanked him for the call, but quickly hung up on him to return to her discussion with Paul. Aaron was frustrated that Sofie had dismissed him so hastily and suspected something was going on between Paul and Sofie. \n\n\nOut at the Snyder farm, Mike arrived to speak with Meg about the farm's project he was supervising. Meg noticed Mike wasn't his usual happy self and asked if he was all right. Mike confided in Meg that he couldn't believe Katie was getting married and he was surprised at how much it bothered him. Meg and Mike talked about their shared experiences with failed relationships: Meg with Paul, and Mike with Katie. Mike was torn about whether he should pursue Katie or let her marry Brad without telling her he still loved her. Mike admitted to Meg that he wasn't going to let Katie go, but he didn't know how to win her back. He thanked Meg for listening and returned to the project. \n\n\nAs Mike left, Aaron arrived home and told Meg that he had just hung up with Sofie and she had \"blown him off\" for Paul. He asked Meg if she thought there was anything romantic going on between Sofie and Paul, and Meg decided to find out for herself and called Paul. Once she got hold of him, Meg invited Paul and Sofie to the farm for lunch and he happily accepted the invitation. \n\n\nKatie arrived at Margo's house to tell her that she and Brad were going to be married by the end of the week. Margo was unhappy that the ceremony was being moved up and advised her sister not to rush down the aisle with Brad without talking to Mike and working through their unresolved issues. Katie said she had talked to Mike and insisted he had nothing to do with the new wedding date. Margo begrudgingly agreed to support her sister and helped her get ready for the ceremony. \n\n\nMargo took Katie to Lisa's store, Fashions, to look for a wedding dress and Lisa was shocked that Katie was marrying Brad in such a hurry. Lisa quickly shoved Margo and Katie into a dressing room to try on some wedding gowns and immediately phoned Mike to get him over to Fashions. Lisa convinced Mike that she had an emergency at the store, but her plan was to get Mike and Katie back together. Lisa kept Katie and Margo busy trying on numerous wedding dresses and waited for Mike's arrival. \n\n\nPaul and Sofie arrived at the farm for their lunch date and ran into Mike as he was leaving for Lisa's store. Mike had gone inside to tell Meg he was leaving for a short while, but Paul was noticeably worried by finding Mike alone with Meg once again. Mike insisted he was just at the farm to make sure the job was running smoothly and he left after telling Meg he would return soon. \n\n\nMeg, Paul, and Sofie prepared for lunch as Aaron returned to the kitchen. Sofie was surprised to see Aaron and asked if he was the one who had invited her. He insisted it was Meg's idea and said he was just there babysitting his brother, Ethan. Aaron asked Sofie if she would help with the baby and she agreed. Alone in the kitchen, Paul remarked that he knew what Meg was up to. Meg questioned what Paul meant and he told her that he thought she was trying to push Aaron and Sofie together. Meg admitted that she had planned the lunch so the two could see one another, but didn't see anything wrong with a little matchmaking. Aaron came in holding Ethan and offered to let Sofie hold him, but Sofie became upset and ran from the kitchen. Aaron chased after her, leaving Meg and Paul to put the toddler down for a nap. \n\n\nPaul told Meg that he was concerned about Sofie and wanted to check on her, but Meg reminded him that he had just told her to stay out of Aaron and Sofie's relationship, and he should take his own advice. Paul agreed. Meg asked Paul to join her on a walk with Ethan after his nap, but Paul had a better idea. They took Ethan to the Lakeview for lunch and when they allowed Ethan out of his high chair for a few minutes, the toddler walked away. Once they realized Ethan was gone, Meg and Paul became frantic and began to search for him. At the front desk, Meg and Paul learned that Ethan was trapped in the hotel's elevator and they could see him on the hotel's security camera. Meg began to freak out as they waited for the fire department, so Paul decided to take on Ethan's rescue. Meg watched the security monitor, as Paul jumped into the elevator from an upper floor and saved Ethan. Paul returned to the lobby with Ethan and Meg thanked him for his bravery with a kiss. \n\n\nAaron caught up with Sofie and apologized for asking her to hold Ethan and she told him that it was still too hard to hold any child. She said she just wanted to return to Fairwinds, care for Barbara, and be on her own. Aaron told her he couldn't let her hide from her life out at Paul's mansion. He said she needed to deal with the pain of giving Hallie up for adoption and offered to help her. She agreed and they returned together to the farm where they enjoyed a picnic together. \n\n\nBrad found Henry in his hotel room and told him that he and Katie had finally set the date. Brad asked Henry to be his best man and Henry accepted. When Henry learned that the wedding had been moved up to the end of the week, he congratulated Brad on moving quickly so that Mike didn't have time to win Katie back. Brad refused to believe that Mike was a factor in Katie agreeing to marry him so quickly. Henry relented and began to help Brad find a tuxedo on short notice. \n\n\nAfter Brad and Henry finished meeting with a tailor, they went over to Al's Diner for lunch. Once there, Brad began to get curious if Katie had found the perfect dress and decided to rush over to Fashions to check on Katie's progress. Henry insisted it was bad luck to see the bride in her gown and tried to stop him, but Brad was determined to see Katie. \n\n\nBack at the store, Lisa tried to convince Katie to postpone her wedding until she could plan the perfect day, but Katie was adamant that she loved Brad and wanted to marry him right away. Lisa began to have a coughing fit and sent Margo out to get her water. With Margo gone, Lisa recovered from her fake coughing attack and found Katie the perfect dress. Just as Katie was fitted and looking beautiful, the bell on the door announced a new visitor to the store and Lisa went out of the room to see if it was Mike. Lisa pointed Mike in the direction of Katie's dressing room and she walked away, just as Katie emerged in her wedding dress. Mike was stunned to see Katie in a wedding gown and once he saw her he said, \"Hello, Angel.\" Katie was equally surprised to see Mike and asked him why he was there and he told her about Lisa's call. The two quickly figured out that Lisa had set up their meeting. Mike was happy to see Katie, but she did not share his enthusiasm. \n\n\nOutside the store, Lisa ran into Margo who had returned with her water and was curious why Lisa had left Fashions and how she had recovered from her coughing. Lisa tried to keep Margo from returning to the store, but Margo peered in the window and saw Katie talking with Mike. She asked Lisa why she had interfered, but didn't wait for an answer as she ran in to talk with her sister and Mike. Inside, Lisa wouldn't admit she had planned the meeting, but everyone seemed to know what had happened to bring Mike and Katie together. As the group discussed Mike's arrival, Brad appeared to check on Katie. She ducked behind Mike and insisted that Brad couldn't see her in her wedding dress. Lisa tried to shoo Brad out of the store because it was bad luck to see the bride in her gown, but Brad yelled that Mike was the one bringing the couple any misfortune. Mike apologized for causing trouble and offered Brad congratulations before he left. \n\n\nIn her dressing room, Katie sat on the floor and cried and wondered out loud what she was doing. Margo came into the room and found her sister upset. Katie told Margo that seeing Mike and hearing him call her \"angel\" had made her sad. Margo told Katie that her reaction to seeing Mike was a sign that she still cared for him, but Katie refused to listen to her sister and insisted she loved Brad. Margo went along with Katie's excuse and even agreed to let Katie have the wedding at her home. Katie thanked her sister and asked her to go tell Lisa she had found her wedding dress. \n\n\nMargo took Lisa outside for a long talk about interfering in Katie's life and Lisa admitted that she only wanted to help Katie. Lisa and Margo agreed that they both thought Katie was moving too fast and denying her feelings for Mike, but Margo was determined she was going to help Katie have a perfect wedding. \n\n\nKatie emerged from the dressing room and straight into Brad's arms. Brad told Katie since she found the perfect dress, there was nothing stopping them from getting married. Katie agreed and the two shared a kiss, but as they hugged her expression became troubled. \n\n\nAt Al's, Mike ran into Henry and told him about seeing Katie. Mike was visibly upset at the prospect of Katie marrying Brad, but Henry tried to convince Mike that Katie was over him.\n\n\n",
