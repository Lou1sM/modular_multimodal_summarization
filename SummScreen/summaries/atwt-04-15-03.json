When he hears the man try to justify his actions, Ben goes ballistic and has to be pulled away by Margo and John. This sparks Ben to go to the courthouse. When he arrives, Marshall's attorney has already grilled Jessica. She is mortified, and accuses Ben of staying away to protect himself, not her. Jack goes to see Carly and finds Craig looking at Carly's finished designs. Jack and Carly fight about Craig's presence and Jack insinuates that Craig has information about Barbara's disappearance. Jack wants Craig to meet him at the police station later. Craig leaves to see Emily and Rose. Carly takes offence that Jack thinks she and Craig might be involved in Barbara's disappearance. At the station, Jack tells Craig he thinks that he is behind Barbara's disappearance. Later, Carly goes to Rosanna's to show her the finished designs. Rose learns from Paul that the letter from Barbara is bogus and the police suspect foul play. Rose tries to do damage control but ends up making Paul angry. Meanwhile, Emily takes Henry to the cabin to fix the doggie door. Barbara sticks her head out but Henry uses a super-soaker to drive her back into the cabin. He nails the door shut. Craig reassures Emily and Rose that everything is fine and they agree to ride his crazy plan through. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ben assaulted a man in the ER after hearing how upset the man's rape victim was. Jessica gave her testimony without Ben at her side. Ben later came to the court house, but she rejected him. Craig loved Carly's designs. Carly took them to Fairwinds. Hal handed Barbara's case over to Jack. Jack hopes Carly isn't involved. Bob as trouble with his memory. Henry dressed in rain gear and a Super Soaker water gun in hand sprayed Barbara through the doggie door. He got into a tug of war with her over the fireplace tool and won. He reinforced the hole in the cottage door with another piece of wood.",
