Luke tells his mom that because she's only just been released from jail, she shouldn't be trying to help Keith solve Julia's murder. Luke gets Lily to agree that she won't do anything illegal. Keith takes Lily to the halfway house where Les has been staying, saying that the telephone booth from which Julia received a phone call was located very close to the halfway house, and he wants to find out whether there is any way that Keith could have gotten out of the halfway house after his 7 PM curfew. At the halfway house, Lily tells the manager/supervisor that they are there to do a newspaper story about the great job that halfway houses are doing in preparing inmates for their reintroduction to society, specifically Les Sweeney. The manager is skeptical that Les Sweeney is being used as a role model but is flattered when Lily says they will want to take the manager's picture to include with their story. The manager lets them into Les's room to look around, and Lily closes the door on him after he starts wondering where he's seen Lily before. Keith discovers a recently papered-over section of the wall and tears it apart, revealing an old dumbwaiter. This leads him to realize that Les could have left the room whenever he wanted to and could have gone to see Julia.\n\n\nCasey and Celia are at Casey's house. Casey's friend Matt drops in and is introduced to Celia. After she leaves the room, Matt tells Casey that Celia is hot and obviously wants Casey, and he says he knows that Casey is not prepared for that. As he leaves, he puts a condom in Casey's hand, which an embarrassed Casey stashes in his wallet. Celia returns, and she and Casey begin making out, but they are interrupted by the early return of Tom and Margo. Margo is a bit unnerved at finding them in the middle of a passionate makeout session, but Tom tells her it's nothing to worry about. Kim and Bob join them shortly and are introduced to Celia. When Kim asks to see Casey's recent school picture, he takes out his wallet to give it to her and sees the condom. After Casey makes an excuse about not wanting to show Kim the picture after all because it's not a good one, Margo grabs the wallet from him jokingly and tosses it to Kim, who drops in on the floor and finds the condom when she picks up the wallet.\n\n\nHenry and Katie are at the doctor's office to get a prescription for birth control. When a nurse brings out a stack of patient files and Katie notices that one of them is Jennifer's, she tells Henry that fate is leading her to sneak a look at the file. Katie manages to grab the file long enough to find out that Jennifer had seen her doctor before she went to the Family Planning Clinic. As she puzzles through this out loud, Henry argues with her until she agrees to stay out of it. She realizes they've just had their first fight, and they do a quick bit of makeup kissing. Henry gets a call from the limo service and has to leave to pick up a client, but Katie stays for their appointment. When she goes into the examining room, the nurse brings in several files for the doctor to review, including Jennifer's file. Katie tries to get the nurse to remove the files, but she insists on leaving them there, and when the nurse leaves, Katie takes another look at Jennifer's file.\n\n\nCraig visits Mike and Jennifer and congratulates them on Jennifer's pregnancy, which he has deduced from Barbara's awkward attempt to convince him that she was discussing a family friend who was pregnant. Mike and Jennifer tell Craig his presence is not welcome at their house, but for some reason, they allow him to continue pressing them for answers about the pregnancy, including why Jennifer would have considered terminating the pregnancy and when Jennifer is due. Jennifer tells Craig she's 10 weeks' pregnant and due at the end of October, and Mike says that he and Jennifer are preparing for the happy event and for their impending parenthood; he completely claims paternity, and then he finally manages to make Craig leave their house. Jennifer is concerned that Mike's hand has been forced, but Mike assures her that this is what he truly wants: to be this baby's father and to raise this child with her.\n\n\nAt the police station, Les arrives and asks Hal where Jack is; Hal tells him Jack is out of town for the day, and Les asks Hal to tell Jack that he said goodbye, because he'll be long gone by the time Jack returns. Hal then says he knows who Les is, and Les shows him a new court order he's received that grants him temporary custody of JJ. Hal tells Les that according to the papers, he can't leave Hal's jurisdiction until the final custody is resolved, and Les says he was speaking figuratively when he said he'd be \"long gone.\" Les leaves, and Hal asks someone at the department to make an attempt to get Jack off his flight before the plane takes off.\n\n\nJJ overhears Carly talking to Jack about Les's continuing battle to regain custody of JJ. JJ leaves the house, thinking he'll run away to keep away from Les. Carly goes outside and finds him, lecturing him about the dangers of being near a busy road by himself. She then tells him not to worry about Jack and Keith because they can take care of themselves, and she tells JJ that she personally can be a pretty good protector, because she fights hard for the people she loves, and this now includes JJ. She makes a \"pinkie promise\" to JJ that he will always be part of her family from this point forward, no matter what happens. They play checkers until JJ decides he wants to call Jack on the phone. Carly dials the number, then hands JJ the phone when the doorbell rings. She opens the door to find Les leaning against it, and JJ stares in fear and disbelief while listening to the message on Jack's phone telling him that the party he has dialed is currently out of range.\n\n\n\n\n",
