Carly walked in and said Parker deserved to know the truth. Carly told Parker that Jack had no interest in being her husband again, although he would always be Parker, Sage, and JJ's dad. Carly explained that Jack couldn't get past some of the things Carly had done in her past, and she couldn't make Jack feel something he didn't feel for her. Parker angrily left for school. \n\n\nJack told Carly he disagreed with her approach to Parker. Carly said she was just being honest. Jack didn't think they should put the kids in the middle of their situation, but Carly pointed out that the kids were already in the middle of it, since they lived there, too. Carly said the kids could see what was going on, whether she and Jack said anything or not. When Jack said they were still a family, Carly said those were just words, and she had finally gotten Jack's message \"loud and clear.\" \n\n\nJack asked what they would do next. Carly said she was going to reopen Metro. Jack didn't think that was a good idea, but Carly said she wasn't asking him for advice. Carly said she needed Jack's cooperation to work out a schedule for watching the kids so they could both get on with their lives. Carly told Jack she would take advantage of his medical leave and go to Metro to try to fix the place up. Jack said he needed to go to the station later, so Carly said she would be back by 1:30, but the kids had a half day of school, so Jack would need to make lunch for them. \n\n\nCarly went to Metro and began cleaning up. The mess was overwhelming, so she called a cleaning service instead. Parker, Sage, and JJ arrived home from school, and Jack began serving lunch. Jack got a call from someone at the station and told the person he'd be there soon. He tried to call Carly, but she didn't hear her phone ringing because the cleaning crew had turned on the vacuum cleaners. Parker told Jack to go ahead and leave if he needed to, because he and JJ could watch Sage, and Carly would be home soon. \n\n\nWhen Carly came home, she found the kids were alone. When they told her where Jack had gone, Carly became angry, saying the place was a mess, the boys knew they weren't supposed to be playing video games in the living room, and \"clearly no one is even thinking about homework.\" Carly picked up the phone and called a babysitter. \n\n\nCarly went to the police station and confronted Jack about having left the children home alone. Jack told Carly not to lecture him, and he told her he had tried to call her before he left. Carly said she apparently couldn't trust Jack to take care of their kids. Jack pointed out that he wasn't the one who didn't come home at the promised time. Jack then said it wasn't about him not being a good father; it was about Carly being mad because he wouldn't sleep with her anymore. Carly slapped Jack and marched out of the station. \n\n\nJJ went outside with Parker and asked him what was going on with their parents. Parker began telling him about the fight Carly and Jack had earlier that day, and Sage overheard them. When Sage asked questions, JJ told Parker he thought Sage was old enough to know what was going on, too. Parker told Sage their parents weren't getting back together again after all. Sage became upset and ran back inside, saying, \"But they promised we were going to be a family!\" \n\n\nWhen Carly returned home, she found Sage crying and Parker and JJ trying to comfort her. The babysitter came out and said she had no idea what had happened, because Sage had been fine just a minute earlier. Carly thanked the babysitter and said she could leave. Carly then asked the boys what had happened, and Parker told her. Sage asked if it was true that they weren't going to be a family again, and Carly held her and promised her that Sage and her brothers would be fine. \n\n\nKatie received a gift from Mike at her suite in the Lakeview: an angel, with a note saying Katie would always be his angel. She called Mike, who was at the Snyder farm, and told him she needed to see him right away. Katie went to the farm and met Mike out by the pond. She gave him back the angel and said it was inappropriate for Mike to have sent the note and gift to her. Mike questioned Katie's need to return it in person rather than throwing it away or mailing it back to him, but Katie said she wanted to make her point clearly. As she left, she tripped over Mike's work satchel and fell into the pond. \n\n\nMike pulled Katie out of the water and told her it was his turn to do some talking. Mike told Katie he'd been angry when he left her, and Katie said that when Mike had sent her the divorce papers by mail, she had realized how mad he was. He apologized for having done that, but Katie said they had both already apologized, and they should leave it at that. Katie told Mike that maybe they could be friends, but she wasn't his angel any more. \n\n\nBrad stopped by WOAK, and Kim told him the ratings were down overall and the station needed a really good ratings booster. Brad suggested an on-air wedding between him and Katie, which could help with sponsor advertising for things like the flowers and food. Kim liked the idea but said she couldn't consider it unless Katie gave her approval. Brad assured Kim that Katie would also want what was best for the station, so it wouldn't be a problem. \n\n\nThe minister who was supposed to perform the wedding ceremony arrived at Margo's to meet with Brad and Katie, but they weren't there yet. Margo prattled on to try to distract the minister from the fact that the bride and groom were missing, but he became impatient with the delay. Brad arrived. He told Margo he didn't know where Katie was. The minister decided he had waited long enough and said he was leaving; Brad tried to call Katie on her cell phone, but there was no answer and no voice mail. The minister suggested that if Brad couldn't get together with his bride the day before the wedding, perhaps he shouldn't be trying to get together with her on anything. Margo told Brad she thought the minister had a point. \n\n\nKatie returned to her suite at the Lakeview to change out of her wet clothes. As she undressed, Mike walked in, having gotten a room key from Lisa. As Katie yelled at Mike to get out, he walked up to her and kissed her. Katie broke away and told Mike she didn't want another chance with him, because she had found happiness with Brad. She said Mike had walked out on her because of one mistake and had made her feel like a slut for it, but Brad would never treat her like that. Mike told Katie not to marry Brad yet, because she would be marrying him on the rebound. Katie said if Mike thought walking into her room and putting his hands on her like that was enough to make her leave the man she had promised to marry, \"you're still treating me like a slut.\" \n\n\nMike told Katie he had never called her any names. He admitted he had been wrong and asked her to give him another chance. Katie said it was too late and pointed out that Mike hadn't called or e-mailed her in over a year. Mike said he had been hurt, because Katie had been his best friend and his wife. Katie asked, \"Do you still love me?\" Mike just looked at her, and Katie said she wasn't giving everything up for someone who couldn't even answer that question. Katie then told Mike to leave. \n\n\nKatie rushed over to Margo's, only to find out the minister had left and wasn't coming back. Katie told Brad and Margo she'd lost track of time. She said she hadn't had any coffee yet, and she asked Brad to bring her a latte from Java. After Brad left, Margo asked what Katie had really been doing, asking if she'd been with Mike. Katie admitted Mike had come to her suite, asking her to give him another chance, but she said she had told Mike to stop stalking her. Margo said she thought Mike was right-there was still something between Katie and Mike, and Katie should figure it out or not marry Brad. \n\n\nMargo said Katie needed to step back and see that she was not over either Jack or Mike. Katie insisted she was over them and that she loved Brad. Margo said she couldn't let Katie make another big mistake, and Katie became angry and said if Margo couldn't be a part of the wedding, she would find someone else to stand up with her and someplace else to get married. Brad walked in as Katie was storming out; he asked what was wrong, and Katie snapped, \"Ask her!\" When Brad asked Margo what she'd done to Katie, Margo said, \"Ask her!\" \n\n\nKatie went to WOAK, where Kim told her about the conversation with Brad about having the wedding take place on the TV show. As Brad walked in, apologizing for not having talked to Katie about it yet, Katie said she thought it was a great idea and that they should get married the next day. Kim said she didn't know if she could make things happen that quickly, but she would try. She thanked Katie and Brad and left, happily planning the wedding. Brad asked Katie what Margo would think, and Katie told him Margo was no longer part of the wedding. Brad wanted to know what had happened; Katie said Margo had her own agenda and wasn't on their side. Katie said it wasn't important who was there or where they got married, as long as she and Brad ended up as husband and wife. \n\n\nMike returned the room key to Lisa and told her things hadn't gone well with Katie. Lisa said Mike needed to keep trying, because although Lisa thought Brad was a nice guy, she didn't think he was right for Katie. Mike said he just had to accept the way things were, but Lisa told him not to give up. \n\n\n",
