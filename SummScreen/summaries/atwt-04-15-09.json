Katie said that Henry had helped her with her career then, legally and illegally, and here he was helping her become a mom. \n\n\nHenry said Vienna was home with a little cold, and Katie immediately assumed that the baby was in jeopardy. Henry tried to assure her that a runny nose was not a big deal. Katie said they were all on an incredible journey, and they needed to learn how to take care of each other. Katie asked for a bowl of chicken noodle soup and told Henry it was time for them to make a house call. \n\n\nAt Brad and Katie's, Vienna coughed and sneezed, so Brad tried to comfort her. He answered the door to find Joe, a cameraman from WOAK, who said Kim wanted to begin shooting their documentary on the baby that morning. Brad discussed it with Vienna, who opted to send Joe away until she felt better. Brad told Joe to come back later, and then he asked Vienna what he could do for her. She cooked up a green gooey poultice that Brad said smelled awful, and she opened her robe and instructed Brad to rub the goo on her chest. \n\n\nAn embarrassed Brad suggested that they wait until either Katie or Henry returned home, but Vienna was insistent. Brad agreed to continue, but he looked the other way as he spread the goo on Vienna's neck. She told him he had to watch where he was putting it, and she redirected his hand to her chest. An uncomfortable Brad did as he was told, just as Henry and Katie walked in on them. \n\n\nAt Lily's, she counseled Luke not to let Damian get to him. Luke said Damian was everywhere around town, and worse than that, he was working Lily. Lily said they all wanted the same thing, and that was to find out who was sabotaging the foundation. Lily said vehemently that there was no way Damian would run down, or pay someone to run down, his son. \n\n\nLuke was upset that his mother was defending Damian, and he was also concerned about his relationship with Noah. Luke had not heard from his boyfriend since he had left the house a couple of nights before. The doorbell rang, and Luke opened the door to Damian. As his father came in, Luke bolted out, declaring that he was \"so out of\" there. \n\n\nDamian told Lily that he had just spoken with his family jeweler in Malta, who had confirmed that the ring from Lily's files that Damian had sent him was part of a setting he had made for the Grimaldi family years before. Lily asked who else in the family had such a ring, and Damian answered that Luke had one. Lily blew up and told Damian to get the hell out if he was suggesting that their son had put their nightmare in motion and was looting his own foundation. \n\n\nLuke went to Old Town, where he ran into Zoe. She called him \"Luciano,\" and he corrected her that his name was \"Luke.\" Zoe apologized for the twins' behavior at Luke's house; she knew that they had crossed the line. She told Luke that Zac was meeting with someone who could possibly figure out who was messing with the foundation's accounts. \n\n\nLuke said he was concerned that Noah was acting out of character by not talking about whatever was bothering him. Zoe suggested they look for Noah, so they went to Java. The manager said that Noah was two hours late for his shift, and he had not called. Luke was worried, because Noah was the poster child for responsible work ethics. He called his boyfriend again, but the call went directly to voicemail. \n\n\nBack at Brad and Katie's, Katie came unglued at what it appeared Brad was doing to Vienna's chest. Brad said it was so that Vienna could breathe and keep the baby healthy. Katie was angry and marched out. Brad stood there with green goo dripping from his hands, so he wiped most of it off and went after his wife. He found her at the television station and asked for an explanation. Katie said it hurt to see Brad taking care of Vienna, instead of her. She was the one who should be carrying their baby, and Brad understood. He said he had no idea the surrogacy would be so hard on her, and he reassured her how much he loved her. \n\n\nLuke and Zoe left Java, and were heading for Noah's dorm room when Luke's phone rang. He was relieved to see that the call was from Noah, who told him he was sorry that he had not answered his phone. Noah explained that he had been on a plane. He went on to say that the previous few days had been filled with disagreements, and he figured that both of them could use some time apart. \n\n\nLuke asked where he was, and Noah answered, \"Lisbon.\" He said he was attending a film festival with some classmates, and Luke was stunned. Noah begged him not to be mad, and Luke was almost in tears when Noah said he was just in the way of Luke's family business. Noah hung up, and Luke was heartbroken. Zoe consoled him by saying that he and Noah would work things out, but Luke blamed Damian for everything. \n\n\nVienna explained to Henry that Brad was helping her breathe, and scolded him for being rude and disrespectful for his remarks about how much Brad had enjoyed the experience. They argued until Vienna told him to put a sock in it. They revisited the conflict about the true paternity of the baby Vienna was carrying, and Henry claimed that since he was the true father, Brad had no right to even touch Vienna. Vienna said that Henry could not have it both ways and he needed to make up his mind. She turned towards the door and slipped in a puddle of green goo that Brad had dropped, and she took a nasty fall. \n\n\nWith Lily, Damian said they needed to examine Luke's motives and actions, but Lily told him that their son was nothing like Damian. Damian asserted that Luke was very much his son and cited the boy's desire to win at all costs. His examples were Luke's fixing of the school election and how Luke had lied to the immigration officials to protect Ameera. Lily was furious at Damian's comparisons with the Grimaldis, and she said that pointing out their son's criminal tendencies was not a way to win her cooperation. \n\n\nDamian urged her to stop making excuses for Luke's destructive behavior. Lily was afraid if Damian pursued his interests, it would only push Luke further away. Luke barged into the living room and congratulated Damian for ruining his life. \n\n\nHenry helped Vienna up and got her back on the couch. She did not appear hurt, but Henry insisted that he take her to Memorial to make sure she and baby were all right. Outside the door, they discovered that Joe, toting his camera, was back, so Henry let him in and took off. \n\n\nKatie and Brad returned home to find only Joe there. He told them that Henry had taken Vienna to the hospital, so the two of them rushed off to Memorial. They found Vienna in a bed, and she assured them that she and the baby were not hurt. Henry lost his cool and shouted at Brad to back off from Vienna. Brad reminded him that Vienna was carrying his baby and therefore, he and Katie had a right to know what was going on. Henry almost spilled the beans about the paternity of the baby, but he stormed out just in time. Brad went after him. \n\n\nLuke accused Damian of threatening Noah into leaving the country. Damian denied it, as Lily asked why Luke was so angry. Luke said that thanks to Damian, Noah had gone to Lisbon. Lily could not believe that Noah had not contacted Luke before he left, and Luke declared he was going to find his love. Lily suggested that Luke give Noah the space he had requested, and said Luke was worth coming back to. Luke screamed at Damian to get out and stop causing him so much pain. Lily defended Damian, so Luke said that until Damian was gone, so was he. \n\n\nAfter Luke ran out, Lily and Damian continued their discussion. Lily accused her ex-husband of crossing the line with Noah in order to get closer to Luke. Damian apologized for that and said he was going back to Malta to ask his jeweler some more questions. He had one more stop to make, however, in Lisbon. He wanted to convince Noah to go home to Luke. \n\n\nLuke talked again with Zoe, and he questioned whether he should follow Noah to Lisbon. Zoe agreed that Noah probably needed some space. Lily called Luke and asked him to return home. She said Damian had left for Malta, so Luke agreed. He told Zoe the latest development, and she observed that things were beginning to turn around for Luke. \n\n\nKatie said she was sorry that she had overreacted to seeing Brad massage Vienna's chest. Vienna also apologized for Henry's bizarre behavior, and Katie said she understood how Henry felt left out of the baby process, just as she did. Vienna agreed to include Katie in more of the decisions, and the two women hugged. \n\n\nBrad located Henry in the hospital and asked him what was going on. Henry told him to go away, but Brad refused. He said he knew it was hard on Henry to realize that Brad had gotten Vienna pregnant, instead of Henry. Henry lashed out and called Brad a \"walking monkey wrench,\" and blurted out, \"That is my --woman!\" He covered his near mistake, and the two finally shook hands and agreed they were good. \n\n\nZoe went to Zac, who appeared to be in a basement. She told him that Luke blamed Damian for Noah's absence, and that pleased Zac. Zoe went on to tell her twin the best part of all was that Damian had gone back to Malta. Zac declared that even better than what they had hoped for. Zac called out to \"Monster,\" who had overheard their conversation, and it was Noah, shackled and tied to a post. He yelled at them to leave Luke alone. \n\n\nBrad and Katie relaxed at home, and Brad explained how Henry wanted to take care of his \"woman\" himself. Katie was anxious for the waiting part of the pregnancy to be over. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Henry checked Vienna out and waited for her to get dressed. Vienna asked him pointedly if anything had changed after his talk with Brad, but Henry said nothing had. They went back to Brad and Katie's house. \n\n\nLily asked Luke if he had heard any more from Noah, but he had not. Luke felt his boyfriend was not just taking a break, but had run away. Lily urged her son to stay strong and to remember how much Noah loved him. \n\n\nNoah demanded to know why Zac had imprisoned him. Zac gave him no answers, but he did say that as long as Luciano played along, no one would get hurt. The twins turned out the lights and left Noah alone in the dark.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie and Henry talk about Vienna's pregnancy, as Katie promises to try not to obsess over Vienna's pregnancy after she overreacts after finding out she is sick with a cold. Vienna is feeling miserable and asks Brad to rub a homemade remedy for colds on her chest. He is unsure, but he then agrees to do it. Henry and Katie walk in to find Brad and Vienna doing this and neither reacts well. Brad goes after Katie, who has run off. Katie later admits to being envious of what Vienna is going through and feels she is being left out. Brad assures her that she is their baby's mother. Henry and Vienna argue over what he saw. Henry is not happy that Brad has his hands on Vienna when it is his baby, but he refuses still to step up and admit to anything. As they are arguing, Vienna falls, and Henry takes her to the hospital as a precaution. Brad and Katie learn from a WOAK cameraman that Vienna was taken to the hospital and rush over there. They are upset that Henry and Vienna didn't call them, as Henry doesn't react well and has to leave the room before he says anything else. Brad goes after them, as Henry almost spills the beans, but he then changes his mind \u0096 again. Brad and Katie can't wait until this part of the pregnancy is over so they can hold their baby in their arms and know it is theirs. Henry and Vienna continue with their charade about the baby's paternity. Luke is worried when he can't reach Noah. Zoe tries to support him in her own weird way, and offers to help look for him, as Luke finally hears from Noah. He claims that he thought they needed space so he went to Lisbon with some friends to a film festival. Luke is upset and feels he is running away. Damian tells Lily that the Grimaldi ring she found may belong to Luke. He wonders if Luke isn't more like him then Lily wants to believe, as he and Lily argue about this. She wants Damian to trust her that Luke isn't involved in framing him to get him back. No sooner though, does Luke come charging through the door at Damian, claiming he made Noah go away. He and Damian have words, as Luke is angry with his mother for not kicking Damian out and won't come back until he is gone. Damian tells Lily that he is going back to Malta to find out about the ring and then is going to Lisbon to bring Noah back. Lily discourages it thinking he will make it worse, but Damian feels he has no choice; he has to make things right with his son. Lily tells Luke that Damian has left town, as Luke worries about why Noah left. Lily doesn't think Luke should go find Noah; she believes Noah loves Luke deeply and will come back soon. Zoe shows up to see Zac at an abandoned warehouse where they have kidnapped and are holding Noah; she tells him of the details of what happened with Luke and how Damian left town. Zac is happy that their plan is going even better then they thought it would. Noah demands to know what they are planning, but Zac and Zoe won't tell him \u0096 they only allude to the fact that Luke will not be hurt, as long as he goes along with their plan.",
