A grumpy Emily was sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed, and she said, \"Did you sleep well, Paul?\"  Paul jumped out of bed, and he startled Meg awake. Paul proclaimed that things were not as they appeared, as Meg apologized for dozing off and took the baby back to her crib.  Paul told Emily that Eliza had fussed, so he had brought her to their bed, but Meg had offered to take the baby.  After that, Paul didn't remember a thing.\n\n\nMeg returned and explained how Eliza had settled down after Meg had put her next to her sleeping father.  \"Evidently it worked for you, too,\" snarled Emily. Meg dashed out, so Emily went to her side of the bed, took off her robe, and climbed between the sheets.  Paul got into bed and turned to Emily, who rolled away from him and turned her back on him.\n\n\nThe next morning, Emily said to Paul that it was obvious that Meg wasn't quite ready for a sleepover yet.  Meg joined them, raving about the best sleep she had ever had, topped off by a half-hour shower with really hot water.  She annoyed Emily, who was relieved when Emma arrived to drive her daughter back to Deerbrook.  Meg went upstairs to get her things, and Emma asked Paul and Emily if there was anything she needed to know.  Emily said, \"Yes,\" but Paul cut her off and said everything had turned out \"great.\"  Paul also left the room, so Emma cornered Emily and asked what she had wanted to say earlier.\n\n\nEmily said that nothing had happened, but Emma was wise and wouldn't let it drop.  Finally Emily said that Meg had somehow managed to fall asleep in bed with Paul and Eliza.  Emma was very disturbed.  Upstairs, Paul asked to speak with Meg.  He told her that he was on her side and wanted her to get well, but he was in love with Emily, and their marriage was very important to him.  Meg said that she understood completely.\n\n\nThey went down to the living room, and Meg again thanked her hosts for letting her spend the night.  Emily looked right at Meg and said she understood her well.  Meg held Eliza and murmured how much she loved her, and then she handed the baby back to Paul, and walked out with Emma.  \n\n\n\n\nIn Luke's hotel room in Dallas, he and Reid had worked on Reid's defense, and he wanted to go back to his place and get some rest.  Luke, however, wanted to go over the testimony one more time, and he suggested that Oliver try telling the story of Annie Judd in humanistic terms rather than medical ones.  Luke said it might make the difference between the doctor's keeping his medical license and losing it.  Luke described Mr. Judd as a grieving father, hell-bent on revenge, and he guessed that the man would break the jury's heart.\n\n\nLuke told Reid it was up to him to explain that if the Board didn't let him practice medicine, they were going to be responsible for many deaths.  Oliver began just talking about little Annie, and he described her sweet smile and how she never held it against him when he had to give her shots or do an operation on her skull.  He said he missed her, but then, in an instant, Reid was back to being a jerk.  He continued to call Luke \"Mr. Snyder,\" and finally Luke asked him why he did that.  Oliver said it didn't matter much what he called him.  Luke said that Oliver called Noah by his first name, but the doctor said that was a doctor-patient relationship that was clear and defined.  Luke then asked what that made the two of them, and Reid backed out of the discussion by saying he had to go home and get some rest.\n\n\nThe next morning, Luke took a shower, and wrapped only in a towel, he answered a knock on the door.  Dr. Oliver stood there holding two cups of coffee, and he commented that Luke wasn't dressed yet.  Luke asked for two minutes, and he ran into the bathroom, shedding the towel as he passed through the door.  After Luke was dressed, he asked Reid if he felt ready to face the licensing board.  The doctor said he wasn't afraid of a few \"dinosaurs,\" so Luke reminded him that Reid could not be the head of the new wing at Memorial without a medical license.  He also asked him to keep repeating his mantra, \"Don't be an ass\" and that made Oliver laugh.  \n\n\n\n\nThe two were headed out the door when the doctor's phone rang, and he spoke to Noah, assuring him that the hearing was just a formality.  Noah, however, was uneasy that the doctor was going through it all alone, so Dr. Oliver said he wasn't and handed the phone to Luke.  Noah was amazed that Luke was in Texas and that he and Reid hadn't killed one another on the plane flight down.  Noah wished them good luck, and Luke hung up.  Then he brushed some lint off Reid's coat, and he pronounced the two of them ready.\n\n\nMolly Conlan sat in the Lakeview bar, nursing a drink and missing Holden, who was at the Snyder cabin with Lily and Faith.  Congressman Silas Whitman, her former lover, surprised her by walking up and joining her.  He said he was fresh out of jail, released on a technicality, and his wife had divorced him and wiped him out.  He told Molly he was rebuilding his life and no longer running away from his mistakes.  Molly didn't appreciate being included among the man's \"mistakes,\" but Whitman said he was in recovery.  Molly quipped, \"Weasels Anonymous?\" and Whitman laughed and said she was the perfect person to do his \"Tell All, Mea Culpa\" interview.\n\n\nMolly could not believe that someone who had just gotten out of jail for trying to kill her wanted her to interview him.  She wasn't buying it, and she said she was so over him and had a new man in her life.  Whitman then became snarky, and asked why Molly was drinking alone at night if life was so good.  Molly didn't respond, so the Congressman asked her point blank where \"Mr. Wonderful\" was.  Molly said he was away on family business, and Whitman smirked, Molly said, \"Shut up, Silas.  You were not my finest hour.\"  He apologized and asked for another chance with her, but Molly stood up and answered by throwing her drink on him and stomping out.\n\n\nAt their cabin, Holden slept on the couch, and a sleepless Lily wandered out to the kitchen.  Holden woke up, and he and Lily began talking about Faith.  Lily feared that Damian's influence on their lives, and on Faith's in particular, was irreparable.   They mixed peanut butter and marshmallow topping together the way they used to when Luke and Faith were young, and they made sandwiches.  \n\n\nFaith watched quietly from the shadows, as Lily stressed about what would happen to the younger children if Faith continued to do drugs at home.  Faith walked out at that point and told her parents that they were right.  She announced that it was time to \"lock up the children.\"\n\n\n\n\nFaith then asked if her mother really thought that she would corrupt Natalie and Ethan, but Lily said no.  Faith made some nasty remarks about Lily's own addiction problems in the past, and Holden had to step in.  Faith suggested that she move to the farm and live with her dad, while the younger kids stayed with Lily.  Holden was horrified at the suggestion, but Lily surprised him by saying that was not a bad idea.  She said Holden had to agree, so Holden did, and Faith hugged her dad joyfully but barely thanked her mother.  Lily tearfully admitted that her daughter thought she'd be better off without her mother, so Lily had to let her go.  Holden hugged Lily, as Faith watched.\n\n\nAt the farm the next morning, Molly was reading the newspaper when Holden walked in.  She ran to him and asked why he was back so early.  Holden said the trip had gone well, and they had all agreed that Faith would live at the farm.  Molly was very understanding and appreciated how important it was for Faith to have the influence of Emma.  She and Holden kissed, just as Lily and Faith walked in, and Faith ran straight to Molly and began to make plans with her that Faith had refused to do with her mother.  Molly played it cool and told the girl that they would see how it all went.  Holden sent his daughter upstairs to check out her new room.\n\n\nLily looked unhappy, and she was concerned about Molly's close proximity to her daughter, but she hoped that Molly could get through to Faith.  Lily said that the girl's well-being was all that mattered.  Faith returned downstairs, and Holden went over the farm ground rules.  He reminded Faith that everyone who lived there pitched in with the work, and Faith would have the use of a horse, but she had to take complete control of its care.  He also explained that her schoolwork had to be a priority, so Lily suggested that she and Faith go back home and get Faith's school books, her computer, and the rest of her clothes.\n\n\nLily and Holden went outside, and he gave her the chance to change her mind about the living arrangements, but Lily said they were doing the right thing.  Molly watched them out the kitchen window, and Faith, who had run to get her coat, watched Molly.\n\n\nBack at Lily's, Faith told her mom to stop being so helpful because they both knew that Lily hated it.  Lily admitted that she would miss Faith, but the girl said she wasn't talking about that.  She said it was obvious to everyone that Lily hated the fact that Molly was living with Holden at the farm because Lily wanted him back.\n\n\nMolly and Holden talked, and they both thought that Faith would prosper at the farm, and Holden was very grateful for Molly's help.  They kissed, as someone knocked loudly on the door and then just walked in. It was Congressman Whitman, who said he had gotten Molly's address from the television station.  He said the folks there were very excited about their impending interview.  Molly was speechless, so Whitman asked her to introduce him to Holden, but Holden said he knew who Whitman was.  Holden stepped forward and grabbed Whitman's coat lapels and said he wanted him out of his home.\n\n\n\n\n",
