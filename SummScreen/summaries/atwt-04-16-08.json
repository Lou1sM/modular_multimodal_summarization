Brad gave Katie flowers to try to make her feel better about Margo backing out as maid of honor. Kim came into their office and heard that Katie was without someone to stand up with her at the altar and insisted that she find someone to replace Margo. Katie realized that the best alternative to Margo was Vienna, and Brad agreed. Katie admitted she was sad not to have Margo by her side on her wedding day, but didn't want her sister there unless she was happy for Katie and Brad. Katie left to ask Vienna, and Brad decided it was up to him to get Margo to change her mind. \n\n\nBrad arrived at the police station and tried to get Margo to tell him why she wouldn't be Katie's maid of honor. Margo explained that she didn't want to see Katie hurt again, and believed that Katie wasn't over Mike. Brad refused to believe that Katie still cared for Mike and kept trying to convince Margo to be in the wedding party. Margo warned Brad that Katie had acted impulsively in the past and that he shouldn't marry Katie unless he was sure that he was the one Katie truly loved. Margo told Brad to make Katie prove to him that she loved him. Brad didn't know how to do that, but Margo encouraged him to find a way before he walked down the aisle with Katie. \n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Mike held the angel that Katie had returned to him and told Henry about his failed attempt to win her back. Mike asked Henry if he thought Brad was the right man for Katie, and Henry admitted that he didn't know for sure, but he did know that Brad made Katie happy. Mike believed that Katie still loved him and that marrying Brad was a mistake. Henry told Mike that he needed to get used to the idea of Katie and Brad together because their wedding was going to be broadcast live on television. Hearing this news convinced Mike even more that Katie was putting on a show and didn't really love Brad. Mike told Henry he was going to find a way to stop Katie's wedding. As Mike got ready to leave the diner, he ran into Katie who was coming to ask Vienna to be her maid of honor. Katie didn't even acknowledge Mike and walked right past him as he left the restaurant. \n\n\nKatie sat down with Henry and asked if she could talk to Vienna, but Henry explained that Vienna was quarantined at the hotel with a nasty case of the chickenpox. Katie was discouraged that Vienna wasn't available and the two struggled to come up with someone else to be Katie's maid of honor. In a desperate attempt to find someone appropriate to stand at Katie's side, the two settled on Henry as Katie's \"male-of-honor.\" Henry reminded Katie that he was supposed to be Brad's best man and they needed to find a new man to stand by Brad. Henry encouraged Katie to ask Jack to be Brad's best man and Katie set out to find Jack. \n\n\nAfter talking to Margo, Brad went by Al's Diner to see Henry and learned that Henry was standing up for Katie. Henry didn't mention anything to Brad about Katie asking Jack, so Brad was initially at a loss for who he could ask to be his best man. After some thought, Brad began to laugh out loud and told Henry he had figured it all out and left the diner. \n\n\nBrad tracked Mike down at the Lakeview and told him he wanted to be friends. Mike didn't believe Brad was there to be his buddy and was reluctant to sit and listen to him. Brad finally came out and asked Mike to be his best man, and at first Mike laughed off the suggestion. Brad explained his situation and told Mike that if he stood up for him, he would be doing him a huge favor. After some serious thought, Mike finally agreed. \n\n\nAt her home, Carly was struggling to get the security system at Metro up and running and Jack said he would help her out. Carly thought Jack's offer was an attempt to apologize for sleeping with her and then telling her they had no future, but Jack insisted he didn't have anything to apologize for and was just trying to help. Carly refused to accept Jack's assistance and told him she didn't want to be his friend anymore. \n\n\nCarly arrived at Metro and discovered the repairs that needed to done before Metro could reopen would be further delayed. As her frustration began to boil over, Jack arrived to fix the club's security system. Carly told him she didn't need his help, but Jack refused to listen and got to work. Carly stopped Jack long enough to tell him that she needed to be more than friends. Jack told her that she needed to find a way to deal with their relationship for the sake of their children because he had nothing more than his friendship to give her. Jack refused to listen to Carly's reasons why they should be a couple again and as he got back to work she began to scream at him about how angry she was with him. At that moment, Katie arrived and walked in as Carly yelled at Jack. Carly saw Katie and asked her why she was there. Carly told Katie that if she was there for Jack, she was welcome to him and Carly stormed out. \n\n\nAlone in the club, Katie apologized for her bad timing and asked Jack what was going on with Carly. Jack explained that they were trying to coexist for the kids, but that Carly wanted more then he could give. Katie wasted no time and told Jack she was there to ask him to be Brad's best man. Jack thought his recent marriage to Katie presented a big problem, but she persuaded him to help her out. Jack agreed he would do it if he was convinced it was what Brad really wanted. The two shared an awkward hug before Katie left to get ready for the ceremony. \n\n\nJack went to the police station to tell Margo he needed the afternoon off to attend Katie and Brad's wedding. Margo was relieved to hear that Jack was going to be Brad's best man because she hoped that when Katie saw Jack standing next to Brad, she would come to her senses and realize she was acting impetuously. Jack insisted he didn't want that to happen because he wanted Katie to be happy, and he knew he had no future with her. Margo suggested that Mike might be the man for Katie, but Jack said he believed that Brad really loved Katie and hoped the wedding ran smoothly. \n\n\nBrad and Katie returned to the station and each explained to the other about their choice for Brad's best man. Katie was not happy with Brad asking Mike and asked him to call him to back out. Brad reminded her that it would be great for the show if she had three ex-husbands in the ceremony and Kim, who had overheard, agreed. Katie looked on as Kim and Brad finished getting the set ready for the ceremony and found herself overwhelmed by her situation. \n\n\nMike found Henry at the diner and informed him about Brad's request. Henry told Mike about sending Katie to ask Jack to be Brad's best man. Mike admitted that he was curious if the ceremony would even go forward with him there and said that he wasn't going to miss it. Henry asked Mike if he was going to the wedding to disrupt the ceremony and Mike didn't answer, but simply told Henry he would see him at the altar. \n\n\nLily and Lucinda prepared to leave the farm to visit Dusty's grave, but before they could go, Holden arrived and asked where they were going. Lily admitted they wanted to be at the cemetery to see Dusty's headstone placed. Holden was upset that his wife had failed to tell him what she was doing and frustrated that she was hiding things about Dusty again. Lily and Lucinda tried to explain why they were going, but Holden was bothered by Lily's failure to communicate with him. Holden put an end to the argument by telling Lily and Lucinda to go. \n\n\nOn the way to the cemetery, Lucinda asked Lily if she and Holden were all right. Lily told her mother that she loved Holden more than ever, but it seemed Holden couldn't get past her affair with Dusty. Lucinda reminded Lily that their visit to the cemetery was not an extension of her affair, but a final goodbye to a dear friend. Lily explained about the package she received containing Dusty's belongings and how it had upset her. Lily believed Holden was worried that visiting the cemetery would just upset her more. Lucinda said she would talk to Holden, but Lily asked her mother not to interfere. Lily believed she and Holden would be able to work things out on their own. \n\n\nAfter visiting Dusty's grave-site, Lily and Lucinda prepared to return home. Lily decided to take her mother's advice-she would tell Holden that she loved him and needed him. She was determined to let Holden know that she would do anything to keep their marriage together. \n\n\nAfter Carly left Metro, she went straight to the Snyder farm to talk with Lily. When she arrived, Holden told her that Lily was not there and Carly broke down crying. Holden hugged Carly and asked her if he could help. Carly told Holden she didn't need another \"Snyder man's\" opinion and left. Holden rushed after Carly and tracked her down at the pond. He tried to make sure she was all right, but Carly didn't want to talk to him. Holden explained to Carly that he had been through the same kind of rejection that she was experiencing with Jack and, regardless of what happened between her and Jack, she would always be welcomed at the Snyder farm. \n\n\n",
