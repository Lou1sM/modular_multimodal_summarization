Lily denied that there was anything between herself and Holden other than their joint concern for their children, and she told Faith that she wished Molly and Holden well. Faith said she hoped Lily meant that, because there was no way Lily could win Holden back from Molly.\n\n\nLily took Faith shopping in Old Town to buy some things for Faith to take to the farm, where she would be staying. There, they ran into Liberty. Lily gave the girls a few minutes alone, and Faith told Liberty that she was moving in with Holden at the farm. Liberty asked if everything was okay between Faith and Lily, and Faith answered that things might be better if they didn't have to be together so much of the time.\n\n\nLiberty then remarked that it was funny that Faith was moving into the farm just after Liberty had moved out, and Faith said that it would have been fun if they could both have lived there at the same time. However, Faith assumed that Liberty was enjoying being so close to Parker. Liberty said it wasn't that great of a situation, because Parker had recently told Liberty that he wanted to get back together with her, and Liberty wasn't interested in doing so, in light of her medical problems.\n\n\nFaith asked if Liberty was interested in another guy, but Liberty pointed out that as a cancer patient with no hair, she wasn't feeling terribly attractive. Liberty said that during her time in the hospital, she had begun to understand how important Parker's friendship was to her, and she didn't want to risk losing that just so they could \"hook up.\"\n\n\nLily returned from her shopping, and Liberty greeted her and said that Faith had told her about moving to the farm. Liberty said Faith would enjoy living there. Liberty then counseled Faith not to waste time being mad at people, because \"you never really get that time back.\" Lily thanked Liberty and wished her good luck at her doctor's appointment. Liberty left, and Lily said admiringly, \"She's so strong and mature.\" Faith rolled her eyes and said, \"Not like me, right?\" Lily said that wasn't what she'd meant, but Faith ignored her and said it was time to leave.\n\n\nAt the farm, Molly convinced Holden to let go of Silas. Silas told Holden it was apparent that his reputation had preceded him. He thanked Holden for having had other plans the previous night, which had enabled Molly to have a drink with Silas. Molly corrected Silas' version of events and told Holden she'd been having a drink alone when Silas had approached her.\n\n\nSilas told Holden that he had told Molly that he wanted to atone for his mistakes, and that Molly could help him do that. Holden asked what Silas meant, and Silas replied that Molly could interview him on television. Holden wondered why Silas would think that a woman with whom he'd cheated on his wife and whom he had tried to kill would even consider such a thing, and Molly piped up and said she had never agreed to do the interview. Silas said it was truly in the best interest of both Molly and himself to do the interview, but Holden told Silas to get out while he could still walk. Silas left, reluctantly.\n\n\nMolly told Holden that she had been freaked out when Silas had walked into the farmhouse. Holden said Molly had every right to be. Molly replied that she had made some terrible decisions about Silas, but Holden assured Molly that he knew that part of her life was over, and he kissed her. Holden said he had wanted to rip off Silas' head, but Molly said he wasn't worth it. She then reminded Holden that before Silas had shown up, they had been talking about doing some naughty things in the hayloft. They began kissing passionately, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Faith and Lily.\n\n\nFaith was excited about being at the farm, but Holden reminded her that it wasn't a reward for good behavior. Lily then suggested that each week, they have a family dinner with Holden, Faith, Luke, Natalie, and Ethan. Faith nodded toward Molly and asked, \"Aren't you forgetting someone?\" Lily said that they would be happy to have Molly join them at the weekly dinners. Molly thanked her, and Holden suggested they start immediately.\n\n\nHolden said he would call for some takeout food, but Molly said that wouldn't be necessary, because she had already made a casserole and could heat it up in ten minutes. Her announcement was greeted with dubious looks from everyone else, but she assured them that she could follow a recipe.\n\n\nMolly served the casserole, which everyone agreed looked and smelled terrific. However, one bite was enough to change everyone's opinion. Chagrined, Molly observed that it apparently took more to make a good casserole than she knew. Holden assured Molly it was okay, and even Lily agreed that \"these things happen.\" Molly said, \"Not to you,\" but Lily laughed and said yes, they did. Holden laughed, too, and reminded Lily of one particularly bad meal when Lily had used two cups of salt instead of flour. Molly and Faith watched as Holden and Lily both enjoyed the memory of the life they had shared together.\n\n\nMolly stood up and tossed the casserole in the garbage as Holden and Lily continued to laugh about the salt incident. Faith followed Molly out the door when Molly took the garbage bag outside, and she told Molly not to act like Lily's history with Holden bothered her. Faith said that her mom wanted her dad back, and if Lily could see that her behavior bothered Molly, she would keep behaving that way. Molly told Faith it was inappropriate to discuss things like that with her, but she assured Faith that her relationship with Holden was fine. Faith replied, \"Don't say I didn't warn you,\" and she returned to the kitchen table.\n\n\nMolly's cell phone rang, and she was surprised to hear Silas on the other end. Silas told Molly that he knew she still wanted the interview with him, because it would be a sensational story for her to cover. He said, \"You could still snag it, or me.\" Molly told Silas that he was a pig, but then she heard more laughter coming from the kitchen and told Silas, \"Name the time and place.\"\n\n\nDusty found Janet at the hospital and told her that Rocco's doctor had said that Rocco would be released that day. Dusty then said that since their new house wasn't yet ready for them to occupy, Janet and Liberty could move into an empty suite next to Dusty's suite at the Lakeview. Janet wasn't receptive to that idea and reminded Dusty that her father had suffered a heart attack because of an argument he and Dusty had been having.\n\n\nDusty stressed that the doctor had said that Rocco would be fine, and Dusty thought that he and Janet should get on with their lives. Janet told Dusty that earlier that week, he had told her that she should move on without him. Dusty responded that he'd been trying to protect her. Janet, however, was quick to point out that Dusty had lied to her about how hurt he was and about being in cahoots with Carly to set up Rocco. Janet said her feelings for Dusty had changed because she wasn't sure that she could trust him again.\n\n\nA nurse walked out and told Janet that her father was asking to see her. Janet went in and sat on Rocco's bed, while Dusty hovered in the doorway, eavesdropping. Rocco apologized to Janet and told her that he wanted to earn back her respect. Janet said that Rocco had saved Dusty's life, but Rocco admitted that Dusty wouldn't have needed saving if Rocco hadn't meddled in a situation that didn't involve him. He then said he was considering selling his hardware store and relocating, with Janet's mom, to Oakdale, to be near Janet and Liberty. Janet thought that would be wonderful. Rocco told Janet that Dusty was a good man, but Janet said that Dusty didn't matter; what mattered was that Rocco got better.\n\n\nJanet asked her father if there was anything she could do for him, and he asked if Janet could get a clean shirt for him to wear home. She said she would. Janet walked out and told Dusty that her father was a changed man. Dusty told Janet, \"I never meant to hurt you,\" and Janet nodded. She told Dusty that they could talk after she returned from getting some things for her dad.\n\n\nAfter Janet left, Dusty entered Rocco's room. Rocco said that he had tried to tell Janet everything, but she had shut him down. Dusty replied that was probably for the best, and he asked Rocco to tell him the name of the man who had shot him. Rocco said not only could he tell Dusty the man's name, he could also tell Dusty where to find the man.\n\n\nHowever, Rocco cautioned Dusty that Ralph Manzo had the man under his protection, and he said Dusty wouldn't be able to get near the man without setting off all kinds of alarms. Rocco got out of bed. Dusty tried to get Rocco to get back in bed, but Rocco reminded Dusty that he'd been cleared to leave the hospital, and he said he would find the man himself. Dusty told Rocco that he couldn't let Rocco do that alone, so Rocco asked Dusty to get him a shirt. Dusty said he would be right back, then remarked, \"Your daughter's just like you.\" Rocco said, \"Poor kid,\" and Dusty smiled and left the room.\n\n\nDusty and Rocco walked down a city street until they came to the location where Rocco thought Dusty's attacker could be found. Rocco was out of breath, and Dusty insisted that Rocco should call a cab and return to the hospital before Janet got back. Rocco said he wanted to finish what he had started. Then, Rocco pointed out the man they had been looking for and said, \"That's him.\" Dusty thought Rocco looked very pale, but Rocco insisted he was fine. He told Dusty to wait while he distracted the man, and Rocco walked toward the man and called out, \"Hey, Crowe!\"\n\n\nRocco told Crowe that he had the address of a new \"safe house\" for Crowe, because things had gotten too hot in Oakdale. Crowe took out a gun, shoved Rocco against the building, and told him that he wouldn't go anywhere with Rocco. Dusty ran up and knocked Crowe down; behind him, Rocco clutched his chest and lowered himself to the ground. Dusty wrestled the gun away from Crowe and managed to knock him out. Dusty stood up and called the police; he reported that the man who had tried to kill him was named Crowe and told them where they could find the man.\n\n\nWhen Dusty hung up, he saw Rocco and rushed over to him. Dusty shook Rocco and told him to hang on, because an ambulance was on the way. Rocco whispered that he always paid his debts, and Dusty said he knew that. When Rocco said, \"Tell Janet ...,\" Dusty shook him and said, \"I'm not telling Janet anything. You are!\" Rocco's eyes closed, and he slumped down, and Dusty was unable to revive him.\n\n\nAt the police station, Jack called to get an update on Rocco's condition, which had been upgraded to \"stable.\" When he hung up, he got a call from Carly, who told him, \"I need you to come home right now. It's an emergency.\" Jack asked what was wrong, and Carly simply said, \"Please; I need you.\" Jack hung up and asked someone to call dispatch to send a backup unit to his house immediately, then he rushed home. When he arrived, he found Carly in a negligee trying to explain to the two officers who were already there that there wasn't really an emergency. The officers left, amused, but Jack didn't find the romantic emergency very amusing.\n\n\nCarly explained that she hadn't realized Jack would call for backup and that she had merely wanted to get his attention away from work for a while. Carly pointed out that the two officers had thought it was funny, and she asked why Jack couldn't see it that way. Jack replied that he'd been in the middle of a case. Carly said she was pretty sure Jack had been working on finding out who shot Dusty, \"because even your work has to be about Janet!\" Jack told Carly, \"That's crazy!\" but Carly dropped her robe and said she thought it was crazy that Jack hadn't said anything yet about what she was wearing.\n\n\nJack told Carly it was more a case of what Carly wasn't wearing, and Carly walked right up to him and told him she thought it would be hard for him to stay mad at her. Jack agreed it might be difficult given the way she looked, but he warned Carly that she might have to convince Margo not to take his badge from him. Carly told Jack it was his own fault for making her work so hard just to get a little of his attention. Jack remarked that Carly had his attention at that time, and she said, \"We'll see about that,\" and kissed him.\n\n\nJack and Carly began flirting with one another, with Jack asking Carly if she knew what the police did with suspects like her. Carly wanted to find out, and Jack continued using cop terminology until he laughed and confessed, \"I'm running out of things to say!\" Carly said, \"It's about time,\" and kissed him passionately. They fell to the bed, and Jack began taking off Carly's clothes.\n\n\nSuddenly, the door opened and Janet walked in. Janet stopped and gasped, horrified that she'd interrupted Jack and Carly's moment of passion. She stuttered that she should have knocked, but Jack said it was okay and that he was sorry. Carly angrily asked Jack what he had to be sorry about, and then she asked Janet if she'd gotten an eyeful and whether that had been what she'd been hoping to see. Janet asked Carly what was wrong with her, and Carly said, \"You want to know what my problem is? It's you!\"\n\n\nJanet said she was very sorry. She explained that she was trying to get one of Jack's shirts to take to the hospital for her father to wear, and she hadn't thought Jack and Carly would be there at that time of day. Carly said Janet's problem was that she didn't think, and that she acted like Carly's house was her house and like Jack was still her husband.\n\n\nJack exclaimed that it had been an accident. Carly shouted that Jack shouldn't try to defend Janet, and she reminded him that Janet had walked into their bedroom while Carly had been alone with Jack. Carly thought Jack wanted her to put Janet's feelings ahead of her own, the way Jack had been doing, but she said she could no longer deal with Janet consuming every single second of Jack's day. Jack protested that Janet was having his baby, but Carly retorted, \"I know that, Jack, but guess what? I already did!\" She told Jack that if he couldn't draw the line, she would do it for him.\n\n\nJanet said she knew her presence was making things complicated for them, and she excused herself, saying, \"I'm just going to go.\" Carly asked, \"Why, so Jack can chase after you?\" She approached Janet and said, \"I may not have a sick kid, or a father who's in the hospital, or a fianc\u00e9 with a bullet wound in the back of the head, but I do have a life.\" Carly said that she had a right to spend time alone with Jack in the privacy of her own home without worrying that Jack's ex-wife was going to walk in on them.\n\n\nCarly and Jack went downstairs, and Carly said a double vodka would taste really good after all of that. Jack said, \"Go ahead. Why not?\" He said that Carly had \"broken every other taboo\" that afternoon, including going off on a pregnant woman. Janet entered the room and said she was headed back to the hospital. Carly stopped her and apologized for going off on her. Janet said Carly didn't need to apologize and that if the situation had been reversed, she would have reacted the same way.\n\n\nJanet said that Carly had put up with a lot, and Janet felt she shouldn't have moved in with Carly in the first place. Janet said it would be best for everyone if she and Liberty moved out. Jack told Janet that she should have a plan about where they would live, but Janet said she could take care of herself and that there would be less drama if she moved out. Carly thanked Janet for her honesty, but Janet replied that it was the least she could do, since Carly had been honest about how she felt.\n\n\nJanet told Jack she would return his shirt after she had it cleaned, and she left. Jack turned and said, \"There you go. You got what you wanted, Carly. Are you happy now?\" Carly stalked off to the kitchen and assured Jack that she wasn't happy. She again pointed out that she had put up with everything Jack had asked her to do for Janet's sake, but she drew the line at being interrupted in her own bedroom. Jack said he hadn't been happy about it, either, but Carly said she couldn't tell, because while Carly had been irate, Jack had been apologetic.\n\n\nJack said that was because it had just been a case of bad timing, but the result had been that Janet thought she couldn't stay there anymore. Carly exclaimed, \"Janet doesn't want to stay here!\" Jack insisted it was still the best thing for everyone, but Carly said he was the only person who saw it that way. Carly said she shouldn't have to schedule having sex with him, so Jack told her she was being selfish. Carly said that Jack needed to think about the fact that he was the only one who felt that Janet should stay. She said that it was becoming clear that Jack was more concerned with putting a roof over Janet's head than with exploring the reconnected relationship Jack and Carly had.\n\n\nJanet found Liberty at the hospital, where Liberty was waiting to see the oncologist. Janet was optimistic that the oncologist's news would be good. When Liberty seemed less inclined to be positive, Janet hugged her, then said she sometimes missed the \"good old days\" when it had just been the two of them. Liberty agreed that it was a little bit crowded at Carly's house.\n\n\nJanet said the best thing that had resulted from \"all this\" was her father's return and his genuine desire to make things up to her. Janet told Liberty that Rocco had apologized for the way he had treated both her and Liberty for years, and that he had asked her to forgive him. When Liberty asked whether Janet had done so, Janet said yes. Liberty asked how that had felt, and Janet said, \"Amazing, like I can't even describe it to you. And now, I'll finally be able to give you the family I always wanted, because I've got my dad back.\"\n\n\n",
