Holden wants to know if there is anything in the envelope which would upset Lily, and Jade tells him to look for himself.  There is money inside.  Jade wants to begin paying Lily back for her expenses, but Holden explains that no money Jade can give Lily can make up for the hurt Lily suffered by Jade's pretending to be Rose's child.\n\n\nAt the coffeeshop, Luke runs into Kevin and his new girlfriend.  Luke tells Kevin that he is with Jade now and that since Holden has calmed down, perhaps he and Kevin could start hanging out again.  Kevin says no; he has no time for Luke now that he has this new girlfriend. \n\n\nCasey and Gwen are working on putting together the music for Lisa's new club when Will and Maddie take a break from calculus and join them.  Several performers come to audition, and each one is worse than the last.  Casey and Gwen are discouraged and foresee many hours of work ahead of the two of them before the club opens in a week.\n\n\nCarly and Katie are at Carly's house and hear pounding in the basement.  Katie knows it is Mike down there searching for his stashed rubies.  She grabs Carly's hand and hustles her out of the house, but Carly wants to know why Katie is distracting her.  Parker and Hal show up to fetch Parker's bike for a ride with his dad the next day.  Unfortunately, the bike is stored in the basement where Mike is desperately trying to plaster over the hole in which he discovered the old skeleton.  Katie offers to take Parker down to get the bike which would give Hal and Carly a chance to chat privately.  Katie bribes Parker to stay upstairs and she goes down to get the bike and warn Mike that they are home.\n\n\nBack at the Snyders,  Holden  refuses to take Jade's money and worries how Jade is going to eat and get to and from work.  He gives her some of his own cash, which Luke sees.  Luke challenges Jade for taking Holden's $40. Jade realizes that Luke is upset and he tells her that he can no longer see much of Kevin, whom he loves.  He is discouraged that Kevin is straight and cannot return Luke's feelings.  Jade tells him to look around for someone new, but Luke is not interested.  Jade tells him how much she cares for him and kisses him.  Holden walks in on the end of the kiss as Luke is shoving Jade away.\n\n\nKatie takes the bike upstairs and tells Mike to keep quiet.  Parker wants his mother to join him and Hal on the bike ride tomorrow, but Carly tells the child it is his \"guy time\" with his dad.  Katie leaves and Parker says good night to Carly while Hal puts the bike in the car.  Suddenly Parker remembers he needs his bicycle helmet, too.\n\n\nThe music auditions are a bust so Gwen and Casey will be burning the midnight oil.  Neither Will nor Maddie is pleased about this, but they leave to resume their calculus studies.\n\n\nBack at home, Mike tells Katie that he could not find the rubies, and Katie keeps pushing him to tell her exactly what he did find.  He claims he found nothing but he is obviously upset.  He goes outside to get some air and flashes back on finding the skeleton.\n\n\nIn the basement, Carly and Parker are looking for his helmet and Parker notices the patch of wet plaster on the wall.  He asks his mother about it, but Carly chalks it up to residual moisture from the explosion of the hot water heater the day before.  Parker is not convinced and seems to have some of his psychic feelings about the wall.\n\n\n",

Kevin is aloof with him and tells him he is busy with his new girlfriend. Luke tries to hide his disappointment. Jade manipulates Holden into feeling badly for her; he ends up giving her some money for food and taxi rides to and from work. Luke sees this and tells her that he can't lie to his parents anymore. Jade wonders what is wrong and he admits to what happened with Kevin. Jade doesn't want Luke blowing their story out of the water and tries to convince him there could be other men to meet. When that doesn't work, she questions him whether he knows definitely if he is really gay? Then she tries another tactic. Maybe they should turn their lie into reality.
