Parker accused Craig and Carly of having engineered things so that Liberty would break up with him. Parker rushed off to find Liberty. Craig told Carly to let Parker go. \n\n\nLiberty went to the farm and told Janet and Jack that Parker had freaked out when she had returned home late from Chicago. Liberty said she couldn't live like that, and Janet told her she didn't have to. Liberty said that Janet had been right when she'd said Liberty and Parker were too young to get married. Janet told Liberty she was proud of her for making the decision to leave Parker. \n\n\nParker arrived at the farm, but Jack stopped him from going inside. Jack told Parker that Liberty didn't want to see him and that she wanted to end the marriage. Parker said Liberty was just confused because of Craig, but Jack said it had nothing to do with Craig. \n\n\nJack tried to make Parker realize that Parker and Liberty were too young to be married, but that one day, they might be ready to make an ironclad commitment to one another. Parker said he and Liberty had already done that, but Jack said the kids weren't old enough to honor that commitment yet. Jack suggested that Parker go home, cool off, and try to call Liberty later, but Parker left, angrily telling Jack that he didn't have to do what Jack told him to do anymore. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Craig thought things were finally going in the right direction, even though the situation was unpleasant. Carly was very worried about how upset Parker had been, but Craig said that although it might be painful, eventually Parker would get over it. \n\n\nAt the farm, Janet told Jack that she thought they should hire an attorney to arrange for a divorce or an annulment, but Jack felt there would be plenty of time for that later. Janet thought they should arrange it right away, but Jack was worried about Parker and said Parker would need help to deal with the situation. Janet said Parker would get help, but not from Liberty. \n\n\nCarly called the farm, and Jack explained that Parker had been there but that he had sent Parker back home. Carly was concerned that Parker wasn't back yet, but Jack said Parker probably just wanted to be alone. Carly didn't think that was a good idea, and she said she would go look for him. Jack pointed out that Parker was particularly upset with Carly and Craig, so Jack told Carly that he would go look for Parker instead. \n\n\nCraig tried to get Carly to relax a little and offered her a drink, but Carly reminded him that she had decided not to drink anymore. Craig apologized and said he had forgotten, and Carly said the last thing she needed was for Parker to return home and smell alcohol on her breath. Craig told Carly to take a few deep breaths, and Carly did, but she said it wasn't helping. \n\n\nCraig called Lucy and told her he was involved in a situation with Carly and couldn't pick up Johnny from Johnny's play date. Craig asked if Lucy could get Johnny instead, and she told him she'd be happy to do it. Craig hung up and told Carly he was all hers \"for the duration.\" Carly said she didn't know why that made her feel better, but it did. \n\n\nJanet arrived at Carly's with Liberty and told Carly that Liberty needed to get her things. Carly told Liberty to go on up and get them. When Liberty had gone upstairs, Carly told Janet that it would have been nice if she had waited, so that Parker wouldn't come home and find all of Liberty's things gone. Janet told Carly she thought it was best if it was all over quickly, because Liberty didn't need a confrontation. Carly wondered why Janet didn't care about Parker's feelings, and Janet replied that Parker was out of control. \n\n\nThe two women became emotional and angry with one another, with Janet blaming Carly for having been too drunk to notice that Parker had needed help. Janet said if Parker didn't come home, it would be because he couldn't stand to be in the same house with Carly. Carly told Janet that she had stopped drinking, and Janet said, \"So you're admitting that you have a problem.\" Carly said, \"I may have for a short time.\" \n\n\nJanet said Carly's drinking had messed up Parker, but Carly said Janet's daughter had messed him up and that Parker was better off without Liberty. Janet said Liberty was clearly better off without Parker, and then Janet went upstairs to help Liberty finish packing. \n\n\nCarly told Craig she couldn't stand to have Janet in her house. Craig said that Janet would be gone soon, but Carly said she was going to leave to find Parker. Craig said Carly was much too upset to drive, and he offered to go with Carly to look for Parker. \n\n\nMeg went to see Paul at Fairwinds and told him she wanted to move back in with him so that Eliza could be raised by both of her parents. As Meg explained her proposed marriage of convenience, Paul said that if he agreed, it would be on one condition: Meg would have to swear never to be with another man. Meg said she would do anything to be with Eliza again. Paul wondered what Dusty would think of Meg's proposal. Meg told Paul that if it would make him feel better, she would go tell Dusty that she had reconciled with Paul and that she would never see Dusty again. Paul suggested that Meg call Dusty immediately. \n\n\nDusty went to the Lakeview to visit Lucy to make sure she wasn't having any more trouble from the men on the docks. He warned Lucy to avoid doing business with men with guns, for Johnny's sake. Lucy told Dusty this would be her last smuggled shipment, and that from that point on, she would manage to get the needed medical supplies shipped out legally. As Dusty left, he got a call from Meg, who asked to meet him in the lounge at the Lakeview in five minutes. Dusty agreed and went downstairs to wait for Meg. \n\n\nParker wound up at the docks and saw the crates of Midnight Sun vodka ready to be shipped. He broke into one of the crates and took two bottles of vodka. Cesar, Lucy's contact, saw Parker and yelled at him, but Parker jumped on his bike and rode off before Cesar could stop him. \n\n\nJack arrived a few minutes later and asked Cesar if he'd seen a 16-year-old boy, describing Parker. Cesar said no, and Jack gave him a card and asked Cesar to call him if he did see Parker. Cesar then called Lucy and told her a boy had broken into one of the crates, and that afterward, \"that cop was here asking questions again.\" Lucy asked if anyone had seen the medical supplies, and Cesar said he wasn't sure. \n\n\nWhen Meg arrived at the Lakeview, she told Dusty about her plans to move back in with Paul and try to put her family back together for Eliza's sake. Meg explained that she and Paul had grown closer during Eliza's recent illness, and they had decided to make a new commitment to their daughter and to one another. Dusty said he wasn't buying Meg's story for one minute. Meg said she didn't care what Dusty chose to think, but she had wanted to let him know her plans. \n\n\nDusty asked how long Meg thought her arrangement would last, and Meg replied, \"Until I find a way to get rid of Paul for good.\" Dusty said Meg was in way over her head, but Meg told Dusty that he needed to stay out of it. Dusty said he couldn't let Meg go through with her plan, but Meg said she wasn't asking for Dusty's permission. Lucy walked up at that moment and told Dusty she had to ask him for a favor. Meg said she was leaving anyway, and then Meg told Dusty not to ever contact her again. \n\n\nLucy apologized to Dusty for having obviously arrived at a very bad time, but Dusty said he was okay and asked her what she wanted. Lucy told him there was a possible problem at the docks with the shipment, and she needed to go check it out, but she was also supposed to be picking Johnny up from his play date. Lucy asked if Dusty could pick Johnny up instead, but Dusty told Lucy he would go to the docks for her and let her pick up Johnny, because the dock situation might be dangerous. Dusty went to the docks and ran into Fredo, the man who had tried to extort more money from Lucy. Fredo and a partner began hitting Dusty and left him lying bleeding on the dock. \n\n\nMeg returned to Fairwinds, where she told Paul that she had made it clear to Dusty that she wanted nothing more to do with him. Paul said he didn't believe her, but Meg said she was sure Dusty had gotten the message. Paul said, \"Good. If I ever see you with Dusty again, I'll kill you.\" \n\n\nJack kept trying to reach Parker by phone, and Parker finally answered. Parker told Jack he just wanted to be alone. Jack said he could respect that and that he would call off the search for Parker if Parker would just assure him that he would be home by dark. Parker said fine and then hung up. \n\n\nJack called Janet to let her know that he'd gotten in touch with Parker and that Parker was okay. Janet told Jack that she thought Carly and Craig had gone to look for Parker. Jack told Janet to go ahead and take Liberty home, and he would deal with Parker, Carly, and Craig. \n\n\nCarly and Craig went to Old Town but didn't see any sign of Parker. Jack called Carly and told her about his phone call with Parker. Carly wanted to know what Parker had said, but Jack thought it would be better if they discussed it in person at the police station. Carly wondered if Jack just wanted to lecture her again on how she had ruined their son's life, but Jack said he didn't want to fight with Carly. Craig told Carly to go see Jack, saying he would continue to look for Parker, so Carly told Jack she was on her way. \n\n\nAt the police station, Jack again told Carly that Parker wanted to be alone. Carly said, \"He doesn't know what he wants! But I know him. He's at the lowest point in his life.\" Jack responded that the lowest point in Parker's life was when Carly had abandoned her kids to be with Simon Frasier. When Carly told Jack that was a cheap shot, Jack said it was also true, and he asked, \"Why else would a 16-year-old boy feel so insecure that he's got to get married to guarantee that he'll never be alone again?\" \n\n\nCarly went to Yo's and asked the bartender for a club soda. While the bartender was getting the club soda for her, Carly replayed in her head Janet and Jack's accusations that Parker's problems were Carly's own doing. When her club soda arrived, Carly asked for a glass of wine to help take the edge off. The bartender poured her a glass, and Carly drank it. \n\n\nParker threw away the first bottle of vodka after he'd drunk it all, and he began drinking from the second bottle. He stopped in the woods to throw rocks, shouting his anger at Craig, but as he bent to throw a second rock, he stumbled and fell, hitting the back of his head in the process. \n\n\nCraig found Parker's bike and began walking through the woods searching for Parker. He found the first empty vodka bottle, and then he saw Parker lying unconscious on the ground. Craig bent down next to Parker to try to awaken him, then realized that Parker's head was bleeding.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
