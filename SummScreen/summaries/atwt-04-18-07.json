    "soap_central": "\n\nLily sits in downtown Oakdale waiting for her mother who appears from her yoga class and asks Lily what she is doing there.  Lily asks Lucinda to listen to her but she declines until Lily says she has a full proof plan to get World Wide back from Craig.  Lily tells Lucinda that she is considering taking Craig's job offer at World Wide and being Lucinda's eyes and ears so she can wait for Craig to make a mistake and the two can retake the company.  Lucinda dismisses Lily's idea and says that she doesn't need her help and that Lily should be focusing on her family and Faith.  Lucinda also questions Lily's being a \"double agent\" while trying to quit taking amphetamines.  Lily claims she isn't taking them any longer, but Lucinda obviously doesn't believe her.  When Lucinda goes to leave, Lily asks her mother not to turn her back on her again and then goes into the litany of mistakes Lucinda has made that have affected Lily.  She then reminds Lucinda that she, Lily, has always forgiven her.  She tells Lucinda she doesn't understand why she can't forgive her this time.  Lucinda informs Lily that she wants her to focus on her life, her family and not World Wide.  When Lucinda walks away Lily stumbles upon a display for diet drugs and immediately goes into purchase the pills. \n\n\nFaith comes into the farmhouse kitchen and sees Vienna's discarded wedding dress.  She picks it up and looks at it dejectedly and then she tosses half of her lunch away.  She then begins to frantically rummage around the kitchen cabinet.  As she continues her search, Holden walks in and becomes suspicious of Faith and her excuse that she is just putting things away.  He offers to help her and as he looks in the cabinet he discovers laxatives.   Faith immediately says she was getting ready to throw them away, but Holden doesn't believe her and then goes to throw them out.  He stops and tells Faith, \"it doesn't mean anything if I throw them away\" and the two sit down and talk.  Holden asks Faith why she is doing this and she admits she did it to look good for the pep rally that Parker invited her to.  When Faith talks about just using the laxatives this one last time, Holden explains that these feelings of one last time will always be there.  He tells her that she needs to feel scared and nervous about things like the pep rally and that being skinny isn't going to make things easier or those insecurities go away.  Faith tells him he doesn't understand and that he loves her too much to see that she is \"the fat girl that everyone laughs at\".    Holden conveys to Faith the reason he fell in love with Lily is because she wasn't like everyone else and he wants Faith to be herself, his beautiful little girl.  Faith is touched by Holden's speech and the two hug.  Holden implores her not to do this to herself anymore.  Just as Holden convinces Faith to believe in herself and throw away the laxatives, Lily walks in and condemns Faith for having the pills.   Holden tries to defend Faith, but she runs out of the room with Holden and Lily following her.  When Holden returns to the kitchen to look for the therapist's card, Lily rushes in and tries to stop him before he finds the pills she purchased in her bag.  She is too late and Holden holds them up and asks her \"what are these?\".\n\n\nTom finds Casey begrudgingly studying statistical probabilities on the couch in the family room and drops a cheap shot about his lack of success at gambling and disdain for this particular subject.  Casey takes the joke at his expense and the two discuss Casey's impending trial and house arrest.   Casey asks Tom to speed up his sentencing because being at home and constantly disappointing him and Margo has helped him decide it is time to face the music and get his sentence started.  After Tom leaves, Maddie knocks on the door and confides in Casey about what Henry did to Vienna at the wedding.  Casey doesn't take the wedding debacle seriously and hugs Maddie as she tells him how much she wishes he could have been there with her.  Afterwards, Casey tells Maddie he asked his dad to move up the sentencing.   Maddie is sad about Casey's decision, but he explains that he is doing this so that in the end they will have all the time they want together.  As the two sit on the couch, they hear Tom and Margo approaching and Maddie runs out to avoid another run-in with Casey's parents.  When Margo and Tom come in, Margo tells Casey she knows what he has asked Tom to do and she hugs Casey.  As the two are hugging Tom informs them that Casey's sentencing has been rescheduled to tomorrow.  \n\n\nAt the station, Margo receives a visit from her sister Katie who wants to talk to her, but when Margo is pulled away by an officer Katie sees Jack's desk and remembers the kiss they shared.  Jack walks in and surprises Katie, who becomes flustered by Jack's arrival.  Jack asks if Katie has heard from Henry and she mentions that Maddie has called and says he is fine.  Katie and Jack agree that Henry was rushing into his marriage with Vienna and rushing into things is not a good idea.  Their conversation about Henry seems to be more about their kiss.  As they talk Jack touches Katie's face to access her injury from Vienna and remembers the time they spent together at the farm that lead up to the two kissing.   Katie becomes uncomfortable with talking to Jack and makes a hasty retreat by saying she has a meeting at the TV station.  \n\n\nKatie arrives at the station and finds Brad going through contest submissions.  When Brad shows Katie what he perceives as the winning letter, Katie lashes out at his choice because it is a \"blatant come-on\".  Brad quickly detects that Katie is angry after running into Jack and gives her a hard time about letting Jack get to her.  Katie tells Brad that he is wrong and to stay out of her personal life and chose a letter that actually involves a chore.  \n\n\n Back at the police station, Margo approaches Jack and asks where Katie went.  When Jack tells Margo that Katie left, but she wasn't making much sense, Margo asks him what happened between them at Henry's wedding.  Jack denies anything happened at the wedding, but Margo continues to push Jack about what is going on with Katie and he claims he \"wants a lawyer\".  Without admitting that he kissed Katie, Jack tells Margo that his life is too complicated for someone like Katie who would just make his life more problematical.  Jack tries to avoid any further conversation with Margo, but before he can leave to get \"the bad guys\" Margo tells him that he needs to go to a conference tonight in Chicago and asks him to finish up some reports.  Margo calls Katie and asks why she left so quick.  After giving the meeting as an excuse, Margo tells Katie to meet her at Al's Diner.  Alone at the station, Jack completes a report and thinks back on his kiss with Katie.  Just as he chides himself for acting like a teenager, Brad walks in and tells him he knows about Katie and what she thinks about Jack.  Brad tells Jack that Katie is with him because she feels guilty about her part in Carly leaving town and because Jack is similar to Katie's ex-husband, Mike.  In addition, Brad explains to Jack that he has just chosen another irresponsible blond to replace Carly.  Brad tries to convince Jack that he and Katie are just too complex to be together and Jack admits he maybe right.  Jack questions why Brad would even care what he does with Katie.  To this Brad claims to care because he likes his job and is worried that Jack having a relationship with Katie will end his career in television.  He also maintains that he wants Jack to be happy and he believes that this thing with Katie won't make him happy.  Jack takes Brad's advice and goes to the conference in Chicago as a timeout from Katie.  \n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Katie details for Margo the kiss at the farm.  She admits that she liked the kiss and is beginning to see Jack differently.  She continues on and claims to be confused because immediately following the kiss Jack became \"all Jack like\" and told her they shouldn't make an issue out of what happened.  Since Katie is so mystified by Jack's advances, Margo asks her what she wants.  Katie explains that she really likes Jack and doesn't want to hurt him.  When Katie tells her that may be the best way to assure that Jack won't get hurt is to drop the entire thing and just not talk about the kiss again, Margo urges Katie not to drop it, but to go forward and give herself and Jack a chance to be happy again.  After her lunch with Margo, Katie returns to the station and runs into Brad who tells her Jack has left for Chicago.  Katie asks Brad what he said to Jack and he claims that Jack just wanted to go to the conference for sometime alone.   Katie accuses Brad of trying to get between her and Jack and repeats her request to him to stay out of her life.  Alone, Katie wonders if she scared Jack off or if the kiss didn't mean anything to him.  \n\n\n",
