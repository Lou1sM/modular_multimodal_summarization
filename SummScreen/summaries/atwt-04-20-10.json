Until that happened, however, Craig needed to put another sizable expense on the debit card. He hung up when someone knocked on the door, and he was surprised to find that his caller was Parker. The boy declared that he needed to talk to Craig about his trust fund, and he reported that he had found a really sweet convertible at a local dealership.\n\n\nCraig stopped the boy at that point, ready to lecture him about his past follies, but Parker went on to say that he had really worked hard the last year to do the right things and be responsible, especially where Liberty was concerned. He said that when he had seen Gabriel's new wheels, however, Parker had been sorely tempted to blow it all. Therefore, the teen told Craig to shut down the debit account because Liberty was home and doing much better. Parker no longer needed access to ready money, and he wanted his trustee to make it as hard as possible for him to get to his money.\n\n\nA stunned Craig said that Parker was mature enough not to abuse the debit card, and he urged him to keep the account operational. Parker insisted that he just didn't want it, but Craig kept resisting. Finally Parker asked if Craig's attitude had anything to do with scoring points with Carly, and he went on to explain that his mother and Jack were back as a couple, even if current events had made things a bit strained. Parker then told Craig to forget about the debit card; he had decided to keep it.\n\n\nParker went home and found Carly upset. She explained that Janet's father had died suddenly, and her son's first thoughts were for Liberty. Carly said the girl wasn't home, so Parker explained that she had gotten really good news from the cancer doctor but had chosen to celebrate with Gabriel. Carly suggested that Parker find Liberty and give her the news about her grandfather, so Parker headed for Old Town.\n\n\nLiberty and Gabriel sat on a bench in Old Town, and Liberty was having a hard time realizing that she was finally through with chemotherapy. She asked Gabriel why he was acting so much like someone who cared about her, but he deflected her question by saying he had been thinking about how to celebrate the good news. He suggested they go to a club in Chicago, or if that was too far, to Canada. Liberty laughed and again asked the boy why he liked to hang around \"cancer chicks,\" and Gabriel answered that his mom had been one many years before, but unfortunately, she had never gotten an occasion to celebrate. Parker walked up then and told Liberty that they had to go home.\n\n\nAt the police station, Janet cried with Jack as Carly arrived. Carly said how sorry she was for Janet's loss, and she said Janet and Liberty were welcome to stay at her house as long as they needed to. Janet said she couldn't talk to Carly then, and she walked away. Jack told Carly that he had to help Janet sign some papers for the funeral home, so Carly asked him to call her when he could. Janet turned and asked Carly to \"just back off.\" She also yelled that Carly had gotten what she wanted, so she should let Janet mourn with her family, and Carly could \"gloat\" later. Jack asked Carly to leave, and Janet suddenly remembered that no one had told her sister about their father, so Jack suggested they go find Teresa.\n\n\nDusty went to Metro and fixed himself a couple of drinks. Teri walked out of the kitchen as Dusty downed his last drink. He realized that Teri did not know what had happened to Rocco, so he broke the news to her. Just then, Janet and Jack ran in, and Teri ran to hug and cry with her sister. The two of them decided that they should call their mother together, and then they went into the kitchen. Dusty began making inflammatory remarks to Jack, and he stopped Jack from going into the kitchen after Janet by reminding him that Jack had \"dumped\" Janet, and they had subsequently divorced.\n\n\nTeri and Janet returned, and Janet asked if Dusty had a problem. He said no, and he walked out. Teri defended Dusty, but Janet didn't want to hear it. Teri then scowled at Jack and asked why he was even there. She sarcastically referred to Jack as the \"husband of the year\" and reminded her sister that he had walked out on her. Jack spoke up for himself, but Teri wanted him to leave because they were dealing with a family problem, and Jack was not \"family\" any longer. Jack decided to leave, and he said goodbye to Janet.\n\n\nTeri and Janet could not believe that their father was gone, and then Teri told Janet not to blame Dusty for Rocco's stubbornness. Parker and Liberty ran into the club, and Liberty went straight to her mom. Janet talked to her about her grandfather and how much he had wanted to help Liberty. Then Janet remembered her daughter's doctor's appointment, and she asked for the results. Liberty said she was done with chemo, and her cancer was diminishing. Janet was overjoyed to have some good news for a change, and she hugged Liberty.\n\n\nTeri reached her mother by phone, and she promised that she and Janet would be traveling home within a couple of hours. Janet said that the funeral home would be taking Rocco back to Melrose Park. Liberty insisted on going with them, but Teri was disgruntled to learn that Jack would be driving them. When Janet went to freshen up, Teri told Liberty that Janet felt that Dusty was responsible for Rocco's death. Liberty took out her phone and began texting.\n\n\nDusty waited for an elevator at the Lakeview; the door opened and Craig stepped out. Dusty said he had been on his way to Craig's suite, so both of them walked to the front desk at the hotel. Dusty asked permission to pick up Johnny at school that day and take him for ice cream. Craig was quick to remind Dusty that it wasn't his visitation day, and then he asked Dusty what was wrong with him. \n\n\nDusty said that Rocco Ciccone had died, and at first Craig seemed sympathetic, but he quickly figured out that Janet blamed Dusty for her father's death. \"Well,\" said Craig flippantly, \"there goes your regular life and a chance to raise another man's son who isn't yours.\" Craig told Dusty to let Janet go, and the two men began to shout. Carly ran up and separated the two of them, and she warned Dusty not to take Craig's bait.\n\n\nCraig fired another barrage of insults at Dusty, until Carly spoke up and said she knew what Craig was doing. Her reasoning was that if Janet and Dusty broke up, then Jack would stick by Janet through the birth of the baby, and that left Carly ripe for Craig's picking. Dusty was unsettled, and he walked off. Carly continued to rip into Craig and finally called him \"a complete ass.\" Craig then changed tactics and began taunting Carly about how flaky Jack was. He stressed that, unlike Jack, Craig would always put Carly's happiness first. That shook up Carly, so she turned and walked away.\n\n\nDusty sat in the Lakeview bar and read the text message from Liberty. He quickly paid for his drink and ran out. Janet and Liberty stopped by Fashions to pick up something appropriate for the funeral, but Liberty saw Dusty arrive outside the shop, so she went out and let Dusty in. Janet turned around with her packages and ran right into Dusty. He admitted that Liberty had sent him a text saying that she thought the two of them should talk. \n\n\nDusty still wanted to marry Janet and raise their children together, but Janet maintained that everything had changed. Dusty said, \"Not everything.\" Janet admitted how obstinate her father had been, but she remarked that Dusty should have told her about Rocco's involvement with Ralph Manzo and his goons. Dusty asked to go with them to Chicago, but Janet said every time she looked at him, she saw her father.\n\n\nOutside, Liberty sat on a bench, and Parker spied her. They talked, and Liberty said that she had never tried to push him away. She apologized for going a little nuts when she had gotten the good news about her health, and she hugged him.\n\n\nWhen Carly returned home, she found Jack there alone. They talked about how difficult their lives were, but Carly hoped that while Janet and company were in Chicago for the funeral, she and Jack could have some time alone. Then Jack announced that he was driving the Ciccone family to Melrose Park because he really didn't have a choice. Carly struggled but managed to say that she could cope, and they kissed. \n\n\nJanet and Liberty walked in, and Jack took their luggage to the front door. Dusty appeared outside the door, so Jack let him in and asked Liberty to carry some light bags to the car with him. Carly also made herself scarce in the kitchen to give Dusty and Janet some privacy.\n\n\nDusty handed Janet a manila envelope that contained her dad's personal effects from the morgue. Inside, she found the St. Christopher's medal that he had worn every day, and Dusty put it around Janet's neck, in hopes that it would protect her. Jack and Carly said goodbye, and Dusty wished Janet a safe trip. Carly and Dusty were left alone, and she said that Janet would eventually get over her father's death. Dusty said he certainly hoped Carly was right.\n\n\nCraig picked up Johnny at school and took him home to their Lakeview suite. Craig heard a commotion outside his door, so he opened it and found Gabriel checking into the room next door. Gabriel announced that they were neighbors, but Craig told the boy not to get too comfortable in those quarters because he wouldn't be staying that long. Gabriel declared that was not too neighborly, as Johnny walked out. \n\n\nGabriel told Johnny that since they were neighbors, they could \"hang out\" a lot. Craig sent his boy inside and warned Gabriel that if he ever went near Johnny again, Craig would break him in half. Gabriel told Craig to \"chill,\" but Craig threatened him again and then slammed the door as he went inside.\n\n\n",
