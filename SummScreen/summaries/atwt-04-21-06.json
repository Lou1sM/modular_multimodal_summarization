He also says he has something for her and holds out a small box, and Carly strongly reminds him that she's not available and doesn't want his attention anymore. He tells her it's not for her, it's for Sage; she opens the box and finds a bracelet with a bell on it, which Nick tells her is so that she can hear Sage next time she gets lost. Carly breaks into tears and apologizes for having jumped to the wrong conclusion, but Nick tells her he understands and says he needs to be in Carly's good graces to help smooth things over with his coworkers down at the police station, who have all been shunning him lately. Carly calls Sage downstairs and has Nick give her the bracelet. Carly and Nick agree that they're on decent terms now, and they leave so Carly can take Sage to a play date.\n\n\nAt Mike and Katie's house, Katie wants to go to the police, but Mike wants to wait; then, Jack rings their doorbell and says he heard they were looking for him. Mike decides to tell Jack about the stolen rubies that he hid in the basement wall and about the fact that when he went to get them and turn them into the police, he found a skeleton instead of the rubies. Jack is upset to learn that this is in his house and that Mike didn't come to the police sooner. They call to warn Carly that they're coming over, but she has just left the house. When they reach the house, they go to the basement, and Jack begins breaking down the wall. Carly returns home and hears the noise and calls out to find out who's there; Jack asks Katie to go upstairs and explain things to Carly and make sure Carly and the kids get out of the house, so they won't see anything disturbing. However, when Carly sees Katie and finds out Mike and Jack are down in the basement, she storms downstairs; seeing the broken wall, she marches over and demands to know what Jack is up to, but as she approaches the wall, the skeleton tumbles out and falls on top of her. Carly screams and faints, falling into Jack's arms.\n\n\nAt the police station, Meg is brought back into the interrogation room, and while there, she overhears Henry, who has arrived to pay a traffic ticket. Meg confronts Henry and demands that he tell her how he got Dusty's bloody clothes into her car; he swears he never put anything in her car.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Hal runs into Margo and grills her about why Tom would have been questioning Emily; she reluctantly tells him the little she knows about the situation, while making it clear that she has no fondness for Emily, and they leave the Lakeview together.\n\n\nEmily is on the phone with Jennifer, who claims to have just received a phone call from Dusty saying he'd been kidnapped but had escaped; when Emily asks where Dusty is, Jennifer says the police are tracing the call, because they lost the connection before Dusty could tell her exactly where he was. Jennifer asks Emily to let Paul know the good news, and she hangs up. Paul comes out and asks Emily about the phone call; Emily lies at first and tries to leave, purportedly to go buy them some caviar for a celebration, but Paul receives a text message from Jennifer asking him to give her 15 minutes, so he tries to stall Emily. He ultimately gets Emily to admit that the phone call was from Jennifer, and Emily tells him what Jennifer had said about Dusty. She then says Paul should go wait with Jennifer until she gets more news, but Paul says he thinks they should go together or stay home together and wait to hear from Jennifer. Emily says she's going out on the terrace for a minute, and while outside, she calls Henry, who is at the Lakeview, and begs him to come help her distract Paul; Henry refuses and hangs up. When Paul sits down on the terrace and turns his back on Emily, she hits him over the head with a potted plant, knocking him out. She then takes off for the abandoned house where she has hidden Dusty, and Jennifer follows her there. Emily goes inside, and when she sees Dusty still tied up, she realizes that Jennifer is onto her. She unties Dusty from the chair, leaving his hands tied, and moves him to another part of the house, while outside, Jennifer calls Paul and tells him she managed to follow Emily. Paul tells her about Emily having knocked him out and warns her to be careful, but when he asks Jennifer to tell him where she is, they lose the connection. Jennifer tries to call him back several times, but she can't get through, so she goes inside the house and calls out to see if anyone is there; Emily, holding a gun on Dusty, warns him not to make a sound.\n\n\nPaul goes to the Lakeview to find Henry and becomes rough with him, demanding that he tell Paul where Emily is. Henry insists he doesn't know, and a policeman shows up and tells Paul to let Henry go. Henry thanks the officer for helping him, and the officer tells Paul he's under arrest, while Paul yells that Henry better not let anything happen to Jennifer.\n\n\n",
