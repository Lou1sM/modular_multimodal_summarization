Luke, however, was convinced that he needed to take some action, so he grabbed his keys and took off. Lily immediately decided to go with him, and they found Margo in the police station. \n\n\nLily thought Holden had gone there, and she was surprised that Margo had not seen him. Luke told Margo about Noah's kidnapping, and he also reported the phone call and text message, supposedly from his boyfriend. Luke also provided the ransom note, which Margo sent to the lab for fingerprint testing. \n\n\nIn Damian's hotel room, Holden accused Damian of capturing Noah. Damian vehemently denied it and offered to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence. Holden to, and the two of them left for the police station. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Casey dealt with a senior patient from the Bonny Meadows Nursing Home. The man's name was Stanley Pantleoni, but Casey shortened that to \"Mr. Pants\" for the sake of expediency. Alison entered the room, so Casey introduced her to \"Mr. Pants,\" who appeared to be a man of very few words. Casey asked if Alison was still angry with him because he had missed their lunch date, and Alison seemed more jealous of Jade than she was angry with Casey. They sparred until Alison walked out, angry again. The usually silent \"Mr. Pants\" called Casey a \"stupid kid.\" \n\n\nAt the storage locker where the Z twins were holding Noah captive, Zoe taunted Noah that no matter how uncomfortable his bonds were, they could not hurt as much as losing what was rightfully yours. Zoe prepared to leave to see how Luke was coming on collecting the ransom. Noah, left with Zac, made it known that he needed water, so Zac removed the tape from Noah's mouth and let him drink from a water bottle. Noah asked what Zoe had meant about recovering what was rightfully hers, so Zac explained that Damian had stolen the money for Luke's foundation from them. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Damian and Holden arrived, and Margo told Damian to wait in lobby while she took Lily, Holden, and Luke into the interview room. She told Luke and his parents that the last thing they should be considering was to pay the ransom money. She cautioned that giving in to the kidnappers would put Noah at greater risk. \n\n\nMargo suggested that when the kidnappers contacted Luke with the delivery instructions, he should attempt to keep the line of communication open with them. She advised him to get something from them before he handed over any money, such as proof that Noah was still alive. She told him to buy time so that the police could do their work. Luke agreed, and he went outside. Damian pled with Luke to let him help, but Luke only asked him to set Noah free. \n\n\nParked in the senior transport van, Casey told \"Mr. Pants\" that he had heard him call Casey stupid. Casey could get no further response from the man, so he carried on a conversation with himself about what it was like to be crazy about a girl who did not want to even talk to you. Casey said he really cared about Alison. Suddenly \"Mr. Pants\" reached over and snatched the van keys from the ignition and hurled them out the window, saying, \"Call your girlfriend.\" Casey instead called the old man crazy, but he eventually decided he had nothing to lose and phoned Alison. \n\n\nAlison was studying for a pharmacology exam, and when she answered Casey's call, she told him she had no time for him. Casey said he needed a favor; his car was stuck because \"Mr. Pants\" had thrown the keys into the woods. Alison said Casey had obviously confused her with a tow truck, but Casey said girls were much better at finding things. That irritated Alison more, so she suggested Casey call his good friend, Jade, for help, and she hung up on him. \n\n\n\"Mr. Pants\" indicated through gestures that Casey should call her back. Finally Casey gave in and made the call. When Alison answered, \"Mr. Pants\" grabbed the phone and yelled, \"Please help me! I need to get home!\" Alison, of course, agreed to come immediately, and \"Mr. Pants\" grinned at Casey. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Luke walked by Zoe, who was drinking a coffee outside. She asked him what was wrong, so Luke mentioned Noah's text and then told her of the kidnapping. Zoe was sympathetic as Luke regretted ever taking the Grimaldi money for his foundation. Luke was sure that Damian was behind everything, but the police had advised Luke not to pay the ransom. He said he only cared about getting Noah back. He mentioned that he had to go home, so Luke and his bodyguard left. \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo questioned Damian as to when he had last seen Noah. Damian answered that his theory was that another member of the large Grimaldi family was possibly involved, but he had no idea who. Holden mentioned the ring with the Grimaldi crest that Lily had found in her filing cabinet, and Damian spoke about the computer hacker whose screen name was something to do with fish. Damian became irritated with Holden's constant badgering, as Margo received the lab report from the ransom note. After reading it, she told Damian that his fingerprints were on the note, so she would be holding him on suspicion of kidnapping. \n\n\nAlison arrived at the senior van, and she and Casey searched for the missing keys. She wondered what Casey had talked about with \"Mr. Pants,\" and Casey replied that he had mainly talked about her. He said that he had told his passenger how he felt about her and said that the more he learned about Alison, the more he wanted to know. He said \"Mr. Pants\" had said he was stupid, but Alison replied that Casey was not stupid, but he sometimes did stupid things. She admitted that she was a mess herself and seemed to always find a lame excuse not be with Casey. \n\n\nCasey said he was willing to wait, and then Alison found the keys. They ran back to the van, but \"Mr. Pants\" was gone. \n\n\nZoe returned to the storage locker and demanded to see Zac outside. He followed her out, and she told him that Luke had not paid the ransom. She decided it was time to tell Luke where Noah was, and she asked for their captive's phone. \n\n\nLuke went home and reminisced about good times with Noah. His phone rang, and he read a text message: \n\n\n\nLuke dashed out the back way, eluding his bodyguard. \n\n\nHolden and Lily went to Java, and Holden crowed that he had known all along that Damian's prints were going to be on the ransom note. Lily claimed that Damian had been stunned when Margo said that, and besides, Damian was smarter than that. Holden was irritated that Lily was still defending her ex. Lily called Luke at home, but he did not answer. \n\n\nAt the storage locker, Luke sneaked in and spotted Noah tied to the post. He began to untie Noah's hands when the Zs walked in and welcomed him. Zoe pulled out a gun, and Luke rushed her, but Zac hit him, and they tied Luke to the other side of Noah's post. Luke realized that the Zs had left the Grimaldi ring in his mother's office, and that they were not twins. Zoe revealed that she was a Grimaldi whose money had ended up in Luke's foundation. Zac asked to speak with Zoe outside, so they left. \n\n\nCasey and Alison went to Milltown and ended up at Yo's looking for \"Mr. Pants.\" They found him inside enjoying a cheeseburger. They joined him, and when they were finished, Casey announced it was time to return to Bonny Meadows Nursing Home. Instead, \"Mr. Pants\" kissed Alison's hand and asked her to dance. \n\n\nThe song was an oldie, and Alison was hesitant, but she danced with him as Casey watched. Then \"Mr. Pants\" handed her over to Casey, and they enjoyed a slow, romantic dance. Casey said he was reluctant to take back their \"Fairy Godfather,\" but they had to leave. \n\n\nDamian told Margo that if they were dealing with members of the Grimaldi clan, it made sense that they would go after Luke. Damian had no idea who they might be, however, because there were too many branches and too much infighting. \n\n\nMargo received a call from Holden, who was in a bad state. He and Lily had gone home to find no Luke, but another ransom note instead. Margo advised them not to panic, but Lily lit into Holden over his obsession with Damian's guilt. Lily did not care who the kidnappers were; she just wanted the boys home safely. She vowed to pay the ransom, no matter what the police advised. \n\n\nMargo told Damian that Luke was also a prisoner, and he begged to help. He said she had no idea of the centuries of resentment in the Grimaldi family. He asked her to set him free so that he could save his son. \n\n\nLuke and Noah talked, and they solved their differences. Noah pointed out that Damian had been innocent all along, and Luke admitted he owed Damian an apology if they got out alive. The boys said how much they loved one another and linked hands around the post.\n\n\n",
