    "soap_central": "\n\n \nChris showed up at WOAK, per Katie's instructions, for a medical segment, but Katie wasn't there, nor was she expected that day. He called her cell phone, and no one answered, but Alison walked into the studio. She and Chris quickly figured out that Katie was playing matchmaker again, and Alison wasn't sure that Chris was innocent in the scheme. She said she was glad the two of them were friends again, but she had only agreed to appear on Katie's show because she felt they were providing a worthwhile public service. Chris got her to admit, however, that she was having fun working on the show. Alison said she hoped that the latest stunt wasn't just a ploy to get Alison alone, but Chris assured her it was not. Then he got an urgent page from the hospital, so both he and Alison left.\n\n\nIn the pediatrics ward at Memorial, Chris successfully diagnosed a child's allergic reaction just in time to save his life. Alison was pumped to see that and to be a part of it, and she told Chris how amazing he was. Suddenly, Chris leaned in to kiss her, but Alison pulled back and reacted badly. She scolded him, but he begged for a chance to explain. Chris said one reason he had returned to Oakdale was to see where he stood with Alison. She replied that she had hoped his feelings for her had disappeared, but then Chris asked what her feelings were for him.\n\n\nAlison reminded Chris that he had been her first lover, and he would always be special to her because of that. She also asked him to remember that every time they got together, they ended up hurting one another. Alison was concerned about how Casey would react to her having a boyfriend so soon after their breakup, but Chris said that unless Casey still loved her, he had no say in the matter. Alison refused to get involved, however, and she walked out.\n\n\nEmma bumped into Paul and Emily in Old Town, and she commented that the couple had been shopping at the children's store. Emily laughed and said that the point of having kids was to spoil them, but Emma warned, \"Eliza is not your kid, Emily.\" They all talked briefly about Meg, and then Emma walked on. Emily looked at Paul and said, \"She hates our guts.\"\n\n\nAt Deerbrook, Meg spoke with one of her doctors about her home visit with Eliza. She explained that she had chosen to keep the little girl at Fairwinds for the visit because her daughter was living there while Meg was hospitalized. Meg expressed the hope that she could go home for good soon, but the doctor's reply was vague. He concluded the interview and stepped outside Meg's room. He looked at her file and then punched a number into his phone.\n\n\nEmily's phone rang in Old Town, and she answered as Paul went to browse in the bookstore. The caller was Meg's doctor, who asked Emily for her take on how the home visit had gone. Emily said she was sure Meg had thought everything was \"peachy,\" but Emily had not been thrilled to return home and find Meg in bed with her husband.\n\n\nPaul walked out of the bookstore, but he couldn't find Emily. His mother approached, however, and she noticed the shopping bags and asked him why he hadn't called her to go shopping for Eliza with him. Paul said coldly that the thought had never entered his mind. Barbara said she was trying to \"reconnect\" with her family, and Paul let fly with a sarcastic remark, saying, \"That's great, Mom! Does that mean you're going to take off some time from boinking my baby brother?\" Barbara did not appreciate the remark, but Paul rebounded with a crack about \"Cougartown.\"\n\n\nBarbara defended her former relationship with Henry, but she declared that it was over and done with. She reminded Paul that they had both attended Henry and Vienna's engagement party, and Paul did a funny pantomime of a soused Barbara at the event. She dismissed her actions as \"a bad night\" and asked to see Eliza, but Paul told his mother she was \"too unstable\" to see her granddaughter. Emily joined them, but Barbara was hurt, and she walked off.\n\n\nPaul and Emily had lunch at Al's, and Emily said that her call had been from Meg's doctor, who had wanted to know how the home visit had gone. Emily said she had told the truth about Meg's crawling into bed with Paul, but that upset him. He felt Emily had blown it way out of proportion, and they argued. Emily thought that Meg still had a \"thing\" for Paul, but he denied it. Emily felt his ex still belonged in the hospital, and she confessed that she had a bad vibe about the path Meg was taking. Paul acknowledged that Emily had spoken truthfully to the doctor, and she had not thrown a fit when the incident had occurred. They kissed, picked up their packages, and headed home.\n\n\nMeg's doctor returned to her room and asked specifically how Meg had related with her former husband on the home visit. Meg assured him that things were great between them, even though their divorce had been nasty. She claimed that Paul had been a good friend since Meg's illness, and she said she was sincerely trying to be friendly with Emily for her baby's sake. Both of them were surprised when Emma walked into her daughter's room and announced that she was there to take Meg home.\n\n\nEmma said she no longer believed that Meg belonged in an institution because the moment she had left Deerbrook, she had crawled into her ex-husband's bed. Emma felt it would be wrong to keep Meg at the sanitarium even one day longer, and she wanted Meg home with her family and the chance to mother her little girl. Emma agreed to accept all responsibility for Meg, and she said she was signing her out immediately.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg introduced her mother to Taryn, Eliza's nanny. Emma declared that they were taking the baby on a \"girls' day out,\" but the nanny said Mr. Ryan had not mentioned that Eliza would be going out. Emma reassured her that all was well because the little girl would be with her mother and grandmother. As they were leaving, Meg was skeptical, but Emma convinced her that it was absolutely the right thing to do. They went to the farm, and Emma began plans for a big family dinner, since Meg had missed Christmas with the Snyders.\n\n\nWhen Paul and Emily got home, the nanny said Eliza was with Meg and her mother, so Paul and Emily dropped their parcels and ran out. They dashed into Emma's kitchen and saw Meg holding Eliza, with Emma also in attendance. Paul declared that Meg had had no right to take their daughter without his knowledge or permission, but Emma spoke up and said that Meg was the baby's mother and did not need anyone's say-so. She informed them that Deerbrook had released Meg, who was taking her life back, and that included living at the farm with her child. Paul said that Meg could live wherever she pleased, but Eliza lived with him. Emma declared that she was not comfortable with the two Ryans raising her granddaughter, and that caused Emily to snicker.\n\n\nEmma stated that she did not like that fact that a nanny spent time with and cared for Eliza, but Paul wasn't buying that. He said that, at the very least, he and Emily had deserved a phone call from them about their intentions, and Meg apologized for that. Emma was not pleased with the apology, and she stated that her daughter had been a healthy, strong, independent woman before she had gotten involved with Paul. She accused him of manipulating and using Meg, not to mention breaking her heart. She blamed Paul, not Damian Grimaldi, for Meg's hospitalization, and she swore that it would not happen to Eliza.\n\n\nEmma loudly proclaimed Eliza a Snyder, not a Ryan or a Stewart or a Stenbeck. Paul kept his cool and reminded her that he was the baby's legal guardian and parent, and he said he was taking his daughter home. Paul took the baby from Meg's arms, and he and Emily walked out, while Emma threatened that it was \"just the beginning.\" A hurt Meg asked her mother what she was doing, but Emma said she was doing what she should have done months before.\n\n\nKatie sat with Henry in the lounge of the Lakeview, and she was enthused about helping out with Henry and Vienna's wedding. She said it was tiring work, being a matchmaker and a wedding planner, but Henry thought all that was women's work. They both laughed at the memory of their wedding \"in a stinky gym,\" and Vienna walked in the lounge in time to see the two of them laughing over their memories. She stopped in the entrance and looked worried, but Henry spotted her and ran to lead her to their table.\n\n\nVienna was amazed at all the literature Katie had collected about dresses, venues, cakes, and all the other parts of a wedding. Katie said her sitter had to leave early, so she couldn't stay, but she left all the materials with them. Henry began to look disturbed, but he hugged Katie goodbye and sat with Vienna. She assigned him to check out locations, while she thumbed through a bridal gown magazine. Suddenly, she cried, \"Oh, my God! That's it!\" She declared that she had found her perfect wedding dress, and it would only need a \"few minor adjustments.\" She refused to show it to Henry, however, and she said she was prepared to fly to Paris or Milan or wherever the designer lived to have him make the changes.\n\n\nVienna checked further in the magazine and was astounded to find that the dress of her dreams was a \"BRO vintage dress.\" That meant that it was one of Barbara Ryan's original designs from her first couture venture. Vienna was amazed that she only had to take the elevator upstairs in the Lakeview to consult with the designer. Henry gave her a weak smile and tried to talk her out of wearing one of Barbara's designs. When that did not deter Vienna, Henry asked her to consult with Katie, but Vienna was not about to change her mind. Finally, when Vienna got out her phone to call Barbara to \"customize\" the dress for her, Henry offered to talk to Barbara instead, because, he said, they were almost like family, because of Paul.\n\n\nHenry visited Barbara and announced that there was a problem. He said, first of all, he couldn't \"stay gone\" from her without help. He explained that Vienna had fallen in love with one of BRO's first wedding gowns, and he wanted Barbara to convince her to change her mind. He said Vienna wanted only Barbara to modify the dress, and she surprised him by saying she was the best one to do it. \n\n\nHenry flipped out and was fearful that Barbara would become a large part of their wedding and their life afterwards. He struggled, but he finally told Barbara how much he missed her. Barbara got teary-eyed, but she explained that her run-in with Paul had been very hurtful. Henry took Barbara's hands and said that Paul was \"out of his mind\" not to want her in his life.\n\n\nVienna got an idea, so she left the Lakeview and went to Katie's. She walked in and said she had to talk about Henry. She asked Katie point-blank what had happened with Henry while she had been gone; she was fishing to see if Henry had acted on his longtime feelings for Katie. Katie explained how angry she had been with him after Brad's death, but in the end, Henry had been there for her, as always. Someone rang Katie's doorbell, and in barged Henry, who did not see Vienna and shouted, \"This is an absolute catastrophe!\" Vienna stepped forward and asked what he was talking about, so Henry hugged his fianc\u00e9e and pared down his catastrophe comment.\n\n\nHenry said that Barbara had refused to make the wedding dress, because she had moved on to another part of her business. Vienna was crushed, but then Katie asked them to watch Jacob so that she could run an errand, and she dashed out. Henry and Vienna sat there, and Vienna said she felt that something was going on that Henry should tell her about. Just then, Jacob began to fuss, so Henry ran in and carried him out. Vienna watched him holding the baby, and she felt sad for the loss of their baby. Henry snoozed as Jacob played in his lap, so Vienna walked out quietly.\n\n\nBarbara was sketching, and she fantasized herself as a bride again. A loud knock interrupted her reverie, and Barbara opened the door to Vienna. Vienna ran in and pleaded with Barbara to make her the most beautiful bride Henry had ever seen. Barbara said she didn't really do that anymore, but Vienna said that Barbara owed her for what had gone on between her and Henry when Vienna had been in Europe. Barbara agreed, and Vienna hugged her and asked if they could start right away. Barbara took her measurements, and Vienna asked her to make the waist a little larger, because it was likely that she would be pregnant with Henry's child by the time they had the wedding. Barbara looked shell-shocked.\n\n\nKatie saw Chris in Old Town, and she asked him why he wasn't with Alison. He explained abut the emergency in pediatrics, and then said everything had been great until he had tried to kiss Alison. He said unfortunately Alison couldn't get far away from him fast enough. Katie got upset that her matchmaking had failed, and she waved her arms in the air and knocked Chris's coffee drink all over the front of her raincoat. Chris had some napkins, and he attempted to wipe Katie down. He gave her a tickle by mistake, and she laughed and said that had been the most action she'd had in months. \"Me, too,\" quipped Chris.\n\n\nKatie took off her soggy raincoat, but it was cold outside, so Chris took off his jacket and put it on Katie. The two of them had long eye contact at that point, and then Katie said that Chris had rushed the kiss with Alison, but it was not a fatal flaw. They continued to share some sort of private connection, and Katie walked away, but she turned and looked back at Chris and smiled.\n\n\n",
