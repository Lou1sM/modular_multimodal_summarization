Alison lied to him telling him she went to bed early. Nancy was listening at the door and dropped her plate when she heard Alison lie. Later Kim told Nancy that she caught Alison at Metro and Alison lied to her about it. Kim was worried about Chris more but Nancy told her that it was Chris' choice and she shouldn't interfere.  Later, Nancy confronted Alison and Alison told her what she was doing. Nancy tried to reason with her but ended up keeping her secret- temporarily. She told Alison she wouldn't lie to Chris if confronted by him and warned Alison that no matter the reason, a lie is still a lie.\n\n\nBarbara was helping Jennifer get ready for her special dinner with Jordan when Walker appeared at the door with good news. Barbara gets to visit Will. Walker reinforced Barbara's agreement that she would call Ben Harris first thing in the morning. After Barbara saw Will she was very upset. She told Walker she felt so bad about what happened and wanted so much for him to get better. Walker said he would with time and to be patient. Walker then asked Barbara to have dinner with him at Metro. Barbara said, \"Are you asking me out on a date?\" and he said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\nOver in Rosanna's suite, Carly refused to help Rosanna unless she learned the truth as to what Rosanna was up to. Rosanna said she had to marry Jordan in order to get her son back. Carly tried to get Rosanna to tell her more but Rosanna said she would just have to trust her. Carly agreed to help her and Rosanna said they had to hurry before it was too late. Back at Barbara's suite, Jordan arrived for dinner and as he and Jennifer were getting close, Paul burst in wanting to know where Barbara was. Jennifer quickly got rid of him only to have Carly show up at the door claiming there was a 'crisis' at BRO. Jordan agreed with Carly that they needed to react to the 'crisis' so Jennifer and Carly left. Jordan's cell phone rang. It was Rosanna telling him that she needed his help with her car. Jordan arrived at the scene and Rosanna made up some lame excuse as she flirted with him. Meanwhile Jennifer and Carly returned to the suite because Jen forgot her cell phone. She checked her messages and when she hung up, told Carly she knew what Carly was up too. Back at the car, Rosanna faked falling and landed right in Jordan's arms!\n\n\nPaul ran into Hal and Emily at Metro. Hal started questioning Paul about the new additions at BRO. Hal was particularly interested in Jennifer's interest in Jordan. Paul admitted that he and Jordan did not get along but he would tolerate him because Barbara depended on Jordan so much. Paul also admitted that things had really changed between them since Will went away. Hal agreed that he thought Paul was not as angry anymore. Paul went looking for Barbara and when he called her cell phone Walker answered. Paul became more suspicious when Walker lied to Paul about being at Metro.  Paul went back to Metro and when he didn't see Barbara there, he wondered what she was up to this time. When they arrived at Metro, Paul was there to greet them and confronted his mother.\n\n\n",
