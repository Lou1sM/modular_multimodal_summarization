Chris asked about the money Dusty had left for Alison's education in his will, and Alison said she still needed a signature on her paperwork from either her mom, who was away doing remote medical work, or Emily, to whom she wasn't speaking. Chris said it was too important to let a family squabble get in the way, and he took Alison to see Emily. \n\n\nCasey told Margo he'd been fired from his job tending bar at the Lakeview. Margo suggested this would be the perfect excuse to go back to college, but Casey disagreed. Emily arrived to meet with Tom about summer camp for Daniel and was upset when Margo told her that Tom had to leave early for a meeting with a client. Margo suggested Emily send Tom an e-mail or call him, but Emily said she'd brought material to the house for Tom to look over. Margo told Emily to leave Tom a note and left for work. \n\n\nCasey had a pleasant conversation with Emily, who ended up asking him if he had any office skills. Casey said he could type, so Emily told him that since her assistant had quit the day before and she needed a new one, Casey could have the job on a trial basis. She told Casey to be at Worldwide half an hour later. \n\n\nAt Worldwide, Emily showed Casey the phone and contact list and asked him not to disturb her for a couple of hours. She went into her office. Chris and Alison came in and were surprised to find Casey there. Casey told them he was the new administrative assistant. Alison asked to see Emily, so Chris went into Emily's office to let her know Alison was there. Emily asked if Alison was alone, and when Casey told her that Chris was with Alison, Emily told Casey to lie and say she wasn't available. Instead, Casey returned with the paperwork that Alison needed signed, and Emily eventually looked to see what it was. Emily was pleased to see the nursing school admission paperwork, so Casey said he would send Alison in. Emily said she would only see Alison if Chris left. \n\n\nCasey told Chris and Alison what Emily had said. Chris pushed his way past Casey and went into Emily's office, demanding to know why Emily was treating her sister that way. Chris said Emily's problem was with him, not Alison, and she shouldn't take it out on Alison. Emily called Casey in and told him to kick Chris out of her office, but Casey said that wasn't necessary, since they had both agreed on one thing: Emily was going to deal with Alison, alone. Chris agreed and told Alison to go talk to Emily and call him later. \n\n\nEmily signed Alison's paperwork for nursing school and told her she was proud of her. Alison thanked her and gave her a slight smile before she left. Alison went to the Lakeview and found Chris and told him she'd gotten Emily's signature and that Emily had said she was proud of her. Meanwhile, Casey told Emily he could see why her assistant had quit, because there was so much drama in her office. Emily told Casey to quit if he wanted to, but then she said she would like him to stay. Casey came back into Emily's office later to find her banging on her laptop, which had gotten stuck. Casey fixed the laptop, and Emily asked if that meant he was staying. He said he would have to, since Emily obviously couldn't manage without him. \n\n\nAt the farm, Lily told Holden she'd realized he'd been right about Carly and Jack, that if they were meant to be together, they would find their way back to each other, just like she and Holden had done. Holden then showed her Dusty's cassette tape and sweater that she had hidden from him. Lily said she wanted to keep just a couple of things to remind her of Dusty. Holden asked why she'd hidden them from him, and Lily said she hadn't been hiding them. Holden asked Lily why she was still lying to him. Lily said she'd wanted to make Holden happy, and she knew he'd rather she'd gotten rid of all of Dusty's things. Lily said she lied because she'd done so many things wrong, hurting herself and their family, that she was afraid of making even one more mistake. Lily asked what she could do to make things better, and Holden told her he wanted her to be able to make a promise and keep it. After assuring Lily that he didn't want a divorce, Holden said Lily would have to find a way to change, or they would risk losing everything. \n\n\nHolden left, and Lucinda arrived at the farm. Lily told her mother that she and Holden had agreed Lily needed to do something to change, to make it seem as though she still trusted Holden. Lucinda asked if Lily did trust Holden, and Lily replied that she didn't trust him not to leave if she did or said something unforgivable, so she had been trying not to upset him, instead of just being herself. Lucinda suggested that Lily take some time away from the family to rediscover herself and get away from the stress she'd been under. Lucinda said Lily could visit Iva, her birth mother. Lucinda thought the time away might give Lily the perspective she needed. \n\n\nHolden came back to the farmhouse and found Lucinda on the porch. Lucinda told Holden that Lily had decided to go spend some time with Iva. Lucinda left, and Holden went inside the house. He found Lily writing a note. She told him she'd written just 2 words in her note, and he joked that she hadn't been able to get past \"Dear Holden.\" She said she'd written what he'd asked for: the truth. Lily asked if he was okay with her going away for a while, and he said it stunk for him, but it was probably best for her. As Lily went to leave, Holden said, \"Come back to us.\" Lily walked out, and Holden sat down to read the note, which read simply, \"Love you.\" With tears in his eyes, Holden looked up and said, \"Love you, too.\" \n\n\nLucinda accompanied Lily in her limo on the way to Iva's. Lily worried about what might happen if she came back and screwed up yet again. Lucinda said it wouldn't happen, that Lily would take the time she needed to get herself back together again, and when she returned, she would be fine, and it would be Holden's turn to fall apart, and Lily's turn to put the pieces back together. \n\n\nAt home, Carly told Jack she'd decided she wanted him to move out. He said he had told the kids he would stay for the sake of giving them some stability, but Carly said that wasn't a good enough reason anymore. Carly told Jack that he was disrespecting her by making her look bad in front of the kids, and she didn't want that. She said she was making herself \"smaller and smaller\" to try to avoid doing something to displease him, and she couldn't keep doing that. Jack said the kids needed their family whole, but Carly said this wasn't good for any of them. \n\n\nJack asked when Carly wanted to tell the kids this news. Carly suggested after school, but she said she wanted Jack packed up and gone before then. Jack packed and left, after telling Carly goodbye. Jack went to the police station, where he asked Margo for some time off that afternoon. Margo asked what had happened, and Jack told her. He admitted it hurt more than he had thought it would. Margo asked what Jack would do, and he said he supposed he would move back to the farm. Margo suggested that wasn't a permanent solution. Jack agreed and said he supposed he should build a new life, but for the first time in a long time, it would have to be one that wasn't all about Carly, and he wasn't sure how to do that. \n\n\nCarly went to the farm and saw Holden and how upset he appeared to be. Holden asked what Carly needed, and she said she'd just wanted to see Lily, but she would come back later. Holden told her that Lily was gone, and he told her that Lily had just needed to go away for a while. Holden turned back to look at the note again, and Carly reached out and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Carly told Holden to try to think of Lily's leaving as a good thing, because Lily wanted to be the best she could be for him and her kids. Holden said he knew that. He asked about Carly and Jack, and Carly told him it was over for good. Holden asked if there was anything he could do. Carly asked if he could stick around, since everyone she leaned on seemed to be leaving. Holden reached out and took her hand. \n\n\nBrad woke up to find Katie ready to make love again, but he stopped when he realized he was out of condoms, which surprised Katie. She asked why it would be a bad thing if she became pregnant, now that they were married. Brad said he thought they should take some time to get to know one another better as a married couple before having a baby. Katie reminded Brad that they'd been \"friends with benefits\" for months before they fell in love, and Brad said that was the problem: they had done things backwards. Brad said they should start their new life together with just the two of them. Katie asked if Brad was saying they should start at the beginning, and Brad said yes. Katie then introduced herself, and when Brad went to kiss her, she told him she didn't sleep with guys she'd just met. \n\n\nKatie went to the police station to tell Margo she'd been right about Katie rushing into marriage to Brad. As she began to fill Margo in, Brad walked in and told Katie she was coming home with him. Katie said she was going to stay and talk to her sister, but Brad said Katie was going home with him, and he picked her up and carried her out, as Katie protested to Margo to stop Brad. \n\n\nBack in their suite at the Lakeview, Katie told Brad she would never forgive him for carrying her around like a sack of potatoes. Brad said he didn't want Katie running to someone else to solve their problems. He said that they were married, and if Katie had a problem, she needed to discuss it with him, so they could work it out together. \n\n\nBrad sat Katie down and asked her to tell him exactly why she was upset. She told him that even though she'd been married several times, she'd never had the whole package. With Simon, there had been fun and excitement, but she had worried it would end, which it did. With Henry, there had been support and friendship. With Mike, there had been stability, but she had missed the excitement. And with Jack, she had needed him to love her more than he had loved Carly. Katie didn't want to find out she'd made another mistake with Brad because he no longer wanted kids. Brad said he'd never said that. Brad told Katie he wanted the same things she wanted, the whole package. He said that he saw their new life as if they were sitting down to the best meal ever, and he didn't want to rush through any of it but instead take it one course at a time, so they could enjoy all of it. When he asked what Katie thought about that, she kissed him. \n\n\n",
