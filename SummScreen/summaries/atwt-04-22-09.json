    "soap_central": "\n\nAt WOAK, Katie began a broadcast of \"Author's Corner\" with psychic Myra Haft. Katie introduced the woman who claimed her psychic specialty was unborn babies. She said she could sense when a couple was expecting, the sex of the baby, and sometimes she could identify reincarnated spirits. Katie mentioned that she was going to become a mother by using a surrogate, and at the end of the segment, Brad appeared. Katie introduced him to Myra, who promptly declared that Brad was not the baby's biological father. \n\n\nBrad said he had the doctor's bills to prove it, and the psychic backed down and admitted that she could be wrong. Katie told Brad, however, that Myra's success rate was off the charts, but Myra diplomatically said that she needed to see Brad and the surrogate mother together to get an accurate reading. Katie immediately invited her for a drink, and said it would be a good chance for the woman to meet Vienna. \n\n\nVienna was shopping for maternity clothes at Fashions with Henry, who was bored, so he suggested that he go to Metro and help out. Lisa, who was helping Vienna, commended Henry for allowing Vienna to carry another man's baby. Vienna came out of the dressing room looking gorgeous in an upscale maternity gown, and deep lust overcame Henry. He hustled her back into the dressing room, and he and Vienna began to make love. \n\n\nHolden pulled the phone from Lily's hand after she threatened to pay the ransom for the boys in spite of Margo's advice. They argued about whether Damian was involved in the kidnapping, and Lily got hysterical. Holden brought her a glass of water, and he left her to go speak with some of Luke's friends. Lily waited until Holden was out of sight, and then she grabbed her purse and left. \n\n\nMargo continued questioning Damian at the police station, but she was not getting much from him. He wanted to leave so that he could use his contacts with the Grimaldi family, but Margo was not convinced. Lily showed up and asked to speak privately with Damian. She said she had decided to pay the ransom and wanted to be prepared. \n\n\nShe told Damian that Holden disputed that, and for once, Damian agreed with him. Damian was afraid that the kidnappers would not want to leave any witnesses, and he feared for the boys' lives. He begged Lily to get Margo to release him, and then he got an idea. \n\n\nKatie, Brad, and Myra went to Metro, expecting to find Henry and Vienna, but the couple was not there. Katie wanted to wait and get Myra a drink, while Brad called Henry. Brad made the call, but he got Henry in the throes of love in Fashion's dressing room. Henry promised to be there soon. \n\n\nWhen Henry and Vienna exited the dressing room, Lisa teased them about being \"so hot.\" She packaged up Vienna's purchases, and the two went directly to Metro, where the psychic, Myra, said she felt immediate vibrations from Vienna's baby. \n\n\nSuddenly Myra looked perplexed, and she said she could not stay. Katie clued in that the woman had sensed that something was wrong, and she pressed Myra to tell them what she had felt. Myra was hesitant to speak out, so Katie, who had read the psychic's book, suggested they use Tarot cards to predict the future. Henry tried to nix that, but Brad supported Katie, and Myra dealt the cards. \n\n\nHolden arrived at the police station and spoke with Margo. He burst in on Lily and Damian and scolded Lily for not staying at home. Margo advised them not to be so hard on each other, and the two of them went home. Holden accused Lily of lying to him, and the old argument continued. Holden went into the kitchen to make tea, and Lily looked around outside and discovered an envelope bearing her name. The note inside instructed her to wrap the ransom money in newspaper and await further instructions. \n\n\nHolden brought in tea and cookies, but Lily was frantic that she would lose Luke. She asked Holden to make some sandwiches instead, and when he returned to the kitchen, she dashed out with the note. When Holden returned, he found the living room empty. \n\n\nVienna began the tarot reading, and displayed her card, which was the Empress, who heralded the birth of a child. Katie went next, and she drew the Lovers card. Brad got the King, the sign of a seducer, which produced some laughs. Henry revealed the Fool, who stood for new beginnings and was, according to Myra, almost always hiding something. Henry fibbed and suddenly remembered that he and Vienna had to work at Al's that night, so they hurried out. \n\n\nKatie asked Myra if there was anything else she wanted to tell Katie, but the woman told Katie to trust her own instincts. Katie was still worried about the baby, and she asked Brad if there was anything in his genetic background that could create a problem for his baby. He could think of nothing, and Katie knew her genes were good, so they decided to go ask Vienna if she would submit to some genetic testing to put their minds at ease. \n\n\nLily went to the Lakeview and found Lisa. She wished to speak to the head of security at the hotel, but he had gone for the evening. Lily wanted to look at security tapes that showed everyone who had entered Damian's room in the days before the first ransom note. Lily confided in Lisa about the kidnapping, and Lisa cooperated by retrieving the tapes. Lily also hoped to find something on them to prove Damian's innocence. \n\n\nLucinda paid a visit to Holden and asked to have the younger children at her house for a while to give Emma a break. Holden did not want to upset Lucinda, who was having more radiation treatments, but Lucinda would not be put off. They talked about Damian's elusive phantom relatives whom Damian blamed for all their troubles. \n\n\nLily took a couple of the surveillance tapes to Margo and showed her a shot of someone going into Damian's room at the hotel. They could not tell if it was a man or a woman, however. Damian looked at the tape with them, but no one could identify the person. Margo began to realize that Damian was not as involved as she had first thought, so she released him, but told him not to leave town. After they left the station, Lily showed Damian the newest ransom instructions and said that if Damian could not figure out who had taken the boys, she would pay the ransom. \n\n\nAt Al's, Myra showed up to talk with Vienna and Henry. She said that sometimes the cards told her more than she wanted to know, but she often chose to be discreet. She reminded them that secrets had a strange way of revealing themselves. After Myra left, Henry told Vienna that they had to tell Brad and Katie the truth about Henry being the baby's biological father, but Vienna said they would be devastated. \n\n\nKatie and Brad walked in and said they had to ask a favor. Katie requested that Vienna take a genetic test so they could find out if either of their families had problems. Henry thought that was good idea, but Vienna said, \"No way!\" Vienna finally agreed if the doctor said the tests were safe. After the Snyders left, Henry said that the test was the perfect vehicle for Brad and Katie to find out that the baby was Henry's. He suggested that he and Vienna act surprised and to let the doctor be the bearer of bad tidings. \n\n\nLily went home to find Holden fixing Ethan's toy truck. Lily said she was tired of arguing, but that they needed Damian and his resources. Holden could not bring himself to trust Damian, and he truly feared he would lose Lily because of Damian. Lily promised to be safe and to keep no more secrets from her husband. To prove that, Lily handed over the most recent ransom note. Holden felt that Margo needed to see the note, so he left to take it to the police station. After Holden drove away, Damian rang the bell and told Lily that he thought a hunch of his had paid off. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Lisa shared a scrapbook that had belonged to Eduardo Grimaldi, her late husband, with his cousin, Damian. The book contained old newspaper clippings about long-ago Grimaldi family events. One in particular mentioned the murder of a woman claiming the Grimaldi fortune. \n\n\nNeither Lisa nor Damian recognized the woman from her picture, but Lisa did notice that the woman wore a fish pendant around her neck. She pointed it out to Damian, who identified the symbol as the zodiac fish sign. They decided that Noah, who was working on identifying the hacker who had used the fish sign as a screen name, had stumbled upon something dangerous. Damian clipped out the article and left hurriedly. \n\n\nBack at Lily's, Damian said he had a lead on the kidnappers, but he insisted that Holden not know. Lily said she would not break her promise of no more secrets, but Damian said that she had until the next ransom note to decide if Luke's life was worth risking her marriage.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Henry becomes surprisingly turned on by Vienna, as she tries on maternity clothes. A psychic's comments make Katie wonder about the baby, as well as her comment about Brad not being the baby's father. Katie asks her to meet Vienna and Henry, who are none to pleased with the psychic's comments hitting too close to home. Katie obsesses with what is going on and what might be wrong with the baby. The psychic does a reading, which is dead on with what Henry and Vienna are going through unbeknownst to Brad and Katie so much that Henry and Vienna make excuses and make a bee line for the door. Later, when Katie can't let this bad feeling about the baby go, Brad suggests that they could have Vienna tested for any genetic problems. Meanwhile, the psychic makes comments that are more telling when she sees Vienna and Henry alone later. Her comments cause Henry to think they should tell the truth. Katie and Brad ask Vienna to have genetic testing done and she doesn't want to, but Henry thinks it is a good idea so Vienna is forced to go along with this. Henry thinks it will be easier on Brad and Katie to learn the baby is his if it comes from a doctor and that way they won't think they have been lying to them for weeks. Vienna is very unsure and thinks the news will devastate Brad and Katie. Lily and Holden continue to argue about her defending Damian, as she doesn't care right now if he is involved; she just wants Luke and Noah home. Lily receives instructions about where to leave the money, as she doesn't tell Holden but instead goes to see Damian. Damian asks Lily for help to get out of jail so he can help find Luke. Holden finds Lily with Damian and is furious. Lily later goes to look at security footage of the hall outside Damian's room to see if someone broke into his room to use his stationary in order to set him up. Lily shows Margo evidence that someone let themselves into Damian's room and Margo lets Damian go. Damian promises to find Luke, as Lily heads back home to face Holden again. They finally reconcile, as Holden just doesn't want Lily to keep any more secrets from him. Lily uses this opportunity to tell him about the note. Holden agrees to let her use Damian as a resource after that. Holden and Lily agree to have him go show Margo the note too in case she has any thoughts. Lisa shows Damian some newspaper clippings about a murder connected to the The Grimaldi fortune; Damian notices the Pisces necklace and now knows there is a connection. He rushes over to tell Lily, who wants to include Holden in this information, but Damian tells her that Holden will not let them do what needs to be done in order to catch these people. Lily explains that she made a promise and doesn't want to go back on it. Damian tells her that she has the night to figure out which is more important her promise to Holden or their son's life.",
