The Dr. says that they will have their work cut out for them.  Jessica has gone off track with her monthly cycles and stress has probably added a factor also.  The Dr. suggests a schedule  to follow for the time being.  They will proceed with whatever is necessary.  Jessica tells Ben that this is her fault and it might be her last chance to get pregnant.  Jessica is handed a letter by Ben from the Bar Association.  She has been reinstated to the title of Attorney.  She is pleased but not elated as she has another agenda on her mind.  Ben thinks they should celebrate and decides to take her out to dinner.  Doc is conversing with another woman and the woman says that Jessica is a well known attorney.  She takes high profile cases and comes out a winner.  The woman says if she ever needs someone to defend her, that's the woman she would pick.\n\n\nDoc says that Jessica is probably all business, with wanting things, to think about having children and a family.  Jessica overhearing this, becomes flustered.  Ben, approaching his wife and seeing her upset leaves with her to go elsewhere.\n\n\nJennifer and Carly talk.  Jennifer figures out it's Jordan that Carly wanted out of the dinner, not her.  Carly apologizes to Jennifer wanting to smooth things over.  She did not want to ruin her evening or so she says.\n\n\nRosanna has called Jordan using a tactic to bring him to her.  She has driven her car somehow into a ditch, and desperately needs his help.  She doesn't want him to call for any help though, it could bring unwanted publicity.  He does what she asks and goes to where she is to offer help.  While together, he asks for her assistance and it evolves into a fun mud fight for the both of them.  Jordan tells Rosanna that he called Jennifer and she is on the way.  Carly and Jennifer arrive.  Jen tells them that all is well, help is on the way and not to be concerned with publicity, 'cause she took care of it all.  Everything solved, Jennifer asks Jordan if they can get back to their dinner plans now and he agrees.\n\n\nBarbara and Walker are together talking and Paul feels there is something going on between them.  The Dr. covers for Barbara's headache and tells Paul he must respect Barbara's privacy as he requested she do for him.  Otherwise, he would have to deal with him.  Barbara tells Walker the pain has now subsided.  He says the pills he gave her will only mask the symptoms.  She has a tumor and she needs to take care of it.  She had promised that if he let her see Will, she would agree to see Ben.  Barbara agrees to see Ben the very next day.  Walker tells Barbara he wants to keep her company for awhile.  They share a cup of coffee.  He doesn't understand her putting her life at risk but, he enjoys her: a Mother, designer, head of a corporation.  Barbara wants to know what he wants with her.  Walker says, she is strong, challenging, and wants to explore the feelings he is having about her.\n\n\nBack at the apartment, Rosanna tells Carly she enjoyed being with Jordan.  Even though she has to marry him, she finds she likes the guy.  Carly says that's a good sign.\n\n\nPaul is discovering some things and doesn't like what he is finding.  He goes to the apartment looking for Barbara and finds it empty.  Looking around, he discovers Barbara's paperwork sent to Jordan to authorize.  Now he wants to know why Jordan is authorizing purchases for Barbara.  Why wasn't he notified?  Finding Jordan, he tells him that he thinks he is making himself indispensable to Barbara.\n\n\nJordan tells Paul he is just doing what is asked of him and no more.  Paul calls Barbara, and he wants to talk to her face to face, now, at home.  Barbara tells him she is on her way.  At her arrival, Paul opens the door for his Mother.  He tells her he knows what she is doing.\n\n\nJennifer is fishing for tidbits about Rosanna. Jordan says they are just neighbors.  Jennifer is glad to hear that because she has something to tell him.  She tells Jordan that she did not like him in the beginning because she felt that she was left out of the loop, and he comments that sometimes Barbara has a tendency to do that with people.  However, says Jennifer, now, things have changed.  Jennifer reaches over and kisses him.\n\n\n\n\n",
