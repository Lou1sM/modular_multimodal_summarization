Her questions led Casey to believe that Margo was worried Emily would try to seduce Casey or use him to come between Margo and Tom. Casey was offended by his mom's questions, but Margo explained that Emily was filled with secret agendas and she was worried that Emily was using Casey. Casey was upset that his mother didn't think he was hired because he could do the job and reassured Margo that Emily wanted nothing to do with her and Tom. \n\n\nEmily was working hard at The Intruder when Paul arrived and wanted her help with his love life. He asked Emily to drop off an anonymous love letter at the Lakeview for Mike. Emily jokingly questioned if Paul was in love with Mike, but Paul explained that he hoped the letter would stop Mike from making any further romantic gestures towards Meg. Emily agreed to drop off the letter and call Paul once Mike read it. \n\n\nEmily looked on as Mike returned to his hotel and was given the envelope by the front desk clerk. Mike read the letter and thought it was from Katie. The letter said that she had made a big mistake and asked him to meet her at the farm. Mike rushed out to find Katie and Emily phoned Paul to tell him the note had been delivered and Mike was on his way. \n\n\nWhen Emily arrived back at her office, she was greeted by Margo, who warned Emily to stay away from Casey. Margo accused Emily of wanting to bed Casey, but Emily said Casey was \"just a kid\" and their relationship was strictly professional. Emily reminded Margo that Casey was an ex-con and she should be happy he had a good job. Margo pleaded with Emily to fire him, but she refused and told Margo that she hired Casey to be nice and all Casey wanted to do was make Margo proud. Margo told Emily that she was quitting for Casey, but Casey had arrived and overheard his mother and told her it wasn't her decision to make. Casey told his mother she had no right to be there and demanded Margo leave. Before she left, Margo begged Casey to quit, but he said he was happy with his new job. Margo warned Emily to be kind to Casey or she might not be able to keep Emily's secrets. \n\n\nWith Margo gone, Casey and Emily got back to work on the paper. A short time later, an angry man arrived to confront Emily about a story she had printed about him. Casey tried to stop him from going into Emily's office, but the man stormed in and smashed her computer. When the man struck Casey, Emily ran to help him, but the man grabbed her and threatened her. Casey ran to his desk and phoned Margo and told him about the man threatening Emily. Margo agreed to rush right over with the police while Casey went back in to help Emily. Casey tried to persuade the man to leave, but he shut the door behind Casey and told him that he and Emily would pay for the lies they printed. \n\n\nSofie arrived at the farm looking for Aaron, but found Meg instead. Sofie told Meg that she and Aaron had an argument and Meg advised Sofie to just be honest with Aaron. Sofie was worried that if she told Aaron the truth she would hurt him, but Meg told her it was always best to be straightforward. Moments later, Paul arrived and told Meg he was there to take her to lunch. \n\n\nAaron found Sofie waiting for him in the kitchen and she apologized for their fight. Sofie told Aaron she really wanted to keep seeing him, but she wanted to take things slow. Aaron was happy that Sofie agreed to keep dating him. \n\n\nMike arrived at the farm looking for Katie, but after waiting for a long time he phoned her to find out where she was, but she couldn't answer because she was busy filming her show. Mike waited all morning for Katie to arrive, but when she didn't show up, he decided to confront her about why she stood him up. \n\n\nAt the television station, Katie and Brad continued celebrating their wedding bliss and in between kisses and compliments they prepared for their next live show. Kim noticed that the two were getting along very well and worried that their previously combative on air personas would be destroyed by their newfound love for one another. As they began to film an episode about spring, their focus quickly turned from weeds to how much they loved one another. Kim looked on and commented about how much she hated their new on set chemistry. During the first commercial break, Kim congratulated the two on their happiness, but told them their love was boring for the show and they needed their old spark back. Kim's suggestions fell on deaf ears and Katie and Brad continued their show like two lovesick puppies. Kim told them to figure out a way to bring the show's fun back or they would be taken off the air. As they started to film another segment, Mike rushed in with the letter and asked Katie what she was trying to pull. Brad told Mike they were on air and asked why he was there. Mike read the letter he assumed was from Katie and she told him that she hadn't written it. Mike stormed out, leaving Katie and Brad to explain to their audience who Mike was. As they began to spar about Katie's past with Mike and Brad's days as a Casanova, Kim was pleased to see their on air chemistry had returned. \n\n\nAfter the show, Brad apologized for bringing up Katie's past with Mike and explained he did it to help ratings. Katie wasn't pleased and told Brad she needed to go and make sure Mike was all right. \n\n\nMeg and Paul went to lunch and discussed the misunderstanding with the hot air balloon. Meg reassured Paul that the entire thing was just a huge mistake and she was only trying to cheer up Mike. Paul acted understanding and forgiving about the entire thing and Meg was impressed with Paul's new attitude. Just as Meg and Paul decided to start dating again, Mike arrived with the anonymous note and threw it at Paul and demanded an explanation. \n\n\nPaul opened the letter and acted like he had no idea who wrote it. Meg asked to see it and asked if it was from Katie, but Mike explained that Katie had denied writing the letter and the only person interested in sending him on a wild goose chase was Paul. Mike continued with his accusations, but Paul denied any part of it until Meg asked him if he had written it. Paul finally confessed and Meg demanded that Paul apologize. Paul said the note was a joke to get back at Mike for stealing his balloon ride with Meg. Once Mike got his answer, he walked out, leaving Meg to confront Paul. Meg told Paul that Mike had done nothing wrong and she was angry with Paul for sending the note. Meg was convinced Paul was back to his jealous and deceitful ways and left Paul to check on Mike. Sofie had arrived at work and watched the argument between Meg and Paul. When Paul left the Lakeview, Sofie chased after him to offer her support. She found him at Fairwinds and said she wasn't leaving until she was sure Paul was all right. \n\n\nMeg caught up with Mike at the farm and offered her apologies for Paul's bad behavior. Mike said he was there to talk to Emma about getting Paul kicked off the project because he couldn't work with him any longer. \n\n\nAt their home, Noah and Ameera discussed Casey refusing to help trick people into believing that Ameera and Noah were really married. When Ameera began to cry, Noah thought she was worried about Casey, but learned she was upset because it was her birthday and no one had remembered. When she rushed out crying, Noah quickly called Luke and asked to meet him in Old Town so they could pick out a gift for Ameera. \n\n\nNoah and Ameera arrived in town and Luke was surprised that Noah had brought Ameera with him. Luke and Noah told Ameera they needed to take care of an errand for class and left to find a birthday present. As she sat alone in town, Casey arrived and the two discussed their falling out. Casey encouraged Ameera to tell Noah that she really cared for him and she agreed it was the best thing to do. \n\n\nLuke and Noah found the gift for Ameera and went to find her. When they all met up, Ameera told Noah she would meet him at home later and she decided to find an outfit to help seduce Noah when she told him that she loved him. Luke and Noah spent more time together in town and managed to find time to kiss before Noah went home to his \"wife.\" Ameera returned home and got dressed up and waited for Noah. When he came home, Ameera kissed Noah and told him she wanted to be with him.  \n\n\n",
