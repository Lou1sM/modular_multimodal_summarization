When Parker walked in, Carly told him that she was leaving town for the night. Parker asked if Carly was planning to go to Melrose Park, and Carly admitted that she was. Parker told her he couldn't let her do that.\n\n\nCarly insisted she was doing the right thing. Parker said that he had thought about making the trip to Melrose Park to be with Liberty, but he had decided not to do that because he knew that Liberty didn't want him to. Carly said that Jack had invited her to go with him; Parker reminded Carly that she had declined Jack's offer, but Carly said she had changed her mind. Carly assured Parker that she wasn't going to crash the funeral, but she said that if she didn't take her place by Jack's side, she might lose it. Carly went upstairs to get something, and while she was gone, Parker left.\n\n\nAt the Monte Carlo office, Craig looked through the financial records and bemoaned the fact that Gabriel had been taking money out of Parker's trust account. Gabriel walked in, and Craig told him to get to work or get out. Gabriel replied that he was working at blackmailing Craig, and he said he needed a debit or credit card. Craig said the trust wasn't a bottomless pit. Gabriel said if he didn't get a debit or credit card that day, he would tell Carly what Craig was doing with Parker's trust fund.\n\n\nCraig grabbed Gabriel and asked, \"Who are you, kid, and why are you trying to ruin me?\" Gabriel said that Craig was doing a good job of ruining himself. Craig warned Gabriel that whatever it was that had made Gabriel such an angry young man, Gabriel should try to master it before it mastered him.\n\n\nCraig gave Gabriel a debit card but lectured him about it having limits. Gabriel then demanded some cash, and Craig reluctantly gave him several twenty-dollar bills. Parker walked in, and Craig told Parker that he was giving Gabriel an advance on his paycheck. Parker thought someone with a brand-new sports car shouldn't need an advance on their salary, but Gabriel replied that times were tough. After Gabriel left, Parker asked Craig why he didn't get rid of Gabriel and hire someone else.\n\n\nCraig told Parker to forget about Gabriel, and he asked why Parker was there. Parker told Craig what Carly was planning to do, and he said he needed Craig to stop her from doing it. Craig told Parker that he wouldn't be able to talk Carly out of it, but Parker said he didn't want Craig to talk Carly out of it; he wanted Craig to tell Carly some lie that would keep her from leaving town.\n\n\nCraig went to Carly's house. When Carly protested that she didn't have time to talk to Craig, he told her to make the time, because he needed to talk to her about the biggest money-making opportunity the company had yet had. Craig kept talking and told Carly that Monte Carlo should launch its fashion line in Milan along with a new fragrance called \"Monte Carlo.\" Craig described the perfume as \"sophisticated, stylish, impulsive ... like you!\" Carly suddenly realized what was happening and told Craig that Parker had to have asked for Craig's help to keep her in Oakdale.\n\n\nCraig eventually admitted that Carly was right about his reason for being there, but he insisted the idea for a fragrance was a good one. Craig told Carly that if she went to Melrose Park, it would seem desperate, and he pointed out that if Jack was that vulnerable then Carly had bigger problems. Craig told Carly that she needed to keep busy, which was why the fragrance idea was so great. Carly said there was no idea, that it was just one of Craig's \"pathetic lies.\" Craig protested, \"It's not pathetic!\"\n\n\nCraig got Carly to agree that launching a fragrance would be a good idea. He asked Carly if she could admit that following Jack to Melrose Park would make her look bad. Carly replied that she never looked bad, so Craig told her to maintain that perfection by staying in Oakdale. Carly agreed, so Craig told her to unpack. Carly thanked Craig for keeping her from doing something stupid, and she told him that lately, she didn't know what she would do without him.\n\n\nWhen Carly went upstairs to unpack, Craig left. He called Ellis again, but once again, there was no answer. Craig then called Ellis' office and told the person who answered that Ellis was his accountant, and Craig needed to reach him immediately. The person on the other end of the phone told Craig that Ellis had cleaned out his desk and disappeared without leaving a forwarding number.\n\n\nTeri, Liberty, Janet, and Jack arrived at the Ciccone house in Melrose Park. Janet was uneasy about returning to face her family after 20 years. Teri pointed out that since their father had made his peace with Janet before he had died, the rest of the family would, too. Jack asked Teri to take Liberty inside to introduce her to everyone and to let Janet have a few more minutes to prepare herself. Teri and Liberty went into the house.\n\n\nJanet's baby brother, Eddie, walked up and greeted Janet warmly. After they embraced, Eddie asked whether Jack was the ex-husband or the boyfriend, and Jack introduced himself. Eddie asked why Jack hadn't been doing his job as a cop so that Rocco hadn't had to do it for him. Janet told Eddie to stop talking like that, and she suggested they all go inside.\n\n\nJanet went upstairs to her old bedroom. She found it almost exactly as it had looked when her parents had disowned her. Jack walked in, and Janet apologized for having left him downstairs on his own. Jack said he'd gotten an earful but nothing he couldn't handle. Janet remarked that her reunion with her mother hadn't gone very well, but Jack pointed out that Janet's mother had been out of it. Janet said Teri had told her that the doctor had given her mother two shots of a sedative. Jack cautioned Janet not to take on her mother's emotional needs because Janet had enough of her own to worry about.\n\n\nJanet stood in front of the mirror in her old bedroom and explained to Jack that when she'd been a pregnant teen, she had looked in that mirror every day to try to see if she were showing yet or not and afraid of what her father would do when he found out she was pregnant. She said she'd been a huge disappointment to her dad, but Jack said Janet's dad had been a disappointment, too. Janet told Jack that the day her father had kicked her out, she'd taken a photo of Brad with her -- and nothing else. She said, \"I lost so much that day. And for about five minutes, I had my dad back.\"\n\n\nJanet began to cry, and Jack held her. Eddie walked in and demanded to know what Jack had said to Janet to make her cry. Janet told Eddie to knock it off, and Eddie apologized. However, he then asked Jack to tell him why Rocco had ended up dead. Jack told Eddie that he didn't know why Rocco had decided to leave the hospital. Eddie told Janet that wasn't a good enough answer, but Jack told Eddie to lay off of Janet. Eddie asked why Jack was even there, since Jack and Janet were no longer married. Jack told Eddie that he was there to support Janet and that he'd be there as long as Janet wanted him there.\n\n\nJack then told Eddie as much of the story about what had happened to Rocco as Jack knew. Eddie wondered whether Dusty had put Rocco up to confronting the man who had tried to shoot Dusty. Janet told Eddie that it was personal and that he should stay out of it. Eddie wanted to know why Janet was wearing Dusty's ring, even though Dusty wasn't there, but Janet's ex-husband was. When Janet replied that it was complicated, Eddie retorted that Janet's whole life had been complicated.\n\n\nJack angrily said that Eddie had no idea what Janet had gone through because Eddie's parents had been hard-headed and simple-minded when faced with Janet's pregnancy. Jack pointed out that Janet had picked up the pieces and made an incredible life for herself and her daughter. He reminded Eddie that Janet had only been sixteen when her parents had kicked her out, and he asked Eddie to remember what it had been like to be sixteen. Chagrined, Eddie apologized to Janet and told her that although Janet had gotten the Ciccone good looks, he had obviously inherited their lousy temper. Eddie walked out of the room, and Janet told Jack that if Jack had been around when Janet had been growing up, things would have been a lot easier.\n\n\nLiberty walked outside the Ciccone house to get some air. Teri followed and asked if Liberty were okay. Liberty said she was, but she couldn't understand how Teri had lived with that family for all those years. At that moment, a woman who was sitting on the porch and smoking a cigarette spoke up and said that Liberty wouldn't understand anything about families because she had grown up without one. Teri introduced \"Aunt Marie,\" and Liberty replied that she'd had her mom for her family all her life, no thanks to the Ciccones.\n\n\nAunt Marie said Liberty had a smart mouth on her. Teri tried to change the subject by telling Marie that Liberty was a great student and was studying fashion; Marie said she hoped it was something that could be taught, because it was obvious Liberty didn't have a gene for it. Marie then told Teri to check on Aunt Josephine's stuffed shells; Liberty assured Teri that she would be okay, so Teri left Liberty alone with Marie on the porch.\n\n\nMarie told Liberty that she was too skinny, and Liberty replied that chemotherapy could do that to a person. Aunt Marie then criticized the hat Liberty was wearing and asked if Liberty was going to wear it to the funeral. Liberty said yes, and Marie complained that a good mother would have bought her daughter a nice wig. Liberty answered that her mother took great care of her, and always had, \"all by her lonesome.\"\n\n\nMarie laughed and scoffed that Janet Ciccone had never been alone. She pointed out that first, Janet had had Brad then she'd married Jack, and next, she'd taken up with someone named \"grumpy\" or \"bumpy.\" Liberty corrected her and said, \"Dusty,\" and Marie asked where Dusty was.\n\n\nLiberty's cell phone rang, and she was grateful to hear Gabriel's voice. When Gabriel said it sounded like things were pretty bad, Liberty told him that if she could fly away, she would. Gabriel said maybe they could help each other learn how to do that.\n\n\nJack and Janet walked out of the house and saw Teri and Liberty. Janet asked if they wanted to walk around the neighborhood with her and Jack. Liberty asked if there was a bus stop on the way, and Teri explained about Liberty's run-in with Aunt Marie. Liberty said Aunt Marie was like a train wreck because \"as she was sitting there with all that cigarette smoke circling above her head, criticizing everything about our lives, I couldn't stop staring.\" Liberty told her mother some of the things Marie had said, and Janet apologized. Liberty hugged her mother and said, \"They're not worth it, Mom. They can never take us away from each other.\"\n\n\nJack and Janet walked around Janet's old neighborhood, and Jack told Janet that facing everything with her family would help Janet move forward. Jack pointed out that Janet had taken all the love she had lost and had given it to her daughter and that Liberty knew that Janet had always tried to do the right thing for her.\n\n\nJanet confessed that she hadn't learned to start liking herself again until Jack had fallen in love with her. Jack said that it wasn't right that someone as loving and caring as Janet had ever been made to feel like they weren't good enough, and he said Janet was the best person he knew. Janet told Jack that he was the best person she knew, too, so he said it was kind of crazy that two such perfect people couldn't make it as a couple. Janet laughed and said, \"What are the odds?\"\n\n\nJanet decided she needed a few minutes alone, so Jack walked back toward the house. He took the opportunity to call Carly, who was very pleasantly surprised to hear from him. Carly asked how things were going, and Jack told her it made him appreciate the life he had with her back in Oakdale. Carly told Jack she loved him, but before he could respond in kind, Janet interrupted him and told him it was time to eat before the wake. Jack told Carly he had to hang up, and she asked him to call her later.\n\n\nJanet apologized for having interrupted Jack's phone call, but Jack said that Carly understood. Janet told Jack that she knew the whole situation was unusual and that her family gave new meaning to the word \"hell,\" but she was glad that Jack was there to share it all with her. Jack replied that it might sound even crazier, but he was glad he was there, too.\n\n\nAt the Ciccone house, Marie walked onto the porch to let Teri and Liberty know that she had tasted Teri's sauce and liked it, although she was surprised none of the \"old world stuff\" had rubbed off on Teri. Liberty said, \"Lucky for her, it didn't,\" and Marie asked what that was supposed to mean. Liberty replied that the house was full of mean people, and Janet had been lucky to get out.\n\n\nMarie told Liberty not to talk to her like that, but Liberty said Marie shouldn't talk about Janet the way she did. Liberty said that getting pregnant out of wedlock wasn't the worst thing that had ever happened, but Marie said in their religion, it was a sin. Liberty said the real sin was the way the family had treated Janet, not the fact that Janet had had a baby.\n\n\nLiberty's cell phone rang again, and she answered it, still angry. Parker, who was standing in Old Town, asked if Liberty were okay, and she said she was, but she was \"surrounded by the family from hell.\" Parker told Liberty that he could be there right away if Liberty wanted him to make the trip, but she said it wasn't necessary, and she hung up. As Parker reacted to being cut off, Gabriel walked up and said maybe Parker should take the hint and leave Liberty alone. Parker told Gabriel that Gabriel knew next to nothing about Liberty, but Gabriel said even though Parker had known Liberty a lot longer, it didn't seem like Parker knew much about her, either.\n\n\nAfter Liberty hung up, Aunt Marie said it seemed like Liberty was popular with the boys, just like Janet had been. Liberty asked if Marie was trying to insinuate that Liberty might also end up a pregnant teenager, and then she told Marie that it had already happened, but she had lost her baby. Liberty said that shortly after her miscarriage, her father had died, and so Liberty had seen it all, but she hadn't heard it all until Marie had filled her in. Marie apologized and said she hadn't known about those things, but Liberty said Marie hadn't bothered to ask.\n\n\nTeri and Marie went inside to get ready to eat, but Liberty stayed on the porch. Liberty looked down the street and was surprised to see Gabriel walking toward her. When she asked why he was there, he reminded her that she had said she wanted to fly away. Marie yelled to Liberty that she needed to eat, and Gabriel nodded and said, \"Go on, I'll wait. I don't want to fly alone.\"\n\n\nParker arrived at home, and Carly told him that his plan to have Craig talk her out of her trip had worked. Parker told Carly that he had decided he needed to go to Melrose Park to be with Liberty. Carly reminded Parker that he had said that Liberty didn't want him there. Parker confided that he could feel Liberty slipping away from him. He said that when Liberty had been hospitalized, he had known everything she had needed, even before she had asked for it, but something had changed, and he wasn't sure what it was. Carly admitted that she knew that feeling all too well, but she warned Parker that Liberty would push him away if his idea to visit her were the wrong one. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Terri, Jack and Liberty successfully defend Janet against the judgmental verbal attacks of her Aunt Marie and baby brother Eddie. Eddie finally apologizes to Janet once Jack explains that Janet was thrown out of the house when she was pregnant with Liberty. She didn't run away from home. Aunt Marie doesn't quite come around, but she does soften a bit once Liberty explains what she and Janet have been through since Brad died. Carly wants to go to the funeral to be with Jack because she is afraid to lose him to Janet, but Parker asks Craig to distract her with business, so he comes up with the idea to launch a perfume tied to the clothing line. Craig is shocked when he calls to talk to his accountant, Ellis, and is informed that he came in to clean out his desk and now they fear he is missing. Parker talks to Liberty and she tells him that she is having a rough time dealing with Janet's family but turns down his offer for him to go be with her and then she hangs up on him. Gabriel taunts Parker about Liberty not wanting him around anymore and they argue about which one of them knows what Liberty needs right now. Gabriel pressures Craig to get him a debit card as well as give him a cash advance right way. Parker gets suspicious when he sees Craig give Gabriel cash and a debit card but Craig tells him that he gave those things to Gabriel because they are fixing things around the Monte Carlo warehouse. Parker fears that Liberty is slipping away from him and wants to go to the funeral and be with her, but Carly persuades him not to go because it could drive Liberty further away from him. Gabriel arrives in Melrose Park to help Liberty deal with Janet's family and she is happy to see him. Janet tells Jack when he fell in love with him was the first time she felt like a person worthy of love. Her family always made her feel like she was inferior because she got pregnant with Liberty and brought shame to the family name. Jack and Janet wonder why they couldn't make their relationship work but agree they will always be good friends.",
