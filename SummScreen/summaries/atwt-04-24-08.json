Holden then began explaining to Luke about Lily's departure, but he was interrupted when Luke took a phone call from Noah and had to rush over to the newlyweds' cottage. When Luke arrived, Noah confided to him that Ameera had kissed him and seemed disconsolate that he had rebuffed her. As the teens were talking, Ameera appeared with her suitcase and declared she was \"going home to Iraq.\" She was ashamed that she had expressed her feelings to Noah, and Luke got them to agree that they needed a better living arrangement. Luke suggested that he move in as their roommate, which would not raise any red flags to Immigration since college students are always struggling to make ends meet. \n\n\nMike came to the farmhouse and explained to Meg that he could no longer work with Paul after the incident with the note supposedly from Katie. One of them had to leave. Meg told him there was no way he could abandon the Snyder Farm Project and pleaded with him to take a day to think about it. Mike agreed, and left. Holden told Meg that Lily had left temporarily to think about their marriage. \n\n\nPaul and Sofie talked at Fairwinds about Meg's telling Paul she was finished with him. Paul called Sofie a \"twelve-year-old\" even though she gave him good advice. She finally told him it was obvious that he did not make Meg happy, and Paul suddenly ran out. \n\n\nBrad tried to rule the roost by telling Katie that because he was her husband, he did not want her to see her ex-husband, Mike. Katie called him a pompous Neanderthal and left anyway. She went to the Lakeview and found Mike drinking doubles at the bar, where she joined him. Mike told Katie how much he had wanted the note to be from her but that she should go home to her husband and be happy. He suggested they both forget the note incident ever happened. Katie wanted to know who actually wrote the note, but Mike would not tell. \n\n\nAt the Intruder office, Casey attempted to talk down an out-of-control Judge Burke who was irate about an article that Emily had published. Margo arrived because of Casey's call but was stuck in the waiting room listening to the raised voices in Emily's office. The judge threatened Casey and Emily with a gun and ranted about getting even. Casey got the judge talking about his little girls and persuaded him to put down the gun, and Casey opened the door to the police. Margo sent the judge off with other officers and proceeded to berate Emily for being \"an idiot.\" She also let slip a hint about Emily's past as a prostitute. Margo insisted that Casey quit his job there, but Casey refused. Finally Emily dismissed Casey as her assistant for fear that Margo would tell her secret. Casey and Margo went home, but Casey was very upset. Emily, alone in her office, cried. \n\n\nAt the diner, Brad told Henry about Katie's going to see Mike. Henry told Brad not to worry and that Katie had chosen Brad of her own free will. After all, said Henry, she had married Jack on the rebound so Brad was more of a ricochet. Katie appeared and the newlyweds went back to the Lakeview. Brad was not happy that Katie's ex was back in town, but he had also learned that no one gave orders to Katie. \n\n\nPaul arrived at the Snyder farm, and Holden prepared a welcome with a shotgun. Meg suggested she talk with Paul herself and promised to get rid of him for good. She gave Paul a stern lecture and told him to leave. Paul tried to apologize for his actions, but it was a lost cause. Holden brandished his weapon, and Paul retreated to Fairwinds where he was surprised to find Sofie still there. \n\n\nMike drove to the farm and told Meg he had spent some time with Katie. Meg confided that Paul had just been run off the farm by her and Holden, and the two shared a drink. \n\n\nAmeera agreed to have Luke move in as a roommate, and Luke left to gather his belongings for the move. When he returned, he brought a birthday cake for Ameera, and he and Noah sang to Ameera. The wish Ameera made on her cake was for her good friends to be happy. \n\n\nAs Henry was shutting down the diner for the night, a teenage girl came to the door and asked about places to stay for the night. When Henry quizzed her about how long she was staying, she said it all depended on her friend, Brad Snyder. \n\n\n",
