Lucy apologized, but said she couldn't because she had things to do, too. \n\n\nLucy went upstairs to Dusty's room, and when he answered the door, she could see from his face that he'd been in a fight. Lucy told Dusty she was sorry for having gotten him involved in the activity at the docks, but Dusty told her not to worry about him. Dusty asked what was going on, and Lucy admitted that Cesar had called to say there was a problem with the last shipment. Dusty said if Lucy was determined to go to the docks to help Cesar, then he would go with her to make sure she didn't get hurt. \n\n\nAt the docks, Lucy told Cesar that Dusty knew everything that was going on and wanted to help. Cesar showed them the crate that contained the shipment, and Dusty looked through it and pulled out a rifle. Lucy was horrified to see that there were guns hidden in the crate along with her medical supplies and Craig's vodka. Dusty asked who had put the guns there, and Cesar said he thought it was Fredo, the man who had beaten Dusty up. \n\n\nDusty told Cesar to make sure the other crates didn't contain any surprises, and then to put the shipment on the boat. Cesar asked what to do with the guns, and Dusty told him to put them in the dumpster, and then Dusty would call the police and let them know what they would find there. Dusty gave Cesar a wad of money and told him, \"Lucy was never here. She never saw those guns.\" Cesar agreed, and Dusty and Lucy left. Sometime after they left, Cesar was putting the guns in the dumpster when a man walked up to him and knifed him in the abdomen, then walked away. \n\n\nJack went to Carly's house and asked if Craig was there. Carly said that Craig wouldn't be around anymore, because she had decided to part ways with him, both personally and professionally, and focus on her family. Jack apologized for having been rough on Carly about her drinking, but Carly told him she had deserved it. Jack then told Carly that Parker would need both of them, because Janet had hired a lawyer to work on an annulment of Parker and Liberty's marriage. \n\n\nParker went downstairs and commented on the fact that his mother and father weren't arguing for a change. Carly said she and Jack were going to focus on helping him, and Jack said they would pull together as a family. Parker said that he would be fine after he'd had a chance to talk to Liberty. Parker thought that Liberty would move back in with him. Jack told him that wasn't going to happen, because Liberty had decided to get an annulment. \n\n\nParker couldn't believe Liberty had decided such a thing on her own, and he blamed Janet and his parents for Liberty's decision. Jack told Parker it was entirely Liberty's idea, and he and Carly tried to make Parker understand that it was for the best. Parker became angry with them. He told them that just because Jack and Carly hadn't been able to make their marriage work, time after time, it didn't mean Parker's marriage couldn't last forever. He insisted he needed to talk to Liberty, so Jack agreed to drive Parker to the farm. \n\n\nAt the farm, Janet told Liberty that the lawyer would have the annulment papers ready soon. Liberty was worried about how Parker would react when she told him that their marriage was officially over. Janet said Jack and Carly could tell Parker, but Liberty thought Parker would overreact unless she talked to him herself. Janet didn't like the idea, but just as she tried to persuade Liberty not to talk to Parker, Jack and Parker walked in. \n\n\nJanet was not happy to see Parker, but Jack said he thought that Parker and Liberty needed to talk sometime. Liberty agreed, and she took Parker outside. Parker told Liberty that he knew he'd been a jerk, and he wouldn't try to tell her what to do anymore. Liberty said that it wasn't that easy, and that she just wanted to be a normal teenager again. \n\n\nLiberty tried to let Parker down gently, but Parker would not accept what Liberty was saying. Liberty told Parker that she was going to sign the annulment papers and thought he should sign them, too. Parker said, \"Forget it!\" and rushed off. \n\n\nLiberty went back inside and told Jack and Janet what had happened. Jack said he would look for Parker. Liberty wanted to accompany Jack, but Janet told her to let Jack go alone. Janet said she and Liberty would find Brad and fill him in on what was happening instead. \n\n\nCraig couldn't find a sitter for Johnny, so he told Johnny to draw a picture of Carly, and then they could take the picture to Carly's house, along with flowers and a box of chocolates. Johnny did as he was told, and together they went to see Carly. Carly didn't want to let Craig in, but she couldn't tell Johnny \"no.\" Carly thanked Johnny for the picture, flowers, and candy, and Johnny asked for a piece of the chocolates. Carly gave him one and then told Craig to take Johnny in the kitchen to get a glass of milk and a cookie. \n\n\nWhile Craig and Johnny were in the kitchen, Jack arrived, looking for Parker. Jack told Carly that Liberty had stood firm on the annulment, and Parker had flipped out and left the farm. Craig walked into the living room and asked what was going on with Parker. Jack looked at Carly in disbelief and said, \"So much for changing your life and focusing on our son.\" Carly told Jack she hadn't invited Craig there but that she had been unwilling to turn Johnny away. Craig backed Carly up, but Jack was still upset. \n\n\nCarly asked if they could stop talking about Craig and start talking about Parker. Jack told Carly all he knew and said that he had thought that Parker would go home, but obviously, Parker hadn't done that. Craig offered to go look for Parker, but Jack said Parker hated Craig and wouldn't be in such a mess if Craig hadn't interfered in the first place. Craig asked if Jack would have preferred it if Parker and Liberty were still happily married and living in Parker's bedroom. \n\n\nJack shot accusations at Craig, reminding Craig that he was the one who had let Parker use his car, had given Parker money to go to a concert in Chicago, and had lied to help Parker cover it up when Parker had stolen the money from the diner. Jack said it was no wonder that Parker had put Craig in charge of his trust fund. Craig pointed out that he hadn't lived up to Parker's expectations in that regard, but Jack said Craig should have refused to serve as trustee. Jack shouted at Craig, \"You messed up your own kids. I'll be damned if you're gonna mess up mine!\" \n\n\nJohnny, who had walked back into the room with his milk and cookie, was frightened by Jack's outburst and dropped his glass of milk. When the glass shattered, the adults looked over and saw Johnny standing there. Craig rushed to Johnny and picked him up, telling his son it was all right and that Johnny had nothing to worry about. Jack muttered, \"Until you're a teenager.\" Craig asked what Jack had said, but Jack said to forget it, because he was leaving. \n\n\nJack left, and Carly told Craig that he needed to leave, too. She sent Johnny to get one more cookie from the kitchen, and she told Craig not to try to use Johnny to get to her again. She also asked Craig to stay away from Parker. She said Jack thought Craig had done enough, and she did, too. \n\n\nCraig said he respected the fact that Jack was Parker's adoptive father, but he couldn't respect the way Jack continued to treat Carly. Carly told Craig that she didn't want his opinion and that he should leave. Craig called to Johnny, and the two of them left. \n\n\nParker went back to the farm to try to find Liberty. When he saw that she wasn't there, he used the phone in the kitchen to call her. When Liberty answered, Parker begged her to return to the farm so that they could talk about their marriage some more, but Liberty told Parker there was nothing more to say. Janet took the phone from Liberty and told Parker that he should go back home to his parents and let them help him. Parker hung up on her, and he proceeded to tear up the kitchen at the farm, breaking dishes and overturning the kitchen table in his anger. \n\n\nLiberty sat at the diner with Brad and talked about her decision to get the annulment, telling Brad how sad she felt even though she knew she was doing the right thing. Brad said Liberty could be a normal kid again, just like before her marriage to Parker, except that Liberty would be living at the farm instead of with Brad and Katie. Liberty assured her dad that she was fine with living at the farm while Vienna and Henry stayed with Brad and Katie, because she understood that it was a way to make Brad and Katie feel more like they were a part of Vienna's pregnancy. \n\n\nBrad told Liberty that if he was a good father to the baby that was coming, it would be because of Liberty. Liberty was touched by Brad's statement. Brad told Liberty how proud he was of her, and she thanked him, then left to rejoin her mother. \n\n\nWhen Janet and Liberty returned to the farm, they were shocked to see the destruction Parker had wreaked. Jack came in and saw the mess and was upset to learn that they believed Parker had caused it. Janet told Liberty to let Jack handle things with Parker, and suggested that Liberty go upstairs to catch up on her homework. After Liberty left the room, Janet told Jack that if Parker was out of control, she didn't want him anywhere near Liberty. Janet wanted Jack to tell Parker he could no longer go to the farm, but Jack pointed out that the farm was Parker's home, too, and had been a place of refuge for Parker for years. \n\n\nParker went to the Lakeview and found Craig having lunch with Johnny. Parker laid into Craig, shouting at him about having broken up his marriage. Craig tried to calm Parker down, but Parker continued shouting angrily. Unwilling to have Johnny witness yet another scene like the one with Jack, Craig told Johnny to finish eating his lunch and wait at the table for Craig to return. Craig took Parker by the arm and forced him out of the restaurant, telling Parker, \"I'm not gonna do this in public.\" \n\n\nCraig took Parker upstairs to Craig's suite. Parker said he would never forgive Craig for ruining his life. Parker said that if Craig had given Parker the money from his trust fund, Parker and Liberty would be living happily together in their own apartment. Craig said that wasn't necessarily the case, and that although it might not seem fair to Parker, it was all for the best. He then wrote Parker a check from the trust fund. \n\n\nWhen he handed it to Parker, Parker looked at it and said, \"Fifty thousand dollars?\" Craig said that although money couldn't solve Parker's problem or buy him love, it could buy just about anything else, and it might make Parker feel better. Parker asked if he could use it for anything he wanted, and Craig said yes. \n\n\nLucy and Dusty walked into the Lakeview and saw Johnny sitting alone in the restaurant. Lucy asked where Craig was, and Johnny told them that Craig had left and had told him to wait there. Lucy told Johnny she would wait with him, and she sat down. Dusty went to call Tom Hughes to let him know that Craig had left Johnny alone, but when he returned, he told Lucy that Tom had said that Dusty would need to establish a pattern of neglect in order for Dusty to try to win back custody of Johnny. Dusty asked Lucy to help him with that, and Lucy agreed.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
