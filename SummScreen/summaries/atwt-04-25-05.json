At the former BRO office, Dusty has packed up everything. Paul bursts in and protests, but Dusty informs him that Worldwide has withdrawn from the partnership and \"Street Jeans is officially out of business.\"  Jennifer arrives straight from the airport and Dusty greets her with, \"Welcome back.  You're fired.\"  Paul walks out and Jennifer begs Dusty, \"Please, don't let Craig take this too.\"  In spite of the tender affection in his eyes, Dusty leaves Jennifer alone in the office.  Katie walks into the gym, looking for Henry, but is interrupted by Craig.  Craig asks Katie to help him, threatening to tell Mike that Katie gave him the information about the baby and the Las Vegas wedding.  Katie protests that he can tell Mike everything because she loves Henry and not Mike.  Mike walks in and Craig leaves.  Katie tells Mike, \"this whole thing is my fault,\" but then fails to follow through and tell Mike what she has done.  Mike thanks her for trying to help, and Katie and Mike embrace.

Jennifer collapses in tears.\n\n\nCarly brings JJ home, but finds herself terrified by memories of Les' attack on her.  At the police station, Jessica appears and announces that she is Les' attorney.  Jack takes Jessica aside and demands to know who hired her, but Jessica refuses to tell Jack that Lucinda hired her, in a convoluted attempt to get Lily away from Keith.  Lily admits to Keith that she responded to his kiss, and she accompanies Keith to the station when Jack calls.  Les insists that Keith planted Julia's blood-covered phone in the halfway house, and in fact there is no one to back up Keith's claim that he found the phone in Les' room.  Tom Hughes arrives with the report that Les' fingerprints were not found on Julia's phone, so everyone agrees that there is not enough evidence to hold Les for Julia's murder.  Now the only charge is assaulting Carly, so Les could get out on bail and  try to get JJ again.  Les accuses Keith of killing Julia.  Lily insists that she wants to help Keith find the evidence to convict Les.  Jessica watches their intimate conversation from the interview room, then calls Lucinda to tell her what she has observed.  Back at home, Jack promises Carly that Les will never get through him. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "On the plane home from Las Vegas, Jen tells Mike she cannot marry him ever, and she gives back his ring. Mike is determined not to let this drop, and he suggest they discuss it in the morning, but Jen tells a disbelieving Mike she will not be there because she is moving out and throwing herself back into her work. Katie desperately tries to find Henry to talk to him, and explain herself, but is having trouble locating him. Craig shows up and taunts where her heart truly lies. She is angered by Craig suggestions reminding him she went to Las Vegas to stop him, and even called Mike to warn him, but Craig suggests she went to be there to pick up the pieces of Mike's life if Jen left him, and when she supposedly called to warn Mike, she never ended up saying anything. Katie doesn't want to listen to him, but Craig subtly blackmails her suggesting if she doesn't speak glowingly about him at the custody hearing then he may let it slip to Mike that it was Katie who told him the truth, and then Mike would hate her. Later, when Mike arrives to talk to Katie, she tries to tell him of her role in his interrupted wedding, but she ends up not being able to, and just lends her support to Mike who is miserable at Jen leaving him. Jessica shows up at the Police Station informing a shocked Jack she will be defending Les. Jack tries to understand why, and assumes someone must be paying her a lot of money, but Jessica will not tell Jack any information other then she is just doing her job. Lily and Keith kiss at the hospital, but can't talk about what happened because Jack calls them to the Police Station. Keith, Lily, Jessica, Tom, Jack and Les are at the Station when the report comes back on Julia's cell phone. To everyone's amazement, Les' fingerprints are not on the phone, and it now looks like Les will not be charged with her murder based on the lack of fingerprints, and the way the evidence was discovered. Later at home, Carly is plagued with flashbacks of Les, and when Jack comes home and is forced to tell her about the lack of evidence on Julia's cell phone, Carly is petrified Les will get out and come after them all. Barbara seeks Paul out to inform her that Jen is back. Quickly she realizes he already knew. He relays what happened in Las Vegas, and immediately Barbara wants to run to Jen's side, but Paul tells her to leave her alone. Barbara doesn't want to hear any of it saying Jen needs her family's help, but Paul is angry at Barbara believing she started the ball rolling because when she ran to tell Hal, Craig overheard her. He wishes out loud that if he could help Jen, then he would wish her some other family's DNA. This statement angers Barbara and she leaves. Dusty is officially closing Street Jeans because Jen skipped town. Paul arrives and pleads with Dusty to reconsider, but to no avail. Jen shows up ready for work, and is shocked to find the office all boxed up. A furious Paul fills her in, and Jen asks to speak to Dusty alone. She pleads for a chance to make up for leaving, and promises she will work hard, but Dusty tells her to focus on the life growing in her, and that his decision is final, and it is best for business, and he leaves an overwhelmed Jen behind, who loses it later when Craig arrives taunting her further about his place in their child's life.",
