He continues to defend Emily, blaming her erratic behavior on Paul but he is starting to have doubts.  When Tom tells him he just spoke to Emily, he asks Tom if he thinks she has anything to do with Dusty's disappearance.  Tom tells him that she was very edgy in their meeting and that he's suspicious but he doesn't think Paul is involved this time.  Hal maintains that anything Emily has done is because of Paul.  Just then he gets word that Paul's car has been found and he leaves.  Meanwhile, at the farmhouse, Emily is telling Jennifer that she followed her to the farmhouse afraid that she would get hurt trying to save Dusty.  Jennifer, of course, knows that's a lie and tells Emily that the phone call was a setup by her and Paul.  Emily breaks down and admits she kidnapped Dusty but tells Jennifer he escaped and ran into the woods.  Jennifer forces her outside and demands to know where he went.  Emily shouts that she sees him and then pushes Jenn and runs away.  Jenn gets up and follows her.  Outside, Dusty has the gun pointed at Paul.  Paul insists they find Jennifer before Emily does or she will be in danger.  Dusty thinks he's lying and that he was the mastermind behind the kidnapping.  He tells Paul he should have killed him when he had the chance and that he's going to now.  Jennifer runs up to him just as he pulls the trigger.  She goes to Paul who says he's fine and then she runs to Dusty.  As they reunite, Paul tries to grab the gun, but Dusty stops him.  Jennifer tries to explain that Paul had nothing to do with the kidnapping, that he helped her find Dusty but Dusty doesn't believe it.  Just as Paul is shouting that they need to find Emily, Hal comes up and has Paul cuffed.  Jenn again protests that Paul is innocent but Hal doesn't want to hear it.  Jennifer and Dusty head off to the hospital.  Paul demands that Hal let Meg go now that Dusty has confirmed Emily as the kidnapper, saying that's all he cares about.  Hal has him hauled off and starts a search for Emily.  Meanwhile, she has been hiding at the scene and has heard everything.\n\n\nAt Carly and Jack's house, Carly is visibly spooked by the skeleton.

When she comes back, he tells her that he called Jack but he doesn't think he'll come.  He says he doesn't want to go back next door, he wants to stay with Carly.  She convinces him to go back, and right after he leaves Jack walks in.  He tells Carly that he knows she is spooked and she and the kids should stay at the farm with him for the night, but when they're there, and Jack is telling the kids silly stories, Carly goes out to the porch to cry because things will never be the way they used to be.  She falls asleep on the porch.  Jack comes out and puts a blanket over her and she snuggles up to him in her sleep.  He puts his arms around her.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Will calls Gwen to arrange a night together.  Gwen promises to meet him in half an hour but ends up having to help Casey a bit first.
