Offended and annoyed Katie sends Brad off to flirt with the stage manager as she flips through contestant's letters from the station's contest.  Just then she receives a visit from Henry, still dressed in his tux and looking dejected after believing he has already lost Vienna to Brad.  Henry, who thinks Vienna and Brad slept together, tells his inaccurate story to Katie and asks for her help in getting Vienna to forgive him.  Katie asks him how he felt when he heard Brad and Vienna together and when Henry admits it upset him, Katie tries to convince him he must still love Vienna and that he needs to go to her.  A pitiful Henry claims he couldn't bear the thought of hearing Vienna tell him he has been replaced by Brad and leaves the studio.  Katie quickly turns her attention to Brad and lets him know with a punch to the stomach that she thinks he is a \"disgusting pig\".  Before Katie can leave the studio, Brad confronts her and asks why she is so angry with her.  When Katie tells him she knows he slept with Vienna, Brad denies the implication and tells Katie what really happened.  At first, Katie refuses to believe Brad, but he convinces her with an accurate account of what took place.  The good news that Vienna didn't sleep with Brad encourages Katie to believe that Vienna must still love Henry.  Brad quickly rips into Katie and says she is being a hypocrite because all along she only wanted Henry to love her and didn't want him to marry Vienna in the first place.   Katie denies Brad's accusations and to prove him wrong she tells him she is going to get Vienna and Henry back together by sending them both to the same romantic place.  She convinces Brad to help her and he agrees to help, if only to see the entire plan blow up in her face.  \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Vienna opens the door to Emma who has arrived to return her wedding dress.  When Emma tells her to hold onto it, Vienna claims she has lost Henry and he will never return.  Emma invites Vienna to return to the farm, but she declines because it is filled with too many memories.  Their conversation continues with Emma convincing Vienna that Henry will return to her, but in the meantime she needs to get out of her depressing hotel room and live her life.  Emma's pep talk inspires Vienna to imagine that Henry has returned.  Her fantasy is interrupted by a knock at the door and a visit from Henry.  He apologizes to Vienna and tells her he wishes he was a good man.  At first Vienna assumes Henry is apologizing for leaving her and wants to come back to her so she accepts his apology.  But when Henry tries to give Vienna her money back she realizes that he isn't coming back to her and with that Vienna tells him she doesn't accept his apology.  She lashes out at Henry telling him she wanted him to be different from all the other men in her life.  She tells him to take the money and get out and pushes him out of the room.  \n\n\nAfter his run-in with Vienna, Henry quickly heads to the bar to drink away his problems.  Katie hurriedly finds Henry and tells him an elaborate story about having to go to an inn to do a story for Oakdale Now.  She begs Henry to go with her and he finally relents.
