Henry tells Katie that Pilar has moved out of Mike's house into the Wagon Wheel motel, so Katie immediately hatches a plan to bug her at the motel, ignoring Henry's pleas that they stop pursuing Pilar, since he can see that Katie's obsession is heading her for serious trouble.  While Henry and Katie talk, Mike finds Pilar there, at the same motel where Russ Terry had stayed, dressed as a maid, making a bed.  The manager, Lyle, comes in and suggestively suggests that Pilar come \"dust my office.\"  Pilar tells Mike that she is going to attend Russ' hearing that evening, and walks away from Mike with a sly smile on her face when he warns her to be careful of Lyle.  Soon Mike's cell phone rings and Henry asks him to come to the metro to meet him to talk about Katie.  There Henry tells Mike that Katie is still in love with him and urges Mike to give Katie another chance.  Meanwhile, Katie sneaks into Pilar's room at the motel with her equipment.  Lyle finds Katie, whom he recognizes from the baseball bat incident, and is totally unconvinced when Katie spins a story about putting Pilar in a television show, \"The Maid and the Millionaire.\"  After he ushers Katie out, he tells Pilar that Katie was there to bug her room, and Pilar surprises him by telling him to go ahead and let Katie bug the room.  Katie goes from the motel to the metro, where Mike greets her warmly, to her surprise.\n\n\nThis evening, the Ryan family keeps the halls of the hotel busy. At his penthouse apartment, Paul confronts Barbara about her relationship with Dr. Walker Daniels.  Barbara admits that Dr. Daniels arranged for her to watch Will, but Paul goes on to question Barbara about why she has authorized Jordan Sinclair to make purchases for B.R.O.  Paul accuses Barbara of trying to take the business away from him, but Barbara insists that she has been trying to save time getting ready for the big Las Vegas fashion show.  While Paul and Barbara talk, Jennifer kisses Jordan passionately in Barbara's suite.  To her dismay, Jordan tells her that trying to mix business and a personal relationship would be \"doomed from the start.\"  Jennifer reacts badly, accusing him of being involved with Rosanna Cabot.  Although Jordan insists that Rosanna is not an issue, Jennifer becomes hostile at what she sees as his rejection.  Jordan politely thanks her for the evening and leaves Barbara's suite. At the same time, in Rosanna's suite, Rosanna tells Carly that she has arranged for Cabot Motors to sponsor the B.R.O. fashion show in Las Vegas.  The best part of the arrangement is that Cabot's publicity director has a crush on Jennifer, and insists of working only with Jennifer.  Rosanna asks Carly to help persuade Barbara to send Jennifer to Detroit to work with the publicist, leaving the field in Oakdale open for Rosanna to move in on Jordan.  Although Carly cannot understand how Rosanna's plan to marry Jordan would enable her to get Cabot back, Carly agrees to talk to Barbara about the Cabot sponsorship.  After Carly leaves, Rosanna dresses up and goes down to the hotel bar, where she finds Jordan and flirts with him.  Jordan, annoyed, demands that Rosanna tell him the real reason she called him earlier that evening.  After Rosanna tremulously tells Jordan that he has been the one bright spot in a very bad year for her, Jordan softens and agrees to have dinner with Rosanna.  Carly goes from Rosanna's suite to Paul's suite, interrupting his talk with Barbara.  Carly tells them that Rosanna wants to sponsor the show, and that Rosanna has promised her love-struck publicist that she would try to get Jennifer to come to Detroit to work with him.  Barbara is thrilled with the whole idea and leaves, promising to talk to Jennifer about going to Detroit.  Carly starts to follow Barbara out of Paul's suite, but he stops her.  He tells Carly that he is very suspicious.  First Rosanna would not let Carly work with Paul, now Carly is working for B.R.O. with Rosanna's blessing, and now Rosanna is sponsoring the fashion show.  To Paul, this all appears to be a plot to bring him down.  Carly rushes out of Paul's room to get away from his shouting.  Barbara goes back to her suite, where Jennifer tells her that she threw herself at Jordan and Jordan turned her down.  Jennifer confides that she is afraid that Jordan is becoming interested in Rosanna, and she is so mortified by her behavior that evening that she hates the thought of facing Jordan at work the next day.  Barbara urges Jennifer to go to Detroit, because it might make Jordan jealous, and Barbara predicts that the absence will rekindle the romance.  After dinner, Rosanna brings Jordan back to her room for a drink, and Carly interrupts them to tell Rosanna about her successful meeting with Barbara, and Jordan hears about the Cabot sponsorship and about Jennifer's planned trip to Detroit.  Carly leaves, and Jordan tells Rosanna goodnight, saying that he sees her softer side.  He starts to kiss her, but she gently pushes him away and closes the door with a happy smile.  Barbara ends the evening by telling Jennifer that everything is going to be all right for their family, even as her eyes blur again.  However, in Paul's apartment, he sits in the dark and has a vision of everyone turning against him at the Las Vegas show.  In his rage, he hurls his glass at the wall.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara gets angry when backed into a corner and proclaims that she is committed to her children. Carly kicks Plan B into action when she pitches the idea of a sponsorship. Henry's pleas fall on deaf ears, and she runs off to put her plan in action. Jennifer cries after shouting at her dinner date, and acting like a jealous little brat. Jordan demands to know why he was the only one to call when a sports car broke down. Lyle cannot help but show a boyish grin when he sees his new housekeeper cleaning a room. Mike agrees to a meeting when he learns that he could find out about a plan before it actually happens. Paul is angry that the idea of a sponsor did not come to him first. Pilar moves out of the house, and seems to start acting responsibly. Rosanna is grateful for the help that she gets, but still will not divulge all.",
