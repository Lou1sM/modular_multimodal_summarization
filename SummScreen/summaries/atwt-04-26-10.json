    "soap_central": "\n\n \nIn Melrose Park, Jack accompanied Janet on a walk the morning of her dad's funeral, but he was concerned about the strain on his ex-wife's pregnancy.  Janet said she could not have gotten through everything without him, and she was also worried about Liberty, who was also taking a walk on her own.  Liberty, however, was sitting on a park bench at that moment, and Gabriel walked up to her.  Liberty was under the impression that Gabriel had flown home the night before in the plane he had chartered, so she was amazed to see him.  Gabriel suggested that Liberty skip Rocco's funeral and go back with him in the plane, but Liberty did not want to leave her mom in the clutches of the Ciccone family.\n\n\nLiberty walked back to the house, however, and found Janet and Jack out on the front walk.  Her mother said that Liberty didn't have to go to the funeral if she was not up to it, and the girl said she actually would rather go home.  She said that Gabriel had been \"passing through\" in his chartered plane, and he had offered to give her a ride back to Oakdale.  Gabriel ran up, and Janet looked the boy over and agreed to the arrangement as long as he treated her daughter as \"precious cargo.\"\n\n\nAunt Marie, Eddie, and Teri exited the house, and Marie was upset that the \"spoiled\" Liberty did not have to attend her grandfather's funeral.  Janet tried to explain about how exhausted and run-down her daughter was from the chemotherapy, but Marie had her own opinions.  They left for the church, and Jack took Janet and Teri in his car.\n\n\nAfter the funeral mass, the family went to the cemetery, and Parker called Jack and asked how Liberty was holding up.  Jack said she had gotten upset thinking about Brad's funeral, and she was on her way back to Oakdale.  He told Parker that Liberty had gone with Gabriel in a chartered plane, and that upset his son.\n\n\nGabriel and Liberty headed for Oakdale on the plane, but she was feeling guilty.  Liberty asked Gabriel about his family, and he talked briefly about when his mother had died of cancer.  Liberty asked him why he had settled in Oakdale, and Gabriel said it was what his mom would have wanted.  Then he changed the subject, as the plane began its descent into Oakdale.\n\n\nParker called Liberty just after the plane landed, and his first words were that he knew she was with Gabriel, and he used an accusatory tone.  He was oblivious as to how a \"handyman\" could afford to charter a plane, but Liberty said she had no idea.  She suggested that perhaps Gabriel had gotten his money the same way Parker had, and she faked a bad connection and said she would see him at home.  Liberty thanked Gabriel for the ride and gave him a kiss on the cheek, but she refused a ride home in his fancy car.\n\n\nJack and Janet were walking to the gravesite when Dusty ran up behind them and called to Janet.  She was stunned to see him, but Dusty said he wanted to be with her.  He said he couldn't leave because he believed the two of them belonged together.  Jack pointed out that the family was waiting at the gravesite, but Dusty refused to leave.  Janet's brother, Eddie, walked back to them and asked who Dusty was.  Dusty introduced himself as \"Janet's fianc\u00e9,\" but Eddie referred to him as \"the one.\"  He got in Dusty's face and said his father was dead because of Dusty, and he ordered Dusty to \"get the hell out.\"\n\n\nJanet yelled at Eddie to get away, but her brother shoved Dusty, who took a mighty swing at Eddie's head but instead connected with Jack's jaw.  Janet and Dusty helped Jack, who had only tried to get between the two arguing men.  Eddie called Dusty \"a loose cannon,\" and Jack ordered him to leave.  Teri and Maria returned down the path, and Maria realized that Dusty was Janet's boyfriend. When she saw him, she asked Janet if she was \"sleeping with the enemy,\" and then Jack calmed everyone down.  Teri spoke to Dusty and advised him to leave. Dusty finally agreed, and the mourners walked on to the grave.\n\n\nAfter the burial, Janet sat in Jack's car and said that she was actually glad that she'd gotten away from Melrose Park and her crazy family.  They got out of the car in front of the Ciccone house, and Dusty was waiting there.  Jack went inside to get Janet's bags, and Janet removed her engagement ring and handed it to Dusty.  He refused to take it, but Janet insisted.  Dusty asked her if she still loved him, and Janet said yes, but she needed time.  Dusty reluctantly took back the diamond, and Teri walked out and asked Dusty to give her a ride home in his plane.\n\n\nJack carried out their bags, and Janet told him that she had given back Dusty's ring.  She declined to go inside one more time with her family, so they got in Jack's car, and he drove away.\n\n\nLiberty walked into Carly's house and found Parker, who made nasty cracks about her \"new best friend.\"  Parker demanded to know where Gabriel had slept the night before, and Liberty was outraged.  He also called the boy \"a player,\" and said that Gabriel had used Faith to hide a bag of drugs for him.  Parker claimed that Liberty's new friend only did things that benefited him, and he said he would figure out what Gabriel wanted from Liberty.  Parker ran outside and slammed the door.\n\n\nIn Carly's kitchen, Carly was mixing essential oils for Monte Carlo's new fragrance line when Lily dropped in.  She said she was there to see Parker, but Carly giggled and said he had left early but she couldn't remember where he said he was going.  Lily said it was pathetic that she needed to ask a 17-year-old boy for parenting advice for her teenage daughter, but since he wasn't at home, she'd settle for a cup of coffee.  When Carly served the coffee, Lily suggested that Carly incorporate the coffee aroma into the new fragrance.  Carly looked at Lily and called her \"a genius,\" and then they moved on to discussing their personal problems.\n\n\nCarly said that she and Jack were stuck in limbo because he had taken Janet to Melrose Park for her father's funeral.  Carly griped that she could not compete with a fetus, a kid with cancer, and a dad who dropped dead.  Lily said she couldn't solve her own problems, but she could certainly help Carly with some of hers.\n\n\nThat morning at Monte Carlo, Craig talked with the fianc\u00e9e of Ellis, his former financial advisor who was on the lam.  Craig asked some questions, but the woman hung up on him before he learned where Ellis had gone.  Craig shouted some words about the money's belonging to \"an innocent kid,\" and when he turned around, Parker stood in his office.  The boy asked what Ellis had done, and Craig lied and said he had left town without telling him.  Parker said he wanted to send some flowers to Janet and Liberty when they returned from the funeral, and he wanted to give Craig a heads-up that he would be putting a charge on the debit card of his trust fund.  Craig thanked him, and after Parker left, Craig picked up his phone and called in a favor.  A man showed up soon afterward, and Craig told him to get his money back from Ellis no matter what the cost, and he gave the man a photo of his missing accountant.\n\n\nLily asked Carly to go to Metro, so she did.  Soon Lily showed up with a woman in tow whom she introduced as Rhonda Wyler.  Lily said Ms. Wyler was a beauty products marketing genius, and she told her about the concept of adding coffee as a note in Carly's new scent.  Ms. Wyler thought it was a terrific original idea, so Carly called Craig and told him to go to Metro to take a meeting with her.\n\n\nCraig was forking over an envelope full of money to his investigator when he took Carly's call.  She ordered him to go to Metro and to take the checkbook.  Craig balked at the latter requirement, and he asked why.  Carly said the woman she was talking to was going to make them filthy rich, but she needed $500,000 seed money.  Craig blanched, grabbed his coat, and bellowed at his investigator, \"Find Ellis -- yesterday!\"\n\n\nLily excused herself from Metro, and Craig arrived.  Carly pulled him aside and chewed him out for his appearance.  She told him it looked as if he had been \"mauled by a bear,\" and he needed a shower and a clean shirt.  He confessed that he had been up all night, and besides, he was \"pulling the plug\" on the new Monte Carlo fragrance line.  Carly was confused, and she squirted breath freshener into his mouth and announced they were taking the meeting.\n\n\nCraig and Carly sat with Ms. Wyler, and Carly envisioned the fragrance campaign.  She thought they should shoot it in Monte Carlo, on the cliffs above the sea, because it would be thrilling.  Craig fussed with his phone and was grumpy, and paid no attention to what Carly was saying until she finally scolded him.  Craig turned to Ms. Wyler and asked her what on earth she could provide them with that was worth half a million dollars.  Craig's phone rang, so he jumped up to take the call.  His investigator said he had located Ellis, so Craig listened for a minute or two and said he would take it from there.  He returned to Carly and Ms. Wyler, said his goodbyes, and was out the door.\n\n\nIn a darkened movie theater, Ellis, who was wearing dark glasses, shoved popcorn into his mouth.  Craig grabbed him and pinned him into his seat, but Ellis struggled.  Craig demanded his money back, but Ellis said it was all gone.  In a loud stage whisper, Craig said, \"Don't make me hurt you,\" as Carly grabbed Craig from behind and said he had taken the words right out of her mouth.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Gabriel asked the desk clerk if he had received any packages, but the clerk said no, and he called him \"Mr. Carras.\"  Gabriel's phone rang then, and it was Liberty, who asked him to meet her right away at Java.  Gabriel handed his room card back to the desk clerk and asked him to hang on to it a bit longer.  Lily walked into the lobby and watched Gabriel's business with the clerk.  She looked alarmed, so after Gabriel walked out, she approached the clerk and asked who the boy was.  When the clerk said his name was \"Mr. Carras,\" Lily visibly reacted and ran out.\n\n\nAt Java, Liberty told Gabriel that Parker had gotten very upset when he had learned that she had ridden home on the plane with Gabriel.  She then prepared Gabriel for a question that she had to ask, so she said she wanted to know if Gabriel sold drugs.  Gabriel swore he neither used nor dealt drugs, and he invited her back to his room to watch movies and have room service.  He assured her that \"nothing would happen,\" unless she wanted it to.  They laughed and went to the Lakeview and up to Gabriel's room.  They found his door ajar, however, and inside, Parker was going through Gabriel's things.\n\n\nLily dashed home and took a key out of a special compartment in her purse.  She unlocked an old leather box in her bookcase and took out a photo of a smiling Hispanic baby, about 15 months old.  Lily appeared very worried, and she called and left a message for her sister, Sierra, in Montega.  She said, \"Remember that moment we hoped would never happen?  Well, it has.\"\n\n\nA little later, Lily spoke with Sierra and asked her if she remembered the photo of the baby.  Sierra did, but Lily said she needed a more recent one.  \"Brace yourself, Sierra,\" said Lily.  \"I think I saw Gabriel Carras in Oakdale.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig is livid trying to track down Ellis and his missing money. He even hires a PI to find him. Lily and Carly catch up; they even put their heads together and come up with a good fragrance idea for Monte Carlo's line. When Carly bemoans the fact that she needs to focus on something other then Jack comforting Janet, Lily has an idea. She introduces Carly to her friend, Rhonda, who is a genius in marketing fragrances. They all talk shop and Carly is convinced this woman can help launch the fragrance line. Carly calls Craig and tells him about this woman and how she can help them. He needs to meet her and bring $500,000. A preoccupied Craig comes to meet them but explains to Carly that he doesn't think they should go this route anymore, but now Carly thinks there is no turning back and she is determined to go forward. Craig gets a call that Ellis is found and takes off. He finds Ellis at a movie theater and demands his money back. Ellis tells him that it is gone, as Craig is livid and threatens him that the money better not be gone just as Carly is besides him saying the same thing. Liberty and Gabriel bond more, as Parker is more infuriated and picks a fight with Liberty when she comes home \u0096 even going as far as implying she might have slept with Gabriel. He accuses Gabriel of being a drug dealer because of the pills Faith had and is determined to find out what he is up to. Liberty asks Gabriel about Parker's accusations, as he explains, which draw them in even more closer. They go to Gabriel's room to watch a movie and find Parker inside going through his stuff. Lily sees Gabriel in the hotel, and she seems very rattled. She asks the hotel manager of his name and seems even more unnerved. She heads home and opens a locked box with a photo inside of a baby that looks like Gabriel. Lily calls Sierra and asks her for an updated photo of Gabriel; the thing they feared the most has come true. Janet prepares for her father's funeral, as Jack continues to lend his support. Dusty calls and asks Terri how Janet is, but Terri offers up that Jack is helping Janet through this. Dusty decides he can no longer stay away. He interrupts them at the funeral and Janet tells him she can't handle him.

Janet's aunt continues to hurl insults at Janet when she finds out Dusty's connection and Jack defends her. Terri convinces Dusty to leave. Later, Dusty and Janet talk, as she tells him that she can't stay engaged to him right now, as she hands back his ring. Dusty promises to wait until she can forgive him, as Janet is devastated.
