    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Old Town, Holden is talking to Natalie, who is reluctant to go on a sleepover at a friend's house because she doesn't know what to say about her mom going away. Holden reassures her that she doesn't have to talk about it at all, and he tells her Lily went to the hospital so she could get better and come back to be with them again. He asks Natalie to take a letter to the mailbox for him, and while she's gone, Lucinda, who has been eavesdropping, sits down next to Holden and tells him what a great dad he is. She hates it that he's the one suffering when it should be Craig who's in pain. She tells Holden to take care of himself, and he tells her to go after Craig, to bring him down and take her company back. Holden leaves with Natalie.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Meg is seated at the bar having a drink when Craig walks up to her. He thinks she's been sitting there waiting for him to walk by, but she says she's waiting for someone else. Craig assumes it's Paul, but Meg reminds him that she's \"moving on.\" She eventually gets up to leave, saying the doctor must have decided not to waste his time with her after all. Craig says he hates hearing her talk like that and doesn't like to see her feeling bad about herself. He says he realizes now that maybe she does need to move on, and she says she's ready to move on, with the emphasis on him. She walks out, and he tries to follow, but she ducks around a corner and eludes him. Then, Meg calls Paul and leaves a message saying she thinks she's hooked Craig, but they'll have to be careful reeling him in.\n\n\nEmily runs into Dusty at Old Town and tells him happily that she and Alison had a great talk the night before, and she thinks she really got through to Ali. Dusty tries to make her realize that Ali's not out of the woods yet and that she can't let her guard down. Later, Dusty runs into Holden, who's dropped Natalie off and has been trying to take advantage of some time without any of the kids around. They talk about kids, and then they talk about Craig and how he's tried to ruin their lives; as Holden leaves, Dusty tells him Montgomery's going down sometime. \n\n\nAlison gets off of work at Al's and sits down to talk to Paul. When he tells her he wants to make a deal with her, but she has to be discreet, she sounds as though she assumes he wants to pay her to have sex with him; when he realizes this is what she's thinking, he's part amused, part horrified, and part confused by her lack of concern about that kind of offer. She tells him she wouldn't have gone through with it anyway, but she says she's grown up a lot since she left Oakdale. When she asks again what the proposition is, Paul says Emily can't find out about it or the deal's off. Alison agrees, but Paul still won't tell her exactly what it's about except to say she'd have to play a role; he gives her $100 to keep her interested until he can explain the whole situation to her, then he leaves. Alison calls her drug-dealing acquaintance, Jesse, and tells him she'll meet him in 5 minutes, but Emily walks in and overhears her and tells her she's not going anywhere. They sit down to talk, and Alison alternately jumps on Emily for making her feel like a prisoner and apologizes because she knows Emily cares about her. Emily tells her she bought her a new dress, and maybe they should find something fun to do together tonight so Alison can wear it. She has Alison go change into the dress, and Ali takes that opportunity to call Jesse and ask him to hang around for a while until she can meet up with him. Alison and Emily end up having dinner at the Lakeview together, where a business man walks in and stops at their table, saying how lucky he is to have found the 2 of them together; he obviously recognizes Ali from her porn movies and Emily because he was a client of hers, but Alison doesn't know what the man is talking about. Dusty walks up and forcibly removes the man from the dining room; he tells the man not to go near them again, then he goes back to the table and tells Alison a lie about the man being a stalker who used to work at the paper. Alison can see that Emily wants to talk to Dusty about what just happened, and she tells her she can drive herself home, and Dusty can bring Emily later. Emily hands her the car keys, and Alison leaves, as Dusty sits and says, \"I hope that wasn't a mistake.\" Emily thanks Dusty for covering for her, saying she deserves whatever she gets as a result of what she's done, but she doesn't want Ali to be hurt just because Emily's a fake. Dusty says she's not a fake and reminds her of the good things she's doing in looking out for her sister. Emily says she wishes she could see herself the way Dusty does, and he says, \"Me, too.\" Meanwhile, Alison goes to Old Town and buys some meth from the dealer.\n\n\nPaul gets into Lucinda's car, and she gives him some wine as she listens to his proposal to bring Craig down. They trade insults, until Paul becomes fed up and says he's leaving, but Lucinda stops him and asks him what he has in mind. Paul says he's taking a page from Craig's book and is planning to use the people Craig loves to manipulate him. Lucinda says, \"Not Lucy, not Johnny, not Meg.\" Paul agrees that that's not who he meant, and Lucinda realizes he's talking about Rosanna. He tells her he ran into Alison Stewart and was stunned to find out how much she sounds like Rosanna. He tells Lucinda that he thinks he can pay Alison to impersonate Rosanna on the phone and make Craig think Rosanna has come out of her coma. After making sure Lucinda understands that he's running this show, Paul leaves, and Lucinda places a call to the medical facility in Switzerland where Rosanna is being cared for; she speaks to the director of the facility and reaches some type of arrangement with him. She hangs up, then asks her driver to take her to Al's for some food; she hopes to run into Alison Stewart there.\n\n\nMeg goes to Emma's and finds Craig there, waiting for her. He says she seems to be in a good mood for someone who's been stood up, and he tells her he thinks that's because she enjoys the verbal sparring they've been doing. He tells her that he's decided not to be smart but to believe her when she says she's moving on, with him, and he kisses her. As she backs away from his attempt at a second kiss, Holden walks in and orders Craig to leave. He doesn't notice when Paul comes to the porch and listens as he tells Meg he just doesn't understand her at all, how she could let Craig touch her after what he's done to their family. Meg tries to explain, but Holden says he doesn't want to talk to her anymore, and he goes upstairs. Paul comes in and asks Meg what was going on; she says she didn't know Craig would be there, and Paul tells her that's the problem --- they don't know what Craig will do. Paul tells Meg that her part in trying to bring Craig down is over, and he'll do this his way, without her help.\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Emily is optimistic after her talk with Allison, but Dusty brings her back to reality. Allison assumes Paul's \u0091job' for her is sex for money; Paul is shocked and sets her straight, but does ask her to keep it quiet. Paul gives Allison $100 for motivation. Emily takes Allison's tips, but isn't aware of the extra money she has. Emily and Allison have a girl's night out, but a former John interrupts them. Dusty ushers the man out; Emily and Dusty claim he was a former employee obsessed with Emily. Emily and Dusty grow closer. Allison purchases more drugs. Lucinda and Paul join up to bring Craig down; Paul tells her that he is going to need Allison's help. Lucinda is leery so goes to see Allison, but not before calling the clinic where Rosanna is. Craig flirts with Meg, who acts as if she isn't interested in order to reel him in further. At the farm, Meg lets Craig kiss her, as Holden walks in on them and is disgusted. Paul is upset when he overhears this and tells Meg she is out of the scheme.",
