Fortunately, the senior transport van had no scheduled passengers that day; they were going to be doing community outreach, instead.\n\n\nAt Lily and Holden's, Jade was angry that her aunt had not told her sooner that someone had kidnapped Luke and Noah.  She offered to contact the college students who might be able to identify the girl kidnapper, and she was sure that Casey would go with her.  Holden told Jade to be careful, and Lily described the fish pendant that the girl wore.  Lily took a call from Damian, who had enlarged and aged a photo of Gia Pinarossa.   He wanted Lily to verify if that was the girl she had seen at the War Memorial.  Holden offered to go get the photo and offered to drop Jade off at Memorial.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Zac, who was staking out Lily's house in hopes of being able to catch her alone, abandoned his post to bring food to Zoe at the storage locker.  The two of them kissed, but Zoe encouraged Zac to get back to Lily's immediately.  Zac brandished his gun and hoped that Lily was by herself.  Zoe talked to Luke who was anguished that Noah was still unconscious and obviously running a fever.  Luke argued with Zoe that once she had killed a Grimaldi, her life would not be worth much.  He offered to give her all the foundation money and to let her escape if she would let Noah go to the hospital. \n\n\nZoe turned Luke down, so he then offered to pay whatever she wanted, as long as she got help for Noah.  If she would not let Noah go, then Luke begged her for medication to fight Noah's infection.  Again, Luke offered to give her anything within his power.  Zoe left to get the drugs, and Noah regained consciousness.  Luke reminded his boyfriend that they were hostages, as Noah complained of pain and being very hot.  Luke promised that they would get out alive, but Noah passed out again.\n\n\nLily talked with Lucinda and said that Margo thought the kidnappers were amateurs who would foul up.  Lily promised to keep her mother informed, and as she hung up, she heard a noise at her front door.  She called out to the police officer guarding her house, but he did not answer. Unseen by Lily, Zac crawled out of the shrubbery over the body of the policeman.\n\n\nJade showed up at the hospital and asked Casey for his help.  She told him Luke and Noah had been taken hostage and that there was a ransom note.  Jade was very worried for Luke, and Casey hugged her as Alison walked in.  Casey explained to Alison what had happened, and Jade said she would email her the photo Damian had made so that she could show it around the hospital.  Casey agreed to start their search at Java, but Alison worried about his safety.  Casey scolded Alison that she was too afraid to take action, and consequently she did nothing.  He and Jade left to start approaching college students.\n\n\nHolden arrived at Damian's room in the Lakeview, and Damian was surprised to see him.  He showed Holden the photo of Gia Pinarossa, and offered to email it to Lily at home.  He and Holden had words, and Damian accused Holden of putting Lily in danger, yet again. Damian declared he was the best hope of finding the boys, and Holden went home.\n\n\nLily looked at a framed photo of Luke and Noah, and she heard a knock at her door.  Her visitor identified himself as Officer Hazen of the Oakdale Police Department.  Lily opened the door, and Zac walked in.  He told her that Chief Hughes wanted him to transport Lily to the police station, so Lily grabbed her purse and left willingly with Zac.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Zoe wore a nurse's smock and asked Alison where the hospital kept its drugs.  She said some odd things, and Alison noticed Zoe's Pisces pendant.  Alison pointed to the drug closet, and Zoe went in and helped herself.  Her cover story was that a Dr. Robinson on the fourth floor had sent her.  Alison was suspicious and went into the closet with Zoe, asking what medications she was taking so she could log them into their drug book.  Zoe had chosen erythromycin, an antibiotic, and a pain killer.  Alison faked an interest in pharmacology and told Zoe that the pain killer was a controlled substance, so she needed to record the patient's name and the drug's protocol.  Zoe feigned innocence since she was new, but Alison kept asking for the information.  Finally, Zoe just grabbed Alison and locked her in the drug closet.\n\n\nZac took Lily to Worldwide, and he told her Margo Hughes wanted her to transfer the foundation's funds into a certain numbered account.  Lily questioned him, and then said she needed to talk directly to Margo.  She had clued in that Zac was not who he seemed, and finally she asked him who he was.  Zac replied that he was \"the person who was about to steal all her money.\"  Lily's phone rang, but Zac would not let her answer it until she had transferred the funds.  Lily refused until she had proof that Luke was safe.  Zac pulled out his gun and threatened her until Lily told him to go ahead and shoot.  She knew he could not get his hands on the money without her help.  After a long stare down, Lily asked if Zac was a Grimaldi or a Pinarossa.  Zac ignored the question and again warned that he would shoot her.  Lily got fierce and said she would give him no money unless she was assured that Luke was still alive.\n\n\nHolden spoke to Margo, who wondered why Damian had not sent the Gia photo to her yet.  Holden said Damian had wanted Lily to confirm the girl's identity first, so Margo told him to go home while she ran Gia Pinarossa through a police data base.  At home, Holden was surprised that Lily was not there, so he called her and left a message wondering where she was.  He was obviously worried, so he called Damian, who had no idea where Lily had gone.\n\n\nCasey and Jade were also wondering why Lily had never sent the photo, but Casey suggested they try another coffee shop since they had gotten no leads at Java.  The two of them set off.\n\n\nAt the storage locker, Luke began attempting to awaken Noah again by asking film questions.  Noah roused a bit and mumbled some answers before he fell asleep again.  Zoe returned with the medications, and her phone was ringing.  She spoke to Zac who told her that Lily wanted proof that her boy was still alive before she would transfer the money.  Zoe spoke with Lily and put the phone near Luke's head.  Luke recognized his mother's voice, so he reassured her he was OK, but he also told her that Noah had been shot.  He cried out to tell her not to make a deal with liars, but Zac jerked the phone away from Lily.  He announced that the family reunion was over and forced Lily to sit down and begin the money transfer.  Instead, Lily cleverly typed \"HELP   OFFICE   NOW\" and sent it to Holden's phone.  She lied to Zac and told him she had been looking for new passwords, but the message went through to Holden's phone.\n\n\nAlison pounded on the door of the drug closet and screamed for help.  Jade and Casey returned to the hospital and heard Alison. Casey freed her, and Alison explained that the girl kidnapper had stuck her there and taken some medications.  They found a receipt for the rental of the storage locker on the floor, so Casey volunteered to call his mother and suggested that the girls call Lily and Holden.\n\n\nLuke questioned Zoe about his mother, and then begged her to give Noah the drugs.  Zoe said they had unfinished business still, but she did not elaborate.\n\n\nAt Worldwide, Lily fumbled the transfer and complained that the transaction was complicated.  Zac was impatient, and they both heard a noise outside the office.  Zac left to investigate, and a fearful Lily went ahead and called out that the transfer was complete.  Zac told her to write down the confirmation number, which Lily did.  Zac pretended to shoot Lily, but instead he ran out.  Holden arrived, and at least Lily was able to give him the good news that Luke was still alive.\n\n\nDamian pounded on Lily's door, but no one was home.  He was walking away when he stumbled over the dead policeman.  Jade, Casey and Alison arrived and let Damian in.  He asked them to call the police, and Casey handed over the receipt for the storage locker, as Alison identified Zoe from the photo Damian showed her.  Damian took off in a hurry, and Jade went into another room.  Casey and Alison hugged, happy that they were safe.\n\n\nZac went back to the locker and told Zoe that Lily had transferred the money.  The two of them kissed, and Luke asked Zac to help Noah.  Zac was not pleased that Zoe had taken the chance of going to the hospital to steal drugs.  Zoe told Zac to leave, because she and Luke had some unfinished business.  She told Luke that if he delivered, she would give Noah the medications.  She hinted that Luke might actually enjoy what she wanted from him, and that was justice.  She said she resented how the Grimaldi's had treated her mother, and now she wanted her rights restored.  She demanded that she be the mother of Luke's firstborn heir, so the child would be a true Grimaldi.  Luke said he could not make her pregnant, but Zoe assured him that there was no problem she could not solve.  Then she grabbed his head and kissed him on the mouth.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jade learns of Luke and Noah's kidnapping and is desperate to help. Lily promises to get a photo to Jade for her to distribute soon, as Jade heads off to meet Casey. Damian uses software to age the daughter of the slain woman, wants Lily to see if she knows her, but Holden won't let Lily go, and instead goes to see Damian himself. Noah is getting worse, as Luke struggles to keep him conscious. Zoe agrees to get medicine for Noah if Luke will do whatever she wants. Jade leans on Casey for support, as Allison sees this and doesn't react well until Casey explains. Allison still is leery about getting involved and messing with the police investigation, but Jade and Casey won't be deterred and Casey and Allison argue because of this. Allison and Zoe come face to face, as she poses as a nurse; Allison realizes who she is and tries to stall her, but Zoe catches on and shoves Allison in a closet. Zac kills the police officer, who is guarding Lily's house, then poses as a police officer himself, and gets Lily to accompany him to her office where they are supposedly meeting Margo. Lily figures it out, as Zac orders her to make the money transfer. She won't until she receives proof that Luke and Noah are alive. Zac acquiesces and Lily is allowed to talk with Luke, but she also learns the Noah has been shot. Holden is worried when he comes back with the age-enhanced photo and doesn't find Lily or the police officer. Lily sends an SOS to Holden before she transfers the money to Zac and Zoe's account. Holden saves Lily, as Zac was contemplating killing her. Jade and Casey come up empty in their search but find Allison locked in a closet. They end up with one more piece of evidence \u0096 a storage locker receipt. Casey and Allison lean on each other for support \u0096 finally, much to Jade's sadness. Luke pleads with Zoe to give Noah his medicine, but she wants him to agree to do what she wants. Zac comes back with news that they have the money, which pleases Zoe so much. However, the rest of the plan still needs to happen, as Zac begrudgingly leaves Zoe to it. Damian shows up at Lily's to find the police officer killed, as he runs into Jade, Casey and Allison, who give him the storage locker receipt. He heads over there where he runs into a gun yielding Zac. Luke finally hears of Zoe's twisted plan- she wants him to sleep with her so she can bear a Grimaldi heir.",
