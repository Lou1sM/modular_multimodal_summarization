Rose agrees to come upstairs from the restaurant, where she is having lunch with Dusty, to get the check she needs for the contractors.  Dusty asks Barbara for the money he needs to write Rose the check, Barbara retorts that he will get the money only when he gets Rose into bed. then Barbara leaves the room.  When Dusty hears Rose knocking at his door, he takes off his shirt, exposing his muscular chest.  When he offers Rose the explanation that he hurt his shoulder, she offers to rub liniment on him.  Unable to tear her eyes away from his skin, she rubs his shoulders, then he massages her tired hands.  Recovering her composure slightly, Rose asks Dusty for the check, but he temporizes.  Rose blurts out her fear that she will lose Paul because of Henry Coleman's accusations.  Dusty huskily tells Rose that Paul would be a fool to let her go, as the two gaze into one another's eyes.  Shaken by her feelings for Dusty, Rose starts to leave the room.  Dusty stops her and warns her that, if she tells Paul that she kidnapped his mother, things will never be the same between Rose and Paul.\n\n\nAs soon as Rose leaves the lunch table, Paul calls Molly and asks her to come meet him there.  When Molly joins him for a martini, Paul asks her if it is true that Dusty and Rose were together the afternoon of May 10, when Barbara was kidnapped.  Molly checks her day-timer and finds that she herself was with Dusty that entire afternoon, so Dusty could not have been with Rose.  Molly tell Paul that, in her opinion, if Rose kidnapped Barbara, it was divine retribution, and she reminds him that Barbara was not hurt at all.  Paul responds that, even if  her opinion has merit, his best friend should not have lied to him.  He jumps up and heads upstairs to confront Dusty.  When he arrives, Dusty yanks the door open, thinking Rose has returned.

He tells Emily that he will ethically have trouble asking Jack to bury the evidence that Emily replaced the watch she lost to Barbara, and he is even more shaken when Emily tells Hal that Carly also has asked Jack to bury the evidence. Just at that moment, Barbara bursts in their door, closely followed by Jack.  Barbara dramatically demands that Jack be taken off her kidnapping case.  At Barbara's insistence, Jack admits that Emily bought a similar watch, but he insists that that is not enough evidence to build a case on.  Hal gapes in surprise at Jack's statement, but puts on a stone face when Barbara whirls to confront him.  Accusing the two policemen of closing ranks to form \"a blue wall of silence,\" Barbara declares that she has an eyewitness who will name Emily and Rose as part of the \"cabal\" that kidnapped Barbara:  \"Eyewitnesses, unlike watches, can't be buried!\"  Hal and Jack together tell Barbara that they have already questioned Henry Coleman, who, they surmise, is her eyewitness.  They inform Barbara that Henry is completely untrustworthy and they even accuse Barbara of bribing Henry.  After Barbara storms out, Hal and Jack decide that Dusty is the only person who can stop Barbara in her tracks.   When Jack leaves, Hal tells Emily that she is off the hook for now, and they embrace.  After Hal leaves for the station., Rose arrives and Emily joyfully tells her that they are in the clear.
