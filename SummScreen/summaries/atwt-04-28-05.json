Lily told her mother to stay out it. Lucinda kept telling Lily that she needed to work on her marriage. Lily said Holden had moved on and she was doing the same. Having had enough of Lucinda's opinion, Lily left to find Keith. At the police station, Keith was appalled that Tom wants to exhume Julia's body and accused Tom of being on Les' side. Tom explained to Keith that Julia throat was constricted and they needed to find out why. Keith wouldn't hear any of it and told Tom that he was absolutely forbidden to touch Julia's body. Lily arrived and Keith told her what Tom wanted to do. Keith told Lily that he was not going to have Julia go through anymore and that she deserved to rest in peace.\n\n\nJennifer and Mike realized that Katie set them up. Mike defended Katie's actions but Jennifer was unmoved by the gesture.  Jennifer told Mike about Craig serving her with a subpoena. Mike said they could stand up to Craig together but Jennifer told him there was no 'we' and she was through dealing with it. Meanwhile, Katie told Henry what she did and Henry immediately thought she did it because of guilt. Katie tried to explain herself and started to seduce Henry who quickly put a stop to it because he wasn't convinced. She finally convinced Henry to go over to the Lakeview and see how Mike and Jennifer were doing. Mike was tired of talking and left as soon as Henry arrived. Jennifer explained to Henry that she was not going to have Mike rescue her every time she had a crisis. Mike went to Katie and thanked her for what she tried to do but told her to stay out of it and let him handle his own affairs. Later, Henry arrived at the gym and made up with Katie.\n\n\nWhile Craig was waiting for a shipment to come in, Sierra, Dusty, Paul and Barbara were plotting to bring him down and run him out of town. Dusty, Paul and Barbara were quick to jump on board but Sierra had reservations and reluctantly agreed to cooperate. Sierra went to ask Margo for help in their little plan and Barbara was in charge of detaining Craig. Barbara offered Craig champagne to celebrate the baby but Craig thought Barbara was trying to poison him and switched glasses with her. Barbara pretended that she was sleepy when Craig's contact from Singapore showed up. Unbeknownst to Craig, his contact was a fake, hired by Dusty and Paul. When Craig showed up at the dock, Dusty and Paul appeared with a police dog who found drugs in the shipment.\n\n\n",
