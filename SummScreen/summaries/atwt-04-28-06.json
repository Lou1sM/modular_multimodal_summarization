Meg wants to call Hal and tell him, but Paul says it's his responsibility to try to bring Emily back. As they leave, they run into Dusty and Jennifer; Dusty thinks Paul knows where Emily is and demands that he tell him, but when Dusty asks where they're going, Paul says they're going to see Hal to find out if there's been any news about Emily. Dusty doesn't believe Paul, so he and Jennifer try to follow Paul and Meg after they leave. Dusty thinks Paul was behind his kidnapping, but Jennifer insists that in her opinion, Paul has changed since the baby switch, and she doesn't want anything to happen to him. She asks Dusty what he did with Emily's gun, and he says it's in his pocket.\n\n\nIn the woods, on the bluff, Emily hallucinates and \"sees\" first Paul, who tells her, \"Tonight, you face everyone you ever hurt,\" and then she \"sees\" Jennifer, Dusty, Henry, Meg, and even Daniel, but Daniel is the only one who can't see Emily. Tom and Margo appear and tell Emily she's dead to Daniel now. Barbara appears, and Emily blames her for twisting Paul and making him incapable of loving a woman. Hal appears, and Emily tells him he kept her grounded, but he says it's too late for her now and brings out some handcuffs. \n\n\nAt the police station, Tom arrives and tells Susan and Hal that there was a package for Daniel on his doorstep earlier, with a note from Emily saying she wished she had more to leave him. Susan says the item is an heirloom that belonged to Emily's grandfather and that Emily had intended to give it to Daniel when he turned 13. Tom says this means Emily has definitely decided to leave town, and he wants the Feds brought in to help find her. Susan objects, worrying about her daughter's safety. An officer arrives and tells Hal that a chopper has spotted Emily's car near the woods, so Hal leaves to go find her, with Susan begging him to keep her daughter safe. Tom apologizes to Susan for some of the things he's said about Emily at the station, and Susan says she just wants a second chance with Emily.\n\n\nOn the bluff, Paul arrives and finds Emily; she tells him about all the people that were there to condemn her, and he tells her it was just a dream, that they're not there now. He holds her and tells her he's there to help her; when she asks why he wants to help, he says, \"I owe you at least that much. You're only here because you loved me.\" She agrees and then begs him to help get her out of the country. Paul refuses, telling her it's not possible at this point, and just when he gets her to trust him, Meg rushes up, saying she'd gotten worried about Paul. That makes Emily back off again, and she accuses Paul and Meg of wanting to get rid of her so they can be happy together, noting that Paul has even taken off his wedding ring. Emily tries to run, but Paul asks her, \"What about Daniel? What about your mother?\" She says Susan doesn't love her anymore, but Paul assures her that's not true and says again that he'll help Emily. At that moment, Dusty and Jennifer arrive, and Dusty tells Paul he's not going to be helping anyone. Emily moves to the edge of the bluff, and Paul reaches out to her, begging her to take his hand and take a step away from the edge, to trust him one more time, telling her he'll make sure everyone knows that everything was all his fault, not hers. Emily says, \"If I do that --- if I trust you one more time, if I take your hand --- I'll never be able to forgive myself,\" and then she turns and jumps off the bluff!\n\n\n",
