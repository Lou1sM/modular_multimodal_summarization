Margo and Tom told Casey that Emily wasn't the only employer in Oakdale and he needed to start looking for new employment. Casey asked why his parents refused to support his job with Emily and they both said Emily's past could put him in more danger. Margo and Tom reminded Casey about the hostage standoff with the judge in Emily's office and told Casey they didn't want to see him hurt because of Emily. Margo became so flustered by her argument with Casey, that she decided to return to the station and told Casey to come down later to give his statement about the hostage situation. \n\n\nMargo arrived at work and was greeted by a smug Emily who had just given her statement to the police. Emily asked if Margo would let Casey work for her if she was at a more reputable paper and Margo told her she never wanted Casey to work for her regardless of where she was employed. Emily accused Margo of not being able to get past Emily's affair with Tom and told Margo she was punishing Casey for it by not letting him take the job at The Intruder. Margo told Emily she considered Emily poison to her family and didn't want Emily near Casey. Emily reminded Margo that it was her two sons, Adam and Casey, who were having trouble with the law and not Emily's son, Daniel, and insinuated that Margo might just be the poison in her family. Casey overheard the conversation and asked Emily not to speak to his mother that way. Emily said she was only there to give her statement, but would be happy if she never spoke to Margo again. After Emily left, Margo thanked Casey for sticking up for her. Casey explained that he told Emily to stop because Margo was his mom and not because he thought Margo was right. \n\n\nAfter leaving the station, Emily ran into Tom at Java and told him to ask Margo to back off. Emily explained that Margo still blamed her for their affair and she was tired of apologizing for the relationship that gave her Daniel. Tom told her that Margo was just looking after Casey, and Emily explained that Margo needed to stop smothering Casey or he was going to do something drastic to break free of his mother's hold. \n\n\nAfter his talk with Emily, Tom went to the station to speak with Margo about Casey's employment. Tom told Margo that they might want to reconsider letting Casey work for Emily. Tom and Margo returned home and told Casey that they would let him make his own decisions about his job, but they hoped that it wouldn't involve working for Emily. Casey hoped that Emily still had the job open and went to find out. \n\n\nCasey found Emily in her office and asked for his old job back. He reassured her that Tom and Margo were all right with him working at The Intruder, and he promised to do a good job. Emily agreed to give Casey his job back and he hugged her in the excitement of the moment. \n\n\nOutside Parker's hospital room, Holden told Jack to calm down and stop yelling at Carly. Jack was upset that Carly hadn't called him as soon as Parker was hurt and Carly admitted that she hadn't phoned him because she didn't want him at the hospital. Jack was angry that Carly was trying to keep him from the kids and reminded her that he had custody of their children. Carly angrily told Jack to stop threatening to take the kids away. Holden told Carly he would watch Sage and JJ out at the farm and left Carly and Jack to wait for Parker. Moments later, the doctor came out and explained that Parker was fine, but had a slight concussion and needed to be watched for the next few hours. When Carly told Parker she would take him home, Jack jumped in and said they would both be looking after him. \n\n\nAt the television station, Brad and Katie were stunned when Liberty told Brad that she was his daughter. Brad assumed the entire thing was a practical joke, but Liberty reassured him that she was very serious. Liberty showed Brad a picture of her mom, Janet Ciccone, and Brad suddenly recalled his past with \"Juicy Janet\" at his Junior Prom. Brad asked Liberty if Janet had sent her to find him, but she told him that her mother had only told her who Brad was, and it was Liberty's idea to seek him out. Katie pulled Brad aside and told him that it was probably just an old girlfriend trying to get money out of a local celebrity. Brad admitted Katie's scenario might be true, but also confessed that the math was right and he could be Liberty's father. Katie was shocked that Brad might have a child and wanted proof that the teenage girl was his. Liberty said they could talk to her mom, but Katie wanted a DNA test. Liberty happily accepted the opportunity to prove her paternity. \n\n\nBrad arrived at the hospital with Liberty and Katie, and asked Susan to perform a discreet paternity test on Liberty. Susan agreed to do the test and took Brad in to get his DNA sample. As Katie and Liberty waited in the hallway, Parker and his parents emerged from his room, which sent Liberty scurrying for a hiding place. Katie asked what had happened and Parker explained that \"some airhead girl\" had knocked him off his skateboard and left him unconscious. When Jack asked why Katie was there, she looked around to introduce Liberty, but found the teenager had snuck away. She explained Brad was there for some routine testing and she wished them well as they left for home. When the coast was clear, Liberty returned and Brad sent her in to see Susan so Susan could get a sample of her DNA. \n\n\nWhen Liberty was done, she asked how long it would take to find out if the tests proved Brad was her father. Katie explained it could take up to two weeks and Liberty said she would be staying in town to wait for the test results. Katie told Brad they couldn't just let her stay in Oakdale alone and chased after her. Liberty admitted she didn't have anywhere to stay and had been staying in the park. Katie told Brad they needed to let Liberty stay with them. \n\n\nBrad, Katie, and Liberty returned to the Lakeview and asked the desk clerk for a room for Liberty. He explained they had no availability because of a big convention. Katie and Brad decided to let Liberty stay with them in their room. Once in the room, Katie told Brad she needed to go see Margo and he should spend some time with Liberty. Before Katie left, Brad told her that they would get through everything together, but Katie seemed unsure. \n\n\nAlone in the hotel room, Brad and Liberty discussed what her mom was like in high school. They got ready to go to sleep and Brad was conflicted at the prospect of having Liberty be his daughter. As he tucked her in he wondered if she was really his. \n\n\nParker returned to Carly's home with Jack and Carly and they reminisced about happy family times. Jack stayed with Parker, while Carly went to get JJ and Sage from the farm. Parker asked Jack why he and Carly were fighting at the hospital and Jack explained he was angry that Carly hadn't called him. Parker told his father that he and the other kids were tired of all the fighting between their parents. Parker thought it was best if Jack and Carly stayed away from one another if they couldn't get along. \n\n\nWhen Carly arrived at the farm she found Holden and the kids playing a game and explained that Parker was fine and back at home with Jack. Holden invited her to stick around for a while and play. Carly sat down and enjoyed the game, but after one round decided to take a break outside. Holden followed her and asked if she was all right. Carly admitted that she was sad watching Parker and Jack together because she knew she would never have that closeness with Jack again. Holden and Carly discussed their relationship troubles and encouraged one another to keep moving forward. \n\n\nWhen Carly returned home with the kids, Jack offered to help her with dinner. Carly was worried that Jack just wanted to argue more about the family, but Jack had learned a lot from his talk with Parker and promised it would be a nice \"quiet\" dinner. \n\n\nIn the hospital corridor, Chris ran into Alison who claimed to be sick, but Chris thought she was just nervous about her first day of nursing school. She ran off into the on-call room and began to throw-up in the bathroom. Chris apologized for not believing she was really sick and offered to help her. He gave her a quick examination and told her she probably had the stomach flu. As Chris was comforting Alison, a nurse walked in and assumed she had walked in on a romantic moment between the two. A short while later, Alison got sick again and managed to get her shirt dirty. Chris offered to clean it up for her and started to help her out of her blouse, as the nurse walked in again and quickly excused herself. Alison looked at Chris and the pair started laughing at the idea of the rumors that would soon be flying around the hospital. Chris admitted that he wouldn't mind if people thought he was dating Alison and he leaned in to kiss her, but his pager went off and he told her he had to take the call. \n\n\n",
