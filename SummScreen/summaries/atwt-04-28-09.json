He said the boy's tantrum had resulted from Liberty's asking Parker to sign the annulment papers. Carly decided to call Craig to see if he had heard from Parker, and Jack hated that, but he, too, was desperate to know if the boy was all right. \n\n\nParker found Craig in the Lakeview bar and told him that what he had bought with the $50,000 from his trust fund was parked in the hotel garage. Craig was stunned that Parker had obviously bought a car, but before he could ask any questions, he received Carly's call. He reassured her that Parker was all right, so Carly asked Craig to send the boy home right away. Craig said he could not give Parker orders, but he could convey the message. \n\n\nLily and Holden went home, and Lily was very upset about the murdered bodyguard. She freaked out about what the kidnappers might have done to Luke and Noah. Meanwhile at the storage locker, Zac held Damian at gunpoint. He laughingly told Damian not to worry about Luke; at the moment, Luke was in beautiful hands that knew exactly what they were doing. Zac intimated that Zoe was making a man of Luke, as Damian realized that it had been Zac who had stabbed him some days earlier in Old Town. \n\n\nInside, Zoe attempted to arouse Luke, who called her crazy. He was horrified that Zoe wanted to get pregnant with his child, and he insisted that he would not cooperate. Zoe threatened to withhold Noah's medications unless Luke gave in to her, and she began trying to open Luke's pants. Luke flailed his legs and was able to pin down Zoe, who began to scream loudly. \n\n\nZac heard the girl's screams, and he pushed Damian ahead of him, and they both entered the locker. Zac aimed his gun at Luke, and Damian made his move. He jumped Zac, and the two wrestled for control. \n\n\nDamian got the gun and ordered Zoe to move away from Luke. He also demanded that Zac untie the boys. Suddenly the door flew open and Margo and her backup stormed in. Luke explained that Noah needed immediate medical attention, and Margo assured him that an ambulance was on its way. She also relieved Damian of the pistol and read the Zs their rights. \n\n\nParker arrived home and told his parents that he was fine. He told them that all he had wanted was the freedom to make his own choices, and he felt he had achieved that. Parker whipped out car keys, and Jack jumped to the conclusion that Craig had, once again, loaned the boy his car. Parker said the keys were his own because he had bought a car. He invited them to check out the snazzy convertible sports car parked at the curb. \n\n\nCarly and Jack ran outside and were speechless. Parker explained that Craig had given him $50,000 to spend as he wished. He was grateful that Craig had made it happen. Jack told Parker to stay with his mother, and Jack took off. \n\n\nIn Memorial Hospital, Luke, Lily, and Holden visited with Noah, who was a patient. Luke told his folks that the gunshot wound in Noah's shoulder was infected, so Noah was on antibiotics, but he would be fine. Lily and Holden celebrated a happy ending and hugged Luke. None of them saw Damian looking through the door. Damian's phone rang, and the caller was Margo, who asked him to go to the Oakdale police station. Damian agreed, and left without speaking to anyone. \n\n\nIn Noah's room, Holden decided to go talk to Margo, and he left. Lily and Luke went into the hall, and Lily explained that Damian had figured out that the kidnapper, Zoe, was Gia Pinarossa. Luke asked if she was truly a Grimaldi, so Lily said it was possible. Luke suddenly realized that it had been Damian who saved his life. \n\n\nDamian arrived at the police station, and Margo dropped the bomb that the Zs were blaming Damian for everything, and had declared that he was the mastermind behind the whole scheme. Damian protested that he had done nothing but try to protect his son, but Margo continued to argue with him that perhaps he could have hired them to do his dirty work. Holden walked in and overheard some of the conversation. \n\n\nA furious Damian rushed into the interview room and grabbed Zac by the throat. Margo tried to pull him off, and she yelled threats at Damian. Zac immediately asked for police protection if he had to testify against Damian, and Zoe spoke up by calling Damian, \"cousin.\" She swore that Damian had told her that his plan was the best way to get the foundation money back. Damian was angry at their lies, and he went outside. \n\n\nHolden asked what was going on, so Damian told him he was being accused of planning the kidnapping. Damian asked Holden to please call Lily and get her there since she had seen the evidence about Zoe/Gia. Holden refused, however. He said Lily had been through enough. \n\n\nCarly talked with Parker about his car and began laying down rules. Parker said he felt the car was Craig's way of apologizing for trying to interfere in the teens' marriage. He was sure Craig had seen the error of his ways, but Carly looked upon the new car as a bribe. \n\n\nIn the hospital, Luke thanked Noah, but he also urged him not to be a hero any more. Noah called Zoe a \"psycho slut,\" as Lily retuned to the room. She decided to give the boys their privacy, and she went into the hall to make some phone calls of good tidings. The boys held hands, and Noah asked Luke what he was going to do about the fact that Damian had been vindicated of any wrongdoing. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Jack confronted Craig about Parker's new car. He told Craig to \"keep the gospel according to Craig\" away from Jack's family, but Craig said he was mostly concerned about helping Parker because it was the right thing to do. Jack thought it all came down to Carly and to Craig's sniffing around her. Craig called Jack a \"self-righteous judgmental jerk,\" and he further denigrated Jack's parenting skills. Jack countered by reminding Craig that his daughter, Lucy, had run away for years with her baby brother. Craig said he'd had it with Jack and his family, and he walked out. \n\n\nJack's phone rang, and a cop called him down to the docks to a homicide. Jack left immediately, calling Carly on the way. He told her he was on a case, but that nothing had changed with Craig. Carly said she had to go to Metro, and she once again asked Parker to drive safely in his new car. Carly could not find her own car keys, so Parker offered to drive her to Metro in his new toy. Carly at first refused, but then she couldn't resist the fun it would be to feel the wind in her hair in a convertible, so she agreed. \n\n\nHolden returned to Memorial, and he told Luke and Lily that the Zs were accusing Damian of masterminding the kidnapping plot. Much to Holden's dismay, Luke defended Damian, and he decided to go see Margo and explain what he had seen and heard. When he arrived at the station, he told Margo to let his birth father go. He relayed how much Zoe hated Damian because of the money she felt was rightfully her mother's. He said he had been trapped with the Zs for days, and he knew that Damian was not involved. Luke chose not to speak directly with Damian, but he assured Margo that Zoe and Zac had worked alone. \n\n\nAt the docks, Jack identified the dead body as that of Cesar. The cop on the scene said that Cesar had stopped a boat from leaving, and on board they showed Jack some M-16 rifles that they had found in crates, hidden under bottles of vodka. He handed Jack one of the vodka bottles, and Jack recognized the Midnight Sun label. \n\n\nCarly went into Metro and found Craig drinking there. She began carping at him, but Craig had taken all he was going to from her and Jack. He told Carly that he was done with her; she had pushed him away for the last time. He congratulated her on winning, and he presented her with a check and said he was buying out her interest in Midnight Sun. Carly was reluctant to walk away from what was beginning to look like a profitable business, but Craig said they needed to wash their hands of one another. \n\n\nAt the police department, Holden returned and apologized to Damian and thanked him for saving Luke. He said he was sorry he had been so hard on Damian, but he wanted to make a suggestion: Damian should leave Oakdale. Surprisingly, Damian said he understood, and when Margo said he was free to go, he hinted that he was on his way out of the country. \n\n\nBack at Memorial, Luke explained to Noah what had happened at the police station, but Noah could not believe that Luke had not actually spoken to Damian. Lily and Holden came in, and Holden said he had suggested that Damian leave town as soon as possible, and he was thinking they had seen the last of Damian Grimaldi. Luke asked Lily if she agreed that Damian should leave, and Lily said she thought it was for the best. \n\n\nLily went to the Lakeview, however, and waited in the lobby for Damian. When he arrived, she told him she was grateful for what he had done for Luke. She also apologized for misjudging him. Damian responded that he hoped that one day Luke could forgive him, as well. He told Lily that she still meant the world to him, and he kissed her hand. \n\n\nWhen Damian went up to his room, he was surprised to find Luke waiting there. Luke said that he had realized that he did not really know Damian, and he asked his father to stay longer. Damian was stunned, but he agreed. \n\n\nCarly wanted to talk more with Craig, but he explained that she could accept the check from him then, or take it later from his lawyer. Carly did not want him to leave, and she reminded him how well they worked together. He told her to take the money and move on. Jack arrived and announced that he needed them both to go to the police station for questioning.\n\n\n",
