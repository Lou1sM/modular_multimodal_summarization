    "soap_central": "\n\n \nDr. Reid Oliver and Luke returned from Texas and walked into Katie's house.  Reid found a note from Katie saying that she and Jacob were having dinner with Nancy Hughes, and, by the way, Reid's rent was due.  Reid said he owed Luke at least a pizza and a beer, but Luke reminded the doctor that he didn't drink.  Reid mentioned their not ever talking about the kiss between them in Dallas, and he said it wouldn't happen again, unless Luke wanted it to.  Luke smiled, took off his coat, and said that a pizza sounded fine.\n\n\nThey tried to watch a baseball game on television, but the cable was out.  Reid said he hated small talk, but he did mention that Luke was probably sick of it from Noah.  He also said that Noah had kicked Luke out because he was still punishing Luke for the accident that injured Noah's eyes.  Luke said it had definitely been his fault because he had distracted his boyfriend while Noah was setting up the fireworks.  Dr. Oliver still thought Noah's behavior was \"rude.\"  He elaborated by saying it was not fair for Noah to ask Luke to put his life on hold, and Luke should be sick of it.\n\n\nLuke stood up and reached for his coat.  Reid said they could talk about all sorts of things, including the kiss.  They stood by the door, and Luke said he could not deny that he had enjoyed the kiss, and he considered it a compliment to be wanted by someone like Reid.  They were about to kiss again when the doorbell rang.  Dr. Oliver answered it and told the pizza deliveryman that he had \"lousy timing.\"  The doctor's phone rang, so he asked Luke to answer it while he paid for the pizza.  The caller was Noah, so Luke gave him the good news that he and Reid were back from Texas, and the medical board had reinstated Reid.\n\n\nNoah announced that was a good thing because his surgery was scheduled for the next day.  Luke was surprised that Reid hadn't mentioned it, and Noah asked if Luke was calling Noah's doctor \"Reid\" instead of \"Dr. Oliver.\"  Noah seemed hurt, and he hung up rather quickly.  Luke turned to Reid and asked what kind of game he was playing.  Dr. Oliver said he hadn't told Luke about Noah's impending surgery because only family members were privy to that information.  He cited \"doctor/patient privilege\" as the reason not to talk about anything medical that concerned Noah.  He also reminded Luke that Noah knew when he was having surgery, and he hadn't bothered to tell Luke either.  \"I don't play games, Luke,\" the doctor said.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, she and Lucinda were still discussing Gabriel and the fact that he was the son Craig did not know he had.  Lily wondered if she should call the boy and ask him to pay them a visit.  Lucinda was against that, and she assumed that the boy had found his father and gotten a job there, and the rest was none of their business.  Lily said they had made it their business when they had conspired with Sierra to keep the whole thing a secret.  Lily referred to Gabriel's mother as \"Lydia,\" and she said the woman could not explain it to her son because she was dead.  Lily thought it was their job to enlighten the boy, but her mother disagreed.\n\n\nLily picked up the phone and said she was also going to tell Craig the truth, but Lucinda went ballistic.  She was angry that Lily thought Craig had any rights at all since he had cheated on Sierra with Lydia for starters, and then he had ended up stealing Lucinda's company from her.  Lily felt bad that they had denied Craig the right to be a father to his boy, but Lucinda said, \"Tell me why I should give a damn.\"  The two of them argued, and Lucinda felt passionately that Craig would do to Gabriel what he had done to everyone else who had ever loved him: grab him, use him, disappoint him, and then hurt him.  She reminded Lily that her dead grandson, Bryant, would confirm that if he could.\n\n\nLily thought that Craig was a better man than the Craig who had raised Bryant and Lucy, and she cited Johnny as her example.  Lucinda argued that Gabriel had probably found out that Craig was his father because he had gotten the job at Monte Carlo, so she suggested that he had an agenda; she thought they should let him play it out.  Besides, she added, if Craig found out that Lily and Lucinda had kept the secret so long, \"all hell would break loose.\"  Lily suggested that, given a second chance, Craig would do things differently.\n\n\nAt Java, Faith questioned Parker about his missing trust fund and Craig.  Parker said he was sure that both Gabriel and Craig were stealing, but Faith found it hard to believe that Gabriel was involved.  Parker called the boy \"scum,\" and he was worried that Craig had hidden the money on a tropical isle somewhere.  He decided that he needed to talk to the police, and Faith offered to go with him.\n\n\nThe two teens went to the police station, and they saw Margo.  Parker was hesitant to discuss the matter with her because she was Craig's sister, but when the boy said he was there to file a complaint because he'd been \"ripped off,\" she insisted on helping them personally.  Margo then got a phone call about a fire at 256 Riverfront Drive, so she left immediately.  Parker whispered to Faith that was the address of Monte Carlo, and they had to go because the place was on fire.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Craig invited Carly out to dinner, and she asked him how he could afford to take her out if Ellis had all his money.  Craig promised to find the money and to restore Monte Carlo, and he vowed to take Carly to a \"classy Chicago restaurant.\"  Carly agreed, but she warned him not to get \"any funny ideas,\" and she was talking about the passionate kiss they had shared earlier. As Carly went upstairs to get dressed for dinner, Craig muttered, \"And we'll dine while Monte Carlo burns.\"  Carly returned downstairs, and Craig tried to hurry her up.  Carly took the time to write a note to Parker, and then her phone rang.  Craig grimaced, and he knew that it was the fire department notifying Carly of the fire at their business.\n\n\nInside the Monte Carlo offices, the smoke got thicker, and Gabriel struggled to get on his feet.  He could not breathe well, and his head ached.  He could not see his way to the door, and he fell into a corner.\n\n\nOutside the building, Carly and Craig arrived, and Margo ran up while the firefighters worked in the background.  She led them to the fire chief, but Carly said she would catch up because she had spotted Parker and Faith running to the scene.  Parker begged his mother to have the firefighters check the building to see if anyone was in there, and he was insistent about it.  He ran to the building himself, remembering that he had left Gabriel unconscious on the floor.\n\n\nInside, a firefighter cleared the office, but he missed Gabriel who was in a heap in the corner.  Outside, Carly ran after Parker but had a hard time restraining her son.  She finally made the two teens leave the area, and Craig and Margo returned with no information.  Craig suggested that the fire might have been electrical in origin because Carly had hired \"some kid\" to do some wiring.  Carly was hoping that there was only smoke damage in the office, but Craig said it was way more than that.  Carly asked about their insurance, and Craig played dumb except to say that he thought it was enough to rebuild the business.\n\n\nParker asked Faith to stay by the fire truck, and he approached a firefighter and said he had seen someone in a third floor window, and he pointed out exactly where.  The firefighter said they would find anybody in there, and he ran to tell his men.  Faith asked Parker if he was getting premonitions like the ones he had as a child, and Parker answered yes.\n\n\nMargo ran to Craig and Carly yelling that they had found someone in the building.  Craig was stunned, but he joined Carly in running closer to the building.  The firefighters took out Gabriel on a gurney, but he was not conscious.  Everyone watched the firefighters load the boy into the ambulance, and Margo asked Carly if Gabriel had a key to the office.  Carly said yes, and then Margo asked about family for the boy.  Neither Craig nor Carly could help with that, so Carly went looking for Parker and Faith.  As Carly walked around the fire truck, Parker was admitting to Faith that he had followed Gabriel to the office and accused him of stealing.\n\n\n Gabriel had blamed Craig, and then Parker had slugged the boy, who fell backwards and hit his head.  Parker swore he knew nothing of the fire, however, and when he had left Gabriel, the boy was unconscious but breathing.  Faith said that Parker had done nothing wrong, and he agreed and reminded her that he was the one who had gotten robbed.  Carly heard this last sentence of Parker's, and she asked what he had meant.  Parker made up a story about not getting a grade he deserved at school, and he asked his mother if Gabriel was going to be all right.  Carly said she hoped so, as Craig ran up.  He said that Margo reported that Gabriel was in serious condition, and the hospital was calling in a specialist.  Craig and Carly headed for the hospital, and Parker, yelling at Faith to go home, ran after them.\n\n\nFaith went to Lily's and was obviously upset when she burst in on her mother and Lucinda.  She said she couldn't find Holden, and Lily asked what was wrong. Faith said that \"the guy\" Lily had been interrogating her about had gotten caught in a fire and might die.  Lily and Lucinda were thunderstruck, and Lily went to hug her daughter, but Faith pushed her mother away and told her not to even pretend to be sorry.  Faith ran out, and Lucinda said the tough decision had been taken out of their hands, because if Gabriel died, no one needed to know his background.  Lily was angry, and said she could not be a part of that.\n\n\nDr. Oliver got paged to return to the hospital, so Luke went home.  He found Noah sitting on the patio, so they went inside to talk.  Noah said he was freaking out about his surgery, and he was frightened, and Luke was the only person he wanted to be with.  Noah apologized for pulling away from Luke and hurting him, and he said the thought of not having anyone waiting for him to get through surgery was horrifying.  Luke said if Noah wanted him there, he would be there every step of the way.  Luke hugged his ex and told him everything would be okay.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Craig told Margo that he had no background on Gabriel, nor did Carly.  Carly said she had hired the boy, but she hadn't done any paperwork on him yet.  Craig said he knew the boy lived at the Lakeview, but he also called him \"a drifter.\"  That raised Margo's eyebrows, and she questioned how a \"drifter\" and a handyman could afford to live at an expensive hotel.  Gabriel's doctor, Dr. Matthews, walked by, and he said that Dr. Oliver was on his way for a consultation.  Reid arrived, and Dr. Matthews said that he had covered the burns and smoke inhalation problems, but Dr. Oliver was needed for the blunt trauma to the boy's head.  Dr. Oliver, followed by Margo, went in to examine Gabriel, and Craig went to get coffee.\n\n\nCarly dragged Parker away as soon as they were alone, and she shoved him into an empty room for privacy.  She told her son not to play dumb with her, and she asked how Parker knew there was someone in that building.  He lied and said it was one of his \"premonitions,\" but Carly didn't buy it.  She also asked about his being robbed comment, but Parker tried to make a break for it.  Carly grabbed her son and demanded to know what was going on.\n\n\nThe doctors left Gabriel's room, and Margo told Craig that the boy had been knocked out by a blunt force to his head before the fire started.  She asked Craig what he knew, but he answered that he knew \"next to nothing and cared less.\" Margo left to return to the scene, and she learned that the fire was out, and no firefighters were injured.  It was too soon, however, for an answer as to how the blaze had started.  Margo suggested an electrical origin, and the chief said it that was so, it could be a case of arson.\n\n\nCraig watched Gabriel through the window in the boy's room, and Lily walked up behind him and startled him.  She said she had heard that someone had been hurt in a fire in the Monte Carlo building.  Craig pointed to Gabriel and called him \"a stupid kid\" who worked for them sometimes.  Craig said if \"the idiot\" hadn't sneaked into the office, he would not have gotten hurt.  Lily asked him not to call the boy \"an idiot,\" and she looked sad.  Craig asked if something was wrong, and Lily asked him if he remembered Lydia Carras.  Craig got a strange look on his face and said, \"Of course.\"  Lily said that Gabriel was Lydia's son, and Craig's.  \"That boy lying there is your son,\" repeated Lily.\n\n\n",
