Then Tom calls Jack and tells him that Keith has agreed to the exhumation of Julia's body and that they are at the cemetery and he would like Jack to be there, too. Jack tells Carly that he has to go.\n\n\nAt the cemetery, Keith changes his mind and tells Tom that the exhumation is not going to happen, at least not today. But Tom gives Lily some privacy with Keith, and she is able to talk him into it again.\n\n\nAt the Port of Oakdale warehouse, Craig, \"John Hwa,\" Dusty, Paul, and some \"customs officers\" are examining the shipment of clothing from Singapore. Margo arrives and questions Hwa, who explains that Craig told him something illegal would be added to the shipment before it left Singapore, and that Craig had threatened to cancel his contract if he didn't go along with this. Margo tastes some of the white powder the customs officers have found in the tags of the jeans, and from the look on her face, Craig assumes it's actually cocaine. Craig says Dusty and Paul and Barbara are setting him up to keep him from being involved with Jennifer and the baby, and that Barbara even tried to poison him, but Margo tells him that's a bit far-fetched, and she points out that Barbara wouldn't have poisoned him if she'd wanted Craig to be at the warehouse when the shipment arrived. She reads Craig his rights and handcuffs him.\n\n\nMargo takes Craig in her car, supposedly to jail. She tells Craig he could get 30 years if he's convicted of the cocaine smuggling and that she doubts a judge will believe his conspiracy theory. Craig insists he was set up, but he says that Margo can't possibly live with being the one to turn him in on charges she knows can't be true, and that she could simply let him go now. Margo stops the car and tells Craig that if he leaves, he can never come back to Oakdale or contact any of his family, that he'll have to leave the country and assume a new identity because she will have to put out an APB for him when she gets back to the station. He is upset that she thinks he'll have to avoid everyone he knows, especially the unborn child that he assumes is his, but he agrees that it is necessary. Margo gives him his passport and all the money she has with her and tells him to walk down the road to the airport and get on a plane leaving the country. Craig hugs Margo and tells her she's doing the right thing; she says it's a matter of love, and that love and doing the right thing don't always go together.\n\n\nAt the Street Jeans office, Barbara imagines Craig walking into the office, telling her he got Margo to confess that this was all a plot to destroy him and saying that he will destroy Barbara, Paul, and Jennifer. Then the illusion is shattered when Sierra walks into the room and tells Barbara that Dusty called to say they were on their way back. When Dusty and Paul arrive at Street Jeans, they tell Barbara and Sierra that things didn't go well for Craig. They then wonder whether Margo did her part, but Margo walks in and says that Craig is gone for good, and that she hated every minute of her role in it. She wonders where Craig will end up, and Paul says \"where we least expect him to.\"\n\n\nOn an airplane, Craig is seated next to a woman who asks him if he's been to Bangkok before and how he likes it. He tells her he's had business there before but that his Far East business is over now. When she asks if it's a nice place, Craig says that he hopes it is.\n\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses is reading a room service menu from the Hotel Bangkok. When she turns around and removes the sunglasses, we see that it's Roseanna.\n\n\nBack at Metro, Carly tells Rafael where Jack has gone and puts up a brave front, saying that \"courage is good.\" She continues blathering to him until she realizes he has to get back to work. She sees a woman whom she thinks is Lily and approaches her, only to find out it's not Lily, and then she spots a sinister-looking man at a nearby table and begins to freak out. On her way out the door, she tells Rafael that she's leaving to go find Jack, and that as a cop's wife, she can handle things like going to a cemetery. To herself, she adds, \"Being alone, I can't handle.\"\n\n\nAt the grave site, there's no one around, and Carly almost stumbles into Julia's opened grave. She approaches the headstone and talks to Julia, saying she's sorry that she's dead, but she wishes Julia would be out of her life now so that her life could get back to normal. Carly's cell phone rings, but when she answers it, there's no one there, and then she accidentally bumps her purse, which falls into the grave. Carly then hears a noise and looks up to see a man with a shovel. Terrified, she begins to back up, telling him to stay away from her, and she falls into the open grave.\n\n\nAt police headquarters, Lucinda finds Jack and tells him she thinks Keith might have planted Julia's cell phone at the halfway house in order to keep Les Sweeney in jail. Jack tells her not to go public with an accusation like that and says they're working on new developments in the murder case now. Then he insists he has to leave to get back to Carly.\n\n\nAt the cemetery, Carly screams for help, and Jack jumps into the grave, scaring her badly. She clings to him desperately, and he tells her the man she saw is Pete, the groundskeeper, who tells her that she scared him, too. Carly and Jack return to Metro, where Jack suggests that she needs some time away from Oakdale and should perhaps go to Montana for a few days. She says she won't go anywhere without him right now. He tells her they've got a new lead in the case and that it will all be over soon; Carly tells him, \"I really need it to be over. We all do.\"\n\n\nAt the police station, Ben tells Tom, Lily, and Keith that Julia died of anaphylactic shock and wonders what she might have been allergic to. Keith says she was allergic to bees, having almost died when she was stung once when she was 7 years old. Tom wants to know who else knew about this, and Keith says he knew and so did Les and JJ. Lily notes that it was still winter when Julia died, and the bees wouldn't have been around, but Ben says bee pollen or bee venom would also produce a severe allergic reaction and could have been injected into Julia. Keith suggests a scenario in which Les leaves the halfway house and goes to Julia's apartment, telling her he has court papers ordering joint custody of JJ. Julia would have told Les that wasn't going to happen, and Keith imagines Les taking out a syringe and injecting Julia in the thigh with bee pollen. Tom says that this would make it premeditated murder and that if guilty, Les would get a life sentence for that, but he says they need more proof. Keith walks out, telling Lily he needs to be alone for a while to deal with all of this, and he leaves the police station. A few moments later, Tom tells Lily that Ben indeed found a possible injection site on Julia's thigh and that he will have the police execute a full search of the halfway house and the hotel where Les was living after he left the halfway house to see what they can find. He tells her he has not been able to reach Keith on his cell phone to give him this news, but says that if she talks to Keith, she can tell him that they're closing in and are about to catch the killer.\n\n\nAt Julia's grave, Keith approaches the headstone and tells Julia that it's almost over now and they will finally all be at peace. He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes a bottle labeled \"bee pollen.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Carly 's fear of Les is so strong she is scared to be alone because she sees his face every where and jumps at the slightest noise. Barbara, Dusty, Paul, and Sierra's plan to get rid of Craig works like a charm. Craig gets on a plane to Thailand promising Margo he will never return to Oakdale again. Rosanna is also on her way to Thailand. Who Knows if Craig will find Rosanna. The results of the second autopsy reveal that Julia died from a severe allergic reaction to bees. Keith informs the police that he, Les and J.J were the only people aware of Julia's allergy to bees. Later we see Keith at the cemetery telling Julia that soon they will all have peace. Keith takes a bottle of bee pollen out of his pocket..",
