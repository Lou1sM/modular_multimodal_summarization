Parker said he didn't care if Carly and Jack got back together, but he did want them to stop biting each other's head off every chance they had. Jack arrived unexpectedly and asked Carly if he could take Parker to school. Carly reminded Jack that he was supposed to call first before coming to visit, but she agreed to let him give Parker a ride because she didn't want to fight anymore. \n\n\nLuke told Holden he was moving in with Noah and Ameera, which Holden thought was a bad idea. Luke agreed it wasn't the best of situations, but he felt it would be better than not seeing Noah at all. Luke said he wanted to have with Noah what Holden and Lily had, and he was afraid it would slip through his fingers if he didn't do something about it. Holden wished Luke luck. \n\n\nWhen Luke arrived at the cottage, only Ameera was there. Luke started to put his things away, but Ameera said Luke should move into the bedroom with Noah, and she would move into the living room because she was the guest, not Luke. Luke told Ameera he knew the living arrangements would be hard on her, because of the way she felt about Noah. Ameera brushed Luke off, saying she was fine. Noah returned home with groceries and told Luke he'd gotten all his favorite foods. Ameera watched as the two young men interacted with one another, then left the room, clearly uncomfortable. \n\n\nNoah and Luke went into the bedroom, and Luke said his dad was right about the situation being \"an emotional time bomb.\" Noah said he didn't care, because he had missed Luke. Noah closed the bedroom doors and told Luke he should unpack. Noah and Luke were about to kiss when Luke saw Ameera's shadow outside the bedroom door. Noah said there was nothing they could do about Ameera's presence, but Luke said he would leave. Noah couldn't believe Luke wanted to leave, but Luke said until he could truly be alone with Noah, it was too painful to be around him. He took his bag and hurried out, telling Ameera she could have her bed back. \n\n\nLuke returned to the farm, where Holden found him sitting on the porch. Holden asked if Luke had decided not to move in with Noah, and Luke said yes, because if he and Noah were going to be together, it had to be the way it was supposed to be and nothing less. \n\n\nCarly went grocery shopping and dropped one of her bags in the parking lot as she tried to open her car trunk. Holden appeared, teasing Carly about not having a shopping cart. He helped her pick up her spilled groceries and asked her if she'd had a run-in with Jack again. Carly said no, but things were still tense. Carly asked if Holden had talked to Lily, and he told her that he and Lily kept missing each other. They bid each other goodbye, but when Carly got in her car, it wouldn't start. \n\n\nHolden asked Carly to let him try starting it. He couldn't get the car started either and told Carly her battery was dead. Carly's car still wouldn't start after Holden tried to jumpstart it, so Holden told Carly he would call a garage to tow the car, and she could put her groceries in his car and ride back with him. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Carly put the groceries away while Holden lamented not having Lily around to help him with Faith and Natalie. Holden was worried about what he would be able to find for the girls to do over the summer if Lily wasn't back yet, and Carly said that was what summer camp was for. Carly told Holden she felt bad about her kids being so tense because of the situation with her and Jack; Holden felt the same way about his kids and their uneasiness because of his situation with Lily. Carly said the kids should be able to be kids for a couple of months and not have to worry about those things, and that was why she was thinking about a summer camp for her kids. Carly told Holden she planned to check out a nearby camp the next day. However, she got a call from the garage and found out her car wouldn't be ready for a week. When Carly said that meant she couldn't check out the camp, Holden said he would take her. \n\n\nCarly told Holden she could wait a week to check out the camp, but Holden said he'd like to see it, too. He told her Emma could watch the kids, both his and Carly's, but Carly said Jack would probably appreciate the extra time with his kids. Holden said they could work out the logistics in the morning. As he was about to leave, Carly offered to make him lunch, to repay him for all his help. Holden said he would take a rain check, and Carly thanked him again for all his help. \n\n\nBrad and Katie woke up and began kissing, until Katie remembered Liberty, who was asleep on the couch. They went outside in the hallway to talk, and Brad said he couldn't live like that for the two weeks it would take for the DNA results to come back. Katie had a solution: they would tell Liberty to go back to her mom's until they found out whether Brad was her father. Brad agreed, and he and Katie took Liberty to Al's Diner for breakfast. There, they ran into Jack and Parker. Parker recognized Liberty, who ran off before he could say anything. Brad asked how Parker knew Liberty, and Parker told him that Liberty was the girl who caused him to fall off his skateboard. Parker asked how Brad knew her, and Brad said, \"She might be my daughter.\" \n\n\nBrad explained the situation to Jack and Parker. A friend of Parker's arrived and asked if Parker wanted to ride to school with him; Jack agreed that Parker could leave with his friend. Katie went to check on Liberty. Jack asked Brad if he'd known about Liberty, and Brad said of course not. Katie returned and said Liberty had disappeared. Brad went to look for Liberty, while Katie waited at Al's with Jack in case Liberty returned. \n\n\nJack asked Katie how she was doing, and Katie said she was fine. Jack thought she might be angry, but Katie said it wasn't as though Brad had a secret family he had stashed in Chicago without her knowledge. Katie didn't see anything to be angry about, and she told Jack she loved Brad and wasn't going to blow their relationship. She then told Jack she needed to get to work and asked him to tell Brad where she'd gone. \n\n\nBrad found Liberty in the park and asked her why she had run. Liberty said she was worried Parker's dad would arrest her for a \"hit and run,\" but Brad assured her that unless she purposely jumped in front of Parker, she wasn't in any trouble. Brad then suggested Liberty go apologize to Parker, and they headed back to Al's. Jack told them that Katie had gone to work. Liberty asked where Parker was so she could apologize to him; Jack told her Parker had gone to school. Brad asked Liberty to order some coffee and food to go. After she walked away, Jack asked Brad how he thought Katie was dealing with the Liberty situation. Brad told Jack it was none of his business. \n\n\nJack said that just because Katie said she was okay with it didn't mean she was. Brad told Jack he wasn't interested in his \"super-sensitive Katie radar,\" and he told him to butt out. Brad then got ready to leave and asked Jack to please bring Parker to the studio later so Liberty could apologize to him. Brad and Liberty went to WOAK, where Brad asked Katie how she was really doing. Katie said she was fine, and she asked if Brad had told Liberty that they thought she should go back home to stay with her mother. Brad told Katie he couldn't tell Liberty when she'd been so upset. He also said he didn't think he would feel right if he sent Liberty back to what might not be a good situation with her mother and later found out she was indeed his daughter. He asked if Katie could handle it if Liberty stayed until they knew the outcome, and Katie said she could, because they were in it together. \n\n\nParker walked into WOAK and saw Liberty, who apologized to him for the hit and run. Parker accepted her apology, and Liberty asked if they were cousins, since Brad and Jack were brothers. Parker said Jack had adopted him and that Liberty might not turn out to be Brad's daughter. Liberty said she was sure she was. \n\n\nMeg waited with Mike at the hospital until the doctor came to examine him, then stepped outside, where she ran into Paul. She asked Paul if he was following her, but Paul said he was there for an appointment with a therapist. Meg was surprised and pleased to learn that Paul had decided to seek help to try to stabilize his life, until Paul said he was doing it for her. Meg told Paul she was happy he was going to therapy, but she told him he had to do it for himself, because she couldn't give him any guarantees that she'd be waiting for him at the end. Paul insisted the only reason he was doing it was to try to win her back. Meg told Paul firmly that therapy or not, they might not ever get back together, and until Paul understood that, she wasn't sure she should be around him. \n\n\nMeg took Mike back to the Lakeview, where she filled him in on Paul's decision to undergo therapy and his motivation for it. Mike said Paul treated Meg like a possession, which was wrong and even potentially dangerous, and that Meg shouldn't care what Paul did anymore. Meg said the problem was that she did care, and she felt bad about having argued with Paul about his therapy. Meg then called the hospital and found out from a friend that Paul had canceled his therapy appointment. She felt guilty about making Paul feel he was hopeless, but Mike said maybe he was. Meg disagreed and left to go see Paul. \n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds, where he poured himself a stiff drink. Sofie came in, and Paul told her to go away, saying Barbara needed her back at the Lakeview. Sofie said it looked like Paul needed her more. She asked Paul what had happened, and Paul told her he had tried to do whatever Meg needed to get her to love him again, but it wasn't enough. Sofie told Paul he shouldn't turn himself inside out trying to make someone love him. She said she had done that herself for years, and it was a form of abuse. Paul said their situations were nothing alike. Sofie said Paul was good enough the way he was, but Paul said he was nothing without Meg. \n\n\nPaul said Meg was probably right about him being damaged goods, but Sofie told him to stop saying that. Sofie said if Meg couldn't see what a wonderful man Paul was, there were plenty of women who could. Paul said, \"Name one,\" and Sofie replied, \"Me,\" and kissed him. Meg arrived at Fairwinds and walked into the room where Paul and Sofie were half-undressed, kissing passionately on the sofa. \n\n\n",
