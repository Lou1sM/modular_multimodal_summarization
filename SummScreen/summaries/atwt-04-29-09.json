The girl was unresponsive to most of her mother's comments, so finally Janet asked if she was having second thoughts about her annulment. Liberty said no, but she was worried about how hard Parker took the news. She felt as if she had abandoned him, and she mused that Parker had experienced many rotten things in his life. Janet said that a teenage marriage was not a recipe for stability, however. Liberty said she really missed Parker, so Janet suggested she go upstairs and just relax. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Sage told Parker she was hungry, but Carly had not yet returned home. Parker offered his little sister a ride in his new convertible, but Sage did not believe that the snazzy car parked outside was really his. Parker finally convinced her, and he pulled out a wad of money from his pocket. He peeled off $1000 and gave it to her with the advice that she might have to use it some day to protect herself. \n\n\nSage asked some pertinent questions about her brother's trust fund, so he explained that Craig had wanted him to feel better about what had happened with Liberty. He scrounged in the kitchen and found some bagels to toast, and he told Sage to put the money somewhere safe. \n\n\nWhen Jack arrived at Metro and asked Carly and Craig to accompany him to the police station, Craig assumed the fuss was about Parker's new car. Jack corrected that, however, and said it was about finding smuggled weapons in their vodka shipment. Jack told them that, besides the guns, there was the issue of the stabbing death of Cesar Mendoza on the docks. Jack took the pair to the Oakdale Police Station where Margo quickly stifled Craig's attempts at jokes. She asked what they knew about Cesar, and Craig said he only knew that Cesar was the shipping supervisor at the docks and had been handling the transport of Midnight Sun vodka. \n\n\nJack pointed to one of the shipping crates that had been brought to the station and asked if it was one of Craig's. Craig said it definitely had their label on it, so Jack told him to open it. After Craig did so, Jack reached in and pulled out an M-16. Carly was horrified and asked how that had gotten into their crate. Jack said he wanted to know the same thing, while Craig remarked that obviously Cesar had a side business in place. Carly could not believe that Jack would think she and Craig were involved in any of what he was describing. \n\n\nDusty and Lucy helped Johnny complete a puzzle. The boy wanted to do one more before bedtime, and Lucy agreed, but she was worried that Craig would return home and find Dusty there. She also said she had no evidence against Craig to share with Dusty that might help him in another custody battle for his son. She was also concerned that she had not had a response from Cesar recently. \n\n\nBack at the police station, Margo asked Craig what he knew about Cesar. He said he knew nothing about him, and then he asked why he and Carly should help the police make a case against themselves. Craig accused Jack of wanting to get rid of him ever since he had returned to town, and he refused to say anything more without consulting his lawyer. Jack took Carly into a separate interview room, while Margo stayed with Craig and told him that he had only been in town for six months, and he was already in deep trouble with the law. She said she would call Lucy and tell her that Craig would be delayed indefinitely in getting back to Johnny. \n\n\nLucy took the call from Margo, and she heard the terrible news about Cesar. Lucy hung up and informed Dusty, who guessed that Fredo was probably the murderer. Lucy was feeling guilt for asking Cesar to unload the guns from her shipment. \n\n\nIn the interview room, Jack suggested that Craig was using the vodka company for the purpose of smuggling arms. Carly did not believe that for a minute, and the two of them argued loudly. Carly maintained that she knew absolutely nothing about any guns. \n\n\nJack called Janet, who rightly guessed that he would not be home in time for dinner. He asked her to go to Carly's and hang out with Parker and Sage. He declined to explain more, but he did tell her to be prepared to spend the night if it became necessary. Janet did not want to leave Liberty alone at the farm, so Jack said Janet had no choice but to take the girl with her. All Jack would say about Carly was that she could be in serious trouble. Janet promised to do as Jack asked. \n\n\nJanet and Liberty arrived at Carly's, and Parker felt hopeful when he saw that Liberty had a small suitcase with her. His hopes of her moving back in were dashed quickly, however, when Janet explained that Carly had gotten held up, and Jack was still at work. Parker immediately asked what trouble his mother was involved in, but Janet said only that it concerned the vodka company. \n\n\nParker put his coat on and said he was going outside for some air, and Liberty followed him. Parker asked her if she knew what was going on with his mother, but Liberty answered no. She noticed the sports car out in front of the house, however, so Parker explained about the money from his trust that Craig had given him. He offered her a ride, and the two of them took off. \n\n\nDusty put Johnny to bed, while Lucy continued to blame herself for involving Cesar in removing the weapons from her shipment. Someone knocked on the door, and Lucy was terrified that it was Craig, but she opened the door to find Margo. Margo said that Lucy might have to watch Johnny all night because Craig was facing some serious charges. She stated that she thought her brother was involved in Cesar's murder. She asked Lucy if Craig had ever indicated that Midnight Sun was a front for illegal activities. \n\n\nMargo got a call telling her that only Cesar's blood had been found at the murder site. Dusty began asking questions about Craig until Margo stopped him by asking if her brother knew that Dusty was with Johnny. She also asked Lucy why she was so sure that Craig was innocent. Dusty resented the third degree that Margo was giving them and requested to put off the questioning, and Margo agreed to talk with Lucy the next day. Margo was almost out the door when Lucy stopped her. She said that Craig had nothing to do with Cesar's death. \n\n\nJack put Craig in the interview room with Carly, hoping the two of them would turn on one another. Carly did jump on Craig for stashing guns in their shipment, but Craig argued with that, and both of them declared their innocence. Jack returned to the room, and Craig asked him to let Carly go. He said she had only met Cesar once, and she had no idea what was in the crates. He admitted that he knew, but Carly was sure he was lying to protect her. \n\n\nJack took Carly out, and she swore that Craig had nothing to do with smuggling guns or with any murder. Jack scolded Carly that she had ignored his advice and had gone into business with Craig. Carly told her ex-husband to go to hell. \n\n\nBack at Carly's house, Sage brought in a basket of clothes and said that she had to do laundry. Janet asked if she had gone through all the pockets, and Sage admitted she had forgotten. She and Janet checked pockets, and Janet discovered the wad of hundred dollar bills that Parker had given his sister. Sage explained that it was just change from Parker's car, but Janet kept it and offered to give it to Jack for safekeeping. She hugged Sage, and wondered what Parker had been thinking. \n\n\nCraig insisted that he would say nothing further without advice from his lawyer, so Jack and Margo released Carly. Jack offered to drive her home, and Carly accepted, but she wanted to speak to Craig first. She went into the interview room and asked him why he was trying to make the police think he was guilty. She begged him to tell the truth, but Craig said she should go home to her children. \n\n\nDusty asked Lucy if there was anything like written or phone records that might link her with Cesar, but she said no. She further revealed that she had paid for the drugs with cash, and all in small bills from different sources. Dusty thought she would be all right, but Lucy was not willing to let her father take the fall for a murder he did not commit. Dusty reminded her that Craig would not think twice about sending her to the slammer, but Lucy refused to be ruthless like her father. \n\n\nDusty next called his lawyer, and told Lucy that while Craig was in deep trouble was the perfect time for him to move on getting permanent custody of Johnny. Lucy was stunned that Dusty would use a lie to his own advantage like that, and they shouted back and forth. Their raised voices woke Johnny, who was worried that his other daddy was not home yet. Dusty reassured the boy that he was there. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker returned to Carly's, and Parker said he missed hanging out with her. He asked her to give their relationship another shot, but Liberty refused, and Parker stormed inside to his room. Liberty went inside and told Janet they had gone for a drive. She said she finally realized that it would be a very long time before she and Parker could be friends again. \n\n\nMargo asked Craig if he was ready to talk, but Craig kept mum. Margo was disappointed in him because she had hoped he had changed. Craig accused his sister of jumping to conclusions yet again, but a disgusted Margo walked out. A few minutes later, she and another officer took Craig to a cell for the night. \n\n\nCarly and Jack arrived at Carly's house, and Jack announced that it was time for his family to go back to the farm. They left, and Sage told Parker that their mother was home. Parker asked Carly if she had made bail, and she insisted that she had not been arrested. She said it had been only a misunderstanding and that soon the police would figure out the truth and release Craig. Sage went to bed, and Carly once again maintained her innocence to Parker. \n\n\nAt the farm, Jack asked Janet how Parker and Liberty had gotten along at Carly's. She said it had been much harder on Parker. Jack said that actually Carly had not appeared to know anything about the smuggling, but Craig had acted guilty. Janet pulled out the $1000 that she had taken from Sage's pocket and told Jack the story. Jack was upset, and Janet finally admitted that Jack might be right about Craig. \n\n\nCarly sneaked into the kitchen after the kids were in bed. She took a bottle of Midnight Sun from the refrigerator and poured herself a big shot. She paused to think a minute, but then she drank it down.\n\n\n",
