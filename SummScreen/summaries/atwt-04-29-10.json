    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt the farm, Meg and Emma discussed the impending custody hearing.  Holden was about to enter the kitchen, but he heard the women talking, so he hung back to listen.  He heard his mother reassure Meg that she had lots of family supporting her, but Meg said that wasn't enough.  She said she would wait outside, so Holden walked in as Meg passed him.  He questioned Emma about whether she was sure about what she was doing.  Emma was convinced that her daughter would be fine as long as she was at home with her family.\n\n\nHolden said that Emma would have to convince the judge of that, but his mother was confident.  She then began to scream at Holden that he didn't sound as if he was on his sister's side, and that hurt him.  Emma pleaded with Holden to go to the hearing and speak for Meg, and then she realized it was time to leave for court.  They went outside to get Meg, but she had disappeared.\n\n\nPaul and Emily also prepared to go to court, and Emily said there was no way the judge would give baby Eliza to Meg, a mental patient.  Paul was uneasy, however, and he wished that Meg had not allowed her mother to push her so far.  They were almost ready to leave when Meg suddenly walked in, asking for Paul. Paul was upstairs, so Meg had to deal with Emily.  Meg claimed that she didn't want to go to court, but Emily yelled that Meg was going to lose, anyway, so no wonder she didn't want to face the judge.  The two women argued, and Emily prevented Meg from going upstairs.\n\n\nEmily declared that, at Meg's request, she considered Eliza her baby with Paul, and Meg could not show up and take it all back.  They continued to spar until Emma showed up.  Paul called Emily upstairs, so she invited the Snyders to \"use the door.\"  Meg told her mother that Emily would make her look \"like a crazy woman\" in court, but Emma got fierce and said Meg had to be able to go right back at her and fight the way Emily did: \"dirty, dishonest, and to the death.\"\n\n\nOutside the courtroom, Paul and Meg greeted one another pleasantly, but Emma pushed Paul by asserting that the judge would decide in favor of Meg, since judges \"almost always sided with the mother.\"  When Paul responded, Emma said she didn't need advice from him.  Holden and Emma went into the courtroom, but Meg said she needed a moment to gather her thoughts.  When she was alone, Meg pulled out her phone and called \"First Edition,\" Emily's online newspaper.  She identified herself as a secretary at Deerbrook Psychiatric Hospital, and she said there were some wrong and dangerous practices going on there.  She said Deerbrook had just released a disturbed and dangerous patient in return for a big payoff from the patient's family.  The name of the patient, she said, was Meg Snyder.\n\n\nMeg walked into the courtroom just as Emily's phone rang.  Emily took the call and then dashed out of the room, as Meg looked smug.   The judge arrived, and Paul immediately asked if they could delay the proceedings for just a few minutes because his wife had been called away for an emergency.  Emma, however, retorted by publicly slamming Emily's priorities.  The judge called the case, and verified that Meg had been released into her mother's care.   Emma spoke up about her daughter's abuse at the hands of \"a horrible man,\" and she testified how much better Meg had been since she had returned home.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Emily arrived at Deerbrook, where she assailed the director of the hospital with accusations of wrongdoing.  She asked how much the Snyder family had paid for Meg's release, but the director said that all the doctors had agreed that Meg should go home.  He called security and told Emily that she had to leave, but Emily made some wild threats about shutting down the facility and pulling the doctors' medical licenses.  Emily said the way to make her go away was to go with Emily to the court and testify that they had made a mistake and released Meg Snyder too soon.  The director threatened Emily with a lawsuit, and the security man threw her out.\n\n\nIn the courtroom, Meg spoke, and then Paul stood and said that while he was happy that Meg was making such good progress, the hearing was really about the welfare of their daughter, Eliza.  He explained that he and Emily had custody of the girl because a previous court had thought they could provide Eliza with a better living environment.  He said nothing about the environment had changed since then, and theirs was still the best place for his daughter.  The judge decided that nothing would change for the next 30 days, and the court would reevaluate the situation at that time.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Meg thanked Paul for being so civil to her, and as she began to walk away, Emily ran in.  She was disappointed that the hearing was over, and Paul went into the courtroom to get his coat.  Emily turned to Meg and said, \"It was you who called the paper to get me out of the hearing.\"  Meg denied that, but Emily knew better, and she was furious at Meg's expression of pleasure.\n\n\nAlone at Carly's house, Liberty phoned Gabriel, but she got only his voicemail.  She left him a message asking him to call.  At Memorial, Carly had Parker sequestered in a room in order to get some answers from him.  She questioned him about his behavior at the scene of the fire and also about his breaking into Gabriel's hotel room.  Carly couldn't understand why Parker had such a problem with Gabriel unless he was jealous of the boy's attentions to Liberty.  Parker would only say that he didn't trust Gabriel, and then he realized that Liberty probably had not yet heard about the fire.  Carly suggested that someone other than Parker should tell the girl, but Parker insisted that he had to be the one.\n\n\nParker went home and found Liberty on the couch.  She assumed that he wanted to apologize for breaking into Gabriel's room, and she scolded him for his attitude towards her new friend.  When Parker could get in a word, he told Liberty that something had happened.\n\n\nIn Gabriel's room, a doctor and nurse monitored his condition, and Carly walked in.  She introduced herself as \"one of Gabriel's employers,\" and she asked about him.  The nurse asked her if she knew the boy's next of kin, but Carly had no clue.  Carly went out into the hall, and Parker and Liberty ran up.  Carly reported that Gabriel was still unconscious, and Parker explained about the fire.  \n\n\nLiberty went into her friend's room and then asked why he was alone.  She went to his bedside and spoke to Gabriel, and then she began asking questions.  She wanted to know how the boy had hit his head, and Parker was quick to say it was probably an accident.  Carly noticed how exhausted Liberty appeared, and she wanted to take the girl home, but Liberty said Gabriel had no one else but her, and she would stay.  Carly and Parker went home.\n\n\nCarly asked Parker to tell her what was bothering him, but he denied that anything was.  Carly knew her boy, and she kept at him until he admitted it was about Gabriel.  He sadly said that if Gabriel died, it would be Parker's fault because he had hit him.  Parker said the boy fell and didn't get back up, so he assumed he had hit his head.  Carly was horrified that Parker had run out, but her son said he had been totally freaked out.  She asked why the boys had been arguing, and Parker said his mother didn't want to know.  Carly insisted, so Parker admitted it had been about Craig, and he unloaded about his missing trust fund.  Carly wondered why Craig would steal Parker's money when he had so much of his own, but Parker didn't know.  He said he only knew that the bank had confirmed that it was gone.\n\n\nParker said that Gabriel had figured it all out and had blackmailed Craig into paying him off.  Parker asked if they should call the police, but Carly was fearful that the police would think that her son had set the fire.  Carly asked who else knew the truth, and Parker said only Gabriel, and perhaps Faith.  Liberty walked in then and said that there had been no change in Gabriel's condition.  Carly picked up her purse and coat and, as she left, reminded Parker not to say a word.  Parker and Liberty talked, and the girl began to cry.  She felt that Gabriel had never caught a break his whole life, and on top of it all, he was in critical condition.\n\n\nWhen Lily dropped the bomb on Craig that he was Gabriel Carras' father, he told her she was out of her mind.  He then declared, \"That punk is not my son.\"  Lliy assured him it was true, and she handed him Gabriel's birth certificate from Montega.  Craig was stunned and refused to believe that it was authentic, and he told Lily that Gabriel was sneaky and conniving.  He was sure that the boy was scamming him, because Gabriel had also claimed that he lived in Miami and had known Bryant.  Lily was confused, and she explained that she knew that Gabriel had been in Montega for Lydia's funeral a few months earlier.\n\n\nLily also said that Sierra had known about Gabriel from the time he was born, and she had suspected that Craig and Lydia were having an affair.  Eventually Lydia admitted it to Sierra, but Craig was floored that his ex-wife had always known.  Then he looked hard at Lily and asked how long she had known, and when she stalled, he shouted, \"How long?\"  Gabriel's nurse opened the door then and asked for quiet for her patient, so Craig took Lily's arm and hustled her to an empty room.\n\n\nCraig repeated his question to Lily, who replied that she had heard about the boy also at his birth.  She said that when Lucinda found out about Lydia, - but Craig stopped her by yelling, \"Your mother!  Why am I not surprised?\"  Craig asked if Lucinda had pulled out her checkbook and paid off \"the poor, pitiful maid.\"  He shouted that Lucinda had kept knowledge of his son from him, and Lily had helped keep the secret.  \n\n\nHe asked how they could dare to assume that he would not care about the child.  Lily shouted back that it was Lydia who had insisted that Craig not know.  After all, Lily reminded him, it was not the first time a woman had refused to let Craig be a part of a child's life.  Craig flushed and was obviously furious, as Lily said that Lydia had not wanted people to know she had slept with a married man.\n\n\nCraig digested as much as he could of the situation, and then he told Lily that Gabriel hated him, too, but he didn't care.  Lily cried that the boy needed him, but Craig repeated that he did not care.  He announced that the kid had taken all that he was going to get from Craig.  Craig warned Lily never to tell Gabriel any of the story, and he declared the boy to be her problem.  He warned her to \"stay the hell away\" from him, and he walked out.\n\n\nLily went home and was looking at Gabriel's baby photo and the more recent picture when Holden walked in.  He asked about the photos, but Lily said she was sorry, but she couldn't tell him.  She began to cry, and Holden pushed her to tell him the reason.  Finally Lily said she was fearful that she had made a terrible mistake.\n\n\nCraig went the Lakeview bar and began drinking.  He flashed back on his last argument with Gabriel, and then he got up and left.  He returned to the hospital and watched through the window as Gabriel lay unconscious.  \"Why didn't you tell me?\" he kept repeating.  \"Why didn't you tell me you were my son?\"  Craig finally walked into the room and said that he knew Gabriel never wanted the money; it was all about revenge on the father who had abandoned him.  Craig began to weep, saying that he hadn't known who Gabriel was, nor had he realized the boy was in the building when he started the fire.  Unknown to Craig, Carly watched him through the window.\n\n\n",
