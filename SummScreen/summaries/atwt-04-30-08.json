Paul immediately pushed Sofie off of him and ran after Meg. \n\n\nAfter seeing Paul and Sofie together, Meg returned to Mike's room at the Lakeview and told Mike what she saw at Fairwinds. As Mike comforted Meg, Paul knocked at the door and demanded that Meg let him in and forgive him. Mike told Paul to go away, but Paul continued to scream and bang at the door. While Mike called security, Paul claimed that Sofie meant nothing to him and he only turned to Sofie because Meg shut him out. Meg told Paul she wouldn't open the door and when Mike told Paul to stop, Paul became enraged and threatened to break down the door. Security arrived and asked Paul to leave, but he refused and the security guard was forced to remove Paul forcefully. When the noise from the hallway stopped, Mike checked and told Meg that Paul was gone. Mike encouraged Meg to get a restraining order and she agreed it might be the best way to keep Paul away from her. \n\n\nChris and Alison met up in the hospital corridor and Chris asked if Alison was feeling better after her bout of the stomach flu. Alison said she was back to normal and offered to take Chris to dinner in appreciation for his taking such good care of her when she was sick. Chris accepted and the two agreed to meet after their shifts were over. Kim came to pick Chris and Bob up for dinner, but Chris explained he was having dinner with Alison. Kim was concerned about Chris getting involved with Alison again and she was worried that Chris was exchanging one lost Stewart sister for another. Chris convinced his mother that he was old enough to date whomever he wanted and Kim relented. She invited Alison to join them for dinner. \n\n\nChris found Alison after his shift and invited her to go to dinner at the Lakeview with his parents. Alison quickly shot down the idea and claimed that they weren't dating seriously enough to be dining with parents, but trying to renew their friendship. Chris told Alison that it was his mother's idea to invite her and this bit of information was enough to change Alison's mind; she agreed to join him for dinner with his parents. \n\n\nAt the office of The Intruder, Casey brought in paperwork for Emily and she congratulated him on getting through his first day of work since the hostage standoff. As they spoke, Margo phoned Casey and told him that Matt was at the station and wanted to say goodbye before he was shipped off to prison. Casey told Margo that he had no interest in talking to Matt. Emily overheard Casey's conversation and once he was off the phone, she tried to convince him that he should visit Matt. Emily explained to Casey that he needed to see Matt to get closure with him. Casey agreed to go, but Emily asked him to get her some additional paperwork before he left. When Casey went to get the reports, Emily decided to put a tape recorder in Casey's jacket pocket so she could record his conversation with Matt. \n\n\nCasey arrived at the police station and Margo was relieved that he had decided to see Matt. Margo directed Casey to the interrogation room, where he found Matt waiting for transportation to take him to prison. Matt was pleased to see Casey and immediately began to apologize for putting Casey's family in danger. Matt tried to explain why he worked with Gerald Nevins, but Casey told Matt he knew everything he needed to know about the guy Matt worked for. Casey told Matt to take care of himself in prison, just as Margo and the guard came in to take Matt away. As Casey talked to Margo about Matt, he found the tape recorder Emily had placed in his pocket. Casey was shocked that Emily had bugged him and wondered why she would do such a thing. Margo told him he would have the opportunity to ask and pointed to Emily, who had just arrived at the station. \n\n\nCasey confronted Emily and asked her why she was there. Emily explained that Paul had called and asked her to meet him at the police station right away. Their conversation was interrupted when Paul was brought in wearing handcuffs. The arresting officer told Margo that Paul was under arrest for disturbing the peace, assaulting a security guard, and resisting arrest. Paul asked to be booked quickly so Emily could bail him out. Emily told Paul he was on his own this time and Paul was taken away for his mug shot. \n\n\nEmily turned her attention back to Casey and asked him how his conversation with Matt went. Casey handed her the recorder and told her to listen for herself. Casey stormed out and Emily chased after him and tried to explain why she bugged him, but Casey was angry and refused to listen to her excuses. Emily finally apologized to Casey and he agreed to stay on as her assistant. Emily offered to take Casey to dinner as a peace offering. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Kim and Bob complemented Alison on everything from her outfit to her starting nursing school, but the mood quickly went from good to bad when Kim accidentally insulted Alison's mother. Kim offered a less than heartfelt apology, but then continued the disastrous conversation by asking why Chris and Alison kept trying to date when it had always ended in heartache. Alison insisted that she and Chris were just friends and Kim complemented them on being able to keep a strong friendship after their tumultuous past. Alison excused herself and went to the lobby where she found Emily and Casey. Each of the Stewart sisters wondered why the other was there, but when Emily discovered Alison was with Chris, she and Casey decided to leave the Lakeview. \n\n\nIn the lobby, Alison explained to Chris that his mother might be right about their past. Chris tried to convince Alison that they could make a relationship work this time regardless of what the people around them thought. Alison agreed to return to dinner and to consider dating Chris again. Kim apologized again and Bob offered a toast to new beginnings. Suddenly, Alison heard the man behind her choking and rushed to help him. She saved the man by giving him the Heimlich maneuver and everyone was impressed by her quick action. After dinner, Chris and Alison decided to share a nightcap in his room. \n\n\nOnce they were in his room, Alison realized that Chris once lived in the hotel with Emily and was uncomfortable being there with him. Chris explained that it wasn't the same room, but Alison told him it wasn't just the room that was making her uncomfortable, but the fear they were making another mistake. Alison decided it was best to go and she left. \n\n\nCasey found Emily drinking at Yo's and told her she owed him dinner. Emily passed him a bowl of nuts and told him to dig in. Emily told Casey that no one wanted them hanging out together and he should go home to his mommy. Casey wouldn't let Emily back out of buying him dinner and convinced her to play against him in a game of pool, with the bet being the dinner Emily owed him. Casey ran the table and insisted Emily pay up. Emily and Casey returned to The Intruder offices with some takeout and enjoyed the quiet. Casey told Emily that they needed to be honest with one another and stop hiding from the world. \n\n\nBack at the police station, Margo told Paul he would be in jail overnight and Paul demanded to make another call. He phoned Sofie and asked her to come and bail him out. Moments later, Mike arrived with Meg to help her get a restraining order against Paul. Margo explained that Meg needed to go before a judge, but Margo believed Paul would be in jail until she could get it taken care of. Sofie arrived at police headquarters and said she was there to bail Paul out. Paul was brought in to the room by an officer and begged Meg to listen to him. He tried to explain that kissing Sofie was a mistake and he would never have done it if Meg hadn't turned him away. When Paul tried to walk towards Meg, Mike told him to back off, but Paul refused and Mike finally punched him. The police separated the two and Margo offered to find a judge to issue a restraining order against Paul. Mike took Meg home as Paul waited for Sofie to post his bail. Once the paperwork was done, Paul thanked Sofie for coming down, but she rushed out after learning that he thought kissing her was a mistake. \n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds and immediately saw that Sofie had followed him home. Paul was surprised to see Sofie and she asked him if he really thought being with her was a mistake. Paul told Sofie she was sweet, but what happened between them was wrong. Sofie refused to believe Paul, and said that since he knew Meg was not coming back he should give Sofie a chance. Sofie declared her love for Paul and told him she accepted who he was and would do anything for him. Paul kissed Sofie and the two began to take each other's clothes off on the couch. \n\n\nMike took Meg back to the farm and she thanked him for helping her deal with Paul. Mike hugged Meg and counseled her on how to handle Paul. Meg was grateful for all Mike had done and said that this time she knew things were over with Paul. Mike offered to keep Paul away from Meg during the farm's development project and told Meg that in time she would be able to move on. \n\n\n",
