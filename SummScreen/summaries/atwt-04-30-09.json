He invited Luke to lunch at the Lakeview, and he also graciously offered to include Holden and Lily. Luke called Lily, but she didn't get to her phone in time, so he left her a message. \n\n\nLucinda waited for Emily in the office of the Intruder. When Emily arrived, Lucinda proclaimed they needed some \"face time.\" Emily thought she was in trouble because of slumping sales for the newspaper, so she started coming up with creative ideas to increase circulation. Lucinda then dropped the bomb: she would no longer be publishing the Intruder. Emily protested mightily about losing the paper, but Lucinda said she had made a shrewd business decision. \n\n\nFinally, Lucinda said that she would not be publishing the paper anymore, but not because it was going out of business. It was because it was going digital. Lucinda's idea was to have news online 24/7, and she needed an editor. She asked if Emily would like her old job back with the digital version, but to Lucinda's surprise, Emily declined. \n\n\nDamian left Memorial to go ahead to the Lakeview, and Luke saw Alison and went over to thank her for her help in attempting to find the kidnappers. Luke took off, and Alison continued her work. Casey and Jade walked in, and Casey spotted Alison, so he invited her to lunch. Alison accepted and suggested that they also invite Jade. Casey was surprised, but he agreed, and Jade accepted immediately. \n\n\nLily listened to Luke's message about lunch with Damian, and she was willing to accept. Holden was another matter, however. He refused to socialize with Lily's ex, and he was in no mood to be gracious. Lily threatened to go by herself because she thought it was important for Luke, but Holden warned her that something bad always happened around Damian. Lily refused to listen and started out, and Holden decided to accompany her. \n\n\nAt Yo's, Casey ordered food at the bar for the lunch threesome, so while they were alone, Jade asked Alison why she had invited her. Alison said she was just trying to be nice, and Jade accused her of trying to get on Jade's good side. The girls had a good laugh about Casey until he returned. \n\n\nLuke and Damian waited at the Lakeview to see if Luke's parents would arrive. Luke felt awkward making small talk with his estranged father, but just then, Lily and Holden walked in. Lily mentioned that they could not pass up a final opportunity to thank Damian for his help in rescuing the boys, but Damian broke the news that he was settling in Oakdale for the present time. Holden demanded to know what he meant, so Damian said he was staying in town to get to know his son better. Holden declared that Luke was Holden's son, and he did not want his son anywhere near Damian. \n\n\nDamian explained that his staying had been Luke's idea, but Holden was too shocked to consider that might be true, and he stood up and walked out. Luke went after him, as Damian apologized to Lily for causing trouble. Lily was quick to point out that trouble was something that Damian always caused. \n\n\nLuke and Holden talked in the lobby, and Luke attempted to smooth Holden's ruffled feathers. Luke said he had just realized that he knew very little about his birth father. He was thinking that Damian was not as bad as they thought he was. Holden agreed that he would not stop Luke from having contact with Damian, but he urged the boy to be very cautious. The two of them hugged and went back inside. \n\n\nLucinda was confused as to why Emily had turned down the offer to edit the digital edition of the Intruder. Emily finally admitted that she was a cyber-dummy, and besides her editing, she had no other skills to bring to the cyber world. Lucinda told her she could learn, and besides, Emily would have help. She said she had promoted a young man from the IT department to be Emily's co-editor. Emily threw a fit at having to share her title, but Lucinda took her by the arm and led her outside the office. Sitting there was Hunter. \n\n\nHunter was an attractive man who used only the one name, and he was writing on his laptop. He promptly dumped the computer on the floor when he stood up to meet Emily. She asked if he was always so clumsy, and he intimated that he was. He told her that speed was the key to their success, and his first suggestion was to change the name from Intruder to something more cyber sounding. Emily disagreed, and declared that Alice had, indeed, gone through the looking glass. Lucinda departed, and Emily announced she was going to find somewhere to drink her lunch. An eager Hunter followed. \n\n\nAt Yo's, Casey wanted to know what was going on, and Jade said she and Alison had come to an understanding. Then Jade noticed an attractive young man drinking at the bar, and she became distracted. Alison urged Jade to go ask the man to play pool with her, so Jade took the plunge, and the guy agreed. The pool game progressed, until Alison noticed that the man was wearing a wedding ring. Casey walked up and asked if he hadn't seen the man in Yo's the week before with his wife, and suddenly the stranger had to leave. Jade was in a foul mood, but soon the two girls challenged Casey to a game. \n\n\nDamian told Lily that he was staying in Oakdale to spend time with Luke. Lily outlined all the troubles that Luke had suffered through recently, including his expulsion from college, depression, and the drinking that jeopardized his health. Damian felt some responsibility for some of those troubles. \n\n\nLily scolded him for making a rash decision to stay in Oakdale without any consideration as to how that would affect her entire family. Damian asked Lily to tell him what to do, but Lily said that was not fair. Luke and Holden returned to the table, but Holden still refused to break bread with Damian, and he walked out, followed by Lily. \n\n\nLuke talked with the bank, and he learned that the transfer of funds from the foundation's account to the one the kidnappers had set up had gone through. He found out that he would get the money back, but it would be a slow and involved process. Luke was worried that without available funds, the foundation would have to stop most of their programs that relied on ready cash, such as the meals for elderly shut-ins. \n\n\nDamian asked if he could help, but Luke did not know how to respond. Luke finally said that Damian might not approve of all the programs the foundation supported, but his father said that he trusted Lily and Luke and the decisions they had made. Luke accepted Damian's offer of temporary financial help. \n\n\nEmily and Hunter entered Yo's, and Emily immediately ordered a dry martini, while Hunter inquired about the availability of carrot juice. He began a tirade of cyber-babble that was way over Emily's head, so she made fun of him. Hunter never slowed down, and he referred to Emily as being from \"an older generation.\" That infuriated Emily, so Hunter changed his phrase to \"an older person.\" \n\n\nHe finally realized that he was making things worse, so he got up to leave and stubbed his toe on the bar stool. He ended up almost on top of Emily, and just at that moment, Alison looked over and recognized her sister. She made a remark that it looked as if Emily was robbing the cradle again. \n\n\nAlison tried to figure out why Emily had walked out, but her young friend had stayed in the bar. She went outside to speak with her sister, and she asked about Emily's \"new boy toy.\" Emily blew up and yelled that Lucinda had ruined her day by putting the Intruder totally online and had also hired the \"boy toy\" as Emily's new business partner. \n\n\nAt Lily's house, Lucinda showed up and had a cup of tea. She said she was tired of being treated like the Grim Reaper. Holden passed on the news that Damian was staying in Oakdale so that he and Luke could get to know one another. Luke walked in, full of smiles. He told them that the doctor was going to release Noah very soon, and that Damian was going to fund all the foundation's projects until the bank could replace the stolen money. Lily offered to do that instead, but Luke said he wanted Damian to do it. \n\n\nAlison went back inside Yo's and introduced herself to Hunter. She offered him some tips on how to handle temperamental Emily, and Hunter was grateful. Primarily, Alison suggested he never argue with her sister, and never to correct her, because Emily liked to think she was always right. Alison invited Hunter to hang out with her and her friends, and Hunter agreed. He pulled up a chair right next to Jade and promptly knocked her soda directly into her lap. He was so embarrassed that he got up and ran out, as Jade fumed, and Alison and Casey cracked up laughing. \n\n\nAfter Lucinda and Luke left, Holden told Lily that he thought it would be best if she resigned as head of the foundation. Lily was angry and told Holden that he was being unreasonable. He said that Damian wanted his family back, and that included Lily. He asked her to back away from the foundation, but when Lily hesitated, he stormed out saying that he had his answer. \n\n\nHunter returned to the Intruder office and told Emily that he had met her sister. He said he had changed his mind about renaming the online paper; she had been right about reader loyalty and brand recognition. He asked if he could return the next day, and Emily agreed. \n\n\nLucinda knocked on Damian's hotel room door, and when he opened it, she charged in. She blasted him for staying in Oakdale and for getting involved in Luke's business. She complained that Lily and Holden would be affected by whatever Damian did in Oakdale, and if he had any thoughts of inserting himself into that family, she would not allow it. Damian answered that, with all due respect to Lucinda, she was no longer his mother-in-law, and he did not need to listen to any more of her lectures. He opened the door and showed her out.\n\n\n",
