Because Lily had promised Craig that she wouldn't say anything about Gabriel, she told Holden that she couldn't tell him, but did say that she'd made a bad decision years before that had caused several people a lot of pain. Holden gently encouraged Lily to confide in him, but Lucinda walked in before Lily could do more than shake her head, and Lucinda, quickly sizing up the situation, told Lily, \"Don't!\"\n\n\nLucinda told Lily that they didn't need to \"wallow in unhappy memories,\" and Holden asked what made Lucinda think that he and Lily had been discussing unhappy memories. Lucinda walked up to Lily and told her it wouldn't help to rehash the past. Holden wondered why Lucinda thought Lily was upset, but Lucinda replied that she could tell by looking at Lily that something was bothering her. Holden explained that it was between him and Lily, and he asked Lucinda to stay out of it.\n\n\nLucinda turned and told Holden that she wouldn't stay out of it, and she reminded Holden of how much he had put Lily through. Lily stopped Lucinda and said that they both knew Holden hadn't done anything wrong. Holden suggested that Lucinda leave, but Lucinda said she'd just gotten there. Lily told Holden that she would talk to him later. After he made sure Lily would be okay, Holden left.\n\n\nLucinda cautioned Lily not to tell Holden that Gabriel was Craig's son, because Holden wouldn't be able to lie about it, and Craig would find out. Lily told Lucinda that Craig already knew. Lucinda was stunned to learn that Lily had told Craig about Gabriel, but Lily said that when she had encountered Craig at the hospital, she had felt that she had to tell the truth. Lucinda pointed out that Gabriel's mother, Lydia, hadn't wanted Craig to know he was the boy's father, but Lily said that with Lydia dead and Gabriel in critical condition, she believed the right thing to do was to let Craig know that he was Gabriel's father.\n\n\nLily thought that Gabriel already knew that Craig was his father, because Gabriel had taken up residence in Oakdale and had gone to work for Craig. Lily believed that if Gabriel did regain consciousness, he had the right to know that Craig hadn't abandoned him before he was even born. Lucinda said that Gabriel was better off without Craig in his life, but Lily said it wasn't up to them to decide that. Lucinda said she was certain that Craig would want to mold Gabriel into a \"puppet of his will, the way he was trying to do with poor Bryant,\" and she turned to leave. When Lily asked where her mother was going, Lucinda replied, \"I'm going to deal with this!\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, Craig sat by Gabriel's bed and told the unconscious boy that he would pull through because he was strong, resilient, and a survivor, just like Craig. Carly approached the room and stood outside, remembering her conversation with Parker, when Parker had told her that Craig had been stealing money from his trust fund and that Gabriel had found out and had been blackmailing Craig. Craig turned his head and saw Carly standing outside the room.\n\n\nJanet and Jack arrived back in Milltown. Janet thanked Jack again for having accompanied her to Melrose Park for her father's funeral. She commented about her dysfunctional family, but Jack nodded toward Carly's house and reminded Janet that he was used to difficult family situations. He assured Janet that no matter what, she and her baby would always be a part of his life.\n\n\nAs Carly was about to enter Gabriel's hospital room, her cell phone rang. It was Parker, who told her that Jack and Janet were back. were standing on the porch, and were about to enter the house. Parker asked what he should tell Jack; Carly admonished Parker not to tell Jack anything at all about what had happened. Parker said he didn't want to lie, but Carly said she wasn't asking him to lie; she simply didn't want Parker to volunteer any information. She suggested that Parker stay in his room, to avoid conversation with Jack and Janet, and she told him she would be home shortly.\n\n\nCarly hung up and turned to leave, but Craig walked out of Gabriel's room and asked if Carly wanted to see Gabriel. Carly said that something else had come up, and she told Craig she would deal with him later. Craig asked why Carly seemed angry, and whether he'd done something. Carly replied, \"You're damn right you did, and you're just lucky I don't have time to deal with you right now.\"\n\n\nCraig went back into the room to sit by Gabriel. Margo walked in and was surprised to see Craig wiping away tears. When Margo remarked about it, Craig said he felt responsible for Gabriel's condition, since the fire had started in his office. Margo said that Craig had appeared very emotional, and Craig retorted that he had \"actual feelings,\" then said, \"I don't need this right now\" and tried to leave the room. Margo stopped him and asked, \"What is really going on?\"\n\n\nMargo apologized for having criticized Craig's feelings, but she said she'd been surprised because Craig had previously told her that he didn't care about Gabriel at all. Craig said that Gabriel seemed to be alone in the world, and Margo asked whether Craig had tried to track down Gabriel's family. Craig said any paperwork the company had on Gabriel had been destroyed in the fire.\n\n\nMargo asked whether Gabriel had any friends in Oakdale, and Craig asked if Margo had turned their conversation into an interrogation. Margo said she was trying to find out why Gabriel hadn't gotten out of the building, and she asked whether Craig had seen Gabriel arguing with anyone. Craig asked if Margo thought someone had intentionally hurt Gabriel, but Margo said she was just asking a few questions.\n\n\nMargo then asked if Craig had any idea how the fire had started, but Craig pointed out that the police had experts to answer questions like that. He said he didn't have anything else he could tell Margo, but she asked him to call her if he thought of anything.\n\n\nAt home, Jack greeted Parker, who hadn't made his escape quickly enough. Parker welcomed Jack and Janet back and told Janet he was sorry about her father's death. Jack asked what had been happening at home, but Parker said, \"Just the usual,\" and then said he had homework to do. Liberty went downstairs and hugged her mom. When Janet asked her what was wrong, Liberty told Janet about the fire in Carly's building and said that Gabriel had been in the building and was hospitalized because of the fire.\n\n\nJack asked Parker if Carly was okay, and Parker told him that Carly hadn't been in the building when the fire started. Carly arrived and told Jack she was glad he was back. She hugged him and asked whether he'd heard about the fire. He said yes, and he told Carly he would call Margo to find out what she knew about it, but Carly asked him not to do that yet. She told Jack that the kids had missed him, and she asked him to let Margo handle things for a while so that he could spend some time with his family. Jack agreed.\n\n\nCarly filled Jack in on the few details she knew about the fire, and she said that Gabriel had apparently fallen and hit his head at some point. Jack pointed out that the police would find out what had happened whenever Gabriel regained consciousness, but Liberty was worried that might not happen. Janet assured Liberty that Gabriel would pull through, because he was young and strong.\n\n\nJack asked Carly what had happened to her business, and she told him that virtually everything had been destroyed. Jack asked if there was insurance, so that the business could be rebuilt, but Carly said she wasn't thinking about that yet. Jack agreed that it wasn't the time to worry about that. Liberty was concerned that Gabriel was alone, and she told them that Gabriel had said that both of his parents were dead and that he had no other family.\n\n\nJanet asked Liberty if she would help with the unpacking, so the two of them went upstairs. Carly asked Jack how the funeral had been, and he told her, \"Rough.\" Jack remarked that it appeared that Carly and Parker had also had a tough time while he'd been gone, and he said he wished he could have been there for them, too. Carly assured Jack that she and Parker were fine, and Parker agreed.\n\n\nUpstairs, Liberty filled Janet in on the tension between Parker and Gabriel. Janet wondered how Gabriel could have afforded to charter a plane to take him to Melrose Park, and Liberty said that Parker had wondered the same thing. Liberty said it didn't matter to her, but Janet said it sounded like it had mattered to Parker. Liberty agreed and told Janet that Parker and Gabriel had gotten into a big fight. When Janet asked if the fight had been about money, Liberty said the fight was about her.\n\n\nLiberty told Janet that Parker had been out of control with his anger about Gabriel, and she explained that she and Gabriel had caught Parker searching through Gabriel's things in the hotel room where Gabriel had been staying. When Janet asked why Parker had done that, Liberty said it was because Parker thought Gabriel was hiding something from Liberty. Liberty told Janet that she wanted to be friends with both Parker and Gabriel, but Parker wasn't making that easy.\n\n\nDownstairs, Jack told Carly that he knew the loss of her business must be hard on her. Carly said she was only concerned about Gabriel for the time being, so Jack reminded her that she hadn't caused the fire. Jack then said that they should try to focus on their own lives and family, and he suggested that they get Sage and take a walk together. Carly immediately said they couldn't do that. When Jack asked why, Carly told him that Parker needed to work on a paper for school. Parker agreed, and Carly said she would take him to the library to finish the paper.\n\n\nParker went upstairs to get his things, and Jack asked Carly what was really going on. Carly said she and Parker were just worried about the fire, and Jack asked why she seemed to be pushing him away when he was just trying to help.\n\n\nWhen Parker returned with his things, Jack suggested that when Parker had finished his homework, he could visit Gabriel at the hospital. Janet walked into the room, however, and said she didn't think Parker should be anywhere near the hospital when Gabriel woke up. Carly replied that just because Parker and Gabriel had some disagreements didn't mean that Parker had wanted Gabriel to get hurt. Jack asked if things were really that bad between the two boys, and Carly said of course not. She then accused Janet of trying to make things seem worse than they were and of trying to cause trouble.\n\n\nJanet protested that she wasn't trying to do that, but Carly said what mattered was Gabriel's recovery. Janet agreed but said she was also trying to look out for Parker. Carly said that she and Jack could look out for their own son. Janet apologized for having interrupted them, and she went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for Liberty.\n\n\nJack asked Carly not to take things out on Janet, but Carly said she resented Janet's implication that Parker didn't care about Gabriel just because they'd had some disagreements. Parker said his mom was right, regardless of what had happened between him and Gabriel. Carly interrupted before Parker could say anything else, and she told him that they needed to head for the library.\n\n\nAfter Carly and Parker left, Jack went into the kitchen and asked Janet why she had said Parker shouldn't visit Gabriel. Janet told him what Liberty had said about Parker breaking into Gabriel's room. Jack wondered why Parker would do that, and Janet thought perhaps Parker was jealous of Gabriel. Janet apologized for having brought it up in front of Carly. Jack said he realized it was hard for Janet and Liberty to stay at Carly's, and Janet agreed and said they needed to get a place of their own as soon as possible. Jack promised to work on that, and Janet thanked him and hugged him.\n\n\nJanet took a tray of food upstairs to Liberty, but Liberty said she wasn't hungry. Janet was concerned and insisted that Liberty eat something. Liberty ate a few bites to appease her mom. Janet said that she didn't feel like she'd been doing her job as a mom very well lately. Liberty told Janet that she understood how much Janet had been dealing with, but Janet promised Liberty that things would get better. Janet said the first thing they needed to do was get their own place to live. Liberty asked whether they would move into the house that Dusty had bought, but Janet said it would be better if they found their own place, where they could be completely independent.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Parker asked Carly why they couldn't just tell Jack what had happened, since Parker hadn't intended for Gabriel to get hurt. Carly reminded Parker that Parker had left Gabriel in the building unconscious. She said that Parker's story, although true, wouldn't sound good to the police, and Carly wanted to protect not only Parker but also Jack, because Jack would try to exonerate Parker.\n\n\nCarly thought they should wait and see what the police learned about the case. Parker reminded his mother that they had both gotten in trouble in the past for lying to Jack, but Carly insisted it was their only choice. Parker said, \"Maybe it is, but I don't think I can do it,\" and he walked away.\n\n\nCarly followed Parker. Parker asked what Carly thought would happen when Jack found out they hadn't confided in him. Carly replied that she would make sure Jack understood it had been her decision. She then said it was possible that the police would conclude Gabriel's head injury was an accident, in which case there would be nothing for them to tell the police. Carly suggested that Parker get his books from the library and return home to study. He asked where she was going, but she simply said she had something to do.\n\n\nMargo went to Carly's house and told Jack she was glad he was back in town. She then said that the police weren't sure yet whether the fire at Monte Carlo had been an accident or arson, and she wanted to assign Jack to the case. Jack said arson was the responsibility of the fire department, and Margo agreed, provided it was just a fire. Parker appeared in the doorway and stopped to listen to the conversation, unseen by either Jack or Margo. He heard Margo tell Jack that it looked like someone had knocked Gabriel out and then set the building on fire, and that she needed Jack to find out who it was.\n\n\nLucinda waited for Craig to return to his suite at the Lakeview. Craig was unhappy to see Lucinda and told her that he didn't want to talk to her. Lucinda barged into Craig's room, anyway, and tried to explain to Craig what a difficult situation she and Lily had found themselves in years earlier when they had learned about Gabriel's existence. Lucinda said that Gabriel was a stranger to Craig and apparently had wanted to remain that way, so she suggested that Craig simply walk away.\n\n\nCraig tried to move past Lucinda, but she told him, \"I mean it.\" Craig became consumed with anger and grasped Lucinda around the throat; he snarled, \"If you don't shut your mouth, I swear to God I'll kill you!\" Lucinda gasped, \"Let go of me!\" and Craig did, but he told her that she deserved a lot more than that for what she'd done. Craig then said that Lucinda and her daughters were nothing but liars, and because of them, it might be too late for him to ever know his son. Craig told Lucinda, \"I swear to you, if I lose another one, you will lose everything you ever had. You understand me? Get out of my house!\"\n\n\nLucinda immediately went to the farm and showed Holden the marks on her throat. She told Holden that she shouldn't have stopped Lily from talking to him earlier, and she warned Holden that Lily and the kids were in real danger. When Holden asked, \"From whom?\" Lucinda replied, \"Craig.\"\n\n\nHolden then went to Lily's house and told her about his visit from Lucinda. Lily was upset when Holden told her about Craig's attack on her mother, but Holden assured Lily that Lucinda was okay. Holden said that Lucinda was worried that Craig might try to hurt Lily or the kids next, because Craig also blamed Lily for keeping the truth from him. Lily said she could understand why Craig was so upset, but Holden said nothing gave Craig the right to attack Lucinda that way. Holden told Lily that if Craig tried to hurt her or their kids, he would have to go through Holden first.\n\n\nCraig called the hospital to check on Gabriel's condition but was told there was no change. Craig poured himself a couple of stiff drinks. He then went to the burned-out offices of Monte Carlo, liquor bottle in hand, and finished the bottle while standing in the ruins of what was once his office. Craig hurled the empty liquor bottle against the wall, where it shattered. Carly walked up behind him and asked, \"What was that? Another accident?\"\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lily continues to feel guilty about keeping the truth from Craig and Gabriel and she wants to tell Holden but Lucinda stops her because she thinks it won't help to bring up the past. Carly is in protective mode as she tells Parker not to tell Jack that he was in the building and had a fight with Gabriel and left him unconscious before the fire started. Parker later discovers that Margo suspects that someone knocked Gabriel unconscious and started the fire to cover their tracks. Parker also discovers that Margo has put Jack in charge of the investigation. Liberty tells Janet about Parker breaking into Gabriel's room to search his things and she tells Janet that Parker and Gabriel were fighting over her. Janet later tells Jack and Jack can't believe that Parker would behave that way. Craig is very angry with himself for starting the fire but he is also angry with Lily and Lucinda for keeping the truth about Gabriel from him. Craig is so angry that he chokes Lucinda and throws her out of his room. A very scared Lucinda goes to the farm and tells Holden about Gabriel and asks him to protect Lily in case Craig comes after her and Holden vows to protect Lily from Craig.",
