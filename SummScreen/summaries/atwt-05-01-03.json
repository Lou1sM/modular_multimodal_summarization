Mike and Rosanna stop and look at Carly.  Mike asks if she is ok.  Carly tells Rosanna that she is crazy and she tells Mike to get Rosanna out of her office.  Mike tells Carly that if she starts to experience any trouble to call him or Jack.  Carly promises to do that and Mike and Rosanna leave.  Carly goes to the phone and dials *69 to try to get Craig back on the phone.  It doesn't work and Carly thinks that he must be out of the country.  Carly says, \"Where ever you are, you better come home soon before your wife does something really stupid.\"  Later, Carly is working and Molly shows up.  Carly is surprised to see her estranged cousin.  Molly tells Carly that she didn't know where to turn.  Carly can see that Molly is upset and gets her to sit down.  Molly fills Carly in on the trouble that she had run into with Dusty.  She tells Carly that there is someone following her now and she is scared.  Carly walks over and hugs her cousin.  The two start to talk about men.  As they are discussing the men that Molly has been involved with since Jake died, a man walks up to the door and listens to the women talk.  Finally, Carly tells Molly that she is going to call Jack and he will know what to do.  Molly thanks her cousin for her help.  The mysterious man walks away as Carly calls Jack.  Jack arranges for a police officer to escort Molly home.  While the two women wait for the police officer, Molly tells Carly that she almost didn't come into the office.  She reminds Carly that this is where is all began.  The whole mess.  Carly takes her cousins hand and tells her that there is nothing that they can't get through together.  The police officer walks in and Molly shows Carly that she isn't shaking any more.  Molly kisses her cousin good-bye and leaves with the officer.  \n\n\nWhen Molly gets back to The Lakeview, she asks the bartender if the creep that was asking about her earlier had been back.  The bartender says that he hasn't.  Molly orders a cup of very strong coffee.  As she waits for her coffee, a man sits down beside her.  She looks up and it is the man that was following her.  She starts to scream and he tells her to be quiet.  He opens his coat and shows her a gun.  He tells her that they have much to discuss.  \n\n\nChris Hughes visits Alison at the correctional facility.  He tries to reassure her to hang in and things will be getting better.  Alison tells him about being worried about the other girls.  She tells him that they go by and yell out death threats and slip notes under her door.  She says that if he keeps visiting her, maybe she can get through it all.  As they are talking, a guard brings Alison her lunch.  When Alison lifts the lid off her food, there is a piece of paper lying on top of the food.  Chris asks what is that and he picks up the paper and opens it and reads it.  Alison puts her tray down and asks what the note said.  Chris hands it to her.  Alison reads the note out loud, \"No mercy for squealers.  You're leaving here in a wooden box.\"  Alison picks up her tray of food and throws it across the room.  Chris tries to calm her down.  She yells that they want her dead.  Chris reminds her that the warden is going to try to help her.  Alison asks Chris to promise that he won't desert her.  Chris promises and they two hug.  It is time for Chris to leave and Alison tries to kiss him.  He turns his cheek to her.  They have made a new deal.  No kissing on the lips, only on the cheek.  Alison says, \"You can't blame a girl for trying.\"  Chris walks out in the hall and the warden closes and locks Alison's door.  Chris asks Hal how his visit went with the warden.  Hal tells him not to say anything, but Alison is getting the biggest break of her life.  He adds, \"She is going home.\"\n\n\nKim is surprised when she sees Bob at the hospital.  When she questions Bob, he doesn't understand why Kim is surprised that he is there.  Kim reminds him that he had an appointment to interview Dr. Rick Decker at The Lakeview.  Bob smacks his forehead and makes an excuse that he has been so busy he forgot.  Bob kisses his wife and says that he is going to The Lakeview to see if he can catch Dr. Decker.  After Bob leaves, Kim has a worried look on her face.  \n\n\nAt The Lakeview, Dr. Decker is sitting with Susan waiting for Bob.  Finally, Bob shows up and the two men go off to have their interview.  Emily shows up and sits with her mother.  Susan tells her daughter how excited she is about Rick wanting to move to Oakdale to be with her.  Emily tries to tell her mother about Alison, but Susan is too excited to hear about her daughter.  Emily asks her mother if she is thinking about Alison and Susan says that she is but she is just taking some time for herself.  Emily tells her mother that she is happy for her but they need to discuss Alison.  At that moment, Rick and Bob come back to the table.  Bob tells Susan that Rick has some news for her.  Rick announces that he has accepted a position in the geriatrics department at the hospital.  Susan is very happy and congratulates Rick.  Susan suggests that they order a bottle of champagne to celebrate and she invites Bob to stay and celebrate with them.  Bob says that he has to get home to his wife and leaves.  Emily leaves the table to call Hal.  When Susan and Rick are alone, Susan tells him again how happy she is that he will be in Oakdale.  Rick says that he has to find a place to live and Susan tells him that The Lakeview has some beautiful suites.  Rick tells her that The Lakeview is nice, but it is a hotel.  Susan, before she thinks, tells Rick that he could move into her house.  Rick looks at her and then says, \"Dr. Stewart, are you asking me to live with you?\"  Susan is shocked and takes back the offer.  The two are embarrassed.  Rick says that he has some calls to make and he needs to get back to his room.  He kisses Susan on the cheek and leaves.  Emily comes back to the table and Susan tells her daughter that she just made a very stupid mistake.  She tells Emily about inviting Rick to move into her house until he finds something of his own.  Susan adds that she thinks he took it the wrong way.  Emily asks if her mother is trying to drive the man away.  Emily tells her mother that she needs to go talk to Rick.  Susan agrees and leaves to track down Dr. Decker.  \n\n\nSusan finds Rick at his hotel room door.  She explains that she didn't mean to imply anything when she offered her home to him.  He tells her that he was about to take her up on her offer.  Susan is surprised.  Rick tells her that he insists on paying room and board and he will be a model tenant.  He says that he won't get involved in her family business.  Susan says that at the moment, there isn't much family business going on.  She tells him that even if they shave some time off of Alison's sentence, it will be a long time before she comes home.  Then Susan asks if they should draw up a contract or something.  Rick suggests that they seal the deal with a kiss.  He leans in and kisses Susan.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Rosanna walks in with Mike right behind her.  Rosanna tells Mike that he can go because she doesn't need a babysitter.  Mike sits her down and gets her to settle down.  He asks her if she has had anything to eat.  He answers for her by saying that he knows she didn't eat at the wedding reception and he is sure she didn't eat a few days before that so she would look fabulous in her dress.  Rosanna gets a smile on her face.  She tells him that he can always make her smile.  He tells her that he will get some food for them to eat and she can get a bottle of wine and they will meet back in the living room in ten.  After Mike walks out, Rosanna walks over to the desk and picks up some pictures of her and Craig at the wedding.  As she is looking at the pictures she says, \"I am not going to cry over you tonight.\"  She throws the pictures down on the desk and walks out of the living room.  Later, Mike walks in with a platter full of food and yells for Rosanna to hurry or he will eat the whole platter.  Rosanna walks back in wearing a short black lace nightie with a short robe hanging off her shoulders.  She says, \"You said you will always have a special place in your heart for me.  Did you mean it?\"  Mike, with his mouth hanging open, says, \"Rosanna...\"  Rosanna stops him and tells him that he doesn't need to turn her down.  She is going to stop this because she thought she could go through with it, but she can't.  She asks, \"Why can't I be more like Carly?  When ever she has a fight with Jack, she rips off her panties and jumps on you.\"  Mike asks if she is trying to get rid of the last friend that she has.  Rosanna hangs her head.  Mike tells her that Craig is an idiot and she should stop all this before things get worst.  Rosanna asks if things are going to get worst.  Mike smiles at her and says that things are only going to get better.  Mike says that he will get the wine for them.  After he leaves the room, the phone rings.  Rosanna rushes to the phone thinking that it is Craig calling.  She answers the phone and it is Craig.  Rosanna is happy to hear his voice.  He asks, \"How is my blushing bride?\"  As Rosanna and Craig talk, Mike walks back into the room talking about the wine that he picked out.  Rosanna turns to Mike and tries to get him to stop talking.  It is too late.  Craig hears Mike's voice.  Craig tells Rosanna that he is glad that she is not alone and miserable.  He says that he is sorry for interrupting and he was just calling to tell her that he will be back soon to take care of the mess that she made.  Craig hangs up on Rosanna.\n\n\n",
