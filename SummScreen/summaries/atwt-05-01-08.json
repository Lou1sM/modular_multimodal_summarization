Jack arrived in the middle of Sage's loud protestations and immediately questioned Carly's judgment. The adults continued the argument until Parker interrupted them with his sarcasm. Carly said she felt the children, especially Sage, needed to be kept busy and away from the tension between their parents. Jack promised to at least consider the camp. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Holden and Emma also discussed the merits of the summer camp. Emma expressed additional concern about Lily and Holden's marriage. Holden seemed nervous and jumpy about the road trip to the camp with Carly. He drove to pick up Carly and she attempted to back out of going, but Holden convinced her to stick to their plan. Carly asked Holden if he thought she was a good mother, and Holden told her it sounded as if she were doing all the right things for her children. \n\n\nLucinda had a phone conversation with Lily as she and Faith were having breakfast in a restaurant. Faith had spent the night with her grandmother and was supposed to be on her way to school. Faith told Lucinda she really missed Lily, and Lucinda spilled the news that actually Lily was coming home that very evening. \n\n\nBrad and Katie talked about Brad's discussion with Janet, Liberty's mother. Janet approved of Liberty's staying with Brad until the DNA results were in. Brad told Katie that if she wanted to back out of their marriage because of Brad's new \"baggage,\" that he would understand. Katie felt insulted and told him that she was not bailing out on her marriage. They discussed finding a school for Liberty, who refused to go. She suggested her \"rich\" father pay someone to home-school her. Katie offered the bribe of a shopping spree for new school clothes, and Liberty changed her mind. \n\n\nFaith and Lucinda went to the farm where Emma wanted to know why Faith was not in school. Lucinda explained that it was suddenly a special day since Lily was coming home that night and the girls wanted to plan a surprise welcome. Lucinda tried to caution Faith and Natalie that Lily might still not be quite herself. \n\n\nKatie took Liberty to Fashions and explained who the girl was to a curious Lisa. While Katie was paying for the shopping spree, Liberty shoplifted a bracelet that had caught her eye. Brad waited outside the shop and called Jack to come down and give him some advice on schools. As Katie and Liberty left Fashions, a store detective stopped Liberty and found the stolen bracelet. Lisa came outside and was willing to take the bracelet back and forget about the incident, but Brad insisted that Jack arrest the girl to teach her a lesson. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Department, Parker arrived looking for Jack. He was surprised to find the group from Fashions there and Liberty in the interrogation room. Brad gave her a hard time so Parker went in and convinced Liberty that jail was not where she wanted to be. Katie tried to get Brad to soften up so Brad offered to take Liberty home if she had learned her lesson. Liberty refused to go with him but also claimed she would not go back to her mother, either. Katie intervened again, and the stubborn dad and daughter apologized to each other. \n\n\nOn the road trip on the way back from camp, Holden and Carly had car trouble out in the middle of farm country. Holden called home but Emma did not spoil the surprise that Lily was coming home that night. Holden and Carly talked about the advantages the camp would offer their daughters, and Carly asked him how many different life changes he had been through since he had been with Lily. \n\n\nWhen Holden finally got home, he got the \"welcome\" greeting from his daughters who thought he was Lily. Lucinda called and gave the family the bad news: Lily had changed her mind and was not coming home. Holden had to explain this to his disappointed girls. \n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Liberty put on a fashion show of her new clothes for Brad and Katie. Katie approved of them and especially of the girl's good mood. \n\n\nCarly returned home to find Jack and the children waiting for her. Jack asked about the camp and agreed to send Sage there if Carly thought it would be beneficial to their daughter. Jack left, and a split screen showed a thoughtful Carly on her porch and a musing Holden at the farm. \n\n\n",
