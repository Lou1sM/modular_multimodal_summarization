    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Metro, Henry practiced how he would react when the doctor gave him, Vienna, Katie, and Brad the news that the baby Vienna was carrying wasn't Brad's baby. Vienna didn't care what reaction Henry had. Meanwhile, Katie and Brad talked about their upcoming appointment with the doctor about the genetic testing. Katie was still worried about it, but Brad assured her the results would show that the baby would be perfectly healthy. \n\n\nKatie's phone rang, and it was Margo, who told her that Craig had been arrested. Katie told Brad that she wanted to go to the police station to see Craig before she went to the hospital; Brad said he would go, too. \n\n\nCraig called Lucy to find out how Johnny was doing. Lucy said Johnny missed his dad, but she had told Johnny that Craig was on a business trip. Craig remarked how ironic it was that he was in jail for something he actually had not done. Lucy said she knew that he was innocent of the charges against him, which surprised Craig somewhat, but which also made him happy. Craig told Lucy that with her on his side, maybe they would convince the police to let him go. \n\n\nKatie and Brad arrived at the police station. When Craig told them what he'd been charged with, Katie wasn't sure whether she believed he was innocent. Craig was hurt by that and told her he wasn't a murderer. Brad remarked that Craig was just a near-murderer, since Paul Ryan hadn't died when Craig had tried to kill him. Craig said maybe Brad was the person who had set him up. Katie and Brad both became angry, and Brad told Craig to stay away from them in the future, because they didn't want any part of Craig's \"crooked little dealings.\" \n\n\nKatie and Brad went to the hospital and met up with Vienna and Henry. They found the doctor who said he was filling in for Vienna's regular doctor, and both Brad and Henry were amused by the doctor's name, Shmeglitz. After they had their laugh, the doctor told them that Brad and Vienna had conceived a perfectly healthy baby. Henry said, \"Oh, doctor, no, no, no! There must be some kind of mistake!\" and dramatically put his hand to his head. The others looked at him and asked what he was doing. \n\n\nHenry looked at the doctor and said, \"What did you say?\" The doctor repeated the good news about the baby's health, and Henry looked bewildered, as did the others. \n\n\nHenry questioned whether the doctor was positive the results were conclusive, but Brad said the doctor had been very clear, and he asked if Henry was trying to find something wrong. Brad and Katie wanted to celebrate the good news, but Vienna said she and Henry had to go back to Metro. \n\n\nAfter Brad and Katie left, Henry told Vienna he couldn't believe the news they had just gotten, because he had thought the testing would reveal that he was the father, not Brad, because of the ultrasound Vienna had. Vienna said the ultrasound technician must have been wrong. Henry told Vienna that the doctor appeared to be beckoning her, and she said maybe the doctor wanted to talk about his bill. Henry said they had insurance, and Vienna said she would figure out what was going on. \n\n\nHenry watched as Vienna handed the doctor some money. When they returned to Metro, Henry asked why she had given the doctor cash. Henry thought maybe Vienna had bribed the doctor to tell Brad and Katie that the genetic testing was normal. Vienna finally admitted she had hired a man who did a stand-up comedy act at Metro to pretend to be a doctor and give them the DNA test results. \n\n\nVienna asked why Henry was so upset that Brad and Katie hadn't found out the baby was actually Henry's child. Henry said he thought they should tell Brad and Katie the truth, but Vienna said if they did, Brad and Katie might change their minds about wanting to raise the baby. Henry said Brad and Katie wouldn't do that, but if they did, he wondered what he and Vienna would do. Vienna said they would have to raise \"Sven\" themselves. Henry said that Vienna was trying to twist things around to make him admit he wanted to raise their child. Vienna accused Henry of doing everything he could to avoid admitting the truth about how he felt. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went home, where Katie told Brad she thought Henry was becoming possessive of the baby and might end up wanting to keep the baby to raise himself. Brad assured Katie that Henry wouldn't want to raise another man's child, and he promised Katie everything would work out. \n\n\nDusty met with Tom at the Lakeview to fill him in on what had happened with Craig's arrest. Tom looked over the documents Dusty gave him and said that he could possibly have the custody order for Johnny reversed by the end of the day. Tom left, and Dusty ran into Lucy in the lobby and told her what was happening. Dusty was disappointed that Lucy wasn't excited about his chances of winning custody of Johnny. Lucy said she knew that if her father lost custody of Johnny and went to prison, it would be her fault. Dusty told Lucy that her father deserved what he was getting, even though he wasn't guilty of the particular crimes with which he was charged. \n\n\nLucy went to see Craig, and he told her his theory that Brad and Jack might have been trying to set him up. Lucy didn't think they would do that. Lucy then said that she had found out that Dusty was trying to get custody of Johnny. It suddenly dawned on Craig that Dusty might be the person who had set him up, in order to win custody of Johnny. \n\n\nLucy said that she didn't think Dusty would do something like that, but Craig said that Dusty had the connections to make it happen. Craig then told Lucy that she had to help him make sure that Dusty did not get custody of Johnny and take Johnny away from them. \n\n\nLucy said that she didn't want to be in the middle of a battle between Craig and Dusty over Johnny, and she reminded her father that that was exactly why she had taken Johnny and left town in the first place. Craig wanted to know if Lucy was thinking of going on the run with Johnny again, but Lucy said she couldn't do that to Johnny again. Lucy said Johnny needed a stable environment, and Craig said he had been giving that to Johnny. Lucy agreed, but said Craig couldn't do that while he was locked up. \n\n\nCraig said it sounded like Lucy would prefer it if Dusty won custody of Johnny. Craig asked whose side she was on, and Lucy replied that she was on Johnny's side. Craig said Lucy and Johnny meant everything to him, and that if he had done something wrong to deserve to be in jail, he wouldn't fight it, but he hadn't. When Lucy said she believed him, Craig said, \"Then don't let Dusty take what matters most to me in the world.\" Lucy said she would see what she could do, and Craig thanked her. \n\n\nWhen Lucy returned to the Lakeview, she ran into Dusty, who told her the judge had awarded him custody of Johnny. Lucy told him that her father thought that Dusty had set him up, so that he could win custody of Johnny, and Lucy asked if it was true. Dusty asked if Lucy was accusing him of murder. \n\n\nLucy said she knew that Dusty hadn't killed Cesar, but she wondered if he had set things in motion. Dusty denied it and said circumstances had just gone his way. Lucy still felt guilty that her father might spend years in prison for something he hadn't done, because of her, so Dusty said that after he was certain he had permanent custody of Johnny, if Craig was still in jail, he would help Lucy do whatever they could do to get Craig out. \n\n\nJack went to Carly's to let her know that the police investigation into the gun smuggling and murder at the docks had stalled. Jack thought Carly was the one person who could help them move the case forward. Jack insinuated that if the case against Craig stalled, the police might look elsewhere for a suspect. Carly asked if that was a threat, and Jack said she knew him better than that. Carly told Jack, \"You're not after the truth, Jack. You're after what you want to be the truth. And I will not help you with that.\" \n\n\nJack again tried to get Carly to see that if the police couldn't prove Craig had committed the crimes, they would look for another suspect, meaning they would turn to Carly. Jack pointed out that only Craig's word had cleared Carly of any wrongdoing. Carly asked Jack whether her word counted or not, and Jack said that in the past when he had taken Carly at her word, things hadn't worked out very well. Carly told Jack that was a cheap shot, and she told him to leave. \n\n\nOn Jack's way out, he spotted a half-empty bottle of vodka on a table. Carly told him she'd had a bad day the day before and had had a drink from a bottle that had already been opened. Jack asked whether Carly and Craig had done a lot of drinking together, and she told him that since they were in the vodka business, they sometimes drank at business meetings. Jack said that if Carly got drunk at meetings but Craig did not, then Carly couldn't really be sure of everything that might have happened at those meetings. \n\n\nCarly was angry with Jack because of what he was implying, but Jack reminded her he was trying to find out why a man had been killed. Carly asked what would happen if she did talk to Craig, and Jack said that depended on what Carly got out of Craig. Carly said that if she talked to Craig, she would be talking to him to try to find out the truth, not to try to get the answers Jack wanted. \n\n\nCarly went to the police station and told Craig that she was there because she was worried that maybe there was something he hadn't told her. Craig said that he'd been telling the truth, to everyone, but no one believed him. Carly said she couldn't understand how the guns could have gotten into their vodka shipments without either of them knowing about it. Craig said that was the mystery about smuggling in general. \n\n\nCarly asked if Craig thought Cesar had been killed because he was part of the smuggling operation, but Craig said he had no idea. When Carly asked if Craig had seen or heard anything else, Craig stopped her and said he wasn't going to answer any more of her questions, because he knew Jack had put her up to it. He told Carly that if she wanted him to tell the truth, then she should extend him the same courtesy. Craig thought Jack had told Carly that she was the next suspect down the list, and Carly admitted it. \n\n\nCraig then told Carly that she knew his strengths and weaknesses, and he asked if she really thought he would do something like smuggle guns and kill a man. Carly said, \"You may not want me to answer that.\" Craig put it a different way and asked if she knew why he had started the vodka business. Carly asked, \"To drive me insane?\" \n\n\nCraig said that he had started the business to get closer to Carly and to have a reason to visit her more often. Carly was both surprised and upset to realize that Craig had played her like that. Craig said he hadn't played her and that what they'd had together hadn't been trivial. Carly admitted what Craig said was true and then asked who Craig thought was really responsible for the crimes. Craig said he thought Dusty had done it. \n\n\nJack came in while Craig and Carly were talking, and he had an officer escort Craig to his cell. Jack then asked Carly what Craig had said, and Carly said, \"He's innocent, Jack. You've got to let him go.\"\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
