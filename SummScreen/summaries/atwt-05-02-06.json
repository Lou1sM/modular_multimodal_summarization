    "tvmega_recap": "Casey and Gwen's opening night is a success, as Maddie and Will view this pretty much from the sidelines. Will has an verbal altercation with Jade about her pretending to be Rose's daughter. She witnesses an exchange between him and Barbara and praises him on matching her fake sweetness point for point, but Will wonders if that is the same tactic she used on Lily and Holden? Luke later tells Jade he can't live this lie anymore. Will wonders about his mother's offer to send Gwen and Casey to Chicago. Gwen is upset Carly missed her singing and when Jack shows some concern for Carly having left, Gwen calls him on it. Carly and Nick hang out at her house, but later show back up at Crash, where Jack sees them come in together. He questions Carly who takes a tough stance with him, and then asks him point blank if he is jealous of her and Nick? Jack claims he is not, but he leaves quickly after Carly tries to put up a brave front by making a beeline to dance with Nick. As Hal and Susan hold vigil at Emily's bedside, Emily manages to mutter Paul's name. Bob tells them that is a good sign, and that they should find Paul and have him help them bring Emily out of it. Hal begrudgingly locates him and Meg, as they are ready to go upstairs to Meg's room. Meg convinces Paul to do it after he worries it could make matters worse for Emily. Paul sits with Emily and finally she opens her eyes.",
