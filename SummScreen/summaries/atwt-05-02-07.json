Vienna explains that Casey just wanted her to be happy by letting her go to college and live her dream.  As Henry listens to the two talk, Vienna encourages Maddie to enroll in college and make herself a better woman for when Casey gets out of jail.  Vienna tells Maddie not to \"give up her dream for a man\" and that Casey loves her for who she is, dreams and all.  Henry approaches the two and hugs his sister as she runs out to see Casey.

When Emily inquiries continue about Alison's new energy and great mood, Alison tells her there is nothing to worry about.  Alison excuses herself and goes back into Al's followed by Emily.  Inside Emily relays her sympathy to Lucinda over losing World Wide and reintroduces her to Alison.  While the two are alone for a moment, Alison talks about her memories of good times with Lucy's and then in the middle of their conversation Lucinda makes a secret proposition to Alison.  She immediately tells Lucinda that it is interesting that she would be asking her to do something because Paul Ryan has already been after her with a secret offer.  Lucinda lets her know that she and Paul are working together and that Alison is lucky to get the offer.  When Alison questions Lucinda about what they need her to do, Lucinda gives her a hundred dollar bill with a note that has an address and time and tells her to prove her worth by meeting her on time.

Alison quickly puts Emily off by telling her she needs to attend a meeting for her drug abuse and she leaves Al's to meet with Paul and Lucinda.  \n\n\nEarlier at the farmhouse, Paul arrives and greets Meg with a hug that lifts her off her feet.  Meg reminds Paul that they shouldn't be seen together, but both agree they miss one another.  When Paul asks Meg what her plans with Craig include, she tries to persuade Paul that she is just gaining Craig's trust and that even though he kissed her she wouldn't let it go any further.  Meg insists that she isn't trying to hurt Paul, but Paul tells her that his only concern is Craig hurting her.  With that thought he tells Meg that she is out of the plan to get back at Craig.  Meg lashes out and lets Paul know she has done too much \"ground work\" to let go of her part in the plot to bring Craig down.  After much prodding, Paul tells Meg that Alison Stewart is the key to his plan because of her voice sounding just like Rosanna.  He explains that he and Lucinda will use Alison to trick Craig into thinking that Rosanna is out of her coma and has returned to tell the police that he is the one who ran off the road.  Paul is convinced that Craig will be so tormented by Alison's impersonation of Rosanna that he will confess everything and go to jail.  Meg reminds Paul that Craig will need someone to confide in and as long as she stays on his good side she can be that person.  Meg persuades Paul to let her help and as the celebrate their agreement with a kiss Lucinda calls and tells Paul everything is going great with Alison and to meet her as planned.  Paul takes leave of Meg but asks her first to make sure she tells him the next time Craig comes around.  \n\n\nPaul and Lucinda meet at a hotel to discuss their plan for destroying Craig.  While there Alison arrives and questions the two about what kind of job Lucinda and Paul want her to do.  Lucinda tells Alison she isn't doing anything illegal and she will be paid very well for just a little work making a few phone calls.  Alison's curiosity is aroused and even though at first she is wary of the plot, she soon warms to the idea of working with Lucinda and Paul.   \n\n\n",
