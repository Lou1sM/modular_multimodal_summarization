Holden said Lily had changed her mind and decided she needed a little more time. Faith said she no longer believed her mother cared about them at all. Holden convinced the girls that Lily loved them and still loved him, too. He told them to trust him, saying Lily would come back to them, and everything would be okay. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Liberty got ready for school. Brad noticed that Liberty's shirt was rolled up so that her midriff was exposed, and he told her she couldn't go to school looking like that. Liberty said she didn't want to go to school anyway, but she rolled her shirt back down. Brad put his foot down and told Liberty she had to go to school. She said he could at least get breakfast for her first, so he and Liberty left, leaving Katie to take a shower to get ready for work. \n\n\nBrad and Liberty went to Al's Diner. They saw Parker there, and Brad took him aside and asked him to keep an eye on Liberty and help make her first day at school a good one. Parker told his uncle that he didn't think Liberty would need any help, but he agreed to keep an eye on her. \n\n\nLiberty went to school, and Brad sat down to eat breakfast. Henry came to his table and asked him who the teenager was and why Brad had bought breakfast for her. Brad explained who Liberty was, and then he asked Henry what it was like to raise a teenage girl, since Henry had basically raised Maddie. Henry responded, \"Be afraid. Be very afraid!\" Henry's advice boiled down to locking Liberty up until she was about 40 years old. \n\n\nBrad left, and Vienna sat down to talk with Henry. Vienna told Henry she was tired because she'd had to get up an hour early to mix batter by hand since a mixer had broken the night before. Henry became upset, telling Vienna that she deserved a better life. Vienna assured Henry she didn't need the jet-setting life anymore, but Henry said she at least deserved a weekend vacation. Henry said someone would need to watch the diner for them. Vienna suggested Brad and Katie, and Henry told her about the situation with Liberty. \n\n\nAt school, between classes, Liberty saw Parker sitting outside in the park by the reservoir. Flanked by five boys, Liberty approached Parker and told him to tell the guys that she was out of their league. The boys dared Liberty to prove it by jumping in the reservoir. Parker said it was too cold, and Liberty would get in trouble at school, but Liberty told the boys she would do it if they each put up $20. They handed the money to Parker, and Liberty ran and jumped into the reservoir. \n\n\nThe boys left. Parker gave Liberty his jacket, and Liberty talked Parker into taking $50 of the money she'd won, as a repayment for the skateboard accident. She then told Parker they should go spend their money. \n\n\nCarly went to the farm, where she found Jack having breakfast. Carly told Jack that she felt she should begin paying half of the expenses associated with her house, including the mortgage. Jack said it wasn't necessary, but Carly insisted and said she was ready to write Jack a check if he would just let her know how much she owed him. Jack looked over his bills and told Carly the current month's expenses were about $4,700. Carly was shocked to hear it was that high. \n\n\nJack told Carly again that he didn't mind taking care of the bills, since the kids lived with her. Carly told him she didn't want to feel like a charity case. She then said she was reopening Metro and would be able to pay Jack the next month. Carly told Jack she was positive she could make Metro a success. Jack worried about Carly taking on too much; Carly said she would eventually hire people to help her. Carly then told Jack goodbye; Holden walked in and said hello to Carly, who was on her way out. \n\n\nHolden told Jack it looked like Carly was \"on a mission,\" and Jack said Carly tended to bite off more than she could chew. Holden said Carly just wanted to prove she could be independent. Jack thought it was more that Carly wanted to prove she didn't need him anymore. Emma came home. Jack left, and Holden explained to Emma that Jack was worried about Carly reopening Metro, but he personally thought Carly would be fine. Emma told Holden he shouldn't get in the middle of the situation between Jack and Carly, and Holden said he wasn't. \n\n\nIn Old Town\n, Jack ran into Katie and asked if he could walk with her. She agreed. He told Katie he was trying to make things go more smoothly with Carly by agreeing to let the kids go to summer camp. Katie thought that was a good idea. Jack then told Katie that Carly was reopening Metro, and he talked about how much he didn't like it. Katie told Jack she didn't want to talk to him about his problems with his ex-wife. \n\n\nJack apologized to Katie. He then asked whether Katie and Brad were having any problems because of Liberty. Katie said she and Brad were dealing with Liberty together and that her marriage was a private matter. Jack said he thought they were friends; Katie said they were but that they were friends with boundaries, and those boundaries included Jack's marital and ex-marital problems being off limits, as well as Katie's marriage to Brad. She then excused herself and walked away. \n\n\nKatie ran into Brad, and then they saw Parker and Liberty approaching. When Brad asked why Liberty was wet and not in school, Liberty told him that some mean girls in gym class had stuffed her in a shower and turned on the water. She said she'd gotten away and run out of the school, where she had run into Parker, who gave her his jacket. Brad asked if Parker had at least \"busted some heads,\" and Parker replied incredulously, \"In the girls' locker room?\" Brad and Katie thanked Parker for looking after Liberty. \n\n\nBrad wanted to go to the school and find the \"mean girls\" so they could be punished, but Liberty said if he did that, it would be worse for her the next time. She said she needed to handle the girls herself, and Katie agreed. Brad asked Parker if he thought Liberty could handle it herself, and Parker said, \"Definitely.\" Liberty then asked if she could skip the rest of the day, since she was so \"traumatized,\" and Brad agreed. He asked Parker to take Liberty back to the hotel before he went back to school. Brad and Katie left for the studio. \n\n\nAt the studio, Brad was worried about how Liberty was doing. He asked a staff member to juggle their filming schedule so he could leave right after the show ended. Brad told Katie he felt he should go make sure Liberty was really okay, and Katie told him she thought his parenting instincts were right on the money. \n\n\nParker took Liberty to the Lakeview. Liberty tried to get Parker to stay, but he said he had to get back to school. He then told Liberty that while he was no angel, she was really something, considering how easily she had lied. Parker asked if Liberty would be at school the next day, and she said she didn't think school was really for her. She thanked Parker for not ratting her out, and he left. \n\n\nKatie and Brad arrived back at the Lakeview, where Liberty pretended to still be stressed about the events at school. Liberty went to take a bubble bath. Brad's phone rang; it was Susan, calling to say she'd put a rush on the DNA testing and would have the results the next day. Brad told Katie he was scared. Katie asked if he was scared that Liberty was his daughter or that she wasn't, and he replied, \"Both.\" \n\n\nCarly arrived at Metro only to find water everywhere because a pipe was leaking. Holden arrived shortly thereafter, and before Carly could warn him, he slipped and fell. They both started laughing. Holden told Carly she should call a plumber, but Carly said she wanted to try to fix it herself first. Holden offered to help. Together, they tightened a fitting under the sink, but when they tried to fix the faucet, it broke off, and water sprayed all over them. \n\n\nHolden and Carly got the water problem temporarily under control using duct tape, but Holden said Carly definitely needed a plumber. Carly asked how Holden had known she was at Metro, and he said Jack had told him. Carly then assumed Holden had come as Jack's spy, but Holden said he'd come to ask her for advice. He told Carly about Lily's disappointing non-return and how upset Faith had been. Carly told Holden how sorry she was and said it was sad that their kids had to pay for their parents' mistakes. She said it wasn't fair, and Holden said lots of things weren't fair, \"and that's why God made duct tape!\" \n\n\nJack walked into Metro and found Holden and Carly laughing and wet. He asked what was going on. Holden explained about the leaking pipe. Holden then said he was glad Jack was there, because he was a better plumber than Holden. Holden told Carly goodbye and left. Carly asked if Jack was there to say \"I told you so,\" but Jack said it was the opposite. \n\n\nJack apologized for trying to make Carly doubt herself about reopening Metro. He told her he hoped the reopening would be a huge success. Carly invited him to be there when Metro reopened, if for no other reason than so she could prove him wrong about the place. Jack smiled and said he wanted things to work out for Carly; she said if that were true, maybe he could take a look at the leaking pipe. Jack said he'd be honored. After he looked at the pipe, he told Carly it should hold until she could afford to get a real plumber to fix it after Metro reopened. He left to go to work. Carly called Holden to tell him his plumbing work had met with Jack's approval and to thank him for being a good friend. Holden said Carly had been a good friend to him, too. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie has to put the skids on Brad wanting to get frisky, they are waiting for Liberty to get dressed for school. Brad doesn't approve when she appears with a bare midriff, and makes her wear her shirt appropriately. Henry offers Brad some friendly advice when he hears Liberty may be his daughter. Carly makes a declaration that she wants to be independent and pay her share to Jack for the household expenses, but then is shocked when she finds that it $2000 a month. Faith and Natalie are disappointed that their mother isn't coming home today after all. Brad asks Parker to look out for Liberty at school since she doesn't know anyone. Right on course, she accepts a $100 dare from some teenage boys and she shares it with Parker. They are caught later skipping school and Liberty tells a tall tale of being physically harassed by girls at school. Emma tells Holden it's better that he not get involved between any of Jack and Carly's problems. Instead he ends up on his butt when he goes to Metro and is the victim of a leaky pipe. They end up laughing and commiserating over their children having to suffer from their mistakes. Jack walks in and notices this coziness. They agree they may not always get along, but they want each other happy.",
