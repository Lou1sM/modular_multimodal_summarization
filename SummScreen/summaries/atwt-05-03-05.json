He gives up on that, but then he tries to get her to agree to tell Mike and Jennifer that Craig found out about the baby's due date from her.  Henry believes it is the kind of secret that can come back and hurt her in the future and she must tell it as soon as possible.  He finally convinces her, and a reluctant Katie asks him to come along.  \n\n\nJennifer has had quite an active day.  First she finds out that Craig is gone, then she and Mike get back together and now she learns from Dusty that Street Jeans is back in business!  Dusty isn't sure she can handle all the pressure with a baby on the way, but Jennifer assures him she can.  As Jennifer leaves the Street Jeans office, she runs into Barbara.  Jennifer is actually nice to her as they talk about Craig's \"eviction\" from Oakdale. Barbara admits to having had a hand in it and says she'd do anything for Jennifer, who is very grateful.  They hug!  But Jennifer starts to feel sharp, stabbing pains in her tummy and is worried about the baby.  Barbara whisks her off to see Dr. Schilling.\n\n\nHenry and Katie are surprised to see Mike is such a great mood.  He tells them he knows they are there to try to get him and Jennifer back together again, but that they are too late.  He grins ear to ear as he tells them that Jennifer and he are getting married.  Katie is very relieved.  She chickens out regarding telling him the truth about how Craig found he was the baby's father and they leave.  Mike checks the messages on his cell phone and hears the message from Jennifer.   He panics and gets to the doctor's office just in time to hear the baby is fine, that what Jennifer is experiencing is totally normal.

She talks with Les about why Keith would want his sister dead.  Les tells her about J.J.'s trust fund and that if he, Les, is in jail, Keith stands to get about half a million dollars.  Les tells her that if Keith could kill his own sister for money, no telling what he might do to Lily!  \n\n\nLily is very unhappy to see Lucinda show up at her house.  Lucinda calls Keith a murderer and Lily tells her that she has gone too far and stomps out to join Keith on their date.\n\n\nKeith, however, has a visitor.  A visitor he is not very happy to see.
