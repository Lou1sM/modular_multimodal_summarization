    "tvmega_recap": "Will and Gwen talk about Crash; Will asks if she and Casey have plans to scout out new talent, after recalling his conversation with Barbara. Gwen tells him no, which seems to bother him. When Casey isn't sure that he'll be able to get Gwen to go on the trip to Chicago, Barbara pretty much rescinds her offer unless Gwen goes, claiming this was all about helping her daughter-in-law. Casey promises he will do everything in his power to get her to go. Carly comes to the station to pick up a sick Parker, but Jack sarcastically asks if she is there to meet Nick? When he sees Parker he apologizes; he can't help but still get jealous. Carly tells him it is a good thing because she knows how he feels; she is not going to get over him and she doesn't want Nick because she only wants him, and sooner or later he needs to stop denying his feelings. Emily comes to and sees Paul and assumes everything was a terrible dream, but when Susan tells her the neurologist will be in to see her and then she sees Meg outside, she realizes it is not a dream and cries out asking why they didn't let her die? The church is only available that night for Mike and Katie to get married, so they decide tonight is the night, as they start to make plans. Jade comes to see Lily after doing some laundry and she and Luke fight, which Lily partly overhears. Jade can't help but guilt Lily into having her around, by saying that she and Luke were fighting about her and the fact she doesn't want him happy with her. Casey meets up with Gwen and finally convinces her to come to Chicago with him for the day. Paul convinces Tom, strangely enough, to have Daniel come see his mom to give Emily something to live for. Emily finds out Paul saved her. She asks him why he did it \u0096 out of guilt? He just wants her to live and be happy because he cares for her still. She doesn't know what that means and shocks him when she asks if he will be there for her and will they be together after this? Mike and Katie go to Carly's to invite her to the wedding and in the end, Carly offers Katie a wedding dress she had before at BRO. Mike gets called to the station for questioning after tests came back on the skeleton, but he doesn't tell Katie. It seems the skeleton might be the woman who gave Mike the rubies. Jack shows him some evidence and Mike seems to recognize one of the items. Jade and Luke have another face off at Java and after she leaves, Will tries to talk to Luke, who is adamant that Jade is not his girlfriend. Gwen keeps trying to reach Will but he is occupied with Luke and does not hear his phone.",
