Meanwhile Allison sits in a hotel room with an almost giddy Paul and Lucinda who are still being very vague yet demanding about the \"job\" they want her to perform for them. Paul gives Allison a CD to listen to and quickly recognizes the voice. \"This is Rosanna Cabot?\" After knowing whose voice is on the CD, Allison demands to know who she is pulling a con on and why? Finally Paul gives up the truth to Craig, no explanation is needed as far as Allison is concerned, anything to get to or hurt Craig she is on board for. So she makes the call. The plan works. Craig freaks out, calling off all plans for the evening and making numerous phone calls about the matter. Paul, Lucinda, and Allison celebrate.
