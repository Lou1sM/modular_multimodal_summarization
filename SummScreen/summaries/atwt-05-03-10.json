She answered it, and it was a reminder from her physician for an appointment to run some \"routine tests\" to see if she was still cancer free.  Barbara examined her mouth and neck nodes and reassured herself that she had no symptoms, so there was no reason to worry.  She tried to draw some more, but it was difficult for her to concentrate.\n\n\nHenry awoke to find himself wearing only pajama bottoms and handcuffed to the headboard of the bed he shared with Vienna.  Vienna, wearing her most seductive lingerie, greeted Henry and told him that he could hide, but he couldn't run.  She began kissing Henry on his bare chest, but he continued to struggle and to remind her that they had agreed not to have sex until they were married.\n\n\nVienna, however, said that she had not agreed because that pledge was \"un-Swedish.\"  She then prepared to \"ravage\" Henry, who squawked about not using protection.  Barbara knocked on the door and identified herself.  She said she had a finished sketch of Vienna's wedding dress and some fabric samples for her to examine.\n\n\nVienna leapt off Henry and said she would be right there.  She threw on her peignoir but refused to cover Henry, much to his embarrassment.  Vienna opened the door, and Barbara walked in and gawked at an almost naked Henry in handcuffs.  Vienna looked at Barbara's sketch and declared that she loved it, and then she asked a few questions about beading and decorations.  Barbara also showed her the fabric samples, and Vienna scooped them up and took them into the bathroom where, she claimed, the light was better.\n\n\nWhen Henry and Barbara were alone, Henry begged her to release him from bondage.  He claimed that he wasn't Houdini, and he verbally pointed out the key to the handcuffs on the table.  Barbara picked up the key and went to one side of the bed and released the restraint.  Then she crawled over the top of Henry to get his second wrist.  Vienna walked out raving about the fabrics, and she hugged Barbara, who then made a grateful getaway.\n\n\nVienna asked Henry how he had gotten loose, but she wanted to slip the cuffs back on him.  He refused, so Vienna offered to be the one in bondage.  Henry refused to play, again citing their \"no sex before marriage\" deal.  He then accused Vienna of plotting to get pregnant without telling him.\n\n\nJack and Margo were in Carly's kitchen getting coffee, and Parker was parked outside the door, listening to their conversation.  The cops were talking about the Monte Carlo fire, and Parker heard Jack say he was curious about who Gabriel really was. Margo said she had no leads on that, and then Parker was horrified to hear Jack say that if someone hurt Gabriel and left him in the office and then intentionally lit the fire, they were looking at attempted murder charges.  Margo left for the station, as Jack saw Parker's expression and asked what was wrong. Parker denied that anything was amiss, as Janet entered the room, dressed for work.\n\n\nJanet thanked Parker for the flowers he had sent to Rocco's funeral, and Parker excused himself to go work on his term paper.  Jack seemed surprised that Janet was returning to work so soon after the rough trip to Melrose Park, and he said that he didn't think it was a good idea.  He wanted Janet to rest, not be on her feet all night.  Janet said she needed to be responsible for herself and Liberty, and that included earning a living.  She thanked him and left for work.\n\n\nAt Metro, Dusty interviewed a potential employee for the hostess job, but he could not bring himself to hire Janet's replacement.  He sent the young woman away, as Janet walked in.  Dusty was glad to see her back to work, and he apologized for making things worse at her father's funeral.  Janet explained that she needed to work in order to afford a place for her and Liberty to, but Dusty repeated his offer of letting them stay in the big brick house he had purchased.  Janet said she needed time and distance from everything because she was confused.  She could not promise that things would get any better.\n\n\nDusty offered any help Janet might need, and he headed for the kitchen to warn the staff of a busy evening ahead.  Janet suddenly exclaimed out loud and giggled.  Dusty ran back to see what was wrong, and Janet said she had just felt the baby kick for the first time.  She took Dusty's hand and placed it on her abdomen, and he was amazed by what he felt.\n\n\nJack went to the police station and looked at the Monte Carlo fire file.  Margo explained that the arson squad had been there twice already, and the point of origin of the fire appeared to be the fuse box.  She also said that Gabriel's toxic screen had been negative.  Margo was frustrated that she had been unable to locate the boy's family.  All they knew was that the boy had first been a handyman at Fashions, and then he had gone to Monte Carlo.  They also knew that the boy had been unconscious before the fire started, so he was not a suspect in the blaze.  Margo said the next logical people to interview were Craig and Carly.\n\n\nAt the Monte Carlo offices, Carly wandered through the wreckage and told Craig that she was looking for anything salvageable.  Craig said that everything was either \"waterlogged or toast.\"  He mumbled that things were not supposed to turn out that way, and Carly picked up on his words and his mood.  Craig accused Carly of \"badgering\" him, and he stomped out.  He went to the Lakeview bar, but Carly followed him.  Craig tossed down multiple scotches, but Carly told him that was a bad idea.  She reminded how badly she wanted a drink, but she refused to submit.  Carly couldn't understand what sorrows Craig was attempting to drown, but after the next drink, the bartender cut him off.\n\n\nCarly helped a stumbling Craig to his hotel room, and he kept mumbling, \"My son, my son!\"  Carly thought he was referring to Johnny, so she told him she would arrange for the sitter to keep the boy while Craig was in bad shape.  She got him on the couch, and then he passed out.  Carly stood over him and smacked him in the face, but she got no response.  She called him a \"son of a bitch,\" and accused him of stealing from Parker's trust fund and then setting the fire for the insurance money.  Carly said she hated Craig and picked up a large throw pillow and held it over his face.  She changed her mind about actually smothering him, however, and she went prowling instead.\n\n\nCarly looked through Craig's briefcase and then noticed that his computer was on.  She brought up the file on Parker's trust fund and searched the withdrawals.  She was furious when she saw what had happened to the money, and she printed out a copy of the file.  She thought a minute and then picked up the phone.  She called Margo and said she was worried that Craig might have alcohol poisoning, and she suggested that Margo check on her brother before long.  Carly walked out, leaving the printout of the trust fund on the desk.\n\n\nMargo told Jack about Carly's call, and she suggested that Craig and Carly were working together on the scheme.  Jack didn't see it that way, and he said it only meant that Carly did a good deed and didn't leave Craig in a gutter somewhere.  Margo did agree, however, that Craig was a much more likely suspect for burning down his own business.  Jack left for Metro then, and he walked in to check on Janet.\n\n\nDusty was still feeling the baby kick, so Jack put his hand on Janet's belly also.  He was impressed by the baby, and he wanted to take his ex-wife home to rest, but she insisted on staying. After Jack left, Dusty began handling the phone reservations, and Janet looked thoughtful.  She approached Dusty finally and said that she couldn't work there any longer because she couldn't work so closely with him without being \"with\" him.  She said being a hostess at Metro was the best job she'd ever had, so Dusty told her it was hers whenever she wanted to return.  Janet grabbed her coat and walked out.\n\n\nParker slipped out and went to the hospital.  He saw Gabriel's doctor, so he asked how the boy was doing.  The doctor said Gabriel was still unconscious and still breathing with the help of a ventilator.  He suggested Parker go in and talk to the boy, but Parker went home instead.  He felt remorseful, but Carly reassured him that Gabriel's injury had been an accident.  She was shocked, however, to learn that both Margo and Jack were investigating the accident.  She also told Parker that she had given Jack some answers that might help Parker out of trouble, but she refused to say more on that subject.\n\n\nCarly admitted that she thought Craig had set the fire to collect the insurance money.  Parker asked what his mom had done, and she said that all the boy needed to know was that it was going to be Craig who took the fall.  Just then Jack arrived home and asked what he was interrupting.  Carly delivered a dissertation about how Parker had an important paper due, and she sent the boy to his room.  She kissed Jack, and he wondered if he was missing something.  Parker watched as Jack and Carly hugged.\n\n\nIn her room at the Lakeview, Barbara gave herself a pep talk about not getting involved with Henry ever again.  Then she called Katie and asked about availing herself of Katie's matchmaking skills.\n\n\nMargo arrived at Craig's hotel room, and the door was unlocked.  She went in and her brother was still passed out on the couch.  Margo could smell the alcohol fumes, and she walked over to Craig's computer and found the information Carly had printed out about the squandering of Parker's trust fund.  Margo was horrified that her brother had stolen Parker's money.\n\n\n",
