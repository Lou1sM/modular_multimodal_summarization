Parker says it's a kid's book and he doesn't need it anymore; Jack suggests he keep it up in Emma's attic in case he changes his mind. Jack has to leave to go to the station, and when he does, Parker tosses the book in the trash again. Faith asks him what the book is about, and he tells her it's a story about a boy who gets lost in the woods and has to use the things he finds to help him get home. When he goes upstairs for a minute, Faith fishes the book out of the trash and puts it in Parker's backpack. Parker comes back downstairs and finds the book; turning, he looks at Faith, whose back is to him, then turns back around, smiling slightly, and puts the book back in his backpack. Faith turns around and smiles.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Kim receives a phone call from an anonymous woman who says she's in the town where Brad and Katie are going to meet the WOAK contest winner, and if she lays eyes on Brad, he's a dead man. She hangs up, and Kim is concerned enough to call Jack and explain the situation to him; she asks if he would go to the town if she clears it with Margo and gets her housekeeper to babysit Jack's kids for him. He agrees to go because Kim is so concerned that something might happen to Brad or Katie.\n\n\nBrad and Katie fly to the home town of the contest winner to meet her. Brad acknowledges having been to the town before but doesn't say much about anything that happened there. When they arrive at their hotel, the local TV producer shows them to their room and gets Katie to autograph a copy of \"Oakdale Confidential\" for his niece. He tells Brad and Katie that they are exactly the way they seem on TV. Katie has to leave to go to hair and makeup, and Jack arrives while she's gone; he tells Brad about the threat, but Brad says he has no idea who might have made the phone call. He tells Jack he's not the same guy he was when he was last in town, that he's a changed man now that he's got \"a good thing going\" with Katie. Katie walks in, and Brad has to leave for his turn at hair and makeup. Jack tells her it seems like she and Brad are clicking now, and she agrees. Before Jack can leave, Katie says she thinks they need to talk; when he asks what about, she replies, \"You and me.\"\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Ali and Emily are having breakfast, although Ali's only drinking coffee. Emily thinks she seems jittery and isn't eating enough, and she tries to get Ali to tell her about the support group meeting she supposedly went to yesterday; Ali offers vague details about the meeting, then she gets a call from Paul. She pretends she's talking to Will, and she asks Emily if she can go meet Will and Gwen for coffee; she says her counselors say she needs to spend time with the friends she had before her drug problems began. Emily agrees that she should go, but as Ali is putting on her sunglasses and leaving, Dusty walks up and wonders where she's going. Alison leaves, and Dusty says the sunglasses and the lack of eating ought to be making Emily suspicious. Emily says Alison can't afford drugs based on what she's making at Al's Diner. \n\n\nCraig tells a private investigator that Rosanna has disappeared, and he needs to find her. Meanwhile, at Montgomery Enterprises, Lucinda and the board members are waiting for Craig so a board meeting can begin; she hints that perhaps this takeover is proving too much for Craig to handle.\n\n\nAlison goes to meet Paul; she takes one of the chocolate bars from the refrigerator in the hotel room and eats it. Paul becomes concerned about Alison's behavior and all the sugar she's eating, when Lucinda sends him a text message saying, \"We're on.\"\n\n\nAt the board meeting, Craig enters and apologizes for keeping them all waiting. His assistant comes in and says there's a woman on the phone who says she urgently needs to speak to Craig but who won't give her name; Craig excuses himself and takes the call. It's Alison, impersonating Rosanna as she says, \"I know you tried to kill me, Craig.\" Then Paul drops a vase and shatters it so that Craig hears the sound of breaking glass. Alison hangs up, and Craig, shaken, returns to the boardroom; he apologizes and says he'll need to reschedule their meeting. Lucinda says the next time might not be convenient for her, and he suggests that her presence is not necessary. She says someone needs to keep an eye on him, and he explodes, saying, \"This is MY company!\" Lucinda tells him not to lose his cool, and then she tells the board members, \"In my day, we got things done.\" Craig goes to Fairwinds, and when he goes to pour himself a drink, he sees a shattered photograph of Rosanna on the floor. He calls the housekeeper in and demands to know how that happened, but she has no idea; she says it was fine when she dusted this morning, but then she had to go to the market. Craig says someone's been in the house, and after the housekeeper leaves the room, he says, \"She did this!\"\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty shows Emily a mockup of the front page of the Intruder newspaper, and Emily says it's all wrong because of the Intruder's target audience; Dusty is impressed with her take on it and says he'll call the office to have them change it. After he leaves, Cheri walks up and joins Emily, saying she'd really like to have her back in the fold and will make their split 70/30 if she'll come back. Emily insists that part of her life is over now, saying she has people who are counting on her. Dusty returns, and Cheri leaves; Emily fills Dusty in on Cheri's offer, and when he asks why she turned Cheri down, Emily tells him the story of how she accidentally stumbled into prostitution in the first place, saying that although it felt empowering in the beginning, it turned out to be much different from what she wanted. She tells Dusty seeing Alison in that movie is what saved her, and now she needs to save Alison. Dusty leaves to go to the office, and Emily goes back to get her purse. Turning to leave, she almost bumps into Alison and Paul.\n\n\n\n\n",
