    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg faked a bad cold and asked Paul to take Eliza to her doctor's appointment at Memorial. Then Meg, wearing only a towel and a smile, sprayed her favorite perfume around her bedroom and waited for Paul. When he entered, she told him to have the pediatrician check Eliza's ears, and then she threw off the towel, but not the smile. She put on a dressing gown in front of Paul, who turned around and walked out. \n\n\nDusty brought Johnny to Lucy after his play date, and the boy began looking for Craig in the suite. Dusty explained that his \"other daddy\" had to go away for a while, but that he would be moving in to look after Johnny. Lucy was surprised and upset when Dusty made the announcement since he had not discussed it with her previously. Dusty explained again that Jennifer's last wish had been for him to raise her boy, and he was doing whatever he needed to for that to happen. \n\n\nDusty promised Lucy that he would sleep on the couch and pick up after himself. He said he felt that it would be better for Johnny to have both of them around. Dusty took a hungry Johnny downstairs to get some French fries. \n\n\nParker arrived home from his first day back at school and told Carly that it had been \"weird\" being back in the routine. His friends all loved his new car, however. Parker could not understand why Craig was still at the police station, so Carly said that Jack suspected him of smuggling guns with their vodka shipment, and that a dock worker had died. Parker asked if Craig did it, but his mother did not believe that. Parker went up to do his homework. \n\n\nAt the police station, Craig demanded that Jack release him. Jack said Cesar had died between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. on April 24, and Craig was delighted to tell him that he had the perfect alibi for that time, and that alibi was none other than Parker. Jack refused to bring Parker in for questioning, and he accused Craig of trying to use blackmail to force Parker to lie for him. The two of them yelled at one another until Craig asked for some alone time. \n\n\nCraig used his phone call to talk with Carly instead of his lawyer. He asked for her help and requested that she bring Parker to the station to be his alibi. Carly said to call his lawyer, and she hung up on him. Craig called back and pretended Carly was the receptionist at his attorney's office. \n\n\nHe explained that Parker had been in Craig's suite at the Lakeview receiving the check for his new car at the exact time that someone had killed Cesar. Parker was all Craig had, but Carly still refused to bring the boy to talk to Jack. Craig was desperate, and when Jack walked in, he pretended he was talking to his lawyer. \n\n\nAfter Paul left with the baby, Meg went to the Lakeview and asked for Dusty. Johnny ran up to her, and he said his \"Daddy D\" was going to be living with him and \"Lulu.\" Lucy took the boy to get his French fries, while Dusty explained that Craig had gotten into big trouble, and Dusty had gotten back custody of Johnny. Meg remarked that it looked as if he had Lucy, too. \n\n\nShe was pleased that Johnny was with Dusty, but Dusty was unhappy that Meg was staying at Fairwinds with crazy Paul. He demanded to know the real reason she was there, and he did not believe Meg when she claimed to still love Paul. She told Dusty there was nothing she wanted from him anymore and swore she was really happy, but she began to cry. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Paul waited a long time for the doctor to see Eliza. The baby smiled nicely at him, and Paul pulled out his phone to check on Meg. He called her at Fairwinds, but Meg did not answer. Paul waited a while longer, and then he called again. This time, he imagined that Meg and Dusty were making love on Meg's bed and also making fun of Paul's calling. Finally a nurse called Eliza in to see the pediatrician. \n\n\nJack said that Craig had surprised him by not lawyering up immediately. Craig said he no longer had custody of his son, so he had to prove his innocence to get the boy back. He asked Jack to call Parker for a statement, but Jack prepared instead to send Craig back to his cell. Suddenly Carly and Parker appeared, and Jack argued with his ex-wife about why she had brought their son to the police station. \n\n\nCraig was pleased that Parker was going to tell the truth about where he was on the afternoon of April 24, and the teen said he had been in Craig's room in the Lakeview because he was upset that Liberty had asked for an annulment. He said he got there about 3:00, but Jack maintained that Craig still had plenty of time to give Parker his check and kill Cesar. \n\n\nJack suspected that Craig had manipulated the whole scenario just so he would have a cover story. Jack sent Parker home, and he was still convinced that Craig was their man. He was furious that Craig would try and use a 16-year-old kid to get off the hook. \n\n\nDusty sat Meg down in the lobby of the Lakeview and apologized for making her cry. Meg said she had a terrible cold and no tissues, so Dusty handed her a monogrammed handkerchief from his pocket. Meg got up to leave and thanked Dusty for helping her. She put the handkerchief in her purse and walked out. \n\n\nDusty went to find Lucy, who said Johnny was in with the chef selecting a special dessert. She was unhappy that she was allowing her father to sit in jail for something she knew he did not do. Lucy asked about Meg, and Dusty said she had gone back to living with Paul. He said he could not forget about her, however, and Lucy got up and went to find Johnny. \n\n\nMeg went home and hurriedly put her dressing gown back on. She took Dusty's monogrammed handkerchief and placed it in an obvious place on her bed table. Paul walked in, and Meg asked about the baby. He said that the doctor had declared Eliza perfect, including her ears. Meg used the handkerchief and then put it down to go check on the baby. \n\n\nPaul picked up the handkerchief and saw the \"D D\" initials, and muttered, \"Donovan.\" Meg returned as Paul put the handkerchief in his pocket. \n\n\nMeg asked if he was upset, so Paul said that his mother wanted him to meet with some buyers in Paris right away. He said he would be gone a week and asked her to accompany him, along with Eliza. Meg asked for some time to think about it, but rather quickly said she would love to go to Paris, but because she had a bad cold, she did not think she should fly. She offered to make all the travel reservations for him, however, if he would tell her exactly when he wanted to leave and return. \n\n\nCarly chewed out Jack for being so blinded by hatred for Craig. She said the smuggling and murder were done sloppily, and that was not Craig's style. Besides, there was no reason that Craig would have to kill Cesar. Jack began yelling, and he reminded her that Craig was a felon with a nasty record. \n\n\nCarly continued to defend Craig, and then an officer called Jack away. Carly went out to talk with Craig, who was thinking more and more that Dusty had set him up. He asked Carly to help him prove it. \n\n\nIn Craig's suite, Dusty changed his shirt, as Johnny fell asleep for a nap. Lucy was uncomfortable being around a half-naked Dusty, and he asked her why she was so squeamish, especially since she was a doctor. Lucy answered that she was also a woman who had been intimate with him, something he seemed to have forgotten. She scolded him for bad handling of the situation, and Dusty asked if she wanted more out of their relationship. Lucy started to answer, but suddenly she walked out. \n\n\nDusty stopped Lucy in the hall, and they continued their discussion. Dusty said that Lucy was very important to him, but neither of them saw Carly lurking in the corridor and listening to their conversation. Lucy refused to go back inside the suite and act as if they were a family. After all they had been through, Lucy felt that Dusty thought of her as just a glorified nanny. Dusty declared that they were friends, and Lucy walked off to her own room. \n\n\nPaul returned to Meg's room, and found that she had made all his travel arrangements. She also offered to help him pack, but Paul told her to rest. Meg held his hand longer than necessary, and then she asked him to lie with her until she fell asleep. Paul refused, and went downstairs immediately and cancelled all the reservations. Meg listened in on her room extension and smiled. \n\n\nDusty greeted Johnny when he awoke from his nap, and the boy asked for Lucy. Dusty told him that it might just be the two of them that night. \n\n\nJack asked an officer to take Craig back to his cell. Craig taunted Jack about being all wrong in his assessment of the case. \n\n\nCarly approached Lucy in the lobby of the Lakeview and greeted her. She said Craig was holding up all right at the police station. She also told the girl that she thought Lucy's father was innocent, and Lucy agreed. Carly offered to help Lucy prove his innocence.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty talks about moving in with Johnny, as Lucy is nearby listening. She isn't sure, but Dusty is able to convince her. Meg pretends to have a cold when Paul has to take Eliza to her appointment. Meg heads out after placing some doubt in Paul's mind and goes to bump into Dusty at the Lakeview.

Later, Paul cancels his supposed trip to Paris, as a smiling Meg listens in on the extension. Craig and Jack butt heads, as Craig thinks his hatred is causing Jack to not look into any other theories over the killing of Caesar.

Craig sneaks in a call to Carly to ask her to bring down Parker. Carly initially refuses, but Craig won't give up. Jack and Craig are going at it again when Carly and Parker show up. Jack is angry, but Parker backs up Craig's story, but he can't say specifically of the time being exactly at 3PM, but it is close enough to that time. That is all Jack needs to decide that Craig is still guilty and pathetic for using a 16 year old, but everyone sees Craig's innocence. Carly tries to talk with Jack, but she can't sway him. Craig is happy that Carly believes him. Carly offers to help prove that Dusty was the one that set him up. An agitated Lucy tells Dusty that she is feeling like a glorified nanny and that everything that is going down is all about him.

Johnny is wondering where Lucy and Craig are, but Dusty hopes he is happy to just be with him. Carly sees Lucy afterwards; she needs her help because the two of them are the only ones that seem to believe in Craig's innocence. She wants Lucy to help her prove just that.",
