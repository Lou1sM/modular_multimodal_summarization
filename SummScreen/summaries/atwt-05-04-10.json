    "soap_central": "\n\nBarbara met Katie in the lobby of the Lakview, and she was eager to meet the \"date\" whom Katie had set up for her.  Katie pointed out a nice looking gentleman who waved enthusiastically at her and Barbara from across the lobby.  \"Oo-la-la!\" chortled Barbara, who liked what she saw.  Katie introduced Barbara to Rex, an anchor man at WOAK.  He and Barbara sat at a table, and he complimented her on her beauty.\n\n\nKatie excused herself and left the two daters alone.  Rex made a few smarmy remarks to break the ice, including his asking Barbara which of his newscasts was her all-time favorite.  He reeled off several by name until Barbara admitted that she got most of her news from the Internet.  Rex called that \"abhorrent,\" and he referred to her as \"Barbie.\"\n\n\nRex next invited \"Barbie\" to go to his place to watch a DVD of his Emmy-worthy broadcast called \"Funky Flowers.\" Barbara muttered, \"Not in this lifetime.\"  Rex then announced that he found \"Barbie\" to be \"less than exciting,\" a comment that caught the ear of a handsome airline pilot sitting at the next table.  The captain approached and, pretending that they were well acquainted, he begged Barbara to forgive him.\n\n\n\"Who's the flyboy?\" asked Rex, as the captain introduced himself as Jim, and he further apologized for keeping Barbara waiting for him.  He thanked Rex for keeping his lady company, as Barbara excused herself from Rex and led Jim away from the table.  Jim whispered to her to \"roll with it,\" unless she wanted to spend the evening listening to \"Rex's greatest hits.\"  Barbara caught on, so she ushered Jim back to the table and said she hoped Rex understood, but her boyfriend was back.  Rex looked stunned, and he stood up and muttered \"Signing off!\" as he made his exit.  Jim asked Barbara to have lunch with him, and she agreed.\n\n\nHenry looked all around his bed for his watch, as Vienna pled with him to stay with her.  Henry was depressed because his fianc\u00e9e had tried to trick him into getting her pregnant.  Vienna could not understand why Henry was stalling their wedding and putting off starting a family, but she agreed to compromise: they could delay the nuptials if Henry would agree to get working on the baby.  Henry asked why it seemed such a \"now or never\" situation, and he was reluctant to make himself vulnerable to the agony of possibly losing another child.\n\n\nHenry declared that he wanted to be in a solid marriage before they considered bringing a baby into their lives.  He had doubts about his ability to be a good father, and he cited his crazy mother and maniacal father.  He admitted he just wasn't at the point of wanting to father a child.  Vienna began to cry, and she asked Henry if he was saying that he didn't want to marry her, so Henry ran into the bathroom.\n\n\nHenry eventually walked out and sat beside Vienna on the foot of the bed.  He said he loved her, and a guy would have to be crazy not to want to wake up next to Vienna Hyatt every day.  Vienna got desperate and begged Henry to get in bed with her and show her how much he loved her.  She shed her tears and wondered exactly what it was that was holding her lover back.  Henry described it as feeling that Vienna deserved better, and he asked for time and space.  Then Henry suggested that they get separate rooms for a while, and Vienna became angry and suggested that Henry could lose the best thing he'd ever had, and she flounced into the bathroom, as Henry left the room.  \n\n\nAlison walked through Old Town, and Casey called to her.  She felt awkward, so Casey reminded her that they had agreed to try and feel more comfortable with one another.  Casey asked if Alison would like to get a coffee with him, and she said that she was on her way to meet Katie to see a \"chick flick\" at the movies, and it was a \"girls only\" event.  She went to the theater and met Katie, and Katie led the way to a seat right next to Chris Hughes, who was eating a huge bucket of popcorn.  \n\n\nAlison told Katie that her matchmaking had to stop, and Chris chimed in that it was driving him nuts, as well.  They sat down with Katie in the middle, until she suddenly remembered that she was taking Jacob to a \"Mommy and Me\" swimming lesson that day.  She excused herself, and Alison lit into Chris and told him that since Katie was his good friend, he should have discouraged her more.  Alison was irritated, and she claimed she was in no way \"looking for romance.\"  Chris advised her to relax and enjoy the movie, but Alison didn't like the idea.  Chris said he needed a break, so he was going to stay, and then Alison realized that her favorite actor was in the show, so she took the seat next to Chris.\n\n\nAfter the movie, Chris and Alison were in Old Town enjoying themselves, and Casey walked by.  Chris was spinning Alison around, and they were laughing, and Casey muttered, \"Girls only, eh?\"  Alison assured him that she had not lied to him, and she explained that Katie had invited both her and Chris to the show.  Casey was rude to Alison, but Chris stuck up for her as Casey took off.  Alison looked at Chris and declared that the movie had been a mistake. She ran off, and Chris returned to the hospital. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Chris approached Reid Oliver who was checking Noah Mayer's chart prior to his surgery.  Chris pointed out that the surgery Oliver was doing was still considered experimental, but Reid assured him that it was not risky with his talent.  He also called Chris \"Doogie.\"\n\n\nLuke walked into Noah's room and told him that he had brought Noah's video camera.  He offered to record the big moment in Noah's life when he regained his sight, and he asked Noah to say something.  Noah said he had been waiting for the next moments for what seemed like a lifetime, and he was \"so revved\" at the thought of seeing again. He thanked Luke for standing by during the surgery, and he also apologized for some things he had said recently.  Noah asked Luke to get in the picture with him, so Luke sat on the bed and filmed both of them.  They were laughing when Dr. Oliver walked in, and Noah asked him for his life back.  A nurse arrived and took Noah in a wheel chair to the operating room.\n\n\nIn the operating room, Noah lay on the table while Dr. Oliver scrubbed in.  When the doctor joined them, the nurse informed Reid that Noah's blood pressure was spiking, and Noah confessed that he was really nervous.  Reid cracked some jokes, and Noah began to relax, but he still fought the anesthetic.  He asked for reassurance that the surgery would be successful, and Dr. Oliver advised him to close his eyes, and the next time he opened them, Noah would be able to see.\n\n\nKatie found Luke pacing in the waiting room, and she was sorry that she had missed Reid.  She showed Luke an Irish shamrock charm that she had wanted to give the doctor for good luck, but instead she handed it to Luke.  She mentioned that Reid seemed to really like it in Oakdale, and he also liked Luke.  Luke said that right before Noah's surgery, Reid had been acting rude again, so Katie asked if he had seen Noah and Luke together.  Luke assured her that he and Noah were completely broken up, but Katie thought that something had changed about Reid since his return from Texas. She hinted that she and Luke both knew what it was.\n\n\nA nurse arrived in the waiting room to tell Luke that Noah's surgery was beginning and would take a couple of hours.  Luke warned Katie that he couldn't do the matchmaking thing while he was so distracted about Noah.  He said that even though he and Noah were no longer a couple, he still loved and had concern for Noah.  Katie wished Luke good luck, and she headed home.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Barbara and her pilot were conversing, and she inadvertently brought up Henry's name.  Then she mentioned him again and said how completely wrong for her he was.  Barbara could not stop talking about her ex-lover, until she suddenly realized that she was as self-centered as Rex.  Jim excused himself to check in with his airline, but when he retuned, he warned, they could talk about anything but Henry.\n\n\nHenry walked into the lobby and saw Barbara sitting alone at a table.  He began walking over to her, but just then Jim the pilot returned and apologized for keeping Barbara waiting.  He said he was all clear for the rest of the day and then asked if they were \"done with Henry.\"  Barbara grinned and said, \"Henry who?\"  Henry overheard the conversation and was crushed.\n\n\nHenry went to Katie's and asked her to talk again with Vienna and \"slow her down.\"  He said Vienna had tried to trick him into impregnating her, complete with handcuffs.  Katie said Vienna was more desperate than she thought, but Katie was shocked that Henry had suggested separate rooms.  Henry claimed he was trying to keep his \"soldiers from getting hijacked,\" but Katie yelled at him to man up, find Vienna, and make a baby.  She shoved him out the door, but Henry wormed his way back in.  Katie said if he blew it again, Vienna was gone for good.\n\n\nHenry gave a pitch for a good life with Vienna, but then he said, \"On the other hand...\"  Katie stopped him there and forbade him to mention Barbara Ryan's name. Katie claimed Henry was afraid of commitment, but he responded that he had better just find his fianc\u00e9e and throw himself at her feet.  Katie encouraged him to go after what made him happy, and everything would work out.  Henry walked out, as Katie said to herself, \"This matchmaking stuff is hell.\"  \n\n\nThe babysitter brought baby Jacob home, and Katie put him down for a nap.  Chris Hughes pounded on her door and demanded that Katie back off with Alison.  He said that he and Alison were a \"train wreck,\" and he begged Katie to stop matchmaking.  He remarked that he knew Katie was lonely, but that upset her.  He ordered her to get off his case before she drove every eligible female in Oakdale away.  Chris was shouting so loudly that he awakened Jacob, so Katie brought the baby out and had Chris hold him while she fixed a bottle.  Chris told the infant that his mama was lonely and needed a man.\n\n\nVienna went to Metro and sat at the bar.  She ordered a \"Swedish Iceberg,\" a mixture of champagne, vodka, and lime juice.  Casey Hughes walked in and sat beside Vienna and said he'd have one of those, as well.  He asked Vienna if she and Henry were still together, and Vienna said she thought they were.  Then she asked Casey what was wrong with her, and Casey looked at her and grinned, \"Nothing at all.\"  Vienna declared that Henry found her quite resistible lately, so Casey asked if Henry suffered from \"equipment failure.\"  Vienna assured him that Henry did not have that affliction, and Casey replied that Henry was a fool.\n\n\nCasey told Vienna that while she was in Europe, his fianc\u00e9e, Alison, had cheated on him right before the wedding, and now she had \"the hots\" for his uncle.  Vienna said she could top that and began her sad tale.  They ordered more Swedish Icebergs, and Casey talked about his pre-law courses.  Vienna complimented Casey on his hair and eyes, and then she suggested they get out of there together.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Dr. Oliver began working on Noah, as the boy dreamed of filming Luke.  Suddenly, however, the dream faded to black, and the doctor called for suction because he was \"losing him.\"  Meanwhile, Luke continued to pace until Reid finally appeared.  He said he had found some additional damage that the CT scan and MRI had not revealed.  A blood vessel had leaked, which had caused some complications.  Luke asked if that meant that Noah might not regain his sight, but the doctor said the boy's eyesight was not part of the problem.  Then Reid admitted that Noah might have suffered brain damage, but they would not know until he woke up.\n\n\n",
