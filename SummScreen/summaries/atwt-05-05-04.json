    "tvmega_recap": "Chris chats with Allison at the hospital about the previous night; she lies to say she was at her ceramics class. Aaron drops by and she begs him to help her lie by buying some pottery from a store near her house. They meet (somewhere?) and he brings by a vase. Just as she's saying it's too good, Kim and Helen walk up. Kim goes on and on about how good the pottery; Chris arrives and is also amazed. Helena helps Allison out by suggesting that there won't be more pottery like that because her teacher probably helped her a bit. Chris has some plans for her talent. Katie has spent the night going through a psychiatric evaluation at the station and she's not happy about it.

Mike goes to the station and is surprised that they are taking Katie away to the institution. She begs him not to trust Pilar.
