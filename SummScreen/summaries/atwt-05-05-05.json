Keith told her about being in debt and that he was going to borrow money from the fund and pay it back when he started working again. Lily forgave him and believed that he would be true to his word and pay the trust fund back. Lily offered Keith the use of her grandfather's house and he gladly accepted.

Lisa asked why he didn't go to the house to pick Faith up. Holden replied that he wasn't going to the house because of Keith. Lisa was quick to say that Keith hadn't paid his hotel bill. Holden thought that Keith was in debt and Lisa said it made sense that Keith was spending time with Lily. Holden asked Lisa if he could get into Keith's room. Lisa made an excuse that it would be unethical to do so but conveniently left the master key on the counter and walked away.

Lisa told Holden to tell Lily before it was too late. Faith arrived and told Holden that Uncle Keith was moving into great-grandpa's house! \n\n\n",
