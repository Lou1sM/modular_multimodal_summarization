Brad told Katie that he worried if the results showed that Liberty was his daughter, he would lose Katie. Katie took Brad into their office and explained that regardless of Liberty's paternity, she would stay with him. Brad believed that being a father to a teenage girl might change him, and he would no longer be the fun guy Katie loved. \n\n\nBrad told Katie that he would understand if she wanted out of their marriage, but Katie reassured Brad that she loved him, but she joked she would go if he lost his sense of humor. Katie convinced Brad he was just cranky because they hadn't been able to share the marital bed since Liberty had been in their room at the Lakeview. Brad rushed Katie out of the office and back to the hotel. \n\n\nOnce Brad and Katie returned to their room, he picked her up in his arms and placed her on the bed, but an unusual sound sent the two looking for the source. They tore the bed apart and realized they had landed on a bag of chips Liberty had left in the bed. With the chips all over the bed, the two got to work cleaning up the mess but were interrupted by a call from Susan, who told them the paternity test results were in. Susan explained that Brad needed to go to the hospital to sign for the results, so he and Katie rushed right over to Memorial. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Brad found out once and for all that Liberty was his daughter. Katie hugged Brad to celebrate but looked concerned about their future. Brad was excited that Liberty was his daughter and told Katie that he wanted to be the best dad possible. Katie insisted that Brad already had the makings of a wonderful father, and Liberty was lucky to have found him. Brad asked Katie to take him to find Liberty so they could share the good news with her. \n\n\nLiberty waited outside the high school during the lunch hour to return Parker's jacket. She convinced Parker to leave campus with her for a little adventure in town. As the two sat amongst the stores of Oakdale, Liberty noticed that Parker looked anxious. He told her that he was afraid of getting caught ditching school and was worried he would end up grounded again. Liberty took Parker shopping at the mall for a video game to get his mind off his classes. \n\n\nAfter the mall, Liberty and Parker went to Al's for a midday snack. Parker insisted that Liberty was skipping school and eating up a storm because she was anticipating the results of her DNA test. Liberty told Parker to quit talking about the DNA results, or she would tell Jack that Parker had left school. Parker decided it was time to get back to school, but Liberty asked him to plan a new escapade for the following day. Parker told Liberty that he hoped the results would end up the way she wanted. \n\n\nAs Parker and Liberty returned to school, Brad and Katie stopped them in the parking lot. Brad told her they had some news for her, but first he wanted to know what she was doing out of school. Brad assumed Liberty had been bullied again and insisted on going in to talk to the principal, but Liberty stopped him and said she and Parker were just out getting some air. Liberty quickly left campus with Brad and Katie to find out the results of her test. \n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Brad handed Liberty a medal he had won in high school, and Liberty understood that the gift meant he was her father. Brad confirmed her realization. Liberty was happy with the news and hugged Brad. \n\n\nAlison complained to a fellow nursing student about how difficult the classes were, and her new friend pointed out that Alison was dating her own expert tutor, Chris. Chris saw the two women talking, approached Alison, and tried to give her a bouquet of flowers, but Alison told him to leave her alone and walked away. Chris chased after Alison, and once they were alone, she asked him to stop giving her gifts and showering her with affection at work. She explained that everyone in the hospital was talking about them, and she worried people would think Chris was helping her get ahead in class. Chris tried to convince Alison they could date without people gossiping, but his beeper called him away to a waiting patient before they could finish their conversation. \n\n\nBack in his office, Chris's mom dropped by for a visit and offered her apologies to Chris for insulting Alison at dinner. Kim told her son that he should take his time before getting serious with Alison, and Chris said that Alison felt the same way. Kim listened intently as Chris explained that Alison didn't want to start an intense relationship when she was busy with school. Kim was impressed that Alison was thinking clearly and told Chris that he should use the time to figure out what he wanted. Chris thanked his mom for her advice but said he wasn't giving up on Alison. Kim told Chris to respect Alison's wishes, but he thought he knew what Alison really wanted. \n\n\nAlison arrived at Java and ran into Aaron, who offered to help her study for her test. At first, Alison wasn't convinced Aaron could help, but he told her he could get her a good tutor. Aaron called Meg, and she explained Alison's schoolwork to her. Alison was grateful to Aaron for helping her get through her work, and the two sat down to talk. Alison asked Aaron how things were with Sofie, and Aaron explained that his relationship with Sofie was over. Alison couldn't hide her joy that Sofie and Aaron were through, and she made a few jokes at Sofie's expense. \n\n\nAaron congratulated Alison on returning to school but warned her about getting involved with Chris. Alison told Aaron that her relationship with Chris was off-limits for discussion. Aaron wanted to know why Alison could talk about Sofie, but he couldn't talk about Chris. Alison insisted that Chris was on her side and really cared about her, but Aaron reminded her that she had said the exact same thing before she had broken off her engagement to Chris the last time. Alison told Aaron to leave, but before he got up from the table, he told her all he wanted was for her to be happy. \n\n\nWhile Aaron sat at the counter and Alison studied at her table, Chris arrived and asked Alison to dinner again. This time, Alison accepted as Aaron looked on. Chris was thrilled that Alison had agreed to go on a date and told her he would see her later. After Chris left, Aaron walked up to Alison and told her he knew what she was doing, but Alison said he didn't know her at all and walked away. \n\n\nAt work, Emily was busy on the phone, but Casey kept interrupting her conversation by shoving a tacky coffee mug inscribed with \"I love my boss\" in her face. Emily got off the phone and told Casey he would need to do more than flatter her with cheap gifts to get ahead in the newspaper business. Casey asked about the story he had heard her talking about on the phone, and Emily began to describe how some very important manuscripts had been stolen from Oakdale University. Casey told her he already knew about the robbery, and he wanted to be her new reporter for anything going on at the campus. Emily quizzed Casey about the university scene to see if he knew his way around, but even though he couldn't answer all her questions, his confidence convinced Emily he could get the story she needed. She sent Casey out to find out who was behind the crime. \n\n\nAfter her talk with Casey, Emily went down to the Oakdale police station and tried to flatter a patrolman into telling her what he knew about the stolen manuscripts. Margo saw Emily talking to one of her cops and told her the robbery was not open for discussion. Emily asked Margo when she was going to stop punishing her, but Margo explained she was tired of Emily's lies and manipulations of the people Margo loved. Margo told Emily that her past as a hooker made Margo despise her more than ever and that sooner or later, Casey would figure out that Emily was bad news. Emily stormed out of the station. \n\n\nCasey began to investigate the theft at the college right away and found his old roommate and gambling buddy, Elwood, at Java. He asked Elwood to try to find out who was in need of some quick cash on campus, and Elwood said he would look into it and get back to Casey, as long as Casey protected his identity. \n\n\nEmily returned to work and told Casey about her argument with Margo. He agreed to meet his mother for lunch and find out what he could about the missing manuscripts then report back to Emily. \n\n\nCasey arrived at home to have lunch with his mom and threw his bag by the door. When he found no one was home, he went upstairs, leaving his backpack by the open patio door. With Casey out of the room, Elwood sneaked in and left undetected. When Margo arrived home for lunch, she found Casey's bag open with one of the missing manuscripts inside. Casey insisted he knew nothing about the stolen documents or how they had ended up in his possession, but Margo was reluctant to believe him. \n\n\n",
