She wanted to film the principals taking a childbirth class at Memorial. She wanted to tape that afternoon, but Vienna said that Henry was working. Katie suggested they do it without Henry, so Kim left to make the arrangements. \n\n\nVienna could not understand why Katie wanted to exclude Henry, but both Brad and Katie said they were just thinking about what would be best for the show. Katie mentioned that Henry was becoming too possessive about their baby and had been acting very weird lately. She was also picking up strange vibes from him. Katie was willing to tell Henry about the classes, but she wanted to tape the first one right away. Vienna did not quite understand, but she agreed. \n\n\nAt the diner, Dr. Bob ordered breakfast from Henry, who was deeply lost in private thoughts. Bob asked if something was wrong, and Henry admitted there was. He sat with Bob and asked if there was something wrong with someone who did not want kids. Henry said he was talking about himself and that he had made an intellectual decision. He explained how, out of necessity, he had been a father to his younger sisters, and while he dearly loved Maddie, sister Eve had turned out to be a psycho-killer. Henry was not sure just how much more worry, sorrow, and heartache he wanted to endure. \n\n\nBob talked about how amazing it was to hold your own child, but he did not convince Henry. Bob got a call from Kim, who said she was trying to find a room in the hospital in which to tape a childbirth class with Brad and Katie, plus Vienna. Bob suggested a room number, and Kim said she appreciated it. Bob then spilled the beans about the class to Henry, and Henry made a beeline for the door. \n\n\nLily was happy that Noah was staying with them a few days while he recuperated from his injuries. Holden considered taking the boys to a Cubs game in Chicago, but it worried Lily that Holden might be trying to compete with Damian for \"father of the year\" honors. Holden said it was just a baseball game, and he invited Lily, as well. Lily declared that she had a day of foundation work ahead of her, and she left for the office. \n\n\nLuke was happy to take care of Noah for a change, and the boys talked about soon having a place of their own. Holden interrupted them to see if they were interested in the Cubs game, and the boys were excited. Holden went inside to arrange for tickets, and Noah commented that Luke had two really great dads. Unfortunately, Holden soon reported, the Cubs game was an away one with the Mets, but he thought if he could get Lucinda's jet, they could fly to New York and be there by the first inning. \n\n\nLily found Damian already at work at the foundation. He was going through paperwork, trying to learn all he could about their work. He mentioned that a friend of his, Antoine Ladell, also had a charitable foundation that served disabled children, and he thought his friend might want to join forces with Luke. Damian had taken the liberty of contacting Ladell already, and his friend happened to be in New York at the moment, so Damian had booked a flight for himself to New York. \n\n\nLily wished him good luck, and Damian asked her to accompany him. She thought that was not a good idea until Damian explained that Lily knew so much more about the workings of the foundation than he did, and besides, she could be very persuasive because she spoke from her heart. Lily finally agreed, and the two of them left for the airport. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Kim's crew began taping the class. The facilitator interviewed Vienna and Katie, who immediately got into an argument about the use of drugs during childbirth. Brad got the two of them back on track, and the instructor had Vienna lie on the floor, and she began relaxation exercises. Then she had Brad and Katie lie beside Vienna and practice breathing. \n\n\nVienna's phone rang, so she momentarily excused herself to speak with Henry. He chastised her for doing the class without him, but Vienna came right back at him for forgetting whose baby it was supposed to be. Then she hung up on Henry and went back to the class. \n\n\nLily and Damian finished their meeting, and both were pleased at the outcome. Lily did remark to Damian, however, that she had gotten the feeling that Monsieur Ladell was in Damian's debt. Damian said he had thrown a few business deals Ladell's way, and he asked Lily to trust him. \n\n\nKatie gave Vienna a neck rub, and then the instructor put Vienna back on the floor and stationed Katie at her head. Katie's job was to make sure that Vienna breathed properly. She put Brad between Vienna's legs and instructed him to give verbal encouragement. Katie was not sure she wanted her husband in that position for the actual birth, and that made Vienna laugh at the \"prudish Americans.\" The teacher referred to what Brad was looking at as Vienna's \"gateway,\" so Brad agreed to \"hang out\" by Vienna's \"gateway to parenthood.\" \n\n\nVienna began her panting exercise, and Katie counted her breaths. Brad, whose only previous shouted encouragements had to do with athletic events, began his routine by shouting like a sports announcer at a hockey game. In the midst of this chaos, Henry walked in and yelled at Brad to knock it off. Brad defended himself by claiming he was just tending Vienna's gateway, and that further irritated Henry. \n\n\nKatie jumped up and hustled Henry outside for a chat. She told him he was acting completely insane and jealous, which was why she had not wanted him there in the first place. Henry went off on how much trouble children were, so Katie shouted that she and Brad were going to raise the baby, not Henry. \n\n\nKatie reminded her friend that he would be their baby's godfather, and after some thought, Henry agreed that was for the best. The two of them returned to the classroom, where Katie handed Henry a crying BotBaby to hold. The doll was lifelike and responded by crying, wetting, gurgling, and even sleeping. Henry got the baby to stop crying, and he appeared transfixed by the doll. The others joined in a lively conversation until suddenly they realized that Henry and his simulated baby were gone. \n\n\nHolden and the boys enjoyed walking around New York after the game. The boys then went off on their own, and they agreed to meet at a favorite restaurant later. By coincidence, Lily and Damian likewise had some time to kill before their flight home, and Lily recommended the same restaurant to Damian. \n\n\nHolden arrived at the restaurant first and chose an outside table. He called Lily, who said she had been about to call him. Eventually they realized that they were sitting back to back outside the same restaurant. Holden explained how he happened to be there, and Lily said she had attended an impromptu business meeting. \n\n\nHolden began remembering a previous time when he and Lily had been there, and that occasion had ended in a very romantic interlude. He suggested that he and Lily revisit that time, just as Damian walked up and burst Holden's bubble. Damian declared it all an amazing coincidence, and when he learned that Luke and Noah would be joining them, he went to arrange for a larger table. He then returned and took charge of ordering a special wine for Lily. Holden opted for a draught beer. \n\n\nLuke and Noah strolled around New York, and Noah was struck by the city's energy. He asked Luke if he wanted to move there to start their own lives together, but Luke said he could not picture himself there without his family. He did say, however, that perhaps in ten years it could be possible. Noah asked if that was a proposal, and Luke laughed that suddenly Noah was the spontaneous one, and Luke was \"Captain Cautious.\" \n\n\nAt the restaurant, the boys were shocked to see Damian, and Luke expressed some negative attitudes. He asked Holden if he was okay with Damian's being there, so Holden called it a coincidence and told Luke to let it go. Lily explained that Monsieur Ladell's influence on the foundation would expand their range tremendously. Luke was thrilled and apologized to and thanked Damian. Holden invited Damian and Lily to join them on Lucinda's jet for the trip home, but Damian declined. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Kim told Bob that the taping of the childbirth class had been a disaster. She also said that Henry had disappeared with the BotBaby. They also discussed Henry's weird attitude towards fatherhood, in general. \n\n\nVienna went back to the hotel and walked in on Henry, who was cuddling the BotBaby. He cautioned her to be quiet and said it had taken three verses of \"Luck be a Lady\" to get the little blighter to sleep. He flatly refused to relinquish the baby to her, but she eventually talked him into it. \n\n\nBrad and Katie wandered around Old Town, looking for Henry. Katie was afraid Henry was suffering a nervous breakdown. Suddenly she noticed a poster for a standup comic who was appearing in town, and he looked very familiar. She showed the poster to Brad, who agreed with her that it was a picture of the strange \"Dr. Shmedlitz\" who had given them the happy news that Vienna's baby was healthy and perfect. \n\n\nAt the airport, Luke thanked Holden for a wonderful day. He also said that he really wanted to believe that Damian meant well, but he was still keeping up his guard. Lily also spoke privately with Holden and reassured him that he had absolutely nothing to worry about in regards to her and Damian. \n\n\nDamian placed a call to someone and said that his flight had been delayed. He explained that he was still in New York, and that his involvement in their \"enterprise\" could never come to light. He needed to keep his own business private. \n\n\nKatie and Brad took the poster to Dr. Bob and asked if the stand-up comic was also a doctor on the staff of Memorial. Bob said he wished he were, because they could use a few laughs around there. He had never heard of Dr. Shmeglitz, and Katie realized that something was very wrong. \n\n\nHenry told Vienna that there was no way that Brad and Katie could have their baby. He sank to his knees and embraced her belly.\n\n\n",
