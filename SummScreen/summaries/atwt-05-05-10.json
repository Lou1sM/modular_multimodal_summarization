When Casey asked about Henry, she said, \"Who?\"  Vienna invited Casey back to her room at the Lakeview, and they tumbled onto the bed.  She tossed off a book she'd been reading called How to Conceive a Child, as Casey stopped her to ask if she had a condom.  Vienna claimed she was \"on the pill,\" and she further attested that she had been recently tested for STDs.  Casey said he had too, so Vienna pronounced them \"good to go.\"\n\n\nNot long afterwards, Casey lay next to Vienna, and she asked him if he had any dark secrets, such as diseases or insanity.  Casey looked at her and answered, \"I'm a Hughes.  We invented \"normal.\"  He was a bit put off by Vienna's post-coital disinterest after she had gotten what she wanted, but then Casey said that it didn't bother him at all if Vienna needed to \"use\" him to forget Henry.  Vienna smiled and said Casey had been the perfect person for her to run into.  He kissed her on the cheek, they thanked each other, and Casey left.  Vienna picked up her book, propped her heels on the headboard, and said, \"Swim, boys!  Swim for my Henry!\"\n\n\nAt the farm, Molly was trying a recipe from Cooking with Love, a new cookbook, when the phone rang.  She answered by saying, \"Hell's Kitchen!\" and that made Holden laugh on the other end of the line.  Molly told him that she had an amazing meal sizzling on the stove, and they would also have the whole house to themselves that night.  Holden said he would be later than he thought because he and Lily were heading to the hospital to support Luke while Noah was in surgery.  Molly was disappointed that Holden would be delayed, so she took off her apron, grabbed her purse, and took off.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Luke asked Dr. Oliver to tell him again what had happened with Noah.  Reid said there had been an unforeseen problem once he had gone inside Noah's skull, and he found more damage than he anticipated.  The doctor was prepared to give Luke more details, but Luke yelled at him to stop the \"doctor talk.\"  He shouted at Reid that he had been bragging for weeks that he was the only neurosurgeon who could restore Noah's sight, and yet there were complications.  Oliver called Luke \"Mr. Snyder,\" and he cited the risk for problems with such an operation.\n\n\nLuke raised his voice again and ordered the doctor to talk to him like a human being and to \"cut the crap.\" Lily and Holden walked by then, and Holden grabbed Luke and pulled him out of Dr. Oliver's face.  \"What have you done?\" shouted Luke.  The doctor left, and Luke's parents tried to calm him.  Molly walked in, as well, and Holden told her that Noah was in the ICU with complications.  Luke excused himself to go get some air, as Molly hugged Holden, and Lily watched.\n\n\nLuke returned and apologized to his folks for losing control.  He promised he would not challenge Dr. Oliver any more, and he asked them all to go home.  Lily said she would honor his wishes and go home, so Holden walked her out and said he was uneasy sending her home alone with Craig on a rampage about Gabriel.  Lily was not afraid, and she left the hospital.  Holden returned to Molly, and they headed to the farm.\n\n\nReid Oliver looked at Noah's brain scans and asked out loud why he had not seen something that was obvious to him after the surgery.  Dr. Bob walked in and suggested that the doctor not second-guess himself.  Bob said he knew Reid, and what had happened was not his fault.  Bob told Reid to go home and rest, but the surgeon fought it.  Finally Bob the administrator had to order him to leave.\n\n\nLuke found Bob in the hospital and asked if there had been any change in Noah's condition, but Bob explained that it would take a great deal of time before they knew if there was any brain damage.  He told Luke not to question what he and Noah had wanted, but Luke said that he had trusted Dr. Oliver's judgment implicitly.\n\n\nMolly served Holden his dinner, and he approved of the new recipe.  He was very distracted, however, and he didn't eat much.  He was upset that he couldn't \"fix things\" for people he cared about, however Molly said she had just the thing.  She began to give Holden a neck massage, and she blew out the dinner candles.  The two of them hugged as Holden's phone rang, and the caller was Lily.  She said she was frightened because she had arrived home to find her front door standing open, and no lights on in the house. She was calling from outside the house, so Holden told her to wait in her car, and he would be right there.\n\n\nHolden drove to Lily's house and turned on the lights in the house.  Nothing appeared amiss, but Natalie's lacrosse stick and backpack were on the living room couch.  Holden realized that their daughter had rushed in and dumped her stuff and then rushed out to her piano lesson.  She probably had forgotten to shut the door well, but Holden told Lily she had done the right thing in calling him.  The two of them hugged, while at the Snyder farm, a lonely Molly relit the candles on the dinner table and began drinking wine.\n\n\nReid Oliver had heeded Dr. Hughes's advice and gone home to Katie's.  He was getting dressed after a long shower when Luke rang the doorbell.  Luke barged in and asked how Reid could have left Noah alone at the hospital.  He assumed that the doctor did not care if his patients lived or died, but then Dr. Oliver said that Luke didn't know when to stop.  Luke blustered on and wanted to know if Reid had done something to Noah on purpose.  The doctor could not believe that Luke was accusing him, but Luke yelled that Oliver could not stand it that Luke still had feelings for Noah, even thought the two were no longer a couple.\n\n\nThey argued loudly until Reid yelled at Luke to \"shut the hell up.\"  The doctor was hurt that Luke had such a wrong opinion of him.  Finally Luke admitted that he had no idea what he thought about Reid because he didn't really know him.  Luke was tearful as he thought about losing Noah, but Reid moved closer, and suddenly the two were locked in a passionate kiss, which soon became many kisses.\n\n\nA gloomy Henry watched Barbara flirt with her airline pilot in the Lakeview lobby.  The captain said he loved to dance and wanted to try out a new dance club in town, and he asked if Barbara was interested.  She agreed and then excused herself to go to the ladies' room while the pilot settled the bill.  The moment Barbara left the room, Henry scooted into her empty chair and warned the captain that Barbara was \"a very dangerous woman on the dance floor.\"  He said she tended to make scenes, but the pilot was not buying it.  He called Henry \"Paul,\" and he asked how he could do something like that to his mother.\n\n\nBarbara returned and saw Henry sitting with her date, as Henry said that he was not the man the captain thought he was.  The pilot still thought that Henry was Paul, and he said that Barbara had told him how Paul had tried to get between her and her ex-boyfriend, Henry.  Barbara walked up and told Henry to scram, but she did not call him by name.  Henry went off on a tirade against the pilot, who was horrified that Barbara's son appeared to feel romantic about her.  He put the money for drinks on the table and called both of them \"sick.\"  He walked out as Barbara poured a glass of ice cubes over Henry's head.\n\n\nHenry mopped his brow as Barbara asked him how low he could go.  She accused him of planning a wedding and a baby with Vienna, while at the same time scaring off a very nice pilot who had expressed an interest in her.  Henry declared that he was neither marrying nor having a child with Vienna.  He said those ideas were \"on hold.\" Barbara didn't think much of Henry's stringing along both women again, and she said she had too much to think of, not the least of which was an impending appointment with her cancer specialist.\n\n\n Henry questioned Barbara about her appointment, and when he saw how anxious she was, he offered to accompany her.    Barbara was still angry that Henry had ruined her chance to have dinner and go dancing with a nice man, but Henry promised he would make it up to her.  He escorted her to Metro where Barbara spotted a poster proclaiming it was the night of a Disco Dance Contest. She told Henry that he was out of his mind, but just then the first couple in the competition took the floor.\n\n\nBarbara knew the dancers and said they were really good -- and young.  She was afraid that she and Henry would not measure up, especially after the couple scored 28 out of 30 points. Henry and Barbara went next, and the two performed some tricky moves, including spins and lifts.  They scored exactly the same, so the judges said there would be a dance-off.  Barbara and the other woman finalist went to powder their noses, and when they returned, the younger woman was limping badly.  She grumbled to her partner that she hadn't seen a \"Wet Floor\" sign in the ladies' room and had slipped and twisted her ankle badly. Henry gave Barbara a wink and a nudge as the other couple withdrew from the contest.\n\n\n Barbara and Henry had a close moment until his phone rang. His caller was Vienna who said she really needed him, so Henry agreed to go to her.  He thanked Barbara and called her \"incredible.\"  Back in her hotel room, Barbara twirled with her very large dance trophy, and then she put it in front of her mirror and smiled.\n\n\nVienna knew that Henry was on his way, so she pinched herself to bring tears to her eyes.  When Henry knocked on the door, she said how sorry she was for even thinking of tricking him into getting her pregnant so that he would have to marry her.  Vienna said she loved Henry very much, and he could take all the time he needed to make up his mind.  She removed her engagement ring, handed it to him, and said that she could wait until he put it on her finger again forever. \n\n\n",

When she goes to the little girl's room, Henry quickly slips into her chair and tells Joe that going dancing with that woman is a very bad idea. Barbara catches him, and Captain Joe mistakes him for her son and takes off. Henry says she can thank him later. She pours a drink over his head. Later he tells her that he is not marrying Vienna nor having a baby with her .that idea is on hold. He offers to support her by going with her to her cancer checkup. He is sorry he ruined her evening and would like to make it up to her by giving her that evening of dancing she wanted. Vienna comes on to Casey and tells her this is what she really wants. She shoves him back on the bed and has her way with him. She lies and says she is on the pill and has been tested recently so is good to go. Afterwards she can not wait to get him out of her bed. Molly cooks a special meal for Holden and tells him that Emma will be away and they will be all alone. Holden has to disappoint her by saying that he's going with Lily to check on Noah. He asks her to keep the dinner warm. She yanks the apron off and is out the door. Luke questions Reid about Noah's complications. Dr. Oliver explains there was far more damage than he originally thought once he got inside Noah's brain. Luke lambastes him for not knowing the risks when he originally bragged that he was the only doctor who could fix Noah. Holden and Lily try to convince Luke to settle down and give them a chance to see if Noah is okay. Molly shows up. Luke gives them a hug and says they can go since it will be hours yet. Holden does like Lily being alone, but she convinces him that Craig won't hurt her and she will be all right. Bob speaks with Dr. Oliver and tells him he understood it was brilliant surgery. He should not be second-guessing himself now. He advises no he demands that he go home, get a bite to eat and take a long nap as Noah won't be awake for some while yet. Luke shows up at Reid's apartment and blasts him for leaving and not caring if his patient dies .even wants to know if he did this on purpose. He accuses Reid of having feelings for him and can't stand the thought that Noah might be preventing them getting together. Reid is hurt that Luke would think that. Reid tries to get Luke to talk him through this and they end up kissing. Molly plies Holden with her meal and then gives him a neck massage. Vienna is glad she ran into Casey and that he is not upset that she used him just for sex \u0096 works for him too. At her utter disgust, Henry takes Barbara to Metro and enters them into a disco contest. He says she would not believe what he can do on the dance floor. They win by default. Vienna calls and apologizes and wants Henry to come home right now so she can make things right. She cries and apologizes again that she was wrong in trying to get herself pregnant so he would marry her. She now wants him to take whatever time he needs. Molly and Holden put their meal plan on hold and start to head to the bedroom. Lily calls and tells him that she came home and found the door open. She is afraid someone might have broken in. He tells her that she should stay outside and he will meet her outside. Second time in one night, Molly is disappointed. She spends a lonely night alone drinking and Barbara dances alone with her trophy. Holden goes in the house with Lily and they find it was a total false alarm. It was probably one of the kids. He's glad she called him and they hug.",
