Carly tells Rosanna that she would burn Craig's clothes if he had put her in the same position. Later, while Rosanna's trying to strike a match to a pile of Craig's suits and ties, he offers her a light. John shows Bob evidence that it was not his fault that the patient died. Bob still doesn't understand how he overdosed the man. Evelyn told Jack that if he didn't bring in Henry for questioning, he would be off of the case. Jack informed Katie to warn Henry to get out of town. After Rose told Mitzi that she didn't want the shop, Dusty called to have her come to the shop to discuss business.
