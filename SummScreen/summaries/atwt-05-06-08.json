Casey told his dad that Margo had basically called him a thief and a liar. Casey insisted he hadn't stolen any of the manuscripts from Oakdale University, but Margo didn't believe him. \n\n\nTom asked for background on what was going on, and Casey told them he had found out about the stolen manuscripts from Emily. Margo thought Emily had tried to use Casey to get a story, but Casey said he had volunteered to help, since the story involved the university. Margo then questioned whether Casey had set the whole thing up to score points with Emily. Casey told Margo to go ahead and arrest him and accused her of having been waiting for him to screw up ever since he had gotten out of prison. Tom said they were simply trying to understand how a manuscript Casey had never seen had ended up in their house inside Casey's backpack. Casey said someone had to be setting him up to try to send him back to jail. \n\n\nCasey told his parents he was going to go find out what was going on. He went to Java, where he found Elwood and accused him of having planted the manuscript. Elwood told Casey to leave before he called the manager over and had Casey kicked out. Casey went to see Emily and filled her in on what was going on. He said if he couldn't prove Elwood was trying to set him up, he might be back behind bars by the following week. \n\n\nEmily told Casey she had paid an informant to let her know when somebody tried to sell any of the stolen manuscripts. The informant called and said someone had contacted a rare bookstore, asking if they'd be interested in some Civil War manuscripts. Emily and Casey headed to the store to follow the lead. Casey went inside and pretended to the clerk that he was the person who had called about the manuscripts. However, Tom and Margo arrived, and Margo overheard what Casey was saying and told him she had to arrest him. \n\n\nJust then, Casey spotted Elwood outside the bookstore; Casey rushed out and tackled Elwood. When Tom and Margo went out, they saw that Elwood had the other stolen manuscripts in his backpack. Margo had Elwood arrested. She then apologized to Casey for having doubted him. Casey shook his head and walked away, followed a moment later by Emily. \n\n\nAlison dressed up for her dinner date with Chris and went to the hospital to meet him. Chris was surprised because Alison had indicated she wanted to keep their relationship discreet at work. Alison told Chris she'd changed her mind and didn't care what the people at work thought. \n\n\nAlison told Chris they weren't doing anything wrong, so she wasn't going to hide their relationship. Chris leaned in to kiss her, but Alison stopped him, saying there was a catch. She said she wanted flowers, candy, and love notes; in other words, she wanted romance. They left the hospital and walked through Old Town, where Alison told Chris she liked how she felt when she was with him. Chris said he wouldn't rush things; Alison said they didn't need to take things too slowly, and she kissed him. \n\n\nChris and Alison went to the restaurant for dinner. Alison reminisced about the time she had tried to \"buy\" Chris at a bachelor auction. That evening had ended up being their first night together and the night Alison had lost her virginity. She described the events that had led up to it, and Chris became flustered. While placing his order for dinner, Chris became even more distracted by Alison's flirtations. Alison told Chris she wanted to skip dinner and just have \"dessert\" upstairs. They left the restaurant and went into the elevator, where they kissed. \n\n\nUpstairs, Chris and Alison lay on the bed, with Alison in only her underwear. Chris kissed each of her body parts, naming them as part of his \"anatomy lesson.\" However, as they began to make love, Alison suddenly stopped Chris, saying she couldn't do that. Alison apologized to Chris, who nicely told her he didn't want to do anything she wasn't ready for. Chris asked Alison to just lay down with him and let him hold her, and she did. However, Alison got up and got dressed, telling Chris she couldn't stay and apologizing again before she left. \n\n\nAt Lucinda's cottage, Noah showed Ameera how to make pancakes and told her he had learned to cook while growing up on Army bases. Luke arrived at the door and apologized to Noah for the things he'd said when he had decided he couldn't live with him. Luke said Noah was worth waiting for because what they had was real. Noah apologized, too, and said there was no one he wanted in his life every day as much as Luke. They embraced as Ameera entered the living room. \n\n\nAmeera's cell phone rang, and she went outside to take the call. Noah invited Luke to sit on the couch next to him, and they cuddled until Ameera returned, obviously upset about something. Ameera told them the phone call had been from the warden at the state prison, who had said Noah's dad wanted to see her. Noah said if anyone was going to go see his father, it would be him and that he would go alone. Luke and Ameera objected, but Noah insisted. \n\n\nLuke asked how Colonel Mayer would even have known Ameera was living there, and Noah said he had called ahead and given the warden all of their names the last time they had tried to go up to the prison. Noah said even though his father had asked to see Ameera, whatever it was he had wanted to tell her, he could say to Noah instead. Luke told Noah he would stay with Ameera while Noah was gone. Noah promised Luke he wouldn't let his father get to him, and the two embraced before Noah left. \n\n\nAt the prison, Colonel Mayer was surprised to see Noah instead of Ameera. Noah warned his father to leave Ameera alone. Colonel Mayer was confused and asked why Noah even cared what happened to Ameera. Noah said, \"Because she's my wife,\" and showed his father his wedding ring. The colonel was pleased to hear about the marriage and told Noah he wanted to try to rebuild their relationship. Noah said that wasn't going to work because his father had never been able to really see him for who he was. When his father asked him if Ameera knew the truth and whether Ameera and Noah had a real marriage or a marriage in name only, Noah said he wasn't going to be baited by his father. \n\n\nThe colonel told Noah that unlike Noah, Ameera valued loyalty and appreciated everything the colonel had done for her and her mother. Noah asked about his own mother, whom his father had killed. Enraged, the colonel shouted that Noah's mother had been \"a liar and a whore,\" but Noah said, \"At least she wasn't a murderer!\" The colonel grabbed Noah, and the prison guard had to separate them. Colonel Mayer warned Noah not to mess things up for him. Noah yelled, \"Mess what up? What do you want with Ameera?\" but his father simply repeated that Noah should stay out of it and then asked the guard to take him back to his cell. \n\n\nNoah returned to Oakdale and found Luke and Ameera at the diner. He told them he had blurted out to his father that he and Ameera were married. Ameera asked if Noah thought his father would tell the immigration people, but Noah didn't think so. Luke thought Noah should be more curious about what his father wanted with Ameera, but Noah just wanted to forget all about it. Luke said with the marriage, Colonel Mayer had more ammunition than ever. Ameera said none of it would be happening if it weren't for her, and she got up and walked out of the diner, with Noah following. \n\n\nNoah returned to the diner alone and told Luke that Ameera just needed a few minutes alone. Noah said maybe his father was right, and Noah shouldn't worry about what Colonel Mayer wanted with Ameera. He told Luke that if he and Ameera both stayed away from Colonel Mayer, then Colonel Mayer would have nothing on them. \n\n\nOutside, Ameera called Colonel Mayer at the prison and asked why he had wanted to see her. Colonel Mayer told her he missed her and asked whether she missed him. Ameera said yes, and Colonel Mayer then asked if she was still his girl and whether he could still trust her. Ameera again answered, \"Yes.\" Colonel Mayer said, \"Good,\" and hung up. \n\n\n",
