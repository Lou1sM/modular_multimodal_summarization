Vienna accused her lover of being over-stressed, but Henry insisted that he had a strong desire to be a father to the child. Vienna was confused, and she reminded Henry that the baby belonged to Brad and Katie. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Brad and Katie looked at the comedy poster again. Dr. Bob had said that \"Dr. Shmedlitz\" was not on staff at Memorial, so Brad suggested they hunt down the comic, whose name was Sammy Litz. They found the \"doctor\" at Yo's, and Brad approached him. At first, Litz claimed he was only a comedian, but when Brad threatened that if he didn't come clean and give them some answers, there would be no stand-up for Sammy that night, Litz reconsidered. He finally said he only told them what the woman had paid him to say, and he did not know who the woman was. \n\n\nPaul was preparing to leave on his pretend business trip to Paris. Meg wanted to be sure that he didn't forget anything and have to come back. Paul tried once more to talk Meg into accompanying him, but she again used her feigned cold as an excuse. Paul flashed back to his fantasy of Meg and Dusty in her bed, and then he kissed the baby goodbye and left. Meg told Eliza that mommy had plans of her own that afternoon. \n\n\nMeg found Dusty and Johnny in the Lakeview lounge. Dusty complimented Meg on her appearance, as Paul lurked in the shadows. Johnny's sitter picked him up, so Meg joined Dusty at his table. She told him that Paul was in Paris and the baby was with Emma, and she asked to speak somewhere privately with Dusty. He suggested they go to his room, so Paul watched them enter the elevator, as he dashed for the stairs. \n\n\nIn Dusty's room, Meg hemmed and hawed about what she wanted to say. Dusty jumped in and told her the two of them belonged together. That gave Meg a moment of panic, so she grabbed her purse and ran out the door. She surprised Paul, who was forced to run around a corner, but Meg did get a glimpse of him. \n\n\nShe turned around and knocked on Dusty's door, and when he answered, she kissed him on the mouth and pushed him backwards into the room. Paul listened outside the door, as Meg kept kissing Dusty and also glancing at the door. Dusty was aware that Meg was up to something, and he demanded to know what she was doing. \n\n\nMeg explained that Paul was spying on them just outside, so Dusty jerked open the door. He saw no sign of Paul, however, so he returned to Meg and worried about what Paul would do if he thought she was sleeping with Dusty. Meg claimed that she had everything under control. Dusty was afraid for Meg, and he said he could not let her play her dangerous game any more. \n\n\nHenry reassured Vienna that it was not too late to have their little family, but a tearful Vienna told him that there was no way they could tell Brad and Katie that there had been an \"oops\" in the baby plans. Vienna felt that what Henry was suggesting was a form of kidnapping, and besides, their keeping the baby would break Katie's heart. Vienna could not do what Henry wanted, and she said they must keep their promise. Henry saw things differently, and he begged for a chance to make things right. Vienna said they must apologize to Brad and Katie for how Henry had acted at the childbirth class, and they would play the telling of the saga by ear. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to the hospital and talked with a nurse. Brad explained that they had done genetic testing on Vienna's baby, and they wanted to know the results. The nurse checked Vienna's chart and said the baby was perfectly fine. Katie was greatly relieved, but she noticed that the nurse's expression had changed to one more serious as she read further in the chart. Katie asked her about it, but the nurse said she would get Dr. Bob to explain everything. Katie would not let her leave, so the nurse took them into a private room, and Brad, as the baby's father, insisted on seeing the chart. \n\n\nThe nurse made a hasty exit, but not before Katie grabbed the chart from her arms. Katie jumped to the conclusion that the lab had mixed up the donor sperm and thought perhaps that Brad was not the true father of the baby. As they read the chart, Katie was stunned to read that the artificial insemination with Brad's \"boys\" had failed. Brad then asked how Vienna could be pregnant, and a shocked Katie figured it out. \n\n\nDusty told Meg that if Paul had seen her in Dusty's room, he would make her pay. Dusty asked for details, so Meg explained that Paul wanted her to think he was out of the country, but she knew he was watching her every move. She, however, was only letting him see what she wanted him to see. Her goal was to push Paul's jealousy over the edge so that she could get proof of his instability and regain custody of the baby. Dusty thought the plan was too dangerous, but Meg said it was not up to him to decide, and she stormed out. \n\n\nBrad and Katie, still stunned, went home, and before long, Henry and Vienna arrived. Henry had the BotBaby in hand, and he apologized for his actions at the class. Katie was in tears, and she said that they should never have trusted their best friends. Brad declared that Vienna was having Henry's baby, not his, and Katie took one look at Vienna's face, and she knew that it was true. Katie said she felt something was wrong, but she could not believe that someone she considered as close as family could betray her like that. \n\n\nBrad talked about all of Henry and Vienna's subterfuges, and Vienna attempted to explain that she could not bear to cause Katie such devastation. Henry asked them to cut Vienna some slack and to blame him for his change of heart. Vienna said they were still giving the baby to Brad and Katie to raise, but Henry challenged that. Both Brad and Katie asked Henry if he was willing to give up the child, but Henry did not answer. \n\n\nKatie said they would never take the baby under the present circumstances, because it would never be truly theirs. Katie said it was too late, and they did not want the baby, nor did they want Vienna and Henry in their lives any more. \n\n\nHenry begged Katie to reconsider, and he told her how much he and Vienna both loved her. Henry took all the blame on his shoulders, but Katie said he had just broken their hearts. Brad asked them to pack their belongings and leave. \n\n\nPaul drank in the Lakeview bar and thought about Meg. He fantasized again about his ex-wife and Dusty, and ordered another shot. Dusty approached Paul and claimed that things were not as they appeared. Paul did not believe that Dusty would rat out Meg if she was scheming, but Dusty said he would do what was necessary to keep her safe. Dusty threatened Paul if he hurt Meg. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg surrounded herself with tissues and sat on the couch. She acted surprised to see Paul, who told her that he was aware of her plan to have him do something stupid and destructive, so he would be locked up again. Paul said Dusty had told him all about Meg's plans, and he ordered Meg to pack her things and get out. He added that she might want to say goodbye to Eliza, because Meg was never going to see the baby again. \n\n\nMeg was horrified and asked what she could do so that Paul would allow her to stay with her baby. Paul told her to beg. He said it was payback time for all the times Meg had humiliated him with Dusty. He demanded that Meg prove to him that she was sorry for playing with his head and that she deserved to be Eliza's mother. Paul said he needed to hear the right words, so Meg swore that nothing had occurred between her and Dusty. \n\n\nPaul asked what was next, and Meg begged some more. Paul made her promise that there would be no more games, and he left to check on the baby. A furious Meg grabbed her purse and dashed out. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna were leaving, but Brad stopped them at the door. Henry hoped for a last-minute reprieve, but instead Brad asked Henry to return the key to his house. Vienna called out to Katie, who was weeping on the couch, but Brad shut the door. \n\n\nMeg went to Dusty's room and lit into him for telling Paul about her plans. She was very angry, because she no longer had any hope of getting Eliza back; she was back to square one. Dusty told her she still had options about Eliza, but Meg said she could no longer trust him, and she walked out. \n\n\nVienna and Henry returned to their room in the Lakeview, and Vienna sobbed that they had lost their best friends. Henry was sad, but he declared that Katie would always be part of his life. He was relieved that they had removed a major obstacle to starting their own family. \n\n\nKatie cried on Brad's shoulder. He talked softly about other ways to be parents, but Katie did not want to hear them. The BotBaby began crying, and Katie's first impulse was to get rid of it immediately, but instead she cuddled it and grieved for the baby they had not even realized they had lost.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Henry is trying to convince Vienna to keep the baby, but she is adamant that they can't go back on their word with Brad and Katie. Henry has changed his mind about the baby, and he makes a compelling argument why they should keep their baby, but Vienna doesn't think they can do this to their friends; they made a promise to their best friends. Vienna wants them to talk with Brad and Katie, but she wants to start with an apology for his behavior with the baby from the hospital. She wants them to look into their eyes and make a decision after they see their reactions. Katie and Brad wonder why the obstetrician that gave them news about their baby would be doing stand up comedy so they track him down; he admits that he was paid off by a woman. Brad and Katie got to the hospital to look at their medical files and the nurse tells them that Brad is not the baby's father. Brad and Katie assume there was a mistake at the hospital, but then they see in the file that the insemination didn't take and the unfortunate and devastating truth starts to sink in.

Dusty knows something is going on with Meg's erratic behavior. She finally admits to what she is doing, but Dusty doesn't want to play games and goes outside to the hall but can't find Paul.

Vienna and Henry go to see Brad and Katie to apologize and find Katie crying. Katie tells them that they know the truth. Henry and Vienna try to explain, but a devastated Katie and Brad don't understand how they could lie to them about this - of all things. Vienna wants Katie to still have their baby, but Brad and Katie don't want any part of that and Henry doesn't look too happy about that either. Katie is distraught and tells them that not only doesn't she not want their baby, she doesn't want them in their lives anymore. Vienna and Henry plead with them to remember their friendship, but Brad and Katie don't want them around anymore. Later, Vienna and Henry are crushed over losing their best friends, but try to find comfort in their baby.
