Rose says she can't accept any of it because she has to prove to Paul that she cares for him more than Dusty.  Then, Dusty kisses her and she kisses him back.  She tells him that when she is near him, \"My brain just shuts off.\"  She tells him to stop because Paul could walk in at any time.  Dusty says he wants her to keep the shop and in turn he will agree to be her silent partner.  After Dusty leaves, Paul comes to see her, with flowers, and tells her he still loves her.  He says to get a breakdown of costs and he will cut Dusty a check. Rose says that Dusty already agreed to be a silent partner.

He says, \"Rose can barely keep her hands off me.

Jack says, \"I taste something strange, an ulterior motive.\"   Carly just asks Jack to wait to arrest Craig when he comes back to town.  Jack says that if Craig calls her, she should let him know and she agrees.  As they are talking, Craig calls and Carly lets Jack know.  Craig says he'll be back before the show.  Carly also thanks Jack for believing that she wasn't involved in the kidnapping.  Jack says a kidnapping would take a lot of phone calls and Emma would have known about them.  Also, Emma said Carly was at the farm at the time of the abduction.  Carly gets upset and tells Jack he doesn't trust her - he only trusts his spies.  Jack tells her that trust takes time.  \n\n\nCraig shows up at the gazebo to see Rosanna. She says she won't listen to anything he says unless he apologizes.  He does, by saying he is sorry that she deceived him.  Not impressed with his backhanded comment, Rosanna asks him to leave.  She says she never felt as alone as she did when he left her on their wedding night.  Craig says their marriage is fixable and they can get past it but she doesn't agree.  Later, Rosanna tells Lucy that Craig is home.  Aaron wants to leave but Lucy says no.  Craig walks in, hugs Lucy and asks why Aaron is there.  Lucy says she invited them and they are together.  Rosanna walks in and she and Craig argue.  She wonders if he had seen any other women when he was away but Craig says he didn't.  Just then, Sierra walks in and greets everyone, then she thanks Rosanna for helping Lucy.  Rosanna asks how she knew about it and Sierra replies that Craig told her while he was visiting in Montega.  Rosanna says that he lied about seeing another woman.  Craig says, \"That's not a woman, that's my ex.\"\n\n\nChris tells Alison to get a job and says he will help her get one at the hospital.  He suggests being a nurse's aid, which is what Katie Frasier, is doing.  Alison agrees but when she tells her mother, she is surprised that Susan is against it.  Alison says her mother just doesn't want her around and it is all because of Rick.  Later, Rick tells Susan it would be good for Alison to work at the hospital because she'll get to know him better.  Alison is pleased when Susan tells her she can work at the hospital.  \n\n\nBonnie is sentenced to a fine, probation for one year, and 100 hours of community service at a shelter for abused kids.  She apologizes to Margo for lying about that night in Marshall's hotel room.  She says she wants to confess and at first Margo tells her to find a priest, not a cop but then she realizes that Bonnie just wants a friend.  Bonnie is still very upset about the shooting and doesn't feel that the punishment is harsh enough for her.  Margo's advice to her is, \"Don't just put time in, put in your backbone.\"  No matter what the task is, she tells her to give it her all every time.    \n\n\n",
