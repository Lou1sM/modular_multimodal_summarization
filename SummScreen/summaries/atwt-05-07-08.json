However, Liberty continued to lie to Katie and Brad about attending school and kept the charade going by getting dressed for her morning class. Before Katie and Brad could leave for work, Katie found the expensive sunglasses Liberty had purchased in town with Parker. Brad was worried that Liberty was shoplifting again and wanted to know how she had gotten the money to buy the glasses. Liberty lied and said she had borrowed them from a girl at school, and Brad believed her and was relieved to hear that Liberty was making friends. Liberty left the hotel room, telling Brad and Katie she was going to school. \n\n\nJack arrived at Carly's house to help out with the kids and found Parker and Sage getting ready for school. When Jack stumbled upon Parker's new video game, he questioned where Parker had gotten the game. Sage blurted out that Parker had bought it with his own money, and Jack demanded to know where Parker had gotten the money for such an expensive game. After Sage left for school, Parker finally admitted that Liberty had given him the money. \n\n\nJack immediately took Parker to talk with Katie and Brad and tell them about Liberty's adventures since her arrival in Oakdale. Brad and Katie figured out that Liberty had lied about being bullied and where the sunglasses were from. After a call to the school, Brad learned that Liberty had been skipping school ever since they had registered her for classes. Parker told Brad and Katie where to find Liberty, and they immediately went to get her. \n\n\nBrad and Katie found Liberty in Old Town and confronted her about all of her dishonesty. Liberty admitted she hadn't been to school, but said she would start going if they got her a room at the Lakeview. Katie was reluctant to cave in to Liberty's demands, but Brad agreed it would be worth it if Liberty would go to school and stay out of trouble. Brad then insisted on taking Liberty directly to school. \n\n\nAt the television station, Brad and Katie continued to discuss Liberty having her own hotel room. Katie thought it was unwise to give such a deceitful girl access to so much freedom, but Brad wanted Liberty to know he trusted her. Katie believed that Liberty was lying about more than they knew, but Brad insisted that Liberty would straighten out. Katie and Brad decided to call Liberty's mom and let her know that Brad was Liberty's father and about her recent troubles in school. Brad left Janet a message. Katie insisted it was odd that they were never able to reach Janet, but Brad explained it was typical of the undependable girl he had known in high school. \n\n\nMeg ran into Mike at the Lakeview and he invited her to join him for breakfast. While Mike went to talk to Lisa, Meg waited for a table and saw Barbara. Meg asked how Barbara was responding to her chemotherapy, and Barbara said she was doing well. Barbara commented that she hoped Meg was there to meet Paul, but Meg explained that Paul had been arrested while trying to break into Mike's room to see her. \n\n\nBarbara begged Meg to give Paul another chance and reminded her that Paul loved her unconditionally. Meg said she couldn't see Paul anymore, and she had taken out a restraining order to make sure he left her alone. Meg went on to tell Barbara that there was no future for her and Paul. Barbara asked Meg to help Paul, but when Meg said she couldn't, Barbara said she would look after Paul and left to go see him at his home. \n\n\nMike joined Meg in the dining room for breakfast, and she told him about her talk with Barbara. Meg felt that she had been meant to see Paul and Sofie together so that she would finally learn she could never trust Paul again. Meg told Mike that she still wanted to help Paul, but she knew it wasn't her place anymore. Mike said the only thing she could do for Paul anymore was to drop the charges against him, and Meg agreed. Mike didn't want Paul going to jail because he was worried it would ruin Paul's reputation and that the farm project would be hurt. Mike urged Meg to keep the restraining order against Paul but said if it failed to keep Paul away, Mike would keep Meg safe. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul poured himself a morning cocktail and was greeted by Sofie, who had arrived at his home. She directly asked if he remembered making love to her. Paul apologized for not calling her after they had slept together and handed her a rose in an act of contrition. Paul told Sofie that he regretted their encounter and said it should never happen again. Sofie claimed she knew they were meant to be together, but Paul said he had only made love to her because he had been drunk and had felt bad after Meg had broken up with him. Sofie argued that they had always been attracted to one another and should focus on a future together. \n\n\nSophie began to undress in the hopes of seducing Paul, but she was interrupted when Barbara entered and demanded to know what was going on. Sofie rushed out of the room, and Barbara told Paul to end things with Sofie immediately. While talking to his mother, Paul received a call from his attorney, who insisted that Paul go to the station right away. \n\n\nSofie reentered the room, and Barbara told her to stay away from Paul. Barbara tried to convince Sofie that Paul still loved Meg, but Sofie adamantly demanded that she was the woman that could make Paul happy. Barbara thought that Sofie was making the same mistake with Paul that she had made with Cole and told Sofie to let Paul save himself. Sofie told Barbara she wouldn't give up on Paul and ran out. \n\n\nPaul arrived at the police station and learned from his attorney that the charges had been dropped. Paul's lawyer told him that Mike was responsible for his legal troubles being resolved, and Paul should thank Mike, since he was standing right behind Paul. Mike said he had kept Paul out of jail to protect the Snyder Farm project and that Paul needed to stay away from Meg, or he would answer to Mike. \n\n\nAs Paul signed the paperwork for the cops, Sofie arrived and asked Paul what was happening. He told Sofie the charges had been dismissed, and he needed to leave. Sofie chased after him and congratulated Paul. She wanted to go out and celebrate, but Paul told her he had nothing more to say to her. Sofie desperately tried to persuade Paul to spend time with her, but Paul told her to stay away from him for her own good. \n\n\nBarbara returned to the Lakeview and took Sofie to brunch. She told Sofie she would help with her jewelry line, and they could launch it at Metro's new opening. Barbara wanted Sofie to know that running a business would keep her busy, and Sofie understood that Barbara meant to keep her occupied with work and away from Paul. \n\n\nAt the farm, Parker told Jack he felt bad for telling on Liberty, but Jack insisted Parker had done the right thing. Meg arrived home, and she and Jack discussed Parker's recent troubles. Jack shared the news with Meg that Liberty was Brad's daughter and had her father's propensity for mischief. Meg explained to Jack that she still had a restraining order against Paul and didn't know what her future held, since she was sure that Paul was out of her life for good that time. Just then, Mike arrived and told Meg that she wouldn't have to worry about Paul anymore. Meg thanked Mike for helping with Paul, and he invited her to join him on the worksite. \n\n\nAs Mike and Meg walked around the farm, they found Paul sitting in the middle of one of the fields. Mike asked him what he was doing, and Paul insisted he had followed the restraining order and had not gone near the farm. He explained that Meg had walked up to him, and he thought that since she was there, he could talk to her about their relationship. Mike told her she didn't have to talk to Paul, but Paul said he would stay away from Meg if that were what she wanted and then told her goodbye. Meg watched sadly as Paul walked away. \n\n\n",
