He came up with the theory that if you saved one life, you could save the world. Noah was also excited to learn about summer camps that disadvantaged kids with life-threatening diseases could attend at no cost. Lily arrived home, and Noah explained his idea of the foundation's sponsoring a camp for these kids. Luke said he would like to tweak that idea and make it a cruise, instead of a camp experience. The boys agreed that would be even more fun. \n\n\nLuke asked Lily if the foundation could purchase a yacht, but his mother suggested that he ask Damian if the Grimaldi Shipping Line had any available ships. Luke said he felt weird asking Damian for even more help, so Lily offered to approach him on behalf of the foundation. She picked up her purse and headed for the Lakeview. \n\n\nAt the Intruder office, Lucinda handed some paperwork to Holden to deliver to Lily. She also wanted to speak with Holden about Damian. She was on Holden's side in wanting Damian to leave town as soon as possible. Holden told his mother-in-law that Lily was convinced that Damian had changed for the better, but Holden doubted that. \n\n\nHolden said Damian had taken Lily on a jaunt to New York, and that angered Lucinda. Holden said the trip actually had taken an advantageous turn for the foundation, however. He also said that Lily had asked him to give Damian another chance, and he felt that Lucinda should do the same, for Luke's sake. \n\n\nDusty and Lucy talked about Johnny for a while, and then the subject of Meg came up. Dusty said that he had done something stupid that he already regretted. He told Lucy that Meg had begun playing mind games with Paul, and Dusty had been fearful of what Paul would do when he found out. Dusty had gone and told Paul himself, and Meg's reaction to that impulsive act was to tell Dusty to go to hell. \n\n\nLucy told Dusty that Carly believed every word that Craig uttered, and she further said that Carly had asked for Lucy's help. Dusty had no qualms about seeing Craig punished, even if, for once, it was something he didn't do. He wanted Lucy to tell Carly that Lucy would do whatever she could to find evidence against Dusty, but in reality, she should do nothing. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Carly asked to see Craig, and Jack allowed it. She went into the interview room, and Craig said that his new lawyer was going to petition the judge to either charge him or release him. Carly said she thought she could probably get Jack to investigate Dusty, and Craig was pleased until she mentioned that she had talked with Lucy for help, as well. Craig insisted that Lucy stay out of it. Carly felt that they needed the girl's help, but Craig was not comfortable with Lucy's interaction with Dusty. They had to make sure that Lucy stayed on Dusty's good side. On her way out of the station, Carly suggested to Jack that he check out Dusty's possible involvement. \n\n\nLily visited Damian at the Lakeview, and she asked for the use of a ship for the foundation's project. She explained that Noah and Luke wanted to start a program similar to the camps for disadvantaged children, and they wanted to make it a cruise. Damian thought that was a wonderful idea, but he turned Lily down. He surprised her by saying that it was \"out of the question,\" because there were no ships available. Damian offered to talk to Luke himself, and Lucy puzzled over his refusal as she left. \n\n\nLily went to the Intruder office and spoke to Holden and Lucinda. She explained that she had requested a ship for the foundation from Damian, but that he had said there were none available. Holden thought that sounded suspicious, and he suggested that Lucinda ask some of her shipping buddies what was going on with the Grimaldi fleet. Lily was against that because she thought Damian would find out. Lucinda promised to be discreet and to just check out any rumblings in the shipping world. Lily still advised against it, and she walked out. \n\n\nAt Java, Noah and Luke discussed why no Grimaldi ships were available, and Damian walked in. He said he was sorry about the ships, but he had another way to help. He told the boys about a dude ranch in Montana that was set up for children with special needs. He had talked to the director and had told him that the foundation would pay for some children to attend the program. Luke and Noah loved the idea, and Luke agreed that Damian should make the arrangements. The boys thanked Damian profusely before he left. \n\n\nLucy visited her father at the police station, and the two of them discussed Johnny. Craig was sick that Dusty had gotten custody back, and he made Lucy promise that she would not let the boy forget him. Craig said he did not want to irritate Dusty because Dusty could take the boy away and disappear forever. Lucy was Craig's only connection to Johnny, and he could not risk losing that. He asked her to stay away from Dusty, if possible. \n\n\nJack called on Dusty at the hotel and asked him his whereabouts on April 24 between the hours of three and five o'clock. Dusty wanted to know why Jack was asking, and then he inquired if Jack was having trouble making his case against Craig. Jack gave no definitive answer, but he requested Dusty's alibi again before he left. \n\n\nCraig called Carly to tell her he had already spoken to Lucy about staying away from Dusty, and that was the same news that Lucy told Dusty when she reported back about the visit to her father. She was glad to be off the hook, but Dusty was upset that Jack seemed to be thinking that Dusty might be involved in some way. Lucy still felt guilty for the position Craig was in. Dusty decided he needed to create some evidence for the cops to find that would put Craig away forever. He swore he would never let anyone take Johnny away from him again. \n\n\nLily and Holden went home and argued about his attitude towards Damian. Holden felt he might have gone a bit overboard in his suspicions about the shipping line, so he agreed with Lily that he should call Lucinda and ask her to back off. He reached her on her cell phone at the dockyards where she told him something was going on with the Grimaldi fleet. Lily told her mother to get out of there, and Holden volunteered to go and get her immediately. Lucinda told Holden that it appeared from what she could see that Damian had lied about his ships. She asked him to call when he arrived at the docks, and she would reveal her exact location. \n\n\nDusty, along with Lucy, used his old set of keys and walked into a deserted Metro. He had a ledger he had created that exposed the gun smuggling and other activities by Fredo and implicated Craig. Dusty went behind the bar to plant the book when suddenly Carly walked in. \n\n\nDusty pretended he had just found the ledger, and he blamed Craig for running a second set of books for the Midnight Sun vodka business. Carly got right in Lucy's face and asked her if she thought her father had murdered someone. Lucy said she didn't know what to believe, but she looked miserable. Dusty was reluctant to hand over the ledger to Carly, so she suggested that Dusty call Jack. \n\n\nNoah and Luke returned home, excited to share the dude ranch idea with Lily. She was very pleased that Damian had come through for the boys, and she told them that Holden had gone to the docks to fetch Lucinda. Luke was not pleased that some of his family was not willing to give Damian the benefit of the doubt as Lily had. \n\n\nAt the docks, Lucinda pointed out three Grimaldi ships and said she had spoken to the captain of each. None of them would reveal their destination, and she was obviously not welcome on board. The two of them turned around and found themselves face-to-face with a big man holding a revolver pointed at them. \n\n\nJack arrived at Metro, and Dusty handed over the ledger. Jack thought it was just too convenient that incriminating evidence against Craig had magically appeared. He asked Dusty when he was going to stop telling Jack how to do his job. Jack accused him of falsifying records, and Lucy became close to hysterical and yelled at the men to stop. She said she was finally going to tell the truth. \n\n\nCarly spoke to Craig back at the police station, and he told her that his lawyer had been advised that the judge had declared that the Oakdale Police Department should not be penalized for doing a thorough investigation. Craid said his only hope was that there was no evidence tying him to the murder. Carly had to break the news about the ledger that Dusty had \"found\" in Metro. Carly asked if the records were Craig's. Craig got furious and shouted that Dusty had taken away his son and then solved the case that could put him away for life. \n\n\nCarly assured Craig that she didn't believe that the ledger was his, but she was afraid that Jack might. Craig thought it was obvious that Dusty had falsified the ledger, but Carly said he couldn't have done it alone. She explained that Lucy had been right by Dusty's side, and they wondered whose side Lucy was really on. Craig said Lucy would never betray him like that, so there had to be another explanation. \n\n\nThe stranger with the gun took Lucinda and Holden into an office and made a phone call to the \"boss.\" Holden tried to bluff his way out of the spot they were in, but their captor told them that their fate depended on the boss. The boss walked in, and it was Damian.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Noah has an idea about handicapped kids' camp. Luke expands on it and suggests a cruise. Lily even offers that Damian might loan them a yacht from his shipping business. Damian is delighted to help. But not with a ship, rather a dude ranch that can be made available. Holden speaks with Lucinda to try and get her to call off her dogs where Damian is concerned and accept him and his good intentions for Luke's sake. Holden follows Lucinda to the docks where she is snooping and they have a gun pulled on them. When they insist on seeing the boss, Damian shows up. Dusty tells Lucy that her father will beat these charges and he's concerned. He won't lose Johnny again. Perhaps he needs to create some evidence. She is shocked that he would falsify such evidence. Carly visits Craig in jail and tells him that she just saw Jack. She thinks she can talk him into investigating Dusty. He cautions her not to do anything that would set Donovan off. Carly finds Dusty and Lucy at a closed Metro. Dusty claims he found some hidden ledger under the bar and it is in code but proves that Craig was keeping separate books for his gun smuggling. They are taking it to the police. Jack is called and comes to Metro. He thinks this is very convenient that they found these just after his little talk with Dusty. Lucy is tired of the bickering back and forth between Jack and Dusty and says she is ready to tell the truth. Carly tells Craig and he is pleased that she doesn't believe this, but she says Jack might. And he won't believe that Lucy was in on planting the books.",
