Paul tells Jack that he feels Rose pulling away from him and he thinks that Dusty has something to do with that.  He makes Jack promise to let him know the minute that he gets some information on Dusty so he can make Rose see what kind of person he is.  Before Paul leaves, Jack gives him some advice.  He tells Paul to look past Dusty for any problems that he and Rose may have.  \n\n\nDusty shows up at Barbara's hotel suite all dressed up for the opening of The Roller Palace.  He tells Barbara that in a few hours her son will find out that Rose has the hots for him and it will be over between Paul and Rose.  He tells Barbara to write him a check because he doesn't want to ever see her again.  Barbara informs him that before he gets a check from her, it will have to be a done deal between Rose and Paul.  Dusty turns dark and says that Barbara had better be there for her son to pick up the pieces because he is going to fall apart when he finds out what his best friend and his fianc\u00e9 has been up to.  Dusty turns to leave and Barbara says, \"It will make him...\" Dusty turns and says, \"It will make him what?  A cruel, bitter failure like you?\"  Dusty turns and leaves the hotel suite.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Bob sees Chris and asks him to come into his office.  When they get inside, Bob closes the door and tells his son that he needs to apologize to him.  He says that yesterday Chris had suggested that he get a checkup and he was so upset about losing his patient that he bit his head off.  Chris says that all is forgotten.  Bob says that he is going to take his \"doctor son's\" advice and have that checkup.  Chris asks his father if there is anything else that is worrying him.  Bob says that he has been tired and it would be good just to check things out.  Chris gets a page and says that he has to go.  Chris starts to leave and asks his father if he will see him later at the staff meeting.  Bob says that he is the Chief of Staff so he probably will see him.  They both chuckle and Chris leaves his father's office.\n\n\nLater, Bob is standing in the hall writing out a patient's chart.  Katie sees Bob and walks up to him.  She reminds him that he has a staff meeting.  Bob looks up at her and says, \"What?\"  Katie says, \"You have a staff meeting scheduled right now and you are the Chief of Staff.\"  Bob keeps writing in the chart.  Katie asks again, \"Are you coming?\"  Bob, not looking up from his chart says, \"Sure.\"  Katie, looking very confused says, \"Ok, see you there.\"  She walks away looking bewildered.  After she is gone, Bob looks up and he looks confused.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Sierra has figured out what Craig is up by bringing her back to Oakdale.  She tells Lucy and Aaron that she will take them to the diner to get a milkshake and she asks them to wait for her in the car.  After the kids have left, Sierra tells Craig that she sees right through him and he intentionally brought her back to Oakdale to cause Rosanna pain.  Craig reminds his ex-wife that she did something behind his back.  Sierra says that all Rosanna did was support their daughter who is now walking and is more beautiful than ever.  Craig tells Sierra that he understands Rosanna and he will take care of her.  Sierra says that he doesn't begin to understand Rosanna or any woman for that matter.  She warns him that when Rosanna throws him out that he should not come running to her because he won't be welcomed.  Sierra walks out.  A short while later, Rosanna walks in with a bag packed.  Craig grabs her arm and tells her not to do this.  Rosanna says that she won't stand by and watch him run to his ex-wife whenever he feels like it.  Craig tells her that when he was gone, she slept with Mike Kasnoff.  She says that she did not sleep with Mike Kasnoff.  He asks her if she wanted to and she says that she did want to and she wanted to rub his face in it.  He asks, \"Why didn't you sleep with him?\"  She says that she still loves him.  Craig informs Rosanna that he brought Sierra back to Oakdale so she can take Lucy back to Montega.  Rosanna gets upset and asks Craig how can he do this.  He is making Lucy leave to serve his own purpose.  Craig says that he feels that they need time to work on their marriage.  Rosanna starts to cry and says that he is doing it for his own selfish needs.  She tells him that Lucy will hate him for what he is doing.  He says that he is doing it for his daughter's own good.  He adds that Sierra agrees with him.  Through her tears she asks, \"What kind of monster are you?\"  Rosanna adds that if this is his idea of getting their marriage off to a good start then they should just get an annulment right now.  Craig tells her that Sierra misses her daughter and this will give them time to get settled in their marriage.  Rosanna says that she doesn't know why she married him because he does not respect her intelligence.  She tells him that he only left town because he was going to get arrested for Barbara's kidnapping.  Craig laughs at her and says that he is not afraid of being arrested.   She asks him if he is aware of the police coming to the house and searching it.  She tells him not to worry because she searched the house before they did and she found his evidence.  He asks her what is she talking about.  She says that he was sloppy.  She found the information about the cottage in the woods in the false bottom of a drawer.  He says that it could have been some land that he was thinking about investing in.  Rosanna tells Craig that Carly had come to her for help with the fashion show.  Craig questions her about Carly.  Rosanna says that Carly depends on him and he wasn't around and she came to her for help.  Rosanna has a new realization.  She accuses Craig of coming back only for Carly.  Rosanna gets even more upset with Craig and tells him that the only way she will stay with him is if he gives up Monte Carlo.  Craig's response, \"WHAT!?\"\n\n\nAt the diner, Lucy asks her mother why she came to Oakdale, now.  Sierra says that she wanted to see her daughter walking and laughing and be so beautiful.  Lucy complains to her mother about Craig and the fact that he won't let her see Aaron.  Sierra says that fathers have difficulties watching their daughters grow up.  Sierra says that there is another reason she came to Oakdale.  Lucy shakes her head yes and says, \"You are going to take me back to Montega, aren't you?\"  Sierra tells her that she and Craig feels that maybe she should finish her high school year in Montega.  Aaron tells Sierra that he will promise to stay away from Lucy.  Lucy says, \"No, it isn't fair that my father is going to keep us apart.\"  Sierra is so moved to see that Aaron would sacrifice not seeing Lucy for a year that she tells the two that she will take care of Craig and she doesn't want to take them away from each other.  She adds that Aaron is good for Lucy.  She tells Lucy not to worry and to leave her father to her.\n\n\nLily stops over to help Rose get ready for her big opening of her beauty salon.  Rose is acting like a scatterbrain.  Lily bugs her until Rose tells her about the feelings that she is having for Dusty.  Lily tries to talk some sense into her sister.  She reminds her that Paul is a great guy and she could be messing up her life.  She tells her that she should not leave Paul hanging while she explores something with Dusty.  Rose is crying now and she says that Lily is right.  Lily hugs her sister and says that whatever she decides to do, she will stand by her.  Lily leaves and Rose gives Paul a call.  She tells him that she needs to see him before the opening tonight.  Paul tells her that he will be there.  Paul hangs up the phone and tells Jack that Rose wants to see him.  As Paul walks out, Jack yells out for him to concentrate on Rose and leave Dusty to him.  \n\n\nLater, Rose is walking around her house in her slip and trying to decide which lipstick to wear.  There is a knock at the door and she yells out, \"Paul you are early and I am still putting on my face.\"  The door opens and Dusty walks in.  He says, \"How could you improve on that face?\"  Rose twirls around and says that he has to leave.  She says that Paul is on his way over and she is not even dressed.  Dusty tells her that he thought tonight was their night.  Rose says that it can't be their night because she is engaged to Paul.  Dusty says that he knows that she is confused, but there is something going on between them.  Rose says that she is not confused.  She says that she has an attraction for him, but she is marrying Paul and she can't be kissing his best friend.  Dusty tells her that there is an attraction between them and he can't help it, he wants her.  Dusty moves in to kiss her.  Rose tries to hold him off.  She says that they can't do this because Paul is going to be there any minute.  Dusty won't give up and he kisses Rose.  Rose can't help herself and she kisses him back.  As the two are wrapped in each other's arms, Paul walks in the door.  When he sees what is going on, he yells, \"Hey, get your filthy hands off her or I'll kill you.!!\" \n\n\n",

Rose calls Paul to say that she needs to talk to him. When he arrives, she's in the middle of a lip lock with Dusty Donovan while she's barely dressed. After talking about the patient that Bob lost, Chris tells Bob that he needs to see a doctor about his forgetfulness. Later, Katie sees Bob in the hallway & questions why he isn't in the staff meeting. Bob is clueless about the meeting taking place. Katie baked Mike some lasagna and told him to freeze it so Molly won't eat it. Rosanna feels betrayed because Craig brought Sierra home from Montega. Craig wants Lucy to go to Montega to get her away from Aaron. In a last ditch effort, Rosanna tells Craig to either walk away from Monte Carlo or they're through!! At Al's, Sierra tells Lucy and Aaron that she's going to deal with Craig. She thanks Aaron for helping Lucy walk again.",
