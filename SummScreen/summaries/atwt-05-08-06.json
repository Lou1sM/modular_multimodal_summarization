    "tvmega_recap": "Katie and Mike are pronounced husband and wife, but before they can even make it back up the aisle, Jack is forced to arrest Mike. Margo is upset and confused; Nick thinks Jack has a personal vendetta against him; Mike and Katie are overwhelmed. The reception is then canceled while Mike accompanies Jack to the station. He explains they have a cabbie that can prove Maya was dropped off at Mike's house 1 month after he claimed to have last seen her. She admitted that after that stop she was going to be rich, and the man that opened the door at his house was dark haired. Mike can't explain it, but he is even more dumbfounded when Jack tells him the necklace that was buried with the body had his DNA on it. Katie is supposed to go home with Carly, but decides she can't leave Mike's side and rushes off to be with him. Carly tries to stop her, but Nick interferes and tells her to let her go to her husband. Hal tells Paul that Emily is pregnant, and then they are forced to tell Susan, who doesn't take it well. Paul is sure it is either a mistake or not his. Emily has been unstable for a long time and he doesn't know what she is capable of anymore. Susan tells him based on the hormone level, she is around three weeks pregnant. Paul realizes he is the father, but Susan is unimpressed and still wants him out of Emily's life so he can't ruin her life or her unborn baby's life. Paul is undeterred; he and Emily need to talk to work this out. Emily overhears Paul is still out in the hall, and goes outside to see them fighting about a problem. What is going on, she demands? Barbara tries to befriend Meg, but she also warns that Emily will stop at nothing to get Paul back. Meg vows that she will not let him get hurt; she will stop anyone who tries to do that. Hal sees Barbara and after exchanging unpleasantries this time, he tells her that they need to talk. Jade kisses Holden and Luke walks in and blows up at her. Later, he slowly starts to admit to him that everything with Jade was a lie, which appears to ring true with Holden, who is probably realizing his worst fears about his son are in fact true. When Lily comes in, Luke works up his courage to tell them the truth; he is gay!",
