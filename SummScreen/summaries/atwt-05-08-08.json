Jack's intended good deed fell flat because Holden had helped Carly get ready for opening. Lily apologized to the girls for disappointing them and asked about Holden -- and was told he was helping Carly. Faith urged Lily to let her and Natalie dress Lily up for a fairytale reunion with Holden. As Holden told Jack he honored Carly's friendship, Carly greeted Barbara and Sofie, who had just arrived. However, when Sofie spotted Meg entering with Mike, she hurried off to make a call. \n\n\nNatalie and Faith helped Lily pick a dress. Holden wanted to keep busy to keep his mind off Lily. Carly commiserated. Lily was nervous as she anticipated her reunion with Holden. Sofie was frustrated as she got Paul's answering machine. When Paul heard that Meg was at Metro, he grabbed the phone and considered Sofie's suggestion that he break the restraining order \"by accident.\" Paul arrived, surprising Meg, while Sofie observed. Holden asked Carly to dance. \n\n\nFaith was concerned that Lily and Holden wouldn't get back together, but Lucinda reassured her. Lily entered, and she and Holden locked eyes. Holden told Lily he was glad she was back, and Carly didn't rise to Jack's sarcasm over her losing Holden's attention. When Paul wouldn't leave Meg alone, Mike asked Jack to arrest him for violating the restraining order. \n\n\nCarly reassured Lily that Holden had missed her terribly. Paul, sensing Meg's attention, put on a show by dancing with Sofie. Liberty gave Parker a call and realized she had much to teach him about dodging trouble. Meg, unable to keep her eyes off Paul, left with Mike. Paul unintentionally encouraged Sofie as he ended their dance. Lily, eager to be alone with Holden, sent an encouraging Lucinda home. Carly gently told Jack she didn't need his help. Holden gently told Lily he was not ready to make love. \n\n\nThe proud Brad and wary Katie delivered Liberty to her new room, and Brad wanted to party alone with Katie -- then he and Katie heard loud music and a crash. Katie was unsure about leaving Liberty alone, but Brad laid down ground rules -- no leaving the room and no guests -- before leaving the unrepentant Liberty alone. Brad was preening in his new father status, but Jack talked to Katie about the problems of raising teenagers. Katie dismissed Jack and walked off. \n\n\nLiberty called Parker, claiming a lascivious doorman was harassing her, and urged him to head over. Liberty admitted she had gotten Parker there under false pretenses. Brad was ready to get romantic with Katie, but she wanted to check on Liberty first. When Brad knocked on Liberty's door, she claimed to be naked as Parker worried about getting caught. Brad and Katie wished the seemingly innocent Liberty goodnight. \n\n\nBrad and Katie were finally getting down to making love when a knock on the door interrupted them -- and Katie answered to a sexy woman who claimed Brad had called her. When the woman barged in and gave Brad a hug, he realized it was Juicy Janet, Liberty's mother. Brad vetoed Janet's suggestion that they talk immediately, but was thrown when Janet had no place to stay. Brad told Liberty that Janet would be bunking with her, and Janet, alone with Liberty, liked how Brad looked and lived. Katie was hesitant -- at first -- to make love with thoughts of Janet floating in her head. \n\n\nBarbara was impressed with Sofie's jewelry work, but all Sofie could think about was Paul. Barbara thought a new dress and going to Metro were the perfect distractions for Sofie's thoughts of Paul.  \n\n\n",
