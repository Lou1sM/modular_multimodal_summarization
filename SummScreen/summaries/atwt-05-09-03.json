He threatens to air her dirty laundry in the press if she doesn't help out, but she snickers and tells him to bark up another tree.  He apologizes, and then leaves.  Molly wonders why \"a spook, spooks so easily.\"  She calls the FBI to confirm Agent Bracket really works for them.  As she confirms he has been active in the Illinois field for the last five years, Kim arrives to chat.  Molly tells her what's going on and how she has a plan to go after both Dusty AND the Agent Bracket.  Kim warns her that she could be in a lot of danger.  Molly wants to keep her in the loop just in case anything goes wrong.  Kim demands that Molly call her every day and she reserves the right to have her followed if necessary.  Molly says that Dusty and Agent Bracket won't know what hit them.\n\n\nAfter Rosanna badgers Craig again about why he returned to Oakdale, he gives up, gives her the keys to Monte Carlo, and vows that he is done with the company.  Craig admits he was wrong to leave Rosanna on their wedding night, and that he wants to get back to the way things were before he left.  Rosanna asks, \"Did Barbara buy this apology?  When you were married to her, you did the exact same thing to her as you did to me.  You married us.  You used us.  And you left us.\"  Craig says, \"Hey!  I never loved Barbara....Ever!  I have never loved any woman the way I have loved you.  Not Carly.  Not Sierra.  Not anyone.\"  She melts and hits him because that's the one thing he could have said that would penetrate her defenses.  They collapse into an embrace and kiss.  Rosanna backs up a bit and tells him she will take over Monte-Carlo, and if Craig screws up one more time he won't be getting another get-out-of-jail-free card.  Sierra knocks on the door, and tells Rosanna that she didn't come down to meddle in her life.  Rosanna says if she means it, she'll get on a plane tomorrow and return to Montega.  Sierra says that she's in town for Lucy, not Craig, \"and certainly not to meddle in the disaster that he's created.\"  She says that she wants to give Aaron and Lucy a chance that's why she's going to take the couple back to Montega on Lucinda's plane.  Craig jumps in, \"I thought you were going to help me with this!\"  Sierra says this is the fairest solution, and starts to walk away.  Craig says, \"I will give him a chance.  Please don't make her choose between him and me.\"  Rosanna stops everything, \"I can't believe this.  You just compromised on the same issue that made you leave me on our wedding night.\"  Craig says she's right, but they have made nice progress about that and have moved on.  Rosanna doesn't like what she hears, picks up her overnight bag, and says, \"Tonight I am the one leaving you.\"\n\n\nCarly and her assistant return to Jack's place with some groceries.  Carly plans to have an intimate dinner alone with her estranged husband, but an intruder may have other plans.  Carly sets the table, but she hears a thump as the intruder tiptoes downstairs.  She calls out asking for Jack, but no one responds.  The person dressed in black returns up the stairs before Carly sees what made the noise.  Carly's cell phone rings.  Jack is calling to see if Carly would be free for dinner at Al's, and Carly seems surprised because she thinks he's upstairs.  She mentions the thump she heard, and Jack asks her to come to the station and wait until he gets off work so they can go home together.  She grabs her coat and heads out the door.  A masked man slowly comes downstairs, finds the meal Carly set up and takes a bite from a sandwich.\n\n\nPaul walks in on Rose and Dusty having a passionately forced kiss.  Paul demands that Dusty get his hands off his girl.  Rose tells Paul that if he has to be angry with anyone, he should be angry with her.  Then she tells Dusty to scram.  Dusty doesn't want to leave her alone when Paul is that angry, but Rose convinces him that she will be all right.  Rose takes a moment, then whimpers, \"I know you don't want to hear this, but I'm sorry.  I never meant to hurt you.\"  Paul is fixed with anger, \"What did you expect when you called me over to see THAT!\"  Rose tells him she is so confused with her feelings.  Paul helps her figure it out, \"You're hot for a second-rate con-man and you're too dumb to know it.  Do you love me?\"  She pauses, and says, \"I loved you more than I thought I could possibly...\"  Paul interrupts her and deadpans, \"Loved.  Dusty is going to break your heart and this time I'm not going to be there to pick up the pieces.\"  Rose sobs as Paul walks out.\n\n\nLater, Rose arrives at the beauty salon, she grabs Lily and they rush into a side room where Rose confesses everything.  Dusty comes in and Lily leaves them alone.  Rose tells him it's over between her and Paul.  They embrace.  Lucinda catches them kissing.  She reminds Rose she should get back to the party and mingle.  They both return.  Lucinda sidles up to Dusty and says, \"Man you're fast.  You don't even give a girl a chance to change the sheets.\"  Dusty grins and moves away.  Rose raises her glass and toasts Dusty as \"the man with the plan.\"  \n\n\nAt the station, Paul storms in and demands from Jack everything he has collected on Dusty and Barbara.  \"I wanna show the world who Dusty Donovan really is, and I wanna see Rose's face when it happens.\"  Jack walks around his desk and pulls out a file for Paul.  \"With this you'll be able to nail both Dusty, and your mother.\"  He explains the he found out when Barbara went to Chicago a few months ago she actually stayed in the same hotel as Dusty, and paid his bill.  He also found out that she's been taking care of his expenses in Oakdale.  Paul is shocked, \"Damn her!  Her and Dusty both!  I'm taking them down, then I'm taking Rose back!\"  Carly stops by and picks up Jack.  They return home, and find Carly's prepared dinner disturbed.  Jack warns her to wait outside.  Jack shouts out that he's armed and is searching the house, when Henry saunters out of the kitchen.  Jack says he was supposed to get out of town, but Henry has run out of money and needs a place to stay.  Carly returns and says the cops are on the way.  \n\n\nLater, Barbara walks in on Rose's party and says, \"Rose, Rose, Rose.  It looks like you and Dusty have done a bang up job.\"  Rose asks her very nicely to leave.  Babs lets it slip that she thinks Rose and Paul are finished, and Lucinda bites back, \"Enough Barbara.  Get the Hell out of here before we gang up on ya and turn ya into a blond.\"  Rose's patience has run out.  She sets her glass down and steps forward to throw Barbar out.  Paul bursts in and says, \"You've been set up Rose.  It's been going on for months.  They've been working together. She's been paying his bills, Rose.  She owns him!\"  He turns to Dusty and asks him, \"Just this once, be half the man you used to be.  Tell her the truth.  I dare ya.\"\n\n\nOn the Next Episode:\n\nMolly sifts through a briefcase in Dusty's room when someone grabs her from behind.  She screams through his hands.  \n\n\nDusty admits, \"Barbara hired me to break off your engagement.\"  Rose slaps him.\n\n\n",

At the station, Jack gave Paul information showing that Barbara had been paying Dusty's way even before he came into town. Rose arrived to the opening of The Roller Palace late and shared a few kisses with Dusty. Paul came in with the information that proved she had been set up by Paul and Barbara. Carly heard thumps in the house while preparing dinner for Jack. He suggested that she leave the house. When they returned home, Henry Coleman was in the house hiding out because he didn't have the funds to leave town. After Sierra told Craig that she was taking Lucy and Aaron to Montega, he decided to bend and let the young couple see each other in Oakdale. This infuriated Rosanna so badly, she packed her bags.",
