He realizes he reacted as a \"jealous husband,\" a phrase that surprises Lily.  He tells her about his and Lucinda's suspicions and pleads with her to be careful, to take things slowly, unlike his relationship with Julia.  She agrees to be careful and take things slowly and tells him that she is trying to come to grips with the knowledge that their marriage is over.  The doorbell rings and Holden answers it - Keith is standing outside with a bouquet of flowers for Lily.  Holden apologizes to Keith, as well.  Lily invites Keith inside but she cannot forget what she overheard between him and Vin outside her door the night before.  Keith leaves and Lily calls Carly and asks her to come over to talk right away.  When Carly arrives, Lily admits that she has misgivings about Keith, that she thinks there are things that Keith is hiding from her.  Carly tells her that she does not want things to be over between Holden and Lily, but if they are, and Lily is interested in Keith, she must be honest with him.

When she reads the inscription, she realizes it is Julia's engagement ring.\n\n\nIn the lobby of the Lakeview, Keith sells his watch for cash to a very seedy looking character.  He turns around and sees Vin, who tells him he wants the rest of what he is owed by the end of the day.  Keith is not happy when he sees Holden in the lobby and reacts very aggressively toward him, telling him that he knows the apology Holden made to Lily was for her sake, not his.  Holden is surprised by Keith's anger and tells him that he isn't following Keith, but is there for a business meeting.  Keith seems a little ashamed of himself when Holden leaves for the meeting.  Keith leaves to go home and puts his key in the door where, inside, Lily has just found Julia's ring.....\n\n\nCelia meets Casey at Al's Diner, and he asks if they can get back together.
