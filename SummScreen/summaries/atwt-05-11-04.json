Alison is very surprised at the gift and is at a loss for words when trying to express how she feels about it.  Kim tells Alison she is so gifted, she is sure to do wonderful things.

    "tvdb": "At the BRO fashion show, Carly learns Jordan and Rosanna are married but theyre interrupted before she can get the scoop. The fashion show is a huge success, and Barbara, assisted by Paul and Jennifer, is able to conceal her blindness as she walks the runway to great accolades. Barbara gives credit to Carly, and offers her her own line under the BRO umbrella before heading back to Oakdale Memorial for surgery. Up in the suite, Rosanna freaks when Annabelle Fettle reveals that someone knocked her out and when she came to, the baby was gone. Jack arrives and Rosanna begs him to help her find her son. Meanwhile, Craig lets a very large, muscular European woman into his motel room and mysteriously tells her she knows what do to. Jack has Fettle arrested and Jordan finds Rosanna collapsed and sobbing. When Paul hears whats going on, he wants to help but Jack insists that he stay out if it. Craig calls Rosanna. He wants her to meet him at a wedding chapel to remarry him, so that they'll be a family again. Margo and Tom are shocked to find Doc in their kitchen cooking dinner. Margo is surprised, and a little disappointed, when Ben and Jessica arrive but covers. After dinner, Margo walks Doc out and he invites her on a lunch date. She turns him down but kisses him on the cheek. Inside, Jessica notices Margos hand trembling and busts her on having a serious crush on Doc. Chris surprises Alison with a gift: her very own potter's wheel. He asks her to make a plate for Bob and Kims anniversary. She tries to beg off but cant. Nancy demands that Alison come clean, but she insists that she can't disappoint Chris and his parents. She will just have to learn to make the plate.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Chris and the Hughes gift Allison with a potter's wheel. Not being able to tell the truth, Allison perpetuates the lie that she's taking a ceramics class and even though Nancy chastises her about it, she keeps Allison's secret. Margo is distraught about having Katie committed, and is pleasantly surprised that Casey, Curtis and Doc have made dinner. Curtis invites Ben and Jessica, who were trying to spend a romantic evening at the Lakeview, to dinner at the Hughes', Jessica going so she can keep an eye on Doc. Doc makes a pass at Margo and she turns down having lunch with him privately, but invites him to another dinner at the house. Jessica calls Margo on her infatuation with Doc. The BRO Fashion show is a success and Barbara gets to take her bows as she planned, her children by her side. Jack flies in to see Carly's success, but is also there about Cabot's birthmother (who's disappeared along with Cabot) and wants to speak with Roseanna about it. Annabelle informs Roseanna that Cabot was stolen from her room and Jack calls his Vegas contacts to aid in the search for the baby. After the show, Jack returns to speak with Carly, Paul overhearing their conversation and begging to let him help Roseanna. Jordan is comforting Roseanna when she receives a call from Craig, who tells her to meet him at the \"Palace of Happiness\" wedding chapel, stating that if she weds him, they can all be a happy family again; him, Roseanna, Lucy and Cabot.",
