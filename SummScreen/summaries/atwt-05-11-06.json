Dusty promises Jennifer that he'll go easy on Emily, but once Jen is gone, Dusty accuses Hal of letting Emily off the hook. At the hospital, Emily apologizes to Jen and Johnny. Jen confides that when she first got pregnant, all she wanted was to abort Craig's baby and forget about it. But she didn't and now she can't imagine not having him. Emily asks if Jen thinks Emily shouldn't have an abortion. Jen says she hates the idea of Emily being the mother of her niece or nephew, but abortion is Emily's choice. Meanwhile, Paul romantically asks Meg to move in with him, and she agrees. Paul stops by the hospital to check on Emily, and she says she's decided to keep their baby. Maddie is convinced that Casey slept with Gwen the other night, and Will isn't too confident about his wife's fidelity, either. Both assure their significant others that nothing happened...skipping over the brief moment of heat when they woke up. Later, Maddie meets up with Will to tutor him and jokes about Casey falling asleep on Gwen's shoulder. Since she didn't mention that part, either, Will is bugged. Henry goes to pick up his briefcase of ill-gotten cash...in time to see a cop walk off with it. He goes to Hal who says it is part of the case against Emily. Henry is forced to say the money isn't his, and slink away.\n\n\n",
