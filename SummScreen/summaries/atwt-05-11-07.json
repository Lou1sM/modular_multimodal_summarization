    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Emma's, Jack nervously prepares for his first date with Katie. Meanwhile, at WOAK, a lingerie-clad Katie and a shirtless Brad are in bed together filming a spot about Mother's Day for their TV show, giving advice to husbands to let the kids give practical gifts like toasters while the husbands give gifts like lingerie and perfume. After they finish filming, Katie pushes Brad out of bed, and he can't believe she's still upset with him. As she dresses behind closed doors, she continues yelling at him about how badly he treated her and Jack, and Jack walks up behind Brad as Brad tries to defend himself by telling Katie he cares about her. When Jack interrupts, Brad tells them both that he just thought they should slow things down before one of them got hurt, but Jack says Brad didn't care anything at all about Katie until he started showing an interest in her. They leave for their date, and Brad starts thumbing through his little black book before he realizes he just can't do that anymore because he does care about Katie. \n\n\nBrad ends up at Al's Diner, where he sees Henry and invites him to sit down. Brad wonders why he and Henry, two good-looking single guys, are alone at Al's on a nice night for a date. He lectures Henry about having thrown away a good thing when he walked away from Vienna, then he turns the discussion to himself and how he used to be able to just call someone from his little black book and have a good time. Henry says that was before he met Katie, and Brad agrees. Brad asks Henry why Katie would choose Jack over him, and Henry, getting up to leave, suggests it's because Katie is more attracted to Jack.\n\n\nAt the Wagon Wheel Motel, Cleo sees Carly in the hallway again and gives her advice on eating healthier. Carly can't find her wallet, but Cleo spots it and then sees the picture of Carly's kids that's on the front of the wallet. She says she bets Carly would like to see them, but Carly says if she tries to see the kids, Jack will have her arrested. Cleo thinks she can help with that by pretending to be Gwen. She calls Emma and finds out she's picking the kids up from a movie in Old Town, so Cleo dresses like Gwen, and Carly hides in the shadows until Emma and the kids walk out of the movie theater. \"Gwen\" tells Emma she'll take the kids for ice cream, but Parker says he'll pass. Emma then says she wants to stop at a nearby shop, and she asks Parker if he wants to come with her, but he says he'll wait there. She leaves, and Parker takes out a flyer, looks at it, and crumbles it up and tosses it on the ground. Sage walks up a few minutes later and tells Parker that \"Gwen\" let her have 2 kinds of ice cream. Carly picks up the paper Parker threw away and sees that it was a flyer for a Mother's Day sale. JJ comes out with \"Gwen,\" and Carly listens as the kids talk about her, with Sage saying Parker won't say he misses their mom, and Parker saying he doesn't know why he should, because Carly obviously doesn't miss them. Cleo tries to change the subject by asking Sage what her plans are for the summer; Sage is hurt that \"Gwen\" doesn't remember the plans they made (to take classes together once a week at the local college), saying, \"But you promised me!\" \"Gwen\" apologizes, and although she continues to apologize after Emma returns, Sage is inconsolable. Emma takes the kids home, and Cleo apologizes to Carly for messing things up, but Carly says she's the one who's messed things up by causing her children so much pain. Back at the Wagon Wheel, Carly thanks Cleo for helping her see her kids; Cleo says she's sorry it made Carly feel so bad. She offers to help again if she needs anything else, and Carly responds, \"As a matter of fact, I do. I want to see Jack.\"\n\n\nJack and Katie go to the Lakeview for drinks, where he tells her how gorgeous she is and how much he wishes he could be more spontaneous; she tells him from now on, it can be his job to tell her how gorgeous she is and her job to be spontaneous. Then, she kisses him, as Brad walks in. Brad leaves, and Jack gets a call from Emma telling him that Sage is very upset and asking for Carly; he tells her he'll be right there, then he excuses himself to Katie and says he has to go. Katie insists on coming with him, and when they get to Emma's, they kiss on the porch as Parker watches from the kitchen window.\n\n\nAt Paul's, Alison ruins the Rosanna phone call to Craig by laughing when she messes up one of her lines. Paul is furious with her. Lucinda comes in just as Ali is saying she thinks she's going to be sick. When Ali comes out of the bathroom, Paul throws her out without paying her, yelling at her about putting a really good person in jeopardy. Alison leaves and finds Jesse, her drug contact, but he won't give her drugs unless she has cash for them; Alison relentlessly propositions Jesse, promising him a good time, until he walks away with her. Back in Paul's suite, Lucinda tells him Alison wouldn't be involved in this if he hadn't gotten her involved in the first place, and Paul says he realizes this is all his fault. He wants to go to Craig's to get Meg out of there, but Lucinda says he can't do that. She tells him he's too impatient and that if Meg can get out of Craig's place without being found out, she'll be in a much stronger position to deceive Craig in the future. She tells Paul that next time, he should listen to her before deciding what they're going to do next to bring Craig down.\n\n\nAt Craig's, after Alison begins laughing, Craig realizes it's not really Rosanna. He hangs up, but then his phone rings again; this time, it's the CFO of Montgomery Enterprises, and Craig tells Meg he has to handle this business call but that he'll be back in 5 minutes. Meg's cell phone rings after Craig walks out, and it's Paul, warning her that Craig will be onto them now, saying she needs to either get out or get rid of the wire she's wearing. Meg stuffs the wire in her purse as Craig walks back into the room. She asks if the first phone call was from Rosanna, and he tells her how strange he finds it that she came to tell him how guilty she's felt about the patient who died because of her mistake, because it's made his own guilt come flooding out of him. He says maybe he can tell her about it, and he kisses her. As his advances become more insistent, Meg pulls away, and Craig asks if she's afraid he'll find the wire she's wearing. Meg pretends to be outraged that he'd think such a thing about her, and she angrily begins stripping, throwing her clothing at him and telling him to take his time pawing through it to reassure himself there's nothing there. She is so convincing that he begins trying to apologize to her. Meg storms out of the room, pausing in the foyer to call Paul and tell him to meet her in the lobby of the Lakeview right away, \"and bring your pal, Lucinda --- we have lots to talk about!\" Craig overhears and goes to the Lakeview with Meg, who marches up to Paul and Lucinda and reams them out for doing such a dreadful thing to Craig, who is still mourning Rosanna's condition. Craig listens gleefully and then asks Paul and Lucinda how much it cost them to bribe the Swedish clinic. Meg wants to leave with Craig, but Paul tries to stop her, telling her he can't let her do that; Meg angrily shakes him off, telling him he has no say in the matter anymore. She leaves with Craig, and Lucinda tells Paul she thinks Meg did a very convincing job of fooling Craig and that now, Meg's in a strong position with Craig. She brushes off Paul's concerns for Meg's safety, saying Meg can obviously take care of herself. Meg drives Craig back to Fairwinds, and he apologizes to her again, saying she's not like Paul and Lucinda, that she may be the most honest person he's ever met, and he knows now that he can trust her more than she can possibly imagine. Meg says that's a good thing to know.\n\n\n\n\n",
