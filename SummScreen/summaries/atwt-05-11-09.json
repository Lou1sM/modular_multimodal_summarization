    "soap_central": "\n\nFrom her couch, Katie watched a segment of Kim's show on surrogacy and Vienna's baby. She was still despairing of her lost baby, and Brad was worried about her. She had not slept at all, so Brad volunteered to get her something to help. \n\n\nVienna asked Henry if he thought Brad and Katie would ever forgive them for breaking their promise. Henry hoped they would, and he was counting on their realizing that he and Vienna had not broken their trust on purpose. He was still anxious about being a parent, but he was willing to share the life experience with Vienna. He got her feeling more cheerful and offered his credit card so that she could buy more maternity clothes. A cheered-up Vienna took off for Fashions. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Vienna ran into Brad, who was picking up sleeping pills for Katie. She asked about Katie, but he only said that she was devastated and that Henry and Vienna should have told the truth from the beginning. \n\n\nAt the police station, Lucy told Margo that she had never meant for Craig to get in trouble. Lucinda walked in for a visit, so Margo left them alone. The girl told her grandmother that Damian had offered her the use of his ships for humanitarian purposes, but Lucinda did not think the Damian she knew had a generous bone in his body. \n\n\nAt home, Luke told his folks that he couldn't sleep because he was thinking about Lucy's smuggling medical supplies with Damian's help. He told them about Damian's plan to help Lucy, but no one knew any details. Meanwhile, Damian told his henchman to put out the word among the unscrupulous crowd that he was willing to use his ships for shady purposes in order to make extra cash. His man asked since when were the Grimaldi ships in the gun-smuggling business, and Damian responded that he had issued an order and his man was to make it happen. \n\n\nKatie's doorbell rang, so she answered it and found Vienna outside her door. Vienna tried to be friendly, but Katie attempted to shut the door on her. Vienna jerked and grabbed her stomach, so Katie asked her if she was okay. Vienna smiled and said she had just felt the baby move. Katie invited her in to sit a minute, and then she put her hand on Vienna's belly. The baby kicked, and the two of them began talking. Vienna apologized for waiting so long to tell Katie that the baby she was carrying was Henry's, because she had not wanted to dash her friend's hopes. \n\n\nOut of the blue, Katie asked if it was still possible that she and Brad could raise the baby. Vienna said she would have to think about that, and, of course, discuss it with Henry. Katie was sure Henry would agree, so she hugged Vienna. Brad walked in and was surprised to see his wife happy once more. After Vienna left, Katie announced she had \"fixed everything,\" and Brad finally understood what Katie was wanting. His response was, \"Absolutely not!\" \n\n\n\nLily and Holden discussed the advisability of Luke's staying away from Damian, for the time being, with Luke and Noah. Noah left for work, and Luke went with him. Noah knew his boyfriend had no intention of staying away from Damian, and he warned him to be careful. They arrived at Java, and Luke announced that he had to take off for a while. Noah scolded him for not heeding his parents' warning, but Luke said he only wanted to talk to his birth father. He wanted answers, but Noah was worried about Luke's safety. \n\n\nFredo called Damian and asked if Damian could provide shipping that was \"under the radar.\" Damian told him where his office was located, but Fredo refused to go there. Damian then suggested the man meet him on the docks in ten minutes. Damian walked out to wait for Fredo, but it was Luke who showed up. Damian told him he should not be there, and he tried to get Luke to leave. \n\n\nDamian finally told his son he was waiting for someone, and Luke said he would wait with him. Damian got angry and said Luke would just be in the way, and he acted in a hurtful manner. He insisted that Luke go, but Luke countered with an ultimatum: either Luke could walk away forever or Damian could explain his bizarre behavior. Damian shoved Luke away, and the boy kept on walking, but he turned around in time to see someone approaching Damian. Luke hid behind an office and watched. \n\n\nVienna went to the diner and told Henry that she had visited Katie instead of shopping. She explained about their talk, and Henry was sad for Katie and Brad. He said he would do anything to stop their despair, so Vienna asked if he would reconsider and think about giving their baby to their friends, after all. \"Our baby?\" asked Henry, followed by an \"Absolutely not!\" Vienna attempted to convince Henry to let Brad and Katie take the baby, because Vienna could make another one for them. \n\n\nLily and Holden stopped at Java to see if Luke wanted to go with them to the police station to see Lucy. Noah said Luke was \"running errands,\" so Holden immediately asked if the errands concerned Damian. Noah admitted that they did, so Lily tried to call Damian, but he did not answer. \n\n\nFredo appeared on the docks, and Damian asked him if he could get his guns to the ship without being noticed. Fredo nodded yes, and Damian realized that he had used Grimaldi ships before. Fredo volunteered that this time, Damian, himself, would get a cut. Damian pulled a gun, but Fredo jumped and overpowered him. Luke watched and then made a run to protect Damian, but Fredo had picked up a pipe. He was about to clobber Damian, but Luke grabbed his arm and stopped him. Next, Fredo pulled a knife and focused on Luke, but Noah, holding Damian's revolver, ordered him to drop it. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Holden and Lily arrived, and Lucinda asked them to explain to Lucy that there was no possibility of Damian's getting her out of there. Holden instead asked Lucy if she knew where Damian was, but she did not. He was worried that Luke was looking for Damian and might get into trouble. Margo interrupted to ask why no one in the Snyder-Walsh family could keep out of police business, but Lucinda persuaded her to track down both Damian and Luke. \n\n\nBack on the docks, Fredo lunged with his knife for Luke, and Noah fired. Fredo fell to the dock, and Damian divested Noah of the weapon. Luke ran to Noah, as Margo walked up. Damian handed her the gun and introduced her to Fredo. \n\n\nBrad and Katie continued to discuss taking the baby, but Brad was sure that Henry would not go for it. Katie was getting really wound up, as Brad reminded her that their best friends had lied to them on numerous occasions. Katie begged Brad to change his mind and agree to raise the baby, and Brad gave in. Katie ran to get dressed, while a numb Brad questioned his sanity. \n\n\nHenry and Vienna argued about the baby, as well, but their argument dissolved into kisses. Brad and Katie knocked on their door, and Brad walked in announcing that their answer was \"yes!\" Henry asked what the question was, so Brad explained it was their offer to give the baby to Brad and Katie to raise. Henry was stunned as Katie threw her arms around him in gratitude. \n\n\nHenry stammered and stuttered, until Brad figured out that their friends had changed their minds again. Katie could not believe that was happening, and she implored Henry to do the right thing and keep his promise. Brad was very angry at Vienna for raising Katie's hopes again, and he dragged his wife away. \n\n\nLuke and Noah ran into the police station, and Damian followed. Holden began ragging on Damian, but Luke stopped him. Damian explained that the best way he could think of to help Lucy was to find Fredo, and he had set a trap, which Fredo had fallen for. He told everyone how Noah had saved him with his fast thinking and good aim, and Margo had Fredo in custody and he was confessing to the murder. \n\n\nLucy was very relieved. When Margo entered, she gave her standard lecture to the boys about playing cops - again. She also told Lucy she was free to go, but before Lucy left, she made sure to tell Luke that Damian had helped her transport her medical supplies in order to prove to Luke that his father had changed. \n\n\nHolden walked outside the interview room and made some snide comments to Damian. He berated him for once again putting Luke in danger and asked what it would take to get Damian out of Luke's life for good. Damian claimed that it had been an accident that Luke had gotten caught in the crossfire again, and he and Holden raised their voices. Luke joined them and defended Damian. Holden declared he was done, and he stormed out. \n\n\nAt home, Katie obsessed about the baby she would never have, but Brad promised that her pain would get better. Vienna and Henry were sad, too, but Henry said they had to put their own little family first. He had been shopping and brought out a bag of toys for the baby, and he coaxed smiles from \"mommy.\" \n\n\nNoah and Luke swore off \"bad guys\" at Java, as Damian walked in. Luke told him that he truly believed that Damian had changed, and he hugged him. \n\n\nHolden gave Lily a neck massage, and she said she was so happy that they didn't have to worry about Damian anymore, but Holden added, \"Until the next time.\"\n\n\n",
