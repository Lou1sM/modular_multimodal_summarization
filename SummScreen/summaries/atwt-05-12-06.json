He tells them again that this is not something he's unsure about and that they need to accept this as the truth, saying that if they can't do that, he can't stay with them because it would be living a different lie. After he walks out, Lily realizes her reactions have been less than supportive and worries that he might actually leave home. Holden assures her that's not likely and says they just have to rely on the fact that they've raised Luke to be a good person and trust him to choose the right path for himself in life.\n\n\nCarly goes to the police station to get Hal's house key so she can pick Parker up from school and take him home to Hal's.

Mike, Katie, and Jessica come out to go to the arraignment, but an officer approaches Jack and quietly tells him that the St. Christopher's medallion has gone missing from the evidence room. Nick arrives and finds out about the missing evidence and insists that Jack let Mike go. Jack is forced to admit that he can't hold Mike without the evidence, so he tells Mike he is free to go home. Jack then accuses Nick of having taken the evidence to help his cousin, and later, Carly insists she can't believe that Nick would do such a thing. However, when Carly picks up Parker and takes him to Hal's house, they run into Nick, who wants to talk to Hal before Jack can tell Hal his suspicions about Nick.

He tries to talk her out of it, but she says the fact that the pregnancy didn't end when she fell off the cliff proves that this life wasn't meant to end yet. She also tells Paul that this baby represents hope and salvation for her, and that he never has to see either Emily or the baby again. Susan comes in to take Emily down the hall for her abortion, but Emily tells her she's changed her mind. Susan blames Paul, but Paul says he had nothing to do with it and wishes Susan luck in talking some sense into Emily. He leaves, and Emily tells Susan that she really wants to have the baby, asking her if she'll take care of it while Emily is in prison. Susan asks if Emily is sure about this and then agrees to take care of the baby for her if it comes to that.\n\n\nMeg is packing her things up to move in with Paul when Jennifer arrives at the Lakeview.

Jennifer says she spoke to Emily at the hospital and told her how much Johnny has meant in her life.
