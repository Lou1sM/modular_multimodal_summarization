Once she was alone, Ameera phoned the prison and asked to speak with Colonel Mayer. As Ameera made the call, Luke walked in and heard her ask to speak with Noah's father. Luke listened as Ameera insisted on talking with Winston, but once she caught sight of Luke, she wanted to know how long he had been standing there and what he had heard. Luke confronted Ameera about her need to talk to Colonel Mayer and demanded to know what was going on between her and Noah's father. Ameera told Luke that she only wanted to know why Winston wanted to see her. Luke said it would be best if she forgot that the Colonel had ever phoned her and let Noah deal with his father. Luke walked out and found Noah returning home from school. Luke told Noah they needed to talk and took him into Old Town so they could speak in private away from Ameera. \n\n\nAs they sat in town, Luke told Noah about Ameera phoning the prison. Noah wasn't surprised that Ameera was trying to find out why Winston had called her before and explained to Luke that he was not upset that Ameera had phoned his father. Luke believed Ameera and Winston were hiding something from Noah, and that Luke and Noah should try to find out what it was. Noah said Luke was being paranoid and refused to believe that Ameera was working with the Colonel. Noah accused Luke of wanting to believe the worst of Ameera in the hopes that Noah would end his fake marriage to her and could be with Luke. As Luke and Noah continued to fight about Ameera's intentions, she walked up and overheard their argument escalate. When Noah defended Ameera as his \"wife\" and told Luke to stop accusing her of collaborating with Winston, Luke said that Noah just wanted a perfect life with Ameera and was beginning to care more for her than him. Frustrated, Luke stormed off. \n\n\nAfter Luke left, Ameera approached Noah and told him that she saw him fighting with Luke and hoped she hadn't caused them any problems. Noah asked her why she had phoned his father and Ameera said she needed to know why the Colonel had wanted her to visit him. Noah was so distracted by his argument with Luke that he told Ameera he couldn't talk and went to find Luke. \n\n\nLuke returned to the farm and was greeted by his grandmother, Lucinda. She saw that Luke was having a bad day and asked him what was wrong. Lucinda knew right away it was Noah and offered to help out any way she could. Luke told her that Noah's fake marriage to Ameera was causing more pain than he ever imagined it would. As Luke explained that Noah cared more about Ameera's feelings than his, Lucinda said she believed that wasn't true and pointed Luke to the door, where Noah was standing. Lucinda quickly excused herself and left Noah and Luke alone to discuss their problems. Noah apologized and told Luke he was trying to make the best of a bad situation with Ameera and his father. Luke said he couldn't live if something bad happened to Noah because of Ameera, and the two embraced. \n\n\nAlison walked the halls of the hospital with a fellow nursing student and discussed her classes. Chris saw Alison and approached her to talk, but Alison seemed nervous. After her friend left, Alison kept apologizing for ruining their date the other night by rushing out right before they made love. Chris thought Alison was avoiding him because she wanted to break up with him, but Alison took him in to a private office and explained that she was embarrassed after the other night. Alison went on to say that she thought she and Chris might be better off as friends. Chris told her she had nothing to apologize for and he wanted their new-found love affair to continue and hoped she did too. Alison wasn't sure they should move forward with their romance, but Chris told her not to give up on them. Alison walked out, leaving Chris to wonder where their relationship was heading. \n\n\nAfter his talk with Alison, Chris went to check on a patient and ran into his father. Bob explained to Chris that Alison was having trouble in the nursing course and she needed to do well on her next test or she might have to leave the program. Chris thanked his dad for letting him know about Alison's problems with school and said he would make sure he helped her with her studies. \n\n\nAlison sat at Java and slammed her book shut in frustration. Chris saw her and explained that he understood that she was overwhelmed by school and that it might not be the best time for a serious relationship. He offered to tutor her and help her through her classes. Chris sat down and started showing Alison all of the tricks that helped him get through medical school. \n\n\nLiberty found Parker studying at Al's Diner and invited him to ditch school with her again. Parker told her there was no way he could miss school again, but before he could go back to school, Liberty told Parker that her mother was in town and looking to reconnect with Brad. As Liberty described her mother's lusty past and sexual escapades, Parker stopped her and was shocked that Liberty and her mom had such an open relationship. Parker agreed to meet up with Liberty after school to watch a movie. \n\n\nAt the television station, Katie and Brad filmed a cooking segment for their show, but the episode was interrupted when Janet came by to talk to Brad. Katie and Brad told Kim about Brad's long-lost teenage daughter and explained that Janet was Liberty's mother. With filming left to be done, Kim and Janet watched as Katie and Brad got back to shooting the scene for their show. As Brad and Katie cooked a homemade Italian meal, Janet, a real Italian, kept commenting on the mistakes they were making. When Katie suggested garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, Janet ran on set and told them a real Italian meal had to have fresh garlic. While she showed the viewers the art of chopping garlic, she announced that she was the mother of Brad's child. As they continued to film, Janet kept flirting with Brad and dropping hints that she was the right woman for him. Katie was visibly annoyed by Janet, but everyone else on the set complemented Janet on her energy. Katie had heard enough and pulled Brad into their office. Once alone, Katie told Brad that Janet needed to get out of Oakdale, so Brad took Janet back to the hotel to give her the bad news. \n\n\nOnce Brad and Janet left, Kim stopped by Katie's office and said the episode had turned out great. Katie filled Kim in on Brad and Janet's past and admitted that Juicy Janet and Liberty were a big hurdle for newlyweds. Kim offered her support and advised Katie not to worry. Kim reassured Katie that she wouldn't be hiring Janet and Katie was happy to get that bit of news. \n\n\nBrad took Janet back to the Lakeview and she jumped around excited about her television debut. Brad put an end to her happiness when he told her she couldn't stay in Oakdale. Brad explained that he was happy that Liberty had found him, but he had no place in his life for Janet. He encouraged Janet to get out there and find an available guy. Janet tearfully agreed to pack her bags and go. Brad helped her get her things stuffed in a suitcase and as they finished, Liberty returned with Parker. When Liberty saw the bag, Janet explained that she was leaving town so Brad and Liberty could have a chance to bond. Liberty was angry that Janet was going and obviously felt abandoned. She told her mom to leave, and Brad walked Janet out. Parker asked Liberty if she was upset about her mom going, but Liberty said she didn't want to talk about it and just wanted to watch a movie. As they sat together in silence, Liberty looked heartbroken about her mom's quick exit. \n\n\nIn the lobby, Brad put Janet's things into a cab and wished her well. Janet told Brad to watch out for Liberty and hugged him goodbye. Katie arrived and asked if Janet was leaving town and Brad told Katie that Janet was gone and they could get back to their life together. The newly married couple celebrated their freedom from Janet with a kiss.\n\n\n",
