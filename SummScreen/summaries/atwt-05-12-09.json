    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Memorial, Casey and Alison were making plans for a BBQ at Casey's after work, with \"indefinite plans\" for the evening. When Jade approached them, Alison generously invited her along, and Jade accepted. Alison promised Casey that they would have time alone later. Alison was still trying to fix Jade up with someone, and she wanted to give the new guy Hunter, a habitual klutz, a second chance. She decided to invite him to the BBQ, so they would have a foursome. \n\n\nJade heard the two of them plotting, and when Casey told her Alison's plan, Jade's response was, \"No way in hell!\" Casey pleaded with Jade to give the guy another shot, but after Jade had suffered through Hunter's dumping her drink all over her, she said she was fearful that the man might light her on fire at a BBQ. Jade said to count her out. \n\n\nAt the Intruder office, Emily tried to work with Hunter, her Lucinda-appointed assistant, but she was having difficulty converting her writing style to a web format. Hunter accused her of continuing to make the same stupid mistakes over and over, and that riled up Emily. She chased him out of the office and told him to take a hike, so that she could finish the digital prototype that Lucinda wanted the next day. \n\n\nDusty called out to Johnny in their room in the Lakeview, but the boy did not answer. Dusty looked all over and finally found him hiding in the bathroom. The boy would not speak to him, so Dusty was frightened. He took Johnny straight to Memorial Hospital and asked for a doctor, but Lucy saw them arrive and offered to help. Dusty refused to let her look at her brother, but Lucy insisted, and she had a nurse take the boy into an exam room. Dusty told Lucy that Johnny would not talk, and the two of them went into the room. \n\n\nCraig and Carly had coffee at the Lakeview, and they talked about Craig's attempt to get Johnny back legally, since he was no longer a suspect in a murder. Craig was worried that Dusty might take the boy out of the country immediately. He said he had the right to raise his child in spite of having made more than a few parenting goofs. He was also fearful that Dusty would turn the boy against him. Craig also railed against Lucy, whom he accused of betraying him for \"that two-bit thug.\" \n\n\nCarly attempted to get Craig to reconcile with Lucy, but he was adamant in how he felt. He received a large envelope by messenger that contained the reinstatement of his full custody rights to his son, and he could not wait to deliver the news to Dusty. He and Carly went to Dusty's room and knocked, but there was no answer. Craig began shouting through the door for Dusty to open up, when a maid came by and told them that Mr. Donovan had taken the little boy to the hospital. \n\n\nAlison talked with Emily at her office, and she asked for Hunter. Emily told her sister that he was at Al's having some soothing tea, so Alison left and tracked him down. She invited him to the BBQ, but Hunter, always short on social skills, asked her why. Alison tried to explain that it was just a fun thing to do, but Hunter declined because he was sure that Emily was going to need him any minute to get her out of cyber-trouble. Alison offered to invite him another time, and she walked out. \n\n\nHunter returned to the office and found that Emily had written three paragraphs, full of errors. She promised to fix them all herself, and begged Hunter for another chance before he took over. He called her \"an old dog\" that was having difficulty learning new tricks, so Emily suggested he take the afternoon off and go to the BBQ that she knew Alison had invited him to. \n\n\nOn Casey's patio, Alison found him tending the BBQ, and they shared their bad news that neither of their invitees would be attending. Casey was not at all disappointed that it was going to be a private affair, and he gave Alison a warm kiss. Alison's phone rang, and she told Hunter that he could still attend. After she hung up, she told Casey he had better go find Jade and drag her there, so Hunter would have someone to talk to. \n\n\nCasey found Jade trying on clothes in Fashions, and he gave the BBQ another pitch. He begged her to give Hunter one more chance, but Jade made him sweeten the offer by agreeing to transport their two most difficult patients in the senior transport van. That sealed the deal, and Jade agreed to the BBQ. \n\n\nHunter arrived bearing a hostess gift, as instructed by Emily. She had suggested he bring candy, so he showed up with a paper sack full of gummy worms. He offered to help, so Alison asked him to begin grilling the meat. Hunter, however, said he did not grill, nor did he eat grilled meat because of the carcinogens. He lost Alison by delivering a convoluted scientific explanation of what carcinogens do, but she pretended to look interested. Casey and Jade walked in just as Hunter ripped the candy sack, and gummy worms went all over the floor. \n\n\nLucy examined Johnny, but he checked out fine. He did speak to her, so Lucy asked Dusty to leave the room. Then she asked the boy what was wrong, and he said he was scared. Lucy went out in the hall and told Dusty that he and Craig had traumatized the boy with their fighting. Craig and Carly ran up, and Craig demanded to know what was going on. Lucy explained that Johnny was upset and confused that the two people he loved the most could not stop attacking each other. She warned about permanent damage if the two of them did not work out their differences. \n\n\nCraig whipped out the court order and immediately staked his claim again. Lucy suggested that it would be better for Johnny if Dusty took him back to the Lakeview and then turned him over to Craig. Craig agreed and told Dusty he had thirty minutes to bring the boy to him at the hotel. He and Carly left, while Dusty looked through the window into the exam room. He told Lucy that he should have taken the boy away when he had the chance. Lucy said that Craig and Dusty had to settle the thing between them before Johnny retreated completely into himself. \n\n\nCraig and Carly waited for Johnny in the Lakeview bar. Craig had a real drink, but Carly was sipping club soda. Craig toasted to justice, but Carly refused to salute splitting a poor child's heart in two. Dusty appeared and told Craig that he would not hand over Johnny until they had settled on a plan. \n\n\nCarly immediately excused herself, and Craig unceremoniously told Dusty that since Craig had the law behind him, Dusty was out in the cold. \"Live with it, \"a smug Craig said. Dusty asked only for a place in Johnny's life, but Craig refused. He walked into the lobby and picked up Johnny from a chair. He carried the boy to the elevator, and Carly followed. \n\n\nAt the BBQ, Alison tried to stimulate conversation between Hunter and Jade, but it was slow going. Casey announced that the burgers were ready, but Hunter again said that he chose not to eat carcinogens. Casey made a joke, which Hunter did not get, but suddenly he changed his mind and decided to take a burger. He asked if he could bring one to Jade, and she agreed, so Hunter carried one on a plate to her and dropped it on her feet. He apologized immediately, and Jade, for once a good sport, invoked the \"5 second rule,\" and picked it up. \n\n\nThe \"rule\" confused Hunter, who had never heard of it, so Casey explained. At that point, Hunter grabbed his burger and made a hasty exit. Jade chewed out her friends and referred to Hunter as \"a human train wreck.\" She grabbed her purse and walked out. \"We should do this more often,\" wisecracked Casey. \n\n\nHunter returned to his office, and Emily showed him her work. He declared it to be \"very good.\" Hunter told her the BBQ had not gone well, and Jade was not quite his type. He liked Alison, however, but he saw very little similarity between her and her sister. Emily mentioned that they had different fathers, and then she murmured that actually, they had different mothers, as well. Hunter picked up on that, so Emily explained that technically Alison was her sister and her daughter. She told him how she had donated an egg to her mother, so that Susan could become pregnant. Hunter thought that was \"cool.\" \n\n\nCarly asked Craig what Dusty had said to him when just the two of them had talked. He said that Dusty had the audacity to ask for a place in Johnny's life, but, of course, Craig had refused. Carly asked him how he could be like that, and Craig warned her not to cross the line. Carly went on about how Dusty was Johnny's only connection to his mother, and she warned him that the boy would resent Craig for keeping him from Dusty. \n\n\nCraig suddenly asked Carly to assume he was a generous kind of guy who would make room for Dusty in Johnny's life. He asked if Carly would consider that guy someone she could fall in love with. She said if Craig went all reasonable on her, perhaps she would not be able to help herself. Craig immediately called for a sitter for Johnny and told Carly to go with him. \n\n\nDusty sat in the bar and asked Lucy to keep him company. She told him how she had gotten out of jail and explained her connection to Damian Grimaldi. She said she found out, however, that she still cared about her father. Craig and Carly approached, and Craig asked for a word alone with Dusty. Lucy left, and Craig told Dusty that he would make some arrangement for Dusty to see Johnny, and he would let their lawyers work it out. \n\n\nCasey and Alison were kissing, but Alison called a halt. Casey suggested that they take the \"sleeping together thing\" completely off the table; it was no longer an option until they had agreed upon it in a cool-headed, non-passionate moment. Alison liked that idea, and they went back to kissing. \n\n\nCarly told Craig that he seemed pretty proud of himself, and he responded that she ought to be proud of him, too. Carly called him a \"work in progress,\" and headed for the door. \"See you around, Carly,\" he called to her back.\n\n\n",
