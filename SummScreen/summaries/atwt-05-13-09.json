    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg got Eliza ready for a walk in the park. Paul asked where she was going, just as Meg's phone rang. She saw that the call was from Dusty, so she let it go to voicemail. Paul asked if the caller was Dusty, and he accused Meg of playing games again. Meg reminded him that she was through with games and was living with him at Fairwinds. \n\n\nShe began to wheel the stroller out, but Paul stopped her. He asked her what she had meant when she had declared that she was there with him to stay. He wanted Meg to define her position, and she suggested \"wife.\" \n\n\nCarly found Craig and Johnny having breakfast at the diner, and she joined them. Johnny was enjoying his waffles until Craig reminded him to go wash his hands because it was time to go to school. Johnny said he wanted \"Lulu\" to take him, but Craig said that was not possible. While the boy was washing his hands, Carly asked how Craig was going to explain that Johnny would not be seeing his sister anymore, but Craig refused to discuss his daughter with Carly. \n\n\nCarly told Craig he would regret shutting Lucy out of his life, but Craig said he would never forgive his daughter, and he asked Carly to drop the subject. Johnny returned, and Craig switched the discussion to Midnight Sun vodka. Craig had bought out Carly's share of the business, but he was hoping that she might come on board as a creative consultant. Carly invited him to lunch to celebrate \"new beginnings.\" As soon as Craig and his son left, Carly searched through her purse for a phone number. \n\n\nLucinda hugged a smiling Lucy at Memorial. Lucy had heard that her grandmother had a good checkup that morning, so she was pleased with that. She was not happy, however, that her father had vowed never to forgive her for siding with Dusty on the custody matter. She told Lucinda that she really missed Johnny, and, surprisingly, her father, too. Lucinda recommended that Lucy start looking for someone more worthy of her love, and she said goodbye. Lucy's phone rang, and it was Carly, inviting her to lunch. \n\n\nIn the Lakeview, Dusty ran into Holden and asked if he had heard from Meg lately. Holden said no, and he admitted that the family was worried about her being back at Fairwinds with Paul. Dusty feared that Meg was in way over her head with Paul, but Holden said to let him worry about his sister. Dusty suggested that Holden have a serious talk with Meg and attempt to get her to move out. \n\n\nMeg wheeled Eliza back into the living room, as Paul continued his discussion. He first wanted to know why he should believe anything Meg said lately, but she said it was best for their baby to have both parents living under one roof. Then she added that if they were married, it would be so much the better. \n\n\nPaul asked for specifics, so Meg agreed that they could have a small ceremony, if that was what Paul wanted. Paul inquired as to \"just how married\" they would be, and Meg answered that it depended on how things went. Paul told Meg that if she wanted to be his wife again, it had to be real in every sense of the word. It was all or nothing. Meg stepped closer to Paul, and he began kissing her. Suddenly Holden walked in. \n\n\nLucy arrived at Carly's for lunch, although she was surprised at the invitation. Lucy asked if Carly could get her father to forgive her, just as Carly's timer went off in the kitchen. She dashed to the kitchen as the doorbell rang. Lucy went to answer it, and there stood Craig. He immediately wanted to know if Lucy was there imploring Carly to intercede on her behalf with him. He then figured out that the shared lunch had been Carly's idea, and he announced that he was leaving. Carly spoke up and begged him to stay. \n\n\nLucy apologized again for taking Johnny away for several years, and also for using Craig's vodka company for her illegal smuggling. Craig asked why he should give her a chance to hurt him again, since she obviously didn't really care about him. He accused her of only wanting to buy time with Johnny. Carly argued that she did not know why Craig would give Dusty visitation rights to Johnny when he could not be equally as generous to his own daughter. Lucy was thrilled that Dusty could see Johnny on a regular basis. \n\n\nCarly continued on the theme that Craig seemed able to make sacrifices for one child, but not the other. Craig replied that Johnny had never broken his heart, and he wished he could say the same for Lucy. Lucy walked out in tears, leaving Craig angry at Carly for interfering in his family. Craig assumed that lunch was still on the agenda, but Carly called him names and told him his only redeeming quality was that he loved his children, but if he was going to throw away Lucy's love, then Carly wanted nothing to do with him. She opened the door and asked Craig to leave. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Lucinda saw Dusty in the lobby, and she asked him to make some time for Lucy, who was in emotional trouble. Lucinda said that Lucy was desperate for Craig to forgive her, but Dusty said he no longer wanted to deal with Craig because he was trying to work out equitable visiting rights to Johnny. He also denied that he had any influence over Lucy's decision making, but Lucinda told him he was a blind fool if he did not realize how much Lucy still cared for him. \n\n\nHolden was shocked to see his sister and Paul kissing, and Paul went upstairs and told Meg he would wait for her there. Holden told Meg that it appeared that he had gotten there just in time, and he demanded to know what Meg was thinking. He was furious that she could even consider living with a nutcase like Paul. Meg said she had no more options, but Holden begged her to walk away with him. Meg refused to leave the baby with Paul, and she said she had to do things her way and find a way to live with Paul. Holden told her to end it immediately and to fight Paul for the baby. He walked away, disgusted. \n\n\nMeg went to her bedroom, and Paul joined her. He had put a bottle of champagne on ice, and he poured them each a glass. He proposed a toast to the two of them and began kissing Meg, but she was unresponsive. Paul reached into her bureau drawer and brought out some of her new lingerie and ordered her to put it on, as she had for \"him.\" Meg got angry and denied that she had slept with Dusty. She could not bear being so close to Paul, and he asked her why she had even suggested marrying him again. Meg said she could not stand it anymore, and even though she knew she couldn't take Eliza with her, she had to leave. She made it clear that she would fight to get the baby back, however. \n\n\nDusty went to his room, and Lucy knocked on the door. She asked about the deal Craig had made with Dusty about Johnny, and said that was the best thing that could happen to her little brother. Lucy was thinking of leaving Oakdale if her father was not going to ever forgive her. She told Dusty she was considering returning to East Africa, where they desperately needed doctors. She needed the answer to one more question, however; she wondered if Dusty could give her any reason for her to stay. \n\n\nShe questioned whether there might be a future for the two of them, but Dusty simply said he would always care about her. Lucy said goodbye; she was leaving Oakdale immediately. She went to her room, packed her suitcase, and called Lucinda for help. \n\n\nCraig refused to let Carly throw him out of her house, and he argued that he was not used to having his own flesh and blood lie and turn on him. Carly brought up all the times that Craig's extended family had forgiven him, and he finally admitted that Carly was right. He would hate to see Lucy leave town because of his own stubbornness. He told Carly to get in the car before he changed his mind, and they drove to the Lakeview. The desk clerk told them that Lucy had already checked out with no forwarding address. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Lucinda brought Johnny and his sitter to Lucy. Lucy held the boy and told him that she had to go on an extended trip. They said their goodbyes, and Lucy promised to return some day. The sitter took Johnny back to school, and Lucinda said goodbye to her granddaughter. Lucy rushed off to catch her plane. \n\n\nCraig pounded on the door of Lucy's old hotel room, but there was no one there. Dusty passed by and told him and Carly that Lucy was headed to East Africa to begin a new life. Craig was stunned. \n\n\nMeg brought her suitcase down to the living room in Fairwinds, and Holden appeared again. Paul, who was holding Eliza, told Meg that she was going to regret leaving. When Meg tried to say goodbye to the baby, Paul threatened that she would never see her little girl again. He vowed that if Meg walked out the door, everything would change. Meg fought back tears, but she walked out with Holden.\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, a worried Dusty talks with Holden and tells him that he should be worried about Meg's game.

Lucinda thinks that she will forget about that if she has love and a baby of her own in her life. Carly calls Lucy over for lunch, as she has also invited Craig.

He doesn't want her in his life and he can't forgive her. A devastated Lucy leaves and Carly wants Craig to leave himself.
