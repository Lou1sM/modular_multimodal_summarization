Bonnie overhears the two talking.  Marshall and Mr. Newman toast to his good fortune.  Bonnie walks over to Marshall and starts throwing accusations at him.  Marshall tells Bonnie that she is threatening him and he may have to get a restraining order against her if she doesn't stop following him around.  He tells Bonnie to stay out of his business or she will wish that she had.  Bonnie leaves The Lakeview Lounge and heads to her mother's house.\n\n\nBen brings Jessica home from the hospital.  While Ben is trying to get Jessica settled in, Bonnie comes in and breaks the news about Marshall having his charges dropped and being reinstated to practice law.  Jessica says that Stenbeck must have refused to testify at Marshall's trial.  Bonnie starts going off and Jessica settles her down.  She explains that she and Ben are going to be married and she is still healing from her wound.  She adds that she is not going to have time to go after Marshall.  Ben interrupts and says that he needs to check on something at the hospital.  Jessica says that she thought he took the day off.  Ben says that it won't take long.  He picks up his coat and leaves.  After he is gone, Bonnie asks if it was something that she said.  Jessica tells her daughter that Ben is going to The Lakeview to see Marshall.\n\n\nAt The Lakeview, Marshall and his lawyer are still celebrating.  Ben walks in and says that Bonnie was right; it is shark day at the pool.  Marshall stands up and asks if he will be seeing Jessica next.  Ben says that he won't be seeing Jessica.  Ben informs Marshall that he is to have no contact with Jessica what so ever.  He tells him that if he is walking down the same side of the street as Jessica, he had better cross to the other side.  Ben adds that if he needs to get in touch with Jessica, he can do it through their lawyer, Tom Hughes.  Ben hands Marshall a business card.  He asks Marshall if he understands.  Marshall takes the card and doesn't say anything.  Ben says that he will take that as a yes and he turns and walks out.  \n\n\nHal finds Barbara in Paul's hotel suite.  He questions her about paying Dusty to break up Paul and Rose.  As they are talking, Rose walks into the suite.  Barbara asks her what is she doing there.  Rose holds up an envelope and says that she has a note for Paul.  Barbara informs her that Paul is gone and she doesn't know where he is.  Hal has to leave and he warns the two women to be nice to each other.  After Paul is gone, Barbara starts accusing Rose of all her wrongdoing and tells her that she is the reason her son has left.  Rose reminds Barbara of the evil doing that she had taken part in.  Rose tells Barbara that Paul could forgive her after a time, but he will blame his mother for the rest of his life.  Rose walks out.  Barbara yells at Rose as she leaves, \"You are going to jail for my kidnapping!  Mark my words!\"\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Craig is reading the paper and finds out that Rosanna has put some pictures in the paper of the new designs that will be shown at the fashion show later that day.  Rosanna walks in and Craig starts yelling at her about the pictures.  He tells her that he did not want any pictures in the paper.  Rosanna informs him that he is not in charge anymore and it was her decision to run the pictures.  He says that by tomorrow they will be making knock offs in Asia somewhere.  He reminds Rosanna that Barbara had a big fit the last time Carly tried to have a showing of her designs and he asks Rosanna what is she going to do about that.  Rosanna says that she will take care of Barbara.  She starts to leave.  Craig stops her and asks her to please keep Barbara away from the fashion show.  Rosanna asks why is he so obsessed with Barbara.  Craig says that she is a lunatic.   He reminds her how Barbara acted at their wedding.  Rosanna says that is because he had kidnapped her.  Craig says that he did not kidnap Barbara.  Rosanna tells him again that she will take care of Barbara if that is what he wants.  He says that is not really what he wants.  He reaches out to touch her face.  He says that he wants his wife.  He says, \"I want you back.\"  Craig walks away and leaves Rosanna standing alone.\n\n\nAt Monte Carlo, Carly and her assistant are getting the clothes ready for the fashion show.  Carly's assistant can't find her scissors.  Jack walks in and Carly asks him to get her scissors out of her desk drawer.  While he searches for the scissors, Jack finds the information about the cabin in the woods.  After everyone leaves, Jack holds the piece of paper in front of him and reminds Carly that she was supposed to be honest with him.  Carly tells him that she couldn't tell him because she promised Rosanna.  Jack tells her that is the one piece of evidence that could convict Craig of kidnapping Barbara.  Carly says that Craig said it was investment property that he was looking into.  Jack laughs at her.  Carly asks Jack if they could talk about this later.  She tells him that she is not trying to put him off, but she is so busy getting ready for the fashion show.  Emily and Alison walk in and Emily tells Carly that she wanted to show Alison a real designer in action.  Jack says that he has to go and he will see her later at The Lakeview.  Jack walks out into the hall and calls Hal and tells him to meet him at The Lakeview.  Back inside the office, Alison starts to look around and tells Carly that everything looks so neat.  She asks if she can look in the back.  Carly tells her to go and explore.  Emily tells her not to try on any dresses.  After Alison is gone, Carly tells Emily that if it hadn't been for she and Rose this day would have never happened.  She adds that she could have gone to jail for what she did.  Alison walks around the corner in time to hear the last part.  Alison asks Emily if she broke the law.  Emily says, \"No.\"  Carly tells Alison that she loves Emily so much that it is criminal.  As they are talking, Rose walks in.  She tells Carly that she stopped in to wish her luck.  Carly asks if she is going to the fashion show.  She says that she isn't.  Emily tells her that this is what she needs, good friends and pretty clothes.  Carly says that she will understand after what happened with Paul.  Alison asks what happened with Paul.  Rose looks at Alison and then at Carly and Emily and says, \"Life happened.\"  Emily tells Rose that she and Alison will save her a seat and Emily pushes Alison out of the office.  Out in the hall, Alison asks Emily if she had something to do with Barbara Ryan's kidnapping.  Emily says, \"What?  Heavens no!  I am not as naughty as my kid sister.\"  The two leave to go to the fashion show.  Back inside the office, Rose and Carly are talking about what happened with Paul.  Rose gets a call from Hal.  He tells her that he has some information about Paul.  He tells her that he is at The Lakeview and asks if she can meet him there.  She says she will be right there and she hangs up the phone.  She tells Carly that she will see her at the fashion show after all.  Rose leaves the Monte Carlo office.  \n\n\nAt The Lakeview, Jack finds Rosanna and tries to talk to her.  She tells him that she is very busy and she can't talk now.  Jack shows her the paper with the information about the cabin in the woods.  She looks at the paper and then at him and says, \"Yeah, right.  Let's make it quick.\"  They go to a back room and she explains that she found the paper in the desk drawer at Fairwinds.  Jack asks how it got into Carly's desk.  Rosanna says that Carly had taken it and they decided to hold on to it and she must have put it in her desk at her office.  Rosanna says that Carly and Craig watch out for each other.  She adds that they have a little club called Monte Carlo and no one else can join.  Jack asks where is Craig now.  She says that she doesn't know.  Jack says that he is going to have to bring him in.  Rosanna says that she doesn't care and he should do whatever he has to.  Rosanna walks away.  \n\n\nBack in Paul's suite, there is a knock at the door.  Barbara, thinking it is Hal, opens the door.  Craig walks in.  She asks him what is he doing.  He tells her that he heard about Paul and he thinks that she should go after him.  Barbara tells him that she doesn't know where her son is.  Craig tells her that she has to go looking for him.  He suggests that she go to Europe and look for him.  Barbara says that she has no way of getting there.  Craig suggests that she use the Cabot Company plane.  Barbara says that Rosanna would never go for that.  Craig gives her his phone and tells her to call Rosanna.  Barbara calls Rosanna and tells her what Craig has proposed.  Rosanna says, reluctantly, that she could use the plane, but wouldn't she rather come downstairs and watch the run through for Monte Carlo.  Barbara says that she doesn't think that she can do that.  Rosanna says that she could come and watch as a consultant and she would get paid.  Rosanna hangs up the phone and goes to find Jack.  She tells Jack that she thinks that Craig is upstairs with Barbara.  Jack asks why does she think that and she tells him about the conversation that she just had with Barbara.  Jack grabs Hal and the two leave the room.  \n\n\nWhen Barbara hangs up the phone, she informs Craig that Rosanna wants her to come downstairs and watch the run through for Monte Carlo.  Craig stands in her way.  He says that she wouldn't want to do that.  Barbara says that Rosanna wants her to be a consultant and she is going to pay her.  Craig won't let her go to the door.  Barbara starts to yell that she is being restrained.  Jack knocks down the door with his gun in hand.  Craig jumps back.  Barbara tells Jack to arrest him.  She says that Craig wouldn't leave.  Jack tells Craig that he is under arrest for assaulting Barbara Ryan.  Craig says, \"Based on what?  Her ranting?\"  Barbara asks if she can go.  Craig tells Jack not to let her leave.  Jack tells Barbara to get out of there and Barbara leaves.  Jack looks at Craig and says, \"Tell it to the judge.  You're under arrest.\"  Craig says, \"And you just destroyed your wife's career.\"\n\n\nDownstairs, Hal tells Rose that he found out that Paul rented an airplane and headed for New York.  Rose says that makes sense because he has friends in New York.  Hal tells her that he didn't land in New York, he kept going.  Hal asks Rose if she has any idea where he may be going.  Rose suggests that maybe he landed at a small airfield and rented a bigger plane.  Hal says that he will check up on that, but in the mean time, Paul is listed as missing.  Hal asks Rose not to say anything to Barbara until they know for sure.  Rose agrees.  \n\n\nWhen Barbara comes downstairs, she comes through the lounge and Alison is at the bar getting a soda.  Barbara stops when she sees Alison and asks what is she doing there.  Alison informs Barbara that she got out of jail for good behavior.  Barbara says that her sister won't have that kind of luck.  Barbara starts to go by her and Alison steps in her way.  She asks Barbara what did she mean by what she just said about her sister.  Barbara says that she is going to jail for the kidnapping of Barbara Ryan.  Alison says, \"Emily didn't kidnap you.\"  Barbara says, \"Oh yes, she did and she is going to pay.\"  Barbara goes by Alison, but Alison doesn't let her go.  Alison jumps on Barbara and takes her down to the floor. \n\n\n",
