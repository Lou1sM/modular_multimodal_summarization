Katie freaks out, and is even more determined to find out what Pilar is up to. She and Henry agree to pursue the Russ angle. Back at the cottage, Mike tells Pilar that their one night of passion was just that - one night. Pilar pretends to be relieved that she and Mike didn't wreck their friendship, but there still is undeniable sexual tension between them. Jordan tells Rosanna he wants out of the marriage.

    "tvmega_recap": "Pilar pays Katie an unexpected visit at Deerbrook, assuring her that she and Mike are an item and showing her a picture of them in bed together. Katie is heartbroken at first, but once she talked with Henry, she got her old fire back, believing that Pilar's plan was to make sure that Katie was crazy. She and Henry are plotting a way to escape. Mike is troubled about making love to Pilar and reminisces about playing basketball with Katie while he was convalescing from his car accident. Pilar arrives with groceries and promises Mike that last night meant nothing and she just wanted to stay friends. Mike agrees. Barbara is with Jennifer and Paul waiting to be wheeled up for surgery. Paul and Jennifer drop the bombshell that Jordan married Roseanna, which upsets Barbara; but more for Jennifer than for herself. They accompany her to the operating room. Jordan greets Roseanna good morning in her suite, saying the guest bedroom was very quiet. They discuss the situation, Jordan warning her that he isn't a liar and won't play this game for very long. Roseanna promises him that Cabot will be hers by the end of the day and then they can work on a quickie divorce. He leaves to see Barbara in the hospital as Roseanna again tries to contact someone about finalizing the adoption. Carly meets Jack at the police station and assumes a call he is taking involves Craig, Jack quickly pointing out that he'll take care of Craig, but only after he finds out about Roseanna's adoption of Cabot. She tries to persuade him to back off, but he asks her to stand out of his way and not warn Roseanna that he's looking into it. She says that she will, provided Jack makes Roseanna aware and he agrees. Jordan runs into Jennifer at the hospital and tries again to apologize, Jennifer wanting no part of him. After thinking alone, he realizes that he's being unfair to Jennifer and when he talks to her again, he tells her that his marriage to Roseanna isn't what it appears to be. Carly comes to the hospital to check on Barbara and chats with Paul. They discuss Roseanna's sudden marriage, Paul noting that he thought the timing between the marriage and the sudden discovery of Cabot was odd. He then tells her he doesn't care how she got Cabot back and won't be causing any trouble, but wanted Carly to tell her sister that if she needs anything, he will always be in Roseanna's corner. Walker approaches them and tells them he has news about Barbara's surgery. Jack makes a surprise visit at Roseanna's suite, telling her that he only wants what's best for her and Cabot and needs to see the adoption papers. Annabelle Fettle shows up, with all the proper paperwork and piques Jack's curiosity with how extensive the paperwork is that she brought. When he leaves, Annabelle presents Roseanna with additional contracts that were for her eyes only, Roseanna disgustedly reading them and telling Annabelle, \"No way! Absolutely not!\"",
