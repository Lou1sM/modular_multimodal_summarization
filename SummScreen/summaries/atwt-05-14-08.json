Carly defended her actions and said she was just helping Lily reconnect with Holden after Lily's return. Jack told Carly she shouldn't meddle in other people's marriages, but Carly believed Jack was really upset because he wanted his life with Carly back. Jack said he didn't want to be back in Carly's house under false pretenses because it reminded him of all their fights from the past. Carly went on to say that she believed Jack's behavior recently had sent her mixed signals about their relationship and that he was jealous of her spending time with Holden. She told Jack he needed to be honest with her, but Jack argued he was only angry about her lying to Holden and tricking him into helping her babysit the kids for Lily. \n\n\nHolden and Lily held each other in bed and discussed their first night of romance since Lily's arrival back in Oakdale. Lily confessed that she worried something would come between them, but Holden reassured her that they would be fine as long as they were honest with one another. Lily knew that Holden would be upset if he found out about her scheming with Carly to get him back in bed. \n\n\nDown in the kitchen, Holden made Lily breakfast and complemented her on letting their reconciliation happen naturally and not trying to force the issue. He remarked that her patience offered him hope for their future. Lily told him that she was happy he was able to forgive her affair with Dusty and looked forward to their life together. After breakfast, Holden decided to go to Carly's to pick up Ethan, but before going embarrassed Lily and gave her a passionate kiss. Lucinda walked in and caught the two kissing. She smiled and offered to leave again, but Holden told her to stay and visit with Lily because he was on his way out. \n\n\nWhen Holden arrived at Carly's, he was greeted by a happy Carly, but an agitated Jack. Holden assumed that Jack and Carly had just had another fight, but after Carly kept asking how his evening was with Lily, Holden began to get suspicious. He asked Carly if she and Lily had planned his seduction. When Carly wouldn't answer, Holden asked Jack if last night was set up and Jack's silence told Holden everything he needed to know. \n\n\nLucinda was happy that Lily and Holden had gotten their marriage back on track and asked Lily how she managed to get back in Holden's good graces so quickly. Lily recounted her perfect night with Holden for her mother and Lucinda was relieved that Lily and Holden had returned to one another. Lucinda, not knowing about Carly and Lily's plan, reminded Lily to be honest with Holden because Lily's scheming and lies in the past had caused her marriage problems. Lily was annoyed by her mother's lecture, but Lucinda continued to warn Lily not to do anything she might regret. Seconds after Lucinda finished advising her daughter, Lily's phone rang and Carly told her that Holden knew about their little scheme. \n\n\nAs soon as Holden returned to the farm with Ethan, he asked Lucinda if she could watch Ethan while he spoke to Lily. Lucinda took Ethan to another room and Holden demanded to know why Lily had not respected his feelings about waiting until they were both ready before they started sleeping together again. Lily said she wanted to act like a real couple, but Holden was angry that Lily had used Carly to get him \"back in the sack.\" Lily reminded him that they had spent a beautiful night together, but Holden said he wanted things to happen naturally to secure their future. Holden went on to tell Lily that he wasn't sure they could make things works. \n\n\nLucinda returned and asked Lily what had happened. Lily told her mother that she ruined everything and didn't know how to make things better. Lucinda told her to try to then went to talk to Holden. Lucinda reminded Holden that Lily loved him, but Lily stopped her and said she could fight her own battles. Holden put an end to the conversation when he refused to argue with Lily anymore because it never made a difference. Holden got in his truck and left, and Lily told her mother she would work hard to fix her mistake with Holden. \n\n\nBack at Carly's house, Jack asked her to admit plotting with Lily was wrong, but Carly insisted she was just helping a friend. Jack told Carly that she failed to see that she had tricked Holden and him, and it made Jack feel like they didn't ever really know what was going on in their own lives. Jack insisted he would never let Carly trick him again. \n\n\nHolden and Carly ran into one another at Java, and Carly said she was just trying to make him and Lily happy again. Holden explained that Carly and Lily's lies never worked to make anyone happy in the end. Holden found Luke outside and the two discussed Luke's troubles with Noah. Holden told his son to never settle for anything but the truth in a relationship. \n\n\nCarly decided to go the police station and tell Jack he was right about letting Holden and Lily work things out. Jack apologized for being so hard on Carly, but she walked out after commenting that she was used to his judgmental way. \n\n\nWhile studying for her test at Java, Alison fell asleep on her books and woke when Chris phoned from Memorial to see how her cram session was going. Susan listened in on Chris's call as Alison told him she was fine, but truthfully Alison doubted she would pass the test. Once Chris was off the phone, Susan asked if the nursing program might be too much for Alison, but Chris reassured her that Alison was doing great under his tutelage. Susan thanked Chris for tutoring Alison, but asked Chris about all the gossip she had been hearing about him and Alison. Chris told Susan not to worry about the rumors and that he just wanted to help Alison get through nursing school. \n\n\nMeanwhile, at Java, a frustrated Alison put her head back on her books and closed her eyes for a quick nap. A short time later, Aaron woke Alison and offered her a coffee to help her wake up. Alison saw the time and began to freak out at the prospect of failing her anatomy exam. Aaron tried to build up Alison's confidence, but she continued to ramble hysterically about her class. Aaron decided that Alison needed to relax and convinced her to go for a ride on his motorcycle. The two cruised happily through the streets of Oakdale and finally stopped in the country, where Alison was able to relax. She thanked Aaron for knowing exactly what she needed. The two sat and talked, but when the conversation turned to Chris, Alison told Aaron that she had slowed down her relationship with Chris. Aaron was pleased to hear the news. Out in the open countryside, Aaron told Alison to close her eyes and he would read her some of her book, but as soon as Alison's lids shut she was out. Aaron closed the book and watched Alison sleep. Alison woke and saw Aaron had also fallen asleep. She saw the time and realized she had missed her exam. \n\n\nChris ran in to the head of the nursing program, Brenda, and asked if he could check out Alison's test results after the exam. The instructor said Alison had not arrived to take the test. Chris started to call Alison to find out why she had missed her examination, but couldn't get her on her cellular phone. \n\n\nAfter waking, Aaron took Alison straight to Memorial and Alison asked Brenda if she could still take the exam, but Brenda told her there were no make-ups. Alison began to cry on Aaron's shoulder as Chris looked on. Aaron comforted Alison and invited her to lunch. Susan saw the two talking and asked what was wrong, but Alison said she was fine and left with Aaron without telling her mom what had happened. \n\n\nChris found Brenda and asked her to let Alison take the test, but she said there were no exceptions. A nurse listened in the background as Chris convinced Brenda to give Alison another chance. After Chris walked away, the nurse commented to Brenda that doctors were always bullying people to get what they wanted. Susan overheard the conversation and was not happy that Chris had stepped in on Alison's behalf. Susan went to Alison's teacher and found out that Chris had interceded on Alison's behalf. Susan was not sure what to make of Chris's decision to talk with Brenda. \n\n\nChris found Alison and Aaron at Al's Diner and the two men began to bicker immediately about which one was really looking out for Alison, but she told them to stop arguing. Chris told Alison that he had managed to get Brenda to give her the test and Alison hugged and thanked him as Aaron watched, seething with jealousy.\n\n\n",
