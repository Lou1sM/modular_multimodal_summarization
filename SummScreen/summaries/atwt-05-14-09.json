Henry and Vienna spoke to their former friends, but Brad couldn't wait to get away. As they walked off, Katie's phone rang. \n\n\nCraig and Johnny visited Carly after school. Craig said that the boy was missing Lucy, and he wanted to know when she would return. Craig did not know what to say, and he was looking to Carly for guidance. Carly advised Craig to look at all the good things in his life at the moment, not the least of which was that he had his son back. She suggested that they celebrate with a dinner for both their families that night, and she already had a large pot roast on the stove. Craig agreed to invite his sisters. \n\n\nLiberty saw Parker in Java, and she asked him why he had not been at school all week. Parker said he hadn't felt like going, and then he reminded her that she no longer needed to care what he did. Liberty said she did care, and she always would. She explained that just because they were no longer married, that did not mean that she had stopped caring about him. Parker was bitter and sarcastic, and he refused to consider that getting on with one's life might include finishing high school. \n\n\nOn the Snyder farm, Jack worked on his laptop. Janet arrived home, and they discussed Craig. Jack was not pleased that Craig had weaseled out of another felony charge. He took his report to the police station and turned it in to Margo. The two of them discussed Craig, and Margo was sure that her brother was a changed man. She gave all the credit for his wanting to be a good father to Johnny, and said Carly deserved some kudos, as well. \n\n\nJack considered Craig and Carly a train wreck waiting to happen. Margo mentioned that Craig had invited her to a dinner that night at Carly's. Jack found that incredible, because it appeared that Carly was making his worst nightmare come true. \n\n\nCraig called Katie, much to Brad's chagrin, and invited her to Carly's dinner. Katie declined because she needed to go to WOAK at Kim's request, but she congratulated her brother on being a free man and especially for getting custody of Johnny again. Katie was not ready to explain the baby fiasco to people yet. Brad offered to take her to the television studio, and he reassured her how much he loved her. \n\n\nCraig told Carly that \"Katie and the Ox\" were not coming for dinner, but Margo would attend. Carly said that Sage had a sleepover, but Parker would be there. She told him she had also put a bottle of champagne in the refrigerator. Craig questioned her drinking, but Carly said that Craig deserved at least a toast in his honor. Craig helped her put out some food, and Carly discussed changing the insurance on Parker's car from hers to one that he could pay for himself. Craig asked how Parker was doing, and Carly shrugged and said it was hard to tell. \n\n\nLiberty returned to the farm, but she was distracted. She told Janet that Parker was ditching school, and she felt that she was to blame. Parker was ruining his life, and it was because of her. Janet called Jack and asked him to meet her at Carly's. Janet said it was about Parker, and it couldn't wait. Jack agreed to go. \n\n\nParker went home, and Carly told him that Margo, Craig, and Johnny were having supper with them, but Parker declared that he wasn't hungry. He went upstairs to see Johnny, just as Margo arrived, bearing flowers. \n\n\nBrad and Katie arrived at the television station and were surprised when Joe, the cameraman, began taping them. Katie realized that she had not told Kim about the baby that was not to be. Brad tried to stop Joe, but Katie freaked out and ran screaming from the room. Brad found her in an office, crying. \n\n\nAt Metro, Henry tended bar while Vienna was gloomy about Katie's pain. She wished there was something they could do for her. A stranger in the bar listened to their conversation and then interrupted them to offer help. He handed Henry his card and identified himself as an attorney who handled private adoptions. He said he had a woman client who was pregnant and looking for someone to adopt her baby. \n\n\nThe lawyer assured them that the mother was young and healthy, and the father was an Ivy Leaguer. Henry thought they might have found an answer for Brad and Katie. Vienna tried to calm him by telling him that Brad and Katie weren't even speaking to them, much less taking advice. Henry said he would talk to Brad first, but Vienna had her doubts. \n\n\nAt Carly's Craig poured champagne and toasted her, as Margo's phone rang. The caller was Brad, and he asked her to come to WOAK because Katie was in very bad shape. He asked her not to mention it to Craig, but he wanted her to come and try to get Katie to go home and get some rest. Margo said she was on her way, and she apologized to her hostess. Carly said they would have to drink all the champagne themselves, and they put a good dent in the bottle. Carly called the boys to dinner, but Parker stalled, so she and Craig had more champagne. \n\n\nJack and Janet arrived at Carly's, and Jack asked her if she knew how Parker was spending his days. Carly said he was back in school, but Janet interrupted and said that, according to Liberty, Parker was not showing up at school. Parker entered the room and tried to beat a hasty retreat, but Jack grabbed him. Everyone began talking at once, but Janet pulled Craig out of the equation by telling him it was none of his business.\n\n\nCarly asked Parker if he had been going to school, and Parker said no. Jack said he had checked the odometer on Parker's car, and the boy had put 500 miles on it already. Parker yelled that it was his life and his car that they were discussing, and he bolted out the door with Jack right after him. \n\n\nMargo tried to speak to Katie at WOAK, but her sister kept berating herself for ever trusting Henry and Vienna. Margo suggested that they consider adoption, but Katie was afraid the process would take forever. Margo hugged her, and Brad promised that Katie would be a mother someday. He took his wife home and urged her to lay down and get some rest. She said she was too tired to argue, and she headed for the bedroom. \n\n\nJack returned alone and said that Parker had driven away in the car that Craig had given him the money to buy. Carly cited Jack's distraction with Craig's phony smuggling charge as the cause of Parker's recent acting out. Jack, in turn, attacked Carly's drinking and suggested that if she had been sober, she might have noticed that their son was not going to school. Craig jumped in to defend Carly, who was screaming at Jack. Janet stood between the adversaries and suggested they find a solution for Parker. Jack warned Carly that if she could not get her act together, he would have to take over where Parker was concerned. He and Janet walked out. \n\n\nHenry knocked on Brad and Katie's door, and Brad opened it, but he immediately tried to shut Henry out. Henry blurted out that he might have the answer to Katie's problems, and he told Brad about the adoption lawyer, Mr. Quick. He handed the attorney's card to Brad, and Brad asked about the birth parents. Henry said the father had graduated from Harvard, but all that Brad had to do was to give the kid a steady supply of sports and never let him near a book, and Brad would never know he wasn't his. Brad said he was willing to try anything. \n\n\nParker barged in on Liberty at the farm, and he criticized her for ratting him out. He yelled that, thanks to Liberty, everyone was on his back. After all, Liberty had been the one who taught him to skip school in the first place, and she had called him a geek for caring about his grades. Parker said she was no longer his wife, but she was not even a friend. He charged out the door, leaving Liberty stunned. \n\n\nBrad talked to Katie, who was reluctant to get involved with anyone whom Henry and Vienna recommended. Katie asked why the birth mother wanted to relinquish her baby, but Brad did not know. Katie decided that a phone call would not hurt, so Brad called Mr. Quick, who took the call at Metro on his cell phone. Brad asked him where he had attended law school, and the attorney told him Columbia. He also volunteered to come to Brad and Katie's house to discuss the matter further. \n\n\nCarly was grumpy when she and Craig prepared to eat their non-family dinner. Carly was beating herself up for believing Parker. Craig hated to admit it, but he said that Jack had been really lashing out at him, not Carly. Craig said he deserved it for allowing Parker to have the money for his car. \n\n\nQuick arrived at Brad and Katie's, and Katie said that they would first like to meet the birth mother and hear her history before they went any further. The lawyer said that would happen as soon as he received their check for $10,000, which he called \"good faith\" money. Brad wrote the check after he saw the hopeful look on Katie's face. \n\n\nReturning home, Jack and Janet passed Parker. Liberty told them that Parker had been there and was really upset. She went to do homework, and Jack decided that the best plan was to take Parker's car keys away from him and set up a schedule to help the boy prove he was responsible. \n\n\nCraig and Carly finished dinner, and Carly said that Craig had no responsibility towards Parker, but Craig felt different. He had been the one to make Parker's car a reality. Carly cleaned up in the kitchen, and Craig wandered around the living room until he found Parker's car insurance form on Carly's desk. He read it, and murmured that perhaps there was something he could do.\n\n\n",
