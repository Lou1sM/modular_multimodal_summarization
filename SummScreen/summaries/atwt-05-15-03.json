Barbara Ryan had hired him to break up her son and his fianc\u00e9.  Molly goes on to say that Dusty won't be around long.  Agent Brackett asks how much money did he get and where is he going.  Molly says that she doesn't know.  Brackett asks if she can find out.  Molly says that she will do her best.  Brackett looks at her and asks if this creep got to her.  Molly says that Dusty was sleeping with her on the side while he was getting paid to seduce another women.  Brackett tells her to stick with him and they will see that he pays for what he has done.  \n\n\nAt Dusty's hotel suite, he is doing some fast-talking to the goon that works for the man that Dusty owes money too.  While they are going around and around, Lily knocks at the door.  Dusty tells the goon to wait in the other room while he talks to Lily.  Dusty lets Lily in and tells her that he wants her to buy him out as investor in Rose's beauty salon.  At first, Lily won't do it.  Then after she thinks about and Dusty tries to convince her that he is trying to do the right thing, Lily gives in and writes Dusty a check.  After Lily leaves, the goon comes out and Dusty signs over the check.  The goon tells him that he is still short.  Dusty says that in a few days he will have the rest.  The goon says that he has had months so what is different now.  Dusty has a flashback of finding the FBI Agent's business card in Molly's purse.  Dusty tells the goon that everything is in place and all he has to do is pry it loose.  The goon smacks his face and tells him that he only has forty-eight hours and he had better make them count.  The goon leaves and Dusty goes to the phone and calls Molly.  He tells her that he has been thinking about her and she says that she has been thinking about him.  She asks him when are they going to get together and Dusty says, \"As soon as you can get here.\"  Molly says that she will be right there.  After she hangs up the phone, she says, \"I don't know what game you are playing, but I am going to find out.\"  When Dusty hangs up the phone, he says, \"I need a big score, Molly girl, and you are it.\"\n\n\nWhen Molly gets to Dusty's hotel suite, there is a note on the door.  It is from Dusty and says that he had to run an errand and she should go inside and make herself comfortable.  Molly opens the door and says, \"Dusty?\"  No one answers.  Molly walks in and looks around.  Dusty is not to be found.  Molly sees some papers lying on the desk.  She walks over and starts looking through the papers.  She doesn't find anything.  She opens the desk drawer and starts looking through the drawers.  Finally, she finds a file and starts to read the contents.  She finds something and gets her cell phone and dials Agent Brackett.  As she starts to talk, Dusty walks up behind her and takes the phone from her hand.  Dusty asks, \"Why would a nice girl like you be working for the FBI?\"  Molly laughs, \"The FBI?  Dusty, is that some kind of joke?\"  Dusty tells her that he found Agent Dale Brackett's card in her purse.  She tries to lie and says that Dale Brackett is someone that she went to high school with.  Dusty tells her that is a nice try but he knows that she is lying.  Molly gives in and says that she is trying to get information on him.  She says that the FBI approached her for help and then he pulled a fast one on Paul and Rose and she said what the hell.  Dusty tells her that the guy that he owes money to is going to kill him and he needs her help.  She tells him that he has a lot of nerve and she grabs her purse and coat and starts to leave.  Dusty stops her.  He begs her for help.  He says that he has looked at his life and he doesn't like what he sees.  He tells her that he thought she would know something about that.  Molly finally gives in and asks how she can help.  Dusty asks her to keep the feds away and not give them any information on him.  She agrees and Dusty starts to kiss her.  She stops him.  She says that the deal is she will keep the feds away and nothing more.  She walks out and Dusty has a smirk on his face.  Out in the hall, Molly calls Agent Brackett and tells him that she needs to see him right away.\n\n\nAt the hospital, one of the interns is making fun of Dr. Hughes and the mistakes that he has been making.  Katie warns him to shut up, but he doesn't listen.  He has an audience of young nurses.  Chris Hughes walks in behind him and hears what he has to say about his father.  The nurses stop laughing when they see Chris.  The intern asks why are they not laughing.  It is funny stuff.  Chris says, \"Maybe it's me.\"  The nurses disappear and Katie tells Chris that she tried to get him to stop.  Katie walks away and Chris walks up to the intern.  Chris reminds the intern what his father has done for the hospital.  He tells the intern that he will never accomplish the things that his father has accomplished.  The intern apologizes but he can see that people are sticking their heads in sand about what is going on.  The intern walks away.  Dr. Decker had been listening and he approaches Chris.  He tells Chris that he handled the intern well.  He also tells Chris that if he needs to talk to someone, he is there.  Chris reluctantly starts to tell Dr. Decker that he is worried about his father.  He says that he is not as sharp as he used to be.  Dr. Decker tells Chris that he has noticed that too.  Chris questions him.  Dr. Decker tells Chris that earlier he heard Bob get confused about a medication.  Dr. Decker says that it was obvious that Bob tried to cover and he had lost focus.  Chris says that his father has been putting in a lot of hours lately.  He asks Dr. Decker if he thinks it could be fatigue.  Dr. Decker says, \"As opposed to Alzheimer's?\"  Chris says that he has been trying to avoid that word.  Dr. Decker suggests that Bob get some test.  He tells Chris that it could be something less serious, but it needs to be checked out.  He tells Chris not to take it all on himself and to keep him informed.  \n\n\nAlison shows up at the hospital and runs into Katie.  She tells Katie about getting into the fight with Barbara.  Katie tells her that she should be more careful.  Katie shows Alison around the hospital.  The whole time Alison is looking for and asking about Chris Hughes.  Finally, Katie has to take a break because her feet are killing her.  One of the nurses catch her sitting down on the job and tells her that a patient needs to have her blood pressure checked.  After the nurse leaves, Alison offers to take the blood pressure for Katie.  Katie takes her up on he offer.  Alison walks into the patient's room and tells her that she is there to take her blood pressure.  The patient doesn't respond.  Alison asks if the patient is ok and the patient clutches her chest.  Alison signals for help.  Two nurses run in and Katie drags Alison out into the hall.  Alison tells Katie about how the patient looked and acted.  Katie tells her that she saw a patient die last week and she is still not over it.  In the patient's room, Chris questions his father about the patient.  He tells his father that earlier when he consulted on this patient she was fine and then he left Bob alone with her and now she is dead.  Chris asks, \"What happened Dad?\"  Bob looks at his son with concern.\n\n\nAt The Lakeview, the fashion show gets underway.  In the lounge, Alison and Barbara are on the floor rolling around.  Hal rushes in and breaks up the fight.  Hal tells Alison to get out of there and go to work at the hospital before he has to arrest her for assaulting Barbara.  Alison leaves The Lakeview.  Craig comes in just as the fight is broken up and suggests that Barbara needs to go to the hospital.  Craig will do anything to get Barbara away from the fashion show.  Jack tells him that he is not going anywhere.  Barbara hears Carly describing her collection.  Carly says, \"Imagine a warm summer night.  A thousand stars sprinkled all around it.  Picture that, Ladies and Gentlemen, and you will be seeing the inspiration for my designs.\"  Barbara squints her eyes as she glares at Craig and says, \"Stars at night?  That is my idea.\"  Barbara starts to go into the room where the fashion show is going on and Hal stops her and reminds her that making a scene won't help.  Barbara doesn't care.  She breaks past Hal and Craig and rushes into the room.  Kim sees her and tries to stop her.  No one can stop Barbara.  She rushes into the middle of the fashion show.  She announces to everyone that this look is here idea and Carly Tenney stole it from her.  Carly whirls around and glares at Barbara.  She tells Barbara that the designs are hers.  Barbara calls Carly a no talent slut.  Barbara says that the concept is hers and the over all look is too coincidental.  Craig pipes up and says that this is his company and he will protect it from slander.  He walks over to Carly and tells her that Hal seems to be off duty and she should call someone to stop this fiasco.  Barbara walks over to him and says that he and his little tramp have been working overtime and he had her locked up while Carly stole the best work of her life.  Craig tells her that accusations are easy, but it is proof that she always falls short in.  Barbara says that she does have proof.  She asks Hal to go with her to her hotel suite so she has a witness.  Hal says that he will do anything to end this.  Barbara and Hal go up to her suite.  While Barbara is gone, Rosanna asks Carly if there is any truth to Barbara's accusations.  Carly reminds her sister what she had to go through to get the designs drawn.  Rosanna suggests that Craig stole the designs and he could have shown them to her.  Jack chimes in and says that Carly is a good designer and she doesn't have to steal from another designer.  Carly touches Jack face and tells him thanks.  Barbara returns with some papers in her hand.  She hands them to Rosanna and tells her that she drew these from memory a few weeks ago so she could show her son the work that had been stolen from her.  She tells Rosanna to decide for herself.  Rosanna looks through the papers and turns to Craig.  She says that Barbara is right.  The concept is hers.  Barbara asks Carly if she heard her sister who is the money behind her company.  Barbara tells Carly that she has stolen men and she has stolen money.  She adds that she has nothing of her own so she has to take from everyone else.  Carly says that she doesn't have to take this and she walks out.  Craig follows her.  Jack starts to follow, but Hal stops him.  In the back room, Carly asks Craig about feeding her Barbara's ideas for her designs.  Craig answers, \"The sky, the night.  That doesn't belong to anybody.\"  Carly begs him to tell her the truth.  Craig tells her that the company was in trouble and he would do anything to help her design.  Carly tells him that she is ruined and she has no hope of being anything now.  Craig tells her that the designs are hers.  The work is hers.  He adds that any resemblance to Barbara's sketches is coincidental.  Craig said that is the story and if they stick to that they will get out of this.  Jack walks in and hears them talking.  He says, \"So Barbara was right.  You two are in this together.\"  Carly turns and looks at Jack.  \n\n\n",

In all of the commotion, Hal came in and Barbara walked in and accused Carly of stealing all of her ideas. Rosanna believed Barbara's lie even though Carly denied stealing Barbara's ideas. Another patient died at Memorial. Chris questioned Dr. Bob about what happened because the lady was fine when Chris left the room. Chris confided in Dr. Decker the problems Bob has gone through recently with memory. Molly met with the Fed and told him that she would get the goods on Dusty. Meanwhile, Dusty was in his suite getting a check from Lily for the shop. Dusty signed the check over to one of his \"business associates\", but it wasn't enough money.
