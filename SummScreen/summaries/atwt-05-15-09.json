    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt Java, Meg and Holden discussed a meeting they had with Bonnie about trying to win custody of Eliza. Meg told Holden she felt like she was abandoning her daughter, but Holden said what Meg was doing was the right way to win Eliza back. Holden told Meg that Eliza wouldn't even remember what happened, because she was just a baby. Holden then suggested that Meg go back to work while she was waiting for the custody issue to be resolved, but Meg told him she wasn't ready for that. \n\n\nAt Lily's, Damian told Lily that his ships had been cleared to sail, so he had told Luke and Noah that they could offer their cruise for sick children, after all. Damian asked Lily to go with them on the cruise and be in charge of supervising all of the volunteers on the ship. Lily excitedly agreed. Holden and Meg arrived, and Lily relayed Damian's news about the cruise. Damian said they were working out the details and would start by assembling a medical staff, because the kids would need medical care. \n\n\nHolden suggested that Meg would be great for that, and that it would take her mind off of things. Meg reacted badly, saying the cruise sounded perfect, because she could skip town and probably wouldn't even think about her daughter while surrounded by other people's children. Lily said that wasn't what Holden meant. Meg apologized and said she knew that, but she thought she should leave. Meg left, followed almost immediately by Damian. \n\n\nLily told Holden that she had told Damian she would go on the cruise with him and Luke. Holden was unhappy about Lily's decision, particularly when he realized it had been Damian's idea. Lily asked if Holden was afraid she was going to sleep with Damian. Holden asked what Lily would think if he were going on a cruise with Carly. Lily replied that she would poke holes in the boat until it sank, but she said her situation was different, because she and Damian had been over for a long time. Holden said if Lily were away for days with Damian on a cruise, his mind would wonder about what was happening, whether he wanted it to or not. Lily said in that case, she wouldn't go. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Barbara arrived to visit Eliza. Paul told her that Meg had moved out. Barbara asked Paul what he'd done, but he insisted it was Meg's idea. Barbara told Paul he could still get Meg back, but Paul said he didn't want Meg back, although as long as he had Eliza, Meg would never really leave him. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Damian saw Meg sitting on a bench. He approached her and said he was sorry if he had contributed to upsetting her in any way at Lily's. Meg assured him it wasn't his fault. Barbara approached and was surprised to see Damian. She greeted Damian warmly, then said she had been looking for Meg, so Damian excused himself and left. \n\n\nBarbara told Meg that she had just come from Fairwinds. Meg asked how Eliza was, and Barbara said she was fine. Barbara said Paul was miserable without Meg, but Meg said Paul had brought it on himself. Barbara said that Paul thought Meg was having an affair with Dusty. Meg said that was all in Paul's head and that she was going to use every resource she had to keep Paul away from Eliza. \n\n\nBarbara asked Meg to show some compassion, but Meg replied that Paul hadn't shown her any, and that Paul had even made her beg to stay in the same house as Eliza. Meg asked Barbara whether that reminded her of anyone, and Barbara replied that Paul was not the same as James. Meg said she wasn't so sure about that. Meg said that although she knew Paul was Barbara's son, Eliza was Barbara's granddaughter, and Meg didn't think Barbara would want Eliza to be raised in that type of environment. \n\n\nBarbara said she thought maybe Meg was right, and she asked what she could do to help. Meg asked how she knew she could trust Barbara. Barbara replied that she was Eliza's grandmother and wanted what was best for Eliza. \n\n\nMeg asked Barbara to move into Fairwinds to look after Eliza. Barbara didn't think Paul would allow that and asked why Meg didn't just move back in herself. Meg said that for the sake of her own sanity, she couldn't, but she was worried about Eliza being with Paul. Barbara didn't think Paul would hurt Eliza, but Meg pointed out that Paul had already started a fire in a house with Eliza in it. Barbara told Meg she would do what Meg asked and move into Fairwinds. \n\n\nMeg went to Java, and Damian was there. When Damian saw how shaky Meg looked, he got up and asked her to sit down with him. Meg did, and she told Damian she felt like she was falling apart. He asked if he could help. \n\n\nMeg said that she wanted her daughter back, and until that happened, she just wanted to escape. Meg asked how Damian had dealt with being separated from Luke. Damian said he had learned to distract himself, then he had started trying to help other people. Damian told Meg that the cruise could be like that for her. \n\n\nDamian and Meg went to Holden and Lily's house, and Meg apologized for her earlier behavior. Holden said he shouldn't have pushed Meg about going back to work. Meg said she had decided that Holden was right, and Damian had convinced her to help with the cruise. Meg went to call Bob Hughes to try to get the hospital involved. Holden told Damian that he must have said the right things to Meg, but Damian said Meg had just needed time to think it over. \n\n\nLily told Damian that she had thought it over, too, and had decided she shouldn't go on the cruise. Holden took Lily aside and said that he didn't want her to not go because of him. Lily asked if Holden was sure, and then she told Damian that she would go, after all. Damian and Meg left to make more plans about the cruise. \n\n\nLily told Holden that she knew he had only changed his mind because Meg was going, and she and Meg would probably be rooming together. Holden said maybe. Lily said she should be insulted, but Holden said she should be flattered, because he thought his wife was so attractive that a man would be a fool not to go after her. \n\n\nBarbara went back to Fairwinds and suggested to Paul that she move in, saying that it was hard to be a single parent. Paul said he had plenty of servants to help him. Barbara then said she was lonely by herself at the Lakeview. She said she could move in and help Paul with Eliza, but Paul said that Meg would be back soon enough. \n\n\nBarbara told Paul to face the reality that Meg wasn't going to return. Paul realized that his mother knew something, and Barbara admitted she had run into Meg. Paul told his mother to get out, but she said she wouldn't leave, because she knew that Paul always pushed people away when he needed them the most. Paul again shouted that Barbara should leave, and she did, after telling him angrily that he was going to lose everything. \n\n\nJack called Carly to tell her to give Parker the news that he couldn't drive again until he shaped up. When Parker went downstairs, Carly asked for his car keys and told him what she and Jack had decided. Parker said that his mother couldn't make him give her the car keys, and he walked out with them. Carly called Jack to tell him that Parker had gone, and Jack said he would be over. \n\n\nParker went back inside and asked Carly where his car was. Carly said she thought it was in the driveway. Jack arrived, and after he found out the car was gone, he suggested it might have been stolen. Jack called a colleague on the auto theft squad and found out where Parker's car was. Jack and Parker left, and they found the car in a chop shop, completely stripped. \n\n\nCraig went to Al's and told Janet that for once, he agreed with her husband: he shouldn't have given Parker money to try to buy some happiness. Janet warned Craig that kids needed boundaries and guidance. Craig agreed and said that Parker needed to be off the roads and back in school. \n\n\nCraig went to Carly's, and she told him about Parker's car. Craig said that if the car had been stolen, then Parker's options were severely limited. Carly suspected that Craig knew what had happened. Craig replied that because he felt that he had caused the problem by giving Parker the money to buy the car, it was up to him to fix the problem. Carly asked, \"By stealing it?\" Craig said Parker never had to find out it was him. \n\n\nJack went to Al's to tell Janet about the car. Janet found it interesting that Craig had been in the diner earlier that morning and had told her how things had a way of working out. She wondered whether Craig could have had anything to do with what happened to Parker's car, and Jack said he totally could have. Jack left. \n\n\nParker went home and told Carly and Craig about his car having been stripped. Parker said he would get a new one with his insurance money. Carly told Parker that his temporary insurance had expired just hours before, and Parker had never given her the paperwork to get permanent insurance. Parker then asked Craig to write him another check from the trust fund, but Craig said he couldn't do that. Parker said it was his money, but Craig said it wasn't Parker's money until Parker was 21, and Craig would prefer that the money be there for Parker in the future. \n\n\nJack arrived at Carly's and began goading Craig, trying to get him to admit his part in the stolen car situation. Craig said that Jack was again accusing him of something he hadn't done. Jack told Craig that he shouldn't have run his mouth off to Janet, because Janet had put two and two together. Jack told Parker that Craig had taken Parker's car. Parker wanted Jack to arrest Craig, but Jack said he couldn't, because there was no physical evidence. \n\n\nParker then told his dad to make Craig give him money to buy another car, but Jack said he couldn't do that either, because the money was in a trust, and Parker had put Craig in charge of it. Parker demanded that Carly make Craig give him the money, because Carly and Craig were together, and Craig was into Carly. Carly said she thought that she was helping Parker more by letting things happen the way they were happening. \n\n\nParker said they were all against him. Jack said they were all trying to help him. Jack said he would take Parker to school. Parker said, \"This sucks\" and walked out. Jack followed, saying, \"Yes, it does,\" as he passed Craig. \n\n\nAfter Jack took Parker to school, Jack went to Al's and filled Janet in on everything. Janet asked if Jack was going to pursue a case against Craig, but he said it was pointless, because Craig had covered his tracks. Janet was relieved and said it had all worked out okay, because it was a good thing for Parker that the car was gone. Jack said another good thing was that Parker could no longer stand Craig. \n\n\nCarly told Craig that she was not happy that he had intervened again. Craig said he didn't see the problem: they hadn't wanted the car to be there, and it was gone. Carly said that Parker would hate Craig, but Craig said he could live with that, and the next week, Parker would hate someone else. \n\n\nParker walked in with all of his schoolbooks and baseball equipment. Carly told Parker to turn around and go back to school before she called his father, but Parker announced that he had quit school. Carly said he couldn't do that, but Parker said that since he was 16, he could drop out, and no one could make him go back. Parker threw down his things and headed out again. \n\n\nCarly tried to follow Parker, but Craig stopped her, saying she wouldn't do Parker any good at that moment. Carly told Craig not to tell her how to parent her son. Craig asked if she had a better suggestion, but Carly told Craig that she didn't answer to him. She went to the kitchen and poured a stiff drink, downing it quickly, followed by two more in quick succession. After her third drink, Carly started to walk out of the kitchen. When Craig asked where she was going, she said she was going to find Parker. Craig said that Carly would only make things worse in the state she was in. \n\n\nAs Carly downed another drink, Craig said he didn't think he was the problem anymore. Carly asked what he meant, and Craig said that it meant that he had lost count of how many drinks Carly had consumed in the previous two minutes. He asked her to put the glass down and put the bottle away, but Carly shouted, \"No!\" and slapped him.\n\n\n",
