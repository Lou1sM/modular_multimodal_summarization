    "soap_central": "\n\nChris confronts his father about Mrs. Palmer's death at the hospital.  Bob gets extremely defensive at his son and tries to protect his career and reputation.  Just then, John Dixon walks up and suggests an autopsy be arranged for Mrs. Palmer.  John explodes, \"Yeah, sure!  Let's do that!  Let's find out what went wrong!\"  Then he storms off.  John asks Chris if anything is bothering him, but Chris deflects John's interest by explaining he's just concerned about Alison, then Chris walks away.\n\n\nSusan abruptly tells her mother that she's quitting her job at the hospital because she saw Mrs. Palmer die in front of her eyes.  Susan grabs her arm and says she just can't walk off the job because something frightened her.  Alison scoffs, and says, \"Of yeah?  Just watch me.\"  Susan tries to comfort her daughter, but Alison says she's not supposed to think about death for at least another eighty years.  Chris arrives and offers to drive her home.  Susan leaves, and Chris tries to explain that life balances out, but Alison rejects his solace and finds her own way home.\n\n\nDusty convinces Charlie to play Molly for some easy cash.  Dusty's plan is to make Molly believe his life is at risk, and he wants Charlie to put a fake hit out on him.  Charlie asks, \"How smart can she be spending good money to keep you alive?\"  Dusty assures him they can have the money by \"tomorrow night.  Then we can get outta this town.\"  Charlie warns Dusty not to cross him or the fake murder might turn into a real one.  Dusty tells him to rough up his face to make it look like he was in a fight, and Charlie obliges.  \n\n\nAt Al's diner, Molly tells Agent Bracket to buzz off and that she's through helping him with his investigation.\n\n\nAt the fashion show, Barbara explains why Carly stole her design themes.  She turns to Rosanna and says, \"I tried to warn you Rosanna.  I did.  I don't want to say I told you so.  But you see, Craig and Carly will stop at nothing to get what they want.\"\n\n\nAround the corner in the garment room, Craig tries to soothe Carly by telling her to stick to the story, \"We stick to that, we get out of this, huh?\"  Just then Jack walks in and accuses them both of conspiring together from the beginning.  Carly sees two choices before her, continue the lie, or tell the truth.  She numbly grabs hold of the truth, steps forward, and tells Jack, \"What Barbara said was true, Jack.  Her designs were plagiarized.\"  She is ready to continue explaining, but Jack interrupts her and says he could have helped her.  She tries to explain further, but he dismisses her, telling her to just \"save it Carly, save it!\"  He storms out leaving Carly paralyzed and her mouth hanging on the floor.  Craig chimes in accusing Carly of creating a disaster.  Carly snaps out of her stupor and tells Craig to look in the mirror if he needs to find someone to blame.\n\n\nIn the reception area, Barbara asks Hal, \"Where's Jack?!  He better be back there arresting his wife, or this department will be facing a lawsuit the likes of which they've never seen!\"  Hal grabs her and tells her to back off and give them time to sort the details out.  Barbar presses further demanding a police van to haul all the criminals away.  Just then, Jack returns to the room announcing the show is over and an investigation is underway.  Jack says Carly just admitted the designs were stolen from Barbara.  Babs waltzes to the center of the room saying, \"What have I been saying all along?\"  Jack says everyone is excused except for Craig, Rose, and Emily.  \"You three, stay put.\"  Craig clarifies Carly's story, \"She never said she stole them.  She had no idea until a few minutes ago that the theme of her show had their Genesis in Barbar's so called mind...\"  Craig admits he fed her the ideas, but the \"drawings are all Carly's.  The theme of the overall show was not hers.\"  Rosanna steps up and tearfully slaps him, \"It's unforgivable!\"  Hal painfully escorts his wife, and the others to the station as Jack looks for Carly.  \n\n\nMolly arrives at the Lakeview a little late for the show and finds Carly in the garment room tearing her clothes from the rack.  She is sobbing because she had no idea her inspiration came directly from Barbara, and now she won't ever be taken seriously as a designer in the fashion world after this mess.  \"I've lost everything!!\"  Molly tries to stop her, but Carly is driven with disgust and anger.  She sloth's all her clothes in a heap and starts to spray them with an aerosol.  Jack finds her in a fit and tries to pull the toxic can out of her hands.  She stops spraying, fixes her eyes on him, and says, \"This isn't the only poison in the room, is it Jack?\"  All three of them walk out into the reception area where Carly explains the entire truth.  Jack says that Craig already told him, and that bugs Carly that Jack will trust Craig before his own estranged wife.\n\n\nAlison arrives at home and starts to sob.  She prays to God.  Dr. Decker shows up and tries to connect with Alison.  She rebuffs him, until she unconsciously starts explaining what she saw at the hospital.  Dr. Decker tells her about his first time seeing a patient die and this seems to break through Alison's tough exterior.  She cracks a smile and begins to let her guard down.  Susan returns home and finds Alison settled down.  Susan offers to take Alison out for fries and a shake.  Alison thanks Dr. Decker for reaching out to her.  He tries to push further into Alison's heart. \"I'd like us to be friends.  You hate that your mom dropped her fat-head boyfriend in your lap and said deal with it.  Am I close?\"  He asks her if she believes in happy endings.  She asks, \"Why should I?  I've never had one.\"  \n\n\nAt the hospital, Dr. John finds Dr. Bob and shows him a mistake on Mrs. Palmer's chart.  Chris overhears the whole conversation as John tells Bob that this case won't be as easy to cover.  Bob can't believe that he put his ego before concern for his patients.  He says it may be time to think about stepping down as head of the hospital.\n\n\nKatie heads to Al's after her shift and finds Chris there.  She joins him and they start to reconnect.  Chris confides that his father may have made another mistake and that he wants him to get a check-up.\n\n\nMolly gets a call from Dusty.  He says he's in so much trouble, he doesn't know what to do.  Later in his room, Dusty is on the phone with Charlie when there is a knock at the door.  He turns around and his face is bruised all over.  He opens the door and Molly fawns all over him.  Dusty pushes her away and says he's going to be dead by midnight.\n\n\nAt the station, Hal asks Barbara to step away from Emily and Rose and go wait for the DA in his office upstairs.  On her way up, she has a parting shot for Rose, \"I'm sure you'll be quite colorful when you go down in flames.\"  Rose smirks as Babs bops her head back and forth as if someone tipped the head of a bobble doll.  Carly walks in, and walks right up to Craig.  Without saying a word, he opens the interrogation room door, and they both enter.  He asks her if she wants an apology, but it's too late for that.  He says all he ever wanted was for her to be successful.  \"Why?  Why go to all those extremes?\"  Craig whimpers, \"So you could have your dream.\"  Carly seethes, \"My dreams are none of your business.  I have life!  A married life!  You are not my husband!  It is not your responsibility to keep my dreams alive!  I would really like it if from now on you and I would have no connection at all whatsoever!  I don't want you!  I don't want you're help.  I don't want your business and I don't want your friendship!  I hate you for what you've done to me!\"  She storms out barely able to compose herself.  On her way out, Jack stops her and apologizes for not believing her from the start.  Carly can't keep her thoughts straight.  He offers to throw out the divorce suit, but she said if he wanted to do that, he would have done it already.  She turns to everyone and says, \"Do me a favor, all of you!  The next time one of you gets the urge to help me.  Don't!\"  The DA arrives and asks who is going to be arrested, and Barbara chimes in that everyone, including Jack should be taken into custody.\n\n\n",
