James has decided to send Rosanna to what sounds like a work camp so that she can know how the 'other half' lives in retaliation for her trying to run away.  Rosanna begs to see Cabot one more time, and while James does not agree to this, he does tell her that if she runs away again that she will never see Cabot again.  When he leaves, Craig tells Rosanna that he is her only hope and tells her that he needs money.  She is very reluctant, and for good reason!  She has trusted him before and been burned.  Craig, however, reminds her that he is the reason she has Cabot, and that without his help, she may never see Cabot again.  She reluctantly writes out her account number and access code and she is heartened when he begins to make plans.  He leaves her to deal with James by herself.\n\n\nWedding arrangements are getting a bit out of hand for Barbara, so when Katie drops by with a wedding present, she reluctantly accepts Katie's offer of help.  Katie has everything under control, and when Mike joins them at Lucinda's, Katie shares some hors d'oeuvres samples with him.  Barbara walks in just in time to see them feeding each other samples of wedding cake.  She is not happy, and walks out.  Later, when she catches Mike kissing Katie's cheek in a gesture of thanks, Barbara asks him if he isn't kissing the wrong bride.  Mike tries to assure her they are just friends, but Barbara isn't sure.  She believes her suspicions are confirmed when she catches Katie wearing Jennifer's veil and holding the wedding dress in front to see what it might look like on her....\n\n\nHolden is at home with Faith when Luke gets back from Washington, D.C.  Holden has hamburgers from Al's, and they sit and enjoy a family evening.  Luke has a lot of questions about why Lily isn't there, too, but Holden is reticent to tell him more.  Faith spills the beans when she asks Luke if he likes the new bracelet that \"Uncle Keith\" gave her.  Luke is not happy when Holden tells him what is going on, but the good news for Holden is that Luke is talking to him again and calling him \"Dad.\"  He tells Holden that it seems like they're on the same side again.  Holden is happy to hear it but doesn't really know what to tell Luke when Luke tells him it sounds like he's jealous of Keith.  Later, Emma drops by and asks Holden about Lily.  She is very unhappy to hear about her relationship with Keith and asks Holden how he can stand for it.  He tells her that Lily's social life isn't his concern any more, but he is concerned about Keith and that he has tried to reach her on her cell phone all day, to no avail.  Emma just can't believe that Lily would turn her cell phone off.....Holden tries again.....no answer.\n\n\nHolden may be right to be concerned.  Lily and Keith are very close to making love when a storm blows their tent away and forces them to run to the cockpit of Keith's plane.  Lily takes it as a sign that they should not be together, but Keith works hard to convince her otherwise.  Just after he leaves to inspect the aircraft, his cell phone rings and Lily answers.  It is Les, who has some advice for her.  He tells her to watch her back, that Keith killed Julia and he won't hesitate to kill her.  He also threatens Keith and tells Lily that he will take what Keith loves the most and destroy it.  Les is still on the phone when Keith returns.  They fight, and when Keith hangs up, he tells Lily to ignore what Les said.  He went on to say that when he wanted something, that he didn't give up and that he wants Lily more than he has ever wanted anything.  Before he kisses her, he tells her that they will be together and that they will be happy for a very long time......\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Holden is still bothered by the fact that he can't reach Lily by cell phone. When Luke returns home from his trip, he is confused as to why Lily isn't there. Holden tries to divert his questions, but soon Luke realizes Lily is with Keith, and that upsets him prompting him to tell Holden he and Lily are not acting like his parents, but more like people who not sure any longer what they want out of life. Soon, Holden and Luke bond when Luke thinks Holden is jealous of Keith, which Holden tries to deny. Later, Emma is upset when she finds out Lily has left for the night and suggests he try to reach Lily again by phone because Lily would never leave herself disconnected when away from her kids. Once again Holden can't reach Lily prompting him to say he no longer knows what to believe with Lily. A storm results in Lily and Keith stopping themselves from making love, which Lily thinks is for the best because she needs closure in her marriage before she gives herself totally to Keith. As they start to make their way back to Oakdale, Les calls Keith and Lily answers. Les tells Lily to watch her back with Keith because he killed Julia and admitted to planting the bee pollen in his truck. Lily defends Keith and doesn't want to hear anything he has to say. Les leaves her with a message to Keith that he will take anything Keith loves and put it in a meat grinder and give him a front row seat. Lily is shaken, but Keith blows it off, and diverts her attention by telling her he will wait for her for as long as necessary because he wants her and when he wants something he gets it. Katie seeing Barbara overwhelmed with wedding plans offers to help against Barbara's desires, and goes to work with the caterers. Mike shows up without Jen, who had to stay at the Street Jeans office to finish up some work, and he and Katie end up doing a cake tasting, which Barbara witnesses. Later when Mike kisses Katie on the cheek, Barbara sarcastically can't help but ask if Mike knows he is kissing the wrong bride. After Mike leaves to pick up Jen for her fitting, Barbara again is disturbed when she silently witnesses Katie trying on Jen's veil and holding up the dress while gazing into the mirror. Craig is determined to help Rosanna out of Bangkok with Cabot. Rosanna is unsure whether to trust him, but when James arrives wanting to take her to a labor camp, she will do anything to stall him. Once James leaves, Craig convinces Rosanna to give him her account and password information, which she begrudgingly gives him after she feels she is out of options. She leaves Craig with a plea that if he ever loved Cabot as his son, he will not take her money and leave her there.",
