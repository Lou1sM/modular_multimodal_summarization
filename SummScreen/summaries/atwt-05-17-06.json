Paul stepped toward her. He told her he was giving up all rights to the baby because he wanted to be with her -- and because he wouldn't make a good father. He offered to take her anywhere in the world she wanted to go. She promised to think about it.\n\n\nIn Emily's hospital room, Henry told her about the briefcase. He told her the police had it, and they would trace it back to B.J. Emily promised not to rat Henry out. Henry couldn't believe how sanely Emily was behaving. Hal arrived, read Emily her rights, and told her he would return the next day to take her into custody. Hal left. \n\n\nEmily told Henry she was keeping the baby. Henry told her all the reasons it was not a good idea. Emily said Susan would raise the baby because Paul was giving up his rights. She was glad Paul and Meg wouldn't be raising her child. Henry kept telling Emily how crazy she was before the incident and insisting it might help keep her from jail.\n\n\nIn the park, Jade and Will discussed families. Jade told him she had left home as soon as she could. Will looked as though he felt sorry for Jade. He said goodnight and headed home. Jade went to the library. She phoned her father and told him she was not in trouble or in jail, and she didn't need any money. She told her father she wouldn't bother him by calling again. Jade hung up. She lay on the floor, using her bag for a pillow and a jacket for a blanket. \n\n\nAt Hal's house, Gwen and Casey talked about her problems with Will. She told him Will was upset that she and Casey had fallen asleep. Casey offered to leave before Will returned home. Gwen said no because if Casey and Will ignored each other, things would get awkward. As Casey was leaving, Will arrived. \n\n\nWill told Casey everything was fine between them. Will walked into the kitchen and went upstairs without speaking to his wife. Gwen stood by the stairs and told him nothing had happened with Casey. Will returned downstairs. Gwen wanted to know what was troubling her husband, but he wasn't sure. She suggested they both drop out of school. He said he wanted to finish school and then get an apartment.\n\n\nAt Lisa's, Maddie prepared for a romantic evening with Casey. She fantasized about him. Her dream was a silent film complete with music and subtitles. She realized she had no condoms. She left to get some.\n\n\nAt the drugstore, Maddie wasn't sure what kind of condom to get, so she got a lot of different kinds, sizes, and flavors. While she was checking out, Tom walked in. She stood in front of the sales counter to keep Tom from seeing what she was purchasing. She said they were bandages for her ankle. She grabbed her bag and left. \n\n\nAfter Tom received the prescription for his grandmother, Hal walked in. Tom told Hal that Emily was in a lot of trouble, and they needed to prepare themselves.\n\n\nMaddie returned to Lisa's apartment. Casey arrived, and she tried to seduce him. He backed away. Maddie wanted to know if she had done something wrong. In his head, Casey heard his dad telling him to tell Maddie the truth about respecting her too much to have sex with her. Casey tried but left without telling Maddie the truth. Maddie was left alone and hurt.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Jade and Will have another run in, but it ends amicably. Gwen leans on Casey for support when she and Will have a fight. Maddie is busy preparing the hotel room for her romantic tryst with Casey. She remembers she forgot protection and runs to the pharmacy, where she almost gets caught by Tom with her private purchase. Will and Gwen make up. Maddie tries to seduce Casey but he makes a quick exit, much to the dismay of Maddie, who thinks Casey, must be repulsed by her. Henry learns Emily plans on keeping the baby and when Hal shows up to let her know she will be taken into custody in the morning, he offers her moral support. Emily promises him that she will take the rap for having BJ's briefcase of money. Henry is surprised to see the new, improved and remorseful Emily. However, always the schemer, he suggests Emily uses all her tools she has in order to keep her out of jail so she can see her baby before its 18th birthday. Paul pleads with Emma to talk with Meg, but she sends him away. However, when Meg goes out for some air, Paul is waiting. He wants them to run away; she is leery considering he has a new baby on the way. He explains Jess is drafting papers as they speak regarding his divorce from Emily and the fact he is relinquishing his parental rights. The more he talks, the more he charms her. He is willing to go all or nothing; if she gives him a name of a place where she would want to run away to and he has the same place in mind then they have to go, if they don't have the same place in mind then he will leave her alone forever. Meg answers Fiji Islands and Paul pulls out a pamphlet for that tropical getaway. Meg is thrilled; she jokes about if she had said Rome, Asia etc. He had emptied the travel agent's office of brochures. Meg can't help but smile as she tells him she will think about it. Jade calls home and is not met by a receptive father, who informs her she shouldn't call back. Jade settles in for the night; as she pulls her coat up to cover herself, at her new home, the town library.",
