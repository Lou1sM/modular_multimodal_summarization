She arrived and wanted to know where the food was, but Casey had a different activity in mind. He handed her a paintbrush and suggested that she help him paint the planters outside. Alison turned him down and walked out, but Casey caught her and brought her back. \n\n\nCasey promised that if Alison helped him, they could do anything she wanted afterwards. Alison agreed, and then she realized that she had picked up Emily's phone by mistake. Alison called Emily, who offered to send a messenger to do a phone swap. Hunter walked into the Intruder office, and when he realized Emily was talking to her sister, he volunteered to be the messenger. \n\n\nCarly slapped Craig, but managed not to spill a drop of her vodka. She refused to apologize, and she staggered around the kitchen accusing Craig of judging her. She grabbed the Midnight Sun bottle and told him to go to hell. They moved into the living room, where Carly berated Craig for ruining her day. When Craig referred to her drinking as a \"problem,\" Carly said her only problem was Craig. He told her again that he was crazy about her, but he was not about to stand by and watch her ruin her life and take down all those who cared about her. Carly swore she could stop drinking any time she wanted, and she ordered him out. \n\n\nJack said goodbye to Janet at the diner, and he said he would pick up Parker after school. Jack walked outside and ran right into Parker, who announced that he had quit school. He maintained that he didn't need a job because he had his trust fund, so Jack explained that it would be a long five years before Parker could have control of the trust. Jack promised that he would not throw Parker out onto the street or even ground him, and the boy was surprised. Jack told his son that he would have to figure things out for himself. Jack was amazingly cool and offered to always be there for Parker. \n\n\nHunter showed up at Casey's to trade cell phones with Alison. Casey got a call and went inside to take it. Hunter told Alison that he and Emily were getting along better, thanks to the advice Alison had given him. Casey returned and said that he had to leave for a while to drive a difficult patient in the senior van, according to a deal he had made with Jade. He suggested that Hunter help out with the painting until he returned, and he dashed out, promising to return soon. \n\n\nCraig and Carly argued loudly as Parker walked in. Parker said he was never going back to school, and besides, Jack had been just fine with it. Craig interjected his disbelief on that subject, and Parker wanted to know why Craig was even there. He told Carly to tell Sage to lock up her bike before Craig stole it and chopped it up. Carly spoke harshly to the boy, so Parker turned around and left. \n\n\nCarly put on her coat and continued to argue with Craig. She looked for her car keys and was determined to find Jack, but Craig knew that she was in no condition to be driving. He attempted to restrain her, but Carly screamed and fought. Craig overpowered her and confiscated her keys. He refused to leave her alone, but she continued to try to leave. She slipped and huddled in a corner, and Craig would not help her up. \n\n\nOut of the blue, Hunter asked Alison if she would go out with him, and Alison was shocked. She said it should have been clear to him that she was already dating someone. Hunter had no clue that she and Casey were a couple, and he stated frankly that she interested him. He was embarrassed when he realized his mistake, and in turning around rapidly, he dumped a tray of paint all over himself. \n\n\nLiberty found Janet at Al's, and her mother told her that Parker had quit school. She also mentioned that Craig had arranged for someone to destroy Parker's car. Liberty wanted to talk to Parker, but Janet urged her not to. Liberty didn't listen, however, and she called the boy and asked him to meet her at Java. \n\n\nCarly asked Craig to help her up, and he made her admit that she was in no shape to drive. She also said that she hated him. Craig encouraged her to beat her habit, but Carly said she felt too tired to fight. Craig assured her that he thought no less of her, and he sent her upstairs to rest. The doorbell rang, and Craig let Jack in. He wanted to speak to Carly about Parker, but Craig refused to allow that. He also told Jack never to accuse Carly of not putting Parker, or any of her children, first. Jack told Craig that he had a lot of nerve giving him orders. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker met, and she urged him not to drop out of school. Parker explained that not everything he did had to do with her. Liberty was hurt, and she said that she had thought he was much smarter than how he was acting. \n\n\nCasey returned home and asked about Hunter. Alison told him that Hunter had asked her for a date because he had no idea that Casey was her boyfriend. Casey did not like that Hunter had done that, but he did like the sound of being called Alison's boyfriend. Alison also described how Hunter had bumped into the paint tray and ended up multicolored. Casey laughed, but Alison felt the need to apologize to Hunter. The two of them began a good-natured paint fight. \n\n\nAt the Intruder office, Emily took a good look at Hunter and asked why he was covered with paint. He explained that he had asked her sister out and had no clue that she was with Casey. Emily offered him some clothes that Dusty kept at the office, and she helped him remove his shirt. She reached for his ear to remove some paint there, and Hunter suddenly locked lips with her. \n\n\nEmily shoved him away and asked him what had possessed him. She warned him never to do that again and advised him to get a grip. Hunter decided that he would be better off avoiding social situations in the future, but Emily said he was not completely hopeless. She offered to teach him social networking. \n\n\nAlison called Emily and asked to speak with Hunter. She asked him to join her and Casey for lunch at the diner, and Hunter agreed to meet them there. \n\n\nJack quizzed Craig about why Carly was in bed before lunch, and Craig said she was having a rough day and was suffering from a migraine. Jack told Craig that there was no way he was going to discuss Parker's problems with Craig. Craig apologized for crossing the line, and Jack stormed out. Carly came downstairs and asked whose voice she had heard. Craig told her and said he had covered for her. \n\n\nCarly assured him that she would be more in control in the future, and she gave him permission to dump the rest of the alcohol in the house. Carly said she was still tired and wanted to rest some more. She thanked Craig for being there for her and gave him a sweet kiss. Craig left, and Carly went back into the kitchen and rummaged under her sink. She brought out a new bottle of Midnight Sun vodka, and began drinking. \n\n\nJanet went to see Jack at the police station to find out how things had gone with Carly. Jack said he had not spoken to Carly because she was down with a migraine. He also said Craig had been guarding the fortress, but he had apologized for interfering. \n\n\nAt Al's, Casey and Alison kissed as they waited for Hunter to join them. Hunter peeked through the window and spotted them and turned around in disgust and walked away.\n\n\n",
