Upset, she left, but he followed her to Java, where they had a long talk about their relationship and why it hadn't gone to the next level yet. Casey reiterated all the bad things that had happened in his life after he'd had sex with Gwen -- the loss of his parents' trust, the loss of his best friend, the loss of his son, and the loss of his chance to go to the college of his choice -- and said that was why he was a little gun-shy. \n\n\nCasey told Maddie that he thought she was the greatest, but he was scared of what might happen if they moved too fast, because things were finally starting to get back on track for him. Maddie was happy that Casey had been honest with her about his feelings, but then Casey said he had to rush back to Crash to take care of some business, and she looked less than happy when he left.\n\n\nJade saw Will at the library and found out he had a biology term paper due that he had not even begun to work on yet. Jade suggested he find a paper on the Internet, buy it, modify it somewhat, and turn it in as his own. After some initial objections, Will succumbed to the temptation. Jade found a paper for him on ecosystems and printed it out. \n\n\nGwen arrived, and Will introduced her to Jade and told her that Jade had been helping him with his research. They talked about the fact that Jade needed a place to stay, and Will suggested Gwen's old place above Bert's garage. Jade said she'd check it out. Gwen hugged Will and told him how proud she was of him for working so hard to graduate.\n\n\nKatie found another St. Christopher's medal in a box full of Mike's old things and showed it to Carly. They decided to call local jewelers to find out whether Nick had actually taken another medal in to have the clasp fixed, like he had said he was doing, and they figured out that he had taken it to a jeweler near the police station. Katie had the jeweler deliver the repaired medal to her house, where Carly recognized a notch on the medal and determined it was the same medal that she had found in Nick's jacket pocket. \n\n\nKatie and Carly determined that meant the medal Katie had recently found was actually Mike's, and they assumed that meant the other medal was Nick's. That meant that Nick had been trying to cover for himself, not for Mike, if he had taken that medal from the evidence room at the station. Carly wondered why they had said the medal had had Mike's DNA on it, but Katie had written down what the report had said, and it had said that the DNA was \"consistent with\" Mike's DNA. \n\n\nPaul met with Jessica, who gave him the papers he had requested to relinquish his paternal rights to Emily's baby, plus his divorce petition. She questioned him as to whether he was positive about his feelings and whether he might someday change his mind and want to be involved in the baby's life, which wouldn't be possible after he signed the papers. He assured her it was what he wanted.\n\n\nPaul called Meg and left her a message telling her how much he loved her, explaining about the relinquishment and divorce papers, and asking her to go to the Fiji Islands with him. Jack entered as Meg played the message, and he tried to warn her away from Paul by comparing the two of them to him and Carly. Meg pointed out the ways in which they were different, but she said Carly and Paul were also very similar, having been raised by people like Ray Tenney and James Stenbeck instead of by someone like Emma Snyder. \n\n\nMeg told Jack that Carly and Paul didn't have the grounding Meg and Jack did, and that that was what they needed, looked for, and wanted from Jack and Meg. She said that was why they cared so much for them, and she suggested that Jack wouldn't be happy until he had gone back to Carly. Jack told her it sounded like someone had decided to go to Fiji.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Emily was moved to the psychiatric observation wing, despite Dusty's protests and complaints that Tom and Hal had let her off too easily. Paul showed up with the relinquishment papers and tried to convince Dusty that he'd had nothing to do with Emily's decision to keep the baby or with her being transferred to the psychiatric ward. Dusty was bitterly angry anyway, and Jennifer tried to calm him down by telling him that if he would just stay focused on her, the baby, and their future together, she would put Paul out of her life permanently.\n\n\nEmily was moved to her new room and found a sonogram picture of her baby; she cried to the nurse about how hard it would be to give the baby up when she had to go to jail. They left so that Emily could see the doctor. Paul found Emily's new hospital room. Although Emily wasn't there, Paul saw a file on the table by the bed and picked it up. Inside was the sonogram photograph they'd given to Emily. Paul was sitting on the bed, staring at the photo, when Emily returned. \n\n\nDusty, Jennifer, and Johnny were outside on the bridge, feeding the ducks, when Dusty asked Johnny if he thought his mom would marry Dusty.\n\n\n",
