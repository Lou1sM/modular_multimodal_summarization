He said that Brad and Katie had met with the adoption lawyer and were supposed to meet with the proposed birth mother later that day. Vienna was excited and decided they should give Katie and Brad a present, but Henry cautioned Vienna, saying it wasn't a certainty that the birth mother would agree to the adoption. Henry gave Vienna a present of her own: a video camera. He told her they could make movies together.\n\n\nHenry began filming Vienna, making a movie for their baby to watch after he or she was born. Vienna then asked for the camera so she could film Henry. She asked him to say something, and he began talking about how stupid he had been recently and how scared he had been about becoming a father. Vienna wanted to stop filming, but Henry asked her to continue. Henry then told his unborn child that he hadn't known how to love with his whole heart until the baby and Vienna had taught him how.\n\n\nVienna was touched by Henry's remarks. When Vienna turned off the camera, she kissed Henry, and Henry suggested they could make a different kind of movie about \"mommy and daddy's private moments.\" Vienna, however, had a better idea. She wanted to find out how Brad and Katie's meeting with the birth mother had gone, so she decided to go to WOAK to wait for Katie to arrive back at work.\n\n\nAt Brad and Katie's house, Katie changed clothes, trying to find the right outfit to wear to impress the birth mother. Brad began to wonder where the lawyer and birth mother were, so he decided to call the lawyer, Mr. Quick. However, each time Brad called the number on the lawyer's business card, he got a recording saying the number was no longer in service. Brad wondered what was wrong, and Katie said she would call Tom, who might know Mr. Quick, since they were both lawyers.\n\n\nHenry ran into Mr. Quick in Old Town and asked him how things had gone with Brad and Katie and the birth mother. The man told Henry that everything had been a big success. Mr. Quick said he was on his way out of town, so Henry thanked him and watched as he walked away.\n\n\nKatie hung up from talking to Tom and told Brad that Tom had said Mr. Quick had been disbarred from legal practice because he was a fraud. Brad couldn't believe it, but Katie told him it was true: they had been lied to again, and there had never been a pregnant girl or a baby. Katie was extremely upset and told Brad she wanted to go to work, so she could focus on something else.\n\n\nAfter Katie left, Brad made a call to his banker to try to put a stop payment on his $10,000 check to Mr. Quick. Brad was told the lawyer had cashed the check. Henry walked in, saying he had heard that congratulations were in order. Brad rushed up to Henry and shook him, asking how he could have done such a thing to him.\n\n\nBrad told Henry what had happened, and he also mentioned having given the lawyer $10,000. Henry was stunned and apologetic, but Brad didn't want to hear Henry's apology. Brad told Henry that if Henry wanted to help, he should leave Brad and Katie alone. Brad told Henry to leave.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Katie found Vienna waiting for her, with a present. When Vienna asked how the meeting with the lawyer had gone, Katie told her the lawyer had been a fake. Vienna tried to give Katie a hug, but Katie angrily told Vienna not to touch her. Vienna, acting desperate, told Katie that she and Henry had only wanted Katie and Brad to be happy. As Katie stalked off, Vienna tried to follow, but she tripped on a power cord and fell to the floor, landing hard on her belly.\n\n\nKatie and a production assistant rushed to Vienna's side. Vienna was in pain, so Katie asked the assistant to call an ambulance. Katie assured Vienna that she would take care of her and wouldn't let anything happen to the baby.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Katie called Brad to let him know what had happened, and she asked him to find Henry. Brad said he would, and he told Katie to take care of Vienna. Katie composed herself and went into Vienna's room. Vienna asked if Katie thought God was punishing her for having lied about the baby, but Katie told Vienna not to think that way. Vienna then asked if Katie thought the baby was okay, because the nurse hadn't said anything about the baby. Katie told Vienna that she didn't know.\n\n\nBrad arrived at the hospital, and Katie went into the hallway to talk to him. Brad told Katie that he hadn't been able to find Henry and that Henry wasn't answering his cell phone, but Brad had left messages at Al's and at Metro.\n\n\nKatie went back into Vienna's room to let her know they were still trying to find Henry. Vienna asked Katie if she was going to leave because Brad was there, but Katie took Vienna's hand and told her she wouldn't leave her. Meanwhile, Henry was at a poker game, trying to win $10,000 to repay Brad.\n\n\nAt Worldwide, Meg finished reviewing the medical files of children who were scheduled to go on Luke's foundation cruise. She gave the files to Damian, and she mentioned that one little girl's smile made her think of Eliza. Damian told Meg he'd been hearing very negative things about Paul, and he was surprised that a judge had awarded Paul custody. Meg said that had happened because Paul had lied about Meg's actions, and the one person who could back up Meg's story had conveniently disappeared.\n\n\nDamian told Meg that she needed someone as devious as Paul to help her find the missing person, and Meg asked if Damian was volunteering. Damian said that he wasn't devious anymore, but Meg said she had heard otherwise. Damian reminded Meg that Meg's brother Holden was not his biggest fan.\n\n\nDusty walked into the Worldwide office and asked Meg what she was doing there. She explained to him about the cruise, and Dusty told Damian he'd been hearing good things about the foundation. Damian told Dusty that Meg was one of the good things about the foundation, then he excused himself and left.\n\n\nAfter Damian left, Meg told Dusty that he had been right to put a stop to her plans to deceive Paul, because it had been a dangerous plan. Meg said that she had moved out of Fairwinds and was going to fight Paul for custody. She told Dusty that she felt awful having left Eliza with Paul, but she'd had no choice. Dusty wanted to know what Paul had done to drive Meg out of the house, and Meg reluctantly told him that Paul had expected her to act as his wife, in every way, and she had been unable to do that. Dusty told Meg she had nothing to be ashamed of, and they hugged.\n\n\nMeg asked Dusty to promise not to go after Paul, and Dusty quickly promised. When Meg said that seemed too easy, Dusty said he was gentler now. Meg asked why, and he told her about Craig's agreement to let him see Johnny. Meg hugged Dusty again, to express her happiness at that news, and then she asked Dusty if Lucy had brokered that arrangement. Dusty told Meg that Lucy had decided to leave town. Dusty then asked if Meg wanted to go somewhere else, as a distraction, and Meg agreed.\n\n\nDusty took Meg to Yo's to play pool. He reminded her that when she had first returned to Oakdale, they had gone to Yo's to shoot pool. He said that at that time, as he had watched Meg stretch across the table, he had asked himself how someone with such a \"killer body\" could be such a lousy pool player. Meg laughed and reminded Dusty that he was supposed to be nice to her, but when Dusty moved closer, she told him they couldn't kiss.\n\n\nMeg told Dusty that she was worried that Paul might be having her followed, and since Paul hated Dusty, she didn't want to risk doing anything that Paul would try to use against her. Dusty told her that wasn't how Paul would handle the situation. He thought Paul would let Meg stew for a couple of days, then he would try to use Eliza to get to Meg.\n\n\nDusty asked Meg if she wanted to go back to his place. Meg said she would love to, because she would love to have one moment when she could forget what was going on with Paul and Eliza. But Meg said if one picture of her with Dusty turned up in court, it could cost her the custody of her daughter, and for that, she would never forgive Dusty or herself. Dusty told her they would move to plan B, which was, \"When you're ready, I'm here.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn Old Town, Paul was sitting on a bench with Eliza when he spotted Sally, the babysitter whom he had paid to leave the farm the day he accused Meg of abandoning Eliza. Damian walked by and overheard Paul saying that he had paid Sally to leave town. Sally told Paul that he hadn't told her he expected her to leave town forever. Paul told Sally that his ex-wife was suing him for custody, so he couldn't allow Meg to see Sally. He led Sally away, and Damian followed.\n\n\nPaul took Sally to Fairwinds, and he asked her why she had returned to Oakdale. Sally said she was running out of money. Before Paul could answer, they heard the front door opening, so Paul told Sally to stay out of sight.\n\n\nDamian came in and shook Paul's hand, telling him how good it was to see him again. Damian spotted the bassinet and asked Paul if that was his baby. Paul tried to tell Damian that he was busy, but Damian ignored him and made up a story about having left a valuable family heirloom in the attic a few years earlier, when Damian had been living in Fairwinds.\n\n\nPaul told Damian he was welcome to return the next day to look for the heirloom, but Damian said it was something he was trying to sell, and the buyer was leaving that night to go to Latvia. Paul continued to try to put Damian off, but Damian ignored him and said he would retrieve the item quickly and get out of Paul's way. Damian left the room, and Sally came out from her hiding spot. Damian then overheard Paul telling Sally that he would give her another $20,000.\n\n\nSally asked for $50,000, and Paul agreed but said Sally would have to permanently stay out of town. Paul then told Sally to wait for him at Al's. Sally left, but Damian continued to eavesdrop and overheard Paul telling his banker that he needed to immediately withdraw a large sum of money.\n\n\nDamian called Meg and told her where he was and what he'd overheard. Damian told Meg that Paul had arranged to meet Sally at Al's in 20 minutes. Dusty picked up Meg's phone and asked Damian to stall Paul. Damian agreed.\n\n\nDamian went back into the living room. Paul said he'd forgotten Damian was there, and he asked if Damian had found what he'd been looking for. When Damian said no, Paul suggested that Damian ask Craig about it, because Craig had lived in Fairwinds for a couple of years after Damian left. Paul then realized that Damian wasn't actually looking for a piece of furniture to sell, and Damian admitted that he was actually just trying to delay Paul. Paul asked why, but Damian told him not to ask why, and not to take it personally. He then proceeded to hit Paul in the face, knocking Paul out.\n\n\nMeg went into Al's and spotted Sally. Meg greeted Sally warmly at first, but when Sally tried to deny knowing who Meg was, Meg accused her of having taken money from Paul to make Meg look like a bad mother. Sally tried to leave, but Dusty was waiting outside, and he stopped her.\n\n\nMeg called Damian and told him that she and Dusty had found Sally. Damian told Meg that he was waiting at Fairwinds with Eliza, because Paul was \"slightly indisposed.\" Damian asked if he should bring Eliza to Meg, but Meg said no, because she needed to take care of things legally. Meg asked Damian to meet her at the police station.\n\n\nPaul regained consciousness, and Damian told Paul why he had hit him. Damian then told Paul that he deserved whatever hell he got after having tried to brand Meg as an unfit mother when she was clearly anything but that. Damian handed Paul a bucket of ice, saying Paul would need it, and then he left.\n\n\nDamian arrived at the police station, and Meg hugged him and said she couldn't thank him enough. Meg told Damian the police were questioning the babysitter. Meg told Damian that she had already given the police her statement, and Dusty was giving his own statement. Dusty walked out, and Damian said that he had overhead Paul offering Sally $50,000 to leave town for good. Dusty asked the police officer who had taken his statement to take Damian in for a statement. Meg again thanked Damian for what he had done. Dusty then told Meg that they should go to Fairwinds to get Eliza.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul took Eliza and told her to take one last look around, because they wouldn't be coming back.\n\n\n",
