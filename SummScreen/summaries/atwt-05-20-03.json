The women left, and Marshall gave Craig his business card. Later, Craig proposed a solution to Evelyn and called Marshall Travers. \n\n\nAt Hal's, Carly heard Jack leave a message for her, telling her how much he loved her. Parker drew as a sad Carly wrote a note. Rosanna observed from the window when Will arrived home and startled her. Rosanna left, but soon after, alerted by Will, Carly rushed after her. Jack got Henry to recant his accusations, and Hal released him to get Carly. Jack found only Alison and did not see the note Carly had written that was under Parker's drawing. \n\n\nMarshall witnessed Barbara's delight in telling Sierra, Lucy, and Aaron that Craig was in jail. Sierra assured Lucy that she and Rosanna were giving Craig a reality check and letting him stand on his own two feet. Marshall wondered if Barbara was in trouble again, but she rejected any offer of his assistance. \n\n\nMolly drove Dusty to the old mill to hide out. She informed him that the FBI was backing off the case, since they knew Spangler was involved. Before Molly could leave, Spangler's thugs arrived and strung up Dusty, demanding money.
