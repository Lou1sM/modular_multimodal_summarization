Meanwhile, the bank officer arrives at Craig's suite to give him the money he has arranged to withdraw from Rosanna's accounts, but he insists (at gunpoint) that Craig must first provide Rosanna's password. Craig buys time by telling the man some of his history with Rosanna, after which he realizes what her password must be: myson. He is right, and the man gives Craig the briefcase full of money and leaves. As Craig counts the money, there is another knock on the door, and it is Mr. Q, who has the passport Craig wanted to buy.\n\n\nMya brings Rosanna a package, which turns out to be a work uniform that James has sent her to wear for her imminent new life at a work camp. Rosanna rips it to shreds. She tells Mya that she would kill James if she could, but Mya tells her not to give up hope, that Craig might still return to help her. When Rosanna questions why he should come back, Craig comes into the room and says, \"Because I promised I wouldn't leave you here.\" He then asks Mya to stand guard, and he fills Rosanna in briefly on what has been happening in Oakdale with regard to Jennifer and the baby and the fact that he was framed and forced to leave the country over something he didn't do. He promises Rosanna that he will get Cabot back, and she tells him she believes him. He leaves, telling her that James Stenbeck has met his match.\n\n\nAfter Craig leaves, Q comes to see Rosanna and wants to know why she's not dressed in the uniform that James sent. She says to tell James it wasn't her style. At that moment, a large man comes into the room and announces that he's there to \"pick up a package,\" which turns out to be Rosanna. When she refuses to go, he picks her up and carries her out of the room.\n\n\nOut on route 39, the prison transport van has had an accident related to a blown tire, and Les Sweeney has gotten away from Jack and shut himself back up in the van, even though Jack has told him that it's about to explode. Carly arrives on the scene and lunges at Jack, pulling him away from the van just as it explodes. They are both knocked to the ground and are briefly unconscious, but first Carly and then Jack regain consciousness. Jack wants to go back after Les, but Carly tells him there's no chance Les could have survived the explosion they just witnessed. She makes Jack promise that he'll never again do anything like that, and he does.\n\n\nKeith and Lily arrive at the police station looking for Hal, but they are told he's at Jennifer's wedding. They overhear an officer reporting that there's been an accident involving the prisoner transfer van, and they find out that both Les Sweeney and Jack were on the van. Keith wants to drive out to the scene of the accident to find out what's happened, but then Jack walks into the station with Carly and explains it to him. Keith insists that if Jack didn't see Les's dead body, there's a chance he's not dead, but Jack says that's impossible. Jack and Carly leave the room, and Carly tells Jack that she felt completely helpless when he went over the bridge with Starziak; he tells her he knows how that feels, because he felt that way about what Les did to Carly, about JJ breaking his leg, and about hearing how Parker had almost drowned in the pond. Carly pleads with him to stay safe and alive, and he tells her he's not going anywhere.\n\n\nLily tells Keith he's got to let this go now. She reminds him that Les is JJ's father, but Keith says he was no father to JJ and that Les means nothing. Jack gets word that the police have found a body in the wreckage, and he tells Keith that since everyone else at the scene has been accounted for, it has to be Les's body. Lucinda arrives, and Keith asks if she can give Lily a ride home, because there's something he wants to do. He leaves and goes to the accident scene, where an officer tells him it looks like the van had a tire blow out. Back at the station, Lucinda tries to convince Lily that Les's death doesn't mean it's all over as far as Keith is concerned, but Lily becomes exasperated and leaves. Carly tries to suggest to Lucinda that she should trust her daughter more; she says she trusts Lily much more than she trusts Keith.\n\n\nHenry and Katie drive to the airport to catch their flight to Hawaii. While Henry regales Katie with thoughts of what may (or may not) happen in Hawaii, she daydreams about Mike. They are pulled over for speeding, and when Henry tries to get Katie to hand him the registration, he interrupts her fantasy about marrying Mike, and she opens the car door and runs, much to the surprise of Henry and the cop who pulled them over.\n\n\nMike worries about what's happened to Katie, but Barbara insists that it's not his problem, and she says she'll fill in as matron of honor for Jennifer. Paul warns Mike that he'd better not ever hurt Jennifer, and Mike tells him he has no intention of doing so. Margo worries aloud to Tom about what's happened to Katie, but he tells her to live in the moment and stop worrying so much. The wedding begins; as the minister reaches the part about \"speak now or forever hold your peace,\" the door bursts open, and Katie walks in, apologizing for being late and blaming it on traffic. The wedding resumes, and Mike and Jenn exchange heartfelt words about their feelings for each other; when it's Mike's turn, Katie cringes with every declaration he makes of his love for Jennifer. Mike and Jennifer then exchange the traditional wedding vows, ending with the exchange of rings, and they are pronounced man and wife. Shortly thereafter, a pained Katie runs from the reception, and Mike follows her, asking her what her \"weird entrance\" was all about, as Henry appears in the doorway behind him.\n\n\nAt the wedding reception, Celia tells Will that this was the kind of wedding she'd like to have, and Will tells her that if it's what she wants, she'll get it, because this is America, where dreams come true. She hugs him in gratitude. Meanwhile, Casey has gone to find Gwen to ask why she's been trying to ingratiate herself with his parents; he demands to know who she thinks she is, and she responds that she thought she was his friend. When he says she's not and that he's not even sure if he likes her, she retorts, \"Well, you liked me enough to sleep with me!\"\n\n\n\n\n",
