Noah went to meet Luke at Java, taking the letter with him. Luke told Noah it was very strange that a letter that had gone missing when Ameera came to Oakdale had suddenly shown up again in a drawer in a house Noah wasn't even living in at the time he'd received the letter. Luke was positive Ameera must have something to do with it. Lucinda had given Luke a name and number of one of her contacts at the State Department, a man named Ben Coyle, and Luke thought they should call the man to find out more about Ameera. \n\n\nLuke and Noah met with Mr. Coyle, who showed them a file on Ameera that backed up her story about the many kind things Noah's father had done for her family in Iraq. When Luke asked if Colonel Mayer had had any contact with Ameera after her mother died, Mr. Coyle said only the money transfers and the phone calls from prison, but no face-to-face contact in several years. \n\n\nAfter the meeting, Luke and Noah walked through Old Town\n, and Luke pointed out that Mr. Coyle had said Ameera had been in town for several days before she approached Noah. Luke wondered whether Ameera had known Noah had gotten a letter from his father, and perhaps she had been following Noah around to find out if he'd be receptive to somebody who knew Colonel Mayer. Noah wasn't sure what was going on, but Luke thought they should find out. Noah thought they should ask Ameera directly. \n\n\nAmeera returned to the cottage with a bag of groceries and found Colonel Mayer waiting for her inside. He told her not to be afraid, and he said he needed a favor from her. When Luke and Noah returned to the cottage, Ameera was gone. They found a note she had addressed to Noah, and Luke read the note to Noah as they lay down together on the bed. In the note, Ameera claimed to have found another way to stay in the United States and said she and Noah could seek an annulment when the time was right. \n\n\nLuke pointed out that if Ameera was really gone, everything that had been keeping Noah and Luke apart was gone, too. Noah wasn't sure he could believe that, even though he wanted to. Luke said for the first time, it was just the two of them, and Noah asked if that was why his heart was beating so fast. Luke began to unbutton Noah's shirt and led him back into the bedroom. As they kissed on the bed, there was a loud knock on the door, and a man shouted, \"State police-Open up!\" Noah and Luke rushed to the door, where an Illinois state policeman told Noah that Colonel Mayer had escaped from custody earlier that morning. \n\n\nBrad and Katie \"christened\" every room of their new house, which made Brad declare it the best home he'd ever had. Katie then left for work, while Brad said he would stay home and paint the living room. Katie went to the Lakeview to take Liberty to school, but Liberty was still in bed. Katie told Janet that she would be picking Liberty up from school, because Brad was home painting. Katie then left with Liberty, and Janet found her way into the kitchen at the Lakeview, so she could prepare a meal for Brad. \n\n\nWhile driving Liberty to school, Katie told Liberty that she knew about Liberty's evening with Parker at the hotel the night Metro had its reopening. Katie told Liberty the room service bill had been enormous, and Katie said she would have to tell Brad about it. Liberty didn't think Brad would care. Katie said Brad would care because Liberty had broken the rules, specifically the one about not having visitors in her hotel room. Liberty said Parker was basically family, so he didn't count as a visitor. \n\n\nKatie dropped Liberty off at school and then called Jack and asked him to meet her at WOAK. There, Katie told Jack that Parker had actually been with Liberty the night of the Metro party. Jack was disappointed to hear that news. Katie apologized, saying Liberty was basically just testing her and Brad. \n\n\nJanet arrived at Brad and Katie's house bearing a dish of lasagna and pudding for dessert. A shirtless Brad was up on a ladder, painting, when Janet walked in. Janet asked why it was so hot in there, and Brad said he'd blown out the air conditioning when he was messing with some wiring. Janet took off her jacket, revealing the much sexier dress she was wearing under it, and asked Brad if he felt like having \"a little Italian.\" Brad told Janet how beautiful she looked but said he had changed his ways and was happily married to Katie. Janet smacked Brad on the side of the head and told him she meant an Italian meal. \n\n\nJanet then served Brad the lasagna and explained how she'd sweet-talked her way into the kitchen at the Lakeview. Katie walked in and saw Janet spooning pudding into Brad's mouth. Katie told Brad to put his shirt back on, and then she told him about Liberty and Parker's night at the hotel. When she mentioned that Liberty thought Brad would be okay with it because Parker was family, Brad said he could see Liberty's point about that, and Janet agreed with Brad. Janet then told Katie and Brad to pick their battles with Liberty carefully, saying that interfering with Liberty's friends was a battle they were sure to lose. \n\n\nJanet told Katie she was sorry Katie hadn't gotten to try her lasagna. Janet told \"Bradley\" goodbye and said she would come back later to pick up the food trays. She left, and Katie said, \"Oh, Bradley, we have a problem.\" Katie told Brad the next time he had guests, he'd better put his shirt on, and she said in the future, Janet would have to call first before coming over. Katie said she knew how to pick her battles, and Brad rushed to kiss her, then told her, \"And you won.\" \n\n\nCarly found a flyer in Parker's backpack and realized the school's spring dance was coming up soon. She asked Parker why he hadn't told her about the dance, and he said he wasn't even sure he was going to go to it. Carly said the school wanted to know whether she or Jack could chaperone. Jack arrived, and Carly showed him the flyer. Jack thought he and Carly should volunteer to chaperone together, but Carly said she wouldn't do anything that would give people the impression she and Jack were a \"couple.\" Jack thought that was ridiculous, but Carly insisted she would chaperone on her own. \n\n\nHolden and Lily found out about the spring dance when Faith asked if she could go. They said she could go provided there would be chaperones, and Lily asked if she and Holden should volunteer to serve in that capacity. Faith told them she didn't want them to do that, and Lily and Holden realized it was because Faith could see their relationship was rocky. \n\n\nCarly dropped Parker off at school as Holden dropped off Faith. Carly then told Holden she was going to chaperone at the school dance. Holden said he and Lily had talked about doing that, too, but Lily had decided it was a bad idea under the circumstances. Carly talked Holden into being a chaperone with her, saying that way, she would know at least one friendly parent. \n\n\nLiberty saw Parker at school and asked if he was going to the dance. He said he hadn't decided, and he walked away with a friend. Liberty caught up with them and asked again if Parker was going to go. Parker said yes, so Liberty said, \"Cool deal. I'll see you there.\" \n\n\nLucinda visited Lily at the farm. After Lily told her mother how poorly things were going with Holden, Lucinda suggested that deciding not to serve as chaperones at the school dance had been a bad idea. Lucinda told Lily that a high school dance might be the perfect opportunity for Holden to fall in love with Lily all over again. \n\n\nLucinda left, and Holden returned to the farm. Lily told him she hadn't understood what he meant before when he'd said he wanted them to take things slowly. She said they both wanted things to be different, but they would have to do something to make that happen. Holden asked what Lily had in mind, and Lily said she thought they should chaperone the dance after all. She pointed out that it was Faith's first dance, which was a milestone for their daughter, and Lily thought they should both be there for it. Holden agreed. \n\n\nJack called Carly and told her he wasn't happy with the way things had gone that morning. He told Carly she couldn't tell him to keep his distance from Parker. Carly said that wasn't what their argument had been about, that it had been about her and Jack. Jack said he was going to chaperone the dance whether Carly liked the idea or not. \n\n\nCarly called Holden to tell him that Jack had decided he was going to the dance after all. Holden said Lily had changed her mind, too. Carly thought that was great and made Holden promise to try to have a good time. Holden worried that Carly would be uncomfortable with Jack at the dance, but Carly assured him she was an adult and could take care of herself. \n\n\n",
