    "soap_central": "\n\n \nDusty, Meg, and Damian rushed to Fairwinds to look for Paul and Eliza. No one was home, but Damian noticed that Paul's desk drawer was open. Meg said that Paul kept his passport in that drawer. Dusty searched upstairs, but found no clues as to where Paul might have gone. Meg was sure he was headed out of the country, and Damian added that when he had left Fairwinds earlier, Paul had been headed to the bank to pick up $50,000 to pay off Sally, the former babysitter. Meg told them that Paul banked at Oakdale National. \n\n\nDusty suggested that Meg call Jack and bring him up to speed, while Dusty would visit the banks in town. Meg called the police, but Jack was on a stakeout. The cop on duty declined to put out an all points bulletin on Paul because no one had any evidence that Paul had broken any laws. It was not illegal for him to leave the house with the baby. Meg was frantic, and a short time later, she received a call from Dusty, who was having no luck with the banks. \n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Vienna fretted from her hospital bed after her serious fall at WOAK. She was no longer in such extreme pain, but she was worried because Henry was not there. Katie assured her that the doctor would soon be taking a sonogram, and then they would know more. The doctor arrived, wheeling in the sonogram machine, and Katie went outside to wait. Brad found Katie in the hall, and, as usual, she blamed herself for everything that had gone wrong. \n\n\nThe doctor began the sonogram, and Vienna was excited to see the baby on the screen. Suddenly the doctor turned off the ultrasound, and gave Vienna the sad news that her baby no longer had a fetal heartbeat. Vienna dissolved in tears, as Katie watched through the window. She demanded that Brad go find Henry and bring him back, so Brad left immediately. Katie went to comfort Vienna, who was blaming herself and crying for Henry. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Henry was immersed in a high stakes poker game in the hotel, and he appeared to be on a winning streak. Brad knocked on the door and called out to Henry. Henry hid in the bathroom after asking one of the players to get rid of their unexpected caller. Brad explained that it was urgent that he reach Henry, but the poker guys all covered for him. As soon as Brad left, Henry resumed his place at the gaming table. \n\n\nDusty returned to Fairwinds and told Meg and Damian that he had missed Paul by only five minutes at a bank. Dusty figured out that since Paul was a pilot, he would probably charter a private plane rather than fly commercially. They all knew a private airfield on the outskirts of Oakdale, so Damian asked Dusty to stay with Meg, and he volunteered to investigate the airfield. He mentioned that he had \"contacts\" whom he could utilize if it was necessary to intercept Paul. He promised Meg that he would not let Paul leave the country with the baby. \n\n\nBonnie McKechnie arrived, summoned by a call from Meg, and she reinforced the police's position that Paul had done nothing illegal. His custody agreement gave him the right to travel with Eliza. Meg explained that Sally, Eliza's former babysitter, had given her statement to the Oakdale police, and that Paul was missing in action with a great deal of money. Bonnie agreed to file an injunction preventing Paul's leaving town while the custody dispute raged. \n\n\nDusty complained that they could not wait that long to take action, and Bonnie attempted to calm him. She finally left to procure the injunction, as Dusty paced and Meg agonized about leaving Fairwinds earlier without her baby. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Paul and Eliza stopped at a bench, and Paul transferred a wad of money from an envelope to his pocket. He asked the baby if she would like to take a ride into the sky on an airplane, and the two hustled off. At the private airfield, Paul approached the owner about chartering a plane to an unspecified destination. The man explained that the planes were not cheap to rent, but Paul waved his cash. Paul again refused to state where he was going, but he suggested the money was a sufficient amount to cover that \"technicality.\" Paul asked to inspect the plane, and he walked to the tarmac, leaving the field owner counting the cash. \n\n\nDamian approached the owner, who quickly hid the money behind his back. Damian introduced himself and asked about \"discreet\" rental arrangements. Then he specifically asked about Paul and the baby, and he offered to double whatever Paul had paid if the owner would keep Paul from taking off in a plane. Paul turned a corner and spotted Damian with the owner, who was busy denying to Damian that he had seen Paul. Paul ran to his car and unfastened Eliza's car seat, and he took off on foot. \n\n\nVienna dozed for a short while in the hospital, and when she awakened, she talked with Katie about wanting her baby back. Brad arrived with the news that he had not found Henry, but he did say that the doctor had said that Vienna could go home with them to rest. Vienna began crying again. \n\n\nBrad and Katie took Vienna to their house and got her settled in the guest bedroom. Henry finally showed up carrying a huge stuffed bear he had named, \"Mr. Fuzzy.\" He apologized for being incommunicado for so long, but he said it was a worthwhile hiatus. He handed Brad an envelope containing $10,000, the amount that Brad and Katie had paid the sleazy Mr. Quick. Katie emerged from the bedroom, and Henry showed her the money, too. He apologized for sending the phony lawyer to them and pressed the money on them. \n\n\nKatie noticed \"Mr. Fuzzy,\" and it made her sad again. She attempted to tell Henry what had happened to Vienna, but Henry continued to go on about how important their baby was to them. Vienna walked slowly out of the guest room and told Henry that their baby was gone. Katie explained about Vienna's fall, and Henry walked Vienna back to bed. Katie felt awful that Henry's heart was breaking. \n\n\nHenry went back out and asked Katie more questions about Vienna's fall. He shocked her by saying that it did not sound like an accident at all. Katie told him again that Vienna had caught her heel in a floor lamp, and Katie apologized for not being able to get past her feelings to accept Vienna's gift. Henry blamed Katie for everything, and he yelled and said hurtful things. Brad tried to calm Henry, but Henry saw the situation only one way. \n\n\nHenry went into the bedroom and got Vienna up. He helped her to the front door and refused to take back the envelope full of money. Katie agonized that everything that Henry had said was true, and she broke down in tears. She felt guilty about hating Vienna for being pregnant. Brad hugged his wife, but Katie was convinced that she had caused Henry and Vienna's misery. \n\n\nBack in their room at the Lakeview, Henry put Vienna to bed and urged her to rest. He turned on his video camera and watched the video he had shot the day before where he talked of their hopes and dreams for their unborn son. \n\n\nDamian returned to Fairwinds and reported that Paul had been at the private airfield, but he must have seen Damian and taken off in his car. Damian had found the car, however, and Meg asked to see it. Damian offered to take her, and Dusty said he would go to the police and start a fire under them. Meg cautioned her friend not to do anything risky. \n\n\nDusty went to the station and saw Bonnie. He asked about the injunction, and Bonnie said that the judge was signing it. She asked Dusty to back down and advised him that he and Meg had made some poor choices lately that had inflamed Paul. Dusty told her that Damian had found Paul's car near the airfield, and Bonnie warned that everyone needed to stay out of it. \n\n\nDamian drove Meg to Paul's abandoned car, and he rationalized that Paul must be carrying the baby in her car seat. Meg realized that she had a key to Paul's car, so she opened it up and found a bib of Eliza's. She began to cry, and Damian assured her that they would find Paul soon. \n\n\nPaul walked down a sidewalk, talking to Eliza, and he spotted a woman across the street. He looked again, and the woman strongly resembled his ex-wife, Rosanna. He went closer, but could not believe that it was she; after all, Rosanna was in a coma at a clinic in Switzerland. The baby distracted Paul for a moment, and the woman disappeared around a corner, but she peeked around at him and then took off.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n",

Damian promises to use his contacts at the airstrip to see if he can stop him while Dusty and Meg talk with Bonnie, who warns them to let the police and she do her job. Since Paul has custody and technically, he hasn't done anything wrong yet, they have to tread lightly, but based on the fact that the babysitter is talking to police, she can file for an injunction to stop Paul from taking any trips.
