Noah described his last visit with his father at the prison and then listened as the trooper explained that the authorities believed the Colonel had help from outside. Upon hearing the policeman's theory, Noah wondered if Ameera might have been kidnapped by his father. Luke thought the idea was ridiculous and instead believed Ameera might have helped the Colonel break out. Noah was convinced Ameera might be his father's latest victim. Luke mentioned the letter Ameera had left for Noah that morning, and when the policeman asked to see it, Noah lied and said the letter Luke was talking about was from months earlier. \n\n\nWhen the patrolman left, Luke asked Noah why he didn't hand over Ameera's letter. The two fought about Ameera's connection with Noah's father, and Noah insisted that Ameera was not involved in the Colonel's escape. Noah was certain Ameera would not aid the Colonel in anything illegal that might result in her being sent back to Iraq. Noah asked Luke to help him find Ameera. Noah located Ameera's cellular phone and saw that she had been making calls to New York. Luke looked the number up on-line and learned it was an address in Brooklyn. Noah wanted to go right away, but Luke said they needed to call the police. Noah said he could not risk Ameera being deported and sent Luke to check out the location while he stayed behind in case Ameera called. Luke kissed Noah goodbye and reassured him they would get through it together. Right after Luke left, Noah's phone rang and Ameera told him not to worry about her. When Noah started to ask Ameera questions, the line went dead. Noah immediately called the airlines for a flight to New York. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison was studying for class when Chris found her and offered to help her study again. Chris said he was available to be Alison's private tutor, and she accepted, but felt it was best if the two left the hospital separately to avoid any more gossip. \n\n\nAlison arrived at Chris' room at the Lakeview, and the two got down to studying for Alison's next test. As Chris quizzed Alison about the skeletal system, he reached out and touched her rib cage, and Alison nervously jumped out of her seat. She said she had made a mistake in coming to Chris' room and started to leave, but Chris asked her to stay. Chris asked why Alison was so uncomfortable with him touching her and asked her if she had a \"problem.\" Alison said her only problem was that Chris could not separate work and pleasure. Chris thought Alison's recent behavior indicated that she needed therapy. Chris told her that until she got professional help, they should not see one another, even as friends. Alison angrily agreed and left. \n\n\nCasey and Emily continued having sex in Emily's office, but were interrupted when Tom knocked on Emily's door and demanded to see her. Emily hurriedly got dressed, as Casey hid under her desk wearing only his underwear. After hiding any evidence from their recent tryst, Emily opened the door and welcomed Tom in. Tom immediately commented that he wasn't there to talk about Casey, but needed to speak with her about their son, Daniel. Emily sat down at her desk and as Tom discussed Daniel's plans for his summer break, Casey kissed Emily's legs and did his best to distract her. Emily was unable to focus on what Tom was saying and asked him to leave the brochures for her to look over before deciding. Tom agreed to go, but as he left, turned and talked to Emily about Casey's tenure in her office. Emily admitted that she was wrong to fire Casey and would gladly welcome him back to his job. Under the desk, Casey was happy to hear Emily's declaration. Tom said he had to go, but before leaving, Tom remarked that Daniel worshipped Emily. Emily was happy and surprised to hear what Tom had to say. \n\n\nOnce Tom left, Casey popped up from under the desk and commented at how lucky they were that his father had not caught them. Emily looked flustered and told Casey that their affair needed to end. Emily said their relationship was self-destructive, but Casey kept trying to seduce her. Emily told him to get dressed and then told Casey she could not be involved with him anymore because it would jeopardize her relationship with her son. She insisted that if Tom found out she slept with Casey, he would take Daniel away from her for good. \n\n\nCasey got dressed and asked Emily if she really meant he could have his job back. She said he could as long as he could be professional. Casey kept flirting with Emily and asked her what they would do if they \"got that urge again.\" Emily refused to be tempted and Casey agreed to be a good employee and kissed Emily's hand. \n\n\nPaul found Sofie in the BRO offices and said he was there to drop off the check to get her business started. Sofie was grateful for the start-up money and began to ask Paul for his advice. Paul said that Sofie should look to Barbara for any business guidance and he would only be a silent partner in her jewelry business. As the two continued to talk, Sofie became lightheaded and explained she had skipped lunch. Paul insisted that she take care of herself and invited her to dine with him. Sofie was overjoyed by Paul's invitation and eagerly accepted. \n\n\nPaul took Sofie to lunch at the Lakeview and they discussed her future business ventures. Paul gave her a credit card and told her to pick out a dress for her next big party. Sofie commented that Paul made her feel like Cinderella, but she flirtatiously added that she only needed to find a prince. Once lunch was over, Paul bid Sofie goodbye, and she watched him leave, obviously disappointed that she couldn't entice him to spend more time with her. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Barbara was shopping, but, once outside the store, she became so tired that she needed to lean against a bench for support. Lisa was walking through town and saw Barbara looking exhausted. She stopped and asked Barbara if she was all right. Barbara reassured her she was fine, so Lisa went into her store, and Barbara defiantly carried on with her errands. Moments later, Barbara felt faint and had to steady herself against a wall. Meg saw Barbara looking wobbly and rushed to help her. Meg took Barbara to a bench and asked her if she was all right. Barbara insisted she was just lightheaded from missing a meal, but Meg wanted her to go to the hospital. Barbara convinced Meg to take her back to the Lakeview so she could rest and get a meal. \n\n\nBack in Barbara's room, Meg helped Barbara get comfortable and Meg asked her again to get a nurse to look after her. Barbara said she would, but only if Meg was the one who took the job. Meg thought Barbara was offering her the position as a way to reunite her with Paul, but Barbara reassured her she only wanted to hire her as a nurse, and had no ulterior motives. Meg accepted the job, once Barbara guaranteed her that Paul wasn't behind the job offer. Meg told Barbara that she needed to rest for a few days to get her strength back and shouldn't work. Barbara agreed and phoned Sofie to tell her she was leaving town on business. \n\n\nAfter leaving Sofie, Paul called his mother and questioned if she was really leaving town. When he couldn't get a straight answer out of Barbara on the phone, he went to her room, and when he saw Meg, asked Meg and Barbara to tell him what was going on. Meg said she had run into Barbara in Old Town and helped her home, and then quickly left the room. \n\n\nPaul figured out Barbara was ill and wanted to know how sick she really was. Barbara admitted that she had hired Meg to help her through the rest of her treatments. Paul was shocked Barbara had hired Meg, but Barbara insisted she had done it for him. She explained that hiring Meg gave Barbara the nurse she needed and Paul the opportunity to win Meg back. Paul didn't want Barbara to manipulate Meg, but she insisted it was a win-win situation for everyone. \n\n\nPaul phoned Meg at the farm and, to avoid the restraining order, he stood outside her door and told her about Barbara's plan to reunite them. He said he could not go along with Barbara's deception and wished Meg well. He reassured Meg he would get his mother another nurse and thanked Meg for her help. Meg looked out the window and saw Paul standing there. Meg was obviously conflicted about her feelings for Paul.\n\n\n",
