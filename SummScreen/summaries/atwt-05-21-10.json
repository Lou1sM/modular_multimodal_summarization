Meanwhile, at home, Jack and Carly worried about Parker's situation until they noticed that Parker had ducked out. As they searched for Parker, Margo called to tell them that Parker had confessed to knocking Gabriel unconscious.\n\n\nWhen Carly and Jack arrived at the station, Margo said that Parker had confessed of his own volition. Jack and Carly ordered Parker to be quiet, but Parker said he was doing it his way. Carly dragged Parker into the interrogation room. Parker said that he wanted to get his confession over with, but Carly declared that he'd confess over her dead body.\n\n\nCarly tried to talk Parker out of making a signed confession, but Parker said that the incident was tearing him and his parents apart. He'd seen them fighting constantly about it, and he refused to be the reason that they broke up. Jack entered, and Carly uttered that Parker had confessed for their sakes.\n\n\nJack expressed pride in Parker's gumption to confess. Parker worried that Jack would lose his badge and that Jack and Carly would break up. Jack took Carly's hand and said that from there on out, they would handle things honestly. Carly added that they were a family.\n\n\nAn officer entered and took Parker to booking. Carly fretted, but Jack said that it was just procedure. Carly seethed that it was Jack's fault, and she'd never forgive him for it. Jack shot the blame right back at her for throwing him out and keeping things quiet. He felt that she should have gone to him sooner, and Carly retorted that if she had, then he would have just guilted Parker into confessing sooner. Jack abandoned the argument to go call an attorney.\n\n\nIn the headquarters, Margo was livid at Jack for keeping quiet about Parker's role in Gabriel's incident. Jack claimed that he'd been sorting through the facts, but Margo accused him of throwing it all on Craig to keep Parker out of trouble. Jack raged that Craig had committed arson. Asserting that Jack had sabotaged the case, Margo removed him from it.\n\n\nLater, the officer led Parker back to the interrogation room. Carly wanted to take him home, but the officer explained that Parker was in custody. Parker said that everyone was treating him well, probably because of Jack. Parker hoped that he hadn't let Carly down, but she said that he was the only person in her life who never let her down. She sobbed that she was lucky to have him, and she pulled him into her arms.\n\n\nDusty called Al's diner and ordered a \"Janet on whole wheat, hold the mayo.\" Janet laughed, and he stated that he'd be there shortly to collect on her offer for a date. After Dusty arrived with an armful of roses, he said that they'd look back at that day as the beginning for them. When Janet heard that the day was the 21st, she sadly recalled that it was Rocco's birthday.\n\n\n       Janet had planned a big party for Rocco to make up for the ones that they'd missed, and she expressed her sorrow over mourning a man that she'd been just beginning to know. While she didn't blame Dusty for the heart attack, she hadn't fully accepted how Rocco had died. Dusty figured that it wasn't the best day for a date, but she probably shouldn't be alone.\n\n\n       Dusty and Janet strolled through Old Town. Sitting on a bench, he asked to hear about her father's past birthdays. Janet was reluctant at first, but she lit up as she explained that her father would plant a tree to commemorate the birth of a new Ciccone. He'd photographed each tree on each child's birthday to show how much they'd grown. It was their family orchard.\n\n\nCrying, Janet said that when she'd gone back home, she'd seen that Rocco had planted a tree for Liberty after he'd met her the previous year. Janet sobbed that Rocco would have planted one for the new baby, but he couldn't. Dusty got an idea and asked her to go with him.\n\n\n       Dusty took Janet to the back of her apartment building to plant a tree in honor of the Ciccone tradition. Janet said she wasn't dressed for planting, and he teased that she liked to sit back and give orders. They playfully bantered as he dug the hole, and Janet sprayed Dusty with the hose. They wrestled for the nozzle, and laughing, they fell onto each other.\n\n\n       They kissed, but Janet pulled away. She thanked Dusty for his effort. Before they could kiss again, Jack approached to announce Parker's confession before Liberty heard it from someone else. Dusty sent Janet with Jack, and Jack welcomed the support.\n\n\n       Outside Gabriel's hospital room with Lucinda, Lily felt guilty about Gabriel's predicament, but Lucinda blamed Craig, who hurt anyone that got close to him. Lily insisted that their secrets were at fault, and Lucinda wondered what more Lily could to do for Gabriel, besides visit him and pay his bills. Lily revealed that she'd vouched for Craig in the police investigation, and Lucinda scoffed, because having Craig in jail would solve 99.9% of their problems.\n\n\n       Craig arrived, saying that he was sure Lucinda would love to see him in jail, and she readily told Lily to call security. Lily, however, saw no reason to.  \"Believe me, if I wanted your mother dead, she'd be out of your misery already,\" Craig quipped. He thought it'd be more fitting for Lucinda to die alone of old age, and that wouldn't take too much longer.\n\n\n       Craig and Lucinda bickered about Gabriel, and Lily told her mother to stop adding fuel to the fire. Craig asked the doctor for an update about Gabriel, and Lily consented to let the doctor speak to Craig. The doctor indicated that Gabriel was breathing on his own and his prognosis was good. Craig was relieved that Gabriel would make it.\n\n\nA perturbed Lucinda looked away when Lily touched Craig's hand. \"Don't you need to get back to your cave and hang upside down?\" Craig asked Lucinda. She said that she didn't take orders from arsonists and would-be murders. Just then, Margo called Craig with the news about Parker's confession. Before leaving the hospital to meet Margo, Craig instructed Lily not to let Lucinda anywhere near his son.\n\n\n       Lily urged Lucinda to leave with her, but Lucinda said that she had her own car. Lily warned her mother not to get any ideas. Lucinda claimed that she'd have to leave Gabriel to fate. The moment that Lily left, Lucinda sneaked into Gabriel's room.\n\n\n       Lucinda touched Gabriel's face and was startled when he awakened. She advised him to take it easy, and he asked if he knew her. She explained that she was a friend of his mother's, and she stated that Lydia had deserved much better than the likes of Craig Montgomery.\n\n\n       At Java with Margo, Craig expressed his excitement over his son's recovery. Craig assumed that Parker's confession had gotten Craig off the hook; however, Margo reluctantly reminded him about the extortion, arson, insurance fraud, and grand theft indictments. \"I welcome these hurdles, Margo,\" Craig said. Once he jumped them, he intended to undo all the mistakes he'd made, all the way back to Bryant. Craig asked Margo to be happy for him, because he'd prove all of his enemies wrong.\n\n\n       While Margo hoped that Craig had learned from his mistakes and would get the chance to make things up to Gabriel, she reminded her brother that he hadn't made an upstanding first impression on Gabriel.  She suggested that Gabriel had committed his misdeeds to imitate his newfound father. She implored Craig to repair the damage, not throw away the second chance that he could have with his son.\n\n\n       Margo and Craig went to the hospital and learned from Lily that Gabriel had awakened. For support, Craig asked his sister to visit Gabriel with him. Lily hung around at the door as Margo gently asked Gabriel if he remembered the incident. With a spiteful look at Craig, Gabriel muttered that he remembered everything.\n\n\n       Lucinda approached the door, and Lily told her mother that Gabriel had awakened. Lily thought that they should be grateful, because it could have ended badly for everyone.\n\n\nLucinda and Lily listened as, inside the room, Gabriel explained to Margo that, on the day of the fire, he'd recovered from the scuffle with Parker to find Craig in the room with him. Gabriel claimed that Craig had hit him, and Craig had stated that Gabriel would never get out of the Monte Carlo building alive. Craig was shocked at Gabriel's accusation. Lucinda turned from the door and stifled a grin. \n\n\n\n\n",
