A battered Dusty found her there and admitted he had been lying when he had said he didn't care about her, because he did. Hal showed up and informed her that Paul was dead. Rose went ballistic, and Dusty grabbed her up in his arms. \n\n\nBarbara was excited about Monte Carlo and started packing to go in search of Paul. Will visited, concerned about what he had heard. Barbara reassured him. She was going to find Paul and Jennifer and take them home. Hal discovered Barbara was gone. \n\n\nCraig told Rosanna he had agreed to sell Monte Carlo to Barbara. He convinced Rosanna to let go of Monte Carlo. She agreed only if he would allow Lucy to see Aaron and never fight about it again. Craig went off to make the arrangements while Rosanna told Emma that Craig wanted to make another go of their marriage. She stated cryptically that she had made her peace with Carly. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jack was worried when he couldn't find Carly. Katie filled in Mike on the events of the fashion show and assumed he would go off to find Carly. Instead, Mike said he was taking Katie's \"stay away\" advice. He kissed Katie in thanks, but she pointed out that friends didn't kiss on the lips. Mike agreed not to do it again. \n\n\nBonnie imagined her upcoming day of community service. Optimistic, Bonnie arrived at the center and was immediately put to menial work by the director, Troy. After knocking over a table with the center's lunch fixings for the kids, Bonnie met a beautiful but quiet girl named Sarah. Bonnie thought she was making inroads with Sarah but soon realized her overtures were for naught. She started to wonder if maybe she was in over her head. She lied to Isaac that her day at the community center had been swell. \n\n\n",
