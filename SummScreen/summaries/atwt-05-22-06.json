Katie pretends to be Nick's wife in order to get the necklace Nick brought to the jewelers. Katie finds out from Eli, the forensics scientist, the DNA they found on the necklace, could be from a close relative. Katie takes her concerns to Jack, who tells Katie that Nick has an airtight alibi the night of the murder. Nick goes to pick up his necklace at the jewelers only to find out his \u0091wife' picked it up. Mike finds Carly waiting for Katie inside his house and is immediately suspicious, but Carly covers for the most part. Dusty asks Jen to marry him, and she happily accepts. Lucinda offers to throw them an engagement party. Later, Dusty suggests he adopt Johnny, and Jen again is overjoyed. Emily finds Paul looking at her ultrasound picture; he claims he stopped by to bring her the divorce papers to sign. When she asks about the papers to relinquish his parental rights, Paul secretly takes those papers out of the pile, and claims Jess didn't have them ready. Emily is nervous Paul may be changing his mind. Henry comforts her and promises to help find out what Paul is up to. Susan and Meg have some words as she is clearing Emily's stuff out of Paul's apartment. Meg is there to surprise Paul because she has decided she wants a life with him. Paul arrives home shocked that she is there. He seems preoccupied by thoughts of the parental rights papers. Meg asks if Emily signed the papers; Paul lies by omission by answering that Emily signed the papers he put in front of her. Meg believes they are free to go anywhere the want now. Paul comes back to reality and tells Meg he is happy she came back; he had been envisioning his life without her in it and he realized his life would have been very empty without her. Henry makes a call to Jess' office and finds out that Paul picked up both sets of papers earlier that day. Emily is panicked about why Paul lied to her; Henry promises they will figure out what Paul is up to.",
