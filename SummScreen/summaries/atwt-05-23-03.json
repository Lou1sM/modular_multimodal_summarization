Alison questioned her about the lie and told her to talk to Chris about it. Katie did tell Chris that she had seen Bob that day and that he had been acting a little out of it. Chris went to John and told him to stop spreading rumors about his father. \n\n\nJohn said he wasn't slandering Bob, but he was looking out for the welfare of the hospital. Rick and John also shared words about Bob. Meanwhile, Bob went to Rick, who performed cognitive dysfunction and memory loss tests. He told Bob that he'd have the results in about a week. \n\n\nCraig went home, and Sierra told Craig to put aside his pride and to give Rosanna a second chance. She said that Rosanna \"gets it\" and knew what it was like to be a good parent. Craig didn't want to agree to Rosanna's stipulations because he said Aaron was wrong for Lucy. Sierra reminded him that it was Lucy's choice, not theirs. Just then, Aaron and Lucy walked in, and Sierra made Craig tell them that they could see each other. Aaron questioned Craig's intentions and was afraid that he would still make trouble for them. Sierra confirmed Craig's intentions by saying that she had two first-class tickets to Montega for them, so if Craig didn't abide by the rules then they were welcome to join Sierra. \n\n\nAt the farm, Rosanna told Emma that she'd had a fight with Carly the night before and had even told her to leave town. Jack arrived at the farm and questioned Rosanna about the last time she had seen Carly. He asked Rosanna for the truth and told her that he knew she had been at Hal's, looking at Carly through the window. Rosanna said she had been there, but once she had seen Parker, she had left because she hadn't wanted to yell at Carly in front of him. \n\n\nRosanna admitted she had said she'd be happy if Carly vanished, but she was not responsible for Carly being missing. Jack wondered about her scar and said he wanted to check out the story about her car breaking down. Emma said she knew that Rosanna wouldn't hurt her sister. Jack was convinced that Rosanna was lying, and he told her so. He told her that he thought she knew more than she was telling and that she'd better stay close to home.\n\n\nRose was very upset after learning about Paul's death, and Dusty tried to comfort her. She said it was their fault that Paul was gone because he had lost his will to live and, \"He deserved better from both of us.\" Dusty said that if Paul had lost his will, it had been because of him and not Rose. Dusty said that she just hadn't been in love with Paul the way he had wanted her to be. Dusty told Rose he didn't want her to be alone right then. \n\n\nHolden and Lily went to the beauty shop to comfort Rose. Holden told Dusty to leave Rose alone, but Dusty said he'd wait to hear that from her. Holden and Dusty gave each other a look that could kill, and then Dusty left. As he was leaving, Dusty said, \"Paul Ryan was my best friend.\" \n\n\nRose told Lily that she wanted to have a memorial service for Paul. Lily wanted her to go home with them, but Rose wanted to be alone for a little while. After they left, Rose called Dusty and told him not to leave town. He said he'd stay and help her get through the troubled time.  \n\n\n",
