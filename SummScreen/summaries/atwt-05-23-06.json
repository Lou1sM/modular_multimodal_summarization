Paul takes the blow then asks Meg if she'd consider raising his child with him. Meg isn't sure if she can. Will feels guilty about the \"A\" he got on his Internet-purchased paper.

Mike reminds Katie that she promised to stop listening to Carly's insinuations about Nick. Katie shows Mike the two medals and insists she only went snooping to protect Mike.

    "tvmega_recap": "Katie finds out Nick is on to her when she goes back to the jewelry store to return the necklace. Nick tells Mike about what Katie did; he tells Mike he thinks that Carly is corrupting Katie. Mike promises to get to the bottom of it. Mike and Katie fight about the methods she chose to use to find out about Nick and his connection to Mike's case. Katie promises she is done playing detective, plus she found out from Jack that Nick had a solid alibi because he was at the Wilderness Treatment Program for Troubled Teens during that block of time the murder took place. Something looks to be bothering Mike after she says this, but he keeps it to himself; he later calls his brother Mark to ask him a question about Nick's time at the treatment center. Will has reservations about turning in a bought term paper; Jade talks him down. Gwen shows up with Will's Biology teacher wanting to talk to him about his extra credit paper. Will is ready to confess when the teacher commends him on a job well done. Gwen thanks Jade for helping her husband research his paper. Maddie is upset again about her and Casey's relationship; Gwen counsels her. Later, Jade offers to get Will the answers to his Calculus exam. Meg is ready to sail into the sunset with Paul, or at least to the Fiji Islands. Paul cannot bring himself to tell Meg about not giving Emily the papers relinquishing his parental rights. Imagine his horror when she finds out from Henry. Meg is furious and punches Paul in the stomach, who is pleading with her not to leave him. She is devastated after everything he lied to her. He tries to explain he was trying to figure things out in his head before he told her. She thinks he was trying to figure out a way to ask her to help him raise his and Emily's child. Paul wonders if it wouldn't be that bad of an idea to raise a child together if he decided to go that route? Meg doesn't think she could raise his child with Emily. Henry reports back to Emily that they had a successful mission. He spilled the beans in front of Meg who knew nothing. Emily is excited because she feels Paul will have to make a choice, and for once she hopes and believes he will pick Meg.",
