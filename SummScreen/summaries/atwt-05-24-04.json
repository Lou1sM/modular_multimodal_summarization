They immediately know that Henry must be up to something with Katie, so they rush over to the hospital.   When they arrive, Nurse Rockwell informs them that Katie must have permission from Dr. Tanner to have visitors, even the visitor is her sister.  Furthermore, Nurse Rockwell had to sedate Katie when Katie became agitated because the nurse would not permit Katie to see Henry.  Margo and Tom demand to see Henry, threatening to come back in the morning with a court order otherwise. When Nurse Rockwell leaves the room, Katie finds Margo and Tom in the waiting room. Katie, obviously not sedated, hurriedly tells them that Henry was helping her prove Pilar's guilt, then Katie rushes away when she hears Nurse Rockwell approach with Henry.  The nurse wheels in a drugged Henry, telling Margo and Tom that they may have fifteen minutes with Henry.  Tom looks at Henry's chart and discovers that Henry is a voluntary patient, therefore Tom demands that the hospital release Henry immediately.  When Nurse Rockwell goes to start the paperwork, Katie reappears and tells Margo and Tom that Pilar had come to Deerbrook to show Katie a picture of herself and Mike in bed together. Katie begs Margo and Tom to listen to Henry as soon as the drugs wear off and he is coherent again.  Agreeing to pay attention to Henry, Margo and Tom take him home, and Wellington, the patient who calls himself \"Sergeant P. Mitchell Musgrove,\" sadly tells Katie that a secret agent from Planet Zarcon has stolen his pith helmet, leaving him unprotected.  Katie hugs him and reassures him that she won't let anything hurt him, but she does not see the helmeted silhouette in the background.\n\n\nMike's telephone rings, and Pilar answers to find Russ demanding that she get him out of jail immediately.  Mike returns, and Pilar concocts a story that she is afraid that Russ' lawyers will be rough on her in court.  Pilar suggests that she would like to make a deal with Russ, in which she will refuse to testify against him if he will promise to stay away from her.  Mike objects, and Pilar announces, \"I have to do what I feel is right for me.  I'm sorry if you don't like it,\" and stalks out of the room.  Mike continues to insist that Pilar do the right thing and testify, and Pilar turns away, rolling her eyes and not knowing what to do next.   Russ calls again and threatens to tell the police the truth about Pilar, so she pretends that the call was from the manager of the Wagon Wheel Motel, and she leaves, telling Mike that she has to pick up a check.\n\n\nBarbara asks Dr. Walker Daniels to take the bandages off her eyes in private, so that she can have time to put on a brave front for Jennifer and Paul if she is still blind.  Walker removes the bandages, and she sees his face, at first blurry, but finally in perfect focus.  She emotionally embraces him, and each thinks the other is beautiful.  After Walker leaves, Barbara receives a large bouquet of red roses whit a card which reads, \"Get well soon, honey.  Love, James.\"  Her face changes from happy to terrified in an instant.\n\n\nIn Rosanna's suite, Paul and Rosanna discuss the bombshell that James dropped on them, telling them that Jordan is Cabot's biological father.   Paul suggests that Rosanna first determine, through a DNA test, that Jordan actually is Cabot's father.  Next, Paul suggests that Rosanna contact a lawyer to have herself declared Cabot's legal guardian, and to have her marriage to Jordan annulled.   He also suggests taking steps to have Jordan's parental rights taken away.  Then Paul stuns Rosanna by suggesting that she take Cabot away \"as far and as fast as you can.\"  He adds, \"This time, Rosanna, there will be no turning back.\"  Paul quickly calls Dr. Daniels and leaves a message to set up a dna test to find out if Jordan actually is the biological father, then he leaves Rosanna after receiving a call from Jennifer.  Paul tells Rosanna that, if she leaves town with Cabot, facing James Stenbeck's wrath will be easier for him than saying goodbye to Rosanna. Soon Dr. Daniels arrives at Rosanna's door, where she explains that Paul had called him on her behalf.  She tells Walker that \"someone\" has claimed to be Cabot's biological father, and she asks the doctor,  \"I'd like to screen his DNA without his knowledge.  Can you do that for me?\"  Rosanna offers to provide a hairbrush or toothbrush, and Walker agrees to do the test, although he warns Rosanna that any evidence they discover in this way cannot be used in court.  Walker agrees to take Cabot's sample right away.  Before leaving, Walker advises Rosanna to be open with her new husband.  Just then Jordan walks in the door, and asks what it is that Rosanna should be telling him.\n\n\nWhile Rosanna and Paul are talking in Rosanna's suite, at BRO, Jordan and Jennifer are kissing and declaring their love to each other.  Jordan tells Jennifer the entire truth about his marriage to Rosanna, including the facts that he has signed Cabot's adoption papers, and that the documents require that he and Rosanna stay married for two years.  When Jennifer suggests asking her father, Police Chief Hal Munson, to find out who is behind the adoption plan, Jordan asks her to wait to see if he and Rosanna can work it out for themselves within the two week deadline he has given Rosanna.  Jennifer agrees and they kiss again.  After Jordan leaves, Jennifer calls Paul and asks him to come meet her at BRO.  When Paul arrives, he assures Jennifer that Rosanna plans to cut Jordan loose as soon as possible.  Paul does not tell Jennifer that James Stenbeck is behind the adoption plan, but he does assure Jennifer that he wants her to be happy and is happy for her and Jordan, whom he admires for going to such great lengths to help Rosanna.  Paul flatly tells Jennifer that Rosanna wants to get out of the marriage with Jordan as much as Jordan wants to get away from her.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Jordan confides in Jennifer that his marriage to Rosanna is a sham that is only intended to help her hold on to her son. Meanwhile, Paul persuades Rosanna that they have to assume James was telling the truth about Jordan being Cabot's father. She insists on getting a DNA test and asks Walker to administer it. Rosanna and Paul decide that it is best to keep Jordan busy until they can get to the bottom of things so they begin to encourage a relationship with Jennifer. Pauls sudden interest in her love life makes Jennifer suspicious. Later, Jordan walks in on Rosanna and Walker as they discuss the paternity test. After Margo finds out that Henry has become a patient at Deerbrook, she and Tom pay him a visit. Katie persuades them to get Henry out of Deerbrook. Later, a stranger watches Katie through the window. Meanwhile, Russ pressures Pilar to get him out of jail, threatening to expose her plan to get to Mike. Pilar tries to convince Mike that they should not testify against Russ, but Mike refuses. After, Russ calls again and warns that hell talk to the police in the morning unless Pilar does something. Barbara asks Walker to remove her bandages early. He does, and she is relieved to find that her vision seems to be restored. Barbara is happy when she receives a beautiful bouquet of flowers - but is horrified to discover that they are from James!",
    "tvmega_recap": "Margo and Tom go to Deerbrook to find out why Henry committed himself and mostly why he stole an id and left the grounds. They ask to speak with Katie, but are forbidden to do so \u0096 until Katie sneaks out of her room. She begs Margo and Tom to get Henry out of there. Sgt. Musgrove approaches Katie and tells her she's being watched and that the alien that's watching her stole his hat. Margo and Tom get Henry out, Margo now curious as to why Pilar visited Katie in the hospital. Russ threatens Pilar that he's going to spill the beans if she doesn't get him out of jail. Pilar tries to tell Mike that she wants to just let Russ go, Mike firmly against it. He talks her back into prosecuting him, Pilar receiving another call from Russ in the meantime. He tells her that she has until the morning or he's going to talk. Pilar lies, telling Mike it was the manager at the Wagon Wheel and that if she doesn't pick up her check in person, he's going to tear it up. Mike reluctantly lets Pilar go alone. Barbara confides in Walker that she's terrified to have her bandages removed in front of her children, not wanting to upset them further if she can't see. He takes them off for her and she can see, Barbara wondering why God would give her back her vision after all the heartache she's caused. Her and Walker embrace. Later, she receives flowers and asks the nurse to read the card, thinking they're from Walker, but instead they're from James. Jordan and Jennifer enjoy a passionate kiss, Jordan telling her everything. Jennifer worries about Cabot, but Jordan tells her that it's not their problem and when the two weeks is up, they can finally be together. He leaves, Jennifer calling Paul and telling him to come to BRO so they can talk about Jordan. Paul tells Jennifer that he knows nothing about the mysterious entity that is behind Roseanna and Jordan's marriage, Jennifer doubting him out loud. Paul then reassures her that Roseanna wants out of the marriage as much as Jordan does and is drawing up the paperwork as they speak. Before Paul went to see Jennifer, he and Roseanna discussed the situation, Paul finally convincing her to draw up whatever legal documents she needs and have Jordan sign them. He also advised her to leave town with Cabot and disappear. She still wanted to know if James was telling the truth about Jordan's paternity, so Paul arranges for Walker to come over to take the samples for a paternity test. Walker is suspicious as to why she doesn't want to take all the legal precautions, but gathers the data anyway. Just as he's about to leave, he warns Roseanna that she needs to tell her husband about the test and the monetary threat that instigated it. Jordan walks in at that moment and asks what Roseanna needs to tell him.",
