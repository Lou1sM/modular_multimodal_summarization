Craig vehemently denied that, as Lucinda looked smug.  Gabriel accused Craig again of hitting him and leaving him to die in the fire, and soon he and Craig were shouting back and forth.  Gabriel began coughing and choking, so Margo threw Craig out of the room as a nurse arrived to help the patient.  As soon as Gabriel could get some air, he croaked at Craig in the hall, \"We're not done.\"\n\n\nLily suggested to the nurse that perhaps she could ask Craig to leave Gabriel alone, but the nurse said she could not override a patient's request about visitors.  Margo told Gabriel to repeat his story, so the boy quoted Craig as saying that Gabriel would not get out alive, and then he saw Craig reach for something on his desk.  Gabriel turned his back, and everything went black. \"That never happened,\" muttered Craig.  Gabriel claimed that Craig wanted to shut him up because the boy knew that Craig was stealing from Parker's trust fund and lying to Carly.\n\n\nLucinda spoke up and mentioned that Craig had threatened her as well, and Margo went ballistic.  Craig pushed Margo into Lily and Lucinda and shoved them all out the door.  He then barricaded the door with a chair, as Lucinda began laughing.  Craig wanted to know why Gabriel had turned on him, but the boy denied that he was Craig's son.  In the hall, Margo asked Lily and her mother to try to get Craig to open the door before she had to call in the heavy power.  Lily shouted through the door, but Craig was questioning Gabriel about all the lies the boy had told.  Craig explained that he had no idea that Lydia had been pregnant with Gabriel, and he told the boy to blame the Walsh women.\n\n\nMargo led in a uniformed officer and ordered him to use a crow bar to pry open the door.  Craig pleaded with Gabriel to make things right, but the boy mumbled that it was too late.    The door flew open, and the police arrested Craig, who called out, \"Fix this, Gabriel!\"  The officer escorted Craig outside, as Lily and Lucinda walked in to see the boy.  Gabriel began another bout of coughing, and it frightened Lily, so she left to find the doctor.  Lucinda closed the door and complimented Gabriel on his fake cough.  She smiled broadly and said his lies were worthy of his father, who was a lie expert.\n\n\nLily returned with the doctor, who asked the women to leave.  Lucinda wanted the two of them to go home, but Lily refused.  Her mother gave Lily a hug and told her to stop feeling so guilty.  After Lucinda left and the doctor had pronounced Gabriel all right, Lily went back inside and said that she and Lucinda were just as responsible for what Gabriel had been through as Craig was.  Lily admitted that she and Lucinda had kept the secret from Craig all the years at Lydia's request.  Gabriel was unconvinced, however, and he was sure that his mother had really died of a broken heart, not cancer.  Gabriel swore he would always blame Craig for that.\n\n\nLily said she was willing to help the boy if he could swallow his pride.  Gabriel said he did not need charity or pity, but Lily reminded him that he had nowhere to live when the doctors released him.  She said he had been paying for his room at the Lakeview with stolen money, but \"that well\" had \"dried up.\" Lily invited Gabriel to stay with her and her family indefinitely.  Gabriel seemed shocked and asked why Lily was helping him, and her answer was that it was the right thing to do.\n\n\nAt the police station, Carly reassured Parker that he was going home with her, but the boy was more realistic about his chances for freedom.  Carly took a call from Liberty, who was looking for Parker, so Carly passed her phone to her son.  Parker said he was at the police station, so Liberty promised to be right there and that she had a surprise for him.  \"I have one for you, too,\" said Parker sadly. He was upset that Liberty would see him in police custody, particularly since she looked upon Gabriel as some sort of wounded animal that needed her help.  Carly, however, urged Parker to let the girl help him.\n\n\nLiberty arrived at the station and asked Parker to go have coffee with her, but Carly intervened and said that the boy had to wait at the station for his dad.  Carly walked out to give the teens some privacy, and Liberty hugged Parker and called him her best friend who was always there for her.  She produced two hard-to-get concert tickets and announced that since she was feeling so much better, the two of them could finally celebrate.  Parker said that Liberty needed to find someone else to go with her to the concert because he couldn't go.\n\n\nParker flung open the doors to the interview room and tried to make a break for it, but the duty officer caught him. The officer warned Parker to behave or he would have to cuff him, and then Parker had to tell Liberty that he had been booked on assault charges for hitting Gabriel and leaving him injured in the Monte Carlo offices.  Liberty was astonished at Parker's confession\n\n\nJack waited at the diner to hear from his lawyer for help with Parker, and Janet tried to calm him.  Jack said he'd hoped to talk to Liberty about Parker in person, but she wasn't there.  Janet could not understand why Parker had not told Jack the truth from the beginning, so Jack explained that \"someone\" had instructed the boy not to.  Janet couldn't believe that anyone would do that.  Carly walked in and asked where Parker's lawyer was.  She also mentioned that Liberty was at the police station with Parker, and she and Jack began to trade nasty barbs.\n\n\nSuddenly Janet caught on that it had been Carly who had counseled Parker not to tell his father that he had fought with Gabriel.   \"Only you,\" said Janet, \"could make a bad situation worse for your own kid.\"    Carly demanded that Janet mind her own business, and that precipitated a shouting catfight.  Jack then took a call from Margo telling him that Gabriel had awakened and was claiming that Craig had hit him and left him for dead.  Jack told Carly and Janet, and Carly beamed and said that meant her son was going home.\n\n\nAt the station, Jack and Janet rushed into the interview room, and Jack said that Gabriel was awake and had proclaimed that Craig was responsible for knocking him out and leaving him to die in the fire.  Parker realized that meant that he could go home, and he was greatly relieved.  He asked everyone to clear the room so that he could talk more with Liberty.\n\n\nWhen the teens were alone, Liberty acted hurt, and she scolded Parker for lying about what had happened.  She was crushed that he had not trusted her with the truth in the first place.  Carly interrupted and asked Parker to ride home with them, but he said he preferred to ride his bike.  He ran out and took off.\n\n\nIn the squad car, Craig tried to convince Margo that Gabriel hated him so much that he had made up the whole damning tale.  Margo said she was through making excuses for a brother who had left a kid to die in a fire he had set.  She could think of no reason for Gabriel to lie, but Craig suggested that the boy was hurt and angry about how Craig had treated his mother.  Craig said he had to talk to Gabriel again, and he asked Margo to drive him back to the hospital.  \"God help you, Craig,\" said Margo. \"You're on your own.\"\n\n\nThey arrived at the station, and Jack immediately accused Craig of manipulating Parker and worrying them all for no reason.  Jack said terrible things about Craig, calling him an \"S.O.B\" and threatening to kill him.  An officer separated the two men, as Craig begged Jack not to throw him to the wolves.  In desperation, Craig cried out that he would never hurt Parker by framing him, for the most obvious reason in the world: Craig loved Parker's mother.  Margo rushed Craig away, and she told Jack to back off because he was still off the case.\n\n\nParker rode home, followed soon after by his parents.  He was still stunned that Gabriel had fingered Craig instead of him.  Carly offered to make the boy's favorite dinner, mac and cheese, skirt steak, and garlic bread, and he went upstairs to take a shower.  Jack opted to return to the station rather than stay for the meal, however.  Parker cleaned up and rejoined his mother.  He asked her if she wasn't freaked out that she had been about to marry a man who was just arrested for trying to murder his own son.\n\n\nLiberty and Janet went to Java, and the girl was hurt that her best friend had kept such an important secret from her.  Janet defended Parker, however, as Liberty said she wanted to visit Gabriel since he was awake.  Janet said that was a bad idea, and she reminded Liberty that Gabriel had been blackmailing his own father.  Liberty said she was the only one Gabriel had on his side.\n\n\n",

Craig is stunned, as he pleads with Gabriel to tell the truth, but he isn't interested in Craig's pleas. Craig forces everyone out of the room while he begs Gabriel to tell the truth; he even explains that Lily and Lucinda kept the news about him being a father all these years; he wants to make up for this, but Gabriel will not listen. Margo and Lily try to get Craig to open the door, but he won't so Margo is forced to call for an officer. Once inside and still not changing his story, Craig is taken to jail. Lucinda talks with Gabriel in private and praises his lies for the greater good. Craig implores Margo to listen to his side promising he would never hurt his own child, but his pleas fall on deaf ears, as Margo can't take anymore lies from him. Jack and Janet hang out, as he awaits the lawyer's call back. Jack wrestles with Parker's situation, as Janet figures out that Carly knew about Parker's lies and didn't tell Jack. Carly stands by Parker, as he is in jail, but she is still convinced he did nothing wrong and that he shouldn't talk anymore. When Liberty calls her, she tells her to come to the station thinking she might convince Parker to reconsider. Liberty has no idea why Parker is there and only wants to make up by offering to go with him to a concert with her so they can get their friendship back on track. Parker tells her that he can't go, as Liberty finds out Parker has been arrested. Parker finally admits that he hit Gabriel and left him unconscious. Liberty is very upset to hear this, as they argue. Carly shows up to find Jack with Janet and she isn't happy to find them talking about Parker and is even less thrilled when Janet judges the choice she made to keep Parker from talking with Jack. They are interrupted by Margo's call and her news about Craig. They all head to the station happy to tell Parker. They tell Parker and Liberty the news, as Parker isn't sure how to feel. Liberty is still angry with him and the fact that he is now off the hook doesn't change that he lied to her. Carly, Jack and Parker head home, as Carly wants to cook him all of his favorites, but Parker is more concerned about his parents being ok. Carly asks Jack to stay for dinner, but he wants to head back to the station first to take care of something. Janet and Liberty talk about Parker and his actions against Gabriel, as Liberty is mad that he lied to her and that he is jealous. Janet defends a bit of Parker's actions, but thinks they also may need space since Parker may still have some unresolved feelings for her. Liberty wants to go see Gabriel, but Janet isn't thrilled to hear this. Gabriel blackmailed Craig and took Parker's money, but Liberty defends him saying that she won't turn her back on someone with no family considering they know firsthand how that feels. A furious Jack confronts Craig promising if he could, he would kill him for what he put Parker through. Craig appeals to Jack to think about if this makes sense; he would never throw Parker under the bus or hurt his own son. Jack doesn't believe that, as Craig makes an admission of love for Carly that would cause him never to put her through losing Parker, as Jack seems a bit swayed by his defense. Craig asks Jack to think about what he said, as Jack seems to be thinking about his words.",
