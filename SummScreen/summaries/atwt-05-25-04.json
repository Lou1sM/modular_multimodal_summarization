    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is glad that Henry was able to leave, but is concerned about what Sgt. Musgrove has told her about the \"alien\" that is watching her. She tells the doctor and he doesn't believe her. When he catches her not taking her meds, he forces her to get the injection and just as she's about to go under, she sees Simon take of Sgt. Musgroves hat in the window. Henry fills in Mike and Margo about what he learned from Russell Terry and then to Mike's horror, confirms the story that Pilar visited Katie with the picture of them in bed. They decide to let Margo work on some of her leads. Pilar tells Russ she'll bail him out, but he has to disappear, Russ telling her no way. He'll take the bail out, but he's going to hang around until she pays him what she owes him. Pilar doesn't have the five thousand to get him out, so she tries to borrow it from the Wagon Wheels Motel manager, him telling her to get the money the old fashioned way \u0096 either work for it or steal it. Walker bails out Roseanna, telling Jordan he was only there to inform him about Barbara's recovery and ability to see again. He has a hard time believing it, feeling that Roseanna hasn't told him everything. She tells him that she feels badly for the whole situation and if she had been more clear- headed, she would've been able to get Cabot back without him marrying her. After reassuring him that she has her lawyers working on the paperwork, she urges him to visit Barbara and maybe see Jennifer as well \u0096 her excuse for suddenly changing her mind on that being that she feels like she owes him. Barbara accepts a dinner invitation from Walker, despite a foreboding she gets when she looks at the bouquet James' bouquet. She'd tried to talk with Paul earlier about the gift from James, but Jennifer interrupted them. Paul asks Walker if he'd spoken with Roseanna, Walker saying the DNA samples were being processed at the moment. He cautions Paul about using the information to make big decisions about other peoples lives. Paul urges Roseanna to tie up the paperwork as quickly as possible and to leave with Cabot. Jordan and Jennifer are happy that they can be together, but are suspicious at the sudden turn around. Jennifer asks to talk with Lucy, Lucy not able to answer her questions regarding Cabot's adoption but suggesting Jennifer talk with Craig. Jennifer says she will talk to Craig about it.",
