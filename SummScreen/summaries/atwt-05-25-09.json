Alison told him that she was getting an award at graduation for being the most improved nursing student. Casey congratulated her, and Alison invited him to join her for coffee at Java. Casey said that he had to drive a senior patient home, but he would catch her later. After Alison left, a grinning Casey told another nurse that he had taken the patient home an hour earlier, and he dashed away. \n\n\nEmily's assistant, Hunter, was in Java when Alison got there. She asked him why he had not shown up for lunch the other day when she and Casey had invited him. Hunter flashed back on seeing Alison and Casey kissing in the diner, and he said that he had gotten hung up. He had to hurry back to the office to deliver Emily's coffee while it was hot. \n\n\nEmily was working at her desk when Casey surprised her. He told her about Alison's award and said that he, Emily, and Susan should do something spectacular for her to recognize her achievement. Emily was not enthusiastic about the idea, but Casey shamed her into agreeing. Emily said she would make dinner reservations at the Lakeview and also call her mother. Casey said he would take care of bringing Alison. \n\n\nBarbara answered her phone and heard Paul's voice asking her if she had made a decision about helping him. Barbara felt that she had no choice but to agree, because otherwise Paul threatened to take the baby and disappear forever from her life. She said she would send him the $100,000, but Paul insisted that she deliver it to him personally. He told her how to find the private airfield he had used, and he asked her to call for further instructions when she arrived. He badgered her again about the consequences if she sold him out, and he hung up. \n\n\nMeg answered the door at Lily's and found Damian there. He said he had spoken to Lisa, who had agreed to watch Barbara for any clues that might lead them to Paul's whereabouts. Damian urged Meg to be patient, but she was not hopeful that Barbara would rat out her son. Meg appreciated having Damian on her side, and he promised to find Eliza and bring her home. He said that they only needed a small lead. \n\n\nAt the farm co-op store, Paul was buying apples when Rosanna saw him. He said his car had given him trouble again, so he and the baby had spent the night. Rosanna said he hoped that Meg was not worried about him at home, but Paul assured her that Meg was not concerned. Paul asked for a favor: he needed Rosanna to watch the baby for a few hours while he ran an errand. He explained that he had to meet someone at the airport, but Rosanna reminded him that she was working. She also mentioned that since she had been married to him, she knew Paul well, and that something was off with him. \n\n\nRosanna believed that Paul was running from someone, and she demanded to know the truth. When he did not respond, she said goodbye and walked away, so Paul asked her to do the one favor for him, and after that, he would tell her everything. Rosanna agreed. \n\n\nBarbara waited in the lobby for her driver, and Lisa interrupted her thoughts. Lisa asked if Barbara had heard from Paul, but Barbara denied it. Her friend pushed to know if she had any clues as to where Paul was hiding, but Barbara lied and said she was in a hurry to get to an appointment. Lisa wanted to know if the appointment had anything to do with Paul and begged Barbara to trust her. Lisa backed away, just as a man met Barbara at the door, and Lisa heard him tell Barbara that he was ready to take her to the airport. \n\n\nLisa immediately called Damian and told him where Barbara was headed, and that it was probably for a meeting with Paul. Damian told Meg, and he promised to use his contacts to find out exactly where Barbara was headed. He and Meg left in a hurry. \n\n\nEmily prepared to leave her office and told Hunter that she was going to the Lakeview to make arrangements for Alison's special dinner. Then she remembered that she had to call her mother with the invitation, and Hunter asked about Alison's father. Emily said in no uncertain terms that she was not about to call the great Dr. Larry McDermott and tell him the good news. Hunter looked confused as Emily walked out. \n\n\nWhen Emily retuned shortly, she had a gift for her sister, and she went to work immediately on some articles she wanted to get on the website before she left for dinner. Hunter said he had ordered a present for Alison online; he had sent an email invitation to Larry McDermott of Chicago for Alison's party. Emily was speechless at first, and then she began raging at Hunter. She called Larry a deadbeat loser who had not been in Alison's life for 18 years. She was outraged at what Hunter had done and asked him to revoke the invitation. \n\n\nHunter felt terrible for his mistake, and explained that he could not recall the email. Emily said that their only hope was that Larry would not suddenly turn into \"Father of the Year.\" She doubted that he would actually show up. \n\n\nBack at Memorial, Casey surprised Alison by telling her that the other nurse was finishing Alison's shift because he had planned a family surprise for her to celebrate the award. Alison was curious as to how a dinner with both Emily and Casey in attendance would play, but she was willing to give it a try. When she still protested a bit, Casey picked her up and slung her over his shoulder and marched out. \n\n\nCasey took Alison to Fashions and said that he wanted her to have a new dress for the occasion. Lisa backed him up, and she picked out a lovely dress and had Alison try it on. Alison loved the dress and walked out of Fashions wearing it. She sat for a minute on a bench in Old Town, and shared with Casey that for the first time in her life, she could say that everything was good and that she had accomplished something that she was proud of. The two of them headed for the Lakeview. \n\n\nPaul arrived at the airfield and hid. Barbara walked past the hangars looking for her son. He started to reveal himself, but suddenly Paul spotted Meg and Damian lurking near a building. He remained hidden and called Barbara on her cell. When Barbara answered, Paul said it had been a mistake to trust her. He was furious, but Barbara had no clue why. \n\n\nPaul told her he had just seen Meg and Damian behind her, but Barbara thought that was impossible. Then Barbara realized that Lisa had blown it for them, and she apologized. Paul told his mother goodbye forever, and he heaved his cell phone across the grass. \n\n\nBarbara screamed for Meg and Damian to show themselves, and they did. She yelled that they had ruined everything by scaring Paul away. Meg was outraged that Barbara was going to give Paul money, and the two women went at it. Barbara was worried that there was no telling what Paul would do next, so Damian suggested that she call him on his cell phone. When she did, Meg and Damian could hear the phone ringing. \n\n\nDamian found Paul's disposable cell phone on the ground, and they assumed that Paul was long gone. Meg suggested that he might be hiding in one of the small towns they had passed along the way, but she thought the best idea was to go back to Oakdale and let the police deal with tracking Paul. Barbara agreed, but Meg was frustrated at the thought that her daughter might be very close by. \n\n\nPaul returned to Rosanna, who had just gotten Eliza to sleep. Paul offered her the explanation for his absence, but Rosanna said it was really none of her business. She wished him and Eliza good lives and bade him be on his way. Paul finally confessed that he had nowhere to go. He admitted that he and Meg were divorced and at odds over the baby's custody. He claimed that Meg had run out on him, but he assured Rosanna that he had full legal right to the baby because the court had declared Meg an unfit mother. \n\n\nRosanna found that hard to believe, and she wanted to know why Paul was hiding from his ex-wife. He said that Meg had not turned out to be the person he had believed her to be, and he could no longer trust her. Rosanna figured out that Paul was hiding because Meg was attempting to regain custody of Eliza. Rosanna understood how much Paul loved his daughter, but she said she could not get involved. Then Paul asked to stay at the farm with her. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Casey, Alison, and Emily toasted Alison's graduation and award, and Emily gave a lovely speech. Hunter walked through the room, and Emily excused herself to speak with him. She asked him what the hell he was doing there, and he answered that he had decided to \"stand guard\" in the room in case Dr. McDermott showed up. Emily told Hunter that he had the intimidation factor of a zygote, and besides, he didn't even know what Larry looked like. Hunter said that he had looked him up on the Internet so he could recognize him easily. Emily was still sure that the man was not going to appear. \n\n\nAlison and Casey wondered what Emily and Hunter were discussing, and Alison thought she had heard Emily call him a \"goat.\" Alison wanted to invite Hunter to join them, but Casey was opposed. Alison got up to do it anyway, and when she looked up, she saw her father, Larry, standing in the doorway. He approached Alison and offered his congratulations. He asked for a hug and moved forward, but Alison stopped him cold. \n\n\nMeg and Damian returned Barbara to the Lakeview, and she and Meg were still arguing about Paul. Meg pointed out that Paul only called his mother when he wanted something, and Barbara realized that was right. Damian intervened by reminded them that the goal was to get the baby back safely. Meg and Damian left, and Barbara spotted Lisa in a hallway. She grabbed Lisa by the arm and announced that the two of them were going to have a chat. Lisa could not understand why Barbara was so angry at her, but Barbara accused her of spying for Meg and Damian. Lisa admitted it, and then chewed out Barbara for helping Paul escape with Eliza. \n\n\nMeg told Damian that Jack was arranging for a team to search the area around the airfield. She was afraid that the longer the search dragged on, the more desperate Paul would become. \n\n\nOn the co-op farm, Paul pled with Rosanna that if he left, the authorities would catch him and take away his only reason for living: his baby. Rosanna said he needed to do what was best for the child, and that was to take her home. Paul asked to stay on the farm for a week, and said he was willing to work. Rosanna explained that the co-op did not hire outside workers, and she turned him down.\n\n\n",
