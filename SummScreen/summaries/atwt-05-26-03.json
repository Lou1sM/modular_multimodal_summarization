Doctors Susan, Bob, and Rick Decker, arrive and hear about the aides' plight.  Myrtle Scott, another patient, overhears, and tells them all that she saw \"Scott\" Goff walking away.  Rick sweet talks Mrs. Scott into telling him what direction Mr. Goff went.  Elsewhere in the hospital, while Dusty is confiding to Dr. John Dixon that he feels responsible for Paul's plane crash, intern Chris Hughes interrupts to tell John about his missing patient, and John rushes off in alarm.  John irately rushes up to Bob ranting about malpractice suits, so Rick emerges from Mrs. Scott's room and misdirects John, enabling Bob to save the day by finding Mr. Goff.  John returns to find Mr. Goff safely in his room, and Bob, Rick, Chris, and Alison all beaming at one another.  A little later, Rick tells John that Bob and Chris went home after Bob signed Mrs. Scott's release papers.  John goes into Mrs. Scott's room and finds her dead, after taking a muscle relaxant that  Bob had prescribed.  John declares, \"This has got to stop!\"\n\n\nAt Rose's Roller Palace, Rose is on the phone making arrangements for a memorial service for Paul while Spangler's two thugs spy on her through the glass door.  The thugs decide to find out more about Rose before they return to Chicago.   The thug with a beard pretends to need a haircut \"for his daughter's graduation,\" and Rose begins telling him all her troubles, including the juicy tidbit that she is close to Lucinda Walsh.  Rose insists on giving the thug a facial, and she covers his face with a warm cloth, telling him to relax and enjoy himself.  Just then, Dusty arrives, and when Rose and Dusty go into another room where they vow to support each other, the thug sits up and gloats, \"Oh, I'll enjoy myself, Rosie.  Especially now that I know who some of your friends are.\"  When Rose and Dusty return, they find that her \"customer\" has vanished, leaving a $50 bill.\n\n\nIn the Snyder kitchen, Jack questions Rosanna about Carly's disappearance, and Craig walks in, hearing for the first time that Carly is missing.  Jack tells Rosanna that she was seen watching Carly immediately before her disappearance.  Rosanna pretends to confess to Craig that she had advised Carly to leave town, and that she is afraid that Carly took her advice.  She tells Craig that Carly was vindictive toward her.  Craig assures Rosanna that she is the only thing that matters to him and asks her to return to Fairwinds.  Rosanna asks for more time, but gives Craig a tender kiss \"to tide him over.\"  While Craig and Rosanna talk, Jack searches Rosanna's car and finds Carly's black glittery scarf in the back seat.  Jack rushes into the police station to ask Margo to help him get a search warrant for Rosanna's car, then hurries back to the Snyder farm to watch the car so that Rosanna cannot destroy the evidence.  Craig leaves the farm, but Rosanna has second thoughts and rushes outside after him, to find him gone.  While she is outside, she glances into her car and finds Carly's scarf.  The program ends with Rosanna, holding the scarf, sighing, \"Thank God!  Now Jack will never find it.\"\n\n\n",
