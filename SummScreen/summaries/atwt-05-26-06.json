He's worried that Lily will never accept him for who he is. Lucinda tells Luke that Lily is just afraid for him, that he'll suffer because of being gay and that his life will be hard. Luke wants to know why it's so much easier for Lucinda to accept that he's gay than for Lily; she asks him if she can change the fact that he's gay, and when he says no, she replies, \"Then I accept it.\" Luke tells her he'd actually been more afraid to tell her he was gay than to tell his parents; Lucinda is stunned by this and tells Luke that one thing having cancer taught her is that it's most important to simply love the people in your life.\n\n\nDamian shows up at Lily's house without warning, and she isn't happy to see him. He assures her that his life has changed and that he's no longer a marked man with enemies who want to see him dead. She tells him she doesn't think she should just take his word for that. He asks about Luke, telling her he didn't find out that Lily was trying to reach him until after Luke had his kidney transplant. He says that he wants to be sure Luke is okay, even though he looked okay to him. Lily realizes Damian is the one who has been following Luke. She tells Damian that Luke actually accused her of hiring a private investigator to follow him, and confused, Damian asks why on earth he'd think such a thing. She tells him it's normal teenager stuff, but he senses there's something more that Lily isn't telling him about Luke.
