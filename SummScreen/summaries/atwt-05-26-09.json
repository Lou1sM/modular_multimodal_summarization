    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt the Lakeview, Larry McDermott told the Stewart women and Casey that he understood that Alison had not expected him to show up at her graduation dinner. He congratulated her on her graduation and her award, but Alison said that she had not invited him. Larry, however, claimed to have received an email invitation, so Hunter spoke up and admitted that he had sent it to Alison's father. Alison questioned Hunter, who apologized profusely for using poor judgment. Larry said he hoped that something good could come out of a mistake, and he wanted a chance to tell his daughter how proud he was of her. \n\n\nAlison was not impressed by her father's words, and she was upset that Larry thought that she would be desperate enough to want him to share in her celebration. She declared that she never wanted to see him again, and she walked out. Larry looked crushed, as Emily chewed out Hunter, who made a hasty exit. Susan Stewart walked in and was stunned to see her ex-husband sitting on a couch. She demanded to know \"what the hell\" he was doing there. \n\n\nCasey followed Alison into Old Town, and she told him that she only remembered her dad on that night in Chicago when he had rejected her at his door. Hunter walked by, and Alison asked him to keep out of her business. Casey confronted Hunter and warned him to stay away from Alison because Casey loved her and was the one looking out for her. Casey took a shattered Alison to his house. \n\n\nWhen Rosanna declared that she would not give up her new life to get involved in his drama, Paul promised that he would cause no trouble at the farm. She asked only for peace and to be left alone. Paul said he understood how she felt, but that Eliza was mad at her. They said their goodbyes, and the baby began wailing. \n\n\nRosanna filled Eliza's bottle, and Paul asked permission to feed the baby there in the store. Eliza quieted down as soon as she took the bottle, as one of Rosanna's co-workers, Edna, entered through a back door. She and Rosanna talked about work, but then Edna said she was uneasy about Paul. Rosanna told her that Paul was someone she had known long ago, and that he would be leaving as soon as the baby had eaten. \n\n\nRosanna explained to Paul that she liked being part of a community in which people looked out for each other. Paul begged her to let him stay, but Rosanna recognized all his tricks for manipulating her. She refused to even consider letting the chaos that followed Paul Ryan back into her life. A police car drove up in front, and Paul became nervous. Rosanna said that the cop was a regular customer, but Paul wanted a place to hide. She took the baby up front with her and told Paul to look busy in the back of the store. \n\n\nLen, the cop, asked about the baby, and Rosanna said that she was Edna's granddaughter. Paul began stocking shelves, and Rosanna called him \"Bill,\" and she sent him on an errand in the back. Len asked Rosanna to go to the movies with him the next night, but she put him off. The cop left, and Paul returned and thanked Rosanna. She asked why the court would consider returning Eliza to Meg if they had already ruled her unfit. Paul stammered, and then he answered that he might have manipulated the truth a bit, but in the end, Meg had betrayed him with Dusty. \n\n\nPaul then admitted that he had gone whacko and actually had been hospitalized in a psych ward for a while. He said that Meg had pushed him to his limits, so he had fought back and had pulled some strings to get her declared unfit. Rosanna accused Paul of kidnapping the baby, and Paul almost lost it. When he finished yelling at Rosanna, she asked why she should help him. Paul said that she owed him because her new lifestyle did not cancel out what she had done in her old life, such as paying off a lab tech so that Paul would not find out he was the father of Meg's baby. \n\n\nPaul also blamed her for Meg's fall, which had resulted in Meg losing that baby. He urged Rosanna to help him, and then he would consider the two of them even. He would also keep her little secret and not reveal that she had recovered and was living not far from Oakdale. That way, she could continue her anonymity. \n\n\nLarry told Susan that he had been invited to the dinner and had every reason to believe that his daughter wanted to see him. Susan advised him not to let the door hit him on the way out, and she further said it was way too late for him to \"work things out.\" Larry said that was not up to Susan, and Emily butted in and reminded both of them that Alison was the only one who got a say about her life. Susan and Larry shouted back and forth until Larry stormed out. \n\n\nLarry went to Java and saw Hunter there. Hunter apologized for interfering with Larry's personal business, but Larry said it was long past time that he made amends with his daughter. He asked Hunter if he knew where Alison had gone from the Lakeview, so Hunter blurted out that she had gone home with Casey Hughes, and he wrote out the GPS coordinates to the house. \n\n\nAt the Hugheses', Casey told Alison how sorry he was that Hunter, whom he called \"the Prince of Dorkness,\" had invited Larry. Alison kissed him then, and Casey responded, but then he offered her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Larry rang the doorbell, and Casey opened the door, but he slammed it immediately when he saw who it was. Alison let Larry in, and Casey went to his room to give them privacy. Larry admitted that he had not acted much like a father, and he said he was still kicking himself for how he had treated her in Chicago. \n\n\nAlison told him what it had felt like when he had taken her hope away and she had realized that she didn't matter to her own father. Larry denied that, but he said he could not forgive himself for making her think that way. He talked about his new family and the hard times they had gone through. He was afraid to approach Alison for fear of being rejected, but the recent email had given him hope. \n\n\nHe said he was very proud of her and that she had always been in his heart. He hoped that some day, he would be in hers. He handed her his card and said to call if she wanted to see him. Alison hugged him awkwardly as he was leaving. \n\n\nCasey ran in as Alison was recovering her composure. She said that her father was not a heartless monster, after all; he was only a sad and lonely man. She had no idea if she would ever call him. Then she asked Casey why he had told Hunter that he loved her, and she kissed him. They began making out, but Casey stopped and suggested they go get a burger at Al's. Alison asked about Tom and Margo, who were staying overnight in Chicago. Alison offered to spend the night with Casey, and he asked her if she was sure. They kissed again. \n\n\nHunter went back to the office and read off an apology to Emily that he had written. She could not believe that he had recited from a note, but she cut him some slack and said that perhaps Alison and Larry might have repaired some of the old damage if it hadn't been so late. Hunter said that was not necessarily so, and Emily pressed for details. Hunter said he had run into Larry at Java and had told him where he could find Alison. \n\n\nEmily roared at Hunter, asking him what part of \"Mind your own business\" he didn't understand. She called Alison and found out that her sister had talked to her father and that she actually felt pretty good about it. Emily hung up and told Hunter that he was off the hook, and she helped herself to half of his sandwich. \n\n\nRosanna's friend, Edna, returned and was surprised to see Paul still there. Rosanna asked her if she could arrange with the committee for Paul and the baby to stay for just a few days. Paul offered to work for their keep, but Edna said that they didn't take in strangers. Rosanna asked nicely, and she pointed out the baby. Paul jumped in with a sad tale about losing the baby's mother, while Rosanna bit her tongue. Edna could make no promises, but she agreed to speak to the committee. After she left, Paul thanked Rosanna, who told him not to be so sure the committee would approve his staying. \n\n\nRosanna told Paul that, based on her word, the committee would allow him and Eliza to stay for a few days in a small extra room that had a crib. Paul was grateful, but Rosanna warned him that he was on a working farm, not a vacation. She cautioned him not to make fun of her friends' lifestyles, either. Paul voiced the opinion that perhaps it was destiny that had brought the two of them together at that time, but Rosanna told him not to sweet talk her just because he got what he wanted. If he betrayed her or the committee, he was on his own. \n\n\nLarry went to the hospital and asked to speak with Susan. He told her that she was right, and that he had already apologized to their daughter. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Casey and Alison made love by candlelight.\n\n\n",
