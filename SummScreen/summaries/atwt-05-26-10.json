He complained about pain in his back, and the he hollered at the \"idiot driver\" who had hit him.  The cop ordered Katie out of her car, and he marched her back to Chris.  Chris was astonished to see who the driver was, as Katie denied that she had hit him on purpose.  Alison vouched that they all were friends, and Katie explained that she had gotten flustered and had rammed the gear into reverse instead of drive.  Chris declined to file a report, and he stood up gingerly to prove he was all right.\n\n\nThe officer left after warning Katie to be more careful, as Chris hobbled around.  Alison suggested that they go to Memorial and get an x-ray, but Chris was afraid his peers would tease him unmercifully.  He compromised by agreeing to lie on Katie's couch until he felt better.  Alison drove them all to Katie's, and the women helped Chris into the house.  He sat on the couch, and Alison decided to call her mother and have her call in a prescription for painkillers for Chris, and she offered to pick it up.  Alison left to pick up the drugs, and Chris began teasing Katie about spying on him and Alison in the restaurant.\n\n\nKatie got an ice pack for Chris's back, but she denied that she'd been spying.  Chris said the date was going well until Katie had run him over, but he was curious as to why Katie was in such a hurry to drive away.   Katie mumbled a bit, but then she answered that she had not wanted to interrupt their kiss.  Chris explained that he had not been about to kiss Alison; he was wiping tomato sauce off her face from the pizza.  Katie did admit that if Chris had kissed Alison, Katie would not have liked it.  She said she wasn't exactly jealous, but she did react when she saw what she imagined to be a kiss in the making.\n\n\nBoth of them acknowledged that there were feelings going on between them, but then Katie's doorbell rang.  It was Alison with the painkillers, and she said that Susan had suggested that Chris continue to lie down until he felt better. The women hustled Chris into Katie's bed, and Alison went back to work.  Chris fell asleep almost immediately, so Katie covered him with a blanket and sat with him.  When he awakened later, he asked Katie to continue to stay with him.  Katie then glanced at Brad's photo on her bedside table, and she asked Chris to leave when he felt better because she had to tend to Jacob.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Molly opened the Fashions box that contained the red lacy teddy that Silas Whitman had sent her.  She grabbed it out of the box and stuffed the lingerie into her purse just as Holden walked in.  He saw the box and asked what Molly was hiding.  He grabbed her purse, ran around the kitchen with it, and pulled out the teddy.  Molly apologized profusely and said she had tried to get rid of it earlier, but Holden completely misunderstood.  He thought Molly was giving him the teddy as a present for her to wear, so it was easier for her to just go along with it.  Molly called the lingerie \"overkill,\" but Holden smiled and said he was in the mood for some of that.\n\n\nHolden kissed Molly, who lamented that living together on the farm made it almost impossible for them to make love there.  Holden suggested a \"date night\" at the Lakeview that evening, and Molly agreed.  He promised to make a reservation at the hotel and said he would pick her up after work.  Then Holden drove to Old Town and entered Fashions.  He was picking out earrings for Molly when Silas Whitman walked up behind him and called him \"Farmer.\"  Holden said he thought Silas had left town, but the former Congressman wanted to make sure his \"little gift to Molly\" had been properly delivered.  Holden did not understand until Whiman described the red lingerie, and then Holden grabbed him by his lapels and warned him to stay away from Molly.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Molly tore up a file folder on Silas Whitman, and an angry Holden walked in and closed the door.  \"You lied to me, Molly,\" accused Holden, and he explained that Whitman had bumped into him in Fashions.  Holden was hurt that Molly had not told the truth about the teddy, but Molly swore that she had told the man to \"stay the hell\" out of her life.  Molly had not mentioned Silas's gift because she was afraid that Holden would go after him, and she swore that it was not another ploy to make Holden jealous.  She affirmed that if Holden stayed with her, she would make sure that Silas was never an issue between them again.  Holden asked what her plan was.\n\n\nMolly set up a meeting with Silas at Metro, and Holden sat at a dark table across the room.  When Whitman arrived, Molly made it clear there was absolutely no future for the two of them, and she ordered him to go away.  Across the room, Holden watched and listened, and Molly continued to say that she wanted no contact with Whitman whatsoever.  Silas walked out, and Molly joined Holden, and they hugged.  They went to a room at the Lakeview and were enjoying their privacy when Molly's phone dinged with a text message.  It was from Silas, and it asked what Molly was thinking of while she kissed Holden.\n\n\nIn Vienna's room in the Lakeview, she and Casey were just about to have sex again when she heard voices outside the door. Henry's \"flower girl\" had dropped her rose petals, so they stopped to pick them up.  Henry went over the plan again, and Henry used his card key to open the door.  The security chain was fastened on the door, so it only opened a couple of inches.  Vienna called out that she couldn't answer the door because she was not dressed, and she asked Henry to return later.  Henry shouted that the \"marriage proposal\" of her dreams was about to occur, and he told her to throw on a robe and answer the door.\n\n\nVienna put on a robe and walked to the door and peeked out.  She refused to take off the chain, and she asked Henry to go downstairs and wait for her in the lounge.  She promised she would be there in ten minutes, so Henry took his entourage to the lounge.  Vienna turned around and scowled at Casey to \"get dressed and get out.\"  Casey wanted some answers and dawdled finding his clothes.  As he dressed, Casey asked Vienna why she was sleeping with him when she was committed to Henry.  Vienna said she had never understood the American \"thing\" about only having one partner at a time.  She said her body wanted Casey, but the rest of her wanted Henry.  Vienna warned Casey to get dressed and not to leave anything behind.\n\n\nHenry went to the lobby and ran into Barbara.   He asked her about the broken dance trophy that she had dumped in the trash, and she explained that she hadn't wanted it, so she had thrown it away.  Henry sadly agreed that it was just cheap plastic, but he admitted that it meant something to him.  Just then his \"flower girl\" and troubadour walked up and assumed that Barbara was the blushing bride.  They went into their shtick until Henry shouted that Barbara was \"not the right woman.\" That hurt Barbara, who said she was on her way to talk to the hotel caterer to arrange a christening party for Eliza.  Henry said he hoped he was invited, and he argued that he couldn't dump all his feelings for her similar to cleaning his hard drive.\n\n\nHenry griped that the silly plastic trophy had meant something to him, and Barbara admitted it was the same with her.  The talked about the contest and admired each other's \"footwork.\"  Barbara left the lobby, as Vienna stepped off the elevator.  Henry ran to get his troupe, and they went into their routine.  Vienna walked over to Henry, who was in the bar, and Barbara was horrified to be stuck in the bar for the proposal.  Vienna was thrilled that the proposal was shaping up just as she had dreamed, until Henry forgot the actual part about asking her to marry him.  Vienna reminded him, and Henry said he would rather do that someplace more private.  He said maintenance men were working in his room, so he suggested they retire to Vienna's room.\n\n\nVienna was worried that Casey might not have vacated her room yet, but then Henry had to play his actors, so Vienna went over and stood with Barbara.  Vienna sweetly suggested that since her family was so far away in Sweden, perhaps Barbara could be the \"sweet, old granny\" at the wedding for them.  Barbara was livid, but she held her tongue.\n\n\nIn Vienna's room, Casey was reaching for his shoes when he found a large paper bag under the bed.  It contained multiple pregnancy tests, and he was stupefied until he heard voices in the hall.  He threw the bag under the bed again and ducked into the closet.  Vienna opened the door and scanned it quickly, but she saw no sign of Casey.  Henry got down on one knew and began his speech, but then Vienna spotted Casey's feet peeking out from the closet.  While Henry was kissing her, Vienna waved Casey out of the room, but when he heard Henry's discussing a baby on the way, Casey began to put it all together.\n\n\nVienna asked Henry to go downstairs and order her a huge steak because she was ravenous.  She promised to join him shortly, and after Henry left, Vienna scolded Casey for almost ruining everything.  Casey looked her right in the eyes and asked, \"Is it mine?\"  Vienna lied and said she had gotten pregnant by Henry before she had started sleeping with Casey, but the young man couldn't figure out why Vienna would sleep with him while she was pregnant with Henry's child. Vienna blamed it on her hormones, and she assured him that her doctor had told her if was perfectly safe to continue to have sex.\n\n\nCasey, who worked at the hospital, asked the name of Vienna's doctor. She fumbled for a minute and then said, \"Dr. Gravid.\"  Casey had never heard of the name, but if he had gone to Oakdale Latin, he might have recognized that the name is Latin for \"pregnant.\"  Vienna hustled Casey out the door, and he returned to Memorial where he accessed the directory.  There was no \"Dr. Gravid\" listed.\n\n\nBarbara concluded her arrangements for the christening, and Henry ran to her and apologized for including her in his marriage proposal to Vienna.  Barbara sadly said that it made her realize that she needed to make a \"clean break,\" and she was moving out of the Lakeview.  She thought it was time for a change, and besides, Henry and Vienna lived there, and it too painful for her to keep running into them.  Henry said it was hard for him, as well, as Barbara said she was moving into Fairwinds with Paul and his little family.  Vienna showed up and plucked Henry away, while Barbara called Paul and told him she hoped he would keep an open mind if she asked him something.\n\n\n",
