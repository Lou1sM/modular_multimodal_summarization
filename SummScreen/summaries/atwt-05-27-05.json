Katie tells him that he can't \"just un-we us because you're mad at me.\" Henry is in disbelief that she thinks this is all an argument of some sort, and he leaves. Katie tells Alison that Henry is just hurt because she panicked when Mike got married. She comes up with an idea to steal the identity of the woman Henry was with earlier at Metro (Ivy Churchill) so she can get Henry to meet her without realizing it's going to be Katie he's meeting. Alison questions the whole idea, but Katie insists that she and Henry love each other, even though it's not like it was with her and Mike, because they're best friends. She tells Alison that if she'll help her with her plot, then she and Henry will name their next rabbit after her. Katie and Alison then go to the Lakeview bar, where Henry is having a drink, and Alison gives Henry an envelope, telling him a woman left it for him at Metro. Henry tells her he knows this must be a plot of Katie's to get to him.\n\n\nCelia and Gwen go to Fashions to look for prom dresses. Celia tells Gwen she thinks Gwen and Will belong together, but Gwen tries to tell Celia that there's a reason why Casey doesn't want her to hang around with Celia. Gwen tells Celia that Casey thinks she's trash, because she lives in a room at Burt's Garage. Celia tries to assure her that that's not true, because Casey's not like that, and that the real reason Casey doesn't want Gwen hanging around is because he wants alone time with Celia. Lisa interrupts and tries to help the girls pick out a dress, but they see the price tags and realize they can't afford them. They try on some dresses from the sale rack, including one that Gwen says makes Celia look 40-something, and while Celia is still wearing that dress, the 2 snobby girls from school show up and sneer at her behind her back before approaching her to tell her how perfect the dress is and that she should definitely buy it and wear it to the prom. They leave, and Gwen tells Celia that the girls were trying to humiliate her by getting her to buy and wear that dress. Celia agrees, and she decides to try on a pretty dress she can't afford, just to see how it looks.\n\n\nWill runs into Casey, who says he needs someone to talk to, but that it can't get back to Celia. He speaks in riddles about how he was left alone a lot while his parents were avoiding each other (during the Doc Reese fiasco), and he'd go out driving around town until he ran into someone to hang out with, but this was all before Celia arrived in Oakdale and had nothing to do with her, but it would hurt her if she found out. Casey finally says something about not having been able to get concert tickets to see Beyonce, and that Celia will be disappointed, and although it's obvious Will knows this is not what has Casey so upset, he doesn't know what it's really all about. Will tries to reassure Casey that Celia really likes him and that it will all be alright, and Casey asks Will to pick Celia up from Fashions and take her to Metro for a prom committee meeting.\n\n\nWill goes to Fashions and runs into Gwen; he asks if Celia is there, and she asks if Casey is with him. Then Gwen leaves, and Will sees Celia modeling the prom dress she really wants for Lisa, who tells her how beautiful it is and offers a discount on it, but Celia tells Lisa she still can't afford it. Later, at Metro, Celia is with Casey and Will when a waitress brings over a package, which turns out to be the prom dress. Excited, Celia assumes Casey's grandmother told Casey that she wanted the dress and so he bought it for her.\n\n\nJack and Carly go to the farm to see Emma but run into Holden instead. They tell him that Keith has agreed to let JJ stay with them, and they want to throw JJ a party to celebrate. Carly leaves to go visit Lily, while Jack stays and talks to Holden, who tells him that Lily and Keith are already sleeping together. Jack tells him he thinks Holden is so upset because he still loves Lily, and Holden agrees. But Holden says he doesn't have the right to stop Lily from moving on with her life; Jack says he does have the right to tell her how he feels.\n\n\nLucinda goes to visit Lily and gives Keith more grief about his shady past, but Keith tells Lily that what Lucinda is really upset about is that she thinks he murdered his sister, to get JJ's trust money. He points out that if that was what he wanted, he could have called the police and turned Julia in, because they would have given him custody of JJ and control of the trust fund. Lily tells Lucinda to leave. After she leaves, Keith tells Lily that maybe he should just go back to Chicago after all, until she has straightened out everything with Holden and the kids, but Lily tells him she'll hate him if he leaves after having made her feel so wonderful. He tells her he'll stay but that he wants to cash the check she'd given him earlier so that he can pay off his debts and they can start with a clean slate. Lily agrees, and as Keith is leaving, Carly arrives. After Keith leaves, Lily fills Carly in on Lucinda and the private investigator she hired and tells Carly that the only doubts she has right now are because Holden had been with Julia and now Lily is with Julia's brother. Lily says that as far as she's concerned, it's settled that Les killed Julia.\n\n\nKeith goes to Julia's grave and speaks to her, saying she is the only one who knows how long it's been since he's been happy. He says he's sorry that she was cut down in her prime, but that his life just might be beginning again.\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie gets Allison to help her in her latest plan to reconcile with Henry. Katie's plan backfires because Henry knows his wife too well and doesn't fall for her scheme. Holden accepts that his marriage to Lily is over and signs the divorce papers. Will finds out that Celia likes a prom dress that she can't afford so he buys the dress for her. Celia thinks that Casey bought the dress for her and gives him a hug to show her gratitude to him. Keith goes to Julia's grave and apologizes to her because her life was cut short just when she was happy. Keith tells his sister that he is happy and feels that his life has just begun. Lily finds a bottle of bee pollen at Keith's place while she searches for candles for a romantic dinner with him.",
