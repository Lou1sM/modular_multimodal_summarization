She said Casey had paid her back with money he borrowed from Emily. Casey arrived home, too late to tell his parents about the situation himself. Lisa left, after telling them all that she loved them. When Tom and Margo asked why Casey had stolen the money from Lisa, he told them he had needed it to pay the guard who had helped him and Matt get an early release from prison. Margo and Tom were shocked to hear that. Margo angrily told Casey that if this were anyone else, they would be in booking by now. Casey told Margo to go ahead and arrest him if that was what she needed to do. \n\n\nCasey told them that nothing he could say would matter; only what he did mattered. Tom agreed. Margo told Casey she wouldn't arrest him, but he would have to enroll in college again so he could try to get his life back together, and if he had one more screw up, she would arrest him. Casey said he didn't understand how being forced into college would help him learn to take responsibility for his own life. Tom said it was a choice they were giving him, and it was the only one Casey would get for a long time. \n\n\nCasey told his parents he didn't believe he needed school, and he said his job was the right thing for him at that point in time. He could see that Margo was angry in part because of his current connection to Emily, and Margo said that Emily had committed a crime by giving Casey money to help cover up his previous crime. That angered Casey even more, and he told his parents he would live his life the way he saw fit and not be blackmailed into living it the way they wanted him to. He stormed out of the house. \n\n\nTom and Margo tried to comfort one another about what had happened with Casey. Margo told Tom she had to follow through on her threat, or Casey would lose whatever respect he still had for her. Margo wondered how she could ever face her coworkers at the police station in light of what her sons had become. Tom told Margo they would get through it together. \n\n\nCasey went to see Emily and told her what his parents had said. When he said he had turned down their offer of college instead of prison, Emily asked, \"Casey, have you lost your mind?\" She told him his parents were throwing him a lifeline, and he should take it. Casey said that would mean the end of his relationship with Emily, but Emily said there was no relationship to end and that she had meant it when she had told him it was over between them. \n\n\nCasey returned to his parents' house and told them he would sign up for a full summer load of college courses. When Tom asked what had made Casey change his mind, Casey replied, \"Emily.\" \n\n\nMargo went to see Emily and thanked her for having gotten through to Casey. Emily said she thought Margo had been the one who had gotten through, that she herself had just given Casey a little extra shove. Margo thanked her for that and promised to try to not be so hard on Emily in the future, for Daniel's sake. Emily asked Margo if she really would have had Casey arrested, and Margo said yes. Emily said she thought Casey knew that, but she also thought it wasn't the reason Casey had agreed to go back to college; Emily thought Casey had made that decision because he loved his parents. \n\n\nTom asked Casey if he wanted to get therapy or counseling, but Casey said no, he was confident he would never make the same mistake again. Tom told Casey that he loved him and that nothing could ever change that, but he said he would not let Margo \"sacrifice who she is as a person to protect you one more time,\" and that \"if something like this happens again, you're out of here.\" \n\n\nAt Lily's house, the lights flickered and then went out completely. Lily tried to fix the problem but couldn't, so she called Holden. Holden couldn't find the problem either but managed to get the power back on with a backup generator. He then offered to take the girls out to Al's for dinner and bring something back for Lily. Lily agreed, and the girls left with their dad. \n\n\nLucinda came to visit Lily and told her she was out of her mind for having left the farm and Holden behind. Despite Lily's explanation that it was her way of trying to put her family back together, Lucinda didn't understand and kept telling Lily she was crazy for leaving Holden and potentially giving Holden the idea that she had given up on their marriage. Lily, upset, told Lucinda, \"If I can live without Holden, I sure as hell can live without you!\" Lily said Lucinda had no idea how bad things had gotten. She told her mother she was fighting hard to get back what she and Holden once had, and she was afraid it might be too late. \n\n\nAt Carly's house, Parker got ready for a movie date with a girl from school named Ashley. Carly was surprised to hear about the date and told Parker she would have to call the girl's mother to make sure it was okay with her (and to make sure Parker was telling the truth about where he was going). Carly and Sage took Parker to Old Town and dropped him off for his date. \n\n\nLiberty put her foot out and tripped Parker and said that was payback for him having ratted her out to her parents. Parker said he was tired of Liberty getting him into trouble, but she said he didn't need to rat on her about kissing Dylan. Parker said he hadn't told anyone about what Liberty and Dylan had been doing, and Liberty thought that because Parker couldn't even bring himself to say \"making out,\" it meant Parker had never even kissed a girl yet. Parker told Liberty that was none of her business. \n\n\nAshley arrived, and she and Parker went to the movie. Liberty sat several rows behind them and kept throwing popcorn at them. Ashley ignored her, but Parker had a harder time doing so. Parker started to put his arm behind Ashley, but Liberty slurped loudly through her straw, which made Parker jump and knock over his popcorn. He wanted to leave, but Ashley said they should stay. \n\n\nAfter the movie, Parker and Ashley sat at a table outside in Old Town, sipping their sodas and discussing the movie. Ashley spotted her mom and said she had to leave. Parker said he had had a great time and asked if they could do it again sometime; Ashley said maybe. Liberty walked up after Ashley left and told Parker the least Ashley could have done was kiss Parker, considering he'd paid for her movie, but Parker said he hadn't bought Ashley's ticket. Liberty told Parker he was clueless and that his next date with Ashley, if there was one, would end the same way this one had. Parker told Liberty to mind her own business, and she left. \n\n\nHolden, Faith, and Natalie ran into Carly and Sage at Al's Diner. The girls wanted to get a table of their own so they could talk about the Jonas Brothers, and Carly offered to sit with them so Holden wouldn't have to share a table with her. Holden insisted he and Carly sit together instead. As the girls talked, Carly could see that Sage was looking uneasy and correctly assumed the girls were talking about riding horses at the upcoming summer camp. She explained to Holden that Sage was actually afraid of horses, and Holden offered to help Sage get over that fear. \n\n\nSage came to the table, and Holden told her he would introduce her to a horse at the farm named Coltrane and would help her make friends with the horse and learn to not be afraid. Holden said they could get started the next day, and Sage was happy. Sage then asked if Faith and Natalie could come home with her and listen to her new CD. Carly and Holden agreed, and Sage went to tell her cousins the good news. Carly asked Holden about his horse named Coltrane, and Holden said, \"Very smooth, very cool-like me!\" \n\n\nCarly and Holden drank a beer out on Carly's porch and talked. They agreed to forget about what had happened the day before, when Lily had moved out of the farm in part because of Carly's advice. Holden said they could drop that subject after he apologized to Carly for having been too hard on her. She made a witty remark about offering relationship advice, and Holden asked if one-liners were her defense mechanism. Carly said Holden had figured her out pretty quickly, but Holden said he didn't think anyone had ever figured Carly out. Carly said that was probably true, herself included. \n\n\nCarly shivered, and Holden gave her his jacket. Carly then told Holden she could tell he was going through hell, and she asked him to talk to her, or talk to someone. He told Carly he was surprised at how far things had gone with him and Lily. He said he wasn't connecting with Lily anymore and didn't know how that could improve since she had moved back home. Carly said maybe things had to get really bad before they could start getting better, but Holden wasn't sure about that. \n\n\nHolden decided it was time to leave, and he thanked Carly for listening. He took the girls back to Lily's. Lily invited Holden to stay for a cup of coffee, but Holden said he had an early day coming up and would have to decline the offer. Meanwhile, back at Carly's, Carly realized she was still wearing Holden's jacket. She pulled the jacket tighter around her and smiled.\n\n\n",

Once Ashley has ended her date with Parker Liberty tells Parker Ashley won't date him again. Parker is embarrassed when Liberty figures out he has never kissed a girl. Liberty offers to help Parker have a better date the next time he goes out with a girl. Lily has a power outage at the house and Holden comes over to activate the backup generator. Holden takes the girls to dinner at Al's and runs into Carly and Sage. Carly tells Holden Sage is afraid of horses so he offers to give Sage horseback riding lessons. Lucinda thinks Lily made a bad decision moving out of the farm. Holden tells Carly he feels he has lost his connection to Lily. Emily encourages Casey to tell Tom and Margo the truth about the money. Casey arrives home but Lisa has already told Tom and Margo the truth. Casey cries as he apologizes to Tom and Margo and explains why he took the money from his grandmother. Margo tells Casey to go back to college or go back to jail. Casey refuses to accept Margo's terms until Emily persuades him to go back to college because they have no future together. Margo thanks Emily for helping Casey change his mind and Emily tells Margo she thinks Casey is going back to college because he loves his parents.",
