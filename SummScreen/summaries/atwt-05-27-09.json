    "soap_central": "\n\n \nFirst thing in the morning, Lily told Meg that Holden was hopeful that some new leads would pay off in the search for Paul and Eliza. Meg was discouraged that it was taking so long, and Lily suggested that the two of them do something fun to pass the time. Meg was glum and didn't feel like doing much. \n\n\nAt the foundation office, Noah joined Luke and Damian, and Luke told him that Damian had arranged it so they could postpone the children's cruise without taking a hit. Luke was very worried about Eliza, and he didn't feel that they should leave town at that moment. Noah remarked that a man with an infant would be easier to spot than a man alone, and Luke scolded Damian that all he had done was to make things worse by allowing Paul to see him and Meg at the airfield. Luke questioned why his father was so involved in the search anyway, since Meg and the baby weren't part of Damian's family. Damian responded that Luke's family was his family. \n\n\nLuke accepted Damian's premise, but he stated that he thought it would be better if Damian backed off a bit. Luke left for home, and Noah commented that Luke and Damian's relationship seemed to be two steps forward and one step backward. Damian said that he was sure that if Paul came face-to-face with Meg, she might be able to get through to him. Noah said there might be a way to make that happen, and he suggested that if Meg made a videotape in which she talked straight to Paul, it might reach him on the Internet. If they were lucky, the clip would go \"viral,\" and reach all over the world. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Craig awoke and announced that Carly's couch was his new home away from home until further notice. Carly said she was going to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, so Craig didn't need to babysit her any longer. Craig told Carly he was going with her to the meeting and would  watch her walk through the door. He retrieved a card from his wallet and said there was a meeting in about 15 minutes. He left his wallet on Carly's desk, however, as the two of them picked up the living room. Carly told Craig he was being ridiculous and that he would just have to trust that she was going to the meeting. \n\n\nCraig was adamant. He said that until Carly proved that she could manage her own life, he was in charge. He pushed to get Carly moving and then hustled her out the door. Parker walked downstairs as soon as they left and found Craig's wallet. He took money out and threw the billfold on the coffee table. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Jack slept through Janet's breakfast of delicious French toast. He said he had only gotten a couple of hours sleep, and those were ruined by dreams of Craig Montgomery and his children. He said he could not ignore his subconscious, which was telling him that allowing the kids to stay with Carly was a huge mistake. Janet was supportive of Craig's helping Carly, and she suggested that Jack try to stop brooding. Jack was looking for a guarantee that in a finite time, his family would be past Carly's drinking and Parker's adolescence. Janet promised him that would all happen, and they hugged. \n\n\nCraig and Carly arrived at Memorial and found the room where the AA meeting was to take place. Carly claimed that she was fully functional and had only been stopped once for a DUI. No way did she consider herself an alcoholic, and she didn't wish to embarrass herself by announcing that in front of \"a bunch of drunks.\" Craig wanted to wait until the meeting was over, but Carly promised to call his cell phone when she was finished. He gave her a kiss on the cheek and wished her good luck. Carly went through the door, but she didn't stay long. A man followed her out and tried to strike up a conversation, but Carly dismissed him. \n\n\nParker got a soda from the kitchen and returned to the living room where he spied Craig's wallet. He sat down and stashed the wallet under the couch just as Craig walked in. Parker's friendly greeting to Craig was, \"Don't you have your own place?\" Craig replied that Carly needed him, and Parker continued with his sarcastic remarks. \n\n\nCraig said he really wanted the two of them to be friends again, but Parker was still angry about Craig's trashing Parker's new car. Craig told the boy to dial back the self-pity, and Parker accused Craig of trying to score points with his mother by \"handling\" Parker. Craig missed his wallet and asked Parker if he had seen it. Parker denied it and told Craig to call the cops if he didn't believe him, and he went out. \n\n\nCarly went to Java after her non-meeting and ordered coffee. Parker walked up behind her just as she was emptying a cocktail-size bottle of vodka into it. The boy turned around and walked out in disgust. \n\n\nAt the diner, Janet was stunned when Mr. Vogel, a regular customer, offered her and Jack a free four-day trip to Florida, including hotel and airfare. Janet got excited and dashed to the police station to talk to Jack. She was thrilled that she and Jack might get their honeymoon after all, but the offer was only good until the end of the month. Jack said it sounded fantastic, but there was no way he could get away with Eliza missing. \n\n\nJack was also worried about his decision to allow the kids to stay with Carly, so he promised that he would make it up to Janet. Suddenly, he did a 180 and reversed himself. He told Janet that not that much would change in four days, and he was tired of always putting her last. They were going to Florida! \n\n\nDamian and Noah went to Lily's to present the video idea to Luke, and Lily and Meg listened, as well. Everyone thought it was a great plan because it was a way to reach out to Paul no matter where he was. Noah asked for photos and home videos and explained that Meg's heartfelt appeal would be the climax. Meg agreed and thanked them all. They all decided that it would be most effective to shoot at Fairwinds where Eliza lived. \n\n\nCraig continued looking for his wallet, and he finally spotted it under Carly's couch. He opened it and saw that $300 was missing. Carly arrived at the front door and saw Craig inside, so she stopped and used breath freshener. Craig asked how the meeting had gone, and Carly replied that it was interesting, but not for her. Craig reminded her that Jack was only letting her keep the kids because she had promised to follow the AA program. \n\n\nParker returned home, and Craig inquired about his wallet. He told Parker that his money was missing, but Parker denied any involvement. When Craig pressed, Parker said he had a pretty good idea where the money had gone, and he asked Carly to tell Craig what she had done with his money. \n\n\nCarly realized that she was being blackmailed by her own son, but she went along and admitted that she had taken Craig's money because she was short of cash and had no time to go to an ATM. She had no explanation as to how the wallet had ended up under the couch, but she lamely said she must have dropped it. Parker went upstairs, and Craig told Carly that he admired the Texas Two-Step that she and Parker had just executed. Carly played dumb, and then she took the offensive and shouted to Craig that he was smothering her. She demanded her own space, and Craig made a hasty exit. \n\n\nCarly called to Parker to get his \"butt downstairs immediately,\" and he did. Carly said she knew that he had seen her imbibing in Java, but that gave him no right to steal from Craig. They shouted at one another, and Carly swore that she would not take another drink. Parker said that Craig owed him, all right, but the man seemed more eager to get into Carly's pants than to make things right with Parker. Carly was shocked at Parker's language, but he further threatened her that Craig might be very interested that Carly was still drinking. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, the video crew set the scene, and Damian encouraged Meg just to be herself and tell Paul how she felt. Meg sat on the couch next to Eliza's bassinet and spoke calmly to Paul. She said she knew how much he loved the baby, but Eliza needed both her parents to love her. She broke down in tears at the end, and Lily comforted her. Luke and Lily both thanked Damian for renting the video equipment. \n\n\nJack and Janet ran into Craig in Old Town, and Jack was surprised to learn that Carly had actually gone to a meeting. Jack asked if anything else was going on at the house, and Craig said that Parker had lifted $300 from his wallet, but the most interesting thing was that Carly had covered for the boy. Neither man could figure out why Carly would do that, but each had a bad feeling about it. Craig went into the diner, and Janet arrived back after buying a bathing suit for her Florida trip. Craig told her to enjoy the vacation because she deserved it. \n\n\nJack went to Carly's and called Parker downstairs. When the boy arrived, Jack demanded that he empty his pockets for Jack to see. He found some of Craig's cash, and Jack confiscated it. Parker whined, but Jack yelled that if the boy wanted his own money, then he should get a job. Jack sent him upstairs, and then turned to his ex-wife. He asked Carly why she had lied for Parker, and she figured out that he had talked with Craig. Carly maintained that she had taken Craig's money and given some of it to Parker. \n\n\nJack was really upset that Carly was telling him bold-faced lies to protect Parker. He called the boy down again and said that Parker was going to the farm with Jack. He told Carly that she had blown her chance to have the boy with her, and Jack marched Parker outside to his truck. Carly threw her little vodka bottle across the room and it landed in Craig's overnight pile. Carly picked up all of Craig's belongings and stuffed them in a bag and took off. \n\n\nJack took Parker to the diner and asked Janet to get the boy a busboy's apron. Parker would be working at the diner until he earned back the money he had stolen from Craig. Jack did not have to tell Janet that the Florida trip was off; she had figured that out herself. \n\n\nCraig was having a meeting at the Lakeview when Carly stormed in with the bag. She plunked the bag down and told Craig to stay the hell out of her house. She accused him of stabbing her and Parker in the back by consorting with Jack, and Craig had to apologize to his business associate. \n\n\nDamian brought Meg a cup of tea, and the two chatted. Noah called Damian to tell him that the video had been posted on the web, so Damian opened his laptop, and he and Meg watched it. Along with Meg's speech, there were many pictures of Paul and Meg with their baby. \n\n\nOn the co-op farm, Rosanna's friend, Edna, watched the video, too. She recognized Paul right away and mumbled that she knew she didn't like him.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig makes sure that Carly goes to her AA meeting, as Carly is annoyed. Craig walks Carly to her meeting, but she ducks out early and tells one of the people involved that this isn't for her, as the man sees himself in her, but Carly blows it off. Parker steals from Craig's wallet. Craig and Parker have another tiff because Parker is into self-pity again. Craig then calls him on his wallet being gone, but Parker denies it, as he stomps out. Parker then comes across Carly secretly pouring vodka into her coffee and lets her know he saw. When Craig finds his wallet hidden, he calls Parker on it, but Parker manipulates Carly into lying for him. Craig is no fool and calls Carly on covering for Parker, who denies it and tells Craig she wants some space. Janet gets an offer for a free four day trip to Florida and is excited to tell Jack, who doesn't think it is feasible with all that is going on. However, when he sees her face, he changes his mind. Craig bumps into them and asks to speak with Jack. Craig tells Jack what happened with Carly and Parker and they both admit that Parker stealing is bad, but it is more worrisome that Carly lied for him. Meanwhile, Carly is having it out with Parker about what he did, as Parker feels justified, but Carly is incited that he would pull that. Jack arrives to confront them and orders Parker to show the contents of his wallet. An angry Parker does and Jack tells him that he knows what he did. He then tells Carly that she had her chance and since she won't tell him the truth, Parker is coming with him. Jack shows up with a furious Parker telling Janet that she has a new busboy until he pays back what he spent. Janet realizes that they aren't going on their vacation anymore. Carly goes to drink again but has no alcohol so she sees Craig's belongings on her couch and packs them up instead. She then interrupts a business meeting to tell him to get out of her life. Meg is at a loss as to what to do about Paul kidnapping Eliza, as Lily tries to help. Luke is frustrated with Damian thinking he made it worse on Meg, but Noah and Damian come up with a plan to have Meg post a video plea to Paul to get his, as well as Eliza's and Meg's face out there. Meg agrees and with the support of Damian, Lily, Luke and Noah, Meg makes an emotional plea to Paul. Lily and Luke thank Damian, who is busy showing a lot of support to Meg. Damian promises her that Paul will be affected by her words. Meanwhile, Rosanna's employee sees the video and realizes what Paul has done.",
