However, she says that she wants to get back to work.  Ben suggests that they take a beach vacation and Jessica agrees.

The thug makes a mention about a $50 tip and Dusty remembers seeing a $50 bill at the beauty palace.\n\n\nRose is going through all of Paul's things that were left at her place when Lily arrives.  Lily tries to convince her to come stay with her and Holden.  Rose says that Dusty will be staying in town because she asked him to.  Lily is surprised but says that Rose has the right to make her own decisions.  Dusty shows up and Lily says, \"I guess I'll be seeing a lot of you\" and walks away.  Dusty asks Rose about her one client and he realizes that it was Spangler.  Dusty tells Rose that he wants to protect her and gives her a hug.  Just then Barbara walks in and says that she couldn't find Paul in Europe so she came to see if Rose had heard from him.  Barbara becomes nasty and says to Rose, \"You are disgusting.\"  She says she can't wait to tell Paul about this affair with Dusty.  Dusty says, \"You're not going to tell Paul anything.\"  Barbara continues belittling Rose and Rose, who is getting very upset, says she doesn't want to fight with her.  Dusty tries to get Barbara to sit down so he can tell her about Paul but Barbara refuses.  Finally, Rose says you can't find Paul.  Barbara asks, \"And why is that?\"  Rose cries out, \"because Paul is dead.\"  \n\n\nRosanna calls Craig, who is at the police station, and asks him if he was able to make Jack understand.

Craig tells him that when Carly comes home, he'll see that Rosanna is innocent.  Meanwhile, Rosanna is very nervous and Mike comes looking for Carly.  Rosanna says she doesn't know where she is because they don't get along and that Mike is \"the reason we despise each other.\"  Mike says they seemed cozy at the wedding but Rosanna says that didn't last.  She says, \"We will never have peace until she's gone, and she's gone.\"  She then tells Mike that Jack thinks she killed Carly.  She is convinced that Jack sent Mike there to soften her up.  Mike says she isn't capable of murder but Rosanna says he is only there because he is worried about Carly.  They argue and he leaves.  Rosanna calls Craig again and overhears Emma talking about a scarf in the background.  She leaves and Mike follows her.\n\n\nJack arrives at the farm with the search warrant, looking for the scarf that will link Carly's disappearance to Rosanna.  Rosanna shows up at the farm and starts yelling at Craig, hitting him and telling him that he ruined everything.  Craig tells her to stop throwing a tantrum.  Then, Mike arrives and goes to ask Jack what is going on.  Rosanna is still very upset and Craig says he is trying to help.  He says the police won't find anything because she has nothing to hide.
