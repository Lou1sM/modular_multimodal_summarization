Alison tells Chris that first it started with a fib and then it just exploded.  Alison tells Chris, she is working at Metro.  He says, I thought we discussed this, and we figured it wasn't the right place for you.  She says no, you said it wasn't the right place, it was his decision, not hers.  She didn't want to make him mad, so she lied.  Just because he told her something, doesn't mean that it is how she feels.  She says she should have told him, she was going to work there anyway.    She also tells him about the money she owes Metro.  She tells him, she feels she should move out.  It's just not going to work.  Alison and Chris continue to talk.  Kim, Nancy and Bob come in.

Carly tells Jack that she hasn't been entirely truthful with him.  He tells her he figured that Rosanna probably swore her to secrecy.  Carly tells Jack that Jordan is Cabot's real Father.  She also tells him that she knows whose been pulling the strings behind this weird arrangement with Cabot.  James Stenbeck.

You don't know what you're signing.  Jordan tells her that after he signs the papers, Rosanna will be the only parent.  She's not the only parent, says Jennifer. She calls Rosanna a self-centered person who won't even trust the man who turned his life upside down to try to help her.  You don't care about Jordan.  You only cared about getting Cabot. You have no right to him.  She shows Jordan the papers she found at Rosanna's.  Jordan goes over them, saying they are lab reports of DNA tests, of Cabot and his Father.  So, she knows who the Father is.  Rosanna tells him that rumors started circulating and she had the test done.  The man wasn't aware of it but he had made it clear that he wanted to move on with his life.  Jennifer calls Rosanna selfish and unethical.  Jennifer tells Jordan that he is Cabot's Father and she wasn't going to tell you.  Rosanna tells Jennifer that she felt she knew his feelings on the subject.  He wanted to be free so he could be with you.  Paul tells Jennifer not to make it worse than it already is.  Jennifer says, she was going to let him sign his rights away without knowing he has a living, breathing child.  How much worse could it be?  Jordan asks Rosanna, were you ever going to tell me Cabot was mine?  Rosanna tells Jordan, that Cabot was his.  Jordan asks who the Mother was?  Rosanna gives him her name, but he doesn't recognize it.  He says he was always careful because of being brought up in an orphanage, he didn't  want anything to happen.  Rosanna says, who knows why he wasn't notified?  Maybe  the Mother didn't want Cabot to be a burden, or she wanted Cabot to go to someone who would love him unconditionally.  She asks Jordan to please give him to her.  He will have a good life and she can take care of him, please just sign the papers.  Jennifer says that whoever set this up knew the truth, why else would they want Jordan.  Jordan is not thrilled.  Jennifer tells him he grew up in an orphanage, he has someone he belongs to now.  Jordan tells Rosanna, he will sign the papers.  She is a good Mother.  Jennifer is shocked.  She talks Jordan  out of it.  You owe it to Cabot to realize that someday he will want to know his Father. Jordan tells Rosanna, he needs time to figure out what he wants.  A piece of paper changes everything. Jordan, finally says that, as is Father, he has that right.  Rosanna, who is ready to fall apart, tells Jordan they will start over, and, for Cabot's sake, will work everything out.  She tells Jordan that perhaps he and Jennifer would like to come over and babysit that evening.  She is sorry that she didn't tell him everything before, she should have.
