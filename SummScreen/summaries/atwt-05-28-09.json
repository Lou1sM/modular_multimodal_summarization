He also said Henry was way out of line to blame Katie for the miscarriage. Brad took Katie's temperature, but it was normal, and he volunteered to make her something to eat. The thought of food turned her stomach, however, so Katie suggested that Brad go somewhere and get a good lunch. \n\n\nAfter Brad left, Katie took a home pregnancy test kit from her bedside table and looked at it. Aloud she said that she must be crazy because it was impossible that she might be pregnant, and she put the kit back. In a minute she took it out again and went to the bathroom. She waited the required time and then, with crossed fingers, she read the results. She gasped, \"Oh, my God,\" in amazement. \n\n\nHenry was preparing for a meeting with his lawyer, so he was working on his lawsuit against WOAK and Katie. He asked Vienna to describe Katie's behavior before the accident, but that irritated Vienna, and she ordered him to drop the lawsuit. Henry paid no attention and decided on \"malicious intent\" to describe their former friend. Vienna reminded him that all the money in the world would not replace their child, and she accused him of hiding behind his true feelings. She was headed to a follow-up appointment with her doctor, so she told Henry he was on his own with the lawyer. Henry had a change of heart and told her that she came first, so he would reschedule with the lawyer and go with her, but Vienna was angry and said she would go alone. \n\n\nJack arrived at the diner and gave Janet a big smooch, much to the disgust of their new bus boy, Parker. Janet gave Parker high marks for his work, but all Parker cared about was when he would get his first paycheck. Jack reminded the boy that his paycheck was going to Craig to replace the money Parker had lifted from Craig's wallet, a fact that Parker still denied. Janet gave the boy his share of the tip money, and Parker figured out that if he worked more hours, he could pay off the debt faster. Janet offered him the dinner shift, as well, and Parker accepted. \n\n\nJack was surprised that Parker was willing to work longer hours, and also when Janet informed him that Craig was no longer staying with Carly. Jack was elated until Janet mentioned that it might not be such a good thing. Jack was tired of Craig's manipulating Parker and Carly, but Janet disagreed. She said Carly was a very strong woman and was not easily pushed around. She realized that Jack was truly worried about his ex. \n\n\nCarly ordered a cappuccino at Java as Craig walked in. She reminded him that she had requested him out of her life because they were no longer friends, since he had ratted her out to Jack. She headed to Memorial and stood outside the door to the AA meeting. The man with whom she had talked the day before arrived and asked if she was going in to share that time, and Carly said yes. When she got to the door, however, she stopped and suddenly \"remembered\" a dental appointment for Sage. She scooted out fast, but she failed to notice that Craig was lurking in the shadows, watching. \n\n\nCraig went to the diner and told Jack and Janet what he had seen. Janet remarked that Carly was really in trouble if she was faking going to therapy. Craig admitted that Carly was no longer talking to him, and he was stumped as to how to help her. Jack suggested that he stop trying. Craig was afraid that he was partially responsible for how she was, because he had been in denial about her drinking. Craig feared that Carly was lost, and he was out of ideas. \n\n\nJanet said that the solution for Carly was for her to get involved in some sort of a project to take her mind off her troubles. Jack cited Craig's vodka business as a project gone bad, but both Janet and Craig thought that Carly needed to focus on her design skills. Craig all of a sudden had an epiphany. He thanked the Snyders for giving him a great idea, and he hurried out. \n\n\nHenry walked into the Lakeview bar not far from where Brad was eating his lunch. They noticed each other, and Henry jumped up to leave, but Brad called him back. Brad asked Henry to join him and try to work things out, but Henry refused and alluded to his lawsuit. Brad told Henry again how sorry he was that he and Vienna had lost their baby, and he offered Katie and himself as help in a time of need. Henry said his salvation was the legal system, and that was helping already. Brad got irritated and suggested that he and Katie ought to be dragging Henry and Vienna into court for fraud about the baby's parentage, and the shouting match began. \n\n\nFinally, Brad asked Henry to sit with him and try to end the trouble between their families. Henry sat, and Brad asked him if he was prepared to get on the witness stand and accuse Katie of awful deeds. He said Katie was devastated already, and that he wasn't sure how much more she could take. Brad offered to return the $10,000 that Henry had repaid him, but Henry refused it. After some discussion, the two agreed that they would give the money to charity and let it do some good work. Henry also agreed to drop the lawsuit, but he balked at forgiving Katie for her actions. He did, however, promise to think about it. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Vienna arrived for her appointment just as Katie was coming out of an exam room. They hugged, and Vienna assumed that Katie was there to support her friend, although Vienna did not remember telling her about the appointment. They shared some good memories about their lost babies, and then a nurse approached Katie and congratulated her on her \"miracle,\" and said that her sonogram would be ready shortly. Vienna looked confused, and finally she realized that Katie must be pregnant. Katie tried to deny it, but Vienna knew the truth from Katie's face; it upset her, and she ran off. \n\n\nAfter her appointment, Katie went to see Vienna and swore that she had just found out that day that she was pregnant. Vienna hailed it as a true miracle, but Katie was sorry that her best friend was suffering. Katie knew that it was asking a lot, but she said she needed her friend by her side. Vienna said she would try to stand by Katie as best she could. Then Katie revealed that she had not yet told Brad about the baby, and Vienna was shocked. \n\n\nKatie cautioned Vienna not to speak about it to Brad because she was concerned that Brad would consider the pregnancy too risky, and she needed a couple of weeks to have some tests and speak with the doctors. She just wanted to make sure everything was all right before she got Brad's hopes up. Vienna understood and promised to keep Katie's secret and also to be godmother to the baby. \n\n\nLiberty and a friend exited Fashions, and Liberty bemoaned the fact that she could not afford the lovely prom dress that she had just seen in the shop. She was trying to get used to the idea of settling for a less expensive, and less beautiful, dress. Parker hid around the corner and listened to the girls' conversation. Liberty went into the diner and tried to sweet-talk her mother, but Janet was wise and almost immediately asked the girl what she wanted. Liberty told Janet about the dress, and reminded her mother that it was the prom they were discussing, and she asked if Brad might buy the dress for her. Janet nixed that idea because of his recent troubles. \n\n\nThen, however, Janet remembered how she had missed some fun high school events because of having Liberty so young, so she gave her daughter her credit card and said she would get Brad to chip in half at a later date. She also asked if Liberty was going with Parker, but her daughter said she was going with her friend, Mackie, and several girls in a group. Liberty was sure that Parker wouldn't mind or even be remotely interested, since he was finished with school. \n\n\nLiberty and her friend were in Java when Parker walked in. The friend split, and Parker sat down and spied the prom dress in its wrapper from Fashions. He announced that it was time to make plans, but he told her not to worry because he had already rented his tuxedo. \n\n\nWhen Liberty looked confused, Parker reminded her that she had promised him long ago that she would go with him. She interrupted him to say that she had made other plans. Parker asked with whom, and when Liberty mentioned her girl friends, Parker did not believe her. Parker insisted they would have fun together, but Liberty said that her final answer was no. Parker walked out. \n\n\nCraig dropped in on Carly, who did not want to open the door until he threatened to huff, puff, and blow her house down. She declared that she had gone to the AA meeting and offered to take a breathalyzer test. Craig said he wanted to talk business, not alcohol. He said he had a new business looming on the horizon, and the business was - water. He wanted to sell flavored, designer water, with Carly as the designer. He said he was talking vitamins, flavorings, and sexy packaging. He wanted to market the product to young people , and he wanted Carly to come up with a concept that was \"cool.\" The customer would be young and healthy, someone very much like Parker. \n\n\nCraig declared that he had another brainstorm and suggested that Parker be in their ads and even be the spokesperson for the product. Carly thought Craig pitied her, but he implored her to give the spark of life to his idea. He wanted her to come up with a phrase or a look as their concept, and he would market it to investors. Craig said it would be good for her and Parker, and asked her to think about it. He promised their relationship would be strictly business. \n\n\nNext, Craig went to see Jack at the police station and told him that his plan for Carly might work. Surprisingly, Jack said it was a great idea, and neither one could believe that they had actually agreed on something. Jack scared off Craig when he asked him if he wanted to \"hug it out.\" \n\n\nParker returned home and found Carly sketching. She explained that she had an interesting idea for designer water and mentioned that she and Craig thought that Parker would be an excellent spokesperson. That elicited a \"no way\" from Parker, and then he lit into his mother about Craig's influence on their lives. He also declared that designer water was a \"crock.\" He said that he already had a job at the diner, and he knew that he would be there the next day. He was not so sure about his mother. Carly fought back tears as she grabbed her purse and made a hasty exit. She went to Yo's and ordered a ginger ale, which she almost immediately changed to vodka. \n\n\nHenry went home and told Vienna that he had spoken to Brad. He said the upshot was that he was dropping the lawsuit. He asked about Vienna's doctor's appointment, and she reported that she had gotten a clean bill of health. She hinted that they could try again soon for another baby, but Henry flatly refused. \n\n\nKatie just barely beat Brad home, but she heard him coming, so she dashed straight into her bed, totally clothed. Brad noticed that she was looking much better, and he told her that he had finally talked some sense into Henry. The lawsuit was history. \n\n\nParker came downstairs to tell Carly that he was working the dinner shift at the diner, but his mother was gone. He looked at her sketches and saw himself in one of them.\n\n\n",
