    "soap_central": "\n\nOn Lily's porch, Luke gave Lucinda a positive update on Noah's progression. Lily approached, looking for Gabriel. To Lucinda's irritation, Lily explained Gabriel's situation to Luke. The women bickered about Gabriel and Craig, and Luke discovered that Lily's car was missing. At Lily's request, Luke left to check for Gabriel and the car at the Lakeview.\n\n\nLucinda warned that Lily's guilt over Gabriel would put them in danger, but Lily insisted that she owed Craig and Gabriel her compassion. Lucinda doubted that Lily would find absolution, and Lucinda reasoned that if Craig had been a responsible father, they wouldn't have kept the secret for 20 years. As the women debated, the police called Lily about her car, and Lucinda wondered if her daughter would finally listen to reason about Gabriel.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Reid discharged Noah, who was frustrated that his sight hadn't fully recovered. Reid couldn't promise anything, but he was optimistic about it. Reid assumed that Noah would call Luke for a ride, but Noah decided to ask his friend, Richard, for assistance. Richard entered, and Reid left. Richard asked who the hot doctor was. Noah shrugged, saying that he'd had no idea that Reid was \"hot.\" Noah wondered why Luke hadn't mentioned it.\n\n\n       A nurse administered Noah's eye drops and left. Noah's eyes started burning, and when he went to the sink, he looked into the mirror to discover that his vision had completely returned. Noah's first reaction was to call Luke, and Richard noted that Noah still loved Luke. Noah admitted it and asked Richard to let Noah announce the vision development on his own.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Luke encountered Reid, who mentioned Noah's release. Luke assumed that Noah hadn't called because he didn't want Luke around. Reid replied that Noah hadn't wanted to be a bother. Luke refused to get upset about it and said he was looking for Gabriel, a possible car thief. Reid offered to help Luke catch the thief.\n\n\nAs the men searched Old Town, Reid remarked that Gabriel had probably blown that dump of a town. Glancing at Luke, Reid softly admitted that the place had its attractions. Luke received a text message from Lily that Gabriel was at the police station. Reid decided to make a house call to check on Gabriel. Reid invited Luke to go-unless Luke wanted to find Noah. Luke replied that Noah must have had his reasons for not turning to Luke, and the men took off.\n\n\nLuke and Reid went to Lily's house, but Gabriel hadn't arrived yet. Reid decided to leave, but catching Reid's arm, Luke asked Reid to keep him company. Reid suggested that they play chess, and Luke suspected that he might get hustled.\n\n\nAfter Reid won a round, he revealed that he'd learned to play chess for fun, but quit when his parents had entered him into championships. Luke wanted to know more about Reid, but Reid shied away from the \"heart on your sleeve\" stuff. Reid said he felt like he was experiencing a high school crush. Luke moved in to kiss the nervously babbling Reid. On the walkway outside the window, Noah glanced in and saw them.\n\n\n       In Dusty's hotel room, Johnny was acting out after learning about Craig's arrest. Janet arrived, and as she and Dusty discussed the problem, a distressed Liberty called to say that she needed Janet at the police station.\n\n\nJanet called Jack, who was busily undressing Carly at home. Janet explained that the police had caught Gabriel and Liberty with a stolen car, and Janet implored Jack to meet her at the police station. As Jack prepared to leave his house, Carly was leery of Jack getting involved with Craig's son. Jack responded that Liberty needed him, and Carly decided to go, too.\n\n\n       When everyone gathered at the police station, Jack found out that Liberty wouldn't be charged with anything. Though Liberty wanted to stay to support Gabriel, Janet pressed Liberty to leave. Lily arrived and lied to Jack that she'd given Gabriel permission to use her car. As Jack orchestrated Gabriel's release, Lucinda pulled an officer aside to ask for a favor.\n\n\nIn the holding cells, Gabriel pleaded with the guards to remove him from Craig's cell. Craig said he was family, and he offered to help with Gabriel's arrest. Gabriel retorted that Craig had been jailed by his own sister, and if Gabriel even wanted a father, he wouldn't choose Craig.\n\n\n       Craig asked why Gabriel hadn't revealed his identity. Gabriel said that he'd wanted to see the real Craig. Craig made up excuses for the embezzlement and the fire, and he cited that a blackmailing Gabriel wasn't innocent, either. Gabriel claimed that he hadn't blackmailed Craig for the money, and Craig figured that Gabriel had just wanted to watch Craig squirm. \"You said it, not me, Dad,\" Gabriel quipped.\n\n\n       Craig was willing to take the blame for mistreating Lydia, but Craig wouldn't go down for something that he hadn't done. Gabriel asserted that Craig had been there before the fire, because Gabriel had said that it was so. Gabriel asserted that he'd won, but Craig warned that Gabriel wouldn't like the outcome, if he insisted upon taking Craig on.\n\n\n       Lucinda entered the holding area with an officer. Gabriel took note of them and quickly dragged his father's hands to his throat. Gabriel fell back on the bed and pretended that Craig was choking him. The officer pulled the prisoners apart, and Gabriel claimed that Craig was trying to prevent Gabriel was testifying.\n\n\nAfter the officer removed Gabriel from the holding cells, Lucinda snickered to Craig that he'd never be a father to that young man. Craig was glad that Lucinda had enjoyed the show that she'd bribed the officer into letting her see. Craig asserted that Lucinda owed him for the lies that she'd kept, and he insisted that she help him out of there. She scoffed at his audacity, and Jack arrived to say that she shouldn't be there.\n\n\nLucinda left, and Craig stopped Jack to say that Jack was Craig's only chance. Jack saw no reason to help Craig, but Craig stated that Jack knew that Gabriel was lying. Craig told a silent Jack that Craig could only appeal to Jack's repugnant sense of fairness. Before Jack could leave, Craig asked Jack to do something that wouldn't cost a thing.\n\n\n       Alone in the interrogation room with Carly, Gabriel said he was sorry for taking Parker's money. Gabriel promised to give back what he hadn't spent. Carly stated that she only cared about keeping Parker clear of the whole mess. Lily entered to take Gabriel home. Gabriel said that he'd leave with her, but that didn't mean that he'd stay on at her house.\n\n\nLily, Lucinda, and Gabriel went to the Lakeview. Lily convinced Gabriel to stay at her house; however, when Lily went to her office, Lucinda offered Gabriel money to testify against Craig and then get out of town. Gabriel admitted feeling sorry for Craig, but Lucinda stated that pity was how Craig sucked in his victims. Lily returned, and Lucinda and Gabriel pretended not to be talking about anything significant.\n\n\n       Back in Dusty's room, Dusty suggested that Johnny draw Craig a card, but an angry Johnny scribbled dark, messy lines all over the page. As Dusty tried to console Johnny, Janet and Liberty arrived. Dusty advised Janet to let Johnny have his meltdown, but Janet told Johnny that she didn't blame him for being angry. Johnny suddenly threw his arms around Janet.\n\n\n       Johnny cheered up when everyone admired his other drawings. As Liberty and Johnny drew something else, Dusty thanked Janet for her help. He figured that he needed to become Johnny's legal guardian before Craig's situation worsened. She remarked that Johnny was lucky to have a father like Dusty. Dusty replied that the boy was lucky to have a mother like her.\n\n\nJanet was caught off-guard by the statement, and Dusty said there was no pressure. The baby kicked, and Janet let Johnny feel it. Dusty hinted that their family would be just like that, if she did decide to marry him. Just then, Jack called to ask Dusty to let Craig see Johnny. Dusty refused, but Jack urged Dusty to do it Johnny's sake.\n\n\n       Dusty and Johnny left, and Janet asked Liberty for the truth about the drive with Gabriel. Liberty said that Gabriel wanted to run away, and Janet worried about Liberty's future. Liberty felt as if she could be Gabriel's friend and concentrate on her future at the same time. Janet asked if her daughter had feelings for Gabriel, and a stammering Liberty admitted that she did.\n\n\n       Later, Dusty arrived at the police station with Johnny, and Craig convinced an officer to remove the cuffs for the visit. Dusty advised Craig to reassure Johnny. When Johnny entered, he hugged Craig, and Craig promised that he'd be home soon. He asked Johnny to get to know Gabriel and to let Gabriel know how much Johnny wanted to have Craig at home.\n\n\n       When Carly and Jack got home, Jack revealed his belief that Gabriel was lying about the incident before the fire. Carly told Jack to just leave it alone. She felt that, with Parker free, they could get their life back-if Jack still wanted it. He said that he wanted it more than anything. \n\n\n\n\n",
