She asks who that would be and Spangler says, \"Dusty Donovan.\"  Molly loses her smile and says that she has never heard of him and walks away.  Spangler gets a drink and follows her.  He tells her that he had seen Molly with Dusty.  She tells him that she was under the impression that Dusty had left town.  She walks away again.  Spangler smiles to himself.  \n\n\nDusty and Rose break the news to Barbara that Paul is dead.  At first, she won't believe it and then she breaks down.  Dusty and Rose walk outside to give Barbara some time to herself.  When Rose and Dusty are outside, Rose tells Dusty that after all the things that Barbara had done to her, it tore her apart to tell her the news about her son.  Rose decides to call Lily and have Lily bring some close friends and family over to be with Barbara.  Dusty tells Rose that he has to make a call also.  Rose says, \"Life goes on.  Right?\"  She goes back into the house and Dusty takes out his cell phone and calls Spangler.  Spangler tells him that it is a small world because he was just talking to his friend Molly Mc...whatever her name is.  Dusty tells Spangler to stay away from his friends.  Spangler orders Dusty to meet him at Java Underground.  \n\n\nBack inside Rose's house, she tries to console Barbara.  Barbara tells Rose that she only wanted her son to love her again, but instead he died hating her.  Rose tells her that her family and friends are on their way to be with her.  Barbara breaks down and starts to cry again.  Rose and Barbara have a heart to heart talk about Paul.  Barbara can't get over the fact that Paul may have died hating her.  Rose tries to console her.  There is a knock at the door and Rose opens the door and Lucinda is there.  Rose whispers to Lucinda that Barbara knows about Paul.  Lucinda starts to leave and Rose grabs her and asks her to say something to Barbara.  Lucinda walks over to Barbara and tells her how special Paul was.  There is another knock at the door and Rose opens the door.  Kim and Lisa are there to console Barbara.  As the women are hugging, Rose says that she is going to give them some time and she is going to go for a walk.  Barbara stops her.  Barbara asks Rose if she thinks that Paul would have forgiven her.  Rose tells Barbara that Paul had said that kids owe their parents a lot of chances, because the parents gave their kids a lot of chances in their life.  Barbara asks, \"He said that?\"  Rose says that he did when they had talked about having kids.  Barbara says, \"That was my boy.  He was kind and generous.\"  Then Barbara adds, \"Thank you.\"  Barbara wipes her tears away.  \n\n\nWhen Dusty gets to Java Underground, he finds Spangler.  Spangler tells him that he knows that Dusty is staying in Oakdale because he has a new scam going on and Spangler demands to be in on it.  Dusty tells him that he doesn't have a scam going.  Spangler then tells him that he has a plan to use Rose to get to Lucinda Walsh.  Dusty refuses and gets up to leave.  Spangler grabs Dusty and asks him if he has seen a man with broken kneecaps.  Dusty gives in and says that he will go along with the scam.  \n\n\nJessica has Evelyn come over to talk about giving her a job at the D.A.'s office.  Evelyn tells her that it just won't work.  She explains that Jessica is too much of a public figure since the rape trial.  Jessica can't believe that she is now being punished for standing up for her rights.  Evelyn apologizes and leaves.  After Evelyn is gone, Jessica says, \"Damn it, Marshall.  Is this ever going to end?\"  \n\n\nJack shows Rosanna the scarf that they found buried in the flower garden.  Jack tells Rosanna that it belongs to Carly and he asks her what she did with her sister.  Rosanna can't believe that Jack is accusing her of doing something to her sister.  When Jack can't get Rosanna to answer his questions, he takes her to the police station for questioning.  Jack also takes Emma's gardening tools in for testing.  \n\n\nAt the police station, Jack questions Rosanna.  He asks Rosanna when was the last time she saw Carly.  Rosanna says that it was outside the police station and they did argue.  She informs Jack that it is a family tradition.  Jack asks if she had anymore contact after that.  Rosanna says that she didn't, but she did see Carly through the window at Hal and Emily's house.  She adds that she didn't go in because Carly was talking to Parker and she didn't want to fight in front of him.  Jack asks if she went home.  Rosanna says that she had car trouble and had to walk back to the farm.  Jack asks how the scarf got buried and Rosanna tells him that it was a mistake.  Margo rolls her eyes.  Rosanna explains that Carly was missing and everyone was starting to blame her and she did not want to be seen as a suspect.  Rosanna asks Jack if he is going to arrest her.  Jack tells her that he doesn't know yet.  Jack says that the only thing that is missing is what happened to Carly and he is not going to let her go until she tells him what she did to Carly.  Margo takes Jack to one side and tells him that all the evidence he has so far is circumstantial and he has to let Rosanna go.  Jack walks over to Rosanna and says that she is free to go.  Before Rosanna can leave, Jack says that if she hurt Carly, he will make her pay.  Rosanna stiffens and walks out.  Jack tells an officer to put a rush on the garden tools that he brought in.  Shortly after Rosanna leaves, Jack gets the results back from the lab and there is blood on the gardening tools and the blood matches Carly's blood.  Jack grabs an officer and starts to the door.  Margo asks where is he going and Jack says, \"To arrest Rosanna Cabot.\"  \n\n\nRosanna walks into the farmhouse and Craig is standing there with Emma.  Rosanna asks why is he still there.  Emma gets Rosanna a cup of coffee and leaves Craig and Rosanna alone to talk.  Craig asks what happened at the police station.  Rosanna says that they just kept asking her the same questions over and over.  Craig asks what did she tell them and she says that she doesn't have anything to tell.  She asks him if he thinks that she killed Carly.  Craig asks her how can she think that.  She says that Jack and Mike Kasnoff thinks she did it.  Craig says that he never listens to anything that Jack says and he never listened to Mike Kasnoff.  Craig tells her that he just wants his life back and she is his life.  She tells him that Carly has gone away on a whim and she will return on a whim.  She turns to him and says that the thing that she sees is that Carly has made a fool out of him again and she is wondering if it will ever end.  As the two are talking, Jack walks in and says that Rosanna is under arrest.  Craig says that he is arresting her on bogus kidnapping charges.  Jack says that it is not kidnapping anymore, it is now murder.  Rosanna and Craig say, \"Murder?\"  Jack informs them that the gardening tools came back with blood on them that match Carly's blood.  Rosanna is handcuffed and dragged out of the farmhouse.  Craig runs out after her.  He yells, \"Don't be scared!  I will get you some help!\"\n\n\n",
