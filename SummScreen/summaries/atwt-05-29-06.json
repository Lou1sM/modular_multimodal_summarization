    "tvmega_recap": "Will and Maddie disagree over Will's dishonesty with Gwen over how he has now managed to graduate. Gwen counsels Casey on how he can handle his relationship with Maddie better; she thinks he should be more appreciative of her. This conversation causes Casey to step up to the plate and ask Maddie to the Crash graduation party. Things continue to be awkward between Will and Maddie, unknown to Casey and Gwen, as they butt heads over how Will should handle the fact he bought his term paper. Damian and Luke come face to face and it isn't exactly a loving reunion. After Luke storms off, Damian is concerned about the hostility he is seeing in his son, and Lily is forced to share with him that Luke is gay. Jack and Mike talk to Del who tells them about Nick's involvement in Maya's demise. Mike had already started wondering about this considering some information he recently found out. They realize Nick has taken all of his belongings, hotwired Katie's car, and that Carly's purse has been dropped on the garage floor, probably meaning he has both of them. They just don't know where they all have gone. Nick holds Carly and Katie at gunpoint. Carly is starting to realize how dire the situation is becoming and is forced to explain that to Katie who still thinks Nick is just acting erratically. Carly realizes it is up to her to stop Nick because it is becoming apparent things aren't going to end well for them. Katie takes Carly's cue, as they put their seat belts on and join hands as Carly violently swerves the car off the road.",
