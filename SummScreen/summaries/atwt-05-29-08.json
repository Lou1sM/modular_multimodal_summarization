The boys wondered again why Colonel Mayer had taken Ameera with him. A street musician approached Noah and told him to ditch Luke and then he would give Noah a message. Noah was suspicious, but the street player told him he was to go downtown alone or the whole deal was off. Luke saw Noah talking to the musician, but when queried, Noah gave his friend an excuse and tried to get the two of them to search separately. Luke vowed he would not let Noah out of his sight but Noah assured him that he would be careful and keep in touch by texting. He argued that they had to do things the way they had been instructed. \n\n\nIn his hideout, Colonel Mayer awakened a sleepy Ameera and gave her more tea laced with a sleeping medicine. Ameera quickly poured the tea out while the Colonel was not looking and feigned sleep again as the Colonel left after making a phone call. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Meg finished her first shift since being back at work and got into a discussion with Chris Hughes about his troubles with Alison. She told Chris that Alison had spent the night at the Snyder Farm with Aaron. Chris left for the farm and surprised Alison and Aaron having a late breakfast. Chris asked to speak to Alison alone, but Aaron would not allow that. Alison berated Chris for his attitude towards her the last time they were together and Chris stormed out, very angry. \n\n\nMeg discovered that the dress she was going to wear to Sofie's jewelry party was missing from her hospital locker. Mike showed up and volunteered to take her shopping and even offered to pay for a new dress. Meg was reluctant to accept the offer, but did agree to go look for a suitable dress. She found a lovely black one, and Mike overcame her objections and paid for it. \n\n\nBarbara unveiled a special placard announcing Sofie's jewelry collection and took her upstairs to her suite where a hairdresser began working on the girl. In her fantasy, Sofie put on her dress in front of Paul. Meanwhile Paul found his mother in the bar at the Lakeview and Barbara warned him about making any sort of a scene at the party, especially one involving Meg. \n\n\nSofie was putting on her dress when Paul walked in unexpectedly. She asked him to zip her dress as she had in her fantasy. Paul found the price list he had come to get and escorted Sofie down to the party. Paul welcomed the guests and introduced Sofie and her collection. Mike and Meg arrived, and Paul greeted them and complimented Meg on her dress. \n\n\nAt the place where the street musician had sent Noah, Colonel Mayer grabbed his son and kept him moving. Mayer told Noah that he was taking Ameera away and that Noah and his \"friend\" would be free of them and could live their own lives. Noah tried to stop his father, who said that Noah was not man enough to accomplish that. He yelled at Noah to take his \"fairy friend\" and go back to Oakdale because Ameera was coming with him. \n\n\nMeg and Barbara chatted at the party about Meg's relationship with Mike, who had to leave suddenly to handle a crisis at the construction site. Paul offered to show Meg the rest of the jewelry when Meg noticed that Barbara was looking exhausted. She decided to take Barbara upstairs to her suite for a rest and Barbara agreed. Meg sent Barbara off to the bedroom to recoup and was surprised to see Paul come in. Paul told Meg he would like very much to kiss her, and Meg acquiesced by her silence. They shared a kiss and Paul acted like a gentleman. The two of them went back to the party where Paul urged Sofie to speak to the guests about her jewelry designs. Sofie enjoyed the attention but was disappointed when Paul refused to stay and celebrate her success with her. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Aaron and Alison thrashed out Alison's problems with Chris. She was hurt by how he had treated her the last time they had been together and finally told Aaron that she was finished with Chris for good. \n\n\nIn New York, Luke spotted Ameera on the street. She told him how the Colonel had drugged her tea and explained about the phone call she had overheard in which Mayer had mentioned travel plans that included her. Luke sent a text message to Noah who did not respond. \n\n\nColonel Mayer and Noah argued, and Mayer hit his son and knocked him to the pavement. Noah's phone broke when it hit the cement, and Mayer ran off. While Ameera and Luke were discussing their options, a police patrolman walked by and Luke grabbed him and told him his friend, Ameera, needed help, and the officer took her away. Luke then spied Noah on the street and quickly filled him in on his finding Ameera. Luke told Noah his wife was safe in police custody, and Noah reluctantly told his friend that his father had physically hurt him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, the director of the nursing program found Chris and told him that even though Alison had barely passed the written exam, she was decidedly sub-par in her clinical lab skills. Chris intimated that perhaps Alison was over her head in the nursing program, and the director pressed him about what he was really saying. Was he suggesting that Alison should be dropped from the program? Chris told her to do what she thought best. \n\n\nColonel Mayer called Noah, whose phone was working again, and demanded to know where Ameera was. Noah told him she was in police custody, and his father threatened that if Noah did not have Ameera at Pier 17 the next day at noon, both Noah and Luke would die. \n\n\nMike found Meg at the farm and asked her to dinner, but Meg told him she had to decline because she had come to the realization that she was still in love with Paul. Meanwhile, Paul returned to Fairwinds where he was surprised by Sofie, who promptly expressed her gratitude for the party and peeled off her dress. \n\n  \n\n\n",
