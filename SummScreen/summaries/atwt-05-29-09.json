Bonnie then told Dusty about the video that Meg had made and put on the Internet, in which Meg asked Paul to bring Eliza back to her. Dusty thought that was a terrible idea, because it might drive Paul even further underground. \n\n\nRosanna, Paul, and Eliza worked picking asparagus in a field at the cooperative farm. Paul thanked Rosanna again for giving him and his daughter a place to stay. Edna approached and told Paul that she thought Eliza was getting too much sun. She offered to take the baby to the produce stand, to get Eliza into the shade. Paul was uncomfortable with the idea, but Rosanna and Edna convinced him it would be better for the baby. \n\n\nPaul was too preoccupied about Eliza being out of his sight to do much asparagus picking, so he eventually told Rosanna that he was going to get Eliza. When Paul reached the produce stand, there was no sign of Edna. He walked through to the other side and saw Edna getting ready to drive off with Eliza in her car. \n\n\nPaul stopped Edna, and Rosanna approached. Edna told them about having seen Eliza's mom on the Internet video, and she announced she was going to return Eliza to Meg. Paul told her she couldn't do that, but Edna told him to leave her alone, or she would call the police. When Rosanna asked why Edna hadn't called the police already, Edna said she didn't want to bring any trouble to their community. \n\n\nPaul begged Edna to hear him out, and she agreed to listen to his story. He told her that although he had done some bad things in his life, becoming a father had changed him and made him a better man. He told Edna that Meg had broken his heart by becoming involved with another man, and he said the other man came first for Meg, ahead of the family Paul and Meg had created. Paul said that being at the cooperative farm had helped him see what was important, and he told Edna he thought that he could be a better father to Eliza. Edna reluctantly agreed to give Paul a chance, and she told him not to make her regret it. \n\n\nPaul and Rosanna went to the produce stand and watched Meg's video on a laptop computer. Rosanna asked Paul if he was still in love with Meg, but Paul said he definitely was not. Rosanna said that if Paul had taken Eliza away because he was jealous or because he wanted to get back at Meg for having been with another man, then what he had done was wrong. Paul assured Rosanna that he wasn't using Eliza to get revenge against Meg. After Rosanna walked away, Paul stared at the computer screen and then took out his phone to call Meg. \n\n\nAt Holden and Lily's house, Damian told Meg the video had already received over 280,000 hits, and he was sure someone would recognize Eliza and Paul. Meg then received an e-mail message from Edna, with a photo of Eliza attached. The message told Meg to meet her at an intersection in Wisconsin, which Meg recognized as being near the airfield where she and Damian had seen Paul. Meg jumped up, eager to head out for the rendezvous to pick up Eliza. \n\n\nMeg and Damian went to look for Bonnie and found her with Dusty at the Lakeview. Meg told them what was happening. Bonnie told Meg that the courts had reversed the custody decision, and Meg had been granted full custody of Eliza, so legally, Meg could take Eliza back from Paul. Dusty and Bonnie both thought that Meg should let the police know about the message she'd received. Meg told them that the message had said not to bring the police. Dusty thought that was strange, as was the fact that the person who had sent the message hadn't asked for anything in return for bringing Eliza to Meg. \n\n\nAs Meg waved off their doubts and concerns, she turned to leave, but Dusty stopped her. Dusty told Meg she didn't look like she felt very good. Meg told Dusty that she was fine, and anything he was seeing was just nerves. Damian tried to convince Meg to let him accompany her on her trip to Wisconsin, but Meg insisted that she would go alone, as the message had requested. As Meg turned to leave, she fainted and fell to the floor. \n\n\nAfter Meg regained consciousness, she still wanted to find Eliza. Dusty, Damian, and Bonnie all said that was out of the question. Damian and Dusty offered to go instead, but Meg said the person was expecting to meet a woman. Bonnie then said she would go, although Dusty tried to talk her out of it. Damian said that he would take Meg upstairs to lie down and he would get something for her to eat, to see if that made her feel better, and if that didn't work, he would take her to the hospital. \n\n\nDusty tried to convince Bonnie to let him accompany her to Wisconsin. Bonnie told Dusty that she didn't want him to go with her, and she left. However, after Bonnie arrived at the rendezvous point, Dusty drove up. Bonnie wasn't happy to see him and accused him of scaring off the person who had sent the message. Dusty, however, said it was well past the time the person had said to meet, and he thought it had all been a hoax. \n\n\nBonnie told Dusty to \"go to hell,\" and Dusty got back into his car to leave. Bonnie's car wouldn't start, so she ran and got into Dusty's car. She told him to take her someplace to get help, saying he could still get to hell after that. They arrived at a car repair shop, but the mechanic told Bonnie it would be an hour or two before his wrecker was available. Dusty tried to leave, but Bonnie stopped him. When he said he had been told to go to hell, Bonnie told him to look around, because he was already there. \n\n\nDusty told Bonnie he was going to leave so he could continue to try to find Paul and Eliza. Bonnie asked the mechanic again when her car could be towed and fixed. The mechanic asked if all the people from Illinois were that impatient. Dusty immediately asked if someone else from Illinois had been there, and the mechanic said yes. Dusty asked if it had been a man with a baby, and the mechanic again said yes. Dusty told Bonnie that meant that Paul was there. \n\n\nMeg had a high fever, and Damian applied cold compresses to her face, to cool her down. He managed to convince Meg to try to get some rest. As soon as Meg fell asleep, her cell phone rang. Damian picked it up, but no one said anything. On the other end of the line, Paul looked angry when he heard Damian's voice. \n\n\nCraig went to see Carly, but only Parker was home. When Parker told Craig that he didn't know where Carly had gone, Craig tried to call her. Carly was at Yo's, where a man named Gus had just tried to buy her a drink, which she had declined. Carly answered her phone and lied to Craig, saying that she'd gone out to get some art supplies for the new bottled water project they were working on. Craig told Carly he had some ideas to discuss with her and that he would wait for her to return home. \n\n\nAfter Carly hung up, she decided to accept the free drink from Gus. When Gus tried to make small talk, however, Carly tried to discourage him, saying she didn't want to give him the wrong idea. \n\n\nParker wasn't very happy that Craig had decided to wait for Carly to return home. Craig tried to interest Parker in the bottled water project, but Parker said it wasn't something he wanted to get involved in and that it wouldn't help his mom get over her drinking problem. Craig told Parker that he was part of the problem, and that Parker had two choices: he could wallow in his teen angst and watch his mother go under, or he could get involved and try to help Carly. \n\n\nWhen Parker told Craig that Carly had done plenty of things wrong, Craig pointed out that Parker had contributed to Carly's situation by his own actions. Craig told Parker it was time he understood that and took some responsibility for himself. Parker stalked off and went upstairs to his room. \n\n\nCarly returned home with her art supplies, and Parker went downstairs and was pleasant to her, for a change. After Parker went back upstairs to take some things to Sage's room, Carly asked Craig what that was all about. Craig suggested that Parker was trying to look out for his mom. Carly said she wished that Parker didn't feel like he needed to do that. Carly then asked Craig what his brilliant idea for the water was, and Craig said he thought they should call it \"Midday Sun,\" as a companion to the Midnight Sun vodka line. Carly liked the idea and told Craig that she would try to do some sketches with that in mind, and then she shooed him out the door. \n\n\nAs Carly worked on her sketches, someone knocked on the door. Carly answered, thinking it was Craig again, but it was Gus, the man from Yo's. Gus had brought a bottle of vodka, and he told Carly he thought they could have a party. Carly tried to get Gus to leave. She apologized for having apparently given him the wrong idea, but Gus said there was still time to make it right. As Gus tried to embrace Carly, Parker rushed up and shoved him out the door. \n\n\nCarly tried to lie to Parker, telling him that Gus must have followed her home from the art store. However, Parker had overheard enough to know that Gus had met Carly at Yo's. Parker couldn't believe his mother had resorted picking up men in bars. Carly said it hadn't been like that, and she tried to assure Parker that it wouldn't happen again. \n\n\nAs Carly picked up the vodka bottle that Gus had brought to the house and stared at it, Parker realized that his mom really did have a problem. He told her he could see that even if she meant it when she said she would stop drinking, she was having trouble actually quitting. \n\n\nParker took the bottle into the kitchen and poured the vodka down the drain. Carly told Parker that she did want to stop drinking, but it wasn't easy, because sometimes, she needed something to take the edge off of things. Parker asked if that was because of things that he had done, but Carly told him not to ever think that. She said that she kept telling herself to stop drinking, but then something would take over, and she couldn't help herself. \n\n\nParker said he understood what his mom meant. Carly panicked and asked if Parker was drinking, but he said he was talking about his attitude. He told Carly that he could hear himself being a jerk to her, to Liberty, and to Jack, and he would tell himself that he needed to stop it, but he couldn't. He apologized, and Carly said she was sorry that Parker was so much like her. \n\n\nCarly told Parker that she sometimes wondered if it would be easier for Parker if he were more like his dad, but then she wouldn't let herself pursue the question, because she loved Parker just the way he was. Carly and Parker apologized to one another for the hurt they had caused each other. Carly said they could support one another's choices and help each other that way. \n\n\nParker quietly said that Carly needed to stop drinking. Carly said that Alcoholics Anonymous meetings didn't work for her, just like therapy hadn't worked for Parker, and that neither she nor Parker liked being forced to do something they didn't want to do. Carly said that they both needed to do things in their own way and in their own time. Carly assured Parker that they both would get better. \n\n\nCraig went back to Carly's house, but Parker answered the door and told him that Carly was at an AA meeting at the hospital. Craig was surprised, but Parker said that he and Carly had talked, and they had agreed that Carly needed to get help. Craig was glad to hear that and told Parker he had known that if anyone could get through to Carly, it would be Parker. Craig put down some cookies he had brought over and told Parker to tell Carly that he was proud of her when she got back from her meeting. \n\n\nAfter Craig left, Carly came out of the kitchen and thanked Parker for having gotten rid of Craig. Carly told Parker that they would get through everything together. She said, \"We don't need anybody telling us how to fix what they think is wrong with us, okay?\" Parker nodded.\n\n\n",
