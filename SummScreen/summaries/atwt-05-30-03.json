Dusty plays his con record for a second time, \"I'm gonna leave town...now.\"  Rose says she needs him to stick around, but Dusty squirms and worms his way deeper into Rose's heart.  She pieces together that he's not leaving...he's running away.  Dusty comes clean and tells her that the guy who gave her a $50 tip is Charlie Spangler, the guy he used to work with in Chicago.  He says, \"It turns out I owed him a little more than I thought I did.\"  Rose wonders if he threatened him, but Dusty says, Charlie threatened her instead, and that's why he has to leave town.  He tells the truth and says Charlie is after Lucinda's money and he wants to go through Rose to get it.  Molly is outside listening to the conversation.  When Rose says that she can dip into a line of credit Lucinda has established for her, Molly bursts in, stares Dusty down, and says, \"Don't you dare Rose.
