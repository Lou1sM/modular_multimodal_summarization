Carly knocks him out again and urges Katie to run for help, since Carly is trapped and can't move. Katie calls Jack and tells him that Nick still has Carly! Jack goes searching for his wife, while Mike finds Katie. Jack locates the crashed car...but no sign of Nick or Carly. Maddie sees Will's grade on the Calculus final and realizes he cheated, then she sees Nate with Jade and figures out how he did it. Gwen, meanwhile, wonders why Will isn't on top of the world...and what Maddie's problem is with Jade? Damian wonders if maybe Lily and Holden's parenting is what drove Luke to question his sexuality. Damian offers to help Lily with her problem. Lily says she'll consult with Holden, and Damian leaves. Luke apologizes for accusing his mother of having him followed, and reiterates that he doesn't think he's gay, he knows he is. He adds that he also knows, if it came down to a choice between him being happy and being gay, what Lily would choose. At the Lakeview, Damian has a reunion with Lisa. After, Lily goes to Damian and says she will accept his help \u2013 without asking Holden.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Damian finds it incomprehensible that his son could be gay. He starts to question things: Was Luke too close to Lily? Was Holden a good father? Did Holden hurt her and Luke witnessed it? Lily explains that Holden did leave her for another woman, but they are together and stronger now. Their parenting skills were fine; she resents him implying otherwise. She is having a hard time with Luke's admission as well and would like him to see a therapist, but Holden thinks that will convince Luke they think something is wrong with him. Damian agrees to do it her way for now. The Calculus exam grades are posted online, and Maddie learns she got a lower grade then Will did, and realized the paper wasn't the only thing Will cheated on. Maddie connects the dots regarding Jade's involvement in helping Will cheat. She confronts her when she sees her trying to blow Nate off. Later she warns Gwen about her but won't explain why other then her connection to Luke's family. After the car accident, Katie tries to wake Carly up. Carly's legs are pinned, and when they are trying to get her out, Nick awakens. Carly nails him with a backwards- right punch and Nick is out for the count again. Mike and Jack realize Nick never turned in his service weapon and now they have to consider the possibility that he is armed and dangerous. Katie runs for help and calls Jack who is with Margo and Mike preparing to send out reinforcements. Katie is able to give a vague description of where they are. Gwen senses something is wrong with Maddie, but agrees to drop it, promising Maddie that there should be no secrets between them. Will claims Maddie is simply bent out of shape because he got a higher grade then she. Luke apologizes to Lily for accusing her of calling Damian, but their talk goes sideways and soon Luke is storming out. Lily calls Holden for help, but he is unavailable, so Lily goes and finds Damian. Nick won't leave Carly pinned in the car so Jack can play hero to her. After he helps her out though, he ominously tells her he isn't going to leave without her. Jack finds his and Carly's compass and goes looking for her. He finds the crash site of the car, yet Carly and Nick are nowhere to be found.",
