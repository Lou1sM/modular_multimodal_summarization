Sofie refused to accept that and kissed Paul, who pushed her away and told her she needed to get dressed and leave. Sofie ranted that she loved Paul and he loved her. Paul was shocked to hear her say so and assured her she was badly mistaken. Sofie then tried to blame Meg for Paul's attitude, saying Paul was holding out false hope that Meg would come back to him. \n\n\nPaul told Sofie that she was an amazing young woman, but he was interested in her only from a business perspective. Sofie began crying, telling him everything she'd done had been to get Paul to notice her, to see her in a different light. Sofie said all the success in the world didn't matter if Paul wasn't there to share it with her. Paul told her he couldn't be that person for her because he was in love with Meg. Sofie said she would leave Paul alone on one condition: that he make love to her one more time. \n\n\nPaul couldn't believe Sofie would even suggest such a thing and asked, \"Don't you have any pride?\" Sofie replied, \"Not where you're concerned.\" Paul told Sofie she needed to get dressed and get out of his house; when she stood there doing nothing, he said, \"Fine, if you won't leave, I will. Don't be here when I get back!\" Paul left, and Sofie went berserk, tearing up the living room and knocking things over. She found a picture of Paul and Meg and hit the glass repeatedly with her hand, shattering the glass and cutting herself in the process. \n\n\nWhen Meg told Mike she still loved Paul, Mike warned her that by her own admission, nothing good had ever come of her involvement with Paul Ryan. Mike then reminded Meg that Sofie was in love with Paul and was still in the picture. Meg said Paul had made it quite clear that he wasn't interested in Sofie; Mike asked if Paul had figured that out before or after he'd slept with Sofie. Meg said Paul felt bad about that and that Sofie knew Paul had been using her to get over Meg. Mike asked if that was what Meg was doing by going out with him: trying to get over Paul. Meg said she hadn't been using Mike, she just hadn't realized how she still felt about Paul. Mike said he didn't want to become involved with someone who was in love with someone else, and he asked if they could be friends. Meg said, \"I hope so,\" and they hugged. \n\n\nMike asked Meg if she had told Paul how she felt, and she said she had been about to do that when Mike arrived. Mike told her to go ahead and not let him stop her. Meg thanked him and left. Paul arrived at the farm after Meg left and found Mike there. Mike told Paul that Meg was probably halfway to Paul's house. Meanwhile, Meg walked into Fairwinds and found the room destroyed and Sofie huddled on the floor, her hands bleeding. Sofie tried to tell Meg that she and Paul were a couple, but Meg said she didn't believe her. Sofie said if Paul loved Meg, he wouldn't have made love to Sofie \"the way he did tonight, over and over and over again.\" Meg told Sofie she was lying, but Sofie said Meg was lying to herself, because Paul loved Sofie and wanted to be with her. Meg walked out of Fairwinds, leaving Sofie shouting after her. \n\n\nMike asked Paul to answer one question for him before going after Meg: had Paul really changed into someone Meg could count on? Paul told Mike he didn't have to answer, and Mike left. Meg arrived and told Paul she had found Sofie and that Sofie had claimed she and Paul had made love that evening. Paul said Sofie was lying and was delusional. Meg wasn't sure if she should believe Paul or not. Paul assured her he was telling her the truth, and he explained what had happened and why he had left Sofie there alone. Meg then told Paul that Sofie had been very dramatic, and she described the scene when she had found Sofie lying on the floor at Fairwinds. She told Paul she had offered to look at Sofie's cuts, but Sofie had said all she needed was Paul. Paul said he had made it perfectly clear that he was not an option for Sofie. \n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds, where he found Sofie on the floor. Sofie was happy to see Paul, telling him she'd known he would come back. Meg walked in, and Sofie asked what she was doing there. Paul said Meg had been concerned about Sofie's wounds, and they thought she should get medical attention. Sofie said she wasn't going anywhere with Meg, and she asked Paul how he could do this to her. Sofie grabbed her things and ran from the room. Paul tried to follow her but returned and told Meg that Sofie had run across the field. \n\n\nMeg told Paul she thought there was more going on with Sofie than they had realized, and Paul said that Sofie seeing him and Meg together probably hadn't helped. Meg said that was particularly true since Sofie had thought Meg and Paul had been \"over\" a long time ago. Paul asked if Meg was saying that they weren't over, but Meg said it wasn't the best time to discuss that. Paul said Mike had told him that Meg wanted to talk to him, and Paul asked if there was something Meg wanted to tell him. Meg said, \"I wanted to say, I love you.\" Paul said that was more than he could ever have hoped for, and he kissed Meg. Paul told Meg no one would ever come between them again. \n\n\nMike found Sofie in the lobby of the Lakeview. Seeing her disheveled appearance and her bloody hands, he stopped and said, \"You're hurt!\" Sofie broke down into tears. Mike told Sofie she had to tell him what had happened and who had hurt her. Sofie looked at Mike and lied, \"I was raped.\" \n\n\nBrad and Katie got ready to go out to dinner, alone, but overheard Liberty lying to her mother because Liberty didn't want to have dinner with Janet. Brad told Liberty not to be so hard on her mother, because Janet was trying to come to terms with sharing her with Brad and Katie instead of being a single mom. Katie asked if Janet had done something to make Liberty mad, and Liberty remembered Janet slapping her at Oldtown after finding out Liberty had been kissing a boy. Liberty said yes, Janet had made her mad, but she didn't tell Brad and Katie what Janet had done. Brad said Janet was obviously reaching out to Liberty, and he thought Liberty should meet her halfway. \n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Janet flirted with a customer named Bud, who asked her to join him for a drink after she got off work. Janet declined, saying she was taking a break from the dating game. Liberty showed up at the diner and overheard the customer flirting with Janet. Liberty walked out of the diner, unseen by her mom. Outside, she saw Parker talking to his former movie date, Ashley. A friend of Ashley's walked up and told Ashley they needed to go look at the new summer dresses that were out, so Ashley said goodbye to Parker and left. \n\n\nLiberty approached Parker and told him that was lame and that he obviously needed her help. Janet walked out and was pleased to see Liberty. Janet asked if Liberty wanted to go have dinner with her. She said hello to Parker and then asked if something was going on between Parker and Liberty; Parker replied that they were cousins, but Janet said Liberty had said they were only technically cousins. Liberty became embarrassed and said she and Parker had a school project to work on, so she couldn't have dinner with her mom. Janet left, and Liberty took Parker's cell phone and sent a text message to Ashley, telling her to meet Parker in front of Al's \"for a big surprise.\" \n\n\nAshley sent a text response saying she was on her way, and Parker became upset with Liberty, asking what he was supposed to do for the \"big surprise.\" Liberty told Parker he should kiss Ashley, but he said he couldn't do that. Liberty asked, \"Are you physically incapable, or are you just chicken?\" Parker told Liberty to leave, but she said she wanted to stick around to watch the kiss. Before Parker could object further, Ashley walked up and asked what the surprise was. Seeing Parker's stricken face, she said, \"Maybe this was a bad idea,\" and she turned to walk away. Parker grabbed her hand and spun her back towards him, intending to kiss her, but instead, he smacked right into her nose, hurting her. Upset, Ashley rushed off. Liberty came out from her hiding spot and laughed at Parker, saying she'd never seen anything like that before. \n\n\nLiberty told Parker maybe he needed a \"visual aid,\" and she offered to show Parker how it was done. Liberty told Parker to put his hands on her waist, and when he refused, she did it for him. Then she told him she didn't have all night, so Parker kissed her. Liberty told him it wasn't bad, but Parker said maybe they should try it again. Liberty said she thought Parker did fine, and she told him, \"Nice work, tough guy,\" and walked away. \n\n\nBrad and Katie were having dinner at the Lakeview when Janet walked in and sat at the bar next to her customer from the diner. Brad went to the bar and took Janet aside, accusing her of dumping Liberty so she could hook up with a stranger. Janet explained that Liberty had blown her off when she invited her to dinner and that Bud was not a stranger. Brad asked what Bud's last name was, and when Janet didn't know, he said that made Bud a stranger. Brad said Janet was setting a bad example for Liberty, and Janet became angry. Katie walked up and apologized for Brad's behavior and pulled him away. \n\n\nKatie and Brad returned home, where Katie asked Brad if the only reason he was upset to see Janet with another man was because of Liberty. Brad said no, that wasn't the only reason. He told Katie he was worried about Janet, because she was tough on the outside but na\u00efve on the inside and had always made bad decisions about guys. Katie said Brad was the one who was being na\u00efve, always giving Janet the benefit of the doubt. Brad decided Katie was right and that Janet could take care of herself. \n\n\nBud walked Janet up to her suite at the Lakeview, where she thanked him for the drink. He then tried to kiss her, but Janet turned her head so that he only kissed her cheek. Janet dropped her room key, and Bud picked it up and opened the door, then walked into the suite, asking Janet if he could have \"one for the road.\" Janet told Bud that she was tired, but Bud said surely Janet hadn't let him walk her up to her room just to say goodnight. Janet said actually, she had, and she thought he should go. Bud said he would leave after one kiss. He tried to kiss Janet, and she shoved him away, accidentally cutting his cheek in the process. Janet apologized, but Bud became angry and shoved her to the floor, saying, \"No wonder you're alone.\"\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
