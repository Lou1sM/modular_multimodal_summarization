During an official welcome to the family party for JJ, an emotional Emma finds out Holden has signed his divorce papers. JJ asks to invite Keith, which Jack uncomfortably does. Carly later tells Holden that she thinks deep down Lily is starting to doubt Keith because of the way she staunchly defends him even to her. Keith, who has let himself into Lily's house, overhears her conversation with Jessica to go meet her regarding Julia's murder. He catches Lily in a lie, and she admits to wanting to go find some irrefutable evidence once and for all to clear Keith in order to placate Lucinda, who found the check Lily wrote to Keith to help him with his debt. Keith is agitated that Lily feels she needs to do this, but Lily diverts the real reason she is checking up on him. He wants to help, but Lily wants to do it alone claiming any evidence they find will be tainted in Lucinda's eyes if he helps. Keith tells Lily he will catch up with her after JJ's party. Lily goes on a fishing expedition first at her meeting with Jessica and then back to Keith's. Lily takes his passport from his drawer in order to show it to the mechanic at the garage where Les' car was. The mechanic positively ID's Keith as the one at his garage at the time the police were looking for Les' car. After a stunned Lily leaves, we see a pair of boots from someone obviously following Lily."
