Lily told him also that Meg had collapsed at the Lakeview and was resting on Damian's couch in his hotel room. Holden was upset that his sister was involved with Damian in any way, but Lily explained how supportive Damian had been to Meg. Holden suggested that Damian was just trying to insinuate himself further into the Snyder family, but Lily reminded him that because of Luke, Damian was already part of their family. Holden wanted to go immediately and bring Meg home. \n\n\nMeg's phone rang as she was resting at Damian's, so he answered it. Paul was the caller, but he did not speak when Damian answered. Meg was frantic and asked Damian to call back, but Damian found that the number was blocked. Meg panicked and suggested that it might have been Bonnie checking in. She was hopeful that Bonnie already had her baby back. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Dusty and Bonnie showed Paul's photo to the car mechanic who had worked on Paul's car. He identified Paul and said that the man had been traveling with a baby. Dusty thought that Paul was still in the immediate area, and he was determined to smoke him out. Bonnie, however, said that she was sure that Paul was long gone. Dusty walked off, but Bonnie followed him to his car. She then ran to pay the mechanic, and Dusty promised to wait. \n\n\nBonnie returned to Dusty's car, just as her cell phone rang. She spoke to Damian for a minute, but then Meg grabbed the phone and asked why Bonnie did not yet have Eliza. Bonnie said that the person she was to meet had never appeared, but she added that she and Dusty had another possible lead on Paul. Meg was surprised that Dusty had followed Bonnie, and she was praying that the lead would pan out. Bonnie promised to call as soon as she knew more. Meg hung up and explained it all to Damian. \n\n\nDamian was concerned about Meg's flu symptoms, and she took off her shirt and huddled under a blanket on the couch. Damian answered a knock on the door, and his visitors were Holden and Lily. Meg sat up, surprised, wearing only her bra on top. Holden took one look and asked \"what the hell\" was going on. Damian tried to explain, and Meg backed him up that she was just trying to get comfortable. Lily helped Meg get dressed, as Meg explained to Holden that she had received a response to her video from a woman in Wisconsin, but they had not notified the Oakdale police. \n\n\nHolden flipped out that his sister had not shared the lead with the police, but Meg got teary and chewed him out for pointing out how she had failed her child once again. She began to get hysterical, so Lily and Holden decided to take her home right away. \n\n\nAt the co-op farm, Rosanna was hopeful when Paul told her that he had called Meg, but then he said that Damian had answered her phone. Paul was sure that Meg was using Damian to lure him out of hiding. Rosanna did not believe that Meg was turning all of Oakdale against her ex-husband, but Paul was not about to fall for any more of Meg's tricks. Rosanna mused that she should have taken Eliza back to Oakdale herself. \n\n\nPaul called Rosanna a fraud and said that she had not let go of any of her anger against him. Rosanna denied that and yelled that he could only see life through his own narrow perspective. Paul hurled accusations of his own that Rosanna had always been jealous of Meg because he and Meg had a child, and Rosanna never would. That hurt Rosanna deeply, and she screamed at Paul to shut up. She called him sick, cruel, and crazy. Paul picked up Eliza's baby carrier and said goodbye. \n\n\nBonnie and Dusty hung out in town, and Dusty thought about what Paul would need for the baby. Bonnie thought they were wasting their time, and they argued back and forth until Dusty told Bonnie to just go away. Edna from the co-op farm came out of one of the stores and heard their argument, and Bonnie left to go to the garage, praying that her car was repaired. \n\n\nEdna rushed back to the farm and caught Paul just as he was leaving Rosanna. She said that a man and a woman were in town asking questions about Paul, and that the man was called \"Dusty.\" Paul started to take off, but Rosanna stopped him. She asked if he wanted their help, and Paul said yes. Rosanna had an idea, but it also required some help from Edna. \n\n\nBack in town, Dusty found Bonnie at the garage and admitted that she was probably right about Paul's absence from the area. As Bonnie was signing the credit card slip for her car repairs, Edna walked up and began a conversation with them. She wanted to know if they had been asking about a man with a little girl. She identified Paul's photo and said that he had asked her for directions to Sparta, Minnesota. She said that had happened between nine and ten in the morning. The mechanic gave Bonnie a map of the route to Sparta, and then Edna got him busy on her car. \n\n\nDusty considered what he had heard and then told Bonnie that Edna had lied to them. He didn't believe her story because she had exhibited a lot of what he called \"tells,\" signs that someone was lying. He argued that he remembered seeing Edna in town earlier, but she had made no effort to tell them her story then. Dusty also thought her approach at the garage was a little too convenient, so Bonnie called the local police and asked them to watch out for Paul's car. Bonnie also paid the garage to store her car for a while, so she told Dusty that he was stuck with her. Dusty suggested that they get out of there. \n\n\nPaul asked Rosanna why she hadn't turned him in, and she answered that she had done it for little Eliza, who was stuck in the middle between Paul and Meg. Edna returned from town and reported her success in distracting Bonnie and Dusty. \n\n\nMeg and Holden talked at home, as Meg's phone rang. It was Bonnie, who told her that Paul and her baby were most likely headed for Sparta, Minnesota. Bonnie hung up, so Meg reported the news to Holden, who decided to call Jack and inform the Oakdale police. Meanwhile, Meg called Damian about the new lead, and he told her that he was experiencing the same symptoms that she had. Lily immediately left to take care of him. She found him with a fever and chills, and she announced that he was going home with her. \n\n\nLily took Damian to her house, much to Meg's surprise. Holden arrived soon, and he and Lily went outside to discuss the new turn of events. Lily said that Damian would be staying with them for a few days, or until he felt better. Holden was not happy about that, and his mood did not improve when he went inside and saw Meg and Damian sitting very close together on the couch, with Meg's head on Damian's shoulder. \n\n\nRosanna complimented Paul on how well he cared for Eliza, and he apologized for verbally attacking her earlier. Rosanna learned then of James Stenbeck's death and how it had affected Paul. He was still worried that his father would haunt him for the rest of his days. Rosanna suggested that Paul use his remaining time on the farm to put all thoughts of James behind him.\n\n\n",
