Ben and Jessica make it clear to Bonnie that they were anticipating some private time together, and Ben leaves for a few minutes so Bonnie and Jessica can visit.  Jessica tells Bonnie her good news, and Bonnie responds with her own good news that she is beginning to connect with Sarah at the center where she is doing her community service.  Bonnie goes on about how her life is turning around after Jessica's attempted rape.  Instantly, at the mention of the attack, Jessica's demeanor changes and she becomes agitated.  When Ben returns, Bonnie leaves so that he and Jessica can share some private time, but now Jessica is unable to respond to Ben.  When Ben confronts Jessica about the fact that she has been pushing him away ever since Marshall attacked her, Jessica insists that she wants to share her life with Ben.  She pleads with him to help her work through her problem, and Ben promises to stay with her and to love her forever.\n\n\nMolly finds Dusty at Rose's, and tells Rose that she gave Dusty the money to pay off Alex Spangler, and she warns Rose not to give Dusty any more money.  When Rose angrily comes at Dusty, he tells both women that he is leaving town to get away from Spangler.  Dusty takes Molly outside to try to convince her that he is trying to change, and that he is leaving town to protect Rose.  Molly stalks off, declaring that she will find out whether he is telling the truth or not.  Meanwhile, inside, Rose picks up Dusty's cell phone, which automatically dials Spangler.  When Spangler answers, Rose asks him to wait for her in the Lakeview lounge.  As Mitzi walks in, Rose rushes out.  Dusty returns from the porch, and deduces that Rose has used his cell phone.  Mitzi tells him that Rose has gone to the Lakeview lounge to meet a man, and Dusty follows as quickly as he can.  Rose walks up to Spangler and asks him if he and Dusty are working together to use Rose to squeeze money out of Lucinda Walsh.  Dusty immediately arrives and confronts Spangler with the information that he will not have any part in the scam.  Spangler gets in Dusty's face and threatens to teach him a lesson.  When Dusty responds, asking Spangler if he intends to use his pistol with the jade handle, Spangler calls him a fool and whispers, \"We're not finished.\"  Rose furiously spits at Dusty that she wants him out of his life, but Dusty warns her that she will not be safe unless she stays with him.  Nevertheless, Rose rushes out.\n\n\nAt the morgue, Jack, Mike, Katie, and Margo watch the coroner unwrap the body Katie and Mike had found at the mill.  Katie rushes out, unable to watch, but when the face is uncovered, both Margo and Jack recognize it to be Bartleby Spears, Simon's nemesis.  Margo and Jack go back to the police station where they interview Henry Coleman.  Henry admits that Simon killed Bartleby after he found him outside their house pointing a gun at Katie.  Henry insists that Simon killed Bartleby in self-defense, and he admits that he helped Simon get out of town.  Simon had told Henry that Bartleby had threatened to have his associates kill Katie if Simon crossed him.  Henry begs Margo not to tell Katie the truth about what happened, for fear that it might put Katie in danger.  Jack also urges Margo not to tell Katie the truth.  Katie arrives at the station to ask who the body was.  Margo is torn, wanting to tell Katie that Simon really loved her, but not wanting to endanger her sister's life.  In Jack's office, Molly arrives to ask if Jack has any news about Carly.\n\n\nAs the rest of the story unfolds, there is a shot of a dark cabin porch, with wind chimes mysteriously tinkling.  Next we hear heartbreaking sobs from the cabin.  Finally, we see a hand placing a candle on a table just inside the cabin, then we see Carly watching the candle flicker out.\n\n\n",
