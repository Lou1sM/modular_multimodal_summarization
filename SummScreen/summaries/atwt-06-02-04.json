Jill went to the ladies' locker room and found it locked. Margo unlocked the door, and Jill entered. Jill noticed a man's shoes peeking out beneath the curtain. Doc stepped out and tried to explain his reason for being there. \n\n\nDoc said that since he was a celebrity and had some legal problems, he didn't need it spread out in public, so he had asked Margo to help him. Doc told Jill that he hoped she would remain discreet about discovering what had just been told to her. Doc told her that he would appreciate it very much, and in the future, maybe he could do something for her. Doc left the locker room and saw Margo talking with her husband. Margo asked Tom to take her home and make love to her. \n\n\nJordan and Rosanna spoke on the phone. Jordan said that he wanted to visit his son. She tried to put him off, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. He wanted to see Cabot, and he wanted to see him without her there. Rosanna told Carly that she didn't have a good feeling about all of it. \n\n\nJennifer and Jordan sat and talked when Jordan revealed that he was still ticked off about what Paul and Rosanna had done, but Cabot was the important one. He was about to really meet his son for the first time, and he wanted her there. She agreed to go along. Jordan arrived at Rosanna's with Jennifer. Rosanna was surprised but invited them both in. \n\n\nCarly tried to get Rosanna out, but she said that she was not sure she wanted Jennifer around Cabot. Jordan said that if he cared what she thought, it might make a difference, but it didn't. Carly tried to make light of the situation, saying that Rosanna was just trying to make sure that he would be able to care for Cabot. Jennifer said that she would help if necessary. \n\n\nCarly got Rosanna to leave and said they would be back in a couple of hours. Rosanna made Carly realize that Jordan had more right to Cabot than she did. Carly reminded Rosanna that it was just a visit.\n\n\nChris and Susan tried to explain to Alison what had happened with the two of them. Susan finally admitted that when Chris had entered the house, she had dropped her towel, and he had seen her naked. Alison was surprised. She couldn't imagine anything like that happening in Chris's house. Susan retaliated with a sarcastic remark. \n\n\nAlison began to doubt whether or not they should live together. Chris reassured her that he loved her and that everything would be okay. Alison left, and Susan asked Chris if everything was all right. He said he had been a little concerned about Alison, but it seemed to have passed. Susan politely asked Chris if he was going to say anything to his mother about the situation, and he said no.\n\n\nHal asked Dusty how to find Starziak. Lily said Lucy or he could have been killed. She asked if they were after Dusty, because they hadn't stolen anything. Lily said to Dusty that he already knew that she and her family had been targeted. She told Hal if he needed any information about Starziak to turn to her. Starziak had been laundering money through the Rose Foundation. \n\n\nLily walked over to Lucy to find out how she was. She asked what was going on with Lucy's parents. Lucy replied that her mother was upset because Lucy had been attacked in her father's club, and her father was upset because she was leaving town early. Lily told Lucy that it was not Craig's fault. \"Try telling that to my Mom\", Lucy said, adding, \"She's definitely not believing anything he's saying.\" \n\n\nSierra walked over, and Lily tried to tell her that she was more to blame. She had known things were going on and had done nothing. She also reminded Sierra that Craig loved his daughter. Craig begged Lucy to stay one more day. He knew that when she left, she would be gone forever. \n\n\nSierra and Craig started to argue and were told to have the argument another time. It was suggested that they all go out for coffee -- Dad, Sierra, Lucy -- and Aunt Lily to referee. Craig told Sierra that it was Lucy's way of giving her loving Daddy a little more time. She had gotten that from her mom, who was full of kindness and a loving heart,\n\n\nMolly was afraid that Starziak would hurt anyone that got in his way. It could be Lily, her family, even Molly or Dusty. She couldn't make Dusty realize that. After everyone left, Dusty pulled out a gun. He put it in a satchel and started to leave to get Starziak. Molly wondered why he wouldn't let Hal help him. Dusty just figured he was the only one that could do anything.  \n\n\n",
