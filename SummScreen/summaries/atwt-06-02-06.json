Damian tells Luke that he doesn't want to try to change him and that he wants to be friends with him if he can't be a father to him. He asks Luke how he felt when Holden and Lily separated, and Luke says they didn't give him any warning that was coming, they just told him to deal with it. Damian points out that this is pretty much the same way Luke told Lily that he was gay: here it is, now deal with it. Luke sees Damian's point. Damian asks Luke's permission to tell her what they've discussed, and Luke says okay but wants to know \"then what?\" Damian says he thinks it would be good if the 3 of them sat down together and had a real conversation about things. Luke agrees, so Damian goes to tell Lily. He tells her that he agrees with her that Luke is confused and says that they need to let Luke know that they are there for him. He and Lily go to the living room and sit down to talk to Luke, who comments on how \"weird\" this is; they agree just as Holden walks in, demanding to know if someone is going to tell him what's going on.\n\n\nLucy Montgomery runs into Jennifer at the Lakeview and tells her she's already seen both Dusty and Johnny at the hospital. She tells Jennifer that she'll be working at Memorial and living at the Lakeview, and she apologizes to Jennifer for all the horrible things her father, Craig, did to Jennifer. Jennifer says she doesn't hold Lucy responsible for any of that, but when Lucy says she'd like to be a part of Johnny's life, since he's her half-brother, Jennifer is obviously taken aback. Lucinda walks in and hugs Lucy, admitting to her that she knew she was coming to town because Sierra had told her. Jennifer leaves, and Lucy tells Lucinda that she has already run into Dusty and knows that he is engaged to Jennifer. Lucinda asks if she's okay with that, and Lucy says she is, that she was the one who left Dusty in the first place. Lucinda still thinks that Dusty is the main reason why Lucy came back to Oakdale instead of going somewhere else to do her internship and that Lucy's not completely over Dusty. Lucy denies it and changes the subject to Lucinda's health. After giving Lucy an update on her health, Lucinda tells her that she's actually lonely and would love it if Lucy would come and stay with her instead of staying at the hotel. Lucy agrees and goes to the desk clerk to have her bags brought back down, but when he asks if she wants to cancel her whole reservation, she says no, that she thinks she'll keep the room as a place to escape to.\n\n\nJennifer finds Dusty and Johnny at the hospital and tells Dusty that she ran into Lucy and that she's going to be living at the Lakeview. Dusty asks her if that's a problem, and although Jennifer says it isn't, it's clear to Dusty that it is. He tells her that he's not jealous of Mike Kasnoff, even though Mike was married to Jennifer, and she says that's because Mike was always really crazy for Katie, whereas she doesn't think Lucy is over Dusty completely. He asks if she's jealous, and she says it's not jealousy, it's a lack of trust in the future working out for her. She tells him that Lucy wants to be a part of Johnny's life and that worries her because of Craig, but Dusty says Lucy will be too busy to see Johnny very much and that she would never resort to spying or evil-doing on behalf of her dad. He tells Jennifer that Lucy being back is a good thing, because it brings out the \"redhead\" in Jennifer.\n\n\nJack comforts Carly in the cave, and they kiss. The medics arrive and put Carly on a stretcher, and she is taken to Memorial Hospital. Jack tells her to keep fighting. Carly asks Jack how he found her, and he holds up her wedding ring and says she left good clues. Then he tells her there are easier ways to get his attention; she says she knows that and has tried them all. She says having him here feels right, and he replies, \"I know.\" Jack leaves the room so the doctor can change the dressing on Carly's leg. \n\n\nNear Myer's Lake, Nick attacks Mike in the fishing cabin with an oar; Katie walks in to find Mike crumpled in a heap on the floor and Nick with the oar in his hand. She sees his gun lying on the floor and grabs it, firing straight into Nick's chest as he comes towards her. Nick falls, and Mike gets up and runs to him. He tells Katie to call 9-1-1, and he tells Nick to hang on. Nick tells Mike he's sorry for hitting him. Katie is horrified that she has shot Nick and tries to apologize to Mike, saying she thought Nick was going to kill him. Margo arrives with the ambulance right behind her. Mike leaves to follow the ambulance to the hospital, but when Katie tells him she's coming with him, he yells at her, \"No, I don't want you!\" Margo asks Katie what happened, and Katie tells her the story.\n\n\nAs Jack comes out of Carly's hospital room, he sees Mike, along with Nick on the gurney. He asks Mike who shot Nick, but Mike doesn't answer; instead, Katie arrives and tells Jack that she's the one who shot Nick and now her life has changed forever. Jack tells her not to worry about what Mike might have said to her, because he's in shock right now, and that soon Mike will come out to tell them how Nick is doing. Mike does come out, but he tells them that Nick is dead.\n\n\n",
