    "soap_central": "\n\nHolden surprised Lily at home and said he wanted to see how she was managing with Gabriel.  He offered to keep the boy busy at the stables, but Lily, although she appreciated the offer, said that Gabriel was still sleeping and recovering.  Holden handed Lily a large envelope he had found by her front door, and she opened it to find her final divorce papers from Damian.  It made Lily sad to remember all the mistakes she had made with him and how much it had cost her.  Lily suggested that she throw a family dinner that night to make Gabriel feel welcome.  She invited Holden, Molly, and Faith, so Holden accepted and left for the farm.\n\n\nLucinda showed up at Lily's, and Lily admitted she had forgotten that she had made plans with her mother.  She showed Lucinda the legal papers, and her mother rejoiced by saying, \"We are finally free of the Maltese connection!\" Lucinda put in a plug for Holden, but Lily reminded her that Holden no longer wanted her.  Lily got sad and admitted, however, that she still wanted her first love back.  Lucinda was delighted to hear that, and she tried to convince Lily that there was hope for her and Holden again, but Lily was confused and said what she felt for Holden was \"safe.\"\n\n\n\"Safe\" was disappointing for Lucinda to hear, but finally Lily admitted that she still cared for Holden, as she fought back tears.  Lucinda could not believe that Lily had invited Molly to her dinner, but Lily said that Holden lived with the woman, and she needed to make Molly feel welcome.  Lily made an official pronouncement that the \"romantic sage of Holden and Lily\" was over.\n\n\nMolly got in her car and checked her phone.  She found about 20 text messages from Silas Whitman, and she yelled out loud to the trees that she hated him, but Silas suddenly jerked open her car door.  He frightened Molly and reminded her that she couldn't walk away from him.  He said she would always regret it if she brushed him off, and he made crude remarks about Molly's \"farmer.\"  Silas insisted that Molly have dinner with him that night, but she refused by saying that she loved Holden.  Whitman warned Molly that she had no idea how difficult he could make her life if he so desired.  He threatened to expose \"mementos\" of their affair if Molly didn't accept his invitation.\n\n\nMolly drove away and went home to the farm where she found Holden about to call her.  He said they had a dinner invitation from Lily for the whole family to show support for Gabriel Caras and also to celebrate Lily's divorce from Damian.  Molly's phone rang, but when she saw it was from Silas, she declined to answer.  She told Holden the call was from \"work,\" so he urged her to take it.  Silas told Molly she needed to meet him for dinner or he would release some photos and videos of the two of them to the press.  Molly refused to take the bait, so Whitman said he would then send them instead to her \"farmer.\"  Molly said she had a family dinner to attend, so the ex-Congressman offered to provide the videos for the entertainment.\n\n\nWhitman then promised that if Molly would have dinner with him and talk things through, he would walk away at the end of the evening if Molly had not changed her mind.  He told her to go to the Old Mill Restaurant and gave her the directions.  Then he warned her that she had better not disappoint him.  Holden whispered to Molly that her career was more important than a family dinner, and he urged her to take the assignment.  Molly reluctantly agreed, and then swore to Holden that after that evening, she would devote herself exclusively to him.  The two of them kissed.\n\n\nMolly dressed for her dinner with Silas and drove out Route 23 to the restaurant.  She walked into an empty room, but Whitman soon joined her.  Then he closed and locked the door with a key.\n\n\nHolden showed up alone at Lily's with a beautiful bouquet of flowers from the farm garden.  He said that he had been unable to reach Faith, but she might show up later.  Molly, he said, had a last-minute work assignment.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Alison sat with Chris, who was still jabbering in Katie's bed.  She urged him to go to sleep, but he just rambled on about how magnificent Katie was and how he felt about her.  Chris was too drugged to realize that he was talking to Alison.  Disgusted, Alison stood up and told Chris to \"sleep it off.\"\n\n\nAlison was unaware that Katie had returned home and was in her living room with a very upset Vienna.  Vienna confirmed to Katie that she was not pregnant and admitted that she had made up the whole baby story.  Katie was horrified that Vienna could have done that and also slept with Casey.  Vienna said that she was forced to go to extremes when she spotted Henry kissing Barbara Ryan.  To make things even worse, Vienna said that Henry had admitted that he had deep feelings for Barbara.  Vienna desperately needed advice from Katie, and she also complained that Casey was nosing around, suspicious that Vienna was carrying his child.\n\n\nKatie said that Vienna had to stop lying to her best friend Henry and making him fall in love with a \"fantasy baby.\"  Vienna was sure she could give Henry the life he wanted, and she begged Katie to help her.  When Katie stayed silent, Vienna asked her friend to at least keep her secret until she was pregnant \"for real.\" Alison walked out of the bedroom, so Vienna quietly left.  Alison told Katie that their patient would survive, but he was talking too much instead of sleeping.  She asked Katie to stop setting her up with Chris because he only liked her as a friend.  Katie asked what Chris had done, but Alison replied, \"Nothing, except fall for you.\"\n\n\nKatie couldn't believe what Alison told her that Chris had said.  Alison was convinced that Chris had strong feelings for Katie, and he thought those feelings were reciprocated.  Katie insisted that there was nothing going on, but Alison said there was, and she was glad to find out before she got any more involved with Chris.  Alison left for work, so Katie went in and sat by a sleeping Chris.\n\n\nHenry and Casey drank liberally at the bar at Yo's.  Casey mentioned Henry's impending fatherhood, but instead of being excited, Henry said he was \"quaking in his boots.\"  He mentioned their miscarriage the year before, and Casey remembered it.  Henry wondered why someone as young as Casey was even interested in the topic of babies, but Casey reminded him that he had gotten Gwen pregnant while they were both in high school.  Casey had denied his paternity of that baby for a long time, but he asked what was holding Henry back because he obviously loved Vienna, had money, and a good business.  Life was good for Henry, so Casey asked what his problem was.  Henry said he knew nothing about raising kids and seriously questioned whether he would be a good dad.\n\n\nThe men played pool and talked about wives and close calls.  Henry apologized for mentioning Casey's almost wedding to Alison and said, \"You don't get over your fianc\u00e9e sleeping with another man when she's your fianc\u00e9e.\"  Casey laughed at the irony but he did not answer when Henry also questioned what kind of guy would do that.  Henry asked about Alison, and Casey said she was actually helping him out with something he had going on.  Vienna marched in then and accused both of the men of being drunk.  Henry said they had been talking about life, love, fatherhood, and -- Vienna!  Vienna glared at Casey, who spoke up that he hadn't told Henry anything he hadn't already known.  Vienna dragged Henry out, and Casey took off for the hospital.\n\n\nBack in the Lakeview, Vienna suggested that they call off their stuffy, formal wedding.  If they got rid of the frills and ruffles, she said, they could get married right away.  Henry looked like a deer in the headlights when she said they should hold the nuptials at Al's, and she pulled him down on the bed with her.  She wanted to play their \"Drunken Sailor and Saucy Barmaid\" game, but Henry did not want to do anything that might hurt the baby.  Vienna assured him that the doctor had said sex was fine, but Henry wanted to talk to the doctor himself.  Vienna got a bit frantic and screamed that they didn't need to see a doctor. She wanted to make love, but someone knocked on the door and interrupted them.\n\n\nCasey hunted for Alison at Memorial and asked when her shift was over.  She was very busy, so Casey gave her a quick rundown.  He said that Henry thought the baby was his own, so Casey had decided to accept the situation and back off.  Alison said no matter how much sense that made, she couldn't see Casey walking away from a child who might be his.  Alison ran off, but Casey sat in the waiting area until she returned.  He said he wanted her to understand why he needed to back off the \"baby thing.\"  He said the situation made him realize that he wanted to have children but not until he was with someone he loved.  Alison got paged and had to go, but she told Casey he could continue to wait if he wanted.\n\n\nWhen Alison returned, Casey was gone, but he showed up again shortly.  He said he needed to figure out what to do even though he knew Vienna should figure out her own life.  His behavior with Gwen had figured into his thoughts, and he hated to recall how immature he had acted then.  Casey said he needed to know the truth about Vienna's baby.  Alison smiled and told Casey he was \"a good guy.\"\n\n\nKatie sat with Chris in her bedroom, and he finally awakened.  She was in a rush to get him out of there, and when she discovered that he was no longer in pain, she practically pushed him out the door.  Chris asked if he had said something wrong while he was \"under the influence,\" but Katie said she had no idea.  Chris wondered how he had managed to irritate her so much in his sleep, but he obviously had no clue what he had been talking about.  Katie found it hard to believe that he did not remember saying everything that Alison had reported, but Chris did not even remember that Alison had been there.  Katie was so gruff that Chris stood his ground and demanded to know what he had done.  Katie was flustered, so she gave him the phone number for the cab company and dashed out.\n\n\nChris straightened up Katie's bed and looked at the photos of her and Brad.  He knew he had done something to irritate her, but he said aloud that he had absolutely no idea what it was.\n\n\nThe knock on Henry and Vienna's door was Katie, who said she had to do something.  Vienna looked alarmed and told Katie it was \"not a good time,\" but Katie handed her a silver box.  Vienna opened it, and inside was the wedding garter that Katie had worn when she had married Brad.  Katie said she hoped it would bring Henry and Vienna happy times, and she urged them to be loving and honest with each other.\n\n\n",
