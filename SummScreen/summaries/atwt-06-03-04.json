She was wondering what the connection between Jordan and James was when Carly entered and frightened her. Carly was surprised that Barbara was working. Barbara said she was restless and wanted to get a jump on all the orders that were being placed. Barbara presented Carly with a nice check and praised her for her hard work. Carly, in turn, thanked Barbara for a second chance. Later, Carly called Jack and told him to get ready for a romantic and special evening to celebrate.\n\n\nOver at the Lakeview, Rosanna was sitting alone when Paul approached her and wanted to know if she was okay. Rosanna asked him for some privacy but gave in when he refused to leave. They started talking about Cabot and how much Rosanna loved him. Paul was sympathetic and told her that Jordan would probably get tired of parenting then Rosanna would have full custody of him. Paul was making Rosanna laugh when Barbara called and told him that she had some information that included Rosanna.\n\n\nJordan held and talked to Cabot, enjoying his time as a father. Jennifer showed up and offered to help. While Jordan went to get a diaper and Cabot's pajamas, Jennifer held him. Rosanna arrived, grabbed Cabot from Jennifer's arms, and accused Jennifer of not caring for Cabot properly. \n\n\nJordan returned to the room and told Rosanna that Cabot was his son, also, and for Rosanna to get used to it. Rosanna apologized, saying she knew that Jordan wasn't experienced as a parent. She admitted she had panicked when she hadn't seen Jordan in the room. Jordan said he would not do anything to harm Cabot and wanted Rosanna to just trust him. \n\n\nPaul arrived at BRO, and Barbara presented him with the box James had sent to her. Barbara had a theory that James was somehow related to Jordan. Paul made his mother go over his birth, asking Barbara if she had been awake when Paul had been born. Paul believed that James had somehow switched him at birth and that Jordan was really Barbara's son. Paul said that Jordan could be dating his sister. Meanwhile, Jordan and Jennifer started to make love.\n\n\nThe two thugs were showering at the club when the attendant entered and announced a phone call. When one went to answer the phone, Dusty knocked him out. Dusty went into the steam room and pointed a gun at Starziak. Dusty said he would kill Starziak if he didn't leave Dusty alone. Starziak said he had never sent anyone to Metro, and if Dusty threatened him again, Dusty would be dead. Starziak left Dusty to wonder who had assaulted him and Lucy.\n\n\nAt Metro, Craig and Lucy were talking about the assault. Lucy said she didn't want to talk about it or Dusty. Lucy wanted her father to get out of his partnership with Dusty, saying that Dusty was bad news. Craig said he didn't have much, and he wasn't afraid of Dusty's thugs. Craig started to say how he was going to miss her and asked why she wouldn't stay. \n\n\nLucy became emotional when Craig told her that no matter what, Craig was most proud of her. He kept pleading with her to stay, but Lucy said she wanted to spend time with her mother and that she would be back to visit him after school started. Dusty arrived and asked Lucy if she would try to remember all she could about the thugs. After rehashing what had happened, Dusty remembered that one of the thugs had a large tattoo on his forearm. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "With Jennifers help, Jordan bonds with Cabot. Rosanna confides in Paul shes worried about what Jordan will want with Cabot, but convinces herself not to worry. However, she is less than pleased when she finds Cabot in Jennifers arms. A determined Jordan announces that hes not going to walk away from his son. Meanwhile, Barbara and Paul come to the shocking conclusion that Jordan could be James Stenbecks son - and possibly Barbara's as well. As they consider this possibility, Jennifer and Jordan make love for the first time. Dusty confronts Starziak with a gun in the steam room. He tries to convince Dusty that he didnt send the two thugs who tried to snatch Lucy. At Metro, Lucy says good-bye to Craig. Dusty recalls the thugs who snatched Lucy and he wonders whether or not what Starziak said is true. Could the guys who attacked Lucy have no connection to Dusty after all? Dusty presses Lucy for info about the guys, but Craig steps in to stop his questioning. Carly gets a big fat check from Barbara for her work at BRO. She sets up a fun surprise for Jack, giving him a new red Corvette.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara looks through the box of baby items James sent, questioning everything James had told her when she visited him. Carly comes in and asks about the box, Barbara excusing it and giving her a large bonus check. Carly sees the picture that was in the box and asks about it, Barbara telling her it was an idea for screenprinting vintage photos onto shirts for the teen line. Carly believes her and leaves, Barbara phoning Paul. Roseanna is at the coffee shop/deli when Paul finds her, Roseanna telling him she's not good company and needs to be alone. He tells her she looks like she needs a friend and she welcomes him to sit with her. They discuss Jordan and she cries on Paul's shoulder, Paul reassuring her that she needs to become friends with Jordan and everything will be fine. He asks if he could be her friend again, Roseanna taking his hand and stating she counted on it. His mother calls and they both leave. Jordan and Jennifer are with Cabot, Jordan having changed his diaper. Jennifer offers to get him some dry clothes, Jordan leaving Cabot with her and getting them himself. Roseanna comes in and freaks out, accusing Jordan of just leaving Cabot with Jennifer. They argue, Roseanna finally apologizing. Jordan tells her he'll call before he comes over tomorrow, Roseanna distressed at his statement. Later, she dreams that it's Cabot's first birthday Jordan and Jennifer are married and Jennifer saying she's Cabot's mommy. Roseanna cries out that she's Cabot's mommy, James escorting her out the door as she pounds on it weeping. Paul and Barbara figure out that Jordan is James' son, but worry that either he's Paul's twin or that Paul isn't Barbara's son. Jordan tells Jennifer that James Stenbeck is behind his marriage to Roseanna, Jennifer becoming worried and urging him to call the cops. He assures her that whatever James is up to, he's not concerned \u0096 James has given him the family that he's always wanted. Jennifer is slightly miffed, telling him that she hopes he gets what he wants and he tells her that only she can give him what he really wants. They go back to Jennifer's room in Barbara's suite and make love. Dusty warns Starzyak at gunpoint to quit sending his goons over to Metro, Starzyak saying he never did. Dusty again tells him that it's all over, Starzyak threatening him that he can't tell him it's over. Once back at Metro, he presses Lucy (who's saying goodbye to Craig) for any information she can remember, Craig telling him to leave his daughter out of it. Craig asks Lucy to let him see her off at the airport tomorrow, Lucy agreeing. Meanwhile, Dusty goes over what happened, his mind focusing on the dragon tattoo on one of the attackers arms and that one of them said, \"Donovan screwed everything up.\" On the other side of the club, Carly tells Jack that she loves him so much and gifts him with a brand new corvette. They leave the club, happy.",
