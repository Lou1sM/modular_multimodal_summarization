Margo tries to defend her role in getting Craig out of town, but Craig is upset that she was involved to that extent. Margo confesses that Sierra was also involved in the ruse to get rid of Craig. When Margo says Craig is the worst father she's ever known and that there's no one left in Oakdale who is on Craig's side, he tells her that's not true, that Rosanna is on his side, and he says he ran into her in Bangkok. He leaves, telling Margo that she \"ain't seen nothing yet.\" Katie comes to see Margo, and she tells her that Craig is back and that he is really determined now to work his way into the life of the baby that Jennifer and Mike are having.\n\n\nPaul goes to see Rosanna, who tries to apologize for how badly she treated him. When Paul says that nothing she says can convince him to stay and listen to her anymore, she tells him, \"Cabot's alive.\" After this news sinks in and Rosanna explains how James faked Cabot's death and then took him away, ultimately returning with him to blackmail Rosanna into leaving Paul to get Cabot back, Paul is hurt to realize that she didn't tell him any of this at the time because she was afraid she'd lose Cabot again, like she did when she trusted Paul the first time. Paul asks to see Cabot, but Rosanna tells him he's not there. Paul assumes that James still has Cabot, and he tells Rosanna that he'll help her get him back, but Rosanna explains that she gave him up for adoption to keep him safe from James. When Paul says, \"You don't trust me, do you?\" Craig arrives and says, \"Give the fella a cigar.\" Paul is shocked both to see Craig again and to find out that Rosanna was instrumental in his return to Oakdale. Craig tells Rosanna that Paul, Sierra, Dusty, and Barbara all conspired to set him up and get him out of town. Paul tries to tell Rosanna what kinds of threats Craig has made to Jennifer, but Rosanna tells Paul that Craig really loves his children and was heartbroken when she had to give up Cabot again. Paul tells Rosanna that although he's happy to know that Cabot is alive and well, he wishes she had never returned to Oakdale, and then he leaves her with Craig.\n\n\nAt the prom, Celia asks Will why he would buy a dress for her, and he tells her he has plenty of money and knew that she wanted it, so he got it for her; when pressed for a better answer, he says that Celia has proved to be one of the few people who really understands him, and he wanted to thank her for that. Later, Will fantasizes about Celia rushing into his arms after being named prom queen. The prom candidates are announced, and Celia is introduced along with the other girls. The 2 mean girls (Leah and Ann) are in charge of the ballot box for the prom queen vote, and they have arranged a second box that is rigged with winning votes for Celia; in addition, they've rigged a bucket of blood above the prom queen's spot on the stage, and they are delighting in anticipation of what will happen to Celia. Will dances with Gwen and asks her what all the tension between her and Casey is about, but she tells him maybe he's the one who's tense and walks away. Later, Gwen grabs Will and has them switch partners with Casey and Celia, so she can talk to Casey again; Casey is again uncaring and dismissive of her, so she tells him she'll just go talk to Celia instead. Casey rushes off to find Celia, and he goes onto the stage and steps on the trigger for the bucket of blood, which spills over and makes him fall down on the stage, knocking him unconscious.\n\n\nLily arranges to meet with Jessica to discuss Les's case, but on her way out the door, Keith confronts her. She makes an excuse about needing to run an errand, and after she leaves, Keith uses a key to let himself back into her house. He rummages through some drawers until he finds a phone number for a laboratory; he calls the number, tells them he's Lily's assistant, and asks if their report is ready. They ask if he means the report on the bee pollen, and he says yes; they say they're waiting on the police report so they can determine if the sample Lily brought them matches the one in the police report. Keith tells them to cancel the lab work, that the police don't like it when private citizens interfere with their work. Meanwhile, Lily tells Jessica she needs to know about the bee pollen, and Jessica tells her the pollen that killed Julia matches that found in Les's car. She asks if Lily suspects Keith of murdering his sister, but Lily says at worst, she suspects him of planting evidence to convict Les. After Lily tells Jessica how important it is to her to find out just how involved Keith might be, Jessica says she has to leave, but Lily realizes Jess has (intentionally) left the police report on the table, and she takes it with her. From her car, she calls the lab to tell them she has the police report in hand, and they tell her that her assistant already cancelled that job; upon learning that her \"assistant\" is a man, Lily tells the lab she'll bring the report in the morning and hangs up the phone. When she gets back to her house, she finds Keith there, offering her a margarita.\n\n\n\n\n",
