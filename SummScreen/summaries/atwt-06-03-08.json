Brad worried that something might have happened to Janet, but Katie assured him Janet could take care of herself. Kim came into Al's and told Katie that she'd been thinking about an idea Katie had to go on the presidential campaign trail on behalf of the \"Oakdale Now\" show. Kim said the more she thought about it, the more she liked the idea. Brad said he could get different sexy celebrities to co-host the show with him while Katie was gone, and Katie, thinking about Janet, said maybe it wasn't such a good idea after all. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to the TV studio to tape that day's segment of \"Oakdale Now,\" and when they finished, Kim said she thought the campaign story might be a good way to spice things up on the show. Brad told Katie that if what she was really worried about was leaving him with Janet, she needed to trust him, because he could handle himself with Janet, and nothing would happen while Katie was gone. \n\n\nHenry arrived at the diner to find Vienna bussing tables, which upset him greatly. However, he told Vienna he'd just had a meeting with Bonnie, and Bonnie really believed Henry and Vienna could wind up with some substantial money from Gray Gerard's estate. Henry said when they got their first check, he would send Vienna to a lavish spa to be pampered. \n\n\nAt school, Parker ran into Liberty, who was trying to reach her mom to remind her to pick her up for lunch. Ashley came over to say hello, and Liberty told Parker to \"go ahead and ask her\" out. When Ashley asked Parker what it was he wanted to ask her, Parker stammered out a question about their math homework, which Ashley answered before walking away. Liberty couldn't believe it, but Parker said he couldn't ask Ashley out in front of Liberty like that. Liberty told Parker she thought he was thinking about her, ever since their kiss, but Parker denied it and walked away. \n\n\nAt lunchtime, Parker saw Liberty outside waiting for her mom to show up. Liberty again told Parker that she thought Parker liked her since they had kissed, and she offered him another lesson in kissing. Parker told Liberty she had way too much self-esteem and that he would grade her kiss a C minus. Parker said what he needed was a better teacher. Liberty was shocked by Parker's remark, and Parker walked away. Liberty tried again to reach her mom by phone, and again she didn't get an answer, so she decided to check on her mother in person. When she walked into the hotel room, she saw how bruised Janet's cheek was. Liberty asked who had done it to her, but Janet said no one had done it, that it was an accident. Liberty told Janet she'd come to have lunch with her mother and would be really, really nice to her, but Janet told her she would take a rain check, and told Liberty to leave. \n\n\nLiberty went to WOAK, where she told Brad and Katie that her mother had been hurt, and she suspected the man Janet had had drinks with was the one who had hurt her. Brad left to go to the hotel to speak to Janet, while Liberty stayed at WOAK and talked to Katie. Katie asked if anything like that had happened before, and Liberty said her mother didn't have \"the best screening process\" for men. Katie could tell Liberty was worried about her mom, but Liberty told Katie she didn't like to talk about emotions and feelings; instead, she wanted to know how it made Katie feel when her husband left her to go defend an old girlfriend. Katie said Brad's desire to help people was one of the things she loved about him, and unless she wanted to change him, which she didn't, she would have to learn to live with things like that. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Brad got Janet to let him into her room. He asked her who had hit her, and Janet said no one. Brad said he knew it had been Bud, the man Janet had drinks with, but Janet told Brad it wasn't his business and to go back to his wife. Brad left and went down to the lobby, where he happened to see Bud. He approached Bud and very aggressively told him that he knew what Bud had done and if Bud went anywhere near Janet again, he'd have to answer to Brad for it. Brad called Katie to let her know what had happened, while unbeknownst to Brad, Bud went to the elevators and headed upstairs to Janet's room. Brad hung up after telling Katie he was going to go let Janet know he'd talked to Bud. \n\n\nBud knocked on Janet's door, and Janet, thinking it was Brad again, opened it. Bud stormed into the room, demanding to know why Janet had been lying about how she got hurt, saying she'd given herself the black eye. Janet said she'd never said he had hit her, but she tried to call security to get Bud to leave, and he tore the phone from her and shoved her down on the bed. Brad came into the room, spun Bud around and punched him, knocking him down. Bud told Brad, \"You just made a really big mistake!\" Bud used his cell phone to call the police and said he wanted to report an assault and press charges. \n\n\nKatie dropped Liberty back off at school, where Liberty again ran into Parker. Liberty asked if Parker had found a new teacher yet or just bought a book on kissing for dummies. Parker said anything would be better than Liberty's teaching methods, and he thought Liberty had probably only kissed one guy in her life. Liberty said she had 15 times the experience Parker would ever have, and Parker told her to prove it. Liberty said Parker wouldn't be getting any more lessons from her, and Parker responded by saying, \"You're so full of it!\" and walking away. \n\n\nIn New York, Luke convinced Noah to go to the police about the situation with his father. However, outside the police station, they were met by Agent Coyle and a woman who introduced herself as Livia and said she was the lead NYPD detective on the case. The pair took Noah and Luke back to the abandoned building where Colonel Mayer had been hiding. There, Coyle and Livia came up with a plan that involved Noah going to the pier to meet his father as his father had demanded. Luke was against the idea of using Noah as human bait, but Noah said he wanted to do it. \n\n\nLuke said if Noah was going, he was going, too. Livia said that might work, if Coyle took Noah down to the pier first, while she briefed Luke on what he could do. Noah and Coyle left, and Livia gave Luke a map of the pier area to study. While Luke's back was turned, Livia pulled out a weapon and smacked Luke from behind with it, causing him to lose consciousness. \n\n\nAt the pier, Coyle encouraged Noah to go out on the dock to look for his father. Noah did, and Colonel Mayer came out from where he'd been hiding and asked where Ameera was. Coyle appeared behind Noah with Ameera and said, \"Right here.\" Noah made a move, but Livia drew a gun and pointed it at him, telling him to keep still. Colonel Mayer grabbed Ameera, and Coyle handed him an envelope. Colonel Mayer thanked Coyle, who left with Livia. Noah asked his father what he was going to do with Ameera and if he was taking her back to Iraq. The colonel didn't answer directly but said everything he'd done, he had done for Noah's own good. \n\n\nColonel Mayer put Ameera onto his boat and pulled away from the dock. Noah stood watching helplessly at first but became resolved to do something, and he dove onto the back of the boat as it left the dock. Meanwhile, Luke regained consciousness and stumbled outside the abandoned building, where he hailed a taxi. \n\n\nAlison encountered Brenda, the director of Oakdale Memorial Hospital's nursing program, in the hallway of the hospital. Brenda took Alison aside and told her that her barely passing grades and poor lab work were indications she wasn't ready for the rigorous nursing program. Alison emerged from the meeting having been \"kicked out\" of the nursing program. She ran into Aaron and told him the news. Aaron hugged Alison, as Chris walked by. Chris saw the tears in Alison's eyes and asked what had happened. Alison told Chris, and Chris said he was sorry. Chris left, and Alison told Aaron she was going to go ahead and work her shift and not let anyone see how upset she really was. \n\n\nChris went into Brenda's office and told her he was surprised she had acted so quickly. Brenda said she was just doing what Chris had told her to do, and that he'd been right about Alison. \n\n\nNear the end of her shift, Alison ran into her mother. Susan had already heard the bad news, and she took Alison aside to ask her if it had anything to do with Alison's relationship with Chris. Alison's initial response was that it couldn't have, but Susan said that wasn't what she'd been hearing around the hospital. She asked Alison what had been going on with Chris. As Alison told her mom about her decision not to sleep with Chris and how angry that had made Chris, Alison realized that perhaps Chris had indeed been angry enough to seek revenge against her by having her kicked out of the program. \n\n\nBob and Chris went to Al's for lunch. Bob asked his son how work and his personal life were going. Chris said he had slowed things down considerably with Alison. Alison came in, obviously upset, and said she needed to talk to Chris. She told Chris that she knew what he had done, having Brenda kick her out of the nursing program because Alison had refused to sleep with him. Alison said Chris would probably get away with it because of who he was, and because he would get Brenda to back him up on it, but she wanted Chris to know that even at her lowest point, she was better than him. Alison left the diner, and Bob asked Chris if any of what Alison had said was true. Chris said Alison might believe it was true, but it wasn't. Bob told Chris he hoped Alison would keep her accusations to herself. \n\n\nBob returned to the hospital. He asked a nurse if she knew where Brenda was, but the nurse said Brenda was on her break. Susan came into the hallway and saw Bob. Bob told Susan that because they'd known each other so long, he was disappointed that she was spreading rumors about Alison and Chris. Susan said she wasn't spreading rumors but that she had heard the rumors and had asked Alison if they were true. Susan said she didn't think Alison was lying about what had happened. Bob said Chris had denied it, and Susan said it was a case of \"he said/she said,\" but she knew Alison, and she believed her. Bob said, \"I know my son.\" Susan retorted, \"Yeah, we both do!\" before walking away. \n\n\nChris talked privately with Brenda in a stairwell at the hospital and said he wanted to be sure that all of their conversations were kept confidential. Brenda told Chris, \"Absolutely, Dr. Hughes. I won't say a word, ever.\" \n\n\nAlison called Aaron, who met her at Java. Alison told Aaron what she'd found out about Chris's role in her removal from the nursing program, and Aaron asked what Alison intended to do about it. Alison said she wasn't sure, since it was her word against Chris's, but she really thought she would have been a good nurse. Aaron assured her that he thought so, too.\n\n\n",
