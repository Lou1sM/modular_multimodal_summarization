He was excited that he could take course work that would give him time to work on production and direction. Luke attempted to interest Noah in \"relaxing\" with him since they had the house to themselves, but Alison knocked on the front door and interrupted them. She told them both that Adam had died. \n\n\nLuke remembered when Adam had dated Holden's daughter, Abigail Williams, and he and Noah were concerned about how Casey was reacting. Alison said that the family was holding a memorial service that afternoon that only Casey, Margo, and Tom would attend. Noah asked if they should support Casey by crashing the memorial, and they all decided that they would. \n\n\nCasey, Margo, and Tom looked through their family photos that included many pictures of Adam. They were preparing for the memorial service, and Casey was unsure why Margo wanted only the immediate family present. Tom told Casey that Margo was having a difficult time dealing with Adam's death, and she did not want to talk to other people yet. Casey was worried that no one would have anything good to say about Adam if it was only the three of them. He had one good memory of his brother before Adam had changed and become self-serving and dangerous. He recalled how Adam had tried to rape Gwen Munson, Will's wife, and then had gone after Maddie Coleman, Casey's girlfriend. They left for the service. \n\n\nDusty and Bonnie walked around Greenville, and Dusty was frustrated that they had made no progress towards finding Paul and the baby. He asked the local cop, Len, what someone in the town had to do to get the police to do their jobs. Len did not take kindly to Dusty's words or tone, and he threatened to throw Dusty in jail for harassment. Dusty still thought that Edna had told them a fish tale. Bonnie took a call from the police in Sparta, Minnesota, who had found no trace of Paul in their jurisdiction. \n\n\nBonnie was resigned to staying in Greenville for a while, so she decided she needed some fresh fruits and vegetables to protect her arteries. She remembered the farm co-op that they had passed on the way to town, and she asked Dusty to drive her there to buy produce. Dusty was not interested, so Bonnie took the car, and left. \n\n\nAt the co-op farm, Rosanna played the guitar and sang in the shop, as Paul and Eliza walked in. The next customer was Len, the cop from town, who had a date with Rosanna for the movies. Paul panicked and pretended to look at merchandise in the back of the store. Rosanna stopped playing, and Len noticed Eliza in her car seat. Len reminded Rosanna that they had a date, and although it had slipped Rosanna's mind, she covered her mistake and told him she would be ready in a second. She picked up Eliza and took her to Paul in the back room of the store. \n\n\nPaul was fearful that Dusty and Bonnie might recognize Rosanna in town, but she was sure that Edna's story had done the trick and that Paul's pursuers were on their way to Sparta on a wild goose chase. Rosanna left with Len, and they drove to town. As they walked on the street, Len mentioned that there was a jerk from Illinois in town looking for a man and a baby. He and Rosanna got ice cream, and suddenly Len spotted Dusty sitting on a bench talking on his cell phone. \n\n\nRosanna excused herself, saying she felt sick, and Len decided to take on Dusty by himself. He approached the bench, and he and Dusty exchanged words. After Dusty left, Rosanna reappeared, but she begged off going to the movies because she didn't feel well. She was all right to walk back to the farm, she said, and she took off. \n\n\nThe three Hughes family members sat in the church, and Alison, Luke, and Noah entered. Casey greeted them and invited them to stay. Tom and Margo talked about Adam to each other, and then the minister invited all those present to celebrate the life of Adam Christopher Harold Munson, and led them in a prayer. The minister asked if anyone wanted to speak about Adam, and there was silence until a new voice spoke up from the rear of the church. Everyone turned to stare at an Army sergeant in uniform walking up the aisle. \n\n\nThe soldier introduced himself as Riley Morgan, and said that he had met Adam in a tavern in Afghanistan. He said that he and Adam had many conversations about how Adam could make amends for his misdeeds and how he had treated his family back home. Adam was helping a particular Afghan family rebuild their war-ravaged home and lives, and it gave him hope that he could rebuild his own. Sgt. Morgan expressed his condolences and prepared to leave the church. Margo stopped him and expressed her thanks. She invited all the young people to join them at home for food, including Riley Morgan. \n\n\nBack home, Casey and Alison stayed out on the patio a moment and talked. Casey thought that it was weird that his brother had gone all the way to Afghanistan to make amends. Casey admitted that he felt responsible for Adam's leaving home, because he and Will Munson had told Adam to leave town and never return. Alison tried to convince Casey that he was in no way responsible for Adam's death. Casey only wanted to be with Alison, so they made plans for after lunch. \n\n\nInside, Tom asked Sgt. Morgan how he had ended up in Oakdale. Riley said he had wanted to see Adam's parents, and he presented Margo with an envelope that contained a CD that Adam had made of some of his favorite music. Margo was very touched and thanked Riley effusively. Luke and Noah spent some time with Riley and asked questions about his job and where he had trained. \n\n\nIt turned out that the sergeant had trained at the same Army base in Georgia where Noah had been born. Luke asked if Riley knew of Colonel Winston Mayer, but he never got an answer. When Margo walked back into the living room, Sgt. Morgan said goodbye. When Margo learned that the sergeant was headed for a motel for the night, she invited him to stay overnight in Adam's room. Casey and Alison headed out. \n\n\nAt the co-op, Paul talked to his sleeping daughter as Bonnie walked in. Paul hid behind a counter, and Bonnie noticed the baby. She talked to Eliza, and called for whoever was attending the baby, but no one answered. Bonnie was concerned, and mused out loud that perhaps she should contact the police. Just then, a woman co-op worker appeared and identified the baby as \"Edna's granddaughter.\" Bonnie paid for her purchases and left. Paul finally stood up and said, \"Bye-bye, Bonnie.\" \n\n\nRosanna retuned from her aborted date and called for Paul. She reported that she had seen Dusty Donovan in town, and Paul said that Bonnie McKechnie had just been in the store and had almost caught him. Rosanna suggested that Paul take his baby back to Oakdale immediately, but Paul said he needed some time to think. \n\n\nBonnie drove back to town and found Dusty. She wanted to leave Greenville, but Dusty scolded her for not looking harder for Eliza. Bonnie mentioned that her heart had almost stopped when she saw an unattended baby in the co-op store, but then a worker had told her that the baby was Edna's granddaughter. Dusty asked how Bonnie knew the baby wasn't Meg's, but she could not give a good answer. Neither Dusty nor Bonnie had a picture of the infant, but Dusty said he knew where to get one. \n\n\nThey roamed the streets looking for the police officer, and they finally found him. Dusty swallowed his pride and made nice to the officer, while Bonnie pleaded with him to get them a photo of Eliza from the Oakdale Police. Len told them to stay put, and he left. Len was gone a long while, but he eventually returned with a picture of Paul holding the baby. Bonnie took a good look and was stunned to realize that she had been looking right at Eliza Ryan in the co-op store. \n\n\nLuke and Noah talked at home, and Luke made the suggestion that Noah's movie project should be about his own life growing up on military bases. Noah was not sure that he wanted to explore that deeply into his own life, but they put that decision on hold when they realized that they had the house to themselves, and they headed for Luke's room. \n\n\nMargo told Tom that she was grateful that Riley had shown up and spoken at the service. She was comforted by the young man's presence. Tom was concerned that Margo might get too attached to the sergeant, and he warned her about pressuring the man to stay more than one night. Margo promised not to push. She played Adam's CD, and they heard their son's voice singing. \n\n\nRiley came downstairs and talked with Margo. He asked for a glass of milk, and Margo threw in some chocolate chip cookies. Riley said that he had been thinking of eventually going to Los Angeles to produce music, a path that Adam had once followed. Margo invited him to consider thinking of Oakdale as his home, and she told him to stay as long as he wished with them. Riley expressed gratitude, and he went upstairs to Adam's room. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Casey and Alison sequestered themselves in an empty break room, and pulled the blinds closed and began kissing.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Noah learns that he has been accepted into the honors Film department program; he will be able to produce and direct his own film. He and Luke's private celebration is interrupted when Allison tells shows up to tell them about Adam's death. Casey, Tom and Margo prepare to go to a private memorial service for Adam. Margo doesn't want anyone else there because she can't handle it right now, as Casey worries to Tom about if they are the only ones there, who will be able to say something nice about Adam. Luke, Noah and Allison decide that Casey needs their support even if they weren't invited to the service. They show up and Casey is thrilled to see their faces. The memorial service starts and the priest asks if anyone wants to share anything about Adam, and a young military man steps forward. Sgt. Riley offers a story and talks about their friendship and how Adam came there to make amends for what he did in his life. Margo, Tom and Casey seem appreciative that he was able to shed some light onto what Adam had been up to. Margo invites Riley back to their home for food. Riley talks with Noah about his time on base in Georgia, and Noah learns he was stationed at the same base his parents had him. Riley gives Margo a CD that Adam made. Margo offers Riley a place to stay before he leaves town. Casey leaves with Allison because he can't handle this right now and wants to be alone with her. He admits that he is worried that Adam died before they could make amends \u0096 he also wonders if he could have even made amends with Adam. Allison offers him comfort. Tom worries that Margo might grow attached to Riley because of his connection to Adam, as Margo promises not to. After she gets emotional from listening to Adam's CD and Riley comes downstairs for milk since he can't sleep (a favorite also of Adam's), Margo tells him that he should consider this place a home to him and he is welcome to stay as long as he wants. Riley is happy to hear this. Luke thinks that he knows what Noah should write about in his film; he should write about his life growing up with the Colonel and about living on all the bases, he lived on. Noah is intrigued but doesn't think anyone would be interested, as Luke disagrees. Paul continues to elude Dusty and Bonnie while he spends time with Rosanna. Dusty doesn't ingratiate himself to a local police officer very well. Rosanna goes on a date with that same man, who tells her about Dusty. Rosanna cuts her date short to warn Paul, who is having a close call himself when Bonnie is at Rosanna's farm stand shopping and sees Eliza, whom she doesn't know. She becomes concerned when she sees the baby unattended because Paul had to hide from her. Finally, as she is about to call the police, an employee comes out and tells her that the baby is one of the employee's grandchildren. Bonnie later tells Dusty about this casually and he is suspicious. They decide they have to get a photo of Eliza and the only way to do that is to ask the police for help. Dusty and Bonnie return to see the officer and apologize and plead for his help. He is finally inclined to help them. He later brings back a photo of Eliza and Bonnie is overwhelmed to see that the baby she saw at the farm stand is Eliza. Meanwhile, Rosanna is instructing Paul that he needs to take the baby back to Meg. Paul needs more time to think. Rosanna tells him that if he isn't going home and he doesn't want to go to jail, then he has to leave now because it is only a matter of time before they arrive there looking for him.",
