Dr. Daniels says he is a specialist in the \"cause of death\" and will re-examine the recent deaths that have been occurring at the hospital.  Everyone seems to respond well to this, except for John Dixon who doubts the partiality of Dr. Daniels since he was hired by Bob. \n\n\nKatie finds a vial underneath the bed in Mrs. Scott's (the woman who recently died) room.  Dr. Gordo walks in and tells Katie to throw out the vial.  She tells him she is going to report it to Arlene Crebbs, the head nurse.  Dr. Gordo takes the vial and throws it out but Katie goes to retrieve it.  As she is doing this, Nurse Crebbs comes in and asks what is going on.  Katie tells her about the empty vial she found and Nurse Crebbs reprimands Dr. Gordo for not reporting it.  Later, Nurse Crebbs makes a phone call to someone, reporting the found empty vial that was once filled with an injectable medicine.\n\n\nDr. Gordo again tries to ask out Alison.  He asks her why she hates him but she says she is not interested in dating him.  While Alison is left alone at the nurse's station, she pages Chris over the loudspeaker.  As she is waiting for him, she sees someone in a wheelchair, their face covered by a hood.  She asks if they need help but the person wheels themselves away as the storm continues to make the lights flicker.  Alison gets scared and screams and Chris then arrives.  She makes him close his eyes, and then she puts mistletoe over their heads and kisses him.  He kisses her back but then he pulls away, telling Alison they can't do this.  He says he is on duty and also a lot older than her.  Alison says, \"But you liked it.\"  His reply is, \"That's not the point.  It only proves I'm a normal man.\"  He tells her to stop acting like a little girl and walks away.  Alison gets mad and when she sees Dr. Gordo again she asks him if he would still like to go out.  He does and she tells him she'll be \"dressed to kill.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Katie also sees the mysterious person in the wheelchair.  She tells the person she will help them but they again wheel themselves away.  Katie walks into a room and notices something under the bed.  She looks to discover that it is Nurse Crebbs \u2013 who is dead.   \n\n\nRose is still shaky from the incident with one of Spangler's men.  She tells Dusty she doesn't know when he is telling the truth.  Lily goes to see Rose and talks to her while Margo questions Dusty about the incident.  Then, Lily tells Dusty to leave town and to let Rose's family help her through this rough time.  Rose tells Lily how Dusty saved her and that she has feelings for him. Lily says she is not thinking straight when it comes to Dusty and that she is \"trashing Paul's memory.\"  Rose tells Lily that she only pretends to care and that she always hates all of Rose's decisions.  Rose says that Lily thinks she is nothing but \"Jersey trash\".  They continue to argue and Rose says she is done with the \"sisterly bond\".  She says she doesn't need Lily in her life anymore.  Lily asks, \" Is that what you want?  Please don't shut me out.\"  Rose turns away and doesn't answer Lily so she leaves.  Then, Rose calls Dusty and tells him she needs him.  She says, \"I need you here and I need to be with you tonight.\"  Dusty smiles.  \n\n\nCraig gets Molly to help him meet with Parker.  They go to Al's Diner and Craig showers him with food.  When he asks Parker where mommy is, Parker says \"mooshybells\".  At first they don't know what he is saying but then they figure it out.  \"Mooshybells\" is actually \"Musselshell\", a place in Montana.\n\n\nCarly is shown in a cabin with a woman trying to get her to eat.  The woman hands Carly her cell phone and tells her a lot of people have called her.  Carly says she doesn't want to talk to them and that if Jack wanted to be with her, he would be there.  Carly remembers her times with Jack \u2013 from the beginning up until present times.  She tells the woman that she wants to make a new home for Parker and her new baby girl and she was hoping that she could do it in Musselshell.\n\n\n",
