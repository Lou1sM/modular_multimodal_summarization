He didn't know where they were because they couldn't really be misplaced when they were in an underwear drawer. Katie went upstairs to check her jewelry. When she reappeared, she had her own jewelry box. All of her precious jewelry pieces were missing. They called the police. \n\n\nMargo arrived. Katie and Henry told her that they hadn't really checked since Deerbrook, so they didn't know how long the jewelry had been missing. No one had been in the house except a next-door neighbor who lived about a mile away, and she had been there to feed the rabbits. She definitely wasn't the type that would have done anything. Henry dismissed himself to go and buy another lock for the door. \n\n\nMargo apologized later to Katie about the incident at Deerbrook when she'd had to have Katie taken there. She wanted Katie to remember that whatever they had done, they had done out of love and concern for Katie. Margo left, and Henry emerged from the bushes and called Margo back. \n\n\nSimon said to Katie that someone would have to fence the jewelry, and he would somehow get it back for her. Outside, Henry told Margo that the incident had Pilar's type of work written all over it. He said that Russ had been let out of jail after a $5000 bond had been paid. Henry was willing to bet that that would be the dollar value of the jewelry that was missing. \n\n\nPilar got a hold of Russ and met him in his car. She told him that if he wanted his money, he had to help her out. She needed him to convince Mike that Russ was still after her. It had to appear that Russ was still a threat to her. He told her she had one week to get everything in order and that was the last time he was going along with her plans. At Mike's, Pilar left a note and started to remove her belongings. Mike entered and read the note. \n\n\nPilar entered to get the rest of her things. Mike told her that Katie was out of the hospital. Pilar reacted with shock and asked if Katie had escaped. Mike told her that Simon had returned, and Katie had been signed out. Pilar wished Mike well, knowing that he still loved Katie. Pilar said that she had heard something outside. \n\n\nMike had heard nothing, but he went outside to check. He returned, and as he entered, a rock was thrown through the window. Mike rushed out and found Russ. Russ told Mike to tell Pilar that he was out of jail, and he would get her.\n\n\nPaul arrived at Barbara's. She was tossing papers around and was visibly upset. She was trying to put together the pieces of information that James had sent her. She knew that something had to be done because Jordan could end up being her son and Jennifer's brother. Paul told her not to mention anything to Jennifer because they did not know what the facts really were -- yet. Rosanna called Paul and asked him to please stop over. She was frantic about Jordan taking Cabot.\n\n\nJennifer and Jordan were in bed together. Jennifer asked him what he was going to do about Cabot. He said he still had questions, like who Cabot's real mother was and why he and Rosanna had been thrown together.\n\n\nBarbara knocked on Jennifer's bedroom door then burst in, discovering Jordan and Jennifer getting dressed. She backed up and closed the door. Jennifer stepped out and told her mother that she was not a teenager anymore, and she was in love with Jordan. Barbara pleaded with Jennifer not to get involved with a married man. Barbara implored Jennifer to promise that she would not sleep with him. She could not be with Jordan -- Jennifer had to believe Barbara about it. \n\n\nJennifer rushed back to her bedroom and Jordan. He told her that he needed to see James Stenbeck. Jennifer knew that Barbara wouldn't help him, but they did know someone who might. Jennifer and Jordan went to see Jack. He agreed to get Jordan in to see James.\n\n\nPaul was at Rosanna's. He told her she had nothing to worry about. She had guards posted all over the place. Paul reassured Rosanna that Jordan and Jennifer would not get married and take Cabot away. She asked why, and Paul told her that Barbara wouldn't approve of the union. \n\n\nRosanna was curious about what else Paul knew. Paul thought James was more involved. The chance was that Jordan might be James's son, and if that were true, James had a bigger hold. Rosanna said, \"If this is true, Cabot will need me more than ever.\"\n\n\nPaul returned to Barbara's. Barbara told him that Jordan and Jennifer had spent the night together. Barbara had just about lost it. Paul told her to get dressed; he needed her help. They were flying somewhere. Paul and Barbara were going to the place where Jordan was.\n\n\nCarly arrived at Rosanna's. Rosanna thought it was Jordan. She said she was not going to let Jordan get close to Cabot. Carly reminded her that he was Cabot's father. It didn't make him the enemy. He was just a father who wanted to get to know his son. Rosanna said Paul was helping her. Carly said not to believe everything Paul said; he was the reason she had almost lost Cabot in the first place. \n\n\nCarly reminded Rosanna that she could have anything she wanted, but she wanted everything. She would be wiser to let Jordan get to know his son, and they could share custody of him. She could still have Cabot. Rosanna said that if there were going to be a war over Cabot, she needed Paul on her side. \n\n\n",
