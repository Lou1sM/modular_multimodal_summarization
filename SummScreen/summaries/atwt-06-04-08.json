Katie saw Bud calling the police and asked Brad to tell her what was going on, but Bud interrupted and said Brad had attacked him.  Katie was shocked and angry that Brad had been in a fight over Janet.  Janet tried to explain that Brad thought he was protecting her from Bud, but Bud explained he had not given Janet her black eye.  Brad confronted Bud again and began yelling that he had found Bud manhandling Janet, but Bud denied ever harming Janet.  Brad threatened to punch Bud again, just as Jack and another police officer showed up and demanded entrance into the room.  \n\n\nOnce inside, Jack tried to figure out what led to the altercation.   Janet admitted that Bud had not hit her, but Brad claimed he thought he was protecting the mother of his daughter when he went after Bud.   Katie listened as Brad defended Janet and Bud said he was pressing charges.  Jack told Brad he had no choice but to arrest him.  Janet quickly offered to go with Brad to post bail, but Katie told her to stay away because she had already caused enough problems.  As Jack led Brad out of the room in handcuffs, Liberty arrived and knew right away that her mom was the reason for Brad's trouble.   \n\n\nDown at the police station, Jack took Brad and Katie in to the interrogation room and Brad admitted that he hit Bud.  Brad tried to defend his actions, but Katie had heard enough and left the room to phone Kim.  A short time later, Katie returned and spoke to Brad alone.  Katie was obviously annoyed with Brad, but he said he could not let Liberty see a man treat her mother that way.  Katie was still angry with Brad.  \n\n\nA short time later, a visibly irate Kim stormed in to the station and told Brad that if the assault charges stuck he would be fired.  Kim was furious with Brad's silly shenanigans and admonished him for not thinking of his responsibilities to the show.   As Kim walked out, Katie chased after her and tried to explain the situation and defend Brad.  Kim said that they would have to wait and see what the judge decided because advertisers would not want a criminal as their on-screen spokesperson.  Kim left and Katie watched as Brad was taken down to be booked.  \n\n\nLiberty and Janet came to the station to check on Brad, and Katie explained he was fine.  Katie pulled Janet to the side and accused Janet of enjoying Brad's heroics.  Janet said she knew this was her fault and she felt bad about Brad's arrest.  Katie saw Jack return and asked him what she should do to help Brad.  Jack said Brad's best hope was for Bud to drop the charges.  Jack deliberately left Bud's phone number out so that Katie could call him.  \n\n\nParker arrived to see Jack and learned about Brad's trouble from Liberty.  Janet asked Parker to take Liberty out and get her mind off of Brad.  Parker agreed and he and Liberty set off for some fun.  \n\n\nKatie phoned Bud and asked him to come back down to the station so they could work something out.  Bud arrived and told Katie he wanted money and an apology to drop the charges.   Brad was returned from booking and said he would not say sorry to Bud.  After hearing Brad's refusal, Bud left and Katie was furious with Brad.   A patrolman took Brad into the interrogation room, as Jack offered to help Katie get Bud to drop the charges. \n\n\nJack and Katie went to Lakeview and found Bud.  Katie offered Bud double the money instead of Brad's apology.   At first, Bud refused, but after some convincing, he decided his best bet was to take the money.  \n\n\nWhile Jack and Katie were gone, Janet stuck around to talk with Brad.  She apologized for the trouble she caused, but Brad reassured her it was not her fault.  Brad suddenly realized Katie had left and asked Janet where she had gone.  Janet told Brad that Katie had left with Jack.  In an attempt to make Brad jealous, Janet made a point to play up the fact that Jack and Katie were working together.   \n\n\nKatie returned to the station with Jack and gave Brad the good news that Bud had dropped the charges.  Brad was released from custody and went with Katie to talk to Kim.  Kim said she was happy Brad's current legal troubles had ended, but was worried that Brad would make another mistake soon.  \n\n\nJanet continued to make trouble for Brad and Katie by talking to Jack.  At first, she thanked Jack for helping with Brad, but then she insisted Jack was only motivated by his feelings for Katie.  Jack claimed he and Katie were just friends, but Janet was not swayed.  She remained hopeful that Katie and Brad could be split up, and seemed to think Jack might be the man to do it.\n\n\nParker took Liberty to the school yard and the two shared stories about their conniving mothers.  Eventually they started playing football and had a good time messing around.  During all their football fun, Liberty and Parker fell to the ground and just as it looked like they might kiss, Liberty's phone rang with the good news that Brad was out of jail.  She quickly left the awkward scene.\n\n\nAt Java, Aaron tried to cheer Alison up after she was expelled from nursing school.  Amy arrived at the coffee house and told Alison and Aaron that everyone was talking about how Alison had been kicked out of the program, once she stopped sleeping with Chris.  Alison tried to defend herself and said she had not slept with Chris, but Amy said no one would believe her.  Amy left to return to class and Aaron congratulated Alison on standing up for herself.  Alison explained that even though she was out of the nursing program, she still worked at the hospital and did not want people thinking the worst of her.   \n\n\nChris found Brenda, the head of the nursing program, and asked her to agree not to tell anyone that he had persuaded her to kick Alison out of school.  As Brenda told Chris that Alison was already doing poorly in her classes and no one would be suspicious of her dismissal, Bob walked in and wanted to know why Chris had any say in Alison's expulsion.  Bob asked Chris if he had interfered with Alison's education.  Chris lied and told his father that he wanted to see Alison succeed and was surprised when she had been let go from the program.  Bob asked Brenda if Chris was being truthful and she backed up Chris's story by saying that Alison's work was subpar.   Bob apologized for thinking the worse of Chris and went to find Susan. \n\n\nBob located Susan in the hall and told her that Brenda had told him that Alison's dismissal was because she was unable to do the work.  Susan said she was not surprised because Alison was struggling.  Bob reprimanded Susan for not getting all of her facts straight before she accused Chris of getting Alison kicked out.   \n\n\nAfter talking to Bob, Susan went to Java and told Alison that there was no conspiracy behind her being dismissed from the program.  Alison was angry that her mom was not defending her and returned to the hospital for another shift.  Aaron decided it was time to talk to Chris. \n\n\nAaron went to the hospital and told Chris that he ruined Alison's dream because she would not sleep with him.  Chris said he had nothing to do with it and said Alison self-destructed all on her own.  He walked away after telling Aaron that Alison was no longer his problem.   \n\n\nAaron found Alison and told her that he believed Chris sabotaged her education.   Alison said she had no way of proving that Chris was behind her expulsion and she wanted to move on and focus on her job at the hospital.  Alison returned to work and her first patient was in a room with Chris.  After giving her instructions, Chris walked out and spoke with a hospital administrator about getting Alison put into a strictly administrative position.  Once Alison was done with her patient, she learned from the administrator that Chris had asked that Alison no longer work with patients.  \n\n\nAlison confronted Chris in the on-call room and told him he had no right to get her removed from caring for patients.  In the meantime, Aaron found Susan and told her that he was sure Chris was behind Alison's expulsion.  Aaron explained that Chris had just had Alison removed from patient care and would need her mother's support because she was going to fight her dismissal.  \n\n\n",
