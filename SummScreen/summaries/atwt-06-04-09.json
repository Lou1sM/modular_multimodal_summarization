    "soap_central": "\n\n \nKatie received a call from Kim asking her and Brad to go the studio to tape a segment to finish up the baby-making show. Brad arrived home and had bought Katie some pre-natal vitamins to help keep their baby strong. Katie told him about Kim's request, but she said there was a problem: Kim also wanted Vienna and Henry to do the show with them. \n\n\nKim also called Vienna about the taping, but Henry thought it was a bad idea. He said neither one of them should participate, but Vienna changed her clothes, anyway, and tried to convince Henry to accompany her. Henry had bad vibes about WOAK, because that was where Vienna had fallen and lost their baby. He said he had no desire to go on television after losing the baby lottery. Vienna argued that it was not about winning or losing, but Henry just couldn't bring himself to do it. \n\n\nVienna went to the studio, and Brad and Katie were already there. Kim greeted her with a hug and asked about Henry. Vienna made an excuse, but Katie figured out that Henry was too upset to participate. Kim thanked Vienna for returning to the studio, and she went to prepare for the taping. \n\n\nPaul packed Eliza and her carrier into the car, as Rosanna asked if he needed milk for her. The baby was already fussy, but Paul said they would get food on the road. Rosanna wished Paul well, and they said their goodbyes. Edna rushed up to the car to tell them that the police had called, and they had identified Paul and Eliza. Edna refused to take all the blame, and she said that Paul had to take Rosanna with him immediately, since she had vouched for him and had brought trouble to their community. There was no time for Rosanna to grab even her purse, so Paul asked her to get in the car. \n\n\nIn Greenville, Bonnie verified for the cop, Len, that the infant she had seen at the farm co-op was definitely Eliza Ryan. Dusty tried to hurry the policeman into action, but Len did not move fast enough. Dusty took off for his car, and Bonnie ran after him. They drove to the co-op store and dashed inside. They found Edna on duty, and Dusty asked for Paul and the baby. Edna told him that they could be anywhere. The two of them argued until they heard a siren, and Len drove up in his squad car. \"Here comes Barney Fife,\" quipped Dusty. Dusty told Len that Edna had covered for Paul all along, and she had also lied to them by saying that Paul was bound for Sparta, Minnesota. \n\n\nLen apologized to Edna, but he said that he had to take her in for questioning. Dusty demanded that Edna tell him where Paul had taken the baby, but Edna only agreed to accompany Len to the police station. She also maintained that she had nothing to do with any kidnapping. Bonnie decided to try a different approach, and she told Edna how sorry she was that her friend was so abrupt. She said that they were just worried about Eliza. Edna kept denying any involvement with Paul, so Bonnie mentioned that she was a lawyer, and she offered Edna free legal advice if she needed it. \n\n\nEdna continued to protest her innocence, as Bonnie began telling her about the baby's mother. She said that Meg lived on a beautiful farm not unlike the co-op, and that the child was surrounded by people who loved her there. Edna then revealed that Paul had headed south on Route 6. Bonnie thanked her and got Dusty, and they ran to his car. \n\n\nThey stopped at a motel and asked the manager if he had seen Paul, but the man said no. Bonnie suddenly began to feel very ill, and she ran from Dusty to find a bathroom. She returned in a while, but she was still sick, and she almost collapsed. Dusty announced that she was going nowhere, and he booked two rooms with the manager. \n\n\nBonnie was miserable as Dusty got her settled in one of the rooms. She gave him the option of leaving her there and continuing the pursuit, but Dusty refused to abandon her \"on death's door.\" He brought her extra pillows and sat on the bed and applied a cold cloth to her forehead. \n\n\nOn the road, Paul experienced car trouble again, and the vehicle died and would not start. Rosanna realized that she had no purse with her, and therefore no money. She asked Paul how much money he had, and Paul confessed that he was broke. Paul got out to push the car, so Rosanna moved to the driver's side and laughed at their predicament. Paul began to push, but the exertion soon exhausted him. Eliza got hungry and began wailing, and Rosanna was worried how they were going to feed the child with no money. Paul remembered that they had passed a diner not too far back, and he suggested they walk there and beg for free milk for his daughter. \n\n\nAt the diner, the two of them improvised a sob story for the owner. They claimed they were auto workers from Detroit who had just been laid off, and they asked for milk for their baby. The proprietor was reluctant until Paul mentioned a huge stack of dishes waiting to be washed in the kitchen, and he volunteered to do it in exchange for milk. The man agreed, and Paul went to work, while Rosanna gave Eliza a much-welcomed bottle of milk. Eliza cried after her feeding, and Rosanna spotted a guitar in the corner of the restaurant. She asked to borrow it, and she proceeded to play it and sing a soothing song to the baby. Eliza quieted down immediately, and Paul came out and shared a poignant moment with Rosanna as the baby fell asleep. \n\n\nPaul tried unsuccessfully to start his car, so he returned to the diner. Rosanna told him that the owner had so enjoyed her singing that he had offered them the use of a small room with a cot behind the diner. They checked out the room, and Rosanna said she felt secure there. She took the cot, while Paul bedded down on the floor, and Eliza slept in her car seat. Rosanna leaned down and took Paul's hand as they were falling asleep. \n\n\nBack at WOAK, Kim began taping the segment, and Brad could not contain himself. He broke the news to all of Oakdale that he and Katie were having a miracle baby of their own. Katie introduced Vienna, who gave a moving eulogy about the loss of her own baby. Suddenly Katie gasped and slid from her chair onto the floor, unconscious. \n\n\nKim called an ambulance, which transported Katie, who was awake again, to the hospital. The doctor admitted her to Memorial and got her into a room. Katie was terrified that she was losing the baby, but Brad and Vienna tried to buck up her spirits. Vienna called Henry from the hall, and he promised that he would join them immediately. \n\n\nBrad talked to the baby in Katie's womb until the doctor joined them. She told Katie that her baby was fine, but that Katie's blood pressure was very high. She recommended that in order to avoid preeclampsia, Katie should stay on complete bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy. Katie was also to avoid stress whenever possible. Vienna and Brad both vowed to spoil Katie rotten for the months ahead. Katie ordered them both to return to the studio so as not to leave Kim hanging without a conclusion to her segment. Brad left to fill out paperwork, and Vienna waited with Katie. \n\n\nHenry arrived bearing a beautiful bouquet of yellow roses, and Brad and Vienna took off for WOAK. Katie and Henry had a chance to work out their differences and put the past behind them. Henry was delighted to have his best friend back, and the two of them hugged. \n\n\nBrad and Vienna finished their segment on air, and Vienna was particularly charming. Kim thanked her for helping, and Brad put out the offer that he could do the show solo until Katie delivered the baby. Kim said that the show worked best with two hosts, and Vienna unexpectedly offered to step in and work with Brad. Brad was all for it, so Kim suggested a trial show to see how their chemistry worked. Vienna was excited, and she guaranteed that Henry would not be a problem. They returned to Katie's hospital room, and spread the word that Brad was working again, and that Vienna would fill in for Katie. Katie thought that was a wonderful idea, but Henry was less than enthusiastic. \n\n\nBrad took Katie home and brought her a healthy tray in bed. He wanted to make sure that she was all right with his doing the show with Vienna, and Katie reassured him that she was fine with it. Brad took a call from Kim asking him to attend a meeting right away about the show, and Katie encouraged him to go. \n\n\nHenry argued with Vienna about working so closely with Brad. He went off on a tangent about Brad and Angelina, and how attractive people working together sometimes made more than just good chemistry. He became over-wrought until Vienna stepped up and reminded him with whom she would be spending her nights. They kissed and fell upon the bed, until Vienna's phone rang. Kim asked Vienna to attend the meeting with Brad right away. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Brad and Vienna watched the airing of the show they had taped. Henry watched it in his room at the Lakeview, but then he threw the remote at the television. Katie watched it from her bed, and she thought the show was wonderful.\n\n\n",
