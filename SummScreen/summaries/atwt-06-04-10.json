    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Lily's house, Faith said her mother wasn't fooling anyone. Lily admitted that she had feelings for Holden, but the kiss hadn't meant anything. Faith figured that Lily wanted to break up Holden and Molly, but Lily insisted that the kiss had happened at a fragile moment. Faith stated that she knew what-or who-made her mother happy, and most of the time, she wanted her mother to be happy. Lily said that it was the sweetest thing that Faith had said in months.\n\n\n       Alone later, Lily found a photo of her, Faith, and Holden wedged between some furniture. Lily put it back on display and drank some wine. She fell asleep and dreamed that Holden and Faith had orchestrated an impromptu wedding in the living room for him and Lily. In the dream, Holden said that they were \"now and forever a part of each other.\" They kissed, and Molly peered in from the window, but then disappeared.\n\n\nLily awakened and looked at the picture. She called herself insane, but then wondered what would be the worst thing that could happen. She got up and left the house.\n\n\nAt the Old Mill, Holden wrested the gun from Silas, who bragged about what a spitfire Molly was for the camera. Holden punched him out, and Molly sobbed that the high Silas had almost raped her. She explained that Silas had threatened to reveal sex videos of her if she'd refused to meet him. Holden tied Silas to a chair and went to get a cell phone from the car.\n\n\n       Silas snickered that Molly would never be happy with the farm boy. He said she had a lot to offer a man-as a mistress, not a wife. Silas called her cheap and dirty, and he had the videos to prove it. She grabbed the gun, aimed it at him, and commanded him to shut up.\n\n\n       Silas goaded Molly saying she looked sexy with the gun. He somehow got out of his restraints and said that after a short stint in jail, he'd be back. \"What are you are is a whore, but you're my whore-then, now, forever,\" he told her. The word \"whore\" echoed through Molly's mind, and she screamed, \"No!\" She fired the gun, and a bullet silenced Silas.\n\n\n       Holden rushed into the room, and as he checked Silas, Molly babbled about what Silas had said to her. Holden grabbed the gun and said that it was over. He took the video camera from the mantlemantel, and as the cop police sirens drew nearer, he urged Molly to tell the police that she'd shot Silas to prevent him from raping her. Molly shook her head and cried that it hadn't happened that way. Holden, however, insisted that it was self-defense. A sniffling Molly agreed.\n\n\nHolden and Molly went to the farm, where Holden stated that the police questioning had gone well. He pulled some disks from his pocket, and Molly urged him to burn them. He promised to take care of it, but wondered why she hadn't told him about Silas. She said that she hadn't wanted Holden to think that it was another jealous ploy. Holden blamed himself for being too involved with Lily to have been there for Molly. He felt that he'd lost his bearings for a while, but he knew that he wanted Molly. To prove it, he asked her to marry him.\n\n\nLily arrived on the porch and practiced what she'd say to Holden. When she was ready, she opened the kitchen door.\n\n\nAs Liberty babysat Johnny, Craig called and persuaded her to let him speak to his son. During the call, Craig urged Johnny to convince Gabriel that they all should be a family.\n\n\nUpon encountering Gabriel in town, Parker reasoned that the punch over the stolen money had made them even. Gabriel, however, quipped that it had been a sucker punch. Parker warned him to stay away from Liberty, but Gabriel expected some appreciation for pointing the finger at Craig instead of Parker. Johnny and Liberty approached, and Parker took off.\n\n\nThe threesome went to Al's, and Liberty said that they should go to a Cubs game. Johnny wanted his father to go, too, because he missed Craig. Gabriel looked guilty, and Johnny went to the bar for ice cream. Liberty told Gabriel not to feel guilty for telling the truth about Craig. Gabriel abruptly left, and Liberty pursued him outside.\n\n\nGabriel felt that he should leave to save Johnny the pain of learning who his father really was. Liberty stated that Craig wasn't as bad as everyone thought. Gabriel decided that he didn't belong in Oakdale. He didn't know how to be a brother, and he refused to be Craig's son. She asked if he were sure that he couldn't find one thing to like about Oakdale. Gabriel suddenly tried to kiss Liberty, but she pushed him away. She apologized for giving him the wrong idea, but she said that she just couldn't do it.\n\n\nAt home, Jack and Carly argued, because he still questioned Gabriel's story about the assault before the fire. Jack exclaimed that he needed to know the truth, but Carly said that they had a chance to regain their life and family-unless he ruined it. Jack stated that the force used to knock Gabriel out should have shattered the lightweight glass angel that Craig had supposedly hit Gabriel with; however, they'd found it still intact.\n\n\nAs the couple bickered about it, Parker entered and noted that his parents were at it again. Carly claimed that they were talking about a family vacation. She took off to the library to research destinations, and Jack said that they argued to determine what was best for their children. Wishing that they could figure it out already, Parker left to  go study.\n\n\nLater, Faith found Parker studying at Java, and after she helped him a little, she said that it was time for him to let Liberty go. He claimed that he was over Liberty, and there was no need to mention her name again. Faith started quizzing him on history, and Liberty strode into Java. Parker got distracted, and a disappointed Faith took off.\n\n\n       Liberty told Parker that he and Gabriel were playing Tugtug-of-war over her, but she had too much catching up to do in her life to deal with that. She said she missed their friendship, and he replied that he did, as well. They hugged, and Gabriel saw them through the window.\n\n\nJack went to the police holding cells to tell Craig that there were inconsistencies in Gabriel's story. Jack figured that the case might not go to trial if Craig could clear them up. Jack wondered why Craig danced around the arson charge, but professed complete innocence in the assault against Gabriel. \"I know what I did and didn't do,\" Craig responded.\n\n\nCraig thought that he and Jack could agree that they didn't want to put Parker in jeopardy during the investigation; however, Jack's visit had given Craig hope. In returned return for it, Craig issued a warning about Carly. Craig said his obsession with Carly had led him to make bad choices. She'd left him emotionally, financially, and morally bankrupt.\n\n\nJack didn't want to hear it, but Craig insisted that Carly was toxic. \"In the end, she'll push you over the line, too,\" Craig warned. Jack left, and Craig told a guard to cancel his requests for law books. The guard asked if Craig had given up. \"I'm getting out,\" Craig replied.\n\n\nCarly stopped by the police evidence room and claimed that Jack had lost his watch in one of the evidence boxes. She asked Kenny, the officer on duty, if she could search for it. He hesitated to break the rules; however, when Carly narrowed it down to the Monte Carlo evidence box, Kenny let her see it. He stepped away, and she hid the angel statue in her coat. Kenny returned as Carly started to leave, and he immediately noticed that something was missing.\n\n\nCarly apologized for taking the angel, but she claimed that it had great sentimental value to her. Kenny said that it was still evidence. Jack entered and agreed. He asked Kenny to let him handle it, and Kenny left. Juggling the angel in her hands, Carly claimed that she'd just wanted to figure out what it weighed. \"I'd say about a pound,\" she estimated, dropping it. The angel shattered on the floor, and Jack gasped. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gabriel feels guilty for lying about Craig leaving him to die when Johnny tells him that he misses Craig and he wishes they could be a family. Liberty tells Gabriel not to feel guilty because Craig tried to kill him and he belongs in jail. Parker tells Gabriel to stay away from Liberty but later Gabriel tries to kiss Liberty and she backs away from him. Liberty tells Parker she doesn't have time to worry about him and Gabriel fighting over her because she needs to concentrate on school so she can graduate with her class because she owes that to her mom and dad after everything they have done for her. Parker promises Liberty he won't fight with Gabriel anymore and Liberty tells Parker she has missed being his friend and then they hug. Carly and Jack continue to argue because Jack won't let the case go and she fears that parker could end up in jail if Jack keeps trying to find out the truth about the fore. Parker interrupts their fight and is tired of them fighting about him but Jack and Carly tell him they always have spirited discussions about what is best for their children. Carly goes to the evidence room and almost steals the glass angel that used to be on her desk at the office. Jack catches her before she can leave and she not so accidentally drops the glass figurine on the floor and it breaks. Jack tells Craig that he believes his story and will do his best to prove it so that he can get out of jail. Craig warns Jack that Carly is toxic to any man and that loving her made him do things that he didn't want to do. Craig tells Jack that Carly will make him do things that are against his moral code and he should get away from her before she pushes him to the edge. Jack tells Craig that all of this is his fault and leaves because he doesn't want to hear anything else Craig has to say about Carly. Faith makes Lily realize that she should tell Holden how she feels before things get serious between Holden and Molly. Holden saves Molly from Silas and ties him to a chair. Holden goes to call the police from his phone that he left in his car while Silas taunts Molly. Silas tells Molly that she will be happy living a normal life with a boring farmer because she was born to be a cheap and dirty prostitute. Silas also tells Molly that when he gets out of jail after serving his time he will find her and force her to be his prostitute forever. Molly can't take anymore and shoots Silas who is dead when Holden returns from the car. Holden tells Molly to tell the police everything Silas did to her so that they will know she shot him in self defense. Holden and Molly return to the farm where Holden feels like he let Molly down because she felt she couldn't come to him and ask him for help with Silas. Holden wants to prove to Molly how much he loves her and that she can trust him so he proposes to her. Lily hears the proposal from the pirch since she was going to tell Holden how she feels about him.",
