Lily offered to call Holden for help, but Carly dissuaded her from calling after she flashed back on her intimate moment with him while they were horseback riding. It became obvious that the meat was never going to get cooked if the women did not have help, so they finally phoned Holden. He arrived with his girls and Lily invited him to stay and cook the burgers. Carly excused herself when it became apparent that Holden and Lily needed to talk privately. Holden told his wife he wanted them to be a family again, and Carly watched them embrace. \n\n\nLucinda found Luke at the harbor searching for Noah and introduced her grandson to the real Ben Coyle. The man they thought was Coyle turned out be an imposter in Colonel Mayer's employ. Luke refused to leave the dock until he found Noah. Coyle notified the Port Authority who said that Mayer's boat had not yet left the harbor. Lucinda and Luke boarded the authorities' boat and refused to get off, so the government agents got on board and the boat shoved off. \n\n\nOn Mayer's boat, the Colonel roughed up the imposter Coyle as they discussed how to get out of the marina without identifying every passenger as the Port Authority required. Noah hid under a table and overheard their conversation. When Mayer got rough with Ameera, Noah revealed himself and challenged his father. Colonel Mayer told Noah there was a political group in Iraq very interested in the girl's return. He also cautioned Noah that the boy didn't know Ameera as well as he thought he did. Noah urged his father not to go back to Iraq but to let the girl go and to turn himself in to the authorities. \n\n\nAlison and Aaron met with Bonnie McKechnie about the possibility of filing suit against Memorial Hospital because of the actions of Dr. Chris Hughes. Alison felt at first that Bonnie was not sympathetic to her cause, however. Aaron finally convinced Bonnie that she was doing the right thing and then he left so that Alison and Bonnie could talk privately. \n\n\nAlison told Bonnie the facts, including that she had almost slept with Chris but had bailed on him. Bonnie cautioned her client that if she wanted to be a nurse at Memorial, filing the lawsuit could be detrimental to her career. \n\n\nChris met with Tom Hughes and gave his side of the dispute with Alison. Chris' story was strongly slanted in his favor, although he did admit that he had told Brenda, the director of the nursing program, to \"use her own judgment\" in the case of releasing or retaining Alison Stewart as a student. Tom recommended including Dr. Bob in their discussion and called and asked him to join them. Tom played devil's advocate with Chris until Bob arrived. Tom received a call from Bonnie who notified him that Alison was now suing both Memorial Hospital and Dr. Chris Hughes. Bob chastised his son for making a bad situation worse. He volunteered to do some damage control with Lisa. \n\n\nAt the Snyder's barbeque, Lily told Carly how happy she was that she and Holden were keeping their marriage going. Holden cooked the hamburgers, and Lily decided to take Ethan home since he was running a slight fever. That left Holden and Carly alone with the children. The girls went to play on the swings and Holden and Carly tackled the dirty dishes. This led to a soapsuds battle between them that left Holden with a very wet shirt. He finally took his girls home, where Lily questioned the wet shirt. She made Holden take it off so that she could get him a dry one. \n\n\nDr. Bob approached Lisa about her having a chat with her goddaughter, Bonnie, about Alison's law suit. Lisa followed through by talking with Bonnie and explaining how devastating such a suit would be for the families involved. \n\n\nAaron met Alison as she was arriving at the hospital for her shift and promised he would not let Chris hurt her any more. As Alison was in the locker room putting away her belongings, Chris surprised her. The two of them argued, and Chris warned her that if she pursued the lawsuit, the lawyers would be bringing up all of Alison's sordid past, including her performance in porn movies. \n\n\nBack in New York Harbor, the Port Authority boat approached Colonel Mayer's boat and asked him to surrender. Mayer immediately jumped overboard and disappeared. The authorities came on board and took Ameera into custody over Noah's protests. The police were hoping she could tell them the Colonel's plans. Noah turned on Luke with harsh words for showing up with the authorities. Then he promised Ameera he would get her out of the situation. Luke was obviously disappointed and felt betrayed. \n\n\nAlison left her shift early because she was so upset and found Aaron. She told him what Chris had said about her past, and the couple went to confer with Bonnie. They were encouraged by Bonnie's advice that Chris had damaged his own case by confronting Alison in the locker room. \n\n\nBob scolded Chris about his even having a discussion with Alison after he had been cautioned to stay away from her. Bob called Tom to come to the hospital for some strategy planning, and Tom, too, warned Chris to stay as far away from Alison as possible. Tom then took a call from Bonnie, who was threatening to add charges if Chris continued to harass her client. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Sage presented her mother with a drawing of Holden with a sopping wet shirt, riding his horse. Carly displayed the picture in her kitchen and smiled.\n\n\n",
