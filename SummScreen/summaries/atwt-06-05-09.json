Holden returned home and told them that although the police were putting up roadblocks all over Wisconsin, no one had seen Eliza and Paul yet. Holden said the lead appeared to have gone cold. Damian thought that Paul couldn't keep running with the baby forever without a network in place to help him stay hidden, and Lily agreed, saying a man traveling alone with a baby would stand out. \n\n\nHolden noticed that Damian had gotten his appetite back, so he asked Damian if that meant he would be leaving soon. Damian headed out, but Meg stopped him on the patio and thanked him for all of his help. She gave him a hug as Holden watched from inside the house. \n\n\nJack went to the Lakeview and told Barbara he wanted to tap her phone, in case Paul tried to contact her again. Barbara refused to give Jack her consent. Jack thought that meant that Barbara expected to hear from Paul soon, but Barbara said she was refusing to agree to a wiretap because she didn't expect to hear from Paul and didn't want the police listening to her private conversations. Jack told Barbara that if he found out later that she had lied to him, he would go after her, too. \n\n\nPaul and Rosanna woke up after having spent the night in the back room of a diner in Wisconsin. Paul gave Eliza a bottle of formula and then groaned as he stood up. His back hurt after his night spent sleeping on the hard floor. Rosanna gave Paul a neck and back rub that helped relieve his pain, and she asked Paul what their next move would be. Paul said he didn't know where he and Eliza would go, but he didn't want Rosanna to accompany them, because he didn't want Rosanna to get caught by the police. \n\n\nRosanna told Paul they should eat breakfast before they made any decisions about what to do next. Paul said he thought he did better when he improvised than when he tried to make plans, but he agreed to eat breakfast before leaving. The owner of the diner, Mr. Kent, gave Paul and Rosanna a big breakfast and then told Paul that he used to be a mechanic and had fixed Paul's car. Paul asked what they could do for Mr. Kent in return, and Mr. Kent said he wanted Rosanna to sing at the diner that evening. Paul said Rosanna couldn't do that, but Mr. Kent explained that he had already printed and distributed flyers announcing the event. Rosanna told Mr. Kent that she would be delighted to sing again, and he walked away. \n\n\nRosanna told Paul she hadn't wanted to get into an argument with Mr. Kent. She thought that she and Paul needed to hurry up and leave town. Paul thought he might head for Canada. He said he would get the car packed and leave while Rosanna kept Mr. Kent occupied. Rosanna wanted to accompany him and the baby; Paul, however, thought Rosanna should return to the farm. Rosanna said Paul needed someone to take care of Eliza, because Paul would have to get a job to support himself and the baby. Paul said he would find someone to do that, and he told Rosanna to \"stay disappeared.\" \n\n\nRosanna watched as Paul buckled Eliza's car seat into the car. He apologized for leaving Rosanna in town, away from the farm where she'd been living. Rosanna said she would find her way back, although she wasn't sure Edna would allow her to continue living and working on the farm. However, Rosanna said that might not be a bad thing, because she'd been running from her life and needed to decide what she really wanted to do with it. Paul told her that whatever it was, he hoped she would be happy. \n\n\nRosanna again encouraged Paul to simply take Eliza back to Oakdale, but Paul said he couldn't do that. Rosanna bent down to say goodbye to Eliza, and then she told Paul, \"That child deserves to be happy.\" Paul said he wouldn't let anything happen to Eliza, but Rosanna said, \"It's kind of too late, Paul. You already happened.\" \n\n\nBonnie woke up in her motel room and found Dusty sitting up in the bed next to her, dozing. She accused Dusty of taking advantage of her, but Dusty replied that he'd been taking care of her, because she'd been vomiting. He then told her that he felt that Paul was still very close, and he didn't want the trail to get cold. Bonnie reluctantly told Dusty that she appreciated whatever he'd done for her the night before. \n\n\nAfter Bonnie was ready to leave, she told Dusty that she was starving and needed to get something to eat. The motel manager recommended a diner north of town, and he handed Dusty a flyer, saying the diner was having live music later that day. Dusty said they just wanted food, and he took the flyer without looking at it. \n\n\nDusty and Bonnie went to the diner, and as they looked for someone to take their order, Rosanna walked in. Dusty called her name, but Rosanna put on a phony Southern accent and informed him that she wasn't Rosanna. However, Mr. Kent spotted her and called out her name. \n\n\nDusty and Bonnie asked her why she had lied to them and what she was doing there. Rosanna explained that she had awakened from her coma and returned to the United States. She said she had wanted to start her life over, so she hadn't gone back to Oakdale. Rosanna said she was on her way to Detroit for a meeting concerning her company's bankruptcy. \n\n\nDusty asked whether Rosanna had seen Paul Ryan and a baby, but Rosanna played dumb and insisted she hadn't seen Paul or Eliza. She also said Paul was one of the reasons she hadn't wanted to return to Oakdale, and Bonnie said she couldn't blame Rosanna for that. Rosanna said it was nice to see them, and then she walked away. Bonnie remarked that Rosanna apparently knew where Paul and Eliza were, and Dusty agreed. They followed her out of the diner and stopped her before she could leave. \n\n\nRosanna finally admitted that she had seen Paul and Eliza and had arrived in town with them, but she said Paul had left that morning, and she didn't know where he was headed. Dusty reminded Rosanna that she had tried to help Jennifer get Johnny back; he told Rosanna that the situation with Paul was similar, and Rosanna could help Meg get her baby back. Rosanna broke down and admitted that Paul had said he was headed for Canada, and she said he hadn't been gone long. Rosanna also told Dusty that she thought she had gotten through to Paul when she had tried to convince him to take Eliza back to Oakdale. She thought if Dusty and Bonnie went after Paul, they would scare him into going back on the run. \n\n\nBonnie and Dusty weren't sure they could believe Rosanna, and they were concerned she might be pointing them in the wrong direction. They decided to force her to return to Oakdale with them to tell the police what she knew about Paul and Eliza. \n\n\nPaul went to a pay phone and called his mother. Barbara urged Paul to bring Eliza back to Oakdale. Paul said he would do that, but only if Meg would agree to say that she had let Paul take Eliza on a trip out of state. Barbara pointed out that the police wouldn't believe that story, given that Meg had contacted them to ask them to hunt for Paul and the baby, but Paul said if Meg stuck to that story and refused to press charges, he could stay out of jail. Paul gave Barbara the number of the pay phone and told her to have Meg call him within the hour to let him know she had agreed to his terms, or no one would ever see him or Eliza again. \n\n\nPaul hung up, and Barbara called Meg's cell phone. Meg had gone to wash up at Lily's, so Holden picked up the cell phone when it rang. Barbara hung up when she heard Holden's voice. Holden told Lily the phone number had been blocked on the caller ID, so he didn't know who had called. \n\n\nBarbara saw Damian in the lobby of the Lakeview Hotel and asked him to help her reach Meg. Damian said he needed a reason to do that, because he wasn't sure he could trust Barbara not to do something that would end up hurting Meg. Barbara told Damian that she knew something that might help bring Eliza back to Meg, but she needed to talk to Meg about it directly. Barbara convinced Damian to help her, so he called Lily's cell phone and asked her to bring Meg to the Lakeview without letting Holden know what she was doing. Lily asked if he was sure, and Damian replied that he was. \n\n\nLily hung up and told Holden that there was a mix-up about the right color paint for the guest bedroom, and she needed to straighten it out. She said she might ask Meg to accompany her, to get Meg's opinion, and Holden thought that was a good idea, because Meg needed to get out of the house. When Meg entered the room, Lily asked her if she wanted to go to the mall, to spare Holden from having to accompany Lily. Meg reluctantly agreed. \n\n\nLily took Meg to the Lakeview, where Barbara took her aside. Barbara explained what Paul wanted. Meg couldn't believe that Paul had agreed to return Eliza, and she asked Barbara when it might happen. Barbara said Paul could bring the baby home that day, because he was only a couple of hours away. Meg wasn't sure that agreeing to Paul's demand would keep Paul out of jail. Barbara told Meg that Paul wanted to hear directly from Meg that Meg had agreed to testify on his behalf, and she told Meg that she knew how to reach Paul. \n\n\nMeg called the pay phone number, and Paul answered. When Paul reiterated his demand that Meg testify that she had agreed to let Paul take Eliza out of town, Meg said she didn't think the police would believe it. Paul told Meg he wanted a sworn, notarized affidavit before he would bring Eliza back, and he told her to get one typed up, leave one copy with his mother, and then bring one copy to him when she went to pick up Eliza. Meg agreed but said Paul needed to bring Eliza to her at the police station. Paul agreed to that and told Meg to tell Barbara to call him back in an hour to read Meg's statement to him. They hung up, and Meg told Barbara that they needed to find a lawyer quickly. \n\n\nBarbara and Meg returned to the lobby after getting the affidavit that Paul had demanded. They told Lily and Damian what was happening, and Barbara went upstairs to let Paul know that Meg had done as he had asked. Lily returned home to let Holden know what had happened, while Damian went with Meg to the police station. \n\n\nLily tried to explain to Holden that she had lied to him because Paul had said he didn't want anyone else, including Holden, to know that he was trying to reach Meg. Holden became angry, saying that Lily could have told him what was happening, but had chosen not to do so. Holden wondered why anyone should believe Paul when Paul said he would bring the baby back, but Lily said that it had been Paul's idea in the first place. Holden asked if Meg was at the police station alone, but Lily said Damian was with her. Holden said he wouldn't be surprised if the whole idea had been Damian's in the first place; Lily said it was Paul's idea, but Holden asked why he should believe her. \n\n\nAt the police station, Meg told Jack that she had spoken to Paul, and that Paul was on his way back to Oakdale with Eliza. When Jack asked what had happened, Meg explained the situation. Jack was upset that Meg had agreed to Paul's terms, but Damian pointed out that the important thing was for Meg to get her baby back. \n\n\nAs they discussed the situation, Paul walked in, carrying Eliza. Meg was ecstatic to see her daughter, and she asked if she could hold the baby. Paul handed Eliza to her, and Jack told an officer to arrest Paul. Meg handed Jack an envelope and told him that it contained a sworn affidavit saying she had agreed to let Paul take Eliza out of town. \n\n\nPaul then asked if he could say goodbye to Eliza. He kissed his daughter on the head tenderly and told Meg to take good care of her. Paul asked Jack if they were done, and Jack said, \"For now.\" As Paul turned to leave, Dusty and Bonnie walked in with Rosanna. Rosanna said, \"You brought her back!\" Dusty demanded to know why Paul wasn't in handcuffs, and Jack told him to talk to Meg about that. Meg told Dusty that it was over, but Dusty said, \"Oh, no, it's not!\"\n\n\n",
