After Katie and Hal leave, Molly calls Mike on his cell phone and asks him to meet her right away at the Lakeview.  Mike runs interference first, but then agrees to meet her when she says she has info about Carly's whereabouts.\n\n\nJack knocks on the door of the country home where Carly has been living for the past few days.  After no one answers, he walks into the unlocked house.  He looks around and calls out for his wife, but silence responds.  He finds his way to a table, discovers Carly's wedding rings, and whispers, \"I'm too late.\"  Just then, Carly walks through the door, sees Jack, and gladly asks, \"Is Parker OK?\"  Jack says he's fine.  She assures him that everything is fine with her.  Jack wants to know why she left and explains that everyone was worried about her since they didn't find her note until yesterday.  She says she left because she needed to clear her head.  The tone of the conversation deteriorates from there and they end up arguing.  She tells him to just go back home.  Jack holds up her wedding rings and asks if he should take them with him.  She explains that she took them off because her fingers are swollen.  \"It happens when you're pregnant Jack!\"  She tells him if all he wants to do is be mad, then he can go home.  \"I'll drop ya a line when she's born!\"  She slams a bedroom door, leaving him alone.  Later, Carly comes out and asks Jack why he's still there.  He tells her he's been through hell recently.  He thought the dead person they found was she, and while they waited to confirm who was wrapped in the trash bags, he realized how much he loved her.  He also says, that no matter what DNA the baby has, the baby will be his to care for and love as his own.  He sums it all up, \"I'm an empty man without you.\"  Carly's heart skips a beat, and she jumps into his arms.  He pulls out her wedding rings, tied to a string, and hangs it as a necklace around her neck.  Carly says, \"And so we start over...again.\"  Jack says, \"No...we pick up where we left off.\"\n\n\nRosanna waltzes into Fairwinds looking for Craig after spending her final night in prison.  He comes in from the gazebo and welcomes his wife with the good news that Carly is alive and has been found.  Rosanna is disturbed to hear that Craig neglected to fill her in about this sooner and get her out of jail the night before.  Craig defends himself by saying he didn't have time to get her up to speed because he was too busy trying to get her out of prison by talking with the DA all night long.  He says, \"I'd appreciate a kiss hello.  And a thank-you-nibble would be nice.\"  Rosanna doesn't bite and turns to leave.  He gingerly proposes the idea of getting remarried.  She wonders when this might happen.  He says that Aaron and Lucy are helping make arrangements to hold a ceremony today.  Rosanna says, \"And you're assuming I would want to marry you again...?\"  He somehow softens her heart, and she agrees to an afternoon wedding.  After she meanders out of the living room, Craig immediately calls Lucy and tells her he needs her help ASAP.\n\n\nDusty, Rose, Margo, and a detective wait by the phone for a ransom call.  Rose paces nervously back and forth until the phone finally rings.  A masked voice quickly says the price to get Lily back alive will be $10 million.  Lucinda stops by a little later and Margo plays the recorded ransom message.  Lucinda blinks, then immediately makes her way to her banker.  Rose wants to tell Margo about Spangler, but Dusty gets her to keep quiet.  He puts on his jacket and leaves to have a one on one meeting with his old boss.\n\n\nAlison flaunts her date later tonight with Gordo in front of Chris, but he doesn't seem to care.  She turns and heads for the elevator.  Her mother walks off and confronts her daughter about going on a date with a much older boy.  Alison dismisses her mothers concern and walks away.\n\n\nAfter interviewing Katie, Hal meets with Dr.'s Dixon & Hughes, as well as the new forensic pathologist.  He scolds Dr. Hughes for not informing the police sooner about the recent slew of questionable deaths at the hospital.  Bob says he only wanted to complete his own internal investigation before getting the police involved.  The forensic pathologist confirms that Nurse Krebs was most likely murdered.\n\n\nKatie runs into Chris and he tells her Mike had to leave, but he left her a message.  He wants her to meet him at the Lakeview, and she should be prepared, because he may need rescuing.  \n\n\nIn the gazebo, Craig barks at the arrangers scuffling about trying to throw together a last-second wedding.  Lucy helps to fluff the flowers, and advises her father that Aaron (the Best Man) is in the house keeping tabs on Rosanna.  Meanwhile, in the house, Rosanna gingerly walks unnoticed through the living room, places a note to Craig on a table, and then is caught trying to escape by Aaron.  Against his better judgment, he pleads with her to give Craig another chance.  Aaron says that if Craig is willing to let him be his best man, he definitely will do anything to keep Rosanna around.  She relents, and goes back to her room to get changed.  Craig is just within earshot of most of the exchange, and later thanks Aaron for his support.  \n\n\nA short time later, Rosanna trudges up to the altar wearing all black. The minister begins the ceremony, but Rosanna interrupts him with her own vows, \"I Rosanna, am putting you, my darling Craig, on notice.  I am no blushing bride.  I am no easy mark.  I am on to you.  And if you ever try to pull this on me again, ever, this will be your last wedding...before your funeral.\"  Craig joyously smirks.  Rosanna tells the minister it's now the groom's turn.  Craig gleefully plays right along, \"Absolutely.  I will keep my promise, to take you on the ride of your life.  To keep you guessing.  To try your patience.  And I will test your limits.  I promise you a bumpy ride full of chaos.  Rosanna, I give you all of me.\"  He turns to the minister and tells him to do his worst.  He starts to waffle, when Rosanna steps in, \"Oh for God's sake, I hear by pronounce us Rosanna and Craig!\"  Craig adds, \"I dare ya to stay with me \u2018till death do us part.\"  Rosanna says, \"You're on Montgomery!\"  He takes her in his arms and kisses his wife, as the minister sighs.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Molly tells Mike that Carly was found in Montana, and that Jack went after her.  Mike gets the same idea in his head.  Molly tries to discourage him.  She then tries to explain away one of her many recent indiscretions, but Mike isn't ready to hear it.  Katie arrives just in time, and Molly excuses herself.  Mike confides to Katie that he's worried about Carly and the baby, and that he wants to go out there to check on them.  He hem's and haw's until he finally asks Katie to join him on the trip.  Before Katie decides, she wants to know what it means if she goes with him.  He says it only means that they're friends.  She breathes a sigh of relief and they head for the airport.\n\n\nSusan stops by Hal's and runs into Alison holding a bunch of Emily's clothes.  Susan wants to know what her daughter is up to.  Ali says they're clothes for her date with Gordo.  Susan forbids her to date a guy as old as he is, but Alison says that a guy her own age might try to be sexually active with her also.  Besides, she assures her mother she doesn't want to have sex with someone she barely knows.  \"I can handle one simple little date.  I just want to go out with someone who thinks I look nice.\"  Susan gives up and decides to take her daughter shopping.\n\n\nAlison arrives in the hospital beautifully dressed, and conveniently runs into Chris while looking for Gordo.  Chris' tongue drops to the ground as he sizes up the cleaned up Alison walk away down the hall.\n\n\nCraig carries Rosanna into the living room, and they begin to consummate their marriage.\n\n\nMolly runs into Margo and she tells Margo how Dusty coned her out of a lot of money.  Margo gets suspicious that he might be up to the same thing with Lily, and she asks Rose where Dusty went.  Rose clams up, but secretly hopes he comes back soon.\n\n\nThe forensic pathologist confides to Hal that he thinks a serial killer is on the loose at Memorial.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is working at the Nurses' Station since the hospital was short-staffed. Mike asks Katie if she wants him to wait so he can bring her home. She says yes, and while he's waiting, Mike gets a phone call from Molly, who says she has news about Carly. Mike goes to meet Molly and tells Chris on his way out to tell Katie to meet him there in case he needs rescuing. Katie arrives just in time, but not before Molly tells Mike that Carly is in Muscle Shells and Jack is on his way there. Molly leaves at the sight of Katie. Mike invites Katie to go to Montana with him. Jack arrives in Montana and enters the cabin Carly was staying in. He calls out and looks around, but he only finds her wedding rings. Carly opens the door and is shocked to see Jack there. He informs her that he just received her letter the night before. The two talk for a while and end up patching things up. Rose is worried about her twin sister, Lily. When suddenly, a phone call comes in. Rose's phone is tapped by the police. The call is from the kidnapper who demands ten million dollars in unmarked bills if they ever want to see Lily again. When Mrs. Welsh hears the recorded tape, she announces she's going to the bank, even though Margo advises her not to. Molly shows and tells Margo about the scheme Dusty had and says she also believes he has something to do with the kidnapping. Margo goes to confront Dusty, but he already left. Roseanna believes Carly is expecting Craig to go meet her in Montana when Craig tells Roseanna Carly has been found. He also says he wants to remarry her today, in one hour. Roseanna agrees after some persuading from Aaron. They get married, sort of. Roseanna was impatient. She and Craig basically performed their own wedding. Chris wants to talk to Alison but she says she can't because she has a date. Alison has rooted through her sister's closet but her mother catches her with the clothes and says they are \"too mature\" for a girl her age. Her mother clearly does not want her dating Gordo. Alison however pleads her case by saying Rick is too young for her mother. Her mother agrees to let her go on the date but to wear something more appropriate for a girl her age. Alison shows up later at the hospital looking absolutely gorgeous. Chris is stunned by the sight of her. Gordo appears in a suit and tie and the two proceed with their date.",
