    "tvmega_recap": "It is graduation day at Oakdale High; Margo tells Casey she and Tom are allowing him to attend the University of Wisconsin in the fall again, but he declines wanting to stay at home and go to Oakdale U, which thrills Maddie when she overhears this. Will continues to avoid telling anyone the truth about not being allowed to graduate. When he misses the morning meeting with his principal, he is expelled. He still can't bring himself to tell Hal, Barbara or most importantly Gwen, who continues to heap praise upon him for graduating and doing so well the final couple weeks of school. Barbara presents him with his trust fund, and is extremely nice to Gwen. Hal's best friend from the police academy is shot and is in ICU, so Will coaxes Hal into going there since he wants less people around when he has to admit about not being able to graduate. Jade offers to help him out of this jam by suggesting blackmail, but Will decides to finally come clean. Jen is upset when she sees Lucy is observing Johnny's appointment. Lucy puts her two cents worth in when Jen has issues about Johnny's vaccinations, which really upsets Jen, who tells her that she shouldn't be involved in his case. Katie has a nightmare; Mike continues to keep her at a distance, as she tries to reach out to him. Mike wants to make arrangements for Nick alone. Katie shows up at the hospital later because he forgot his insurance card, and Mike lights into her about doing as he asked. He cuts himself off before he tells her he blames her for Nick's death, but Katie is devastated by how deep this goes with Mike. Jen tells Dusty about what happened with Lucy and how uncomfortable she is with Lucy's access to Johnny. Dusty tells her he got word Craig is trying to block him from adopting Johnny. Dusty promises that Jessica is working to stop him, but Jen can't help but wonder if Lucy was sent there by Craig to try to insinuate she is an unfit parent or maybe Lucy is thinking of taking Johnny away to raise him for her dad? Dusty promises to get to the bottom of this. He later confronts Lucy and tells her to stay away from Jen and their baby! When Will shows up at the graduation to talk to Gwen, and everyone is fussing over him to get his cap and gown on, they are stunned when the principal approaches him and tells him to get off the property since he was expelled for cheating.",
