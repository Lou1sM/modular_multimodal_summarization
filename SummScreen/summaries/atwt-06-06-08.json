Holden had invited Jack to join them without telling Carly, and while Sage was excited to see her father, Carly appeared to be disappointed. After Sage got used to her horse, Angie, she asked Holden if she could ride without him holding onto the reins. Carly asked which horse she should ride, and Holden said she and Jack could decide that. Carly was surprised that Holden wasn't going to be the one taking Sage and her on a ride, but Holden said Jack knew the trails, too, and he thought Sage would enjoy it more if her dad went with her. \n\n\nJack and Carly took Sage for a ride, and Jack, noting that Carly appeared to be distracted, assumed Carly was beginning to get qualms about Sage going to sleep-away camp. Carly admitted as much, and when the ride was over, she asked Jack to take Sage home while she went to thank Holden for setting everything up for them. \n\n\nAt the farmhouse, Carly asked Holden why he had gone to such great lengths to distance himself from her. She asked him what he was afraid of, and Holden replied, \"I think you know the answer to that.\" Jack walked in and asked what was going on. Carly said the riding lessons had been intended to be kept secret so that Jack would be surprised when he found out Sage knew how to ride. Holden apologized for having stirred things up, and he rushed off to take care of the horses. Jack told Carly not to blame Holden for not keeping their secret. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, as Paul was giving Meg a foot rub, Margo came in and told Paul that Sofie had claimed that Paul had raped her. Paul denied it, and both he and Meg told Margo that Sofie was delusional. \n\n\nMike accompanied Sofie to the Oakdale Police Department, where Sofie told the officer she wanted to report a crime. Margo received a call saying Sofie was at the station, so she, Paul, and Meg went to the station together. There, Margo told Sofie she would need to speak with her privately. In the interrogation room, Sofie claimed Paul had raped her after she had turned away his advances. When Margo told Sofie that Paul had said Sofie was making up the rape charge, Sofie handed Margo a plastic bag that contained a pair of her panties and said, \"These will prove it.\" \n\n\nIn the waiting area, Paul accused Mike of having convinced Sofie to come forward with the rape story. Mike told Paul he thought Paul had taken advantage of Sofie because Paul had given Sofie financial backing for her business and thought Sofie owed him something in return. Paul told Mike that Sofie had made the whole thing up and that Mike was \"a stupid idiot\" for believing her. \n\n\nMeg went to see Barbara to let her know what was happening. Barbara was horrified to learn what Sofie was doing. Barbara mentioned that Sofie had put her youngest son, Will, through hell and had apparently moved on to her other son, Paul. Barbara told Meg that Sofie was \"unbalanced and desperately needy, a very dangerous combination.\" \n\n\nBarbara went to the station with Meg and warned Paul that Margo would be biased in favor of Sofie because Margo herself had been a victim of rape. Paul said he would be careful. Meg took Mike aside and asked if helping Sofie was his way of getting back at Paul; Mike said no and that Meg apparently didn't know him very well. Margo told Paul that Sofie had made a formal accusation of rape, and Margo was going to run a DNA test. Paul agreed to let the police take a sample of his DNA for testing, because he was convinced Sofie had no evidence. \n\n\nWhen Margo received the results of the preliminary DNA test, she called all of the parties back to the station to announce the results. The testing put Paul within the suspect group. After Sofie said she stood by her story, Margo placed Paul under arrest. Barbara said she would get an attorney for Paul so he wouldn't have to spend the night in jail, and then she told Sofie, \"When the truth comes out, you're going to have to answer to me!\" Barbara left to hire an attorney for Paul. Meg then asked Sofie how she could do something like that to someone she had claimed to love. Sofie said that after she'd met Cole, she had lost her ability to stand up for herself, and she had let Cole hurt her over and over again. Sofie said, \"I'm not gonna let anybody use me and then throw me out. I'm never gonna do that again.\" Sofie left, and Meg pointed out to Mike that Sofie's words indicated she was merely a woman scorned, not a rape victim. \n\n\nPaul posted bail and was released from jail. Meg told him they would fight the rape charge and prove that Sofie was lying. Paul said Sofie must have had some practice lying, and Meg agreed and pointed out that they knew very little about Sofie's background and her past. Meanwhile, at Sofie's room, Sofie opened the door to find Cole standing there. Cole said, \"Hey, Sof! Long time, no see!\" \n\n\nAt the Hughes house, Daniel arrived with Emily, excited about an imminent trip to New York City with his brother, Casey, and his dad, Tom. Tom walked in and told his sons that something had come up at Memorial Hospital, and he would need to stay in town to help his father with it, so he was not going to be able to take them to New York after all. Tom said the only way they could still go would be if Emily were able to take them on short notice. Casey immediately said no, and he offered to take Daniel by himself, but neither Tom nor Emily liked that idea. Instead, Emily agreed to go with Daniel and Casey. \n\n\nWhen Emily and Casey were alone together, Casey told Emily he couldn't go to New York with her. Emily told Casey he had to go, or he would have a lot of explaining to do to Tom and Daniel. Emily said situations like the present one were going to come up all the time because their families were connected, so they would just have to get used to it and try to act normal around one another. Casey said normal for him was throwing Emily down on the couch, but Emily said the more they practiced acting \"normal,\" the easier it would become. \n\n\nTom came back into the room, and Emily said she had to leave to pack some things. After Emily left, Tom asked Casey what was up with him and Emily, and Casey said it was just weird to be going to New York with his ex-boss. Tom said he was glad Casey and Emily weren't best friends or anything like that, because even though she was technically part of their family, Tom didn't want her around any more than necessary. \n\n\nIn New York, Emily and Casey took Daniel for a tour around the city and then had dinner. Afterward, Daniel met his friend and the friend's dad for a concert they were scheduled to see. When Daniel had gone, Emily told Casey that since he'd been so uncomfortable with the idea of spending the night in New York, she'd changed his return plane ticket so that he could leave that evening instead of the next day. Casey wondered how he was supposed to explain his early return to his parents, but Emily said he was a good liar and would think of something. Instead of leaving, however, Casey ended up back at Emily's hotel room, where he and Emily made love. \n\n\nDaniel came back from the concert earlier than Emily and Casey expected him to, and they rushed to remake the bed and pick up the room so Daniel wouldn't know what they'd been up to. Daniel came in and told them about the concert and then asked if they could order a movie to watch together on TV. Emily said yes, and Casey agreed to stay and watch the movie with them. Daniel fell asleep, and Emily took Casey out in the hallway, where she said she would take Casey's room next door, because she hadn't cancelled the reservation yet. Emily told Casey they had both taken a terrible risk, and she said she must be out of her mind. Casey kissed Emily repeatedly despite her objections and then broke away and went into the second room, leaving Emily speechless in the hallway.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
