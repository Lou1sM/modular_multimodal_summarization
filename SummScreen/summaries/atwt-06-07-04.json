Pilar tears herself away from eavesdropping on their conversation to answer her cell phone.  Russ is angry that there is an all points bulletin out for him because of the diversion he created at Pilar's request.  He demands that Pilar bring him some money immediately to the alley behind Yo's diner.  He warns her, \"If I go back in the joint, you're going to be my date!\"  By the time Mike comes back inside, Pilar has finished packing.  Mike insists that Pilar tell  him where she was the night before when she disappeared during the night.  Instead of answering, Pilar storms off, asking Mike, \"How can you expect me to stay with you when you obviously don't believe a word out of my mouth?\"  She goes directly to meet Russ, tells him that she has money coming soon, and asks him not to give up after they have come so far.  Unbeknownst to them, Simon overhears every word of their conversation.  After Russ leaves, promising to go to the police if Pilar doesn't get money to him that very night, Simon comes out from hiding and grabs Pilar, telling her, \"You're in a hell of a lot of trouble.\"  Surprisingly, Pilar spits back, \"Whose fault is that?  It's about time you showed up!\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Katie's house, Henry tells Margo his theory that Pilar robbed him and Katie for money to give Russ.  Margo tells both of them that she now believes Katie, and they hug before Margo and Henry leave.  Mike comes to the door soon afterward and tells Katie that he has been wrong about everything.\n\n\nPaul and Barbara ask the Mother Superior for information on Annie Weatherby, who worked at the orphanage when Jordan Sinclair was there.  Paul and Barbara are distressed to find no records on Jordan, and Paul begs the nun for help , telling her that Jordan might be his brother.  The Mother Superior leaves Paul and Barbara in her office after telling them that she could never hand over a birth certificate without permission.  However, as she walks out the door, she tells them that the certificates are filed by year of admission.  Alone in the office, Barbara and Paul find Jordan's birth certificate, issued in Buffalo, New York, and see that James is listed as Jordan's father.  However, the date is different from Paul's birth date, so they believe that Barbara could not be his mother.\n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Jordan meets Jennifer for coffee and apologizes that their first days of being in love have been tainted by his troubles.  They are interrupted by Detective Jack Snyder, who tells them that James Stenbeck is willing to talk to Jordan.  Although Jennifer offers to go along, Jordan insists that he wants to protect her from a man as dangerous as James.  The two declare their love for each other before Jordan leaves with Jack.  Back in Barbara's suite, Jennifer becomes frightened for Jordan and leaves him a message on his cell phone, asking him to be careful.  She imagines finding Jordan locked in James' cell, and herself locked in the room outside the cell.  At the prison, Jordan greets James, whose back is turned.\n\n\n",

Henry confides in Katie that he went to Margo with his theory that Pilar was the one who stole the jewelry. Katie is afraid that this will put her between Mike and Pilar again. Meanwhile, Margo arrives at Mikes right after a drunken Russ leaves. As Margo tells Mike about the robbery, it is obvious that Pilar did in fact steal the jewelry. Although Pilar professes to be innocent, Margo privately tells Mike that she is beginning to think she has been wrong about Pilar all along. Later, Mike comes to Katie to say he thinks hes been wrong about everything. Meanwhile, after some investigating, Simon gets information on who pawned the jewelry and gets the jewelry back.

She and Henry discuss the possibility that Pilar stole it to get bail money for Russ. Simon meets with Claudine who is obviously someone he's worked with before. He offers to buy the jewelry back, his associate surprised at the wad of money he produces to do so. Meanwhile Russ continues his tirade against Pilar and when Mike goes to chase him, Pilar holds him back. Margo shows up and has some interesting questions for Mike's guest, Pilar becoming nervous. When Mike takes Margo out, Pilar receives a phone call from Russ who's holed up behind Yo's, since the police are now after him. She tells him to hold fast and she'll get him the money she owes him. Meeting Russ in the alley, he again threatens to rat her out unless she gets him his money and she promises it will be the next day.
