Celia believed that Casey was hurt because of her, and she wanted to take care of him. Margo found Gwen and Will and invited them to join the party. Unbeknownst to Margo, Gwen had just told Will that she was pregnant with Casey's baby -- Margo's grandchild. \n\n\nWill wasn't sure if he believed Gwen but told her that if it really was Casey's, she had to tell him. Gwen told him she had tried, but he wouldn't talk to her. At the prom party, Casey told Celia that he loved her. She said she loved him, but she was actually thinking of Will when she said it.\n\n\nRosanna tried to convince Paul that she really loved him and that it was James who had made her break up with Paul. He told Rosanna that he could almost believe her except that she had shown up with Craig. Her story of how Craig had saved her life in Bangkok just didn't wash -- and neither did anything else she said about James and Cabot. Rosanna continued to plead with him and even kissed him. He kissed her back.\n\n\nHal was angry that Emily wanted to press charges against Rosanna. He even told her that he wouldn't allow it. Emily was furious and hurt, but so was Hal. Hal asked her why she always seemed to need another man in her life and reminded her of her relationship with Chris Hughes. Emily asked him why she was always the last priority in his life -- why she was an afterthought. Emily told him that she would stay with her mother for a while but assured Hal that she would press charges against Rosanna. Hal asked her if she was doing that for her or for Paul.\n\n\nEmily went to tell Paul that they could not get any help from Hal, but she walked in on Rosanna and Paul kissing. She was obviously upset to see them kissing and told Rosanna that she was going to press charges. Rosanna left, and Emily tried to get close to Paul. Paul even told her that she could stay with him, but Emily's mother called, and she decided to go to her mother's. \n\n\nLily had crashed on the side of the road, but a passing motorist saw her and called an ambulance. Ben examined her, and she seemed to be fine, but he realized that she thought someone had disabled the brakes in her car. He tried to convince her to call the police. She couldn't do it.\n\n\nJack and Carly had planned a movie date night, but duty called, and Jack had to cancel. Just as Carly was leaving the police station, Lily called and asked Carly to go to Lily's home, get the girls, and take them to Holden at the farm. Later, Lily went home to a dark house and was frightened when the doorbell rang. She was glad to see Carly at the door, and she told Carly all of her fears. She was afraid that Keith was involved in Julia's murder and thought that the man she had let into her heart was a murderer. \n\n\n Carly agreed to stay with Lily while she tried to get some rest. When Lily went upstairs, Carly picked up the phone to call Jack. Just as the Oakdale Police answered, the line went dead. Carly was worried and went for her cell phone. She was waiting for Jack to answer as the doorbell rang. She wasn't sure what to do, but then heard Jack's voice calling for Lily. She was relieved and started to walk toward the door -- but she didn't reach the door because someone wearing black gloves grabbed her from behind, covering her mouth.  \n\n\n",
