    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the evidence room at the Oakdale Police Station, Jack couldn't believe that Carly had destroyed evidence by dropping the glass angel paperweight that Gabriel had said was Craig's weapon against him at Monte Carlo.  \"Accidents happen,\" quipped Carly, with a cavalier attitude.  Jack was not amused, and he informed her that she had just broken the law.  Carly was only interested in protecting Parker, however.  The cop on duty returned and asked what had happened, but Jack covered for Carly and said he had fumbled the angel.\n\n\nCarly thanked Jack, but he replied that he couldn't \"do it anymore.\"  Jack said that Craig had called Carly \"toxic,\" and he was beginning to think Craig was right.  Then Jack changed his mind and said it was not just Carly who was toxic; it was the two of them together.  They drove home but were both on edge.  Carly said she had done what she had felt she had to do, but Jack said she always did, and that was the problem.  Carly accused him of not forgiving her for everything she had put him through over the years.\n\n\nThen Carly said that Jack needed to accept her as she was, and she realized that he had driven her home not to work things out, but to say \"goodbye.\"  Jack said that when Carly broke the evidence, it was as if she had shattered any hope he had of things changing.  Jack said he had to meet Janet for her ultrasound, and he opened the door.  Carly asked if she would see him later, but Jack walked out without answering.\n\n\nAt the farm, Holden comforted Molly after she shot and killed Silas Whitman at the Old Mill Restaurant.  He heard a car pull up and assumed it was the county sheriff, but instead their caller was Lily, who was arriving to tell Holden that she wanted him back.  Holden answered Lily's knock, and she burst through the doorway but was surprised to see Molly there in tears.  Lily asked if she was interrupting, but Holden spoke up and said he had just asked Molly to marry him.\n\n\nLily was stunned and asked what had happened.  When she got no answer, Lily wished them well and said she would wait and let them tell their news to Faith.  She walked out, almost in tears herself, as Holden pressed Molly for an answer to his proposal.  Molly said if she needed to answer right away, then it had to be \"no.\"  Molly went on to say that they both knew that Holden would not have proposed that night if it were not for the fact that Molly had killed Whitman.  She said it was not a good idea to be making plans for the rest of their lives while they were \"freaking out.\"\n\n\nMolly suggested that Holden felt guilty about not protecting her better, but what had happened was her own fault because she had taken a gun with her to the restaurant.  When Silas had threatened to expose their videos to the world, Molly had pulled the trigger to get rid of the problem.  Holden claimed that he loved her, and he knew that she loved him, too.  Molly wanted to talk to Carly about what had happened before she gave Holden an answer, so she left to go there, as Holden promised to destroy the videos.\n\n\nLily returned home, and Lucinda poured her a glass of wine.  She told her mother that Holden had proposed to Molly, and that blew Lucinda away.  She recovered, however, and said that a reporter friend had called and told her that Molly Conlan had shot and killed ex-Congressman Whitman that night.  Lucinda referred to it as \"the light at the end of the tunnel,\" but Lily failed to see how Whitman's death had anything to do with her getting back with Holden.  Lucinda's theory was that Holden had \"sympathy\" for Molly, but he truly loved Lily.  She suggested that Lily go back to the farm and tell her ex-husband how she felt, so at least he then had a choice.  Lily thanked her mother for her advice but then threw her out when Lucinda began talking trash about Molly again.\n\n\nMolly drove to Carly's and the two began to have a pity party.  Carly went first, but she realized her cousin was deeply upset, so she asked Molly for her story.  Molly first told Carly that Holden had asked her to marry him, but then she burst into tears, and cried that she had just killed a man.  Molly told Carly basically what had happened, but then she added the details and admitted that she had been able to send out an alarm to Holden.  She said Silas had said terrible things and had physically attacked her, but he was not actually a threat when she had decided she had enough and had pulled the trigger.  Molly questioned whether she deserved the love of a man like Holden.\n\n\nIn his jail cell, Craig did pushups and asked the guard for water.  When the guard ignored him, Craig reminded the guard that his sister was the chief of police.  He also asked to use the phone to call his five- year-old son, but the guard walked away.  More of Craig's threats fell on deaf ears.\n\n\nJanet went into Dusty's room at the Lakeview and found him on the phone, arguing.  Johnny's playgroup was going to the community pool the next day, but Johnny could not go without a signed consent form from his legal guardian.  Craig was the boy's guardian, but he was not eligible to grant permission while he was incarcerated, and he refused to give temporary guardianship to Dusty.  Dusty was seeing his dream of living with Janet in their big brick house with Liberty, Johnny, and the new baby fade.  He apologized for being in a foul mood, but Janet said she had to go for her sonogram, and she left.  Dusty called the jail and asked for an appointment to see Craig.\n\n\nThe guard took Craig to the interview room in handcuffs, but his visitor turned out to be Janet.  She announced that she was there to make sure that Craig did the right thing.  She asked how much he loved his son, and when Craig said that Johnny was his whole life, she asked why Craig didn't act like it.  She wanted him to explain why he didn't want Johnny to have fun with the other kids.  Craig denied that, but he said he was the boy's father.  \n\n\nJanet asked him to grant temporary guardianship to Dusty, so that he could sign the papers and take care of things while Craig was in custody.  \"No,\" shouted Craig, and Janet reminded him that he had already hurt Gabriel, and he didn't want to hurt Johnny, as well.  After Janet left, Craig hollered to go back to his cell, but instead Dusty walked in and asked why Craig was so willing to hurt his kid.  Dusty vented on Craig, and when he had finished, Craig said that Johnny would go swimming with the other \"rugrats\" because Dusty was his temporary guardian.\n\n\nAt Memorial, the technician called Janet in for her appointment, but Jack had not yet arrived, so Janet stalled for a few minutes.  She pulled out her phone to call him when Dusty walked up and offered to hold her hand.  He also told her that she was \"amazing\" for convincing Craig to do the right thing. Janet decided not to wait for Jack and invited Dusty to accompany her for the ultrasound.\n\n\nAfter the procedure, the technician took in the sonogram, but Janet asked her to put the photo in her file because she wanted to find out the sex of the baby at the same time as Jack.  Janet thanked Dusty, and he, in turn, thanked her again for being successful with Craig.  Dusty asked Janet to go out to dinner with him to celebrate her good news of a healthy baby, and he was pleased about his temporary guardianship of Johnny.\n\n\nJack was hurrying to leave the police station to get to the hospital for Janet when Holden rushed in.  Holden told his cousin that Molly had just shot and killed Silas Whitman, and they had both given the local sheriff their statements.  Jack asked Holden to start at the beginning, so the two went into the interview room.  Holden told Jack the details, and then he said he wanted the whole thing to \"go away quietly.\"  He asked Jack to talk to the sheriff about Whitman's stalking of Molly.  Then Jack attempted to get the timeline straight and learned that Molly had called Holden at one point and explained that Whitman was holding her hostage.  Jack promised he would minimize the damage as much as possible.\n\n\nAs the evening drew to a close, Craig lay on the bunk in his cell and looked at Johnny's drawing of their family.\n\n\nJanet and Dusty walked into his hotel room and kissed.\n\n\nJack had a lonely beer at Yo's and checked his phone for calls.\n\n\nCarly checked her phone and walked upstairs to bed alone.\n\n\nLily turned off the lights and looked at a photo of her and Holden.\n\n\nHolden drank a beer at the farm as Molly returned.  She walked over to him and smiled \"Yes\" to his proposal, and they kissed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lily is set to pour out her feelings to Holden, but she is stunned when she walks in on a strangely emotional conversation between Molly and Holden; she is told that he just asked her to marry him, as Lily excuses herself quickly after offering her congratulations. Holden claims he wants to marry Molly for the right reasons, but Molly thinks he just wants to make sure he doesn't have to testify against her; she has to think about this because she doesn't think it is right to get married for that reason in her mind; she needs to go talk with Carly. Dusty admits to Janet that he is struggling with handling Johnny's day to day care while Craig still has legal guardianship, which is causing an issue for Johnny going swimming and needing permission the next day. Janet goes to see Craig to appeal to him about Dusty's situation and doing the right thing for Johnny, as Craig finally hears her pleas. Dusty later comes to talk with Craig about the same thing and is surprised to hear Craig already agreed \u0096 thanks to Janet. Carly breaks evidence and Jack is in disbelief; he can't believe the lengths she will go and how she justifies her behavior; he sees that Craig is right \u0096 they are toxic together. Carly firmly believes she has to protect Parker at all costs, but Jack thinks she pushes things too far. Later, they talk and Carly and Jack are at an impasse regarding whom they are while Jack doesn't think it is possible for them to work and so he leaves. Molly visits Carly and tells her that she killed Silas right before Holden asked her to marry him. Carly is stunned to hear her story, but thinks Holden is doing everything in his power to protect her, so she discounts Molly's belief that it isn't a good way to start a marriage. Carly lends Molly her support. Holden goes to Jack for help for Molly with the Silas situation. Jack is shocked to learn the details, but he agrees to talk with the Sheriff and give him some background on Silas. Jack asks for the timeline, and Holden omits some information. Janet goes to have an ultrasound expecting to be with Jack. Dusty shows up and offers his support, as they learn the baby is healthy and they bond over her helping him with Craig and his being there for her during the appointment since Jack was not able. Lily bemoans her situation to Lucinda about Holden, as Lucinda pushes her further at Holden because of what she learned that night about Molly killing Silas. Lily is in disbelief, but she thinks that will bond Holden and Molly together further, as he protects her. She wants Lucinda to leave because her suggestions and advice are just hurting her. Craig yearns for his family with Johnny and Gabriel. Jack wants to call Carly but instead takes a drink from his beer sadly. Carly wants to hear from Jack, but decides not to push him and goes to bed alone. Lily, hugging a photo of her and Holden, wishes things were different with she and Holden. Holden worries and waits for Molly to come home; when she does, she tells him softly that her answer is yes, as they kiss.",
