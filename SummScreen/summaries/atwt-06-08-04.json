James starts to tell Jordan the story he has concocted about his past.  He tells him that he was closer to his Father than his Mother.  When Jordan asks questions about his Father, James tells him that the man who was his Father was a very complex man.  However, you have his curiosity and his ambition.  He and I wanted the same thing.  A son that loved him.  Jordan is feeling as though he wished his Father wasn't dead.  James gives Jordan the idea that perhaps his Father isn't dead.  As soon as Jordan hears this, he is wondering why his Father hasn't contacted him.  James says that he was just speaking rhetorically.  What he really meant was that sometimes someone who has meant so much lives within us, even when they are not here.  He asks Jordan if he is a good dancer.  When James finishes talking, Jordan tells him that no matter what, he didn't feel special, he felt alone.  James may have brought him to this place, to fulfill his destiny, but no thanks.

James calls him \"an ungrateful imbecile.\" \"You want your son, don't you?\" asks James, \" then you better damn well take what I'm offering you.  Jordan knows that James is threatening his son and tells him to rot in hell.  Jordan tells him that he will no longer allow him to tell him what to do, how to live or who to love, and, if you come anywhere near his son,  he will rip his heart out.  Jordan threatens to take James down if he tries anything.  James is overjoyed, thinking that his son has some spine.  Paul walks in, and hearing James calls Jordan, \"his son,\" thinks that Jordan knows.  Jordan is perplexed, and asks, Paul, \"What are you doing here?\"  Paul asks James if they planned this whole thing together.  Jordan is mystified.  He doesn't know what is going on.  Paul blasts James and then wants to know why he forced his son into their lives.  Jordan is knocked for a loop.  \"What are you talking about?\" says Jordan.  James apologizes to Jordan.  He tells him he didn't want him to find out this way but, he is his Father.\n\n\nMike is at Katie's house.
