All of a sudden, someone grabbed Carly from behind and dragged her upstairs to the attic. Carly screamed for Lily, but then the person that was holding her captive gagged her and locked her in a trunk. Lily, having heard Carly call her name, tried to find her but with no luck. \n\n\nLily wound up in her bedroom, but after she turned her back, someone locked her in. Downstairs in Lily's house, someone poured gasoline all over the house and set it on fire. Lily tried desperately to get out of the house when Keith showed up and carried her outside to safety. \n\n\nOnce outside, Keith and Lily saw Les and realized that he was the one behind the fire. Les held Keith and Lily at gunpoint and made them leave with him. Carly was still trapped inside the trunk but managed to get free and push the trunk open, but the house was covered in flames. \n\n\nBen and Jessica arrived at the police station to tell Jack about Lily's car accident. Jessica started to tell Jack about Lily's concerns that Keith might have been involved in Julia's murder. Jack feared that something might be wrong, so he called and asked Holden to meet him at the site of Lily's accident. Holden was at the farm, talking with Lucinda, when Jack called. Once Holden received the call from Jack, he asked Lucinda to watch the kids, and he left. Holden and Jack were at the site of Lily's accident when Jack saw that Lily's brakes had been tampered with. \n\n\nLuke was upset about his parents getting a divorce, so he went to Keith's house to talk with him. He found that the house had been broken into and destroyed. Outside Keith's house, Luke saw the smoke from his house and ran off. Just as Luke got to his house, Holden and Jack showed up. \n\n\nLuke spotted Lily and Keith leaving with a man and told Holden. Holden rushed off to find Keith and Lily. Jack thought that Carly was inside the burning house, so he rushed in to save her. Jack made it upstairs to the attic and found Carly trapped. Carly told Jack to save himself, but Jack refused to leave without her. \n\n\nMeanwhile Les took Keith and Lily to the basement of the Snyder farm and was about to shoot Lily when Keith jumped in the way and was shot in the shoulder. Holden found them and tried to get the gun from Les, but Les punched Holden and ran off. Les ran upstairs to where Lucinda was and held the gun to her head. Les was about to shoot Holden when Jack entered and shot Les. Jack confirmed that Les was dead, and Jack and Carly embraced.  \n\n\n",

Jack finds Luke in front of the burning house and figures out that Carly is still trapped inside. He rushes in to save the love of his life. Keith and Les wrestle in the cellar with Keith being shot in the shoulder. Holden comes in just in time and tackles Les.
