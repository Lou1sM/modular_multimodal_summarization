    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Old Town, Faith spots Parker talking to Morgan and her friends; Morgan asks if he's walking to a certain street, and when he says he is, she says that's the way she's going, too, so they leave together. Faith sits down and unwraps a candy bar and eats it. Holden walks up, and Faith hides the wrapper; when Holden asks where the snacks are that she was supposed to be buying, Faith says she saw some friends who were hungry and gave them to them. Holden says it's time for the movie, but Faith says she doesn't want to go anymore; Holden says he doesn't really want to go, either, and Faith asks him what's wrong. He tells her he's worried about Meg because she is going to marry Craig Montgomery; Faith is surprised to hear this since she's pretty sure Paul still loves Meg. Holden says he's confused by it, too, and worried, and Faith says, \"Sorry, Dad.\" He thanks her and suggests they go to the bookstore and then head for Al's to meet Lily, but Faith says they have some time before they have to be there, and she'd like to go to a dance class. She tells Holden she'll call him after her class, and he leaves.\n\n\nCarly gets home, and JJ walks in, having been next door at a friend's house. He tells Carly he wishes they could all see her more often, but Parker has ruined that for them. Carly asks JJ to remember back when he didn't like Carly very much either, and she asks him to try to understand how hard this has all been on Parker, especially in light of Jennifer's death and Hal's death. Just then, the doorbell rings, and it's Lily; she and Carly are terrifically excited to see one another, so JJ goes upstairs to look through his old baseball cards. Carly tells Lily that although she's glad to be back with her kids, she misses Simon so much, she can't stand it; but she also can't stand the idea of Jack and Katie. Lily tells Carly to let it go and move on; Carly says she was just thinking about moving on, and maybe redecorating the house, but she needs a job. Lily suggests she start her own design business, but Carly says no one would back her. Lily says she would back Carly, and when Carly wonders why she'd want to trust someone like her, Lily fills her in on her experience with the diet pills and the baby food company and signing over Worldwide Enterprises to Craig. Carly is stunned but says at least Lily didn't leave her children; Lily responds that there's more than one way to leave a child behind, citing Faith as an example. Lily tells Carly to forgive herself and set her priorities; when Carly asks about Lily's priorities, she says her family, but that her therapist told her she can't be everything to them and that she should consider getting back to work. Lily thinks theirs is a match made in heaven, and Carly ends up agreeing; they shake on their business deal, and Lily leaves. JJ comes back downstairs with some baseball cards; when Carly asks, he tells her Parker doesn't like baseball cards anymore and thinks everything is stupid, but then he's afraid she'll be mad at him. Carly reassures him that she's only mad at the situation they're all in, and nothing JJ says can change how Parker feels. She offers to drive him back to the farm, and JJ says he hopes Parker won't be there.\n\n\nLily meets Holden at Al's and tells him about her offer to Carly. Holden isn't sure it's such a great idea, but after Lily tells him why she thinks it's good for both her and Carly, Holden says it's so crazy, it just might work.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Brad tells Jack he seems overly concerned about who Carly's seeing for someone who claims not to be in love with her anymore. Katie walks up and overhears part of the conversation and tells Brad to back off. She then tells Jack that Brad reported to Kim about having seen them at the studio together in a passionate situation, and Jack accuses Brad of stalking them. Brad says he was having trouble unwinding and had decided to come get some work done, but that proved impossible, and he reminds Jack that he's not the one whose behavior was inappropriate. Brad storms off, and Katie says she did wonder whether what Brad said about Jack caring too much about who Carly was with might be true. Jack says he has a bad history concerning Brad and Carly and that they both know how to push his buttons. Katie tells him about Carly apologizing to her in Old Town and trying to get information from her about the kids, and Jack says that type of behavior is why he doesn't want Brad and Carly \"joining forces.\" Katie says she wishes they could just ignore Brad and Carly; they kiss, but then Jack gets a call from Emma asking him to come home to the farm because of a problem with Parker. He kisses Katie again, then sees Brad watching and says, \"Don't tell mom on us!\" Katie is quite amused and tells Brad that every time he tries to mess things up between her and Jack, he actually ends up making things better between them.\n\n\nBack at the farm, Jack finds Parker outside shooting a BB gun at some cans. Jack asks Parker what he's doing with the gun when he knows Emma keeps it locked up and that Parker knows the rule is that he needs adult supervision to use the gun. Parker says he ran into his mom in Old Town and wanted to take his frustrations out on something; Jack says he understands that, but Parker needs to follow the rules and put the gun back. Parker defiantly tells Jack to put the gun away himself, and an angry Jack shouts, \"What am I supposed to do when you talk to me like that?\" just as Carly and JJ walk up onto the porch. Parker suggests that Jack and Carly both just leave him alone; Jack says he could make that happen, and when Parker asks what he means, Jack says he could send him somewhere to straighten him out.\n\n\nAt Susan's house, Susan questions Emily about Lance and Alison, and she asks whether it's true that Emily was turning tricks at the Lakeview, like Lance said. She thinks back on some of the nights when Emily didn't come home, and the time she was beaten by that man, and she realizes that it's true. Emily tearfully tries to explain to Susan that after her tragic experiences with Paul, Craig, Daniel's kidnapping, and the death of her baby daughter, she felt like she'd lost herself, and she tells her about being picked up by the stranger at the bar who left her $1,000 thinking she was a hooker. Susan asks why she stayed with it, and Emily says because she was in denial and it made her feel in control of her life and desired. She tells Susan she quit hooking and is more concerned with finding Alison. Susan asks why Alison would leave with this man, and Emily says maybe Alison couldn't take finding out her sister was a hooker, but Susan doesn't think so. When Emily says maybe Ali has her own problems, Susan presses her for more information, saying she's sure Emily knows more than she's saying. Emily ultimately breaks down and admits to Susan that Alison had been in Las Vegas making pornographic movies and using crystal meth. Susan is shocked, and she's particularly angry that Emily never thought to come to her for help, since she's both Ali's mom and a doctor. Susan wonders aloud how her daughters could be such strangers to her, and she thinks Emily blames her for this. Emily swears she doesn't blame her mom one bit, saying everything she did, she accepts responsibility for herself.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the Lakeview, Dusty gets the number of Lance's limo driver from the desk clerk and calls him; he's told they almost didn't make the flight because they stopped to pick up Lance's girlfriend. Dusty then runs into Cheri in the lobby and asks her what she's done; she ends up admitting that she told someone from Las Vegas that Emily worked as a hooker for her, in an effort to get back at Dusty for shutting down her operation at the other hotel. When Dusty asks what makes her think he'd even care what she told anyone about Emily, she says she was just taking a shot, and from the look on his face, she hit the jackpot. \n\n\nDusty goes to Susan's, looking for Emily, and when he walks in, Susan is angry with him, too, saying he knew about all of this and should have told her what was going on. Dusty says he didn't think it was his place. Susan tells Dusty she doesn't want him doing anything else to try to help their family, but Emily steps up and says if it weren't for Dusty, Alison would still be in Vegas, hooked on drugs, so Dusty is staying. Susan says, \"Then the hell with both of you!\" and storms out. Emily tells Dusty what happened with Alison and Lance, and she bursts into tears as Dusty tries to comfort her. Emily is worried about Susan, saying she's mad on the outside but devastated on the inside. Dusty tells her to take care of her mom, and he'll go find Alison and bring her back again. Emily wants to know how, but Dusty says he'll just do it. Emily thanks him tearfully, and they embrace again.\n\n\nLance and Alison arrive back in Vegas, where Ali thanks Lance for sticking with her and not letting her push him away. She goes to shower, and Lance calls someone and tells them he brought Ali back. He then says Alison has no idea what's going on because he hasn't told her about it yet.\n\n\n\n\n",
