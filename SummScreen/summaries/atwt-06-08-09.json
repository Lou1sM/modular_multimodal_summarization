Meg told him that her statement was that Paul had gotten her permission to take Eliza on a trip with him, and Damian backed her up. Meg told Dusty and Bonnie that she appreciated all their efforts in finding the baby, but she just wanted to get back to enjoying her daughter. Dusty approached Rosanna and asked her to speak up about how Paul had confessed to kidnapping Eliza, and Rosanna was torn between telling the truth to Dusty or lying for Paul. Finally she backed up whatever Meg had said and then asked to speak with Jack alone in the interview room. Damian took Meg and her daughter out. \n\n\nDusty went after Jack in the interview room, and the two began talking. Jack took Dusty outside for their conference, so Paul went into the interview room to speak with Rosanna. He thanked her for backing him up, and, in turn, Rosanna complimented him for doing the right thing by returning his daughter to Meg. Rosanna did not appear upset that she had ended up back in Oakdale. \n\n\nCraig visited Carly after keeping his distance for several days. He asked to see her designs for the vitamin water business, and Carly interpreted that as doubt that she had actually produced any work. She handed him a packet of drawings, however, that seemed to more than satisfy him; in fact, he pronounced them spectacular. Craig then handed Carly a check for $10,000 and said she was to consider it a down payment on a healthy partnership. He offered her a 50-50 split on the business, but Carly flatly turned him down and opened the door to usher him out. \n\n\nCraig closed the door, however, so Carly said that they had learned that they could not work together without complications. Craig suggested that they focus strictly on business this time around. Carly accused Craig of just looking for ways to watch her closely to see if she was still drinking. He agreed that it was not just about business; it was about the fact that he cared for her. \n\n\nDamian and Meg took a sleeping Eliza to the Snyder farm. Meg thanked Damian for supporting her throughout her ordeal. She revealed that she thought that Paul had finally learned his lesson and would never take the baby again without permission. Meg asked Damian to hold Eliza while she went to ready Eliza's room, so he did. Dusty pounded on the back door, and Meg hurried back. Dusty made another plea to Meg to take the opportunity to get rid of Paul, but it fell on deaf ears, and Dusty left in a hurry. \n\n\nRosanna and Jack talked, and Jack was dumbfounded that she had put herself in the care of strangers instead of returning to Oakdale after her recovery. Rosanna had heard that he and Carly were no longer married, and she asked about her sister. Jack admitted that Carly had experienced a bad year, and Rosanna asked to see her. Jack encouraged her to get in touch with Carly, but Rosanna said she preferred that Jack make the call, because she wanted no possibility of running into Craig. Jack called Carly at home and asked if she was sitting down. He said Rosanna was at the police station and wanted to see her. Carly grabbed her keys and took off, leaving Craig speechless. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Rosanna asked Jack if Carly and Craig were \"close,\" and Jack answered that they were \"too close.\" He did allow that Carly needed all the help she could find at the moment. Rosanna was just about to ask for details when Carly burst in and hugged her sister. Rosanna apologized for not notifying Carly when she recovered from her coma, and she suggested they go somewhere and get a drink. Carly and Jack made eye contact, and Carly said they would find someplace quiet, and the two of them left. \n\n\nDusty and Bonnie went to the Lakeview and sat at the bar. Dusty was still fuming that Paul was a free man. Bonnie asked him if he was really worried that Paul might endanger the baby again, or if it was more likely that Dusty was upset that Meg no longer needed him to be her hero. Dusty claimed that he wanted the good guys to win, and the bad guys to go to jail. Rosanna and Carly walked in, and Dusty challenged Rosanna for letting Paul off the hook. Rosanna said that everyone deserved a second chance. Bonnie took Dusty away so that the sisters could talk, but Dusty disappeared into the lobby, so Bonnie went back to the bar. \n\n\nRosanna and Carly began talking, and Rosanna asked about her sister's relationship with Craig. Carly explained about the vodka business, but she said that everything was over between her and Craig. Rosanna asked what Carly could find appealing about the man who had tried to kill her, and Carly called it a \"lapse of judgment\" at a time when she was lonely and weak. Carly then defended Craig by saying that his getting Johnny back had changed him for the better. \n\n\nRosanna told Carly about her dire financial straits, and Carly reminded her of the trust fund that Rosanna had established for Parker. Rosanna said that there was no way she would touch that, but Carly said it had been so generous that Parker could certainly spare a great deal of it. She also mentioned that Craig had done a pretty good job of managing the trust, and Rosanna went ballistic. She was horrified that Craig was Parker's trustee, but she vowed again that she would not touch her nephew's money. \n\n\nCarly asked Rosanna to stay with her, but Rosanna declined. She warned her sister that once Craig wanted someone, there was no way he would back off. Carly promised that Craig was out of her life, and Rosanna left, telling Carly that she would be in touch soon. Carly was alone at the table with two half-drinks, so she finished both of them, and walked out. \n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds, where he found his mother waiting for him. Barbara wanted to be sure her son was all right, and Paul assured her that he was. Paul mentioned Rosanna, and Barbara thought he was remembering the past, but he filled her in on Rosanna's life after she regained consciousness. Like the others in Oakdale, Barbara was stunned that her ex-daughter-in-law was back. \n\n\nCraig showed up at the police station looking for Carly and Rosanna. He was truly shocked that Rosanna was back in town. Jack told him that he knew why Craig was there; he was scared. Craig reminded Jack that he had been acquitted of the charge of trying to run Rosanna off the road, so his conscience was clear. \n\n\nJack said that was not what he meant. He thought Craig was frightened that Rosanna would talk some sense into Carly, and then Craig would be out on his backside. Jack laughed heartily when Craig announced that there was no reason that he and Rosanna couldn't both be in Carly's life. Jack suggested that Craig begin looking for a new friend, if he could find one. \n\n\nDusty went back to the Lakeview lounge, and Bonnie was still there. He told her that Meg had advised him to mind his own business and to knock off the hero business. Bonnie said \"I told you so,\" and Dusty got miffed and cancelled his drink before walking out. After a few minutes, Bonnie appeared at Dusty's hotel room, toting a bottle of bourbon. She apologized for being obnoxious, as Dusty poured them both drinks. She said she had a high tolerance for \"bad attitudes,\" so Dusty countered by saying that he had a high threshold for \"bossy.\" Bonnie toasted to their not hating each other as much as they used to. \n\n\nPaul called Meg, who did not answer her phone. Just then, Rosanna walked into Fairwinds, and Paul seemed pleased to see her. He told her she was welcome there any time, so she reminded him that he had offered to give her any help she needed. She asked for a place to stay for a few days, because she was not comfortable going to Carly's with Craig hovering like a hot air balloon. Paul told her to stay as long as she liked. \n\n\nCarly returned home and looked long and hard at her check from Craig. She was about to tear it in half, when she paused. Craig knocked on the door, and he asked for Rosanna. Carly asked why he needed to talk to her sister, so Craig said that they needed to clear the air. Carly was not pleased that her sister was not staying with her because she was fearful that she would run into Craig. \n\n\nCraig rambled on about \"perceptions and misconceptions,\" and said that he wanted to find a way to co-exist with Rosanna. He asked Carly to agree that if he found a way for Rosanna to forgive him, then he and Carly could get back at least to their business relationship. Carly said that would never happen, and, besides, she was making no deals. She asked Craig to get out, and he did.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig tries to get Carly to stay in business with him to work on a vitamin water line, but she thinks he is just trying to keep an eye on her so she won't drink. Craig tries to convince her to give them a shot, but there conversation is interrupted by a phone call. Dusty tries to get Meg to press charges against Paul, but she won't budge and is just happy that Paul brought her home; she thinks she is doing what is best for her child. Dusty isn't happy to hear this so he tries to convince Rosanna to stand up against Paul, but she won't either. Dusty is very displeased, as Damian stands up for Meg and tells Dusty to back off. Paul thanks Rosanna for supporting him, as they say their goodbyes and Paul heads home and Rosanna stays to talk with Jack. An elated Meg and Damian bring Eliza home to the farm. Rosanna and Jack talk about what happened with her and Carly's relationship with Craig. Jack tells Rosanna that Carly is in trouble and needs her help. Rosanna asks him to call Carly for her. Jack calls Carly down to the station because Rosanna is there, as a stunned Carly races out leaving Craig behind looking unsure of what she told him about how possibly Rosanna could be back in town. Carly races to the station and interrupts Jack and Rosanna's conversation before he is able to tell her about Carly's drinking problem. Rosanna wants them to catch up over drinks, as Jack looks noticeably bothered to hear this, but Carly won't give him the chance for him to say anything. Dusty butts heads with Bonnie and later with Meg, as he continues to try to get someone to put Paul behind bars. Both agree he no longer needs to play the hero, which frustrates him. Meg enjoys spending time with Eliza and Damian. He offers her a shoulder anytime, which seems to please Meg. Bonnie and Dusty later toast to no longer hating one another as much as they did before, as they smile at each other. Rosanna and Carly talk over martinis, as they catch up. Rosanna can't imagine what Carly would want with Craig, but Carly plays off their relationship and asks her to stay with her. Rosanna wants to think about things some more, but doesn't want to bump into Craig. After Rosanna leaves, Carly downs Rosanna's untouched martini and heads home. Craig goes to the police station to find out about Rosanna, as a smug Jack can't wait to tell him that she is back, which means he will be out because Carly will choose Rosanna over him. Carly wants to rip up the check from Craig, but she can't seem to do it. Craig arrives to plead his case to her and to talk with Rosanna. Carly laughs saying they will never be friends and Rosanna will never forgive him. Craig wants her to consider that if he can get Rosanna to forgive him then she might consider being his business partner again. Carly tells him that will never happen and that she wants him to leave, but when he does, Carly seems a little saddened by this afterwards.",
