Meg's doctor approached with a toxicology report that showed high levels of methadone in Meg's system. Paul seemed puzzled by the findings, but Emily exclaimed that Meg had been doing drugs the whole time.\n\n\n       Ranting about the drug use, Emily stormed into Meg's room, but a startled Meg declared that she'd never take drugs. Paul sent Emily out of the room and he asked Meg for the truth. Vehemently denying it, Meg reminded him that she'd rarely even take aspirin.\n\n\n       Outside the room, Emily encountered Alison and revealed that Meg had been taking methadone. Alison thought that was a curious thing because some methadone had gone missing just a few days prior. Alison recalled seeing Meg at the hospital around the same time.\n\n\n       When Barbara arrived, Emily filled her in on the toxicology report. Emily asserted that an unstable Meg was drugging herself, but Barbara theorized that someone else had done it. An offended Emily wondered if Barbara were accusing her of something.\n\n\nPaul approached, and Emily repeated what Alison had said about the missing methadone. Paul refused to jump to conclusions, and Emily seethed that he thought that worst of everyone, but Meg. He claimed that it wasn't true, and Emily challenged him to take his wife's side.\n\n\n       Barbara slipped into Meg's room, and Meg declared that she hadn't given herself the drug. Barbara told Meg about the missing methadone, and Meg swore that she hadn't stolen it. \"You can ask Emily...She was here at the same time I was,\" Meg revealed.\n\n\n       Barbara returned to the corridor to find Emily and Paul still debating about Meg. Barbara repeated Meg's claim that Emily had also been at the hospital the day that the drug had gone missing. Emily reminded Paul that she'd taken Eliza for a checkup that day. Barbara asserted that someone had drugged Meg to make her look bad. Paul found the theory plausible, and Emily became outraged. \"Just tell me the truth, Emily. Did you drug Meg?\" Paul asked.\n\n\nBack in Meg's room, Meg pulled a bag from a drawer. Inside was a bottle of methadone. She held it in her hand and grinned.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry insisted upon going to a doctor's appointment with Vienna, but she claimed that the doctor always made her wait. She promised to call him when the doctor was ready, and he could join her then.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Katie recalled her and Alison's conversation about Chris. The thought of Chris's kiss rattled Katie, and she rushed off to pick up a prescription for Jacob. At the hospital, she saw a couple kissing, and her mind spiraled right back to her kiss with Chris. Katie snapped out of her musings when she overheard Vienna discussing artificial insemination with a nurse. \"No way. I am not going to let you do that,\" Katie declared after the nurse had left.\n\n\n       Vienna said that she was desperate, because Henry wouldn't sleep with her for fear that he'd hurt the baby. Katie urged Vienna to be honest with Henry and just let nature take its course. Alison stood in the background as Vienna asserted that nature needed a little help.\n\n\nHenry went to Trinity Park to remember when he and Vienna had released balloons for their unborn child. He had a panic attack, and Barbara approached as he breathed into a paper bag. He didn't want Barbara to see him like that, but she cited that he'd been there for her panic attack. Henry felt uncomfortable confiding in her, but she claimed that she was over him being with Vienna. Barbara advised him not to push away a friend just when he needed one.\n\n\nHenry said that after shopping at a baby store, he'd wound up on the spot where he and Vienna had bidden goodbye to their baby. He feared losing the new baby, but Barbara encouraged him to stay strong. She assured him that the baby would be fine, and he'd be a wonderful parent. Barbara felt that Henry and Paul were both good men, despite their father.\n\n\nBarbara hoped that Henry could move beyond their involvement to give his all to his new family. She felt that he, Vienna, and the baby deserved happiness. Henry hoped that Barbara also found what she was looking for. \"I thought I had,\" she uttered. He tried to embrace her, but she stopped him. Staring regretfully at each other, they parted ways.\n\n\n       Later, Henry showed up at the hospital, and Vienna noted that he hadn't waited for her call. She said that he'd wasted his time, because her appointment had been canceled. Leading her away, Henry stated that he had a surprise waiting for her.\n\n\n       At Java, Henry gave Vienna her favorite music to play for the baby and a storybook that she'd loved as a child. He apologized for being anxious and scared, but he wanted everything to work out. She assured him that it would. \"I can't wait to have a baby with you, Liebchen,\" he said and kissed her hand. She smiled sadly.\n\n\n       They returned to the Lakeview, and Henry confided that he'd gone to Trinity Park. He said that being in the place where they'd said goodbye to the baby had helped him realize that he had to move on and that everything would be okay. They vowed to give their baby a wonderful life, and Vienna whispered for him to make love to her. \"No fear, remember?\" she said, and they sank onto the bed.\n\n\nAt Java, Chris attempted to ask Alison out, but she figured that he had the wrong girl. Chris got confused, and Alison guessed that he didn't remember the romantic professions that he'd made while on the painkillers. Chris hoped that he hadn't embarrassed her, but she responded that he'd thought that he'd been speaking to Katie, not Alison.\n\n\n       Alison figured that the incident had clarified things between her and Chris, and the two resolved to be just friends. She revealed that she'd shared what he'd said with Katie, and Chris stated that Katie hadn't mentioned it to him. \"And that is not a good thing,\" he figured.\n\n\n       At WOAK later, Chris pulled Katie aside to talk about his profession to Alison. He realized that he'd spoken to the wrong person, but he claimed that it was still true. Katie gulped as he stated that he had strong feelings for her, and he couldn't forget about the kiss. She tried to avoid the conversation, and Chris accused her of being afraid to let Brad go.\n\n\n       Katie said that Chris couldn't force her to have feelings for him, and he replied that he wouldn't compete with her dead husband. Katie felt that he had no idea of what she was going through to lose her spouse, and he decided that it was best to just leave her alone. He said that he'd tape his last show with her, and then she'd never have to see him again.\n\n\n       Chris and Katie sat on the set before taping, and Katie wondered what he'd expected her to say when he'd made his profession. He stated that he'd been medicated, but he'd hoped that she'd feel the same way. Katie quipped that she didn't, and he shouldn't have expected a kiss to change her entire life. Chris reminded her that she hadn't wanted to talk about it, but Katie continued to comment on it. Chris remarked that if she was that persistent about something that she didn't care about, he was dying to see her handle something that she did care about.\n\n\n       While on air, Chris told the audience that he was leaving the show. He wished them and Katie the best, and they went off the air. Katie was speechless, but he said that she didn't have to speak. He stated that he really did wish her the best, and it really was goodbye. Katie looked upset as he walked away.\n\n\n       At the Hughes house, Tom arrived home from visiting Daniel, and Casey pensively remarked that a kid could do well, even without his parents raising him together. Tom's interest piqued, and Casey confided that he might have gotten someone pregnant. Casey expressed his willingness to step up, but the mother hadn't confirmed him as the father. Tom offered to get a court ordered paternity test, but Casey hoped that he wouldn't have to resort to that. Tom said that Casey would be a good father, and Casey responded that he'd learned from the best.\n\n\n       Casey went to the hospital, where Alison apprised him of the tense conversation that she'd seen between Katie and Vienna. Alison urged him to ask his aunt Katie about it, but he worried that Katie would freak out and tell his mother. Casey agonized over how he'd find out the truth, and Alison stated that she might know a way to discover the name of Vienna's doctor.\n\n\n       Casey and Alison went to the records room, and she pulled up information on the computer. Later, they reviewed Vienna's hospital file to discover that she hadn't even had a doctor's appointment since the miscarriage. Casey figured that it was possible that Vienna had seen a doctor outside Memorial, but Alison wondered why Vienna would say that the doctor worked at Memorial if he didn't.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Casey tells Tom that he may have gotten someone pregnant and Tom promises to help Casey legally claim his child if he does turn out to be the father of the baby. Alison sees Katie an Vienna talking and suggests Casey asks Katie about her conversation with Vienna. Casey doesn't want to take Alison's suggestion so Alison checks the hospital computer to determine the last time Vienna saw a doctor and she discovers that Vienna hasn't seen a doctor since she lost her baby last year. A desperate Vienna gets information about artificial insemination and Katie hears Vienna talking to a nurse and advises Vienna not to go through with her plan. Katie thinks it is best to let nature take its course but Vienna is afraid she will lose Henry if he finds out she isn't pregnant. Henry has a panic attack as he sits in the park and remembers the child he and Vienna lost last year. Barbara helps Henry through his attack and he shares his fears with Barbara that Vienna will lose the baby she is carrying. Barbara tells Henry that the baby will be fine and he shouldn't let their past relationship keep him from committing to Vienna because she has already accepted that he is going to marry Vienna Henry and Barbara say good- bye to each other and wish each other happiness. Henry brings a bag full of gifts for Vienna and apologizes to her for being so scared and anxious . Henry tells Vienna he can't wait to marry her and be a father to their child and then they make love. Chris tells Katie he has feelings for her and he can't stop thinking about the kiss they shared. Katie tells Chris she doesn't want to fall in love again so Chris decides to quit the show and leave Katie alone since it is what she wants him to do to leave her alone. Paul and Barbara both accuse Emily of drugging Meg although Emily swears she didn't do it. Paul believes Meg and so does Barbara. Meg smiles as she listens to everyone argue in the hospital hall way and then she takes the methadone pills out of her purse. The pills are the same ones found in her system and the ones that were taken from the hospital a couple of days ago.",
