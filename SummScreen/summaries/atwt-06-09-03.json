Chris goes to the Lakeview Lounge looking for the couple, but instead runs into his old flame, Molly.  He confesses to Molly that he really cares for Alison, but is trying not to let anyone know about it.  Alison also confesses to Gordo that she is trying to make Chris jealous by going out with him, and Gordo jokingly says that now he will have to kill Chris so that Alison will like him.
