Holden said the important thing was that everyone had survived and was okay. Luke started to cry in Holden's arms. Afterwards, they began to clean out some stuff from the house. \n\n\nHolden said that family was the most important thing they had. Luke asked if the family could be fixed. Holden said he didn't know. Holden later found the divorce papers and told Jack he thought it was funny that everything else had been destroyed but not the papers. Jack was quick to add that Lily had never signed the papers.\n\n\nLily was sitting at the hospital with Keith, who was in a lot of pain. Keith wanted to know why she was there and not with her family. She told him she wanted to make sure he was doing okay. He said he would survive and that she needed to be with her kids. Lily told him that he had saved her life and wanted to know if they had a chance together. \n\n\nKeith asked her if there was a \"we\" anymore. Lily told Keith that he had entered her life at a very unhappy time. She asked Keith if he could ever forgive her. He told her that there was nothing to forgive and that he loved her. They both agreed to start over and forget about the past. As they kissed, Holden watched through the door.\n\n\nAt the farm, Jack went after Carly and told her that Les was dead for good. Someone from Internal Affairs, who had questions for Jack, interrupted them. Carly went outside and, as she stood outside the door, kept seeing Les. Jack walked outside and found Carly standing there, terrified. Jack wanted Carly to see someone professional to help her. Internal Affairs told Jack the case was closed, and they left. \n\n\nRosanna arrived, and she and Carly had a nice reunion. Rosanna explained to Carly what had happened, and Carly said that Rosanna needed to tell people what had really happened with Cabot. Rosanna disagreed and changed the subject. Carly picked up Sage so Rosanna could see how much she had grown. Craig arrived as she was leaving and told Rosanna that Paul and Emily would not be pressing charges.\n\n\nCraig and Rosanna were at the Lakeview, talking about Emily's need for revenge. She was worried about James finding out about Cabot. Craig told her not to worry, and he left to take care of it. Rosanna started to read the paper and realized Carly needed her after she read about the fire. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Paul called Emily and said he had arranged a meeting with Tom Hughes. Mike, who had arrived to talk about Jennifer, interrupted the call. Mike told Paul to just stay away from him and Jennifer. Mike wanted to handle Craig by himself. \n\n\nCraig arrived and asked Paul to cut a deal. Craig told Paul that he knew all about the false charges against him, and he would use it against them if Paul and Emily would not forget about their revenge against Rosanna. Craig then laid a big guilt trip on Paul about not helping Rosanna when she needed him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Emily was trying to get her mother to see her side. Susan didn't want any part of it because she thought it wouldn't do any good. Emily couldn't believe that her mother was taking Hal's side. Emily went to Paul's and flipped out when Paul told her about the deal Craig wanted to make. Emily yelled at Paul for giving in to Craig and pushed him away, only to pull him in again, and they started to kiss.\n\n\nKatie arrived at Mike's and expected to see him but got Jennifer instead. Katie said she wanted to talk to Mike and Jennifer. Jennifer invited Katie in, and they made small talk until Katie mentioned Craig and how she felt bad about what Craig was doing. Jennifer got angry and told Katie that Craig would never be a part of the baby's life. She also told Katie that she didn't trust her either. \n\n\nKatie apologized, but Jennifer said that Katie needed to worry about her own family and not interfere with Jennifer's. Katie left visibly upset and ran into Mike, who wanted to know what was wrong. Katie tried to explain to Mike what she had just tried to explain to Jennifer. Jennifer walked out and told Katie to leave and stay out of their lives. \n\n\n",

Rosanna comes to see if she is ok after everything she's gone through. Rosanna tells Carly everything that happened except that Cabot was involved. Craig tells Paul that if Emily presses charges against Rosanna, then he will press charges against Jennifer, Paul and anyone else that was involved with getting him to leave town. Paul gives in to him. Mike tells Paul to stay out of their lives (his and Jennifer's). Meanwhile, Jennifer tells Katie the same thing. Emily can't convince Susan to help her press charges against Rosanna. Emily goes to Paul and he tells her that he's not sure that pressing charges is the right thing to do now.
