Will demands to know if Gwen is with him or not; Gwen says she can't talk to Will while he's drunk like this. Will says school's over for him, that he's never going to go back, that he doesn't want college and a professional career like Gwen thinks he does. Principal Weber comes outside and tells Will this is a private party, and Will needs to leave. Will yells that Weber doesn't get to tell him what to do anymore because he expelled him, and Gwen takes Will aside, telling the principal she's sorry about this; Will is angry that she's apologizing for him. Mr. Weber tells Gwen that she has a contract to sing at the party tonight and he expects her to honor it, and he tells Will if he doesn't leave, he'll call the police. Gwen goes back inside; seeing Casey, she goes to him and cries that she doesn't know what to do about Will. Maddie leaves to get her a glass of water, and while Casey hugs Gwen, reassuring her that she won't lose Will, Will looks in and sees them together. He storms off; Jade looks through the window, too, and sees Casey and Gwen together, then she follows Will. Maddie returns with the water and says the principal is insisting that Gwen perform, and Gwen says she can't sing the song she rehearsed because it was all about having a future, and she's not sure if she still has one. Casey and Maddie tell her she graduated and did great and should sing a song for all of them, even if it's not the one she rehearsed. After Casey tells her it had better be good, because he's going to act like Simon Cowell, Gwen goes to the stage and sings a plaintive song that includes the lyrics, \"I'll remember you that way.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Will goes to Mathers Bridge, with Jade close behind. She tells him that if he feels like he's been a bad boy, maybe it's because he's always been bad, and he should embrace that part of himself and shout from the bridge that he doesn't care what other people think of him anymore. Will ends up doing just that and tells Jade he feels better; when he stumbles away from the bridge rail, Jade steadies him, and they end up kissing and begin ripping at each other's clothes.\n\n\nJennifer, Dusty, Johnny, Barbara, Kim, and Bob are all at dinner, hoping to get word soon about Dusty's efforts to become Johnny's legal guardian. Meanwhile, Lily comes up to the table and says hello to everyone, then Lucy walks in, and Lily explains that she was there to meet Lucy for dinner. They go to their own table, and Lily realizes there's still some tension there between Lucy and Dusty. Back at their table, Jennifer takes out a letter that Jessica asked Dusty to write to the judge, explaining why he wants to adopt Johnny, and she reads part of it and then has Dusty finish reading it. Just then, a waiter brings Dusty an envelope from Jessica, and it contains the papers stating that Dusty is now Johnny's legal guardian. They all celebrate the news. Meanwhile, Lily gets a call from Damian and leaves, so Lucy calls the hospital to tell them she'll take the extra shift tonight if it's still available. Kim wants to take a picture of Johnny with Dusty and Jennifer, but when Jenn goes to pick up Johnny from the stroller, she says something's wrong, that he's listless and very warm and isn't focusing on her. Bob goes over and takes a look at Johnny and says they should get him to the hospital so they can have him checked to find out what's wrong.\n\n\nIn the Lakeview lobby, Holden punches Damian, just as Luke arrives. Luke asks Holden to be cool and tells him that he's agreed to talk to Damian and that it's safe. Holden wants to know why Damian is in town and tells Luke he wishes he'd come home with him right now. Damian asks Luke to stay, but Luke decides to leave with Holden, telling Damian he'll come back later to talk with him. Damian then calls Lily and says they have a problem; he asks her to come to him, now. Lily goes to meet Damian but tells him not to summon her again with cryptic messages and think she'll come running. Damian tells Lily about Holden punching him but makes it sound like he did this when he and Luke were in the middle of a conversation, telling her that it \"ruined everything\" he was trying to do with Luke. Lily tells Damian that she can't take his side against Holden. Damian tells Lily that he understands that, but he adds that if she allows Holden to push Damian out of Luke's life, Luke will make bad choices. He asks Lily to have lunch with him tomorrow because he has someone he'd like her to meet.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Holden and Luke have arrived back home, and Holden tells Luke he's sorry for how he acted at the hotel; Luke says sometimes Damian asks for it. Holden is happy to hear that Luke doesn't trust Damian completely. Luke asks Holden why he punched Damian. Holden tells him it was because Damian accused him of being a bad father to Luke, saying that people can tell you you've been a bad parent and sometimes you'll believe them. Luke tells Holden that sometimes he used to think about what it would be like to grow up with Damian as his father, about how he'd be like a 007 kid, with intrigue and fancy cars and things; he says he would be suave and cool, but he'd still be gay. He tells Holden that how he was raised had nothing to do with him being gay, and Holden thanks him for saying that. Luke thanks Holden for being accepting of who he is, and Holden says he'd had time to think about it and realize that the important thing was that he loved Luke. Luke wonders if Lily will come to that same conclusion and says he thinks the one good thing about having Damian around is that he appears to be softening Lily up in that regard.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Emily tells Paul to leave because Meg is now there. She says she's ending the pregnancy. Meg and Paul leave the room, and Paul asks Meg why she's there. She tells him a job as a private nurse came up suddenly and involved a patient in the mental ward of the hospital. She also tells him she can keep an eye on Emily if she's working there, but he's upset that she's disturbed his attempts to get Emily to agree to have the baby. Emily overhears all of this. Meg tells Paul that Emily is just manipulating him again. Paul says if Emily thinks the baby is coming between him and Meg, she won't have an abortion, but Meg says if that means that Paul has to say and act like he's made at Meg, she doesn't want any part of that; she really needs Paul to act like he's in love with her. Paul asks for one more chance and goes back inside to talk to Emily. Emily accuses Paul of putting on an act for her. Meg comes in, and Paul decides to tell the truth, saying that he loves Meg and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Emily says, \"Then say goodbye to your child!\" Paul responds angrily, telling her that he's sick of her holding the baby over his head, and he gives her the papers authorizing the abortion, telling her to sign them if she wants to, and then she can be the one to say goodbye to their child.\n\n\n",
