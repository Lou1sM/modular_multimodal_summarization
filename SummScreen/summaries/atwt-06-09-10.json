    "soap_central": "\n\nEmily and Paul argued about the methadone the toxicology screen had identified in Meg as they stood outside her room at Memorial.  Emily swore she had not drugged Paul's ex-wife, and she said again that Meg had been released too early from Deerbrook.  She argued that she adored Eliza and would never do anything that could possible hurt the little girl.  Barbara walked out of Meg's room and began baiting Emily by declaring that Emily had begun drugging Meg so that she could step in and be \"Eliza's mommy.\"\n\n\nEmily urged Barbara to go away, but Barbara told her to tell Paul what she had said about Meg.  Emily admitted that she had voiced the opinion that Meg should be locked up in a mental hospital.   Then a disgusted Emily declared that she was going home, where she and Paul could continue their discussion in private.  Barbara told Paul that she thought that sounded like a confession to her, but Paul said that his mother needed to stay out of his business.\n\n\nIn her room, Meg examined a bottle of methadone as Alison entered.  Meg hid the bottle in a drawer, hugged Alison, and asked her to please help.  Meg begged the girl to talk to her sister, Emily, and to stop Emily from trying to take Eliza away from Meg.  She swore she would never have made herself sick, and Meg blamed Emily for framing her and putting the methadone in her system.  Barbara walked in again and verbally attacked Alison.\n\n\nBarbara asked if Emily had sent Alison to harass Meg, but Alison refused to take the bait.  She defended her sister, but Barbara claimed that everyone, even Paul, knew the truth.  Alison stormed out, and Barbara told Meg that they would get to the bottom of it, and she urged Meg to get back in bed.  Barbara said she had convinced Paul that that Meg was one of Emily's victims because, to be truthful, Meg was the lesser of two evils.  Meg realized that her former mother-in-law was trying to get Emily out of Paul's life.\n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Emily said she couldn't stand the thought of leaving Eliza or of moving back in with her mother.  Paul had returned home, and he hugged his wife, but he stunned Emily by saying that he thought Emily was perfectly capable of drugging Meg.  After all, that was pretty tame compared to shooting Paul and kidnapping Dusty.  Paul said he knew that his wife was \"out there,\" and he looked her in the eye and said, \"I know you.\"  Emily still swore on their marriage that she had not poisoned Meg, and she said she thought it was obvious that Barbara was trying to frame her.\n\n\nPaul could not figure out why his mother had it in for Emily, so she told him it was because Emily had him and Eliza both.  Emily reminded Paul that Barbara had lost her \"boy toy, Henry,\" and she wanted her son back.  Paul did not believe her, and he asked Emily to admit that she had drugged Meg.   Alison interrupted their argument and said she had just been with Meg, and the woman had made crazy accusations against Emily about the methadone.  Emily was furious, as Paul said he needed to go out to think.  Emily cautioned him to think about how his mother had tried from day one to rip them apart, but Paul walked out without saying anything.\n\n\nAlison told Emily to stop Barbara somehow.  When Emily said she didn't know how, Alison asked how her sister would investigate if it were a story she was writing for her online newspaper.  Emily said she would start at the beginning, and Alison reminded her that the day the methadone had disappeared from Memorial, both Emily and Meg had been there.  Emily asked if a methadone test was a routine screening for patients, but Emily explained that it had to be specially ordered.  Emily said they needed to know who had ordered Meg's tox screen to find out who was behind it all.  Alison promised to check it out, and she hugged Emily and left.\n\n\nPaul was outside Meg's room when his mother walked out.  He asked what she was doing, and Barbara claimed she had been sitting with Meg and had nothing at all to do with what was going on.  She also accused Emily again of drugging Meg and showing absolutely no remorse.  Paul denied that Emily had hurt Meg, but Barbara called him \"na\u00efve.\"  Barbara took off, so Paul watched Meg through the window in her room.  After a few minutes, he went in and sat with her for a while.  When he got up to leave, Meg, who had been feigning sleep, began to toss and cry out in distress.  Paul comforted her, and Meg hugged him\n\n\n She pretended that she had experienced a bad dream, so Paul asked if some tea would calm her.  Then it occurred to Paul that just before Meg's two recent breakdowns, Emily had served her tea.  He held Meg close and swore he would protect her always.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Emily lay on the couch and cuddled Eliza.  Alison called her with the news that Barbara Ryan had ordered the tox screen on Meg.  \"I knew it,\" gloated Emily.  When Barbara returned, Emily asked how Barbara dared to try turning Paul against her.  She threatened that when Paul found out that his mother was behind everything, he would never speak to Barbara again.  Then she dropped the bomb that she knew that Barbara had ordered Meg's test, but Barbara did not deny it.  She said she had a hunch that drugs were behind Meg's conduct, but she needed proof.  Emily called Barbara a \"twisted woman\" who had lost Henry and wanted to get close to her son again.  Emily said that Paul loved her, but Barbara countered by asking if that was so, why Paul was at Meg's bedside as they spoke.\n\n\nLuke was working on his laptop at home and found a photo of him and Noah.  Just then, Bob Hughes rang the doorbell and asked whether Luke was available for a lunch meeting that day.  Bob apologized for the short notice, but he explained that soon the hospital board would be discussing the possibility of selling Memorial Hospital to a company called \"Invicta Hospital Corporation,\" and the board needed to \"court\" the buyer before it made its decision.  Bob asked Luke, a major hospital donor to the new wing, to attend a casual lunch with him and the Invicta representative, Ms. Mona Cross.  Bob also mentioned that Dr. Reid Oliver would also be attending, and he hoped that Luke could keep the unpredictable doctor in line.  Luke agreed to lunch at the Lakeview, and then Bob said he hoped that he could also get Noah to at least drop by as \"Exhibit A\" of what Dr. Oliver and the new wing could accomplish.  Luke said Noah would probably be willing to help Bob, but not Reid Oliver.\n\n\n\n\n Bob asked if there was a problem between Noah and Dr. Oliver, and Luke stumbled around until he dismissed the concern as \"nothing.\"  Bob was disappointed that Noah might not attend, because he was living proof of Dr. Oliver's surgical skills.  Bob left, but not before he asked Luke to run the invitation by Noah anyway.  Luke grabbed his coat and said, \"Here goes nothing!\"\n\n\nAt Memorial, Noah had another exam from Dr. Oliver, who found further improvement in Noah's eyesight.  The doctor asked if Noah had any questions, and Noah had only one: he wanted to know when Dr. Oliver had first started having feelings for Noah's boyfriend.  Oliver's answer was, \"The second or third time I laid eyes on him,\" which prompted Noah to inquire how many times Oliver and Luke had \"done it.\"  Reid said Noah would have to \"narrow down\" the question before Reid could answer it.  Then Noah asked how often the doctor hit on other people's boy- or girl friends, and he got sarcastic and asked if Oliver specialized only in blind patients.\n\n\nDr. Oliver asked if he and Noah were no longer patient and doctor, and Noah said that was the way it was.  He no longer needed the services of the doctor, so that meant Reid could say what he felt.  He accused Noah of treating Luke \"like dirt,\" but Noah got very defensive.  The doctor called Noah \"a spoiled brat,\" but Noah walked out and headed to Java in Old Town.\n\n\nAt the coffee shop, Noah asked about getting back his old job, but he got annoyed when the manager told him he had to fill out an application again.  Luke found him there, and Noah was curt and asked what he wanted.  Luke said he wanted a favor: Bob Hughes asked if Noah would meet with him and a representative from Invicta to talk about Noah's surgery.  Noah was agreeable until Luke mentioned that Dr. Oliver was also attending the meeting.  '\"I'm busy,\" blurted out Noah, and he said that he refused to make Dr. Oliver \"look good.\"  Luke reminded his former boyfriend that Reid was single, and by the time Reid had made his first move on Luke, he had been single too. \"What is wrong with you?\" asked Luke, and he reminded Noah of all he owed Reid, but Noah would not budge.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Reid met with Bob Hughes, who wanted to go over Reid's \"presentation\" before anyone else arrived.  His instructions to the younger man were to smile, shake Ms. Cross's hand, tell her he was thrilled to meet her, and to keep his mouth shut.  Bob also suggested that Oliver let others say how amazing he was as a doctor.  Ms. Cross arrived, and Bob introduced himself and then Reid, whom he said they had \"snagged from Dallas\" the previous fall.  Luke also arrived, and Bob described him as a \"major donor to the new wing.\"  Luke interrupted when Reid began veering off course, and he steered the conversation around to Noah's successful eye surgery.\n\n\nMs. Cross had heard of Noah's case, and she said she would love to meet the patient.  Luke gave excuses for Noah, but just then Noah walked in and announced that he had changed his plans.  Ms. Cross asked Noah if he had enjoyed working with Dr. Oliver, and the young man hesitated and then said, \"No.\"  He did temper that by saying that the hospital would attract more talented surgeons with Dr. Oliver as its head, and that would enhance its reputation.\n\n\nMs. Cross thanked Noah and shook his hand, but as Noah turned to leave, he sucker-punched Reid and knocked him backwards onto a couch.  Everyone was shocked, as Bob and Luke ran to check out Dr. Oliver.  Ms. Cross said she was astonished, so Bob offered her a drink and led her to the bar.  Luke said he would drive Reid to the hospital, and he accepted. At the hospital, Oliver checked his nose in a mirror and declared that it was not broken.  He and Luke had a discussion that led to Luke's leaning in as preparation for a kiss with Reid, when Bob unexpectedly opened the door and saw them.\n\n\nBob appeared shocked and asked to have a word with Dr. Oliver alone.  Luke left, and Reid asked Bob what he needed.  \"To be wrong,\" said Bob.  He asked why Reid had not told him that he was having a personal relationship with Luke Snyder outside the hospital, and Reid told him that he had not known that either Luke or Noah was going to be at the meeting.  Bob said that such a relationship was \"inappropriate,\" but Reid argued that Luke had never been his patient, and Noah had terminated his medical services that very morning.  Bob was upset that Noah had clocked the doctor in front of a potential investor who could have poured millions of dollars into the hospital.\n\n\nBob pointed out that if Ms. Cross figured out Luke and Noah's connection, the whole deal could self-destruct.  Reid hinted broadly that the deal had more to do with the fact that it involved two gay men, but Bob insisted that it dealt only with ethics, not sexual orientation.  It was not ethical for Reid to have a relationship with a major hospital donor.  Reid told Bob to butt out of his business, but Bob said it would go as follows: the new wing would go forward and prosper, or Reid could have a relationship with Luke Snyder, but Dr. Oliver could not have both.  Bob asked him to choose, and he walked out.\n\n\nLuke caught up with Noah in Old Town and asked what had happened.  Noah said he had punched Reid because he wanted to.  Luke reminded Noah that he had ended their relationship and therefore had no right to \"punch in\" his opinions on someone else who was attracted to Luke.  Then he asked if Noah's reaction meant that he still cared, but Noah said it was only his being \"fed up.\"\n\n\n",
