He told her that Paul didn't understand Rosanna the way he did. Then, Craig received a phone call from Katie telling him to meet her at the Lakeview, so he left. Carly walked outside and saw Rosanna, who told her about Craig getting Paul to stop Emily from pressing charges against her. Carly said that was a good sign and told Rosanna that it meant there was still a possibility of her reuniting with Paul. \n\n\nCarly told Rosanna to fight for Paul the way Rosanna had helped her fight for Jack. After Rosanna left for the second time, Parker arrived downstairs and told his mom that he'd had a dream \"about Aunt Rosanna and Cabot\" and that Rosanna \"is still sad about Cabot.\" Carly agreed, and Parker said that perhaps Paul could make her laugh, because \"he's good at that.\"\n\n\nMike and Jennifer told Katie to stay out of the whole business with the baby and Craig. Jennifer was glad that Mike had taken her side in front of Katie, even though she knew he agreed with Katie that Craig did have legal rights as the father of her baby. They went to a doctor appointment, to have a sonogram done, but Lisa called Mike away on an emergency visit to the Lakeview. She told him the water pipes had burst at the Lakeview. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Katie went to the Lakeview to meet Craig, to tell him about her failed mission to convince Mike and Jennifer to let him be involved with the baby. Katie mentioned that Mike and Jennifer had been on their way to a doctor appointment, and Craig immediately began saying he was concerned whether something was wrong with the baby. Katie tried to assure him that nothing seemed amiss to her, and she even told Craig that she didn't know which doctor they were seeing because Jennifer had changed doctors after finding out that Katie had read her chart at the doctor's office. \n\n\nCraig left, telling Katie they would have dinner one night that week because it was harder to be alone at night than during the day. As Katie got up to leave, she ran into Mike, who accused her of having arranged to have Lisa call him to get him to go to the Lakeview. He told her to get a life of her own, and she told him to \"go to hell.\"\n\n\nAt the doctor's appointment, Jennifer got to see the baby on the sonogram and was trying to decide whether to find out if it was a boy or a girl when the doctor was called away for an emergency consultation on the phone. A nurse entered and said the baby's father had arrived, and Jennifer excitedly called out to Mike to join her, but instead, Craig walked into the examining room.\n\n\nWill went to see Gwen at her room above the garage, and he told her she couldn't possibly continue to live that way, especially with a baby on the way. He tried to convince her that she should tell Casey that she was pregnant, but Gwen accused him of wanting to do that just to break up Casey and Celia so that Will could pursue Celia. Will denied that and said Gwen didn't need to be alone during or after the pregnancy, but Gwen told Will the one thing she could not do was tell Casey she was pregnant only to have his first words be, \"Is it mine?\" which Will agreed was a likely scenario. \n\n\nGwen said her parents were not in the picture, and she didn't want Casey's family to know about the pregnancy and look at her as \"Casey's mistake.\" She insisted that she was strong and could survive on her own. Will told Gwen it was soon going to be impossible for her to hide the pregnancy, unless she stayed in her room every day, so he still thought telling Casey was the best approach. Will lectured Gwen about smoking during the pregnancy, then he gave her his phone number and told her to call him if she needed anything, but she told him that she was through being anyone's problem and crumpled the piece of paper and threw it away.\n\n\nCelia, Casey, and Tom went to the hospital to have Casey checked out again, since he'd developed a bad headache. Tom told Celia that he might end up prosecuting the girls who had set up the bucket prank at the prom, but he'd do it in a way that would keep Celia safe. He told her to consider his family to be her family while she was in Oakdale. Tom left Celia and Casey alone in the hospital room, and they kissed, but Celia fantasized about it being Will she was kissing. \n\n\nCasey talked about taking Celia to the prom again the next year, and she became upset, telling him he couldn't plan on things that far ahead because the unexpected often happened, but Casey gave her his bracelet and told her he'd still be with her the next year -- if she'd still have him. Later, while Casey was out of the room, having tests done, Will arrived for a visit, and Celia walked into the room. Will said he had something he needed to tell Casey, and Celia told him that if there was something bothering him that he needed to talk about, he could tell her.\n\n\nAt Paul's place, Emily reacted badly to Paul's suggestion that she not press charges against Rosanna, and she screamed at him, but then she kissed him, and they ended up making love. Emily told Paul she had no regrets. Paul told Emily that he'd never forgotten their first time together, years before, which had been his first time with any woman. \n\n\nPaul told Emily that she had turned out all right but that he wished he had a \"do-over,\" because he'd have killed his father when he had the chance, and things would have turned out better for everyone. Emily told him not to talk about James, and she told him she would focus on what he'd done right that day. As she left, Emily ran into Rosanna in the hallway. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Paul and Em hit the sheets. Afterwards, Em said she didn't regret it. They started talking about old times. No one even mentioned Hal. Craig told Ro he convinced Paul to tell Em to drop the charges against Ro. He explained that he had to promise not to sue Jen for running him out of town. Ro thanked him and told him to call if he needed to talk. Then she talked to Carly, who encouraged her to fight for Paul. Ro went to try to talk to him, and arrived just as a very happy Emily was leaving. Katie told Mike and Jen she just wanted to help everyone get along and pointed out Craig was the baby's father and he wasn't bowing out gracefully. Jen told Katie to butt out and Mike backed her up. They went to Jen's doctor appointment and Katie had lunch with Craig. She told him what happened, Craig heard about Jen's doctor appointment, and told Katie he had to leave. Meanwhile, Mike got a call from Lisa. She begged him to come over and fix a broken water line. He told her no, but Jen told him to go and she'd get him a sonogram picture if he didn't get back in time. Mike reluctantly left and ran into Katie and the Lakeview. He accused her of getting Lisa to make up the pipe story just so she could see him. They got in a fight and Katie told him to go to hell. At her appointment, Jen was having her sonogram when the nurse said the father had arrived. Jen told the nurse to send him in, thinking it was Mike. Instead, Craig walked in. Will argued with Gwen, trying to convince her she should tell Casey about the baby. She said she couldn't and asked Will to stay out of it. He went to the hospital to see Casey. Celia had been fantazing about Will while kissing Casey, but agreed to go to next year's prom with Casey. Casey went for tests and Celia waited for him. Will showed up and she told him Casey was having some tests done. Will said he needed to talk to Casey. Celia urged him to tell her what was going on instead.",
