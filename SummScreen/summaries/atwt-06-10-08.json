After Brad left to go to work, Liberty congratulated Janet on having managed to move herself in so quickly. \n\n\nWhen Brad arrived at WOAK, he found out from Kim that his interview with a golf expert had been cancelled and instead, he was supposed to interview a woman who had written a book on single motherhood. Brad panicked, saying he would be lousy at that kind of show, but Kim said unless he could find a co-host who knew a lot about the subject at the last minute, he was on his own. Brad started thinking and realized he could ask Janet. He mentioned the idea to Kim, and she loved it, because Janet had been a hit when she had appeared on the show with Brad and Katie. However, Kim remembered that she had promised Katie she wouldn't let Janet have any more air time. Kim asked Brad to call Katie to see if she would care, since this was an emergency. \n\n\nBrad tried to reach Katie and then called Janet and asked if she could come to the station to help him out with an interview segment. Janet was thrilled, and when she hung up, she asked Liberty if she could borrow some of her clothes, since all she had was what she'd been wearing the day before. Liberty told Janet she couldn't borrow her things because she would stretch them out, so Janet looked towards Katie's bedroom. Liberty told Janet absolutely not, but when Janet said she could either borrow something of Katie's or something of Liberty's, Liberty pointed the way to Katie's closet. \n\n\nJanet took Liberty with her to WOAK, where Brad filled her in on the planned interview. As the interview progressed, Brad asked Janet if she agreed with the author of the book that single motherhood was \"empowering.\" Janet said she did and that she and her daughter shared a special bond, but Liberty spoke up from offstage and said Janet was \"full of it.\" Brad asked if Liberty could join them on air, and Kim nodded, so Liberty, excited, came up on stage. \n\n\nLiberty explained that her mother had frequently told her how hard it was to raise a child alone and that she often thought her mother resented her. Liberty said Janet was a terrific mother, but she thought Janet had more often felt exhausted than empowered. Janet agreed and said the last thing she'd ever wanted was to be a single mom. Janet then said that while having Liberty was the best thing that had ever happened to her, she'd been both a burden and a joy, and she'd missed having someone there to share the burden with her and share the joy of watching Liberty grow up. Janet stated that her biggest mistake had been thinking she could do it all by herself, and she apologized to Brad for not having tried to find him, so that he could have been there to witness Liberty's childhood. Liberty told her mom not to cry, and Janet said she wouldn't, but she was very glad that Liberty had found her father, because there would always be two people who loved her and would be there for her in good times and bad times. Janet hugged Liberty and then Brad, as everyone in the studio applauded. \n\n\nKim paid Janet for her appearance on the show and thanked her; Janet thanked Kim, saying she'd had a great time. Janet then gave Liberty some cash and told her to buy something nice for the first day of summer school. Liberty thanked her and happily bid her parents goodbye. Brad told Janet, \"I know it was rough for a lot of years, but you got it right. She's an awesome kid.\" \n\n\nBrad took Janet back to the Lakeview and was telling her goodbye when Bud came through the lobby. Brad was surprised to see Bud was apparently still staying at the hotel. Janet asked Brad to walk her to her room, so Bud would see that Brad was hanging around. Brad did, but upstairs, Janet was still concerned about Bud's presence in the hotel. She asked if there was another hotel she could move to, but Brad said there wasn't one he would recommend. Janet said she would just have to make sure she locked her door and was careful, and she'd be okay. Brad left, but he turned around and went back to Janet's room and invited her to move into his house for a couple of days, after which he expected Bud would have checked out of the hotel. \n\n\nJanet asked Brad if he was sure about his offer, and Brad said yes, pointing out that Janet would be helping him by cooking and cleaning for him and Liberty. Janet happily accepted his offer and began packing her suitcase. Brad received a call on his cell phone from Katie, who had seen that he had tried to call her earlier. He told her there'd been a last-minute change on the show, and he asked her if she'd seen the episode. She hadn't, and Brad told her he would explain it to her later but that he'd handled it really well. He told Katie nothing else worth mentioning was happening, and he hung up. Janet asked why he hadn't told Katie about her moving in with him and Liberty. Brad said Katie was on her way to an interview, but he would tell her later. \n\n\nAt home, Carly realized JJ was very ill and that he was running a fever despite the fact that he had secretly been taking fever medication. She asked Parker to take Sage to a friend's house, and she called Jack to tell him she was taking JJ to the emergency room at the hospital. Jack met her there, and the doctor told them JJ had strep throat and had probably been sick for a few weeks. The doctor was concerned about possible complications from the strep infection, including rheumatic fever and cardiac complications, so he examined JJ's lungs and heart. He then told Jack and Carly they could take JJ home and he would give them a list of symptoms to watch for, as well as prescriptions for an antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory drug. Carly and Jack both felt that they should stay with JJ, so they took him back to Carly's house together. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Jack found Sage's old baby monitor and put it in JJ's room so they'd be able to hear JJ if he needed them. Jack could see how worried and tense Carly was, so he suggested she take a relaxing bath while he kept an ear out for JJ. Carly went to take a bubble bath and was surprised when Jack waltzed into the bathroom, looking for another thermometer. Carly said he couldn't do things like that anymore, but Jack teased her, saying there was nothing in the tub he hadn't seen before. Carly said, \"That may be, but you're not seeing any of it today!\" Jack replied jokingly, \"I could wash your back.\" Carly laughed and threw her sponge at him, saying, \"Get out!\" \n\n\nWhen Carly had put on her nightgown and robe, she found Jack in her bedroom. She thanked him for having gotten her to laugh, and he said next, he would get her to sleep. Carly said Jack didn't need to stay, but he couldn't leave JJ any more than she could. Jack then asked Carly to lie down and close her eyes and imagine it was the end of summer, and JJ had completely recovered and was back playing baseball and fighting with Parker. Instead of Carly falling asleep, though, Jack did. \n\n\nCarly got up and went downstairs. Parker came in and said Sage was staying at her friend's house. He asked how JJ was doing, and Carly filled him in on the details. Parker asked if JJ would be well enough to go to camp, but Carly said probably not. \n\n\nLiberty went shopping and then went to Java, where she saw an ad for Oakdale Youth Summer Camp, asking for tennis counselors. She quickly sent a text message to Parker, telling him to meet her in Old Town. Parker told Carly he'd like to go for a bike ride. Carly told him that was fine, and he left and went to Java to meet Liberty. When he arrived, she showed him the ad, and Parker said he would look into it. \n\n\nAt Lily's house, Lily told Lucinda how upset she was that Lucinda had not let her or Holden know what kind of situation was going on with Luke and Noah in New York. Lucinda said Holden and Lily had too many troubles of their own to help Luke. Holden arrived, and Lucinda told him that Luke and Noah had been involved in an \"incident\" in New York, which, Lily added, \"could have gotten him killed!\" Lucinda left, and Holden told Lily he should go, too, prompting her to snipe that he wouldn't want to be alone with her a single minute longer than necessary. \n\n\nLuke and Noah arrived back at the cottage, and Luke tried to figure out what to do next for Noah. Noah, however, was very upset about his father's death and Ameera's placement into custody in New York. He asked Luke to just go home, but Luke said he wouldn't be dismissed \"like a pet.\" Luke told Noah he loved him and wanted to help him, because he didn't want Noah to forget what they had together. Luke hugged Noah, and Noah said he loved Luke, too, but he needed a break \"from us.\" Noah told Luke it wasn't about Luke, that he just needed to be able to think, but Luke said he thought Noah blamed him for what had happened in New York. Noah became angry and finally admitted it, shouting that he did wonder what might have happened if Luke hadn't shown up when he did and said the things he'd said. He threw a bowl on the ground, deliberately shattering it, then cleaned it up as Luke watched. Luke asked what Noah expected of him, and Noah said he didn't know, but he knew he needed a break. \n\n\nLuke left and went to his mother's house, where he found her with Holden and filled them in on Noah's intentions. Luke said he loved Noah, and Holden suggested he pay attention to Noah's request for some time apart, because it most likely wouldn't be permanent. Lily asked what would happen if Luke gave Noah space and Noah grew farther apart from Luke as a result, and Holden said that maybe that meant they weren't supposed to be together in the first place. Luke, realizing what was going on, told his parents they could both be right and that he just had to hope he would pick the right path. Luke said he needed some time to think and that he was going for a walk. He left, leaving Holden and Lily to realize what an amazing son they had raised. \n\n\nLuke called Noah, who immediately apologized for blowing up at him. Luke asked if Noah wanted to meet him at Java for coffee, but Noah said he still needed time alone, not because of Luke but because of everything that had happened. Luke told Noah he loved him and would be there for him any time Noah needed him. \n\n\nHolden tried to call Jack, but since he was sleeping, Carly answered Jack's cell phone. Holden was surprised to hear her voice, and she asked him if she could give Jack a message. Holden said they were having some trouble concerning Ameera, and then he asked Carly if she was okay. Carly said she'd been better and asked Holden how he was doing. Holden said he couldn't talk at the moment, and asked Carly to have Jack call him back.\n\n\n",
