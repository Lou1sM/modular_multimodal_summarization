Bonnie asked if something had happened that she didn't remember on the road trip, and Dusty teased her, and Bonnie flirted back.  He said he had to apologize to Meg for ordering her what to do about Paul.  Dusty was unable to understand why Meg was giving her crazy ex-husband another chance.  As Dusty walked out, Derek walked in.\n\n\nDerek immediately zeroed in on the bra and asked for the story of how that piece of apparel had ended up in Dusty's car.  Bonnie insisted that nothing was going on between her and Dusty, and then she asked Derek why, even if there were, that would be any of his business.  Derek said he thought the two of them had something special, even though he had never mentioned anything specific.  They exchanged some harsh words before Derek stomped out.\n\n\nCraig dropped in on Carly to see how she and Parker had weathered the night.  He suggested that he and Carly work outside on the porch, since the day was so beautiful.  Carly asked what was wrong with him that he did not comprehend that she would not work with him anymore.  Carly told him that her entire family hated him and wanted him out of her life.  Craig said it was up to him to change their minds, starting with Rosanna.\n\n\nCarly wished Craig good luck with Rosanna, especially since her sister had chosen to stay with Paul, a raving lunatic, rather than live with her, where Craig was a too-frequent visitor.  Craig told her to trust him, and he would think of something.\n\n\nDamian visited Meg at the farm, and she told him that she was really enjoying having her daughter back home.  Damian noticed that Meg was covering up some legal papers, and she finally admitted that they were a revised custody agreement with Paul.  Meg explained that she was allowing Paul visiting rights with a chance to increase the time if he played nicely.  She thought that Eliza should grow up knowing her father and grandmother.  The baby began crying, so Damian offered to check on her and replace her pacifier, if that was what she needed.  As he went upstairs, Meg answered a knock on the door.\n\n\nDusty arrived, bearing flowers, and he apologized for issuing orders to Meg.  They kissed, and then Dusty noticed the new custody agreement.  He was horrified to learn that Meg had initiated the document that gave Paul more rights to Eliza.  Dusty told Meg that she was playing with fire, and Meg replied that she didn't care what he thought.  \n\n\nDusty grabbed the papers, as Damian returned to the room. Meg asked Damian to stick around for a while, and she ushered Dusty outside for a private talk.  Meg said she could not see him anymore, and Dusty was shocked that she was apparently breaking up with him over Paul.  Meg denied that, and Damian called her in because Eliza was crying.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul served Rosanna tea, and she commented that it was strange being back there.  Paul apologized for treating her badly when they ended their marriage.  Rosanna said she did not want to be dependent on Paul; she would find her own job and her own place to live.  Paul said that he liked having her around, and he asked her to stay, at least for a while.  Rosanna agreed to stick around and find a job.  Paul asked if the \"finding a job thing\" was just a cover for figuring out how to get back all the money that Craig had taken from her, but Rosanna set him straight.\n\n\nRosanna said that while she was working at the co-op farm, she had realized the \"virtues of the simple life,\" and she really did not need her money back.  Paul said that recovering the money would only take a really good plan, but Rosanna did not want a fight on her hands.  She gave Paul a hug for caring, and she left to see Carly.\n\n\nRosanna stopped by Old Town and ran into Craig.  She turned around and tried to run, but Craig stopped her by shouting out his concern for Carly.  He told Rosanna that her sister had been through hell lately and was still on a downward spiral.  Carly needed help from everyone who cared for her.  Craig asked for a temporary truce between the two of them, for Carly's sake.  Rosanna picked up that Craig had genuine feelings for Carly, but she told him that she would not approve of his seeing her sister if her life depended on it.\n\n\nCarly greeted her sister at her door, and Rosanna told her how weird it was to be back in Oakdale and living at Fairwinds.  She claimed that Paul had really changed, but Carly still considered him a sociopath, and she segued the conversation into a discussion that perhaps Craig had changed, as well.  She argued that Craig was the only person around who thought that she could do anything right.  Rosanna noticed Carly's drawings for the vitamin water product, and she questioned her sister further about her feelings for Craig.\n\n\nDusty began drinking at Metro with Bonnie.  He told her that Meg had dumped him, and Bonnie commiserated with him by sharing that Derek had dumped her, as well.  The two of them clinked glasses.\n\n\nPaul skulked around the halls of the Lakeview, waiting for an opportunity to break into Craig's room.  He got his chance when the maid left the floor, and he got inside the room.  Craig's laptop sat on the deck, so Paul sat down and went to work.  He began establishing new accounts and transferring money.  Craig returned to the hotel and was in the process of unlocking the door to his room, just as Paul finished his business but had not yet logged off.\n\n\nPaul jumped up from the desk to look for a place to hide, but Rosanna's sudden appearance of in the hallway saved him.  She asked to speak to Craig, but she refused to enter his room alone, so they went downstairs to talk. As soon as Craig closed the door, Paul returned to the desk and logged off the computer.  He walked out with the parting words, \"Don't worry, Rosanna, you can thank me later.\"\n\n\nDownstairs, Rosanna told Craig that Carly thought he was good for her.  She worried about her sister's frame of mind and loss of confidence.  Rosanna reluctantly told Craig that for probably the first time ever, he and she were on the same side: Carly's.  She swore that if Craig hurt Carly, she would make him pay.\n\n\nRosanna returned to Fairwinds, and a grinning Paul soon joined her.  He said it made him happy to do things for people who had helped him.  He told Rosanna that he had gotten her money back from Craig.  Rosanna got upset and asked him if he was out of his mind.  She wanted to know who the hell had asked him to do that.  She shouted that she thought Paul had cleaned up his act, but he had continued to not listen and to hurt people who got close to him.  Paul offered to \"fix\" the problem, but Rosanna said that she would tell Craig exactly what had happened and return the money.\n\n\nCarly went to Metro and poured herself some vodka.  Craig walked in and announced that he and Rosanna were no longer enemies.  He took a call from his bank and learned that all the money in his accounts had been transferred to an account belonging to Rosanna Cabot.  Craig turned to Carly and announced that Rosanna had just robbed him blind.  He was furious that he had fallen for her phony peace offering at the same moment that she was ripping him off.\n\n\nRosanna took a call from Carly warning her that Craig was on the warpath.  Rosanna faked a migraine and said that she needed a holistic product from the health store, so Paul offered to get it.  Paul left on the errand, and Craig showed up at Fairwinds, as Rosanna had suspected he would.  He launched into a tirade about how she had set him up, and Rosanna agreed with him and smiled sweetly.\n\n\nAt the farm, Meg was having a tough time letting go of Dusty.  Damian consoled her by showering her with compliments.\n\n\n",
