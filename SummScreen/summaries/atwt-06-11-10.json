Craig remarked that Gabriel seemed to mimic Lucinda. \"He sounds just like a filthy rich woman of a certain age,\" Craig added. He accused her of manipulating Gabriel into railroading his father. Lucinda, who claimed that she had no time for games, assured Craig that there was no conspiracy; however, Craig stated, \"The lady doth protest too much.\"\n\n\nLucinda continued to deny it, and Craig threatened to call Lily down there to hear about her mother's exploits. Lucinda thought that he was desperate and guilty over his attempted filicide. She warned that his threats wouldn't work, but he responded that they already were.\n\n\nAfter Lucinda left, Craig faked a heart attack and punched out the guard who tried to assist him. Craig locked the guard in the cell and escaped the holding area.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Parker visited Liberty, who was living there with her mother while painters finished the house. Liberty was too afraid to look at her grades online. Parker checked them for her and congratulated her on being in the class of 2010.\n\n\nIn the lounge, Dusty calmed Janet's anxiety about whether Liberty would graduate. Liberty text-messaged Janet to say that they had to hustle, if they wanted to make it to the graduation ceremony. An ecstatic Janet raced upstairs to congratulate her daughter and thank Parker, who said he'd do anything for Liberty. The teens told Janet that Liberty would speak at the ceremony, and Janet decided to throw a party at Metro for the adults afterward.\n\n\nLiberty mentioned that the school was having a reception after the graduation that evening. Parker was unhappy that Liberty wanted Gabriel at the ceremony, but since it was her day, he decided to deal with it. Teri entered as Parker left, and Liberty received a floral delivery from Jack. Dusty arrived with flowers, too, and then he and Teri took off for Metro.\n\n\n       Later, Janet tearfully admired Liberty in her graduation garb. Janet realized that Liberty's childhood had been tough, but promised that the future would be smooth sailing.\n\n\n       At Metro, Dusty and Teri prepared for the party, and Teri wondered how Dusty felt about his situation with Janet. Dusty wished that Janet would wear his ring, but he knew that she wasn't ready. Teri figured that Janet would be ready if it weren't for the pregnancy.\n\n\nAcross town, Jack arrived on Carly's doorstep with an apology. They hugged and kissed, but tensions flared again when Jack conveyed that he'd questioned Gabriel more. Jack sensed that Gabriel was hiding something, and for Parker's sake, Jack had to discover what it was. Carly insisted that Craig was at fault, and Parker didn't do anything wrong. Jack urged her to let him prove that. He felt that if they were honest, they could help Parker through it.\n\n\n       At Lily's, Gabriel and Faith exchanged barbs about him drinking from the orange juice carton, and he assured her that he wouldn't live there forever. He inquired about Liberty and Parker's relationship, but Faith quipped that Liberty wouldn't go for a loser like Gabriel. Both their phones rang at once. Parker called Faith to invite her to the graduation, and Liberty called Gabriel to invite him, too. Once the calls ended, Carly arrived, requesting to talk with Gabriel.\n\n\nOutside, Carly urged Gabriel to stick with his story about Craig. She figured that it was the least that Gabriel could do for Parker after stealing from his trust fund. Gabriel insinuated that he hadn't a reason to change his story, and he hurried off.\n\n\nLater, Jack called Gabriel to the police station to discuss the inconsistencies in Gabriel's story. Under Jack's questioning, Gabriel couldn't explain why the glass figurine hadn't broken during the assault or why he didn't have two head injuries, one from Parker and one from Craig. As Gabriel stammered, Jack warned that Gabriel could go to jail for perjury. Gabriel insisted that he'd told the truth, and Craig should be punished.\n\n\nWhen Carly arrived home, Parker wondered if he and his parents would go together to Liberty's graduation. He panicked when Carly said that Jack would head there from the station. Parker worried that his parents had fought about him again, but Carly pretended that they hadn't.\n\n\nJust then, Faith arrived, and Carly went to change clothes. Parker complimented Faith, and she remarked that Gabriel's invitation to the graduation proved that Liberty was into Gabriel, so Parker should move on. Parker avoided the topic, and she went to the kitchen.\n\n\nGabriel arrived and warned Parker to call Jack off for Parker's own sake. Gabriel took off just as quickly as he'd arrived, and Parker confided in Faith that Gabriel might be lying to the police about Craig. Parker worried because he'd left Gabriel unconscious, and though Parker hadn't known about the fire, he could still go to jail. Faith didn't believe Jack would let that happen, but Parker reasoned that Jack might not have a choice. Parker also worried that Liberty shouldn't be spending time with a guy cold enough to set his father up for attempted murder.\n\n\nWhen Gabriel arrived back at Lily's, Lucinda gave him a stack of cash and told him to start a new life in a new town. He wasn't sure that he wanted to leave, and he considered telling Margo about Lucinda's bribe. \"Do you take me for an amateur?\" Lucinda asked. She claimed to know all the judges in town, and she assured him that he'd find himself digging ditches somewhere. She said that he could be incarcerated there or free somewhere else, but he had to decide right then. Gabriel tucked the cash into his book bag and left.\n\n\n       As Lucinda spoke on the phone later, Craig burst into the house. Craig ordered her to fix things with Gabriel, or Craig would start behaving like the monster that she feared him to be.\n\n\n       In the seats at graduation, Carly congratulated Janet, who responded by staring around as if something in the room stank. Carly asked Jack about Gabriel, and Jack whispered that the teen was sticking to his story.\n\n\nDuring Liberty's speech, she thanked her loved ones and her teachers for standing by her. She personally thanked Parker for his devotion to her. She said that the word \"friend\" wasn't enough to describe him. She rendered a heartfelt thanks to Janet, too, and said she'd always need her mother. Liberty wished that Brad could be there, because his insistence that she remain in school was the real reason that she'd graduated. She felt that her future was just as bright as the stars that Brad had said he'd be watching her from.\n\n\nAfter the ceremony, the reception for the graduates convened at the Lakeview. Gabriel showed up and asked Liberty to leave with him. She said that she couldn't duck out on her graduation party. A furious Parker ordered the lying Gabriel to stay away from Liberty. Parker claimed that Gabriel had set his own father up and threatened Parker to make Jack back off about it. While Liberty tried to figure out what was going on, Gabriel dared Parker to hit him again. Parker paused and then slugged Gabriel. The two began brawling in the lounge.\n\n\n       A teacher broke up the fight, and Liberty declared that Gabriel and Parker had ruined her day. She stomped out, and Gabriel followed. Parker tried to go, as well, but Faith told him that it wouldn't do him any good to chase after Liberty.\n\n\n       At Metro, Carly looked uneasy as Jack toasted to Janet for being a \"hell of a lady\" and a great mother. Janet thanked everyone for accepting her and Liberty into their lives. Dusty and Carly frowned when Jack and Janet hugged. Carly and Jack departed, and Teri whispered to Dusty to convince Janet to marry him. Teri watched the couple dance, and Dusty stealthily pulled the engagement ring from his pocket.\n\n\n       Just then, Parker burst into Metro to tell Janet that Liberty had taken off with Gabriel after a fight at the reception. Janet broke away from Dusty, who slipped the ring back into his pocket. Janet exclaimed that they had to find Liberty before something bad happened again.\n\n\nJack took Carly home, and as he slowly turned to leave, she offered him coffee. He said he'd love some, and he'd enjoyed being with her during the happy occasion that day. His phone rang, and she scowled when he answered it. During the call, Janet filled Jack in about the fight, and he and Carly took off to help find Liberty and Gabriel.\n\n\n       At Brad's grave, Liberty sobbed that she missed father, and nothing had gone right without him. Gabriel approached to apologize for ruining her party, but he'd wanted to say goodbye, because he was leaving town. Liberty assumed that Parker had been right, and Gabriel was fleeing from his lies about Craig. She sobbed that Craig wasn't perfect, but he was alive, unlike Brad. She claimed that she'd do anything to have her father with her.\n\n\n       Gabriel said that he didn't know what else to do, but Liberty urged him to tell the truth. She said that Gabriel's childhood pain was in the past, and Craig hadn't intentionally left Gabriel as a child. She felt that it was wrong to make Craig suffer for a crime he didn't commit. \n\n\n\n\n",
