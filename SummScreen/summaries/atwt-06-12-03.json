Alison pops her head around the corner and is stunned to see that Gordo has his hands in her trash.  She asks, \" What are you doing?\"  Dr. Gordon says that he was just throwing some napkins away.  Alison says that you don't sort through trash to throw some napkins away.  She takes the trashcan away and digs down and finds the vial that Gordo was trying to hide.  She looks at it and says, \"This is the vial that everyone is looking for.  Why did you bring it over here and why didn't you tell the cops about it?\"\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Rose loses Lily on the cell phone.  She decides to tell Margo and heads for the door.

Rose looks at her sister and asks, \"Do you hate me?\"  Lily tells her that she could never hate her.  Rose apologizes to Lily for all the awful things she had said to her.  Lily tells Rose that they do have one thing in common and that is they are tough broads.  Rose starts to hug Lily and Lily winces.  Rose asks her what is wrong and Lily tells her about trying to climb out of the well and she fell and hurt her shoulder.  Rose says that it should be her shoulder that is hurt.  Then she adds that she should be the one in the well by herself.  Lily tells her not to say that.  Rose says that Lily has kids and she should be with her kids.  Lily says that her kids will be fine and soon her kids and their Aunt Rose will be going home.  Lily tells Rose to promise her that if she has a chance to get away that she will take it.
