Carly left to talk with Lily to see if they could make it an all-girls adventure. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Holden learned that Lily would not be able to accompany him and their girls to camp because Lucinda had made a financial appointment for Lily that could not be postponed. The couple discussed the best way to handle the trip, and when Carly arrived, they told her they would work it out somehow and let her know which of them was going. \n\n\nLisa talked to Alison and gave her a hard time about filing suit against Memorial and Chris. Bob intervened and told Lisa to stop. Then Bob advised Alison that he was willing to ask Tom to propose a settlement if Alison would tell him what she wanted. Alison said she wanted first to return to the nursing program and secondly, she would like Chris to leave Memorial Hospital permanently. Those were her terms, and she was adamant. She also explained her terms to her mother, Susan. When Chris heard the terms from Dr. Bob, he was fearful that his father would fire him. He referred to himself as a \"sacrificial lamb,\" and Bob offered him the choice of staying and fighting the lawsuit or leaving and starting over somewhere else. \n\n\nKatie came home and was shocked to find that Juicy Janet had apparently moved in. Brad arrived and was surprised to find his wife there. Katie was early, and Brad had not warned her of the arrangements with Janet. Katie demanded an explanation immediately, and when Brad fumbled with his lame rationale, Katie refused him a welcome home kiss. Janet came in and further insulted Katie by offering her cooking lessons, which Katie refused. Then Katie discovered that Janet had worn one of Katie's dresses during an appearance she made with Brad on \"Oakdale Today.\" Katie was furious that Brad's ex seemed to have taken over her life! \n\n\nHolden and Carly ended up as the adults accompanying the Snyder girls to Camp Chapawee. They prompted Faith to sing the camp song, which she taught to the other girls. After several hours of singing, the campers arrived at their destination and met the Camp Director, Ms. Winkilemeyer, a.k.a \"Winkie,\" who turned out to be quite a character. She presented the girls with her home remedy mosquito repellent and a drawing so that the campers could identify poison oak. Winkie also told \"Mr. and Mrs. Snyder\" that they would be bunking together in one of the nicer cabins. She obviously thought they were a couple. \n\n\nJanet finally left Katie and Brad alone and ran into Jack in Old Town. She asked him to talk to Katie because, in her opinion, Brad was not happy. Jack was reluctant to do so. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Chris locked Alison in a room with him and berated her. Alison defended herself, but when Chris insulted her by correcting her grammar, she told him to go to hell. She also threatened to yell for help and call the cops if he did not release her immediately. Chris opened the door and Alison ran out and bumped into her mother. \n\n\nAt Camp Chapawee, Winkie assembled all the campers for dinner, so Holden and Carly went to explore their cabin, which sported bunk beds. \"Top or bottom?\" Carly asked Holden. Holden suggested they leave immediately and drive back to Oakdale that night, but Carly said she wanted to see how Sage did at camp that night. Holden then volunteered to sleep in the car, but Carly talked him into staying in the cabin. \n\n\nKatie was continuing her rant about Janet until finally Brad promised to meet Janet and tell her she could no longer stay at the house. He arranged to meet her at the Lakeview where he settled her old bill there and told Janet she was on her own. Janet promptly checked back in to the hotel and dashed away. \n\n\nWhen Winkie announced \"Lights out!\" at camp, Holden and Carly snuck back to Holden's car and retrieved some beer. Winkie caught them, however, and confiscated their contraband. Carly had a bottle hidden in her top, so they had one drink to share. Lily called and created an awkward moment for the couple, but they decided to make the most of it. They played cards until Carly got sleepy. She chose the top bunk and she and Holden had a close moment as he helped her into her bunk. Holden then lay in the bottom bed, but he did not sleep. \n\n\nJanet showed up at Carly's house where Jack was watching JJ. She offered him a tureen of chicken soup to make JJ feel better. She asked him if he knew how to heat things up, and Jack smiled. \n\n\nBrad returned home to find Katie throwing out all of Janet's food. Brad soothed her and finally was able to give her that welcome home kiss. \n\n\n",

Janet later comes by the house to apologize to Jack for putting him on the spot about Katie she also brings chicken soup for J.J. Allison tells Bob she won't go to court if she is reinstated in the nursing program and Chris is fired. Bob advises Chris to either fight the lawsuit or find a job opportunity in another state. Chris decides to fight the lawsuit but makes things worse for himself by locking Allison in the on call room and telling her she is unbalanced , has a terrible past, and she will lose in court.
