    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the cabin in Montana, Mike and Jack start to bicker again about Carly and the baby, when Carly kicks both boys and Katie out.  Hannah helps shuffle everyone out the door, then examines Carly.  Hannah says Carly is almost ready to give birth, so she needs to relax and prepare.  \n\n\nOutside, Mike whittles a gift for the baby.  Katie tries to focus the two guys on making Carly comfortable.  She has an idea about throwing Carly a party based on something she read in a Native American birthing ritual book.\n\n\nLater, Katie starts to set up for a \"blessing way\" while Carly is resting in bed.  Hannah says that it's kind of like a Native American baby shower, then excuses herself to run some errands.  Carly thinks it's a sweet idea.  Mike comes in with a bundle of flowers and Katie asks him to put them at Carly's feet.  Jack gives Katie some stones and she places them all around Carly on the bed.  Katie pulls out some beads and gives one to each person to make a wish for Carly and the baby, with the intention that later, Carly would string the beads together and wear it as a necklace.  Jack makes his wish first.  \"I'll make sure this baby never has to fight and that she'll be given everything she'll ever need.\"  Mike can't hold his tongue and says, \"Kinda jumping the gun aren't ya Jack?\"  Carly and Katie try to stop him, but Mike has to say his peace.  Mike says he'll find a way to live with Carly choosing Jack over him to be her labor partner, but the baby is most likely his.  Jack blows up and screams at Mike, \"What is it you want!\"  Carly shh's them both and says, \"I'm going to tell you both what I want!  I want Jack to be this baby's father, even if it's biologically proven to be Mike's.\"  She says the baby will have two separate fathers with double the love.  Mike doesn't like what he hears.  \"Sorry Carly, it's not that simple.  I don't doubt that the two of you love each other, but your relationship could end tomorrow, or in two years, or in five years.\"  He wonders how his daughter might react when Jack disappears all of a sudden.  He turns to Carly and says, \"You've gotta come up with a plan B.\"  Then he turns to Jack and says, \"Going through the motions of being a father, does not turn you into one.\"  This gets to Jack, and he humbly excuses himself to get some firewood.  Mike follows him out.  Carly laments to Katie about the situation.  \"I wanted this baby to be about me and Jack, about us finding our way back to each other.\"  Her eye twitches, and then she gently clutches her stomach as if her water just broke.  Katie comforts her, unaware of Carly's condition.  Carly wants to have some time alone with Jack, and Katie manages to get Mike to take her to the store.  Jack and Carly take the time alone to snuggle up together.  Jack wishes it could be just the three of them when the baby comes.  Carly says he'll get his wish because her water broke just a few minutes ago.  Katie and Mike are out driving the range, looking for a carton of milk, when their truck suddenly runs out of gas.\n\n\nAlison confronts Gordo about the missing medicine bottle he tried to stash in her family's trash can.  He says he can explain everything if only she would give him the bottle.  He says it's no big deal.  Alison says, \"If it's no big deal, then I'll take it back to the hospital myself.\"  She runs around the couch, but Gordo stops her and says, \"I'm sorry.  You're not going anywhere.\"  She wants to know why he won't turn the bottle over to the police.  He says he thought Dr. Hughs dropped the bottle, so he was covering for him.  He's also been in hot water lately.  He asks her to cut him some slack, when Susan and Dr. Decker come home.  Alison says that she's tired, and Susan suggests that the two of them get together another time.  Alison shuffles Gordo out the door, and as soon as he's gone, she yells, \"MOM!  Come quick!\"  She shows her mom the bottle.  Dr. Decker says they should get the bottle to the police right away.\n\n\nLily and Rose try to stay positive while trapped down the well.  Rose reminds Lily of Luke and Faith opening up Christmas presents, and of Holden and Emma.  They are interrupted with a walkie-talkie announcement that a package is being sent down.  The bucket arrives, and Lily finds a brush and lipstick.  Rose thinks it must mean they need to look good because they're going home soon.\n\n\nHolden arrives at the station and finds out that Rose has also been taken.  Margo plays the tape of Spangler demanding that Dusty make the drop off.  Holden seethes, \"You're not going anywhere near that money.\"  Lucinda arrives with a suitcase full of cash.  ($10 million in small bills?  Probably not.)  Holden says he's going to make the drop.  Lucinda nearly feints when she learns Rose has also been kidnapped.  Margo wants to call for a FBI negotiator.  Lucinda steps forward and tells everyone to let Dusty make the drop.  Margo thinks she's crazy and that Dusty will take her for every penny in the suitcase.  Lucinda doesn't care.  She knows it's a crapshoot.  \"I can make more money.  Lily is irreplaceable and priceless.  And Rose too.\"  The phone rings, and Spangler tells them that Dusty should meet him at the drop point in thirty minutes.  Margo lets Holden make the final decision and he reluctantly chooses to let Dusty make the drop.\n\n\nSusan, Dr. Decker, and Alison all catch up with Hal and the forensic pathologist at the hospital.  Alison gives them the missing empty bottle of potassium chloride.  The doctor takes the bottle to run some tests.\n\n\nGordo catches up with Dr. Hughs at Java Underground.  He apologizes for some of his recent outbursts.  Dr. Hughs accepts his apology and they vow to move forward.  Hal walks in and takes Gordo down to the station for further questioning.\n\n\nDusty arrives on a rooftop and calls out for Spangler.  The kidnapper slips out of the shadows after he feels its safe.  Dusty says, \"It's just us.  I give you my word.  Let's do business.\"\n\n\n",
