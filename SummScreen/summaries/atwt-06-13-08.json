When Sofie asked why Cole wanted to help, he said he felt responsible for having left her in a vulnerable emotional state when he broke up with her. Cole then told Sofie that she had too many lies in her past for someone who was accusing someone else of rape, and she needed to move fast before Paul could find out much about her. \n\n\nMeg met Paul in Old Town and told him Mike had found out where Sofie had gone to high school in Winnetka. Meg and Paul traveled to Winnetka, where they went to the Catholic school and spoke to the nun in charge. Meg and Paul claimed to be married and said they were checking out the school because they wanted their daughter to go there, having heard from a friend how wonderful the school was. Meg said she had lost touch with the friend and wanted her daughter to be able to talk to her about the school. The nun offered to check the alumni database, but when given Sofie's name, she said they had never had a student with the last name \"Duran.\" \n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Meg went to the Lakeview and told Sofie that she knew Sofie had lied about other things, like where she'd gone to school, and that she was lying about the rape charge. Meg told Sofie to tell the truth, or she would take Sofie's life and tear it apart. \n\n\nMeg went downstairs, where the desk clerk told her Barbara had left word that she wanted to see Meg. Meg called Paul and told him she thought things had gone well but that she had to go see Barbara and was glad to have good news for her. Paul asked what news, and Meg replied that the whole nightmare with Sofie was over. She hung up as Paul tried to get more details, but when Paul turned around, he saw Sofie standing in his doorway. \n\n\nSofie begged Paul to talk to her, telling him that Meg had said she was going to rip her life apart. As Sofie panicked, asking Paul what she was supposed to do without him and without her baby, and blaming herself for what had happened, Paul said it wasn't all her fault. Paul said he had let Sofie think things that weren't true and had led her on. Sofie was relieved to find out that Paul didn't hate her, because if he did, she wouldn't be able to go on. Paul told her not to talk like that and said he could never hate her, that he of all people understood she had made mistakes and had snapped. \n\n\nSofie told Paul she didn't want him to feel sorry for her, because Meg had said that was what Sofie did: she made people feel sorry for her and then hurt them. Sofie said she didn't want to be like that. Paul told Sofie she needed a fresh start and should leave everything behind except her jewelry business. Sofie said she'd had that chance but had blown it. Paul wrote Sofie a check for $100,000 and gave it to her, saying he was rewinding everything to a point before it had gotten messed up so badly, and that if she took the check, they could both start living their lives again. \n\n\nSofie took Paul's check and went to the police station with it, where she asked to speak to Margo. \n\n\nMeg stopped at the desk at the Lakeview and told the desk clerk that Barbara said she hadn't asked him to give Meg a message. Meg asked when the desk clerk had gotten the message, and he said it had been right before Meg had come down earlier. Meg realized that meant it had been Sofie who had left the message for her, and she rushed over to Fairwinds. Paul told her how he'd gotten rid of Sofie. Meg couldn't believe Paul had done something that made it look like he was paying Sofie off. Paul said he had used Sofie and had wanted to make things right; Meg said she loved Paul for that, but he shouldn't do anything like that again. They kissed. \n\n\nParker told Jack he wouldn't feel right going to camp if JJ had to stay home, but Jack guessed the real reason Parker didn't want to go to camp was that he wanted to stay in Oakdale because of the girl he'd told Jack about. Parker said it had nothing to do with the girl but that he had gotten a job as a counselor at a local tennis camp. Jack was proud of Parker for showing such initiative. \n\n\nLiberty went to the diner to meet Janet, who asked her to take Brad's tee shirt (the one Janet had slept in) back to Brad's house without Katie seeing it. Janet claimed she didn't want to make any trouble, but Liberty said Janet lived for trouble. Janet invited Liberty to spend the morning with her after her shift ended, but Liberty reminded Janet that she had signed up for summer school. Liberty left to go to school, and Janet pondered what to do with her free time. She tried to get an extra shift but was told by the manager to go home. \n\n\nAt summer school, Liberty ran into Parker, who told her he'd gotten the job at the tennis camp. Liberty asked if Parker even knew how to play tennis, and Parker said it couldn't be very hard. Liberty said, \"Wanna bet?\" and Parker replied, \"Yeah, maybe I do.\" When they got to the tennis court, it became apparent that Parker was actually a very good player. Parker won the set, and Liberty asked for a rematch. Parker asked if she meant a rematch of tennis or kissing. Liberty told Parker he was \"the guy who ends up alone,\" as Dylan walked onto the tennis court to pick her up for a movie date. \n\n\nJanet decided to go check on JJ and Jack. She asked Jack how JJ was doing and then said she was there to pick up the soup tureen she'd left the night before. JJ called out to Jack from upstairs, and Janet told Jack to go see what JJ needed, and she would get the tureen herself. Jack told her where it was in the kitchen. When Janet saw the mess in the kitchen, she said to herself, \"Oh, yeah-you're Brad's brother, all right!\" \n\n\nWhen Jack came downstairs, he found Janet in a well-cleaned kitchen, with a pot of spaghetti sauce simmering on the stove. Jack asked Janet why she'd done so much, and Janet said because JJ was sick, and it looked like Jack needed help. Then she realized she might have crossed a line, so she told Jack she'd get out of his hair. Jack told Janet she didn't have to leave, but he had been concerned she might be trying to involve him in some plot to win Brad's affections. Janet made fun of that idea, saying cleaning Jack's kitchen was her big plot to steal Brad away from Katie. Jack thanked her for her help; Janet told Jack that he was Liberty's uncle, and she wanted Liberty to get to know her extended family. \n\n\nJJ came downstairs complaining about his throat hurting. Jack said he couldn't have another pill for a couple of hours, but Janet said she knew exactly what to do. Janet's solution was to give JJ a Popsicle, which helped his throat feel better, which in turn made Jack grateful. Janet then asked Jack why the house looked completely different from what she would expect of a single-parent cop. Jack explained that it was his ex-wife's house, and Janet thought he meant Katie, but he told her it was Carly's house. Janet asked where he lived when he wasn't staying there, and Jack said at his aunt Emma's farm with his cousin and everybody else. Janet asked if that meant his cousin was also divorced, but Jack said Holden was just temporarily separated from Lily. \n\n\nJanet told Jack he needed a place of his own and that she would help him out by providing home cooking, if that was what he was lacking, because he should be back out in circulation in the dating world. Parker arrived home, and Janet realized he was Jack's son, too. She asked Parker if he remembered her, and he said he did, and then he rushed past her. Jack apologized, but Janet told him not to worry, and she said goodbye. \n\n\nJack asked Parker what was wrong, and Parker asked if it was too late to change his mind and go to summer camp after all. Jack said it was too late, because he'd already called and gotten his deposit back. JJ came downstairs and said he thought the popsicle had made him sick again, and Jack said out loud that Carly could come home anytime she wanted. \n\n\nAt camp, Carly and Holden got up when the bugle blew reveille. Carly tried to jump down from the top bunk bed but stumbled and fell into Holden's waiting arms. They were then summoned to the pancake-eating breakfast contest by counselor Winkie, and afterwards, they learned that the girls had signed them up for the three-legged race. Faith, kidding around because Winkie had assumed that Carly and Holden were married, said it was a rule that married people had to race together. \n\n\nAfter more adventures at camp, which Sage took pictures of, it was time to say goodbye. Holden noticed that Sage was having a hard time saying goodbye, and he sent Faith and Natalie over to distract her. The girls told Sage she had to go get ready for the camp talent show, and Sage left with her cousins. Holden and Carly left in Holden's car, and somewhere along the way, Carly asked Holden to pull over so they could enjoy the view. As they looked at the view, and at each other, they suddenly heard the squeal of tires and realized that someone was stealing Holden's car. \n\n\nBecause both Carly and Holden's cell phones were in Holden's car, and it was 20 miles back to the camp, Carly stuck out her thumb to try to hitch a ride. She had no luck, so Holden gave it a try, and a woman stopped and gave them a ride, flirting with Holden the whole way while Carly sat in the back seat. Carly told the woman to stop when she suddenly spotted Holden's car abandoned on the side of the road. Carly checked the car and found out the thieves had taken their money, cell phones, and car keys. The woman who had given them the ride had driven off already, so Holden hot-wired the car. Carly asked if Holden could show her how to do that in case she ever got stuck like that again, and Holden said he could. As he was showing Carly what to do, their faces were very close to one another, and Holden told Carly she was \"so beautiful\" and moved towards her to kiss her.\n \n\n\n\n\n",
