Will introduces Gwen to his Uncle Bob and tells him that Gwen is the reason he was asking all those questions about pregnancy.  Bob is very kind to Gwen and asks her if she has seen a doctor.  Since she hasn't, he lines up an appointment with Dr. Schiller.  While Gwen is with Dr. Schiller, Bob talks with Will about Gwen - he assumes the baby is Will's, but Will insists that they are just friends and he is trying to help her.  Inside the exam room, Dr. Schiller shows Gwen a sonogram of her baby.  When the doctor leaves the room, she talks with Bob and Will about the baby's condition.  The baby is much farther along than Dr. Schiller had guessed and she is concerned about the baby's small size and Gwen's health.  Dr. Schiller leaves to see another patient, but Bob talks with her about some options and offers to help her talk with her parents.  Gwen tells him that she took her stepfather and mother to court and has been emancipated from them for a year now.  She asks him what she should do....he tells her that if she were his daughter, he would want her to continue her education.  And since she has no family and no support, it will be difficult to do with a baby.....he suggests adoption.  When Will takes her home, he shows her the brochure on adoption, but instead she reaches for a cigarette.  Will leaves and she takes out the photo of the baby.....and smiles.\n\n\nCasey takes Celia to the Country Club assuming they can get summer jobs.  They are first told no, the jobs had been filled last spring, but when Casey sees his grandmother, he asks Kim for help.  Within moments, they both have jobs.  The three sit down for some iced tea and conversation.  Celia is very worried about why Gwen was in the hospital with Will.  She's afraid she might be sick, and asks Kim if she can ask Bob. Casey is really angry and tells her it's a privacy issue and that she should leave it alone.  Any mention of Gwen makes him very angry.  Kim tells Celia that she can at least ask Bob if he knows anything about Gwen, and if it's a privacy issue, he will simply tell her he can't talk about it.  Celia is happy to have Kim's help, but Casey clearly wishes she's leave Gwen alone.\n\n\nKatie and Mike see Craig talking to Jessica at Metro.  Craig has asked Jessica how he can get soul custody of Jennifer's baby - she tells him no way.  He then asks how to get joint custody - she laughs and tells him that he would have to go to family court and show that he would be a good parent.  Jessica really isn't interested in helping Craig, because, as he admits, he has an \"image\" problem.  She does suggest some things that would help him look like a good parent in family court - gainful employment, a stable family life..... Craig asks him if marriage would help.  She says maybe, but isn't convinced.  Craig insists there must be a way to get Jennifer's baby since he is the father.  Jessica leaves and Katie goes to Craig.  She tells him that she will no longer support him if he does not leave Jennifer alone.  Craig tells her - again - that he is the baby's father and wants to assert his rights, and he brushes her off.  Katie is very hurt, but Mike comes to talk with her.  Mike wants her to go to Jennifer and tell her what just happened with Craig.  Katie doesn't want to - hasn't she been hurt enough?  Jennifer reams her over the coals every time she sees her - why should she put herself up for more abuse?  Mike convinces her that Jennifer should hear it from her, though, and so Katie goes to Jennifer and tells her that she told Craig she would no longer support him if he didn't leave her alone.  Jennifer has a nasty retort, and Katie leaves.  Mike goes to comfort Jennifer.\n\n\nCarly tells Jack that she is quitting her job with Dusty and Jennifer to be a stay-at-home mom.  Jack laughs in her face!  He knows his wife very well and thinks that while she is a great mom that being at home full-time with the kids will drive her crazy.  Carly insists she wants to do it, but she doesn't know that Jack has a surprise in store for her.  The doorbell rings and it is Hannah, their friend from Montana.  Carly is thrilled to see her and even more excited to hear that Jack has asked her to come to help with the family.   \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jen is upset with Mike for thinking Craig should have any part of their baby's life, and with Katie, who is always insinuating herself into Mike and her life. Jen goes back to work and blows up telling Dusty about what Craig did, and what happened after. Dusty sides with Jen, and agrees that Craig is a big danger to his own children. He comes up with a plan on how to keep Craig away from Jen. Craig talks to Jessica about his options for his unborn child. Katie and Mike see him, and confront him. Katie tells Craig she will no longer support him if he continues on this path. Mike and Katie later seek out Jen and told her what Katie did, and Katie further promises to keep her distance. Jen thanks her, and Katie leaves, but sadly looks on as she sees Mike and Jen hugging. Gwen and Will arrive at the hospital for her baby's check up, and bump into Casey and Celia. Gwen and Will use the excuse that they are there to check on Jen, who is there for an appointment. Bob meets Gwen, and makes her an appointment with an OB/GYN, Dr, Schiller. Bob is very sensitive with Gwen and immediately puts her at ease. Later he questions Will whether he is the baby's father. Will assures Bob he is only there as Gwen's friend. During her ultrasound, the doctor asks Gwen if she wants to know the baby's sex? Gwen does not want to know. She also asks Gwen if she wants the printout of the sonogram, to which again Gwen answers, no. Gwen is told the baby is a little small, and they counsel her how to take better care of herself. Bob offers his support since she does not have parents to rely on. Gwen later finds out Bob is Casey's grandfather. Later, at her apartment, Gwen frustrates Will when she lights up a cigarette. After Will leaves, Gwen takes out the sonogram, and looks happily at the picture. A happy Casey and Celia get summer jobs at the Country Club, thanks to Kim, so now they can spend much of their time together. Celia continually obsesses on what could be wrong with Gwen, much to Casey's frustration. Celia asks Kim if she can ask Bob if Gwen is sick. Kim promises to do what she can, without infringing on patient confidentiality. Carly tells a surprised Jack she is quitting her job at Street Jeans. Jack wants her to reconsider because he wonders if she spends all her time at home, and not designing anymore, she may resent her life. Carly assures him that will never happen, and leaves to go speak to Dusty. Later on back at home, Jack surprises Carly by bringing Hannah, her midwife from Montana, to their home as extra support for Carly.",
