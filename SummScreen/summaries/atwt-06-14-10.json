    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Metro, Parker, Janet, and Dusty made calls to try to locate Liberty, who had taken off with Gabriel after a fight at the graduation party.  Jack and Carly also arrived and learned that Parker and Gabriel had fought at the party, and Liberty had fled with Gabriel.  Jack called the patrol cops and asked them to keep an eye out for the teens, and Parker offered to call MacKenzie and a couple of Liberty's other friends.  Dusty and Janet decided to take a drive to see if they could spot the pair around Oakdale.\n\n\nParker was especially upset, so his parents attempted to calm him down.  The boy blamed himself for Liberty's taking off with his nemesis.  Jack asked Parker to email him a picture of Liberty, and he took off for the police station.  Carly told Parker that he was going home with her, and she marched him out.  When they got home, Carly suggested that Parker was jealous of Gabriel's attentions to Liberty, and her son said that was his initial story, but it wasn't true.  Parker said he had told Gabriel that he was a liar in front of everyone at the party, and Carly was shocked that her son didn't realize that it implicated him, as well.\n\n\nCarly urged Parker to hang on for a bit longer and let Gabriel stick to his story.  Parker rushed to the door to go find the teens, but Carly said she couldn't let him do that.  She reminded him that Jack was already suspicious but really didn't know anything definite that would make him have to choose between his badge and Parker.  Parker complained that it didn't feel right to keep secrets from his dad, and he agreed that Craig and Gabriel had done some things wrong, but so had he.  Carly asked her son to keep quiet for her sake.  Parker barked at his mother to stop pushing him because he didn't know what he was going to do.  He wanted to search for Liberty, and he refused to promise anything until he knew she was all right.  He avoided Carly and dashed out the door.\n\n\nGabriel trailed Liberty to the cemetery where Brad was buried, and he found her at her father's grave.  They talked about the girl's initial anger when she had first met her dad, and she recounted how reluctant she had been to have a second chance with him.  She was grateful for that since they had ended up having very little time together before his death.  Gabriel said that Craig was very different from Brad, because he was a liar who played people to get what he wanted.  Liberty accused Gabriel of doing just what Craig had done: stealing Parker's trust fund.  Gabriel had also lied by making up the story about Craig's attack on him.\n\n\nLiberty had another card to play with Gabriel.  She mentioned the effect that a long jail sentence for Craig would have on Johnny.  Gabriel was afraid it was too late to tell the truth, but Liberty admitted that she would miss the boy if he skipped town and disappeared.  Gabriel kissed Liberty and asked her to go with him.  Instead of fleeing, they returned to the Lakeview, but the party was over.  Gabriel suggested that the two of them go up to Craig's suite, since he had a key and Craig was in jail.  Liberty was uneasy about that, but Gabriel assured her that nothing would happen that she didn't want to happen.\n\n\nLiberty admitted that she had never felt unsafe with Gabriel, so she agreed to go upstairs as long as the boy was willing to just talk.  They waited by the elevator as Faith approached the lobby desk and asked if her mother was in the hotel.  When the clerk left to go see if Lily was in the office, Faith spied Liberty and Gabriel getting on the elevator.  \"What a slut!\" murmured Faith.\n\n\nIn the jail, Margo discovered an officer down in Craig's cell and no sign of her brother.  Meanwhile, Craig wrestled with Lucinda in her office at Worldwide, and he demanded to know what she had given to Gabriel as a bribe for his lie against his father.  Lucinda threw back Craig's rotten treatment of Sierra and his seducing the maid in Montega, as Craig shook the woman and tied her to her chair with a telephone cord.  He outlined the myriad of ways he had of hurting her and said how much it pained him to have to let her live in case Gabriel retracted his statement.  Craig stuffed Lucinda's scarf into her mouth as a gag and told her she could thank him later.\n\n\nFaith arrived some time later at her grandmother's office and found Lucinda trussed up in her chair.  The girl freed her and explained about the fight at the graduation party.  Faith was concerned that Gabriel might have made up the whole story about Craig because he hated him so much, and Lucinda was furious at Lily for not honoring Lydia Carras' wishes that the boy never find out who his father was.  Lucinda sent her granddaughter to Lily's to make sure that Craig did not go after her, as well.\n\n\nDusty and Janet checked out the cemetery, but there was no sign of Liberty.  Janet was frantic, but Dusty talked her down and suggested that they return to the hotel.  Janet looked more closely at Brad's grave, and she noticed a white rose from the bouquet that Dusty had given the girl for her graduation.  Janet was relieved that Liberty had talked things over with her dad, but it also made her upset.  Suddenly she grabbed her stomach and said, \"Something is wrong.\"\n\n\nAt Memorial, Janet said her cramps were better, and she prayed for the wellbeing of her daughter and her unborn baby.  Dusty offered to call Jack, but Janet did not want to worry him.  She thought that God was telling her not to be so selfish but to be more responsible for the little life inside her.  Dusty reassured her that she was already a great mom, but Janet was feeling guilty that Liberty had never had enough time to be a kid and had to grow up too fast.  The doctor joined them and performed a sonogram.  Just as he was about to give her the results, Janet's phone rang. The caller was Liberty, who said she was fine, but her mother told the girl to meet her in a short while in the Lakeview.  Liberty, who was already there in Craig's suite with Gabriel, did not tip her hand but agreed to meet her mother.\n\n\nThe doctor said he saw no reason for alarm with the cramps, and he declared that Janet's \"little boy\" was just fine.  Janet and Dusty were overjoyed that it was a boy, but Dusty was sorry that Jack was not there to hear the news firsthand.  Janet said that was okay, and Dusty couldn't wait to tell Johnny that he was having a little brother.  Janet commented how much she appreciated her \"inheritance\" from her \"Pop,\" and she hugged Dusty.\n\n\nMargo got the details of Craig's escape from the cop when he regained consciousness, and she suggested that if he fell for old \"heart attack ploy,\" he needed to re-read the manual while he was on disciplinary leave.  Jack arrived, and Margo grumbled that, once again, Craig had escaped and was his own worst enemy.  Lucinda stormed into the station and announced that Craig had attacked her at her office, and she shouted that she wanted to press charges.  They went into the interview room, and she gave a dramatic account of the incident with Craig.  Margo could not understand why all of a sudden Craig was so outraged at Lucinda when he had known about Gabriel's parentage for a while.\n\n\nIn Craig's suite at the Lakeview, the teens sat on the couch, and Gabriel apologized for ruining Liberty's graduation party.  He called her \"one of the most beautiful people\" he had ever met.  Gabriel tried to kiss Liberty, but she pushed him away and admitted that she had gotten pregnant the year before but had lost the baby.  She declared that sex was not casual for her, and Gabriel said he got it.  He asked if they could hold each other for a while, and Liberty agreed.  She snuggled next to Gabriel on the couch, as Craig burst into the room and was astonished to find two teens on his couch.\n\n\nCraig claimed that he had been released from jail on a technicality, so Gabriel asked for specifics.  Craig lied and said the police had not properly \"Mirandized\" him, but Gabriel didn't buy it.  Finally Craig admitted that he had sneaked out just to look for the boy.  He said he wanted a chat with his son, but Gabriel pulled out his phone and announced he was calling the cops.  Craig grabbed the phone, however, and asked Gabriel to listen.  He said he felt just as \"cheated\" as Gabriel did about their relationship.  He accused Lucinda of bribing Gabriel to tell the one lie that would get Craig locked up for good.  Liberty asked if that was true, as Craig went on to say that he and Gabriel were \"family.\"\n\n\nGabriel responded, \"So what?\" and Craig mentioned that the boy was still mourning his mother's death.  Craig handed Gabriel his phone, and the boy wasted no time in calling the Oakdale police station and reporting an escaped prisoner.  Craig grabbed a hooded sweatshirt and walked out to the elevator.  Liberty seconded what Craig had said to Gabriel and agreed that the boy was scared and very much alone.  She urged him to go after Craig, who was just exiting the elevator in the lobby.  His sister, Margo, was waiting for him, and she stepped forward and said, \"End of the line, brother.\"\n\n\nMargo led Craig into the station, and Lucinda yelled, \"Bravo!\"  Craig told her to stuff her scarf in it and said he should have killed her when he had the chance.  Craig then told Margo that Lucinda had put Gabriel up to lying about Craig's attack on him, but Lucinda denied it.  Margo escorted Craig into the interview room and said he was still facing arson charges and, thanks to Lucinda, also assault charges.\n\n\nLucinda decided to leave when Jack began interrogating her about Gabriel's statements, but Liberty and Gabriel walked in before she could get out the door.  Lucinda whispered to Gabriel, \"We had a deal,\" but Gabriel shoved right past her.  He asked to speak with Jack.\n\n\nParker ended up at Java, where he found Faith.  He said he had not found Liberty yet, but he was going crazy thinking that she might be with Gabriel.  Faith flashed back on the scene of Gabriel and Liberty getting in the elevator at the hotel, and Parker asked if she knew where Liberty was.\n\n\nJack took a call from Carly, and he told her that Liberty and Gabriel were at the station.  He said Gabriel had something to tell him. Carly shouted that she was on her way, and she hung up in a hurry.  Jack got Margo and Craig from the interview room and then asked Gabriel to repeat what he had just said.  The boy said that on the day of the fire, Craig had not hit him.  He admitted that he had given a false story.\n\n\n",
