Meg reminded him, however, that the agreement meant that he got to spend time with their daughter, not with her.  Paul played with Eliza, as Meg intercepted a visit from Lily and Damian.  Meg told Lily that even being in the same room with Paul disturbed her, so Damian suggested that Meg go with him for the day, while Lily kept an eye on the baby.  Meg was reluctant, but Damian convinced her that a break would be good for her.\n\n\nMeg and Damian left, and Lily went inside to tell Paul what was happening.  Paul knew that Lily was there to watch him with the baby, but he was willing to play by Meg's rules.  Faith arrived to ask her mother for money for the movies, and she asked Paul why he had taken Eliza away from Meg.  Paul said his feelings had been hurt, and he had not been thinking clearly.  Faith said Paul had always been nice to her when she was a child.\n\n\nCraig called on Rosanna at Fairwinds and spoke with her about the hit-and-run accident.  Rosanna already knew about it from Margo, who had informed her of Craig's involvement.  Craig told Rosanna that he no longer cared to press charges against her, so if she returned the money from his accounts to him, she was off the hook.  Rosanna questioned Craig's motives, but Craig cautioned her not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He only asked that she tell her sister that Craig had done something nice for Rosanna, and he urged Rosanna to make sure that Carly knew she could count on her sister for help.\n\n\nCarly awoke on the couch with the mother of all hangovers.  Parker had been looking after her, and he told her that no matter how awful she felt, she could count on Craig's feeling worse.  Carly had no memory of nearly killing Craig with her car the day before, so Parker reminded her of how she had aimed her car directly at him.  Carly was shocked to think that she had done something so horrible.  Parker said that, so far, only the three of them knew what had happened.\n\n\nCarly swore off drinking and promised such a mistake would never happen again.  Parker told his mother that she was in real trouble, and he was frightened.  She declared that she was fine, and urged her son to go have fun while she got cleaned up.  Parker left the house, and Carly was heading upstairs when the doorbell rang.  Carly let in Rosanna, who said she was there to deliver the message that Craig had done something nice for Rosanna, despite what Carly had done.  Carly pretended not to know what he was referring to, but Rosanna admitted that she knew about the hit-and-run incident.\n\n\nCarly admitted to the accident, and Rosanna was shocked, but she was grateful for whatever had caused the change in Craig.  Carly attempted to pour them coffee, but her hands shook so badly that she could not do it.  Rosanna asked what was wrong with her, but Carly brushed it off by saying she was coming down with something.\n\n\nDamian took Meg out on a fancy boat and promised her a picnic on the beach of a deserted island.  He had also brought along a swimsuit for her, which she happily wore.  Damian told Meg to relax and obey the captain's orders to enjoy herself.  The mariners paddled a dinghy to the beach, and Damian tied it to a piece of wood.  They enjoyed a lunch of p\u00e2t\u00e9 and champagne, and toasted to a perfect day with perfect companions.\n\n\nMeg was beginning to miss Eliza and was eager to return to her.  She and Damian walked to the water's edge where he had tied the dinghy, but it was gone.  He called the Coast Guard for help, and he also was considerate enough to have them pass along the word to Lily that Meg and Damian would be delayed.  They talked about beginning a relationship, but Meg said it was too soon for her, and neither of them was sure what the other was looking for.  The Coast Guard cutter appeared and rescued the castaways.\n\n\nCarly filled in the details of how her life had been in ruins ever since Jack had left and remarried.  Rosanna asked about Janet, and Carly said that she would probably make Jack a much better wife than Carly had.  Carly also talked about Sage and Parker, and described how Parker had married hastily and had tried to become an emancipated minor.  Rosanna was still reeling from the news that Craig was the trustee to the account she left for her nephew.  She was sorry that the trust had turned out to be the worst thing she could have done for Parker.\n\n\nCarly said she had become close to Craig, and Rosanna deduced that the two of them had been intimate.  Rosanna forgave her sister and urged her to leave all her hurts in the past.  She also begged Carly to call her anytime she needed help, and she departed to straighten out Craig's bank accounts.  Carly carried the coffee mugs to the kitchen and took out her bottle of vodka and poured a shot into a tumbler.  She mumbled that it was only to \"steady\" her hands.  Suddenly she smacked the glass and sent it flying, and it smashed into many pieces.  Carly dissolved in tears.\n\n\nFaith and Parker met in Java and compared notes on their lives.  Parker left and ran into Rosanna in Old Town.  They hugged, and Rosanna asked if there was something going on with Carly that she should know about, but Parker refused to answer directly.  He told his aunt that he just wanted things to get back to normal.\n\n\nCraig nursed his hurt leg and struggled to stand to answer the knock on his hotel door.  His caller was Carly, who said she felt awful for hitting Craig's leg with her car.  She admitted that she had suffered a blackout and had no memory of the accident.  Craig said he had asked Parker to take her home afterwards, so that no one would learn about it.  \n\n\nCarly was miserable and said all she could think of was having a drink.  Craig leaned over and gave her a kiss on the lips to take her mind off booze.  He whispered how much he wanted her, and Carly said she only felt safe with him.  They continued kissing.\n\n\nDamian brought Meg back to the farm and explained to Lily why they were so late.  Meg checked on a sleeping Eliza, and then she thanked both Damian and Lily for a lovely day.\n\n\nRosanna and Paul chatted at Fairwinds, and she told him the good news that Craig was not going to press charges against her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Paul arrives for his supervised visit with Eliza, as he seems to be on his best behavior even as he has to stifle his curiosity when he learns that Dusty is no longer a part of Meg's life. Lily and Damian arrive, as Lily offers to watch Paul interact with Eliza as Damian whisks Meg away for a fun day. Meg is unsure at first, but is coaxed into it and winds up having a wonderful day on a boat and then private beach area with a picnic prepared by Damian. Their day is interrupted when heading home, they realize their dingy that was tied up had floated away and are forced to call the coast guard for help. Damian and Meg enjoy the extra time together, as they flirt, but Meg explains that she is not ready to jump into another relationship. Damian thinks it is because of Dusty. Meg admits that may be a part of it, but it is also uet until she feels she has some semblance of control over her life. He isn't going anywhere, which seems to please Meg. Once home, Lily hears the tale of what happened and wonders how come Damian didn't take advantage of his situation. He wants everyone to know he is changed. Lily seems a touch intrigued by him, as she watches him and Meg interact. Faith asks Paul a pointed question as to why he took Eliza away from her mother. Faith admits that she was never worried while he was gone because the Paul she knew was always good to her and Parker. Craig visits Rosanna and offers to drop the charges if Rosanna tells Carly that he did something nice for her despite what she almost did to him.

Parker is leery, but Carly promises she will stop and they will start fresh. Carly can't seem to function without a drink and almost takes one before she smashes the glass. Rosanna comes by for a visit and notices how badly Carly looks and realizes she almost hit Craig with her car. Rosanna wants to know what is going on with her, but Carly pretends it is just a bug. They talk about what happened before she arrived back in Oakdale, but Carly pretends she is better now that Rosanna is back. Later, Parker sees Rosanna and hopes now that she is back things can get back to normal, but he doesn't exactly tell Rosanna about Carly's drinking problem when she asks what is going on. Carly goes to see Craig to apologize and thank him for always being on her side even when he could have turned his back. He promises never to do that, as Carly admits even after the DUI and almost hitting him, all she can think about is drinking. Craig wants her to think about anything else, as Carly leans in and kisses him. Craig offers her an out, but Carly wants to stay with him, as they continue to kiss passionately when she admits with him is the only place she feels safe.",
