With Ameera in custody, Noah felt there was no reason for him to continue to live at the cottage. Luke arrived and offered to help Noah, but Noah did not want Luke's assistance. He told Luke he wanted time alone and needed a break from their relationship. Luke finally began to see what Noah really wanted was to break up. Noah refused to say that he was ending their relationship. As Noah got back to work, Luke begged Noah to let him help him deal with Colonel Mayer's death. Noah did not want Luke to help with anything and continued to push him away. Luke tried to remind Noah that they had happy memories at the farm and the cottage and had once been in love. With nothing resolved, Luke went out to get more boxes to help Noah finish packing. \n\n\nLuke went to Java and ran into Reg, a friend from school. Luke asked how Reg's boyfriend was doing and learned that Reg and Tony had broken up. Reg had heard about Noah's \"marriage\" to Ameera and asked if Luke and Noah were still a couple. Luke explained that he and Noah were trying to work things out. Reg took that piece of news as a sign that Luke was single, and asked if Luke was allowed to date other guys. Luke was not sure how to answer and told Reg he had not considered dating anyone else. Reg respected Luke's decision, but admitted he was attracted to Luke and would like to spend time with him if Luke changed his mind. \n\n\nLuke returned to the cottage and told Noah about his run-in with Reg. Noah was obviously jealous, but told Luke that another guy's interest in him did not change the fact that he still wanted to take a break. Luke said that if Noah did not want to see Luke walking around campus holding hands with Reg then he needed to change his attitude and fight for their happiness together. Luke told Noah he wanted to be with him forever, but was confused since Noah had not even taken off his wedding ring and seemingly did not want to give up his life with Ameera. Noah asked why Luke had said to marry Ameera if he was not able to support it. Luke said there was no way he could have stopped Noah from marrying Ameera to stop her from being deported. Noah explained he just needed time alone to work through everything that had happened and Luke had heard enough and stormed out of the house. Luke returned to Java and sat down to talk to Reg. Luke could not get Noah out of his thoughts and quickly excused himself. \n\n\nLucinda arrived to see Noah off to the dorms, and Noah thanked her for letting him stay there with Ameera. Lucinda told Noah that he had the right to grieve for his father, but he should be happy his disastrous trip to New York to save Ameera did not end worse for everyone involved. She described for Noah how worried Luke was for Noah's safety in New York. With his things packed, Noah left the cottage and, in the darkness, viewers see his ring had been left behind, to indicate that his marriage to Ameera was over. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul woke on the couch with just a blanket covering him and looked around the room for Meg. He found Meg at the window deep in thought. Paul told Meg to come and sit with him and he asked her what was wrong. Meg said she was worried that since Paul gave Sofie a check, it would appear as if he had paid her off to drop the rape charges she had brought against him. Paul told Meg he did not want to talk about Sofie and wanted to focus on his future with Meg. Moments later, Paul got a call from the police and learned that Sofie had decided not to move forward with the rape charges. Paul and Meg were happy to learn that Sofie had withdrawn her complaint and Paul got dressed so he could go to the station and sign paperwork. Before he left, Meg explained she was worried that Sofie would not let them be happy, but Paul guaranteed Meg that everything would be fine. \n\n\nSofie arrived back at her room at the Lakeview and informed Cole that she had talked to Paul. Sofie lied and told Cole that Paul had refused to pay her to drop the charges against him. She went on to tell Cole that she had gone to the police and had the charges against Paul dismissed because it was the right thing to do. Cole was angry and shocked at what Sofie had done. He told her Paul would never like her and she had blown any chance they had of getting money out of Paul. Sofie realized that Cole was only on her side because he wanted a big payoff and pushed him out of her room. \n\n\nAlone at Fairwinds, Meg heard the front door and assumed Paul had returned. When she went to the hall she found Sofie had let herself in and was looking for Paul. Meg explained Paul was not there, but Sofie told Meg to let Paul know she stopped by. Meg explained that Sofie was no longer welcome at Fairwinds and she needed to get out. Sofie said Paul had no trouble with her being in his home and she had only come by to thank him. Meg asked if she was there to show her appreciation for the check he gave her and Sofie was stunned that Paul had told Meg about the money. Meg told Sofie that the check was a payment to get her out of Paul's life and then Meg suggested that Sofie should use the money to get professional help over her fixation on Paul. Sofie told Meg to mind her own business and stormed out. \n\n\nIn the Lakeview dining room, Lily met Lucinda for lunch to discuss business, and Lucinda immediately noticed that Lily's attitude was back to her old spirited self. Lily admitted she was happy to have her focus back on work and off of her marriage troubles with Holden. She told her mom that Holden was once again committed to their marriage and she was ready to let her relationship work itself out on its own. Lily left to do some shopping. \n\n\nOn a county road, Holden and Carly shared a kiss. As soon as it happened, Carly started to say something, but then burned her hand on the engine. Holden iced her hand and the two stared at one another and each seemed confused about what the kiss had meant to the other. The two got back on the road and exchanged small talk, but their discussion was awkward and the kiss lingered in the air between them. After a short while, Carly decided it was time to talk about the kiss. She told Holden to pull over so they could talk, but he was unwilling to discuss it and said they needed to get home. \n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Lucinda saw Barbara sitting in the dining room and went to sit with her. Lucinda told Barbara she knew about Barbara's cancer diagnosis and, since Lucinda had recently battled and survived breast cancer, she tried to comfort Barbara and told her she needed to depend on her family for support. Barbara detailed her struggle to ask her family for help because she had lived so independently for so long. Lucinda said asking for her children's assistance was the best thing she could do to help her survive cancer. \n\n\nAfter Lucinda left, Paul and Meg arrived to share the news that Sofie had dropped the rape charges, but they found Barbara looking exhausted. Barbara asked Meg to take her to her room and sent Paul to cancel her lunch order. As Paul finished talking to the waiter, Sofie arrived and asked to speak with Paul. Sofie wanted to know if he would have considered dating her if Meg had been out of the picture. Paul said it was not that simple and walked away. \n\n\nPaul went up to check on Meg and Barbara, and Meg told him that Barbara needed to be looked after for a while and Meg was going to take a leave of absence from her job at Memorial to help his mom get well. \n\n\nAfter Meg went to Memorial to ask for a leave, she met Paul in the lobby of the Lakeview and told him that Bob had granted her request. She talked about how lucky she was that Bob understood, since she was still on probation for accidentally killing a patient. Unknown to Meg and Paul, Sofie was listening in on everything they were talking about. Meg went on to say that she was still worried that Sofie was not over Paul, but Paul told her that Sofie had told him she was ready to move away from Oakdale. They celebrated their mutual good news with a kiss. Sofie went to the hospital and decided to research what mistakes Meg had made in the past. \n\n\nCarly and Holden returned to the Snyder farm and Carly followed Holden in to get some books for JJ. The pair was surprised when Lily appeared and welcomed them both home. As Lily greeted Holden with a hug, he stared at Carly and the two exchanged an uncomfortable glance; both were obviously thinking about their kiss. Lily asked the two to tell her about the camp, but Holden said he had work to take care of. Carly and Lily headed into the kitchen as Holden watched Carly momentarily from outside. \n\n\nCarly and Lily shared a few laughs about Carly and Holden's misadventures on their journey to drop the girls off at camp. Lily asked if Carly and Holden had been able to resolve their differences. Carly thought back on the kiss she shared with Holden, and confidently told Lily that she thought her friendship with Holden would be fine. Carly got a call and headed home to take care of JJ, who was still not feeling well. \n\n\nWith Carly gone, Lily began kissing Holden as a proper welcome home. Holden finished empting out the car by bringing the cooler in and when he saw the ice, he thought back on his kiss with Carly. In the meantime, Carly had returned home and hooked up her camera and viewed her day with Holden. In the pictures she noticed that she and Holden were clinging to one another and she became uncomfortable and closed the computer.\n\n\n",
