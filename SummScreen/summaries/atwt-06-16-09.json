Susan said that she had even called her ex-husband, Larry McDermott, to find out if he could remember what had happened to the remainder of the eggs, but he had not responded.  Susan was not in favor of Emily's idea to have another child, and she refused to call Larry again.  She also reminded her daughter that having a baby would not stop the time clock.  Emily admitted that her pregnancy with Daniel had caught her by surprise and that she really did not do well by him.  She wanted another child so that she could feel as if she was a good mother.\n\n\nAlison and Hunter had fun watching a goofy jellyfish movie on Hunter's phone in Al's.  Alison was shocked when her father, Larry, walked in.  He approached her and said that he was in town in response to an intriguing call from Susan.  Alison was surprised that her mother had actually contacted him, but she was glad to see him.  Larry promised that he would never ignore his daughter again, but he did not go into any details about what Susan wanted.  He invited Alison and her friends to a steak dinner in Chicago sometime, and then he left for Memorial.\n\n\nAlison got emotional when her father left, and she thanked Hunter again for nudging her closer to her father.  Hunter took a call from the nursing home where his mother was recovering from a stroke.  The nurse said his mother was agitated, and she hoped that Hunter could visit and calm her down.  Alison offered to accompany Hunter, and the two of them headed for the nursing home.\n\n\nMargo and Tom returned from grocery shopping with bags full of food.  Casey handed Margo a note from Riley saying that he was leaving town.  Margo immediately accused Casey of asking their visitor to leave, and she was furious when she learned that her son had \"suggested\" that Riley hit the road.  Casey complained that Riley had moved in as if he owned the place, and besides, he was \"creepy.\"  Margo began to cry and said that Riley was her only contact with her dead son.  She told Tom how Casey and the film crew had embarrassed Riley by making him assemble a military issue gun on film, but Casey called their guest an interloper.\n\n\nMargo ordered Casey to go to the bus station and bring Riley \"home,\" but Casey demanded to know how Margo knew that the young man was not a thief or a con artist.  Margo cited her experience as a detective and her good instincts, and then she ran out to find Riley herself.  Casey and Tom argued, and Casey complained that Riley had acted just like Adam, and it drove him nuts.  Tom said they had a problem: they were bound to Adam by love, but neither of them could understand the kind of pain Margo was suffering.  Tom was thankful that Riley could at least make his wife smile again.\n\n\nLarry found Susan and Emily at the hospital and told them that he had seen Alison.  Susan continued to be unforgiving towards her ex, but Emily was glad to have his help.  Larry knew that they were trying to retrieve Emily's unused eggs, but unfortunately he said he had no idea where they would be if they were not at Memorial.  He offered to stay and help search, but he did have an appointment with a colleague from Oakdale University soon at the Lakeview.  As soon as he left, Susan brought out a large box of shipping and receiving records from the year that she was pregnant with Alison.  She thought if the eggs had left the hospital, there had to be a paper trail.\n\n\nSusan turned the box over to Emily, who got to work immediately.  Eventually she found a receipt that sparked her interest, and she asked her mother where Larry had gone.  Emily then took off in a hurry for the Lakeview, telling her mother that she would explain later.\n\n\nEmily spotted Larry at the Lakeview bar and showed him what she had found.  It was a receipt from the University of Chicago for Emily's donor eggs.  Larry questioned why they had gone to that institution, so Emily said that she was hoping that Larry could answer that, because his signature was on the receipt.  Larry said he had no memory of ever signing the receipt, but he did acknowledge that the signature was similar to his.  He explained that at the time that Alison was conceived, donor egg transplants were the cutting edge of medicine.  There were more women wanting eggs than there were donors, so there was a bit of black market activity, but he claimed no involvement.\n\n\nLarry offered to suggest some alternate methods of conceiving a child, but a confused Emily walked away.  She returned to the hospital and spoke with Susan, who told her that Larry McDermott had a mind like a steel trap and never forgot anything.  Neither woman could figure out why Larry would have wanted Emily's eggs.\n\n\nHunter and Alison arrived at the nursing home and found his mother seated in a wheelchair in the garden.  She did not appear agitated, and she had a nurse with her.  Hunter approached, and his mother was overjoyed to see him.  She implored her son to get her out of there, and she also promised to keep up her \"end of the bargain.\"  She called him \"Tristan,\" however, and the sight of Alison set her off on a tirade.  When Hunter tried to calm her, his mother again referred to him as \"Tristan,\" and she accused him of lying to her.  She insisted that Alison leave, so the nurse stepped in and suggested that both visitors depart.  As they walked out, Hunter's mother screamed, \"Tristan.\"\n\n\nAlison and Hunter went back to Java and tried to figure out what was going on with his mother.  Alison was curious as to who \"Tristan\" was, and Hunter's only suggestion was that his mother was a huge opera fan, and she used to listen all the time to \"Tristan and Isolde.\"  Alison thought that the woman had sounded as if she was talking with a lover with whom she shared a big secret, but Hunter denied that his mother had ever had a lover.  Perhaps, Tristan had been his real father, Hunter thought, and Alison agreed that his mother might have been giving him a clue as to who that was.  She suggested the man might still be alive.\n\n\nHunter expressed no interest in finding out if his father was living, but he did admit that he had a speck of curiosity on the subject.  Alison offered to help him work on the mystery, and the two of them shared a close moment.\n\n\nMargo found Riley at Yo's, and she sat next to him at the bar.  He said that he hated goodbyes, so he had written her a note instead.  Margo came right out and asked him if he was scamming her family, but Riley said that he and Adam had both been trying to restart their lives, but that Adam had not been successful.  Margo asked Riley to go home with her again for as long as he wanted, but the young man said that Casey did not want him there.  Margo said she would handle Casey, and she reflected that she was sorry that she had not made more of an effort to find Adam.\n\n\nThe two went back home, and that put Casey on the spot.  Tom welcomed Riley, but Casey walked outside and sat on the patio.  Tom took Margo aside for a little conference, so Riley grabbed two beers and walked outside to offer one to Casey.  Casey said nothing, but he took off for Java.  He walked inside and saw Alison and Hunter huddled at a table.  He asked Alison privately to get rid of Hunter so that the two of them could be alone   Alison said goodbye to Hunter and promised to help him look for his father.\n\n\nMargo, Tom, and Riley set the table, and Riley's manner with Margo set off some sort of alarm in Tom's head.  Riley went upstairs to pack, and Tom inquired if Margo was okay.   He cautioned Margo to go easy on Casey when he returned.\n\n\n",
