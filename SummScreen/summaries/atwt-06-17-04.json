Simon gave her a big kiss and she went to speak to her supervisor. Simon started thinking about his conversation with Pilar and asked an attendant if he knew where Mike was. Mike arrived just as Katie was saying goodbye to her supervisor. Pilar called Simon and told him that he better convince Mike that Katie was wrong about Pilar.  Later, Simon and Mike were having a beer. Simon gave Mike a story about how they should put everything behind them and drink to the future. Mike didn't buy any of it and left. Pilar came in and threatened Simon that she would tell Mike everything. Katie arrived after Mike left and asked Simon why he left without her. Simon told her about wanting to see Mike to tell him about their decision to leave town. Meanwhile, Pilar picked the lock and entered Katie's house.\n\n\nHal was barking orders while he was searching for Lucy. Alan and Craig were standing by. Hal asked Craig how he was doing. Craig said he came thinking that Lucy would be found and now she is missing again. Meanwhile, Dusty was trying to convince Lucy to leave with him. She resisted at first but then got into the car. Dusty took her to a storage warehouse. Once inside, Lucy and Dusty argued about everything from mice to sharing a candy bar. Dusty noticed that Lucy's hand was bandaged and asked her what happened. Dusty seemed genuinely concerned about her but Lucy kept insisting that Dusty had something to do with the thugs. Dusty called Hal and told him that Lucy was okay.

Alan came back in telling Craig and Hal that no one had contacted Sierra.  \n\n\nBarbara was scolding Jordan and Jennifer for their involvement with James. She was adamant that Jordan would pay for getting James involved in the search for Rosanna and Cabot. Barbara said that Rosanna was the only smart one because she knows what James is capable of. After Jordan left, Jennifer told her mother that if she didn't accept Jordan and her as a couple then Jen wouldn't have anything to do with Barbara. Paul came in and Barbara told him what Jen said. Paul told Barb that this is exactly what James wanted; to have them at each other's throat. When Jennifer came in they all agreed that they would fight James at all costs!\n\n\nPaul went to see James to find out what treachery James was up to. Paul said that James waited a long time to spring Jordan on them and wanted to know what James was up to. James accused Paul of only wanting to look good in Rosanna's eyes and didn't give a damn about Cabot. Paul told him that he wouldn't get away with what he was planning and that he would do everything he could to stop James. James told Paul it took long enough for Paul to toughen up. After Paul left, James says it was good to have enemies; it kept him focused.\n\n\nJordan went to visit James to find out what he knew about Cabot. James was willing to cooperate until Jordan told him that he would do anything to protect his son even if it meant keeping him away from James. He also told James that he was having his marriage to Rosanna annulled. James promptly rescinded his offer to help him find Cabot. James told him that annulling his marriage would be the biggest mistake because it would probably take years. Jordan told James, \"You have a better idea?\" James told him that by morning he would know where Rosanna was and by noon, Jordan could be holding Cabot. Jordan thanked him and asked him what he wanted in return. James said he wanted his trust and he and Jordan shook hands!\n\n\n",
