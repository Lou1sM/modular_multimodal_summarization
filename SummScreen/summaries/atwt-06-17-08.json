Barbara came out from the bedroom and told Sofie she didn't want to see her. Sofie apologized and told Barbara she just wanted to be forgiven for the mistakes she'd made. Barbara told Sofie to leave, but then Barbara began to faint, and Paul and Meg had to catch her. \n\n\nPaul took Sofie out of Barbara's suite. He told Sofie she needed to stay away, not just from his mother and from Meg, but from him, too. Sofie left and called Cole, telling him to meet her in her room at the hotel. Cole arrived, and Sofie said she needed his help. Sofie explained that Meg Snyder was standing in the way of her desire to reunite with Paul. Cole pointed out that perhaps it was Sofie's accusation of rape that was keeping Paul from wanting to be with her. Sofie told Cole that Paul had forgiven her for that, but Meg wouldn't let Paul forget about it. \n\n\nCole told Sofie he had always known she was \"a little off, but not this much.\" Cole started to leave, but Sofie stopped him, saying she needed him to do a favor for her and that she would pay him for it. When he asked what she wanted, Sofie said, \"I need you to steal something from the hospital for me.\" Sofie then told Cole she needed morphine in a particular concentration, but Cole told her to forget it. Sofie again said she would pay him. Cole asked her where she would get the money; Sofie promised she could get it. Cole agreed to help her, saying he must be as crazy as she was.\n\n\nPaul found Lisa and told her what had been going on with Sofie and how much it was upsetting his mother. Lisa said she would do anything to help Barbara, and Paul asked her to evict Sofie from the hotel. Paul went back to his mother's suite, where he told Meg that Lisa had agreed to find Sofie another place to live. Meg was thrilled. Meg told Paul she had to go to the hospital to pick up a paycheck and some medical supplies for Barbara, and she left.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Meg told one of the nurses what supplies she needed, and the nurse told Meg she had just done an inventory and that everything Meg needed was in a nearby room. Cole was in that same room, stealing the morphine. He hid behind the bed when Meg entered the room, and she got her supplies and left without seeing him.\n\n\nSofie found Paul in the lounge at the Lakeview. He insisted he had nothing more to discuss with her, but Sofie said she wanted to show him pictures of Hallie she had just gotten in the mail. Paul said he didn't know what Sofie was trying to do, but it had to stop. Sofie then tried to explain that after Will and Gwen left town with Hallie, she had become dependent on Paul and his mom. She said that when everyone said they loved her jewelry designs, she had thought that meant they loved her, too. Paul said he had given Sofie what he could. Paul told Sofie he really wanted her to be happy, and Sofie said, \"This is something I should have done a long time ago. Maybe we'd all be better off.\" She left, and Paul found Lisa and asked her to hold off on evicting Sofie from the hotel. \n\n\nChris had lunch with his mother and father at Al's Diner. They were discussing the pending lawsuit when Susan walked up to their table and laid into Chris for having cornered Alison at the hospital and locked her in a room to try to bully her into dropping the suit. Kim defended Chris like a mother bear would defend her cub, but Susan fought just as strongly for Alison and accused Kim of letting Susan's one-night stand with Bob years and years before influence her perception of \"the Stewart women.\" Susan told Kim that no amount of pressure from her, Bob, or Chris would make Alison drop the lawsuit. After telling them to enjoy their lunch, Susan left.\n\n\nBob asked Chris if any of what Susan had just said was true. Chris admitted he had locked the door when he and Alison were in the on-call room, but he said he had just wanted to talk to Alison. Bob pointed out that Chris had been told by him and by Tom not to talk to Alison at all, but obviously, Chris had ignored their advice. Chris said he had felt that he had to say something to Alison when he found out she had tried to get Bob to fire him. Kim was shocked to hear that, and Bob said he hadn't mentioned it to Kim because he had had no intention of firing Chris.\n\n\nAlison helped Aaron work on his motorcycle, but he could tell she was distracted about something. Alison admitted she was thinking about something that had happened with Chris at work, and she told Aaron about Chris cornering her in the on-call room. Aaron became very angry. He told Alison he knew that while she was working in Las Vegas in the porn industry, men had pushed her around and treated her badly, and he hated that Chris was doing the same thing to her. Alison said it wasn't the same, because Chris had failed, and Alison was okay. Alison then asked Aaron to promise he wouldn't do anything to Chris.\n\n\nAlison got a phone call from Susan and went to meet her at Java. Susan told Alison about her confrontation with the Hughes family, saying, \"In a nutshell, I think I threatened Chris in public, I called him a liar and a bully, and I think I also might have mentioned the affair I had with Bob.\" Alison said she could see where her own impulse control problems came from. She told her mom that it meant a lot to know she was on her side, but it was Alison's battle, not Susan's. Susan agreed but said it had felt great to let Chris have it.\n\n\nAaron found Chris at the hospital in the on-call room and went in, locking the door behind him. When Chris told Aaron to unlock the door, Aaron asked if that was what Alison had said when Chris had locked her in. Aaron asked Chris if he had hoped to scare Alison into dropping the lawsuit or if he had been trying to strong-arm her into bed. Chris told Aaron he was tired of having Aaron in his face and that if Aaron wanted a fight, he'd get one. Meanwhile, Kim and Bob arrived at the hospital, still discussing the situation with Chris. Kim said she knew Chris was ambitious, and Bob said Chris was also reckless and perhaps should be suspended until the whole lawsuit business was over. Suddenly, they heard a commotion in the on-call room. Bob tried to open the door, but it was locked; he took out his key and unlocked it, and Chris and Aaron came out, fighting. Bob tried to break them up, as did Kim. Meg came out and saw that Aaron was involved. The hospital's security staff quickly grabbed Chris and Aaron and told Bob and Kim that according to hospital policy, they had to take both of the young men downtown. Meg called Alison to let her know what had happened. \n\n\nSusan and Alison went to the police station, where Alison asked Aaron what had happened. Chris responded that Alison's boyfriend had assaulted him, but Bob told Chris to keep his mouth shut. Alison asked Aaron why he had gone after Chris after she'd asked him not to, and she told Aaron he'd made things worse. Dallas Griffin came to take a statement from Chris, but Bob asked if he could have a minute alone with Chris first. Bob then told Chris the last thing they were going to do was press charges against Aaron. Bob angrily told Chris that as his father, he wanted Chris to listen to him in order to salvage his career. \n\n\nWhen Dallas returned, Bob told him that Chris wasn't going to press charges. Dallas gave Aaron, Alison, and Susan the news. Dallas said Chris had been told to keep his distance from Aaron, and he suggested Aaron do the same. Meanwhile, Bob told Chris he'd like to see a little maturity from Chris to convince him he hadn't been wrong to stand by him. Later, Chris apologized to Kim for having gotten her involved in the situation. Kim told Chris he would have to rise above it and start acting like a Hughes.\n\n\nAlison went back to the farm with Aaron. He apologized for his actions but said he wanted Alison to know that he couldn't help feeling strongly about her, and he would do anything to protect her from anyone who wanted to hurt her.\n\n\nMeg returned to the Lakeview and told Paul that their families were at war, explaining what had happened between Chris and Aaron. Paul asked if he could be on \"Team Snyder,\" but Meg said she'd rather they just stay at the Lakeview with him and his mom. Meg said she felt better knowing she wouldn't be running into Sofie, so Paul told her he had asked Lisa not to evict Sofie after all. Meg was very upset and told Paul he could keep telling himself Sofie wasn't going to be a problem anymore, but neither she nor Barbara would believe him. Meg said that if Paul wasn't going to get Sofie to leave, she would leave instead. Paul followed Meg down to the lobby and told her he had acted out of his love for her. Paul explained that if he had had Sofie thrown out of the hotel, it would have been out of spite or fear, and he didn't want to be that kind of person anymore, because he wanted to be the type of person Meg would love forever. Meg said she understood about trying to make up for past mistakes and not knowing where to start. Paul said you started by letting go. Meg responded that she would let go when Sofie let go.\n\n\nCole met Sofie in Old Town and gave her the drug he had stolen from the hospital. He asked what Sofie was going to do with the morphine. Sofie explained to Cole that Meg had once killed a patient at the hospital by giving her too much of the wrong medicine. Sofie returned to the Lakeview, where she saw Paul and Meg talking in the lobby. She went upstairs, took a passkey from a maid's cart, let herself into Barbara's suite, and put the morphine bottle next to the one that was already on the medicine tray. The bottle Sofie put down was in a concentration of 50 mg per milliliter, whereas the one Meg had been using was for 4 mg per milliliter.\n\n\n",

Sofie tells Cole that Meg got in trouble for causing the death of a patient by giving her the wrong medication. Sofie uses a key card to get into Barbara's room and fill a syringe full of the medication that Cole stole from the hospital. The Hughes and Stewart families continue to battle as Susan confronts Chris about locking Allison in the on call room. Kim and Susan argue with each other defending their children.
