Jack sighed once he saw that it required both parental signatures.\n\n\nOn the phone at home, Carly tried to get Parker admitted to a school past its deadline. She laughed and sniped at them when they told her the tuition fee, and they hung up on her. She started to call Jack, but then put down the phone. Jack arrived on her doorstep, and she said that he'd read her mind. He showed Carly the paperwork expunging the assault charges from Parker's record. He noted that he'd signed off as Parker's father, even though he really wasn't.\n\n\n       Carly claimed that she'd said that Jack wasn't Parker's father in the heat of the moment, but Jack felt that it showed him how she really felt. No matter how much Carly explained herself, Jack remained deeply offended. He said he didn't know where they went from there. Carly believed that they could still find their way back to each other, but Jack cited that they were \"so vastly different\" from each other. He wondered if they were even good for each other, and she affirmed that he was good for her.\n\n\n       Jack changed the subject to what Carly had wanted to talk to him about when she'd said he'd read her mind. She explained what had happened when she'd called the New York school about their summer science program. Her immediate reaction had been to call Jack to tell him how mean the admissions person had been to her. \"And then I had this fear. I thought maybe you're not my G-Man anymore. Am I right about that, Jack?\" Carly tearfully asked.\n\n\n       Jack didn't really have a response, and he offered to pay for the school. When Carly declined, he started to insist because Parker was his son, but cut himself off. She wondered how she could erase her hurtful words from Jack's mind. \"Sometimes all the trying in the world isn't enough, and it's no one's fault,\" he uttered and left.\n\n\n       At Al's Diner, Janet beamed to Dusty about the news that she and Jack would have a son. Dusty twiddled the engagement ring between his hidden fingers, but sighed when Janet decided that she needed to share the baby news with Jack right away. A disappointed Dusty smiled, saying that she should meet him at the Lakeview after she surprised Jack.\n\n\nLiberty entered in a gloomy mood because Gabriel had only told the truth about Craig to appease her. She felt that she couldn't like someone without a conscience. Janet advised her to step back, if she were unsure of her feelings. Liberty admitted that she'd kissed Gabriel, and it was hard to keep things from progressing sexually. Janet thought it might be time to put Liberty back on the pill; however, Liberty vowed not to sleep with Gabriel-no matter how cute he was. Janet sighed that Liberty had it bad.\n\n\n       As Liberty and Janet continued to deliberate Liberty's feelings for Gabriel, Janet reasoned that Liberty didn't want someone who was needy, because that had seemed to be Liberty's problem with Parker. Liberty agreed, and she thought about getting away for the summer. Janet didn't really want that, but if Liberty needed it, Janet would make it happen.\n\n\nLater, Janet encountered Carly in Old Town. Janet happily prattled off all the things that were going well in her life. Janet wondered why Carly didn't seem relieved about Parker, and Carly disparaged Janet for her great life, because Carly's life stunk. Janet retorted that Jack did nice things for Janet because she was nice to him, and she insinuated that Carly should be nicer at home. Carly asserted that Janet could have Dusty, Jack, and anybody else, because Carly had her eyes on a bigger prize.\n\n\n       Carly went to the police station and griped to Tom about how Craig had made her go broke with his trust fund scam and the fire. She pondered how much the insurance would pay out for the fire, but Tom said that if the police suspected arson, the insurance company would void any claims. Carly wondered how they could get the money. Tom speculated that authorities would have to rule the fire as accidental and exonerate Craig. Carly returned home and called the insurance adjustor to discuss the Monte Carlo \"accident.\"\n\n\n       Dusty went to the Lakeview to plan a romantic evening for him and Janet. Upon leaving, Dusty encountered Jack and congratulated him on having a new son. Jack looked stunned, and Dusty said that he thought Janet had already told him. Jack cited that Janet was having his son, not Dusty's, and they'd have a serious problem if Dusty ever forgot that.\n\n\nDusty guessed that he intimidated Jack, but Jack responded that he wasn't the one lying to Janet about the supposed inheritance. Jack wished that he'd told Janet a while back that Dusty had supplied the money. Just then, Janet rounded the corner and asked if it were true that Dusty had actually bankrolled the inheritance.\n\n\n       At Lily's house, Lucinda handed Lily a newspaper featuring Silas' death. Lucinda suspected foul play, but Lily said it was none of their business. According to Lily, Holden was a grown man, and other people needed her more than he did. Lucinda couldn't imagine who'd need Lily more than her immediate family. Gabriel strode in, and Lucinda scowled.\n\n\n       After Lucinda and Gabriel harassed each other, the mother and daughter debated about Gabriel staying at the house. Lucinda figured that Lily was throwing herself into rehabilitating him just to avoid Molly and Holden's engagement. Lily went to make Gabriel breakfast, and Lucinda vowed that the thieving Gabriel would leave that day.\n\n\n       Gabriel insisted that he didn't know anything about the money that Lucinda kept talking about, and she accused him of being just like his father. \"I'm nothing like that bastard! Nothing!\" Gabriel yelled as Lucinda walked out the door.\n\n\n       When Lily returned, Gabriel was in a belligerent mood. She said he needed to meet her half way, or he couldn't live around her children. Frustrated, he said that he'd done the things that she'd asked. Lily replied that she needed to trust Gabriel. He remarked that his mother had told him that trust was everything. \"Look where that got her,\" he grumbled and left.\n\n\nAt Java later, Liberty told Gabriel that she was still upset with him about the reasons behind his confession. He didn't understand why it mattered that he'd told the truth about Craig to please her. He said he'd never claimed to be a perfect person, but he'd hoped that she'd like him anyway. She mumbled that she did, and he wondered why she was avoiding him, then.\n\n\nLiberty revealed that she didn't trust herself around him. She had feelings for him, but she couldn't give in to them as long as he harbored such anger. She said that he could have his anger, or he could have her; however, he couldn't have both.\n\n\n       In the holding cells, Craig balked when Tom said that Craig wouldn't have a hearing for weeks. Tom reminded his brother-in-law that even though Gabriel had recanted his statement, Craig had still assaulted an officer, escaped custody, and threatened Lucinda. \"Well, who hasn't?\" Craig asked. Craig felt that Gabriel needed him, but Craig couldn't make things right from behind bars. Tom thought that a judge might grant bail if someone vouched for Craig and took him in. Tom immediately ruled out Craig's sisters, and Craig decided that he needed to find someone who owed him a favor.\n\n\nLater, Lucinda arrived to amuse herself by taunting Craig. He announced that he was getting out on bail, and he'd tell Lily that Lucinda had turned Gabriel against his father. Lucinda threatened to make sure that Gabriel was long gone, and Craig replied that he'd kill Lucinda once he was free. Undeterred, Lucinda ordered him to take his lumps like a man. She deemed him a paternal nightmare and rattled off what he'd done to Bryant and Lucy. Lucinda was sure that Johnny would hate him, too.\n\n\nJust then, Lily entered, and Lucinda swore that she'd arrived with an olive branch. Lily was sure that the branch had plenty of thorns attached. Before Lucinda left, she cautioned Lily not to believe a word out of Craig's mouth.\n\n\nAlone with Lily, Craig asked about Gabriel, but Lily wondered why he'd care after what Gabriel had done to him. Craig insisted that Lucinda had put Gabriel up to lying, and she'd paid Gabriel to leave town. Lily seemed skeptical, but Craig bet that Lily knew it was true. Playing on her guilt, he got her to agree to make up to him what Lucinda had done. After Craig told her what he wanted her to do, Lily said she'd do her part, if Craig did his.\n\n\nWhen Lily arrived home later, Lucinda presented a one-way ticket to Montega for Gabriel. Lily refused it, so Lucinda decided that she'd move into the house to protect Lily and the kids from Gabriel. Gabriel charged into the living room and said that Lucinda could have his room, because he was getting out there. Just then, Craig burst through the front door and begged Gabriel not to go. \n\n\n\n\n",
