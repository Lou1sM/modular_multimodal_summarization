Dr. Gordon walks up to the door in time to hear Hal tell Bob that Dr. Gordon is their prime suspect, but all the evidence that they have is circumstantial.  Chris Hughes walks up behind Dr. Gordon and asks, \"What do you think you are doing?\"  Bob hears the two men talking and walks out and asks them what is going on.  Dr. Gordon gives Bob some papers and says that he was bringing the charts to him.  Bob and Hal walk back into Bob's office and Hal closes the door.  Chris asks again, \"What were you doing listening outside my dad's office door?\"  Dr. Gordon says that when the chief of staff is referring to him as a serial killer, he gets interested.  Dr. Gordon starts to walks away and then he turns back to Chris.  He says that he knows that Chris is taking Alison out tonight and he would like to know where going.  Chris tells him that is none of his business.  Dr. Gordon reminds Chris that he interrupted his date with Alison and he thought he would return the favor.  Dr. Gordon walks away.  Back inside Bob's office, Hal asks Bob if he can search the Doctor's lockers.  Bob asks if he has a search warrant.  Hal says that it would be quicker if he would give them permission.  Bob tells him to do it.  Hal and a policeman search the lockers.  Bob comes in to find out how much longer they will be.  Bob tells Hal that he is hearing some complaints that the lockers are being searched.  As Hal is looking through a locker, he asks the policeman that is helping him to hand him an evidence bag.  Hal pulls out a vial from doctor's coat and shows it to Bob.  Bob asks, \"Who has that locker?\"  Hal closes the locker door so Bob can see that the label on the door says Dr. Chris Hughes.  Later, Hal goes to Bob's office, but Bob is not there.  Hal gives Dr. Daniels a call and informs him as to what had been found.  Hal tells Dr. Daniels that he does not suspect Chris as the murderer.  Hal hangs up and Bob walks in his office.  Hal tells Bob that he doesn't think that Chris is the killer, but he has to question him just the same.  Hal asks Bob if he knows where Chris is and Bob tells him that he had a date with Alison tonight.  Hal starts to walk out the door, but Bob stops him.  Bob tells Hal that he wants to be present when Chris is questioned.  Hal tells him that he will keep him informed.  \n\n\nChris shows up at Alison's house with flowers.  She is dressed up and has her hair pulled up.  Chris tells Alison that she looks beautiful.  Alison invites him in.  Alison tells Chris that she will put the flowers in water and then they can take off.  Chris tells her that he needs to change their plans.  Alison is very hurt, but she asks if he has to work at the hospital.  Chris tells her that things have been so crazy at the hospital and he needs some time alone.  Alison suggests that they just stay in and order a pizza.  At first, Chris tries to get out of it.  Then he gives in.  Later, Chris and Alison are full of pizza and playing video games.  Chris thanks Alison for helping him to relax.  They have a discussion about who the killer at the hospital could be.  Chris asks Alison between Dr. Gordon and Ric, who does she think it could be.  She says that she was hoping it was someone else altogether.  Later, after Chris has left, Hal shows up looking for Chris.  Alison tells him that he just left a few minutes ago.  Hal asks, \"Where was he going?\"  Alison tells him that he was going home.  Hal starts to walk away and Alison stops him.  Hal turns back to Alison and Alison with a big smile on her face says, \"Isn't Chris the best?\"  Hal looks at the girl and says, \"Goodnight Alison.\"  Hal turns and walks away.  After Alison has closed the door, Hal calls Bob.  He tells Bob that Chris was not at Alison's and he is headed home.  Bob asks Hal to wait and question Chris tomorrow at the hospital.  Hal says that he can do that.  Hal asks Bob not to say anything to Chris.  Bob says to Hal, \"My son is innocent.\"  Hal says, \"Goodnight Bob.\"  The two men hang up. \n\n\nMolly runs into McCann at the Oakdale Yacht Club.  He tells her that he has a gun and he wants her to listen to him very carefully.  McCann tells Molly that he knows where Lily and Rose are, but he needs some help.  He says that whoever killed Spangler could be after him next.  He asks Molly to go to the police and make a deal for him.  He needs money to get lost and then he will give them the information that they are looking for.  Molly tells him that she will need some information to prove that they are still alive.  McCann says that he will get whatever information she wants.  He tells her that the other day he heard them singing happy birthday.  He warns her that if the police don't help him, he will leave town on his own and the two women will starve to death.  He tells Molly to go.  Molly slowly walks away.  And then runs straight to the police station.\n\n\nJessica walks into the Oakdale Yacht Club.  Dr. Daniels walks in behind her and asks, \"Would it sound like a line if I asked if you come here often?\" Jessica says, \"Only if you are being insincere.\"  Dr. Daniels explains that he is new in town and wondered if the food was worth waiting on.  He introduces himself and tells her that he is working at Memorial Hospital.  Jessica says that her fianc\u00e9e also works at Memorial.  At that moment, Ben walks in and jumps all over Dr. Daniels.  He says that it is not enough that he accuses him of being a serial killer, but he has to follow him all over Oakdale.  Ben rushes Jessica over to their table.  Jessica tells Ben that he was being rude and she makes Ben go over to Dr. Daniels and apologize and invite him to join them.  Ben goes over to Dr. Daniels and gets him to join them for lunch.  Isaac joins them and they wait for Bonnie to show up for lunch.  While they wait, Jessica explains to Dr. Daniels that Bonnie is her daughter and she is working at a shelter for abandoned and abused kids.  Isaac looks over his shoulder to see Bonnie walk in with Sarah.  Bonnie sends Sarah to sit at the table with Jessica and Ben and Isaac has a word with Bonnie.  Bonnie apologizes for bringing Sarah.  She tells Isaac that she looked so sad and she wanted to make her happy.  Isaac tells her it is ok for now, but in the future; he wants it to be only them on their dates.  Bonnie agrees and the two join everyone at the table.  Sarah asks if everything is ok.  Bonnie tells he not to worry and everything is ok because she is there.  Bonnie bushes the girl's hair back and Sarah smiles at Bonnie.  Later, Sarah comes back from freshening up and sees Jessica talking to Bonnie.  When Jessica walks away, Sarah walks up to Bonnie and asks again if everything is ok.  Bonnie tells her that she needs to stop asking that question.  Sarah tells Bonnie that she has never had anyone believe in her like Bonnie does.  Sarah tells Bonnie about a family that she lived with that had accused her of taking something.  Bonnie tells her that must have hurt her.  Sarah says that Bonnie would never treat a person like that.  Bonnie says that she likes her and she likes spending time with her.  Sarah and Bonnie go back to the table and join the others.  After they are finished with dinner, everyone gets up to leave.  Sarah sees that Dr. Daniels has left his PDA lying on the table.  When the adults have left the table, she picks up the PDA and puts it in her purse.  \n\n\nAt the police station, Dusty and Holden are going at it.  Dusty reminds Holden that he is Holden's only hope.  Holden tells Dusty that he is jealous of the life that he and Lily have.  Dusty tells him that he is wrong.  He says that he only came back to Oakdale for Barbara's money.  Dusty suggests that Holden is jealous of him because he loved Lily first.  Dusty looks at Holden and tells him to stop resenting him so they can find Rose and Lily.  Holden turns and walks out of the interrogation room.  Lucinda walks over to Holden and asks what happened with Dusty.  Holden tells her that he may be going crazy, but Dusty is starting to make sense.  Molly comes running into the police station.  Margo walks over and Molly tells them that McCann made contact with her.  She tells them that he has Lily and Rose and he wants to make a deal.  The interrogation room door opens and Dusty walks out with a policeman.  Molly sees him walk out.  Molly tells Margo that she has to let Dusty go.  Margo says that he is a suspect.  Molly says that McCann told her that Dusty did not kill Spangler and whoever ordered the kidnapping, killed Spangler.  Molly tells Margo that McCann doesn't want any money; he only wants a plea bargain.  Margo gets the officers busy on the case.  Molly says that she remembered one more thing.  She tells Margo that McCann said he heard Lily and Rose singing happy birthday a few days ago.  Lucinda looks at Holden.  Holden, fighting back the tears, says, \"It was my birthday a few days ago.\"  Lucinda hugs Holden and says, \"They're still alive.\"  Molly and Margo get on the phone and Molly sets up a time to meet with McCann.  When they hang up, Lucinda asks about proof that Lily and Rose are still alive.  Margo says that McCann told them that he would bring proof when he and Molly meet.  Everyone scatters to get ready for the meeting.  Dusty and Molly are left alone.  Dusty tells Molly that the one person he is worried about is the person that killed Spangler.  \n\n\nRose tries to keep Lily's spirits up as they sit at the bottom of the well.  Lily is fading in and out and Rose checks her temperature.  Rose finds that Lily is burning up with a fever.  McCann shows up and sends down a bucket.  Rose, on the radio, tells McCann that Lily is burning up with a fever and they need to get her out of the well.  McCann tells Rose that there is a newspaper in the bucket with a pen and he needs them to write something that will make their loved ones know that they are still alive.  Rose, on the radio again, says that they will do that, but Lily needs help and now.  There is no response from Spangler.  Rose gives up and wakes Lily up again and tells her that she needs to write the best love letter of her life.  After Lily and Rose write their notes, Lily asks Rose if she thinks they will be let go tonight.  Rose says that she thinks they will.  McCann calls the women on the radio and asks if they are finished.  Rose puts the paper in the bucket and tells McCann that he can pull up the bucket.  Rose asks if they are going to get out of the well soon.  McCann says, \"You will get out....\"  Rose tells him to say it again because he broke up.  Then she hears him struggle.  She hears him say, \"Hey, don't do that.  No, stop.  Stop!!\"  Then there is a gunshot.  Rose sees the bucket come flying back down in the well.  \n\n\n",
