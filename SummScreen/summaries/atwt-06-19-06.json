    "tvmega_recap": "Jen tells Paul and Meg about Johnny's condition and also Emily and his unborn child's role in helping Johnny get better. Paul is torn because he was not consulted. He wonders what Emily's motivations were behind having this risky procedure? When Jen staunchly defends Emily, Paul feels there is going to be problems down the road now. Meg tries to remind him that Dusty will never forget what Emily did to him. Johnny's surgery is finished and now all that is left is to wait. Jen and Emily seem to be forming a bond. Katie is irritated over the non-stop partying going on next door. She and a socialite take a dislike for one another. Little do both of them know, there is a common bond, which connects them. Katie, Mike, Simon and Vienna have near misses. Simon is sure he hears Katie's angry voice at his door, but when he goes to see, she is gone. Lily is rushed to the hospital unconscious after falling down the stairs. Holden doesn't understand how Luke could be that angry with his mother to cause her to fall down the stairs? Luke is racked with guilt over his mother's accident and terrified she won't wake up. He is also worried about how Holden now feels about him because Lily is seriously hurt. Lucy tells them that the while the baby's heartbeat is strong tests show there is brain swelling and internal bleeding. Holden holds vigil at Lily's bedside; Damian offers Luke a place to stay because Luke feels as if he blew his family apart and they may not want him around anymore.",
