Casey heard Riley telling Margo about the watch Riley had worn in combat, and he saw Riley put the watch on the table. Margo saw Casey and offered him a breakfast of leftovers, but Casey declined, saying he had to get to work.\n\n\nMargo asked Casey if he had fixed the light in the hallway yet. Casey said he hadn't, but that he would get to it soon. Margo complained that it had been more than a week since she'd asked him to take care of it. Casey promised to do it later, but Riley offered to do it instead. As Casey left the house, he picked up Riley's watch and walked out with it.\n\n\nCasey went to the hospital and asked Alison to hide the watch. Alison quickly figured out that it was Riley's, and she asked Casey why he had taken it. Casey said he couldn't really explain, and Alison said that she couldn't hide it. Casey said he would throw the watch away if Alison wouldn't hide it, so she reluctantly agreed to put it in her locker.\n\n\nAt Margo's, Riley realized his watch was missing and that the only other person who'd been there after he had put it down was Casey. Margo said that she would go to the hospital to find out if Casey had accidentally picked it up.\n\n\nWhen Margo found Casey, he was with Alison. When Margo asked about the watch, Casey asked if Riley had accused him of stealing it. Margo said that Riley hadn't said that, but Casey acted as though Margo thought he had stolen it. Casey said that Margo had to choose whom to believe, him or Riley. Margo got tears in her eyes and said she would always choose her own son.\n\n\nMargo told Casey that she would go home and tell Riley that she hadn't found his watch. After Margo left, Alison told Casey that what he'd done had been very cruel to his mom. Casey tried to make Alison understand that he'd had to do something to get through to Margo about Riley. Alison wondered what Casey had hoped to accomplish by making Margo feel that Casey thought Margo didn't love him.\n\n\nCasey said what he had done was better than letting Riley hurt Margo. Alison asked how Riley had hurt Margo, and then wondered if Casey felt that way because Riley had made Margo feel better when Casey couldn't. Casey said that was low, but Alison said that what Casey had done was low, and in addition, he had used her to do it. She walked out of the room, angry.\n\n\nCasey followed Alison to Old Town and begged her to listen to him. Casey explained that he thought Riley was trying to con Margo into thinking she was getting her son back, but Riley wasn't Adam and would never be Adam. Casey thought it was better for his mom to deal with it and be a little hurt than to get too attached to Riley. Alison said she disagreed but understood what Casey was saying.\n\n\nAlison asked when Casey was going to return Riley's watch. Casey said he would do it later and would say that he had found it in the couch, but he asked Alison to keep it in her locker one more day for him. Alison agreed on the condition that Casey would at least try to get along with Riley. Casey agreed, in a twisted kind of way, and Alison said that would have to be good enough.\n\n\nA witness went to the police station to give a statement about the hit-and-run. Margo wasn't there, so Jack asked if he could take the statement instead. Jack had not heard anything about the hit-and-run incident yet, and an officer explained that it had occurred right in front of the police station.\n\n\nThe witness agreed to give his statement to Jack. He described the car he had seen when Craig had been hit. When Jack asked if he had gotten a look at the driver, the man said no, but perhaps the teenage boy who had been there had gotten a better look. Jack asked him to describe the boy, which the man did. Jack realized the man might be describing Carly's car and Parker.\n\n\nAfter the witness left, Craig arrived at the police station to sign his statement about the incident. Craig didn't want to discuss his report with Jack, but Jack said he knew all about the incident, because a witness had come forward to give a statement. Craig asked if the witness could identify the driver, but Jack said no, although the witness had given a description of a car that matched the type of car that Carly drove. Craig pointed out that thousands of people drove a car of that color, make, and model, but Jack thought it was more than a coincidence.\n\n\nCraig told Jack that unless he had something else to go on, the case was basically closed, because it ultimately was his own fault that the car had almost hit him, since he hadn't been looking when he crossed the parking lot. Since he didn't intend to press charges against anyone, he asked Jack if he could sign the statement and leave. Jack reluctantly handed Craig the paperwork, which Craig proceeded to sign.\n\n\nMargo went to the station, where Jack told her his suspicions that Carly might have been the driver who had almost hit Craig. Margo thought Jack was reaching, since the witness couldn't describe the driver, but she agreed that Craig's whole story had seemed dubious to begin with. She ultimately agreed that Jack could question Carly.\n\n\nMargo went home and told Riley that his watch must have disappeared, because Casey had told her that he didn't know anything about it. Margo took out her checkbook and offered to reimburse Riley for the cost of the watch, but he assured her that wasn't necessary in light of everything she had done for him while he had been in Oakdale.\n\n\nMargo then told Riley that while talking to Casey at the hospital, she had realized that for whatever reason, having Riley in their home was hurting Casey deeply. She said that she had thought that Casey would get over his resentment for Riley, but instead, it was apparently getting worse. Riley offered to talk to Casey, but Margo told him that she thought the best thing would be if Riley left.\n\n\nRiley asked whether Casey had asked Margo to get him to leave, but Margo said that Casey didn't know what she was doing. Margo told Riley that she couldn't turn her back on her son. Riley said he expected nothing less from her, and he got up to go pack his things.\n\n\nMargo told Riley that she wanted to help him find another place to stay, and she said that just because he was leaving didn't mean they couldn't meet for a burger sometime or that Riley couldn't stop by in the morning for a cup of coffee. Riley asked if Margo was referring to \"that mud\" that she served, and Margo pointed at him and said playfully, \"Oh, you've got a mouth on you, kid!\"\n\n\nMargo stopped suddenly and her eyes filled with tears; she said she used to say that to Adam. Still crying, she told Riley that he was her last connection to Adam, and she didn't want to lose that. Riley said he didn't want to lose it, either. He then said that maybe his moving out would be the best thing that could happen.\n\n\nLiberty went to Al's, where Parker was busing tables. Parker invited Liberty to hang out with him if he could get the rest of the day off. Liberty declined, saying she was meeting her friend, Mac. Liberty went outside to wait. She got a phone call from Mac, who said she had to bail on Liberty in order to meet with an ex-boyfriend. After Liberty hung up, a guy she knew from school, Gabe, walked up and invited her to go to the movies. Liberty said no, but she did accept Gabe's offer to go have a drink at Java.\n\n\nFaith entered the diner and could see that Parker was upset about something. Parker watched Liberty leave with Gabe. Parker told Faith that he didn't like Liberty lying to him, and he left the diner to follow Liberty.\n\n\nParker found Liberty and Gabe at Java and accused Liberty of lying to him, virtually calling her a slut. Liberty stopped Gabe from responding and instead took Parker aside and told him she resented how much he seemed to enjoy calling her a slut. Parker apologized and said that sometimes he said things he didn't mean without thinking. He told her that they needed to talk, but Liberty said their days of talking were over. Liberty said that one day, she might actually be with another guy, and Parker would have to get used to that.\n\n\nParker went back to the diner to work. Jack showed up to talk to him about the hit-and-run incident. Jack saw Faith and said hello, and Faith excused herself so Jack and Parker could talk. Jack told Parker that he knew that Parker had been there and had seen the whole thing. Parker tried to deny it, but Jack told him there was a witness who had seen Parker on his bike at the scene.\n\n\nParker admitted that he'd been there, but when Jack asked if it had been Carly who was driving, Parker said his mom hadn't been anywhere near the station that day. Jack told Parker that he knew that Parker was trying to help Carly, but if Parker didn't tell the truth, Jack would take Carly down to the station and put her in a lineup for the witness to identify.\n\n\nParker admitted that Carly had been driving the car, but when Jack asked, Parker said that Carly hadn't been drinking. Jack kept pushing the issue. Parker told Jack that Carly had stopped drinking, so there was no problem. Parker worriedly asked his dad what he intended to do if Carly had been drunk at the time. Jack said he wasn't sure, and he left the diner.\n\n\nLiberty arrived at the diner, and Faith once again excused herself so that Parker could talk. Parker apologized again, but Liberty said that the problem was that Parker was always going to jump to conclusions about Liberty whenever he saw her with someone else. Liberty said that wasn't a friendship issue, it was an ownership issue.\n\n\nLiberty said that a friendship between herself and Parker did not appear to be a possibility. She told Parker not to call her or text her anymore, and she asked him to not even say hello to her whenever he saw her. She told him they were finished, and she left.\n\n\nAt home, Carly tried to work. She was having trouble producing any good sketches, so she grabbed her car keys and left the house. When she returned, she had a new bottle of vodka with her, from which she quickly took two swigs. Craig arrived and rang the doorbell. Carly hastily hid the liquor bottle in the cabinet under the sink.\n\n\nWhen Carly answered the door, Craig told her that Jack was curious about the hit-and-run because of a witness who had come forward. Craig told Carly that he thought she should go ahead and tell Jack the truth about what had happened, because once Jack got an idea that something wasn't right, he would keep digging until he found the truth by pressuring someone, and that someone would be Carly.\n\n\nCarly said that she could handle Jack. Craig agreed that when Carly was on her game, she could handle Jack, but given that Carly was trying to beat an addiction, he didn't think she needed the additional stress that lying to Jack would cause her. Carly insisted that she was strong enough to handle Jack and strong enough to quit drinking. The doorbell rang, and when he saw that it was Jack, Craig said it appeared that they were about to find out if Carly was right.\n\n\nWhen Jack came in, Craig remarked that it was apparently a slow day for real crime in Oakdale. Jack explained that he was there to ask Carly about the hit-and-run. Carly told Jack that Craig had been encouraging her to tell the truth about what had happened. Jack asked what truth that was, and Carly said that she had almost hit Craig with her car.\n\n\nJack asked whether Carly had been drinking at the time of the incident, and she admitted that she had. Carly said the enormity of what had almost happened had been enough to convince her to stop drinking for good. Jack asked if Carly was going to AA meetings, but Carly said they didn't work for her. Jack told her she had to do something, because people didn't stop drinking on their own without any help. Carly said she had done so, and Jack replied by saying that Carly should be willing to take a Breathalyzer test if that was true.\n\n\nCarly smugly asked Jack if he intended to haul her down to the station, but Jack informed her that wouldn't be necessary, because he had the equipment in his car. Craig said, \"You don't want to do this, Jack,\" but Jack said he had to do it. Craig pointed out that Carly had told Jack the truth even though she could have lied about it, but Jack said that Carly had been caught. Craig said that they both knew that wasn't the case and that Carly could have denied having been the driver who almost hit him.\n\n\nJack insisted that if Carly really had stopped drinking, she shouldn't have a problem taking the Breathalyzer test. Craig disagreed, saying that Carly had every right to refuse, because of where it could lead. He asked how long it would be before Jack started demanding that Carly go to the station on a daily basis to be tested. Jack angrily replied that since Carly was the mother of his children and was driving them around, he had the right to check on her if she had a substance abuse problem.\n\n\nCarly told Jack that it was past tense; she had had a problem, but she no longer did. Jack asked if he was supposed to just take her word for that. Carly said that if Jack didn't start trusting her sometime and didn't ever believe that she might actually have learned from her mistakes, then it didn't matter what a Breathalyzer test said. Craig told Jack that he had personally watched Carly throw out all of the liquor in the house, and he invited Jack to search the house for himself.\n\n\nJack told Carly that he would take her word for it, but if she wanted him to believe in her again, she'd \"better damn well go the distance.\" Carly breathed a sigh of relief and thanked Jack. Jack said that he would close the book on the hit-and-run case, since no one had been seriously injured, but he hoped he wouldn't be sorry he'd done that. Carly said, \"You won't be,\" and Jack left.\n\n\nJack went to the police station and found Parker waiting there for him. Parker told Jack that he'd been too worried about what Jack might do to Carly to work the rest of his shift. Jack told Parker that Carly was okay and wasn't going to be arrested. Parker was relieved to hear it. Jack said that Parker had done the right thing by telling him the truth, and so had Carly. Parker was surprised to hear that Carly had told Jack the truth.\n\n\nParker said that what had happened with Craig had really scared Carly, and Parker knew that she was really going to stop drinking this time. Jack said he hoped so, but he asked Parker to be sure to let him know if anything else happened, because it was more than just Carly's life at stake.\n\n\nCraig told Carly that he was proud of her for how she'd handled herself with Jack. He said he knew that she could do anything she set her mind to do, and she'd just proven it. Carly said she wished she had half the confidence in herself that Craig apparently had in her, and Craig said she would, eventually.\n\n\nCraig offered to take Carly to the Lakeview for lunch and a pep talk, but Carly said she'd been working on some sketches and wanted to get back to it. Craig kissed her on the cheek and left. Carly rushed to the kitchen, grabbed the bottle of vodka, and began pouring it down the sink. However, she stopped halfway through, looked at the bottle, and then took two good swallows.\n\n\n",
