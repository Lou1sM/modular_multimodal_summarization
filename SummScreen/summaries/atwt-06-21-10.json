    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Lakeview lobby, Janet realized that her \"inheritance\" had not been from her father but was a disguised \"gift\" from Dusty.  She was very upset with both Dusty and Jack for lying to her, but she asked to speak with Dusty alone.  Dusty said he had done what he thought was best because Janet needed money and a place to live with Liberty and the baby.  Janet called it \"guilt money,\" because she had blamed Dusty for Rocco's death.  She also blamed her own stupidity for believing that her estranged father would actually leave her money.\n\n\nDusty's response was that Janet was happy when she got her new apartment and the new washing machine, but she said it suddenly felt as if she had lost her father twice.  Janet walked out, as Dusty looked forlornly at the engagement ring that he still carried in his pocket.\n\n\nCarly talked with Eugene Milton, a representative from the fire insurance company, and he told her that the Monte Carlo fire was still classified as arson.  Carly said there was new information, and she explained how she had hired Gabriel Caras as a \"sort of electrician.\"  She admitted that the young man could have made \"some errors\" that led to the fire.  Parker walked in and heard his mother declare that the fire was an accident, and he piped up, \"What are you talking about, Mom?\"  Carly jumped in and explained that Craig was Gabriel's father, and therefore would never intentionally put his own child in danger.\n\n\nBefore he left, Eugene promised to look into the incident further.  He assured Carly that if the fire were an accident, they would find that out.  Parker lost no time accusing his mother of lying to the adjuster, but Carly preferred to think of it as giving the man a \"different way of looking at it.\"  Parker said if she got a monetary settlement, she should keep it because he didn't want it.  He asked her to forget about his trust fund money and instead spend her time on fixing things with his dad.  Carly outlined how things didn't just magically work out for the best; people had to make them happen.  \"Want the money or not,\" Carly declared,\" we're going to get it back\" because Craig owed them.\n\n\nJack went to the police station and checked his messages.  He grinned when he read one from Janet saying that their baby was a boy.  Parker walked in and was thrilled with the news, as well, and he asked if he could be the one to tell J.J., and Jack agreed.  His father then asked Parker if he, Jack, had been \"messing up\" lately, and Parker pulled out Jack's photo of Hal Munson, Parker's birth father.  The boy said that Carly was still trying to make up for running off with Simon several years before, and Jack was feeling as if he could never be as good a dad as Hal.  Parker said his parents were missing the fact that what he, J.J., and Sage cared about was not the times Jack and Carly messed up, but how hard they worked to make it right the rest of the time.\n\n\nThey talked about how Carly needed Jack to always be on her side, and the two hugged.  Janet arrived and was disappointed that Jack and Parker already knew the baby's gender.  Parker left, and Janet mentioned that she wasn't sure that she could ever trust Dusty again.  Then she showed Jack the sonogram of the baby, and they went to Java for coffee.  Jack, however, could not stop looking at the photo, and they began laughing about goofy names that began with \"J.\" Dusty walked in, so Jack left, and Dusty took his place at the table with Janet.\n\n\nHe showed her the engagement ring again, but Janet could not believe that Dusty was asking her to marry him again when she was still furious with him.  Janet asked him about Jennifer, his late wife, but he was very close-mouthed.  Janet asked questions and learned that Jennifer and Dusty had gotten together after the birth of Johnny.  Then she explained to Dusty that she saw what Jennifer had seen in him, and she admitted that she still loved him and his air of confidence.  She called him a \"fixer,\" but said he needed to respect her.  She announced that she would give up the apartment and her washing machine because it was what she wanted to do, and she walked out.\n\n\nAt Lily's, Lucinda pulled out her phone and threatened to call the police on Craig, who had just entered Lily's house.  Lily shouted that Craig was out on bail and in her charge, as Faith walked in, too.  Gabriel, who had been silently watching the family drama unfold, declared himself out of there, and he stormed out the door with Craig on his heels.  Gabriel asked how Craig had gotten out of jail, so Craig said that Lily had put up bail and pulled some strings on his behalf.  He also thanked Gabriel for recanting his lie, but the boy said he had not done it for Craig.\n\n\nCraig asked if Gabriel's beneficence had anything to do with Liberty, and he knew he was correct when Gabriel refused to talk about the girl.  Gabriel said he wasn't staying at Lily's, and he stomped off.  Craig turned to go back into Lily's when Eugene Milton, the insurance adjuster, appeared and asked if the young man just leaving was Gabriel Carras.  Craig answered yes, and he confirmed that the boy had done some wiring at the Monte Carlo offices.  Eugene then switched to more personal matters, such as why Craig knew so little about his own son.  He also inquired about rumored animosity between father and son, and that led to Craig's asking a few questions of his own.  He soon realized that much of the adjuster's information had originated with Carly.\n\n\nCarly called her credit card company and asked how much credit she had on account.  She was horrified to learn she was maxed out and inquired about raising her limit.  She could not hear the response, however, because of loud pounding on her front door.  She opened it and asked Craig if he had finally found his \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card in his wallet.  A grumpy Craig threatened that Carly was \"going to pay.\"  He accused her of sending the insurance adjuster to harass his son, but Carly said she had only told the truth.  Craig was discouraged, and he whined that he was going to have to turn himself back in for the arson charges, but Carly said there was another way.\n\n\nCarly suggested that they both blame the fire on faulty wiring and then the \"whole arson thing\" would go away, and the insurance company would pay.  Gabriel was \"just a novice electrician who made a mistake.\"  When Craig realized that the scheme had a chance of working, he told Carly that the money had been his investment, so the payout was his, as well.  Carly, however, reminded Craig that she and Eugene had gotten \"close,\" and one phone call from her, and Craig would be back in his special room at the Oakdale Police station.  The two made a deal.\n\n\nBack at Lily's, she scolded her mother and asked about Craig, whom Lucinda called \"that viper.\"  Lucinda commented that Lily had invited the \"arsonist along with the grafter\" to move in with her and her children.  Lily asked Faith to go in the kitchen for the duration of her discussion with her mother, and then Lily told Lucinda that she had invited Craig to stay with them because he had told her that Lucinda was the one who had gotten Gabriel to lie in the first place.  Lily said it was up to her to repair the damage, since Lucinda would not lift a finger.  Lucinda recited a litany of Craig's sins, including hooking Lily on drugs, but Lily said keeping Craig away from his son was just as devastating.  Lucinda countered by citing Lily's unhappiness with Holden, and she accused her daughter of \"looking for a hobby.\"  Lily told Lucinda to show herself out.\n\n\nLucinda refused to leave, so Lily took herself out on a walk.  Faith rejoined her grandmother and demanded to know what was going on.  She particularly wanted to know why her mother had asked \"Uncle Craig\" to stay with them, but Lucinda was horrified that the girl still called Craig \"Uncle.\"  Lucinda went on to say that Lily couldn't handle the thought of Holden's marriage to Molly, so she was overcompensating by \"filling the house with strays.\"  Faith let it slip that Gabriel and Liberty had \"hooked up,\" and Lucinda grumbled that they would never get rid of the boy if that were true, unless...Lucinda looked at Faith and asked if she was willing to \"take one for the team.\"\n\n\nFaith was horrified that Lucinda was asking her to sleep with Gabriel, but her grandmother explained that she would never suggest such a thing.  She had more in mind the planting of drugs in the boy's backpack.  \"Good to know my grandmother's a pusher, not a pimp,\" remarked Faith, as Lucinda howled with laughter.  Lily returned and asked why her mother and daughter looked so guilty.\n\n\nParker walked through Old Town and met Gabriel.  \"Stay away from her,\" warned Parker, but Gabriel got in Parker's face and urged Parker to punch him.  He bragged that whenever that happened, Liberty kissed it and made it all better.  Parker said there was no way that Liberty would hook up with a loser like Gabriel.  Gabriel taunted Parker by saying that he and Liberty had already \"hooked up,\" and he invited Parker to take his best shot.  Parker said that as much as he'd like to hit Gabriel, there was obviously something wrong with Gabriel's brain already.  He continued that Liberty hung out with Gabriel from pity and a sense of charity.  Gabriel argued that he was better off than Parker, and he pulled a huge wad of bills from his pocket.\n\n\nGabriel returned to Lily's, after all, and he saw Faith out on the patio.  She asked why he wanted to stay in a place where nobody liked him, and Gabriel said that Faith needed to get on board the \"Team Gabriel/Liberty\" bandwagon.  Faith asked what was in it for her, so Gabriel answered, \"Your pal, Parker.\"\n\n\nInside, Lucinda spied on the teens, but Lily caught her.  Lily saw no reason why the two couldn't be friends, but her mother reminded Lily that \"proximity\" trumped \"hormones.\"  Lily accused her mother of trying to unravel her family and asked her to leave.  Lucinda got in another jab about Lily's \"peopling her house with needy misfits\" before she left.\n\n\nDusty sat with Johnny in his room in the Lakeview, and watched Johnny draw a wedding cake with him, Janet, Liberty, and Johnny on the top.  Someone knocked, and a surprised Dusty admitted Craig.  Johnny leaped into his father's arms, as Craig explained that he was staying at \"Aunt Lily's\" house, and Gabriel was there, too.  He asked if Johnny wanted to join them for a sleepover, but Dusty said he wasn't so sure about that.  Craig reminded Dusty that their agreement was only for while Craig was \"away,\" and he told the boy to pack his pajamas.  Craig took his son for ice cream, and the boy asked what flavor was Gabriel's favorite.  Craig didn't know, but he promised they would find out together.\n\n\nCarly talked to her credit card company again, but they irritated her and she hung up.  Parker barreled in and announced that he had changed his mind: he wanted his trust fund money back, if it wasn't too late.  Carly grinned and said his timing could not be more perfect.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Janet finds out that her \u0091inheritance' came from Dusty and is livid. Janet lights into him about how he handled this all wrong by lying and trying to control her. Carly charms the insurance agent into thinking that the fire was an accident by Gabriel's hand. Parker almost blows her story.

Meanwhile, Lucinda tries to manipulate Faith into helping possibly frame Gabriel for drugs \u0096 if they get some. They can get rid of them all. Jack happily tells Parker that he will be a big brother. Parker and Jack have a talk about how much family means and how Parker wants them to stay together. He wants Jack and Carly to stop worrying about being such great parents because they already are.

Jack defends Dusty's motives a little, but Janet doesn't know if she can ever trust him again. Craig comes to take Johnny for ice cream and a sleepover surprising Dusty because he thought he was in jail. Craig appreciates what he did, but their deal was only while he was in jail.

However, they come to an agreement when Carly poses the idea about the electrical malfunctioning because of a mistake.

Their fun is interrupted when Dusty shows up.

Dusty pleads with her to reconsider, but Janet is set to give up the apartment and his money and make her own way. Jack privately talks with Hal's photo hoping his son will turn out to be like Parker. Gabriel and Parker get into a verbal sparring, as Parker wants him to stay away from Liberty, while Gabriel taunts him about his supposed \u0091hooking up' with Liberty.
