    "tvmega_recap": "Today, Lucinda continues to struggle with the news of her cancer. Meg is at the farm reuniting with her brother, Holden The phone rings; it is Lucinda and she really needs Meg to give her a ride to the hospital.. Little does Lucinda know - a nurse is now calling the farm for contact info on Lucinda - which confuses Holden. He reports this call to Lily! Back to the wedding of the year some sense into Rosanna - but the wedding begins. What no one knows is that Carly made a phone call before talking to Rosanna - to Paul! He walked outside just in time to see them pronounced husband and wife, then slipped out unseen. We see him standing out of sight - tears streaming down his face. Paul goes home, poured a drink and phoned his sister to tell her the news, which is that Craig now has the considerable power of the Cabot name behind him. \"There's no stopping him now,\" fretted Jen, deciding then and there that she's ready to fight dirty",
