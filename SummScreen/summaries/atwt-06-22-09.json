Dusty thanked Bonnie for her professional services in regaining legal access to Johnny.  He also joined her for breakfast, and the two laughed together.\n\n\nDamian met a sad-looking Meg peering through the window of the diner, and he suggested that they go elsewhere for their breakfast.  Meg, however, opted for Al's, so the two walked in.  The reaction from Dusty and Bonnie's table was frosty, and Damian asked Meg why seeing Dusty with another woman bothered her so much.  Meg only said that she was surprised that it had happened so quickly.  She and Dusty continued to make eye contact, so Damian offered her advice, as a friend.  He told Meg that she needed to resolve her feelings for Dusty before she could move her life forward.\n\n\nDamian got up and left to return to the Lakeview.  Meg approached Dusty and asked to speak with him.  Bonnie took the hint and excused herself, so Meg took Bonnie's place.  She told Dusty that she wondered if they had been too hasty when they had ended things between them.  They discussed Paul, but they reached no agreement there.  Meg did say that she missed seeing Dusty, and he confessed the same thing to her.  Meg mentioned that she did not understand why Dusty resented Damian so much, and the two had words that led to Meg's jumping up and storming out.\n\n\nBonnie went to Metro, where Derek surprised her.  He apologized for overreacting earlier and admitted that he was jealous of Dusty's attention to her.  Bonnie said that she and Dusty had kissed-twice.  Derek wanted to know what that meant to the two of them, but Bonnie had no idea.  Out of the blue, Derek suggested that he and Bonnie live together, and that amused her, and she began to laugh. The laughter angered Derek, who stormed out.\n\n\nCarly returned home and poured herself a cup of coffee, which she laced heavily with vodka.  She went into the living room and picked up her sketchpad.  Craig appeared at the door and wished her a good morning.  He was eager to see what designs Carly had produced, but Carly said that she didn't feel like working on such a beautiful day.  She began to flirt with Craig and suggested that, since they had the house to themselves, that there had to be some pleasurable way to pass the time.  Craig took Carly into his arms, and they kissed.\n\n\nAfter putting Eliza down for a nap, Paul found Rosanna sobbing in the living room at Fairwinds.  She told him that seeing him with the baby reminded her of what she had always dreamed of having, but had never achieved.  She complimented Paul on his parenting skills, and then she burst into tears again.  Paul got her a cup of tea, and he suggested that the three of them \"play house\" at Fairwinds.  Rosanna did not agree that it would be a healthy situation, and she reminded Paul that Eliza was his child with Meg, and she did not want to get in the middle of that situation.  Besides, Rosanna knew that she and Meg did not get along well.  Paul asked her to stay and help with the baby, and Rosanna agreed to at least think about it.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty saw Damian and he told him that all Damian thought about was himself.  Damian accused Dusty of suffocating Meg and said it was no wonder that Meg had left him.  Dusty threatened Damian that he was going to regret returning to Oakdale, and Dusty walked out.  Damian immediately called his assistant, Bernardo, and instructed him to buy as much stock in Worldwide Enterprises as he could.  He ordered him to use an offshore buying company, so that no one would know who the buyer was.\n\n\nDamian then went to the Snyder farm and apologized to Meg for urging her to talk with Dusty.  He said that he had run into Dusty in the hotel, and Dusty had treated him like a bad guy.  He said that even though he would like to be more to Meg, he realized that what she needed was a friend.  Meg thanked Damian for understanding.\n\n\nCarly and Craig made love in her bedroom, but Craig disliked being in \"Jack Snyder's bed.\"  He told Carly that he could not do it anymore, and he asked her to make it official and marry him.  Carly was stunned and told Craig to forget it, because too much was going on in her life.  Craig promised that they did not have to rush into anything and could give their critics time to get used to the idea.  Carly said that she would need to get Rosanna's approval first, and then she mused that she knew she was going to regret it.\n\n\nCarly and Craig drove to Fairwinds and surprised Rosanna, who immediately became suspicious of why they were there.  Carly jumped right in and reminded her sister how Rosanna had asked for Carly's approval when she was contemplating marrying Craig herself.  Rosanna interjected that they all knew how that had turned out, but Carly continued.  She said that she and Craig were considering getting married and starting a new life with their children.  Carly said that Rosanna's disapproval would be a deal breaker for her.\n\n\nRosanna was stupefied and asked Carly if she loved Craig.  Carly first said that she needed him, and then she turned to Craig and told him that she loved him.  Rosanna thought a bit and then stated that she would not stand in Carly's way as long as her sister loved Craig.  She wished them happiness, just as Paul entered the room.  \n\n\nCraig told Paul to congratulate them because he and Carly were getting married, and Paul asked Carly if she was crazy.  He also asked Rosanna if she was okay with that, but Rosanna said it was between her and her sister.  Paul then offered to buy Carly a bomb sniffing dog as a wedding present, and he also suggested that she find someone to taste her food.  Carly and Rosanna hugged, and the visitors left.\n\n\nPaul could not believe that Rosanna would not do anything to stop the marriage, but Rosanna said that would not happen.  Then she announced that she would be moving out of Fairwinds because it was too comfortable there and too much like her old life.  Paul argued with her for a while, but Rosanna's mind was made up.  Paul offered her a room at the Lakeview, which Rosanna did accept.  She thanked him and went to pack.\n\n\nDusty arrived at Metro and told Bonnie that nothing had changed with Meg; the two of them were still at odds.  Bonnie told him about Derek's visit, which had put her in a bad mood, as well.  Dusty decided they needed to have some fun, so he asked Bonnie to go to dinner and do some dancing.  Bonnie thought about that, but then she refused his invitation by declaring that she would rather stay home and clean her oven than go out with him.\n\n\nCarly and Craig went back to her house, and Craig announced that they were officially engaged.  He wanted to celebrate, so Carly went to get a bottle of sparkling cider from her refrigerator.  First, however, she went to her cupboard and drank heavily from her pint of vodka.  She took the cider into the living room and the two of them toasted their future.  \n\n\nCraig wanted to know if Carly had said that she loved him just to \"seal the deal\" with Rosanna, or if she had meant it.  He told her that he had no expectations on that point, but Carly never answered directly.  Craig smiled and told her that he loved her, too, and they kissed.  They then went upstairs to make love again.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty and Meg watch one another, as she is with Damian and he is with Bonnie. The tension is apparent and Damian thinks that the only way Meg can move on from the past is to talk with Dusty one last time to see if they have a future. Meg decides to take him up on this suggestion. She asks to talk with Dusty, as Bonnie heads out nervously considering her feelings for Dusty are growing but she doesn't want to admit it. Dusty and Meg are on the verge of giving it one more try, but Dusty pushes Meg's buttons again and they realize their problems are still there and neither one of them will back down. They both head off angrily deciding giving it another try was a mistake. Meanwhile, Bonnie is talking with Derek, who suddenly has a change of heart, but she doesn't know where her feelings lie so they get into an argument and Derek stomps off. Later, Dusty confronts Damian and tells him that he is onto him and knows he wasn't on Meg and his side and is only trying to push himself into Meg's life more as her new BFF. Damian calls Dusty on all his mistakes with Meg and how he alone drove her away. Damian later makes a phone call where he tells the person to buy up all Worldwide stock he can and make sure no one knows he is the one doing the buying. Damian later goes to see Meg and tells her that if she only wants a friend for the time being (even though he admits he wants more), he is willing to be patient, as they continue to flirt. Dusty seeks out Bonnie and asks her out to dinner, but Bonnie, who is trying to protect herself, turns him down with an added insult, to seal the deal. Carly continues to drink unbeknownst to everyone. When Craig comes over, she covers by suggesting they go upstairs. Their romp turns into a conversation about their future and Craig asks Carly to marry him. Carly doesn't take him seriously at first, but he convinces her to give it some thought. She won't go further with his suggestion unless Rosanna and her kids get on board. Craig wants them to go talk with her now. Meanwhile, Rosanna is trying to convince Paul that she needs to stand on her own feet, as Paul wants her to stay with him and Eliza and have a makeshift family. She doesn't think it is healthy, but Paul wants her to think about it. After he goes to take Eliza back to the farm, Carly and Craig come by with their news and her blessing. Rosanna is unsure and stunned but asks Carly if she loves him. She needs him, she admits, but then later tells them both she does love Craig. Rosanna begrudgingly gives her blessing. Paul walks in as this is going down and takes some shots at this supposed union, as Rosanna suggests he let this be between her and her sister. Later, Paul wants her to stop this, but this convinces Rosanna more then ever that she can't stay with him because she doesn't want to be the old Rosanna anymore and if she stays with him, she might. Paul offers to get her a room at the Lakeview, as she finally accepts his generosity. Carly and Craig go home to celebrate, as Carly secretly takes more drinks from the hidden vodka bottle before she and Craig head upstairs to celebrate more now as an newly engaged couple. Carly sadly looks at reflection in the mirror before she trails behind Craig as they head upstairs.",
