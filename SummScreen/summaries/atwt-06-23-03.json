Jack proposes that they marry immediately, before the paternity results come in, to prove his commitment to Carly and Sage.  Katie and Mike overhear and offer to take care of Sage while Carly go to the county clerk's office.  Jack graciously admits that Mike could use some time along with Sage.  Carly and Mike meet the colorful county clerk and his wife, Alberta, who are amused to hear Carly's explanation of their recent divorce and the confusion over the baby's parentage.  Unfortunately, the clerk tells Carly and Mike that he must have birth certificates and all other divorce decrees in order for him to perform the marriage.  While Carly and Jack are gone, Mike admits to Katie that he is frightened of bonding with Sage, in case Sage is not his baby.  Katie persuades Mike to stay in Oakdale, even if he has to face the disappointment that Sage is not his daughter.  Carly and Jack return to find Mike feeding Sage.  When Mike hands Sage to Jack, Carly tearfully smiles at the two men.\n\n\nOn the terrace of the Country Club Emma arrives and tells Rosanna about her niece Sage's arrival.  Rosanna admits to Emma that she is jealous of Carly, and Emma suggests that Rosanna take Parker to Montana to be with Carly.  Craig appears and announces that both of them would like to take Parker to Montana.  Emma admits that she feels that this will provide an opportunity for Rosanna and Carly to reconcile, but Rosanna protests to Craig that fate will intervene when it is the right time for her to see Carly and Sage.  At that very moment, Craig's cell phone rings, and Carly asks him to send the birth certificate and divorce decrees from the safe at Monte Carlo.  Craig announces to Rosanna that her old friend fate has intervened, and that Uncle Craig and Auntie Rosanna are on their way to Montana.\n\n\nHolden and Molly enter the police station to find out if there is any news about Lily and Rose. Dusty, who is cuffed to a nearby chair, again insists that, without his help, the police do not stand a chance of finding Lily and Rose.  Dusty tells Holden that both he and Barbara think that James Stenbeck is behind the kidnappings and murders, orchestrating everything from his prison cell.  Dusty brags to Molly that he can get proof of Stenbeck's involvement by confronting Barbara, if Molly will persuade Margo to set him free.  Dusty convinces Molly that Stenbeck wants to get revenge on everyone who hurt Paul, including Rose, Dusty, and Barbara, but Lily was just caught in the crossfire.  Margo arrives at the police station to tell everyone that she and Barbara found McCann dead in Barbara's hotel suite.  Now it is obvious that someone has set up Barbara and Dusty as well.  Molly urges Margo to let Dusty play his hand out before it is too late.  \n\n\nAt Oakdale General Hospital,  Hal, Susan, and Kim discuss the stress Bob is under because of the deaths at the hospital, and the fact that Dr. Decker has been treating Bob for mini-strokes.  Down the hall in Bob's office, a mysterious gloved hand opens Bob's office door.  Bob greets the person, whom the viewer cannot see, and tells the person that he is disturbed by something he read in Nurse Kreb's diary, which is resting on Bob's desk.  Bob demands that the person explain an entry in the diary, or else Bob will call the police and tell them who the killer is.  When Chris storms past Kim, Hal, and Susan, Hal is forced to tell Kim that Chris was suspended for three days after potassium chloride was found in his locker, in spite of the fact that Chris protested that he was planning to use the drug to force a confession out of Dr. Gordon.  At that moment, Bob rushes up and grabs Hal to try to tell him something, but collapses before he can make a sound. The mysterious person, still in Bob's office, takes Nurse Kreb's diary from Bob's desk.  When Dr. Decker sends Chris to Bob's office to retrieve Bob's medication, Chris finds Gordo taking something from a file on Bob's desk.  The two interns scuffle, and Hal breaks up the fight, and afterward Chris refuses to shake hands with Gordo. When Rick Decker comes out to the hall to talk to Kim, Dr. Daniels demands that Dr. Decker be taken off Bob's case and that Dr. Ben Harris take over.  Dr. Harris refuses Dr. Daniel's demand, and Ben and Rick go off together to look after Bob. Hal declares that he has to find out what happened to Bob just before he collapsed.\n\n\nBarbara returns to her suite and is startled to find Dusty behind her.  Dusty insists that Barbara must visit James in prison.  Dusty tells Barbara that SHE killed Paul, and that she must face Stenbeck to help find Rose, the woman whom Paul loved.

    "tvmega_recap": "Jack and Carly decided to remarry in Montana, so they left Sage with Katie and Mike while they went to get a marriage license. While Katie convinced Mike that it was okay to bond with Sage even if he turns out not to be her father, Carly and Jack entertained the county clerk with their sordid story. The clerk told them they needed copies of their other divorce decrees, as well as their birth certificates. Carly called Craig, asking him to messenger the papers to her. Craig told Rosanna they should instead take Emma's advice, and take the papers and Parker to Montana themselves for the wedding. Rosanna balked at the idea. After convincing Molly, Holden, and Margo that he can help if he is released from jail, Dusty confronted Barbara about Lily and Rose's kidnapping. He convinced her to visit James in jail, for Paul's sake. Bob confronted a mystery visitor about an entry in the late Nurse Krebs's diary. Later, he tried to tell something to Hal, but instead collapsed in his arms in front of Kim and Susan. Walker suggested that Rick be taken off Bob's case, but Kim refused. Rick later told Kim that Bob is in a coma. Chris discovered Gordo searching Bob's desk, but Gordo insisted he only wanted to see his own personnel file.",
