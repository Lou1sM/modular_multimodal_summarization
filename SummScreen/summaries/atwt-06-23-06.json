Katie acts surprised, too, but Mike begins to realize that Katie already knew that Simon was on board. She takes Mike back to their cabin and explains to him about the massage, saying she hid Simon in the bathroom when Mike came back because she knew how upset he'd be if he saw Simon. Katie tells Mike she does not have any feelings for Simon any more, and he says he realizes that, that he's not jealous or insecure; it's just that Simon is bad news. Katie tells him she knows that now, that years ago, she wanted a fairy tale with Simon, but now she wants a real man in a real life and that she loves Mike more than she's ever loved anyone before. They kiss.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Simon tells Vienna that Katie was his wife, and she asks if she was the \"one who got away.\" Simon says yes, but Vienna tells him all that matters is the present. She strips to her undergarments, but as she and Simon kiss, she begins to feel seasick and has to go to the bathroom.

Gwen comes outside and asks Jade to check out the boys' bedroom, where she can sleep; after Jade goes in, Gwen asks Will what he's so upset about. Will says he doesn't want Jade anywhere near them; Gwen says she thought Will wanted her, Casey, and Maddie to give Jade a break and try to help her. She says she's forgiven both Will and Jade for the whole school cheating thing, so unless there's something else going on, Jade should at least spend the night. Will agrees.
