    "soap_central": "\n\nMeg and Paul went by Memorial to pick up Barbara where she was recovering from the morphine overdose that Sofie had caused. The pair told Barbara they had managed to get her released into Meg's care. Barbara was happy to learn she was going home, but was even more pleased to see Paul and Meg happy together. While Barbara met with her doctors, Meg and Paul stepped into the hall to talk and Meg warned Paul that someone needed to stop Sofie before she hurt someone else. Paul was not convinced Sofie was behind the poisoning, but Meg persuaded Paul to keep the people he loved far away from Sofie. \n\n\nOnce Meg and Paul got Barbara home, Paul went to Lisa and explained to her that he and Meg believed Sofie was behind Barbara's medicine being switched. Lisa was appalled by Sofie's actions and agreed to kick her out of the Lakeview right away. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Sofie gossiped with the front desk clerk about Barbara's overdose and insinuated that Meg was responsible. Mike overheard Sofie talking and asked to speak with her, but Sofie told him she did not want to talk to him and walked away. Mike followed Sofie into the bar and Sofie lashed out at Mike for telling Meg where she went to high school. Mike accused Sofie of lying about Paul attacking her. Sofie told Mike she would never speak to him again and stormed off. \n\n\nAfter her confrontation with Mike, Sofie ran into Lisa in the lobby and Lisa informed Sofie that she needed to vacate her room immediately. Sofie began to scream that Meg was behind her eviction, but Lisa told her she needed to go quietly or Lisa would call security. Right after Lisa walked away, Meg exited the elevator and Sofie accused Meg of ruining her life. As Sofie raised her hand to slap Meg, Meg grabbed it and told Sofie she was responsible for her own problems. Meg could no longer stifle her anger and told Sofie that she was grateful Gwen had adopted Hallie, Sofie's biological daughter, so that Hallie would never have to deal with a crazy mother like Sofie. Shocked by Meg's words, Sofie collapsed on the floor. Meg was not convinced that Sofie had really fainted, but bent down to check on her, anyway. Just then Paul arrived and when Sofie came to, she asked Paul to make Meg leave, but instead Paul shocked Sofie by telling her it was time for her to leave the Lakeview. Sofie realized Paul was behind her eviction and she hurried off to her room. Paul turned to Meg and asked her to forget about Sofie and join him upstairs in Barbara's room. \n\n\nA short time later, Mike walked into the lobby and heard Lisa telling the front desk clerk that Sofie had been evicted. He rushed up to Sofie's room to check on her. Sofie was reluctant to open the door, but did when Mike offered to help. Mike explained he felt responsible because he pushed her to report Paul to the police and had since come to believe she had not been attacked and that she needed psychiatric help. Sofie stopped him and angrily said he sounded like Meg. With that she opened the door and told Mike to get out. Mike noticed that Sofie looked faint and told her to take care of herself. \n\n\nWhen Paul and Meg returned to Barbara's suite they told her about Sofie leaving the Lakeview. Meg was hopeful that with Sofie gone their lives would be less hectic, but Paul said he did not want things to go back to normal. He told Meg and Barbara he had a surprise and then he dropped to his knee and asked Meg to marry him. Both Meg and Barbara were completely stunned and Meg admitted she was not sure if she could marry Paul. After some thought, Meg happily accepted Paul's proposal. Paul slipped a huge engagement ring on Meg's finger and promised \"not to screw it up this time.\" As he and Meg celebrated their engagement, Paul's phone rang and Sofie demanded he come to her room right away because she had something to tell him. Paul told Meg about the call and she encouraged him to go and tell Sofie about their plans to marry. Meg believed there was nothing more Sofie could do to tear them apart. Once Paul arrived, Sofie greeted him with a hug and told him she was pregnant. \n\n\nKatie went to Al's Diner and when Janet saw her there, she assumed Katie wanted to know how her evening had gone with Jack. Janet took her break and sat down with Katie, but Katie did not want to talk about Jack and just wanted to give Janet her lunch order. Janet would not let the subject of Jack go and continued to talk about how wonderful Jack was. Katie realized that Janet was trying to use Jack to make Brad jealous and Katie warned Janet she would regret it if she hurt Jack. Janet said she and Jack were just friends and she had no intention of hurting him. Katie thanked Janet for her candor and admitted that she still cared for Jack and did not want to see him sad. Janet told Katie her shift was over and she needed to take care of some errands. She left the diner. \n\n\nBrad arrived at the farm to see Jack and tried to get his brother to tell him what happened with Janet. Brad warned Jack that Janet was not the woman for him because she was \"too high-spirited\" for him and the last thing Brad thought Jack needed was another woman full of spunk. Even though Brad was married to Katie, Jack felt Brad was trying to keep Janet for himself. Brad laughed off Jack's accusations and warned Jack that Janet was using him to make Brad jealous. Jack reassured Brad that he and Janet were just friends. As Brad tried to set Jack up with another woman, Janet arrived with a gift for Jack. Despite Brad's warnings, or maybe because of them, Jack invited Janet to go with him to watch Parker's tennis match and she accepted. \n\n\nBrad met up with Katie at work and Katie immediately noticed that Brad was in a bad mood. She asked him what was wrong, but Brad ignored her question and then insisted that Katie stay clear of Jack and Janet. Katie was not happy with Brad's order, but let it go when Brad admitted he was having a bad day. Brad decided that he and Katie needed a little sun and he claimed he wanted to go see his nephew play tennis, but really Brad knew Jack and Janet would be at the match and he wanted to spy on the new couple. Katie agreed to go and the two left the station. \n\n\nLiberty arrived to watch Parker's practice before his game and her appearance caused Parker to lose his concentration. Parker's coach kept reminding him to keep his eye on the ball and not the stands, but Parker could not seem to get his mind off of Liberty. When Parker's coach told him to take a break, Liberty walked up and apologized for distracting him. Parker refused to admit that Liberty was the reason he struggled with his game, but his next serve went straight into the net and proved to everyone that Liberty was the cause. \n\n\nAs Parker's tennis game was set to start, Janet and Jack arrived followed a short time later by Brad and Katie. Jack and Katie both commented at what a funny coincidence it was that everyone showed up to see Parker play. Liberty took Brad and Janet's hands and had them sit with her on the bench, leaving Jack and Katie to feel like outsiders throughout Parker's game. When Parker won his game, Liberty rushed up to him and congratulated him on a job well done. She could not let Parker think she was too impressed and told him to shower before he offended the entire crowd. \n\n\nAfter the game, Jack invited Liberty and Janet to go to dinner with him and Parker, and they agreed. Once they were at Al's Diner, Janet thanked Jack for getting her more time with Liberty. After dinner Liberty and Parker went outside and Liberty again asked Parker to do her homework for her. Before Parker could answer, Jack and Janet came out and Janet took Liberty back to Brad's house. \n\n\nBrad and Katie returned to their home, where Brad accused Jack of trying to take Liberty away. Katie realized that Brad knew Jack and Janet were going to be at the game and told Brad she was sick and tired of his sibling rivalry with Jack. When Liberty and Janet came home, Brad asked Janet what was really going on between her and Jack. Janet told Brad she and Jack were just friends, but she hinted that she would not be surprised if something more romantic developed between them.\n\n\n",
