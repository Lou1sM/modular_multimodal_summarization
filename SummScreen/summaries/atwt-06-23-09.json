    "soap_central": "\n\n \nEmily met with her ex-stepfather, Larry, at the Lakeview, and she asked him for further help in locating her missing eggs.  Larry still maintained that he had not signed the receipt, but Emily said that she had consulted a handwriting expert, and the signature was Larry's.  Emily demanded to know \"why the hell\" he had taken her eggs, but Larry had no explanation other than he might have signed the receipt while it was mixed in with other papers.  He explained that harvested eggs were valuable not just for implantation but also for research.  Anyone could have taken them for the genetic material they contained.\n\n\nEmily fiercely wanted her eggs back, but Larry cautioned that perhaps that was not the best solution.  He reminded her that the eggs had been frozen for twenty years, and they could be damaged.  He suggested that she try to reverse her tubal ligation, but Emily was wary of that.  Larry said a sonogram would tell her right away if she was a good candidate for a reversal.  He recommended a fertility specialist who had just transferred to Memorial, and who was a good friend of his.  Emily agreed to the sonogram, and Larry offered to take Emily back to the hospital right away.\n\n\nThe two of them got up to leave as Susan walked into the Lakeview lounge.  She questioned what Emily and Larry were doing there, and when she learned that Larry was \"helping\" her daughter, Susan loudly told Larry that he was \"full of it.\" Emily challenged her mother, but Susan demanded to make all the arrangements that Emily would need.  She made more nasty remarks about Larry, but Emily defended him.  Susan told Larry to butt out of her family business and accused him of kissing up to Emily in order to get closer to Alison.  Emily chose to leave with Larry, and they walked out on Susan.\n\n\nAt Java, Alison talked with Riley, who was reading the classified ads for an apartment to rent.  She asked him why he hadn't stayed at the Hugheses' house until he found a place, but Riley said she should ask her boyfriend that question.\n\n\nCasey went into the kitchen at his house and found Margo taking the day off.  She said that she didn't feel too well, so Casey offered to take her out to breakfast, but his mother declined.  She sent Casey off to work, and when he got to the hospital, he ran up and surprised Alison with a kiss.  Alison scolded him about kicking Riley out of his house and for continuing to ask her to hide Riley's watch.  She told Casey to tell his mother the truth about the watch, but Casey said that he had a good reason to swipe it.  He said that Margo needed to grieve for Adam instead of recreating him in a stranger.  Alison could see the point to that, but she still worried that Riley had no place to stay.  She was afraid that he would leave town, and she and Casey started shouting until Casey stormed out.\n\n\nNoah told Luke that the Army had refused him access to the base at Fort Leonard Wood for his film project.  Luke reminded him that Lieutenant Hasbro, whom Noah had interviewed, might be in a position to help.  Noah thought that was a great idea, and he placed the call.  The sergeant in Hasbro's office told Noah that the only way that the Army would allow him to film on a base was if he was in the military or affiliated with military personnel.  Luke thought the situation was weird, but then he thought of Riley Morgan, and wondered if perhaps Riley could help, since he was in the military.\n\n\nNoah was skeptical about asking Riley because of his initial reaction to him, along with Casey's obvious dislike.  The boys went to Java and talked with Riley, however.  They explained their problem, and Riley told them that his tour with the military was over.  Noah then suggested that Riley go talk with Hasbro and put in a good word for them.  Noah took a call and walked away from the table, while Luke tried to persuade Riley to do them the favor.  Noah came back, and Riley agreed to help them if for no other reason than to prove that he was a nice guy.\n\n\nMargo went to the hospital and talked with Alison.  She was hoping to talk to Dr. Bob, but Alison said that he was away all day at a conference.  Margo was looking for a prescription for an anti-depressant, and she suddenly broke down in tears.  Alison took her into a private room, and Margo began questioning Riley's story about knowing Adam, and then the part about Casey's taking his watch.  She was unhappy about not supporting Casey better.  \n\n\nAlison tried to be helpful, and then Margo began talking about Riley's relationship with Adam and what a comfort that was to her.  Alison got Riley's watch from her locker and handed it to Margo.  Margo demanded to know if Casey had given it to her, and Alison attempted to defend her boyfriend.\n\n\nCasey walked in and saw his mother holding Riley's watch.  He told her that he had taken to watch to give her a wake-up call, but Margo thought he had done it to hurt Riley.  She hoped that Riley would forgive them and \"come home.\"  Casey protested and said that he could not do as she asked and make the stranger feel at home in their house.  Margo took the watch and walked out.\n\n\nCasey scolded Alison for ratting him out, and he was unhappy that his mother was probably going to invite Riley back into their home.  He felt that Alison, who was supposed to be his girlfriend, had betrayed him.  Alison also felt let down for Casey's involving her in his lies to his mother.  Casey had no idea what to tell Margo, and he was very angry with Alison.  He told her that he needed to prove that Riley was a bad guy, and if that required lying to his folks or to Alison, then that was what he would do.  Alison cried that they did not have much of a relationship left, and Casey shouted, \"The hell with it!\" and he rushed out.\n\n\nRiley went to Lt. Hasbro's office and knocked.  A voice summoned him inside, and Riley opened the door to find a man wearing camouflage and puffing on a big cigar.  Riley challenged the man by saying that he was not Lt. Hasbro, and the man countered by saying that his visitor was not Riley Morgan.  Riley asked the man to identify himself, and he said he was Colonel Winston Mayer.  \n\n\nRiley recognized him as Noah's father, supposedly dead.  Mayer said that he would tell Noah that he was alive when the time was right.  The colonel knew about Noah's film project, but when Riley stated that he would have to tell the boy that his dad was alive, May er said that Riley would not say a word on that subject.   He said he knew all about Riley Morgan, and the two of them were going to keep each other's secrets, and then the colonel laughed.\n\n\nRiley went back to Luke's house and reported that he had both good news and bad.  The good news was that Noah had permission to visit any military base he wanted for his film.  The bad news was that the invitation extended only to Noah, no one else.  In other words, Luke could not accompany Noah on his visits.  Noah complained that he needed Luke to do the shooting and some sound work, but Riley said that he had explained all that to Hasbro, and the rule stood.  Noah was upset, but Luke told Riley to accept Hasbro's terms.  Riley left, and Luke consoled Noah that he would find a way around the rules.\n\n\nMargo was in Al's when Riley walked in.  She called him over, but he refused a sandwich.  He sat with her reluctantly, and Margo returned his watch and invited him to move back into their home.  She said that because Adam was gone, she needed to make amends through Riley.  She admitted that Casey was angry at Adam and had been taking it out on Riley.  Both of them decided that they could deal with Casey on the home front.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Emily's sonogram revealed that a reversal of her tubal ligation would most likely not result in a pregnancy.  Larry had other options to present to her, but Emily asked first to go to the University of Chicago to see if the doctors there could locate her missing eggs.  Larry agreed to take her there, but first he asked for a chance to search the records at Memorial himself.  He left Emily and promised to report back.  Susan approached her daughter and referred to the departing Larry as a \"scurrying rat.\"  Emily told her mother that Larry was the only one who was giving her hope.\n\n\nCasey went to Luke's and announced to him and Noah that Alison had broken up with him because of Riley.  He declared that Riley was evil, and he praised Noah for seeing it, as well.  Noah spoke up and said that he had changed his mind on that subject since he had gotten to know Riley better.  Casey got angry and left in a hurry.  Luke assured Noah that he was with him all the way.\n\n\nAlison and Riley ran into each other in Old Town, and she apologized for not saying anything about his watch.  She walked off, looking sad, and Riley made a call.  He spoke with Colonel Mayer and reported that Noah would be traveling alone to the Army base.\n\n\nCasey went home and called the Veterans Administration in Washington, DC.  He wanted information on someone deployed in Afghanistan and got put on hold.  He vowed to find out who Riley Morgan really was.\n\n\n",
