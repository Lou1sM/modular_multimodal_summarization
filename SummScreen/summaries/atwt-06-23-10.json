    "soap_central": "\n\nLuke noticed Reid watching him and Noah as they laughed over old times in Java, and when the doctor turned and took off, Luke hesitated just a moment, as Noah urged him to \"Go after him.\"  Luke caught up with Reid in Old Town, and he begged Reid to talk.  Luke reminded Reid how small Oakdale was and how often they ran in to each other.  \"Not for much longer,\" mumbled Dr. Oliver.  Luke didn't understand the comment, but it hurt his feelings.  Luke returned to Noah and apologized for running out on him.  He also was sorry for hurting Noah, who said he was uncomfortable with the whole conversation and walked out in a huff.\n\n\nAt the farm, Molly asked Holden if he was out of his mind for suggesting that they get married that day.  Holden assured her that no one was looking into the Whitman case, so Molly was totally in the clear.  He wanted to begin their life together immediately, and he suggested they go to City Hall and tie the knot.  Holden was looking forward to falling asleep that night next to his new wife.  Molly finally agreed, and she told him he could sell ice cream to an Eskimo.  Holden promised to make all the wedding arrangements, and Molly only had to figure out what to wear.\n\n\nHolden took off for town, and Molly found an appropriate white dress in her closet.  She also picked some of Emma's wildflowers and formed them into a bouquet.  She took a call from Kim, who was very excited that she had arranged with the State Department for Molly to go to Chile with the official rebuilding team after the earthquake.  Kim promised Molly unlimited access for her coverage, and she was sure the story would go national.  Kim explained that the transport was leaving later in the day, so Molly had to hustle.  Molly said she was very flattered, but she turned Kim down, saying, \"I'm getting married today!\"\n\n\nBob joined Kim for lunch at Al's, but he was very late.  He explained that \"all hell\" had broken loose at the hospital, and declared that love had conquered all because Reid Oliver had quit his job at Memorial for Luke Snyder.  Kim could not believe that Bob had let Dr. Oliver walk out, and she stated that the \"whole Invicta thing\" was way out of control.  Kim criticized her husband for issuing the ultimatum to Reid in the first place and for buying into Mona Cross's view of looking at Memorial as a profit generator rather than a caring hospital.  Kim suggested that Bob find a way to get Reid back on board, and she left to go back to work at WOAK.\n\n\nHolden met with a friend of his, Judge Murdock, at the Lakeview and arranged to cut through some of the red tape necessary to get married immediately.  Luke walked in as the judge was leaving, and Holden told his son that he and Molly were getting married that afternoon.  Luke wished his father well, and explained that he was there to meet with Bob again.  Bob arrived as Holden walked out, and he told Luke that he was glad they were the first ones there because he wanted to talk about \"Reid's decision.\"  Luke looked uncomfortable and suddenly said he had to reschedule.  He ran off, leaving Bob puzzled.\n\n\nAt Worldwide, Lucinda arrived, and Lily immediately scolded her mother and waved the Whitman forensic report in her face.  Lily was not happy that Lucinda had forged ahead on her own, despite Lily's wishes otherwise.  Lucinda grabbed the report and gave her daughter a tongue-lashing about putting herself on a marble pedestal.  She glanced at the report and said that the sheriff had made a bad call because Silas had died because he had threatened Molly, not because he was physically attacking her.  Lucinda suggested that they use the report to drive a wedge between Holden and Molly, and she began to read the findings more carefully.\n\n\nWhen she finished, Lucinda was even more convinced that Molly should be in \"an orange jumpsuit\" because the woman was a \"cold-blooded murderer.\"  She also had Lily read it more carefully, and her daughter muttered, \"Oh, my God!\" when she had finished.  Lily asked whether Molly would go to prison if Lily went to the police, and Lucinda quipped, \"Works for me.\"  Lucinda claimed to see the \"big picture,\" and Lily needed to make the right choice or she would always regret letting Holden get away.  Lily said it was not her choice to make; it was Holden's.  She refused to \"play dirty,\" and a disgusted Lucinda walked out.  Lily decided to leave the office to her mother.\n\n\nLooking for his mother, Luke arrived at Worldwide, but he found only Lucinda.  He told his grandmother about his dad's impending marriage to Molly, but Lucinda only laughed.  She declared that impossible, but Luke explained that Judge Murdock was performing the ceremony in his chambers in just a few hours.  Lucinda said that thanks to her, Lily had ample ammunition to blow Holden and Molly's relationship sky high.  She grabbed her phone to call Lily, but Luke stopped her by reminding her that if it wasn't her relationship, it wasn't her business.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Noah saw Dr. Oliver carrying out a box of his belongings.  He asked if Reid had gotten fired, but Oliver said he had quit.  Noah was puzzled, but Dr. Oliver said Noah had won and advised him not to ask questions.  Noah went back to Java and found that Luke had returned, as well.  Noah said he had run into Reid at the hospital, and the doctor had admitted that he had quit his job.  Luke was stunned, but Noah said he had seen Reid carrying out his stuff.  Luke asked what he should do, but Noah said he couldn't answer that.  Luke thanked him, and he took off.\n\n\nBob also ran into Reid in the hospital, and he offered to write the man a \"glowing recommendation.\"  Oliver said he was a superb surgeon, and his reputation preceded him, so he had no use for recommendations.  He made some other disparaging comments to the \"Chief,\" and ended the conversation by saying, \"Thanks for nothing.\"\n\n\nKim hunted for Bob in the hospital, and he told her that Mona Cross had told him \"no way, no how\" when he had asked if a donor and a staff member could carry on a personal relationship.  Bob also said he had run into Reid Oliver, who had wished him dead.  Kim urged him to call off the terrible deal with Invicta, but Bob was not in a mood to hear that.  He confessed, however, that he would miss having Reid Oliver around, eccentricities and all.\n\n\nReid took his possessions home to Katie's house and found a babysitter there.  He said he would take over with Jacob, and he overpaid the girl, and told her to  \"buy a Scrunchie.\"  He headed for the refrigerator, but, for once, nothing appealed to the doctor.  He found Jacob's bear on the floor, and he noticed a big hole in the bear's leg.  He got out Katie's sewing kit and began mending the bear.  His phone rang, but he did not pick up when he saw that the caller was Luke.  On the other end of the call, Noah watched Luke agonizing outside Java, but he passed by without speaking.\n\n\nMolly, dressed in her white dress, put the finishing touches on her flowers when Lily walked into the kitchen unexpectedly.  She asked what was going on, so Molly said that she and Holden were getting married right away.  Lily called that \"a very bad idea.\"  She continued that Holden had only proposed after Molly had shot her ex-lover \"in cold blood.\"  Molly again claimed self-defense, but Lily said that Holden had only felt sorry for her.  \"Feel better now?\" asked a peeved Molly.  The conversation turned bitter, and Lily finally showed Molly the forensic report. She then stated that she knew Holden and Molly were hiding something when she saw them burning the DVDs by the pond.\n\n\nLily told Molly that the \"quickie wedding\" was so that Holden would not have to testify against Molly in court.  Molly reminded Lily that the Whitman case was closed, but Lily warned that \"things could change,\" and she called Molly \"guilty as sin.\"  She charged that the marriage was doomed because the truth would emerge.  Lily said she wasn't sure what she was going to do, as Molly sobbed.\n\n\nNot long afterward, Holden arrived home and found Molly's bouquet dumped by the sink and a note from her.  The note said that they could not get married that day because she had to work.  She said she was sorry, and Holden ran out.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Molly spoke to Kim and said that she wanted the Chile assignment after all.  She had packed a bag and had her passport with her, but Kim asked what had happened.  Kim suggested that with all the drama in Molly's life lately, it was a bad idea for her to go into a disaster area.  Molly began to cry, and she said that girls like Molly Conlan didn't get \"happy endings.\"  Kim calmed her down and said Molly needed to think long and hard before she accepted the overseas assignment.\n\n\nHolden walked in, so Kim excused herself.  Molly said she could not marry him because of how it would impact his whole family.  Holden wanted to know what had happened, so a tearful Molly told him that Lily had said that she had proof that Molly had shot Silas in cold blood.  She explained about the forensic file from LaSalle County but said she hadn't actually read it.  Molly was afraid she could never marry Holden, and he said he understood, but he didn't want her running off, either.  He kissed her and walked out.\n\n\nLucinda walked into Molly's office and closed the door.  She announced that Molly was \"in big trouble,\" because they had iron-clad evidence that Silas Whitman's murder -- Molly interrupted to sadly say that Lucinda had already won.\n\n\nLily was at the Snyder pond when Holden found her.  He said that he knew she had evidence that the shooting was not self-defense, but he asked her to let it go, for him.\n\n\n",
