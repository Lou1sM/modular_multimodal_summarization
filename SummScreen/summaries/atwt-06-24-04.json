Jessica said that he was just worried about Margo finding out because Doc still wants to be with Margo. Meanwhile Margo arrived at Kim's to pick up Tom. Margo was in a good mood until Tom told her that something was seriously wrong.  Nancy, Bob and Kim walked in and interrupted them. Nancy told Margo that the jeweler couldn't get the locket for Katie engraved before the party. Tom pretended that was what was seriously wrong. Margo doesn't buy it but made an excuse to leave the room. Bob asked Tom if he said anything to Margo. Tom said no but was very angry. Bob tried to calm him but Tom said he had been through this before and he knew the signs. Bob suggested to Tom that he and Margo stay to talk but he refused and they all left for the party. At the party, Tom got upset when one of the guests brought up Doc's name. Bob followed Tom outside trying to calm him down. Tom yelled out about Margo sleeping with Doc just as Kim opened the door. Later, Kim went looking for Doc and Margo tried to get Tom to tell her what was wrong. Tom shouted at her to go ask Doc Reese and that he knew what she did!\n\n\nKatie was in her room talking to Snickers. Pilar came in and raised a knife at an unsuspecting Katie. Simon called out and Pilar ran into the other room. Once Simon and Katie were together, Pilar repeated the same motion but was interrupted by Henry. Henry was trying to be brave and upbeat but turned melancholy when he admitted that he would miss Katie and wasn't sure she should go. Katie tried to reassure him that it wouldn't be forever and that Henry should find a girl. After they left to go downstairs, Pilar came back in, took Snickers, and waited for Katie to come back upstairs. Downstairs Simon was talking to Nancy and brought up Pilar's name. Nancy said she wasn't aware he knew Pilar and, as Henry listened, quickly denied knowing her. Later, Henry confronted Simon and Katie heard the exchange. Simon denied it and Katie believed him telling him that she got the creeps every time she heard Pilar's name. Katie went to get Snickers and, when she walked in her room, discovered Pilar holding Snickers with a knife to his head. Pilar said that rabbits only make noise when they felt threatened and would soon find out if it was true. \n\n\nRosanna was frantic because Cabot was crying so she called and left Carly a message for help. Jordan came in and offered to help. Paul walked in and asked Jordan if he was applying for a job as a nanny. Jordan said he wouldn't mind and told Paul that he was willing to do anything to make it easier for Rosanna. Paul was skeptical and offered to help Rosanna take Cabot up to his room. Jennifer came in and after a kiss hello, told Jordan that she had everything set up for Cabot at Barbara's. Rosanna walked in and told Jordan that Cabot would not leave the house unless he was with her. Jordan told her that she had to stop being so paranoid about his wanting to be with Cabot. Rosanna said that Cabot had been going so much and he needed some stability. Jordan agreed saying that, for now, Cabot would stay where he was at. Rosanna paused for a moment and then suggested that Jordan move in with her, much to Paul and Jennifer's dismay. Jordan said he would move in until they could work out an agreement. Later, Jordan asked Jennifer if she was okay with it. At first, Jennifer was a little upset but then realized that Jordan just wanted what was best for Cabot. Meanwhile, Paul told Rosanna that James would always be watching and offered Rosanna some protection.  \n\n\n",
