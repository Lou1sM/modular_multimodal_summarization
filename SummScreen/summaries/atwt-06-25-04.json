She will need Mike's statement to corroborate Katie's however.  Margo leaves and Mike takes a final look at the boathouse.  He picks up the sign that he made, and looks questionably at it.  Back at Katie and Simon's,  he is telling her that he wants her, he wants to start over with her but they do not have to leave.  Katie looks at him, and says, \"Pilar said that you break your promises, that I would be better off dead than with a lifetime with you.  She acted like she hated you but she didn't even know you.  Why would she do that?  \n\n\nTom is arguing with Margo.  Margo tells him she went to see Doc to tell him to back off. Every time she saw him, he was always making comments.  Tom tells her, she wasn't going there to tell him to stop it.  He thinks she was going there because she liked it a lot.  Tom says that most guys don't let it go on that long unless they are getting a little encouragement.  Tom goes outside, followed by Margo.  She says you have seen him in action, you know how he is.  Don't tell me I gave him any encouragement, because I didn't.  Tom wants to know if she was so uncomfortable around him, why didn't she say something? She explains that she was trying not to make a big deal out of it.  Tom tells her that he lives in the same house with her.  The silence was deafening and she was never where she was supposed to be.  Margo relents, and tells Tom, all right.  I liked the attention,  and he noticed me.  He made me feel young and he made me feel pretty, the way you used to.  Tom is furious.

Jessica goes to Tom and Margo's with news.  Tom tells her it is not a good time.  Jessica tells him that Margo should give Katie a call.  They may have to delay their plans to leave.  Margo comes back downstairs preparing to leave.  She tells them that Pilar kidnapped Katie.  She never should have left her sister alone.  She goes out the door.  Jessica tells Tom that whatever the tension is between the two of them, Margo didn't do anything wrong.  Tom is miffed because Margo went to Jessica to talk .  She tells him  that Margo may be having some midlife crisis but she is not having an affair.\n\n\nKim is speaking with Doc.  She tells him that he better not hurt anyone in her family.
