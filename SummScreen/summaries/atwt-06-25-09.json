Carly took the flowers into the kitchen to put them in water, and Craig figured out that she had had not yet broken the news to Jack.  Carly promised to tell Jack right away, but Craig decided that he would tell Jack himself.  Carly said that she found that amusing, as she arranged the blooms in a vase.  Craig suggested that she concentrate on how she would tell her children, and he would handle her ex.  Craig said goodbye and walked out.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet was jealous that Jack had the day off, and she had to work.  Jack thought he would go see his kids and talk to them about Fourth of July plans.  Janet accused him of just wanting to check up on Carly, and she warned him to get used to the fact that Craig was a big part of Carly's life.  Jack took off, and Craig appeared not long afterward.  Janet was surprised that Craig had not seen Jack along the way, but she invited him in. \n\n\nCraig announced that he and Carly were engaged, and he noticed that Janet was not particularly overjoyed.  They discussed Carly's role as a mother to Johnny, and Craig was looking forward to that.  Janet said that she had been secretly hoping that Carly would get remarried, but she was counting on its being someone from Omaha who would spirit her away.  She wished Craig good luck.\n\n\nCarly talked with Parker and Sage, who were eager to get places they needed to go. She began the conversation by telling the kids that positive changes were good, and she was just about to break the news of her engagement, when a knock on the door interrupted her.  The visitor was Jack, who wanted to know what was going on.  Sage finally spoke up and said that Carly was about to tell them that she was marrying Craig.  \n\n\nJack laughed and told Sage that she was quite the jokester.  When Carly said that Craig was headed out to the farm to talk with Jack, Parker muttered, \"Oh, my God, Sage was right!\"  Jack asked Carly if Sage was correct, and Carly confirmed it.  Jack laughed and congratulated Carly.  Everyone looked at Jack and said, \"That's it?\"\n\n\nSage asked Carly if she really loved Craig the way that she had loved Jack, and Carly was stumped for the right answer.  Jack jumped in and said that, of course, Carly did.  Sage asked to go, and Carly gave the children permission to leave, but they only went as far as the front porch.  Carly thanked Jack for remaining calm, but Jack said that he was married to someone else and had no right to tell Carly how to live her life.  Then Jack asked the same question about her feelings for Craig, and Carly's answer was that Craig was just what she needed.  She denied that she was an alcoholic and, in fact, did not even drink at all anymore, thanks to Craig.  She asked for Jack's blessing, but he stopped short of granting it.\n\n\nJack found the kids on the porch discussing the nuptials as he left.   Sage said to Parker that she did not have a trust fund like his, so he could be \"Mr. Suck Up\" to Craig as much as he wanted, but she didn't have to.  Parker asked his sister to give the marriage a chance for their mother's sake.  Jack went down the steps, and Sage walked him to his car. Parker went inside and walked in on Carly downing a tumbler full of vodka.  He accused her of still drinking, but Carly denied it and told her son that she had been drinking only tap water.  Parker saw the empty vodka pint on the counter, however.\n\n\nBrad told Katie that he hated that she was going to the doctor for a checkup without him-and in a cab.   He felt guilty for abandoning Katie for an appearance on \"Oakdale Now\" with the horrible Geneva Swift.  Katie assured Brad that Geneva was a fad who would burn out fast.  Brad discussed calling Henry to ask him to take Katie to her appointment, but Katie grabbed his phone and told her husband that Henry was too busy, and he was also still mourning the loss of his baby.  Brad agreed and said that he hoped that Katie would watch the show as he cut Geneva down to size.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Henry, a.k.a. \"Geneva Swift,\" hid his costume as Vienna put the finishing touches on her makeup.  She was nervous because Kim wanted her to try pole dancing on the show.  Henry was horrified and called pole dancing \"lewd, lascivious, and licentious.\"  Vienna said that he sounded just like Geneva Swift, and she asked Henry to stand still and play the part of the pole while she tried a few moves.  She twirled around him once, and Henry grabbed her and threw her on the bed.  Vienna escaped and hurried to work.\n\n\nKatie opened her door to find \"Geneva Swift\" outside.  Henry told her that he had an emergency and needed her help to get his breasts on straight.  Katie said that was probably the weirdest thing a man had ever said to her.  First she worked on a stuck zipper in the back of Geneva's dress, as Henry admitted that he had signed a contract to be a regular on \"Oakdale Now.\"  He assured Katie that he would not get caught until he had accomplished his mission of getting Vienna to stop making a sexual spectacle of herself on television.  Katie evened up his mammaries and sent him on his way.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Vienna and Brad arrived at the same time, and Kim grumbled that Geneva Swift was not yet there.  Vienna practiced a few moves for the pole dancing, but she had a misstep and landed hard on her backside.  She moaned and cried about pain in her back, but she did not want to abandon the show.  Kim called for an ambulance, which transported Vienna to Memorial.\n\n\nHenry, dressed as Geneva, walked through Old Town on his way to the studio.  Two women recognized him from the show and raved about his performance.  They said that they watched every day that Geneva was on.  Henry was extremely flattered.\n\n\nKim and Brad discussed how to handle Vienna's departure, and Geneva Swift arrived.  Kim explained that she needed Geneva to play a different role and asked her what she knew about pole dancing. Geneva said she was befuddled about being asked to be a sexual gymnast, but a stern Kim reminded her to read her contract, because she had agreed to do whatever the producers requested.  Kim placed Geneva and Brad in front of the pole and asked them to be themselves and act naturally.  She counted down the opening, and Brad did the introduction.  He turned it over to Geneva who gave a pitch for the cardio-vascular benefits of pole dancing, which set Brad off on a fit of giggles.\n\n\nHenry, as Geneva, walked slowly around the pole and lifted her feet and smacked her butt on the floor.  Brad made a nasty comment, as Geneva asked for help up.  Geneva challenged Brad to try the pole, so he took a flying leap at it and also smacked the floor.  Geneva picked up Brad's leg and began twisting it, as Kim gave the \"end segment\" gesture, and Brad signed off.  Suddenly Geneva's admirers from Old Town swarmed the studio asking for autographs, including an older gentleman \"admirer.\"\n\n\nKatie went to the hospital for her appointment and was stunned to see Vienna in the hall on a gurney.   Vienna explained about her back and asked Katie to call Henry and ask him to find her at the hospital.  Katie sat with Vienna and lied about where Henry might be.  Vienna wanted to watch \"Oakdale Now\" on the television, but Katie grabbed the remote just as the doctor entered.  Katie went outside and left another message for Henry, warning him to get out of his dress and to Memorial right away.\n\n\nJack returned to the farm and found Craig and Janet talking.  Janet asked if Jack had told his kids the news, and he said that Parker and Sage were okay with it.  Jack and Craig began trading barbs, and Jack moaned that Carly was making the worst decision of her life. Craig left, and suddenly Parker walked in, looking stunned.  He told Jack that Carly was in trouble, and he had seen his mother drinking vodka.  Jack said that he would go talk with her, and Janet took Parker to the diner for their work shifts.\n\n\nCraig returned to Carly's and asked her how Jack had taken the news.  Craig tried to kiss her, but she wriggled out of his arms and headed to the kitchen \"to make coffee.\"  Craig looked suddenly wary.  Carly poured the coffee, and Jack walked in unannounced.  He lit into Craig for allowing Carly to lie and then covering for her.  \n\n\nCraig said that he had no idea what Jack was talking about until Jack responded that Carly was still drinking.  Carly denied that, but Jack said that Parker had told him what he had witnessed.  Craig put it off to Parker's being upset about the engagement, so Jack asked Carly again.  Carly said that she had not been drinking, and she pled with Craig to tell her that he believed her.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Katie left another message for Henry.  Vienna was worried that something had happened to him, but when the broadcast finished at WOAK, Henry finally checked his six messages from Katie.  He dashed out as soon as he realized that Vienna was hurt.\n\n\nKim and Brad left the studio and visited Vienna.  They were both surprised to see Katie there, and Brad scolded her for not being at home in bed.  The doctor told Vienna that she could go home, but she had to rest her back for a while.  Brad insisted on taking Katie home, so Kim offered to take Vienna back to the Lakeview.  She also told Vienna that the show had worked out fine without her, thanks to Geneva Swift.\n\n\nHenry went back to the Lakeview, still in drag, and marched into his room to see Vienna lying on the bed and Kim hovering over her.  He had to pretend that he was Geneva Swift paying a visit to make sure that Miss Hyatt was all right.  Geneva made a hasty exit, but Kim ran after her in the hall to compliment her on her performance that day.  Kim invited her to be Vienna's replacement as co-host until Vienna's back had recovered.\n\n\nAt home, Brad complained about what a pain Geneva was, and to top it all off, the woman was ugly!  Katie took a call from Henry who told her that he was replacing Vienna on the show temporarily.  Katie told him that he was insane, but Henry assured her it would all work out.\n\n\n",
