She reasoned that the money could replenish Parker's trust fund, but Jack countered that taking money from Craig was sure to cause her grief later.\n\n\n       Carly sent Craig outside so she could talk to Jack alone. Jack said that the insurance company should have never paid the fire claim; however, Carly reasoned that they'd done it, and she needed the money for Parker's education. Jack claimed that she could rely on him, but she recalled that he'd walked out on her. He replied that she could count on him financially, but she figured that cash in the bank was better than good intentions. Figuring that he couldn't change her mind, Jack left.\n\n\n       At Java later, Carly showed Parker the check for her portion of the insurance claim. Parker was ecstatic that they'd recovered part of his trust fund. Carly offered to invest it for him instead of returning it to a trust. He asked what Jack thought, and his eyes bulged when she said that Jack had rejected the check. Carly left the decision to Parker, and he gave his mom permission to invest the money. She said that his support meant a lot to her, especially that day.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Lucinda still wanted to put Molly in jail, but Lily refused to win Holden by default. Lucinda asked if letting Holden walk away from the family would be any easier to live with. Lily said that she loved Holden too much to hurt him by going after Molly. Having made her decision, Lily insisted that the conversation was over.\n\n\n       Lucinda accepted Lily's choice, but hoped that her daughter wouldn't turn to pills again. Deciding that Lily needed a challenge, Lucinda invited her to return to Worldwide. Lily, however, enjoyed being a fulltime mother, and she'd rather arrange play dates than engage in a daily battle with her relentless mother. Lucinda left, urging Lily to think on it.\n\n\n       Later, Craig arrived with flowers to thank Lily for all her help. He informed her that, because of the insurance settlement, he was \"in the money again,\" and he wished to start that perfume company he'd been talking about. He wanted Lily to run it with Carly, but Carly couldn't know that he was financing it. Lily was wary about lying to Carly, but Craig used the Gabriel secret to guilt her into it.\n\n\n       Later, Lily pitched the perfume company idea to Carly, who enthusiastically stated that she'd been looking for somewhere to invest some money. Lily offered to pay the expenditures because she needed the tax write-off. They discussed whether they could work together and decided that they needed a project to distract them from their personal lives.\n\n\nAt the farm, Dusty questioned Janet's reasons for moving there. Janet claimed that he'd hurt her deeply by making her think that her father had made peace with her and had been setting aside money for her and Liberty. Dusty realized what he'd done; however, he didn't understand why Janet had moved in with Jack. She insisted that she needed to be at the farm and make it on her own, but he said that they could have it all, if she weren't so afraid.\n\n\n       Later, Jack arrived to find Janet without a Lamaze partner, since she'd left Dusty. Jack offered to fill in, and he persisted until she agreed. At the hospital later, they discussed labor, and Jack stopped himself when he started to recall Sage's birth. He asked Janet not to have the baby at a cabin in the middle of nowhere, and she quipped that Dusty had said the same thing. They joked that they had some baggage, but they'd do an amazing job with their son's labor.\n\n\n       During the class, the other participants assumed that Janet and Jack were a happily married couple. After class, Jack said he was sorry for their classmates' awkward assumptions. Janet, who'd thought it would be strange to attend the class together, said that being with him had been the most natural thing in the world.\n\n\n       Dusty encountered Craig and Johnny at the Lakeview, and Craig said that he wanted to invest in Worldwide's distribution network. Dusty wasn't interested in assisting Craig, but Craig mentioned his ability to increase or restrict Dusty's access to Johnny. Dusty replied that the threat proved what a lousy father Craig was, but the company's board would never even consider it. Craig thought that Dusty could convince them, if it meant spending more time with Johnny. Dusty got up from the table, and Craig shouted that he'd just go around Dusty. \"You can try!\" Dusty yelled back as he left.\n\n\n       Dusty went to Worldwide to tell Lucinda about the conversation with Craig. She warned Dusty not to take Craig's threats about Johnny lightly. Dusty considered that the only alternative was to sell Craig an entire division of Worldwide. \"No...Pretend to,\" Lucinda mischievously replied. She advised Dusty to give Craig a price just beyond Craig's reach. That way, it would look as if Dusty had complied, but Craig just couldn't afford it.\n\n\n       Dusty called Craig to his office to say that Craig's money was as good as anyone's. An appreciative Craig replied that Dusty could see plenty of Johnny-within reason. Handing Craig a slip of paper, Dusty said it was the figure that he'd calculated for Craig to buy into the Worldwide division. \"The number is outrageous,\" Craig complained.\n\n\n       Craig ordered Dusty to lower the price or lose visitation. Dusty said there was nothing he could do, and Johnny would figure out why Dusty wasn't around anymore. Dusty thought it was time that Johnny saw the real Craig. Craig vowed that it wasn't over, and Dusty grinned.\n\n\n       In the holding cells, Barbara gloated about Emily's imprisonment, and she happily conveyed that, as they spoke, Paul was moving Meg into Fairwinds. Emily wouldn't believe that Paul would put Meg into the middle of their marriage again, but Barbara countered that Emily no longer had a marriage. Emily warned that Barbara wouldn't have a relationship with Paul once he realized that Barbara had tried to turn him against his wife. An officer released Emily on bail, and Barbara pursued her out of the police station.\n\n\n       Paul checked Meg out from the hospital and told her that she'd live with him at Fairwinds. Meg worried about Emily, but he promised that she wouldn't hurt Meg again. When they arrived at Fairwinds, Meg put on a meek and grateful routine for Paul, but shrieked when Emily trekked in with Barbara on her heels. Barbara comforted Meg while Emily and Paul argued about Emily's innocence. Paul insisted that he needed to protect Meg and Eliza from Emily, who implored him not to destroy their marriage over something she didn't do.\n\n\n       The nanny carried Eliza in, and Paul stopped Emily from going toward the baby. He handed the child to Meg instead and asked Barbara to stay at the Lakeview that night. He advised his wife and mother to leave, and Emily surprisingly relented in going.\n\n\n       Later, Paul was in the study when Meg returned in a flowing nightgown and robe. Seeing his bashful grin, she claimed that it was all she had to wear. She cooed that Eliza had been the perfect medicine for her, and being there felt like old times. Sitting near enough to kiss him, Meg uttered that she wished she could show him what it meant to her to have his trust and confidence.\n\n\n       Paul pulled back and said it wasn't a good idea, since she'd just gotten released. He received a call and told Meg that he had to take off for Chicago to handle a deal. He promised to return the next day; however, he thought that she should have Barbara or Emma around to ease her anxiety about Emily. Meg assured him that she'd be fine, and as Paul retrieved items from the wall safe, she spotted a gun inside it. Paul left, and Meg stared manically at the wall safe.\n\n\n       On the phone at the Lakeview, Emily thanked Susan for posting bail. She ended the call when Barbara approached to resume their argument. Paul interrupted to tell Barbara that he needed to go to Chicago. Barbara offered to stay with Meg at Fairwinds, but Paul said Meg would be fine on her own. Emily grew outraged, and Paul threatened to have her arrested again if she set foot in his house. \"How can you talk to me like that?\" Emily asked. Ignoring the question, Paul asked Barbara to keep an eye on Emily.\n\n\nWhile Barbara coerced Emily to go upstairs and spend the night in Barbara's suite, Meg sat at Fairwinds and was on the phone with Paul. He notified her that Barbara was watching Emily. Once the call ended, she stuffed a family photo of Emily, Paul, and Eliza into a drawer and said, \"Bye-bye, Emily. You're so out of the picture.\" Just then, Emily appeared behind Meg.\n\n\nThe startled Meg jumped, and Emily grinned. Emily claimed that Barbara had gotten \"all tied up,\" so it was just Emily and Meg. Meg grabbed the phone to call the police, but Emily yanked it from her. She said that no one was leaving until she got the truth out of Meg.\n\n\nAs Emily started her interrogation, Meg whipped out a bottle and scoffed down some pills. Emily jumped on Meg to wrestle her for the bottle, but sprang back when Meg swung around with the gun. Meg said that she'd tell the police that Emily had drugged Meg's tea, and once Meg had figured it out, she'd had no choice but to defend herself. \"So I did the only thing I could do,\" Meg said, pointing the gun at Emily.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, a gagged and bound Barbara struggled against her restraints. \n\n\n\n\n",
