Jack said that just because Craig was going to marry Carly didn't mean he had to lie to enable her drinking. Craig said that he didn't need any life lessons from Jack, and said that Jack had no right to make baseless accusations against Carly. Jack said that as long as his kids were living under the same roof as Carly, he had the right to be concerned about her actions.\n\n\nCarly and Craig tried to convince Jack that Parker's statement that he'd seen his mom drinking was simply an act of rebellion against the idea of Carly and Craig getting engaged to be married. Jack didn't think that was the case. Carly told Jack that she wasn't drinking and that there was no alcohol in the house; she told him that if he didn't believe her, he could look for himself. Jack said he would do that, and he went into the kitchen and began looking through cabinets.\n\n\nCraig followed Jack into the kitchen and told Jack that if he wanted to act like a cop, he should get a search warrant, but it wasn't Jack's place to badger Carly. Jack stressed that the fact that his kids were living there meant that he had a right to be concerned and to keep an eye on things, but he turned and left the house. Carly thanked Craig for standing up for her. He responded by saying, \"I'll always have your back, Carly. I'll probably spend the rest of my life proving that.\" Carly said that Craig had proved it the minute he asked her to marry him, and she thought they should get married right away.\n\n\nCraig didn't think they should rush the wedding, and he reminded Carly that they had agreed on a long engagement to give all the kids time to get used to the idea. Carly became extremely defensive, saying that Craig was just using that as an excuse. She accused him of being like Jack and said he probably thought she was still drinking.\n\n\nCraig said he was nothing like Jack and that he did believe Carly when she said she had stopped drinking, but he thought that Carly shouldn't add a lot of stress to her life in addition to trying to give up a bad habit like drinking. Carly said that she thought that getting married was supposed to relieve her stress, not add to it, and she thought what Craig really meant was that he didn't trust her. She told him they should call off the whole thing, and she stormed out of the house.\n\n\nCraig followed Carly out and stopped her from leaving. He told her that if it meant that much to her, they could get married that day at the courthouse. Craig told Carly he didn't want to argue with her, but he would like to sit down and talk about it. He told Carly that if it made her happy to move up the wedding, then he would do it. Carly asked if he meant that, and he said yes.\n\n\nCraig asked if Carly wanted to get a calendar and pick a date, but Carly said they could do that later. Craig offered to find a wedding planner, to help take some of the pressure off of Carly, but Carly said that she could handle things by herself. Craig then asked Carly to reassure him that the wedding was still on, and she said it was. He kissed her and left. Carly made a beeline for the kitchen, dug out her bottle of vodka from behind the cereal box, and took a big swig.\n\n\nAt the diner, Parker told Janet that he was worried about his mom. Rosanna walked in and saw how sad Parker looked. She asked if he was okay, and Parker said nothing in reply, but walked up to her and hugged her. They sat down to talk, but when Rosanna asked Parker what was wrong, he didn't tell her the truth; instead, he said he didn't like his job. Rosanna asked how Parker felt about his mom marrying Craig, and Parker said he didn't know, but he figured Rosanna couldn't be too thrilled with the idea because of the things Craig had done to her in the past. Rosanna said it wasn't up to her whether Carly married Craig.\n\n\nRosanna then excused herself, explaining that she had a job interview for a managerial position at the Wagon Wheel Motel. Parker was surprised, and Rosanna admitted the place was a dump, but she said she had to take what she could get. They agreed to stay in closer touch, and Rosanna left. Janet walked up and asked Parker how things had gone with Rosanna, and Parker said he thought he had made a big mistake by not telling Rosanna what was going on with Carly. Parker thought that perhaps Rosanna could help Carly stop drinking, but Janet said the only person who could help Carly was Carly herself.\n\n\nJack arrived and told Parker that Carly had denied everything and that Craig had backed her up. Parker said that he was telling the truth, and Jack assured him that he believed him. Parker asked if Carly had said he was lying, and Jack said Carly and Craig had suggested that Parker had made up the accusation because he didn't want them to get married. Jack thought that Craig was covering for Carly, but Janet pointed out that it was possible that Craig didn't know that Carly was drinking again.\n\n\nJanet told Jack the same thing she had told Parker, that the only person who could make Carly stop drinking was Carly. Parker told his dad that he was still very worried about his mom, particularly about whether she might once again drink and drive. Jack asked what Parker wanted to do, but Parker wasn't sure.\n\n\nJack told Parker that if he wasn't comfortable staying with Carly, he could always move out to the farm for a while. Parker said he couldn't leave Sage, but Jack said that, of course, Sage would also move to the farm. Jack suggested that Parker talk to Sage about it and get back to him. Parker left to ride home on his bike, and Janet told Jack that she thought he was making a big mistake.\n\n\nJanet pointed out that Liberty might have a big problem having Parker living in the same house, and she wished that Jack had checked with her before telling Parker he could move in with them. Jack saw her point, but he said he was worried about his kids. Janet said that Craig and Carly would be getting married soon, and then Craig would be moving in with Carly. Janet suggested that maybe someone other than Jack could be good for Carly, and maybe Craig was that person.\n\n\nCraig went to the Lakeview to meet with Rosanna. He explained that Carly wanted to move up the date of the wedding. Craig told Rosanna that Carly could really use Rosanna's help and support, both with bringing the kids on board with the idea and in dealing with Jack. Rosanna asked what Craig expected her to do, and Craig suggested that she move in with Carly and the kids. Rosanna was stunned, but Craig said, \"Your sister needs you.\"\n\n\nCraig pointed out that Rosanna couldn't afford to live at the Lakeview indefinitely. She retorted that, thanks to him, she didn't have any money anymore. Craig said it would benefit both Rosanna and Carly if Rosanna would move in with Carly and the kids. Rosanna wondered what Craig wasn't telling her, but he said it was simply a matter of offering support to Carly. Rosanna said she would certainly be willing to do that after talking to Carly first to be sure it was what Carly wanted.\n\n\nCraig ran into Parker in Old Town and told him that he had convinced Rosanna to move in with Carly for a while. Parker wondered how Craig had managed that, but Craig said that Rosanna was family, so she'd been willing to help. Parker asked if that meant that Craig believed him when he had said that he had seen Carly drinking. Craig said whatever had happened was in the past, and he thought having Rosanna in the house would be a good source of support for Carly. Craig asked Parker if he wanted a ride home, and Parker said he did.\n\n\nJanet told Jack that if his kids were in any real danger, they could certainly move in with her and Jack, but she didn't think they were at that point yet. As Jack wondered what they should do, Craig entered the diner. He told Jack and Janet that he and Carly had decided to move up the wedding and that in the meantime, Rosanna was going to move in with Carly and the kids. Jack asked whose idea that had been, and Craig said it was his idea. He thought it would help keep Carly centered and would help her fight any temptation she might have to drink. Craig said that he had told Parker about it, and he thought Parker felt a little better about things. Janet thanked Craig for letting them know, and he left.\n\n\nRosanna went to see Carly. She told Carly that she had moved out of Fairwinds and into the Lakeview. Carly said that was good, because she thought things had seemed tense at Fairwinds with Paul, but she wondered how Rosanna could afford the Lakeview. Rosanna said she couldn't, really. She then mentioned that she was going to get a job at the Wagon Wheel, but it wouldn't pay much, so she wondered if she could move in with Carly, since Carly had made that offer previously.\n\n\nCarly hesitated long enough for Rosanna to notice, then Carly replied, \"Of course!\" Rosanna asked whether Carly was sure, and Carly said she was, but she thought Rosanna should know that she and Craig had moved up their wedding. Rosanna said she was aware of that, because Craig had told her. Carly asked when Rosanna had seen Craig, and Rosanna replied that she had just run into him at the Lakeview.\n\n\nRosanna asked if she could move in that evening, so she wouldn't have to spend another night at the Lakeview. Carly said of course. Parker and Craig arrived, and Carly told Craig that she hadn't been expecting to see him. Craig handed her a bouquet of flowers and said Carly probably hadn't been expecting the flowers, either, but they were there anyway. Carly took them and thanked him. Parker said that he had heard that Rosanna was moving in, and he thought it was great. He offered to drive Rosanna to the Lakeview to get her things, and she accepted.\n\n\nThey left, and Carly asked Craig if he had arranged to have Rosanna move in. Craig admitted that he had, and Carly asked why he had done that. Craig said he thought that Carly had wanted Rosanna to stay with her, but Rosanna hadn't wanted to originally because Carly was involved with Craig. Craig said he had taken care of that and had gotten Rosanna to agree, and he thought Carly would be happy about it. Carly said that she was, but she wondered why Craig had decided to suddenly fix that problem.\n\n\nCraig said that he just wanted Carly to be happy, and he thought Rosanna could help Carly with the wedding plans. Carly said that she was sure Rosanna would be a big help, but she wanted to get started designing her wedding dress, so she needed Craig to leave. Craig kissed her and left, and Carly once again went straight to the kitchen to drink some more vodka.\n\n\nRiley went to Java and heard Noah and Luke talking about Noah's proposed visit to Fort Leonard Wood. Luke wanted to accompany Noah, and Noah asked Riley to explain to Luke that the military had its own rules and that Luke would not be allowed on the base unless he had received clearance. Riley said he didn't think it was a good idea for them to film on the base, but Luke said they were going to do it anyway. Riley then told them he would try to talk to Lieutenant Hasbro about the whole thing.\n\n\nRiley went to the base and told Colonel Mayer what Luke and Noah wanted. Mayer told him that was unacceptable, and he said if Riley didn't find a way to get Noah to the base alone, he would call Margo and tell her who Riley really was. Riley called Noah and told him that he had found a way to get Luke on the base, but first, Noah would have to speak to Lieutenant Hasbro alone concerning the purpose of the movie Noah was making. Noah thanked Riley and hung up, then gave Luke the good news. Luke wondered why he couldn't be present while Noah gave Hasbro the background information, and he told Noah he was starting to get a bad feeling about everything.\n\n\nMargo picked up a call at home from the Veterans Administration and took a message for Casey. When Casey entered the room, Margo told him that someone from the Veterans Administration had said that they did not have any information for him. Casey admitted that he was trying to get more information about Riley. Margo was upset and told Casey to stop looking for something to use against Riley.\n\n\nCasey wanted to know why his mom was so willing to believe everything Riley had told her, and he pointed out that all Margo knew about Riley was what she had learned from Riley directly, which meant there could be many things that Riley did not want her to know. Margo said she didn't think so, and she wasn't interested in trying to find out. She asked Casey to stop digging into Riley's background.\n\n\nMargo left for work, and Casey picked up the mail, which included a letter from the Veterans Administration. He opened it, read it, and quickly left the house. Casey found Luke and Noah at Holden and Lily's home, and he showed them the letter he had just received. It stated that the service member Casey had inquired about, Sergeant Riley Morgan, had died in Afghanistan. A photo of the sergeant had been included with the letter, and they all looked at it and could see that it wasn't the Riley they knew. Luke asked who the person was who was staying at Casey's house and pretending to be Riley, and Casey said he was going to find out.\n\n\nRiley arrived, and as he was about to knock on the door, he overheard what Casey, Noah, and Luke were discussing. He stopped and listened as Noah wondered who Riley could be and why he would be pretending to be someone else. They all agreed that Noah shouldn't go to the base or anywhere else with Riley. Casey said that he was going to take the letter to his mom at the police station, but he wanted Luke and Noah to go with him for support. They agreed, and Riley left quickly, before they could leave the house.\n\n\nCasey, Luke, and Noah arrived at the police station, and they went with Margo into an interrogation room, where Casey showed her the letter about Riley. Margo read the letter and looked at the picture. She asked Casey who else knew about it, but Casey said they were the only ones he had told. Margo told the boys to stay put, saying she would handle it.\n\n\nColonel Mayer grew impatient when he couldn't reach Riley by phone. He picked up a gun and left the base. At the Hughes's house, Riley packed his things to leave. As he opened the door, the colonel met him, pointed a gun at him, and told him he wasn't going anywhere. Riley told Mayer that Noah knew that he wasn't Riley Morgan, so he would be unable to get Noah to meet with Mayer. Mayer said that meant that Riley was no good to him, and he raised his gun.\n\n\nMargo arrived and drew her own gun, shouting, \"Drop your weapon!\" When Mayer turned around and Margo saw who it was, she was stunned. Mayer used that opportunity to turn to Riley and distract Margo; Mayer pointed his gun under his arm and fired at Margo without even looking at her. Riley wrestled with Mayer and managed to shoot Mayer with his own gun. Riley then rushed to Margo and cradled her in his arms. Mayer got up, bleeding from his wound, and staggered out of the house. Riley held Margo and pleaded, \"Please don't die, Mom!\"\n\n\n",
