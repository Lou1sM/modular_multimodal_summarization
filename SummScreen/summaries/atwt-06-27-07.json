He leaves and Lucinda returns and tells her Holden wants to come and take her home, but she insists that she must stay and look for Paul and that no one tells Barbara about the accident until they find Paul.  Lucinda tells Meg to rest while the experts search and thanks her for getting her company back.  Meg lashes out at Lucinda for only being worried about the company and not showing concern for Paul.
