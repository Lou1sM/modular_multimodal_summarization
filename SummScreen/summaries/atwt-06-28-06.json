    "tvmega_recap": "Holden, with Jack's help, is determined to find out Damian's connection to Ross' foundation. Damian continues to manipulate Luke by trying to casually suggest he stay away from Lily for her best interests. Ross upsets Damian when he calls demanding a meeting because he is worried about the police calling to question him; the foundation should not be aligned with a case involving a hurt pregnant woman in a coma. Damian is angry that Luke is even more confused now. Emma tells Holden that Luke is staying longer with Damian, and he decides to go get his son back. Luke ends up at the hospital and Emma asks him to stay with Lily under the pretense she has something to take care of. Alone with Lily, Luke pleads with her to wake up; he needs and loves her, and will make up for the hurt he caused. Casey and Maddie arrange to find a motel to stay the night in. Maddie wrestles with her feelings. Casey bumps into Margo who has come home early and will be entertaining Dallas and Jess. Casey comes up with an excuse as to why he has an overnight bag. Maddie shows up to meet Casey and is upset to find Dallas there. Dallas doesn't want her scared of him. Not long after, without a word Maddie bolts, much to the confusion of Casey and Margo. Emily continues to subtly work Jen so she doesn't forget Johnny is home because of her. Although Emily cares for Jen and feels a bond now between their kids and Jen, she also thinks this is her last hope to keep Paul and Meg from raising her unborn child. Jen's health seems to deteriorate even though she works hard to hide it. Dusty and Jen argue about him placating her by telling her falsely he would think about his feelings toward Emily. Paul and Meg find out Jen was released against medical advice. Meg reads Jen's updated tests results and realizes she is getting much more sick, so they rush over to see her. While attending to Johnny, Jen's health becomes precarious. Paul and Meg inform Dusty about what they have learned. Dusty finally relents and goes to check on Jen only to find her unconscious on the floor. They are unsuccessful in rousing her so Meg calls 911, but Dusty is so concerned he doesn't want to wait for the ambulance, as he scoops Jen up in his arms and starts to carry her out the door.",
