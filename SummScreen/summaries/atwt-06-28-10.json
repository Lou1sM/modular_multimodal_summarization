She picked up the check and offered to pay, but Chris said that paying for his food did not make up for his falsifying Vienna's medical records as a favor to Katie.  Katie apologized, but Chris said the decision to break the rules had been his, and Katie did not owe him anything.  He stood up to go, so Katie invited him to her place for peach pie and ice cream.  \"I'll pass,\" said Chris coldly.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Casey saw Alison, who remarked that things were getting even weirder with the \"Vienna thing.\"  She said that according to Vienna's file, she had been pregnant for a little over a month.  Casey and Alison both knew that there was no way they could have missed that notation in the records earlier, and Alison was sure that someone had recently inserted that information.  She suggested that Casey ask Chris for help, since his uncle had more direct access to the records than they did.  That made Casey uncomfortable, but he realized that he was stuck, so he agreed to take Alison's advice.\n\n\nCasey found Chris in the doctor's lounge and asked to speak with him.  Then he blurted out that he might have gotten someone pregnant, but the woman involved denied that was true.  Casey said he didn't believe her and needed to find out if he was going to be a father soon.  He asked about a paternity test, and Chris explained that they could run such a test on a baby in utero but certainly not without the mother's consent.  He said he needed the girl's name, and it was clear that he was hoping it was not Alison.  Casey said it was Vienna Hyatt, and he added that someone had tampered with Vienna's medical records.  Chris was stunned, and he gave Casey a lame excuse and ran out.\n\n\nVienna and Henry finished an early dinner and went up to their room at the Lakeview.  As they passed Barbara's room, Vienna said that she wanted a very large kitchen in the house that Henry was going to buy for them when their baby arrived.  Henry was standing near the door to Barbara's room, and he heard bumps and muffled moaning from inside.  Vienna hurried Henry away, and referred to the fact that there, indeed, was someone for everyone.  They went into their own room and sat on the bed while Vienna looked at pictures of bassinets.  Henry was too distracted to participate, and he said that he was worried about the sounds he had heard emanating from Barbara's room.\n\n\nVienna asked why Henry even cared what was going on in there, and she offered that it had sounded to her as if Barbara was having sex on the floor, and she marveled that a woman Barbara's age could pull that off.  \"Once a tramp, always a tramp,\" she declared.  Someone knocked on the door, and it was Katie, who said to Henry that she had \"baby stuff\" to discuss with Vienna.  Henry excused himself and said he would be in the bar.\n\n\nKatie told Vienna that her medical records said that she had been pregnant for over a month.  Vienna was elated, but she was not so pleased when she learned that Katie had to involve Chris in their scheme.  Katie was very concerned that helping Vienna had been \"a horrible mistake.\"  Vienna asked her friend to consider what she had done as saving two souls, hers and Henry's.  Katie, however, regretted asking Chris to go against his principles.  Katie declared Vienna \"officially pregnant,\" and she left for home.  Vienna went into the bathroom and took another pregnancy test, but it, too, was negative.\n\n\nAlison was Vienna' s next visitor, and she claimed that she needed to \"update\" some of the woman's records.  Vienna was a bit surprised that Alison was making a home visit, but Alison took out a notebook and pen and asked Vienna when her due date was.  Vienna couldn't remember, and she also refused to give the name of her doctor.  She tried to get Alison to leave, so Alison finally said that she knew Vienna had slept with Casey.  Vienna called that a \"horrible lie,\" but then she admitted it with a \"so what?\"  Alison explained how worried Casey was about being the baby's father, so Vienna assured Alison that he was not, and she swore it on \"Heaven and Earth.\"  Alison said she would tell Casey that Henry was the father, and she gave Vienna her congratulations as she left.\n\n\nBarbara continued her groaning and bumping along the floor as she tried to get herself untied.  Henry began to worry, so he got a passing housekeeper to open the door for him.  Inside, he found a trussed-up Barbara gyrating on the floor.  He removed her gag and then began working on the drapery ties that Emily had used to restrain Barbara.  Barbara was hysterical and shouted out that Emily was out to get Meg once and for all.\n\n\nAt home, Katie looked at photos of Brad and muttered that no one could ever replace him.  Chris knocked and ran in, asking why Katie had not told him that Casey was sleeping with Vienna.  Vienna also walked in behind Chris, and she thanked him for his help.  Chris was angry that he had ever gotten involved with the scheme, and he blamed himself.  He stomped out, as Vienna wailed that her entire future depended upon one little baby she was yet to conceive.\n\n\nKatie went to Memorial and found Chris in the doctor's lounge, but they really had nothing to say to one another.  Katie tried to explain that Vienna was desperate to be married to Henry and was terrified of losing him.  Chris said he was in a position of having to keep the truth from his nephew, not to mention that he had jeopardized his job and his medical license.  Katie finally said that she could assure Chris that she was 100% sure that the baby was not Casey's, and she grudgingly admitted that there was no baby.  Chris called the whole thing \"one big vicious lie,\" and he said he would tell Henry the truth.  Katie argued, so Chris challenged her to try to stop him, and she planted a big kiss on his lips.\n\n\nWhen they were able to talk, Chris said that was good, but not good enough.  Katie said she could do even better.  She offered to go away to a hotel with Chris if he would let Vienna's medical records stand. \"Hmmmm,\" Chris mused, \"sex for secrecy.\"  Katie also said she was willing to go with him right away.\n\n\nAlison gave Casey the good news that he was not the father of Vienna's baby, but he was reluctant to just take the woman's word for it.  He was not yet able to let it go because something was not right.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg held Emily at gunpoint with Paul's revolver while she drank several cups of tea laced with methadone she had put there herself.  She told Emily that after she shot her, the police would think Emily had poisoned Meg again.  \"Pretty soon, \"said Meg, \"I'm going to be buzzed, but you'll be dead.\"  Emily mentioned that Eliza was asleep upstairs, but that did not concern Meg.  They shouted at one another as Meg began to get more irrational.  Emily begged her to put down the gun, but Meg said it wasn't time yet because she had to be \"loaded\" with methadone in order to convince the cops.  Emily claimed that her mother, Susan, had hired a private investigator to find out who had stolen the drugs from Memorial, and that disturbed Meg even more.\n\n\nMeg yelled at Emily that she was lying, as Meg appeared more confused.  Finally a desperate Emily jumped her, and the two struggled.  Meg was able to shove Emily away, and then she raised the gun and said, \"Go to hell, \"and she pulled the trigger.  Just then, Paul, Emma, and an attendant ran in, and Paul went to Emily, while Emma ran to her daughter.  Emma asked for the gun, and she was eventually able to persuade Meg to relinquish it.  Meg was amazed that Emily was not dead, and Emily was dumbfounded, as well.  Paul explained that he had replaced the bullets with blanks so that no one would get hurt.\n\n\nMeg tried to say that Emily had drugged her again, but Emily set the record straight.  She was very surprised when Paul believed her, however, until he told her that he knew that his wife was innocent all along.  Meg appealed to Paul for help, as Emma got her to sit down on the couch.  Then Barbara and Henry arrived, and Barbara was sure that Emily had tried to kill Meg again.  Paul asked Henry to take his mother back to the Lakeview, and then he explained that Meg had been administering the methadone to herself.  Emily questioned Paul about knowing all along what Meg was doing, as he returned the gun to the safe.  Then he admitted that he had known Meg was drugging herself, but he could not take the chance of Barbara's tipping his hand.\n\n\nHenry managed to get an angry Barbara away, as Emma and Paul watched a very calm Meg hug a throw pillow.  They helped her to stand, but Meg fussed about where they were going.  Emma promised her daughter that it would be safe and quiet in the hospital, and the two of them, plus the attendant, walked her out.  When Paul returned, he apologized to Emily who still did not know how to respond to her husband.  \n\n\nPaul fixed himself a drink, and told Emily that he knew the exact moment when it had all clicked in his brain.  It was when Paul had asked Emily straight out if she was drugging Meg's tea, and Emily had sworn on their marriage that she would never harm Meg.  Paul said he had to figure out a way to set up Meg.  He reminded Emily that he had bailed her out of jail and set up the whole scene.  He and Emma were hiding in the hall and saw Meg take the gun from the safe and put the drugs in her tea.  Emily then smacked Paul right across his face and said she understood.\n\n\nHenry took Barbara back to her hotel room, as she complained how her own son had treated her.  She was still angry at how Emily had tied her up, and she called her daughter-in-law \"a menace.\"  Barbara said the whole thing probably would not have happened if she had not been staying at Fairwinds in \"Paul's little house of horrors.\"  Henry offered to share the blame because Barbara had moved out in order to escape memories of him, but then he asked her to move back to the Lakeview permanently.  He promised it would be different because all he could think of was kissing her, and he did just that.  When Henry finally tore himself away, both he and Barbara were in terrible pain from their breaking hearts.  Outside Barbara's room, Vienna hid in the shadows and watched Henry leave. \n\n\n",

Meg is taken to the hospital where she becomes emotional about being without Paul and Eliza, as Emma just wants her to get healthy.
