Luke and Noah tried to reassure him that Riley was not a violent person and that he would not hurt Margo when she confronted him with the information that Casey had given her.  They discussed the fact that Riley Morgan was not who he said he was, and Noah figured out that the permission Riley had gotten for him to film at Fort Leonard Wood was probably bogus, too.  Casey accused Riley of conning everyone.\n\n\nDamian called Luke and asked him to sign some foundation papers that he needed to send to Malta.  Luke told his father that he was in the middle of something, but Damian said that time was of the essence.  Luke agreed to meet him at the Worldwide offices right away, and Noah decided to try to reclaim his shift at Java, since he needed the money.  Casey couldn't stand waiting for Margo alone, so he left to go home.\n\n\nAt the Hughes home, Riley cradled Margo in his arms and called her \"Mom.\"  She opened her eyes, and Riley switched to calling her \"Margo.\"  He explained that Colonel Winston Mayer had shot her, and then he thanked her for saving his life.  Unfortunately, the colonel had escaped, but he had suffered a gunshot to his abdomen.  Riley called 9-1-1 and helped Margo deal with the wound and the shock.   She wanted to know what Colonel Mayer had wanted in her house, and just then, Casey ran up.  He immediately wanted to know what Riley had done to his mother.\n\n\nAfter Riley explained that Colonel Mayer had shot Margo, Casey accused RIley of using a dead man's name to con his family.  Margo stopped their bickering by telling Casey that Riley was his brother, Adam.  Casey did not believe her, but Riley agreed that he was Adam.  The EMTs arrived and began working on Margo. The police came to interview Riley, who told them that the colonel had shot Margo.  The EMTs loaded her into an ambulance, and Casey swore at Riley and left to call his dad.\n\n\nAt Java, Colonel Mayer grabbed Noah just as the boy was going in.  Noah was stunned to see his father alive, and he was full of questions.  Colonel Mayer told his son that he had no choice but to put Noah through believing that he was dead.  Noah asked the colonel why he had returned, and Mayer said that it was for Noah's sake.  The only important thing, he stressed, was that they were together.  Noah noticed the colonel's wound, and Mayer admitted that he had been shot.  He asked Noah to take him somewhere where it would be quiet and safe for them to talk.\n\n\nNoah wanted to take his father to a doctor first, but the colonel refused.  Noah hustled his father away, and Colonel Mayer led him to the office he had been using on an abandoned military base in the area.    Noah shouted at this father that he wished that he had never returned.  Mayer admitted that he had stolen the disc of Noah's film project so that he could know what his son was doing.  He asked for a chance to rectify the last impression that Noah had of him diving overboard to escape capture by the authorities.\n\n\nThe colonel said that ultimately he wanted Noah to flee with him, and he professed great love for his son.  Noah said that his dad needed professional medical help and then psychological aid.  He needed to pay for killing Noah's mother, and the best thing to do would be to turn himself in.  Colonel Mayer refused and asked for a fresh start with his son.  He wanted to be assured that Noah did not hate him, and when Noah said he didn't, the colonel asked for help in escaping.\n\n\nAt Worldwide, Luke explained all about Riley Morgan to Damian.  He was especially sorry that Riley had also conned Noah about shooting film at the Army base.  Luke signed the papers for Damian, and he left to meet Noah at Java.  Noah was not there, however, but Luke spotted Noah's backpack, which had been stashed behind a bench.  Luke picked it up and took it back to Worldwide and told Damian that something bad had happened to Noah.  Luke called Casey to find out if he had seen Noah, and learned that Colonel Mayer was in town and had shot Margo.\n\n\nDamian assured Luke that they would find Noah, and he offered to make a few calls.  He cautioned Luke that Colonel Mayer was a clever enemy, and they had to be equally so.  Damian wanted to know everything that Luke knew about the colonel.  Luke said that Mayer was a murderer and that Noah was in deep trouble if his father had him.  Damian asked if Noah might have gone to the army base to ask permission to film there, so Luke mentioned their previous contact with Lieutenant Hasbro.\n\n\nDamian asked if it was possible that Hasbro was in league with Colonel Mayer, and Luke thought it could be true.  Damian called Hasbro and inquired about Colonel Mayer.  He pretended that Mayer was going to leave the country on one of the Grimaldi ships and that he needed the correct paperwork to show to the port authorities.  Hasbro agreed to meet Damian on the docks to give him the papers, and then he let slip that the paperwork was for two people, not just one.  Damian and Luke left immediately for the docks.\n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Casey and Riley comforted Margo until a nurse chased them out to prepare Margo for surgery to remove the bullet.  Tom walked up and asked Riley how Margo was, so Casey took his dad to see his mother.  Casey asked Margo if she was going to tell Tom what she had said to him about Riley, but Tom suggested that Margo rest and not talk.\n\n\nCasey spoke up and said he would tell his dad, but Margo intervened and said she would tell Tom herself.  Then she described to Tom how Riley had saved her life after Colonel Mayer had shot her.  The nurse reappeared and wheeled Margo out, and Casey stopped Riley and said they needed to talk.  The boys went to Java, and Casey made it clear that he was not prepared to believe anything that Riley had to say.  Then he asked Riley why, if he was Adam, he had returned the way he had.\n\n\nRiley explained that after he had left Oakdale in shame, he had held some menial jobs and finally was ready to face what he had done.  He joined a service organization and went to Afghanistan.  When a bomb destroyed a home he was rebuilding, it killed the real Riley Morgan and destroyed Adam's face.  He said that he realized at that moment that he had a new lease on life, and he switched identities with Riley.  The State Department unwittingly continued the mistaken identity of the two Americans and listed Adam Hughes as the dead one.  Adam had searched for Riley's family, but he found no one left.  He felt that he was as good as dead to his own family, so he decided to shut the door for them and give them closure.  Casey was disgusted and got up and walked out.\n\n\nDamian and Luke walked on the docks and discussed their plan.  Damian instructed his son to hide behind a container, as Damian waited at the meeting place.  Hasbro arrived and produced the paperwork.  A dockworker surprised Luke and flushed him out into the open by shouting at him.  Hasbro took off at a run, and Damian and Luke took up the chase.  They caught the lieutenant, and Damian told Luke to take hold of one of Hasbro's legs, and he took the other.  They dangled him head first over the water until Hasbro agreed to talk.\n\n\nWith Hasbro's directions, Luke and Damian found the abandoned military base, and they agreed to split up to search for the colonel and Noah.  Luke spotted them first, arguing, and he ran up and embraced Noah.  Luke began to call the police, but Noah begged him not to.  Noah said he did not think he could send his father away to life in prison.  Damian stumbled onto Colonel Mayer, while Luke and Noah argued.  Luke pointed out that if the colonel got away again, Noah would always have to be looking over his shoulder, and there was no telling how many other people Mayer would hurt.  Finally, Noah took out his phone and called the police.\n\n\nTom waited for Margo to awaken from her surgery.  He told her that she would make a full recovery.  Casey returned, and Tom went looking for Riley.  Margo ordered Casey not to tell Tom that Riley was Adam, because she did not want to have to arrest her own son.  Casey reminded her that she had arrested Casey fast enough when he had transgressed, and that he did not forgive as quickly as she did.  He did not think it was fair to lie to Tom, and he said he would not do it.\n\n\nTom found Riley in the hall and spoke with him.  He said that Margo had credited him with saving her life, and Tom owed the young man a debt he could not repay.  Tom hugged Riley and took him in to see Margo.  The two of them interrupted an obviously serious discussion between mother and son.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Riley is comforting an injured Margo calling her mom before she awakens. However, when a worried Casey shows up at his house after having told Luke and Noah about how Riley is a fraud, Margo shocks him when she tells Casey that Riley is actually Adam. Casey is stunned and believes that she doesn't know what she is talking about, but Riley confirms it. Margo is taken to the hospital where she needs to go into surgery to remove the bullet so Casey and Riley sit down to talk. Riley explains as best he can, how he came to be Riley Morgan. Casey doesn't believe him at first, but then he seems to believe him, but it doesn't help because he is so furious with Adam that no matter what Adam says, Casey is not going to listen or care. Later, when Margo comes through her surgery, Tom is waiting but Margo doesn't let him in on Riley's real identity. When Tom goes to thank Riley for saving Margo, Margo asks Casey to lie to Tom and everyone because if anyone knows the truth then Adam will have to go to jail. Casey doesn't understand why he had to go to jail, as Margo reminds him that Adam would go away for many years and she just got him back. Casey doesn't feel comfortable lying to his dad especially and doesn't think he can do it, much to Margo's chagrin. When Tom and Riley walk back into the room, Tom can see they were talking about something important and asks them what it was. Noah is headed back to work when Col Meyer grabs him and pleads with him to come with him so they can talk. Noah is unsure at first, but then finally agrees to it. When Luke goes to talk with Noah and finds out that he didn't show up at work and then finds his knapsack abandoned by a bench, he goes to Damian worried. Luke later finds out from Casey that Col. Meyer is alive and so he and Damian construct a plan involving Lt. Hasboro after they deduce he was involved. Col. Meyer tries to explain why he came back, and how he hopes to mend fences with Noah especially after hearing his words in his movie. Noah has mixed feelings because he is his father but he can't get past what he did and thinks that his dad needs professional help. Col. Meyer wants them to go away together, but Noah turns him down and tells him that he needs to pay for his crimes. Luke and Damian meet with Lt. Hasboro under false pretenses, but he figures out something is up and tries to run. Damian and Luke catch up to him and are able to \u0091force' the Lt. to tell them where Col. Meyer is staying and what he has planned. They show up just after Col. Meyer has convinced Noah to help him at least get away even if he won't go with him. Luke tries to get Noah to see that letting his father get away, will only make it worse for him. Noah fights it at first because he still can't get over that he would be turning his own father in, but he finally sees the light and comes to his senses and calls the police to turn in his fugitive father.",
