Chris decided, however, that he would accept Katie's offer to have sex with him in order to ensure his silence about Vienna's non-pregnancy.  He opened the door in the doctors' lounge in Memorial and invited Katie to lead the way.  They drove to Bay City and checked into a hotel right on the lake. In their room, Katie again asked Chris to please not tell Henry about Vienna's condition, and, in return, she promised to make things right with Casey.  Chris agreed, so Katie suggested they get something to eat, and then he clarified that it would be fine after -- and he pointed to the bed.  He looked at Katie and grinned, and then he said, \"Take off your clothes.\"\n\n\n Katie was very uncomfortable, as she slowly untied the bodice of her dress.  Chris offered to help, so he began to assist. He remarked that she was trembling, and Katie apologized for disappointing him.  Chris smiled and confessed that he had just wanted to see how far she would go to cover up Vienna's lie.  He said he didn't really want to sleep with her, anyway, and he suggested a paddleboat ride on the lake instead.  Katie wanted to know how the change in plans affected their \"deal,\" so Chris said that he would not tell Henry the truth, but that she had to.  They walked out of the room, but Chris looked back at the bed longingly.\n\n\nIn her suite at the Lakeview, Barbara went over and over her last kiss with Henry and then looked at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly her mirror image yelled at her, \"Hey! What's wrong with you?\" and began to berate Barbara for not going after the man she loved.  The image urged her to go out and get Henry back before he married Vienna.  Then Barbara's alter ego asked since when Barbara Ryan gave up without a fight.\n\n\nVienna stormed angrily into her room in the hotel and began knocking bridal books and magazines to the floor.  She bent to pick them up, and Henry walked in.  He had something to say, but Vienna stopped him and said she already knew what he wanted to say.  She suggested that they get married the very next day instead of waiting.  Henry was hesitant, but Vienna was a woman on a mission.  She also knew that Henry had wanted to bring up the subject of his feelings for Barbara, but Vienna refused to talk about Barbara again because Barbara had nothing to do with their wedding.  Henry disagreed, however, and stated that Barbara had everything to do with their wedding.\n\n\nHenry admitted that whatever he was feeling about Barbara was interfering with how he felt about Vienna.  Vienna said that Henry looked at Barbara as \"a way out,\" but she reminded him that she was the one having his child, and they owed it to the baby to stick together. She asked Henry if he could stand before a minister and say and mean those two little words, and Henry said, \"For this baby, I do.\"  They went down to the lounge, and Henry fortified himself with a martini while Vienna went to Lisa's office.  When she returned, she handed him one of their wedding invitations.  She explained that Lisa was printing them for her to save time, and he was holding the very first one.\n\n\nVienna said that she was hungry, but when she saw Chris and Katie walk in the lounge, she quickly said that she wanted to go to Metro to eat.  Chris made a beeline for them, however, with Katie in tow, and Chris pushed Katie forward and said that she had something to say to Henry.  Vienna jumped to Henry's side and declared that she and Henry were getting married the next day, and then she asked Henry to go back to Lisa's office and get two more invitations for Chris and Katie.  Henry left on his errand, but Vienna was not pleased when Chris said that Katie had to tell Henry the truth.\n\n\nVienna was terrified that if she did not marry Henry immediately, then she would lose him.  Henry returned with the invitations and doled them out.  Katie stumbled around trying to find the right words to tell Henry that his fianc\u00e9e had royally duped him, when Chris surprised her by saying that Katie only wanted the happy couple to set a date for the wedding, and that was already taken care of.  Katie excused herself quietly, and Chris followed her out.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Chris was back at work, but Katie surprised him in the doctors' lounge again.  She asked why he had not told Henry the truth when he had the perfect chance, and Chris asked, in turn, why she had agreed to keep the secret in the first place.  Katie began to cry, and she confessed that it was because she wanted Vienna and Henry to have their \"happily ever after.\"  Then she took offense at a remark that Chris made about her relationship with Brad, and she lashed out and began to cry again.  Chris suggested that she take her \"perfect\" marriage off its pedestal just a bit, so that she could start living again.  Katie asked why Chris had lied to Henry, and he said he had done it for her.  Then he kissed her.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Emma hugged Holden in the hall and told him that because of Paul's \"trap,\" they had discovered that Meg had been drugging herself with methadone and framing Emily for it.  Meg heard her brother's voice and called out to him from her room.  Holden and Emma ran in, and Meg was frantic and began shouting how everything was Emily's fault.  Meg asked Holden to call Paul and ask him to get there, as Holden realized just how disturbed his sister's mental state was.  Emma and Holden stepped outside as a nurse tried to calm the patient.  Meg continued to shout for them to call Paul, and Emma suggested that Holden do that.  Holden was very angry with Paul, but he did as his mother asked.\n\n\nPaul told Emily in the living room at Fairwinds that she should slap him again if it would make her feel any better.  Emily accused him of lying to her for weeks, but Paul said it was the only way he could prove that Meg was self-medicating.  Emily was furious that her own husband had let her go to jail, so Paul reiterated that he had to play his part in the drama convincingly.  He apologized for hurting her, but he claimed it was all part of \"the bigger picture,\" so that the pair of them could raise Eliza.  Emily was also irate that she had to suffer verbal abuse from Barbara, as well, and she stomped upstairs.\n\n\nIn their bedroom, Emily packed a bag and told Paul she was going to her mother's.  Paul begged her to stay, but Emily said that everything he had done had been for Meg, not her.  He argued that he had always been in control, but Emily began to cry.  Paul's phone rang, and it was Holden, who explained that he and Emma had \"a situation\" with Meg.  He asked Paul to join them, and Paul glanced at Emily and then agreed.  He begged Emily to stay, at least until he returned, but she refused to promise anything.\n\n\nBarbara walked in unannounced, and Emily assumed she was there to apologize to her for all the false accusations.  Barbara, however, set Emily straight by saying, \"Not in this lifetime.\"  Paul asked his mother not to kill his wife, and he asked Emily not to leave him -- ever, and he left for Memorial.\n\n\nBarbara and Emily both went downstairs, and Barbara discussed how Emily had \"brutalized\" her in her hotel suite.  They argued loudly, and when Emily reminded Barbara that Meg had tried to kill her, Barbara replied, \"Who could blame her?\"  She also announced that she was moving back to the Lakeview, and Emily accused her of chasing after a much younger man.  Emily urged her mother-in-law to give up Henry before she looked even \"more pathetic\" than ever.  They traded more insults, and Barbara said she knew she would never have a place in her son's life as long as Emily was in it.  She did ask for a framed photo of Paul and Eliza, however, and Emily agreed that Barbara could take it as long as she agreed to stay away from them.\n\n\nPaul arrived at the hospital, and Emma said that the staff had pumped Meg's stomach, so the methadone was out of her system.  Holden berated Paul for putting his sister's life at risk, but Emma said that Paul had to bring the situation to a head.  She did say, however, that she could never forgive him for what he had done to Meg year after year after year.  Meg heard Paul in the hall, and she called to him, as Holden warned him not to hurt Meg any more.  Paul went into Meg's room and consoled her by saying that he owed her.  Meg took that to mean that they could move on together, but Paul had to say that would not happen.  Meg was not sure she could go on without him, but Paul said he wasn't good for her.  He reminded her that she had to get well in order to be a part of Eliza's life.\n\n\nPaul kissed Meg and walked out in tears.  Emma said that the doctors had recommended that Meg go to a facility out of town, and then she broke down.  Paul held her, and Holden thanked Paul for figuring out a way to get the right help for his sister.  Paul looked at Meg once more through the window, and then he walked out.\n\n\nMeg got dressed, and Holden broke the news that she was going to a hospital near her sister, Iva, in Washington, D.C.  Meg asked Emma to go with her, and her mother promised to be with her every step of the way.  Meg cried for Eliza, but she realized that she had to leave home in order to get well and return.  Holden walked his mother and sister out.\n\n\nPaul went home and was delighted that Emily was still there.  They talked, and Paul begged her not to leave.  He said that he wanted to raise Eliza with her, and they looked down the hall, and the little girl was standing there.  Paul went to get her, and Emily began to laugh, accusing Paul of not playing fair.  She kissed him and mentioned a huge diamond in the jewelry store window that just might salve her wounds.\n\n\nBarbara walked through the Lakeview lounge, but Vienna waylaid her.  Vienna handed Barbara an invitation to the wedding and then nastily said she would give Barbara and Henry a moment alone.  Barbara read the invitation and was stunned that the wedding was so soon.  She told Henry that was not what he really wanted, but Henry said he had \"responsibilities.\"  Barbara urged him to change his mind because he deserved happiness, too.  Henry, however, was determined to put \"Baby Coleman\" ahead of his own wants and needs.  It was his last chance, he lamented, to be \"somebody's dad.\"  He said he was sorry, and he left the lounge.\n\n\nBarbara went to her suite and looked in her mirror again.  She asked for a \"rah-rah\" speech from her alter ego, but nothing happened.  Then, through her tears, she ripped the wedding invitation to shreds.\n\n\nHenry sat with Vienna on their bed, and he talked to the baby he thought was there.\n\n\n",
