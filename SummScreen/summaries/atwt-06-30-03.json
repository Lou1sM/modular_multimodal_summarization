As a result, all the girls (Carly, Rosanna, and Katie) agree to sleep indoors, while all the guys (Jack, Craig, Mike, and Parker) sleep on the porch.  As they discuss sleeping arrangements indoors, Molly arrives on the porch to see Katie getting ready to share a sleeping bag with Mike.  Molly puts on a cheerful front to cover her dismay.  Carly and Molly embrace, thrilled to be reunited, and Molly falls instantly in love with baby Sage. The girls eat chocolates and tell stories, discovering that none of them had a full honeymoon.   The girls drink a toast to the men they love, then, as they get ready to go to sleep, Carly tells Molly that she has never had so many things go right:  Sage's birth, then reconciling with Jack, Rosanna, and Molly.  On the porch, Mike invites Parker to share his sleeping bag, leaving Craig and Jack to sleep together.  As they settle down for the night, Craig murmurs, \"Jack...love ya.\"  The entire porch erupts in giggles, then the men change places.  Jack, resettled by Mike, calls, \"Craig, I miss you.\"  More laughter.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the  doctors are reviving Rick, whose heart had stopped.  Susan leaves Rick to overhear Alison  tell Emily of her distrust of Rick, and Susan angrily informs her daughters that Rick is in the intensive care unit.  Emily and Susan go to Rick's bedside.  Dr. Walker Daniels enters the room and appears suspicious that Rick has had a smaller injection of potassium chloride than the other victims, so that he did not have as serious an attack. Susan demands that Dr. Daniels apologize  for his suspicions of Rick, and he halfheartedly says that he is sorry.  After Alison tells Chris about Rick's collapse, Chris finds Gordo and accuses Gordo of trying to kill Dr. Decker.  Gordo responds by accusing Chris.  Hal takes both interns aside to question them, and he also questions Alison, who tells Hal that she saw neither Chris nor Gordo at the time of the attack.  When Hal confronts Chris and Gordo, he finds that they have no alibis, so Hal asks Dr. John Dixon to have both interns relieved of their responsibilities, effective immediately.  He then orders Alison to take a leave of absence, also effective immediately.  Alison angrily stalks off, telling Hal that she hates him.  John Dixon agrees to suspend Chris and Gordo, but Chris heatedly insists that they cannot keep him from visiting his father.  As Chris leaves the room, he runs into Alison, who insists that SHE will find out who the murderer is in order to clear Chris.\n\n\nAboard the plane, the fake FBI Agent Brackett admits to Dusty that he is working for James Stenbeck in order to repay a favor.  He tells Dusty, \"By the time we land, you won't be on the plane.\"  Margo bursts in and brings Dusty and the fake agent to the police station.  Holden rushes in, and the fake agent tells Margo, in front of Dusty and Holden, that he knows where Lily and Rose are, but that he doesn't care whether they live or die! Outside Margo's office, Dusty suggests to Margo and Holden that they offer the fake agent an incentive to get him to tell the truth.  Accordingly, Holden offers the fake agent three million dollars if he will tell them where Lily and Rose are, but the agent responds that he is satisfied with the thrill of knowing that Holden will never see his wife again.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Molly arrived in Montana for Jack and Carly's nuptials. Rosanna said it was bad luck for Jack and Carly to sleep together on the eve of their wedding. It was decided that the women would sleep in the house, while the men would sleep outside. Mike shared his sleeping bag with Parker, which forced Jack to share with Craig. Craig and Jack teased each other, to the great amusement of Mike and Parker, until Jack and Mike switched places. Inside the cabin, after many hugs and apologies, the girls bonded over wine and girl talk. They discussed honeymoons, and toasted to true love. Back in Oakdale, Rick's heart was re- started, and he was rushed to ICU. Allison and Emily discussed their mutual suspicion of Rick, but changed their minds after hearing of his attack. Hal questioned Chris and Gordo about their whereabouts at the time of the attack, and also asked Allison if she had seen them. Since neither intern had an alibi, he told John that both should be relieved of duties until the killer is found. He then ordered Allison to stay away from the hospital, but neither she nor Emily liked his tone. The fake Agent Brackett told Dusty he intended to push Dusty out after their plane took off, but Margo managed to stop the flight. Back at the police station, Margo and Dusty had to restrain Holden when he tried to attack \"Brackett.\" He offered the \"agent\" money for information about the twins, but \"Brackett\" insisted he had what he wanted: the knowledge that Holden and Dusty would never see the girls again. He finally admitted that Stenbeck would kill him if he talked.",
