They both hear a noise and wonder who is coming.  Dusty,  at first thinks that it is Nikki who called the guys in the cars.   Nikki reaches Hal and Emily's place, as her cell phone rings.  It is Dusty calling and he wants to know who she told about them all ready.  Nikki tells him that she didn't sell them out.   She doesn't know anything about the guys outside or anything going on.  Emily overhears part of the conversation and starts to question Nikki.  She calls Emily rude and they get into another argument.  Nikki knows that she has not been received with open arms by Emily, and confronts her with the idea that if she wants her to leave, just tell her.  Emily does just that.  Hal arrives home later, and calls everyone downstairs.  He asks where Nikki is, and Emily says, I don't know, she's gone.  Then she tells Hal that she asked Nikki to leave.  Hal stands there astonished.\n\n\nBack at the warehouse where Lucy notices that the noise they heard are not police cars but trucks, men are approaching where they are located.  Dusty and Lucy hide in a large crate.  The men enter, and, one of them notices that the place looks like it had visitors.  Dusty covers Lucy's mouth as she tries to say something.  The men walk out of the warehouse.  Lucy removes Dusty's hand.  They almost kiss but a large noise interrupts the mood.  The men have come back and all of a sudden, Dusty and Lucy,  are being crated and loaded into something that  indicates they are being shipped somewhere.\n\n\nCraig walks into a hotel room where two (2) men are playing cards.  Craig announces that the police know all about them.  They have the name of the guy with the tattoo and are looking for them.  Craig tells them to get lost.  They want to know about the money he promised them.  He tells them that they muffled the job and deserve nothing.  The men tell him that they will tell everyone that he is responsible for setting up the kidnapping of his own daughter.  Craig tells them that if they don't walk out the door with nothing, he will pick up the phone and call the police, which he starts to do.  Craig reminds them that they were to kidnap Lucy, hold her for ransom, and, then Craig was supposed to save her, but it didn't go at all like that.  The men walk out, but say to each other that they are not done with Craig yet.  Craig remains behind to pick up any belongings and things left.  He picks up a picture of Lucy and tells it not to give up on him yet.  Craig leaves the room, but, as he does, he runs into Nikki Munson, where apparently she is spending the night.  During the process, it looks as though the picture of Lucy has fallen out of Craig's pocket.\n\n\nMargo comes in the door and notices Tom there.  She tells him that she is ready to tell him everything.  She says that she wants him to know it all.  Margo tells Tom about Doc's advances.  She passed it off as innocent flirting the first time, but, the second time, he kissed her.  It was in the locker room.  He wants to know why Margo didn't slap Doc back.  What was wrong?  She can't answer him.  Tom says they had made a promise to each other never to go down that road again.  She tells him that it only happened once and nothing else.  Tom leans over to tell her that he doesn't believe her.  Katie knocks on the door and asks Margo to go back to the cottage. \n\n\nOn the way out, Margo tells Tom they have to get through this. \n\n\n\n\n\nKatie talks with Mike.  Mike thinks she is there to tell him that she appreciates what he did.  He knows that she loves him and yes, he loves her but, sometimes, love isn't enough.  Mikes reminds her of all the chances they had together, and they just blew them away.  He tells her that he won't come after her, and tells her that she should give everything you have to Simon.  She tells him, she saw Simon for the first time tonight.  Mike says that Simon has the best in Katie.  Mike has called Henry.  He tells him that he saw Katie.  Henry disagrees with him because he called the airport and the flight all ready left.  Mike says that perhaps they took a later flight.  At Katie's place, Katie wants Margo to tell everyone that she did leave with Simon.  She especially wants Mike to know this.  She wants him to find someone who will make him happy.  Margo says, that the trust sets one free, but if you are hurting someone you love, she just doesn't know.  Katie is closing the front door to leave town for awhile, and quietly says goodbye to Mike, their time together was way too short.\n\n\nDoc is leaving the club when Jill comes up to him.  She reminds him of where she knows him from.  She tells him that she would like to spend some time with him.  He tells her she is beautiful and should be with somebody who will return her attention.  She reminds him of catching him with Margo, and, he pushes her off with some excuse.  He also remembers Kim's talk with him.  He goes to call Margo, but, thinks she might be with Tom.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie tries to tell Mike that she's left Simon, but he wouldn't listen so she decided to leave Oakdale by herself. Margo and Tom argue, Margo telling Tom a small portion of the truth. When Katie begs Margo to escort her back to her cottage, Tom decides to confront Doc at the gym. Warehouse workers come and nearly discover Dusty and Lucy, but they hide in a large box. To their dismay, they find that they are being lifted away to be shipped somewhere. Nikki and Emily argue, Emily throwing her out much to Hal's dismay. Craig fires the thugs he hired to kidnap Lucy so he could come through with the ransom money and be her big hero. As he leaves their room at the Wagon Wheel, he drops a picture of Lucy before he bumps into Nikki.",
