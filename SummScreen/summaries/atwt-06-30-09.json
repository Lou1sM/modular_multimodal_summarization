    "soap_central": "\n\n \nPaul arrived at the Snyder Farm to take Eliza for a home visit.  He mentioned to Meg that he had heard a rumor that Dusty and Damian were battling for control of Worldwide.  He assumed that the conflict was not just about business, and that Meg would be flattered.  That statement irritated Meg, who sent Paul and the baby on their way.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Tom, Casey and Riley visited with Margo.  The doctor arrived and cleared the room, so Casey asked to speak to his father, just as Tom took a call from Dallas at the Oakdale Police Department.  Tom learned that the police had caught Colonel Mayer, so Tom went back into Margo's room to give her the news.  Riley asked Casey when he was going to tell Tom that Riley was really Adam, and Casey answered that he would tell him as soon as he could.\n\n\nMargo was relieved that Mayer was in custody, and then she asked Tom what Casey had wanted.  Tom said that he didn't know yet, so Margo was reluctant to let him leave her side.  Tom had promised to talk to Casey, so he went into the hall and asked his son if they could delay their chat until Margo fell asleep.  Casey agreed, so Tom gave the boys some money and told them to get something to eat.  The boys honored their father's wishes and went to Yo's.\n\n\nCasey was not about to let Riley's true identify stay hidden, so he brought up how Adam had attempted to rape Gwen Munson, Will's wife, and also the obvious theft of Riley Morgan's identity.   Casey maintained that Tom had a right to know, but Riley argued that by telling Tom who Riley was, they hurt Margo the most.  He theorized that Casey was ticked that Adam had gotten away with something while Casey had gotten caught for his transgressions and served jail time.  Casey argued strongly against that, but Riley said that being in Afghanistan had helped him appreciate his family more.  Casey said that all Riley had done since he got home, however, was to lie, and in true Casey style, he got up and left.\n\n\nTom and Margo continued to talk, and Tom asked what Colonel Mayer had on Riley Morgan in order to threaten him.  Margo feigned ignorance and made up a story about Casey's involvement with Noah's film project.  Tom couldn't make sense of it, so Margo suggested that he just let it go.\n\n\nBonnie ran into Dusty in the Lakeview, and he admitted that she had been right all along; he had been trying to control Meg.  He said he was headed to the farm to apologize, and, hopefully, he and Meg would have a brand new start.  Bonnie wished him good luck with that, as Dusty left.  Paul wheeled Eliza through the lobby, and Bonnie went off on him about how dumb men were not to leave a woman alone who wanted that.  Bonnie asked Paul when he was going to jump into the fray of competition for Meg, but he only said that Bonnie was hoping that Dusty would screw up again with Meg and go to her for comfort.\n\n\nDamian knocked on the door at the farm, and Meg noticed that he looked odd.  She let him in, and he told her about Colonel Mayer's shooting Margo and the colonel's subsequent capture.  He was very discouraged that Luke did not hold him in high regard, so Meg gave Damian a hug.  She spotted Dusty through the screen door and went outside to ask if he was spying on her.  Meg and Dusty traded sharp words, and Dusty quickly accused her of having something going on with Damian, the man who had tried to steal his company.  Meg did not enjoy being caught in the middle, and Dusty said he was sorry he had even bothered to go there to apologize to her.  He asked Meg to choose: Dusty or Damian.\n\n\nThe demand to make a choice angered Meg, and she yelled at Dusty that they were completely over.  Dusty turned and left, and Meg went inside and slammed the door.  She shouted at Damian and asked for nothing more than peace and quiet in her life.  When Damian called Dusty a bully, however, Meg defended Dusty and she pleaded with Damian to allow her to fight her own battles.  He honored her wishes and walked out.\n\n\nRiley went back to Memorial and sat with Margo, and he enjoyed hearing her call him, \"Adam.\"  He asked his mother when she knew he was Adam, and Margo said she probably knew right from the beginning when Riley walked into Adam's memorial service.  Margo was worried that Casey and Tom were alone at the house, and she was concerned about Tom's reaction if Casey told him that Riley was really Adam.  She said she could never send another of her sons to prison.\n\n\nCasey found Tom at home packing an overnight bag for Margo.  He stopped for his talk with Casey, but opened the conversation by telling the boy not to feel responsible for Colonel Mayer's showing up at the house.  Tom said he was proud of how Casey had handled their adding Riley to the household because it pleased Margo.  He hugged his son and then asked Casey to take the bag to Margo because he was going to be tied up in a meeting for several hours.  Casey was disappointed that he had not gotten time to really talk to his dad.\n\n\nDusty went back to the Lakeview and saw Bonnie finishing up her notes on a client meeting she had just concluded.  Dusty asked her to join him for a drink, but first Bonnie correctly surmised that Dusty's apology to Meg had not gone well.  He said that he had found Meg and Damian with their arms around one another, and then Meg had told Dusty that the two of them were done.  Dusty made several scurrilous remarks about Damian, who happened to walk by and overhear them.  He warned Dusty to leave Meg alone, as Paul lurked in the doorway and listened.  Bonnie separated the two contenders and told each one to back off.\n\n\nPaul went to the Snyder farm after leaving Eliza with Barbara for a visit.  He told Meg that he thought something was up with her, and Meg confided that both Dusty and Damian were driving her nuts.  Paul gave her a bag of toys for the baby and suggested that she leave them at Barbara's so that the baby would have something to play with when she visited her grandmother.  Meg agreed, and she also said that she would be glad to chat with Barbara herself when she picked up the baby.\n\n\nCasey went back to the hospital and delivered the suitcase to Margo.  She was very relieved that Casey had not told Tom that Riley was Adam.  The boys argued again, and Riley left.  Margo begged Casey not to tell Tom the truth and to let her be a mother to both her sons.\n\n\nPaul went to the docks posing as an employee of Mr. Donovan.  He told a dockworker that he had a delivery for Mr. Grimaldi, so the worker directed him to Damian's ships.  Paul crossed over into a restricted area and cut a fuel hose, which spewed lime green fuel into the water.  He returned to the Lakeview in time to see Damian receive a disturbing phone call from the docks.  He also saw Meg wheel Eliza out of the elevator on her way down from Barbara's room.\n\n\nPaul and Meg heard Damian accuse Dusty of doing some horrible damage, and he told Dusty not to think that a cut fuel line could stop him.  He warned that what Dusty had done was a criminal act, and that he had hurt his neighbors and friends in the city.  Meg asked what was going on, so Damian explained that Dusty had damaged the harbor by dumping fuel from one of the Grimaldi ships.  Dusty denied that he had been involved, and Bonnie asked when the fuel had spilled.  When Damian gave her the time frame, Bonnie said that she had been with Dusty then.\n\n\nDamian said that the dockworker had said that a man had identified himself as working for Dusty Donovan and that he had a delivery for Mr. Grimaldi.  Meg agreed that it didn't sound like something Dusty would do.  Paul pulled Meg aside and asked her if she needed to get involved in the donnybrook, and Meg thought Paul had a good point.  Paul, Meg, and Eliza left the Lakeview.\n\n\nCasey went home and told Riley that he was keeping his mouth shut for the time being.  Riley thanked him and said that he wanted to make amends, but Casey was not interested.\n\n\nMeg put the baby to bed at the farm, and she and Paul discussed their apparently successful parenting together.  Paul left under pleasant circumstances.\n\n\nDamian viewed the fuel spill and spoke to the cleanup crew.  He verified the dockworker's statement and swore that Dusty Donovan would pay.  Back in the hotel, Dusty was amused by Damian's accusation about the fuel spill, but Bonnie warned him to protect himself.  Dusty agreed that Damian was right; this was war.\n\n\n",
