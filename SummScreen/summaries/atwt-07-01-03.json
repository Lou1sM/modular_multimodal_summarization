When Rick asked if his fingerprints were found on the syringe used in his attack, Walker wondered how Rick knew the syringe had been found, since no syringe was found in any of the other attacks. When Rick became agitated by the questions, Hal ordered Walker out of Rick's room. He told Walker he was in charge of the investigation, and Walker needed to back off. When Walker refused, Hal said he could make his request official. Alison wanted to come back to work, but Chris said no way. Ali said she wanted to be there because she wanted to protect Chris and his reputation. John told Ali he needed Susan's permission to let Ali come back. Gordo overheard Ali accuse him of the murders. After John refused to reinstate him, Gordo confronted Ali about her accusations. Henry told Dusty he could use his electronics expertise to help find Lily and Rose, for a price. With Lucy's encouragement, Aaron insisted on helping with the search. At a press conference, Holden offered $10 million for the safe return of the women.
