Craig said he could always kidnap the baby after he was born, and he and Rosanna could run off together with the boy, but Rosanna quickly nixed that idea. She then went to see Jennifer to warn her that Craig now felt he had nothing to lose and might do something drastic if Jennifer didn't change her mind and agree to give him some visitation rights. She also accused Jennifer of having set up the whole \"fall\" incident with Dusty and said that she would let everyone know what Jennifer and Dusty had done. Jennifer insisted she hadn't done anything wrong and that she would continue to do whatever it took to protect her child from Craig, so Rosanna left. She told Craig she hadn't had any success, and Craig said he had always been his own worst enemy.\n\n\nMike and Jennifer were at the cottage when Mike told Jenn about his argument with Katie at the courthouse (in which she accused Jennifer of setting up the fall at Metro to get Craig away from her and the baby). Mike told Jennifer that he couldn't have a relationship of any kind with someone that wasn't built on trust. Mike then left to go to Metro to get dinner for the two of them. Dusty called Meg and invited her to have a drink with him; she told him it would have to be dinner and a drink, to which he agreed. Meg went to meet Dusty at Metro, where they ran into Mike, who was picking up dinner for himself and Jennifer. When Dusty went to the bar to get drinks, Mike apologized to him for not believing him about Craig, and Dusty accepted the apology. Then, Meg introduced herself to Mike while Dusty was busy making a phone call, and she told Mike she'd been to his cottage that morning because she'd seen Dusty there and wanted to talk to him. Mike asked Dusty why he had been at the cottage that morning, and Dusty said he'd gone to see if Jennifer wanted a ride, but she'd already left when he got there. After Mike left, Dusty called Jennifer and warned her that Mike had asked about that morning at the cottage, and he told her that she should stick to the story he gave Mike; Jennifer told Dusty that the last thing she wanted was for Mike to find out what they had done to Craig, not realizing that Mike had opened the door and heard her part of that exchange. Mike went back outside the cottage without letting Jennifer know he was there.\n\n\nLily and Holden talked about whether they should put off their divorce, but Holden didn't feel that they should lead Luke on or give him the mistaken impression that they might get back together. Lily said she had to leave to meet Keith for dinner, but her cell phone rang, and it was Sierra telling her that Lucinda wanted to see both of them to give them the results of the biopsy in person. When Lily got to Lucinda's house, Lucinda told Lily and Sierra that the cancer was stage 3, which only 50% of women survive for more than 5 years. She told them that she was determined to fight the cancer the way she'd fought all her battles: as though she had already won. She also told them she would reach out to them for support when the time came, but that the time had not yet come, although she did tell them both how much she loved them, and they had a group hug.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Keith waited at Metro, which he had rented out for just himself and Lily for a romantic surprise. He tried to call Lily, but when she didn't answer her cell phone, Keith realized she wasn't coming. He told the maitre'd at Metro that his plans had changed; he gave him more money for his trouble and took the flowers he'd bought for Lily and headed to Lily's house. Holden answered the door at Lily's house and told Keith that Lucinda had called about the biopsy report. Keith said he understood that Lily needed to be with her mother, and he gave Holden the flowers and asked him to give them to Lily when he saw her again.\n\n\nEmily showed up at Paul's place sooner than he expected and had her bags with her. She told Paul she wasn't sure that moving in with him was the right thing to do. Paul told her that it was the right thing for him, but she needed to think it was right for her, too. When Emily wondered if she should leave so that Will wouldn't find out she and Paul were together now, he insisted it wouldn't be a problem and that he'd have to tell everyone that Emily was living with him unless she wanted to keep it a secret. \n\n\nWill went to pick up Gwen for dinner at Paul's apartment. While there, Barbara showed up and told Will about Craig's restraining order. She also told Will and Gwen that since this baby would be her grandchild, she wanted to offer Gwen a place to stay --- with her. Will turned her down and asked her if she was responsible for his credit cards suddenly not being accepted anymore; Barbara told him she thought it best if she took over his finances for now. Will asked Barbara to leave, and then he and Gwen went to Paul's apartment. They walked in just as Paul and Emily were kissing, and when Will saw that, he shouted, \"What the hell is going on?\" Everyone looked mortified, and Emily told Will it was complicated, but Will said, \"You're sleeping with my brother, you dumped my father --- that's not complicated, that's sick!\" Paul tried to gloss over the situation, trying to introduce himself to Gwen, but Will didn't want to ignore the situation. At that point, Barbara came into the apartment and asked what was going on, so Will told her that it appeared that Paul had a new girlfriend --- Emily. Will told Gwen to look around at the Ryan family and see what she was getting herself into. Barbara blasted Emily for seducing her husband and now her son, again, and asked her if she knew the meaning of a certain word that might describe Emily. Paul and Emily argued with Barbara, and Will said he and Gwen were leaving, but then he looked around and realized that Gwen had already left. He told everyone to stay away from him and Gwen. Paul told Barbara to leave, and then he told Emily that this was all Barbara's fault and Emily shouldn't worry about any of it.\n\n\n\n\n",
