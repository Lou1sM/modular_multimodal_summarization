Ben tells Tom that they need to act soon because John wants to try something different on her.  Tom finally decides to try the alternative, but he tells Ben that he needs to be the one to administer it.  Ben gives Tom instructions on how to administer the drug and gives him the syringe.  While Tom starts, Ben steps out into the hall to watch for anyone coming.  John walks up and starts into Lien's room.  Ben stops him to talk about a patient.  John tells him unless it is an emergency; he has to see Lien now.  John starts to walk by and Ben stops him and says, \"You can't go in there.\"  Inside the room, Tom is using the syringe to put the medication in Lien's I.V.  When John comes into the room, Tom is finished, but still holding the I.V.  John asks Tom why is he touching the I.V.  Tom tells John that Lien's tubing was all tangled and he was just fixing it.  John checks everything out and says that it looks ok and tells Tom that the next time he is to call a nurse to take care of such things.  John tells Tom that there is something new that he wants to try on Lien.  Tom argues with John a little but John informs him that he is her doctor.  Tom informs John that he is her father.  John says that they are going to have to try something different soon and he leaves.  Ben tells Tom, when John is gone, that anything that John wants to try will negate what they have just administered.  Ben tells him that they have to hold John off as long as possible.  Tom asks when will they need to administer the next dose and Ben tells him soon.  He adds that for now all they can do is wait and pray.  Ben walks over to Lien, puts his hand on her head and starts to pray.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Hal and Emily are at one table and Craig and Cass Winthrop are at another table.  Hal is telling Emily that he has found evidence that Craig did not set the bomb for Barbara.  Emily tells him to let the guy take the rap for it anyway.  Hal says that as much as he hates Craig Montgomery, he can't let him take the rap for something that he didn't do.  Hal influences Emily not to run the story about Craig in The Intruder.  Emily finally agrees and then gets a call on her cell phone.  When she hangs up, she tells Hal that the phone call was one of her reporters telling her that the footprints that were found outside the boathouse matched Craig's.\n\n\nOver at Craig's table, Cass is very upset with Craig and demands that he tell the truth about where he was the night of the bombing.  Craig tells Cass that he did go to the boathouse, but he didn't go inside.  He adds that he got there and saw the look on Barbara's face and turned and left.  Cass asks if he is to believe that Craig went all the way there and then didn't stay to see what Barbara had to say to Jack.  Craig says that when he saw the look on Barbara's face, he knew that she was going to press charges.  He realized that he needed to raise some cash and fast and Hong Kong was the place to do that.  So, he left and went to his apartment to get some things together and he knows the rest from there.  Cass asks how his money clip was found inside the building.  Craig says that he said before that he gave it to Barbara earlier that day.  Cass tells Craig that he has lied to the police and he has lied to his lawyer.  He asks Craig how he thinks this looks.  Cass tells him that at best the jury will think he plotted Barbara's murder or at worst, he walked away from a burning building with his wife in it.  Craig says that he has slit his own throat and now all he can do is bleed to death.  \n\n\nWhen Hal hears that Craig's footprints have been found at the crime site, he charges over to Craig's table.  He tells him that he can't believe that he would leave Barbara in an exploding building to die.  Craig tells him that he doesn't know what he is talking about.  Hal starts to yell at Craig.  Craig reminds him that Hal had told him he pretty much didn't do it.  Hal says was believing that until the footprints showed up.  Hal yells at Craig that he is going down.  Emily grabs Hal and pushes him out of the restaurant with Hal yelling, \"You're going down, Montgomery. You're going down!!\"\n\n\nSimon is on his way to find Katie.  As he is flying along, he gets a message over the radio that he is heading for a storm and should turn back.  Simon starts to think about how Katie has lied and schemed against him.  He radios back and asks for a new coordinate.  The radio person asks where he would like to go.  Simon tells him that he wants to go to some island where there are a lot pretty girls and some booze.  After he gets turned around, he starts to think about Katie again.  He remembers the fun times they had had.  He remembers Katie smile and how much she loves him.  He radios again and tells the person that he is turning back and they shouldn't try to stop him.  He heads for the island to rescue Katie.\n\n\nOn the island, Katie is in the middle of an attitude change and it is freaking Henry out.  Henry decides to shake things up and gets a great idea.  He sits Katie down and asks her to marry him.  She jerks her hand away and her mouth drops open.  She starts to yell at him and jumps up and starts to throw coconuts at him.  He has achieved what he was after.  She tells him that she is married and she is now and will remain a Frazier.  Cooley walks up in the middle of their fight and settles them down.  He brings Katie some flowers and tells her a myth about the flowers.  The legend with the flowers is that if you viciously destroy the flowers, the person will be cursed.  But, if you gently pick the petals off the flowers and throw them into the sea, the sailor will find peace and the person will be granted their most secret wish.  Katie loves the story and asks the two men to leave her by herself for a while.  Cooley tells \"Hank\" to come along with him and let the little girly be by herself.  Henry says that he will come, but he better never call him Hank again.  After the men are gone, Katie looks at the flowers and says that she can't believe that she is this desperate.  She goes to the edge of the water and starts to pick the petals off the flower.  She closes her eyes as she drops the petals in the water and says, \"My only wish is to see Simon again.\"\n\n\n",
