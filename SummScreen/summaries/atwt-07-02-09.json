    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLarry met with Emily, and she asked him if he had ever known a woman named Aurora Hunter.  His answer was, \"No, not really,\" and he claimed that he knew her only by reputation at the University of Chicago.  Emily reminded him that would have occurred around the time that Alison was born and that Emily's fertilized eggs had been transported to the same facility.  Then she asked Larry point-blank if he and Aurora Hunter had produced a child using Emily's eggs.  Larry said that they could not discuss that in a public place, and he hustled her upstairs to his hotel room.\n\n\nLarry still maintained that he had no personal knowledge of Dr. Aurora Hunter, and he suggested that Emily face the fact that her eggs were gone.  They both relaxed a bit, and Larry poured them each a scotch.  Emily casually mentioned that Dr. Hunter had died recently, and Larry reacted visibly.  Emily noticed his shock and commented on it, but Larry next asked how Emily had heard of Dr. Hunter's death.  Emily explained that Alison's friend Hunter was Aurora's son.  That further stunned Larry, so Emily told him the whole story about the mysterious Tristan Wagner.\n\n\nLarry said he did not give the Tristan story much credence, and he blamed it on the delusional ramblings of a stroke victim.  Emily put in a call to Hunter and asked him to call her back when he received the message.  Larry encouraged Emily to sit on the bed and relax, but she asked for ice in her drink.  Larry offered to call room service, but Emily said that took too long.  Larry left to get ice at the bar in the lobby, and the minute he departed, Emily began going through the drawer in his desk.  She found a money clip engraved with the words \"To Tristan from Isolde.\"\n\n\nHunter and Alison kissed in his room, and he told her how beautiful she was.  They continued to kiss until Alison stopped him.  She said that they were both upset at that moment, but Hunter wanted to continue. He told Alison that she was the only girl who had ever understood him. When his phone rang, he let it go to messages.  Alison reiterated that sleeping with Hunter at that point would be a huge mistake, and he knew that she was not over Casey yet.  Hunter advised her to just go, but Alison did not want to leave him.  Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.\n\n\nHunter answered the door and found Casey there.  Casey spotted Alison sitting on Hunter's bed and made an insulting comment.  Alison cried out that nothing had happened, and then Hunter stepped up, and he and Casey argued.  Finally Hunter said that he would never have treated Alison the way Casey had because he loved her.  Alison was stunned by Hunter's admission, but Casey wished her a nice life and took off.  Alison ran out after him.\n\n\nRiley invited Casey to visit their mother in the hospital, but that precipitated another argument between the two.  Casey told his brother that he had ruined Casey's life by scaring away Alison, but Riley claimed that he was not Adam anymore and at least he was moving on.  They argued loudly, and Riley said that Casey could not blame all his problems on Riley, particularly his breaking up with Alison.  He urged Casey to go find Alison and make things right.\n\n\nCraig visited Margo at Memorial, and he told her that he and Carly were getting married.  Margo asked if she had to be his best man again, but Craig said that all he wanted was her best wishes for a wonderful future -- and her house as the site for the ceremony.  Margo rolled her eyes and took a pain pill.  Craig asked to borrow Margo's house for his wedding in two days, but Margo reminded him that she had just taken a bullet in the line of duty and that Carly had a lovely nightclub, which would do nicely as a wedding venue.  Craig said he did not like the idea of getting married in a bar and begged his sister to help him.  He reflected on how much he loved Carly, and Margo finally gave in and agreed.\n\n\nAt home, Carly worked on her wedding dress, but she pricked her finger and got blood on the fabric.  She ran to the refrigerator for some seltzer water and applied some to the material, but the stain would not come out.  Carly was distraught and sought solace in her stash of vodka, which she had concealed among her spices.  Rosanna surprised her sister by using her key and letting herself in, so Carly quickly put the vodka away.  Rosanna had been unsuccessful in finding employment, and she again thanked Carly for providing her with free room and board.\n\n\nCarly resumed work on her dress, and Parker found her.  He seemed unimpressed by her design and continued about his own business.  Rosanna invited Carly to lunch to celebrate her upcoming nuptials, and after first declining the invitation, Carly reconsidered and accepted.  The two of them went to the Lakeview, and Rosanna mentioned that her sister seemed especially wound up, but Carly blamed it on wedding jitters.  Rosanna ordered a bottle of champagne, and just as the waiter was about to open and pour it, Craig walked up and asked if they were \"throwing caution to the wind.\"\n\n\nRosanna picked up on the tension between Carly and Craig, especially after Craig asked Carly to step away from the table for a short conference with him.  Carly did so reluctantly, and the two of them argued, as Craig reminded Carly that she was not supposed to drink anything alcoholic. Rosanna interrupted them to ask what was going on.  Carly apologized, and Rosanna graciously offered to host the lunch at a more convenient time.  Carly agreed, and Craig volunteered to take Carly home, leaving a very perplexed Rosanna.\n\n\nUpstairs in the Lakeview, Larry returned to his room with Emily's ice.  As he was putting some in her glass, Emily \"accidentally\" dropped it, making a mess on the carpet.  Larry attended to the cleanup, while Emily made a dash to the dresser and grabbed Larry's comb.  She slipped it into an envelope and secreted it in her purse.  She decided to pass on another drink and made a hasty exit.  Back at her office, Emily searched Hunter's desk until she found his coffee mug.  She slipped it into a plastic bag in her office and put it in her briefcase.  As she passed through Hunter's office on her way out, she was surprised to see him putting all his personal items into a box.\n\n\nHunter announced that he was quitting, but Emily could not believe it.  He looked for his coffee mug, but finally abandoned the search.  Emily asked him to please call her before he went anywhere.  Hunter walked out, so Emily called a friend who worked in a local lab and made arrangements to drop off the cup and comb for speedy DNA testing.\n\n\nThe hospital released Margo, and Riley took her home.  She was encouraged that her two feuding sons had not destroyed their house.  Casey returned and told Riley that he had found Alison with another guy.  Casey saw Alison arrive at the front door, so he told Riley to tell her that he wasn't home, and he left the room.  Riley answered the door and made an excuse, but Alison saw right through it.  Riley told Alison that Casey's problem was not with her but with him.  Casey walked back in and cautioned Alison not to believe a word that Riley said.\n\n\nMargo joined them, and Casey was surprised to see his mother home.  He questioned whether she was well enough, but Margo assured him that she was.  She invited Alison to stay for dinner, but Casey interjected that the girl was just leaving.  Alison asked Casey to walk her out, but he declined.  After Alison left, Margo reminded her son that he had promised to keep Riley's true identity a secret, and she went to rest.  The boys picked up their futile argument again.\n\n\nCarly admitted to Craig that she did not want Rosanna to know about her drinking problem.  She sarcastically said that she wanted to hide her \"dirty little secret.\"  In the kitchen at Carly's, Rosanna prepared dinner and talked with Parker.  Parker was cool with the idea of Johnny's moving in with their family when Craig joined them.  Rosanna commented that Carly seemed anxious and asked if anything was going on that she should know about.  When Parker did not answer, Rosanna confided that she thought that her sister had changed a great deal since she had been gone, and it frightened her.  She said that Carly appeared much more passive, but Parker took the blame for putting his mother through some rough times.\n\n\nCraig and Carly returned to the house, and Carly went upstairs.  Craig asked Parker to be his best man in the wedding, and they shook hands on it.  In the kitchen, Rosanna looked for seasoning for her chicken dish, and she prowled through Carly's cupboards.  She found the bottle of vodka, just as Carly entered the room.  Rosanna asked why the vodka was behind all the spices, and Carly answered that she had stashed it there to remove temptation from Parker, who had experimented with some of Craig's flavored vodkas.  Carly took the vodka and put it in the refrigerator.\n\n\nRosanna served dinner and, to everyone's surprise, produced the bottle of champagne that she and Carly had not opened at lunch.  She passed out glasses and declared that she wanted to toast the engaged couple and drink to new beginnings.  Carly attempted to beg off because of a headache, but Rosanna urged her to at least drink to the toast.  Carly faked taking a sip, as Craig stared her down.\n\n\nRiley found a dejected Alison sitting on a bench in Old Town.  He apologized for Casey's behavior and said that he hoped that she and Casey could work out their problems.  Alison mused that she had passed on a chance to move on, but perhaps she should have taken it.\n\n\nLarry drained his scotch and was stunned to find his engraved money clip on the floor beneath his desk.\n\n\nHunter finished packing his boxes when Emily surprised him at the door.  She said that he could not leave because she had something very important to tell him.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Emily questions Larry if he ever knew an Aurora Hunter and were they lovers. This would have been around the time Alison was born.
