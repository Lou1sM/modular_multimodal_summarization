    "soap_central": "\n\n\"The jig is up, you lying little hussy,\" Barbara proclaimed as she watched Fashion's dressing room footage of Vienna slipping padding over her stomach.\n\n\n       At Katie's house, Vienna donned her padding as Katie implored her to tell Henry the truth. Vienna believed she'd get pregnant that night, so the truth didn't matter. Likening her feelings for Henry to Katie's feelings for Brad, she asserted that Henry would forget Barbara.\n\n\nJust then, Barbara called to taunt Vienna about her trip to Dr. Ming's shop for fertility drugs. Vienna demanded that Barbara tell what she thought she knew, and Barbara hissed that Vienna wasn't pregnant at all. Revealing that she had proof about the belly padding, Barbara offered to spare Henry the truth, if Vienna abandoned the wedding. However, if Vienna dared to enter Al's Diner, Barbara would blow the sham of a wedding sky high.\n\n\nOnce off the phone, Vienna panicked, and Katie urged her friend to tell Henry before Barbara could. Vienna worried that Barbara would get to him first, but Katie said she'd take care of Barbara. Vienna rushed out. Katie left soon after and ran into Chris in the corridor. She murmured that there was a change in plans, and she'd meet him at the wedding.\n\n\nAt Java, Kim was anxious to get to the wedding early in case Barbara showed up to make a scene. Kim figured that Chris, Katie's date, could help Kim and Bob hustle Barbara out of there, if need be. Bob remarked that he'd advised Chris to give Katie space. Kim said that made two of them. Bob and Kim liked Katie, but were concerned about Chris because Katie was still grieving for Brad. They discussed how Chris had taken off twice after painful breakups with Alison. Kim worried that if Katie hurt him, he'd leave again.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Barbara swiped the surveillance disc and tried to brush past Emily on the street. She touted that she had something to show Henry; however, Emily ordered \"Mrs. Robinson\" to leave poor Henry alone. Barbara told Emily to take up knitting and stay out of her business. The two bickered about Barbara meddling in Emily's affairs until Barbara finally said that if Emily didn't move, Barbara would make her move.\n\n\nEmily gloated that Barbara couldn't compete with Vienna and the baby, but Barbara claimed to know things that Emily didn't. Emily urged her to share, and Barbara laughed at the thought of confiding in her. Emily guessed that Barbara had nothing, and as she taunted Barbara about losing Henry, Barbara snatched Emily's dress strap and ripped it to force Emily to go home to change before the wedding.\n\n\nBob and Kim happened along in time to see the scuffle. Kim tried to reason with Barbara, who retorted, \"Shut up, Kim!\" Barbara exclaimed that she was tired of listening to people talk her out of her happiness. Barbara vowed to save Henry from a lying, conniving tramp, something she hadn't been able to do for her own son. Barbara and Emily stomped off, and Bob hoped they had good food at the wedding.\n\n\nBob and Kim were the first to arrive for the wedding, and were followed by Chris, who was concerned about Katie's mood earlier. His parents figured that Katie might be thinking of Brad on their best friends' wedding day. Chris took off, and Kim remarked that their son had it bad for Katie. Bob cooed that he and Kim had been married for three months, and Kim was tickled to be a newlywed. She hoped that Chris and Barbara could find loves like hers and Bob's.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Paul found Henry too jittery to even pick out a tie. After selecting one and deciding to hold onto the wedding rings, Paul awkwardly asked if Henry still had feelings for Barbara. Henry wondered who wouldn't have feelings for her, and he poetically listed Barbara's wonders. Paul advised Henry to reconsider his wedding, and Henry asked for a drink.\n\n\nPaul refused to let Henry show up to his wedding drunk, or to let him marry the wrong woman. Henry said that he'd agonized about it, but he just had to let Barbara go. \"Dear God in heaven, you're in love with my mother,\" Paul murmured. Henry pushed his stunned brother aside and rushed to the bar for that drink.\n\n\n       Downstairs, Paul followed Henry into the lounge, but neither man saw Barbara slip into the elevator with her surveillance disc. Back upstairs, a plain clothed guard caught Barbara trying to break into Henry's room. The guard knocked on the door, but when Henry didn't answer, the guard left. Someone in red gloves grabbed Barbara and pressed a cloth over her nose and mouth.\n\n\nAt the bar, Paul discouraged Henry from drinking before the wedding, but Henry tried to pour himself a triple at the thought of spending the rest of his life married. Paul said that if Henry really loved Barbara, he couldn't marry Vienna. \"I do,\" Henry said. He regretted sleeping with Vienna, who'd subsequently become pregnant. Paul reasoned that Henry could honor his commitment to the baby without being married.\n\n\n       Still drinking, Henry explained that the miscarriage had broken him and Vienna; however, the new baby was a gift. He felt that he owed it to Vienna to stand by her, and he'd made up his mind to do just that. Paul conceded and ordered Henry some coffee. Henry gulped down more liquor and said Paul was the best man a guy could have.\n\n\n       Later, Paul helped a gregarious and stumbling Henry into Al's Diner. Henry went straight for the champagne, and Kim and Bob noted that Henry was wasted. Conversing with Paul, they guessed it had to do with Barbara, who'd had an altercation with Emily earlier. Bob and Kim explained that Emily would be there once she'd changed clothes.\n\n\n       Josiah, a guy who'd gotten his Internet certificate to marry couples at the same time that Henry had, arrived in a black Vulcan costume. He intended to marry Henry and Vienna during his break between the Star Trek conventions that day. Henry said that with enough champagne, he was cool with anything. Paul handed his brother another glass of bubbly.\n\n\n       Henry babbled to Josiah about love and marriage, and he wound up blabbing about his trials with Vienna and Barbara. Just as Paul worried about what was keeping Emily, she arrived, fuming about Barbara ruining her dress. Paul thought he should call his mother, but Emily seemed suspiciously certain that Barbara wouldn't show up at the wedding.\n\n\n       Wearing her bridal gown, Vienna rushed into the diner, and she said that she had something very important to tell her groom. Glancing at her padded stomach, Henry naively exclaimed that the baby was showing, and it had happened all at once, just as Vienna had said it would. Realizing that Barbara hadn't told Henry about the padding, Vienna suddenly proclaimed that it was her destiny to be Mrs. Henry Coleman forever.\n\n\n       Henry murmured that she seemed nervous, and he offered to postpone the event. Vienna replied that she wanted to marry him at that instant. Paul told Emily that the bride and groom had better marry before Barbara showed up. \"She won't. Woman's intuition,\" Emily replied.\n\n\n       At Katie's house, Chris knocked on her door, and she silently approached from behind with dirt on her arms and face. Chris wondered what had happened to her. Inside, Katie cleaned herself up as she explained that Barbara had threatened to foil Vienna's scheme. While searching the whole town for Barbara, Katie had realized that she was obsessed with Henry and Vienna, because she had no love life of her own.\n\n\n       Katie revealed that Vienna's return to town had reminded her of when she, Brad, Vienna, and Henry had been inseparable.  She sobbed that Vienna and Henry had fallen apart, and Katie just wanted her old life with Brad back. She was dirty because she'd sobbed her troubles to Brad at his gravesite earlier. It was there that she'd realized that she couldn't put Henry and Vienna back together. What they'd had was gone, and so was Brad.\n\n\n       Chris informed Katie that he was certain that Vienna hadn't told Henry anything about the nonexistent baby, and neither had Barbara. Katie thought that was good, but Chris pointed out that Barbara could show up at the wedding at any time. Katie agreed, and she hustled to change, so that they could leave.\n\n\n       When Katie and Chris arrived at Al's, Katie pulled Vienna aside to ask if she'd told Henry the truth. Vienna said that she'd done what she had to do. Conferring with Chris, Katie figured that Vienna must have told Henry, but it hadn't registered because Henry was drunk. Chris said Henry would have to be in a coma for that not to register.\n\n\n       Across the room, Henry slapped himself several times to sober up, and Paul called everyone to their places. The guests glanced around, presumably looking for Barbara. Josiah commenced the ceremony and asked if anyone knew a reason that the couple shouldn't be married that day. Meanwhile, Barbara lay unconscious on a warehouse floor. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Henry feels he must do the right thing and marry Vienna because she is carrying his child but he is very nervous and decides to drink until his nerves go away. Henry admits to Paul that he is in love with Barbara and Paul advises Henry not to marry Vienna and tells him he can still be a good father to his child. Henry feels he owes Vienna this marriage because of all the pain she suffered when she lost their first child. Paul manages to get Henry to Al's diner for the wedding where Henry drinks champagne like a fish determined to go through with the wedding. Barbara calls Vienna and tell her that she has proof she isn't pregnant and she will show Henry the proof unless Vienna leaves Oakdale today without marrying Henry. Vienna panics and Katie advises her to tell Henry the truth before Barbara has a chance to get to him. Vienna agrees and Katie tells Vienna she will take care of Barbara. Barbara gets into a shocking match with Emily when Emily tries to stop her from finding Henry to keep him from marrying Vienna. Barbara gets to the Lakeview but Henry is gone and while she is looking for her phone someone puts their hand over her mouth and drags her away. We later see Barbara laying on the floor of a darkened warehouse. Katie finally tells Chris that the reason that she wanted to help Henry and Vienna get married because she wanted to forget how much she missed Brad. Katie also tells Chris that Henry and Vienna being married won't bring Brad back to her. Katie tells Chris that once she realized that she stopped looking for Barbara and went to Brad's grave to have a good cry. Bob and Kim worry that if Katie breaks Chris's heart because she isn't ready to have a relationship with him then he will leave Oakdale again. Vienna arrives at the diner and tells Henry she is more then ready to become Mrs. Henry Coleman today. The vows begin and the minister asks if there is any just cause for this couple not to be married.",
