Craig wanted to know what she and Barbara's staff was doing working on the holiday.  She told him that she has BRO stock and she is making sure that the business is kept running while Barbara was in the hospital.  She told him that the corporate accounts are frozen so there is no money for the attempted murderer to get a hold of.  Craig looked at Barbara's sketched for the 2002 Spring line.  Lucinda told him that with those sketches they would have no problem in keeping Barbara's business going while she is in the hospital.  He accused Lucinda of having Barbara's accounts frozen to keep him from paying back Bryant's trust fund.  He told her he was going to repay the loan.  Lucinda told him that maybe he would, but not at the expense of Barbara.  Craig got the attention of the staff and made an announcement.  He said that he was now in charge of BRO since Barbara was in a coma and Paul was unavailable.  Craig said as of this moment he's in charge of BRO and he fired Barbara's staff.  He had guards there to make sure that everyone would leave.   Lucinda assured them that she would get this straightened out and would hire them back the next day.  Craig said from now on, BRO business would be handled in Oakdale.  Lucinda told Craig to enjoy it while he could and walked out.  \n\n\nThe Hospital:\n\nTom told Ben that he is disappointed that there is no change in Lien after giving her a shot of the new drug.  As Tom gave Lien another dose, Margo walked in the room and wanted to know what was going on.  They told Margo it was a new drug that wasn't approved yet.  Margo was upset when they told her what he was doing.  She wanted to know if John and Bob were in the dark.  Tom told her he doesn't care if he gets in hot water; he had to do everything he could to save his daughter.  They talked about the decision that Margo made with Casey years ago.  She said she understood what he was going through.  Bob and Lisa walked in and asked if there was any improvement.  Lisa said she had a dream and it was so real.  She said they were all together watching the fireworks, including Lien.  Lien opened her eyes and was gasping for air.  Tom called out for Ben.  Lien said, \"I can breath.\"  Everyone was so excited and began asking questions all at once.  When she heard the fireworks, she wanted to know what the noise was about.  Ben carried her to the window so she could watch the fireworks display.  \n\n\nOutside Barbara's room, Jack was playing with Parker.  He told Carly that he was going in to visit with Barbara and would be back in a few minutes.  As he opened the door, he saw Julia talking to the unconscious Barbara.  When she saw Jack, she asked him not to leave.  Julia told Jack that the doctor gave her special permission to visit Barbara.  She said she had no idea that Barbara was hurt so badly.  She told him she would have been to see Barbara sooner, but it was so traumatic the way she heard that Barbara was injured.  She told him she was in shock when Carly accused her of setting the bomb because she wanted him dead.  She asked Jack if he thought she could ever want him dead.  Jack didn't answer and said he'd better leave.  She asked him not to leave yet.  She told him that he must feel sorry for not being able to save Barbara from being hurt.  They argue about whether he did all he could to save Barbara.  \n\n\nJohn saw Carly and Parker waiting for Jack and stopped to talk to them.  Carly defended Craig when John talked about Craig being responsible for Barbara being in the hospital.  John couldn't believe that Carly could defend him.  John wondered if Craig was paying Carly to defend him.  \n\n\nJulia walked out of Barbara's room and stared daggers at Carly.  She told Jack with disgust that she knew now why he wanted to leave Barbara's room so soon, because Carly was waiting for him.  When she saw Parker she walked over to talk to him.  Carly didn't want Julia near Parker and told him to go to Jack.  Julia told Carly that it was good that Parker was there or she would have clawed her face off.  As Julia walked off, Carly told John and Jack \"Julia is totally around the bend.\"  John asked her how she was able to derive at that diagnosis.  He told her she should be more charitable to people whose lives she had ruined.  As Carly walked away, John tried to warn Jack about Carly ruining his life too.\n\n\nBuilding Rooftop:\n\nJennifer and Bryant were planning to spend the evening alone on the rooftop to watch the 4th of July fireworks.  As they talked, Adam and Abigail opened the door to the rooftop.  They had the same idea about spending time alone on the rooftop to watch the fireworks.  Adam and Bryant left to get something to eat, so that the girls would have a chance to talk.  Abigail asked how Barbara was.  Jennifer told her that she is so sorry about the way she treated her mom and she hoped that Barbara could hear her when she told her that she loves her.  Abigail told her she was sure that Barbara would be OK.  She said she knew how Jennifer felt, because she was in the same situation last year when Molly was in a coma.  After Adam and Bryant returned, he and Jennifer started to leave the rooftop and stopped to kiss as the fireworks began.  Adam looked at them kissing and then turned to Abigail and they kissed also.  Abigail smiled and took Adam's hand\n\n\nAl's Diner:\n\nJack, Parker and Carly were sitting at a booth.  Jack asked Carly if they were OK.  Carly said yes, everything was fine.\n\n\n",
