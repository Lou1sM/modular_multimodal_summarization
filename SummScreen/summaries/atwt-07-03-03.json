When Katie gets to the house, the doctor is leaving.  The doctor had brought Carly the results of Sage's paternity test.  Katie walks inside and sees Carly looking at a piece of paper.  Katie sees that Carly is not dressed and she reminds her that she is getting married in ten minutes.  Carly looks up at Katie with a very bewildered look on her face.  Katie asks what is wrong and Carly says, \"Nothing...everything.\"  Katie asks if the doctor did something to her and Carly holds up the paper and says that he brought her this.  Carly says that she needs to talk to Jack.  Katie asks if she is changing her mind.  Carly says that she still wants to marry Jack, but the timing is off.  Katie grabs Carly and says that she only has ten minutes to get ready.  Since Jack and Carly are having a Native American ceremony, she has to be ready when the moon rises.  Katie pushes her to get ready.  Carly goes into the back room to get ready.\n\n\nOut in the barn, Hanna, who is going to officiate the wedding, starts to worry about the timing of the wedding.  They must coordinate the ceremony with the rising of the moon.  Just at that moment, Katie walks into the barn and announces that Carly is ready to make her appearance.  Everyone takes their places.  Carly walks in and everyone looks at her adoringly.  Carly walks over to Parker and gives him a kiss.  Molly leans over and tells her cousin that she looks beautiful.  Carly whispers thank you and walks over to Jack.  Hanna starts the ceremony.  She is holding a feather and a small bowl of water.  Hanna walks around the couple and then does a figure eight around them.  She takes some of the water and sprinkles it on Jack's hands and then on Carly's hands.  She asks, \"Jack and Carly, why are you getting married?\"  Jack explains that in short he loves Carly and no matter what, they keep coming back to each other.  Carly tells Jack that he is her compass and he always points the right way home.  Then Hanna asks if anyone has a present for the couple or would anyone like to say anything.  Everyone looks around and then Craig stands up and says that he has something to say.  Everyone rolls their eyes and holds their breath.  Katie says, \"Craig, please don't ruin this wedding.\"  Jack tells Katie to let him speak.  Craig tells Jack and Carly that despite his efforts, they have prevailed.  He gives them his blessing and he thinks it may just be dumb luck that they are getting hitched again.  He says that they have his respect for their tenacity.  He pats Jack on the back and Jack thanks him.  Rosanna stands up and tells Craig that it is her turn and he can shut up now.  Rosanna gives her blessings and Katie and Molly and finally, Mike.  Oh yes, Parker says that he is ready for food.  So, they finish the ceremony and Parker reminds them it is time to eat.  Everyone is kissing the couple and wishing them good luck.  Carly whispers to Jack that she needs to talk to him.  Rosanna hears what Carly had said and scoots everyone out of the barn.  When Jack and Carly are alone, they walk over to Sage's cradle.  Jack gives Carly a necklace with his and her and Parker and Sage's birthstones on it.  Finally, Carly gets to say what she has to say to Jack.  She picks up Sage and tells Jack that Sage is his gift.  She looks at the baby and then at him.  She says, \"I think she looks a lot like her dad.\"  Jack says, \"Her dad?\"\n\n\nBarbara shows up at the police station to tell everyone that she has remembered something about where Lily and Rose may be.  She tells Margo, Holden and Dusty about when Paul was little and James had taken him away from her, James had taken Paul to a hunting lodge.  Barbara tells them that she doesn't know where the lodge is located.  Margo goes to work.  She thinks that she knows how to find the cabin.  Holden and Dusty take off with the radio to start driving in the vicinity that the women may be in.  Margo gets an idea and heads to the hospital.  After everyone leaves the station, Brackett knocks out his guard and puts on the policeman's uniform and puts his clothes on the policeman.  He slumps the man over the table like he is sleeping and then walks out of the police station.  \n\n\nWhen Margo gets to the hospital, she finds Susan and asks about the hunting lodge.  Susan tells her that they used to own it before James Stenbeck bought it.  Margo asks if Susan could find it on the map.  Susan says that she clearly remembers where it is.  Margo pulls out the map and Susan shows her where the lodge is located.  \n\n\nHolden and Dusty are driving around in the dark and Holden keeps trying the radio.  Nothing is happening and Holden starts to get frustrated.  Dusty says that they will find them and Holden says that he knows they will find them even if they have to dig up the whole forest.  Dusty tells him that is the Holden that he remembers.  Dusty says, \"Do you remember...\"  Holden stops him and tells him not to try to be chummy with him.  He tells Dusty that all of this is his fault.  And, he adds, that whatever the outcome, he will never forgive Dusty for it.  Holden's cell phone rings and it is Margo.  She tells Holden that she knows where the twins are.  \n\n\nIn the well, Rose tries to climb out, but when there is a sudden blast, she falls back into the well.  Lily revives her and Rose insists that she ok and wants to try again.  Lily begs her not to try it again.  Rose reminds her that she is a Jersey girl and nothing can stop her.  Rose promises to make it this time.  Rose starts to climb and one by one, barely holding on with her toes and fingers, she climbs to the top of the well.  She pulls herself out and she is so happy to get out.  She yells back down to Lily that she has made it.  Lily says, \"I knew you would.\"  Rose yells down to Lily to hang on and she is going to go for help.  Just as she starts to run off, Brackett shows up and grabs Rose.  He says, \"The hell you will.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara told Margo that James took Paul to the old Stewart farm when Paul was a boy. There was a hunting lodge nearby with a well, and James told Paul the \"Tommy Stout\" rhyme to keep him away. Margo talked to Susan, whose ex-husband, Dan, used to go to the lodge. Susan showed Margo how to find the lodge. Margo sent out search parties, which included Dusty and Holden as a team. Dusty tried to lighten the mood by reminiscing about old times, but Holden said he would never forgive him for endangering Lily and Rose. The fake Agent Brackett overtook a police officer, then donned his uniform and joined the search. Rose finally managed to climb out of the well, only to be grabbed at the top by \"Brackett.\" In Montana, Carly received the results of Sage's paternity test, but decided informing the daddy could wait until after the wedding. Craig wanted Rosanna to ask Mike about his intentions toward Katie, but she refused. Molly and Mike agreed to talk after the wedding. During the traditional Native American ceremony, Jack and Carly told the onlookers why they were getting married. Each guest then gave blessings to the couple. After the wedding, Jack gave Carly a necklace featuring his, Carly's, Parker's, and Sage's birthstones, symbolizing their new family unit. Just as Carly told Jack that Sage had her father's eyes, Katie read the results of the paternity test",
