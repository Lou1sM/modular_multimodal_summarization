The friend invited Noah to go with him to Yo's where singing star Cyndi Lauper was appearing in support of gay rights, and Noah agreed. \n\n\nAt Yo's, Luke approached Cyndi Lauper to interview her for the Oakdale University newspaper. On her \"True Colors 2008 Tour,\" Cyndi was promoting her new studio album, \"Bring Ya to the Brink,\" for gay rights. She asked Luke if he had a boyfriend, and Luke hedged. The two of them discussed Cyndi's support and interest in the cause. When Noah arrived, Luke explained that Noah was his ex-boyfriend. The interview concluded, and Cyndi offered to dedicate her show to Luke and Noah. \n\n\nAt the diner, Henry asked Mike to intervene again with Carly to see if he could persuade her to sell part of Metro to Henry. As Mike left, Vienna returned with outrageous 4th of July costumes. Henry dressed as George Washington and Vienna was an underdressed Miss Martha. Henry kept mumbling that his \"doodle was a dandy,\" and the two of them faded to black beneath the lunch counter. \n\n\nHolden moved back to his and Lily's house, although they were alone because the children were all away. Lily proposed they have a holiday cookout and called to invite Carly first. Carly declined, and lied, saying that Jack and Parker were home and they were also cooking. When Carly hung up, Mike arrived. He made his pitch for Henry, but Carly wanted all the work Metro produced so that she could keep busy. She invited Mike to stay a while and hang out, and then decided that it would be a less depressing day if she accepted Lily's earlier invitation. She called Lily, apologized for fibbing about Jack and Parker, and asked if she could still come and bring a friend. Holden was surprised that Carly was coming after all, and...bringing a \"date.\" \n\n\nLuke watched Noah and his friend as Cyndi Lauper performed \"Into the Night Life.\" Noah dashed out as soon as the number finished, but reappeared during the second song, \"True Colors.\" Noah sought out Luke and asked him to come outside for a talk. He told Luke that the two of them belonged together, and they kissed. \n\n\nCarly and Mike arrived at Lily and Holden's and stirred up feelings of jealousy in Holden. After dinner, they left rather abruptly, and Lily told her husband that she thought Carly did not seem herself. Holden stalled on initiating a romantic encounter with Lily and insisted that he needed to go to the store to get milk for breakfast the next morning. \n\n\nLuke and Noah approached Cyndi Lauper and she wished them well. Like said he could not believe that he and Noah were back together and invited Noah to spend the night with him at the deserted Snyder farm. Noah declined, and then reluctantly told Luke that he had enlisted in the Army and was leaving the next day. Luke was hurt, but Noah told his friend that he thought clear rules were what he needed. Luke tried to convince Noah not to go, but was unable to change Noah's mind. \n\n\nCarly was locking up when Holden appeared on her front porch. He told Carly that he wanted to see if Mike's car was still at her house. He confessed to being jealous, and Carly admitted having feelings for Holden, too. They almost kissed but were interrupted by Holden's cell phone. It was Lily, adding a few items to Holden's shopping list. Holden apologized to Carly and left.\n\n\n",
