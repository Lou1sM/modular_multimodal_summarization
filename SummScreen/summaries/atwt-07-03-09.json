    "soap_central": "\n\n \nEmily pleaded with Hunter not to leave town until she'd had a chance to talk to him. Hunter insisted there was nothing to keep him in Oakdale, but Emily blurted out, \"Hunter, I am your mother!\" Hunter was stunned that Emily would say something so outrageous to try to get him to stay in Oakdale. Emily protested that she was telling the truth. Hunter stated that his mother had just died. Emily said she knew that Aurora Hunter had died, and that Aurora had raised Hunter, but Emily insisted that she was actually Hunter's mother.\n\n\nEmily explained to Hunter that several of her eggs had been fertilized when she had made it possible for Susan to have Alison, and that she had recently learned that the rest of the fertilized eggs had been transferred to the University of Chicago. Emily told Hunter that his mother, Aurora, must have been implanted with one of Emily's fertilized eggs. Hunter still didn't believe Emily, but Emily pointed out that there was no reason for her to lie about the matter.\n\n\nEmily told Hunter that since his mother had been older when she had him, Aurora might have needed to use an artificial means of conceiving a child, and that since Aurora had known Larry, she could have had access to Emily's eggs. Hunter asked what made Emily think his mother had known Larry, and Emily said Larry had admitted it to her after she had found a money clip that Aurora had given to Larry, engraved, \"To Tristan from Isolde.\" Hunter said that was his mother's favorite opera, and Emily replied that it was Larry's, as well. Hunter remarked that his mother had called him Tristan when he had visited her after her stroke, and that she had told him she would keep his secret forever. Hunter said that putting \"Tristan Wagner\" on his birth certificate had apparently been his mother and Larry's idea of a joke.\n\n\nHunter asked Emily if she had any proof of her story. Emily showed him the preliminary DNA report she had ordered, and he glanced at it and acknowledged that it revealed that Emily was his mother. Emily said that meant that Hunter did have family in Oakdale, because it meant that Susan was his grandmother, and Emily's son, Daniel, was Hunter's half-brother. Hunter asked if that meant that Alison was his half-sister, but Emily said that Alison was his full sister, because they had the same mother and father. Hunter looked ill and said, \"I've got to get out of here!\"\n\n\nAlison went to Worldwide to look for Hunter but ran into her father instead. Larry said he was trying to find Emily, to clear up a \"misunderstanding\" they'd had previously, but he assured Alison that it had nothing to do with her. Alison told Larry that she was looking for Hunter, because he wasn't answering his cell phone. Alison explained that she had been with Hunter in his room, and something upsetting had happened. Larry grew concerned and asked, \"Exactly what happened between you and Hunter?\"\n\n\nAlison summarized for Larry what had happened after her fight with Casey, and she ended by saying that Hunter had kissed her. Larry asked if kissing was all they had done; Alison replied that it might have gone further if she hadn't stopped it. Larry breathed a sigh of relief, and Alison asked if it would have been so terrible if she hadn't stopped it. Larry replied, \"Yes, Alison, it would.\"\n\n\nAlison told her father that things had gotten weird between her and Hunter, and she wanted to find Hunter to fix it. Larry said he had a better idea, and he proposed that Alison take a break from Casey and Hunter-and Oakdale-by moving to Chicago to live with him for a while. Larry said that if Alison moved to Chicago, it would give them more time to really get to know one another. Alison pointed out that she had a job in Oakdale, but Larry said there were plenty of jobs for nurses in Chicago. He asked Alison to at least think about his offer, and Alison said she would.\n\n\nEmily walked in and asked what Larry and Alison were doing there. Alison explained that she had been looking for Hunter and that Larry had been looking for Emily. Emily asked whether Alison had found Hunter, but Alison said she hadn't. Emily said that she wanted to finish her conversation with Hunter, and she asked Alison to let Hunter know that if she found him. Alison said she would, and then she left. Emily asked Larry, \"Did you tell her?\" Larry said, \"Tell her what?\" but Emily responded, \"Don't you dare play innocent with me, Larry.\"\n\n\nEmily told Larry that she'd had a DNA test run that had determined who Hunter's biological parents were. Larry replied that Emily couldn't have done that without samples from everyone involved, but Emily assured him that she'd gotten the samples she needed, and the test was accurate. Emily pointed out that the only way that could have happened was if Larry had given Aurora the eggs, and then Emily realized that Larry would have still been married to Susan at that time.\n\n\nLarry said that he had simply been trying to help a woman who desperately wanted to have a child, and Emily asked if Larry was referring to Aurora or Susan. Larry said that since Aurora was dead, none of it mattered anymore, and he wanted to let it remain a secret, but Emily said it was too late for that. Larry tried to justify what he had done by telling Emily that he'd fallen in love with a beautiful woman and had done things he never would have done otherwise. He said that afterward, he hadn't been able to face what he'd done, because he'd been ashamed. Emily told Larry that some things never changed, because he was not only a cheat, he was also a coward.\n\n\nHunter went to Java to get a latte to take with him on the bus ride out of town. Alison walked in and touched Hunter on the shoulder. He turned and saw her and cringed, saying, \"Don't touch me. Don't ever touch me!\" Alison asked what Hunter was doing, and he told her he was leaving town. She asked if he was leaving because of her, and he replied, \"Sort of, now that I know we can never be together, ever.\" Alison said that wasn't necessarily true, but Hunter insisted that it was. Hunter told Alison that he should never have let himself think of the things he had thought about her, because those were things you couldn't do with your sister. Alison asked him what he was talking about.\n\n\nAfter Hunter explained the situation to Alison, Alison was stunned, but she told Hunter that he should stay in Oakdale. Alison thought perhaps their situation explained the \"connection\" that Hunter had felt to her, but Hunter said that what he felt for her had nothing to do with genetics. He told Alison that he loved her and that a fluke of biology couldn't change that. Alison said they should just be grateful that nothing had happened between them and leave it at that, but Hunter said he couldn't, and he walked out of Java.\n\n\nAlison went to Worldwide to talk to Emily. She told Emily that Hunter had told her everything, and Emily told Alison how sorry she was that Alison had to find out like that. Alison said that she was glad that things hadn't gone any further with Hunter, because Hunter thought he was in love with her. Emily was horrified to hear that and asked where Hunter was. Alison informed her that Hunter had left town. Emily was upset that Alison hadn't stopped him; Alison said that she had tried, but Hunter had been determined to leave. Emily said sadly, \"I was so desperate to have another child, and it turns out I already had one, and now he's gone.\"\n\n\nAt Carly's, Carly gazed longingly at the bottle of champagne in the kitchen, but Craig walked in and offered to get it out of her way. He began to pour the champagne down the sink. Rosanna walked in and asked why Craig was throwing away perfectly good champagne. She wondered whether it was because she hadn't been able to afford really good champagne, but Craig told her that wasn't the case. Rosanna wasn't convinced, but Carly changed the subject to her wedding, saying she still had lots to do.\n\n\nCarly said that she still needed to finish her own dress and design something for both Rosanna and Sage to wear. Craig asked Rosanna if she would mind if Carly didn't design her dress, to alleviate some of the pressure on Carly. Rosanna said that whatever Carly wanted to do was fine with her. Craig suggested that Carly concentrate on finishing her own dress. Rosanna looked at the couple quizzically and asked what was going on with them. Carly wondered what Rosanna meant, and Rosanna asked, \"Since when do you let Craig tell you what to do?\"\n\n\nCraig joked that he had replaced Carly with a more subservient model, but Rosanna didn't find that to be funny. Carly tried to reassure Rosanna that she was fine, but Rosanna appeared unconvinced. Parker entered the room and announced that he had nothing to wear to the wedding. Rosanna said that if someone would give her some money, she would take Parker out shopping, and they would both buy something for the wedding. Craig gave Rosanna some cash, and Rosanna and Parker left.\n\n\nCraig asked Carly if things were really okay between them. Carly said that everything had been moving very fast, and Craig pointed out that was because Carly had wanted to move up the wedding. Carly said that maybe they should rethink it, but Craig said he had decided that Carly was right, because the less time there was to plan, the less time there was to worry about it.\n\n\nCraig told Carly that his only goal, besides putting a ring on her finger, was to make sure that she didn't put too much pressure on herself. He informed Carly that he meant to take care of her and pamper her and love her until she was old and gray and still beautiful, and he wanted her wedding day to be one of the happiest days of her life. Carly wasn't sure she could do that, but Craig said Carly could do anything she put her mind to.\n\n\nAt the farm, Sage told Jack and Janet that she had decided she wanted to go to summer camp, after all, and she had spoken with a camp counselor who had told her that there was one spot still available in the \"Blueberry Brigade.\" The bus for camp was scheduled to depart the next day, and Sage wanted to know if she could go. Jack pointed out that if Sage left the next day, she would miss her mother's wedding. Sage said she knew that. Jack told Sage that he would have to talk to Carly before he could agree to Sage's request. Sage became upset, saying that her mom would say \"no,\" which meant that Sage wouldn't get what she wanted.\n\n\nSage left the room, and Jack asked Janet what that was all about. Janet said it was about Sage not wanting to go to her mother's wedding. Jack said that Carly would flip out when she heard that, but Janet suggested Jack pay more attention to his daughter's feelings than to his ex-wife's feelings.\n\n\nJack and Janet took Sage and went to Carly's house to explain the situation to her. When Carly answered the door, Jack told her about Sage's desire to go to Camp Idlewild the following day. Carly said Sage couldn't do that because she would miss the wedding. Carly then asked Jack if it had been his idea, but Sage told Carly that she did want to go to the camp and that it had all been her own idea.\n\n\nCarly still didn't believe that her own daughter would choose to not attend her wedding, and she angrily yelled that Jack had put Sage up to it because he'd been against the wedding from the start. Janet said that wasn't true, that Jack would never use his children as weapons and that he had tried to convince Sage to stay and be in the wedding. Craig moved to stand by Carly and said Jack apparently hadn't tried hard enough. Janet said if Carly really wanted to know why Sage didn't want to go to the wedding, she should look in the mirror. Carly shouted at Janet to shut up, saying, \"This is my child. You don't tell me what she wants!\"\n\n\nCraig interceded, saying none of that was helping and that maybe they could work something out. He suggested that he and Carly could have a big reception at the end of summer after Sage returned from camp, but Carly shouted that she'd be damned if she would get married without her daughter present. Jack said he didn't see the sense in forcing Sage to go to the wedding if she really didn't want to go, and Carly then yelled at Sage, \"Fine, don't come! Go off to Camp Whoopdeedoo, I don't give a damn!\"\n\n\nSage ran from the room, and Jack asked Carly how she could treat Sage that way. Carly asked about how Sage was treating her, but Jack pointed out that Carly was an adult and should have acted more like a parent and less like a child. Craig told Jack that maybe planning for the wedding had put Carly under more pressure that she'd realized, and Jack suggested that in that case, perhaps Carly should not be getting married.\n\n\nRosanna and Parker walked in, and Rosanna asked what was going on. Carly told Rosanna that Jack was trying to turn her own kids against her. Rosanna said she was sure that wasn't true, but Carly asked if Rosanna was against her, too, because she hadn't wanted Carly to marry Craig, either. Rosanna told Carly that wasn't true, that she had given Carly her blessing. Janet piped up and said that no one wanted Carly to get married more than Janet did.\n\n\nCarly snapped at Janet, and Craig told Carly that perhaps she was blowing things out of proportion and should take a step back. Carly asked if Craig was turning on her, too, but Craig said he would never do that. Carly then said, \"Okay, fine, the wedding's off then.\" She said she hoped they were all happy, but she couldn't stand to look at any of them, so she was leaving. She grabbed her purse and keys and walked out. Craig turned to Jack and said he thought it would probably be best if Jack and Janet left, while he went after Carly to make sure she was okay.\n\n\nCraig found Carly, and they walked before returning to her house. Craig assured Carly that Sage loved her and would forgive her, but Carly said she didn't deserve to be forgiven. Craig said that if Carly truly felt that way, perhaps she should talk to someone. Carly asked if Craig meant a therapist, and he said therapy could be a good thing, but Carly said she didn't need it.\n\n\nSage opened the door and walked out, and Carly told Sage how sorry she was for having yelled at her. Craig quietly slipped back inside, while Sage also apologized to her mom. Carly told Sage that she'd been upset because Sage hadn't wanted to go to the wedding. Sage replied that if it meant that much to her mom, she would go. Carly suggested that they call the camp to explain the situation and make arrangements to drive Sage to the camp after the wedding. Sage agreed to that, and they hugged.\n\n\nSage went back inside, and Carly walked over to her rose bush and retrieved a bottle of vodka she had hidden there. She took a swallow before going back inside. Carly told Rosanna that she had been stressed more than she had realized by pushing up the date of the wedding, but she was feeling better. She then said she needed to call Jack to apologize, which she proceeded to do. Carly explained to Jack that she and Sage had agreed that Sage would stay for the wedding, and Craig and Carly would drive Sage to camp the day after. Carly then asked if Jack and Janet would attend the wedding, because she thought Sage would feel more comfortable if Jack were there. Jack reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nCarly told Rosanna and Craig that she had to go upstairs to work on her dress. Rosanna couldn't believe that Carly was suddenly fine, when she had freaked out and yelled at her daughter just moments before. Carly said that she had apologized for that. Rosanna replied that she didn't want Carly to apologize; she wanted Carly to start acting like herself again. Carly said she would, after the wedding. Carly then said she'd left her jacket outside, so she went back out again.\n\n\nRosanna looked at Craig and asked him why he was buying Carly's sudden change of attitude and emotion. Craig said he loved Carly and believed her, but Rosanna was still suspicious. Carly walked back in, with her bottle of vodka hidden under her jacket, and told them she was going upstairs to work and didn't want to be disturbed. Craig announced that he was going back to the Lakeview for the night, and Carly blew him a kiss and went upstairs. Rosanna turned to Craig and said, \"You've got to tell me what's going on.\" Craig looked at Rosanna and replied, \"Let it go, Rosanna. All's well that ends well.\"\n\n\n",
