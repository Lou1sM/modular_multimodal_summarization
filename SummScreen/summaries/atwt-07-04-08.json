Katie told Jack that WOAK had been robbed, and several video cameras had been stolen. Janet went with Jack to WOAK, where Brad took Janet aside and asked what she was doing with Jack. Janet apologized to Brad for having made a fool of herself the last time she saw him, but Brad assured her she hadn't. Janet said Jack had helped her get a different perspective on Brad, and she was grateful for that. Katie got Janet alone and told her she knew about Janet and Brad's kiss, because Brad had told her. Janet said that Katie probably also knew that Brad had made it perfectly clear that Janet had no chance with him. Katie agreed and said Janet needed to leave high school behind, once and for all. \n\n\nBrad asked Jack what he was doing with Janet, and Jack said he was just trying to help her get past her embarrassment so that things could get back to normal between Janet, Brad, and Katie. Brad agreed that needed to happen, for Liberty's sake. Jack told Brad he thought Brad was more worried that Jack and Janet were friends than anything else. Brad asked if that was all they were; Jack said goodbye without answering Brad's question. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker went to Brad and Katie's house, where Liberty expected Parker to once again do her math homework for her. She told Parker they could spend the rest of the day together if he finished the homework quickly. Parker asked Liberty if she'd gotten into any trouble with her mother after their kiss, but Liberty said Janet had never even mentioned it, which meant it was not a big deal. Dylan came to the door and invited Liberty to join him in watching the town parade. He showed her a fancy video camera, and Parker asked where Dylan had gotten it, saying it looked professional. Dylan told Parker it was none of his business, and then he told Liberty to ditch Parker so they could leave. Liberty invited Parker to join her and Dylan, but Parker said he had things to do. As Parker left, he heard Dylan telling Liberty that she shouldn't hang around with Parker because Parker was \"just a kid.\" \n\n\nHolden and Paul were both at Fairwinds, making phone calls to try to locate Meg, who had not been heard from in more than 24 hours. Meg walked in just as Holden was demanding that Paul tell him what had been going on. Paul told Meg and Holden that he wanted Meg to know that he had tried to find her to talk to her, in order to tell her some \"disturbing\" news, but Meg had found out about it before Paul could talk to her. Holden was confused, so Meg told him that she had learned that Sofie was pregnant with Paul's child. Meg said she had also learned that Paul had known about it for a while but hadn't told her, despite his claim to love her. Paul said that because Sofie was a liar, he had wanted to make sure she was really pregnant and that the baby was really his. Holden told Meg he would take her back to the farm, and he told Paul if he loved Meg, he would leave her alone. \n\n\nAt the farm, Holden told Meg she had really worried him when she disappeared. Meg apologized. Holden told Meg she needed to be through with Paul for good, because Paul caused her too much pain and because there was no way of knowing what Sofie's baby would mean to Paul or to his relationship with Meg. Meg told Holden she didn't want to talk because she was tired, and she went upstairs to take a bath. \n\n\nPaul surprised Meg by showing up in the bathroom while she was in the tub. He told her he had taken care of Sofie and that Sofie wouldn't bother them any more. Meg said Sofie was having Paul's baby, so she wasn't going to just go away. Paul told Meg she didn't have to keep pretending, because Sofie hadn't been dead yet when he found her in the hotel, and she had told him Meg had been there. Meg asked what Paul was talking about, and Paul said Sofie told him Meg had injected her and left her for dead. Meg said she'd done no such thing, and she couldn't believe Paul would think she could kill a pregnant woman. \n\n\nPaul said he hadn't known what else to think, so he had destroyed the sonogram and buried Sofie in the garden. Meg was horrified and said she would call Jack. Paul said the police would think he had killed Sofie if Meg told them what had happened. He explained that he had just been trying to protect Meg because he loved her. Meg wished Paul hadn't done anything, but Paul said that even though he wasn't happy Sofie was dead, he was relieved in a way because it meant he and Meg could get on with their lives. \n\n\nDownstairs, Luke walked into the kitchen, and Holden told him Meg was upstairs and that she was upset about Paul. Holden said he didn't know why Meg kept going back to Paul. Luke said sometimes people went back to the ones who hurt them because they loved them. Holden asked what was going on with Noah, and Luke told him about Noah's plan to enlist in the Army. He asked how he could let Noah do something like that to himself, and Holden said he couldn't. Holden told Luke he should talk to Noah again if he really felt Noah was enlisting for all the wrong reasons, because it wasn't right to let someone you loved walk to the end of a cliff and throw themselves off of it. Luke thanked his dad and left to try to find Noah. \n\n\nMeg got dressed and went downstairs with Paul. Holden was furious that Paul had gotten into the house uninvited and that Meg was leaving with him. Holden wondered what Sofie was supposed to do, but Meg said she didn't want to talk about it and that she and Paul would take care of Sofie. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview Hotel, Lisa ran into Barbara and told her she had apparently gotten her wish: Sofie had disappeared. Barbara was surprised but told Lisa that it probably wasn't the first time Sofie had to disappear, because Sofie was a manipulative young woman. Lisa followed Barbara to her suite and asked her exactly what she had said to scare Sofie so badly and whether she had carried out any threats she might have made. Lisa said she knew better than most people that Barbara loved her children and would do anything to protect them. Barbara told Lisa she wanted her to leave. Lisa later returned with a peace offering and told Barbara she hadn't meant to imply that she thought Barbara was a cold-blooded killer. Lisa said they should both be happy that Sofie had apparently left town on her own. \n\n\nIn front of Al's Diner, Dylan filmed Liberty talking about the Fourth of July. Liberty asked if Dylan had any money so they could get something to eat, and Dylan said he did and that he could get plenty more. Meanwhile, Jack ran into Parker sitting on a bench in Old Town, and Parker asked what Jack was doing. Jack told Parker about the stolen video cameras and noticed Parker's reaction to the news. He asked if Parker knew anything about the theft; Parker said no, and he got up and walked away. Jack followed him into Java and asked if there was anything Parker wanted to tell him. Parker said no again, and when Jack said it had seemed as though Parker might know something about the stolen video cameras, Parker said he didn't. \n\n\nJanet walked through Old Town and came across Dylan, who was trying to sell the video camera to a man who left after telling Dylan he thought Dylan was dealing in stolen goods. Liberty came back from getting some food and asked Dylan what the man had wanted. Dylan told her the man had been asking about Dylan's camera. Dylan and Liberty walked away to watch the parade. Worried, Janet found Jack outside Java and told him what she had seen and heard. Janet was concerned because Liberty and Dylan had been hanging around together most of the day, but she was positive Liberty didn't know anything about the theft. Jack assured Janet that Liberty would be okay, and he went to find Dylan to question him about the camera. \n\n\nJack found Liberty and Dylan sitting together. He went back into Java and told Parker he needed his help in getting Liberty away from Dylan. Jack said he thought Parker already knew why and that he was trying to keep Liberty out of trouble. Parker thanked Jack and went and told Liberty he needed to speak to her privately right away. Liberty went with him and then turned to see Jack confronting Dylan about the video camera. Jack had an officer take Dylan in for questioning. Liberty accused Parker of being a rat and turning Dylan in to his dad. Parker said he hadn't done that but that he knew Liberty wouldn't believe him because he was \"just a kid.\" \n\n\nParker walked away, and Jack took Liberty by the arm and escorted her into Al's, where Janet was waiting. Liberty told Janet and Jack that she'd known nothing about the stolen camera, and Jack said that was good, because the camera was expensive enough that it was grand larceny to steal one. Brad and Katie came in, and Brad jumped on Liberty for being out with her \"thief friend\" instead of home studying. Brad told Liberty that for disobeying him, she was grounded. Jack asked Brad to ease up, but Brad angrily told Jack not to tell him how to raise his kid. \n\n\nKatie asked Jack if Liberty had known anything about the stolen camera, and Jack said she hadn't, which was what he'd been trying to tell Brad. Jack said Janet had been the one who had figured out Dylan had stolen the camera. Janet explained what had happened, and Liberty asked Jack if that meant Parker hadn't said anything to him. Jack said Parker had refused to talk to him about it. Jack and Janet left. Brad apologized to Liberty for overreacting and asked if Liberty wanted to join them to watch the fireworks; Liberty said she was going to go back home and finish her homework. \n\n\nParker went to Brad's house and gave Liberty the address of a math Web site, saying he figured she wouldn't want a rat to be her tutor. Liberty stopped Parker from leaving, telling him she knew he hadn't done anything wrong. Parker told Liberty he wasn't going to do her homework for her anymore and that he'd never liked doing it in the first place. Liberty asked why he had done it, and Parker replied that he had wanted to be around her. Liberty said that was \"a really good answer,\" and she kissed him. \n\n\nJanet talked Jack into taking the picnic back to her hotel room, where she said they could watch the fireworks from her windows. They ate and talked, and then Janet noticed Jack's neck seemed to be hurting him. She massaged it for him and then asked him when was the last time he'd had outstanding, mind-blowing sex. Jack was astonished by the question. Janet said she was just asking. Jack asked if she was asking or proposing. Janet replied that of course, she was also proposing, because Jack was very attractive, and it would be fun. Jack said Janet was very sexy and attractive. Janet said Jack always had to say \"no\" because he couldn't let himself have fun. She pointed out that he had finally said \"yes\" to the picnic, and he could imagine what would happen if he agreed to her proposal. Janet said she was done talking, and she kissed Jack. She asked him afterward, \"So, what do you say?\" Jack looked at her and replied, \"Hell, yeah!\" and kissed her. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Katie massaged Brad's neck and asked why he let Jack get to him so much. Brad said Jack was trying to take his family away from him, but Katie pointed out that Janet wasn't Brad's family, Jack couldn't take Liberty away from him, and Katie was his family, too. Katie said if Brad insisted on having a competition with Jack, he should realize that he was the one who'd ended up with Katie. Brad sat Katie down on his lap and told her she was right and that she was quite a prize. \n\n\nAs the fireworks went off over Oakdale, Jack and Janet kissed, Parker and Liberty kissed, Katie and Brad kissed, and Paul hugged Meg while she asked him where he had buried Sofie.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Parker helps Liberty with her homework. A friend stops by with a new video camera and whisks Liberty off to the parade, after teasing and calling Parker a geek kid. Janet sweet talks Jack into celebrating as she has fresh, warm apple pie. Jack gets called by Katie about some stolen cameras at WOAK and he and Janet dash off. Brad doesn't want Jack arranging his life for him. Katie tells Janet that her life became very complicated when Liberty and then Janet showed up. But it's time to grow up and leave high school behind and lead her own life. Janet confides to Jack that she saw a friend of Liberty's with a camera and she thinks it might be one of the stolen ones, and Liberty has no idea what is happening. Lisa tells Barbara that she got her wish, Sofie is gone. There are several scenarios, but is Barbara involved? Holden won't let it drop and insists Paul knows something about Sofie. Paul swears to Meg that he would not have married her without telling her the truth about Sofie. Holden hustles Meg back to the farm. Both she and Paul think the other is Sofie's killer. Jack tells Parker that he needs his help. Get Liberty away from her friend, Dillon. He stole the camera and Jack wants to keep her out of any trouble. Brad is furious at Liberty for staying at home as promised and is resentful of Jack trying to intercede and tell him how to raise his kid. Liberty has some major explaining and apologizing to Parker when she finds out it was Janet that fingered Dillon. Janet drags Jack and the picnic basket back to her hotel room to watch the parade and eat apple pie. Luke reveals to Holden that his boyfriend enlisted in the Army without telling him, denying who he is. Holden advises him to go to Noah and perhaps talk him out of this if he is doing it for the wrong reasons. Janet shocks Jack when she asks him when is the last time he had sex, good old fashioned, mind- blowing, uncomplicated sex? The last time he said yes, he got pie. Just think what he might get now. She lays a big kiss on him and they start ripping off each other's clothes.",
