She found a switch that turned on a dim light, but the only door she found was locked.  \"How the hell did I get here?\" Barbara mumbled, as she found the handkerchief with chloroform that had drugged her.  She began looking around and discovered all sorts of party supplies and favors.  She pounded on the door and screamed for help, and eventually blew on party horns and banged on the door with the heel of her shoe.  Eventually she lit some big numbered birthday candles, and she said to the clown, \"One crack about my age, Chuckles, and you're going down.\"\n\n\nBarbara was thirsty, but she found some juice boxes, so she helped herself.  She also began a one-sided conversation with the clown, and she asked him if he had seen who had dropped her off there.  Barbara looked around for clues and finally picked up the lacy handkerchief that reeked of the chemical.  \"Definitely a woman,\" she said.  Then she drank some flavored candy water that made her gag, so she turned to Chuckles and said, \"Which one of those bitches left me here with you to rot?\"  Her first thought was that it was Vienna, since Barbara had called her bluff about the pregnancy.\n\n\nBarbara visualized Vienna's grabbing her from behind and putting the chloroformed handkerchief over her face.  Then she began eating some of the party candy, and she had second thoughts about Vienna's complicity in her kidnapping.  Barbara reasoned that Vienna's sidekick, Katie, was even more likely to be the perpetrator, so he imagined that scene.  She trash-talked about Katie to the clown for a while, and she held his hand.  On a sugar high, Barbara confided to Chuckles that Katie was way too \"white bread\" to use chloroform.  That was hard-core stuff, and whoever had put her in the warehouse really hated her.\n\n\n\"Of course!\" shrieked Barbara; it was Emily!  She imagined Emily's sneaking up on her and calling her \"monster-in-law\" as she held the handkerchief over Barbara's face.  Barbara was most worried by the thought that perhaps Paul had helped his wife, and she called Emily \"a cannibal\" who ate people alive.  She began to cry and wailed that she hoped she didn't end up in a padded cell with Meg.\n\n\nIn Al's Diner, the minister asked Henry to place the ring on Vienna's finger, but Henry had consumed quite a bit of champagne and had trouble saying the proper words.  Then Vienna put her ring on Henry's finger, and it was time for their vows.  After each had said, \"I do,\" Vienna stopped the ceremony and said she had written something she wanted to share.  She pulled out a piece of paper, and Paul took one look and moaned, \"It's single spaced.\"  He was just hoping to get Henry through the formalities before the groom passed out.  Vienna began her speech about love and forgiveness, as she promised to be the best wife she could.\n\n\nIn the audience, Chris asked Katie how Henry could be okay with what Vienna had done by faking her pregnancy.  Katie, who was also under the impression that Vienna had kept her promise and confessed everything to Henry, didn't understand either.   Henry had nothing prepared to say, but Paul reminded him that it was \"man up\" time.  Henry stumbled around with his words and finally got on track by mentioning the baby and all it meant to him.  Katie suddenly realized that Vienna had not told Henry any of the truth, as the groom promised to spend his life making his little family proud.  The minister pronounced the couple husband and wife.\n\n\nEmily congratulated Henry, but the other men were wondering why Barbara had not shown up to stop the wedding.  Emily said they should just be happy that Barbara was gone.  Katie waited impatiently for Bob to stop hugging Vienna so that she could chew out the bride for not doing what she had promised.  Finally Katie got her chance and asked for a private moment with the bride.  Vienna resisted until Katie threatened to say her piece in front of everyone.  The two of them went to the other side of the diner, where Katie challenged Vienna.  Henry joined them unexpectedly, so Vienna improvised and told him a whopper about getting \"cold feet\" earlier in the day, and she said she had needed to share that with him.\n\n\nKatie made some sarcastic remarks, so Vienna told Henry that she wanted to make sure that he had not married her just because she was pregnant with his child.  She said that earlier in the day she had gone to church to pray to Santa Lucia, who had said that once she and Henry were married it wouldn't matter how they had gotten there.  Vienna turned to Katie and gave her a nasty look and said, \"Amen.\"  Katie said Vienna should be ashamed of herself, and she began to lecture the bride until Chris jumped in and dragged Katie away.  She discussed how angry she was that Vienna had \"tricked\" Henry into marriage, but Chris reminded her that the marriage was a done deal, and what was important was what happened next.\n\n\nKim was very concerned that no one had heard from Barbara, but Emily attempted to talk her out of trying to reach Barbara by phone.  Kim said that wherever her niece was, she was miserable and humiliated.\n\n\nHenry spotted Vienna drinking milk from a champagne flute, and he saw her pour in a powdered substance.  They were the fertility herbs from Dr. Ming, but Vienna called them an \"old Swedish anti-nausea powder for pregnant women.\" Paul declared that he was going to make a toast, and he saluted the bride and groom and wished them a long and happy life, together with their child.  Katie couldn't stand it, so she stepped away, and Kim followed her.  She suggested that Katie not let the bad things that had happened to her keep her from passing up some wonderful possibilities.  Vienna threw her bouquet, and it was a foregone conclusion that Katie, the only single woman there, would catch it.  The flowers only depressed Katie more, so she hugged Henry and left with Chris.\n\n\nChris took Katie home, but she did not invite him in.  She closed the door and took a long look at her wedding ring.  She tired to take it off, but it stuck.\n\n\nEmily and Paul went to Fairwinds and relaxed on the couch for a few minutes.  Emily went upstairs to get ready for bed, and Paul called his mother and left her a message.  He invited her to lunch the next day and said she had done the right thing by staying away.  Paul said he was proud of Barbara and asked her to call him.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna went up to their room, and Henry insisted on carrying his bride over the threshold.  Vienna got into bed, but she was wearing her baby bump under her nightgown.  Henry started to join her, but Vienna asked him to give her another minute.  She untied the bump and stashed it under her side of the bed.  She also turned out the lights, and then Henry joined her.  Vienna snuggled up to him, as a very somber Henry stared into the darkness.\n\n\n",
