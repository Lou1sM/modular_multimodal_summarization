As they talk, Lance, the porno producer, walks in and sees them, but they don't see him. The women go to the powder room together, and Dusty tells Aaron he's glad he's getting back with Alison. Susan tells Emily and Alison that she's happy they're both doing so much better, and she says she must have done something right to make them want to take care of one another like they have. Susan leaves to go to the hospital to check on a patient, and Alison and Aaron leave to go back to Susan's place, while Dusty and Emily stay and discuss the luncheon. Emily tells Dusty she's afraid she'll ruin their relationship before it really gets off the ground, but Dusty says he's nervous about the relationship, too. He says trusting anyone is major for him, but she's worth it. Emily says she's ready to see where this takes them, and they already have her mom's approval, for which Dusty says he deserves a reward. When Emily asks what he's angling for, he says, \"Something we've never done before,\" and they kiss.\n\n\nBack at Susan's, Susan walks in on Aaron and Ali kissing and says it brings back memories from their high school days. She leaves to go back to the hospital, and Aaron says they should rent movies and eat popcorn like they used to do in high school, so he leaves to go to the video store. On his way out of the store, he runs into his dad; Holden expresses concern that Aaron and Alison are getting back together, because all of her life, Alison has lied to Aaron. Aaron insists that Alison isn't lying to him any more, and he leaves to go back to Susan's. \n\n\nAs soon as Aaron has walked out of Susan's house to go to the video store, Lance shows up, and he forces his way in past Alison and tells her he can't forget her because she has scarred him for life, on his cheek, and now the \"other girls\" don't trust him. He tells Alison he needs her to go back to Vegas with him so the other girls will work with him again, and he says she owes him one more movie. Alison says Lance has nothing to hold over her head now, because everyone in her life knows everything that happened to her, but Lance says he doubts they know every detail. As Alison tries to call the police, Lance grabs her, but Aaron walks in at that moment and knocks Lance out with a punch.\n\n\nIn Branson, Missouri, Noah is having lunch unexpectedly with his dad, who says he's upset that Noah didn't let him know he'd be in the area. He tells Noah that what he's doing, as an intern for WOAK, isn't really work, and he has decided not to pay for Noah's tuition at Northwestern because he doesn't think the entertainment industry is the type of career Noah should have. He says everyone in their family has enlisted in the military for generations past, and he tells Noah to enlist in the Army, saying maybe they can \"make a man out of you,\" and they'll talk about college after he's served there.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Maddie tries to call Casey but is told that Casey has asked to have her calls blocked. Stunned, Maddie dissolves into tears, and Noah walks in and finds her upset. She tells him what's happened, and Noah takes out his anger at his dad on Casey, saying he has no right to try to run her life and not respect what she wants to do. Maddie realizes something's bothering Noah, too, and he decides the best thing to do is go out and blow off some steam at the water park. They have fun there, then return to the hotel, where Maddie showers and then finds Noah still obviously upset. Noah tells her about his dad's insistence that he join the Army and his disgust with the entertainment industry, likening it to Casey's attempts to control Maddie's life for her by cutting her off from talking to him. He tells her he feels like the bottom has just fallen out of his future. In their mutual sympathy, they hug, and then they kiss, and then they fall into bed together. \n\n\nWill calls Gwen from Silver Dollar City, an attraction in Branson, and finds out that she might have time before the show, so he says they'll head back to the hotel. However, when they get there, they find that Gwen has a pre-show reception she didn't know about previously. Gwen tries to convince Will to go to the reception with her, but he says he'll skip that and just be there for the show itself. He and Cleo leave to see some more sites, and Cleo takes Will to a wooded area, where she finds a bench for them to sit on and talk. Cleo is still carrying the gnome that Will bought for her, and she says she wants to name it Bashful, then she suddenly kisses Will, who pushes her away. Cleo tells him, \"It's okay, because I love you!\" Will is shocked and disgusted, saying he loves Gwen, but Cleo says Gwen doesn't make him happy, while she does. She says it's like pistachio ice cream mixed with sprinkles, and Will says, \"That's what Jade said you wrote in your diary!\" Cleo says she made sure Jade would be arrested and have to go to prison, to keep her out of Will's life, and Will realizes that means Cleo's the one who ran him off the road. When he tells her she could have killed him, she says she's a good driver and made sure he was okay before she left the accident scene. Will says he'll go to the cops and have Cleo arrested, saying she's nothing to him and never will be, but Cleo runs up behind him as he leaves and knocks him out with a blow to the head, using the gnome as her weapon.\n\n\nLuke and Jade arrive in Branson but don't have a working cell phone between them (Jade left hers at the Snyder farm, and Luke's battery needs to be recharged). They wander around trying to find out where Gwen might be and then see a poster advertising her appearance at Andy Williams' Moon River Theater, so they go there. When they get there, they don't find Gwen or Will, so Jade sends Luke to the hotel to see if they're there. After Luke leaves, Gwen walks in, and Jade tries to convince her that Will might be in danger from Cleo. Meanwhile, Luke bursts into what he thinks is Will and Gwen's room at the hotel, only to find Noah and Maddie in bed together.\n\n\n\n\n",
