    "soap_central": "\n\nLiberty startled Janet in Emma's kitchen, as her mother cleaned the same spot over and over and was lost in her own thoughts.  Janet sent Liberty outside to weed Emma's garden, but the girl's phone rang.  Her caller was Gabriel, who was in Old Town hunting for a job.  They talked until Liberty hung up, laughing.  Inside the house, Jack startled Janet as well, so she made him pay by giving her a back massage.  Jack said he thought Janet and her little family ought to have a house of their own on the Snyder property, and he showed her a photo of a cabin on the farm where Emma stored some of her things.\n\n\nJanet told Jack that she didn't want him spending his time and money on a place she might not live in for long.  Liberty walked back in and declared that the fixed-up cabin idea was great, and she knew the perfect person to help with the job: Gabriel.  Janet was overwhelmed by the conversation, so she bailed on the discussion to do laundry.  Jack was not enthralled with hiring Gabriel, but Liberty pleaded his case.\n\n\nJanet finished her laundry and carried it into the kitchen to sort, as Dusty knocked at the door.  Janet admitted that she had been thinking about him, and Dusty said he was miserable without her.  He also was sad that Craig was not letting him see Johnny much, either.  He spotted the photo of the cabin and asked about it, so Janet told him the truth.  Dusty was worried that Janet's interval at the farm was turning into more than just a \"stop along the way.\"  Janet claimed she was just buying time until she could figure out where she wanted to live.  Dusty feared that she and Jack would end up \"playing house,\" and he wondered out loud if he mattered to Janet at all.  He warned her that she was the only one who could change things.\n\n\nJanet said that she and Liberty both had jobs and were taking care of themselves.  She declared she was staying at the farm to include Jack in the baby's life and to save money.  Dusty said he wanted to be part of Janet's future, but just then Liberty ran in and interrupted the discussion.  Dusty told the girl to take good care of her mom, and he took off for Worldwide.  Liberty apologized to her mother, and then she put in a pitch for Gabriel as a carpenter.  Janet wasn't even sure she wanted to accept Jack's offer, but then she caved when Liberty promised that her mother could trust Gabriel implicitly.\n\n\nLucinda arrived at her office and caught Dusty looking at a calendar.  She asked if he was planning the date of the next stockholders' meeting, but they both knew he was counting the days until Janet's due date.  Dusty said he had approached Craig about buying into the company as the two of them had planned, but he had set the price too high, and Craig had walked.  Dusty called Craig \"desperate\" to buy into Worldwide and said that the man was even using Johnny as a bargaining chip.  He described some of Craig's latest tactics, as Craig himself walked in.  Lucinda told Craig that all negotiations were over, but Craig asked only for a more reasonable price.  \"Not a chance,\" Lucinda said with a grin.\n\n\nCraig turned to Dusty and referred to him as a \"bottom line kind of guy,\" and handed him his final offer on a piece of paper.  Dusty showed it to Lucinda, who asked Craig to show himself out.  Just then, Lucinda's secretary joined them and told Lucinda that Mr. Anthony Blackthorn was on the phone for her, and that piqued Craig's interest.  Lucinda declined the call and sent her secretary out.  Craig grumbled and walked out, as Dusty questioned Lucinda about Blackthorn.  She assured Dusty that she knew what she was doing.\n\n\nCraig saw Gabriel in Old Town and told him that he had great things in mind for his son.  He asked Gabriel to \"tag along\" on an impending business meeting, but the boy was caustic and bitter.  \"What is this,\" asked Gabriel, \"take your bastard to work day?\"  He further stated that he didn't care about Craig or his business, and he kept walking.  Liberty found him in Java and announced that she had gotten him a job.  She explained about the cabin, but Gabriel claimed that he didn't want charity, nor did he want a cop watching his back all day.  Gabriel was tired of being thought of as Craig Montgomery's son, but he promised he would think about the job.  Liberty left, as Gabriel took out his phone and called the bank to announce that he was closing out his account.\n\n\nCraig walked into the diner and found Anthony Blackthorn eating macaroni there.  He started a one-sided conversation with the man, after he had introduced himself.  Then Craig said he had a business proposition for him, but Blackthorn only looked at Craig and said, \"Take a hike.\"  Craig asked why Blackthorn was interested in Worldwide, and the stranger said he was always attracted to a business that turned a profit.  Craig warned him about Lucinda, but as he stood to leave, Blackthorn said he hadn't gotten Craig's point.  Craig said if Blackthorn was going head-to-head with Lucinda Walsh, he needed Craig.  \"Sit down,\" ordered Blackthorn.  After their discussion, Blackthorn left Al's and took out his phone.  He called his \"boss\" and announced, \"I think we've got a live one.\"\n\n\nCraig next talked to Lily on the phone and asked if she was going to take his money for her fragrance business with Carly.  Lily said Carly was still gung-ho about the project, but Lily wasn't comfortable keeping Craig's involvement a secret.  Craig said he was amazed that Lily was Lucinda's daughter, and he advised her to lose the guilt and keep her mouth shut.  There was no way, Craig said, that he would allow her to tell Carly that Craig was financing their project.  Lily hung up as Carly walked in and asked what Craig was trying to talk Lily into.\n\n\nLily made them lemonade and fibbed to her friend.  She told Carly that Craig had called about Gabriel, but Carly couldn't believe that Lily was allowing the boy to stay with her family.  She advised her friend to \"cut Craig off at the knees.\"  Lily changed the subject to business, and the two of them began to think about possible names for their fragrance company.  They finally settled on a combination of their two names, \"Carlisle.\"\n\n\nAfter her conference with Carly, Lily went to Worldwide and asked her mother what was going on.  Lucinda was not talking, so Lily announced that she and Carly were starting a business together.  Lucinda approved, much to Lily's surprise, and then Lucinda reminded her daughter that she had suggested weeks earlier that Lily get over the pain of Holden's engagement to Molly by throwing herself into a business venture.  Then Lucinda remarked that Carly carried some \"strange baggage,\" and by that she meant Craig.  Lily assured her mother that she and Carly were doing everything on their own.  Lucinda offered to cover Lily's investment, but her daughter refused.  Then she kissed her mother on both cheeks and took off.\n\n\nDusty returned to Lucinda's office and poured himself a stiff drink.  \"I take it Janet remains out of reach,\" quipped Lucinda.  Her phone rang, and Lucinda had a short but meaningful conversation with Craig.  After she finished it, she turned to Dusty and said that Craig had somehow managed to meet their price for an interest in Worldwide.  Dusty could not think of how Craig had gotten that kind of money, but Lucinda said she had an idea.\n\n\nAfter her meeting with Lily, Carly went home and talked at length with her webmaster about the design for Carlisle's web page.  Jack rang her doorbell, so Carly motioned him inside.  She said goodbye on the phone and showed Jack the logo she had designed for the business.  Jack made a crack about her spending Craig's money quickly, so Carly countered with a remark about Jack's moving Janet back to the farm.  They talked about the problem between Janet and Dusty and also about the \"inheritance\" scheme that had caused the most recent breakup between those two.  The conversation deteriorated into a loud discussion about a summer college prep program in New York City for Parker.\n\n\nCarly said that Lily had put in a good word for Parker with the program's director, and Parker had gotten in and been awarded a scholarship.  Jack was worried about how Parker would feel about being separated from Liberty for the summer, but that irritated Carly.  Jack said he really wanted things to be how they used to be, but Carly said that couldn't happen because Jack disapproved of everything Carly said and did.  Her phone rang, so she answered it and dismissed Jack by saying it was business.\n\n\nGabriel knocked on a door in the Lakeview and walked into a poker game with three men.  The guys made fun of \"the kid,\" until Gabriel mentioned that his money was as good as theirs, and, besides, it wasn't his; it was his dad's, and he told them who \"dad \"was.  \"Come on in, kid,\" said one player.  \"We'll be glad to take your daddy's money.\"  Gabriel sat at the table, and they began playing.  After a while, Gabriel won a huge pot, but just as he was raking in the chips, the door burst open, and a cop, with gun drawn, announced that they were all under arrest.  The cops escorted the poker players to the station, where Jack asked Gabriel what he had done.  \"Just a stupid poker game,\" the boy said.  Jack told the arresting officer to book the other three, but to leave Gabriel with him.\n\n\nCraig walked in unannounced at Lily's and declared, \"This was a glorious day!\"  He was looking for Gabriel and wondering how the boy's job hunt had gone.  Lily only knew that his son wasn't back yet.  Craig was pumped that he had \"snagged\" a major investor who resented Lucinda almost as much as he did.  Lily asked what he was doing, but Craig answered that he was buying into Worldwide.  He also declined to name his investor, and then the conversation switched to Carlisle Fragrances.  Craig said he liked the name, and he really hoped that the company succeeded.  \"That's because you are still in love with Carly,\" observed Lily.\n\n\nCraig called Lily wrong and said he owed Carly because he had sold her a bill of goods.  He had also taken her and Parker's money, a devious thing to do.  He said he needed to feel \"clean\" again, and respectable.  He invited Lily to go to dinner with him to celebrate a successful day's work.  She accepted, but then Craig's phone rang, and Jack asked him to go directly to the station because Gabriel was under arrest -- again.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty and Carly are tired of waiting for Jack and Janet to make up their minds and make their feelings known to them. Jack tries to patch things up with Carly, but she makes it clear that she won't keep a candle burning in the window for him while he is building a cabin for Janet and nesting with her. Carly decides to concentrate on her perfume company that she is starting with Lily which the ladies decide to name Carli (pronounced like the word lie). Dusty is worried that Janet is letting Jack build her a permanent home because he is fixing up an old cabin on Emma's property for her but she insists it is only until after the baby is born. Liberty persuades Jack and Janet to hire Gabriel to help with the cabin. Lily promises Craig she won't tell Carly that he is investing in their company. Lucinda is happy that Lily is getting into a new business so she can keep her mind off Holden. Lily turns down Lucinda's offer to invest in the company because she wants to do it on her own. Liberty tells Gabriel about the job she got for him but he doesn't want her charity. Liberty persuades him to think about the job offer. Liberty tells Gabriel that she can't quit her summer job at Fashions because she needs the money to help with her college tuition. Gabriel decides to close his bank account and use the money to play poker so that he can give the money to Liberty for college. Craig gets a new investor Anthony Blackthorn to help him raise the rest of the money that Lucinda wants to let him invest in Worldwide. Dusty and Lucinda worry when they hear the news and wonder where Craig got all that money. Anthony Blackthorn calls a mysterious boss after his meeting with Craig. Craig is so happy that things went well for him today that he asks Lily out to dinner and she accepts his invitation. Jack calls Craig to inform him that Gabriel was arrested because he was caught in an illegal poker game.",
