After examining Sarah, Dr. Daniels tells Bonnie and Isaac that Sarah has a fever and a rash, but that she cannot be admitted into the hospital because she is a ward of the state. Dr. Daniels gives Bonnie medicine for Sarah and tells Bonnie that the shelter should see to it that Sarah's treatment is continued at the free clinic.  Instead of taking Sarah back to the shelter, Bonnie insists on taking her home with her.  Isaac looks disgusted, but the two of them leave with Sarah.\n\n\nAt Jessica's apartment, Jessica and Ben wait for Bonnie and Isaac to join them for dinner.  While they wait, Ben encourages Jessica to begin planning their wedding.  When Jessica tries to change the subject, Ben asks her directly if she is having doubts about marrying him. Jessica confesses to Ben that she is not ready to marry because she fears physical intimacy as the result of her attempted rape.  Ben holds her gently and promises to stay with her.  Interrupting their intimate and reassuring conversation, Bonnie, Isaac, and Sarah arrive, and Bonnie announces that Sarah is going to stay with them that night.  Isaac declares to Jessica that he is getting tired not only of Sarah but of Bonnie as well.\n\n\nIn the Montana barn where Carly and Jack's wedding was held, Mike cries to Molly that finding out that Jack is Sage's father has made him feel that something vital has been taken away from him.  As Molly, wearing a sundress that barely covers her top, holds him, Katie walks in and sees them in an embrace.  Katie backs out of the door and bumps into Rosanna and Craig.   After Rosanna leaves, Katie tells Craig that, in spite of her real feelings for Mike, she won't go after Mike because it might spoil their friendship.  Meanwhile, inside, Mike tells Molly that he has decided to stay in Oakdale because Katie has become a special friend.  Molly responds that she realizes that it is over between herself and Mike, and leaves Mike in the barn.  On the porch, Carly and Rosanna decide that when they get back to Oakdale they will begin spending time together with both their families.  Jack returns to the porch to tell the sisters about Lily and Rose's rescue, and Rosanna escorts them back inside the barn to the reception.  Jack and Carly dance, as do Craig and Rosanna, the men looking forward to a future of \"family time\" together with mixed feelings.  Katie feels left out, but Mike comes up to her to tell her that he has decided to stay in Oakdale.  Katie is so thrilled that she throws her arms around him, then they begin dancing.  Molly, still in her very revealing sundress, picks Parker up and dances with him.\n\n\nAt the Stewart property, Margo leaves Lily and Holden beside the well to go find Rose.  Dusty enters the house to find Rose standing on a teetering chair with a rope around her neck.  Brackett comes up behind Dusty with a gun, and the two men fight, falling out the door.  The chair tips away under Rose's feet, and she finds herself swinging in the air by her neck.  Rose feels herself being lifted down to the floor and sees Paul's face.  She faints in his arms and he gently places her on the floor.  Dusty wrests the gun from Brackett and holds Brackett at gunpoint until Margo arrives.  When Dusty rushes back to find Rose on the floor, he wonders how she got down.  When Rose opens her eyes to see Dusty, she conceals the fact that she saw Paul.  Margo arrives to tell Rose that Lily is on her way to Memorial in an ambulance, then Margo takes Rose and Dusty back to the police station.  When Margo tells Rose that Spangler and Brackett were working for James Stenbeck, Paul's image flashes into Rose's mind, but she says nothing.  Holden and Lily arrive from the hospital, and Rose and Lily, now clean, embrace. After a hostile encounter with Holden, Dusty offers to take Rose home, but Rose chooses to go home with Lily.  Dusty leaves the police station, saying, \"Someday you'll see I'm not the MAN...you think I am.\"  Margo follows Rose to ask again how she got down from the noose, but Rose pretends not to know and rushes out, following Holden and Lily.\n\n\nPaul returns to the Stewart cabin and calls the federal prison from his cellular phone.   He asks for permission to visit James Stenbeck and gives his name truthfully as Paul Ryan.\n\n\n",

Fearing she has been too hard on Sarah, Bonnie asked her home for the night, against Isaac's wishes. Ben feared Jessica was reconsidering their engagement, but she insisted she just needs time. Ben assured her the pain and fear of her attack will eventually fade, and he will be patient. Katie was obviously shaken that Molly was comforting Mike. Craig told her that if she cares for Mike, she should tell him. Mike and Molly agreed to go their separate ways for good. Mike told an ecstatic Katie that he was staying in Oakdale. As Dusty struggled over the gun with \"Brackett,\" Rose slipped and started to hang. She was shocked to discover that she was rescued by Paul. Dusty entered to find her unconscious. When she awoke, she thought she had been dreaming, until Margo told her that James was behind both her kidnapping and her rescue. She lied and told Margo she didn't know how she got down. Lily and Rose both told Dusty to stay away from Rose. Paul arranged to meet James at the prison.",
