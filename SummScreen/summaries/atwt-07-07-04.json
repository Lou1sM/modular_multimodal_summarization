Mike gives in and tells Henry to meet him at Metro for lunch.\n\n\nJessica and Tom meet to discuss some work.  Tom wants to know the reason it had to be in person though, 'cause it was something they would normally talk about on the phone.  Jessica gets down to business. She says that she is a friend to both Margo and him, and she wanted to know how he was doing.   They talk about betrayals.  Jessica tells him that he has to forget about it and to start trusting Margo again, and to get rid of any  little thing that is a reminder of what has happened. Tom admits that he followed Doc last night to see if he was with his wife.  He was with someone, but it wasn't Margo.   Tom tells her about finding the compact in Doc's car.  Jessica says that Tom can give it to her. She will dispose of it for him.   He comments that he cannot do that because he has left it in the car.  Tom leaves for his meeting. Jessica begins to experience twinges in her stomach area.    At the hospital, the Doctor tells Jessica that it is normal to be experiencing what she is feeling.  The Doctor calls it internal stretching.  She says even in the first week, things begin to move around, and there's still another 39 weeks to go.    Jessica says there must be some mistake, she didn't think those tests could pick anything up until the first  month. The Doctor also mentions that a blood test can pick up a pregnancy in 48 hours.   Jessica  remembers spending the evening with Doc, and faints on the spot.  The Doctor tells her she must take better care of herself, and eat properly and to come to see her in the office, in the early part of next week.  \n\n\nJill sits herself down at Margo's table and tells her that she didn't get much sleep.

Craig tells Lucy that he thinks Dusty is trying to play her hero.   While they are talking Lily and Lucinda enter the room.  Lucinda keeps putting down Craig while Lily tries to quiet her down. Craig says that they all need to keep an open mind as to who the kidnapper might be.  Alan enters the room.  He wants to know what is going on.  Craig says he will call Sierra and Alan says no to him, that he will. When Alan leaves, Lily tells Lucinda that Craig thinks that the person responsible, could possibly be Alan.  Lucinda agrees to run a background check on Alan and find out what she can about the man who married her daughter in a whirlwind romance.  Lucy makes a call to Dusty.  She tells him that there are security guards all around protecting her.  Dusty is glad to hear that.  He tells her to stay by the house and do what she is told by the security guards.  Lucy tells him that she wishes she could see him, just as Craig walks into the room and asks her who it is, that she would like to see.  \n\n\nNikki is at the office pleading for more time to bring in Dusty.  Her boss says she can have twelve hour and no more.  Hal says he can perhaps supply her with a couple of men to aide her search.  While she is alone, the phone rings and it is Dusty.  He is telling her that he did not forget about their deal and he is on Don Creole's tail.  He needs her help in keeping Craig Montgomery from playing hero for his daughter, and would she keep an eye on him.  Nikki gets up to leave the office and charges into Henry on the way out.

He tells her that he had a talk with Jessica and she sort of straightened things out for him.  The first thing he needs to do is to dispose of the compact that he found.  He throws it in the trash and walks out.  Jessica, once again, is confronted by her Doctor, about the next week's appointment.  She will not be doing a sonogram because it is a little early for that, and they usually wait until the end of the first month.  The Doctor leaves and Jessica calls Margo.  She apologizes for being a little late.  Margo tells her that whatever she told Tom, did him a world of good.  He even threw away the compact.  Margo says that she was thinking she might go over and pull it out of the trash, when she called.  In fact, she is still toying with the idea.  Jessica tells her not to do that.  Margo says that she just wanted to know who was with Doc last night.  Jessica tells her to place her luncheon order and she will be right there.  Jessica starts on over.  In the meantime, Margo gets a waiter to retrieve the compact.  When he brings it back, Margo thanks him.  She turns it over and reads what it says.

She tells Craig to please stay out of it.  When they get this Don Creole, they will find out who paid him to kidnap Lucy.  She walks away and sits at the bar.  Down the stairs comes Mike and Henry.  Henry is going on and on about this \"vision of loveliness\" he encountered earlier during the day.  All of a sudden he spots her sitting there alone at the bar.  He begs Mike to intercede on his behalf.  Mike goes up to her, and she turns around, and throws her arms around him.  Henry looks on, and says, \"oh great !!!\"\n\n\nDoc meets Jill in the lounge.  She is pushing to get him alone, but, Doc settles her down into ordering a drink and tells her it won't take much time.  He tells her to \"sip it slowly sister, 'cause when you're finished  with that drink, I'm finished  with you.\"  He tells her that no matter what she thought, she is not going up to his room, not now, not ever.  She says that she thought they had a deal.  Doc reminds her that she had the deal, not him.  He also tells her that she might have been five stars in his book, but, blackmail is a deal breaker.  He warns her not to true it again and if she thinks that his brief thing with Margo was anything, to go ahead and do what she wants, it's on her head.  He gets up and leaves.\n\n\nCraig uses Lucy's cell phone to redial a number of the person she had been speaking with.  He discovers it was Dusty, who is thinking it was Creole calling, and Dusty is saying that he just wants to talk.  Craig hangs up.  He knows he must reach Creole before Dusty does.\n\n\n",
