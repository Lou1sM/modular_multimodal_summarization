    "soap_central": "\n\nCarly went over a list of things that Parker would need for his summer program in New York City.  She rattled on about a surge protector for his computer and a fan in case the air conditioning went out in the dorm.  Finally Parker reminded his mother that he had originally wanted to do the summer program because Liberty was also going to be in New York on an internship, but he had ruined that for her.  He asked if Carly could talk to Lily or anyone else she knew who might give Liberty another shot at an internship.  Carly said she would be happy to help.\n\n\nParker went out to the farm where Liberty and Faith were painting chairs on the kitchen table.  He told the girls that he had gotten into the summer chemistry program in New York, but the best news was that he wanted to make up for screwing up Liberty's earlier chance in New York.   He said Carly was working on getting the girl back in, perhaps with Lily's help. Liberty was speechless, but her answer to Parker was definitely \"no.\"  He attempted to convince her about the great connections she could make for her fashion career, but Liberty protested that she already had a job at Fashions, and besides, living in New York would cost a fortune.\n\n\nParker said that he and his mother would cover all of Liberty's expenses in New York, but the girl said her mother was having a baby and also needed her help with the cabin.  Faith interjected that Gabriel couldn't do all the work himself.  Parker was furious that everything about Liberty lately had to do with Gabriel, and he stormed out.  Liberty was upset with Faith, but the younger girl declared that Parker had a right to know, and she ran after him.\n\n\nAt the police station, Craig whispered to Lily that he thought Jack had found out that he was financing the fragrance company and was taking it out on Gabriel.  Lily didn't believe that, and soon Jack arrived and told them that Gabriel had been busted with three other guys in an illegal poker game.  He ordered the boy to the interrogation room so that Craig could talk to him.  Then Jack said quietly to Lily that he trusted her to keep Craig away from her perfume business with Carly.\n\n\nGabriel went into the interrogation room, but he was not pleased to see his father there.  Craig said he was willing to spring the boy from jail if Gabriel would give him a chance.  Gabriel insisted that he didn't need a father anymore, but when it appeared that Craig was walking out, the boy called him back.  He asked what his father wanted, and Craig responded that, for starters, Gabriel could tell him where he got the money he was gambling with.  Gabriel remained silent, but Craig figured out it was Lucinda's payoff money.  Gabriel complained that he was holding three aces and was about to win all his money back when the cop busted them.\n\n\nCraig finally pulled it out of Gabriel that his son had gambled in order to help Liberty pay for college. Craig walked out, as Gabriel called a sarcastic \"Thank you\" after him.  Craig learned from Jack that his son's hearing with a judge was in half an hour, and he reminded Jack that Gabriel was a repeat offender, as was Craig.  He assumed that it would sit better with the judge if Gabriel had a bona fide job.  Craig asked about the job that Jack had offered the boy renovating the cabin for Janet, and he hoped that the job was still open to Gabriel.  \"Hell no,\" said Jack.\n\n\n Craig claimed his son had a good reason for gambling because he was trying to make money to give Liberty for her college tuition.  He reminded Jack that in the courtroom, Jack was the only one who could help Gabriel.  They argued until Jack gave in and said Gabriel could have the carpentry job at the farm.  Craig was thankful, as his son listened to the entire conversation by the open door.\n\n\nGabriel got lucky and got out of jail after his hearing, so he and Craig went to the farm for the boy to start his job.  Liberty opened the door, and Gabriel said that Craig had just paid his bail.  Craig left the teens alone, and Gabriel explained that he had gotten busted for gambling because he wanted to get Liberty a cache of college tuition money.  Liberty accused him of going \"macho\" on her, and she got very angry.  She yelled at Gabriel and then rhetorically asked what was wrong with the men in Oakdale.  \n\n\nLiberty opened the door and yelled for Gabriel to get out.  She shouted that she would not have taken a penny from him, and all she wanted was to do her job at Fashions and earn her own way.  Gabriel stopped Liberty's rant by saying that \"Jack the Cop\" had hired him anyway, and Liberty grinned and gave the boy a hug.\n\n\nAt Worldwide, Lucinda greeted a former business partner, Francoise Pacaud.  Lucinda had been in the perfume business with the woman in France but had pulled out of the deal at the last minute.  The factory had been abandoned and, according to Francoise, torn down several years before.  Lucinda asked her to sell Lily the non-existent factory, because, she confided, some lessons were painful but necessary.\n\n\nLily went to Carly's house and learned that a woman who had a perfume factory in France for sale had contacted Carly that morning.  Lily looked at Carly's notes but could not believe the reasonable asking price.  Lily assumed the price was in euros, but Carly said no, it was even better; the quoted price was in US dollars. They did some math and figured out that owning their own manufacturing facility would cut their expenses in half.  They congratulated themselves that fate had done them a good turn. Someone knocked on the door, and Carly opened it to find Francoise Pacaud herself.  Lily looked at the woman and realized that \"Fate\" had nothing to do with their good fortune.  She turned to Francoise and said, \"My mother put you up to this, didn't she?\"\n\n\nLily explained to Carly that Francoise used to be in business with Lucinda until they had a falling out.  She took her partner aside and said that Lucinda had wanted to be part of their Carlisle Fragrance line, but Lily had turned her down.  Francoise was obviously Lucinda's way of getting her finger into their business. The French woman turned to leave, but Carly stopped her.  She asked Francoise to wait, and she invited Lily to join her in the kitchen for a private chat.  \n\n\nCarly wanted the factory badly, but Lily could not stomach any more of her mother's interference in her business.  Carly understood because, she said, she would feel the same way if Craig was trying to wrangle his way into their deal.  They agreed to turn down the factory offer, but Carly still talked about the time and money their own plant would save.\n\n\nCarly reminded Lily that they were both shrewd businesswomen, and perhaps there was a way to take something Lucinda had thrown away and make it pay off.  They agreed to ask some more questions and get the necessary answers.  Lily and Carly returned to the living room, and Lily questioned why Francoise was not selling her factory to a French firm.  Francoise said that several French conglomerates had expressed interest in it, but none of them would allow her to stay involved.  She was hoping to stay on at the factory and supervise the daily operations.  She also promised them all the financial statements and other documents they would need.  Madame Pacaud talked as if the sale was a done deal, and she congratulated both Lily and Carly.\n\n\nAfter leaving Carly's, Lily met Craig in the Lakeview lobby, and he reported that Gabriel was bailed out and gainfully employed at the Snyder farm.  Lily said she and Carly had already found a customized perfume factory in France, so Craig wanted to break out the champagne.  Lily put the brakes on, however, and explained that the owner had approached Carly directly on orders from Lucinda.  Craig told Lily not to worry because he would \"take care of Lucinda.\"  Lily was skeptical, but Craig assured her that he would not hurt her mother physically.  He was more concerned with helping Lily declare her independence from the world's worst micromanager.  Craig suggested that Lily take a break and think about whether Craig was on her side or not, and he cancelled his dinner with her.\n\n\nCraig picked up Johnny and the two of them headed through Old Town on their way to Chicago.  Craig was taking his boy to his first Cubs game at Wrigley Field, and Johnny asked if Gabriel was going with them.  Craig promised that perhaps Gabriel could go the next time, and then he bragged that he would buy their family a luxury box at the ballpark.  Johnny had no idea what his father meant, but Craig said it was something they could keep in their family so his boys could use it.\n\n\nFaith caught up with Parker in Old Town, but he told her to \"get lost.\"  He hurried on by and went to see his dad at the police station.  Parker blurted out that he didn't want to do the summer program in New York, after all, and Jack said that was okay until he realized that Carly did not know about the change in plans.  Parker fibbed about not wanting to spend the summer in boring classes, but Jack asked for the real reason.  Parker then mentioned Liberty's involvement with Gabriel and with great sarcasm, he thanked his father for giving the boy a job.  Jack advised Parker not to get hung up on one girl and pin all his hopes on her, and the boy said, \"Look who's talking, Dad.\"\n\n\nThe pair went to talk with Carly, and Parker said he wasn't going to New York.  Carly immediately blamed the change in plans on Jack, and an argument ensued.  Parker interrupted them and declared that they were both right.  Jack was right because it was irresponsible of Parker to make plans for Liberty without consulting her.  Carly was also right to give Parker the freedom to make a mistake and learn from it.  He said he had an apology to make, so he left.  Carly and Jack sat on the bench on Carly's porch and talked until Jack had to get back to the farm.  Carly went inside with a smile on her face.\n\n\nFaith, who was crushed by Parker's brush-off in Old Town, went to see her grandmother at her office.  She asked the same question Liberty had asked earlier: what was wrong with the men in Oakdale? The girl said she wanted to hang out with Lucinda for the summer, and she suggested they travel somewhere on the Worldwide jet.  Lucinda said travel would not answer Faith's question, because men were the same everywhere.  Faith complained that the local men were all \"babies,\" and Lucinda asked if her granddaughter was suffering from unrequited love.  Faith denied that, but Lucinda said the girl needed to practice her \"man techniques\" on someone she didn't care about.\n\n\nFaith hadn't given up on the travel scheme, however, so she asked if she could take the plane around the world if Lucinda couldn't go.  Lucinda laughed uproariously at that, and she told her granddaughter to go \"jump in the pond.\"  Faith was afraid she would run into Gabriel there, and she explained that he was working at the farm, courtesy of Jack.  \"Push them away, then pull them back,\" was Lucinda's final suggestion about handling men.\n\n\nAfter Faith left, Lily paid another visit to her mother.  She thanked her for the referral of Francoise Pacaud.  Lily was pleased with herself that she had remembered the woman and flaunted the fact that she and Carly were going to \"take the deal.\"  She warned her mother, however, that from that time on, she would tolerate no more interference from Lucinda.  Lily left, and Francoise joined Lucinda in her office.  She complimented Lucinda on Lily, and Lucinda said that her main goal was to \"break Craig Montgomery into bits.\"\n\n\nFaith took her grandmother's advice, after all, and she swam in the Snyder pond. She heard Parker calling to her, but she turned her back and chanted Lucinda's mantra of \"Push him away, pull him in.\"  She walked out of the water in her bikini, handed Parker her towel, and asked him coyly to dry her back.\n\n\n",
