The two got off to a rocky start, but Carly diffused the situation. Jack was there to deliver a letter from Sage at camp. Jack was furious to hear that Lily and Holden had set up the date and stormed out. Carly told Neal it felt strange to her to be dating again, and Neal revealed that he had lost his wife to breast cancer a couple of years earlier. \n\n\nHolden and Lily were discussing Meg's upcoming marriage to Paul. Holden expressed concern for Meg, but Lily reminded him he had concerns closer to home-like her. They decided to go out for lunch and then stop by the farm to see Meg. Jack arrived, however, and chewed out Lily for setting up his ex with a guy with a funny accent. Lily accused Jack of being jealous and told Holden to talk some sense into his cousin. Holden refused, however, and Lily continued to defend Carly. \n\n\nMike found Barbara eating breakfast at the Lakeview and approached her with his concern for Sofie. Barbara told him Sofie was \"long gone,\" but Mike was not convinced. She told him the situation was \"handled.\" Mike went to Barbara's office and asked her assistant Kelly if Sofie had left behind any of her personal effects, and Kelly retrieved a cardboard box, which she gave to Mike. In the box, Mike found one of Sofie's special earrings that she had made, along with a notebook with a paper with Cole's phone number on it. Mike called Cole and asked if he knew where Sofie had gone, but Cole brushed him off. Mike called back and explained that Sofie had disappeared. Cole told him not to worry, that Sofie was a hustler and could take care of herself. He suggested that the girl had scammed Mike and that he had better count the money in his wallet. \n\n\nMeg woke up at Fairwinds to find Paul cleaning up after planting some new rose bushes in the garden. She realized the plants were just over the site where Paul had buried Sofie, and that was disturbing to her. Meg began to have second thoughts about keeping Sofie's death a secret and suggested they go to the police and tell the truth. Paul disagreed; he felt nothing would bring Sofie back and that they needed to keep under the radar. Meg was still upset that Paul could ever think she could murder someone. Paul said he would do whatever Meg thought was best, even if it meant going to the police. Meg asked Paul if he thought it was possible that Sofie injected herself so that Paul would find and \"save\" her, but Paul rejected that. Suddenly Barbara burst in with the news that Sofie had left town and all their problems were solved. \n\n\nBarbara told Paul and Meg that there was no longer anything standing in the way of their happiness and that she had made all the arrangements for an immediate wedding. She had even found the perfect spot for the ceremony, where Paul had planted some beautiful rose bushes. Barbara left to complete the arrangements and escort the judge she had brought out to the garden. When she left, both Meg and Paul had the thought that perhaps Barbara could have been the one who had injected Sofie with the lethal dose. Meg wondered if Barbara could destroy her own grandchild, but Paul believed that Barbara had no feelings for that fetus and could do the deed. They began to dress for the ceremony. \n\n\nCarly and Neal finished their lunch, and Neal refused to be put off by Carly's low opinion of her life. He took her home but declined to come in because of work issues. He enthusiastically promised he would call her soon. Carly got a surprise when she walked into her living room and found Jack. The two of them argued again, and Carly told Jack he did not know her anymore and to stop suffocating her. A sad Jack walked out. \n\n\nPaul confronted his mother by asking her at what price their happiness came. He was sure that Barbara had killed Sofie. The wedding participants gathered in the garden, and the judge was about to begin the ceremony when Mike joined them, babbling about Sofie's disappearance. He urged Meg to reconsider her marriage and told the two of them they were making a big mistake. \n\n\nNeal, on his way back to the construction site, stopped in at the farmhouse to thank Lily and Holden for setting up his date with Carly. He was obviously enamored of Carly and told Holden that Jack must have been crazy to have walked away from a woman like her. Lily questioned Neal about his future plans with Carly, and on the spur of the moment, offered to host one of her small dinner parties for the four of them. Holden was not pleased about it, but Lily did not understand his reasons. \n\n\nPaul and Meg's wedding began with Mike's leaving in disgust. Meg was totally focused on the rose bushes and what lay beneath as the minister spoke. As Mike was walking, he spotted, on a bush, the match to Sofie's earring that he had found in the box of her belongings.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Holden and Jack are both jealous that Carly is going out to lunch with Mike's boss Neal stoles and they are both mad at Lily for setting Carly up on a date with another smooth talking guy with an accent. Jack tells Lily that the last thing Carly needs is to be set up with another guy who she thinks can sweep her off her feet. Lily knows Jack is just jealous and tells him so because she thinks Jack doesn't want Carly to be happy with any man who isn't him. Lily is surprised when she looks to Holden to support her about Carly but he agrees with Jack. Holden also can't stop thinking about when he and Carly made love at camp. Carly and Neal have a good time at lunch and Carly is surprised that Neal isn't scared away by her past. Carly tells Neal he can call her to go out sometime and Neal is thrilled the date went so well. Neal stops by to thank Holden and Lily for helping persuade Carly to go out with him because he had a great time on their lunch date. Lilly tells Neal that she plans to invite both he and Carly to dinner and Neal is thrilled and accepts the invitation. Paul and Meg try to figure out who killed Sofie and they suspect Barbara when she arrives and happily tells them that Sofie has left town so they are free to get married today. Barbara wants Paul and Meg to get married in the garden next to the rose bushes Paul planted earlier that morning to cover up Sofie's grave. Paul and Meg decide to protect Barbara because she is ill and they think she only killed Sofie to help them be happy. Mike goes through Sofie's personal effects at his office and finds Cole's phone number and calls Cole to find out if he knows Sofie's whereabouts.
