    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt Margo's, Craig fussed over last-minute wedding arrangements, as Margo teased him.  She was surprised that Craig had not ordered champagne, so her brother explained that his nuptials were to be alcohol-free.  He claimed it was because there were children present, and Margo thought that was very considerate -- for Craig.  Craig decided to throw caution to the wind and see his bride before the wedding, so he left to check on Carly.\n\n\nCarly opened the oven in her kitchen, searching for a bottle of vodka.  Rosanna walked in, holding one that she claimed to have found there.  Carly's rationale for opening the oven was that she wanted to bake cupcakes for Sage as an apology for yelling at the girl.  Rosanna did not buy that lame excuse, so Carly tried another tack.  She claimed to have stopped drinking entirely, but Rosanna demanded to know why it was the first time she was hearing of a problem.  Carly assured her sister that she had already solved the problem.\n\n\nCarly swore that she had gotten rid of all the alcohol in her house, as Rosanna brought in a shopping bag full of empty and partially full bottles that she had found all over the house.  Carly said it had not been that hard for her to quit drinking, but the pressures of the impending wedding had made her edgy.  Rosanna was concerned, and not about to drop the subject, but Craig called out from the living room that he had arrived.  Carly begged Rosanna not to tell Craig that she had slipped off the wagon.\n\n\nCarly went to greet her groom, and they hugged.  Rosanna joined them, but she was obviously torn between her sister's request and doing what would be best for Carly in the long run.  Craig announced that he was there to pick up Parker, his best man, so Carly asked Rosanna to get him from his room.  Craig noticed the tension between the sisters, but Carly dismissed it.   Craig told Parker how handsome he looked, and Craig and the teen prepared to leave.  Craig reminded Rosanna to get his bride to Margo's safely.\n\n\nCarly thanked Rosanna for keeping mum, but Rosanna urged her to reconsider \"rushing into marriage\" with Craig.  She began asking Carly about the symptoms of alcoholism and brought up the fact that Carly's father \"was a drunk.\"  Carly argued that Craig made her life easier, and described how awful her life as a single parent had been.  Then she got angry and went off on Rosanna and accused her of making ridiculous claims about Carly's state of mind.\n\n\nRosanna remarked that they should call Craig and tell him that Carly was drinking again, and she picked up the bag of bottles.  Carly accused her sister of leading a \"charmed life\" and promised that she would stop drinking permanently.  They continued to argue while Rosanna asked Carly to look her in the eye and tell her that she was not an alcoholic.  Then Rosanna dumped all the bottles on a table and asked her sister to admit what she was.  She vowed that she was going to stop Carly from killing herself, but she did agree to stand by her sister in the wedding.  Carly asked Rosanna to go to Margo's instead of staying to help Carly.  After Rosanna left, Carly went straight to the bottle in her purse.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet fixed Sage's hair while the girl complained about her dress.  Jack walked in and asked Sage what was bothering her.  His daughter said that she was worried that Carly would marry Craig and then go away with him.   Jack told her that would never happen, and he assured her that Carly's marriage to Craig was not at all like when her mother had run off with Simon Frasier.  Sage was also concerned that Carly was acting strangely lately, and she cited the fact that Carly had bought Sage a dress for the wedding instead of making her one.  Carly's yelling at her had also disturbed the girl.\n\n\nCraig, Parker, and Johnny arrived at Margo's, and Craig handed his sister a gift for allowing them to use her house for the wedding.  Margo opened the package and found a lovely picture frame.  Craig suggested that Margo put a photo of Adam in it and keep it on her desk.  He talked about how difficult it had been for him when Bryant died.  Johnny interrupted by saying that he wanted some cheese fries, so Parker offered to take the boy to the diner for his fries, but he promised to have him back in time for the wedding.  Craig reluctantly agreed, and then he and Tom greeted Jack, Janet, and Sage, who were arriving.\n\n\nAt the diner, Parker got Johnny settled with his snack when Liberty walked in.  Johnny lost a bout with the ketchup dispenser and ended up with the front of his shirt covered in it.  Liberty attempted to lessen the damage, but it was hopeless.  She and Johnny thought the red-stained shirt was funny, but Parker was fearful that Craig would kill him, and he panicked.  Liberty suggested that they take Parker to Craig's room at the Lakeview and change his shirt, so they hurried out.  In the hotel, Parker apologized to Liberty for being mean and jealous when other boys paid attention to her, so Liberty suggested that they not label their relationship, but just \"be.\"\n\n\nJack and Craig had a discussion on Margo's porch, and Jack thanked his nemesis for making Carly a better person with his support and encouragement.  He asked Craig for a promise to always take care of Carly and the children whom Jack and Carly shared.  Craig gave that promise, and a truce prevailed.\n\n\nLiberty, Parker, and Johnny showed up, and Parker explained why Johnny was wearing a different shirt and tie.  Craig thanked Parker for handling the wardrobe malfunction so well.  Rosanna knocked on the door, but she was alone.  She told Craig and Parker that Carly had not ridden with her.  Margo offered her guests something to eat, as Craig motioned Rosanna outside for a private chat.  He demanded to know where Carly really was, so Rosanna told him that she and Carly had argued, and Carly had thrown her out.\n\n\nCraig insisted on knowing the details, so Rosanna said she had just found out about Carly's drinking problem, and she accused Craig of helping to cover it up. Craig called Rosanna a liar, but Rosanna said that she had seen all the vodka bottles.  Craig said she was mistaken, but when Rosanna described where she had found them, Craig was stunned speechless.\n\n\nCarly got dressed by herself and went to take another drink from her stash, but the only bottle she had left was empty.  She called to check on the status of the limo she had ordered, and casually inquired if it had a bar in it.  When the limo arrived, Carly got in; she immediately found the bar and poured herself a big drink.  The driver commented that it looked as if she had already had a few, and Carly asked if he had a problem with that.  She asked him to start driving, as she sipped her drink.  Carly arrived at Margo's and walked up near the porch in time to hear Craig chewing out Rosanna for making up stories about Carly because Rosanna hated Craig so much.  He accused her of planning payback for him, but Rosanna denied it.  Carly turned around and left.\n\n\nCraig and Rosanna went back inside.  Everyone asked about Carly, especially the judge, who was on a tight time schedule.  Parker was upset, but Craig reassured everyone that Carly was just running late.  He took out his phone and called Carly, who did not answer.  She was in the limo drinking, and the chauffeur was driving aimlessly.\n\n\nThe children became restless and did not understand why the wedding had not started.  Parker agonized that his mother was not going to show up, and he stormed upstairs.  Liberty followed to console him.  Craig went outside to wait, and Jack cornered Rosanna and asked her bluntly if Carly had been drinking.  Rosanna answered that she had not seen Carly drinking, but she had found evidence in the house.  Jack, Janet, and Sage went home, as Craig continued to pace on the porch.  Everyone left except Tom, Margo, Rosanna, and Craig, who was still declaring that Carly would arrive any minute. \n\n\n",
