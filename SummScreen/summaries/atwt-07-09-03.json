Rick notices that Emily was a little jumpy.  Susan comes in and Emily says she wanted to make plans for Alison's birthday.  Rick says he wants to be a part of it.  After Emily leaves, Rick tells Susan that he can tell that Emily knows about his past at the other hospital.  Susan thought it best that her daughters heard about it from her but Rick says he's trying to make friends and doesn't want to scare them away.  He says the girls would probably be more comfortable if he stopped seeing their mother but Susan doesn't want that to happen.  He says that Walker Daniels is the only problem.  Rick convinces Susan that Walker could be ruining the girls' views and opinions.  He then asks Susan to marry him.  \n\n\nAlison thinks Chris has a birthday gift for her but he is only returning a sweater she left at his house.  She is upset that he forgot her birthday.  Katie tries to cheer her up telling her all the perks of being 18, like voting and getting a credit card.  Then, Chris shows up with a gift.  It is a necklace and Alison says it is beautiful.  Chris says, \"just like the girl who's gonna wear it\" and then he kisses her.\n\n\nDusty asks Rose why they can't be together.  She tells him because of Paul and says that he's like \"a dark storm cloud hovering over the both of us.\"  Rose recalls how she almost died and she remembers how she \"saw\" Paul.  She decides not to mention this to Dusty who says he really cares about her but he's, \"not a wait around kind of guy\" and \"won't let a dead man come between us.\"\n\n\nBarbara goes to Paul's memorial and Jennifer, who had been in Milan, walks in.  Barbara is so happy to see her but asks her why she didn't return her calls or return home when Paul died.  Jennifer says she didn't return anyone's phone calls because \"she didn't want anyone to know what a complete wreck my life is.\"  She says she hasn't worked in the last couple of months and starts to say, \"There was this guy...\" but that's all she will say.  She tells her mother that she's broke and won't be going back to Europe to model.  Barbara invites her to stay at her suite at the Lakeview.  Jennifer just wants to know what happened with Paul.  At that moment, Paul walks into the memorial but hides so he can listen to them talk.   Jennifer talks about how much she misses Paul and asks Barbara, \"Why is my brother dead?\"  And why was he out there alone miles from Oakdale?  Barbara reluctantly tells her that Paul was upset with many people because of a misunderstanding.   She talks about Dusty and Rose becoming involved but she doesn't mention her involvement.  Jennifer misses Paul and begins to cry.  \n\n\nWalker brings his files on the serial killer to the police station.  Hal tells him to keep his theories to himself but Walker says he wants to do his job.  Emily calls Walker and wants to talk about Rick Decker.  They meet at the police station but Walker says he can't discuss the case even though Emily says it is very important to her.  She begins to get upset and says that her mother's life could be in danger.  She tells Walker to look her in the eye and tell her she has nothing to worry about with Rick Decker.  Walker can't and Emily knows that Rick is still very much a suspect.\n\n\nMargo and Tom discuss their busy schedules but Tom says that their lives will actually be a little calmer from now on.  He explains that he was offered the position of district attorney and he accepted.  Margo asks why he would want to switch from private practice to a public job.  Tom says, \"I did it for us.\"  He says he wants them to spend more time together and Margo is pleased.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Alison was disappointed when she thought Chris forgot her 18th birthday. Chris later surprised her with a necklace and a kiss. Hal told Walker to keep his suspicions about Rick to himself, but when Emily pushed, Walker admitted his suspicions. Emily worried about Susan's safety. Meanwhile, Susan admitted to Rick that she told her daughters about Rick's past, because she wanted to be honest. Rick was worried that Walker would turn Emily and Alison against him, so he proposed to Susan to prove his good intentions. Rose told Dusty she needed time to grieve and deal with her guilt over Paul, but he said he won't wait long. Jennifer returned to Oakdale, and wanted to know why Paul died. Barbara told her there had been a problem with Rose and Dusty, but that he died knowing his mother loved him. Paul secretly listened in as Jen explained that she was no longer modeling. Tom told Margo that he'd been hired as Oakdale's new District Attorney.",
