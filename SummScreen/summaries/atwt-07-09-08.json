Emily reminded Casey that she had ended their relationship, but Casey tried to persuade her to see him. Emily hung up on Casey, but he was still talking when Margo came home and overheard his end of the conversation. Margo asked Casey who he was talking to on the phone, but then said she knew he was on the phone with Emily. Casey tried to convince his mom that he was just friends with Emily, but Margo was not swayed. Margo told Casey that she would tell Tom about his \"friendship\" with Emily if he did not put a stop to it. Just as Casey was going to respond, Tom arrived home. In an attempt to avoid upsetting Tom, Margo lied about what they were talking about. Tom was too preoccupied to argue with his wife and son, and told Margo that he had planned a surprise getaway for them to celebrate their anniversary. Margo quickly remarked that she could not go. Tom told his wife that he had cleared her taking the day off with the station and they had nothing to keep them in town. Casey realized his mom's concerns were not about work, but were because she did not trust him. In an attempt to get Margo to go with Tom, Casey promised her she did not have to worry about him. Casey left and told Tom to persuade Margo to go. \n\n\nAlone with Margo, Tom explained that the night away was about them having time as a couple, and with that she finally agreed to go. With her next breath, Margo began to question why Casey had not told them where he was going and Tom threw up his arms and said there was no place he could take her where she would not be focused on Casey. As Tom prepared to walk out, Margo tried to stop him. She asked him why Casey would spend time with Emily, and Tom remarked that Emily did not constantly monitor Casey. Tom told Margo that Emily could not destroy their family and Margo thought about it and finally gave in and agreed to go with him. Tom was overjoyed that his wife's attitude had changed and they prepared to leave. \n\n\nBack at her office, Emily tried to find someone to have dinner with, but was unable to make plans. As she sat daydreaming in her office, Casey arrived and told Emily he wanted to be with her and was not going to let her go just because she was afraid of Margo. Emily defended her choice to end their relationship to keep Margo from telling everyone she was a prostitute. Casey said he would follow any rules Emily set up to keep their relationship secret, but he did not want to lose her. Emily did not think there was any way to keep Margo from finding out. Casey explained they at least had that night to spend together, since Tom and Margo were going out of town. Emily would not change her mind, so frustrated, Casey walked out. \n\n\nAfter seeing Emily, Casey returned home and discovered his parents were packed and ready to leave for their romantic night away. Casey said he would settle in that night with a pizza and told his parents to have fun. A short time after his parents left, Casey was shocked to see Emily on his porch. She questioned out loud why she was there, but Casey told her he was happy she had decided to come and pulled her inside with a kiss. In the house, Casey convinced Emily that they should rekindle their relationship and focus on what they had in the present and not the future. Casey wanted to stop talking and make love, and Emily gave in. Unknown to Casey and Emily, Tom had received a call from a client and he and Margo were on their way back to Oakdale. \n\n\nStripped down in their underwear in the Hugheses' living room, Emily remarked she was hungry and sent Casey upstairs while she prepared a tray of food for them to share in bed. Just as Emily was getting everything set up, Margo returned home and pulled her gun on Emily. She said Emily was an intruder in her home and she was going to protect her son any way she had to. \n\n\nIn the gardens at Fairwinds, the judge asked Meg if she would take Paul as her husband and after a short pause she smiled and answered, \"Yes.\" Paul and Meg shared their first kiss as man and wife, just yards away from where Paul had buried Sofie. Barbara invited the two into the house to share a glass of champagne, but before they went inside Paul promised to love Meg forever. As they began to kiss again, Mike walked over and told Paul he needed to talk to him. Despite Paul and Meg's refusal to listen, Mike insisted that he speak with Paul. Mike held up a piece of jewelry he knew belonged to Sofie and told Paul that he had just found it in his garden, and pointed to the area where Paul had disposed of Sofie. Paul gave Meg a knowing glance and then dismissed Mike's suspicions by saying Sofie had created a lot of her jewelry in the gardens at Fairwinds. Paul's explanation did not end Mike's concerns for Sofie, but he wished Meg well, and left. \n\n\nOnce Mike was out of earshot, Meg immediately turned to Paul and asked him if Sofie was wearing the bracelet the night she died. Paul begged Meg to let him handle everything, but she was not excited about starting their future lying to everyone about a murder. In the house, Meg again told Paul that she did not know if she could keep up the deception, but Paul explained that things would get easier in time. He reminded Meg that they were not guilty of Sofie's murder. He promised Meg she would be happy again someday. Barbara returned to toast the happy couple before leaving for the night. \n\n\nOnce Barbara had gone, Paul swept Meg into his arms and carried her to the bedroom. In bed, Paul sensed Meg was still not all right. Paul said they could move past Sofie's death as a couple. Meg said she agreed to marry Paul, but did not know if she could cover up Sofie's murder. Paul just wanted the two to start their life together and Meg agreed. With Meg's mind cleared, the two began kissing. \n\n\nOut in the garden, Mike was still not convinced that Paul had told him the truth about the bracelet and began to look around for evidence of what happened to Sofie. Mike found the freshly planted rose bushes and thought it was strange that Paul had worked in the garden the day of his wedding. He went back to the Lakeview and asked Lisa if there was any news of Sofie. Lisa said that Sofie was just a manipulative little woman who snuck out of town when things got too chaotic. Mike continued looking for an answer and found the maid who worked in Sofie's room. She told Mike that there was nothing weird about the night Sofie left, except that Paul Ryan was there. Mike was more convinced then ever that Paul was involved in Sofie's vanishing. \n\n\nAfter making love to Paul, Meg snuck out to the garden. She was surprised to find Mike had returned again and was looking around. Mike asked Meg why she was back in the yard, but Meg was more astonished that Mike was there and demanded to know what he was doing. Mike explained that he was trying to find out what happened to Sofie, but Meg could not understand why Mike was so interested in Sofie's disappearance. Mike said Sofie was pregnant and scared, and she would not just leave town. Mike detailed his suspicions to Meg and told her she was too good of a person to be involved in hurting Sofie. Meg noticed dirt on Mike's hand and told Mike they were done talking. She quickly went inside and woke Paul to tell him that Mike was in the rose garden. Paul went to search for Mike, but came back and told Meg that Mike must have left when she came to get him. Meg realized that the only reason Mike would have left was because he had another plan and she was right. Mike had gone to the police station to talk to Jack.\n\n\n",

Emily finds herself outside of Casey's house watching him and wanting to be with him. She decides to leave, but Casey sees her and convinces her to stay.

Meg races back to tell Paul what happened. While she is gone, Mike goes digging. Paul doesn't find Mike when he gets back to the rose garden; Meg is sure Mike has left because he has a plan.
