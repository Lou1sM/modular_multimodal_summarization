Alison gets a big grin on her face and says, \"I'm not free after work because I am going out with you.\"  Chris smiles at her and says that he will see her after work and he walks away.  Alison turns to Katie and says, \"Isn't he just the greatest?\"  Katie tells her that she is the greatest.  Alison agrees with Katie.

Susan tells Ric that she wants to marry him, but she has to talk to her daughters first.  Ric thinks that Susan is hesitant because of Dr. Daniels suspecting him of the hospital murders.  Susan tells him that she won't bring a new person into the family until she consults her children.  She adds that it is only fair.  She says that she can't bring a man home and then say that she is going to marry this man.  Ric asks if there is a yes in that answer.  Susan says that if her girls approve, then they will get married.  Ric gives Susan a kiss and then gets up from his hospital bed.  Susan asks, \"Where are you going?\"  Ric says that he is going to get himself released from the hospital and then they will go home to celebrate Alison's birthday.  Susan asks if he feels good enough.  Ric says that he can't stay in the hospital one more day and he walks out of the room.  \n\n\nEmily goes to the police station and confronts Hal about Dr. Decker.  She says that Dr. Daniels thinks that Dr. Decker is the serial killer.  Emily asks Hal why he hasn't made an arrest yet.  She reminds him that Dr. Decker is living with her mother and sister.  Hal tries to calm her down.  He tells her that everything is under control.  Hal gives his wife a kiss and then walks away.  Emily is frustrated.  Her cell phone starts to ring.  She grabs her purse and answers her phone.  Susan is calling and she asks Emily to pick up Alison's birthday cake and meet them at the hospital.  Emily asks, \"Why the hospital?\"  Susan says that Ric is coming home today and isn't that wonderful.  \n\n\nWhen Emily gets to the hospital, Susan tells Emily all about the plan to surprise Alison.  Susan tries to tell Emily about she and Ric, but Emily stops her.  She tells her mother that this is Alison's day and they can talk about Ric later.  Katie walks up and tells Susan and Emily that she is clocked out for the day.  Emily asks, \"Where is Alison?\"  Susan tells her daughter that she sent Alison to Ric's room to get her sweater for her.  Emily gets upset and asks, \"You sent her by herself?\"  Susan says, \"Yes, What is your problem?\"\n\n\nAlison walks into Ric's hospital room and closes the door.  She looks in a mirror and admires the necklace that Chris had given to her for her birthday.  She finds her mother's sweater and picks it up from the bed.  She hears something squeaking outside the door.  Thinking that Katie is playing a trick on her, she says, \"Very funny, Katie.\"  She walks over to the door and opens it.  The man in the wheelchair is sitting in front of the door.  Alison starts to freak.  \n\n\nCraig and Rosanna arrive home from Montana.  Rosanna starts to go into the living room and Craig stops her.  He tells her that he has a surprise for her.  He says that it is symbolic of their marriage.  He takes her into the living room and says, \"Ta-da!\"  They both get a very surprised look on their faces.  Rosanna walks over to a tall, skinny cactus standing in the middle of the room.  Craig sees the cactus and tells Rosanna that it is supposed to be an oak tree.  Rosanna says that if she remembers right, a cactus has a long life span.  Craig whines, \"But I wanted an oak.\"  Rosanna walks over to it and looks it up and down.  She says, \"It is rather virile looking.\"  Craig says that they do have that going for them.  Craig grabs his wife and takes her down to the floor and attacks her.  The whole time Rosanna is saying, \"No.  Stop.\"  Just as they get to the ground and start making out, Aaron and Lucy walk in on them.  Aaron shields his eyes like he is looking at an eclipse.  Lucy says, \"Daddy?\"  Craig and Rosanna pop up from the floor.  Lucy tells her father that they stopped by to pick up some items for their camping trip.  Craig asks, \"Camping trip?\"  Rosanna reminds her husband that he gave them permission to go on a camping trip.  Aaron tells Craig that the camper that he rented for them won't work because you have to have a license to tow it.  Lucy informs her father that they now have a tent and it is just big enough for she and Aaron.  Craig starts to back peddle.  Lucy asks her father what it is that he is afraid of.  Craig looks at Rosanna and Rosanna looks back at Craig.  Craig answers, \"Rain.  Which you don't get very often in the desert.\"  Aaron reminds him that they are going to Wisconsin.  Lucy tells her father that if it does rain they will sleep in the truck or get a hotel room.  Craig goes into tirade.  He tells his daughter that she is only seventeen and she shouldn't be in a hotel room with some guy.  Lucy says that she know this is difficult for him, but it was difficult for her walking in on him and Rosanna a few minutes ago.  Craig says that they are married.  Lucy asks, \"Oh, do you want us to get married?\"  Craig yells, \"No!\"  Lucy says that is settled, they won't get married.  Lucy tells Aaron to get the car and she will get her journal.  Craig tries to stop his daughter.  Lucy tells her father that this is so much better since they can be honest with each other.  She and Aaron walk out.  Craig looks at Rosanna and says, \"She just handled me.\"  Rosanna says, \"Yes she did.\"  Rosanna starts to laugh and Craig tells her that this is not funny.  Rosanna suggests that they take their cactus and go up to the bedroom.  Later, Rosanna walks back into the living room and finds Lucy and Aaron.  Rosanna reminds Lucy that her father trusts her to use her best judgment.  Aaron shows Rosanna a paper with the campsite's phone number and the phone number to the ranger's station.  Craig walks in just as the kids are leaving.  After they are gone, Craig looks at the paper with the numbers on it.  He tells Rosanna that he knows where the campsite is and if they leave tonight, they can be there by the morning.  Craig tells Rosanna to go and get ready.  Rosanna rolls her eyes back into her head. \n\n\nJack and Carly arrive home to a welcoming committee.  When they walk through the front door, Emma, Lily and Holden stand up and yell, \"Surprise!\"  After they look over the baby, Holden and Lily get Jack up to date on the kidnapping and how Stenbeck had given them hints and clues.  Jack asks if Stenbeck did that to get Barbara's attention.  Holden says that he had Barbara's attention and she had gone to the penitentiary to see him.  Holden asks Jack if Lily and Rose weren't his target, then what is he after.  \n\n\nRose walks up to the front door of Jack and Carly's house.  She hesitates.  She takes out a mirror from her purse and checks her make-up.  She puts the mirror back into her purse and then starts to knock on the door.  She stops and turns away from the door.  She asks, \"Rose, what are you doing?\"  Finally, she walks to the door and knocks.  Lily opens the door and asks Rose what took her so long.  Rose says that she was breaking up with Dusty.  She asks Lily, \"Are you happy now?\"  Lily tells her sister that she can't deny that she wants Dusty Donovan out of their lives, but she has to admit that she is surprised that Rose is so upset.  Carly comes out on the porch and gives Rose a hug.  Rose tells Carly how great she looks.  Carly says that she had heard what Lily and Rose had to go through and she asks Rose if she is ok.  Rose says that she is fine.  Rose asks Carly if she would mind giving her a few moments with her sister and she will be in soon.  Carly says, \"Sure.\" Then she goes into the house.  Lily asks Rose to come inside and see everyone and maybe she would feel better.  Rose says, \"And see all the happy couples?  No thanks.\"  Lily asks if she is mad at she and Holden.  Rose says that she is mad because Lily blackmailed her into not seeing Dusty.  Lily reminds her that Dusty is responsible for Paul's death.  Rose says, \"If he is really dead.\"  Lily asks if that is what she told Dusty that Paul appeared from nowhere to grab her from the jaws of death.  Rose says, \"No.\"  Lily says that she thinks that she is still in love with Paul and that is why she is seeing him.  Rose says that the only feelings that she has for Paul is guilt.  She says that she feels guilt for pushing him away and that his plane went down and he died.  Rose says that even if he isn't dead, they should have never gotten engaged in the first place.  Lily reminds Rose that Dusty was paid to break up she and Paul.  She says that she was manipulated.  Lily goes on to tell her sister that she has not had time to morn her feelings for Paul.  Feelings that she had that are real.  She adds that if she keeps pushing them away they are only going to get stronger and she will keep seeing Paul Ryan.  Rose says that she is not going to spend the rest of her life exploring her feeling for a man that is dead when she has a real live man in front of her that wants her.  She tells her sister to forget it.  Lily asks if she is just going to go crawling back to Dusty.  Rose says that she doesn't crawl to anyone and certainly not to Lily.  Rose tells Lily to tell Jack and Carly that she said goodbye and Rose walks off the porch and leaves.  Lily is left standing alone with tears in her eyes.  \n\n\nAt Paul's burial vault, Barbara tells Jennifer that she can stay with her at The Lakeview and she starts to make all kinds of plans for Jennifer to work with her at her new company.  Barbara tells Jennifer that this is what her brother would want and she would be fulfilling his dreams.  Paul listens to his mother just outside the door.  Jennifer tells her mother that she is not ready to make that kind of a decision.  She tells her mother that she just wants to go and see her father and Will.  Barbara takes over again.  She says that they will go and get Will and get a bite to eat.  Jennifer says that she is not hungry.  Barbara says that she is hungry.  Paul shakes his head outside the vault.  Barbara tells Jennifer that she will get the car and they can go.  After Barbara leave, Jennifer, talking to Paul's vault, tells Paul that she forgot how their mother could take all the air out of a room.  She reads the plague on the vault, loyal brother.  She says that she left him holding the bag and now he is not there to thank.  She hears a car horn and says, \"We know who that is.\"  She kisses her hand and touches the plaque.  She turns and walks out.  After she is gone, Paul walks into the room.  \n\n\nAt The Lakeview, Molly and Dusty are having a drink and making amends.  Rose walks in and sees the two cuddled up with each other.  She walks over to them and says, \"Excuse me.\"  Dusty and Molly jump to their feet.  Molly says that this is her cue to go and unpack.  Before she can leave, Rose stops her and tells her to hear her out.  She says, \"Keep you hands off my man or you will need more than a manicure.\"  Molly says that it is good to have her back.  Molly walks out of the lounge.  Dusty walks over to Rose and asks, \"You back?\"  Rose answers, \"I'm back.\"  \n\n\n",

Later, while alone in Rick's room, she was surprised by the mysterious cloaked stranger in the wheelchair. Craig surprised Rosanna with a cactus, insisting it was supposed to be an oak to symbolize their strong marriage. Just as they began to make love on the floor, Aaron and Lucy surprised them by arriving to pick up camping gear. Aaron explained that they couldn't use the camper Craig had rented because they weren't licensed, but they bought a tent to use. Craig first said no way, but Rosanna and Lucy convinced him to relent. He decided to follow the teens to Wisconsin. Rose told Lily she had to live her life, despite Lily and Holden's reservations. Barbara told Jennifer that Paul would want Jen to join the new BRO. Barbara then took Jen and Will to see Hal, and mused aloud that this was what she wanted: her family back together. Back at his memorial, Paul had conversations with Barbara, Jen, and Will in his head.
