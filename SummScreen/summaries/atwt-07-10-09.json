    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt the diner, Vienna tried to rest her back by lying on top of some tables. Henry joked with her that if she didn't get up soon, he'd have to put her on the \"specials\" menu. Vienna got up, just as two women walked in, wearing Geneva Swift buttons on their blouses. Henry was taken with the buttons, but Vienna was angered and showed the women the door. As the door closed, Vienna had another back spasm and winced in pain.\n\n\nHenry took Vienna to the hospital to be examined. As a nurse wheeled Vienna out of the room for an MRI, Henry took the insurance forms to complete, and assured Vienna that he would be there when she got back from her tests.\n\n\nAt home, Brad lay with his head on Katie's abdomen as Katie read from a pregnancy book. Katie felt a twinge, and Brad insisted they go to the hospital to have it checked out, even though Katie said the doctor had told her it would happen all the time. After they met with the doctor at the hospital, Katie assured Brad that the doctor was right, that the pain she had felt was just ligaments stretching to accommodate her growing belly. However, the doctor wanted to run some tests, and they had to wait for the test results before they could leave.\n\n\nBrad got a call from Kim, who told him she needed him to go to the studio because they had lost 40 seconds of audio on a segment they had filmed previously. Brad told her he was at the hospital with Katie and couldn't get to the station, but Katie grabbed the phone and told Kim that Brad would be there.\n\n\nBrad didn't want to leave Katie alone at the hospital, but he agreed to leave. As he walked out of the hospital room, he encountered Henry. They both explained why they were there, and then Brad asked if Henry could keep an eye on Katie while he went back to the studio for a reshoot. Without waiting for an answer, Brad thanked Henry and left. Henry went in to see Katie, and as they talked, he received a text message from Kim, asking \"Geneva\" to go back to the studio. As Henry complained about it being his day off, Katie said, \"Welcome to show biz!\"\n\n\nHenry called Kim, and, using his Geneva voice, he tried to get out of making an appearance at the station. Kim reminded Geneva that her contract stated that she had to be available any time the show needed her to shoot retakes. \"Geneva\" told Kim that she would be there. Henry hung up and deliberated about what he should do. Katie told Henry he should forget about the taping and stay at the hospital for Vienna's sake. Henry asked if Katie would ever stand up to her boss like that, and she replied that she was too professional to do that. Henry said that perhaps Geneva wanted to be a professional, too, but Katie retorted that Geneva would do anything Henry told her to do, since Henry was Geneva.\n\n\nThe nurse entered the room to let Katie know that her tests had all been negative. Henry asked about Vienna, but the nurse said she wasn't back from the MRI yet. After the nurse left, Henry begged Katie to stay at the hospital to wait for Vienna, so that he could find some clothes to wear and go to the studio to work. Katie tried to say no, but Henry didn't let her, and he left.\n\n\nWhen the nurse took Vienna back to her room, Vienna found Katie waiting there. Vienna asked Katie why she was there, and Katie told her; Katie then asked how Vienna was. Vienna replied that her back was in bad shape, and she asked whether Katie had seen Henry. Katie had to tell Vienna that she wasn't sure where Henry was.\n\n\nBrad waited anxiously at the studio with Kim, complaining that Geneva was unprofessionally late. Kim said that Geneva was still new to TV, and because Geneva was a \"ratings rocket,\" they would \"ride her as long as we can.\" Brad asked Kim to find another way to put that, and Kim agreed, smiling. Geneva arrived, exclaiming about the hot weather, and said she was ready to reshoot the segment on fish oil. Kim told Geneva and Brad that she had changed her mind, and they weren't going to film the fish oil segment, after all. Instead, she had something more interesting planned, but she didn't want to tell them what the subject was until the cameras were rolling.\n\n\nKim stood between the two and counted down the segment. When the cameras began rolling, she announced that the segment was about \"sex after 40.\" Brad laughed and tried to stop the filming, but Kim let it continue. Brad told Geneva that the segment was perfect for them, \"Because I've never been over 40, and you've never had sex!\" Geneva assured Brad that she was indeed familiar with her sensual side, and in fact, she stated that sex after 40 was better than before, because she was so familiar with her body and a man's body. Brad suggested that Geneva sounded like a \"cougar,\" but Geneva replied she was a lioness, and she proceeded to roar. She encouraged Kim to roar, and Kim, who was enjoying the segment immensely, humored her by roaring, too.\n\n\nAfter that, Kim called, \"Cut!\" and Brad realized that everything they'd just said had actually been taped. He was shocked that Kim wanted to air the segment, but Kim thought it was ratings gold and that women all over Oakdale would be roaring after they saw it. Brad then stared at Geneva and said he couldn't believe he hadn't realized it before. Henry/Geneva looked very nervous, wondering if Brad had figured out who Geneva really was. Brad said he had been missing the obvious, which was that Geneva had a thing for him. Geneva was floored and insisted it wasn't true, but Brad was equally insistent that it was. Brad reminded Geneva that he was happily married, but he said he was sure there was someone out there for Geneva.\n\n\nThat made Henry remember that Vienna was waiting for him, and he left the studio quickly. He called Katie and found out that Vienna was okay, although worried about where Henry was. Katie told Henry that he had to spend some time with Vienna, because Vienna was concerned that Henry might be having an affair. Henry told Katie that he had to change clothes, and Katie said she would get Vienna home.\n\n\nHenry went to Brad and Katie's house and let himself in. After he made sure that no one was there, he began to take off his Geneva dress, but Brad walked in suddenly. Brad was stunned to find Geneva Swift in his house, undressing herself. Henry, trying to cover quickly, told Brad he'd been right, that Geneva did want Brad. Brad was horrified and wondered if Geneva was crazy. He asked her to leave, and Geneva did, telling Brad to let her know if he changed his mind.\n\n\nHenry arrived back at the Lakeview, where Vienna was waiting for him. Vienna wanted to know where Henry had been. Henry made up a story about a demented woman collapsing into his arms and dying at the hospital. He said he had felt that he needed to be there when the hospital staff informed the woman's family of her death. Vienna kissed Henry for being such a sweet person, but she realized there was lipstick on Henry's mouth. Henry quickly said it must have gotten on his mouth when he tried to give the dying woman CPR.\n\n\nThey sat down to watch the segment of \"Oakdale Now,\" but Vienna couldn't stomach it and turned it off. Vienna told Henry that regardless of how her back felt, she was going to the station the next day, to keep Geneva Swift off the air.\n\n\nAt Brad and Katie's, Katie arrived home. Brad asked where Henry was, because he had asked Henry to stay with Katie. Katie didn't answer his question but said that both she and Vienna were fine. Brad then told Katie what had happened during the television show segment and at home afterward with Geneva. Katie laughed and told Brad he was crazy if he thought Geneva Swift was after him, but Brad said he knew what had happened, and he wasn't going to let Geneva get away with it. He left to go to WOAK.\n\n\nKatie called Henry and asked if he had really tried to seduce Brad. Henry told her he hadn't had a choice. Katie said, \"This has to stop.\" Henry, however, insisted that as long as Vienna wanted to be on television, Geneva would stand in her way.\n\n\nBrad went to WOAK and told Kim he was going to file a sexual harassment charge against Geneva. Brad told her about finding Geneva in his house. Kim said she couldn't believe it, but Brad said he knew that the victim in a sexual harassment case got the benefit of the doubt, and he would tear the station apart until justice was done.\n\n\nAt the shipyards, Paul encountered Meg as he was leaving the Grimaldi Shipping area. Meg was with a friend from the hospital named Pam. Meg informed Paul that Pam had invited her and Eliza out on Pam's boat, and Meg asked Paul what he was doing there. Paul dodged the question by asking Meg if she was sure it was safe to be in the area, since Dusty had tried to blow up one of Damian's ships. Meg said that she was certain it was safe and that her visit had nothing to do with Damian. Paul turned to leave, but almost ran into one of Damian's employees, who had previously seen Paul the day Paul cut the fuel lines. The man looked at Paul and asked, \"Don't I know you?\" Paul said, \"I don't think so,\" and quickly returned to Meg's side.\n\n\nMeg's friend discovered a crack in the hull of her boat, so Meg's sailing trip was cancelled. Meg was disappointed, but Paul pointed out that it was better that they found out before they set sail, or they would have ended up in the water. Meg glanced at Eliza and realized that the baby was beet red. Horrified, Meg told Paul that she hadn't put any sunscreen on the baby, because it wasn't a sunny day, but it appeared that Eliza was sunburned. Paul tried to reassure Meg that she wasn't a bad mom, and he offered to take Eliza to his car and turn on the air conditioning to cool the baby down.\n\n\nBonnie met Dusty at the Lakeview and told him that her meeting with Damian hadn't gone very well. Dusty expressed his disappointment that the only thing he could get out of Damian would be a monetary settlement, telling Bonnie that it wasn't very satisfying. Bonnie told Dusty that if he wanted satisfaction, he should buy a puppy. Bonnie then stated that even if Damian had cut his own fuel line to set Dusty up, as Dusty believed, it would be difficult to prove such a thing in court. Bonnie didn't think that made any sense, and she told Dusty that she had some ideas about who might actually have committed the crime.\n\n\nBonnie arranged for a sketch artist to meet with her and Dusty at the Lakeview, and she also arranged from the shipyard employee who had spoken to Paul to meet them there. The man said he hadn't actually seen someone cut the fuel line, but he had spoken to a man just before he discovered that the fuel line had been cut. Bonnie asked him to describe the man to the sketch artist.\n\n\nDamian went to Lily's house and told her that Dusty was suing him for the money Worldwide had supposedly lost after Damian allegedly stole Dusty's laptop computer. Damian reminded Lily that he had already tried to make peace with Dusty, but Dusty had thrown it back in Damian's face. Damian told Lily that he saw no other choice but to destroy Dusty \"once and for all.\" Lily warned Damian that Meg wouldn't like it if he went after Dusty, but Damian said that Meg had made it clear that she didn't want anything to do with either Dusty or Damian anymore. Damian told Lily that it no longer had anything to do with Meg, and he wasn't going to let Dusty destroy a business that the Grimaldi family had spent generations building.\n\n\nLily reminded Damian that Worldwide was her family's business, and the business deal they had lost because of the perception that the company was unable to keep its data secure had represented a big loss for Worldwide. Damian told Lily that he hadn't stolen Dusty's laptop, and he reminded her that even she had agreed that he wouldn't be stupid enough to stash it in his hotel room if he had stolen it. Lily said Dusty wasn't stupid enough to cut a fuel line on one of Damian's ships, either. Damian asked who else would have done it, and Lily replied, \"That's what we need to find out.\"\n\n\nLily took Damian to the Worldwide offices, where security had downloaded video from the day that Dusty's laptop had been stolen. From the video, they could see that Paul had impersonated Damian. Dusty and Bonnie arrived, and Damian told them that he knew who had taken Dusty's laptop. Dusty held up the sketch artist's drawing, which clearly showed Paul Ryan, and said that they knew who had cut the fuel line, too. Damian and Dusty realized what Paul had done to both of them, and they both wanted to go after Paul. Lily told them not to, saying they should go to the police instead.\n\n\nNeither Damian nor Dusty wanted to wait for the police to handle the situation, but Bonnie told them that with the evidence they had and Paul's history of mental and criminal activity, Paul would be locked up until a trial could be held. Reluctantly, the two men agreed to go to the police together and to drop the lawsuit and criminal complaint they had against one another. Dusty, however, wanted to visit Meg first, to warn her about what Paul had done.\n\n\nLily and Bonnie went to Metro to wait for word from Dusty and Damian about Paul. Lily thought that Damian had agreed to go to the police to please Meg. Bonnie asked whether Lily thought that was why Dusty had agreed, but Lily said she wasn't sure. Lily realized that Bonnie liked Dusty, and Bonnie agreed, saying it wasn't the smartest thing she could do. Lily said that being smart didn't have anything to do with it and that she thought Bonnie would be good for Dusty, although whether Dusty would be good for Bonnie was another question.\n\n\nPaul and Meg took Eliza back to the farm and cooled her off. Meg was still upset with herself for letting her baby get overheated, but Paul was very supportive. He told Meg that he would keep trying to show her that he was on her side and Eliza's side. Paul and Meg heard the screen door opening, and Paul looked out and saw Dusty on the porch. He offered to handle Dusty for Meg while she took Eliza upstairs. Meg gladly agreed and went upstairs with the baby. Dusty was surprised when Paul opened the door. Dusty asked for Meg, but Paul informed him that Meg didn't want to see him.\n\n\nDusty gave Paul a hard time, but Meg walked into the kitchen and told Dusty that Paul was right. She asked Dusty to leave, and he did, telling Paul to enjoy his situation while it lasted. Dusty left and went to find Damian. He told Damian that Paul had stopped him from talking to Meg. Dusty then said that Paul always got away with things when the police were involved, using his insanity to walk away from any punishment. Dusty thought that he and Damian should take care of Paul themselves, and Damian agreed. The two men shook hands on it.\n\n\n",
