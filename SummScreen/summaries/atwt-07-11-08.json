When Brad and Katie arrived to pick up Liberty, she told them Parker didn't want to talk to her since Jack and Janet had hooked up. Brad was stunned and angry to hear that Jack and Janet were having sex. \n\n\nBrad asked Katie to take Liberty home while he went to find Jack. Liberty told Katie that Parker thought the situation meant they couldn't have a relationship. Katie wondered whether Liberty and Parker had kissed, and Liberty said, \"What if we have?\" Katie said then they would have a problem, because Parker was younger than Liberty. \n\n\nKatie told Liberty why she thought it would be a bad idea for Parker and Liberty to have more than a friendly relationship, but Liberty pointed out that if the adults in Parker and Liberty's lives could manage to stop sleeping with the stepmoms or ex-wives or brothers, things would be a lot easier. \n\n\nJack ate pie at Al's with Janet, who assured him she knew their relationship was casual. Janet made Jack laugh, and he kissed her. Parker went to Al's and spotted his dad and Janet talking. When Janet waved to Parker, he rushed off. Jack tried to follow Parker, but he had disappeared. Jack went back into the diner, but Brad arrived and said he needed to talk to Jack outside. Outside, Brad told Jack he knew Jack had slept with Janet and that he was making a big mistake. \n\n\nBrad told Jack that he had found out from Liberty, and that both Liberty and Parker knew about it. He said he didn't know which was worse: Janet treating Liberty like a \"gal pal\" and talking about her dating life, or Jack trying to hide his relationship with Janet. Brad accused Jack of being just like their mother, sneaking around pretending to be something he wasn't. Brad left, still angry at Jack. \n\n\nJack went back into the diner and asked Janet why she'd told Liberty about them sleeping together. Janet claimed she hadn't, but she pointed out that Liberty was a smart girl and had probably figured it out on her own. Janet didn't understand why that was a big deal, but Jack said he hadn't wanted Parker to know about his relationship with Janet. Jack excused himself and left the diner. \n\n\nLiberty climbed up to the second floor of Carly's house and climbed in through Parker's window, but he wasn't in his room. However, she heard Jack come in and call Parker's name, and Parker answered from downstairs. Jack sat down with Parker to talk about the fact that Jack was seeing Janet. Jack told Parker it was no big deal, but Parker pointed out what a big deal Jack had made about him kissing Liberty. Parker said that kissing someone was much less of a big deal than having sex with someone. \n\n\nJack said of course, sex was a big deal, but he and Janet were being responsible and both knew what they wanted out of the relationship. He tried to let Parker know that while neither he nor Janet was looking to get married, Jack respected Janet and wasn't going to do anything to hurt her or their kids. Parker asked what would happen when Jack broke up with Janet, because that could affect him and Liberty. Jack said at Parker's age, he and Liberty might not even be talking to one another in a few more weeks. Parker said he hated hearing references to \"at your age,\" and he wanted to be grown up and able to live his own life for a change. Jack told him not to be in such a hurry, and he went to warm up dinner for Parker. \n\n\nBrad went home and told Katie he had shoved Jack around a little, but he didn't think Jack was going to stop seeing Janet. Brad said Janet should be setting a good example for her daughter. Katie said Janet was Liberty's mother, and there was nothing they could do about it, but Brad said they could get rid of Janet. \n\n\nBrad and Katie went to the diner to talk to Janet. Brad began by saying he and Katie appreciated Janet's help in getting Liberty transitioned to becoming part of their family. Brad then said they thought that since Liberty was settled in, Janet should move on with her life. Janet said she was doing that and was really enjoying herself, but she saw the looks on Brad and Katie's faces and realized Brad was upset about her and Jack. \n\n\nJanet said her relationship with Jack was just about sex, and Brad said that was the problem, because Janet needed to set a good example for Liberty. Janet pointed out that she had raised Liberty on her own, so she was angry that Brad was implying that she suddenly wasn't good enough for her own daughter. When Brad said he could no longer pay for Janet's room at the Lakeview, Janet said she could see that Brad and Katie wanted her to leave town, and if that was what they wanted, she would leave. \n\n\nJanet called Liberty, who was still in Parker's room. Liberty turned off her phone when it rang, so Janet left a message asking her to call as soon as possible. Janet then called Jack and asked if he had seen Liberty. He said no and asked if Janet had been crying. Janet admitted she had, and she told him Brad and Katie had asked her to leave town. \n\n\nParker went to his room and found Liberty there. Liberty said she knew Parker didn't want to talk, but she did. She told Parker that no matter what happened with their parents, she didn't want Parker to break up with her. Liberty said their dysfunctional parents had nothing to do with whether or not they were together. Parker asked why they were together and whether Liberty even liked him. She told him to come sit next to her and find out. When he did, she kissed him. \n\n\nJack went to Janet's hotel room, where she was busy packing. She told Jack she had nowhere she could afford to live in Oakdale that would be decent and safe enough for Liberty. Jack told Janet she could go to the farm with him; she said that would be terrific for one night, but Jack said, \"To stay.\" \n\n\nLily and Carly talked on the phone before Lily's dinner party. Lily encouraged Carly to relax and enjoy her dinner date with Neal. Carly hung up the phone when her doorbell rang, but it was Holden, not Neal. Holden told Carly to make up some excuse not to come to dinner, because he didn't know how he and Carly could make it through the dinner party without Lily seeing how they felt about one another. Carly said it would seem really strange to Lily if she suddenly canceled. Holden finally told Carly to do what she had to do, and he left. \n\n\nNeal arrived, bringing an orchid for Carly, He could tell she was upset about something, but Carly said it had nothing to do with him. Neal assured Carly that he could make her forget her worries at the dinner. \n\n\nAt Lily and Holden's, Neal told Lily that Carly had mentioned the stables they had. He said he also bred horses, polo ponies in Argentina. Holden said he had no respect for polo or anyone who played it. Neal said he played and asked if that meant Holden had no respect for him. Holden agreed that it did. Holden then went off on a rant about how abusive the sport of polo was. Carly interrupted and told Lily she had just remembered that she had to be at Metro, so she and Neal excused themselves and left after thanking Lily for inviting them. \n\n\nLily angrily asked Holden what had gotten into him, and Holden said Neal had started it. Lily wondered why Holden had taken such an immediate dislike to Neal, until she realized it was because Neal was dating Carly. Lily accused Holden of acting on Jack's behalf, because any man with an accent reminded Jack of Simon, and Jack didn't want Carly getting involved with someone like that again. Holden apologized, and Lily told him to go apologize to Carly and Neal, because he had embarrassed Carly. \n\n\nCarly took Neal to Metro to have dinner and drinks. Neal asked if Holden was always such a hothead, and Carly said Holden had a lot on his mind recently. She told Neal that Oakdale was a small town, where everyone knew everyone else's business. She said she wished she could get away while two of her kids were at camp. Carly said Jack could watch Parker and Henry could watch Metro, and she could perhaps go to Montana. \n\n\nNeal invited Carly to go to Paris with him for two weeks. He said he had to go to Paris for business, so he would be busy a lot of the time, but Carly could stay in an extra room in his flat, and she could shop and visit museums while he was working. Neal told her that things would either develop between them or not, and if not, they would part as friends. \n\n\nHolden walked into Metro and apologized to Neal and Carly for his remarks. He told Neal he had a lot on his mind and had taken it out on him. Neal accepted Holden's apology, and Carly told Neal that he should go make his phone call. Neal said, \"Splendid!\" and left to make arrangements for the trip to Paris. \n\n\nHolden asked what that was about, and Carly told him she was going to Paris with Neal. Holden asked why, considering Carly barely knew Neal. She said because of the way Holden had acted, it was obvious they needed some time and distance between them. Neal walked up and asked if everything was okay; Holden walked off, obviously upset, and Neal told Carly it almost appeared as though Holden was jealous. \n\n\nCarly told Neal that Holden was related to her ex-husband and that the Snyder men were very possessive. Neal said they should leave soon, then, before Holden could get Carly to change her mind. \n\n\nHolden returned home and told Lily about the planned trip to Paris. Lily was excited and said Carly must really like Neal. She asked Holden why he wasn't happy for Carly, but Holden said he didn't want to talk about it. Holden took Lily and kissed her, saying, \"This is what I want.\"\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
