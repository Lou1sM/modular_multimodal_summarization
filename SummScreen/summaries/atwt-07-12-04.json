Emily and Chris are the first to deduce that the Lakeview hotel's wine cellar is the hiding place for the key.  Unfortunately, after they find the key, they discover that Lisa has unknowingly locked them in the wine cellar!\n\n\nIn the Lakeview dining room, the departure of Emily and Alison leaves Susan and Kim alone with Tiffany Gable, a wedding planner.  Susan loses her temper when Kim presents her with a guest list of over 250, and when Alison returns from her treasure-hunt absence, the wedding planner warns her, \"Listen, honey, I've got some advice - elope!\"\n\n\nDon Creel, Lucy's tattooed kidnapper, calls Craig and demands $1 million for his silence.  Craig agrees, then puts his plan into action.  First he calls Lily in the main house and asks her to bring him some clean towels.  He hangs up the phone, grabs his gun, and leaves, saying to himself, \"Do or die.\"  When Lily comes to the guest house with an armload of towels, she hears the shower running and hears Craig singing, \"Home on the Range.\"  She leaves him a note on his desk and returns to the house.  Lucy arrives at Lily's, and Dusty sneaks into the house to see Lucy after she distracts her bodyguard.  Lily walks in to find Lucy in Dusty's arms.  Dusty leaves after receiving a call from Sally, a waitress at Yo's, who tells him that she followed Creel across the street, where he took an elevator to the top floor of an abandoned building.  Dusty goes to the metro, where he calls Agent Nikki Munson, and tells her where Creel is.  He grabs his gun and rushes out.\n\n\nCraig meets Creel on the rooftop of the abandoned building, and Creel is angry to find that Craig brought only $250,000.  Craig pulls his gun and demands that Creel take the money and leave.  Creel sneers, \"You don't have the guts....You're nothing but a joke!\"  A shot rings out.  Dusty arrives to find Creel dying, but Creel revives long enough to tell Dusty who was behind the kidnapping, \"Lucy's father.\"  Agents Fox and Nikki Munson arrive on the rooftop, where Dusty tells them that he knows who was behind Lucy's kidnapping.  After Agent Fox agrees to give Dusty immunity from the money laundering charges, Dusty warns Hal and Nikki that Creel's partner is still at large and that Creel identified Craig as the person behind Lucy's kidnapping.\n\n\nCraig walks into metro just in time to see Dusty leave, and Craig says to himself, \"I got back just in time.  That was close - too close.\"  Craig returns to the guest house and turns off the tape recorder and the shower.  He destroys the tape and puts it into the wastebasket, then collapses in the chair, asking, \"What have I done?\"  Craig then goes to the main house where he embraces Lucy and promises to support her and to help her and Dusty however he can.  Lily looks on skeptically. \n\n\n",
