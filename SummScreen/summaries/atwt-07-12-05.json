She tells him that she doesn't love Craig and she can't understand why Paul feels the way he does.  Paul tells her he is angry, and Rosanna understands that.  She then tells him that she loves him, she always has and always will.....she starts to ask him if there is any chance at all that he still loves her when the phone rings.  It is Craig, who tells her that Gwen's baby has been born.  Rosanna is obviously thrilled, but Paul then tells her that how he feels doesn't matter any more.  Rosanna agrees that it probably doesn't.  He chokes back tears as she leaves.  When Rosanna gets home, Craig tells her that they can't go see the baby, that Gwen has requested a closed adoption -- but Rosanna convinces him otherwise and the two barge into Gwen's hospital room as she is speaking with the adoption attorney.  The attorney tells them they aren't allowed to be there, but Gwen allows them to say.  She signs the adoption papers and Rosanna hugs her and tells her that no one has ever done anything so wonderful for her.  Later, Gwen seems to regret having given up the baby and gets up to see him in the nursery.  She changes her mind, however, when she sees Rosanna and Craig cooing to the baby.  She even goes back into the hospital room and puts her clothes on to leave.\n\n\nDusty thought the worst was over when he delivered Jennifer's baby, but after putting him safely in the car, he comes back to find that she has collapsed on the cabin floor.  He rushes her to the hospital where it is found that she is hemorrhaging badly.  The doctor tells Dusty to call her husband, that he should be there in case..... As Jennifer is wheeled into surgery, he tells her the baby is fine and that she will be fine.  He tries to call Mike.\n\n\nKatie and Mike kiss outside of Metro and decide they should stop as they don't want the news that they are back together to become public.  However, when Margo and Tom see them cuddle at the bar, Margo goes to Katie and tells her that pretty much everybody will know they're back together now.  Margo doesn't seem happy that they are back together, and is still worried when Katie tells her that she and Mike got back together after Mike and Jennifer broke up.  Margo isn't happy, and Mike notices that.  Katie tells him it's probably just Margo's frustration at the whole family, including Craig.  Just as she says that, Mike's phone rings.  He is not happy to see it's Dusty.  He answers, though, and Dusty tells him about Jennifer and the baby.  Mike panics but Katie tries to reassure him.  As Mike leaves, he tells Katie he will call her - and she tells him that this isn't his fault.\n\n\nCelia is not happy with Casey's reluctance to go through with their \"Virginity Ceremony.\"  He also doesn't want to wear the virginity rings in public, telling her that he wants to keep their private life private from their friends.  Just as Celia talks Casey into exchanging rings, Will shows up and interrupts.  Will laughs when she tells him they are having their \"Virginity Ceremony,\" but they don't notice.  He tells them about Gwen's baby.  They decide it's too late to go on with the ceremony, so Celia leaves.  When she's gone, Will calls Casey a hypocrite.  \n\n\nBack at the neonatal intensive care unit, Craig watches as Baby Kasnoff is wheeled in and placed beside Gwen's baby.  He looks at the ID cards and wonders how he can love a baby that isn't his.......\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Emily runs into Allison who tells her she is leaving town to move to Seattle to be with Aaron. Emily then tells Allison that her and Hal are getting divorced, and she is here with Paul. Gwen gives birth to a premature baby boy, but does not want to see it. She pushes Will away as well. An angry Will later bumps into Celia and Casey about to make their virginity pledge. He informs them that Gwen gave birth, and that she is giving the baby up for adoption. Will's resentment towards Casey is obvious, and once Celia leaves, he comes close to telling Casey the truth, but instead he accuses him of really knowing the truth. Mike and Katie are happily enjoying themselves at Metro, which Margo notices, and they are forced to admit they are back together, but they aren't telling anyone yet. Meanwhile, Jen is in need of emergency surgery due to complications. Dusty calls Mike who is happily enjoying time with Katie. He immediately feels guilty if something has happened to Jen or the baby. Craig erases the message from the lawyer about Gwen giving birth, resentful of this baby replacing his son with Jen, which he is not allowed to see. Rosanna pours out her true feelings to Paul, and it seems that Paul may reciprocate, but her cell phone rings and interrupts them. It is Craig telling her that Gwen has given birth. Rosanna wants to rush home, forcing Paul again to bitterly bury his feelings he has for her. Rosanna and Craig go to the hospital just as Gwen is signing the relinquishment papers for her son. Later, Gwen seems to have second thoughts about her baby, but upon seeing Rosanna gushing over the baby, she sneaks out of the hospital. Later, when the nurse rolls in Baby Kasnoff to the nursery, Craig is excited at his fortunate luck to have both babies' side by side in the nursery. He sinisterly looks at one nametag to another.",
