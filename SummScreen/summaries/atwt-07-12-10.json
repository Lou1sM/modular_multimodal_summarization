    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Barbara's suite at the Lakeview, Will and Gwen watched a wild Hallie run around, and both decided their daughter was not about to take a nap.  They also talked about Barbara's whereabouts, and Will had a funny feeling about the fact that Paul thought their mother was on a cruise.  He decided to talk to Jack about it, so Gwen took Hallie with her and said she would call on her sister, Carly.\n\n\nAt the Worldwide offices, Lily told Craig  that Fran\u00e7oise Pacaud's lawyers were drafting the contracts for the sale of the perfume factory in France.  Craig reminded Lily that it was imperative that Carly never know that Craig's money was involved, but Lily was still uncomfortable lying to her new partner.  They were discussing the deal when Holden walked in and asked what Craig was doing there.  Craig advised Holden to relax, and he lied that he was just offering some financial compensation to Lily for taking Gabriel into her home.  Craig left, as Holden warned Lily against ever taking money from Craig Montgomery.\n\n\nHolden and Lily talked about Meg's situation at a care facility near Iva in Washington, D.C.  Then Holden said that he needed help involving their kids in his wedding.  He was aware that Natalie was away at summer camp with Sage, but Holden wanted Faith and Ethan to participate in the wedding festivities.  Lily agreed and told Holden that he deserved to be happy.  Holden took her hand and said, \"We both do,\" and he thanked her and left.  \n\n\nCraig returned and noticed that Lily was quite shaky.  He said he had \"just the thing\" to get her back on her feet.  His idea was for Lily and Carly to go to New York City together and sign the contracts for the factory, and have a bit of fun, as well.  Craig convinced Lily that he would not sabotage his own plan by showing up there, so Lily promised to call Carly.\n\n\nJack delivered Sage and Natalie to summer camp and then reported back to Carly.  He also wanted to have a conversation with her about where they stood in their personal relationship.  They were just making plans for that when an excited Molly burst in, so Jack said he would take a rain check, and he left the cousins to talk.  Carly was hopeful that things would work out for her and Jack, and then the conversation switched to Molly's wedding plans.  Molly said the nuptials were going to be \"big, maybe too big.\"  She felt somewhat guilty being so happy after everything that had happened in the past few weeks, but Carly affirmed that somebody had to have a fairy tale ending.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and Carly was ecstatic to see Gwen and Hallie on her porch. Molly left, so Carly and Gwen sat on the couch and caught up, while Hallie played beside them.  Carly explained that somehow she and Jack kept \"missing the mark\" every time they tried to get together.  Gwen was supportive, and Carly said she had decided to concentrate on her new fragrance business with Lily and just let romance take its own path.\n\n\nWhen Jack returned to the police station, he found Will waiting for him.  They hugged, and Will said he was worried that his mom was perhaps missing.  Jack listened to the young man and then commented that Will reminded him very much of Hal, who always had good instincts and knew when something felt \"off.\" Jack promised to look into Barbara's absence.  Later, Gwen and Will returned to Barbara's suite and talked about his mother.  Hallie threw her ball under Barbara's couch, and Gwen got on the floor to retrieve it.  She found Barbara's passport there, and she asked Will how his mother could be out of the country without her passport.\n\n\nMolly returned to the farm and found Holden there with Ethan.  He had evidently talked to the boy about participating in the wedding, because Ethan wanted to know if his mother would be at the ceremony.  When Holden fudged a bit on the answer, Ethan asked why his dad wasn't marrying his mother again.  That question stumped Holden, but he finally answered that he and Lily had decided not to be married any longer.  He added that they still loved each other but not in a \"marrying kind of way.\"  Molly also spoke up and smoothed things over.\n\n\nCarly arrived at Worldwide after Lily's call, and she asked what was up.  Lily said that the factory contracts would be ready the next day, and she suggested that the two of them go to New York and sign them in person.  Carly agreed, and they got excited about having some fun in the \"Big Apple.\"  Carly left to make arrangements with Jack, who seemed pleased about the plan.  Craig returned to Worldwide and was pleased with himself for masterminding the idea.\n\n\nIn the Lakeview lobby, Katie dropped the bomb on Henry that there had never been a baby for him and Vienna.  He didn't understand, so Katie explained that Vienna had never been pregnant since they had lost their baby the year before.  She swore that was true, and defended Vienna's actions as her way of hanging on to Henry.  That made no sense to Henry until Katie reminded him that he had never seen any of Vienna's prenatal tests, nor had he talked to a doctor about her.  Henry finally got it, and he reacted violently.  He staggered to the bar, and Katie tried to convince him that Vienna's heart was \"in the right place.\"  Henry went ballistic and shouted that Katie should stay \"the hell away\" from him, and he ran out.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Vienna begged Chris to keep her secret, but he told her that he doubted she knew the meaning of \"love.\"  Instead he warned her, \"You lit the fuse, and you watch the explosion.\"  Vienna returned to the hotel and cautiously opened the door to her room.  Henry was not there, but he soon walked in, pretending that all was the same.  Henry said that Vienna should not be walking around because of her miscarriage, and he turned down the bed for her.  He sat with her and played along, as Vienna just dug her hole of lies deeper and deeper.  Henry stood to tuck her in, and he discovered Vienna's \"baby bump\" stuffed behind the headboard of the bed.  He showed it to Vienna and asked what it was.\n\n\nVienna jumped out of bed and said she had been looking everywhere for that.  She took it from him and called it a pad for pregnant women to wear in a car to make the ride less bumpy.  Henry grabbed it back and began to lose control.  He said the pad looked like their baby, and because of that, it deserved a name.  He called it \"Paddy,\" and got hysterical, throwing the pad at her and screaming that he knew what Vienna had done.  Henry got furious and yelled that he had given up everything for a baby that had not even existed.\n\n\nVienna wanted to explain, but Henry said he had chosen Vienna over Barbara because he had felt a strong bond of love between them, but he had obviously misread Vienna completely.  What she had done was out of fear and jealousy, not love.  Vienna sobbed how sorry she was and begged her new husband to \"get through it.\"  Then she tried to blame Barbara for pushing her to use drastic measures, but that angered Henry even more.  He called her deception \"an insult\" to the memory of the real child they had lost, and he said he didn't even know who Vienna was anymore.  He yelled at her to shut up, and then he shoved her out and slammed the door.\n\n\nKatie went home and was glad to see Chris waiting for her.  He said he had just refused to help Vienna perpetuate the lie that she had been pregnant, so Katie told Chris that Henry knew everything because she had just revealed the whole scheme.  She was afraid that she had lost her best friend, and she felt bad for Vienna, as well.  Chris reminded her that Vienna had made her own choices and therefore had to deal with the consequences.  Katie felt awful, but she answered her phone when it rang.  The caller was Vienna who scolded that Katie had ruined everything.  She sobbed that Henry had thrown her out, but her major concern was that Barbara would show up and steal Henry away.\n\n\nVienna closed by saying she never wanted Katie's help again, and she hung up.  Katie was very worried about Henry, and she was determined to find him.  Chris offered to help, but Katie refused.  She feared Henry might hurt himself, so she took off immediately to look for him.  She first went to his room in the Lakeview and knocked, calling his name.  Henry was in the room drinking, but he kept silent.  He was still very angry at Katie, and he heard her ask him to call her.  Chris showed up then, in spite of Katie's wishes, and Katie began to cry and said she wished she had listened to him in the beginning and taken his advice.  Chris hugged her, and Katie wept.\n\n\nLater, Henry pounded on Barbara's door and called her name.  He implored her to open the door, and Vienna heard him shouting and approached him.  He yelled at her to go away and called her ways of showing love \"horrible and disgusting.\"  Henry also called Vienna \"evil\" and said that he hated himself for ever loving her.  He ran off, leaving a stunned Vienna in the hall.  She later soothed herself with a huge ice cream sundae and vowed to get Henry back.\n\n\nHenry finally called Barbara and left a message telling her that everything had changed, and he loved her.\n\n\n",
