Her best friend has a husband and she doesn't want to watch her destroy her marriage.  The maid tells Margo that she was there.  \n\n\nKim and Susan argue while the wedding planner and Alison stand there in amazement.  The planner tells them that Alison should forget the whole thing, because of how the two Mother's are acting.  After the planner leaves, Alison asks the two of them to please put their problems aside and think about the wedding.  She would like both of them to have a part in planning the wedding and getting Chris and her off to a good start.  Later, Kim and Susan try to work on the wedding together.  Alison tells Chris and Susan, that she knows what is going on between them.  They are both surprised and look at each other in astonishment.  Alison tells them that they went off to get a wedding surprise for her.  She questions Chris as to what it is.  Since the answer given is enough to satisfy Alison, Emily and Chris let the subject drop.\n\n\nChris and Emily were previously trapped in the Lakeview basement after finding the key to the contest.  While down there, they share some wine from off the shelves.  Chris tells Emily that he wants to be a husband like his Dad is, a good role model.  He tells Emily that Hal is one also.

Hal tells Dusty that Craig will do a lot of things but he wouldn't commit murder.  Dusty tells Hal to look at the facts.  First, Lucy is kidnapped on the way to the airport, when she is trying to leave Craig.  Second, she is kidnapped, and therefore cannot leave Craig again. Dusty also tells him about Don telling him with his dying breath that Lucy's Dad was responsible.   Doesn't it make some kind of sense that he could be involved.  After explaining all of this, a report is brought in to Hal.  Hal is forced to tell Dusty that the bullet that killed Don Creole came from Dusty's gun.\n\n\nCraig walks back into the room where he is staying.    He is somewhat dazed.  He begins to envision seeing Don Creole.  Don is telling him that soon everyone will know about him.  Craig receives a knock on the door and it is Hal.  He has come to question Craig.  Craig is playing innocent.  Hal says there was an apparent homicide.  One of the guys involved with Lucy's kidnapping has turned up dead.    Hal wants to know if Craig has an alibi.  Craig asks if he needs one.  All of a sudden, Lily comes in and says that she is his alibi.  He called and had run out of towels so she was bringing some over.  When she got there, Craig was all ready in the shower and singing.  They do not arrest Craig because he has an alibi.  \n\n\nJessica is terribly upset.  Ben tries to reassure her and calm her down.  He figures it is because of the news about the baby, and the wondering if the baby will be all right.    She tells him that he will be the only man she will ever love.  Ben leaves.  A knock on the door brings Doc to face Jessica.  She is guilt-ridden and does not want to see him.  He tells her that he is there for a legal reason and she is his attorney.  Doc finds the book on pregnancy and picks it up.  He starts to question Jessica, who puts him off.  He tells her that Jill is threatening his job.  Doc tells her about the blackmail.  She says to get another lawyer, but gives him a word of advice.  If she has threatened all of these things, she is dangerous.  He better watch out.  Later, another knock at the door brings, this time, Margo.    Margo looks at her, and says, \"You did sleep with Doc.\"\n\n\nLucy calls Dusty.  He is at the police station.  Lucy wants to know why and says she will come down as soon as she can to help him out.  Dusty says not to come, that he will get in touch with her as soon as he can.  He gets off the phone and is then asked, \"what are you going to tell her, if her Father is involved?  How is she gonna feel then?\"\n\n\nHe is at a loss. \n\n\n",
