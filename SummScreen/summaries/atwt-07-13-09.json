She was sure that Hunter had left town, but she only hoped that she would find something that would tell her where he had gone.  She was stunned to find Hunter hiding under the covers of his bed.  He looked terrible and was very angry.  He told her that he neither needed nor wanted another mother, and he particularly wanted nothing to do with her.  Emily said that she only wanted to be Hunter's friend and to feed him something, because he obviously had not eaten recently.\n\n\nAlison called on Larry and chewed him out for having fathered a child he then ignored.  She said that she would never forgive him for allowing his ugly secrets to ruin everything.  Larry explained that Aurora Hunter had been desperate to have a child, but she could not get pregnant.  Larry loved her and offered to help her realize her lifelong dream.  Alison called Larry \"insane,\" and said that Hunter had left town.  Larry said he was sorry, because he had hoped to finally have a relationship with his son.\n\n\nEmily asked Hunter to get dressed while she went outside and called Alison.  She reported that she had found the boy, and Alison was relieved that her brother was still in town.  Emily invited Alison to join them for breakfast, along with Susan, and Alison promised to meet them.  Larry followed her, however, and asked to go along.\n\n\nJack got Sage off to summer camp and went back to the farm.  He was worried about Parker's reaction to Carly's hospitalization, but Janet told him the boy had gone horseback riding with Liberty and had seemed all right.  Rosanna showed up and asked for their help.  She said that Carly was in a bad way, and she needed Jack's help. Rosanna was convinced that her sister needed to go to rehab, but Janet jumped into the conversation and argued that Carly was no longer Jack's responsibility, because they weren't married any longer.  Jack promised Rosanna that he would do whatever was necessary to get Carly some help.\n\n\nJanet was so angry with Jack that she turned her back on him.  Rosanna went outside, and Jack attempted to calm his wife.  He argued that he needed to be involved in what was best for the mother of his children.  Janet referred to Carly's problems as \"a bottomless pit\" and as \"an eruption on Mount Carly.\"  They finally began listening to one another, and ended their discussion with a kiss.  Jack left to catch up to Rosanna.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Craig sat with Carly as she awakened.  He reminded her that she had cleaned out the mini-bar in the limo and had suffered the indignity of having her stomach pumped at the hospital.  Carly apologized for worrying Craig, and she swore that it would never happen again.  She begged Craig to get her out of there, just as Jack and Rosanna arrived.  Carly assured them that she would soon be on her way home, and excused her behavior by claiming that the wedding had overstressed her.  Rosanna urged her sister to tell the truth: she was an alcoholic and needed professional help to stop drinking.\n\n\nCarly became angry and accused Jack of putting Rosanna up to the nonsense of rehab.  When Craig backed up Jack and Rosanna's thoughts, Carly turned on him, as well.  She declared that they had ruined her life.  Rosanna and Jack urged Carly to think of her children, just as the doctor came in to examine his patient.  The visitors went into the hall where Jack asked Craig to convince Carly to go to rehab, while Jack and Rosanna researched possible treatment facilities.  Craig agreed with Jack's plan and went back into Carly's room.\n\n\nCarly was ready to leave, but Craig mentioned that the doctor was concerned about her.  She vowed that she could get through her troubles if only Craig would have faith in her. Carly began to cry about being separated from him if she went to rehab, and she declared that she couldn't bear it.  She was willing to go away somewhere with just Craig instead of to a treatment center.\n\n\nSusan Stewart waited in the Lakeview lounge as Emily and Hunter arrived.  Susan was confused that Emily had brought her assistant from the office to a family event, so Emily dropped a few hints about how \"close\" Hunter was to their family.  Susan wrongly assumed that Emily had done it again and taken up with a much younger man, but Emily soon set the story straight.  She explained how one of her stolen fertilized eggs had been implanted in another woman, and the resulting child was Hunter.  Susan said \"Oh, my God\" and \"Holy Moley\" in quick succession before she demanded to know the rest of the story.\n\n\nEmily warned that her mother wouldn't like what she was about to hear. Larry unexpectedly joined them.  No one was happy to see him, so Alison broke the news that not only was Larry her father, but he was also Hunter's.  Susan immediately jumped on Larry about how she had known he was cheating on her when they were married, but she also had to come to terms with the fact that he had juggled two mistresses.  She told Larry that was as low as a person could go, and then it dawned on her that Larry had used one of Emily's fertilized eggs on Aurora Hunter.\n\n\nSusan apologized to Hunter for not being more enthusiastic about having another grandson, and Larry put in some words about how much he had cared about the boy's mother.  He asked Hunter if he could be a father to him, but Hunter stood up suddenly and announced that he wanted nothing further to do with any of them.  He dashed out, followed by Alison, as Susan launched a barrage of verbal abuse on Larry.  Larry said he had already apologized, and whined that he deserved something in return.  Susan smiled and stood up, going very close to Larry before she applied her knee with great force to his groin.  Emily could not keep from giggling.\n\n\nCraig took Carly to an isolated cabin, and she seemed pleased.  She said the place had something of a honeymoon atmosphere, and Craig proceeded to build a fire.  They kissed in front of the fire for a few minutes until Carly declared that she was hungry and began rummaging through the kitchen cupboards.  In the back of one, she spotted a bottle of red cooking wine, so she dragged out some cans of tomato sauce and suggested that Craig go to the country store they had passed a few miles back and buy some pasta.  Craig wanted her to go with him, but Carly begged off to \"start the sauce simmering.\"  Craig agreed, and left.\n\n\nOutside the cabin, Craig called Janet and told her that he had taken Carly away and that the two of them were working on her \"problem.\"  He asked Janet to pass the word to Jack and Rosanna that he was handling everything.  Janet hung up and cursed at the phone before grabbing her jacket and heading out.\n\n\nInside the cabin, Carly grabbed the cooking wine and opened it.  It smelled terrible, but she eventually tipped it to her lips and began drinking.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Jack and Rosanna began to worry when they learned that Craig had checked Carly out of the hospital over an hour earlier.  Jack was angry that apparently Craig had backed out of their deal and had spirited Carly away on his own.  Janet knocked on the door and delivered Craig's message that he was handling Carly on his own.  Jack was upset that Janet had not found out where the two of them were, and he yelled at her.  Janet felt unappreciated that she had delivered the news in person and gotten shouted at for her efforts.  She was also hurt that Jack was, once again, embroiled in Carly's turmoils, so she stormed out.  Rosanna urged Jack to go after her, and he did.\n\n\nRosanna called Carly, but her sister did not answer.  Carly finished the bottle just as she heard Craig pull up in front of the cabin.  He walked in carrying a grocery bag, but he found no sign of Carly.\n\n\nJack went back to the farm and found Janet taking out her frustrations by pounding dough.  He apologized for his behavior, but Janet said that even if Carly licked her drinking problem, she would still be needy and demanding of Jack's time.  Jack promised to get control of that, but Janet said that, even though she loved him, she could not live with Carly's shadow over their lives.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Alison confronts Larry about what a terrible thing he did and how she will never forgive him, as Larry tries to defend himself. Emily finds Hunter hidden under the covers of his bed in his disheveled room, as she pleads with him to simply join her for lunch (leaving out who else will be there). He finally agrees, as Emily calls Alison to ask her to lunch as well because Susan will be there too. Alison tells Larry what Emily told her and he insists on going too, much to Alison's chagrin. Once at lunch, Hunter is not sure he is keen on hanging out with everyone and becomes angry and bitter when he learns his connection to Larry and decides he wants nothing to do with any of them, as he stomps off. Susan can't believe how Hunter is related to them and how Larry betrayed her again. Meanwhile, Alison goes after Hunter, as Larry, Susan and an anxious Emily stay behind. Larry ridiculously tries to defend himself again and winds up on the business end of Susan's knee to a sensitive area. Alison catches up with Hunter, who is pretty sure that he can't handle this newfound weird connection to them all, but Alison promises him that they may not have the relationship he was hoping for, but she could use a brother. She also promises that this may be very strange, but when the chips are down, they are the people that will be in his corner. Alison convinces Hunter to go back to lunch with her where Emily, Alison and Susan welcome into their family. Rosanna asks Jack for his help with Carly, while Janet is not pleased at all that Jack is smack dab in the middle of this again.
