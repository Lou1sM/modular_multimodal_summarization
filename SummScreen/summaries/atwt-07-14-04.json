Jessica tells her that she went there to plead for her friend.  Margo asks why she found it necessary to hide in the bathroom, if that were the case.  She felt that she did, because Margo did not sleep with Doc.  Margo grabs Jessica and says, \"but, you did.\"  Margo tells her that she remembers seeing the bed rumpled.  On top of that Jessica was seen coming out of the room with her clothes all disheveled and she was flushed.  Margo forces her to admit that she slept with Doc.  She tells Margo how she ended up in bed with him.  It wasn't love, it was frustration and anger.  She was angry and he grabbed her and they took it out on each other.  Margo replies with the fact that it seems like her first encounter with Marshall.  Jessica admits that she feels very ashamed.  She didn't tell Margo, because it is difficult to try to tell someone you care about, something like that.  Margo makes a statement that she is carrying Doc's baby.  She remembers all the phone calls and crying she did when she was trying so hard to conceive.  Margo says, \"what if the problem wasn't yours, but Ben's?\"  Jessica tells her she will go to her grave before she hurts this innocent child or Ben.  Margo calls her more selfish than she ever realized.  Margo turns to leave and walks into Ben as she opens the door.  Margo looks at Ben and says, \"Ben, I am so sorry.\"\n\n\nJordan holds Cabot.  Jennifer brings Cabot an early birthday present.  It is a bear for his first (1st) birthday.  He also gives Jennifer a gift.  It is plane tickets.  They will use them after everything is settled and then he can show her how much he cares.\n\n\nCarly and Jack plan to spend the evening together.  Rosanna interrupts their cozy plans, saying that she needs them at Barbara's for a party that night, not for her, but for Cabot.  Carly asks what Barbara has to do with Cabot.  Rosanna says she doesn't know yet, but, she wants to keep Cabot safe.  Rosanna tells Carly and Jack all about the suspicions they all have about James.  They are all on the lookout but she would feel better if they would attend the party with her.  They agree and Jack even says that he will have a patrol car in the area.\n\n\nWalker enters and sees Barbara preparing for the party.  He tells her to calm down and the party will be a huge success.  Barbara is remembering James' comments from behind prison bars, that she should stick around and enjoy the ride.  If she knew everything, life would not be worth living.  Walker gets her attention once again, and asks her about Paul.  The doorbell rings and it is Paul and he has brought someone with him.  A security guard named Sean, who is going to check the place out.  That whatever madness Barbara has planned, he will be there to see it doesn't happen.  Barbara starts to speak up when Walker suggests that Paul and he show Sean the place and everyone can feel safer and more secure.  The phone rings as they leave the room.  It is James and he tantalizes Barbara about her party.  He speaks in riddles about what he has planned.  He hangs up leaving Barbara frustrated.  Barbara goes to the door, once again, to greet some more of her guests.  This time it is Jennifer, Jordan and Cabot.  Later, Rosanna arrives and behind her enters Jack and Carly as a stunned Barbara looks on.  Rosanna apologizes but says that under the circumstances she felt it was necessary for Cabot's protection.  As the evening wears on, Rosanna places Cabot in a bassinet, as Walker prepares to toast Barbara.  Barbara has told Jack that she is in no way involved with what has happened to Cabot recently.  Jack tells her that if she is, he will hang her.  Barbara thanks Walker for all the nice compliments and the toast.  She tells everyone that he is the man who is making all her dreams come true.  Suddenly all the lights go out, and Rosanna screams.\n\n\nHal tells Nikki that she made the assumption that Dusty was telling the truth about what happened.  He was found standing over Creole with the gun that killed him.  Dusty reminds Hal that he told him he was going back to the club to get the gun in case he needed to protect himself.  Why would he call if he was going to shoot him?  Besides, says Dusty, we all know who did it.  Lucy bursts into the room where Dusty is being questioned.  Lucy asks Dusty how he is.  He tells her that he did not want her down there.  She says she had to because he is in trouble.  Lucy wants to know what this is about.  Was it Don Creole?  She says he was dangerous.  Lucy offers to get Dusty a lawyer, but, he refuses.  Hal asks Lucy to leave so that he can talk to Dusty alone.  Dusty tells him that Craig hired Creole to kidnap his daughter.  Creole admitted that to him before he died.  Then Craig shot him.  Lucy, outside the office, tells Nikki there are a lot of people that knew about the gun being in the club.  Inside, Hal tells Dusty he has to hold him until everything can be cleared up.  Dusty tells Hal to keep Lucy safe and away from her Father.\n\n\nWade, (Creole's other partner) comes to Craig's door.  Wade tells Craig that Creole is dead and Craig killed him and now he is going to pay.  Wade wants the money Craig was going to pay Creole.  Lily knocks at the door and needs to speak with Craig.  Wade hides, and Lily enters.  She tells Craig that Sierra is on her way, and, that Lucy is down at the police station with Dusty.  She leaves and Wade tells him that because all the money wasn't there, he now owes him $2 million dollars.  He has 48 hours to get it.  He leaves Craig in a pretty big heap after throwing some punches his way.  He vows to tell Lucy about her Father, if he doesn't get what he is owed.\n\n\nBen is having a conversation with Jill at the club.  He wants to set up a party for his wife.  Jill hands him a menu and wine list and when she notices Doc come into the room, walks over to him.  She asks if he is there to see her.  Doc tells her that her letter to Kim cost him, his job, and his last warning to her, is to stay far, far away.  Not to be intimidated, Jill turns to Ben and asks him if he has heard the latest gossip about Doc having a very steamy affair  with a red headed law enforcement officer by the name of Margo Hughes.  Jill's boss, comes out and  tells her to get her things and get out before he calls security.  She's fired!!!  Doc turns to Ben and apologizes for her outburst.  He hopes Ben will be discreet.   Ben tells him it is a little late for being discreet.  Tom all ready knows and now half the club does too:  It's a small town and news travels fast.  When you make a sport out of going after other men's wives, it isn't just the women who get mad.  Jill confronts Doc as he is leaving.  She blames him for losing her job.  She tells him he will pay the price for everything.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Margo confronts Jessica, who scrambles to cover the truth. Eventually, she is forced to admit that she slept with Doc. Margo realizes the baby could be Docs and is furious that Jessica intends to deceive Ben as well. Meanwhile, Ben witnesses Jill go ballistic, blabbing to everyone who can hear details about Doc and Margos affair. Jill is fired because of her actions and vows revenge on Doc. Later, Ben comes home and Margo seems ready to expose the truth. Wade threatens Craig, blackmailing him for twice as much money and giving him half the time, and noting he could rat him out about shooting Creel. Meanwhile, Hal remains suspicious of Dusty while both Dusty and Nikki fear letting Lucy learn the truth. Later, Lucy asks Dusty who is framing him for murder as Dusty debates whether or not to tell her his suspicions about her father. Everyone comes to Barbaras celebratory dinner but Jack and a security guard are there to prevent anything from going wrong. During dinner, James contacts Barbara and calls her on her true motives. Later, Jack warns Barbara not to get into trouble. Meanwhile, Rosanna confides in Carly that she and Paul are growing closer. At the end of dinner, all eyes are temporarily diverted from Cabot by a toast and the lights go out.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Margo gets the truth from Jessica and then deduces that the baby must be Doc's. Dusty reassures Lucy that he didn't kill Creel (his actual name, I'd been identifying him as Creole) and when she presses him for who did, he keeps mum. Creel's partner Wade shakes down Craig, giving him 48 hours to come up with 2 million dollars or he rats him out. Roseanna brings Jack and Carly along to Barbara's dinner party and Paul hires a security guard. Jack tells Barbara that if anything happens, he's going to track everything down and pin it on her; a worrisome threat, because James called her just before the party started and told her something was going to happen. Just as Walker is about to be toasted by Barbara, the lights go out.",
