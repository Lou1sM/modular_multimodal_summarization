Mike is angry, thinking it might be Simon, but Carly comes out with a bottle of champagne she's brought over to help them celebrate their return to Oakdale. They fill Carly in on their cruise ship adventures with Simon, and then she tells them she has sad news to share with them, and she fills them in on Jennifer's illness, in-hospital marriage to Dusty, and death. They are both shocked to hear the news, and when Katie leaves the room, Mike tells Carly he has to leave to run an errand, and he asks her to wait with Katie for his return. Mike goes to the Lakeview and meets Nancy downstairs; he had called her from the island and asked her to help him buy something when he returned, and she has brought it for him, gift-wrapped. He walks her out, and Simon walks up to the bar and orders a drink, telling the bartender to \"put it on my monthly hotel tab.\" Meanwhile, Carly and Katie chat, and Carly tells Katie that things are even worse now between her and Jack than they were when Katie left, but she's okay with being on her own and is going to start a new business. Mike returns, and Carly leaves. Mike tells Katie that hearing about what happened to Jennifer made him realize how precious every moment is, so he rushed out to take care of something he had planned to do eventually now that they've returned. He hands her the gift-wrapped box and tells her to open it; when she does, she sees it's a wedding ring. He tells her it's exactly like the ring she lost, and he loves her and doesn't ever want to lose her. Katie cries, and they kiss.\n\n\nUpstairs at the Lakeview, Dusty asks Barbara to watch Johnny for him because he has to go out; she asks if he's going to Emily's hearing, but he says he's not going anywhere near there. Barbara calls Paul and tells him the news, saying this means Emily will either get jail time or be sent to a mental institution. Meanwhile, Dusty goes to the cabin where Emily held him hostage, angrily kicking at the chains she used to bind him and remembering how cruel she was to him, saying, \"She deserves whatever she gets!\" As he becomes even angrier, he feels a hand on his shoulder and turns to see a vision of Jennifer, who asks him what he's doing there. He tells her he's remembering how they were robbed of time together, and she tells him that's a waste of his time, that he should remember instead all the time they did have together and \"let this go\" and \"move on,\" for Johnny's sake and his own. They kiss, and then her apparition fades from view.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Meg comes to meet Paul, telling him that even though they fought, she is totally committed to him. They go into the courtroom, where Cass Winthrop is serving as Emily's attorney and Tom Hughes is the prosecutor. Henry arrives in the courtroom, but Susan tells him to leave, saying he can't do anything but hurt Emily's chances at the hearing. Henry asks Emily if she wants him to leave, and she sadly says that it might be better if he does. Angry, he storms out of the courtroom. The judge comes in, and he asks both attorneys to give their opinion of the psychiatric reports on Emily; Cass says they only prove that she's better now, not what mental state she was in when she committed the kidnapping. The judge asks Emily to tell the court how she got to this point, and she says it started when Paul suddenly called off their wedding, that something inside her snapped and she became someone she didn't recognize anymore. She mentions how sorry she is about what happened and brings up the fact that she saved Jennifer's child's life by risking her unborn child in an experimental medical procedure to harvest stem cells. The judge asks Emily if she's made any arrangements for the care of her baby in the event she can't be there to care for the child, and Paul stands up and says that he's the baby's father and intends to file for sole custody and raise the baby in a loving and stable home. The judge says he needs time to reflect on all of this, but when he returns, he tells Emily that although it's clear she is sincerely remorseful and that she did a very good thing by saving Johnny's life, regret and good deeds don't negate the criminal charges of kidnapping and attempted murder, and therefore, his ruling is that she must enter a plea in the criminal case and be remanded back into police custody. Cass asks for a moment to confer with Emily regarding her plea, and he tells her that Tom has offered a deal whereby Emily will get just 10 years (perhaps less, with good behavior) of prison time if she pleads guilty. Emily is devastated but eventually tells Cass that she supposes she has no choice but to accept the plea bargain. Meg and Paul leave the courtroom. Dusty walks up; Paul tells him he's too late, the judge has made his decision, and that Emily will have to pay for what she did. Dusty barges past them into the courtroom, and when the judge asks, \"Who's this?\" he responds, \"I'm the victim here. And I want to be heard!\"\n\n\nAt Crash, Casey and Lia are waiting to talk to Margo about the fire; Lia tells Casey that she saw Maddie shortly before it started and suspects that Maddie got jealous seeing her with Casey and deliberately set Lia's sweater on fire. Casey begs her not to mention this theory to his mom, and she agrees to keep it to herself. After Margo questions both of them, with Lia keeping her promise, Lia leaves, and Casey asks Margo if he can talk to her as his mom, not a cop. She agrees, and he tells her he's worried about how Maddie has been acting, and then he tells her Lia's theory of what happened to start the fire. Margo tells him that Maddie has some problems that Casey can't be expected to be able to handle, and she tells him not to worry about it anymore, that she'll take care of it.\n\n\nLisa Grimaldi runs into Maddie at Java, telling her that the fire inspector suspects arson in the fire at Crash the night before. Maddie claims that she wasn't at Crash, so she has no idea what happened. Lisa leaves with her coffee, and Jade, who overheard Maddie, asks why Maddie is lying about being at Crash. Maddie denies being there again, but Jade says she saw her there and wants to know why she's denying it. Maddie tries to turn things around, saying that for all she knows, Jade is the one who set the fire, and Jade tells Maddie not to mess with her. They eventually agree to keep their opinions to themselves, but Jade tells Maddie, \"If you ask me, you're slipping into a scary, dark place, and you should get some help.\" She walks away, and as Maddie tries to leave, Henry arrives, looking for a shoulder to cry on, but he soon realizes Maddie is in worse shape than he is. However, no matter how hard he tries, he can't get Maddie to tell him what's wrong, and she leaves. Margo arrives, asking Henry if he knows where Maddie is. When he realizes she wants to question Maddie about a fire, he becomes resentful, asking if this is because Maddie broke up with her son. Margo denies that and tells him that something's wrong with Maddie, and because she knows he's a loving brother, he needs to make an effort to find out what it is before she \"acts out\" anymore and things get worse.\n\n\nMaddie goes back to Crash, coming through the kitchen, where she stares into the trash bin that she set on fire. She sees Casey and Lia together again, and as she watches Lia lean over to kiss Casey, she flashes back to her assault, during which she apparently tried to grab a knife off a bedside table; when she comes back to reality again, she is holding a large knife in her hand.\n\n\n",
