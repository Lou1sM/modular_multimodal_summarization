Alison, however, was quick to point out that Hunter was her brother.  Riley was stunned that Alison had not yet told the news to Casey, but Hunter spoke up and said that Casey was no longer part of Alison's life, so the news should not matter to him.  Alison agreed, but Riley mentioned that if Casey knew that Hunter was Alison's brother, it might make a big difference in how Casey felt towards her.\n\n\nMargo asked Casey if he would be joining them for dinner, but he declined when he learned that Riley would be there.  Margo criticized her son's attitude, so Casey blurted out that she had already made it clear which of her sons was the favored one.  They argued, and Casey was very unhappy that Margo would not let him share the information that Riley was Adam with their father.  Margo reiterated that Tom would have to turn Adam in to the police if he knew the truth.  Casey promised to continue to keep the secret, but he said he could no longer love his brother.\n\n\nAt the cabin he had rented, Craig stood in the doorway and shouted for the missing Carly.  When she did not answer, Craig went back in and discovered the empty cooking wine bottle.  He did not notice Carly peeking out from a long cupboard, so Craig pulled out his telephone and walked outside for better service.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Jack told Janet that he was through with Carly and her many problems.  His phone rang, and the caller was Craig, who told Jack that Carly was missing.  Jack was furious that Craig had not checked the cabin for alcohol, but Craig promised to search the area around the cabin for Carly, and he asked Jack to keep his eyes open in Oakdale in case Carly got a ride back to town.  Craig hung up, but Jack told Janet that there was no way that Carly would return home.  Janet was not happy, but she urged Jack to do what he had to.\n\n\nJack left and went to Carly's house, where Rosanna let him in.  Jack told her and a frantic Parker that Carly had disappeared. Rosanna sat down with Parker and explained that the plan had been for Craig to take Carly to a treatment center, but instead he had spirited her away to a private cabin somewhere.  Parker wanted to call his mother, and Rosanna said that it was worth a shot.  Parker dialed and heard the phone ring several times.\n\n\nIn the cupboard at the cabin, Carly heard her phone ring, so she crept out and grabbed her purse.  She saw that it was Parker calling, but she put the phone back in her purse and opened the door and ran straight into Craig, who asked her if she was going somewhere.  Carly said that she had been hiding so that Craig would not be angry when he discovered she had drunk the cooking wine.  Craig told Carly that he was not able to help her as he had wanted, so Carly reminded him how much he loved her.  She begged him not to take her back to Oakdale.\n\n\nCarly began kissing Craig in hopes of distracting him, but he resisted and sat her down on the couch.  Carly closed her eyes and passed out, so Craig picked her up and drove her home and put her on her own couch.  Rosanna was horrified to see her sister in that condition, as Craig explained that Carly had drunk a whole bottle of wine on an empty stomach.\n\n\nRiley went home, so Casey attempted to make another hasty exit.  Riley stopped him by saying that he had news about Alison.  He revealed that Alison and Hunter were siblings, but Casey burst out laughing until Riley reminded him that Alison had been conceived by the in vitro process with one of Emily's fertilized eggs.  Hunter had begun life the same way, except the egg had gone to Aurora Hunter.  Casey said he was still not going to speak to Alison, so Riley called him a \"jerk\" and told his brother to \"man up\" and go talk to her.\n\n\nJack and Parker checked Metro for Carly with no success.  Parker was worried that he would be the next in the gene pool to exhibit signs of alcoholism, and he lamented the fact that he had not gone to boarding school when he had the chance.  Jack assured the teen that Parker was not the reason that Carly had begun drinking to excess.  Jack also complimented Parker on shielding Sage from much of Carly's unpleasantness.\n\n\nCarly awoke and was surprised that she was at home.  She got upset almost immediately and shouted abuse at Rosanna, and announced to Craig that she was leaving, with or without him.  Carly opened the door, and Jack and Parker were there.  Carly swore at Jack, as Rosanna tried to subdue her.  Carly next verbally abused Rosanna again and tried to get Parker to move away from the door.  Parker begged his mother to sit down, and for once Carly listened and complied.  Parker told his mother that she frightened him.\n\n\nJanet knocked on the door and apologized to Jack for how she had been acting.  She asked to help, but Carly began yelling at her to leave and telling her that Carly's life was \"not a spectator sport.\"  Carly got hysterical and ordered everyone out of her house, but no one moved.  Craig spoke up and refused to leave, so Carly accused him of betraying her, and she said some other nasty remarks.  Rosanna jumped in and tried to help, but Carly was bitter and angry and zeroed in on abusing Janet.  Carly tried to make it to the front door, but Parker blocked it and refused to move.\n\n\nParker said some powerful things to his mother about how he had lied to his dad and protected his little sister from her.  Carly promised to get herself under control, but on her own terms.  Parker threatened that if Carly bailed on them, she would never see her three children again.  Janet walked out, and Jack followed her.  They hugged, and Janet said that she finally realized how difficult it had been for Jack to deal with his ex.\n\n\nJack went back inside, and Carly verbally attacked him.  Jack talked about Carly's memories of taking care of her father, Ray, who had been an alcoholic, but Carly claimed to be nothing like him.  As she talked about being afraid to go home from school and other frightening memories, she realized that she was doing many of the same things to her own children.  She admitted having a problem, but she still begged her family not to send her away.  She finally asked what Rosanna wanted her to do, and Rosanna said that Carly needed to let the people who loved her help her.\n\n\nCasey tracked down Alison at the hospital, and he found her still with Hunter.  He asked to speak with her alone, but Alison preferred to stay with her brother.  Casey was less than tactful with his remarks about Hunter's relationship to Alison, so Hunter stepped up and stopped him.  Alison then pulled Casey aside and tried to make him understand that she and Hunter had done nothing wrong before they had realized that they were brother and sister.  She said that if all Casey wanted to do was to make her feel bad about herself, then she wanted nothing more to do with him.  Casey then did one of his classic walk-aways, leaving Alison distraught and Hunter trying to comfort her.\n\n\nRiley was coaching Margo through a recipe when Casey returned home.  Casey thanked Riley for the \"crappy advice\" about talking with Alison, and he reported that their relationship was at its nadir. Riley apologized, and Casey told his mother that Riley's arrival had signaled the end of his relationship with Alison Stewart.  Casey bolted out the door over Margo's protests, and Riley was not far behind him.  Riley went directly to Memorial and found Alison.  He said that he was sorry for sending Casey to her, and Alison said that ever since Riley had been in town, Casey had been secretive.  She asked if Riley knew the reason, but he denied that and urged Alison not to give up on Casey.\n\n\nCarly pleaded again to return to the cabin, but Craig said he could not help her alone.  He shouted that the beautiful woman he had fallen in love with was slipping away from him and becoming a drunk.  Carly sobbed as Craig told her that everyone in the room needed her to return healthy and sober.\n\n\nRosanna packed a bag for her sister, and Craig volunteered to drive her to the rehab facility they had chosen.  A very subdued and resigned Calry kissed Parker goodbye and promised to be back.  She and Craig walked out the door, as Jack watched them from the top of the porch.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Casey is still hurt that Margo won't let him tell his dad the truth about Riley but he promises he will keep his mouth shut about Riley for Margo's sake. Margo can't stand that Casey can't seem to get along with Adam but Adam tells her he has to work out his differences with Casey on his own. Riley tries to bring Casey and Alison back together by telling Casey that Hunter is Alison's brother not boyfriend but his efforts only cause Alison to break up with Casey. Casey can't accept that nothing happened between Alison and Hunter when he saw them together in Hunter's room. Hunter still can't think of Alison as a sister. Carly's family comes together for an intervention and after a long and gut wrenching confrontation between Carly, Jack, Parker, Craig and Rosanna Carly finally accepts that she is an alcoholic and agrees to let Craig drive her to the treatment center Jack and Rosanna found for her. Carly promises Parker that she won't be gone forever and she will return when she is better.",
