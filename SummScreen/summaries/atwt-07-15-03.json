    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy and Aaron were flabbergasted when they discovered that Craig and Rosanna were camped right next to them. After blasting him for ruining their vacation, Lucy and Aaron decided to leave, but Craig said they would, instead. Lucy relented and said they could stay until morning. Rose fainted in Paul's arms once she realized he really was alive. When she awoke, she told him it was a miracle, and said she had felt so guilty. Paul, who had seen Dusty's room key on the floor after she fainted, said she couldn't be too guilty, since she was still having fun. Rose insisted that she was grieving, but didn't want to be alone. Jen flirted with Dusty, until she discovered his identity. She told him Paul was alive, then told him off for hurting her brother. Dusty found Rose and Paul in the elevator. After Rose left, Dusty told Paul that he was glad he was alive, but, no matter what, Rose is with him now. Paul warned him that she could still change her mind, and come back to him. Jen confronted Rose for hurting Paul; Barbara was glad to see that Jen didn't put all the blame on her.",
