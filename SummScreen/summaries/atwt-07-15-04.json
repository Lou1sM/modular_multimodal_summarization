Margo wanted to tell Ben about Doc but decided against it. After Margo left, Ben told Jessica that Jill threw a fit at the country club and told everyone that Margo and Doc were having an affair. Ben said that Doc was probably messing around with a lot of women. Jessica followed Margo to Java and thanked her for not telling Ben the truth. Margo said she did it for Ben. Margo didn't want to hear anymore justifications from Jessica about sleeping with Doc. Jessica warned her that about Jill making a scene at the country club. Margo was incensed. Jessica said that they needed to turn to each other in their time of need, but Margo wanted nothing to do with Jess.\n\n\nCraig worried about how he would get $2 million to pay off the thug who knew he killed Creel. Suddenly Sierra and Lily arrived at his door and Craig said that Sierra had arrived just in time. Sierra wanted to know what he meant by that but he just said that Lucy needed her mother. Alan arrived just then and Craig told everyone that Lucy was at the police station with Dusty. Sierra wanted Alan to come but he didn't want to.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the police station Lucy insisted on helping out Dusty even though he said he didn't need her help. Dusty made Lucy promise to be careful and not trust anyone. They held hands. Dusty refused to tell Lucy that Craig was Creel's killer. Dusty later told Nikki that if they could find out the time of Creel's death it would prove that he hadn't been there when Creel was killed. Lucy talked to Hal about Dusty. She was firm in her belief that Dusty didn't kill anyone. Sierra and Craig arrived at the station and Lucy asked Sierra to help Dusty. Once they left the station, Dusty vowed that he would find a way to prove Craig was guilty for the crime.\n\n\nAcross town there was a dinner party going on at the Lakeview. Barbara and Walker were throwing the party. Carly, Jack, Jennifer, Jordan, Rosanna, Cabot and Paul were present. The lights suddenly went out. When the lights came back on Cabot was missing and Rosanna panicked. Paul tried to reassure her that they would find the baby. Rosanna accused Barbara of arranging Cabot's kidnapping. She attacked Barbara. Paul confronted his mother about her possible role in the kidnapping. She didn't say anything.\n\n\nSuddenly, Rosanna got a phone call from Phyllis, her housekeeper, saying that Cabot was at Fairwinds. Rosanna, Paul, Jordan, Jennifer and Jack raced over to the mansion. Paul said his father, James, was responsible for the kidnapping and pressed Jack to do something about it. Jack was sorry to have to inform them that there was nothing he could do w/o proof. The baby was dressed in a clown costume. Jennifer and Jordan took Cabot upstairs. Jordan said he would do anything - lie, cheat, whatever - to protect his son. Meanwhile, downstairs Rosanna told Paul that he should move out to keep James at bay. Paul said no - they were going to work through this mess together. Just then a man dressed in a clown costume arrived at the door with a card and balloons. They were from James. Paul vowed to protect Cabot.  \n\n\n",
