Casey told her that it was before he'd met Celia, that he and Gwen had both been wasted, and they had both regretted the incident, so he hadn't seen a reason to tell Celia about it. Celia then told Casey to tell her himself that he was actually the father of Gwen's baby, and Casey admitted that it was true. Celia wanted to know what Casey was going to do about his baby. Celia said that even if she could forgive him for having lied to her, she couldn't forgive him for the terrible way he had treated Gwen since then. Casey begged her not to let this break them up, but Celia told him it was too late, that it already had, and she left. Casey then went to the NICU and looked through the window at \"Baby Boy Doe.\" \n\n\nCelia called Will and asked him to meet her on the roof of Yo's, where she said, \"You really care about Gwen, don't you?\" and Will admitted this whole experience had brought them pretty close. Celia then told Will that she knew he wasn't the baby's father, and she asked him to tell her why he'd done what he had done.\n\n\nCarly and Jack argued about whether Iris was telling the truth about what happened with Carly's dad; Carly was convinced that she was lying, and she was suspicious of why Jack was taking Iris's story at face value. Jack begged her to let it go, at least for today, and gave her an envelope full of cash to take to Artie at Yo's for the party later, along with a list of other errands to run that would keep her busy all day. Carly left and called Kim, giving her Iris's name and asking her to look for mentions of her in the news clips from WOAK. At Yo's, Carly ran into Henry, and she told him that she now had a name and had met the woman she'd been looking for and wanted to hire Henry to pursue it further. Henry told her she'd have to pay him first, at which point Carly gave Henry the envelope full of cash. Henry went to Iris's house, where he told her he was going to \"make her millennium,\" while Carly listened from behind a wall. Later, when Jack arrived at Yo's, Artie told him that Carly had been there but hadn't given him any money, and that he had to have the deposit now if the party were to go on as scheduled.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Mike filled out the paperwork for the baby's death certificate, and then Katie told him that someone should tell Craig what had happened. He exploded at Katie and forbade her to tell Craig, saying Craig had no right to know anything or be anywhere near the hospital. Barbara asked Emily what she meant when she said she was so sorry about the baby; Hal then took Barbara aside and explained what had happened. Jennifer came out of her room to find most of her family standing in the corridor looking very sad, and she realized that her baby had died. \n\n\nWhen Barbara saw Mike and Katie talking in the hospital corridor outside Jenn's room, she exploded, telling Mike that the baby's death was all his fault for leaving Jennifer to go to Chicago. Dusty took Barbara aside and made her leave, trying to calm her down. Katie told Mike not to blame himself for the baby's death and to go be with Jennifer, because the two of them needed to share this loss. Mike then apologized to Katie for yelling at her and told her that he understood why she felt Craig should be told, but that he wouldn't be held responsible for what he might do if Craig showed up at the hospital.\n\n\nMike finally went in to see Jennifer, who told him this was all her fault, that she had messed up everything and killed her boy. Mike told her not to think like that, that it wasn't true, and he wished there was something he could say to make things better for Jennifer, but all he could say was that they all loved her, and he loved her, and they would all be there for her, including him.\n\n\nMargo went to visit Craig and was surprised by how happy he seemed and how well he was taking things, since he wasn't being allowed to visit his son with Jennifer. Craig said there wasn't much he could do about it right now except try to be a good father to his adopted son, and he swore to Margo that his adopted son would never feel second-best in his life. Then, Katie arrived, and she told Craig that his son had just died, that he had been too little to make it. Craig wanted to know how \"the mother\" was doing, and Katie said that Jennifer was physically okay but emotionally distraught. Craig asked if Katie was sure it was his son who had died, because hospitals sometimes make mistakes, and Katie assured him it was \"baby boy Kasnoff\" who had died. Craig said that he would go to the hospital, and although both Margo and Katie pleaded with him not to go, reminding him about the restraining order, Craig insisted that a father had a right to visit his dead child and that no judge in the country would disagree with that.\n\n\nEmily told Paul that she felt that she should go home, because this was too hard for Hal, losing his grandson and seeing Emily there, too. Paul insisted it was okay if she stayed, but he told her it was up to her, and Emily left.\n\n\nBarbara kept insisting that she had a right to see her daughter and that Jenn would need her now more than ever. Dusty then told Paul that he thought Barbara was right, that Jenn really might need her mother at this moment, so Paul let Barbara go in to see Jenn. Barbara told Jennifer that she'd talked to the nurses, and Jennifer wanted to know if her son had suffered. Barbara told her they said it was very quick and that he hadn't suffered at all. When Barbara told Jenn she knew how hard this was for her, Jenn remember that Barbara had lost a son, too (with John Dixon), and Barbara said she felt that Johnny was with her every single day, and that Jenn's baby would be, too. She told Jenn that her baby had known her and had known he was wanted, and that he would be with her forever. She also told Jenn that the one thing she most regretted about losing Johnny was that she hadn't been able to hold him and touch him and tell him goodbye, and that she really thought Jennifer should take the chance to do that with her son. Jennifer insisted she couldn't listen to any more talk like that and asked Barbara to leave. But later, when Mike went back to her room, she was gone, because she went to see her baby. When she got to the incubator and looked in, she stopped, shocked, and said, \"No, there's been a mistake --- this isn't my baby!\" In the background, Craig appeared, and he overheard Jennifer's reaction to seeing the baby.\n\n\n\n\n",
