Noah said that he was worried that destroying his film project as part of the catharsis to free himself of his father's influence had compromised his chance to graduate on schedule.  Luke had an idea, and he handed Noah a completed script that he had written previously.  He offered it to his boyfriend, and the two of them got enthusiastic about working together on the film.  The boys went to Old Town, and Luke took the box to their apartment while Noah kept an appointment with his faculty advisor.\n\n\nNoah walked into Java and met with Professor Jarvis, who asked Noah to call him \"Mason.\"  Noah said that he would not be able to continue with the project about Colonel Mayer for personal reasons, but he had a substitute screenplay that a friend had written.  He handed Luke's script to Mason, who gave it a fast read.  Finally, Mason told Noah that he must have owed Luke Snyder either money or a favor when he agreed to shoot the script, because the work was not suitable for Noah's project.  Noah explained that Luke was his boyfriend, and Mason looked surprised.\n\n\nThe professor told Noah that the choice between art and love was an age-old one, but the smart way to go was to choose art.  He asked if Noah had any other ideas, even incomplete ones, and Noah said that he had a single paragraph with a very rough idea on it, and he handed it over.  Mason read the paragraph and was enthusiastic about the kernel of an idea.  He also offered, as Noah's mentor, to flesh out the idea with Noah to a full screenplay.\n\n\nLily visited with Meg at the farm, and she mentioned Paul's involvement with Dusty and Damian.  Emma walked in, and neither she nor Meg knew what Lily was talking about.  Lily said that the recent feud between Dusty and Damian was all Paul's fault.  He had manipulated all the dirty tricks in order to keep his rivals for Meg distracted.  Meg was furious that Paul had fooled her yet again, and she asked Emma to stay with the baby so that she could go and give Paul a piece of her mind.  Meg was already out the door before Emma called out and stopped her.\n\n\nLily said a hasty goodbye, as Meg went back inside.  Emma gave her a lecture about cutting Paul out of her life for good, but Meg said that she needed to do that in person.  Emma encouraged her to let Dusty and Damian handle it, but Meg thought she could finally make an impression on Paul and make him listen to her.  Emma shouted at her daughter to wake up and realize that Paul never listened, but she could not dissuade Meg.\n\n\nDusty and Damian met in the Lakeview lounge, and Damian wanted to revert to the old plan of letting the authorities deal with Paul.  Dusty, however, was afraid that Paul would not serve any jail time, and he wanted to get Paul out of Meg's life for a very long time.  Dusty suggested that they get a bomb and plant it on the docks and blame it on Paul.  Damian was worried that the bomb might actually explode, but Dusty said he had it all worked out and that the police would have plenty of opportunity to step in before there was any danger.\n\n\nDusty did not yet have the bomb, so Damian gave him the name and phone number of a munitions expert and offered to set up the contact.  They agreed that timing was crucial in the operation.\n\n\nPaul and Barbara had tea at Fairwinds, and Paul was in a good mood.  When his mother commented on it, Paul said that he and Meg were getting along much better since she had begun to see Dusty and Damian for what they really were.  Barbara congratulated Paul for finally doing everything right in his life.\n\n\nMeg appeared unexpectedly in the house and announced that her visit was not a social one.  She lit into Paul and accused him of being up to his old tricks again by sabotaging Dusty and Damian.  Paul denied her charges and said that the two half-wits did not frighten him.  Meg declared that Paul had finally trashed whatever chance he had of being part of Eliza's life, and she walked out, declaring that she would never trust him again.\n\n\nBarbara was outraged that Paul had been playing games with other people's lives again, but he said that he did not care if he went to jail.  When Barbara continued to rant, Paul cut her off by telling her that he had learned from the best manipulators in the world: Barbara, herself, and James Stenbeck.  Barbara threatened to take action and not just stand by.\n\n\nLily went home and told Holden that she had advised Meg of Paul's machinations. Luke walked in and announced that he had officially moved out of the family home.  He was also thrilled to tell them that he and Noah would be working together on Noah's senior project, written by Luke.  Lily remarked on how much time that would involve, and Holden asked when Luke would be able to fit in taking classes.  Luke said that he was not going to enroll in school the next semester. When Holden asked why, Luke cited his work at the foundation and Noah's project as too time-consuming.\n\n\nHolden was not happy, but Lily supported Luke's ideas.  Noah walked in and asked to speak with Luke alone.  He sadly told Luke that Professor Jarvis had not approved of Luke's script because of structural problems.  Instead, Mason had offered to mentor Noah and help him complete one of his own ideas.  Noah was sorry, but he suggested that Luke take some classes at the university instead.\n\n\nMeg returned to Emma at the farm, and they began to talk; Damian appeared at the door.  He wished to speak with Meg, so Emma left the room.  Meg immediately apologized and said that she had learned what Paul had done to both Damian and Dusty.  Damian said that he wished everything was over and done with, but he had a confession to make. He told Meg about Dusty's scheme to plant a bomb and frame Paul for it, but Meg wanted to know why Damian did not stick to their original plan that involved the police.  She called the new plan \"madness,\" and Damian assured her that he was backing out of it and was leaving to tell Dusty right away.  Meg asked Emma to watch Eliza again, and she left right behind Damian.\n\n\nAt the Grimaldi warehouse on the docks, Dusty made an appointment to meet the munitions expert.  After that was set up, Dusty next called Paul and asked him to meet him at the same location a bit later.  Paul attempted to ask some questions, but Dusty told him to go immediately to the warehouse.  The munitions expert showed up, and Dusty gave him an envelope filled with cash.  The man then handed Dusty a briefcase, which contained the bomb and a timer.  Dusty asked the man to set the timer and then to instruct Dusty how to turn it off.\n\n\nThe expert warned Dusty that the mechanism in the bomb was very sensitive and asked what he was planning to blow up.  Dusty answered, \"Nothing, if we're lucky.\"  Next Dusty phoned Damian and left a message that Paul was on his way and that the bomb was set.  Dusty reminded Damian that his job was to bring the Oakdale police.\n\n\nPaul entered the warehouse and saw Dusty, and he began negotiating by saying that he wanted his family back and that Dusty and Damian could \"pretty much go to hell.\"  Dusty swore that he would never let Meg go back to Paul, so Paul turned to leave.  Dusty accused him of setting up Dusty and Damian to destroy each other, and Paul grinned and admitted it.  Dusty said he was, therefore, taking the law into his own hands unless the two of them could reach an understanding.  Paul turned his back and started for the door, but just then, Damian walked in, and Paul asked if it was an ambush.\n\n\nBarbara showed up at the farm and told Emma that she wished to speak with Meg.  Emma said that Meg was gone, but she invited Barbara inside.  Barbara said that she had just seen Meg at Fairwinds, and she put in a plea on Paul's behalf for his continued visitations with Eliza.  As a mother, she confessed to Emma that she was recently comparing Paul with James, and she was torn between loving her son and knowing that he had insatiable demons inside him.\n\n\nLuke was dejected and sitting on the couch at home.  He told Lily and Holden that he was no longer on Noah's film project, so he was considering reapplying to Oakdale University and taking some classes.  Holden was elated and went to call Lucinda, whose influence was needed to get Luke back in school.  Lily asked her son what was wrong, and Luke said that he and Noah had decided not to work on the film project together.  Lily thought that was an unsatisfactory response.\n\n\nDamian told Dusty that he had not summoned the cops, and the deal was off.  He said that he could not go through with it, and Dusty realized that Damian had told Meg about their plan and was canceling because of that.  Damian mentioned the bomb, and that horrified Paul.  Meg barged in and wanted to know what was going on.  She yelled at Damian, as Paul threw in some insulting comments.  \n\n\nDusty tired to disarm the bomb, but he could not override the timing mechanism.  Dusty yelled at Damian to get Meg out, and Damian hustled her out the door.  Paul began to understand that the bomb was real, so he grabbed the briefcase containing the bomb and dashed up some warehouse steps.  Dusty backed out of the warehouse as the bomb exploded. \n\n\n",
