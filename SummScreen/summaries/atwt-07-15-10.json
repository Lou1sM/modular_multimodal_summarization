She was horrified to learn that Lily had been in a seedy motel near the airport with Craig Montgomery all night.  Lucinda yelled at Fran\u00e7oise to go save her daughter, and she hurled down the phone.\n\n\nMolly and Holden were on an exercise run through Old Town, and they stopped to talk about their wedding.  A frazzled Lucinda ran up and asked to speak privately with Holden, but he said that Molly could hear anything Lucinda had to tell him.  Lucinda explained that Lily was in New York in a rotten motel near the airport, and she asked Holden to fly on the Worldwide jet to fetch her daughter home.  Molly got in a dig by telling Lucinda that they had heard about the baggage handlers' strike and the blackout the previous night just before they had gone to bed.  Lucinda was disappointed that Holden thought that Lily could manage to get on a private jet by herself, and she remarked that he obviously had better things to do.  Lucinda was disgusted, so she turned and walked off.\n\n\nMolly and Holden continued to Java and talked about Lucinda.  Molly told him that if he wanted to get on that jet to pick up Lily, it was okay with her.  Then she realized the time and remembered that she had to meet the caterer soon and still needed to go back to the farm and shower.  Holden said she was not to worry about their budget, and he said he had a few errands to run for himself.\n\n\nJanet worked in Emma's kitchen and satisfied her weird cravings with a breakfast of cottage cheese and pimento.  Suddenly a painting of Mona Lisa walked through the door, steered by a contrite Dusty Donovan, who was trying to prove how fond he was of Italians.  Janet gave Mona a chair at the table, and she and Dusty spoke about their argument the night before.  Dusty said that Lucinda had called Anthony Blackthorn \"an operator,\" and he was worried that Blackthorn was trying to muscle his way into Worldwide.  Janet, in turn, apologized for getting so ruffled at Metro, and the pair called a truce.\n\n\nA deliveryman knocked and handed Janet a package from the Sweet Tooth, a candy store in Janet's hometown.  There was a note from \"Blackie,\" the name Janet knew for Anthony Blackthorn.  He said in the note that he never forgot a friend, and Janet explained the history of that comment to Dusty.  She said that when she was in middle school, she and some other girls sold chocolate turtles as a fundraiser for the school programs.  One year, Blackie had stolen a box, so the gift was a kind of act of forgiveness.  Dusty refused a chocolate and said he had to go to a meeting, so Janet said goodbye and thanked him for Mona.\n\n\nDusty went directly to Worldwide and asked Lucinda about Anthony Blackthorn.  She said she barely knew the man, but she kept her distance from him.  Dusty explained that Janet had grown up with the guy, and Blackie had sent her some chocolates.  \"No wonder your knickers are in a twist,\" commented Lucinda, and then Dusty said that Blackthorn had claimed that he was doing business with Lucinda.  Lucinda dodged the question for a while, until Dusty said he wanted to put an investigator on Blackthorn to see what he was up to.  Lucinda nixed that, and she cleverly reminded Dusty that Janet did not like it when he manipulated people.  She gave him a hug and said he could do whatever he wanted, but Janet wouldn't like it.\n\n\nNot long afterwards, Lucinda, in a scarf and dark glasses, sat near the elevator bank in the Lakeview lobby.  She intercepted Blackthorn when he walked in, and she urged him to learn to keep his mouth shut.  She told him she knew he had told Janet Ciccone that he was doing business with Lucinda, and Blackthorn said he had only made an offhand comment to an old friend.  Lucinda warned him that Dusty Donovan was asking questions, but Blackthorn's replay was, \"Find a way to distract him.\"\n\n\nIn the New York motel, Craig snored in a chair until he made enough noise to wake himself.  He tried the air conditioning unit, but it was still not working.  Then he noticed Lily, who was sleeping on the bed in her black slip.  Craig took a good look and muttered, \"Mercy!\"  He tried to cover Lily with a sheet, but it startled her, and she warned him away from her.  Lily said she felt the effects of the heat and the scotch they had drunk, and she certainly hoped they didn't have to spend another night in the dumpy motel.  Craig called the airport, while Lily marveled at the fact that she had actually had fun with Craig the night before.\n\n\nCraig learned that the strike had been settled, but all flights were delayed and some were cancelled.  He keyed in their flight number for information, while Lily answered a knock on the door.  When Craig saw Fran\u00e7oise enter the room, he hung up quickly, as their visitor looked carefully at their disheveled and missing clothing.  Fran\u00e7oise pretended to check her messages while Craig and Lily finished dressing, but in reality she was taking photos of them with her cell phone.\n\n\nFran\u00e7oise sat at the desk and handed them the deed for the perfume factory, a list of government rules and regulations, and a large notebook of building inspection reports.  Lily glanced at the reports, and even with her limited knowledge of French, she was able to figure out that there was a problem with the building's water system.  Fran\u00e7oise said that was true, and there were also issues with the sewer system and the electrical wires.  A disturbed Lily asked how much that would cost to fix, and Fran\u00e7oise began referring to them as \"upgrades,\" and said it would probably be another 500,000 euros.  Lily gasped at the price tag, and Craig, who was also reading the reports, asked what would happen if they held off on the \"upgrades,\" and Fran\u00e7oise explained about stiff government fines.\n\n\nCraig caught on that the \"upgrades\" were actually bribes to the inspectors, who were all related to the mayor.  Lily took Craig outside and protested loudly that she could not let him throw that much money around, but Craig was anxious and wanted to begin production as soon as possible.  Lily refused to give in to the extortion, however, and she went back to Fran\u00e7oise and called off the whole deal.  She cited a clause in the contract that called for full disclosure about the condition of the property.  Fran\u00e7oise quietly explained that Lily would run into similar \"upgrade\" problems with any property she bought in that area, so Craig suggested they all step back and look at the bigger picture.\n\n\nFran\u00e7oise gathered up her papers and agreed to have the money returned to Lily's account by the close of business, but then Craig stopped her.  He took Lily outside and cautioned her not to let the deal fall apart.  He was willing to risk his money, and Lily agreed that as her silent partner who was contributing the money, he had the right to make that call.  They returned to the room, and Craig accepted the deal as it stood.  Lily walked Fran\u00e7oise to the elevator, as Craig took a call on the motel phone.  He answered in French and then heard Holden say, \"Craig?  What are you doing in Lily's room?\"\n\n\nCraig gave some dodgy answers, including the lie that he and Lily had met by chance waiting for a cab.  Then he explained about the strike and the blackout, and he told Holden that he and Lily had gotten the last two rooms left in the motel.  He was in her room because they were sharing a cab to the airport in a few minutes. Craig heard the door open, so he hung up in a hurry.  He told Lily that he had gotten cut off talking to the airline, and the two headed to the airport to catch the first flight home.\n\n\nHolden called Lily's phone from the farm, but he got no answer.  Janet walked in and they had a pleasant conversation.  Holden left to meet Molly at the Lakeview for the tasting session, as Janet ate numerous chocolate turtles and tried to figure out how to open a jar of Emma's homegrown pickles.  She looked at Mona Lisa and talked to her baby, until a knock interrupted her.  Her caller was Anthony Blackthorn, who was glad to see that the turtles had arrived. \"Blackie\" told Janet that it wasn't necessary for her to tell Dusty everything he said, but Janet said that no one told her that doing business with Worldwide was a secret.  Blackie perked up considerably when Janet said that Dusty was not her \"boyfriend,\" and he sat at the table and ate a turtle.\n\n\nHolden then went to Lily's and found her just arriving home.  He mentioned Craig and wondered why he hadn't told Lily about Holden's call that morning.  Lily figured out that Holden was doing Lucinda's bidding, so she explained that to her, Craig was like family.  She told a lie about running into Craig in midtown, so Holden challenged her.  Lily barked that her business was none of his concern, so Holden turned around and walked out.\n\n\nHolden found Molly sampling entrees in the Lakeveiw lounge, and he tried to catch up.  Molly recognized that something was bugging him, so she asked him to tell her.  Holden said he had called Lily's room in New York, and Craig had answered.  He also said that Craig and Lily had told different stories about meeting in New York, but Molly said that Lily was way too smart to get involved with Craig Montgomery.  She also mentioned that it sounded as if Lily didn't need to be \"saved\" again, either.  Holden agreed with Molly's choices, and he apologized, as they tasted wedding cakes together.\n\n\nWhen Anthony Blackthorn left the farm, he went to see Craig at the Lakeview.  Craig said he was just back from New York, and he thought he had run across an opportunity they needed to jump on.  He said their involvement would take about 500,000 euros, and he needed it in his account by the end of the day.  Blackthorn said their partnership was starting to get expensive, but he was still in.\n\n\nFran\u00e7oise called Lucinda and caught her in her limo.  She said she had sent Lucinda a photo on her phone, so Lucinda downloaded it.  She was appalled to see pictures of Craig and Lily, partially dressed.  \"How did this happen?\" wailed Lucinda.  Then she called someone and said, \"Darling, it is time to come home.\"\n\n\nLily visited Craig at the hotel and asked if he had something to tell her.  He was stumped, so Lily said she meant Holden's call to the motel in New York.  Craig said he had forgotten at first, but then he had never found the right time to tell her.  He apologized, but Lily said she had had enough.  She was uncomfortable with the whole \"silent partner\" thing, and she was going to tell everyone that Craig was bankrolling Carlisle Fragrances.  Craig said there would be consequences, including Carly's quitting and Lily's having to undergo Lucinda's second-guessing her for the rest of her life.  Lily reconsidered, at least until the company was off the ground.\n\n\n Dusty talked on the phone to a private investigator, and he asked for everything the man could find on Anthony Blackthorn.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lily almost withdraws from the deal with Fran\u00e7oise when she learns it will take three quarters of a million dollars to make repairs to the factory before it is up to code. Craig tells Lily that he doesn't mind paying the money as long as the perfume is produced. Fran\u00e7oise takes a picture of Craig with his shirt unbuttoned standing nest to Lily and sends it to Lucinda phone Lucinda sees the picture on her phone and is determined to save Lily from Craig so she calls someone and tells them its time to come home. Lucinda meets with Anthony Blackthorn and tells him he must be more careful about what he tells Janet because she told Dusty that he was working with her. Anthony advises Lucinda to distract Dusty. Lucinda asks Holden to go pick up Lily on the Worldwide jet because she worries that she may be involved with Craig. Holden tells her he won't do that because Lily can take care of herself.

Lily insists that their relationship is strictly professional. Dusty visits Janet with a framed print of the Mona Lisa to apologize for their fight, but she isn't happy that he is still suspicious of her friend Tony Blackthorn. Dusty is even more unhappy when Tony sends Janet a box of chocolate turtle candy. Dusty calls a P.I. to do a background check on Blackthorn even though Lucinda advised him not to, because it would anger Janet. Anthony advises Janet not to tell Dusty everything he tells her. Janet claims she didn't know that Anthony wanting to work with Lucinda was a secret. As Anthony starts to leave, Janet tells him not to call Dusty her boyfriend, because he isn't; they are still working on their relationship. Tony decides to accept Janet's invitation for coffee and chocolate turtles.",
