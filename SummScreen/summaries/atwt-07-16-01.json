Her cell phone rings and it is Jack and he wants to meet her for lunch.  She tells him that she will meet him at the diner.\n\n\nAt the diner, Paul Ryan and Rose are having lunch together.  Paul is mulling over how he can get the papers that he knows Craig has taken.  Rose asks him if he knows that her sister is part owner in the Lakeview.  Paul says that he knows that, but they don't have time to wait for Lily to get back from Malta.  Rose tells him to close his eyes.  He gets perturb at her but he does what she asks.  After his eyes are closed, she clears her throat and drops her voice and imitates Lily.  After she is done, Paul opens his eyes and tells her that she is amazing.  She tells him that they can go to the Lakeview and she can pretend that she is Lily.  They leave the diner together.\n\n\nCarly walks into the diner and sits down with Jack.  He has ordered for her and she starts to eat.  He asks her about her new designing job and she is vague about it.  He tells her about Craig being back in jail and she goes white.  He adds that soon there will be an Oakdale policeman walking in to give him papers so he can search Craig's hotel suite.  She loses all the color in her face.  She makes up an excuse that she has to go because she has to pick up Parker and she almost forgot.  She makes a hasty retreat.  Soon after she is gone, a policeman comes in and gives Jack the papers to search the hotel suite.  Jack looks at the envelope and says, \"I don't believe it.  Margo came through.\"\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Rose, posing as Lily, and Paul Ryan, posing as a Mr. Dennehy, walk up to Craig's suite with the hotel manager.  He is explaining that Mr. Montgomery has the penthouse now, but he thinks he will be out soon.  Rose thanks him for letting them look at it and he opens the door and leaves the two to look in private.  When the door is closed, Paul digs right in and starts to search for the BRO papers.  Rose tries to explain that she does not make a habit of posing as her sister.  Paul looks at her and she starts to explain that he may hear something later.  He cuts her off when he finds a box of BRO files.  He looks through the box but it is not what he is looking for.  He sees a big envelope on the desk and asks Rose what it is.  She says that it was on the floor in front of the door when they walked in.  Paul sees the note from Carly to Craig.  He looks inside and sees the designs.  He tells Rose that he can't believe that Craig is replacing his mother so quickly.  He tells Rose that she can go, but he wants to stay and search a little more.  Rose leaves and Paul starts to look around.  He can't stop thinking about the envelope from Carly and he goes back to it and looks at the designs.  As he is looking at the contents of the envelope, he sees a letter opener poking through under the door.  He goes to the door and opens it.  Carly is on her knees trying to find the envelope before Jack gets there.  Paul looks at her and he asks, \"Carly Tenney?\"  Carly looks up and shakes her head yes.  He holds out the designs and asks if she is looking for this.  He drops the envelope on the floor, but before she can grab it, Paul steps on the envelope.\n\n\nHal walks into Barbara's room to visit her.  He tells her that he is afraid that she will be scared if she is alone too long.  As he is talking with Barbara, Margo walks in and hears him talking about Barbara moving her hand.  She asks Hal about it.  Hal says that it was small but at least it is something.  Margo is very happy for him and she hugs him.  She asks Hal if she could talk to Barbara just for a minute.  Hal steps away from the bed.  Margo steps closer and tells Barbara that they have not always gotten along.  She adds that she is working day and night to try to catch the person that did this to her.  Margo turns back to Hal.  She tells him that she still doesn't believe her brother did this, but she is building brick by brick a wall of evidence against Craig.  She tells Hal that he has been the only person besides herself that doesn't fully believe that Craig is guilty of this crime.  She asks Hal to please help her prove her brother's innocence.  Hal tells her that he is doing some investigating, but he isn't looking to find Craig innocent.  Margo and Hal walk out of the room together.  As they walk out, Barbara opens her eyes.  She can see Hal and Margo standing at the door and she raises her hand to them.  They don't see her and walk away.  The guard also doesn't see her and closes the door.\n\n\nSimon and Lily are getting ready to go to bed in the villa in Malta.  Simon promises Lily that they will find Holden and Luke.  Lily is in bed and Simon goes to he bed on the floor.  Just as they are turning out the lights, Katie comes barging in and says, \"Ahaa!!\"  She sees Simon on the floor and Lily in the bed and she tells them that she has the wrong room and starts back out the door.  Simon catches her and makes her come back into the room.  Simon and Lily both scold Katie and tell her that she may have put Holden and Luke into a lot of trouble.  She apologizes and says that she thought that Lily and Simon was using this as an excuse to get away together.  Lily gets upset and starts to leave the room.  When she opens the door, the lady that owns the villa is standing at the door, listening.  Lily asks her why is she there.  The lady enters the room and tells them that she can't have two women and one man sharing a room.  It doesn't look right.  Katie starts to ask if she thinks they are going to have a threesome, but Simon interrupts her and tells her to be quiet.  Lily tells the lady that Katie was not invited and she will be leaving.  The lady explains that all the villas in the area are booked up and she can't make travel plans this late at night.  Katie tells Simon that she doesn't have any more money, either.  Lily looks back at the lady and asks if Katie can stay just one night and then she will be gone tomorrow.  Lily adds that she will pay anything.  The lady tells them that she can only stay one night and she leaves.  After she is gone, Simon brings Lily's attention to the lady and she may have been listening at the door.  Lily says that she has always been so helpful.  Katie looks at the two and asks if the lady is involved with the people who kidnapped Luke and Holden.  Simon and Lily look at each other.  Katie asks if they are in danger.  Simon tells her that no one is going to get hurt as long as he it there.  He looks at Lily and tells her that he promised her mother he would bring her home unharmed.  He tells the two women that he will spend the night in the hall.  Katie starts to go out with him.  Simon stops her and tells her that he is going alone.  Simon goes out and closes the door.  Katie turns around and Lily is pulling down the covers on the bed.  Katie tells her that she doesn't have to give up her bed and Lily hands her a pillow and blanket.  Katie, a little deflated, says that she will sleep on the floor.  After the two are in bed and the lights are out, Katie asks if Lily is asleep.  Lily doesn't answer but her eyes are wide open.  Katie says that she doesn't know if Lily is asleep or just ignoring her but she wants to say something.  She tells her that she didn't mean to put Holden and Luke in any danger.  She adds that she only came because of the way she feels about Simon.  She says that she can't explain it; maybe it is the same way that Lily feels about Holden.  She says that she and Simon haven't been together that long, but she is crazy about the guy.  She ends by saying that she is sorry again and Lily says, \"Goodnight, Katie.\"  Katie says goodnight and then she says, \"Goodnight, Simon.\"\n\n\nOut in the hall, Simon hears someone dialing a phone.  He sneaks over to a door and opens it a little.  He sees the lady that owns the villa talking on the phone.  She tells the person on the phone that Lily has a man and woman that have joined her.  She tells them that they have to do something.  She finishes by telling them to move the two Americans.\n\n\n",
