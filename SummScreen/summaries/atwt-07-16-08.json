Carly was thrilled to be in the big city and seemed to be enjoying her time away from Holden and all of her problems back in Oakdale.   Neal kept complimenting Carly and he eventually leaned in for a kiss.   As the kissing became a little more passionate, Carly stopped Neal and told him she wanted to slow things down.  Neal apologized for moving so fast and insisted all he wanted was for Carly to have a good time.  In an attempt to please Carly, he phoned downstairs and booked her an in-room massage while he left to take care of the business that brought them to town.   \n\n\nA short time later, Carly got undressed and hopped up on the table for her massage.   She called out for her masseur to return from the hall, but he was not the one who came through the door, Holden did.  Carly jumped up with just a sheet on and told Holden to leave.  He explained that he had come to New York to talk to her.  At first, Carly refused to listen and told Holden to forget about her and think about his family.  Holden claimed that he had tried to get over her, but he could not get the thought of her out of his head.  Carly insisted that Holden stop talking that way and focus on Lily.  Holden explained that his marriage had failed and he was not sure he could fix his relationship with Lily.  He shocked Carly by telling her he would end his marriage to Lily, if he could be with Carly all the time.  Carly told Holden to go home because she was not going to ruin his or Lily's life.  As Holden continued to persuade Carly to be with him, she emotionally said she could not be the woman who stole her best friend's husband.  Holden was determined to get Carly to change her mind, so he pulled her in and kissed her, and the two ended up making love. \n\n\nCarly and Holden lay in bed and Carly immediately regretted giving into her feelings again.  Holden felt it was inevitable and wondered how they could have stopped it.  As they were talking, Neal knocked on Carly's door and wanted to see Carly.  Both Holden and Carly rushed to get dressed and through the door, Carly told Neal she would meet him later at the bar.  Carly turned her attention back to Holden and what had just happened.  Holden wanted to know what Carly would do now in regards to him and Neal.  Carly said she would go to Paris with Neal if it meant Holden would go home to Lily and make his marriage work.  Holden asked Carly if that was what she wanted and she did not answer.  Carly begged Holden to return home to Lily and leave her alone.  After he could not get Carly to change her answer, Holden begrudgingly left and Carly began to cry.  \n\n\nA short time later, Carly dressed and waited for Neal to return.  Neal asked if Carly had forgotten him in the bar, but then he noticed she was packed and asked where she was going.  Carly said she could not go with him to Paris and admitted she was using him to get over someone else.  Neal immediately knew that someone was Holden. Carly wondered how he knew and Neal explained he had seen Holden in the lobby and figured it out.  Carly apologized for leading Neal on and he graciously accepted.  Neal refused to judge Carly for her indiscretion with Holden and asked her what she was going to do.  Carly insisted she was going to end it with Holden and Neal said he would be there for her as a friend or more if she needed him.   \n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Lily and Luke started to work on using Luke's newly returned inheritance to start a charitable foundation.  While they went over the numbers, Luke asked Lily what was wrong with Holden.  Luke explained that Holden seemed distant lately and worried taking the money from Damian had caused a rift between him and Holden.  Lily reassured Luke that Holden was very proud of him and would always be his father.  With that resolved, Luke then wondered if Lily and Holden were the ones having trouble.  Lily insisted that she and Holden were back on track and Luke had nothing to worry about.  \n\n\nLater in the evening, Holden returned home and surprised Lily.  She was thrilled Holden was home, but noticed he seemed upset.  She repeatedly asked Holden what was wrong and he finally admitted that he was in New York and that he was having an affair.  \n\n\nBarbara arrived at Fairwinds to talk with Meg and Paul about Rick Decker's suspicions that Sofie was murdered by a medical professional like Meg.  Paul did not want to address the accusations that Meg might be responsible for Sofie's death, but Barbara insisted they tell Meg what Rick found when he performed Sofie's autopsy.  Meg was offended that Barbara suspected her of Sofie's death, but Barbara claimed she did not believe Meg did it, but only wanted her to know what the report would say. Meg did not believe Barbara and stormed out, leaving Paul to deal with his mother.    \n\n\nMargo went to the Lakeview to investigate Sofie's murder.  She spoke with Sofie's maid and learned that the night of the murder, before Paul had arrived; Meg had been in Sofie's room arguing with her.  Margo's next stop was to speak with Lisa.   Lisa felt there was no way that Meg would be involved in killing Sofie and admitted that she had heard Barbara threaten Sofie.  \n\n\nRick and his police guard discussed the timeline for getting Rick back to jail.  Just as Rick was joking about the morgue being better than prison, Susan came in and criticized Rick for returning to Oakdale.  Rick detailed his new role as an expert witness for Susan and she was shocked that anyone would want Rick near them.  Rick was determined to charm Susan and remind her of happy times, but Susan did not want to hear any of it and threw her coffee on Rick and left.  \n\n\nMeg arrived at the morgue to ask Rick why he accused her of murder.  Rick explained he never blamed her, but simply said a medical professional was the one behind Sofie's death.   He said Barbara must have assumed Meg was behind Sofie's demise.  Meg proclaimed her innocence, but Rick showed her with a needle, how it took a professional to insert the needle into Sofie.  Just as Rick picked up the needle to show Meg, Paul arrived and punched Rick out.  Rick's police escort came in and stopped Paul from doing anymore damage.  The officer took Rick back to the Oakdale police station.\n\n\nMargo had returned from her fact finding mission and was greeted by the smug Dr. Decker who implored her to read his report.  Margo did not want to take the time to read the work of a serial killer, but once he was on his way to lock-up she decided to glance through it.  \n\n\nAfter reading the report, Margo went to Fairwinds to interview Meg.  Paul held his wife's hand as she answered Margo's questions about the night Sofie died.  Meg admitted she had argued with Sofie, but denied any involvement in her death.  When Margo's questions seemed to focus solely on Meg as a suspect, Paul put a stop to the interrogation and asked Margo to go.  Before she left, Margo advised Meg not to leave town, which cemented the fact for everyone that Meg was the prime suspect in Sofie's murder.   \n\n\nOnce Margo had left, Paul received a call from Sofie's obstetrician who wanted to see Sofie and Paul right away.  He and Meg left to find out what was going on.   Meg and Paul arrived at the doctor's office and explained that Sofie had died.  The doctor said she had phoned Sofie to perform another sonogram because they had found a second and different sonogram with Sofie's name on it.  The second test showed Sofie was only a few weeks along, not two months.  Paul and Meg realized that Sofie must have doctored her records and had never been carrying Paul's child.  The two believed that the father of Sofie's child might just be her killer. \n\n\nAfter meeting with Paul and Meg, Barbara returned to her room and found Cole had broken into her suite.  Barbara wanted Cole out, but he held up a bottle of her Morphine and told Barbara that this is what killed Sofie.   Barbara reached for the phone to call the police, but Cole slammed it down and then claimed he had seen a drugged out Barbara go into Sofie's room.  He asked Barbara if she was so hopped up on drugs that she forgot killing Sofie.  Cole told Barbara that he saw Barbara push her way into Sofie's room and jam the needle into her arm.  Barbara insisted she would not have done that, but Cole said he watched the entire ordeal unfold and he wanted to help Barbara.  Barbara seemed confused by everything Cole was saying and did not know whether or not to believe his account of Sofie's death.  Cole told Barbara she could buy his silence with $400,000.  She said she would get him the money, but told him she needed a little time.    Cole agreed to wait, but warned Barbara not to make him wait too long.\n\n\n",
