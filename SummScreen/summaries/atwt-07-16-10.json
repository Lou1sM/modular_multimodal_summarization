    "soap_central": "\n\nAs Katie pounded on Henry's door, Vienna arrived. She implored Katie to help her make Henry understand why they'd lied, but Katie exclaimed that there was no excuse for it. Vienna tried her keycard in the door, but when it didn't work, Katie deduced that Henry had gotten it deactivated. \"Henry doesn't want you in his life anymore, and neither do I,\" Katie stated. Just then, Henry opened the door and asked to speak to his wife.\n\n\n       Alone with Henry in his room, Vienna plied him with kisses, but he asserted that he wanted an annulment. She said that it would mean that the marriage had never existed. \"Kind of like the baby,\" Henry quipped. She suggested that they pretend until things returned to the way they'd once been, but he wondered how many heartaches she thought she could erase.\n\n\nVienna swore that she'd acted out of love, but Henry retorted that she needed to check the definition. Vienna whimpered on about how she'd make it up to him, but he called her delusional. When she refused to give him up on him, he said that she'd either agree to the annulment, or he'd drag her to court. He promised her that it wouldn't be pretty.\n\n\nVienna accused Henry of wanting Barbara all along. Vienna said he'd married her with one eye on the door, because he'd hoped that Barbara would stop the wedding. To Vienna, Barbara's inaction proved that she didn't love Henry as much as Vienna did. She figured that once Henry calmed down, he'd see reason, but it might be too late. He claimed that he'd risk it, and Vienna yelled at him to go be with Barbara--if he could find her.\n\n\nHenry went to the front desk and learned that Barbara hadn't picked up her messages in days. He encountered Katie at the bar, and she inquired about what had happened with Vienna. He announced that he was annulling the marriage. \"And if I could, I'd annul our friendship, too,\" he quipped. Katie beseeched him to let her have it, because she deserved it.  He retorted that it wouldn't be worth it and walked off. Katie grimaced, but then she heard a wounded Henry utter that she'd been his best friend.\n\n\nKatie turned to find him behind her, and he wondered how she could have betrayed him that way. He begged her to explain how she could have teamed up with Vienna to inflict such devastation upon him. He confided that he'd fantasized about their children growing up together. Katie's eyes welled with tears, and she said that he and Vienna were meant to be.\n\n\nHenry wondered how she'd drawn that conclusion, and Katie admitted that she'd had dreams of her own. She'd dreamed that she and Brad, and Vienna and Henry, would raise their kids together. She'd figured that if he and Vienna made it, then the past wouldn't be utterly lost. Not buying it, Henry accused her of just being miserable because someone had actually loved him for a change. He exclaimed that he'd lost Barbara because of her. \"I lost Brad because of you, but I forgave you!\" Katie shouted back. Henry guessed that she was just a better person than he was, and he stalked off.\n\n\n       At Fairwinds, Paul prodded Gwen to admit her shock that he and Emily weren't devouring their young. Gwen conveyed her surprise that they had a normal family, and Emily hoped that Barbara would remain gone, so it would stay that way. Gwen, however, doubted that Barbara was vacationing on a cruise, since Gwen and Will had discovered her discarded passport in her room. Gwen said that Will had gone to the police station to launch an investigation.\n\n\n       Will arrived to say that Margo had officially listed Barbara as a missing person. Paul guessed that someone had sent him the postcard to deter him from searching for Barbara. Emily suggested that Barbara might have sent it herself just to get attention, because she was distraught about Henry. Emily insisted that it was classic Barbara. Suspicious of Emily, Will cited that she'd already admitted she didn't care if she ever saw Barbara again.\n\n\nPaul defended his wife, and Emily said that fighting was just something that she and Barbara did. Gwen still thought that Barbara would never allow any man to stand between her and spending time with Hallie. Paul agreed and wondered how they'd proceed. \"Emily, what do you think?\" Will pointedly asked. As the foursome fell into bickering about the predicament, Emily deflected the suspicion away from herself and onto Vienna, who'd been battling Barbara for Henry. Gwen and Will left to seek Vienna out for some answers.\n\n\n       After Alison and Casey picked up Hallie later, Emily expressed her gratitude to Paul for defending her to Will. \"Just between the two of us, did you do something to my mother?\" Paul asked. An angry Emily stormed off. When she returned to the room, he apologized and worried about his mother. \"I know she's a complete monster, but she's my monster,\" he said. Emily understood that, and it was the reason that she'd never hurt Barbara. Emily had accepted that loving Paul included suffering Barbara. They hugged, and he wished that his mother would call.\n\n\n       Later, Will and Gwen saw Henry in the Lakeview lobby and expressed their concerns about the missing Barbara. Henry, who'd assumed that Barbara had gone to see Hallie, began to worry. Katie approached, and Will and Gwen informed them about the passport and fake postcard. Sensing that Barbara was in trouble, Henry rushed off, and Katie trailed behind him.\n\n\nUpstairs, Henry banged on Barbara's door, and Katie tried to calm him down. He fretted about where Barbara could be, and Katie admitted that Barbara never would have missed the wedding, because she'd known about the fake pregnancy. Katie divulged that, on the day of the wedding, Barbara had given Vienna an ultimatum about it. Henry accused Katie and Vienna of having something to do with Barbara's disappearance. Katie swore that she didn't know where Barbara was, and Henry stated that he really wanted to believe it.\n\n\nKatie asserted that she'd never hurt Barbara, because she knew how much Barbara meant to Henry. Grabbing his arm, Katie tried to assuage his fears about Barbara, but a frazzled Henry refused to calm down. He ordered her to let him go, and then he rushed off.\n\n\nOn a massage table later, Vienna relaxed as someone entered the room. A pair of hands massaged her neck, and Vienna referred to the knot that he worked on as \"Barbara Ryan.\" Suddenly, the hands choked Vienna, and Henry's face loomed close to hers. He demanded to know what she'd done with Barbara.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, a service attendant handed Will and Gwen a cell phone that had been found in the stairwell. Will identified it as Barbara's, and they noted that it had 39 messages on it. Gwen wrapped it in tissue to preserve any possible evidence. The couple took the phone to Margo, who was interested to know about the last call that Barbara had made. Katie entered and said that she had the answer, because she'd been there when the call had been received.\n\n\n       At the warehouse, Chuckles yelled for the dozing Barbara to wake up. He slapped her, and she awakened, shocked that he'd hit her. Figuring that she'd dreamed it, she wondered how long she'd been there. She offended Chuckles by calling him an inanimate object, but apologized when he refused to offer advice about her next move. The forgiving Chuckles gave her a pep talk, and she managed to wiggle out of her restraints.\n\n\n       Barbara cited that she'd broken into a cold sweat, and Chuckles diagnosed her with a fever. For warmth, she donned a period costume and proclaimed herself Elizabeth, Queen of England. Chuckles, however, decided that she was Anne Boleyn. With a spark, the screen yellowed, and Chuckles suddenly became Henry, dressed as King Henry VIII. He asked to hear one good reason that he shouldn't chop off her head.\n\n\n       Barbara figured that she was hallucinating, but the king reasoned that she could be his queen, or he could order her beheading. Barbara claimed that she loved him, but Emily appeared in period clothing to challenge Barbara's sincerity and to denounce her for meddling in her son's affairs. Paul, Gwen, and Will also appeared to accuse her of being a bad mother. Barbara claimed that she'd already been banished to the \"dungeon\" to suffer from sickness, hunger, and loneliness. The costume-wearing Katie appeared to urge them to protect the king from Barbara.\n\n\n       Barbara accused Katie of being disloyal and conspiring with Henry's enemies. Vienna appeared, touting that she was the queen. \"Which means that thing doesn't count,\" she said, pointing at Barbara. Desiring to have both women, Henry pondered starting his own religion. \"Off with her head!\" Vienna declared, and everyone chanted the phrase.\n\n\n       Pleading on her own behalf, Barbara admitted that she wasn't the best mother, and she'd failed Henry by not immediately informing him of Vienna's betrayal. Barbara pleaded guilty to loving Henry and claimed that she'd fight for what she believed in with her dying breath. She said that if they were both courageous, they could have what they wanted. Henry pronounced Barbara as his real queen, and they kissed.\n\n\nBarbara snapped out of her dream and realized that she was holding onto Chuckles. She figured that no one was riding to her rescue, so if she wanted to get out of there, she had to do it on her own. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Henry demands an annulment from Vienna despite her repeated explanations and pleas for him to forgive her. Henry tells Vienna that she never knew the meaning of the word love if she could fake a pregnancy and then tell him she miscarried the baby that never existed. Henry tells Vienna that if she doesn't give him an annulment, she will drag her through a very nasty divorce in court. Henry is most hurt by the fact his best friend Katie lied to him and took Vienna's side when she decided not to tell him that Vienna wasn't pregnant. Henry tells Katie that he will never forgive her and never wants to see her again. Barbara's condition worsens in the warehouse when she develops a fever and hallucinates that she is Ann Boleyn and Henry is King Henry the eighth and she manages to save herself from being beheaded by telling King Henry how much she loves him and that she would never betray him. Margo officially declares Barbara a missing person and Will suspects that Emily knows where Barbara is. Emily manages to get suspicion off herself and put it on Vienna. A Lakeview employee finds Barbara's cell phone on the stairwell and gives it to Will who gives it to Margo. Emily tells Paul that she promised to accept Barbara because she is part of his family. Paul apologizes to Emily for thinking she had something to do with Barbara's disappearance, but he still doubts that she is telling the truth. Henry frantically searches for Barbara after Will tells him that Margo declared her missing. Henry can feel in his bones that Barbara is in trouble and suspects that Katie helped Vienna hide Barbara to keep her from telling him the truth before the wedding. Katie swears to Henry she didn't do it, so Henry goes into the hotel spa where Vienna is having a massage. Grabbing her, Henry demands to know what she Vienna to Barbara.",
