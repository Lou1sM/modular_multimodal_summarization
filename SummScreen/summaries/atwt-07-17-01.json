Ben told him what he did and told Isaac to keep it a secret.  Isaac argued with Ben about using the illegal drugs.  He told Ben that he could lose his license to practice medicine.  Ben said he couldn't live with himself without trying to keep Lien alive after he heard that the drug had helped others in other parts of the world.  He told Isaac that Lien means a lot to him and he wanted to save her.  Isaac told him he's doing the same thing that he did with Camille and then Denise and now Lien.  He told him to chill out and not fall in love with every woman that came along.  Isaac wanted to know what Lien thought now that Ben saved her life.  Ben told him that she didn't know about it.  \n\n\nWhen Ben left, Lisa walked over to talk to Isaac.  She told Isaac there was nothing wrong with love and she sees nothing wrong with Ben looking for the right woman.  She went on to tell Isaac that she is not against looking for husband number 9.\n\n\nHolden & Luke's Prison:\n\nLuke and Holden discussed their escape.  When they heard church bells ringing, Holden told him that when they escaped, they would run to the church for sanctuary.  The Italian guard came in the room that they were being held in.  He told them that he was taking Luke somewhere alone but he would give them a few minutes alone to say goodbye.  When the guard left, Luke wondered how they could escape later if the guard took him away now.  Holden told him they would have to make it look like Luke was too sick to go.  Holden put stage make-up on Luke to make him look sick.  He told Luke to cough and pretend he was tired.  When the guard came back, Holden told him that Luke was sick.  The guard looked at Luke and told him that he better not be lying.  The guard wanted to know what was wrong with Luke.  When he started shaking him, Holden told him that Luke might be coming down with TB.  He said that one of Luke's school friends came down with it and he was supposed to get a booster shot but they didn't have time to get it.  The guard left and said that he would be back later that evening.  Holden told Luke that the guard was probably afraid to get TB from Luke and they were happy that they tricked him.\n\n\nLily's Rented Room:\n\nThe church bells waking her up annoyed Katie.  She and Lily talk about the mess they are in.  Katie apologized to Lily for going after Holden last summer.  She said she knew now that she didn't love Holden. She said she is so much in love with Simon and she knows now what it's really like to be in love.  Katie went to see how Simon was and ran back in the room to tell Lily that Simon was gone.  The Senora brought them breakfast.  As Katie started to drink the orange juice, Simon ran in the room and told them not to eat anything the Senora gave them.  Lily wanted to know why the Senora would have put something in their food.  The Senora claimed to know nothing.  Simon brought the Italian police with him.  The cop was surprised when he saw whom Simon was accusing of kidnapping and murder.  He apologized to the Senora and told them that she was his friend.  Lily said it wasn't a coincidence that she met her on the plane to Malta and accused her of working with Damian.  When the cop was taking the Senora's side in the argument, Simon asked whom was she talking to when she told them to get rid of the two Americans.  Lil told the Senora she wanted to know what she knew about Holden and Luke.  The woman became irate.  The cop wanted to know what Damian had to do with this.  Lily briefly told them about her being married to Damian and how he, Holden and Luke disappeared.  The woman appeared to not know the true facts and apologized.  She said she would never hurt Damian or his son.  Lily asked her to help her find them.  Before the woman could say anything there was a knock at the door and the person told Lily to open the door.  It was another Italian policeman looking for Katie.  They arrested her for stealing a bicycle.  As they argued with the police, the senora disappeared.  The cop told them because of Katie's stealing the bike, he said he no longer believed their story of the kidnapping.  After the cops left, Simon told Lily he was stupid for getting the police involved.  He said first they need to get Katie out of Jail and send her back to the US and then they would continue the search for her family.  He said they couldn't trust anyone but each other.  \n\n\nTom & Margo's House:\n\nLien tried to walk with a walker.  When she saw how difficult it was, she decided she wasn't quite ready for too much walking yet.  Lien wanted to know why Ben has to give her the shots and not John Dixon.  She told Tom that she left a message for John to call her and she was going to tell him that she wanted him to give her the shots.  When the phone rang, Tom stopped her from answering it and told her that Ben is the only one that is to give her the shots.  She wanted to know why.  Tom told her the medication that was used, wasn't approved.  Tom told her that he was the one that gave her the first shot.  Tom explained to Lien that she was dying and the only way to save her life was to use the illegal drug.  He asked her if she was angry with him.  She said he gave her life not only once, but twice and she was so grateful to him.  Tom told her that Ben didn't want her to know so that she wouldn't feel indebted to him.  When they heard Ben at the door, Tom asked her not to let Ben know that she knew.  She told him she wouldn't say anything to Ben.  Ben examined Lien.  He told her that he had a talk with Isaac and although he didn't like what he had to say, he thought Isaac was right.  He promised to give Lien her space and not push.  He said he was going to keep their relationship professional.  Lien kissed Ben.  He wondered why the change.  She told him he saved her life and she was grateful for his encouragement and support.  He told her Curtis had been asking about her.  He asked if the three of them could go out to dinner sometime when she was ready.  She told him she would be happy to go with them.\n\n\nItalian Prison:\n\nWhen the cop put Katie in a jail cell, she said she wanted to talk to someone in charge.  She tried to sweet-talk the guard by flattering him.  He just smiled and walked away.  The opera singers began singing and Katie was complaining about the loud noise.  The guard told her that she better get used to it.  He said that the annual Argotti Garden Opera Festival was opening and the singing would be around for a few days.  When Katie heard the word \"Arogotti\", she realized where Holden and Luke were.  She told the guard she needed a phone.  He told her it wasn't a hotel and walked out.\n\n\n",
