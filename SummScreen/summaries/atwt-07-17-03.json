    "tvmega_recap": "Aaron and Lucy continued to feel awkward, even though Craig and Rosanna were gone. They eventually calmed down and made love. Dusty told Rose he was worried that Paul will hurt her. When he voiced the same concerns to Lily, she kicked him out, saying Rose was better off before she met him. Rose told Holden that she had genuine feelings for Dusty, but Holden said she owed it to herself to make sure there was no chance with Paul. Paul later kissed Rose, and she returned the kiss.
