    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara gives a stunned Will and Gwen access to his trust fund. When they see the size of the check, Gwen and Will dream about what they can do with the money. Gwen and Will thank Barbara for this, as Will reaches out a bit to her. Maddie watches Lia kiss Casey while brandishing a knife. Jade interrupts and Maddie is able to cover, but Jade is more and more suspicious of her behavior. Jade asks Casey if the police know more about the fire and if they will arrest the person? Casey wonders why she cares? She thinks she knows who started it. Outside, Maddie sees Lea's car and goes into a trance as she envisions Casey and Lia kissing inside. She stabs at her car seats as she sees herself fending off someone in a darkened room in the same stabbing motion. Lia sees Maddie destroying her car and Casey rushes to her side. A freaked out Maddie yells for him not to touch her. Casey tells Gwen to call his mother. Simon approaches Lucinda about a job, but hides when Katie and Mike appear. Lucinda thinks Simon is back for Katie but he claims he is back to settle down for good, but it has nothing to do with Katie; Lucinda is suspicious. Simon sends back Katie's ring with a cordial but simple note, and Katie sees this as a sign that he is now accepting they are together forever; Mike is skeptical. Emily seems ready to plead guilty when Dusty barges in on the proceedings wanting to be heard. Paul tries valiantly to stop him, but Dusty will not be deterred. He tells Tom if he goes to trial, it will be without his testimony. Tom reluctantly admits without Dusty they have no case. A desperate Paul tries to stop Emily's imminent release by tearing open his shirt to reveal his bullet wound scar, which Emily gave him. Meg testifies on his behalf and she is convincing as a nurse, but when Cass questions whether she actually saw Emily pull the trigger, the case falls apart. The judge reluctantly drops the charges on that count as well and sets Emily free. As Emily and Susan celebrate, a determined Paul threatens that he will not let her hurt their child, but Emily orders him out of her way since he can't touch her anymore.",
