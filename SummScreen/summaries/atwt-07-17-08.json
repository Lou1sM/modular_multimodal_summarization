Jack grabbed her and kissed her and talked her into staying. Liberty and Parker arrived and announced they were headed up to Parker's room to do homework. Jack made a remark to the teens about their sticking to just homework upstairs, and Janet picked up on it immediately. She pinned Jack down and overreacted when she learned that Jack had caught their kids kissing at Brad and Katie's house one evening. Janet yelled for Liberty and verbally raked her over the coals. She ordered her daughter to keep her lips and other body parts entirely to herself until she was 18 years old. Liberty stormed out, and Parker followed. Jack calmed Janet with another kiss and, as the two of them reclined on the couch, in walked Carly. \n\n\nAt home, Holden felt compelled to tell Lily about his affair with Carly. Lily was stunned and then put the facts together enough to realize that Holden had not been in St. Louis on horse business but in New York to stop Carly from going to Paris with her new friend, Neal. She demanded to know how many times her husband had slept with Carly and where it occurred. And most important, she wanted him to tell her if he was in love with Carly. Holden asked her not to use those words. Lily agonized about how blind she had been not to see what her husband and best friend were doing. Holden argued back, and they exchanged harsh words. \n\n\nVienna confronted Henry, who was minding Metro in Carly's absence, and demanded more \"one-on-one\" time with him. Henry let it slip that he was more than just an employee at the club; he was more of a partner. He claimed he was just trying to make a better life for the two of them, but Vienna was not convinced. She insisted that Henry undo whatever deal he had made with Carly. Henry said he could not do that and he only wanted to give Vienna the life she deserved. Finally, he came clean and admitted that he was a shallow person and wanted the life of glamour back for himself. \n\n\nHolden continued to disclose details of his and Carly's affair. Lily asked if Holden were thinking of Carly every time he made love to her and also if he had broken off the affair yet. Holden said he did not know those answers, nor did he know if he had it in him to keep their family together. Lily was furious and threw him out. \n\n\nCarly asked Janet to leave, so Jack went with Janet to the farm. Holden called Carly who told him she did not want to see him. Parker and Liberty returned and Parker was surprised to see his mother back so soon. Carly grabbed her car keys and left. \n\n\nVienna told Henry she had no problem with his being shallow and materialistic and agreed, only slightly reluctantly, to the Metro deal. Henry told her how awesome the kitchen was there, and she went to see it. Bonnie came in for a drink and when Vienna returned, she interrupted a toast between Henry and Bonnie. Vienna was angry, so Henry explained that Bonnie had helped work out some of the kinks in the contract with Carly. Vienna made it clear that she wanted to be the only one with whom Henry worked out his \"kinks,\" and she was hurt that he had kept secrets from her. After Vienna left, Henry tried to justify his keeping secrets from her to Bonnie who told him she knew Vienna well, and was sure she would come around to Henry's thinking eventually. \n\n\nHolden showed up unexpectedly at Carly's and asked Parker where his mother was. Parker suggested Holden call her on her cell phone, and eventually he tracked her down at the coffee shop. Carly called it quits on the affair and told Holden to go back to his wife and family. Holden admitted that it was too late; he had already told Lily everything. Carly was not pleased and, after kissing Holden one last time, explained that the sooner she got to Lily, the sooner Lily could begin to hate her and stop blaming Holden. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet asked Jack if she had overreacted with Liberty and scolded herself. She confided to Jack that having Liberty was the best and worst thing that had ever happened to her. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Liberty and Parker approached the homework while sitting on Parker's bed. Liberty teased him, and the two began kissing with a bit more intensity than before. \n\n\nHolden went home where he found a picture of Lily and him had been turned over. Lily had gotten into her car and driven aimlessly before finally turning for home. As Lily approached her driveway, Carly was illuminated by the headlights. Lily hit the accelerator and screamed, \"You bitch!\" and headed straight for a horrified Carly.\n\n\n",
