    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt Katie's house, Katie tried to convince Henry that since Vienna had been fired, it was time for him to quit pretending to be Geneva Swift. Henry, however, found that he enjoyed the attention he was getting as Geneva. Katie reminded Henry that Geneva was just \"a wig and a padded bra,\" but Henry said that was true of a lot of women on television. Henry left, determined to continue his charade.\n\n\nBrad arrived at home and launched into a tirade about Kim hiring Geneva to be a permanent part of Oakdale Now. Brad said they had to do something to stop Geneva, and they should start by considering what they really knew about her.\n\n\nHenry took flowers to Vienna at the Lakeview and tried to make her feel better about having been fired from Oakdale Now. Henry pointed out that Vienna's health was more important than the TV show, and he told her that in a few months, she would be able to watch Brad, Katie, and Geneva on Oakdale Now without having any bad feelings. Vienna asked what Henry meant, because she was certain that Geneva wouldn't stay on the show after Katie returned from her pregnancy and maternity leave. Henry said that Katie had told him that Geneva had been offered a permanent spot on the show, and Vienna became angry again. Henry asked what he could do to make Vienna feel better, and Vienna suggested they make love.\n\n\nVienna went into the bathroom to get out of her clothes. Henry's cell phone rang, and it was Kim, calling for Geneva. He answered in his Geneva voice and learned that Kim had arranged a press conference to announce Geneva's addition to the cast of Oakdale Now. Kim said that she needed Geneva at the Lakeview immediately, and then she hung up. Vienna walked out of the bathroom wearing a leopard-print teddy, and Henry stared at her.\n\n\nHenry made up an excuse about being upset about Vienna's firing, and he said he needed some time alone to work through his feelings before he could make love to her. He grabbed a bag from his closet and told Vienna it was laundry that he needed to drop off. As he walked out the door, Henry wondered to himself where he could go to change clothes.\n\n\nBrad got out his laptop computer and tried to look up information on Geneva, but all he could find were four fan sites. Katie said that he should stop looking, but Brad was determined to find out more. His cell phone rang, and Katie answered it for him. It was Kim, letting them know that Geneva had accepted the offer to be a permanent co-host of the show and inviting them to attend the press conference to welcome Geneva to the group.\n\n\nBrad went to the Lakeview, and, as he waited in the lobby for Kim to assemble the press conference, he saw Henry go to the front desk. Brad then overheard Henry ask the desk clerk for another room for a few hours, and the clerk gave Henry the key to room 415. Brad went upstairs to Henry and Vienna's room and found Vienna preparing the room for her anticipated romantic time with Henry. Vienna told Brad that she and Henry were hoping that sex might cheer her up, but Henry had gone for a walk and hadn't returned yet. Brad told Vienna he hoped that Henry returned soon, and then he left.\n\n\nBrad went to the fourth floor and exited the elevator in time to see Geneva walking out of room 415. When Brad asked why Geneva was upstairs when the press conference was being held downstairs, Geneva told him that Kim had gotten her a room so that she could prepare her makeup to look her best for the press conference. Geneva walked away, leaving Brad to wonder what was going on.\n\n\nWhen Brad saw Katie in the lobby, he told her he needed to talk to her about something. Before he could, however, Kim approached and greeted Katie warmly. Kim then noticed that Brad didn't look very good. Brad said he was feeling a little light-headed, and he asked Kim for the key to the room she had rented for them to change and get ready in; Kim said she hadn't rented a room. Brad said in that case, he would just find an aspirin, and he left, telling them he would be right back.\n\n\nAs Kim and Katie watched Brad walk away, Geneva arrived. Kim greeted Geneva, and then left to get the press conference set up. Katie told Henry that his impersonation of a woman had to end, because he was hurting Vienna by continuing to pretend to be Geneva and taking Vienna's job away from her. Katie told Henry to take off the dress and act like a man. Henry continued to argue that he could be both Henry and Geneva, but Katie warned Henry that he had to tell Vienna the truth. Henry said he would, when the time was right.\n\n\nBrad went back upstairs to Vienna's room and asked whether Henry had returned. When Vienna said no, Brad told her he was afraid something was going on between Henry and Geneva. Vienna couldn't believe it, but Brad told her he had seen Henry renting a room and then had seen Geneva exit that same room a little while later. Vienna was stunned, but she said if what Brad was suggesting was true, she would teach Geneva a lesson that she'd never forget.\n\n\nKim convened the press conference, and Katie and Geneva exchanged pleasantries for the audience. The reporters began asking questions, but Brad and Vienna's arrival interrupted them. Vienna said she had a question, and she asked, \"What gives you the right to sleep with my man?\"\n\n\nKim tried to stop Vienna, but Brad said he thought they would all like an answer to Vienna's question. Geneva/Henry said, \"I refuse to dignify that absurdity with a response.\" Vienna accused Geneva of being afraid to answer the question, but Geneva said the very idea was preposterous. Vienna became incensed and said, \"I'll teach you for putting your hands on my man!\" She grabbed Geneva and pulled at her hair. Geneva's wig fell off, and everyone could see that Geneva was actually Henry in drag.\n\n\nAt the police station, Bonnie told Dusty that the only way to get him out of the legal mess he had found himself in was for her to make Paul Ryan look like the bad guy. Bonnie said that she would need to say that Paul was engaged in industrial espionage, and that Dusty had simply tried to protect his business. Although Dusty's methods may have been misguided and ill-conceived, Bonnie would argue that Dusty had never intended to cause Paul any physical harm.\n\n\nDusty said that the only way a jury might buy that argument was if Damian backed him up on the story. Bonnie told Dusty that Damian might have a change of heart about helping Dusty, but her case didn't depend on that. Her strategy would be to \"paint Paul Ryan as the spawn of Satan.\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, Paul asked Barbara who she was, and she quickly realized that not only did Paul not remember her, he didn't even remember who he was. Bob went to examine Paul and learned of his amnesia. Bob and Barbara left Paul's room so that they could talk privately. Barbara wondered whether the removal of the microchip could have caused Paul's amnesia, and Bob explained that some patients had problems after brain surgery. When Barbara asked what she could do, Bob suggested that she surround Paul with the people he loved, because that might trigger his memory.\n\n\nDamian visited Meg at the farm, and she told him that she had found out that Paul had regained consciousness after his surgery. Damian asked whether Meg wanted to visit Paul, but Meg said that was the last thing she wanted to do. Meg pointed out how complicated things had become with Damian, Dusty, and Paul, and she reminded Damian that any or all of them could have been killed when the bomb exploded. Meg said that she needed to distance herself from the people who might put her and her baby into dangerous situations. Damian replied that he hoped that didn't include him, because that was the last thing he wanted.\n\n\nMeg assured Damian that she didn't intend to stop seeing him, because he had been the one who had tried to stop Dusty and Paul from destroying one another. Damian said that he was glad to hear that, and he told Meg that he thought she took very good care of Eliza, but he hoped one day, Meg would let someone take care of her, too. He moved in close to kiss Meg, but Meg's phone rang, and she broke away to answer it.\n\n\nIt was Barbara, who informed Meg of Paul's amnesia. When Barbara asked Meg to go to the hospital to see Paul, Meg was reluctant, but Barbara said that Bob had told her it might help Paul reconnect with his memories. Meg told Barbara she would be there as soon as possible. Damian asked Meg what had happened, and she told him. Damian said, \"That's awful,\" and Meg replied, \"Yes, it is ... if it's true.\"\n\n\nMeg decided she needed to go to the hospital, to determine whether Paul's condition was real. Damian offered to drive her there, but Meg said it was something she had to do by herself. Damian asked what he could do to help her, and she told him that she wanted him to resolve his problems with Dusty, because she couldn't stand wondering what was going to happen next.\n\n\nMeg arrived at the hospital and voiced her concern that Paul was only pretending to have amnesia. Barbara told Meg to go in and see for herself. Barbara took Eliza from Meg, and Meg went into Paul's room. Paul was stunned to see such a beautiful woman standing there, and he told Meg that he hoped they were involved somehow, because she was very sexy. Meg remarked that Paul was awfully glib and relaxed for someone who had lost his memory, but Paul responded that he didn't know how other people might react, because he couldn't remember anything.\n\n\nMeg proceeded to give Paul a rough idea of their relationship, telling him that they had been married until he had ruined things with his unfounded jealousy. When Paul laughingly called himself an idiot, Meg told him that if it turned out that he was lying about the amnesia, she would make sure he never spent any more time with Eliza.\n\n\nPaul asked who Eliza was. Meg angrily told Paul not to deny the existence of their daughter, but Paul asked in amazement, \"We have a daughter?\" When Paul then asked whether their daughter had Meg's eyes, Meg replied that she couldn't take it anymore, and she walked out of the room.\n\n\nBarbara asked Meg whether Paul had remembered her. Meg said Paul had claimed not to know who she was, but she didn't believe him, because he had lied to her too many times before. Barbara pleaded with Meg to give Paul the benefit of the doubt, because she was afraid this time, they might lose Paul for good.\n\n\nMeg took Eliza into Paul's room. Paul didn't remember Eliza, either, although he told Meg he thought Eliza was cute. Meg wanted Paul to hold Eliza, but Paul declined, saying he didn't think that was a good idea. Meg told Paul to look her in the eyes and tell her that he didn't recognize their daughter or remember that he loved Eliza with all his heart. Paul apologized, saying he was sorry he couldn't remember what Meg wanted him to remember. He then suggested that Meg take the baby outside, because he thought he should try to get some sleep.\n\n\nMeg went back into the hallway and told Barbara, \"He didn't recognize his own child.\" Barbara became upset and said, \"Then you have only yourself to blame. Because you drove him to this!\" When Meg questioned how she could have been responsible for Paul's condition, Barbara said that Meg should have seen that something was wrong with Paul, that he wasn't responsible for his actions. Meg said that she had tried to help Paul, but he had fought her, and then she asked why Barbara hadn't been able to see that her own son was changing. Barbara admitted that she had also been at fault, but Meg said she didn't blame Barbara.\n\n\nAfter Bonnie bailed Dusty out from jail, they found Damian in the lobby of the police station. Dusty approached Damian, saying, \"You got off, and I didn't.\" Damian replied that he was there to help Dusty in any way he could. Dusty informed Damian that he didn't need Damian's help. Damian told Dusty that he wanted to eliminate the bad blood between them, and he offered to tell the police that Dusty had never meant for the bomb to go off. Dusty said that Damian was only there because of Meg, and Dusty again stated that he didn't need Damian's help.\n\n\nBonnie tried to get Dusty to accept Damian's offer, but Dusty told Damian that once Bonnie was finished with Paul, Paul would be going to jail, even without Damian's help. Damian said he doubted that, and he told Dusty and Bonnie about Paul's amnesia, saying that as a result, it was unlikely Paul would be able to testify in any legal proceeding. Dusty angrily declared, \"Ryan will not get away with this,\" and he hurriedly left the police station.\n\n\nDusty went to the hospital, where he stormed into Paul's hospital room, waking Paul up by yelling at him. Dusty told Paul, \"I should have known you'd never pay for what you did. They should have locked you up a long time ago.\" Paul replied, \"Okay, I'm guessing we're not friends.\" Meg, Barbara, Bonnie, and Bob entered the room, and Meg yelled at Dusty to stop. Bob told Dusty that he needed to leave, and Bonnie took Dusty by the arm, saying, \"Don't worry, he's leaving.\"\n\n\nDamian approached Meg and apologized for not having been able to stop Dusty from going to the hospital. Meg told Damian that Paul's condition was \"horribly real.\" When Damian asked how Paul could have lost his memory, Meg said that the doctors had found a microchip in Paul's head during the surgery, and they thought that James Stenbeck had implanted it there. Meg said she didn't know how long it had been there, but with it gone, everything that defined who Paul was, good or bad, was apparently gone, too. Meg wondered why she hadn't known that there must have been a \"terrible reason\" why Paul had gone from the man she'd loved to a man who terrified her, but Damian told her not to blame herself.\n\n\nDamian took Meg and Eliza back home. Back at the farm, Damian offered to find a top neurologist to help Paul, so that Paul would be able to become a father to Eliza again. Meg was surprised that Damian would do that to help Paul, but Damian said he wasn't doing it for Paul.\n\n\nPaul called \"Mrs. Ryan\" back into his room, to make sure she was okay after the incident with Dusty. Barbara explained that she had been scared for Paul, not for herself. Paul pointed out that his life seemed complicated, because his ex-wife appeared to hate him, and Dusty thought he should be in jail. Barbara agreed that Paul's life was complicated, but she said the important thing was that he was alive. She told him that they would find a way to restore his memory, and if they couldn't, they would start from scratch.\n\n\n",
