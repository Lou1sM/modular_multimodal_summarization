Molly and Jake quickly thank her for her offer but try to convince her that it's too generous in hopes that she'll back off. Instead, Lucinda becomes more insistent, and much to Jake's surprise, the two agree to let her handle their nuptials. \n\n\nHal is caught off guard when Jack approaches him at Al's for help with his relationship with Carly. Hal can't believe that anyone would seek advice about affairs of the heart from him after his many failed marriages. Jack admits that Carly feels he's sabotaging her efforts to have a career. Pointing out all that led to his divorce from Barbara, Hal urges Jack to accept Carly for who she is, as hard as that may be. Emily brings Hal check out cards for all the military books in the library and tries to find out who has been reading them. They laugh to find most have been checked out by Nancy. \n\n\nBy bringing in photos and CDs of her favorite music to her hospital room, Jennifer and Paul do their best to try to get Barbara to emerge from her coma. They argue about what Barbara's feelings toward Craig may be once she comes to. Jessica interrupts and warns that if Barbara fails to wake, it's likely that Craig will go free because Cass has arranged for a judge to rule at a bail hearing today. Their efforts are rewarded when Barbara finally wakes after a violent convulsion.
