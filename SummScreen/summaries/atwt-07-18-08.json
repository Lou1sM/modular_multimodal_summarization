    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Janet made breakfast for Luke and Noah and joked around with them. She then told them she was worried about Jack because he'd gotten an emergency call in the middle of the night to investigate an accident, and she hadn't heard anything from him since then. Janet left to try to find Jack, and Luke and Noah cleaned up. Noah wondered whether Emma would have a problem if she knew Jack and Janet were sleeping together in her house, and he said he doubted it would be as big of a deal as it might be if he and Luke were sleeping together under Emma's roof. Luke said he was tempted to go to Noah's room at night, but he didn't want to risk having his Aunt Emma find out, because she'd be likely to tell Noah to move out. Noah told Luke he felt safe at the farm and that Luke was lucky to have both of his parents still alive. That reminded Luke that he hadn't heard from either Holden or Lily, so he called home, only to be told that Lily was in the hospital. \n\n\nLiberty and Parker spent the night sleeping on Parker's bed, on top of the covers and fully clothed. At Brad and Katie's house, Katie told Brad that Liberty wasn't in her room and that her bed did not appear to have been slept in. Brad called the Lakeview but was told Janet had already checked out and that she had not left a forwarding address. Brad and Katie went to Carly's house to find out if Parker knew where Liberty was. The door was unlocked, so they went inside and began calling for Parker. Parker woke up and shook Liberty, telling her to get up because her dad was downstairs. \n\n\nJanet walked into Carly's house and was surprised to see Brad and Katie; they were equally surprised to see her. Janet told them she was looking for Jack, because he'd left in the middle of the night to go to work. Brad was shocked to hear that Janet was now living with Jack and that they were still seeing each other; Janet told him she and Jack were adults and didn't need Brad's permission to have a relationship. Brad yelled at Janet about \"living in sin\" with his brother and not setting a good example for Liberty. Katie tried to get Brad to calm down, unsuccessfully. Katie then asked Janet if Liberty had spent the night with her. Janet was upset to learn that Liberty was missing. \n\n\nUpstairs, Liberty heard Janet's voice and told Parker her mother would go ballistic and hit her again if she found out Liberty had spent the night with him. Parker was surprised to learn that Janet had hit Liberty, but Liberty said it wasn't a big deal and that it had been because Janet had been afraid Liberty would get pregnant. Liberty climbed out the window. Downstairs, Janet realized Liberty might have decided not to go home after their fight the night before. Brad asked what the fight had been about, and Janet told him it had concerned Liberty and Parker's relationship. Brad was shocked to hear there was a \"relationship\" there, between his daughter and his brother's adopted son. \n\n\nLiberty walked into Carly's house and asked if the group was having a meeting of Parents Anonymous. They asked where Liberty had been, and she lied and said she had woken up early and had decided to eat breakfast at Al's Diner. Parker came downstairs and asked what was going on. Janet told Liberty that she would take her to school, and they left. Brad took Parker outside and reminded him that Liberty was his cousin. Parker said that was only a technical thing, but Brad told him that when Parker signed on to be a Snyder, it meant he became related to the whole family. He told Parker he had to remember the idea of family, loyalty, and respect. Parker asked if they were the Snyders or the Sopranos, and Brad retorted that Parker would be \"singing like a soprano\" if he didn't listen to Brad. \n\n\nJanet told Liberty she could see that Liberty was still wearing the clothes she'd had on the night before, except they looked wrinkled. Janet told Liberty not to lie to her, so Liberty admitted she had slept on Parker's bed. She assured her mother that nothing had happened but said, \"Hit me now and get it over with.\" Janet told Liberty she wasn't going to hit her. Instead, she told Liberty to get in the car, because she was going to take her to the farm. As they drove off, Parker ran behind them, trying to catch up. Parker went back home and sent a text message to Liberty, asking if she was okay. \n\n\nAt the farm, Janet apologized to Liberty for ever having hit her, telling her she was ashamed of herself. Janet swore it would never happen again. In order to protect Liberty and keep her from making the same type of mistake Janet had made, Janet told Liberty she was going to take her to see a gynecologist. Liberty said she could go alone, but Janet said she couldn't because she was a minor. Janet said they would go together and talk to the doctor about birth control and sexually transmitted diseases, and Liberty could get the HPV vaccine while she was there. Liberty asked if she could have sex if she was on birth control, and Janet said absolutely not, because Liberty was a still \"a baby,\" and Janet wanted her to have a better life than she'd had. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Katie was preparing for the day's segment of \"Oakdale Now,\" while Brad was thinking about Liberty. Brad told Katie he thought Liberty had been lying about having slept at home, and he was worried that she had actually slept with Parker and that they might have had sex. Katie said there was a way to find out if Liberty had been lying. She called Henry and was told that Liberty had not gone to Al's for breakfast that morning. Brad was upset. Katie told Brad he would need to have a conversation with Liberty about sex. Brad said he didn't think he could do that, but Katie pointed out that it had to be him and/or Janet, because they were Liberty's parents. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Jack, Carly, and Holden waited for Lily to regain consciousness. When she did, Holden went in to see her. After Holden told Lily what had happened, Lily remembered everything, including the fact that Holden and Carly had been having an affair. Lily ordered Holden out of the room and told him to have Jack come in to talk to her. Lily told Jack she had pulled into her driveway, seen Carly, and tried to run her down with her car, but at the last minute, she had turned the wheel because she couldn't do that to her kids or to Carly's kids. Jack was stunned and asked why Lily would want to hurt Carly. Lily told Jack to go ask Carly and Holden. \n\n\nJack went back into the hallway. Looking at Holden and Carly, he realized what Lily had been trying to say. Jack tore into Carly and Holden, asking how they could do such an inexcusable thing. Holden tried to defend Carly, but Jack said he knew what Carly was like when she wanted something and that Carly didn't care who got hurt in the process. Holden told Jack to stop, because Carly had taken enough from him, but Jack said it was the other way around. Lily walked out of her hospital room and asked what Carly was doing there, telling Jack to \"get her out of here!\" Luke and Noah arrived, and Luke asked his mom if she was okay. Lily said she was going to be fine. Luke asked why Lily was so mad at Holden and Carly. Holden told Carly it might be best if she left, so Carly did. \n\n\nA doctor walked up and told Lily she had to have one more exam before she could leave. Lily left with the doctor, and Luke asked Holden what was going on. Noah excused himself, telling Luke he thought he should go. Luke asked Holden again to tell him what was happening. They sat down to talk, and Holden told Luke about his affair. Holden said he had never intended to hurt Lily or Luke, but that things hadn't been right in his marriage for a long time. Luke asked incredulously, \"And this is how you fix it?\" Luke said he would never understand how his dad could do such a thing. \n\n\nLily came out and said she had been discharged. Holden said he would drive her home, but Lily wanted Luke to take her. Luke left to get his car. Holden asked if he could talk to Lily later; she responded, \"You can talk to my lawyer.\" At home, Luke told Lily that Holden had told him about the affair. Lily asked Luke not to let her problems with Holden influence how he felt about his dad, because Holden was still the same man who had raised Luke and loved him. Luke said the affair had changed everything. \n\n\nCarly went home. Jack followed her, and not knowing that Parker was upstairs, he began yelling at Carly about her affair with Holden. Carly told him it was none of his business, but Jack said it was, because of their kids. Jack accused Carly of having slept with his cousin and best friend to get even with Jack. Carly sneered at Jack and told him not everything she did had something to do with him. Carly told Jack that neither she nor Holden had meant for the affair to happen. Jack asked whether Carly and Holden had slept together more than once. When Carly didn't answer, Jack said, \"That's what I thought.\" He told Carly that she always did whatever she wanted and then claimed she hadn't had a choice. Jack shouted, \"You cannot be forgiven for sleeping with Holden!\" Parker, who had come downstairs to get his keys, overheard him; he grabbed his keys and quickly left. \n\n\nJack and Carly heard the front door close, and they went to see who it was. There was no one there. Jack checked Parker's room, but it was empty. He told Carly that Parker should be at a tennis lesson. Carly was relieved, because she thought it would have been terrible for Parker to find out about her affair that way. Jack asked if there was a better way for him to find out. Carly told Jack to get off his high horse, saying, \"Do you have any idea what a relief it was to be with a man who doesn't criticize me all the time? Get out of here!\" \n\n\nParker sent another text message to Liberty, asking her to meet him at Old Town. Liberty asked Janet if the sex talk was over and she could leave. Janet said yes, but first she hugged her daughter tightly, telling her she loved her. When Liberty found Parker in Old Town, he told her his mother had ruined things for his family once again. Liberty put her arms around Parker to comfort him. \n\n\nJack went to the farm and told Janet what had happened with Carly. Janet told him how sorry she was; she hugged him, saying, \"You deserve better.\" \n\n\nHolden went home and told Luke he was there to see Lily. When Luke told him Lily was resting, Holden said he would wait. Luke replied, \"Don't bother. She doesn't want to see you, and neither do I.\" \n\n\nAt home, Carly poured herself a glass of water. After sipping from it, she broke down, throwing the glass against the wall and sobbing.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
