Susan isn't terribly happy to hear her daughter is leaving, but she is very happy for Ali.  She tells Ali to never let anything get in the way of true love.\n\n\nSpeaking of true love, Celia and Will are kissing, celebrating their newly discovered feelings for each other.  Will asks her if it's all right with her if they kiss, and she answers with yet another kiss.  Ali walks around the corner and breaks up the happy moment.  She is thrilled for Will and Celia.  She tells them that she is leaving and Celia leaves to give the old friends a few moments to talk.

Paul tries to tells her that it isn't her crisis, but his mind is on Rosanna and having run into her earlier.  Paul tells Emily that he is glad she is there and she says she's glad, too - but she doesn't seem convinced.  Susan knocks on the door and neither Paul nor Emily are happy to see her.  She has come to bring a postcard that Daniel sent to his mother from camp.

She is out of breath as she asks him if the baby is okay.  He says yes, that the call that requested her return to the hospital was because she had just given birth and needed care.  Dr. Bob suspected Gwen was having second thoughts, but she assured her she was fine.   Gwen then went to the nursery to look at her son.  But when Craig and Rosanna arrive, Craig is furious to see Gwen by \"his\" baby!  He tries to get her away from the baby, and Rosanna notices that Craig calls it \"his\" baby, more than once.  Craig gives Gwen a sweet story about how he loves \"his\" son and is afraid to lose him. He even tells her about losing Bryant.  Gwen seems to believe Craig, but Rosanna does not.  She asks Craig when he got so attached to this baby.  He tells her it was when she left to talk to the attorney and he stayed with the baby just after it was born.  Rosanna realized that meant Craig was alone with the babies.  Rosanna excuses herself and asks a nurse if she could talk to the nurse on duty that night to thank her for giving her the baby's footprint on a certificate.  The nurse tells her that she quit that very night - it was very out of character for her, that she had before then been very reliable.  Rosanna watched as Craig stared at \"his\" baby and she wondered....\n\n\nNo amount of pleading could convince Iris to tell Carly what happened to her son.  Iris honestly thought Carly remembered, but Carly when she realized Carly had no memory, Iris still refused to tell her.  Carly went home to an angry husband who was trying to get information on Carly's whereabouts from Henry.  When Henry left, Jack wanted to know where Carly had been and seemed angry.  But Carly turned the tables on him when she told him that she learned she couldn't count on him.  She believed Jack knew the truth about Iris's son and that he was trying to protect her.  He was able to convince her that he didn't know and Carly even asked him to help her find out the truth.  Jack agreed, but insisted that Carly allow him to investigate by himself.  She agrees.  Before enjoying an evening of anniversary celebration, Jack tells Carly he has to take out the trash.  She decides to pick up the toys in the living room.  As he takes a large black bag out the front door, he grabs a briefcase at the desk and takes it out behind the garbage bag.  Outside, he opens the briefcase and puts the file - with a photo of a baby carriage - in the garbage bag.  Inside, however, Carly has also seen a baby carriage - as she moves Sage's baby carriage out of the way, she has memories of herself as a small child looking into a baby carriage.....\n\n\n",
