Hallie got to buy some ice cream while Alison and Casey talked about Vienna.  They also discussed how much fun they were having, but Casey had to return to work.  Alison promised to get Hallie back to Will and Gwen, so Casey took off.  He returned almost immediately, however, and gave Alison a kiss.\n\n\nAt the police station, Margo asked Katie to tell her, Will, and Gwen to whom Barbara had made her last phone call.  Katie said she knew it was to Vienna, because she had been with Vienna when she took the call.  Barbara had said that she knew Vienna wasn't really pregnant, and Margo was unhappy that her sister knew about the fake pregnancy also and had kept it a secret.  She chewed out Katie, who told her sister that Vienna had promised to tell Henry the truth before the wedding, but she obviously had not.  Barbara had not showed up, however, and Katie admitted that Vienna had run off after that call, saying she needed to do what had to be done.\n\n\nNext, Katie filled in the blanks by explaining that Vienna had also faked a miscarriage.  Will was convinced that Vienna had done something to his mother, and he was livid with anger at Katie for keeping secrets.  He accused her of still protecting Vienna, so Margo stepped into the fray.  She asked where Vienna was, but Katie had no idea.  Gwen left to pick up Hallie in Old Town, and Margo sent Katie home with strict instructions to call immediately if she heard from either Henry or Vienna.\n\n\nGwen found Alison and Hallie, and she explained that there was no news about Barbara, but she said that Margo and Will were looking for Vienna, who was not really pregnant.  Alison pondered that, and she began to chuckle.  Gwen did not see the humor in the situation, so Alison explained about Casey's involvement with Vienna and the pregnancy scare that had involved him.\n\n\nHenry grabbed Vienna on the massage table at a spa and shouted at her to tell him the truth.  He demanded to know where Barbara was, but Vienna cried that she neither knew nor cared where that woman was.  Henry held her down and continued to yell, but Vienna again claimed she had no idea.  Henry remembered how calm Vienna was just before their wedding, as if the bride knew that Barbara would not show up and interrupt the ceremony.  Vienna swore to Henry that she had not hurt Barbara, and she offered to keep trying to make him see how much she loved him.\n\n\nHenry, however, told Vienna that she had killed what they had.  He said that he would never touch or love her again.  \"I hate you!\" he blurted out, and then he announced that he would drag her to the police station.  He forced Vienna off the table, and she, wearing only a sheet, dashed out the door and jammed it so that Henry could not get out.  \n\n\nHenry called Margo for help, and she arrived soon with Will.  Will cornered Henry and demanded to know what kind of games Henry was playing with his mother.  Henry explained that he and Barbara really did have a relationship, but Will found that \"outrageous.\"  Henry also tried to get Will to understand how devastated both he and Barbara were when they broke up.  Henry finally admitted that he was in love with her.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Chris left another message for Katie on her home phone.  Kim overheard, and she asked if he needed to talk, but Chris declined.  On second thought, however, he went into his mother's office and told her that Katie had kept something life-altering from Henry, who was quite justified in feeling betrayed.  Kim guessed that Vienna was involved, so Chris said that Vienna had faked her pregnancy to keep Henry.  Kim figured out that Katie kept that news to herself, and then she was furious when she thought about how much that had hurt her niece, Barbara.  Chris explained that Katie never meant to hurt Barbara, and then Kim realized that Chris had known the secret, as well.\n\n\nKim was shocked that Chris had not felt obligated to protect Barbara, a member of their own family.  She smacked her son and called the whole mess \"avoidable.\"  Kim called Katie selfish, so Chris stunned his mother again by saying that Barbara already knew the truth about Vienna's condition.\n\n\nKatie went home from the police station and found twelve messages from Chris.  Her doorbell rang, so Katie assumed it was a very persistent Chris, but instead it was a raging Henry.  He asked her to tell him \"where the hell\" Vienna was, and they argued.  Katie had nothing to tell him, but Henry ranted and insisted on searching her house.  He found no one, but Henry still accused Katie of doing terrible damage to his life because she had \"cared\" about him.  All Henry cared about was what had happened to Barbara.  He asked Katie again, but she still had no answers for him.  Henry asked her to call him if she heard from Vienna, because he was desperate to find the woman he loved -- Barbara.\n\n\nCasey was stocking supplies in an exam room in Memorial when he discovered Vienna, clad only in her massage sheet, hiding behind the table.  She begged for his help, but Casey wanted to avoid trouble.  She asked only for clothes to wear out of the hospital, so Casey left to find some scrubs.  He ran into Alison and explained what was going on, including the part where Vienna was wearing only a sheet and claiming that Henry had tried to kill her.  Alison said that Margo thought Vienna was involved in Barbara's disappearance, but Casey found it unbelievable that Vienna had lied about almost everything.  He didn't know what to do, but then Margo arrived, looking for Vienna.  Casey pointed to the exam room and said, \"You can't miss her.\"  They went in only to find the room empty except for a sheet.\n\n\nWill met up with Gwen and Hallie, and he filled Gwen in on the fact that Vienna was also missing.  He believed that Henry was truly in love with his mother, and he said he wouldn't be surprised if the feeling was mutual.  Will was worried that Vienna was the only person who knew where Barbara was, however.  They went back to his mother's hotel room, but when they walked in, Gwen smelled perfume.  Will called out, \"Mom?\" but instead of Barbara, Gwen's kooky mother, Iris, walked in and explained that she had been helping herself to \"Barbie's perfume.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Casey and Allison become closer, as they look after Hallie. Casey is unsure at first, but he then quickly kisses Allison before he heads back to work, as both of them look happy because of this. Henry demands to know what Vienna did with Barbara, as she swears she has not seen her and would not hurt someone even as \u0091hateful' as Barbara, but Henry doesn't believe her and promises they are going to the police. Vienna tries to convince Henry they still belong together, but he tells her that he hates her and his only interest is finding Barbara. Vienna runs away from Henry by locking him in the room. Allison admits to Margo, who is at the station with Will and Gwen, as to what she knows about Barbara and Vienna's last talk. Will is furious and is not sure that Katie isn't still protecting Vienna. Margo and Will go to find Vienna, as Katie heads home and is slightly pleased to find Chris has called her many, many times to check on her. She tries to tell herself that Chris is better off without her though. Meanwhile, Kim is worried about why Chris is leaving Katie so many messages. Chris admits to what happened with Katie, Henry and Vienna, as Kim is furious. She is upset with Katie for being selfish and Chris for not telling her about Barbara since she is family. Chris defends Katie and admits to how worried he is for her. Will and Margo find Henry, as he tells them that he is sure Vienna knows something about Barbara, but Will wants him to first explain about he and Barbara. Henry explains their relationship, which Will is suspect about at first, but then he seems to see how much Henry cares for Barbara before Henry races off promising to do anything to find her. Gwen shares with Allison the latest with Vienna/Henry/Barbara. Allison is stunned to hear there was no baby ever, as she tells Gwen about Casey and Vienna. Henry then goes to find Katie and ask her what she knows about Barbara, as she explains that she knows nothing. Henry doesn't know if he believes her, so he searches her house, as Katie continues to plead for his forgiveness. Henry admits that he believes that she is sorry, but it doesn't make any difference. A towel-clad Vienna begs Casey for help, as she tells him that Henry tried to kill her. Casey finally agrees to help Vienna, but Allison finds him first and explains Vienna was never pregnant and may be involved with Barbara going missing. When Margo shows up, Casey and Allison bring her to the room where Vienna was, but she is gone now. Will and Gwen arrive back at Barbara's and Gwen recognizes a smell in the air \u0096 it is Barbara's perfume. A hopeful Will calls out for his mom hoping she is back, but out comes a smirking Iris instead, playing with Barbara's perfume bottle. Will and Gwen are shocked to see her.",
