At the hospital, Holden wonders where Luke is as his son sits slumped over the wheel of his car after another drunken driving incident. Jack is the cop who finds him. He calls Holden and tells him he'll have to take Luke down to the station. Holden can't come because of the tenuous situation with Lily and the baby, so Damian volunteers. Jade realizes that Will getting his trust fund means he and Gwen will be moving to their own place soon \u2013 without her. Will tells Jade he wants to give her some money to find a new place \u2013 not because he thinks she'd blackmail him, but because they're friends now. Meanwhile, Lia plays up to Casey by agreeing with Margo's suggestion that she drop the charges against Maddie. Margo gives Maddie the news, then insists that she needs to keep her distance from Lia \u2013 and Casey. Maddie ignores the order and goes looking for Casey. She finds Gwen (and an eavesdropping Jade). Distraught, Maddie blurts that Lia is doing to Casey the same thing Jade is doing to Will! Gwen doesn't believe it. Maddie runs into Lia, who taunts that Casey wants nothing to do with a nut-job like her. \n\n\n",
