    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Barbara's hotel room, Gwen and Will challenged Iris, whom they had discovered helping herself to Barbara's perfume.  Iris tried to get Hallie to go to her, but Gwen stopped the little girl.  Gwen accused her mother of leeching onto Barbara's perfume and most likely working her way up to her jewelry.  Iris admitted that she had read on Gwen's Facebook wall that Barbara was going to get in touch with her, so Iris had decided to offer her assistance, too.  She explained that she had lost the money that Barbara had given her and had ended up in the drunk tank in Indianapolis.\n\n\nIris cried crocodile tears and wiped them with a beautiful lace handkerchief of Barbara's.  Will refused to let Iris hold her granddaughter, and he asked her to leave.  A dejected Iris walked to the door, but to everyone's surprise, Hallie ran after her, hugged her, and begged her to stay.  Iris immediately ingratiated herself with Hallie, and she suggested they all have dinner together.  Gwen grabbed Hallie, and Will escorted Iris downstairs.\n\n\nThey ate in the dining room, and Iris told stories about Gwen when she was a little girl.  She dominated the conversation and insisted that they order a huge sundae for Hallie, even though Gwen objected.  Gwen excused herself and went to the lobby, where she took out her phone.  She was punching in numbers when suddenly Iris reached over her shoulder and snatched the phone.  Iris said that only a rotten kid would call the cops on her own mother.  Iris warned that if Gwen turned her in to the cops, she would implicate Barbara, who had also been involved in the baby-selling deal.\n\n\nGwen said that she would exonerate Barbara of all wrongdoing, but Iris was determined to take down Will's mother, too.  Then she reminded Gwen that sweet little Hallie would soon run out of grannies if Gwen made that phone call.  Gwen gave her mother an ultimatum: either Iris would walk out the door of the Lakeview and never return, or Gwen would use the hotel phone to call the police.  Iris wanted to say goodbye to Hallie, so Gwen relented and said her mother could do that, but then she had to get her \"butt to the nearest bus station\" and never get in touch with them again.\n\n\nIris realized it was time to leave, but she wasn't quite finished.  She told Will and Gwen that she had something for them, and she handed Gwen an envelope that, according to Iris, contained the first payment on returning the money Barbara had given her.  Iris claimed she had been \"divinely guided\" and was hoping for a good resolution to Barbara's problems.  Iris expected a bigger reaction from Will and Gwen, both of whom sat there stone-faced and without a comment.  Iris was miffed, and she stood up to leave, but again Hallie ran to her and hugged her legs.  Gwen had a hard time keeping her emotions in check, but she gathered up the little girl, and they headed to the elevators.\n\n\nBack in Barbara's room, Gwen mentioned to Will that she thought they should pack up and leave Oakdale immediately.  She knew her mother was up to something, and she feared that Iris was after something that she didn't yet have.  Gwen refused to go to the seedy Wagon Wheel Motel outside of town, but Will wanted to stay close until they knew his mother was safe.  Finally Gwen suggested that they take Paul and Emily up on their offer to stay at Fairwinds, and Will agreed to call them.\n\n\nOn the street in Old Town, Iris called the Wagon Wheel Motel and reserved a room.\n\n\nLily showed Carly the signed paperwork on their new perfume factory in France. Carly complimented her business partner on getting all their concessions from Fran\u00e7oise, and she was delighted that Lily had negotiated it all on her own.  Carly also asked Lily how she had survived the airport strike and the electrical blackout, and Lily said she had just thought of what Carly would do in those circumstances.  Carly read the contracts in more detail, and she yelled for Lily when she spotted the additional charge of 500,000 euros for \"upgrades.\"  She was horrified at the extra expense, but Lily said she had already covered it.  Lily assured Carly that it would all work out, and then Carly excused herself to go meet Molly to help with some wedding details.  Lily was remarkably calm about Carly's loyalty to Molly.\n\n\nMolly and Holden were in Java discussing their wedding and kissing.  Molly had to leave to meet Carly at Fashions, so Holden checked his phone.  Craig appeared and sat down, asking why Holden wanted to talk to him.  Holden wanted to know what Craig had really been doing with Lily in New York.  He was suspicious, he said, since Craig and Lily told different stories about the incidents.  Craig reminded Holden that, in case he hadn't gotten the memo, Holden wasn't married to Lily anymore.  Holden asked for a straight answer, but instead Craig asked why he cared so much if he wasn't still in love with his ex-wife.\n\n\nCraig went on to brag that he and Lily had gotten \"closer\" on their trip.  Holden demanded to know what that meant, but Craig told him to stop interjecting himself into the life of his ex-wife.  Holden warned Craig to leave Lily alone, and Craig agreed, when and if Lily asked him to.  Craig continued to needle Holden about not even buying him a cup of coffee for their chat, and he declared that he felt \"used.\"\n\n\nMolly was already in Fashions, looking for a dress for the rehearsal dinner, when Carly arrived.  Carly told Molly that she had just been with Lily, and Lily was definitely \"moving on.\"  Molly surprised Carly by saying she was glad her cousin was in business with Lily because then Lily would obsess about her project instead of Holden.  Carly said Lily had persevered through the blackout and strike and closed their deal all on her own.  Molly snickered at the \"all on her own\" portion of that, and then she realized her gaffe.   Carly immediately asked what Molly knew, but her cousin had already clammed up.\n\n\nCarly asked who Lily was with in New York, and Molly finally told her it was Craig.  \"No way,\" exclaimed Carly.  Molly explained that both Lily and Craig had ended up at the same sleazy motel near the airport, and she wondered why Carly was upset at the thought of Craig and Lily's spending time together.  Holden entered Fashions to join Molly, but he was quite distracted.  Molly modeled a dress for him, and he hugged her, as Lily looked in the window and her eyes made contact with Holden's.\n\n\nLucinda, who was looking for Holden, barged into the Snyder farmhouse.  She instead found Gabriel, who explained that he was working for Jack.  Lucinda reminded him that he had taken a \"sizeable chunk\" of her money to leave town, but Gabriel said he had lost it all in a poker game.  Lucinda sat with the boy, but she failed to intimidate him.  She wondered why, after what she had paid him and what Craig must have given him from the insurance settlement, the boy was \"toiling for minimum wage.\"  Gabriel said he had turned down money from Craig because he wasn't \"for sale.\"\n\n\nThat amused Lucinda, who said that she really wanted to know what Craig was up to.  \"How the hell should I know?\" griped Gabriel.  Lucinda started out, but Gabriel stopped her.  He began asking her questions about her mothering skills, but Lucinda turned a deaf ear and walked out.\n\n\nCraig was Gabriel's next visitor at the farm, and he found his son designing French doors for Janet's cabin.  Craig told the boy that he was destined for things greater than handyman work, and asked if Gabriel would like to work for his father when he was finished with his obligation to Jack.  Gabriel said he had already observed how Craig worked, especially the lying and stealing part at Monte Carlo. Then Gabriel lambasted Craig for sleeping with his mother and then ignoring her for the rest of her short life.  Craig shouted that Lucinda Walsh was to blame, so Gabriel asked if Lucinda had impregnated his mother, and he wondered if he should be calling her \"Dad.\"  Craig calmed down and asked the boy to at least consider his offer.\n\n\nLily arrived home to find her mother there.  She was excited to tell Lucinda that she had closed the deal in New York all on her own, and she and Carly owned a perfume factory in France.  Lucinda was worried until her daughter said that she hadn't done it exactly alone, but then Lily named Carly as the creative force behind the company.  Lucinda asked what resources Lily had used to close the deal, but Lily brushed her off by saying that didn't matter.  She was very excited about her new business, and she said she hoped that, for once, her mother was proud of her too.  Lucinda assured Lily that she had always been proud of her.\n\n\nLucinda appeared to be having second thoughts about how she had used Fran\u00e7oise Pacaud to sabotage Carlisle Frangrances, so she went outside on the patio and called Fran\u00e7oise.  Lucinda told her to speed up the climax of their plan and not to prolong Lily's agony.  She said that the sooner Craig Montgomery was ruined, the better.  Gabriel was hiding behind the latticework on the patio and heard all of Lucinda's side of the conversation.\n\n\nCarly was sketching the new Carlsle Fragrance logo, but her mind was on the question of why Lily and Craig had been together in New York.  She got out her phone, but she put it away, saying, \"Some things have to be said in person,\" and she left the house.  She went to the Lakeview and caught Craig just as he returned to his suite.  \"What the hell are you up to now?\" she demanded.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Iris claims to have changed her ways and tells Gwen and Will that she is clean and sober because she has found God. Gwen doesn't believe Iris but wishes that what she told her was true. When Gwen tries to call the police to tell them Iris is in town, Iris threatens to take Barbara to jail with her, because Barbara was also involved in the adoption scam that gave them Hallie. Iris and Gwen agree that if she leaves town now, Gwen won't call the police. Iris gives Will the first installment to pay Barbara back for the money Barbara gave to her. Gwen knows Iris isn't going to leave town until she gets whatever it is she wants, so she asks Will to call Paul and see if they can move into Fairwinds until they find Barbara. Gwen is right about Iris who calls the Wagon Wheel Motel to make a reservation. Lucinda decides to speed up the pace of her plan to ruin Craig. She calls her friend Francoise to let her know because she doesn't want Lily to suffer too much and have time to heal from the pain. Lucinda feels badly about her plan when Lily tells her how happy she is about the new perfume company, since she has something positive to focus on that helps her keep her mind off Holden's wedding. Gabriel overhears Lucinda's call to Francoise and knows Lucinda wants to ruin Craig. Holden warns Craig to stay away from Lily and keep her away from whatever shady business he is doing now. Craig tells Holden that he will stay away from Lily only if he wants him to do so, and besides Lily isn't Holden's concern anymore since he is marrying Molly. Molly and Holden make the final wedding plans but he is distracted because he worries that Lily is getting too involved with Craig. Molly tells Carly that Lily and Craig bumped into each other in New York. She worries that Craig is up to something since neither Lily nor Craig mentioned anything to her about running into each other in New York. Craig wants Gabriel to work with him once he has finished the cabin, but Gabriel thinks working with Craig is a bad idea. Carly thinks she has figured out what Craig is up to now and bursts into his hotel to confront him about his latest scheme.",
