Luke looked unimpressed and said he came to fix Lucinda's computer. The doorbell rang and moments later Keith walked in with flowers. Luke made snide remarks about Keith being there until Lily rescued him and walked him to the door. They were kissing good-bye when Lucinda, Holden, Sierra and Meg walked in. Lucinda told Keith to leave immediately! Sierra gave Lily a disgusted look at they led Lucinda into the living room. Lucinda asked for a mochaccino and Luke left to get it. Keith left and Meg asked what Lily was doing. Lily told her it was none of her business and Meg said that anything that affects Lucinda is her business. They argued until Holden came in and asked what they were arguing about. Meg blew it off and left to pick up Lucinda's prescription. Lily said that she let Meg get to her. Holden said he knew that Lily was trying to make it work with Keith but Lily had to think about her mother's wellness first. Lucinda came back downstairs and told Lily and Holden that what she wanted most was for them to be together because they had more happiness with each other than they could ever have with anyone else.\n\n\nBarbara arrived at Paul's wanting a ride to the funeral. When she saw Emily dressed in black she asked Paul why. Paul said Emily was attending the service with him. Barbara started in with Emily until Paul said it was enough. Paul defended Emily and shouted at Barbara that Emily was going because he needed and wanted her there. He told Barbara to LIVE with it!!\n\n\nJennifer, Mike and Dusty were talking to the minister about the service. Dusty excused himself. The minister told Mike and Jennifer where he wanted them to sit and offered his condolences. Mike left and ran into Katie who was worried about him. Mike didn't want her to stay for obvious reasons. Mike said he would call her. Dusty came out and told Mike that Jennifer needed him. Dusty gave Katie a bad time about being there and they argued. Henry arrived to rescue Katie as he always did. Inside, Jennifer told Hal, Bob, and Mike that she invited Craig to the service. Mike asked Jennifer why she didn't tell him about Craig. Jennifer said she didn't think she needed to run things by him. He said he just wanted to know what to expect. Jennifer snapped back that life was like that. You don't always know what to expect! \n\n\nThe service began for John Dustin Kasnoff. The minister spoke of John's innocence and how much he was loved. Jennifer tried to say a few words but broke down so Paul finished for her.  She wanted her baby's life to count for something more than what they were grieving today. She named him John because it means God's gift and Dustin for the man who brought him into the world. At that moment Dusty responded with a kiss on Jennifer's cheek. Jennifer wanted Craig to say a few words but he was at the hospital holding his son as Rosanna looked on. Craig told the baby that he came into their lives at the perfect time and he was about to meet the best Mom he could ever have. Rosanna cooed over the baby and Craig thought it was the most beautiful site.\n\n\nAfter the service ended, Will walked outside to find Gwen standing there. Will was surprised to see her. Gwen said she was trying to be a friend. Will was grateful. Gwen told Will about her baby's adoption and the baby would be living like a prince in Oakdale. Inside, Mike was waiting to take Jennifer home and was surprised to still see him there. He said he would be there for her for as long as she needed. As she was about to say something, Dusty appeared at the door.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Bob ran into Rosanna and asked why Craig wasn't at the service. Rosanna was surprised because she didn't know anything about it. Bob said burying a child is the worse thing that can happen so maybe Craig couldn't handle going through it again. Rosanna said Bob was probably right but became more concerned about Craig's behavior. She returned home and pulled out the footprint of the baby and noticed the crease wasn't there and remarked it wasn't the same baby! \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "At the Luther's corners church Jennifer's family and friends mourn the loss of little John Dustin Kasnoff. Gwen arrives at the church just before the end of the service to support Will and because she felt she should be at the funeral. At the hospital Rosanna's suspicions about Craig grow when Bob informs her that Craig didn't show up for the funeral of his baby even though Jennifer invited him. Rosanna wonders why Craig was so eager to see their adoptive baby instead of going to his biological son's funeral. Later Rosanna's suspicions about Craig are confirmed when she looks at the baby's foot print from the hospital and she notices it isn't the same picture the nurse who mysteriously quit her job in the middle of her shift showed her the day her baby was born.",
