She tells him that money changes people, and she doesn't want that to happen to them. He tells her from now on, they'll make all financial decisions together. He asks her what Maddie said to her about him and Jade that got her so upset; she tells him Maddie said they looked guilty when she walked up and saw them hugging, and she asks if she has any reason to worry about him and Jade. He says absolutely not, and he assures her the hug was friendly, and that's it. Gwen tells him she knows that he'll never lie to her again after what they've been through.\n\n\nJack brings Luke into the police station for arraignment, telling him he'll be charged with driving under the influence. Luke tells Damian exactly what happened, saying how much he feels like an outsider because his friends don't know he's gay.  He tells Damian that he wishes he could go a thousand miles away and start over again with people who know nothing about him. A lawyer hired by Damian arrives and discusses the case with Luke while Damian waits outside. Jack tells Damian that Holden called to say Lily and the baby are fine for now and he's on his way down for Luke's arraignment. By the time Holden arrives, however, Damian tells him Luke has already been arraigned and is about to be released into his custody to go home. Holden is very angry with Damian, accusing him of conspiring to make him look bad with his son and to split them up. Luke comes into the room and tells Holden to stop, that Damian isn't the problem here --- Holden is. Holden tells Luke that he thinks Damian has been lying to him, trying to tell him that Holden didn't want anything to do with him when the opposite is true, but Luke glances at Damian and then tells Holden that Damian never led him to believe that Holden didn't want him around --- Holden did that all by himself. Holden apologizes for Luke having felt that way and tells Luke he just wants him to come back home. Luke apologizes about the drinking and tells Holden he and Lily deserve better from him, but right now, with Holden having so much on his plate, he thinks it's best if he doesn't add his baggage to the situation, and he tells Holden he's staying with Damian. Holden leaves, and Damian tells Luke that if he really meant it about going thousands of miles away and starting over, he can make that happen by taking Luke to Malta with him.\n\n\nCarly's credit card is declined when she tries to pay for the opened $300 bottle of champagne at the Lakeview, and the waiter goes to get Lisa. Lisa tells Carly that she'll take a personal check from her, but Carly confesses her bank account is empty and she's been living off of her credit cards recently while she tries to get her business started. Jack shows up in time to hear this, and Lisa admits to having called him when she heard Carly was having problems paying her bill. Carly is upset that Jack was called, telling them both that Jack is not responsible for her anymore. Jack tries to give Lisa money for the champagne, but Carly tells Lisa not to touch Jack's money. She tells Jack, \"You are not my husband anymore---I don't need you!\" She tells Lisa that she'll wash dishes to cover the bill, but Lisa tells her this isn't the \"I Love Lucy\" show, and Carly can't just waltz into the kitchen and start washing dishes. After Carly again tells Jack that she doesn't need to be rescued by him, he responds, \"You can wash dishes till your fingers shrivel up; I won't offer my help again.\" He leaves, and Lisa apparently has a change of heart, because later, they come out of the kitchen, having washed all the dishes together, with Lisa telling Carly that every \"Lucy\" needs an \"Ethel.\" Lisa suggests they finish that champagne now. They sit down to drink, and Lisa asks Carly what she's going to do now to make ends meet; as Carly begins to respond, she sees Simon walk into the room.\n\n\nAt Mike and Katie's house, Mike punches Simon as Katie arrives. Simon tries to convince them that his being in town has nothing to do with Katie, but they are unconvinced, and they also don't believe him when he says he's rich now because he struck oil on his sheep ranch in Australia. Mike goes inside to call Jack to ask him to check out Simon's story, and meanwhile, Katie begs Simon to stay away from her and from her friends, telling him tearfully that she just can't stand the thought of running into him repeatedly on the street and having to make chitchat. Mike comes back, and Katie asks Simon again to stay away from her friends, especially Carly, and Simon says he will. He leaves, and later, Jack comes by and tells Katie and Mike that Simon's story about the oil checked out, and Simon is indeed now a very rich man. Katie warns Jack that Simon might be trying to get in good with Carly; Jack says that's none of his business, but Carly is too smart to get involved with Simon.\n\n\nLia runs into Maddie outside Crash and tells her that she's with Casey now, and Casey doesn't need someone who's going to \"go postal\" every 10 minutes. She tells Maddie that she and Casey are even planning to break into the country club tonight to go skinny-dipping. Casey calls Lia on her cell phone, and her side of the conversation is designed to make Maddie think that Casey is \"hot\" for Lia and can't wait to see her, even though Casey is actually telling Lia that he's having second thoughts about their plans. Lia tells Casey she's on her way, then she hangs up and tells Maddie not to worry about the damage to her car, because her dad has already ordered a new BMW for her. Maddie, angry, goes into Crash and takes one of the knives out of the knife block. At the country club, Casey tries several times to get Lia to leave, both before and after they go swimming, but Lia wants to stay and take a hot, steamy shower with Casey. Casey bows out, and Lia tells him he can go if he wants to, but she's going to take a shower anyway. Casey leaves, and when Lia hears someone approaching, she assumes it's Casey coming back. She calls out to him, but no one answers, and when Lia pulls back the shower curtain, she sees someone with a knife standing over her. As she screams, she is stabbed repeatedly, falling to the shower floor dead.\n\n\n",
