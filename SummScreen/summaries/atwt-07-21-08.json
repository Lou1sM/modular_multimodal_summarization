Alison was comforted that Rick was gone, but her relief was short-lived. Susan handed Alison a package from her father, Larry McDermott, and Alison was stunned. Alison did not know why her father was contacting her after so long, but Susan said it was up to her daughter to decide whether or not she wanted to open it. Aaron arrived to meet Alison and Susan left the two to talk. \n\n\nAfter deliberating with Aaron about whether or not to open the package, Alison decided to see what her dad had sent. She opened the box and found an unsigned note congratulating her on attending nursing school, and a bracelet. Alison was not sure what to make of the gift and wondered why her father had abandoned her. She did not know if she wanted to wear the bracelet, but decided to give it a try. \n\n\nAlison decided to go for a jog around a local track to help relieve some stress and, after a few laps, found herself winded. Chris had come to the track for a little exercise and noticed Alison bent over and gasping for air. He offered to help her learn the right way to run and said she needed to start by relaxing and stretching. He started to massage her shoulders and then the two began stretching together. After a while, Chris told Alison she was ready to run and asked her if she wanted any company. The two laughed and talked as they jogged, but stopped when Aaron showed up. As Alison was talking to Aaron, she got light-headed and Aaron had to help her off the track as Chris stepped back and watched. Alison recovered while Aaron got her some water. Chris asked her if she was okay and she said she was. When she stood to leave for class, Alison's new bracelet got stuck to her shorts and she remarked to Chris that she had just received it as a gift from her father. \n\n\nOn the search for Sofie's real killer, Paul and Meg arrived at Mike's office and tried to convince him to help them find out who Sofie was dating before her untimely death. Mike was reluctant to help until he learned that Meg, not Paul, was the prime suspect. Mike said the only man Sofie spoke of was Paul. Meg explained that Sofie's fetus was too young to be Paul's, so she must have been sleeping with someone else. Mike mentioned he had spoken to Cole after Sofie's murder and their conversation led him to believe Sofie was not seeing anyone at the time of her death. Mike told the couple he had nothing more that would help them. Meg was discouraged at the lack of information, but Paul believed they were heading in the right direction and they needed to talk to the men in Sofie's life: Cole, Aaron, and Chris. The two left to visit Barbara and plan their next move. \n\n\nBarbara returned to her suite at the Lakeview and noticed her jewelry box had been ransacked. When she turned to leave, she was confronted by Cole, who stopped her from leaving. Barbara wanted her jewelry back, but Cole told her it was a deposit on the blackmail money she owed. Cole reminded Barbara that he had seen her kill Sofie. Barbara rushed to the door to try to escape, but Cole slammed the door shut and pulled a gun on Barbara. Cole pushed her out of the room and told her they were going for a ride. Barbara wanted to know where Cole was taking her, but he refused to say. As they got off the elevator, Cole saw Paul and Meg in the lobby. He pulled Barbara back into the elevator to avoid a confrontation with Paul and told her to be quiet. Paul and Meg walked into the dining room to get coffee and Cole pushed Barbara through the lobby, only stopping momentarily when they ran into Lisa. Lisa was stunned to see the two together, but Cole made up an excuse and rushed Barbara out of the building. \n\n\nPaul and Meg sat in the bar and tried to figure out what their next move should be to clear Meg of any suspicion in Sofie's death. They decided to split up and talk to as many people as possible who Sofie knew. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Cole had taken Barbara to an abandoned building where he had been living. Cole tied Barbara up and then demanded that she write a note to Paul asking for $100,000. Barbara refused to write the note even after Cole threatened to kill her. Cole was flustered by Barbara's refusal and, in an attempt to get his composure back, injected himself with drugs. Barbara realized that Cole knew how to use a needle and was the one who killed Sofie. In his drug-induced haze, Cole decided to write the letter for Barbara. As Cole wrote the letter, he began to doze off. Barbara wanted to get out of the horrible situation as quickly as possible and asked him to skip the letter and just phone Paul. Cole thought Barbara was trying to trick him and he began to scream at Barbara. As Cole raged on, Barbara suddenly blurted out that she knew Cole was behind Sofie's death. \n\n\nA drugged-up Cole admitted that he had killed Sofie after he learned that she had lied to him about the money Paul had given her. Cole told Barbara about an argument he had with Sofie the night she died and detailed how he injected her after she called him a loser. Cole held up another needle and told Barbara she needed to listen to him or he would stick her as well. Barbara agreed to do what Cole wanted and asked him to untie her so she could write the ransom note to Paul. Barbara wrote the letter and Cole quickly tied her back up while he delivered the note to Mike at Worldwide with the instructions that it be given to Paul. \n\n\nWhile Cole was out, Barbara was able to untie the ropes. She began to scream for help, but when no one came, she found Cole's drug supply and filled a syringe. She sat back in the chair and waited for Cole to return. When Cole came back, Barbara started to choke and asked Cole to get her some water. When he turned around to get her a drink, Barbara stood up and stabbed him with the needle, injecting him with a huge dose of his own drugs. Cole swung around and grabbed Barbara by the throat, but then collapsed on the floor. \n\n\nPaul and Meg met up outside Barbara's suite after they had spoken separately with Chris and Aaron. The couple exchanged notes about their meetings with Aaron and Chris and both noticed that everyone who knew Sofie had brought up Cole. They decided that their next step was to find Cole and figure out what he knew about Sofie before her death. With that resolved, Paul knocked on Barbara's door, but was worried when there was no answer. Paul and Meg found Lisa and asked her to open Barbara's room. Lisa agreed and told the pair she had seen Barbara earlier leaving with Cole. Paul was confused about why his mother would go anywhere with Cole, but once he and Meg saw the inside of Barbara's room, they realized that Barbara had not left with Cole under her own will. \n\n\nAcross town, Mike read the note Cole had brought for Paul and immediately called Paul and told him to meet him at Worldwide. Once Meg and Paul showed up, Mike explained the letter and that Cole appeared to be on drugs when he brought the letter. As they were all discussing what to do next, Paul received a call from Barbara pleading for help. Barbara explained that Cole had kidnapped her and she had knocked him out, but was trapped and did not know where he had taken her. Paul put her on speakerphone as she described her surroundings. Based on what Barbara said, Mike figured out that Barbara was in the old mill cellar. Just then her phone went dead, leaving Barbara alone with Cole, who she feared would be coming to anytime. Mike was determined to call the police for help, but Paul and Meg left to see if they could rescue Barbara on their own. Right after her phone dropped out, Cole woke up and Barbara tried to fight him off. Cole managed to grab Barbara by the throat again and everything went dark. Later Paul pushed his way into the room and surprisingly found Barbara alone, huddled behind the door. Cole had escaped before Paul and Meg had arrived. \n\n\nPaul and Meg took Barbara to the hospital where Susan admitted Barbara to watch her overnight. Paul called Mike and explained they had found Barbara in the cellar, but there was no sign of Cole when they got there. Meg left to get Barbara's antibiotics. As she looked for the correct vial she felt a gun go into her back. She turned around and found Cole holding her at gunpoint. Cole told Meg to open up the narcotics cabinet so he could load up on drugs before he left town. Meg did as Cole said and tried to open the cabinet, but she did not have the keys to the drug locker. Flustered by Meg's inability to get him more drugs, Cole shot Meg and then ran out. Meg stumbled towards the door, but collapsed to the floor holding her side and bleeding profusely. \n\n\nAs Cole tried to run from the hospital, Mike arrived with the police and tackled Cole. He called Paul and gave him the news that Cole was in custody. Paul told his mom about Cole's arrest and Barbara commented that the nightmare was over; unknown to them Meg was bleeding to death down the hall.\n\n\n",
