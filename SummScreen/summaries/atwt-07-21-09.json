Mason gave the boy some favorable comments about writing and told him not to underestimate his abilities.  Luke approached, and Noah introduced him to Mason, who invited Luke to join them.  The professor suggested that Noah go the film festival route with his finished project, and he explained to the boys that was how he had gotten his start.  He complimented the two of them on their wonderful relationship, but said that he had to leave because he had someone waiting for him for dinner.\n\n\nAfter Mason left, Luke admitted that the professor was a nice guy.  Noah panicked that he would not be able to finish his project on time, so Luke encouraged him to stop stressing himself and to relax.  He suggested that they go to Metro and kick back and have a fun evening. Noah could hit the grind in the morning. The two of them kissed, and they left for the club.\n\n\nBarbara took Paul home to Fairwinds when he was released from the hospital, and he was impressed with his estate.  His mother explained that Paul was rather well off financially, and he asked about his father.  Barbara took a deep breath and then described James Stenbeck as a monster whose death was the source of much relief for many people in Oakdale.\n\n\nBonnie found Dusty in the Lakeview lounge, and she chewed him out for not calling a meeting with her to prepare to defend himself against the charge of attempted murder.  Dusty said there was no need for such preparation, since he had decided to plead guilty.  Bonnie threw a fit and attempted to talk Dusty out of such nonsense.   She reminded him that if he went to prison, he would miss ten to fifteen years of Johnny's life.  Bonnie refused to just stand by and watch Dusty ruin his life, so Dusty gave her a dismissive wave and fired her.\n\n\nAt the farm, Holden and Meg shared lemonade and discussed Paul's injury.  Meg told her brother about the microchip in Paul's brain, but Holden found that incredible.  He warned Meg that Paul was only attempting to get on her good side again and that she should not fall for the ruse.  Holden cautioned her to stay away from Damian, as well.\n\n\nAfter Holden left, Meg went to Fairwinds, and Paul seemed pleased to see her.  Barbara asked Meg to have a one-on-one conversation with her son to see if that sparked any memory.  Paul acted shy with Meg, and he seemed quite taken with her appearance.  He said that he couldn't understand how he could have forgotten someone so beautiful.  He asked more questions and began to realize that he and Meg had gone through many serious problems.  Meg told him that he had been a compulsive liar who had violent mood swings and was totally untrustworthy.\n\n\nThe climax came when Meg described how Paul had kidnapped their daughter and taken her out of state.  Paul stopped Meg's monologue at that point and asked why on earth she wanted anything to do with him.  Meg said that she felt somewhat responsible for not recognizing that Paul was not in control of his actions because of the microchip.  Paul thanked her and then asked her to go home, telling her to walk out the door and never return.  He promised her a divorce, which he realized she had wanted, but he said he felt no connection with her or Eliza.  Meg was very hurt that Paul was giving up on his daughter.\n\n\nAt the Worldwide offices, Damian told Lily that he had found a specialist in New York who might be able to help Paul with his memory loss.  The challenge was that the doctor would need special permission to get privileges to practice at Memorial, and that took time.  Damian asked Lily to contact Lucinda, who was on the hospital board, to see if she would use her influence to expedite the privileges.  Before she answered, Lily called Damian a liar when he said that he felt some obligation to help Paul because of his minor role in the bombing incident.  She reminded him that Paul had cost Damian millions of dollars in damages, and she said that she knew that Damian was just trying to impress Meg.\n\n\nLily called Lucinda, who agreed to put on the necessary pressure to allow the New York doctor to treat Paul at Memorial.  Damian, however, learned that the doctor was not taking any new patients, so he asked Lily to drop everything and fly with him to New York on Lucinda's jet to meet with the doctor in person.  Damian flattered Lily about her powers of persuasion, and she agreed to accompany him.\n\n\nIn New York, Lily and Damian explained the details of Paul's injury to the specialist, and he was intrigued.  Damian offered him the use of the Worldwide jet, and Lily persuaded him to clear his schedule for a couple of days.  With the doctor's promise that he would soon visit Oakdale, Lily and Damian flew home.\n\n\nBonnie went to Dusty's room and told him that she refused to stay fired.  She argued passionately that he needed to fight back, and she suddenly kissed him.  Dusty enjoyed the kiss, but he broke away and told Bonnie that she was wasting her time.  Bonnie suggested that, just this once, the damsel could save the white knight.  Dusty called her offer tempting, and they were about to kiss again when someone knocked on the door.  Dusty answered it, and Holden walked in.  Bonnie made a hasty exit, as Dusty guessed that Holden's appearance was not a social visit.\n\n\nHolden and Dusty went down to the bar and began talking about Meg.  Holden wanted to hear the bomb story from Dusty, so Dusty explained how Damian had not stuck to the original plan and had foiled the whole plot.  Holden was easily persuaded that Damian was also to blame for the bombing, and he left Dusty knowing that it was up to him and his family to deal with Damian Grimaldi.  Dusty headed for the elevator but Bonnie intercepted him and asked if he had hired a new lawyer yet.  She again offered to help, and Dusty said he would consider it, as he got into the elevator alone.\n\n\nLuke and Noah arrived at Metro and saw Mason and another man having some wine and a serious discussion.  The boys were surprised that the professor's \"significant other\" was a man, because neither of them had known that Mason was gay.  They decided not to interrupt, but Mason saw them and waved them over.  He introduced his partner as \"George,\" and he invited the boys to join them.  Mason explained that he and George had been in the middle of a lovers' quarrel, but he was ready to \"kiss and make up.\"  George said some disparaging and hurtful things to Mason and got up and walked out.\n\n\nMason explained that his partner was from a wealthy family and had no need to work.  He did nothing during the day, so when Mason returned from work, George was very needy.  Luke and Noah listened carefully without comments, as Mason paid the bill for them all and left.  Luke told Noah that when the men were arguing, he projected Noah and himself into the next few years.  The experience had definitely given Luke something to think about.\n\n\nBarbara served Paul some soup and asked about his visit with Meg.  Paul said that he had told her to leave and never return, and his mother was shocked.  She argued that he needed to give his memory more time to heal, but Paul was not convinced.  He took a call from Lily telling him that they had found a brain specialist to help him, but Paul was in a dilemma.  He told Barbara that from what everyone had told him about himself, he did not think he wanted to be Paul Ryan anymore.\n\n\nHolden returned home and found Lily and Damian there.  Lily explained that she had just returned from a quick trip to New York, and that Damian had found someone to treat Paul.  Lily went into the kitchen to see to dinner, and Holden told Damian that Dusty had told him the story of the errant bomb.  As Damian left, Holden said that he might have Lily and Meg fooled, but Damian was not fooling him.  He then told Lily that he was very worried about Damian's relationship with Meg, but he was willing to give Damian the benefit of the doubt.  Holden and Lily clinked glasses and drank wine.\n\n\nDamian dropped in on Meg and told her about the specialist for Paul.  Meg was not overly enthusiastic about the news, and she told Damian that Paul had said that he did not want to see her or their baby any more.  Meg was upset not knowing what kind of man Paul would be after treatment by the New York doctor.  Damian took her in his arms and hugged her.\n\n\n",
