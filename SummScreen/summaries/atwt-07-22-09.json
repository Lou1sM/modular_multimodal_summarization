He let out a loud whoop and was very excited-until Margo and Riley showed up. Then Casey made one of his hasty exits without mentioning a word about his big news.  Margo complained about Casey's moods and remarked that her son had gone from cheery to gloomy in a matter of seconds.\n\n\nRiley noticed the open letter on the table, so he handed it to Margo, who read it and rejoiced.  She wanted to do something special for Casey, so Riley suggested a surprise party at lunchtime.  Riley offered to round up the guests, and he left to do that.  Tom joined Margo and was also excited for his son.  Margo clued Tom in about the surprise party, and she asked him to make sure Casey would be home at the right time without knowing why.\n\n\nHunter was working at the Intruder office when Larry McDermott surprised him.  Larry seemed unaffected when Hunter calmly said he hated Larry, then Emily walked in.  Larry tried to hand Hunter a package, but Emily yelled at him to get out.  Larry insisted on giving Hunter a music box that had belonged to his mother, Aurora, and he explained that he had taken possession of it when he and Aurora stopped seeing one another, and she had left it in the hotel room where they used to meet.  Emily told Larry to leave, and Hunter agreed, so Larry walked out.  Hunter opened the music box, but reiterated that he didn't want it.\n\n\nHunter resumed work, but he was unhappy.  Emily asked what was wrong, and Hunter said that he was bummed that his mother had kept so much of her life a secret from him.  Emily tried to cheer him up by reminding him that he had a whole new family in Oakdale, and that she was his mother, too.  Hunter declared firmly that Emily was not his mother, and she was hurt by his dismissal.\n\n\nAt Java, Alison entered and spotted Casey, so she turned to leave.  Casey asked her to wait, and offered her a cup of coffee.  They got off to a bad start that ended with another of Casey's hasty exits.  Riley walked in and told Alison that Casey had been readmitted to college, and Alison felt terrible about how she had just treated him.  Riley mentioned the surprise lunch party for Casey, but Alison expressed very little interest in attending.  Riley asked to see her phone, and he pointed out a picture on it of Alison and Casey in happier times.  He said that Casey often moped in his room listening to sad music and looking at that same picture.  He urged her to join the party, and said other nice things about Casey.\n\n\nCasey went to Memorial and told his grandfather that he would have to find a replacement driver for the senior van.  Bob was unhappy at first, until he realized that Casey was telling him that he was going back to college.  Casey accepted Bob's congratulations, and took off.  Tom found his father then and told him about the party.  Bob asked Tom if Riley was still living at his house, and was surprised to hear that he was.\n\n\nRiley went back home and delivered the gift Margo had ordered for Casey.  It was a top-of-the-line laptop computer, wrapped with a bow. Riley called her \"Mom,\" which delighted Margo, but he had made sure that no one else was there.  Riley said he felt uncomfortable around Tom, who seemed to be always watching him, but Margo insisted that they continue with the charade and keep the secret that Riley was Adam.  Tom arrived home, followed shortly by Bob, Kim, and Lisa.  Nancy was a bit under the weather, so she couldn't make it.  Tom called Casey and, in a serious voice, asked him to be home as soon as he could.\n\n\nHunter found Alison at the hospital and asked to speak with her.  She had to finish some work because she was going to Casey's party over her lunch break.  Hunter scolded her for giving Casey any more attention, and he was worried that Casey would hurt Alison's feelings again.  Hunter announced that he was going to the party with her.\n\n\nLarry ran into Emily in the Lakeview lounge and sat down with her.  She tried to chase him away, but he asked for the chance to make things right for her.  Emily accused him of stealing her unborn children, but Larry interrupted and asked if she remembered his friends who worked in in vitro fertilization in Chicago.  He promised Emily that, if she wished, she could move up to first priority on the waiting list, and she could give birth again.  Susan passed by at that moment and heard Larry's comment, and she was outraged.\n\n\nLarry told Susan to stay out of her daughter's love life, and Emily said that, for once, her mother was right.  Then, however, she called Larry a liar and a fake.  He argued that science was almost perfect in his field, and he guaranteed Emily another baby.  Emily declared that she no longer wanted to be pregnant, and that she, Hunter, and Alison wanted nothing more to do with Larry.  Larry accused Emily of throwing away the child she had always wanted to love, and he left the two women.\n\n\nEmily told Susan to ask what was obviously on her mind, so her mother wanted to know why Emily had changed her mind about wanting a baby.  Emily said that she had Hunter, and he needed her while he was grieving for Aurora.\n\n\nThe party people heard someone approaching, so they got ready to yell \"Surprise!\" but the visitors turned out to be Alison and Hunter.  Alison introduced Hunter as her brother, and explained how that had happened.  Lisa's comment was, \"Oh, great, another Stewart to contend with, but at least this one's a man!\"  Tom explained to Hunter that Hunter also had a half-brother, Daniel, and the conversation got a bit convoluted as Hunter tried to figure out how Tom and Emily had produced a baby.\n\n\nTom spied Casey's car pull up, so everyone got a noisemaker and let Casey have it when he walked in the door.  He took one look and did his signature move -- a fast getaway.  Margo ran after him, however, and caught him.  Casey was disappointed that he hadn't gotten to tell his folks the news about college, but he did agree to go back inside and greet his guests.  Riley maneuvered Hunter away from Alison so that she and Casey could have some private time.  They apologized to one another, and Casey said how glad he was that Alison had shown up.\n\n\nCasey leaned over and kissed Alison, and that disturbed Hunter, who was watching the couple carefully.  Hunter tried to get Alison to leave, but she was not yet ready.  Hunter got very protective of his new sister, and she told him that she was capable of making her own decisions.  Hunter was upset, and he walked out without Alison.\n\n\nLisa asked Margo about Riley, and Margo was defensive and suggested that everyone make him feel welcome.  Tom took photos of Casey with the guests, as Alison stood off to the side next to Dr. Bob.  She clearly heard him say, \"Nurse, would you send in the next patient?\"  Alison giggled at first, but then she realized that Bob was serious and she asked if he was all right.  Bob seemed surprised and asked why she had inquired.  Tom called Bob then for a picture, leaving Alison quite confused.  She mentioned the incident to Kim, and Bob overheard and said the comment had been an example of his lame humor.\n\n\nKim, Bob, and Lisa took off, and Casey offered to walk Alison back to the hospital.  He also told Riley that the day had been awesome.  Margo and Riley cleaned up, and she was pleased at Casey's reaction to the laptop and to Riley's participation in the festivities.  Riley needed to do something, so he left, but promised to be back for dinner -- if Tom was cooking.\n\n\nAfter Riley left, Tom asked Margo when the young man might be moving on.  He said that Bob had questioned him about that, but he also wanted to know for himself.  Margo said that she had told Riley that he could live there as long as he wanted.\n\n\nBack at the office, Emily walked in on Hunter looking at Aurora's music box.  They talked about grief, and Emily promised that she was not trying to replace Hunter's mother.  Hunter suggested they stick strictly to business.\n\n\nLisa, Bob, and Kim had a drink at the Lakeview bar, and Lisa gave a great deal of credit to Bob for Casey's going back to school.  She excused herself for a moment to take care of a problem at the desk, and Kim told Bob that he was pretty terrific.  Bob returned the compliment to Kim, but he called her \"Lisa.\"  Kim caught the mistake, but Bob denied it.  Kim took the champagne glass out of Bob's hands and told him that he had imbibed a bit too much drink.\n\n\nCasey and Alison had a rendezvous on the hospital roof, and it went well.  They kissed and made some plans.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Larry arrives with a gift for Hunter; it was a music box of his mother's. Hunter kicks Larry out afterwards still angry and bitter with him. Emily tries to talk with Hunter about his feelings, but he doesn't want her support either and tells her that she is not his mother before he stomps out. Casey finds out that he is being allowed to re-enroll at O.U in the fall, but balks at telling his family when Margo walks in wanting to make Adam breakfast. He then runs into Alison, and is excited to talk with her, but she is more interested in an apology so he leaves without saying a word to her either. Margo and Adam realize what Casey was keeping from them when they see the O.U. letter and Adam suggests throwing Casey a surprise party. Adam invites Alison, who realizes what Casey was trying to tell her before she got angry with him. Hunter finds Alison and wants to talk, but she has plans. Hunter isn't pleased when he hears where she is going, but decides he is going too so Casey can't make her feel bad, as Alison agrees to this. At Casey's house, it is awkward as Hunter blurts out to Tom, Margo, Bob, Kim and Lisa who he is and how it came about. This is interrupted when Casey comes home and doesn't react well at first to the surprise party. Margo stops him from leaving and wonders why he is so mad. He doesn't know, but he wanted to tell her the news himself to see their faces. Margo admits how proud they are of him. Casey comes back in happier and mingles with everyone but makes a beeline for Alison. Adam plays distracter when he takes Hunter aside so Alison and Casey can talk. Casey and Alison make up, as Hunter is annoyed at this and wants Alison to leave with him before she gets in deep with Casey again, but Alison decides to stay with Casey and Hunter leaves in a huff. Casey and Alison enjoy their time together again, but Alison is a little concerned when Bob seems to think they are at the hospital when he addresses Alison. No one else hears this and Bob blows it off to Kim after Alison mentions it to her; he claims he was making a joke. Alison seems unsure. Later, Bob calls Kim by Lisa's name. She wonders if he is making a joke again, as Bob thinks she heard him wrong. Larry tries to talk with Emily about getting her onto a list for donor eggs, as Susan overhears and chides him about this. Emily promises that she can handle him, and puts Larry in his place about what kind of liar and fake he is. He was just trying to help her with her dream. She no longer wants a child, but Larry doesn't believe her and offers to be there if she calls him one day. Susan wonders if she really has given up on having a baby, as Emily tells her that she has Hunter. It isn't the same, Susan reminds her. Emily wonders how to get through to him, as Susan suggests giving him space because she has always resented the fact that she never did. Later, Emily offers kind words to Hunter to try to help ease his grief. She tells him that if he doesn't want a family then they can just be friends, but a still bitter Hunter wants them to only be about business. Alison and Casey reconnect passionately on the hospital roof.",
