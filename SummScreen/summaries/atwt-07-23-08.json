Paul was not sure if Meg could go home yet, but promised to do anything else she asked. Meg commented that she wished her mother had been at their wedding. Paul thought for a moment and then said he had a meeting to go to and left Meg to rest, but he promised to return with beautiful flowers and Meg's mother. \n\n\nPaul went to the farm and tried to induce Emma into doing him a favor, but first he had to convince her that he was the right man for Meg. Emma refused to believe that Paul and Meg belonged together and recounted the many ways that Paul's behavior had caused Meg to suffer. Paul explained that Meg thought he was a good man and hoped Emma could accept Meg's love for him as proof that he had changed. Emma asked Paul to promise that he would never hurt Meg again, but he would only pledge to never intentionally harm Meg and that he would always love her. This was enough to get Emma to go with Paul. \n\n\nPaul returned to Meg's room and she asked if he had managed to get her released. Paul said he was not able to get that done, but he had another surprise. Emma came into the room and Paul asked if Meg was willing to marry him again in front of both of their mothers. Meg happily said she would. Barbara arrived with a wedding gown and necklace she had just received from Will and Gwen for Meg to wear. Paul explained the doctors were worried about Meg's health and would only let her stand-up for a few moments for the ceremony. \n\n\nPaul and Meg's wedding began in her hospital room with her childhood pastor performing the service. Everything began beautifully, with the bride and groom declaring their love for one another, but things turned bad when Meg looked up and saw the recently deceased Sofie standing in the hall. She quickly fainted into Paul's arms and he helped her into bed. Susan came in to check Meg and told Paul to remove the necklace that Barbara had given her so she could examine Meg. Meg woke up once the necklace was off and Susan said her heart rate had been elevated, but had quickly returned to normal. Paul wanted to postpone the ceremony, but Meg insisted they go forward. They went ahead and exchanged vows without incident, but the second time Meg stayed in bed and did not put the necklace back on. Once they were married and alone in Meg's room, Paul kissed his new bride and sat his hand ominously by the necklace she had worn when she passed out. \n\n\nAlison sat fidgeting at Java and seemed completely agitated and annoyed. Aaron arrived and offered to buy her a coffee, but all she could do was grumble about her latest bad grade. When Aaron told her everything would be all right, Alison leapt from the table and told Aaron to stop patronizing her. Alison got coffee for Aaron and then returned to the table to argue with him about his constant support. Aaron was confused by Alison's hostile attitude and asked her if she had started taking drugs again. Alison was angry with Aaron's allegation and told Aaron to go away. Aaron had heard enough and left. \n\n\nAfter having breakfast with his mom, Chris had come into Java and noticed Aaron and Alison arguing. He listened to the end of their fight and watched Aaron storm off. Chris detected immediately that something was physically wrong with Alison. He saw that Alison was shaking and restless and insisted she let him check her out to see what was wrong. Alison would not take Chris's advice and accused him of using the \"physical\" to try to seduce her again. Chris warned Alison that she appeared sick and she should ask her mother to look at her. Alison refused and Chris walked out. Once Alison was alone, she could not stop fiddling with her new bracelet and it finally broke off. \n\n\nAlison showed up at the Lakeview and apologized to Aaron for her strange behavior. She seemed to be back to her old self and showed Aaron the broken bracelet. She explained she had no idea why she was acting so strangely. Aaron understood and said he thought the stress of nursing school was getting to Alison and he offered to buy her lunch. Alison happily accepted and, after finishing lunch, gave Aaron a quick kiss and left to study. \n\n\nChris was not convinced Alison was all right and went to talk to Susan at the hospital about Alison's strange symptoms. Susan did not want to hear what Chris had to say, but Chris refused to give up and asked Susan to give Alison a physical. Susan told him to stay away from her daughter and went on her way. \n\n\nChris returned to his hotel and was handed a package by the front desk clerk. Inside, there was an unsigned note that Chris assumed was from Bob and Kim, and a watch. He left Kim a message thanking her for understanding and then stared at his new watch. \n\n\nOver breakfast at the Hugheses' home, Daniel asked Tom why he was taking Emily to court and wanted to know what his mother had done to make Tom want to change visitation. Tom did not want to explain to Daniel that Emily had been a prostitute and simply told his son that he did not want him around Emily. Casey walked in and Daniel asked him why Tom was going forward with the court case. Casey changed the subject and said a family friend had invited Daniel over for the morning. Daniel was excited to go and Tom gave his permission. \n\n\nOnce Daniel was gone, Tom criticized Casey for trying to get Daniel alone so he could poison his mind against him and Margo. Casey said he would never do that, but implored Tom not to trash Emily in court. Tom explained he was looking out for Daniel's best interests and had no intention of him learning about Emily's sordid past. Casey argued there was no way to avoid Daniel finding out once the court records were made public. Tom said he would have the case against Emily sealed, but Casey was not done pleading Emily's case. Tom was not impressed with Casey's argument and insisted that the only reason Casey was defending Emily was because he was sleeping with her. Casey believed that Tom was punishing Emily for dating Casey, but Tom said he was only protecting Daniel. Casey was frustrated that Tom would not back down, and left. \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo was clearing her schedule so she could attend court with Tom. Emily barged in and confronted Margo about the custody hearing. Emily begged Margo to think about Daniel and what would happen if he found out his mother had been a call girl. Margo told Emily she could make sure Daniel never knew, by turning custody of Daniel over to Tom. Emily insisted that if she did that, Daniel would hate her. Margo said she knew and did not care if Daniel hated Emily. Emily pleaded with Margo again, but Margo simply showed her the door and said she would see her in court. \n\n\nEmily arrived at the courthouse and was surprised when she found Casey there. Casey said he had tried to get Tom to change his mind, but was unable to persuade his father to let the custody agreement stay the same. Emily wanted Casey to stay with her, but Casey said he thought it would just make things worse if his parents saw him with Emily. Emily agreed and watched sadly as Casey walked out. \n\n\nWhen the court hearing began, Casey snuck in and, to the frustration of his parents, sat on Emily's side of the room. He watched as Tom told the court that new information had come to his attention that made him believe Emily was no longer a good mother to Daniel. When it was time for Tom to tell the judge about Emily's prostitution, he took a deep breath and told the court he decided to withdraw his suit. Emily cried with relief as the judge dismissed the case. \n\n\nAfter Emily walked out, Margo demanded to know why Tom let her off the hook. Tom explained his conversation with Casey and said he did not want to battle with his sons anymore. He was certain that Emily would self-destruct on her own, and Casey and Daniel would realize that she was a bad person without any help from Tom and Margo. Margo was not convinced and said she would find a way to stop Emily. \n\n\nAfter the hearing, Casey and Emily went to the Lakeview to celebrate. In the lobby, Emily began kissing Casey, but he quickly pulled away, citing Emily's rule against kissing in public. Emily declared she did not care anymore who saw them together and that she loved Casey. Just then, Alison walked out of the bar and was shocked to see Emily and Casey in a passionate embrace. She interrupted the two, but Emily was not embarrassed and declared her love for Casey to her sister. Alison just shook her head in disappointment and offered the couple a less than heartfelt \"congratulations.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Meg is anxious to leave the hospital, but Paul is going to keep her preoccupied by something else, which is guaranteed to put a smile on her face. Allison tears into Aaron for no apparent reason. Aaron is worried about how Allison is acting \u0096 erratic and moody \u0096 it is like she is on drugs. Kim worries about Chris taking so much time off and offers him a job at the station, but he explains that he is just taking his time before he jumps into something again. He doesn't want her to worry. Daniel wants his dad to tell him why he doesn't want him to be with his mom anymore. Emily pleads with Margo not to take her to court. Margo tells her to give up custody and they won't put her profession front and center, but Emily won't give up Daniel. Casey pleads Emily's case, but Tom won't budge. Paul goes to sees Emma about a favor. They butt heads at first, but then they agree to a truce and she agrees to help him. Allison tells Aaron to leave her alone because he is not her friend, as Chris watches. Chris tries to help Allison too, but she turns her anger on him. He suggests she have a physical since she is exhibiting strange symptoms, but she won't listen to him either. Allison fidgets so much that she breaks her bracelet. Paul asks Meg to marry him again, and then brings in Emma and Barbara. They are all prepared for a wedding, which thrills Meg. Meg receives gifts of something old (a veil of Emma's), new (the wedding dress she liked from Fashions), borrowed (family bible) and blue (a gift Barbara thinks came from Gwen). Paul even convinces Meg's minister to preside over the ceremony. Emma jokes with Paul about him making it hard for her to dislike him. Tom and Emily's hearing starts and Tom is prepared to show his evidence, but then he sees Casey come in and sit on Emily's side. He changes his mind, much to the courts chagrin and the case is dismissed. Margo is furious, as Tom explains why he did what he did. Allison apologizes to Aaron and explains that she didn't know what happened to her. Chris tells Susan that he is worried about Allison and her behavior and health, as Susan tells him to leave them all alone. Meg and Paul's wedding starts, but Meg faints as she is saying her vows to Paul. Meg finally awakens and admits to feeling off and even hallucinating, but no one suspects it might be from the necklace she was wearing. Emily tells Casey he was the main reason she still has her son. She kisses him passionately in public and tells him that she no longer cares who knows about them; she loves him. Allison sees them and Emily tells her the same thing she just told Casey. Allison flatly tells them congratulations before she walks off. Meg and Paul are married. Chris receives an unsigned note and gift; it is a watch and based on what the note said, he assumes it is from his mother. He leaves her a message thanking her for her support, but not mentioning the actual gift. Paul and Meg revel in their newfound wedded bliss again, as the necklace sits nearby on Meg's bedside table.",
