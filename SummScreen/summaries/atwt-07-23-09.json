They decided it was very similar to the time when a raccoon had run amok in the house and then died.  After nosing around a bit, however, the kids decided it was more likely that the odors were generated by Aunt Rosanna's cooking.  The two almost made a fast getaway, but Rosanna stopped them and invited them to sit and eat lunch.  She served them a vegan plate of whole-wheat pasta with Swiss chard.  Parker declared that it tasted like green sandpaper, and Sage concurred, so Rosanna gave in and offered to take them out.\n\n\nLily called Luke at the foundation and said that Lucinda had called Dean Brewster at the university, and he had agreed to meet with them all to discuss Luke's reinstatement.  The dean had not promised anything, but he had agreed to the meeting.  Lily asked Luke to go home immediately because it was important that he, himself, talk to the dean.  Luke agreed very reluctantly.  Holden prepared for the meeting by dressing in his best suit, and he and Lily agreed that the dean held the key to Luke's future.\n\n\nLuke confided in Damian that he was uncomfortable that his grandmother was pressuring the university to readmit him.  He said that everyone in his family was telling him to go back to school, but Luke did not answer when Damian asked him what he wanted to do.  Luke was afraid that he would just be going through the motions of class and homework, and therefore it would become a chore.  Damian suggested that Luke get a job and take on some new challenges, but Luke complained that no one would hire him in a bad economy.\n\n\nDamian said that he desperately needed someone he could trust in his shipping business, but he knew that Lily and Holden would blame him for \"luring\" Luke away from college.  He asked if his son would like to join him in Grimaldi Shipping.  Since Luke knew nothing about the shipping industry, he asked about training, and Damian stressed that he would provide that.  He also mentioned that the job involved world travel, and he said that Noah could accompany Luke on his journeys.  In fact, that might be exciting for someone in the film business. Damian confessed that his dream was that Luke would like the shipping business well enough to take it over eventually.\n\n\nCraig sat with Johnny in the Lakeview lounge, and he talked on his phone.  Craig agreed to  a meeting with a Mr. Lazarus later that day.  Johnny spotted Parker and Sage, who had walked in with Rosanna, looking for real food, and he asked to sit with them.  Rosanna invited the boy to sit with them, and she overheard Craig tell his business contact that Carly Tenney would be finishing another project and would not be joining them in Chicago.  When Craig hung up, Rosanna talked with him, and he suddenly got the idea that Rosanna should accompany him to the meeting as Carly's stand-in.\n\n\nRosanna wanted no part of any business with Craig, so she refused.  Craig stressed that a closed deal would mean income for Carly when she returned from rehab.  Rosanna was determined to stay away from Craig, but she reconsidered after she thought about Carly's possibly having her own life when she returned.  Rosanna agreed to go with Craig. She told the kids that they were going to Chicago for lunch, and Parker moaned that he had been \"so close to real food.\"\n\n\nCraig's meeting was at a Chicago French restaurant, and Rosanna got the kids set up at a private table.  The waitress asked where the kids were from, and she reacted strangely when she learned they were from Oakdale.  Craig introduced Rosanna to Ed Lazarus, and they took a nearby table. The children could not read the French menu, but the waitress was sympathetic and asked them to leave the ordering to her.\n\n\nCraig began his pitch to Lazarus, but Rosanna suddenly asked to see the financials for the vitamin water business.  Craig was stunned by her request, so she asked to speak privately with him.  They stood off to the side and argued.  Rosanna accused Craig of bringing her to the meeting only to make \"goo-goo eyes\" at the client, and to perhaps show a bit of cleavage.  She was incensed that he was not treating her like the equal partner that Carly was.  For his part, Craig was furious that Rosanna had attempted to take over the meeting, and he asked if it would kill her to show a little cleavage.\n\n\nLucinda and Dean Brewster arrived together at Lily and Holden's.  Lucinda immediately made her pitch for Luke's readmission to Oakdale University.  Brewster reminded them all that Luke had violated the school's code of ethics, but Lily remarked how Luke had thrown himself into the foundation work, and had expressed remorse for his actions during the school election.  Lucinda called Luke and expressed her irritation that he was not home yet.  She said he needed to converse with the dean himself, and Luke promised to be there as soon as possible.  Before he left, Damian urged his son to consider his options carefully.\n\n\nLuke arrived home, and Lily told him that the dean wanted to hear his thoughts about returning to school.  Luke stunned them all by revealing that he had no such thoughts because he had other plans for his life.  He said that he had been offered a really good job that he thought he should take.  Lily asked what job, and Luke said it was with Grimaldi Shipping, working for Damian.  Dean Brewster made a hasty exit, and Lucinda blistered Luke by thanking him for humiliating all of them in front of the dean.  Luke reminded them that school was their idea, not his, but Holden blew up and shouted that working for a con artist was not such a great career move, either.\n\n\nLuke quoted all the opportunities that Damian had mentioned, including travel for him and Noah.  He also mentioned all the education that seeing the world could provide.  Luke said that he respected Holden more than anyone else in the world, but that he had to do what he thought was right for him.  Lucinda claimed that Damian had never drawn a legitimate breath in the world of business his entire life, but Luke said that was not true.  Holden threatened to make sure that Damian stayed away until he withdrew his offer to Luke, but Luke cried out that it was not Holden's call.\n\n\nLily offered to intercede with Damian, and she left before anyone could stop her.  Lucinda and Holden were sick that Luke had such a cavalier attitude about the opportunity to have a good education.  Lily saw Damian getting his mail at the front desk of the Lakeview, and she asked him \"what the hell\" he thought he was doing.  Lily was furious that Damian had offered an alternative to Luke's higher education.  Lily asked if he was trying to undermine Holden, but Damian replied that he only wanted \"what was best for Luciano.\"  Lily next accused Damian of staking a claim on their son, and she mentioned his lunatic, drug-running relatives who were all involved in the Grimaldi Enterprises.  Damian said that Luke was a grown man, and it was time to let him go.\n\n\nThe waitress in Chicago served a special dish that she had made herself, and the kids loved it.  She told them that she had gone to culinary school, but she had not had a shot at doing anything but waiting tables yet.  She said her name was Teri, and she mentioned a special dessert that they usually served only at night, and she promised to get them some if she could sneak them by the manager.\n\n\nRosanna and Craig returned to their table, and Rosanna began a brand new pitch of her own to the client.  Suddenly Mr. Lazarus recognized her as Rosanna Cabot of Cabot Motors, and he declared that whatever she wanted to do, they would do.  Craig looked at Rosanna in amazement, as the client told Rosanna that he was glad she was on board with her business reputation.   When Lazarus left, Craig complimented Rosanna for scoring big points.  Rosanna told him that he could forget about flattering her in hopes of getting more out of her.\n\n\nTeri served the children petits fours and was severely scolded by the manager.  Then the manager slipped on Johnny's toy car and took a nasty tumble.  Rosanna approached the children's table and was amazed that Teri had served them artichoke souffl\u00e9s, which they had loved.  Sage and Teri hit it off particularly well, and Sage asked for Teri's email address so that she could let her know when they might be returning to Chicago.\n\n\nLily took Damian to her house, and he and Holden began sparring.  Lily claimed that Luke was mature enough to make decisions for himself, and that enraged Holden.  Lily went on that by bringing the dean to their house, they were being manipulators.  She apologized to Holden, but said that they had to trust their boy to make the right decision.  Holden suggested that Damian leave, and Lucinda walked him out.  She warned Damian that he could not win the game he was playing with Lily and Holden; they would not allow him to steal Luke.\n\n\nLucinda left, and Luke appeared outside.  He told Damian that he was very excited about working with him, and Damian said that he felt the same way.  Luke told Damian that he had made his decision.\n\n\nCraig took Rosanna and the kids home, and Rosanna asked for all sorts of documents and privileges so that she could oversee Carly's interest in the business. Craig called her \"one tough cookie,\" and asked if she wanted to get a cup of coffee.  Rosanna reminded him that they were not allies, or partners, or even friends, and she said goodnight.\n\n\nSage got the laptop and began emailing Teri, the waitress in Chicago.  Parker kidded her about that, but Sage finished her message and sent it.  Teri read the message on her phone at work, and she was pleased to hear from Sage.  Her manager caught her with her phone out, and he told her to pack her things, and he fired her on the spot.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Craig persuades Rosanna to take Carly's place at a business meeting for the vitamin water so Craig, Rosanna, Johnny, Parker, and Sage go with them and have lunch at the same restaurant that Rosanna and Craig have their meeting. Sage makes friends with their waitress whose name is Terri and asks for her e-mail to let her know the next time they are going to go to the restaurant. Craig and Rosanna argue because she wants to be more involved in the business while Carly is away so she can protect Carly's interests. Rosanna talks to Mr. Lazarus and once he discovers that she is Rosanna Cabot decides to expand the distribution of the vitamin water and not concentrate so much effort on the vodka. Sage e-mails Terri once everyone arrives home to thank her and tell her it was nice to meet her and Terri gets fired for reading the e-mail during working hours. Rosanna makes it clear to Craig that they are not business partners she is just looking after Carly's project until Carly returns home.
