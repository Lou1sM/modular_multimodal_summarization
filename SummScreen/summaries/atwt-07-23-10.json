Gabriel slammed the door in his face, but Craig stormed into the house and said he wanted to make a good life for his sons. Gabriel asked if he'd forgotten about his daughter.\n\n\nCraig claimed that his relationship with Lucy was complicated. Gabriel revealed that he knew that Lucy had absconded with Johnny. Craig said that had happened years earlier. Gabriel quipped that Craig was proof that people didn't change. Craig claimed that family was all that one really had. Gabriel considered that a frightening thought. Craig implored Gabriel to drop the bitterness, but Gabriel hoped that the door didn't hit Craig on his way out.\n\n\n       Craig went to his hotel room, and Blackthorn dropped by to say that he'd received Craig's request for more cash. He noted that Craig constantly seemed to need more money. Craig claimed that he was good for it, and Blackthorn said he'd better be. Blackthorn agreed to transfer more funds, but he expected the cash to start flowing back in his direction soon. After leaving, Blackthorn called Lucinda to say that he'd put the screws to Craig, as she'd requested.\n\n\n       While at the farm, Liberty and Parker made curtains for the cabin. She seemed annoyed to hear Parker compliment Faith's attire for the bridal shower. When Faith left, Liberty remarked that she'd been at his commercial shoot, but she hadn't approached him because he'd been flirting with Faith on the tennis court. Parker smiled, noting Liberty's jealousy. Liberty rejected the notion, but wondered if Parker and Faith were dating. Parker replied that they were friends. Just then, Gabriel called to ask for Liberty's help, and Liberty readily took off.\n\n\nAt Java, Gabriel told Liberty that he really wanted to meet Lucy, but he was nervous about it. He asked if Liberty would accompany him. She told him to name the time and place.\n\n\n       At Al's diner, Janet was rushing to take food to Molly's bridal shower when Blackthorn arrived to ask her on a date. Janet didn't refuse, but she made plenty of excuses as to why she couldn't go. Blackthorn persisted, saying that it didn't have to be that very day. Janet said he was \"too much,\" and she bustled off without a definitive answer.\n\n\nWhile dropping the food off in Carly's kitchen, Janet said she was sorry that Carly hadn't known about her move to the cabin. Carly asked how Dusty felt about it, and Janet conveyed that Dusty had been overprotective of her because of her relationship with Blackthorn. \"Whatever Dusty's doing, embrace it. You're so much luckier than you know,\" Carly responded.\n\n\n       At the Lakeview, Dusty grinned a little when he opened his door to find Lucy Montgomery on the other side. Lucy claimed that she'd been overdue for a visit, and she was anxious to meet her brother, Gabriel. Dusty explained that things had changed since her last visit, but Lucy stated that she already knew he was seeing someone. She said that she'd known for a while that it was over between her and Dusty.\n\n\nLucy hoped that Craig was still amicable about Dusty's visitation with Johnny, but Dusty revealed that Craig had used Johnny as a bargaining chip in the Worldwide deal. Johnny drew Lucy a picture of a pizza, and the three decided to go out to eat.\n\n\n       At Al's Diner, Lucy and Dusty discussed Janet. He revealed his intention to marry Janet and have a family, which would include Jack and Janet's baby. He stated that Janet needed his help, and Lucy recalled his proclivity to rescue women. Dusty explained that he had to protect Janet from the unsavory Blackthorn, and Lucy wondered if Dusty were in love with Janet.\n\n\n       Just then, Janet entered and seemed startled to see Lucy with Dusty. He introduced the ladies, and they made polite conversation. As Johnny, Dusty, and Lucy left, a disillusioned Janet stared at them through the window.\n\n\nLater, Janet sighed to see Blackthorn back at the diner. He invited her to a Cubs game and promised that their seats were near the restrooms. When Janet hesitated, he told her to call it \"an offer you can't refuse.\"\n\n\n       Outside Carly's house, Holden was concerned about Lily's arrival at the bridal shower. He indicated that \"all this joy\" might be too much for her, but she pretended that everything was fine, because she and Holden had both moved on. Though he still worried about Lily, he left to pick up Faith. Lily entered the house and said, \"Let's get this party started!\" Molly and Carly seemed to be just as uneasy about the gregarious Lily as Holden had been earlier.\n\n\n       Holden arrived at the farm to pick Faith up for Molly's shower. On the porch, he wondered if Faith could handle attending the party. Faith figured that Molly was cool, so it wouldn't be hard to \"ooh and ahh\" for a few hours over her bridal gifts.\n\n\n       When Faith arrived at the party, she watched Lily view an old picture of Molly and Holden. Lily chuckled through her sadness when Molly remarked that her shirt from the photo still hung in her closet. Everyone discussed the wedding, and Molly said that there were 75 people on her guest list. \"The more the Molly-er!\" Lily exclaimed and drank champagne. Faith quieted her boisterous mother. Molly remarked that she'd been leery about having a big wedding, but Holden had insisted that nothing was too good for them. Lily sadly shook her head.\n\n\n       Carly read a letter entitled, \"A Groom to his Bride on Their Wedding Day,\" which she'd composed with words that the guests had randomly written down for her. Lily grew uncomfortable when Carly instructed Molly to open her gifts. Lily slipped outside, and Faith followed her. Lily stated that she'd forgotten her gift in the car, and Faith returned inside.\n\n\n       After a while, Carly asked where Lily had gone, and Faith said Lily had gone to her car. \"How far away did she park?\" Carly wondered. On the porch, Lily heard Molly inside cooing about the lingerie gifts for the honeymoon. Lily placed her gift on the stoop and left.\n\n\n       Faith found the present on the porch and told everyone that Lily had left. Carly and Molly tried to minimize Lily's departure to keep Faith from getting upset. After Faith went outside to call her father, Molly and Carly listened to Lily's gift to make sure it wasn't ticking.\n\n\nWhen Faith called Holden about Lily's disappearance, he figured that Lily just needed time to herself. He offered to find Lily and call Faith later. On his porch, Holden encountered a sobbing Lily. She said that she just couldn't do it. She wanted to be happy for his sake, but she couldn't bear to watch him build a life with someone else. She decided that she needed to get away from Oakdale, because she couldn't be there while he married another woman.\n\n\nHolden said that he understood, and she replied that his sympathy made it worse. She expressed her love for him, and he wondered where she'd go. \"I don't know. But don't follow me, if you care for me at all,\" she whimpered and left.\n\n\n       After the shower, Molly admired her new lingerie. Carly worried about Lily, and Molly asked why her party had to be about Lily. Holden entered to say that an upset Lily had visited him after the shower. Carly went to the kitchen, and Holden told Molly that Lily wouldn't be at the wedding. Molly thought that it was for the best, because they should have a joyous wedding day. He wished that Lily could attend, but he guessed it was for the best, just as Molly had said.\n\n\n       A distraught Lily wound up on Craig's doorstep. She sobbed that she needed to get away, and she asked him to accompany her out of Oakdale. Carly called Craig and asked if Lily were there. With Lily's permission, he confirmed it and added that Lily was doing okay. After the call, Craig comforted Lily, who wanted out of that \"wretched town.\" Putting his arm around her, Craig promised to do everything he could to make things better for her.\n\n\n       Faith called Parker to express her worry about Lily. Faith sobbed that it had finally ended between her parents. Parker said he understood how it felt to witness volatile relationships between parents. She feared that Lily would hurt herself, but he doubted that it would get that bad. Faith clicked off the line, and Parker rushed out of the house.\n\n\n       Faith wandered around, looking for her mother. She collapsed on the ground near the woods and cried. Parker found Faith and tried to comfort her. She asked why people hurt each other instead of working things out. She realized that her parents would never reunite. She regretted shoving her relationship with Molly in Lily's face. Faith sobbed when she thought of how sullen Lily had been at the shower.\n\n\n       Faith wondered how Parker had found her, and he said he'd remembered that they used to go to that spot when they'd had problems. She said that they'd only trusted each other back then. After crying more, she wondered what was wrong with her. Parker assured her that crying was good, and he'd be worried if she didn't cry. Parker spontaneously kissed Faith. She kissed him back and relaxed on the ground. Faith pulled Parker on top of her, and as they kissed, he unzipped the front of her dress. \n\n\n\n\n",
