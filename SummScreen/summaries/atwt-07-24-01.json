Also that they planned to kill her.  Carly couldn't believe that Barbara would accuse them of trying to kill her.  Craig brought up all the things that they have done to look suspicious.  Carly was upset that the accusations of her and Craig being in cahoots would cause trouble between her and Jack.  She told Craig she wasn't going to go down with him.  He told her that he would protect her.  She told him she was no longer going to speak to him and she didn't want anymore surprise visits.  She told him he was on his own and got out of the car.  \n\n\nAl's Diner:\n\nJack and Margo talked about Carly and Craig both having a motive to do harm to Barbara.  Jack said he didn't believe that Carly had anything to do with Barbara's attempted murder.  Margo said she didn't think that Craig is guilty either.  Paul walked in as Margo said they have to rely on facts that happened the night of the explosion.  Paul said they finally agree on something.  Paul asked why Craig was out of jail.  Margo told him the judge decided to reset the bail.  \n\n\nBarbara's Hospital Room:\n\nAs Barbara slept, the person dressed in black, with a hood to cover the head and face, walked towards her with a pillow.  He put the pillow over her face and tried to smoother her.  Barbara struggled with the killer when a tray from the table fell to the floor.  The noise made the killer stop and the person jumped out the window.  John and a nurse saw the guard on the floor in the hall and while she ran to help the guard, John went into Barbara's room.  Barbara told him someone tried to kill her.  \n\n\nAl's Diner:\n\nMargo got a phone call about what happened to Barbara.  She told the person to send 3 units to the hospital and she would be there ASAP.  Paul asked if his mother was OK.  Margo told him there was an attempt on her life, but that she was all right now.  Paul told her she didn't need to send out a search team, that they all knew already who it was.\n\n\nLater Carly walked in looking for Jack.  A waitress told her that he was there earlier and got a message to go to see Barbara at the hospital.\n\n\nBarbara's Hospital Room:\n\nPaul, Margo and Jack walked into Barbara's room.  Barbara asked if they caught the person.  Margo told them they hadn't yet, but they have police in and out of the hospital looking.  Paul was very upset that they didn't arrest Craig again.  Margo asked if Barbara could identify who put the pillow on her face.  Paul told Margo that Craig was in Barbara's room earlier and when he couldn't change her mind about accusing him of the explosion at the boathouse, he came back to kill her.  Margo said that they need Barbara's statement before they could arrest anyone.  Barbara said it was dark and she couldn't see who it was.  Paul insisted that it was Craig.  Margo told Jack she was going to Craig's alone.  \n\n\nPaul watched Barbara while she slept and promised her that Craig and Carly wouldn't hurt her again.  \n\n\nCraig's Hotel Suite:\n\nCraig walked in his suite and fixed himself a drink.  Sierra walked up behind him and he was surprised to see her there.  She asked him if his passport was current.  She said she would fly him anywhere in the world until the police find the real criminal.  Craig was surprised that she made him the offer.  Sierra and Craig made love.  Sierra tried again to talk Craig into leaving the country.  He told her there would never be another woman in his life like her.  She wanted to start their lives over again.  Craig and Sierra talked about the kids and happier times.  He said it was tempting to leave the country, but that he couldn't take her up on her offer.  He said he's not guilty and if would leave, it would look like he was.  He said he couldn't do that to Lucy and Bryant.  \n\n\nOpera House:\n\nLily, Katie and Simon were sitting in the opera box.  Simon said he was going to leave to see if he could find where Luke and Holden were being held.  Lily wanted to go with him, but Simon convinced her that her face was too familiar.  Lily and Katie used binoculars to see if they could spot something unusual.  Katie noticed a large crest in the box on the other side of the opera house.  She described it to Lily.  Lily told her that was the Grimaldi family crest.  Then Katie saw that someone with a pinkie ring with the same Grimaldi crest on it was in that box.  Lily said she was going to find out if it was Damian.  Katie tried to make her wait until Simon got back, but she said she couldn't wait.  Katie looked through the binoculars again and saw the person looking back at her with a smile and he lifted his glass of wine as a sign of acknowledgment.  Simon returned to the box seats while Katie was still looking through the binoculars.  Simon wanted to know where Lily was.  Katie told him about the Grimaldi Crest and the guy wearing the pinkie ring with the Crest on it.  She told him that Lily went to the Grimaldi box to see who it was.  Simon took the binoculars and saw Lily in the box, looking for clues.  Then he saw a man behind Lily.  Simon tried to warn her and saw Lily and the man struggling.  Simon told Katie to stay there while he went to help Lily.  As they continued to struggle, Lily asked where Damian was.  The man said that Damian, Holden and Luke were dead.  When Simon got to the Grimaldi box, the man jumped over the balcony.  Lily told Simon that the man told her that Luke and Holden were dead.  Simon asked if that were true, then why are all the doors to the basement locked and guards are watching all the entries to the basement?  \n\n\nLuke and Holden went over their escape plans, but the guard came in the room before they could escape.  The guard said he was there to take Luke.  Holden told him that he and Luke weren't splitting up.  Luke told the guard he wasn't going to go with him.  When the guard reached for Luke, Holden hit him.  They struggled and Holden hit him over the head.  He told Luke that they couldn't wait, they had to leave right away.  Holden broke through the wall and he and Luke crawled through.  Before Holden left, he took the guard's gun.  Just as they left, another guard walked in the room and wanted to know what happened.  They saw where Luke and Holden went through the wall.\n\n\nLily and Simon went to the room where Holden and Luke had been held.  Lily saw the wall opening and knew that they had escaped.  She found Luke's jacket and wanted to crawl through the opening.  She told Simon to go back outside and she'd go through the way the Holden and Luke did and she'd meet him outside.  Katie showed up and told Simon that the guy with the pinkie ring left.  Before they could leave the room, the pinkie ring guy and two other thugs showed up with guns.  He said Simon and Katie weren't going anywhere until they told them what they wanted to know.  He said he would kill Katie if they didn't talk, then asked where the Snyder family was.  \n\n\nHolden and Luke got to a hiding place.  They decided to rest and wait to see if Lily would find them there.\n\n\n",
