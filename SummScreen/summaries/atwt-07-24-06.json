Damian presses Luke to move to Malta with him, but Luke worries what will happen if his family needs him in the meantime; Damian plays Luke about how his family would want him happy. When Lucinda calls Luke, Damian answers and won't let her talk to him. Simon wants Carly to partner with him, but Carly tells him to take a flying leap. Simon continues to work her when he tells her he has a job for her to redecorate an apartment building he just bought. Casey finds a murdered Lia in the shower (think Psycho scene), and immediately calls his mom for help. Margo questions him and worries to Tom that their son is the only suspect they have. Maddie wonders how something happened when Eve wonders where she has been all night? Maddie claims to have been out walking around since she couldn't sleep, but Eve is concerned she ran right to the shower when she came home. Margo comes looking for Maddie to question her about Lia's death. Carly relents and takes Simon up on his job offer so she can prove to Jack she can be independent from him. Lucinda and Damian have it out, which Luke overhears and then comes to Damian's defense. Carly tells Katie and Mike she accepted Simon's offer for a job. Maddie recalls seeing Casey and Lia together in the shower area of the country club the night Lia was murdered, but when she is pressed about where she was last night, she tells Margo she was home all night.",
