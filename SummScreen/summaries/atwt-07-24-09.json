Luke informed Noah of his plans to work for his father at Grimaldi Shipping rather than return to college. Noah was surprised, but Luke said that he'd been thinking it over for a couple of days. Noah was not pleased that Luke had been considering such a major change without even discussing it with him.\n\n\nLuke explained that there hadn't been any time to talk to Noah about Damian's offer, because Noah had been so busy with his film project. Noah was still upset and told Luke that he had thought they would graduate together and then move to New York. Luke said that he could still move to New York when Noah was ready to go, because Grimaldi Shipping had offices there. Noah told Luke that couples weren't supposed to make life-altering decisions without consulting one another first.\n\n\nLuke said that he hadn't meant to exclude Noah. Luke said that he wanted Noah to support him, but Noah said that he wasn't the kind of boyfriend \"who thinks everything you do is adorable even if you're making a huge mistake.\" Luke asked if Noah thought he was making a mistake, and Noah said he wasn't saying that.\n\n\nMason approached the pair and greeted them. Noah asked Mason how late he had worked on the film they'd been editing the night before, and Mason said he had only finished about 15 minutes earlier. Mason invited Noah to accompany him to a screening of the film, but Noah said, \"Not now.\" Luke told Noah to go with Mason, saying, \"This isn't worth having everybody get angry with me. Especially you.\"\n\n\nLuke left, and Mason asked Noah if everything was okay. Noah replied, \"I think I just convinced my boyfriend to quit his job.\" Noah explained the situation. Mason asked if Noah knew why Luke had changed his mind about college, and Noah suggested that since he had a career planned for himself, perhaps Luke hadn't wanted to be \"left behind,\" the way Mason's ex-boyfriend, George, had felt about Mason's career. Mason cautioned Noah against using his relationship with George as an example for Noah's relationship with Luke, because every relationship was different, and he told Noah that he and George had had more problems than just Mason's work. Noah told Mason that he and Luke hadn't had any problems lately, and Mason replied that it sounded like the relationship was worth fighting for.\n\n\nAt the offices of The Intruder, Emily tried to entice Hunter into going out for breakfast, but Hunter wasn't in the mood. He showed Emily a box and told her it had been delivered to him that morning and that it contained his mother's ashes. Emily was creeped out by the ashes and told Hunter to find someplace to put them other than the office. Emily left, and Hunter went back to work.\n\n\nLucinda walked into Emily's office and found Hunter working alone. Hunter told Lucinda that Emily was out covering a story. Lucinda asked what Hunter was doing, and he told her he was working on a new section of the Web site where users could post links to their own videos, to create an online community, which was what advertisers liked to see. Hunter thought that the Web site could triple its traffic as a result. Lucinda was impressed and remarked, \"You could run this place by yourself.\" Hunter replied, \"Sure, no problem,\" and asked if there was anything else he could do for Lucinda. Lucinda asked Hunter to tell Emily that Lucinda wanted to see her, and then Lucinda left.\n\n\nEmily went to the diner, where she saw Paul eating breakfast alone and reading a newspaper. She sat by him and said, \"Didn't anyone tell you print is dead?\" Paul looked at her and asked, \"Do I know you?\" Emily chattered on, trying to get Paul to give her a good quote to use in her story for the newspaper. Emily soon realized that Paul's brain damage from the bombing was more severe than she'd realized, and she asked Paul what he knew about himself. He told her that all he knew was what Barbara and Meg had told him, and that it was \"horrifying.\" Emily replied, \"It's all in the perspective.\"\n\n\nPaul asked Emily if he had done terrible things to her in the past, and she told him yes, but she said that she had once shot him in the back, although he had deserved it. Paul apologized, but Emily said he couldn't be sorry for something he didn't remember doing. Paul was grateful that she understood that, because no one else he'd spoken to seemed to realize that. Emily pointed out that the amnesia meant that Paul didn't have to be remorseful for anything he'd done to Dusty, but Paul said that he wanted to take responsibility for whatever he'd done. He asked if Emily had any insight into what had happened.\n\n\nEmily explained to Paul that he had set up both Dusty and Damian to encourage a war between the two men, so that Meg would want nothing to do with either of them, leaving Paul a chance to win Meg back. Paul said he could understand why Dusty had wanted to get back at him. He wondered why Emily didn't hate him, too. Emily told him that she wasn't exactly a saint herself, and that it was more fun to knock the saints off their pedestals. As Paul smiled, Emily told him, \"You're in there somewhere, Paul Ryan; I can see it.\" Paul wondered whether that was a good thing, but Emily said that Paul had a lot of \"enjoyable qualities,\" too.\n\n\nHunter walked in and told Emily that Lucinda had been looking for her. Emily introduced Paul to Hunter, and Hunter told Emily that Lucinda had been acting weird. Emily decided she should find out what Lucinda wanted, so she told Paul goodbye, calling him \"Amnesia Boy\" and joking that she hoped he would remember their conversation.\n\n\nWhen Emily went into Lucinda's office, Lucinda asked her when she thought The Intruder might turn a profit. Emily said she had left her crystal ball at home, but if she had to guess, she'd say six to nine months. Lucinda told Emily that she had been discussing The Intruder with Hunter, and Hunter thought that the tone of Emily's writing needed adjustment. Emily was surprised by Lucinda's remark, but she was even more surprised when she realized that Lucinda was trying to fire her.\n\n\nLucinda told Emily that she lacked the youth, insight, and experience to take The Intruder into the 21st century. Emily retorted, \"How the hell would you know? You're stuck in the 19th century!\" Lucinda told Emily that she was going to make Hunter the editor-in-chief of The Intruder. Hunter walked into the office, and Lucinda said, \"I think I'll let you two work this thing out together.\" Lucinda walked out, and Emily told Hunter what had happened.\n\n\nLuke went to visit his grandmother at Worldwide and found her sitting outside her office in the boardroom. He asked what she was doing there, and she told him that there was a battle going on in her office. Lucinda then asked Luke if he was on his way to work, but Luke said he was actually going to quit, and then he told her not to look so thrilled. Lucinda told Luke that she wanted him to do whatever made him happy. He said he wasn't sure what that would be, but everyone had been upset that he had wanted to work with Damian. Lucinda told Luke that she would find him another job, and that made Luke realize that everyone's anger wasn't directed at the fact that Luke didn't want to go back to college, but rather at the idea that Luke might want to work for Damian.\n\n\nLucinda told Luke that she thought he was just confused, but Luke said the only thing that was confusing him was why he'd been listening to everyone else trying to tell him what to do. He pointed out that the only person who had listened to him was Damian, and he said he would be proud to work for Damian. Luke left.\n\n\nEmily told Hunter that in one fell swoop, he had succeeded in getting a promotion and ditching his would-be mother. She stormed out of the office, and Lucinda told Hunter to let Emily go. Hunter turned to Lucinda and said that he had never meant for Lucinda to fire Emily, because Emily was the heart and soul of The Intruder. He said that he couldn't do the job without Emily, and he quit.\n\n\nLuke found Noah again at Java and apologized for how he had handled the situation about college versus the job. He said that Noah was the most important person in his life, and he wanted Noah to be a part of everything. Luke said that he had decided he wanted to work for Damian and get to know Damian, which was something Noah had encouraged him to do from the time Damian arrived. He begged Noah not to freak out. Noah smiled and handed Luke a package. Luke, thinking it was the messenger bag that Noah had tried to give him earlier, said he couldn't take it, but Noah said he had exchanged the bag for some ties, which Luke was going to need if he was going to work for Damian.\n\n\nDamian went to the farm and told Meg that the neurosurgeon he'd found in New York had agreed to operate on Paul to try to restore his memory, as soon as Paul worked out a schedule with the surgeon. Meg was both grateful and relieved to hear the news. She then told Damian that Margo had told her that Dusty intended to plead guilty to the charge of planting the bomb that injured Paul.\n\n\nBonnie went to the Lakeview and found Dusty dressed all in black for his court date. Dusty reminded Bonnie that he had fired her, but Bonnie told him she wouldn't give up on him that easily. Dusty told Bonnie that because he had set the bomb, he would plead guilty. Bonnie left and went to the Snyder farm. Bonnie told Meg that Meg needed to go to the trial to speak on Dusty's behalf. Bonnie wanted Meg to testify about Paul's involvement in setting Dusty and Damian against one another, because Bonnie believed that the background information needed to be considered by the judge before any ruling was made.\n\n\nDamian told Bonnie that Dusty wasn't Meg's responsibility, and Meg said that she didn't want to get involved in the situation again. Bonnie pleaded with Meg to change her mind, telling her that Dusty was sure to spend time in prison if he pleaded guilty. She reminded Meg that Dusty would do anything for Meg and Eliza, and Bonnie thought Meg should step up and help Dusty.\n\n\nBonnie went to the courtroom and told Dusty that she had asked Meg to speak on his behalf. Dusty told Bonnie that he didn't want that, and since Meg wasn't there, he assumed Bonnie's powers of persuasion were a little rusty. However, Meg entered the courtroom a moment later, and Bonnie told the judge that Meg was prepared to testify that Dusty's actions \"were the result of severe provocations and emotional distress and without harmful intent.\"\n\n\nMeg took the stand, but before she could say anything, Paul entered the courtroom and announced that Meg shouldn't be any more involved than she already had been. Paul said that he had been the \"extreme provocation\" that had caused Dusty to act the way he had.\n\n\nThe district attorney objected, but the judge wanted to hear what Paul had to say. Paul took the stand and began to testify in a rambling way about what he had been told had happened. He told the judge that the whole situation had been the result of him, Dusty, and Damian all wanting the same woman, and that Dusty and Damian had figured out that he'd been setting them up and had tried to teach him a lesson. Paul said that the fact that the bomb had gone off was a \"technical malfunction, kind of like what's going on with my brain.\"\n\n\nPaul said that if he was the horrible guy everyone told him he'd been, then Dusty had a right to try to take him down. He told Meg that he was sorry, and he told Dusty that he owed him an apology, too. Paul said if the attorney wanted to throw the book at him, that was fine, because whatever life he had once had was gone anyway, but Paul didn't want to cause Dusty any more harm. The district attorney told the judge that he wouldn't press charges against Paul, so the judge told Paul that he was free to go. The judge then announced that Dusty's sentencing would occur within a few days, and he adjourned the courtroom.\n\n\nMeg approached Dusty and told him that she realized that she had misjudged him, and she apologized for that. Dusty said that he'd just been trying to look out for Meg and her daughter, but Meg said she could take care of herself. Dusty said he hoped so, because he was going to be out of the picture for a while. Meg said the judge might let Dusty off with just probation, but Dusty didn't think so. Dusty then told Meg that she had made her choice, and their relationship had ended a long time ago. He walked away, and Meg left with Damian.\n\n\nDusty asked Bonnie what would happen next, and Bonnie said they had to wait for the judge to make his sentencing decision. Dusty tried to say something, but Bonnie told him she already knew what he was going to say, that he didn't need her help and didn't like what she'd done for him. Dusty told Bonnie that he just wanted to say thank you, and then he kissed her on the cheek.\n\n\nAt the farm, Meg told Damian that at the hearing, Paul had been the \"old\" Paul, the loving and honest man she'd fallen in love with. Damian warned Meg that Paul could change back at any time because of his neurological condition, but Meg countered that Paul might stay the way he was for the rest of his life. She told Damian that she wanted to go see Paul right away.\n\n\nEmily went to the Lakeview lounge to have a drink. Paul saw her sitting there and asked why she had a box with her. Emily explained that she had been fired in an ambush. Paul said he was sorry, but Emily said she was sure she'd land on her feet. Paul mentioned that he hadn't seen Emily at Dusty's hearing, and Emily was surprised to hear that Paul had been there. Paul said he felt bad that he had messed up Dusty's life, so he had told the judge it was all his fault. Emily replied, \"Wow, you really are the anti-Paul!\" Paul took a sip of Emily's drink and flirted with her, saying he hoped some of his better qualities might still be there and that Emily might be able to remind him of them. Emily said, \"Let's get out of here,\" and they left.\n\n\nEmily and Paul went to Fairwinds, where Paul poured them each a drink. Paul asked Emily what had brought them together in the first place, before she'd shot him. Emily told him that they had been together off and on since they were kids, and that they used to team up for nasty schemes. Emily said Paul had found that kind of thing to be a turn-on. Paul asked, \"How about you? Turn you on?\" Emily replied, \"You have no idea.\" Paul said, \"You're right, I have no idea. About anything. I guess I'll just have to put myself in your hands ... as long as you return the favor.\" They went into each other's arms and began kissing passionately.\n\n\n",
