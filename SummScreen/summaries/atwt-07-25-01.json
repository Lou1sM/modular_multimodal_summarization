Carly quickly denies it but Jack suggests to her that Barbara will have everyone in town on her side, now that she's disfigured and her husband seems to have a mistress. He then hands her a subpoena forcing her to testify at Craig's trial. Jack finally tells Carly that he trusts her but she decides not to tell him about being with Craig. \n\n\nAfter giving a worried Hal the news that Barbara was attacked yesterday, Emily slips into her hospital room and tries to question her. After Emily reacts to Barbara's hideous facial burns, Barbara forces her out and later, Emily guesses to Hal that Barbara won't see him because she's afraid of what he'll say about her face telling him how self conscious she will be.  Emily then searches the hospital records to find out who's been requesting the bomb-making library books, unaware the stalker is nearby. Outraged to discover that Sierra has been with Craig, Lucinda reads her the riot act and reveals that Barbara was attacked yesterday.   Sierra rushes to the station house where she offers Craig an alibi for yesterday.  Margo pacifies her and leaves the room to make a few calls but warns she will be back for the truth. Her offer of help falls short when the timing of their meeting is off.  Margo later informs her she found out she was lying and Craig is returned to jail after he refuses to reveal that he was with Carly at the time of the attack. Carly learns he protected her and is deeply affected by his act, but still can't bring herself to tell the truth in front of Jack. \n\n\n",
