On her way out, Lucy stops her and asks if Rosanna thinks she did the right thing sleeping with Aaron.  Rosanna pauses, lowers her eyes to collect herself, and says, \"I think you did the absolute right thing by sharing that love with each other.\"  Rosanna grabs her purse then heads out the door.  \n\n\nPaul seals an agreement to rent Molly and Jake's old place (now owned by Rosanna Cabot) and pressures his sister to move in with him.  He again warns her about the perils of living with Barbara Ryan, \"If you don't get away from her now, you'll end up just like me.\"  She points out that Paul has lived an independent life spending time in Paris and trekking across the Himalayas.  Paul corrects her observation, \"There's a difference between running away and being free.  You outta know that Jen.\"  He wants Jen and Will to have a chance in life without Babs' influence.  Jen offers to bring Paul his old laptop computer that Barbara is holding in her suite.  He warns her on her way out that if she isn't back within an hour, he's going to come after her armed with garlic and wood stakes.  Later, Paul disappears into the other room looking for something, when Rosanna lets herself into what she still thinks is her vacant apartment.  She sees Paul's jacket and other miscellaneous possessions lying around and she thinks Craig has loaned the apartment out to his buddies as a \"flop house.\"  She makes her way to the kitchen.  While she is out of the living room, Paul returns to the living room and notices mamma bear's computer.  He calls out for Jen thinking she has returned, but Rosanna pops out of the kitchen.  They clarify the confusion, but Rosanna still thinks Paul should leave.  Paul says he already gave the Realtor a check for the deposit.  Rosanna says, \"I'll give you your money back!  I'm only going to say this once.\"  Both Paul and Rosanna yell, \"Get out!\"\n\n\nBonnie brings Sarah to the Country Club to begin her new job bussing tables.  Sarah looks more apprehensive about the type of work rather than actually doing work.  Jessica watches Sarah report in with her manager and then she finds her daughter.  Jessica doesn't think it's such a good idea to have Sarah working at the club and asks Bonnie what she hopes to get out of mentoring Sarah.  Bonnie needs to impress Troy at the center enough so she can count on his support when Bonnie applies to become Sarah's foster parent.  Bonnie also asks her mother if there is any way to obtain a DNA sample from Marshall without him knowing the purpose.  Bonnie wants to confirm her suspicion that Sarah is actually Marshall's long lost presumed-dead daughter Zara.  Jessica tells Bonnie there isn't any legal way to obtain Marshall's DNA without telling him why it was needed.  She looks her daughter in the eye and says, \"Let it go!  Nothing good can come from this!\"  She brushes past Bonnie on her way to a meeting.  Bonnie sees that Sarah is all dressed up in her new crew uniform.  Sarah would rather be wearing a bathing suit and lounging next to the pool instead of cleaning up after patrons.  While the supervisor and Bonnie discuss Sarah's schedule, the orphan waits by the door.  Marshall arrives and smiles at Sarah on the way to his table.  Later, Sarah pours Marshall a glass of water.  Marshall takes a moment to encourage Sarah, \"If you good at your job, you'll move up in no time.\"  Maybe Sarah felt patronized, but she intentionally tips the glass of water onto Marshall.  He bolts out of his chair and demands to know what is her problem.  Sarah aims her voice so that Bonnie could hear her from across the room, and yells, \"Don't yell at me!  You bumped my arm!  It's your fault, not mine!\"  Marshall grabs his paperwork and tells Sarah she has ruined an entire afternoon's worth of work.  Sarah pushes back telling Marshall that if he didn't make her so nervous, she might not have spilled the water.  She continues, \"I don't care who you are.  You're not the boss of me.  I can talk to you any way I want.\"  Marshall has had enough insolence and demands to talk to her manager.  Sarah begins to walk away and Marshall grabs her arm.  Bonnie rushes to the rescue and breaks the two apart.  Bonnie yells at Marshall, \"Don't you dare touch her!\"  Sarah grins knowing that her plan worked.\n\n\nJack tells Katie about a report from Interpol about Simon.  He says they tracked him to several different places, but lost him somewhere in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.  A light goes off in Katie's head and she thinks Simon returned to his sheep farm.  Mike and Katie head over to the Lakeview Lounge where Katie decides to go on an Australian adventure to look for her lost husband.  Since Katie has had such a heavy day, Mike tells her he'll go book they're reservations.  She's stunned he presumed that he would accompany her, and tells him, \"You can't come with me.\"  They argue about why it isn't safe for Katie to travel alone.  Mike says he can also get away because the burn unit at the hospital is almost finished.  Mike reminds Katie of their recent trip to Montana, \"You were there for me.  Please let me be there for you!\"  Katie relents and gives him a big hug.\n\n\nAt the Old Mill, Rick presents his blackmailer with a briefcase loaded with fifty thousand dollars.  The reporter has second thoughts about how much money he should have asked for, and he ups his demand to $250,000.  Rick makes a move, but the man pulls a gun.  Rick wants to know why this is happening to him.  The reporter turns the question around, \"You think you're the victim in this?  You used to get off on flat-lining.\"  He was referring to Rick's college days when he injected himself with drugs to make it look like he was near death, all in the name of fun.  Rick admits that he only kills the patients who can look forward to a life of immeasurable pain.  The blackmailer doesn't understand, \"You can't kill the pain, so you kill the patient instead?!\"  Rick remembered how it felt after he injected himself, how there was no pain, and he realized then that he did have the power to take away patients pain.  \"You're nothing but a sick demented psychopath!\"  This sets Rick off.  Rick lunges for the gun and pushes his blackmailer up against a wall.  With his other hand Rick chokes the man to death.\n\n\nEmily arrives at her mother's house all ready for Susan's afternoon wedding.  Emily notices that Rick is missing, but Susan dodges her daughter's curiosity and finds the minister to discuss some last minute details.  Emily and Alison chirp about Rick's whereabouts when Alison wonders if he skipped town.  Emily asks her mother to call Rick to see what might be holding him up.  She dials his number, but Rick doesn't answer.  Susan calls the hospital to see if he returned for an emergency.  Hal calls the station to see if an accident was reported.  Both calls yield no new news about Rick's whereabouts.  The minister taps his watch and urges Susan to get the show on the road.  She looks at the wedding posse and says, \"Look at you.  You think I've been stood up, don't you!  I don't believe it!  There's a reason Rick isn't here!  A very good reason!\"  \n\n\nOutside the Old Mill, Rick is topping off a grave for the reporter.\n\n\nHal tries to defuse the situation, \"Susan, nobody thinks that Rick ran out on you.  We're just concerned...\" Susan unravels at the seams.  She frantically searches her desk until she finds her car keys.  She blurts, \"I am going to go find my fianc\u00e9e!\"  She plods her way through the guests and is a few feet away from the front door with her two daughters close behind both trying to take her keys away when Rick opens the door.  He takes a step in, smiles and says, \"Hello sweetheart.  Let's get married.\"  Rick is disheveled, nearly out of breath, and his face and suit are covered in dirt.  The Stewart women all look like they've seen a ghost.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Rosanna and Lucy have one of their motherly talks at Fairwinds. Ro tells Lucy that Craig is driving her crazy and she needs to have a day for herself. She says she cannot get any work done. Lucy asks Ro if she thought that her and Aaron had done the wrong thing by making love on the camping trip. Ro eases her mind by giving the advice that if they love each other and were careful she had made the right decision. Ro doesn't tell Lucy where she is going to hide away for the day as to avoid Lucy having to lie for her. Meanwhile Paul is showing off his new rented pad to Jen. Quite plush I might add. He makes her an offer to move in with him. He also adds that her and Will deserve better than Barbara. Jen leaves and when Paul exits the room in walks Rosanna to find the peace she does not get. Paul and Ro squabble over who's penthouse it is. Apparently Craig had rented her place behind her back. He thought he had troubles with the poison ivy. Wait till Ro gets hold of him over this. Ouch! Bonnie gets Sara a job at the club in Oakdale bussing tables by the pool. Sara doesn't seem pleased with her new employment as neither is Jessica at Bonnie's hand in it all. Jess and Bonnie argue over Sara possibly being Marshall's daughter. Marshall came in for some lunch and who do you think served and deliberately spilled water on him? Sara accused him of it and he started yelling at her. It is Bonnie to the rescue with a shout \"Don't you dare touch her!\" Back at the Police station Jessica relays her fears to Margo about Sara and Marshall. The Stewart household is a nightmare of doubts on all's mind except Susan's. She yells at all there that Dr. Kovorkian, oops, I meant Decker is trying to get to her when calls to the hospital and Police Station were futile. Rick tells Star that he only did it to end the suffering of terminally ill patients. What about Bob and Gordo you ask? So did Star. He makes what I am afraid is a grave mistake by demanding 200 thousand more and calling Rick a \"Morbid freak who gets off on playing God\" Rick went berserk and attacked him. The outcome? Well, it did show the \"Morbid Freak\" digging the ground up. Hmmm. Could it be a final resting spot for the greedy reporter? Susan is about to go find Rick when he bursts the door covered in dirt and psychotically exclaims \"Hello Sweetheart, are you ready to get married?\". Katie is convinced that Simon is in Australia. Possibly at the sheep farm he had inherited. She tells Mike that she is going. Mike who seems to be unable to resist rescuing damsels in distress demands to go to. After all wasn't she there for him in Montana? He made a strong case and she relented.",
