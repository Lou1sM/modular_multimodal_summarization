Lucinda seems to have had it with everyone hovering over her, and she tells Lily that she likes the utter silence in the church.  Lily tries to persuade her to go home and rest, but Lucinda says no! that she is not dying, and that she wants everyone to go ahead and live their lives the way they usually do.  Lily agreed - and when she asked Lucinda what she would like to do, Lucinda said they should go to a bar.  But when they get to Yo's, they are surprised to see Keith in front of the building with a black eye!  Keith tells Lily that he ran into a door because he was thinking of her.....Lily knows this is a lie, but goes on into the bar with her mother.  What Keith doesn't tell Lily is that Luke gave him the black eye when they fought after Keith caught him and a friend drinking hard liquor outside of Yo's.  When Luke returned, he had a bag of ice for Keith's eye and apologized for hitting Keith.  \n\n\nWill goes to Paul's to tell his brother that he wasn't the father of Gwen's baby.   Paul isn't home, though, and Emily answers the door in her dressing gown.  Will is surprised as he didn't know Emily had moved in.  Emily tells Paul that he could call Paul on his cell phone - but when Emily admits to Will that Paul left to be with Rosanna, Will is angry that she has tried to use him to find out what he and his ex-wife are up to.  Emily admits that she did try, but tells him she is really worried about Paul.  Will believes her, but can't help throw in a few jabs about Paul and Rosanna and how Paul will eventually leave Emily for Rosanna.  Shortly after Will leaves, Emily gets a phone call from Susan who tells her that Rosanna was in an accident and is in the hospital.  Emily goes to the hospital and although her mother tries to persuade her to leave Paul alone for awhile, Emily tells Susan that he needs her and she is going to find him.\n\n\nUnfortunately for Emily, things are not going well for Paul.  Although Rosanna was talking after the accident and Ben thought the prognosis was good, Craig visited Rosanna and tried to find out if she told anyone about the baby.  Rosanna had seizures and went into a coma, from which Ben is certain she will not recover.  He encouraged Paul to talk with Rosanna, and Emily opens the door to the room just as he tells Rosanna that he loves her and pleads with her not to leave him as he will never love anyone like he loved her.  Rosanna does not respond to Paul's words, but Emily leaves the room in shock.\n\n\nHal has arrested Craig for the attempted murder of Rosanna.  Witnesses other than Paul have described how Craig purposefully ran into Rosanna's car at a high rate of speed.  Craig is incredulous - he refuses to admit that he did anything wrong.  However, when Hal leaves him alone in the interrogation room, Craig sighs and says to himself \"at least my baby is safe.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Keith tries to get Luke on the right path after he finds him and his friend drinking in the alley behind Yo's. Luke is belligerent with him, and wants nothing to do with Keith or any opinion he may have. Luke punches Keith on his encouragement, and it seems to help, but soon he is angry again, and he stomps off to get some ice for his hand. Lily reaches out to Lucinda, and they end up in a surprising location \u0096 Yo's. They bump into Keith and his black eye. He covers for Luke, which Luke appreciates and thanks him for; and Luke sneaks away without Lily or Lucinda seeing him. Craig's harassment of Rosanna upsets her; and she has a seizure and lapses into a coma. Paul accuses Craig of trying to purposely run her off the road. Hal arrests Craig for assault with a deadly weapon after witnesses identify him as the one who ran Rosanna off the road. Ben is not confident Rosanna will ever come out her coma, but suggests that Paul talk to her. Hearing this, Hal adds a new charge \u0096 attempted murder. Craig is shocked, but feels he has saved his son. Paul pours his heart out to Rosanna about how he much loves her and if she leaves him, he will never love anyone as he loves her. He pleads with her to awaken because he doesn't want to ever lose her again \u0096 all of this overheard by a devastated Emily.",
