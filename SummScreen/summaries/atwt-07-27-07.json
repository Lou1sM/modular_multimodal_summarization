While Sage goes to wash up, Barbara tells Will and Gwen that she'd like to start a trust fund for their baby, and that she'd also like to give them a monthly stipend to help them with school and family expenses. Although Will tries to argue with her about it, Gwen tells Barbara a simple \"thank you\" for thinking of them like that, and she takes Will in the other room and manages to convince him that they need to think about the baby now and accept Barbara's help. Will then tells Barbara thank you, too, and Barbara is pleased with Gwen's effect on Will. She leaves, and Gwen and Will put Sage to bed, telling her that Jack will find JJ, and that while Jack's gone, he and Gwen are her backup for him and will be there for her if she gets scared during the night. Will walks out, and Gwen tucks Sage in and sings her a lullaby, with Will hovering in the doorway listening.\n\n\nBarbara goes to the Lakeview, where she gets a call from a Dr. Voss, who tells her that Paul is in the hospital, alive but in a coma with severe head injuries; stunned, Barbara asks if he's certain it's Paul, and he says yes, that they've checked his fingerprints. Barbara says she'll catch the next plane up there, and the doctor agrees she should hurry, because Paul is still in danger of dying.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Meg and Parker are waiting for news about JJ when Craig comes to visit. Craig tries to get back on Parker's good side, reminding him of the friendship they used to have and accepting the blame for messing things up in that area. He finally starts to get back on Parker's good side when Parker comes across the Ouija board that Paul brought to the farm several weeks ago. Remembering that evening, Parker becomes depressed again and wants to go out for a walk; Meg tells him she wouldn't feel right if he were outside by himself this evening, so he agrees to go upstairs to read instead. Craig says he didn't mean to make anyone sad by joking about the Ouija board, but he can tell she misses Paul very much and that she was very much in love with Paul; she agrees and says, \"And I still am.\" Craig tells Meg that he knows she feels things very intensely and that she has a hard time giving up on things, and he says he likes that about her because he's not like that; Meg responds by saying, \"Yeah, right --- like with Johnny.\" She tells him that in a weird way, she can see that he would be a good father. He thanks her for that, and then Meg says that despite the heat and humidity, she feels cold tonight; Craig says he never knew what cold was until the night Bryant died. Meg says she hopes Jack and Carly never have to feel that kind of cold, and Craig replies, \"Amen.\"  Meg asks if Craig could try to work something out with Lucy so that he could see Johnny again, but he says that's difficult since he has no idea where Lucy and Johnny are. He admits that was his fault, saying Lucy asked him not to push, but he pushed anyway and drove them away, because pushing is who he is. Meg suggests he try changing that, and he says he did change, and everything was going swell --- he had the girl he wanted, but she was fooling him and seeing someone else on the side. He tells her that more than anything, he has always loved his children, and more than anything, his children are what he's screwed up in his life, but he had thought that maybe, with Meg, he could be a better father. Chagrined, Meg apologizes for having played with Craig's dreams like that, and he tells her it's not her fault and gives her a hug. As they embrace, Barbara walks up outside the porch and sees them; she immediately turns and leaves without telling Meg that Paul's alive.\n\n\nAt the construction site where JJ is being held, Silas and Ava, the kidnappers, can hear Jack approaching. Silas has Ava take JJ to the car, but JJ manages to drop a prized baseball card as a clue. When Jack walks in, he finds the card and knows JJ has indeed been there. Silas plants some dynamite and leaves the building, joining Ava and JJ in the car. JJ begs them to let him go find his dad and go home with him, but they tell him he's going to have to come with them now.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Katie realizes that Carly must have paid the ransom if she's expecting JJ to be released, and she tells Carly that she may have put Jack in danger, because Jack had a lead he was following and has gone to try to find JJ, thinking he has time because the kidnappers will be waiting for their ransom money. Carly wants to call Jack but realizes the ringing phone would alert the kidnappers to his presence, so she leaves. Henry arrives, and Katie rails at him about Carly's actions and tells him how worried she is about Jack and JJ, saying she doesn't even know where Jack is. Henry says he thinks he knows, and Katie drags it out of him. Meanwhile, Carly goes to the police station to try to get Dallas Griffin to tell her where Jack is, but he says he can't, and that he can't contact him because it would be too dangerous. He suggests she go home and wait for the kidnappers to call; angry at being dismissed, Carly turns to leave, but then she overhears an officer tell Dallas that Jack was right about the construction dust, and they talk about the construction site 2 miles from the farm where the kidnappers are probably holding JJ. Armed with that information, Carly finds the construction site and walks in, calling for JJ. When Jack hears Carly, he shouts at her to get out, but just then, the dynamite explodes, and part of the building collapses onto Jack. Carly finds him and digs him out, but he's not breathing, so she performs CPR on him. He regains consciousness, as Katie walks in behind Carly. Carly asks Jack if JJ's there, and Jack manages to tell her no but that there was a card, before he loses consciousness again. Katie berates Carly for badgering Jack under the circumstances, but Carly screams that her boy is still missing, and Katie retorts, \"And whose fault is that?!\" An indignant Carly shouts at Katie to go wait outside for the ambulance. When the medics and police arrive, Carly tells them what Jack said about a card, and one of the officers finds the baseball card; Dallas asks Carly if she recognizes it, and she does, saying it was JJ's favorite card. Dallas promises they'll find him, and they leave, as Katie bends down and hugs Jack, telling him the answer to his proposal is yes and that she loves him so much; Jack mumbles back, \"I love you, too ... Carly.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
