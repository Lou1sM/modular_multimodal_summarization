She told him to snap out of his funk and start doing something productive.  After Katie served him his favorite cookie dough ice cream, Henry admitted that he had let his fame as Geneva get to him.  He was terrified that Vienna was gone for good.  Katie told him to go back to the Lakeview and get dressed, and to stop wallowing in self-pity.\n\n\nBrad arrived home with the bad news that Kim had fired him, as well, and it was all Henry's fault.  Katie urged Henry to go apologize to Kim and to really mean it.  Henry reminded her that Vienna was in Sweden, but Katie said that if Henry dangled the spotlight in front of her correctly, she would return like a moth to the flame.  Henry went for it, and he dragged Brad with him to the television station.\n\n\nDamian urged Meg to shut the door on her relationship with Paul.  Meg wanted Paul to know that his stepping forward in court to support Dusty had been important to her.  She also wanted Paul to be active in their daughter's life, so Damian reluctantly said that he would not try to stop her.\n\n\nEmily and Paul were in the throes of lovemaking on the couch at Fairwinds. Paul laughed and had the poor taste to mention that with his memory loss, Emily was in the unique position to take his virginity from him twice in one lifetime.  Meg walked in unexpectedly and got a rude shock.  Emily got up to take a shower, but Paul appeared unfazed by the fact that Meg had discovered them.  On her way out, Emily whispered to Paul that next time, he should lock the door.\n\n\nPaul asked Meg what she wanted, and she said that she had wanted to talk about what had happened in court.  After what she saw, however, Meg wanted to leave immediately, but Paul asked her not to.  Meg got upset about Emily, but Paul asked Meg to stay while he got dressed.  While Meg waited, she found a framed photo of Paul with Eliza.  Emily returned first, and Meg criticized her for sleeping with Paul.  She accused Emily of taking advantage of Paul's mental state, but Emily just called Meg jealous.  Paul joined them, and Emily kissed him goodbye, leaving Meg flustered.\n\n\nMeg got down to business and thanked Paul for testifying on Dusty's behalf at the hearing.  She said that had given her a glimpse of the man she had fallen in love with.  She also urged Paul to have the surgery that Damian had arranged, but Paul refused.  Meg tried to convince him to attempt to restore his memories.  Paul said that he had no desire to be that Paul Ryan again, but Meg got Eliza's picture and pushed him to have the operation for their baby's sake.  Paul said he had no feelings for Meg and wanted nothing to do with her.  He made out a blank check for child support, but Meg tore it to pieces and stormed out.\n\n\nHolden and Lucinda discussed how to best help Luke get back on the college track.  Lucinda mentioned that Dusty was in something of a legal quagmire and was in no position to run Worldwide Enterprises.  Lucinda, therefore, was stepping back as CEO, effective immediately.  If Luke wanted so badly to work for his family's business, he could work with his grandmother.\n\n\nAt Worldwide, Damian and Lily discussed Meg's behavior.  Damian was afraid that Meg had gone running back to Paul, but Lily reminded him that Paul was Eliza's father and that was a strong bond.  She suggested that Damian let Meg go, just as Holden and Lucinda entered the office at Worldwide.  Lucinda asked Damian to put his ego aside and do what was best for his son.  Lucinda also told Lily to convince Luke to go to work with her as the new editor of the digital Intruder, but Lily voiced her opinion that they should all allow Luke to pick the job he wanted.\n\n\nLily was not comfortable with what was happening.  Lucinda and Holden decided to call for a vote on Luke's job situation, and the two of them stood together against Damian.  It all depended on Lily's opinion, but it appeared that she was not yet ready to weigh in.  Lucinda asked Damian bluntly why he was really back in Oakdale trying so hard to be part of Luke's life and family.  Lily shouted at her mother after that rude question, and she defended her ex-husband.  Holden got them back on point about the vote, when suddenly Meg ran into the office, calling for Damian.\n\n\nDamian wanted to speak alone with Meg, but Lucinda yelled, \"The hell you are!\"  Damian said that they would table their discussion, and he walked out with Meg.  Lily explained to Lucinda that Meg and Damian were friends, and Holden decided to go to the farm to check on his sister.  Lily accused him of trying to run Damian out of everyone's life.  She went home, and Holden followed.  Instead of going to the farm, he had gone home to ask what was bothering his wife.\n\n\nLily said that she had not liked what she had seen when Holden aligned himself with Lucinda.  Lily accused him of using her mother's tactics on her and Luke.  Holden claimed that he was only giving Luke an additional option, and then he asked Lily how she would have voted at Worldwide.  Lily answered that she would always vote on Holden's side, and they kissed.\n\n\nFans of Geneva Swift mobbed Brad and Henry as they entered WOAK.  The fans praised Henry for making the character \"gender irrelevant.\"  Kim threw out the visitors and reminded Henry of the rules she had made about his never going near the station again.  Henry implored Kim to give Vienna another chance at fame and stardom, but Kim said \"that ship\" had sailed.  She did admit, however, that Henry had a powerful fan base, so she offered Brad and Henry, together, the chance to co-host the show.  It was difficult for Kim to say the words, but she asked Henry to just be himself.  Brad flipped out and asked which \"self\" Kim was referring to, the \"booze-swilling card shark or the cross-dressing, back-stabbing goober.\"  Henry thought about Vienna, and he turned down Kim's offer.\n\n\nPaul found Emily at the Lakeview bar drinking champagne, and he invited her back to Fairwinds for \"more sex.\"  Emily thought it amusing that he seemed to have lost his subtlety along with his memory.  She nixed the idea because she said she needed to figure out what to do about a job.  Paul offered to pay all her bills, and he began nuzzling her neck.  They began kissing and ended up back at Fairwinds, where Paul massaged Emily's feet.  He asked her about her family, and for a moment, Emily forgot that Paul had no memory.  She explained that she had a son named Daniel, who was in boarding school, and a recently discovered grown son, who wanted nothing to do with her.\n\n\nPaul began to understand why Emily's job was so important to her.  He also realized that money was an issue, so he jumped up and grabbed his checkbook.  Emily yelled that she was not interested in handouts, and if Paul thought that he could pay her to sleep with him, he was out of his mind.  Paul said that he had more money than he needed and it bought him time so that he could figure out what to do.  He had hoped that it could do the same for her. Emily realized that Paul was sincere, so she took the check and walked out.\n\n\nDamian took Meg to his hotel room, and she told him that she had found Paul and Emily having sex on the couch.  She was furious with herself for even entertaining the thought that she and Paul might find their way back to one another.  Meg also said that Paul did not want his old memories restored.  Damian called Paul \"a damn fool,\" and he poured them drinks and further criticized Paul.  Damian assured Meg that he saw her entirely differently from her ex-husband, and the two of them kissed.  They came up for air, and Damian asked Meg if she wanted him to stop.  She answered by kissing him again, and they stretched out on the couch.\n\n\nHenry went back to the Lakeview and found a bouquet of flowers and a note that read, \"All is forgiven.  Can't wait to see you.\"   He immediately assumed that Vienna was on her way back to him, so he straightened up the room, took a shower and then called Brad.  He told Brad that he was expecting Vienna momentarily, and Brad and Katie were happy for their friends.\n\n\nBrad and Katie also talked about turning down Kim's offer.  Katie showed him a picture of a crib she liked, but Brad was shocked at the price.  He then declared that price was no object for a child of theirs, and he told Katie not to worry about finances.  They hugged and kissed.\n\n\nHenry put on one of his glamorous smoking jackets in anticipation of Vienna's return.  When he heard the knock on the door, he couldn't get there fast enough.  He opened the door, looked at the woman standing there, and said, \"Mom?\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "A depressed Henry is staying on Katie and Brad's couch, as Katie tries to inspire him to do more with the help of Cookie Dough ice cream. Brad thinks that Henry owes him since he got fired too so Katie thinks if they plead their case to Kim again then she might reconsider and as an added benefit since Vienna loves the limelight so much, if Henry gets her job back then she might come back to him. Henry is suddenly raring to go and he and Brad head out to plead for Kim's for mercy. However, Kim won't change her mind about hiring Vienna back since she alienated the audience when she hit \u0091Geneva', but she finally relents and admits that the audience is clamoring to have Henry back. Henry is caught up in his popularity again and seems to be considering the offer, but Brad reminds him what will happen with Vienna if he does take the offer. He decides to forgo the offer and a dejected Henry heads home. At home though, he sees a note about forgiveness and coming to see him attached to some flowers and he assumes, it is from Vienna and calls Brad and Katie to share the news. They are thrilled, but Brad seems to try to be hiding the fact that he is now worried about how he is going to be able to provide for his family without a job. Later, when Henry opens the door dressed to the nines with a romantic setting in the background, he is stunned and not so happy it seems, to find his mother there instead of Vienna. Damian is upset, as he vents to Lily about Meg being intent on talking with Paul, and seems to feel, he will never make headway with her. Lily is offering some comfort when Lucinda and Holden arrive with a proposal that Damian rescind his job offer so Luke can work at Worldwide. Damian is not onboard, and Holden sees Lily as the deciding vote. Lily is worried that Lucinda and Holden are manipulating Luke. Meg finds Paul and Emily after having sex and is beside herself, as she tries to hide her hurt. Paul doesn't seem too concerned, as he continues to show PDA towards Emily, but is wondering why Meg is there. After he goes to get dressed, Emily and Meg get into it about how Emily is manipulating Paul and is still desperate to get with him and Emily rides Meg about her being jealous. After Emily leaves, Meg tries to gather herself to explain to Paul that she is proud of him and his actions in court showed her glimpses of the man she once loved. Paul seems oddly causal and stuns Meg when he outright turns down the surgery option. He doesn't feel anything for her and is not sure why they even have to be around one another. As for Eliza, he will support her, but he doesn't think it will do either Meg or Eliza any good to be in his life. After he hands Meg a check, she stomps out claiming he really doesn't know her anymore. Meg interrupts the meeting with Damian, Lily, Holden and Lucinda and Damian leaves with her. Holden is not pleased and Lily staunchly defends Damian, and criticizes Holden for trying to run Damian out of everyone's lives. Damian and Meg talk about what happened with Paul, as she is saddened by who Paul now is. Damian lends a shoulder, which turns into much more when they end up in each other's arms. Paul finds Emily again, as they continue to flirt and spend time together. When she tells him that she is busy worrying about her future, Paul lends an ear and offers her money. At first, Emily is offended thinking he is paying her to have sex, but then she realizes Paul is genuinely trying to help, as they grow a bit closer. Later, Holden wonders what is wrong with Lily, as she claims that she doesn't like how Holden is acting; it reminds her of how Lucinda used to act towards them when they were growing up. Holden assures her that he only has Luke's best interests in mind. He also asks her whom she would have sided with earlier before Meg interrupted. Lily pauses but then claims that she would always side with him, but as she is hugging Holden, she doesn't seem to look very confident or happy.",
