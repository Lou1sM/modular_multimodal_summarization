Then Paul took a call from Margo and learned that Barbara had used her credit card recently in Oakdale.  Will wanted to go to the police station right away, so he and Gwen picked up Hallie to take her to spend some time with Alison.  Paul was convinced that his mother was fine if she had been shopping, but he realized by Emily's expression that she preferred that Barbara stay away.\n\n\nEmily reminded Paul that his mother despised her, and she admitted that she wouldn't try to talk Barbara out of relocating.  It made Paul angry when Emily called his mother \"toxic,\" and he declared that he was going to the police station, as well, to be with his brother when the police found Barbara.\n\n\nKatie pounded on Henry's door, demanding that he open it.  Henry shouted for her to go away, but he eventually opened the door.  He looked as if he had been on a bender for three days, and Katie was shocked.  She announced that she had received an email from Vienna, and she wanted to read it to Henry.  She then read an apology from Vienna for her lies, and a declaration that she still loved and always would love Henry.  Henry grabbed the email and wanted to take it immediately to the police in case there was a clue as to Vienna's whereabouts.  Henry was fearful that Vienna had caused Barbara to disappear, and Katie couldn't stop him.  She did follow him out, however.\n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police station, Margo showed Will a sales slip signed by a woman who had used Barbara Ryan's credit card.  Will said it looked like his mother's signature, but he wasn't positive.  Henry and Katie ran in, and Margo had Henry also check the writing on the sales slip.  He thought it looked like Barbara's writing, down to the special little flourish she always used.  The sale had been at \"Schotzie's of Salsburg,\" a lingerie shop in Old Town, one of Barbara's favorite shops, according to Henry.  Henry then offered to show a picture of Barbara on his cell phone to the sales clerk to see if she could identify the customer, but Margo said the police would handle it.\n\n\nPaul walked in the station and heard Henry explaining that he had specific knowledge of Barbara's lingerie that a cop wouldn't have, but when he mentioned what kind of thong she preferred, both Paul and Will groaned and made faces.  Paul told Margo that he and Henry might actually be able to learn more than an intimidating man in a uniform.  With great reluctance, Margo gave them some strict rules of conduct but did allow their fishing expedition.  Katie tried to go with Henry, but he stopped her and told her he didn't want her \"tagging along.\"\n\n\nMargo asked Katie why Henry was so short with her, and Katie said he could not forgive her for keeping Vienna's lie.  Katie felt awful at how she had treated Henry, but then she began sobbing that she had hoped that Vienna and Henry's happiness would be like turning back time to when she and Brad were that happy.  Katie said she couldn't keep going in such pain, and she continued to weep.  Margo held her, and when Katie got herself under control, she announced she was going home to Jacob for comfort.\n\n\nPaul and Henry headed to the lingerie shop and showed Schotzie, the owner, a photo of Barbara.  Schotzie said in her business she didn't pay much attention to her customers' faces, and Henry got pushy.  Paul had to back his brother off and apologize for him.  Henry began hyperventilating, but Schotzie had no paper bags, only plastic.  She gave him one to use, but it didn't help, so Paul hustled Henry out and straight to the hospital.\n\n\nChris talked with Tom and told him that he had spoken to their dad about being the new chief of staff at Memorial.  Tom was pleased until Chris said that Bob had offered the job to Reid Oliver, whom Chris called \"an ass.\"  He also revealed that Bob wanted the board of directors of the hospital to make the decision.  Tom advised his brother to \"earn the job,\" but Chris said he wanted the job for the right reasons, and then added that he wanted it a little bit because of Katie.  Tom had not realized that his brother and Katie were that close, and Chris admitted that they weren't because Katie was still grieving for Brad and feeling overwhelmed.  Tom advised Chris to take things very slowly.\n\n\nBack on duty at the hospital, Chris saw Paul lead in a very distressed Henry.  He put Henry in an exam room and gave him a paper bag to breathe into.  As Henry began to calm down, Chris admitted that he was in on the lie about Vienna's pregnancy, and Henry's breathing got much worse.  Henry whipped off the brown bag and declared he was mad at Chris and requested another doctor.  Paul peeked in the door, and Henry shouted that Chris had been part of Vienna and Katie's plot to keep him away from Barbara.  Henry called Chris \"Benedict Arnold\" and asked Paul to go to a nurse and find him a new medic.  Chris said Henry didn't need a doctor because he was fine.  Then Chris went outside the room and called Katie and told her about Henry's attack.\n\n\nWill and Gwen sat in Java and talked about Emily's reaction to the fact that Barbara might still be in town.  Gwen said she had a strange feeling that Emily and Paul might be in collusion about Barbara's disappearance, but Will had no thoughts about that.  They got a call from Paul and went to Memorial where they learned about Henry' anxiety attack.  Since Alison still had Hallie at the movies, Will suggested that he and Gwen go back to Barbara's hotel room to see if they had overlooked any clues.  Chris dismissed Henry, and Katie walked in to offer Henry a ride home.  Henry refused, but he did go after her and admit that some day in the very distant future, he might be able to forgive her.\n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Emily cuddled Eliza and answered her phone.  The call was from Schotzie at the lingerie shop.  She said that a recent customer had dropped a bracelet in the shop, and she suggested that Paul look at it and see if it might have been his mother's.  Then, at least he would know that his mother was all right fairly recently.  Emily thanked the woman, packed up the baby, and headed for Old Town.  She examined the bracelet but did not recognize it as one of Barbara's.  \n\n\nEmily asked to take the bracelet home for Paul to see, and Schotzie agreed. Before heading for home, however, Emily sat on a bench in Old Town and talked to a sleepy Eliza about her awful grandmother.  They looked at the bracelet, as her phone rang.  Emily talked to Paul, but she neglected to mention the bracelet.  She was in no hurry to go home, so she and Eliza sat there for a while longer.\n\n\nPaul next received a call from Schotzie, who wanted to know if he had recognized the bracelet that Emily had to show him.  Paul was puzzled because Emily had made no mention of a bracelet when he had just talked with her.\n\n\nEventually Emily got up and dumped the bracelet into a discarded popcorn box in the trash barrel.  Then she stuffed paper into the container so that the box was well hidden, but as she turned around, Paul was standing there asking what she was doing.\n\n\nMargo went home and learned from Tom that Chris was going after his father's job after Bob retired.  Tom said much of Chris's reasoning had to do with his feelings for Katie, however.  Margo declared that things \"couldn't be worse.\"  She explained that Katie had suffered a meltdown at the station that day, and a serious relationship was the last thing her sister needed.  Tom thought Chris was already in love with Katie and was, in fact, \"a goner.\"  Margo was not at all sure that Katie would ever recover enough to fall in love again.\n\n\nMargo reminded Tom that Chris had several unsuccessful relationships with Molly; her daughter, Abigail; Emily; Alison; Alison; Alison.  Margo was just looking out for her sister, but Tom accused her of not being fair to Chris.  They argued until Tom compared Katie and Chris to the two of them, soul mates and definite \"happily ever-afters.\"  Margo laughed, but she threatened Tom about what she would do to him if his brother broke her sister's heart.\n\n\nWill and Gwen arrived at Barbara's room in the Lakeview, and they opened the door.  They were unaware that just moments before, a woman wearing high heels had used a key and also entered the room. \n\n\n",
