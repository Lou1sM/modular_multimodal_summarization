    "soap_central": "\n\n\nMargo is at the Police Station telling the policemen that they need to go out and find Starziak and Jack.  He says that Jack is tough and is still out there somewhere.  She dismisses them and goes for a cup of coffee. Another officer tells her about the incident that happened last night between her husband and Doc Reese.  He tells her that they are both in jail.  Margo rushes down to see Tom.  Curtis comes into his living room to tell Jessica that there was a call from her office that Doc Reese and Tom are both in jail.  At the jail, a guard asks Tom if there's a message for his wife.  Tom says, \"nothing thanks.\"  Doc starts a conversation off with a smart remark to Tom.  He says, \"oh, you can talk, I thought you might have broken your jaw when you pounced on me after that sucker punch.\" Tom tells him that he is lucky that was all he did.  Being locked up for something I didn't do is not exactly what I call luck, Doc tells him back.  Tom infers that none of this would have happened, if you would have kept your hands off my wife.  Doc tells him again that he needs to get another song and dance, 'cause that one is getting old.  Margo arrives and asks what has happened.  Tom points to Doc, and Margo once again tells Tom that nothing happened.  I'm not the one who made love to Doc Reese.  Tom says, \"You're not the one, what does that mean?\"  Margo starts to say something as Jessica walks in interrupting Margo.  Doc tries to tell Tom again, Margo and him were not together the way that he thinks.  Margo also says that it never happened and all she needs is her husband.  Jessica tries to tell Tom also and Margo tells her to stay out of it, she needs Tom.  He tells her that he doesn't need her.  At the jail, Margo says to Tom, that there is something he needs to know.  \"What,\" says Tom, and Jessica says not here.  Tom tells her not anywhere, because he's not interested in hearing it, and unlike her he means what he says.  The guard calls out Tom's name and tells him that he is free on his own recognizance by order of the judge.  He prepares to leave and Margo tells him that they need to talk.  He agrees and says that when he calms down, he will tell her where to send his things and what they should tell Casey, 'cause his life will never be the same again.  He leaves and Jessica follows after him.  She wants to talk with him privately.  Meanwhile, Doc tells Margo, not to do anything.  He knows she thinks she is paying for Jessica's sins but it's not her secret to tell and if she wants to do the right thing, don't ever tell anyone what really happened.  He tells Margo he never forced her into anything.  He is trying to protect Margo, Jessica and her baby.  Whether or not it is his baby or Ben's, but either way the child's future is in her hands.  In the meantime, Jessica is telling Tom that his anger doesn't have to last forever.  \"If Margo loved me,\" says Tom, \"she should have protected me by telling the truth.\"  Instead, she didn't and he certainly can't trust her.  He had to learn it from a stranger.  He tells Jessica that the thought of being in the same room with Margo, makes him sick.  He then wants to know what the hate is that Margo has for Jessica.  He intends to tell Margo himself that she doesn't deserve a friend like her, and Jessica agrees.  She tells Tom not to do that however.  Doc says to Margo that he does care, even if she doesn't think so.  He cares about her, about Jessica and her unborn baby.  He and Jessica made a mistake and he hopes no one else will have to pay the price.  He tells her that she knows what will happen if Ben finds out about Jessica and him.  She agrees, and tells him that Ben will walk out on her (Jessica)  just like Tom did on her.  Doc says that even if the baby is Ben's, it will be born into a broken home, is that what she wants?  Margo tells him that she just wants her life back.  He tells her that you can't get it back by destroying someone else's.  He reminds her how long Ben and Jessica have tried to have a baby, and that Ben will be a great Father.  The guard tells Doc that his bail hearing is in a half hour.  Doc says that he and Tom can make the incident at the LakeView go away by dropping the charges against each other, she can make the rest disappear but only her, so please do the right thing, and don't say anything.  Jessica tells Tom to go home and talk with Margo.  Tom wants to know what's up; Margo has her lover and her best friend lying for her.  She tells Tom that Margo is not the guilty party.  Tom realizes that it was Jessica.\n\n\nBarbara has called Jennifer and Paul to meet her.  She has something to tell them and she hopes they will be understanding.  (Barbara remembers her conversation with Rosanna. Rosanna wants her to create a distraction so that she can consummate her marriage to Jordan.)  Barbara tells Paul and Jennifer that she must go to New York.  She has her symptoms back.  It could be something simple that will go away on its own or it could be a tumor, maybe something they didn't get when they operated.  Jennifer and Paul want to know what Walker thinks.  She tells them that he doesn't know, because their relationship has changed.  She has a specialist in New York to see. She wanted them to know about since she didn't tell them about her blindness.  She would like them to come to New York with her.  Jordan comes up to the table and tells them, that whatever she wants, just say no.  Jennifer asks Jordan why he is there and Barbara announces that she called him because she didn't want any secrets.  Jennifer walks away with Jordan to tell him about the conversation.  Paul asks when she is leaving and then decides that he should make some arrangements also.  Barbara makes a phone call to Rosanna, but passes it off as a distributor.  Jordan and Jennifer arrive at the table and he apologizes for saying what he did.  He wishes her well.  Jennifer will also accompany her Mother on the trip.  As they all leave, Barbara tells Rosanna that she has some wonderful news for her.  She will be leaving and taking Jennifer and Paul with her on her trip to New York, leaving her alone with Jordan, so she better make the most of her time with him.\n\n\nAaron arrives at Alison's house.  She has called him because she needs the opinion of her best friend.  Alison is preparing to see the Minister that will marry her and Chris.  She wants to make a good impression and wants to know if she is dressed properly and is saying the right things.  She shows him pamphlets that she got that will help her prepare for marriage.  Aaron is mystified by it all.  It is sounding like she might have some doubts and so he tells her not to marry him then. \n\n\nNikki and her Father, Hal, are talking.  He tells her that he doesn't know what he would have done, if she hadn't been there.  He has enjoyed her being there. She has been a life support for him in this time of crisis --  first losing Officer Cain and now the disappearance of Jack.  Emily has come down to the police station to see Hal and offer moral support.  She wants to know if there is anything that she can do.  Hal passes on her help and tells her to go on home and pray for Jack and Carly.  He walks away.  After he is rude to Emily, Nikki comes up to her and tells her that her Father is just tired and frustrated and the fact that he has been up all night.  That's how he gets when he's on a job.  Emily looks at her and thanks her for explaining the workings of her husband.  Nikki says that she is just trying to help.  Emily asks her when she is leaving town.  Before she can reply, Hal calls out to her for help, he needs her.  Emily arrives at the Minister's office.  She sees Chris there and wonders if she has arrived early.  Chris tells her that the Minister had to see some other people but he would be there shortly.  Alison is, of course, late.  Chris and Emily talk and are nervously talking because they are not comfortable in the same way with each other.  It seems they have grown closer and although neither mentions it, it is obvious.  Emily tells Chris that Alison wanted her to be there.  The Minister walks in and mistakes Emily for Alison.  He apologizes but says that they looked very much in love.    Alison comes in and they all talk.  The Minister is listening to Alison talk about what marriage means to her.  The meeting is over and he agrees to marry them.\n\n\nCarly dreams that Jack is standing in front of her.  Jack's vision is telling her that he died.  At this point, she wakes up.  Rosanna rushes over to where Carly is.  Carly tells her that Jack was there.  Rosanna tells her that she was just dreaming and Carly says no, it was Jack and he's dead. Rosanna says that her brain is over loaded with so much right now, that she just imagined it all.  Carly wants to go on down to the police station again.  She wants Rosanna to stay with Sage and Parker.  She wants to be alone right now.  Carly leaves and Parker comes downstairs looking for Mommy. He tells Aunt Rosanna that Jack was there, and was calling for Carly all night, then it just stopped.  Nikki brings in report of Jack's car.  It had blood on it.  It is at the lab and they are trying to determine whose blood it is, Jack's or Starziak's.  Hal asks Nikki to stay.  He tells her he called DC and the IRS and worked out a leave of absence for her.  They are short handed and he really could use her help.  She accepts his offer and tells him that they will find Jack.  Carly bursts into the office and asks what they are doing.  They need to be out there looking for her husband now!!  Hal tells her that everyone available is doing just that, they all want to find him.  He tells Carly that losing her temper won't help anything.  She needs to remain calm.  Carly tells him it's not up to him to tell her how to feel and how to react and where to go.  An Officer comes into the room and says they found a body; they are pulling him out right now.  At the scene of where the body is being hoisted, Hal and Carly arrive.  They bring up the body.
