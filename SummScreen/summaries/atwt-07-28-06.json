Holden talks about how tough it is to do this alone, saying he knows that Dusty understands and telling Dusty that whenever he feels like he's in a hole, to focus on Johnny. Dusty confesses that he's afraid he won't be the father Johnny needs; Holden tells him instead of thinking that, he should concentrate on letting Johnny be the son Dusty needs. Dusty leaves and goes to the cemetery, where he overhears Lucy speaking to Jennifer at her grave, apologizing for having made the mistake of letting Jennifer leave the hospital against medical advice. Lucy offers up a prayer for Jennifer, and when she turns and sees Dusty, she tells him that she'd seen him with Holden at the hospital and started thinking about Johnny and Jennifer and felt drawn to come to the cemetery. Dusty says, \"Yeah, I know --- it's rough.\" Lucy tells Dusty to take care, then she leaves.\n\n\nLuke meets Damian at Java for coffee and tells him he found out from Lucy that the pills Damian is taking aren't for allergies but for people who are seriously ill. Damian brushes that off by saying that \"no one lives forever, but fathers live on in their sons,\" and he tells Luke that's the reason he came to Oakdale: so he and Luke could get to know each other again and to gain Luke's respect and love. Luke asks how long the doctors said Damian has to live, and he says they didn't tell him and he doesn't want to know. When Luke tells him he wants to go back to Malta with him, Damian says no, because he should be with Holden and Lily and the kids, but Luke says Holden has lots of family to support him, and Damian's got no one but Luke.\n\n\nSimon and Carly look over plans at the Lakeview, and he tells her he has a blind bid out for structural repairs to the property but he'll give Carly a \"blank check\" in terms of her decorating budget because he puts his money in things he's interested in. He realizes he's left the repair bids upstairs, so he goes up to get them. Katie rushes over and tells Carly she needs to know what Simon is planning with regard to trying to break up her marriage to Mike. Carly tries to assure Katie that Simon hasn't got any such plans, saying Simon thinks of Katie as \"the one that got away.\" Katie leaves but runs into Simon in the lobby; she accuses him of using Carly for \"nefarious purposes,\" and Simon is amused by her choice of words, saying she's been reading too many trashy novels, then correcting himself to say he's heard that she's actually written such a novel, which Katie points out is a bestseller. He tells Katie that he's moved on with his life, and he suggests she do the same, then he returns to Carly's table. Simon gives Carly a check for her retainer, then he asks her to open the sealed envelope that holds the winning bid for his property repairs. Katie goes back home, where she rants about Simon to Mike some more, but Mike suggests that she \"stop worrying about Simon and start focusing on us.\" He tells her that he has a plan to take care of Simon, and before she can make him tell her what it is, Simon and Carly arrive at the house, with Simon waving a piece of paper around and asking Mike if this is some kind of joke. Mike explains to Katie that he put in a bid on Simon's job, and he asks Simon, \"Do I get the job or not?\"\n\n\nAt Crash, Casey prepares for the memorial for Lia and asks Gwen to sing. Gwen is uncomfortable with the idea because she didn't like Lia, but she eventually agrees. At the Lakeview, Maddie runs into Henry, who asks her why she's dressed up; when she tells him she's going to Lia's memorial, he tries to talk her out of it, but Nate arrives to pick her up, and Henry ultimately lets her go. Eve shows up a few minutes later and isn't happy to hear that Henry let Maddie leave. Maddie and Nate arrive at Crash, where Lia's friend Ann immediately accuses Maddie of murdering Lia. Nate and Casey separate the two girls, and Casey tries to get Maddie to open up to him. She admits that people want her to see a therapist and that the idea scares her, because she doesn't know what might come out in the open if she begins to talk about everything, but then Will interrupts, telling Casey that Gwen needs a sound check, and Nate comes back and offers to take Maddie outside for a breath of fresh air. Seeing Nate acting possessive with Maddie, Casey turns to leave with Will, and Maddie goes outside with Nate. Will finds Gwen and tells her the memorial is too much for him to handle right now, and Gwen agrees that it's a good idea for him to go home. On his way out, Will encounters Jade, who has just received news about the birth of Lily's baby boy; Jade is upset that no one called her to tell her about this, but Will points out that she isn't family and suggests that if she wants to see Lily and the baby, now is a good time to go since she didn't know Lia at all. Will leaves, and Jade leaves immediately thereafter. Maddie and Nate return to the entrance to Crash, but when Nate tells Maddie that he's wanted to date her for a long time and then kisses her, Maddie has another flashback to her sexual assault and pushes Nate away. Nate tells her maybe she's psycho after all, like everyone else is saying, and Maddie runs off. Inside, Gwen stands up to sing and says this is \"for Lia, and everyone who's lost before their time.\" As she sings, Nate, who is outside still, thinks he hears Maddie returning, but when he hears a noise behind him and turns around, he is attacked by the knife-wielding murderer.\n\n\n",
