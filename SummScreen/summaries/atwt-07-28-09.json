She told him that she had given him a warning by sending him the large floral arrangement, and Henry realized that Vienna was not on her way home.  Henry asked Audrey why she was there, and when she was leaving.  She said that she had seen Henry on television-in a dress-and she asked if he had anything to tell her.  Henry was suspicious of his mother's motive for her sudden appearance, especially after Audrey said that she forgave him.\n\n\nHenry reminded his mother that she had walked out on their family and left him to raise all his siblings, including loveable Maddie and not-so-lovable Eve, the Oakdale Slasher.  He declared that Oakdale was not big enough for both of them, and neither was his room.\n\n\nKatie asked Brad if he would go into the bedroom with her for a little \"recreation,\" but he reminded her that her pregnancy was high-risk, so their mantra was \"no getting frisky when it's risky.\"  Katie said, however, that she'd had a chat with her doctor earlier, and he had given the okay for these about-to-be-parents to have a little friskiness.  Brad scooped Katie up in his arms and announced that she did not have to ask him twice.  They began kissing, but the phone rang, and they heard Henry's panicked voice telling them that something terrible had happened.  He begged them to call him back.\n\n\nThat message put a damper on the lovemaking, so Katie went to return the call.  Henry was grateful to hear her voice, and he told her that his mother had sent the flowers and was actually standing in his hotel room at that very moment.  He had no idea what to do with her, so Katie invited both of them for dinner, and she hung up.\n\n\nJanet was cleaning the kitchen at the farm when Sage showed up looking for her dad.  Janet said that Jack had gone to Carly's house to see Sage, and she offered the girl one of Emma's special chocolate chip cookies.  Sage, however, was already busy with her laptop.  She was hoping that she had an e-mail response from Teri, the waitress who had befriended them in Chicago.  Sage was disappointed that she had no answer, and she wanted desperately to call her mom.  Janet stalled and said that she didn't think that Carly could receive calls where she was staying.  Sage asked if her mother was in jail, but Janet said it was more like a special hospital.\n\n\nSage asked for the number of the hospital, and when Janet refused, the girl accused her stepmother of not wanting her to talk to Carly.  Sage was upset that she had not had a chance to say goodbye to her mother, so Janet sat her down and explained that Carly would have said goodbye is she could have.  Sage was convinced that Carly was just as eager to talk with her, so she went in to watch television and wait for Jack to return.\n\n\nJack arrived at Carly's house, and he was not happy to find Craig ensconced there.  He chewed out Craig for taking his children to Chicago without his permission, and he included Rosanna in his criticism.  Rosanna said she had only gone to protect Carly's business interests, and she assured him that the children had been well supervised.  She apologized for upsetting Jack, although it was clear that to Craig it was no big deal.  Jack walked out, and Rosanna was irate.  She accused Craig of driving her sister to drink, but he soon calmed her.  Rosanna answered the door and signed for a letter from Carly addressed to Sage.  Craig was sure that he would get Carly's next letter.\n\n\nRosanna took Carly's letter to the farm and showed it to Janet.  Janet was hesitant about giving it to Sage right away, so Rosanna got on her soap box and lectured that Janet did not have a say in how Carly communicated with her children.  Janet reminded Rosanna that she was not the bad guy, and she urged Rosanna to wait for Jack's return.  Rosanna said her sister did not need a buffer, but Janet said that they had no idea what Carly's state of mind was, and Rosanna finally agreed.  She handed over the letter to Janet, who put it on the counter.  Rosanna left, and Janet remembered something she had to do upstairs.  Sage thought she heard voices, so she entered the kitchen.  No one was there, but she found her mother's letter and opened it.\n\n\nRosanna went back home and was disappointed that Craig was still there.  He accused her of micro-managing Carly's business interests, and Rosanna, in turn, referred to it as \"protecting her sister's interests.\"  Craig went into the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and Rosanna followed, harping at him that he did not live there and could not just make himself at home.  Sage crept in the front door and quietly went upstairs.\n\n\nCraig and Rosanna returned to the living room and went over some business papers.  They took another stroll into the kitchen, and Sage used that opportunity to sneak out the front door.  She was wearing her backpack, and she left an envelope addressed to Jack propped against a large flowerpot on the front porch.  She counted her money and came up with $57.00.  She thought aloud that it was enough money, and she ran off.\n\n\nJack returned to the farm, and Janet said that Sage was in the other room watching television.  She told Jack that his daughter had wanted to call Carly, and Jack said he had been afraid that would happen.  He was worried when Janet told him that Rosanna had delivered a letter from Carly to Sage, but he was relieved that Janet had handled it the way she had.  He asked to see the letter, and Janet reached for it, but it was gone.  So was Sage, they learned when they checked the television room.  Jack was not angry with Janet, but he quickly called Rosanna to see if Sage had gone home.\n\n\nRosanna told Jack that she had left Carly's letter at the farm, and Jack asked her to check Sage's room.  Craig found the envelope addressed to Jack on the porch, so Rosanna opened it and read it to Jack.  The note said that Sage had plenty of money and that she was on her way to see her mother.  She also told her dad not to worry.  Jack asked Rosanna to stay at the house, and after she hung up, Rosanna blamed Craig for distracting her so that she had not seen Sage either entering or leaving the house.  Craig said that he could catch the girl, but Rosanna said Jack wanted her to stay put.  Craig, however, convinced her that he was under no obligation to take orders from Jack Snyder, and he left.\n\n\nAt the farm, Jack figured out that Sage was most likely to take a train to visit Carly, so he headed for the train station.  Sage was, indeed, there, and she was surprised to run into Teri, the friendly waitress from Chicago.  They hugged, and Teri asked where Sage was going.  Teri grew concerned when she learned that the girl was going on the train by herself.  Sage explained where Carly was, and why, and she said that her mom needed her.  Teri stalled Sage by asking where she could buy some really good ice cream, so Sage told her about a place in Old Town and offered to take her there.\n\n\nThe two of them walked to Old Town and got ice cream cones.  They sat on a bench and Sage said that no one would allow her to talk with her mother.  She also confided that her dad and her stepmother had hidden her letter from Carly.  Teri suggested that Sage's folks might have had good reasons for what they did, and she suggested that Sage go back and ask her dad about it.  Sage was afraid that Jack would be very angry with her, so Teri offered to take the girl back to Carly's house.\n\n\nJack was searching for Sage, and he ran into Craig in town.  Jack was angry that Craig had horned in again on his family's business, and just then, Jack took a call from Rosanna.  She said that Sage was home with her, and she explained that the girl had bumped into a waitress they had met in Chicago, and the woman had taken Sage home.  Jack hung up but continued to unload on Craig as he drove away.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Jack thanked Teri for helping Sage, and then he talked with his daughter alone.  He tried to explain that Carly was not herself yet and that Sage still needed protection.  They had a good talk, and then they hugged. Meanwhile, Rosanna talked with Teri about the coincidence of her showing up in Oakdale.  Teri admitted that she had lost her job in Chicago, and when she was cleaning out her stuff, she had discovered Craig's business card.  She had come to Oakdale in hopes that Craig might help her find another job.  Sage walked in and announced that she was hungry, so Teri offered to fix her the special dish she had made at the restaurant.\n\n\nRosanna saw Craig walk up to the front door, so she let him in.  She told him about Teri, and laughingly suggested that they adopt the young woman because she was a good cook. \"Let her be the cool auntie,\" said Rosanna.  Suddenly, Craig had an epiphany.\n\n\nHenry and Audrey went to Brad and Katie's for dinner.  Henry continued to verbally slam his mother.  Audrey called Henry \"Hanky-Panky,\" which sent Katie and Brad into gales of laughter.  Audrey explained that Henry used to do a routine as a child in which he tied handkerchiefs together and did a dance.  Henry was mortified, but just in time, Katie announced that dinner was ready.  They had gotten a rack of lamb from the Lakeview, and Katie explained to Audrey that she was under doctor's orders to take it easy.\n\n\nAudrey immediately made herself useful in the kitchen, while Katie took Henry aside and called his mother \"a doll.\"  Henry compared her to the scary doll, Chuckie, and Katie said something about Vienna.  Audrey asked who Vienna was, and Katie answered that she was the love of Henry's life but that the two of them had recently broken up.\n\n\nAfter dinner, Audrey excused herself to go to the rest room, and Henry asked how he could get rid of \"Audrey the Abominable.\"  Katie told him to chill out; his mother was delightful.  Henry said that every word out of his mother's mouth was like a pitchfork in his psyche.  Audrey returned, and told Henry it was time for them to leave.\n\n\nBack in Henry's room at the Lakeview, Audrey said she needed some rest.  Henry gave the bed to his mother and offered to sleep on the couch.  Audrey said that she hoped that they could patch things up a bit, but Henry declared that it was too late.  Audrey thanked him for taking her to Katie and Brad's, and she gave him her room service order for eggs the next morning.  Henry said he would also order a sharp knife so that he could slit his wrists.\n\n\nCraig stopped at the diner and chatted with Janet, who was working the late shift.  She suggested that he leave Jack and his children alone.  Jack walked in, so Craig made a fast exit.  Jack asked Janet if she could reconcile having Parker and Liberty under the same roof for a while, and Janet agreed that was workable.\n\n\nCraig went back to see Rosanna, and he told her that she needed help with the kids.  He suggested that Teri might be just the answer, but Rosanna accused him of \"hiring staff.\"  Craig wanted to help, so he called Teri into the living room and talked about a job with Rosanna.\n\n\n",
