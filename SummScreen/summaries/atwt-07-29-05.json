Paul, who has just arrived, overhears this and punches Craig, knocking him to the floor. Hal and Margo intervene, and Hal tells Paul he has no business being there and should be arrested for assault. Paul tells Hal that Tom has indicated Craig might make bail, and he implores him to prevent that from happening. Hal tells Paul he seems to have a conflict of interest in sleeping with Hal's wife while still trying to be Rosanna's defender. Hal later reports that he told the bail judge hearing Craig's case that Craig had assaulted Jennifer, and the judge has refused to grant bail. Katie comes to visit Craig at the police station and finds out what he's accused of doing. He tells her it's another conspiracy against him, and that he'll never get out of jail. Paul tells Craig that he'll find out what it was that Rosanna was trying to tell him Craig had done, and that if the courts don't serve justice in Craig's case, he'll make sure justice is served personally. Paul then offers to take Jenn home, but Hal gruffly tells him that since Jenn is his daughter, he'll take her home. Jenn appears bewildered by the obvious animosity between Hal and Paul. \n\n\nWhen Katie leaves to go talk to Margo and try to get a first aid kit for Craig, he grabs a book of matches out of her purse and sets fire to the interrogation room, making his escape in the confusion that follows. Margo tells Katie she's going to organize a manhunt for Craig, and that she'll make sure he doesn't get away with this.\n\n\nHal, meanwhile, has taken Jennifer out for coffee, where he is interrupted by a call from Margo telling him about Craig's breakout. He leaves and asks Jennifer to stay put, so he can send some uniformed officers to watch over her until Craig is caught, but she leaves despite his warning and goes to find Dusty.\n\n\nDusty has been working at Lucinda's house, trying to prepare for the stockholders' meeting. Meg tries to distract him, then tells him she'll leave him alone so he can work, but she changes into a swimsuit and returns to the house dripping wet, which makes it hard for Dusty to concentrate. They kiss, and when Meg can't convince Dusty to go for a \"swim,\" they decide to go out for a drink. She picks the Lakeview bar, because Dusty's room is conveniently located upstairs, and after whispering to Dusty what her plans are, she goes to use the ladies' room. Jenn comes in and sees Dusty and tearfully tells him about her encounter with Craig and Craig's subsequent escape from the police station, telling Dusty she's worried that he might come after her. Dusty tells Jennifer that she's come to the right place, and he'll protect her. Meg sees the two of them together and makes a gracious exit, saying she was just leaving anyway.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Jack tells Carly he thinks she should go home to be with Rosanna's baby instead of waiting by Rosanna's side at the hospital for the medical transport people to come move Rosanna to the special clinic in Switzerland. Carly eventually agrees, and she says her goodbyes to Rosanna, promising her that she will make sure her son knows who his mother is and loves her like Carly does. She tells Rosanna that she doesn't even know what she wanted to name her son, but the nurses have been calling him Samson because he's proven to be so strong. Before she leaves, Carly tells Jack that she wants Craig dead for what he's done to Rosanna. Carly goes home and pays the nurse who has been watching Samson, but when the baby cries, she has a flashback to the black baby carriage with Iris's baby boy inside, and she sees it rolling away. The nurse leaves, and while Carly goes to get a bottle for the baby, Craig arrives and lets himself into the house. Carly comes out of the kitchen with the bottle and sees Craig pushing the baby carriage away and shouts out, \"You get away from that baby!\"\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Paul also goes to tell Rosanna goodbye. He talks to Jack first and tells him that Carly was right to blame him for what happened to Rosanna, because it really was his fault. He tells Jack he's glad that Rosanna picked him and Carly to raise her adopted child, because he thinks they're the opposite of his own family and will do a great job with the baby. He then goes into Rosanna's room and tells her he's sorry that he has always been too late --- too late to save Cabot, too late to realize that James made Rosanna break up with him, too late to believe Rosanna when she tried to tell him the truth, and too late to respond to her recent declaration of love. He promises never to be too late again, and never to be too good --- he will fight fire with fire and knock aside anyone who gets in the way of him protecting Rosanna or her baby.\n\n\n\n\n",

Paul promises Rosanna he will do anything he has to do to protect her and her baby. Carly recalls a little baby crying in the woods inside a baby carriage. Meg and Dusty's plans for a romantic evening are ruined when an upset Jennifer arrives asking Dusty to protect her from Craig who has escaped from jail.
