The sisters had not talked in 18 years, since Teri was in kindergarten, and Sage was excited that Teri would stay in Oakdale.  Teri admitted that she knew that Janet had moved to Oakdale, but she had no idea that she had stayed.  Jack was suspicious that Teri was perhaps part of some nefarious plot cooked up by Craig.\n\n\nJanet could not believe that her sister was there, but Sage's gloomy attitude interrupted their catching up.. The girl went outside, and Jack followed.   Sage asked him if Teri had only pretended to like her so that she could find Janet, but Jack was supportive and took Sage for a walk before dinner.  Janet explained to Teri that Jack was a great husband, but his kids made things very complicated at home.  Teri and Janet confessed that each had thought that the other wanted no contact, and they both realized that they were wrong.\n\n\nTeri referred to Janet's leaving home as when she \"disappeared,\" and that annoyed Janet.  Before Janet could explain, Jack and Sage returned, and Sage took her new friend to the barn to meet a new foal.  Janet was excited that her sister would finally get to meet Liberty, but she was unhappy that Jack still considered her sister a stranger.  To Janet, their 18 years apart meant nothing.\n\n\nCraig told Rosanna that Jack was \"territorial\" when it came to his children, but she answered that Jack made her feel like a failure in that department.  She felt bad that she had not fulfilled Carly's wishes that Rosanna care for the kids.  Parker arrived, and Rosanna told him that he could rejoice; his healthy days were over because Jack wanted the kids with him at the farm until Carly returned.  She told him that Craig had hired Teri from Chicago to cook and watch Sage, but Jack had put the kibosh on that idea.  Parker put his foot down and refused to go to the farm.\n\n\nParker thought the Teri plan would have been a terrific one, but he felt uneasy about living at the farm under the same roof as Liberty again.  Parker was afraid to trust himself under those circumstances, but Rosanna instructed him to go upstairs to pack.  Parker begged Craig to call Jack and intercede, and when Craig did not agree, the teen asked how long Craig had been letting Jack push him around.  Parker thought that Craig had more influence over his life as trustee of his funds, but Craig said that he had no control over where Parker lived.  Craig did not know what to do, so when Rosanna returned to the living room, he told her that Parker wanted them to take another stab at convincing Jack to let the kids stay with them.\n\n\nLily called Luke from the Lakeview and invited him and Noah to dinner.  Luke agreed, but he said that Noah was working night and day on his film.  After the call, Lily told Holden that Luke was going to feel cornered and that the two of them were ganging up on him.  The plan was to convince Luke to work for Lucinda at Worldwide instead of with Damian at Grimaldi Shipping.  Luke arrived, and Holden began his pitch for Worldwide.  He explained that there was no better expert than Lucinda for managing a business, and she would be running Worldwide while Dusty took time to settle his legal problems.\n\n\nHolden looked to Lily for verbal support, but she was not paying attention.  She was distracted when she saw Damian and Meg embracing and kissing in the foyer.  Holden finally got Lily's attention, but she suddenly declared that they should also have Damian's input for their discussion, and she dashed after him as he got into the elevator.  She went to Damian's room, and one look at the rumpled bed told her exactly what had transpired between her ex-husband and Meg.  She told Damian in no uncertain terms that Luke would be better off working with Lucinda because Worldwide was a better business model and had more integrity than his family enterprises.\n\n\nDamian was angry, and he shouted that their discussion was not really about business management as much as it was that Holden wanted Lily away from Damian.  He accused Lily of voicing her opinions because of what she had observed in the foyer.  Lily denied that and claimed that she and Holden were trying to guide their son through treacherous waters.  Damian called Lily jealous, and that made her even angrier.\n\n\nLuke spoke with Holden and said that he did not want to hurt Damian by switching companies.  Luke could not understand why Holden would not give him the freedom of choice that Damian offered.  Holden said that he only wanted what was best for Luke.  Luke pared down the problem by pointing out that Holden was trying to make Luke choose between him and Damian.  Holden called Lily, but she did not answer, so Luke reiterated that Damian had changed over the years and appeared to be a good man.\n\n\nHolden weighed that against his years of experience and evidence with Damian.  Luke said that his job was his own decision, and he had already made it.  Lily returned to the table with Damian, and Luke told his birth father that he still wanted to work with him and learn the shipping business.  Damian said that he would see him at work the first thing in the morning.  Holden told Luke that he was making a huge mistake, and Luke was surprised when Lily adamantly supported Holden's opinion.\n\n\nJanet could not believe that Jack did not trust her sister.  They argued about whether Rosanna had devised some evil plot to undermine Jack's influence with his children.  Jack did not care if Teri stayed in Oakdale, but he did not want her in the same household as his kids.  Teri and Sage returned from the barn, and Teri overheard Jack tell Janet that Teri was not welcome to stay at the farm.  Janet announced that dinner was ready, but Teri said she had to leave and find a job, because she had accumulated a \"pile of debt\" while attending school. The sooner she had work, the better.\n\n\nTerri hugged her sister and made a fast getaway.  Jack said that he had to think about his family, and but a tearful Janet said that the only one he thought about was his family.  She explained that when her parents found out that she was pregnant with Liberty, they had packed her on a bus to her aunt's house.  She had not even been allowed to say goodbye to her sister, who was in kindergarten.  Janet was upset that she had been given a shot to make up for that, but Jack has scared her sister away.\n\n\nCraig walked in the farmhouse and called out.  Janet joined him, wiping away tears, and told him that Jack had left, and she had no idea where he had gone.  She said her husband had virtually chased away her sister, and Craig was confused until Janet clarified that \"Teri\" was her sister, Teresa.  Craig found that incredible, but he told Janet not to worry, and he set off to find Jack.\n\n\nJack caught Teri at the train station in Oakdale and asked her not to blame Janet for his actions.  Teri wished Jack good luck with the \"mess\" of his life, as Craig found them.  Craig asked Teri to wait, but the young woman said that she had a train to catch.  Craig scolded Jack for letting Teri get away, and he hollered at him to allow her to stay in Oakdale, work at Metro, and see Janet and the kids occasionally.  It was what Janet and the kids wanted.  He asked Jack for once in his life to admit that he was wrong.\n\n\nCraig got Teri and took her back to Jack.  Jack said that he didn't want to be the one who separated her from her sister.  He admitted that he had no say about who got hired at Metro, but his children were staying with him at the farm.  Craig understood that, so Jack looked at Teri and said, \"Welcome to Oakdale,\" and he turned away.  Teri asked Craig what had just happened, and Craig told her that it had been a once in a lifetime miracle.  He next offered her the job at Metro and agreed to put her up at the hotel until she got her bearings.  Teri accepted graciously.\n\n\nCraig took Teri back to Carly's house, and Rosanna and Parker were thrilled.  Craig said that the miracle of all miracles had occurred: Jack Snyder had changed his mind.  Parker was pleased, even though he realized that he still had to live at the farm for a while.  Craig mentioned Teri's sister, and Rosanna got confused, so Craig told her she would never believe who that sister was.\n\n\nJack went home and told Janet that he was sorry he had been so insensitive.  He told her that Teri was going to work at Metro, and Janet was delighted.  Sage walked in, and Jack gave her the good news that Teri was staying in town, but when the girl found out that she was going to remain at the farm, she screamed that she didn't like it there and wanted to go home.  She ran upstairs to her room, as Janet told Jack that Sage deserved to sleep in her own bed, have her new friend, and be happy.\n\n\nJanet, Jack, and Sage paid a surprise visit to Carly's house, and Sage was ecstatic to see Teri again.  Jack said that he had changed his mind again, and Craig listened closely for the sound of a celestial choir.  Parker was happy with the outcome, as well.\n\n\nDamian rendezvoused with Meg in Old Town and said that Lily had seen them together at the hotel, and she was not happy about it.  He also told her about the \"summit meeting\" concerning Luke's job that Lily and Holden had dragged him to.  Damian asked Meg if she wanted to end their relationship because of family concerns, but she kissed him hard and said she was ready for more.\n\n\nLily and Holden went home, and Lily suggested that they back off from Luke and Damian.  Holden did not understand why Lily had changed her attitude about Luke's working for her ex, but she said that she had figured out Damian's agenda.  She told Holden that Damian was sleeping with Meg.  She felt Damian was attempting to steal their family, and she wanted to figure out a way to beat him at his own game.\n\n\nAt the farm, Janet and Jack kissed, and she thanked him for changing his mind about Teri.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Sage watched Teri cook something magnificent and declared that Teri was \"so much cooler\" than her sister, Janet.  Craig was also enthralled by the smells emanating from the kitchen, and Rosanna admitted that nothing had smelled like that since Carly had been away.  She could not believe that Craig had made Jack do a 180-degree turn with Teri, and about the kids staying with her.  They toasted each other with wine for finally agreeing on something.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Meg and Damian are so happy after an incredible night of making love but Lily isn't so thrilled to see them kiss good-bye in the Lakeview lobby. Holden and Lily try to persuade Luke to work for Worldwide instead of Grimaldi shipping and Lily even persuades Damian to let Luke make his own decision. Damian tells Luke he can take whatever job offer he wants and Luke wants to work at Grimaldi shipping. Damian thinks Lily changed her mind about Luke working for him because she is jealous that he is now with Meg. Lily denies the allegation and reminds Damian their relationship ended a long time ago and she is happy with Holden. Lily tells Holden that Damian doesn't have a family of his own so he is trying to steal their family but Lily is determined to beat Damian at his own game. Jack is suspicious of Terri because he thinks that Craig hired her as part of one of his plans but because Terri's arrival is too much of a coincidence. Jack doesn't want Terri taking care of his kids but once but Janet defends Terri after she tells Jack Terri is her sister whom she hasn't seen since Terri was five years old. Janet is hurt that Jack doesn't trust Terri to take care of his children and she and Jack have a big fight. Parker and Sage are mad at Jack because they don't want to move into the farm they want to stay at their house. Jack later agrees to Craig's idea that Terri work at Metro so she can spend time with Janet and Sage and Janet is happy about that and her and Jack kiss and make up. Sage on the other hand is still mad at Jack because she wants to live at home and not the farm. Janet persuades Jack to let Sage be happy because she deserves a little happiness after all that she has been through lately. Jack brings Sage back home and agrees to let Terri be the kids' babysitter for the summer. Rosanna praises Craig for persuading Jack to change his mind and helping to honor Carly's wishes that the kids live at home while she is in rehab.",
