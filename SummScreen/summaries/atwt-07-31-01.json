Ben said he felt that it was right for them to be married.  Lisa and Curtis urged Lien to give Ben an answer.  Lien finally said \"yes\" that she would marry Ben.  Ben put the ring on her finger.  \n\n\nTom asked Lien what she was doing saying yes to Ben when she doesn't love him.  She said in time that she would love him.  \n\n\nTom told Ben he's worried about the two of them.  Then he told Ben that Lien knew about the shots she was getting when she accepted the proposal, knowing that Ben saved her life.  Ben was furious that Tom told Lien.  Tom said he was sorry, but that he had to tell her because she had the phone in her hand and was about to call John and ask him to give her the shots.  He said if John found out about what they had done, it would be the end of both they're careers.  \n\n\nBarbara's House:\n\nJennifer wasn't buying that Bryant could already get a membership at the Country club when he just started working.  He spun more lies about Lucinda putting a good word for him and she stopped asking questions.  \n\n\nThe Hospital:\n\nBarbara looked at herself in a mirror when the guard told her that Carly Tenny was there to talk to her.  Barbara turned out the lights and turned her back to the door.  She told the guard to send Carly in.  Carly told her that she would have come sooner but that Jack had been keeping her updated on her condition.  Barbara wanted to know why she was there.  Carly told her that she wanted to tell her the truth.  Barbara told her that she didn't know what the truth was.  Carly said that none of the stories that Paul told her are true.  She said all she did was draw a few sketches because Craig told her he needed help to keep the company afloat and there was never any master plan to take her company away from her.  Barbara said she might have believed her if she didn't already know her too well.  Carly told her she was wrong, that she doesn't want her job and she definitely doesn't want Craig.  She said that Jack is the only one she wanted.  Carly asked her to take her off the witness list because she wasn't involved and she doesn't know anything.  Barbara told her if she wasn't involved then she shouldn't worry about being a witness.  Barbara told her that even if she doesn't go to jail, everyone would see the truth about what kind of person she is, once she is questioned on the witness stand.  Carly wanted to know what good it would do to make her look bad on the witness stand; everyone in town already knew what she has done.  Barbara told her once she has to tell all that has happened between her and Craig, then Jack would see her for what she really is and she will lose Jack.  Carly said how could you do that to Jack when he saved her life.  Barbara said she is saving Jack from her.  She asked Carly what she would do if she lost the one person that means the most to her.  She said Jack would never want her after Carly takes the witness stand.  She told Carly that she would lose Jack, just like she lost everything because of her and Craig.  Carly lost her temper and walked around where she could see Barbara's face and gasped.  Barbara grabbed Carly's scarf and began choking her.  Carly pulled away and Paul came in the room.  Paul asked what was going on and Carly told him that Barbara tried to kill her.  Paul told the guard to take a good look at Carly's face and not to let her near her mother again\n\n\nAfter Carly left, Paul told Barbara that Jennifer was in the hall waiting to see her.  Barbara said she didn't want to see her, she couldn't bear for Jennifer to see her now the way she looked.  Paul tried to talk her into changing her mind, but she told him to tell Jennifer that she was asleep.  Jennifer was upset and didn't believe that she was asleep since she heard voices through the door.  She and Bryant left. \n\n\nPaul told Barbara that he thought that she should let Will and Jennifer in, that they can't wait to see her.  He asked her to call Jennifer and tell her to come back.  Barbara said she couldn't see them yet.  She couldn't take looking into their eyes when they see what she looked like.  Paul told her that Jennifer thinks that all of this was her fault.  He asked Barbara to call Jennifer and tell her that she loves her.  Barbara said that Jennifer knows that she loved her.  Paul asked why is it that she will be able to go in public and testify when she won't even let her family see her.  She said that when she will be in public, she will have her face covered but she can't have her children look at her now.  Paul said that Will and Jennifer loves her and want to see her.  She told him that he was all the family she needed now.  \n\n\nCountry Club:\n\nJennifer and Bryant watched all the people having fun in the Country Club swimming pool.  Jennifer was still sad because Barbara didn't want to see her.  Bryant tried to convince her that it wasn't that Barbara didn't want to see her, but that she had gone through so much and she was just too tired to talk.  Jennifer felt better and thanked him for trying to make her feel better.  He asked her to move in with him.  Jennifer said she couldn't leave her family now.  She told him that she's not turning him down, but to wait and ask her again at another time.\n\n\nLakeview Hotel Restaurant:\n\nCass told Craig that the cops now think that he and Carly hired someone else to kill Barbara.  He also told Craig that Barbara would take the stand to testify.  He said that the prosecutor wanted the jury to see what she looks like.  Cass told Craig of the plea bargain Jessica offered.  He told Craig if he pleads to aggravated assault and battery, he'd be out of jail in 5 years.  He told Craig to give it some serious thought.  Craig asked how could he go to prison for 5 years for something he didn't do?  Cass told him that he might be able to talk Jessica into shaving a year or two off the sentence.  Craig asked Cass if it were him in his place, would take the deal.  Cass told him \"no\" not if he were innocent.  Cass said if they go to trial, he'd have to do more than discredit Barbara's testimony.  He said he would have to convince the jury that there were questionable motives for Barbara wanting Craig to suffer.  He would have to paint her as a jealous conniving woman that was manufacturing lies to get even with the man that broke her heart.  Craig said that sounded about right to him.  Craig told him to do what he had to do. \n\n\nCarly met Molly at a table near where Cass and Craig were sitting.  She told Molly that she was served a subpoena and had to testify at Craig's trial.  She told Molly that she hates Craig and hates Barbara even more.  She turned her head and saw Craig and Cass.  Carly told Molly that Barbara threatened to make her life a living hell.  Molly asked her about the kiss between her and Craig.  Carly told her that she has to be so careful because if there is one more story between her and Craig, Jack could leave her for good.  Molly asked if when she is on the witness stand, and they asked if she has any feelings for Craig, how is she going to convince anyone that she has no feeling for Craig, the way she was looking at him.  Carly said she didn't want to talk anymore about Craig.  Molly's phone rang; it was Craig asking to speak to Carly.  \n\n\nCarly wanted to know how he got Molly's cell number then asked what he wanted.  Craig told her about the plea bargain, but that he's not accepting it.  He reminded her that no one could find out about their kiss or they would be going to prison.  He told Carly not to volunteer any information.  He asked if she could lie under oath.  She said \"like a pro.\"  Craig wanted to know if she could convince the jury that she didn't desire him.  She said \"without a sweat.\"  He asked her about the kiss.  She asked, \"what kiss?\"  She told him she had to leave.  He told her to get some acting tips, that he didn't believe a word she said.  \n\n\nCass told Craig that if the jury saw him looking at Carly like he was looking at her then, that he was going to jail.  Cass warned Craig that Carly could put him in Prison.  \n\n\n",
