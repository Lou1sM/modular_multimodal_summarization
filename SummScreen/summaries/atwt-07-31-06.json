    "tvmega_recap": "Katie finds out that Mike bid on a job to work with Simon. Simon and Mike agree to work together; Mike wants to keep Simon close to keep an eye on him and Simon wants to work with Mike to prove he is on the up and up. Carly and Katie have their doubts. Holden is able to take his son home from the hospital, and he is thrilled that Luke is coming home as well or so he thinks. Once home though, Luke is forced to tell him that Damian needs him more and he won't be able to stay now. Luke can't tell Holden why though because Damian asked him to not tell anyone. Damian tells Lucy he is headed home to Malta soon. He then claims to Luke that due to some test results coming in, he has to head back to Malta by weeks end. Luke agrees to go as soon as he does one last thing. Holden worries to Lucy that Damian is going to take Luke back to Malta. Nate is savagely stabbed to death and left right outside Crash as Lia's memorial service is taking place, where a horrified Gwen finds him. People start to look at Maddie again as a suspect since she was seen with Nate last and is now missing. Jade ad Will show back up after the fact, which doesn't go unnoticed by Dallas. Maddie shows up to the Lakeview with blood on her hands. She claims to have fallen. Margo questions her and she admits Nate put the moves on her and she became freaked out and ran home like a kid. Margo tells a horrified Maddie that Nate was killed a little while ago. Dallas tells Margo that the stab wounds, blade and knife were all similar to Lia's murder. They appear to have a serial murderer on their hands, as Margo watches a lost looking Maddie being ushered into the elevator by Henry and Eve.",
