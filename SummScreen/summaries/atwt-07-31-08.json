Emma quizzed him on how badly he wanted Lily back and offered to talk with her. She decided to throw a big family barbecue to welcome Faith and Natalie home. \n\n\nThe Snyder girls were glad to see their brother, Luke, and Faith was concerned that Luke and Noah might move to California where gay marriages were allowed. Luke assured them that he was staying home. The girls asked Lily why Holden did not spend the night at the house, and Faith bluntly wanted to know if her parents were breaking up again. Luke fixed the girls a pancake breakfast and put them on cleanup duty. \n\n\nLiberty complained about her \"house arrest\" to Brad, and she especially resented Ugo, the giant bodyguard. Brad left for work, and Janet arrived and was taken aback by Ugo. He explained that his job was to keep Liberty safe, but Janet was not convinced. She planned to take Liberty home with her despite the protests of \"Lurch,\" as Liberty called Ugo. Janet and Liberty pushed past Ugo, but they were intercepted at the door by a returning Brad. He argued with Janet that he would do whatever it took to keep their daughter safe. Janet asked to take Liberty home with her, but Brad refused. Brad went to Liberty's room to get her, only to discover that the girl was gone. \n\n\nEmma called Lily and invited her and the children to the barbecue at the farm. Lily accepted but then had second thoughts about going. Luke went to Java to invite Noah, who tried to cheer up a downcast Luke. \n\n\nCarly asked Jack to come over and help with a sullen Parker. She suspected something else was going on besides the boy's anger with her. She queried Jack if he knew anything, and it was obvious to her that Jack did. Finally he shared with her that Parker and Liberty had become sexually active, and Carly went ballistic. She was furious that she seemed to be the last in the family to know, and she called Parker down from his room. She told him she knew about his relationship with Liberty, and Parker was especially rude to his mother. That earned him harsh words from Jack, so Parker turned his back and returned to his room. Carly left to take Sage to the Snyder barbecue. \n\n\nThe Snyder family gathered at the farm and the girls continued to question Holden about his absence from their house the night before. Faith got upset and accused her parents of splitting up again and declared that they must not love their children anymore. Carly drove in and dropped off Sage. Lily approached her former friend and screamed at her to leave her husband alone. She told Carly that she could not have sex with Holden and then just walk away. Lily was not aware that Faith and Luke had walked up and heard her loud discourse with Carly. Lily apologized to her children, but Faith yelled that she hated both of her parents and ran off. \n\n\nLuke caught Sage and tried to comfort her by the pond. Lily accused Holden of inviting Carly, but Holden denied it. He told Lily that she was out of control and was damaging the children. The two dredged up their old memories of each other's affairs until Lily told Holden that she could not be around him, and she went home. \n\n\nJanet and Brad panicked when they realized Liberty had slipped past them and Ugo. Brad fired Ugo on the spot, and he and Janet took off to find their daughter. Meanwhile, Liberty called Parker and asked him to climb out his bedroom window and meet her at Java. Parker agreed. \n\n\nCarly returned home and told Jack how awful the scene had been at the farm. Jack suggested that she and Sage take a trip together, perhaps to Montana, to have a change of scene. He offered to stay at the house with Parker, and JJ was still at camp. The two of them hugged. \n\n\nBrad found Liberty at Java and slung her bodily over his shoulder and carried her out. When Parker arrived, he could not find Liberty and tried to phone her. In Brad's car, Liberty was giving her father backtalk and trying to text on her phone. Brad grabbed the phone from her and pitched it out the window into a field of corn. \n\n\nNoah and Luke arrived at the farm, and Noah assured Luke that if the situation got too rough at the farm, the two of them could always get a place together. This pleased Luke, and they kissed.\n\n\n",
