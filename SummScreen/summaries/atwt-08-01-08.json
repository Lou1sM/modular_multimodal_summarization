Bob told Chris his lab work had shown an unidentified compound in his blood, but since Chris wasn't still having symptoms, Bob decided not to pursue the matter. \n\n\nIn the lounge, Alison was trying to study but seemed jumpy, twisting her new bracelet repeatedly. When Aaron sat down to talk to her, she told him she thought she should go to the hospital to study. On her way out, she spotted Chris talking to his dad. Alison went back into the lounge and told Aaron she didn't want to see Chris. When Aaron asked what Chris had done this time, Alison told him about finding Chris naked in the on-call room at the hospital. Aaron suggested Alison take the back way out of the hotel. \n\n\nAfter Alison left, Aaron went into the lobby and confronted Chris, telling him to stay away from Alison. Aaron told Bob about Chris's naked exhibition at the hospital. Bob couldn't believe it, but Chris confirmed it had happened and explained to his father that he'd had some type of blackout the day they'd been golfing, when Bob had been so concerned about Chris's health. Aaron left after giving Chris another warning to stay away from Alison. Bob asked Chris to tell him exactly what had happened. Chris said his skin had felt super-sensitive, like he didn't want anything touching it, and the next thing he remembered, he'd been naked and Alison had walked in. Bob said they should do an MRI on Chris to find out what was going on, and they headed back for the hospital. \n\n\nAlison arrived at the hospital, where Susan grabbed her almost immediately and took her aside. Susan told Alison she'd found out that Alison had gotten a C-minus on her last test, after having gotten a C on the test before that one. Alison was surprised to hear her last grade had been that low. Susan suggested that perhaps Alison had returned to school too soon and should take some time off before she flunked out and lost her chance to successfully complete the program. Alison became extremely irritated at her mother, accusing her of spying on her and rubbing her bad performance in her face. She stormed out of the room. \n\n\nChris ran into Alison at the hospital and asked her why she'd told Aaron about the incident in the on-call room after she'd promised she wouldn't say anything to anyone. Alison said she'd made no such promise, and she had other things to think about at the moment. She walked away, but Chris followed and overheard her leaving a message for Aaron. In her message, Alison said she felt that she was wrecking everything. She told Aaron she was going to go to the pond and asked him to meet her there. When Alison left, Chris did, too. \n\n\nAlison arrived at the Snyder pond, where she stared at the water vacantly and then walked into the pond, fully clothed. As she disappeared beneath the surface of the water, Chris ran after her, shouting her name. When Alison didn't surface, Chris dove into the pond. He located her and pulled her out of the water, then gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until she recovered. Alison was confused and didn't know what she had done until Chris told her. He wanted to take her to the hospital, but Alison said she couldn't go there and have everyone know what had just happened. Chris agreed not to take her there. He picked her up and carried her off and instead took her back to his room at the Lakeview. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg woke up late and told Paul she wanted to go out for lunch. Dressing, she put on the necklace Barbara had loaned her to wear at her wedding. As Paul came back into the room, Meg heard strange music, but when she asked Paul about it, he said he didn't hear any music. Paul was concerned about Meg's health, but Meg insisted she was fine. They went to the Lakeview for lunch. Paul went upstairs to invite Barbara to join them, telling Meg to go ahead and get a table. \n\n\nMeg stumbled as she walked up to the table; Aaron saw her and went to help her. He gave her a drink of water and went back to the bar after Meg assured him she was fine. Aaron then checked his cell phone and heard Alison's desperate message. He asked his boss for the rest of the day off, but on his way out of the lounge, he saw Chris in the elevator, carrying a very wet Alison in his arms. Aaron went up to Chris's room and pounded on the door, demanding to be let in. Alison told Chris to let Aaron come in. Aaron went to Alison, who was huddled under blankets on Chris's bed, trying to get warm. Aaron asked what had happened, but Alison told him she couldn't remember anything except going to the pond and then being brought back to town by Chris. Aaron asked Chris what he'd done to Alison. Chris said Aaron wouldn't believe him no matter what he said. Aaron agreed and called the police. \n\n\nMargo went to Chris's suite, where Chris explained what had happened and why he had followed Alison to the pond. Aaron insisted Chris must have drugged Alison. Alison couldn't remember exactly what had happened. When Aaron told Margo that Alison had been afraid of Chris, he backed it up by telling her about the incident in the on-call room. When Chris admitted the incident had occurred, Margo said she would have to take him to the police station for questioning. At the station, Chris asked Margo to test Alison's blood. He said he hadn't drugged her, but something was definitely wrong with Alison. Margo agreed to have lab work done on Alison, then she read Chris his rights. \n\n\nAlone at her table at the Lakeview, Meg had a hallucination of Sofie pushing a baby carriage. Sofie told Meg to think about the fact that Paul had let Sofie die in his arms, pregnant with what he had thought was his baby, then buried her to dispose of her body. Meg shouted at Sofie to stop, and everyone else in the lounge looked at Meg strangely for shouting at someone who wasn't there. Embarrassed, Meg got up and walked out of the lounge. \n\n\nPaul came into the lounge with Barbara and asked a waiter if he had seen Meg. The waiter told Paul that Meg had left in a hurry and had been acting strangely. When Paul asked what he meant, the waiter told him Meg had been talking to someone who wasn't there. \n\n\nMeg drove herself to the farm and told Emma she'd been having dreams about Sofie and that even though she knew Sofie was dead, she was still afraid of her. Meg asked if her mother thought she was going crazy. Emma said absolutely not, nor did she think Meg was being terrorized by a ghost. Emma said she thought the only person Meg was afraid of was Paul. Meg became upset and asked why Emma would think such a thing. Emma replied that Paul had buried Sofie on his own property to hide her body. Meg said Paul had done that to protect her, but Emma pointed out that that just meant that the man Meg loved had believed her to be capable of murder. Emma then said that at his core, Paul was an angry, vindictive man. Meg asked rhetorically why she had even come to see her mother, and Emma responded that Meg had come because she knew Emma wouldn't sugarcoat things for her. Emma said if Meg had wanted someone to say, \"There, there,\" and pat her hand and tell her platitudes, she would have talked to her husband, not her mother. \n\n\nPaul called at that moment, and Meg told him she had left the Lakeview because she'd suddenly felt a need to see her mother. She told Paul she would come back to pick him up, but Paul said he could get home and would meet her there. Meg told him how much she loved him, and they hung up. Meg told Emma she hadn't told Paul about her hallucination because she hadn't wanted to worry him. Emma hugged Meg and suggested she move back to the farm for a while, so that Emma could take care of her, but Meg said she couldn't do that. \n\n\nBarbara told Paul she was concerned about Meg and thought perhaps Meg should see a psychiatrist. Paul insisted Meg would be fine. He went home, where he met Meg and put her to bed for a nap. When he left the room, Barbara called to give him the phone number of a psychiatrist. Paul began to ball up the piece of paper he'd written the number on to throw it away, but he changed his mind and put the crumpled paper in his pocket. Meanwhile, Meg had another vision of Sofie and the baby carriage. In the carriage, Meg saw a handgun. Sofie told Meg that Paul had to pay for what he'd done, and Meg would have to kill him. \n\n\nEmily and Casey were having coffee at Java when Emily suddenly remembered she had an appointment for an interview. She sprayed on some of her new perfume and left for her interview. Emily went to the police station, where she tried to get information from Officer Banks about a home invasion. Margo interrupted and sent Officer Banks on his way. Emily started to lay into Margo but physically stumbled and had to regroup. She then told Margo to go ahead and insult her, but Margo said she didn't need to and that she was going to leave Emily alone in the future. Emily asked why, and Margo replied that she had realized Casey would grow tired of Emily on his own, without any interference from his parents. \n\n\nEmily again stumbled on her way out of the police station, prompting Margo to ask if Emily was playing the sympathy card. Emily said no and told Margo that whether she liked it or not, Casey and she were in a committed relationship. Margo told Emily to think about what would happen when Casey tired of explaining his much older girlfriend to his friends and decided he'd rather be with someone closer to his own age. Emily tried to slap Margo, but Margo caught her arm and reminded her there were penalties for assaulting an officer. Emily left, still angry. \n\n\nEmily went to Java, where she found Casey talking to a girl from school. After Casey introduced them, the younger girl left. Emily asked if people thought of her as a \"cougar,\" an older woman who liked younger men. Casey said he didn't think so but he didn't care. Emily asked if Casey had meant it when he said he wouldn't let anything come between them. Casey said he had, and Emily said, \"Then marry me, now.\" When he realized she was serious, Casey agreed. Casey and Emily took a flight out of town, and en route, Emily sprayed on some more perfume. When they arrived at their destination, Casey and a very eager Emily were married in a civil ceremony.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
