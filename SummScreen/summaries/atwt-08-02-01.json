Deciding to keep Carly in the dark about the photographs, Rose acted as though she was unaware of the video's content.  She then lied to Carly by telling her that the hotel keeps their videotape for one week and then shreds them.  Carly was ecstatic and she and Molly happily celebrated.\n\n\nHal went to the police station and suggested to a skeptical Jessica that she and the police department needed to follow up on his information about the bomber if they wanted to find the real culprit.  Later, Paul dropped by the station to give the photographs of Carly and Craig to Jessica, who decided it was best to surprise Carly on the stand with them.  \n\n\nUnbeknownst to Emily, someone followed her to the offices of The Intruder.  Suddenly the power went out and the prowler appeared at the door to Emily's office.  She tried to lock the door before he could open it and screamed when he broke the through glass, grabbed her neck, and began to choke her!  Luckily she was able to escape and set off the fire alarm.  \n\n\nSierra was astounded when Craig told her he was contemplating taking a plea bargain with the D.A. rather than take his chances in court.  He argued that five years in prison was better than life.  He came to his senses in the end and told Cass that he could not confess to a crime that he did not commit.  After Cass left the apartment, Sierra and Craig shared an intimate moment when they reminisced about their lovemaking a few nights earlier. \n\n\n",
