Sierra convinces him that he must break Lucy's heart so that she will return to Montega with Sierra and Alan, because this is the only way they all can make sure that Lucy will be safe.  When Lucy returns with the ice, Sierra leaves and goes back to Oakdale.  Dusty kisses Lucy, then tells her, \"I can't get involved with you.\"  Angry, Lucy abruptly says, \"Go to hell,\" and storms out of the room.

Carly and Hal jump into the pond to search for Parker, but Parker is floating face down with one arm over his inflated ring.  Parker wakes to  find himself in a place full of bright light with his dead half-sister, Nora, beckoning him toward a doorway.  Jack appears and tells Parker that neither of them belong there, and convinces Parker that he must go home to take care of Carly and Sage.  Jack takes Parker's hand and says, \"Let's go home.\"  Very soon Carly finds Parker in the water and takes him to the paramedics waiting on the bank.  The paramedics assure Hal that Parker will be fine, but that he should go to the hospital to be checked.  When Hal and Carly tell Parker that Jack is gone, Parker insists that he saw Jack and that Jack told him to come back. He tells all about his near-death experience, including Nora, the light, and the door, and he relates how he and Jack both walked away from the door.  As the paramedics put Parker into the ambulance, Carly tells Hal that she knows that Jack is gone, but that she believes that Jack saved Parker.\n\n\nOn the bridge, Molly finally pulls herself together and insists to Holden that she must put her life back together on her own.

However, Molly insists that Holden go back home and that she will move back to her apartment.\n\n\nCraig is poised with his suitcase for a quick getaway when Lily interrupts him and persuades him to come up to the main house with her.  He leaves his suitcase behind and has a conversation with Lily, convincing her that there must be some evidence that will incriminate Alan, if only someone would search Sierra and Alan's room.  As they talk, Craig receives a call on his cell phone from Wade, telling him that if he is not back at the carriage house in 5 minutes, his suitcase will be set on fire.  Craig rushes home and puts the fire out, then Wade tells him that he must have more money, since the original money Craig paid him disappeared when his partner was killed.  When Craig insists that he has no more money, Wade pulls a gun on him.  Lily, acting on her talk with Craig, goes to Alan and Sierra's room to search for clues.  She finds statements from Lucy's trust fund in Alan's suitcase.  Alan walks in and demands an explanation for her presence, and Lily lamely lies that she wants to borrow some sandals from Sierra.  Alan receives a call from Sierra as she returns from Reno, and tells Lily that all three of them will be on their way to Montega soon.  Lily blurts out, \"You can't do that!\"  Sierra arrives and Lily leaves.  As soon as she is out the door, Lily calls Craig, but Craig is immobilized by Wade's gun to his chest.  As Wade leaves, he promises Craig, \"If they get me, I'm bringing you down with me....they're going to know what a miserable rat you are.\"\n\n\n",
