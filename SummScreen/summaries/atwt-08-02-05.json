But, Jack surprises her when he suggests with all she is going through, perhaps the best idea for everyone is to find another home for Rosanna's baby. Later, Carly goes to see Iris demanding to know what role she played in hurting Iris's baby. Finally Iris relents, giving her side of the story until Carly, in a series of flashbacks, starts to remember herself and comes to the realization that Iris thinks Carly killed her baby. Meanwhile, Kim, who has found more information regarding the baby incident, counsels Jack to come clean about Carly's involvement. Kim warns that although it will be tough, Jack and Carly will only be able to get through it together. Will realizes Gwen's still having major misgivings about giving her baby up, especially now that the couple she planned to give it to has fallen by the wayside. Will sings Jack's praises, but Gwen won't be satisfied until she goes to Milltown and sees for herself. Will goes with her but the nurse slams the door in their faces. Lily and Keith's romantic all-nighter is unexpectedly interrupted by Faith, then Sierra, who's surprised Lily would risk her kids walking in on Lily with her lover. But, Lily insists Faith loves Keith and wasn't bothered by him being here. Sierra then suggests that they be there for Lucinda, who is receiving important news about her condition today. Meanwhile, Lucinda shares her latest pathology report with Meg, and both women are pleased it's positive news. Meg reminds Lucinda she will still need to undergo chemo, and practices yoga to help her relax. Sierra and Lily arrive but Lucinda insists on going to see her doctor without them.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Keith tries to sneak out of Lily's bedroom, but gets caught by Faith and Sierra. Lily and Sierra find out great news from Lucinda regarding her test results, but hide their disappointment when Lucinda has shared it first with Meg, as well as inviting Meg to go with her to her doctor's appointment. Gwen is working overtime to avoid thinking of her baby. Will notices, and suggests they go to see her baby at Carly and Jack's so Gwen can say a proper good bye. When the nurse prevents them from seeing the baby, Gwen lashes out at Will. Later, she apologizes and thanks him for always being there for her. Carly tells Jack the memories and nightmares are back. Jack suggests they give back the baby for her best interest. Carly can't, but freaks out later when she has another memory. She ends up at Iris' begging her to tell her what really happened. Meanwhile, Jack talks to Kim who tells him that she found a picture of a young Carly in a \"do not air folder\", and it claims she was responsible for what happened to the missing boy. Iris bitterly relays the story of how horrible of a child Carly was. She tells Carly when she left her alone with her son, she came back to find Carly acting innocent and holding an ice-cream in front of her son's overturned carriage. Carly starts to remember what Iris is telling her. She panics and runs outside, as Iris follows her. She tells Carly she can't run away for protection, and that she needs to open her eyes and admit the truth! Her words recall more memories of Carly hearing Iris say those very words to her dad. Carly turns to Iris and incredulously asks if Iris believes she killed her son?!",
