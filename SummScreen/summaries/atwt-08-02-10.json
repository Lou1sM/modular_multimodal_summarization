    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Marseilles, Craig and Lily combed the neighborhood near the address of their supposed perfume factory, but no one had ever heard of such a factory there.  Lily finally realized that they had been paying outrageous fees to renovate a factory that did not exist, but Craig declared that they had been \"scammed\" by someone whose \"initials were Lucinda Walsh.\"  Lily refused to believe that her mother could have done such a thing, and she said she was more inclined to think that Craig had set it all up himself.  Craig could not convince Lily that he was Lucinda's primary target, but they did agree that they were both \"sunk.\"\n\n\nCraig promised that they would work something out financially just as Holden found them and yanked Craig away from Lily.  He shouted to Craig, \"What are you doing here?\" as Lily asked him the same question.  Holden said he was there to make sure Lily got home safely, but she argued that she had to stay and figure out what had happened.  She explained that her factory did not exist, and Holden immediately jumped to the conclusion that Craig had orchestrated the whole thing.\n\n\nCraig defended himself and suggested that Holden go home because he was needed there.  Lily spoke privately with Craig and asked him to stay and \"poke around\" so that she could go back with Holden.  Craig reluctantly agreed and took off.  Lily wanted to know how Lucinda had found out she was in Marseilles, but Holden did not know.  He tried to warn her again about Craig, but Lily hurried him by saying that she did not want to be responsible for Holden's being late to his wedding.\n\n\nThey boarded the plane, but once over the Atlantic, Holden began questioning Lily about the way she had turned to Craig for help.  The pilot announced that they were heading into turbulence and asked the passengers to check their seat belts.  The weather got rough, but Holden kept reassuring Lily about both the weather and her business problems.  He wanted to know who had set Lily up, but she told him to stay out of her affairs.  They experienced some nasty bumps, as the pilot announced that they were going to land in Montreal until the weather cleared.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Luke found Dr. Oliver finishing a grueling seven-hour surgery, and reminded him that Holden was marrying Molly that afternoon and that they had planned on attending together.  Reid begged off, saying that he needed sleep more than sappy nuptials.  He called weddings \"archaic institutions dedicated to making promises that no one could keep.\"  He declared no vows could make up for broken promises.  Luke was disappointed because the wedding would have been his first date out with Reid as a couple, so the doctor offered to take Luke to a very public restaurant for their first date.  Luke declined and urged that the wedding would be a perfect place for Reid to work on his \"people skills,\" but Reid said he needed to sleep, and he went home.\n\n\nJack arrived at Carly's with the news that Holden had not yet returned from France.  Carly did not want to hear Jack's reasoning that if Holden had run off to Europe to rescue Lily the night before his wedding to Molly, then perhaps Holden was not ready to go through with the marriage.  Carly was unhappy, but just then Jack received a call from Holden who had just met up in Marseilles with Lily.  He was planning on grabbing her and heading back immediately.    After Jack hung up, Carly was hopeful that Holden would make it back in time.\n\n\nParker, who was dressed for the wedding, joined them and noticed that his mother was in a huff.  Carly asked Jack to put Molly's wedding gown in the car and advised him to pray that his \"overseas delivery\" got to the church in time.\n\n\nAt the farm, Natalie and Ethan woke Molly early on her wedding day in spite of Faith's protests.  The children asked where Holden was, and Molly explained that he was getting ready at the Lakeview.  Faith took the children out as Abigail greeted her mother.  Downstairs, Carly arrived with Parker, and Faith took the little children to pick flowers for the ceremony.  Carly asked if her cousin had the traditional \"old, new, borrowed, and blue\" items.  Molly had everything but something old, so Carly smiled and brought out her lucky feather from her wedding to Jack in Montana, and Molly was thrilled.\n\n\nParker headed outside to find Faith and the kids, as Luke arrived and greeted Abigail.  Carly insisted that Molly try on her dress, so the two of them went upstairs while Luke and Abigail chatted.  She commented that Luke appeared upset, but he said that it had nothing to do with the wedding. Jack arrived, and after he had greeted Abigail, he asked for Carly.  He went upstairs and found her alone, so he broke the news that he had seen on the Internet that a huge storm was brewing over the Atlantic and causing flight delays and cancellations.  Molly walked in and asked what that had to do with her wedding.\n\n\nCarly told Molly that Holden was on a plane on his way back from Marsailles.  Jack took over and explained that Holden had gone after Lily, who was in some sort of trouble.  Molly began to cry, so Carly tried to cheer her up.  Molly said she felt like taking a walk by herself, so she walked out while Jack and Carly fussed at each other.\n\n\nJack returned to the kitchen and told Abigail and Luke that Holden had gone to France to \"rescue\" Lily, but hopefully he was on his way back.  Luke called Holden's cell phone, but it went directly to voicemail.  Abigail was worried why her father would take the risk of missing his wedding to search for his ex-wife.  The door opened and Reid Oliver walked in, asking Luke if he was too late for the wedding.  Abigail went to him and introduced herself, saying, \"You must be Noah.\"  \n\n\nLuke cringed and remarked that there had been some changes.  Abigail needed some explanation for Luke and Reid's relationship, so Reid took Luke's hand and pulled him next to him.  He announced that he and Luke were \"together.\"  Reid asked Abigail why her father would fly to France to help Lily, and both she and Luke answered, \"It's complicated.\"\n\n\nParker talked with Faith on the porch, and the girl accused him of avoiding her.  Parker said he was being \"a little careful\" around her so that he didn't give her the wrong idea.  Faith was satisfied once Parker admitted that she was \"hot,\" and she went inside.  Molly walked out for her alone time and explained that Holden was going to be delayed indefinitely.\n\n\nJack, Carly, Luke, and Reid sat at the kitchen table and listened while Abigail read aloud the weather bulletins.  She said most of the flights already in the air were being diverted to Canada or Greenland until the storm passed.  Molly peeked in the window, but only Reid saw her.  He excused himself and went outside and joined her on the porch.  They talked about how often most residents of Oakdale swapped partners, and then they rejoined the group inside.  Molly asked Jack to open a bottle of sparkling cider and start the celebration, so Luke asked Reid what he had said to put Molly in a better mood.  Reid said he had simply told Molly that \"love sucked.\"  Molly toasted to \"coping when bad things happened.\"\n\n\nOn a little airstrip outside Montreal, Holden found out there were no flights out for at least two hours.  Neither he nor Lily could get phone service, but after a while, Holden was able to place a call to Jack.  He said to tell Molly that he would get there as soon as possible.  Carly joined Jack and convinced him to stall the celebration until Holden had returned.\n\n\nCraig barged into the Worldwide offices and demanded to see Lucinda.  The secretary said Mrs. Walsh was in a meeting and could not be disturbed, so Craig ordered her to drag Lucinda out.  He pounded on the door to the boardroom, but it was locked.  He loudly threatened to \"huff and puff\" and blow her \"damn world down.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lily is stunned to learn she was duped about the perfume factory and at first blames Craig. He shifts the blame onto Lucinda, but Lily can't believe her mom would do that to her. Luke would like Reid to accompany him to his dad's wedding, but Reid isn't very interested and would rather go home and go to bed. Furthermore, he isn't a big fan of showy displays of love. Luke is disappointed. Carly is worried about Molly's wedding going on as planned with Holden still in France. Holden calls Jack and promises he will be home in time. However, Holden is not pleased to find Craig with Lily and once he finds out about the scam with the phony perfume warehouse, he assumes Craig is behind it. Lily is stunned to find Holden coming after her, but she defends Craig. Lily finally agrees to head home with Holden so he won't miss his wedding. Molly, blissfully unaware of Holden's whereabouts, gets ready for her day with everyone's help. Jack is worried once he hears about the big storm closing down airports in the east and he goes to tell an agitated Carly. Molly overhears them talking and the jig is up; they have to tell her where Holden went, as Molly can't believe it. Faith is disappointed when Parker seems to be acting distant from her. Abigail and Luke talk about their parents and how complicated love is when Reid makes an appearance shocking Luke. Abigail thinks he is Noah but strangely, Reid takes it in stride. Holden and Lily hit turbulence and she ends up holding onto his hand. Holden hopes are dashed for making it home on time when the pilot announces they have to land in Montreal because of the weather. Faith and Parker come to an understanding. Molly isn't taking the news well that her wedding may be postponed because Holden took off to save Lily. Surprisingly, Reid is the one that gives Molly a backwards pick me up speech. Molly decides to have her wedding backwards while they wait for Holden. A furious Craig comes looking for Lucinda at her office. Her door is locked, but Craig is yelling and demanding Lucinda sees him right now or else. Holden is finally able to reach Jack to tell him where he is and that he is trying everything to get home on time. Jack explains that they told Molly, but he just advises he and Lily to get back safely. Carly won't tell Molly anything yet after Holden calls; it is her day and she doesn't want to ruin it with any news that Holden is still far away with Lily in tow. From a ways away, Molly watches Jack and Carly talk about this issue and seems to know something is up.",
