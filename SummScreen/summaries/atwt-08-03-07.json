Alison stepped up and said it was her fault, that she said the wrong things and gotten her mom upset. Bob asked Susan if she needed to take some personal time, and Susan said she didn't think so. Bob walked away, and Dusty told Susan that if she didn't leave with them to go home, he was going to tell Bob that she had been drinking. Cornered, Susan found Bob and accepted his offer of taking some personal time. Dusty and Ali took Susan to Al's Diner, and then Dusty left them there. Alison told Susan she realized she'd put her through hell in the past several months, and the thing she was most ashamed of was that she'd driven her mother to lose her sobriety. Susan told Ali not to blame herself, but Alison said Susan blamed herself for her problems and Emily's problems. Alison said she and her mom could help each other, and they could start by going to a meeting together because this was \"just a slip.\" Susan told Alison that she'd woken up that morning after having a nice dream about Emily and Daniel, and it took her a few minutes to realize that Alison wasn't living there anymore; she became depressed and had \"a couple of drinks\" at lunch to try to \"quiet that voice\" in her head, but then she realized she'd been planning to have those drinks ever since she bought the bottle of liquor a few days ago. Susan said she didn't want to go to another meeting and \"for the umpteenth time, stand up and say, \u2018My name is Susan, and I'm an alcoholic, and I've been sober for 20 minutes.'\" She then dissolved into tears, saying, \"I'm in hell!\" but she shook it off and agreed to go with Alison to the meeting. Afterward, Susan ran into Bob at the hospital and told him she'd been to a meeting because she'd been drinking. She admitted having come to work after drinking but said she hadn't diagnosed any patients or prescribed any medicine. She then told Bob to \"do what you have to do,\" but Bob said whatever he was going to do could wait until tomorrow and that they'd do an evaluation to determine how they needed to proceed. Then Bob told Susan, \"I'm proud of you. And I'm proud to be your friend.\" Susan replied, \"You've got lousy taste!\"\n\n\nAt the Lakeview bar, Aaron and Sofie were chatting when Sofie's boyfriend, Cole, walked in, upset that Sofie was still on duty. After listening to Cole giving Sofie a hard time, Aaron went over to him and tried to explain about this being a work-related commitment that Sofie had to honor, but Cole became antagonistic, wondering why Aaron was so interested in his girlfriend's problems. Sofie came over and got between Aaron and Cole and calmed Cole down; Cole made a superficial apology to Aaron and told Sofie he'd be waiting for her to finish work, then left. Sofie then apologized to Aaron for Cole's behavior, and Aaron asked her how many times she's had to do just that. Sofie admitted that she's had to do that a lot. Aaron walked out of the bar in time to see Alison with Dusty; Alison was letting Dusty know about being successful in getting her mom to go to a meeting with her, saying she'd left her with her AA sponsor. Aaron walked away, and Dusty asked Alison if she'd rather go somewhere else; Alison said yes, but it was time she started dealing with reality, including the reality of what Aaron thinks about her.\n\n\nIn a car on the way to Idaho, JJ asked Silas and Ava what they were planning to do with him now that they had their ransom money. Silas didn't like JJ's questions and told him he'd have to teach him some manners. When Ava also questioned why they were hanging onto JJ, Silas said it was because he had promised Les Sweeney that he'd take care of his kid if anything happened to him and bring him up the way Les would have wanted him brought up. Silas said they'd be \"like one big happy family.\"\n\n\nAt the police station, Jack told Carly that if she tried to go with him to Idaho, he'd have her arrested on the spot. Carly asked why she couldn't come, and Jack said because she was too emotionally involved. Carly pointed out that Jack was, too, and that on top of that, Jack wasn't even well enough to make a trip like that, so he should be leaving it to the uninvolved officers to track down JJ. Jack admitted that she had a point but still said he'd prefer that Carly wait at home and take care of Parker and Sage, and he promised to find JJ and bring him back to her.\n\n\nAt WOAK, Katie told Brad about the lead on JJ's whereabouts, and then she became upset with herself for feeling upset about Carly being there with Jack. Brad told her he thought she was doing a terrific job of dealing with a terrible situation, and he hugged her. He asked her if she was afraid of the worst, and she nodded yes. Brad said they all were, and he was sorry that she couldn't talk about it to the man she loved but was stuck with him instead. She went into his arms, crying, and Brad comforted her. Katie told Brad that he'd made her feel better and that she shouldn't be worrying about Jack and making him promise to call her before he leaves, etc., but Brad told her to look around, and there was Jack. Seeing them embrace, Brad told Jack that he should take Katie into a private office and say a real goodbye, and then he told Jack to be careful and that if he needed backup, he was there for him. Jack and Katie went into an office and kissed, then Jack said there was some unfinished business he needed to take care of before he left town. He got down on one knee and proposed; Katie accepted, and Jack promised to come back to her. Jack left, and Brad saw Katie's ring and congratulated her. Katie said she'd never been so happy, and she'd never been so scared.\n\n\nAt Will and Gwen's house, Gwen and Sage were going through some clothes when Sage found an outfit Gwen had bought for Johnny. That made Sage think about the fact that sometimes people take kids away and never bring them back. Gwen assured her that wasn't going to happen with JJ, and she said good things happen, too, then told Sage about the \"miracle\" baby she and Will were going to have in April. Sage was thrilled with the news. Carly walked in, and Sage told her; Carly said she'd known about it but had wanted Gwen to tell Sage herself. Then Carly told them she had good news about JJ, saying they knew where JJ was and that Jack was going to go get him. Sage was excited and went to get some cookies for Carly to give JJ when he got home; Carly told Gwen she didn't think Jack should be going alone, that something seemed \"off\" to her, and then she said that while Jack would do anything, including lay down his life, for his kids, he would never knowingly ask someone else to do that, so she was going to go, too. Gwen said it wouldn't be fair to Parker and Sage if both Jack and Carly put themselves in danger like that, but Carly said they needed to know that their mom and dad would do anything at all to save them if they were in trouble. She asked Gwen to watch Parker and Sage, then told Sage she needed to go help find JJ. Sage said JJ needed her more than she did right now, and Carly hugged her and told her she'd see her soon. She went to the Snyder farm and found Parker, who was looking at a map of Idaho because Jack had come to say goodbye and had told him where he was going. She asked him if he would go stay with Gwen and Will and Sage, and he asked if that meant she was going after Jack. Carly admitted she was and asked Parker not to tell Jack. Parker said he wouldn't, because JJ needed both of them right now to try to find him, but he said he'd rather stay at the farm because there was work to do around there. Carly said that would be fine. Parker said, \"Take care of Jack,\" and Carly responded, \"Of course,\" saying he knew she would do whatever it took to \"put this family back together again.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
