When Lily arrived the officer told her that they made a sweep of a downtown bar because kids under 21 were there. Luke was not considered drunk so it was up to Lily to determine what happened next. Luke could go home with Lily or he could stay and sleep it off. Lily and Keith took him home where Lily took away his privileges. When he left, Keith told Lily that Luke was hiding something from her. Keith tried to tell Lily that Luke was asserting himself and was searching for independence. He stopped Lily from going up to Luke's room. When Keith tried to pick up where they left off Lily stopped him and said she needed to go see her mother. Once they left, Luke tried to leave but was stopped by Keith. Luke told Keith to mind his own business. Keith said he cared about Luke and would do anything to protect him. Keith said he needed to teach Luke a lesson and led him away.\n\n\nHenry was lying on the floor and couldn't get up after his fall. His back was hurting. Katie wanted to call a doctor but Henry said he was uninsured so Katie made him comfortable by placing a pillow under his head. Maddie wanted to know how she was going to take care of him but Katie said they weren't going anywhere. Henry continued to cry out in pain and Maddie smiled because her plan was working. Maddie was supposed to catch a plane later that night but Katie asked if she would change her plans until Henry was better. Maddie acted very concerned and smiled to herself when Katie turned her back. Henry knew Maddie was the one who set the trap and told her that she wasn't staying. Katie came back in the room with an ice pack for Henry then excused herself to call Mike. Katie asked Mike to come over because she really needed him.\n\n\nBarbara and Jennifer were at the Valley Inn looking at the dinner menu. Jennifer told her mother she wasn't hungry but Barbara insisted that Jennifer needed to keep up her strength. As they continued to decide what to eat Dusty walked in. Dusty decided to rescue Jennifer and diverted Barbara's attention so he could get Jennifer out. Dusty took Jennifer to Yo's where she ate readily. As they ate, Mike came in and Dusty excused himself to take a phone call. Jennifer asked what Mike wanted. Mike told Jennifer he would always be there for her no matter how she felt about him. Jennifer wanted to know what Katie would think of that statement. Mike said that he didn't know because he and Katie weren't together. Mike tried to mend the fences with Jennifer but she told him that there was nothing he could do to make it right. Dusty came back and Jennifer told Mike to leave. Jennifer wanted a distraction so Dusty pulled out a proposal for her to look at. She opened the folder and suddenly broke down. \n\n\nPaul was going through a box of Rosanna's things and quickly put the box away when Emily walked in. Emily wanted to know what Paul was hiding.
