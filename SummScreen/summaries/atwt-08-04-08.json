Alison could not remember what had happened at the pond or in Chris's room, but Aaron was sure that Chris had drugged Alison. Susan went to check on Alison's lab results and ran into Margo. Margo relayed Chris's account of Alison's behavior at the pond to Susan, but Susan refused to believe her daughter had waded into the water on her own. Susan was sure Chris was behind Alison's weird behavior.\n\n\nMargo went into Alison's room to check if she had regained her memory. Alison could not remember, and Margo explained that she could not charge Chris with anything if Alison could not explain what had happened. Aaron was angry, but Alison agreed that Margo was right to let Chris go. When Margo left the room, she found Susan with Alison's latest lab results and learned that there were no toxins in Alison's blood. Susan did explain there was a strange compound in her blood, and the lab was working to determine exactly what it was. Susan was relieved there was no crystal meth in Alison's system but worried about what was really causing her daughter's blackouts. Margo told Susan she was off to the station to release Chris.\n\n\nIn the interrogation room at the police station, Chris told his father about Alison's strange conduct and suggested she might have been on drugs. Bob was worried that Chris would be accused of drugging Alison, but Chris tried to convince his father that he had saved Alison from drowning, not plotted to rape her. Bob explained to Chris that his behavior had also been very odd and that he should take a break from practicing medicine. Chris was annoyed with his father's advice and seemed unwilling to listen.\n\n\nMargo returned to the station and told Chris that Alison was recovering at the hospital, and her lab results proved she had not been on drugs. Margo went on to explain that Alison did not remember anything that had happened. Chris did not understand why Alison had acted so odd if she had not been on drugs and was worried about his ex-girlfriend. Margo and Bob warned Chris to stay away from Alison, but Chris was determined to learn what was making Alison sick.\n\n\nChris went to the hospital and wanted to see Alison's chart. Bob tried to stop his son from going into Alison's room, but Chris was adamant that he would see Alison. Aaron heard the two arguing in the hall and walked out to confront Chris. Aaron told Chris to leave, and Chris insisted he did not want any trouble but needed to make sure that Alison was all right. Bob finally pulled Chris away from Alison's room, and Aaron returned to her.\n\n\nIn her room, Alison showed Aaron the bracelet she believed her father had given her and worried that the good luck she thought it held had finally rubbed off. As Alison put the bracelet back on, Aaron reassured her everything would be fine. Aaron began to quiz Alison for her next nursing exam, but Alison soon became agitated and confused. She quickly began to complain about being hot and began to rip the blankets off her bed.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Chris pleaded with his father to check Alison's chart and try to find out what had made her almost kill herself. Bob was convinced and got Susan to hand over the chart. Chris thanked his father, and Bob explained he had done it so Chris could see Alison had the same rare compound in her blood that they had found in Chris's. Chris and Bob both realized it could not be a coincidence, and they were certain the compound was behind both Chris and Alison's strange behavior.\n\n\nAfter their impromptu marriage in St. Louis, Casey and Emily got a suite at one of the hotels and began to celebrate their honeymoon in bed. After making love, Casey shocked Emily when he referred to her as Mrs. Hughes. Emily suddenly seemed to emerge from a fog, and she asked Casey why he had called her that. Casey assumed Emily did not want to use his name but then joked that Emily regretted the marriage. Emily looked at her ring finger and suddenly realized she and Casey were actually man and wife.\n\n\nEmily bolted up and began to yell that she and Casey had made a very big mistake. Casey reminded Emily that getting married had been her idea, and she had been obsessed with the idea, but Emily could not remember convincing Casey to marry her. Emily grabbed her clothes and insisted they end their marriage as quickly as possible. Casey refused to let Emily get dressed until she explained why their relationship would not work. Emily admitted she loved Casey, but said loving him did not change the fact that they could not be married. Hurt by Emily's words, Casey told her he would do whatever she wanted.\n\n\nOn the flight back to Oakdale, the flight attendant recognized Casey and Emily and asked how the happy couple was doing. Emily and Casey's demeanor told her that things in St. Louis had not gone well. Once the flight had landed, Casey told Emily he could not deal with her craziness any longer, and unless she would to return to St. Louis to celebrate their honeymoon, they were over. When Emily said she could not stay married to him, Casey left brokenhearted.\n\n\nCasey returned home and told his mom about his marriage to Emily. Margo was infuriated by the news and wanted to know what her son had been thinking. Casey begged his mom to stop yelling then told her that Emily had dumped him. Casey took off his ring and threw it in the trash. Margo realized how devastated her son was.\n\n\nBack in her office, Emily tried to throw away her wedding ring but could not. She began to weep as she wondered why she was acting so weird. As Emily tried to get over dumping Casey, Margo barged in and demanded to know why Emily had convinced Casey to marry her, only to break his heart. Margo continued to push Emily for an answer, but when Emily stood to deal with Margo, Emily passed out.\n\n\nMargo took Emily to the hospital, where Susan was shocked to find her oldest daughter in the room across from her youngest. Margo phoned Casey from the hall to tell him that Emily had collapsed. Susan reassured Emily she would be fine, but out in the hall, Susan told Bob and Chris about Emily's crazy behavior and explained that she was very worried about Emily. Within seconds, Aaron rushed to Susan and told her that Alison was acting strangely again, and he needed Susan to look at her. Chris pleaded with Bob to let him help, and Bob agreed to get Chris reinstated so he could care for Alison. Chris watched from the hall and vowed to save Alison.\n\n\nKatie arrived at the farm and explained to Janet that Brad had left her a message saying he had taken Liberty on a road trip. Janet overacted and assumed Brad had kidnapped Liberty and threatened to phone the FBI. Katie calmed Janet down long enough to persuade her to ask Parker if he had heard from Liberty.\n\n\nJanet and Katie went to Carly's house and asked Jack and Parker if they knew where Liberty was. Parker refused to tell Janet anything and denied hearing from Liberty. Moments after Parker left the room, Katie received a call from Brad who explained that Liberty was with him, and they were fine.

Brad tried to explain that he needed to be alone with Liberty to get through to her about Parker, but Katie was not convinced Brad had made the right decision. Brad had heard enough and hung up.\n\n\nMeanwhile, out in the wilderness, Brad decided to deal with Liberty's recent lying by taking her to his own version of boot camp. Liberty was not impressed with the cabin that Brad had rented and was convinced that he had only taken her out of town to get her away from Parker. She decided she was going to head back to Oakdale on her own, and despite Brad's warnings about the wilderness surrounding them, she walked out. Brad knew Liberty would return, and a short time later, she did. Liberty ranted at her father about taking her out to bear country in an attempt to scare her out of having sex with Parker. She went on to tell Brad that she'd had enough of his fatherly love and was ready to go back to life without a dad.\n\n\nA short time later, Brad received another call from Katie, who pleaded with him to tell her where he and Liberty had gone. Brad still refused to tell Katie, so Janet grabbed the phone and threatened Brad with bodily harm if he did not tell her where Liberty was. As Liberty tried to rip the phone out of Brad's hand, he hung up and was determined to reconnect with his daughter. Liberty sulked around the cabin and whined about being hungry. Brad told her that her only chance of eating was to fish. Liberty was grossed out by the entire fishing experience but finally began to laugh and relax with her dad.\n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Katie finally figured out that Brad had taken Liberty to a friend's cabin at Half Moon Lake. Jack was able to confirm through a friend that Brad was at the lake. Parker overheard his father's account of Liberty's whereabouts and was determined to get to his girlfriend. Katie and Janet wanted to head out to find the two, as well, but Jack was convinced Brad and Liberty were safe and would be home soon. Katie told Jack and Janet she was going home. Meanwhile, Parker phoned the bus station and planned his trip to get to Liberty.\n\n\nAfter Liberty and Brad caught a few fish, they went back to the cabin to clean their catch. After leaving Jack's, Katie sneaked out to the cabin and looked in as Liberty squirmed over scaling the dead fish. Liberty began to sing as she gutted, and Brad complimented her on her beautiful voice. Brad was happy to learn new things about his daughter and was grateful the trip to the cabin had given them time alone. Katie looked in and laughed as she saw her husband and his daughter really bonding. Katie left reassured that Brad and Liberty would be fine. \n\n\n",
