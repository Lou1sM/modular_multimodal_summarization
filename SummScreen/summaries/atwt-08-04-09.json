    "soap_central": "\n\n \nMeg and Lily continued to have words about Damian.  Meg accused her sister-in-law of wanting Damian all for herself, and Holden walked in and heard their conversation.  Meg told her brother that Damian had offered her a job at Grimaldi Shipping, but that Lily did not want her to take it.  Holden asked what Meg knew about shipping, so she said that her position related to a new pharmaceutical division.  The point was, however, that what Meg did or didn't do was no one's business but her own.\n\n\nHolden realized that the women had been speaking about something different when he walked in. Meg said she had to get home to Eliza, and she left in a hurry.  Lily told her husband that he had been right all along about Damian; her ex had a definite agenda, and pulling Meg into his web was part of it.  Holden was worried about that, but he said that he was even more concerned about Lily's agenda.  He said that he could tell that Damian was beginning to get to her just as he had before.\n\n\nLily was upset at Holden's reaction, especially when he bluntly asked her why she had been Damian's greatest defender until she had found out that her former husband was sleeping with Meg.  Lily protected herself and said that she was worried that Meg was in over her head.  Holden apologized, and Lily said that she would straighten out her relationship with his sister herself.\n\n\nDamian and Luke, who was wearing a brand new business suit, discussed Luke's job at the company.  Damian was proud of his son and said that he expected the young man to earn his position.  He asked Luke to join him at a business dinner that evening at the Lakeview.  Luke hesitated because he and Noah were planning to celebrate Luke's first day at work together.  Damian solved that problem by telling Luke to invite Noah to dinner, as well.\n\n\nAt Al's, Noah met with Mason, his advisor, and they went over some major rewrite changes in Noah's script.  Noah was discouraged by all the red ink he saw on his copy, so Mason suggested that the two of them go see a movie locally that would help Noah establish his point of view better.  He also said they could go for a beer afterwards and discuss what they had seen.  Noah agreed, but he also asked if Luke could go along, and Mason answered, \"Absolutely!\"\n\n\nNoah left the diner and saw Luke in his new suit hurrying through Old Town, and he caught up with him.  Luke invited Noah to Damian's business dinner, but Noah said that he and Mason were going to see a film that might help his rewrites.  They kissed, and Luke promised not to be home late.  Noah went to the theater and found it empty, except for Mason.  He asked where everyone else was, but Mason said that he had arranged for a private showing for just the two of them, because Noah was his best student.\n\n\nAlison went to Java looking for Hunter.  He was there, working on his laptop, and Alison went right after him for getting Emily fired.  Hunter tried to tell her that she had the story wrong, but Alison was furious.  She told Hunter that he would get a payback by having to work for the terrible Lucinda Walsh.  She started to storm out, but she glanced at Hunter's computer screen and saw that he was looking at ads for jobs.  She asked him why, and she finally shut up long enough for her brother to tell her that when Lucinda had fired Emily, he had quit.\n\n\nAlison asked why Hunter had not told that to Emily, because her sister was thinking that Hunter had stolen her job.  Hunter said that his life was in shambles anyway after finding out that his mom wasn't his mother, and his father was an egg thief.  To top that off, the girl of his dreams turned out to be his test tube sister.  They both began to laugh, and Alison joked that it couldn't get much worse.  She told him to have faith, and perhaps she could help him find a job.\n\n\nPaul had a checkup at Memorial, and Emily waited outside and fiddled with her phone.  She had no messages, which was discouraging for someone recently fired.  Paul emerged from the exam room and declared that the doctor had given him a good report.  Emily did not believe him, and she persisted in wanting to know what Paul was not telling her.  She stopped a passing doctor and asked what Paul's prognosis was.\n\n\nThe doctor explained that the removal of the microchip from Paul's brain had left a small lesion that needed to be surgically repaired.  The condition was not terminal, but Paul would be taking an \"enormous chance\" if he did not have another operation to remedy that.  Emily turned to Paul and yelled that the lesion must be \"smack dab in the middle\" of his \"stupid center.\"  Paul admitted that he was afraid that if the doctors poked around in his brain, he would go back to being the old reprehensible Paul.\n\n\nThey went back to Fairwinds, and Emily was still all over Paul about getting his \"ticking time bomb\" repaired.  Paul had no desire to return to the Paul Ryan he had been, so Emily told him to do what he felt was best.  They hugged as Alison walked in.  Paul asked to be introduced, but Alison blurted out that he should \"cut the crap.\"  She was only there to see her sister, and she did not believe that Paul had amnesia.  When Emily said that was true, Alison laughed out loud.\n\n\nAlison got herself under control and claimed that even if Paul could not remember anything before the accident, he was still \"genetically evil.\"  Then she told Emily that Hunter had quit his job to show support for Emily.  Emily was delighted, and she left quickly.  Alison warned Paul to stay away from her sister.  She talked about the Intruder and how important it had been in Emily's life.  She said she could tell how Emily was suffering without it.\n\n\nAn upset Meg went to Damian's new office, and he noticed her plight immediately.  Meg said that she had just been to Lily's and that the two of them had fought about Damian.  She said Lily had lectured her on the dangers of being a Grimaldi, and it upset her that no one in Meg's family wanted her to have anything to do with Damian.  Damian appeared shocked, but then Meg accepted his job offer along with the conditions about a personal relationship.  Damian asked Meg to join him at the business dinner, and she agreed.  They kissed, and Meg left to get ready.\n\n\nLily drove to the farm and surprised Meg just as she had dressed for dinner and was leaving.  Meg tried to brush off Lily, but her sister-in-law said she had \"damn well better make time\" for her.  Lily accused Meg of being careless and insensitive with her remarks around Holden at their home, and Meg argued that Lily had provoked her into saying unkind things.  She told Lily to back off and stay away from her and Damian.  They continued to call names and spar as Meg walked out of the house towards her car.\n\n\nLily drove home and gave Holden the bad news that she had probably made things worse with Meg.  She urged Holden to pull out the \"big brother\" card and talk with Meg, but Holden refused.  He said that all they could do was let \"romance run its course.\"  Lily gave her husband a big kiss.\n\n\nDamian and Luke arrived at the Lakeview and met the business associate who had his daughter, Sarah, with him.  Luke was supposed to sit next to the attractive young woman, but he looked hard at Damian and excused himself and hurried out.  Damian went after him and made Luke stop.  Luke accused his father of parading a pretty girl in front of him in an effort to \"cure\" him of being gay.  Damian swore that there had been no set-up; he had no idea that the man would have his daughter with him. He promised Luke that he would never ambush him, and Luke apologized for overreacting and they returned to the table.\n\n\nMeg arrived at the table at the same time as Luke and Damian, so Damian introduced her.  Meg looked upset, and the business associate decided that they should talk business at a later date, and he excused himself by asking Luke to take good care of his daughter.  Meg said she preferred not to eat, either, so Damian took her up to his room, leaving Luke with his credit card, and Sarah.\n\n\nMeg unloaded about Lily's attitude that once a man had been with Lily, he was Lily's property for life.  She confided to Damian that Lily had warned her about how he would hurt her, but Meg did not believe that.  They began kissing, and then headed for the bed. Damian mentioned, as part of their pillow talk, that perhaps a working and personal relationship was too much for them, but Meg said it was just what she wanted.\n\n\nLuke and Sarah finished dinner, and Noah walked in.  Luke introduced Noah as his boyfriend to Sarah, and she said that she had not realized that Luke was gay.  She thanked him for a fun evening and gave him a kiss on the cheek on her way out.  Noah asked Luke if that was what being in business with his father was really about, and Luke mentioned that Noah was \"so cute\" when he was jealous.  Noah also suspected that Damian was sending a message, but Luke reassured him by saying that he was going home with Noah that night and for every night for the rest of his life.\n\n\nEmily hurried to Java and found Hunter still hunched over his laptop.  She told him that she appreciated his quitting his job in support of her, but he could beg his way back into Lucinda's good graces.  Hunter said that he did not want to work for Lucinda.  He also refused Emily's offer of help and money.  Emily was grateful that he had stuck up for her, and she left him.\n\n\nEmily returned to Fairwinds, and Paul told her that Alison had made him realize how much Emily missed her newspaper.  He asked what he could do, and she kidded him by saying, \"Buy me a newspaper.\"  Paul answered, \"Okey-dokey.\"  When Emily realized that he was serious, she was ecstatic and gave him a huge hug.\n\n\nHunter was upset with Alison for telling Emily why he had quit, so he went hunting for her in the hospital.  He scolded her, but Alison told him that Stewart women stuck together.  She had a bit of fun about his being a Stewart himself.\n\n\nLily called Damian, who was still in bed with Meg, and told him that she and Holden would not interfere with his relationship with Meg.  She hung up, and Holden called to her from upstairs.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Luke has his first business meeting for Grimaldi shipping with Mr. Rusk and his daughter Sarah who is very taken with Luke.

Noah later sees Luke having laughing and having dinner with Sarah and after Luke explains the misunderstanding to him Noah still isn't convinced that Damian isn't trying to break them up and set Luke up with a girl. Luke believes that his father has changed and he has made it clear to him that he isn't interested in girls. Paul doesn't want to have an operation to remove a lesion from his brain because he doesn't want to become bitter angry Paul again. Emily tries to persuade him to have the operation but he explains to her that he wants to start over with no baggage and she tells him to do whatever he feels is right for him. Allison tells Emily that Hunter quit his job after she was fired so Emily goes to thank Hunter. Allison doubts Paul's amnesia and asks him to stay away from Emily because she is vulnerable since she has lost the newspaper which was her life. Paul later makes Emily happy by offering to buy the newspaper for her. Alison tells Hunter that the fact that he quit his job when Emily was fired only proves that he is a Stewart because Stewarts stick together in the tough times no matter how badly they fight with each other.",
