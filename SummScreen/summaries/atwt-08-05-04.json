He had a flashback of himself and Emily. They looked pretty cozy. Alison was upset that Chris didn't appear to be interested in their wedding. Chris said that he didn't care about the wedding - it was the marriage that is important. They argued and Chris left in a huff. Emily arrived at the country club soon after and Ali begged her sister to talk to Chris about what was bothering him. Emily said \"no\" but Susan and Alison pressured her into it. Emily found Chris looking at a wedding cake. He seemed very unhappy. Emily asked him what was wrong and he said he wondered if he was making a big mistake by marrying Alison.\n\n\nAcross town, Dusty and Nikki were at the police station questioning a woman who worked at Yo's about Wade's whereabouts. She said all that she knew was that he had mentioned something about Paris. Dusty told Nikki they needed to look for Lucy in every town called Paris in the U.S.A. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Lily came bursting into Lucinda's place with a video tape she had found on the hood of her car. Lily, Sierra, Craig and Alan watched in horror as Lucy was buried alive, screaming in terror. Just then Sierra's phone rang and she answered it. It was Wade. He said that if she sent Alan with $2 million dollars to the bell tower at Luther's Corner he would tell where Lucy was. He added that if she sent Dusty or the cops, he would never tell where Lucy was and she would die. Sierra sent Craig away and told Alan and Lily what Wade had said. Craig called Lily and she told him that Alan was meeting Wade at the bell tower. \n\n\nDusty arrived at the mansion after everyone else had left and confronted Sierra. He demanded that she tell him where Lucy was being kept. She said she didn't know and confessed that Alan was meeting Wade with ransom money. Sierra mentioned the tape and Dusty and Nikki watched it. Dusty realized that Lucy was at some kind of construction site where they used sand. He looked up construction companies in the phone book and found one called Paris Construction. He told Nikki he was sure that was where Wade had buried Lucy. They raced to the place and searched for Lucy. They dug through the dirt and Dusty pulled Lucy out of the ground. Dusty yelled at Nikki to call an ambulance. Dusty told an unconscious Lucy that she needed to hold on until help arrived. \n\n\nAlan arrived at the bell tower and handed Wade the money. While Wade was counting it, Alan pulled a gun on the criminal. Alan demanded that Wade tell him where Lucy was. Craig came up the stairs and Wade told Alan that it was Craig who arranged the first kidnapping. Alan turned the gun on Craig and demanded that he stand by Wade. Craig insisted he was innocent. Craig wrestled Alan for the gun. It went off and Craig collapsed to the floor just as Lily arrived. Craig was shot in the arm. Alan accidentally knocked down Lily. When he went to check on her, Wade shot him and he fell to the floor. Wade pulled Lily to her feet with the intention of taking her as a hostage. Craig said that Wade should take him instead but Wade refused. Craig fought with Wade and was knocked onto the floor. Lily and Wade struggled and they fell out the open window. Lily held on for dear life while Craig tried to pull her up.\n\n\nBarbara told Paul and Jennifer that her doctor was coming over with the test results. Walker showed up at the door, wondering why a perfectly healthy woman such as Babs would be seeing a specialist. Babs said she resented that he followed her and Walker said if she was sick why didn't she tell him? Barbara wanted them to leave before the doctor arrived. A man arrived at the door, claiming to be the illustrious Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones was surprised to see a room full of people. He wasn't expecting that they would be there. Walker and Paul grilled Dr. Jones for answers and he said the tests were inconclusive and quickly exited the suite. Paul asked Babs how much she had paid the fraud pretending to be her doctor. Babs said she hadn't paid him. Paul pressured her into admitting that she lied about her symptoms. Jennifer was very upset because she had been so worried about her mother. Paul demanded to know if James was behind this ruse. Barbara denied it saying that Rosanna had set the whole thing up because she wanted to be alone with Jordan. Paul left angry and Jennifer followed soon after. Walker called Babs on the carpet and left her too. She was devastated. \n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Jordan told Rosanna that he had stayed up all night trying to think of a way to get out of consummating their marriage. Ro worried that Cabot would be stolen if they didn't comply with James's wishes. Jordan said that they would never please James and besides, they had a lot of money they could hire extra security. Ro said that wouldn't work. Jordan suggested that they walk into James's cell hand in hand and tell him they had slept together. Ro said James would know they were lying. Ro begged Jordan to put Cabot's needs first. Jordan agreed to consummate their marriage and they began kissing just as Paul walked into the room. \n\n\n",
