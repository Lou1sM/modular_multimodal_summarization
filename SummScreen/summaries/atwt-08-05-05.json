She tries to reach Keith on his cell phone but gets no answer.\n\n\nKeith takes Luke flying in his plane, and they bond while Keith tells Luke that up in the air, everyone's a kid again. He promises to teach Luke how to fly if he stays away from the booze and from the friends he's been drinking with; Luke agrees. After they land, they go to Al's Diner to have coffee, and Lily finds them there. When Keith tells her he's told Luke that he'll teach him to fly if he straightens up his act, Lily says, \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\nMike goes to Katie's cottage to help her with Henry. He manages to lift Henry onto the couch but insists on calling Bob Hughes. Dr. Bob comes over and tells Henry that he's bruised his back pretty badly and should stay put for 48 hours, then have an MRI and reevaluate. After Dr. Bob leaves, Henry tries to do the same, but Katie insists that he needs to stay put, and Mike and Maddie agree. Katie sets up a little table for Henry, who asks for his martini shaker and ice, but Mike nixes that idea because of the pain pills Dr. Bob has just prescribed for Henry. Henry sends Maddie off to get his prescription filled, and she pauses outside the cottage, where she has another of her fantasies about how things ought to be; in this one, Henry knocks Mike down, and Henry and Katie declare their undying love for one another. Henry apologizes to Mike for his sister's behavior; Mike tells him it's understandable, then he goes outside to talk to Katie. Maddie returns, and Katie tells Mike that Maddie has met her match in Katie but doesn't know it yet. Henry tells Maddie that she needs to stop playing match-maker, but she says somebody's got to. Outside, Mike tells Katie he'll come back in the morning so that he can help Henry take a shower. As he leaves, Katie tells herself that \"it's a start\" and goes back inside.\n\n\nJennifer goes to Paul's apartment and breaks down, telling him she doesn't know how to get back to a normal life now. Paul is little comfort, telling Jenn that it's for the best that her baby died, because otherwise Craig would have hounded Jenn and the baby for the rest of their lives. Jennifer is shocked and offended that Paul would say such a thing, then she sees that Paul has been going through some of Rosanna's personal things, and she realizes that he is grieving his loss of Rosanna. Paul blames Craig for everything and says that he wants to be sensitive to the anguish of every day because it helps him stay motivated, although he doesn't answer Jennifer when she asks \"To do what?\" Jennifer sees the baby's footprint in Rosanna's box. At first, they assume it's Cabot's footprint, but Jennifer notices that it was taken at Memorial Hospital, and since Cabot wasn't born there, it must be the footprint of the baby that Rosanna and Craig adopted. After Jennifer leaves, Paul says that's what Rosanna was telling him: wrong foot.\n\n\nGwen shows up at Carly's house and tells Carly who she is, saying she wants to see her son. Carly tells Gwen that the baby is her sister's boy, not Gwen's, but Gwen says she's the birth mother and wants to see him. Carly bristles and tells Gwen that Rosanna had said the birth mother insisted she wanted nothing to do with the child, and Gwen says that was before Rosanna was injured and Craig was arrested, and that since she knows nothing about Carly and Jack, she wants to see how the baby is. Carly says if Gwen wants to check them out, she can do it later, after Carly's had a chance to contact a lawyer. Carly offers to set up a visit for another time after talking to her husband, but Gwen insists she call Jack right now to see what he says. Carly goes into the kitchen to call Jack, and in the meantime, the nurse brings the baby downstairs. Remembering Gwen from her previous visit, she asks if Gwen has spoken with Carly yet, and Gwen says yes, and that Carly has said it was fine for her to see the baby. The nurse then lets Gwen hold the baby, and she goes upstairs to get a pacifier. Gwen tells the baby that she's his mother and that he's too perfect to have come from her. Carly walks in and shouts at Gwen, asking her what she thinks she's doing with the baby. The nurse comes back and apologizes, saying she thought Carly had told Gwen it was okay for her to see the baby; Carly says that's a lie, and that Gwen needs to leave immediately. Gwen refuses to leave, telling Carly that she's a mean, hateful woman and that she doesn't deserve to raise her son. Gwen tells Carly that she plans to fight to get her baby back.\n\n\n\n\n",
