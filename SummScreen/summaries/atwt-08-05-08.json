Katie arrived to tell them that all was going well at the cabin, but Janet was upset that Katie had gone there without her. She accused Katie and Jack of thinking Liberty was better off with her dad than with her. The three of them began preparing dinner.\n\n\nIn the woods, Liberty admitted her driving lesson with Brad had actually been fun. Her dad cautioned her to go slowly in all aspects of her life, and she got the message. Neither of them noticed Parker peeking through the window. Brad offered to walk to a camp store for supplies, and after he left, Parker walked in. He wanted to know why Liberty had not let him know she was leaving with her dad. Liberty tried to explain that she was enjoying Brad's company, but Parker did not believe her. As Brad returned, Parker hid.\n\n\nWhile napping in her bedroom in Fairwinds, Meg saw the vision of Sofie once more. Sofie told her to kill Paul in order to save herself. Meanwhile, Paul called the psychiatrist, Lynn Michaels, to advise the doctor about Meg. Sofie continued to taunt Meg until Meg got so upset that Paul heard her noises and ran to her. He comforted his wife and suggested she seek professional help from Dr. Michaels. Meg resisted, but Paul told her he had already made an appointment for her. Sofie's image returned and continued to upset Meg.\n\n\nLiberty asked Brad if she was still going to be under house arrest when they returned home. She was particularly worried that Ugo would be accompanying her to classes. Brad told her he still had the right to determine whom she could see. Liberty protested that Brad had not bought mustard and pleaded with him to go back to the store.\n\n\nAs soon as Brad left, Parker returned and suggested that he and Liberty run away together. \"Get real!\" said Liberty. Parker kept after her until Liberty agreed to drive Brad's car and go with Parker. The girl's driving skills were dramatically lacking, so they did not get far. Brad returned to the empty cabin and found his daughter, his keys, and his car missing.\n\n\nKatie called Brad and confessed to sneaking around the cabin to see what had been happening. He told her that Liberty had taken the car while he'd been gone and asked Katie to join him to help look for the girl. Under no circumstances was Katie to tell Jack and Janet that Liberty was missing. Jack and Janet overheard Katie's part of the conversation, however, and soon guessed what had happened. The three of them drove to Jack's house to quiz Parker but found him gone, as well. They started for the cabin.\n\n\nMeg began her consultation with Dr. Michaels, but Sofie's apparition joined them. Meg admitted to the doctor that she was stressed because of the recent shooting but protested that she did not need treatment. Dr. Michaels went out to confer with Paul, and she suggested they admit Meg to the hospital for observation immediately. Paul resisted and volunteered to watch Meg closely at home. Reluctantly, Dr. Michaels gave Paul a prescription for a sedative and her private phone number.\n\n\nPaul took Meg home and offered her a glass of water. Sofie suddenly appeared to Meg and warned her that the water was poisoned. Meg knocked the glass out of Paul's hand.\n\n\nJanet, Jack, and Katie arrived at the cabin, much to Brad's dismay. He asked Katie what part of \"come alone\" she hadn't understood. Brad soon realized that Parker was also involved with his daughter in the scheme. Jack received a phone call from the state police telling him where Brad's car had been spotted. They drove to the location but found the car empty.\n\n\nThe two teens, who had abandoned the car to picnic in the woods, discussed their options. Parker was concerned that Jack, being a police officer, had access to other police forces and the state police. They tried to make plans for living on the road, but Liberty introduced a dose of reality when she reminded Parker that they were young and still in high school. It was a lame idea, she said, to hit the open road. She started back to the car, but Parker refused to go.\n\n\nPaul could not figure out why Meg was acting so strangely. She complained that she was tired and went back to bed. Paul called Dr. Michaels' private number for advice. Sofie appeared again to Meg and continued her lies about Paul, who soon appeared with the sedative the doctor had prescribed. Meg pretended to swallow the medication but spit it out as soon as Paul left the room. Sofie urged Meg to get Paul's gun out of the safe for her own protection.\n\n\nLiberty returned to the car without Parker, but Jack soon found the boy. Parker was disgusted with Liberty for siding with the adults. Brad refused to allow Liberty to ride back in the same car with Parker, so Jack told Parker he was riding with him. Parker was still angry with Liberty.\n\n\nPaul talked again with Dr. Michaels, and she agreed that she would see Meg again the next day. Meg went to the safe and opened it, taking out Paul's gun. Paul went to her bedroom, but Meg was already back in bed with the revolver hidden under the covers. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie tells Jack and Janet that Brad and Liberty are getting along from what she saw on her secret mission to the cabin; she thinks this will be met with relief and happiness, but instead Janet is angry with Katie that she went without her; she also feels they are judging how she is as a mother to Liberty. Brad and Liberty bond some more after he gives her driving lessons. Parker shows up at Liberty and Brad's cabin wanting her to run away with him. Liberty is unsure, but Parker convinces her that her dad is only appeasing her for the time being, but nothing will change afterwards. Meg continues to be plagued by visions of Sophie's \u0091ghost' telling her to kill Paul. Paul makes an appointment with Dr. Michaels for Meg, who begrudgingly goes. Jack and Katie are able to calm Janet down and they all try to get along. While Parker hides, Liberty tests Brad to see how he will treat her. When she doesn't like his responses, she agrees to leave with Parker in Brad's car when Brad walks to the store. Meg sees Sophie's \u0091ghost' while she is talking with Dr. Michaels so Dr. Michaels tells Paul that Meg needs to be hospitalized. Paul declines promising her that he can take care of Meg better at home. Brad realizes Liberty is gone and calls Katie, but since Jack and Janet are with her, they learn about Liberty's vanishing act too, so they anxiously join Katie on her road trip to the Lake \u0096 especially when they realize Parker is gone too. Liberty and Parker's life on the run ends as quickly as it starts when Liberty comes to her senses and realizes they can't go on the run with less then $50. Parker still wants to go, but Liberty tells him that she is heading back. Sophie's \u0091ghost' convinces Meg that Paul is trying to drive her crazy so she winds up in a sanitarium the rest of her life. Meg becomes more unstable and paranoid, as she pretends to take the sedative pills Paul gives her. Paul calls Dr. Michaels and tells her that he now believes Meg needs more help then he can give her, which Meg overhears. Even though Janet is furious with Brad, they and Jack and Katie work together to find Liberty and Parker, which they do soon afterwards. Parker is angry at Liberty. Brad still wants to keep Liberty and Parker apart \u0096 even in the car ride home. After giving into what Sophie's \u0091ghost' suggests that she needs to do in order to save herself, Meg takes Paul's gun out of the safe and hides it from him under her pillow.",
