He asked her to go with him, and Alison coyly inquired if Casey was asking her out on a date.  She accepted, and they made plans to meet later at the restaurant.  After Alison left, Casey went out into the hall and ran into Chris.  His uncle told him that Tom and Margo had invited him, along with Katie and Jacob, to share the Hughes cabin with them for the weekend.  Casey teased Chris about \"bonding\" with Katie, but Chris made it clear that Katie had nixed that idea.\n\n\nAt home, Katie discussed with little Jacob how \"chicken\" she was about doing a Hughes family activity.  She wished she had someone to talk with about her dilemma, but she told the baby that \"Uncle Henry\" was busy at the moment \"hearing voices.\"  In actuality, Henry was dressed in his maid's uniform and standing guard outside Barbara Ryan's suite in the Lakeview.  His womanly undergarments were giving him fits, and he swore that he should have worn his other bra.  He answered his phone, and it was Katie, wanting advice.  Henry said he couldn't talk because he was on a stakeout, so Katie called him \"Nancy Drew.\"  Henry said no matter what it took, he was going to save Barbara.\n\n\nChris knocked on Katie's door and said that he was headed to Al's to pick up some food.  If Katie wanted to, she could meet him there at the diner and ride up to the cabin with him.  Instead of continuing to talk, Chris grabbed Katie and kissed her.  He pulled away and left, as Katie held her baby and wondered aloud what she should do.  Her phone rang, and the caller was Margo, who said she had to cancel the weekend because both she and Tom had to appear in court the next day.  Katie thought a minute and then called Alison and asked for a big favor.\n\n\nAt Al's, a dejected Chris waited to see if Katie would show up.  He was disappointed when he had his food, and it was time to leave.  He walked outside, where Katie surprised him by asking if he was ready to go.  Chris asked about Jacob, and Katie said that Alison was watching him for the weekend.  She failed to mention however, that Tom and Margo had cancelled.  They loaded the food and took off for the cabin.\n\n\nWhen Chris and Katie walked into the cabin, he was surprised that Tom and Margo weren't there ahead of them.  He called out, but no one answered, so he pulled out his phone to give them a call.  Katie discouraged that, and Chris got suspicious and asked if there was something she wasn't telling him.  Katie finally admitted that the other Hughes family members would not be joining them.  Chris was touched that Katie had chosen to be alone with him, and he commented on the fact that she was no longer wearing her wedding ring.    Katie excused herself and went alone into a bedroom.\n\n\nChris used the time alone to light as many candles as he could find.  When Katie returned, she took off her shirt and stood there in her red bra.  She said she had no second thoughts and that everything felt \"very right.\"  Chris and Katie kissed and then dropped to the floor in front of the fireplace.  They continued to kiss until suddenly Chris appeared uncomfortable and clutched at his chest.  They sat up, but Chris had difficulty breathing and soon could not speak.\n\n\nIn the party warehouse, Iris crowed about the photo of her \"family\" on her phone, as Barbara refused to believe that Iris was close to Barbara's sons.  Then Iris dropped the bomb that she was even living in \"the old family homestead with the whole lot of them.\"  She bragged that Barbara's kids had \"rolled out the welcome mat\" for her at Fairwinds less than half an hour before.  Barbara countered that there was no one in Oakdale who could stand the sight of Iris, but Iris twisted the knife by saying how Barbara's two little granddaughters would still have a grandma to love after Barbara was gone.  Then Iris claimed she only did \"good works\" since she had repented, and then she asked again for the passwords to Barbara's financial accounts.\n\n\nIris promised that if Barbara gave her the passwords, and eventually the money, Iris would be on the next plane to Tahiti.  Barbara fiddled with Iris' phone, trying to dial for help, but Iris snatched the phone from her.  Barbara asked what guarantee Iris could give her that she would release Barbara if Barbara gave Iris what she wanted, but Iris said Barbara just had to trust her.  Barbara told Iris to forget it, and then she proposed a counter offer: a whopping fat check that would keep Iris happy for many years.  Iris asked where Barbara's checkbook was, and she didn't notice that Barbara palmed a pen from a shelf and slipped it into Iris' purse.  Barbara told Iris that she kept her checkbook in a strongbox that she had concealed in the fireplace in her hotel suite.  Iris was not happy, but she grumbled, \"Fine,\" and left.\n\n\nAlison showed up at Casey's house with Jacob in her arms.  She explained that she was watching the baby for a couple of days as a favor to Katie, and Casey was cool with that.  He said it would be fun to have a \"rent a baby\" for the weekend.  Jacob, however, soon began to wail, and even Casey could not jolly him out of it.  Alison explained that no one could talk a baby out of a tantrum, but Casey kept trying until he, too, was frustrated.  He declared he couldn't do that for two days, so a laughing Alison said she would call for reinforcements.\n\n\nPaul and a recently returned Emily were joking around in the living room at Fairwinds when Will and Gwen arrived and welcomed her home.  Will asked how Emily had taken \"the news,\" but Paul just shook his head in warning.  Emily caught on and demanded to know what was going on, so Paul told her that Iris was staying at Fairwinds, as well.  Emily shouted, \"What the hell?\" and went off on a tirade about how she would rather have Dracula or the Bride of Frankenstein in her house than Iris.  She yelled that no way should they have to put up with a \"she-wolf,\" even if she was Gwen's mother.  \n\n\nGwen couldn't deal with Emily's comments, so started for the door to get some air.  Her phone rang, and she took a call from Alison asking Will, Gwen, and especially Hallie, to a barbecue at Casey's.  Will jumped at the chance to get away from Fairwinds, so they grabbed Hallie and took off, while Emily continued to rant at her husband. She shouted that she did not want Eliza anywhere near Iris, but Paul said he still owned Gwen, \"big time.\"  Emily groused that guilt should have a statute of limitations, but she began to calm down after Paul kissed her.\n\n\nHenry fussed around his housekeeping cart and griped that he had not worn his other bra.  He left his cart to go somewhere more private to rearrange his \"woman parts,\" just as Iris appeared in the hall.  She used a key card to enter Barbara's suite and had no difficulty locating the strongbox hidden in the fireplace.  The box was locked, and Iris had no luck finding a key, so she began looking through her purse for some sort of tool.  She found the pen that Barbara had dropped in her purse in the warehouse, and she used it to jimmy the lock on the box.  She dropped the pen on the floor and grabbed Barbara's checkbook.  She put the strongbox on a table and used some of Barbara's perfume before she left.\n\n\nIris made her escape before Henry returned, but he got a whiff of Barbara's perfume.  He said her name out loud, and then he used a passkey to enter the suite.  No one was there, and Henry was so uncomfortable that he pulled his bra off and out the front of his uniform.  Then he spotted the strongbox on the table.\n\n\nWill and Gwen arrived at Casey's with Hallie, and the boys went outside to do \"man stuff,\" such as grilling the meat.  Gwen and Ali talked about relationships, and Gwen asked her friend about her attraction to Mick Dante that had foiled her wedding to Casey.  Alison answered truthfully that she did not know what the attraction was.  Will answered his phone and learned from Henry that he had been staking out Barbara's room and had made \"another sighting.\"  Will said he would be right there, and he excused himself from the barbecue.\n\n\nWill walked into his mother's suite but did not recognize Henry from the back in his maid's uniform and blonde wig.  When he commented on the outfit, Henry said, \"Stakeouts are not for the squeamish.\"  Henry said he had smelled Barbara's perfume in the hall, so he had gone into the room and found that someone had broken the lock on Barbara's strongbox and then abandoned it on a table.  \n\n\nWill was not convinced that constituted proof, but Henry was sure it could not be good.  Then Henry looked down and noticed the pen on the floor that Iris had used on the lock.  He picked it up and read, \"The Party Warehouse.\"  He and Will located the warehouse and broke in, but there was no one there.  Henry felt Barbara's presence, however, and he began to tear the place apart.\n\n\nIris returned to Fairwinds and saw that Emily had returned.  \"Emmy!\" she shouted, \"you're home!\"  Paul made a hasty exit and left Emily to deal with Iris.  Iris began talking about her redemption and \"walking into the light,\" so Emily asked if there was any chance that Iris would be \"walking into the light\" any time soon.  Emily said they needed to set some ground rules for living at Fairwinds, and Iris agreed and presented Emily a list of the things she would need to make her stay more comfortable.  The list included flavored coffee creamer, scented bath salts, and a comfy mattress topper.\n\n\nEmily fixed herself a stiff drink as Iris quoted that \"demon rum\" gave only a moment's pleasure.  Then Iris began reading her positive thinking book while Emily drank and looked daggers at her guest.  Paul returned, and Iris began complimenting him until she got to the tag line.  She said that if two sociopaths like them could make a successful life, anybody could.  Iris went to her room, and Emily headed to the bar for another refill.\n\n\nIris, however, headed not to her room but down to the wine cellar where she picked out an expensive vintage.  Her claims of being \"on the wagon\" had been greatly exaggerated, so she was opening the bottle when she heard footsteps.  Iris ducked behind some shelves as Emily entered to get herself another bottle of brandy.  She selected one and walked out, and Iris breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\nEmily toasted Paul in the living room, while Iris began sipping on her wine in the cellar.  Iris said aloud that she would be happy to share, but it was way too good for the likes of Barbara.  Iris had stuffed a terrified, bound, and gagged Barbara between a wine rack and the stone foundation of the wine cellar.\n\n\n",
