At Carly's house, Jack got a visit from Brad, who wanted Jack to keep Parker away from Liberty. Jack agreed the kids needed to be apart from one another, but he felt both families needed to work together to figure out a good answer. As the brothers worked on a solution, the doorbell rang, and Jack opened the door to find Janet with a peace offering.\n\n\nOnce she saw Brad, Janet began to yell that he should not be talking to Jack about Liberty behind her back. Brad accused Janet of being too lenient with Liberty and even said Janet had set a bad example for Liberty by sleeping with Jack. Janet did not take kindly to Brad's accusations, but Jack had heard enough and told Brad and Janet to stop arguing about the past and focus on ending Parker and Liberty's sexual relationship. Brad and Janet agreed that they needed to work together to protect the kids.\n\n\nLiberty woke to find Katie waiting for her in the kitchen of their home. Katie tried to explain to Liberty why everyone was so upset by her and Parker running away together. Liberty insisted that leaving had been all Parker's idea and she should not be grounded for going along with him. Liberty soon noticed that Brad was not at home and asked Katie where he had gone. Katie explained that Brad was with Jack, trying to figure out how to keep her and Parker apart until they could be trusted again. Liberty was not surprised. Katie said Liberty needed to go with her to work.\n\n\nLiberty went with Katie to the station, and once they were there, she worked with Katie to pick out designs for a segment on teen fashion for the show. As Liberty looked over the pictures, Katie talked to Liberty about the trouble with Parker. Liberty admitted things with Parker were not ideal, and Katie was pleased to hear what Liberty had to say. Moments later, Brad phoned and asked Katie to take Liberty to Carly's house so he could lay down the law.\n\n\nKatie arrived with Liberty, and once Parker entered the room, Jack, Brad, and Janet explained to the teens that they would not be alone together anymore. Parker immediately dismissed the idea, but Jack told him the new rules were not open for discussion. To everyone's surprise, especially Parker's, Liberty agreed without any arguing. Parker had heard enough and stormed out of the house.\n\n\nAfter the discussion was over, Brad and Katie dropped Liberty off at school, and when Parker saw Liberty alone, he rushed to talk to her. Parker asked Liberty if she'd meant what she'd said about staying away from him, and Liberty said she thought it was best to listen to their parents for a while and do what they asked. Parker could not contain himself and blurted out that he loved Liberty and could not be apart from her. As soon as the words left his mouth, Parker realized he had said too much. Liberty began to walk away, and Parker said he would call her later. Liberty told him she thought it was best if he did not call.\n\n\nA thoroughly devastated Parker returned home, where his father greeted him. Jack said that he had just heard from a tennis program in Chicago, and Parker had been accepted. Jack said he knew Parker did not want to go, but Parker shocked his dad when he said he would go. However, Jack looked concerned when Parker said he had nothing keeping him in Oakdale.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison jolted awake and told Aaron she was having trouble breathing. Aaron ran to the hall and called for a doctor. Chris entered to help Alison, and Aaron angrily insisted he get out. Aaron took a nurse into Alison's room and demanded that Chris be taken off Alison's case. The nurse confirmed that Chris was Alison's attending physician, and there was nothing the nurse could do to change that. Aaron decided to find Bob and have him remove Chris from Alison's case.\n\n\nWhile Aaron searched for Bob, Chris continued to work on Alison, and as she languished in her altered state, he pleaded with her to stay awake. Chris was determined to run more tests on Alison, but as he stuck the needle in her arm, she suddenly woke up and ripped the needle out, plunging it into Chris's shoulder. As Aaron returned to the room with Bob, Alison screamed that Chris was trying to drug her. The nurse said Chris was only drawing blood for a test, and Chris pleaded with his father to let him continue his examination of Alison. Bob had heard enough of the two men arguing and sent them to the hall so he could check Alison on his own.\n\n\nAfter he gave Alison a physical, Bob told both Chris and Aaron that Alison was resting comfortably, but she could not get that agitated again. Aaron said Chris was the one who had made Alison act out, and Bob agreed that Chris should keep his distance. Chris said he would work in the lab but would not give up on Alison's case.\n\n\nDetermined to help Alison, Chris went to work in the lab. Bob took him a sample of Alison's blood and encouraged Chris to find a cure but not make himself ill again. Soon, Chris began to have symptoms, but did his best to hide them from the other doctors and nurses around him. Chris realized he was getting sick and went to Alison's room to tell her he was also ill.\n\n\nAaron saw Chris next to Alison's bed and told him to get away from her. With a psychotic look in his eyes, Chris began choking Aaron, but Bob saw what was happening and was able to give Chris a sedative. Aaron demanded that Bob get Chris locked up, but Bob explained that Chris had to be infected with the same thing that was making Alison sick. Bob worried that Chris was their best chance of finding out what was wrong with everyone and was concerned that they were facing an epidemic.\n\n\nDown the hall, Susan comforted Emily and told her that she seemed to be doing better. Susan let Emily know that Alison had also been admitted to the hospital and had the same symptoms as her sister. Emily asked how Alison was recovering, and Susan said she hoped Alison would recover just like Emily had. As they were discussing Emily's crazy behavior, Casey arrived with flowers and demanded to see his wife. Susan left the two alone to talk, but she warned Casey not to cause Emily any stress.\n\n\nAlone in her hospital room, Emily apologized to Casey for pressuring him into marrying her and for her bizarre behavior that had followed the ceremony. Casey explained how concerned he had been for Emily and that he did not want to lose her. Emily said their marriage had taken place too quickly and was not the right thing for either of them. Casey refused to listen and told Emily he was not going anywhere.\n\n\nWhen Susan returned to check on her daughter, Emily told her mother she was leaving the hospital. Susan handed Emily a bag filled with magazines she had for her and the other vial of perfume that Emily had given her. Susan explained she seemed to be allergic to the perfume but did not want it to go to waste. She returned the bottle to Emily, not knowing the perfume was what was making Emily so sick. With Casey out of the room, Emily confessed to her mother that she knew she had to break things off with Casey.\n\n\nOnce Emily was released from the hospital, Casey took Emily back to her office and asked her if she was well enough to be back at work. Emily insisted she was fine but was tired of the smell of the hospital. She spritzed herself with the perfume and sat down. Casey wanted to talk to Emily about not ending their marriage, but the perfume was already affecting Emily. She grabbed Casey from across the desk and told him she wanted him. Casey did not understand Emily's sudden desire, but Emily did not want to talk and took off her clothes.\n\n\nEmily demanded that Casey lock the door and make love to her immediately. After they were done having sex, Emily told Casey to get dressed because she was ready to show him off and make sure everyone knew they were a couple. Casey was not sure it would be a good idea to rub their love in his family's face, but Emily was clear that it was all or nothing. As the two set out to confront Tom and Margo, Casey noticed that Emily looked strange. He insisted that Emily let him take her back to the hospital, and she reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nOnce Casey got Emily to the hospital, Casey also began to feel sick. Susan entered the room to check on Emily and asked Casey to go outside. As Casey stood to leave, he had to lean against the wall for support. Susan turned and asked Casey if he was all right, but Casey was obviously not himself and began screaming at Susan to get out. He kicked Susan out of the room and demanded that she get Emily another doctor.\n\n\nCasey tried to block the door with equipment to keep everyone out of the room, but Susan had security break into the room and restrain Casey. Once inside, Susan found Emily passed out and unresponsive. Susan did not understand what was making everyone act so strangely and why both her daughters were so sick. \n\n\n",
