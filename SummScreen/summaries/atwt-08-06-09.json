    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLooking puzzled, Dr. Bob walked out of an exam room in Memorial Hospital and stopped.  Alison approached him and asked if she could help him in any way.  Bob was short with her and told her that if he needed her help, he would ask for it.  Then he called her \"Susan.\"  Alison corrected him that she was Alison, and Bob said that of course she was, and to keep up her good work.  Alison found Casey elsewhere in the hospital and hesitantly relayed her latest weird moment with his grandfather.\n\n\nCasey chalked his grandfather's remarks up to the man's strange sense of humor again, but Alison was afraid that something was going on that was no laughing matter.  The recent incident was the second she had observed with Bob, and it could be a symptom of a serious condition.  She suggested that she talk with Kim about it, but Casey nixed that and substituted Tom instead.  He and Alison took off to the Lakeview where Casey knew his father had a meeting.\n\n\nMargo made a list of groceries, while Riley talked about Tom and referred to him as \"Dad.\"  Riley seemed lethargic, and he dozed off on the couch, but Margo was able to rouse him, although he admitted he was feeling \"a bit off.\"  Margo was worried that he might have a serious strain of flu, so she felt his forehead and declared that he was burning up with fever.  Tom walked through the room, and Margo asked him to get their thermometer, but he declined.  He said cynically that Margo's \"hands on\" method looked as if it was working, and he walked out the door.\n\n\nMargo continued to fuss over Riley, who felt that Tom was obviously still jealous about his wife's attention to him.  Margo was upset for Tom, as well, but she was more concerned about getting Riley to see a doctor.  Riley said that he would take care of himself, and he convinced Margo to go to work.  After she left, he felt even more ill, so he called a cab to take him to Memorial.\n\n\nBarbara visited Paul, who referred to her as \"Ms. Ryan.\"  She requested that he call her \"Mom,\" but Paul did not remember her that way and felt uncomfortable using that appellation.  Paul was packing many of his art objects, most of which were gift from his mother, into cartons.  Barbara picked out one in particular and told Paul that it had cost a great deal of money.  Paul shrugged and said, \"It's ugly,\" and put it back in the box.  Barbara started in on him about having the procedure on his brain that might restore his memory, but Paul reiterated that he did not want to be \"that guy\" again.\n\n\nThen Paul stunned his mother by telling her that he was also giving away most of his money.  Barbara tried to talk him out doing anything foolish with his funds, but Paul said that he had given most of it to Meg for her baby.  Barbara reminded him that Meg's baby was also his daughter, and that it probably was all right for Eliza to have a nest egg.  Then Paul said that he was using the rest to buy a newspaper for a friend, and when Barbara found out the friend was Emily Stewart, she shouted \"The blonde barracuda?\" \n\n\n\n\nBarbara threatened to stop Paul immediately, and she picked up the phone to call their banker.  Paul said that he had already talked to him.  Then Barbara dragged up the story of how Emily had shot Paul in the back, shoved him over a cliff, and left him for dead.  She pointed her finger at her son and reminded him that she was his mother and would not allow him to get back into the clutches of a woman determined to ruin his life.\n\n\nEmily went looking for Hunter and ran into him at Java.  She said that she had tremendous news and that Hunter was looking at the new publisher of a brand new print and online newspaper.  She said that an old friend was bankrolling the whole deal, but Hunter only wished her luck.  Emily offered him the job of editor of the cyber version, but her newfound son turned her down.  He said that Emily should not have offered him a job because she felt she owed him something, and also, she could not buy his affections with a paycheck.\n\n\nEmily swore that she was not trying to \"mother or smother\" him, but she wanted him on her staff because he was brilliant at his work.  Hunter still refused, and Emily declared him stubborn, just like her.  Hunter said he already had a job, and he tied on an apron from Java and took two orders for apple pie.  Emily was stunned that her son was working in the coffee shop.  Hunter cut a piece of pie and then clumsily knocked the pie stand to the floor.  His boss reminded him that he was already in the hole for cups he had broken earlier, so perhaps he should take the job the nice lady was offering him.\n\n\nHunter took off his apron, and Emily continued her pep talk.  Hunter was suspicious about where the financing was originating, but Emily assured him they had no worries there.  Hunter said before he made a decision, he wanted to meet the investor, so Emily dragged him to Fairwinds.  As soon as they walked in, Barbara attacked Emily for taking advantage of Paul's situation.  She accused Emily of using her wiles on Paul to get her way.  Paul denied all of that, and then he grinned and asked Emily to show him her \"wiles.\"\n\n\n\n\nEmily talked back to Barbara, and finally Hunter jumped in and defended his mother .  Barbara next called Emily a liar and a cheat, but Paul spoke up and told Barbara that if she continued to speak poorly about \"this lovely and talented woman,\" he would ask her to leave and never return.  Paul said the discussion was over, but Barbara got in one more dig about not letting \"the likes of Emily Stewart dig her claws\" into her son again.  Barbara got right in Paul's face and warned him not to push her.\n\n\nEmily told Paul that she had hired Hunter as their online editor, and, in the interest of full disclosure, he was her biological son.  Paul suggested that they use Fairwinds as the paper's home base, and he offered them each a suite of rooms for living quarters.  Both Emily and Hunter accepted, and Paul went to confer with his staff.  Hunter asked Emily if Paul was more than a \"friend,\" and Emily answered that she was a good newspaper woman, but \"not seven figures good.\"  She left him to draw his own conclusion, and he called her \"Mom\" for the first time.\n\n\nAlison and Casey approached Tom at the Lakeview.  Alison told him that she had noticed another episode that day at the hospital in which Dr. Bob had become disoriented.  She also spoke about the time at Casey's party when Bob had called Kim \"Lisa.\"  Tom was not very concerned and cited how sharp his dad was when they played golf.  He felt there was no cause for alarm, but he did ask Alison to keep an eye on the situation.  Alison felt no better, however, and she and Casey returned to the hospital and she went back on duty.\n\n\nAlison was surprised to find that Riley was one of her new patients, and he seemed in quite a bit of distress, so she sent for Dr. Bob.  Bob arrived and checked Riley's chart and listened to his lungs.  He prescribed 50 milligrams of the drug ventricill, but Alison looked alarmed and questioned the dosage.  Bob snapped back at her and ordered her to get and administer it.  Alison left the room and took the time in the hall to call her mother for advice.  Susan did not answer, however, so she left a message.  Bob exited Riley's room and scolded Alison for making a call while she was on duty and for questioning his judgment.  He ordered her to get the drug and give it to Riley.\n\n\nAlison pushed the drug into Riley's IV, but the young man almost immediately began to have acute respiratory distress.  Bob ran in and asked what happened.  He could not understand why Riley had gone into respiratory failure, and he questioned Alison who reported that she had administered the requested 50 milligrams of ventricill.  Bob went ballistic and claimed that he had ordered five milligrams, not 50.  He prescribed a quick antidote but made another nurse get it, not Alison.\n\n\nAlison sat by Riley's bed until he awakened.  She apologized for giving him too much medication, but she said that Dr. Bob had ordered it.  Riley said no harm, no foul, and he told Alison to cut herself some slack.  He wanted to go home since he was feeling better, but Alison said he had to call someone to pick him up because he was so weak.  Riley called Margo who agreed to drive him home.  Alison helped Riley get dressed, and she saw scars on his torso from the bombing in Afghanistan.  Casey walked in as she was buttoning Riley's shirt.\n\n\nTom walked into the Oakdale Police Station to see a client in lock-up, and Margo was surprised to see him.  She asked to speak with him and took him into the interview room.  She spoke briefly about Riley, but Tom was not willing to have that conversation, so she switched to Adam.  She asked Tom that if Adam was alive if Tom would try to get the charges against their son dropped.  Tom said that a sentence reduction was about all they could hope for the charge of the attempted rape of Gwen Munson.  Tom said he also felt that it would not be fair to Casey, whom they let serve time for a lesser crime, if they gave Adam a pass.\n\n\nTom was perplexed by Margo's queries, and he told her that they frightened him.  He had hoped that she had gotten though some of her grieving for their son, but he suspected that she should seek some professional counseling for her own peace of mind.  Margo took a call then, and it was Riley's request for a ride home, so she cut off Tom and dashed out.\n\n\nMargo arrived at the hospital, and Alison suggested that she keep a close eye on Riley for a while.  Margo took him out, and Casey questioned Alison about what he had observed when he had walked into the room.  Alison said that she was upset about the mix-up in dosages for Riley's medication, but she was sure that she had heard Bob say 50 milligrams.  Casey asked if she was one hundred per cent sure that his grandfather had prescribed that much, but while Alison was sure, she said that she could not be positive. Casey suggested that she not report it, and they both worried about her future in nursing.\n\n\nBarbara asked Bob to meet her at the diner, and he was still upset about the incident with Alison.  He told her that Alison had challenged his judgment and then made a grave mistake in administering a drug.  He questioned her ability to become a reliable nurse, but Barbara said that she was not surprised because Alison was a Stewart.  All Stewarts were walking disasters, as far as Barbara was concerned.  She told Bob that Emily had gotten her hooks back into Paul and explained that he was giving away all his money.  She needed to protect her son, and she asked for Bob's help to get Paul committed to the hospital.\n\n\nAt home, Margo continued to fuss over Riley.  He asked her to stop treating him like a son and to get a grip on her emotions.  Margo took Riley's face in her hands just as Tom walked through the door.  Margo left the room to get Riley a sweater, and Tom told the young man that as soon as he was back on his feet, Tom wanted him out of his house.  He said it was because Margo had turned Riley into a replacement for Adam, and that was unhealthy.  Tom made it very clear that Riley had to leave as soon as he was able.  Riley went to lie down.\n\n\nEmily, Hunter and Paul drank a toast to their new business venture.  Paul suggested that Hunter go check out his new digs, so the young man left them.  Emily thanked Paul for the newspaper and the opportunity to work with her son.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Allison is worried about Bob when he calls her Susan and then gets angry when she corrects his mistake telling her he would never call her Susan because her name is Alison. Margo poses a hypothetical situation to Tom and asks him if Adam were alive would he help get the charges against him dropped. Tom tells Margo he wouldn't do that because Adam committed worse crimes then Casey and since Casey went to jail he thinks its only right that Adam also pays for his crimes. Tom worries that Margo hasn't accepted Adam's death and suggests she get therapy but Margo tells Tom she doesn't need therapy. Allison tells Casey that she is worried about Bob and they both tell Tom about the episode but Tom tells her not to worry but if anything else happens to let him know. Riley has a fever so he goes to the hospital where Bob mistakenly tells Allison to give him a higher dose of medicine then he needs to treat Riley's flu. Allison questions the dosage but Bob gets angry and tells her to stop questioning him and do what she is told to do. Allison gives Riley thee dose and he goes into convulsions Bob is able to save him but when Allison tells him she followed his dosage order he tells her he told her to give Riley a much lower dose of medicine. Allison tells Casey about the incident but admits she isn't sure if she was the one who misunderstood Bob so Casey tells her not to report the incident to the hospital since she isn't sure of her facts so that it won't cause trouble for her or his grandfather. Allison apologizes to Riley who says it was an honest mistake and promises not to sue the hospital. Tom asks Riley to move out of the house when he feels better because having him around isn't helping Margo because she is using him to replace Adam. Barbara is angry when she discovers Paul gave money to Emily to start a newspaper and she vows to do anything she has to to protect Paul to stop Emily whom she calls \"the blonde barracuda\" from digging her claws into Paul again. Emily asks Hunter to be in charge of the online version of the newspaper while she will handle the print version of the newspaper. Hunter turns down Emily's offer at first because he thinks she either feels sorry for him or is trying to buy his affection. Hunter has no choice but to take the offer when he gets fired from Java for being clumsy and breaking too many cups and plates. Paul tells Emily she and Hunter can move into Fairwinds because he has a lot of room and they can also use the house as an office for the newspaper. Hunter wants to know Emily's relationship with Paul and she tells him their relationship is very personal and Hunter tells Emily he doesn't need to know that much information about his mom. Emily is pleased Hunter called her mom for the first time. Bob tells Barbara about the mistake Allison made at the hospital and questions if Alison can be a good nurse. Barbara asks Bob to help her have Paul committed again.",
