Will thought they should just accept Barbara's note at face value, but Henry located the clown, which had Barbara's lipstick all over it.\n\n\n       At home, Paul told Emily that Will and Gwen wouldn't let Iris stay if she were still drinking. Paul said Iris made Barbara look normal, and Emily promised to make peace with Barbara when she returned. Gwen entered, and Paul received a call from Henry, who explained that he'd found clues to Barbara's disappearance at a party warehouse. Paul ended the call and asked Emily and Gwen to stay with the kids while he checked out what his brothers had found.\n\n\n       Paul left, and Emily balked at being relegated to watch the kids. Gwen assumed that Paul had been referring to Iris. Emily guessed that Iris was praying upstairs, and Gwen remarked that she was starting to believe in Iris' \"higher power thing.\" Emily sympathized with Gwen, because Susan was an alcoholic. Gwen seemed optimistic about Iris' progress; however, Emily said that addicts usually replaced the alcohol with something else. Gwen said that being a mother had made her desire to reconnect with Iris. Emily warned Gwen that there was a fine line between supporting and enabling.\n\n\nA defensive Gwen went to check on the kids, but returned to say that Iris wasn't upstairs. Emily warily suggested that Iris might be in the wine cellar, but Gwen doubted that Iris would mess up like that when she had no other place to go. Gwen insisted that Iris had changed, and backing off, Emily suggested that Iris had gone to the garden. Gwen kept searching for Iris, and Emily decided that the wine cellar was a good place to hide the expensive alcohol.\n\n\nIn the wine cellar, Iris drank wine and told a bound and gagged Barbara that it was time to write the big, fat check. Barbara started coughing, and Iris reasoned that a dead Barbara wouldn't do her any good. Iris took off Barbara's gag, but when Barbara yelled, Iris stuffed it back in her mouth. Iris threatened to take drastic measures to shut Barbara up. \"And you are not going to like it one little bit,\" Iris warned.\n\n\n       Iris revealed that she knew about the pen that Barbara had planted on her, but it didn't matter, because the last place they'd look for Barbara was under Paul's nose. Iris said that it was time for Barbara to fork over her cash, and Iris guessed that Paul would eventually find Barbara down there. \"Or not,\" Iris quipped. Barbara mumbled a refusal, and Iris said that the warehouse and the musty cellar were nothing compared to where she'd take Barbara next.\n\n\n       Iris handed Barbara a checkbook and asked for $25,000 to start. When Iris stared at the check, Barbara jumped her from behind and punched her. As Barbara wrestled with the ropes around her ankles, Iris whipped out a paint gun. Barbara scoffed, but Iris shot her with it. The pain from the paint pellet knocked Barbara down, and Barbara seethed that Iris was really enjoying herself. \"You have no idea, lady!\" Iris cooed as she tightened Barbara's constraints.\n\n\n       Barbara warned that Will and Gwen would disown Iris once they learned what she'd done. Iris said that if she didn't get what she wanted, Barbara wouldn't be in any position to tell anyone anything. Barbara asserted that Iris didn't have the guts to kill her, and Iris shoved the gag back into Barbara's mouth. As Iris opened the door to leave, she almost bumped into Emily. \"Iris!\" Emily gasped and halted in her tracks.\n\n\n       At the warehouse, Paul met Will and Henry. Margo arrived at Henry's request, and he explained that the lipstick on the clown matched the lipstick on the tissue they'd found. \"Barbara was here, and she was making out with a clown?\" Margo asked. Henry insisted that Barbara was being held hostage, and he pleaded for Margo's help because he didn't know what clues to look for. Margo deduced that no crime had been committed, but Henry implored her to handle it like the kidnapping that it really was.\n\n\n       Margo reasoned that she had real crimes to investigate. As Henry persisted, Paul referred to the note that Barbara had left and suggested that they take Barbara at her word. Believing his gut feeling, Henry suggested that Margo spray the place with luminal. Margo agreed to do that and more once there was evidence of a crime. \"And what if you're too late?\" Henry asked.\n\n\n       Margo promised to find Barbara, if they ever discovered real evidence of foul play. Margo left, and Paul expressed his frustration with Henry's paranoia. Henry insisted that Barbara had been kidnapped, and he said that good criminals knew how to cover their tracks. Henry stared at the clown and decided that they had to think outside the box.\n\n\nHenry explained that terrible events left \"bad juju\" in the air. Paul called Henry a lunatic, but Henry offered to get a psychic involved to prove it. Will wondered where Henry would get a psychic, and Henry looked expectantly at Paul.\n\n\n       Paul claimed that he didn't have psychic abilities anymore, but Henry said that it didn't just go away. Henry urged Paul to say how he felt. \"Irritated,\" Paul responded, and he insisted that they leave him out of it. Henry decided to employ the psychic who'd gotten bad vibes about Vienna's baby. Paul mocked Henry, who said that Paul would eat his words.\n\n\nLater, Myra, the psychic, arrived. She asked that no one give her clues, because it would taint her reading. Paul looked skeptical, but Henry asked Paul and Will to give it a chance. Myra detected dark secrets, deception, struggles, and great pain. She hinted that the darkest secret was inside the clown doll on the floor.\n\n\n       At the cabin, Chris tried to convince Katie that he was merely having a panic attack, but Katie doubted that being with her made him that nervous. He tried to get up, but fainted. When she revived him, he insisted that he was fine. Katie attempted to call for an ambulance, but he said he'd refuse treatment, because he didn't trust \"rinky-dink\" hospitals. She helped him to the car and threatened to take him to a \"rinky-dink\" hospital if he passed out again.\n\n\n       At Memorial later, a clammy Chris searched an exam room for nausea medicine. Katie tried to leave to find him a doctor, but he insisted that he probably just had indigestion, the flu, or low blood sugar. She wondered which one it was, and Chris joked that she could examine him for herself. He said he didn't want another doctor to see him off his game, and he didn't want his parents to be worried for nothing. Katie left to get him some juice for his low blood sugar.\n\n\n       While Reid made his rounds, he overhead two nurses talking about quitting if he took over the hospital. \"Why wait?\" he asked, and they awkwardly scurried off. He saw Katie skirting out of an exam room, but the nearby nurse didn't know why Katie was there.\n\n\nReid entered the exam room to see Chris drawing his own blood. Chris claimed that it wasn't a big deal, but Reid assumed that Chris didn't want people to know that he was sick, because he feared he wouldn't get the chief of staff job. Reid assured Chris that he wouldn't get the job because he wasn't good enough, not because he was sick.\n\n\nLater, Reid saw Chris give an anonymous blood sample to a nurse. The nurse left the sample and Chris's instructions at her station. Reid glanced at the list of tests that Chris had requested the lab to run on the sample.\n\n\nKatie called Margo to discuss what had transpired with Chris. Margo offered to call Bob, but Katie replied that Chris would flip out if they did that. Later, Margo met Katie in an exam room, where Katie explained that she'd sort of tricked Chris into going to the cabin alone with her. Margo noted that Katie wasn't wearing her wedding ring. Katie said she'd been sad, but it'd been time to remove it. Katie explained that while she and Chris had been kissing, he'd grabbed his chest. She worried that she'd caused Chris's \"attack.\" Margo figured that Chris had just gotten sick, and Katie shouldn't look for trouble where there was none.\n\n\nKatie and Margo went to Chris's exam room, and Reid listened outside the door as Chris claimed that he'd just had acid reflux. Margo left, and Chris asked Katie for a rain check on their weekend. She agreed and then joined Margo in the corridor. Margo implored her sister not to read anything into Chris's illness; Chris had merely gotten a gas bubble at an inappropriate time. Katie agreed that her \"future new boyfriend\" had just gotten a little sick. Margo cooed at Chris's new title, and dragging Katie off, Margo insisted upon hearing everything about the romance.\n\n\nReid reentered Chris's exam room. He asked why Chris had told Katie that he had a routine stomach disorder, but was testing himself for an obscure, tropical virus. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Katie worries about Chris when he passes out after his chest pains and after she revives him they go to memorial to have him checked out. Chris downplays his condition to Katie telling her it is jus low blood sugar or acid reflux. Katie tells Margo that she is ready to move on with Chris calling him her future new boyfriend. Reid is concerned about Katie so he goes into the exam room and finds Chris drawing his own blood and wonders why Chris won't allow a doctor to examine him. Reid suspects that Chris is worried that if anyone finds out he is sick they won't consider him for the chief of staff position. Chris doesn't deny Reid's suspicions and Chris orders a series of tests on his blood and puts a rush on the order. Reid peaks at the tests Chris ordered and asks Chris why he ordered his blood be tested for a rare tropical disease. Henry finds Barbara's shade of Lipstick on Chuckles the clown and pleads with Margo to search the warehouse for more evidence but Margo doesn't believe him and neither do Paul and Will. Henry calls a psychic for help who tells him that there is a spirit of sorrow and pain in the warehouse. Barbara writes a check to Iris and almost escapes the wine cellar, but Iris stops Barbara from leaving by shooting her with a paint ball gun. Emily tries to persuade Gwen that Iris is drinking again, but Gwen is determined to believe that Iris has changed and isn't drinking anymore. Emily finds another bottle of wine missing from the bar and heads down to the wine cellar where she is surprised to find Iris.",
