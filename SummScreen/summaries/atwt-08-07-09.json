    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLuke dropped by Java to let Noah know that he was going on a trip to New York with Damian to show some cruise line people a new ship the Grimaldi Shipping company had. Noah was surprised to hear about Luke's plans, because Noah knew that Luke had originally planned to accompany Holden to a horse show in Kentucky. When Noah asked how Holden felt about Luke's change of plans, Luke admitted that he hadn't actually told his dad yet.\n\n\nNoah told Luke that he thought it was a bad idea to blow Holden off in favor of going on a trip with Damian. Luke pointed out that Noah had been the one who had encouraged Luke to get to know Damian when Damian first returned to Oakdale, but Noah protested that he hadn't meant that Luke should put Damian ahead of Holden. Luke said that he would never do that, but Noah thought that Holden might feel that way about Luke's decision.\n\n\nLuke said that he didn't have a choice, since he worked for Damian, but Noah told Luke that he could have told Damian that he already had plans with Holden. Luke insisted that Holden would understand. Noah said it sounded as though Luke had made up his mind, and Luke said he had.\n\n\nMason walked in, and Luke excused himself, telling Noah he had to leave. Mason asked Noah if he had interrupted something, but Noah said that he and Luke had finished their discussion. Noah explained the situation to Mason, and Mason commented about how different Luke's two fathers were. Noah said that he couldn't choose sides, because when he did, Luke would choose the other side, and then they would end up arguing, when the argument wasn't even about them. Mason told Noah that in a relationship, one person couldn't fight the other person's battles for him.\n\n\nHolden walked into the kitchen at the Snyder farm and found Lily there waiting to talk to Emma. Lily told Holden that she was jealous that Luke was going with him to Kentucky and would get to spend time alone with him, but Holden assured Lily that she wouldn't want to spend time alone with a guy who smelled the way he did. Lily hugged Holden and reminded him that she'd fallen in love with the stable boy, and she said it was the best decision of her life.\n\n\nEmma walked into the kitchen and smiled at the sight of Lily and Holden kissing. Lily asked Emma if she could watch Ethan for a couple of hours the next day, because Lily had an all-day meeting to attend. Emma said she wished she could, but her ankle was bothering her. Holden asked what was wrong, and Emma reminded him that she had fallen a few days earlier. She said her ankle flared up every now and then and made it difficult for her to get around. In addition, she told them that she would be watching Eliza and wasn't sure she could manage both children.\n\n\nLily asked where Meg was going to be, and Emma was surprised that Lily and Holden didn't know that Meg was going on a cruise with Damian. She told them the cruise was apparently an effort to sell a luxury yacht to some businessmen. Emma left the room to check on Eliza, and Lily told Holden that she thought it was odd that Meg would be going on a sales cruise with Damian when Meg's job dealt with pharmaceuticals. Holden asked why Lily was so concerned about it, and Lily responded that she wasn't.\n\n\nEmma returned to the kitchen, and Holden told her that he needed to leave to start packing. Holden hugged his mother and left, but Lily stayed to talk to Emma. Lily asked Emma what she thought about Meg's involvement with Damian. Emma admitted that she didn't like the idea, but she reminded Lily that Meg was a grown woman with a strong mind of her own. Lily said that she knew the idea of Meg with Damian really bothered Holden; Emma said it bothered her, too, but there wasn't anything she could do about it. Lily replied, \"Maybe there is.\"\n\n\nMeg visited Damian in his office at Grimaldi Shipping. Damian told her to be sure to pack her swimsuit for the cruise. When Meg said she thought it was a business trip, Damian said it was, but it was also a midsummer cruise with time for sunbathing and swimming. Meg asked if Damian had told Luke to pack his swimsuit, too, and he said that he had, because business deals also sometimes happened by the pool. When Meg asked why she was going on the cruise, Damian replied that if she didn't, he would miss her too much. Meg reminded him that Luke was her nephew, so she would have to be on her best behavior. Damian informed Meg that he had made sure that Luke's stateroom was on the other side of the ship from his own.\n\n\nDamian gave Meg a wrapped box and told her to open it. She did, and she chirped happily when she saw the beautiful blue shawl that was inside. Damian told her it might come in handy on their cruise, because it could get chilly at night. Meg told Damian she had thought he could keep her warm but that she had the perfect dress to wear with it; Damian replied that he had hoped she might wear it with nothing else. Meg laughed and said she had to pack her things. She told Damian not to leave without her, and he responded, \"I won't, not without you --- ever.\"\n\n\nMeg went to the farm and showed Emma the gift Damian had given her. She asked if Emma would be okay watching Eliza for a little while longer so that Meg could shop at Fashions, but Emma said no. Emma explained that her ankle was giving her trouble off and on, and she didn't think she would be able to watch Eliza for the length of time that Meg needed while Meg was on the cruise with Damian. Meg was surprised to hear that.\n\n\nMeg asked her mother to explain why she was really saying no, and Emma admitted that she thought Meg was getting too involved with Damian too soon. Meg explained that she was going on a business trip, but Emma pointed to the shawl and asked why Damian was buying her such things for a business trip and when Meg had decided it was acceptable to sleep with her boss. Meg asked her mother where that was coming from, and Emma said she was worried because it was Damian.\n\n\nMeg argued that Damian had changed and was no longer the same person he'd been when he had done bad things. Emma answered that it wasn't so much what Damian had done as who he had done it to, because he had hurt Lily, Holden, and Luke. Meg said it sounded as though Emma's objections to watching Eliza had more to do with Damian than with Emma's ankle, but Emma said it was both things. Meg asked why Emma had suddenly decided it was such a big issue, and then it dawned on her that Emma's objections might have been prompted by Lily. Emma said it didn't make any difference where the idea had come from, but Meg said it made all the difference in the world, and she left.\n\n\nLuke went home and explained to Holden and Lily that he had to cancel his trip to Kentucky in order to take a cruise with Damian to sell a ship. Holden told Luke that he understood and that work came first. When Lily asked why Holden was being so understanding, Holden looked at her and said questioningly, \"Because I do understand?\" When Lily continued to act upset, Luke told her that he didn't have a choice, but Lily said, \"Yes, you do. And obviously, you've made it.\" Holden told Lily that was enough, and he told Luke to do what he needed to do, and they would take a trip another time. Luke thanked his father for understanding, and left.\n\n\nLily asked Holden why he had let Luke off so easily, and Holden replied that there hadn't been any point in trying to make Luke feel bad about work. Lily pointed out that the work was for Damian, and she asked Holden whether he was disappointed. Holden admitted he was, but he said he had to live with it. Lily replied, \"Not necessarily.\" Holden told Lily not to even think about calling Damian to ask him to let Luke out of the trip.\n\n\nLily said she thought that she and Holden should have let Luke know how disappointed they were with his choice. Holden explained that the last thing he wanted to do was make things a contest between himself and Damian, because that wouldn't be fair to Luke. Lily replied that Luke wasn't being fair to Holden, but Holden reminded Lily that she had promised not to interfere. Lily said she would keep her promise and would not try to change Luke's mind.\n\n\nMeg went to Grimaldi Shipping and told Damian what she thought Lily had done to interfere with Emma's agreement to babysit Eliza. When Damian asked if Meg was sure about Lily's involvement, Meg admitted that her mother hadn't actually said that was what had happened, but Meg believed that Lily had to be behind it. Damian asked whether Meg could find another babysitter, but Meg said she didn't trust anyone else with Eliza. Damian offered to call Lily to find out what had happened, but Meg said there was no point to that, because unless Emma agreed to babysit, Meg couldn't leave town. She wished Damian good luck on his business trip, and she left.\n\n\nLuke arrived at Grimaldi Shipping, and Damian told him that they needed to leave for New York soon. He noticed Luke's expression and asked what was wrong. Luke explained that he had just told Holden that he couldn't take a trip that they had planned. Damian asked when Luke was supposed to leave with Holden, and Luke said that same day. Damian said, \"You didn't tell me that.\" Luke explained that the trip with Holden was pleasure, whereas the trip with Damian was business, and that Holden had seemed to understand that, although Lily had had a problem with it.\n\n\nDamian told Luke that the trip seemed to be causing a lot of problems in Luke's family. Luke told Damian not to worry about it, but Damian said that he'd just heard from the shipyard, and the people there weren't sure the ship was ready to take out to sea. When Luke asked why, Damian replied that they had found a couple of minor glitches that needed to be fixed. Luke said he thought the decision not to take the ship out was more about Holden than about the boat. Damian told Luke, \"Trust me, this has nothing to do with you or your dad,\" and he walked out of the office.\n\n\nLuke went to Java, where Mason excused himself so that Luke and Noah could talk. Luke told Noah that the cruise had been cancelled, and Noah suggested that Luke find his father and let him know what had happened. Noah thought Luke should ask Holden if he could still accompany him to Kentucky.\n\n\nMeg went to the farm and told Emma that she would be happy to hear that Damian had cancelled the cruise. Emma said it must not have been very important, after all, but Meg insisted that it had been important and that it had been cancelled because of Emma and Lily. Emma told Meg not to blame Lily, but Meg said Lily was the one who had convinced Emma not to take care of Eliza.\n\n\nHolden walked in and asked the two women what they were fighting about. Emma explained about not being able to babysit Eliza, and Holden was surprised that Emma didn't feel up to taking care of the baby. Emma told Holden it didn't matter, then she told him to have a safe trip, and she left the room. Holden asked Meg if Damian was going on the trip without her, but Meg said the whole thing had been cancelled. When Holden asked why, Meg responded, \"Ask your wife.\"\n\n\nDamian went to see Lily at her house. He told her that he had cancelled the trip, and he asked her to admit that she had sabotaged Meg's babysitting arrangements because she still had feelings for him. Lily said that she had thought they were friends until Damian had started picking her family apart. Damian said that wasn't what he was doing, but Lily said it felt that way. Damian replied, \"Only because I'm not choosing you.\" Damian then told Lily that she couldn't hide from the truth, and neither could he, and he kissed her. Lily tried to fight him off at first but soon gave in and kissed Damian back.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Emily and Paul snuggled, and Paul told Emily that he was glad she was happy. Emily replied that if she'd known that losing his memory would make Paul act so wonderful, she would have blown him up herself. Emily got up to leave, telling Paul that she and Hunter had to meet with some Web site designers. Paul hugged Emily and whispered in her ear, telling her what he thought they could do after she got back from her meetings. Emily laughed and pulled away, telling Paul she had to leave.\n\n\nAfter Emily left, two men in white coats appeared in Paul's doorway and asked whether he was Paul Ryan. When he said yes, they asked him to accompany them. Paul stood up, and given the way the men were dressed, he asked if they were going to their ice cream truck. Barbara walked in and informed Paul that the men were there to take him to the hospital. Paul tried to shrug off the two men and told Barbara that she couldn't do that, but Barbara said she had every legal right to do it.\n\n\nBarbara and the two men took Paul to the hospital. Paul implored Barbara not to have him committed, saying he had a business to run. Barbara said the business was one sign that Paul wasn't acting responsibly, because he was throwing away his assets. Paul pointed out that he was an adult, so his assets were his to do with as he wished. Barbara told Paul that she only wanted what was best for him. Paul asked how she would know what that was, and Barbara replied, \"Because I'm your mother.\" Paul retorted, \"Well, from what I can see, that disqualifies you!\" Barbara told Paul that he had to talk to the doctor and that she had to leave but would return later.\n\n\nBarbara went to Fairwinds and found Emily there. When she suggested that Emily wait somewhere else for Paul, Emily informed Barbara that she was living at Fairwinds, at Paul's invitation. Barbara told Emily that her stay was about to be terminated, and Emily asked where Paul was. Barbara replied that he was \"somewhere safe,\" where he could fully recover and protect himself from people like Emily who wanted to take advantage of his \"weakened state.\" Barbara told Emily that if she had an ounce of sympathy, she would leave Paul alone to recover. She then announced that she was going to pack a bag for Paul, and she wanted Emily to be gone when she was finished doing that. Emily watched as Barbara left the room, and then Emily said, \"I know where he is!\" and left.\n\n\nA doctor asked Paul questions about whether he heard voices or had visions, and Paul gave flippant answers out of frustration about his situation. He told the doctor that he seemed to be okay ever since the doctors had removed the \"piece of machinery\" from his brain, and he asked if he could return home. The doctor told Paul there were more tests to be run, and he left.\n\n\nEmily approached the nurses' station and asked where Paul Ryan was. She told the nurse that she was Dr. Stewart's daughter and that she was an aroma therapist whom Dr. Stewart had thought might be able to help Paul. Emily said she understood that Paul might be suffering from olfactory delusions. The nurse told Emily where Paul was, and Emily went into Paul's room.\n\n\nPaul told Emily that Barbara was trying to have him committed, but Emily said that they would stop Barbara from doing that. Paul thought that fighting Barbara legally could take weeks or even months. Emily wondered what else they could do, and Paul asked what the \"old\" Paul Ryan would do. Emily got a look of cunning on her face and said, \"Leave it to me.\"\n\n\nEmily left and returned with a very large dog cage, which she informed the nurse contained \"Jackson,\" a canine who was there to help her with Paul's aromatherapy. Emily wheeled the crate into Paul's room, and Paul asked where the very large dog who belonged in the crate was. Emily replied that she'd left the dog in the pediatrics wing. Emily then explained that the crate would serve as Paul's getaway car. She convinced Paul to get inside, but Paul said, \"I'm going to want a treat when we get home!\" Emily wheeled Paul out of the room and narrowly missed encountering Barbara, who was talking on the phone. After Emily and Paul left, Barbara entered Paul's room. When she saw that it was empty, she began yelling for help.\n\n\nEmily took Paul back to Fairwinds and suggested that they run away. Paul didn't want to run, but Emily said if he didn't, the men in the white coats would get him again. Paul said that the men couldn't do that if they couldn't find him, and he led Emily down to the wine cellar. Emily agreed that the wine cellar would be a good place to hide out, but she still had business to conduct. Emily told Paul that she would be back later, and she went upstairs.\n\n\nPaul found a log that had been written by his father, James Stenbeck, and he sat down to read it. He discovered an entry that was about the \"fruitiest bouquet in the cellar,\" and as he sipped a glass of wine, Paul told himself what a pretentious ass his father was.\n\n\nEmily sat in Paul's living room making a phone call, and Barbara found her there. Barbara accused Emily of helping Paul to escape, but Emily said that Paul wouldn't have needed to escape if Barbara hadn't imprisoned him in the first place. Barbara told Emily that Paul needed help because he was mentally ill. Emily replied, \"He seems perfectly sane to me, even by Oakdale's high standards.\" Barbara insisted that Paul couldn't be alone and that he needed to be protected, but Emily said, \"Not by you. He's gone, Barbara. And something tells me he's not coming back.\"\n\n\n",
