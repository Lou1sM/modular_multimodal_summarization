Bryant told her she didn't have to do that. He said that he had to leave and was going to check on some places for them to live.\n\n\nHal was mopping the floor when Jennifer walked in the kitchen. He told her that mopping was therapy for him. Jennifer complained that Barbara had shown her face in front of the courtroom crowd but had still pushed Jennifer away. Hal tried to convince her that Barbara was not herself and that she had to heal on the inside as well as the outside. He told her that Barbara did love her very much. Jennifer told him she knew changes were inevitable, and she was ready to strike out on her own. She told Hal that she was moving in with Bryant.\n\n\nHal talked about how bad he'd felt when Nikki had left and said Jennifer wanted to leave too. He tried to change her mind about moving out. Jennifer said she was not changing her mind. She said that Bryant loved her, and she was not throwing that away like Barbara had when divorcing Hal. Hal told Jennifer he was going to miss her around the house.\n\n\nBryant knocked at the door. He and Hal discussed the living arrangements between him and Jennifer. Hal wanted to know where they were going to live. He said it was not far from town and that he had gone there, hoping that Jennifer would go with him to check out the place. When Jennifer went to her room to get her purse, Hal warned Bryant that if he ever harmed Jennifer, he would wish he never had. Bryant said he understood.\n\n\nAt Lucinda's house, Lucinda and Bryant talked about Craig. He told her that he'd never be like his dad. He said he wanted to have a life with Jennifer. Lucinda asked if Jennifer had changed her mind about him using his trust fund. Bryant told her that Jennifer didn't know. Lucinda told him that Jennifer was smart and would want to know where he was getting the money for them to live together. Bryant said he'd told her he was working for WorldWide.\n\n\nLucinda said she wouldn't lie for him, but she wouldn't tell Jennifer either. She tried to convince him that it would be less taxing on him if he really did work for her instead of lying about it. Bryant told Lucinda that he'd think about working for her, but at that moment, he was going to find a place for Jennifer and him to live. Lucinda told him that she knew of a place that was out of the way on a dirt road but was close enough to town for them. He said it sounded perfect. He ran off to tell Jennifer about it.\n\n\nIn the church tower, Luke asked Holden if he thought they had peanut butter in Malta. Holden knew that Luke was hungry. They wondered where the friar was and if he was part of the game. The friar returned and told them a friend was arriving that night to help them. He took them bread and cheese. He offered it to them, but Holden wouldn't let Luke eat it even though Luke said he was hungry enough to eat a moose.\n\n\nHolden asked how a friar that lived in poverty could have a gold watch that was worth a lot of money. The friar told Holden that he had a keen eye. He said that a patron had given him the watch as a gift of gratitude. Holden didn't believe him and wanted to know who he really was. The friar said he and his friend could help Holden. Holden said they didn't need help from a liar.\n\n\nWhen Holden told Luke they were leaving, the friar tried to stop them. Holden and the friar fought, and the friar fell down the stairs. Holden told Luke that the friar didn't have a pulse. He told Luke that it wasn't really a game, that everything that happened was real. Luke said he'd thought so but hadn't wanted Holden to worry. Holden told Luke that the friar was one of the bad guys and had probably planned to try to get a ransom for them.\n\n\nLuke asked why Holden wanted to stay there when the friar's friend was arriving soon. Holden said he was counting on that, and when he got there, he was going to get a surprise. Luke wanted to know how they were going to surprise him. Holden said he would put the friar's robe on then he would get some answers from the friar's friend.\n\n\nOn the opera house balcony, Lily found that it was Dante that had sent her the note to meet him and not Damian. She was angry and wanted to know where Luke was. He told her Luke and Holden were in a safe place. She didn't believe him and said if he knew where they were, he wouldn't need to meet with her. Dante told Lily he had lots of people looking for Luke and Holden, and they would find them very soon. He said that Luke was a Grimaldi and would inherit everything, and he would get nothing.\n\n\nLily was shocked the situation was all about money. She told him that Luke had more money than any child alive, and there was nothing that the Grimaldi empire could give him that he didn't already have. Dante said that one day Luke would be curious, and things could change. He said the only way to make sure that things didn't change was to get rid of Luke. Lily told Dante to name his price; she would give him anything to spare Luke's life. He wanted to know how far she would go to save her son. She said she would do anything. He told her she was a brave woman.\n\n\nLily said she wasn't brave, just a mother that loved her son. She said his own mother had to love him that way too. He said his mother was a whore, a rich man's concubine. Lily told him she was sure that his mother still loved him. She begged him to save Luke's life. He said his mother had never cared for him. When Dante had a knife at Lily's neck, she begged him for her life and told him that Damian would hunt him down for killing her. She said that Damian would give him everything to save her and Luke. That was what Dante wanted to hear.\n\n\nLily realized that it wasn't her or Luke that Dante wanted; he wanted Damian. He said that he would find Holden and Luke, and he would deliver them to her only if she delivered Damian to him. Dante told her that she had one week to get Damian to meet him. He said it was Damian's life or Luke's life. Lily wanted to know why she should trust Dante, but she said she would do what he wanted. When he started to leave, she asked about Simon and Katie. He said they were useless, and he would let them go when he got Damian.\n\n\nIn the opera house storage room, Katie asked Simon what was going to happen to them when they left Malta. Simon told her that they had other things to worry about, specifically trying to get away from the men that had them imprisoned. He told her to try to break through the wall, and he would listen for the men when they returned. As Katie continued talking, saying that he would probably leave her behind and not keep his promises to her, he began kissing her.\n\n\nKatie wanted more kisses. Simon told her when they got out of the wall, they would be leaving together. He said when they get back to Oakdale, they would take it one day at a time. They heard Lily screaming. Simon told Katie to not be jealous because he wanted to help Lily. Katie pounded on the door to get the attention of the guard, She told the guard that Simon had left and hadn't taken her.\n\n\nWhen the guard had his back to a closet where Simon was hiding, Simon grabbed him and pulled him in the closet. Katie listened as they fought. Simon stepped out and had the guard's gun. He said they had to leave in a hurry. As they ran in the hallway, several gunshots were fired.\n\n\n",
