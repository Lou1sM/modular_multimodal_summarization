    "soap_central": "\n\nSusan nudges Rick at the Lakeview to get a CT scan to check out his so-called migraine headache problem, \"I've already made the appointment.  Ben's expecting you this afternoon.\"  They compromise on a check-up first thing in the morning.  Susan advises Rick that Bob is showing signs of improvement, which causes Rick to recess into the dark corners of his mind.  After thinking for a minute, he suggests that he should probably get the checkup today instead of tomorrow, \"And while we're there, I can close up a few loose ends.\"  They throw their napkins on the table and jet out the door, brushing past and ignoring Emily and Hal on the way out.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Kim advises Ben she has hired a private nurse to stick by her husband at all times.  Outside Bob's room, Chris runs into Alison.  She tells him she wants some space to process some stuff.\n\n\nThe new dynamic duo of Craig and Dusty tie one on at the Lakeview Lounge as they talk about Dusty's ambition to purchase Java Underground.  Craig lets it slip that Paul threatened him earlier this week.  Dusty sees this as an opportunity to bond, and starts throwing around ideas for a new type of bar.  He wants to have a place where guys go to just kick back, relax, and \"watch the game...watch the talent...whatever.\"  Craig thinks this would solve all the world's problems if only the good people of Oakdale had the right place to unwind and socialize.  Dusty boasts that Java Underground is his, \"as soon as I get my money straight.\"  Craig nearly pulls out his promissory checkbook right then and there.  Craig suggests he could stay in the background while Dusty runs the joint.\n\n\nJen walks up to the BRO offices just as mamma Babs is giving Andr\u00e9 a check to get out of town and to stay away from her daughter.  Jen rushes into the room and grabs the check out of Andr\u00e9's hand, \"You should have waited for more.  She would have given you twice as much!\"  Jen tells her ex off, and Barbar ushers him out the door.  Mamma B, dressed in a fire engine red dress, tells her daughter she bought him off to prove he was only after money, and not her heart, \"It's up to me to show you the kind of man he is.\"  Jen instantly draws parallels between what just happened to her and what Barbara pulled with Paul.  She tries to leave, but Barbara grabs her daughter and wants to know where she's headed.  Jen shucks her mother's hands away and spits, \"I don't care.  Just as long as it's far away from you!\"\n\n\nPaul is at home prepping his measured reaction, as he soon expects his damaged sister to come over looking for solace.  There is a knock at the door and Paul assumes Jen is in tears on the other side waiting for comfort.  He opens the door and finds Rosanna, \"Oh.  It's you.\"  Ro stops by to apologize for Craig's earlier intrusion.  He eagerly invites her in to see how she'll try to clean up Craig's mess.  She first tries to apologize with a gallon of honey, but Paul rebuffs her.  He thinks she should always be ready with business cards in her purse embossed with the phrase, \"You're right, my husband is an idiot.\"  To top it off, he suggests Ro add a tiny little picture of Craig donning a dunce cap.  Rosanna's friendly demure evaporates with this latest insult.  She turns to leave and heads for the door.  Realizing he may have gone too far, he catches up with her and takes hold of her arm while asking her to stay.  Rosanna tries to empathize with Paul telling him she too was deeply hurt by someone close to her.  They lapse into a civil moment, but it soon passes, and Rosanna is out the door as quickly as she arrived.\n\n\nSusan and Rick arrive at the hospital and run into Ben.  Ben steals the murderer away for the CT test.  Susan catches up with her daughter and offers an apology for tossing her out of the house.  She finds out that Alison moved in with Katie.  They forgive each other and hug.  Alison explains she stopped by the other night and found Susan alone and asleep on the couch.  Susan doesn't understand because she was certain Rick was with her the whole evening.  Susan tries to explain it away, but when Alison tells her mother even Rick's car was missing from the driveway, she begins to have doubts about her new husband's integrity.  Susan starts to make up for lost time and offers her daughter help with rent, or anything else if she needs it, with her new apartment.\n\n\nJust seconds after Rosanna leaves, there is another knock at Paul's door.  He thinks Ro has returned for round two, but he finds a tearful Jen instead.  Paul comforts his sis and asks where Andr\u00e9 went, but Jen tells Paul he can just forget about going after her ex.  They hear a knock at the door.  Paul tells Jen it's probably Babs and Jen will need to let her inside so she can fight her own battle.  Jen opens the door, and Barbara is contrite as she asks Jen if they can talk, \"We've always been able to talk.  There's nothing you can't say to me.\"  Jen opens the door wider, then says, \"Nothing?  Oh...well then come on in.\"  Barbara asks Paul if she could speak with Jenifer alone, but Jen asks her brother to stay.  A grovel-fest ensues until Paul points out the games their mother likes to play.  Jen says, \"What do you think I am?  A consolation prize?  You only want me because you can't have him!  That's what this is all about.\"  Jen walks over to Paul's side and says, \"This is my home.  I'll be living here from now on.\"\n\n\nRick runs into Kim in the hallway after his test and they have some quick chitchat before Rick asks to look in on \"his favorite patient.\"  Kim gives him permission and excuses herself to grab a cup of coffee.  Rick arrogantly walks up to Bob's door and enters his room.  His smug attitude vanishes when he sees a nurse attending Bob.  Rick asks the nurse to step out of the room during his examination, but the nurse steps forward and says, \"Sorry Dr. Decker.  I don't think so.\"  Kim returns and finds the two men standing nose to nose.  Rick questions why the nurse won't allow him unrestricted access, and Kim informs Dr. Decker she left strict instructions with the nurse to not leave Bob's side under any circumstances.  Rick leaves after his plans are thwarted.\n\n\nEmily finds her mother at the hospital and apologizes for their recent blowouts.  Susan doesn't make her daughter grovel long, and accepts her apology.  Emily can clearly see a change in her mother's attitude and wants to know more about it, but Rick arrives.  Emily also apologizes to Rick, then excuses herself.  Susan then confronts Rick about his whereabouts the other night.  She tells her husband that Alison was in the house and, \"she told me I was sleeping alone on that couch!  You weren't there!  Where were you?\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Susan convinced Rick to have a checkup. He tried to get in to see Bob, but was stopped by the private nurse that Kim hired. Susan and Alison made amends, and Alison revealed that Susan had been alone on the sofa when she came by to get her things. Emily tried to apologize to her mother. Susan started to reveal this new information, but clammed up when Rick arrived. She later confronted him about the revelation. Alison told Chris that the love between Katie and Simon has shown her what real love is. She said she needs some space from him. Rosanna and Paul discussed being betrayed by loved ones. Jen was furious with Barbara for trying to control her life, and told her that she will no longer be a part of BRO. She also announced she would move in with Paul. Craig and Dusty decided to buy Java Underground together, but Rosanna said no way.",
