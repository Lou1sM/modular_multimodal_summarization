Meg then takes Dusty to the roof terrace where Will likes to hang out and prepares a picnic under the stars.  They reminisce about old times together, but Meg feels that somehow Jennifer is intruding on their romantic time.  Dusty tells Meg that Jen is only a business partner.\n\n\nMargo, Casey and Tom arrive at Al's diner for a late snack and walk in on Will kissing Celia.  Casey is bummed and does not want to discuss his personal life with his parents.  Will gets a call on his cell phone from Paul who asks him to come over. Will bumps into Casey as he is leaving and it is obvious to Margo and Tom that there is bad blood between the boys.  Margo is so thankful that they have no problems with Casey and that he tells her everything.  Tom is not so na\u00efve.\n\n\nAt Carly and Jack's house, Carly and Gwen argue about Gwen's rights as the baby's birth mother.  Gwen asserts her right to change her mind about giving up the baby for 30 days, and Carly tries to convince Gwen that the baby is well cared for where he is.  Carly proposes regular visits for Gwen, but Gwen feels Carly is tricking her.  Gwen says she is taking the baby home with her, and when Carly refuses to turn the baby over to her, Gwen leaves to find her lawyer.\n\n\nPaul is going through Rosanna's memory box and looks again at the baby \"John Doe's\" footprint.  He goes over all the clues Rosanna was trying to give him before she lost consciousness.  He gets an idea and sets out to verify the birth date of Gwen's baby. \n\n\nCelia makes a date with Sierra for a \"girl chat.\" She tells Sierra she is confused about her new relationship with Will who wants to monopolize her time.  Sierra suggest that Celia slow things down for now.\n\n\nWill arrives at Paul's and tells him that Gwen and Jennifer both delivered their babies the same night.  He mentions that both were preemies and even looked a bit alike.  Paul asks other questions about that night in the hospital nursery, and he begins to make sense of the puzzle.\n\n\nCarly calls Jack for help.  Paul shows up and learns there is no news of Rosanna.  Carly tells Paul that Gwen wants the baby back, but it will be over her dead body.  Paul agrees that there is no way Gwen can adequately care for a child in her present circumstances.  Paul asks to hold the baby, and Carly leaves him alone with the child while she does some errands around the house.  Paul takes an ink impression of the baby's foot while Carly is out of the room.\n\n\nAt the diner, Al offers Gwen her old job back and agrees to pay her extra for cleaning out the storeroom.  When Gwen asks if she can keep her baby in the storeroom, however, Al draws the line.  No babies at work, he says.  Gwen's lawyer arrives and Gwen tells him she wants to reclaim her child.\n\n\nOn the roof terrace, Dusty asks Meg point blank what she wants from him.  They begin talking about the stars and end up making love.\n\n\nCelia finally tells Will what is bothering her: the inscription \"Love, Will\" on the bracelet he gave her.  He offers to take it back and suggests a bike ride and picnic the next day.\n\n\nGwen's attorney stuns her by telling her that money to care for the baby will not be a problem because Rosanna has set up a trust fund for his care and maintenance.  He promises to get her a court date so that she can begin the process of getting the baby back. \n\n\nAt Carly's, Paul carefully examines the footprint impression he has just taken of the baby.  \n\n\n",
