She told Holden she'd arrived to tell him she would give him another chance, but having seen him with Carly, she had changed her mind and wanted nothing more to do with him. Lily left and returned home, where Luke was disappointed to hear that things weren't any better between his parents.\n\n\nEmma went home and was surprised to find Carly there. Carly left quickly, while Holden told his mother what had just happened. Emma went to visit Carly and begged her to talk to Lily and convince her that what she'd witnessed at the farm had been innocent. Carly reluctantly agreed, but Lily was unreceptive to Carly's pleas. Carly told Lily she was being a hypocrite, since Lily had wanted Holden to forgive her right away for having slept with Dusty.\n\n\nLily told Carly that because of her affair with Dusty, she knew how Holden felt and knew that even when he was sleeping with her, he was thinking of Carly; Lily said she couldn't live like that. Carly told Lily to let Emma know she'd tried to get Lily to change her mind about Holden. Carly left, and Lily called Emma and made it clear she didn't want any more help concerning her relationship with Holden.\n\n\nAfter Emma told Holden that he and Lily were both too stubborn, Holden told Emma he was going to move to the Lakeview for a while. When he arrived there, he called Carly and invited her to join him at the hotel for drinks. Carly hung up on him after telling him she didn't think that was a very good idea.\n\n\nBarbara joined Paul at the hospital and asked what had happened to Meg. He explained that her hallucinations had become worse, and she had tried to kill him. Barbara asked whether Paul had called Holden or Emma yet. Paul said no, but Meg began shouting for him, and he got the nurse to let him back into Meg's room. Meg was confused about why she was hospitalized, and Paul tried to calm her.\n\n\nHowever, Meg continued to have visions of Sofie, who insisted Meg needed to kill Paul unless she wanted to spend the rest of her life locked up in a mental institution. Meg talked Paul into undoing her restraints, but the minute she was free, she tried to strangle Paul. Paul subdued her long enough to call for a nurse, but Meg ran out of the room when the nurse entered. Paul found her and took her back to her room, where the doctors sedated her.\n\n\nChris and Casey were sharing a hospital room, watched over by Kim and Margo. Although Casey was heavily sedated and unconscious, Chris appeared to be feeling better and wanted to go to the lab to try to figure out what was wrong with everyone. Bob entered the room and told everyone the lab had found a synthetic toxin in the blood work for Chris, Casey, Emily, and Alison. Chris said that meant someone had poisoned them all.\n\n\nBob told Margo the toxin could be fatal and asked if Margo had spoken to Tom. Margo said Tom was on his way back from an out-of-town trip but that she hadn't told him how serious it was because of Tom's heart problems. Kim told Margo she should go to the police station to try to find out who was behind the poisoning, even though she didn't want to leave her son, Margo agreed she needed to be at the station to try to help Casey by solving the mystery.\n\n\nWhen Kim picked up a pile of Chris's clothes, his new watch fell out. Chris told his mom he thought he'd lost it. Kim asked where he'd gotten the watch, and he told her she'd given it to him. Kim assured him she had not, and Chris realized that meant someone had sent him the watch and tried to make him think it was from his mother. It dawned on Chris that the watch might have been coated with the toxin.\n\n\nAlison and Emily were also sharing a hospital room, watched over by Susan and Aaron. Chris stumbled into their room and asked Susan whether Alison or Emily had received any unexpected gifts recently. Susan said the only thing Alison had gotten recently had been the bracelet her father had sent her. Chris asked if she was positive the bracelet was from Alison's father, and Susan said she thought so. Chris asked her to call Larry to ask whether he'd sent the bracelet; Susan did, and she reported to Chris that Larry had said he had not sent the gift.\n\n\nChris took the bracelet and his watch to the lab to have them analyzed. Bob found him there, and Chris explained his theory. Chris said they didn't yet know how Emily had been exposed to the toxin, but Casey could have gotten the toxin in his system after having had sex with Emily. A lab technician took in a report of yet another patient with the toxin in her blood; Bob told Chris it was Meg Snyder Ryan.\n\n\nChris went to Meg's room with Bob and asked Barbara and Paul whether Meg had received any clothing or jewelry recently. Barbara told them about the necklace Meg had been wearing, and they told her to call Will and Gwen to find out whether they had actually sent the necklace. Barbara called them and left a message; when her phone rang a minute later, it wasn't Will, but Rick Decker. Barbara spoke to him and realized he knew what was happening to her family. Decker told Barbara to hire him, and he would help make things better.\n\n\nBarbara told Paul about the phone call. Paul wondered how Decker would know what was happening, and Barbara suggested Decker was behind it, as a form of revenge against the people responsible for putting him in prison. Barbara reminded Paul that the necklace Meg had been wearing had actually been intended for Barbara. Paul suggested they kill Decker, but Barbara said that would have to wait until they got past the medical crisis. Paul agreed that they should hire Decker.\n\n\nDallas Griffin spoke to Emily, who remembered having received perfume from an advertiser. However, when Emily called the advertiser, they told her they hadn't sent the perfume. Susan gave Dallas the bottle that Emily had passed on to her, called \"Second Chances.\" Dallas asked what type of perfume Emily had kept for herself, and Emily said it was called \"Sweet Revenge.\"\n\n\nPaul and Meg went to the police station and told Margo they needed her help to get Decker out of prison again to help them with the case. Margo agreed reluctantly, since everyone was grasping at straws, trying to help the people they loved. Meanwhile, back at the hospital, Casey awoke and became frantic, wanting to see Emily, so Kim called Margo and said she'd better get to the hospital immediately.\n\n\nWhen Margo arrived, Casey was still very agitated. Margo asked Susan to take Emily to Casey, which she did. They undid Casey's restraints, and Emily lay down next to him on his hospital bed. Margo went to the lab, where Bob asked if she had any leads on who might be behind the poisonings. Margo said she didn't but told Bob about Paul and Barbara hiring Rick Decker. As she related the story, she suddenly realized they had to have hired him because they thought he was the culprit.\n\n\nDr. Decker was taken to the police station under guard, and he told Barbara and Paul he was happy to see them and that their business arrangement would be mutually beneficial. They took him to the hospital, where he told them he had the antidote for the toxin. When Barbara asked what he wanted in return, Decker told Paul and Barbara he wanted them to help him escape. \n\n\n",
