He stormed out of the house and said that he was going to live with Tom.  Tom says he is a smart kid, he'll be all right.  He asks how he found out and Margo tells him about Doc Reese being his golf instructor.  Margo admits to going over the top and insisted he cancel the lesson.  Casey put it all together himself.  Margo asks what kind of a Mother is she, what kind of Mother breaks their kids hearts like that.  Tom and Margo talk, but she is visably shaken.  She says she has called everyone but one person. Should she call Doc, says Margo to Tom.  He scoffs at her and says, you don't need my permission to do that.  Tom tells her that he wanted to beat Doc senseless, maybe Casey does too.  She tells Tom again that she did not have an affair with Doc.  He tells her that she chose another man so even though she stopped it short of consumating it, you thought about it, you wanted it enough to lie about it to the people who love you.  She asks Tom, if he still loves her.  Before he says anything, he reminds her that this is about Casey and that she knows the answer.\n\n\nBen and Jessica are enjoying some time together alone.  He is making a toast with gingerale to her, telling her what a great Mother she will be.  Jessica sees Doc enter the room and suggests they leave.  Ben says ok, if she will let him hold her, and she remarks, that she would have it no other way.\n\n\nOn the way out, Casey bursts in and walks up to Doc.  Doc tells him he's sorry about the busted golf lesson.  Doc tells him he will talk to him man to man, but don't disrespect him or his Mother.  Doc brings Casey to the side and tells him that he is off base.  Ben and Jessica overhear this conversation while being a short distance away.  Casey asks Doc why he Mom went nuts at the club and why did his Grandman fire him.  Doc tries to make excuses but Casey isn't falling for any of it.  Doc tells him he never had an affair with his Mom.  Casey tells him that he used him to get to his Mother.  Casey addresses the fact that Doc doesn't care about anybody.  Not his Dad, not him and maybe not even his Mother.  Casey says, they were happy.  They were a family, and he destroyed all of that.  Ben walks up to Casey and tells him that they need to take a walk.  Casey tells Doc, that he is nobody's hero, he is nothing.  Casey leaves as Ben and him go to find his Dad.  Doc looks at the people watching and staring at him, and tells them that the show is over.  Jessica stands in the back and watches Doc.  After a while, she walks up to him and says that not too many people have held you as accountable as Casey just did.  He tells her he grew up with these things he could do, and pretty soon people were telling him that he was something, he was special.  They wanted him to meet their wives and sometimes it happened so fast, it was so easy, that they never saw it coming.  When they started to make excuses for his behavior though, that's when you start to feel above it all.  Well, no matter who you are Doc, says Jessica, I guess life has a way of catching up with you at some point.  Jessica tells Doc not to talk about the baby.  It is her's and Bens.  He says he didn't mean anything by that, and she comments that he never means to hurt anyone, but, the body count keeps rising.  Jessica walks off, but, doubles over, in pain.\n\n\nCasey arrives at Tom's with Ben.  They are glad to see he is safe.  Margo asks Casey where he has been.  Casey finally tells them that he went to see Doc Reese.  Tom tells Casey, that your Mom is still your Mom, and as long as he is around, he will treat her with respect.  Margo speaks up and says to Casey that she is ashamed of herself.  She forgot that in a family what one person does affects everyone in the family.  She knows she's hurt everyone but she loves them both and doesn't want to lose them.\n\n\nJennifer comes in from the airport calling for Jordan.  She tells him that it was all a lie.  Barbara and her symptoms, the N.Y. specialist, it was a trick to get her and Paul out of town and she even tried to blame Rosanna.  Jordan tells her that he knows.  He now needs her to understand what he is going to say and he apologizes to her.  He tells her they can't be together anymore.  Jennifer asks Jordan how he can say it's over just like that.  He tells her he loves her, and says that they should break up. He doesn't want this, but doesn't have any other choice.  He doesn't want her to be angry or hurt, so how is she supposed to feel?  He tells her that James was behind the incident that happened the day the baby was switched for awhile.  It's only one of the times that James proved he could do what he wanted.  Jennifer tells him that is the reason why they agreed to stick together.  So Cabot would be safe.  He tells Jennifer that James wants he and Rosanna to make their marriage work.  Jennifer wants to know how that message got to them.  Jordan tells her it was in Cabot's clothes, after he had taken Cabot to see James at the prison.  Jennifer tells Jordan that she found out when she was in NY that no one tells the truth, that people lie, and manipulate, and they always say it's for their own good.  She starts to leave and Jordan tells her that it's the hardest thing he has ever had to do.  She says, if you are looking for sympathy, don't hold your breath.  \n\n\nPaul and Rosanna make love.  He tells her he thought he was always going to have to be Uncle Paul.  His feelings were wrong.  Paul tells Rosanna that his Dad doesn't always get what he wants.  He asks her if she trusts him and she says yes.  He has finally figured out a way to get James out of their lives.  Jordan is met by Paul and Rosanna who tell them that the meeting will be starting shortly.  Rosanna tells Jordan that they have decided on another plan.  They were going to do what James said, but then Rosanna  made a better decision.  Paul tells Jordan that he needs to start thinking out of the box, where James is concerned.  The doorbell rings and it is answered by the maid.  She shows in Governor Barnes.  He says from her message, Rosanna is willing to make a contribution to his re-election bid.  Paul says she is willing to write a sizable check provided he can help them with a rather delicate issue.  He says he would be happy to give any assistance that he can.  Paul says, \"I guess you've heard of my Father, James Stenbeck.  The Governor says yes, and Paul tells him that he and Rosanna are willing to put whatever resources they have behind his campaign if he is willing to have James Stenbeck transferred to another facility far from Illinois.  The Governor tells him that it is not his decision to make.  Paul says make it work, pick up the phone and call some friends, and work the system.  The Governor asks if there's a problem with James' confinement.  Jordan says James has been threatening  their son and trying to get Rosanna and Jordan to bend to his will.  Do you have proof of all this, asks the Governor.  Paul says James never leaves a trail but he has contacts on the inside and he's had people take their son, Cabot.  The important thing is that James should be in solitary confinement with no other contacts and no other prisoners, no guards and no visitors.  The Governor says he cannot do that without a formal legal charge.  They say there is no time for that.  Paul tells him that his Father trades in innocent lives and he needs to do the right thing here, even if it's not pretty.  Or the next check, says Rosanna, will be to your opponent.  The Governor calls that extortion, but, Paul says, it's just politics.  Now, are you with us or against us?\n\n\nAt James' cell, at the jail, he is told that he has visitors.  Paul tells James that Jordan is on his way to patch things up with Jennifer.  Is James surprised?  Paul says, they have lots more surprises for him.  Rosanna tells him that she and Jordan thought over what he said, but, decided against all of it.  James says that it is unfortunate for the boy, but Paul disagrees.  It is unfortunate for you.  But, wait 'cause it gets worse.  He calls in the Governor.  The Governor tells James, he just obtained a court order transferring him to a maximum security facility in California, effective immediately, where he will be in solitary confinement until it so deemed he will be no longer a threat to other people.  And that Dad, says Paul, is checkmate!!!\n\n\nSierra is at Alan's bedside.  Alan is remembering scene with Craig at the place where he discovered Lucy was kidnapped.  Alan is visibly shaken and upset and Craig is saying to Sierra that they should leave him alone.  Dusty enters the room.  Sierra asks Alan what he is trying to say to her.  Craig gets her out of the room.  Lucinda comes up, and says that whoever or whatever it was, upset him quite a bit.  Craig says it was when Dusty came in and Dusty says, it's funny, 'cause he was looking at you.  Sierra doesn't want to go far away, and Lily is telling Dusty that he should leave.  Lily says to the two of them that no more comments are to be made about Craig.  He saved her life.  Dusty wants to know what was in it for him. Lily doesn't want anything made worse for her sister.  Dusty comments that the only thing making it worse is that moron ex husband of hers.  John Dixon comes out and tells them that Alan has stabilized but his blood pressure has dropped.  He's agitated, and also critical.  He is critical and may not survive so John is limiting his visitors to just Sierra. \n\n\nLucy asks to see Dusty alone.  Dusty brings her coffee.  Lucy kisses him on the cheek.  She thanks him for not giving up on finding her.  He admits he was scared when he saw the tape and was afraid he wouldn't get to her in time.  She tells him when she was in the box she thought about him and her family.  He gave her all that back when he saved her.  Even if Alan makes it, says Lucy, she doesn't know what it will do to her Mom.  Lucy says that if her Dad is right, and Alan is guilty, although Dusty doesn't believe he is, and Dusty cuts her off and tells her they will figure it out later.  He only knows that right now Criag is hoping that Alan will die.  Dusty says that he did not save Lucy's life so he could watch her Father get away with murder.  He tells Lucy that he knows what he knows and wishes he was wrong, but he is not. Lucy says that Larson and the other guy lied.  He tells her he has records showing everything from the beginning until now, and that it all points back to Craig.  He doesn't want to hurt her, but, its all a part of growing up.  She says in the past couple of weeks she has, but, he still wants her to believe something that she knows could never be true.  She leaves for Alan's room.\n\n\n Craig and Lucinda remain.  Lily asks them to please stop what they are doing to each other.  She says they are all family, and Sierra will need them all if Alan dies.  Lily tells Lucinda that Alan is worried about Craig, because Craig knows what Alan did.  He could be facing death, if he survives.  John tells Sierra that Alan needs to remain calm and get some rest.  Sierra says to Alan that she promised her a lifetime together and she's not gonna let him break that promise.  Alan starts to come around and mumbles something to Sierra.  It is the name Craig.  Lucinda asks to table the conversation about Craig until Alan is better and can say what happened.  Lily tells Lucinda, she does know all ready, because she found evidence in the suitcase that was Alan's.  Craig asks Lucy and Lucinda to go for tea to give them something to do.  When they leave, Craig enters Alan's room again.  He stands watching Alan talking with Sierra.  Quietly, he stands. It throws Alan into convulsions and he passes away.   Craig rushes in after leaving the room while Alan died, and comforts Sierra, saying that he wished there was something that he could have done.  John says that Alan lost too much blood and his heart was compromised.  Craig and Sierra come out of Alan's room, and Lucy and Dusty walk in, and Lucinda and Lily come from yet another direction to find that Alan has not made it.\n\n\n",
