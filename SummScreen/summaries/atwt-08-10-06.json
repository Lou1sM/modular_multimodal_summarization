He says she shouldn't give up on him, just like he hasn't given up on Maddie.  Gwen is surprised when Casey tells her of how Maddie turned him away when he tried talking with her at the police station.  She convinces Casey to go see Maddie.  Gwen then goes out to look for Will.  When she finds him at Java with Jade, she quickly goes away in tears before being seen, bumping into Barbara.  Gwen tells Barbara her marriage to Will is over since he slept with Jade.  Totally taken aback by this, Barbara goes inside to confront her son.  She tells him she just ran into Gwen, and Will tries to go out to see if she's still there, only to find she has already left.  Barbara has a talk with her son, telling him he shouldn't go after his wife.  Instead, she offers to try to talk with her.  At first Will flat out refuses, but then he agrees with his mother's plans.  \n\n\nEve meets Henry and Maddie at the Lakeview  with a surprise: her husband Louis.  Henry and Maddie aren't exactly thrilled that he is here and Maddie shows her displeasure by dodging Louis's greeting hug.  Maddie is disgusted by the fact that more of her relatives are coming to Oakdale to try to get through to her and she storms off.  Just as she leaves, Casey arrives.  Louis immediately suspects Casey has something to do with Maddie's situation and questions their relationship.  Casey counters by questioning Louis's relationship with his sister-in-law and the two begin a heated exchange.  Eventually, Casey leaves and Louis believes he is trouble.  He chastises Henry for not paying more attention to Maddie.  Louis finally claims that he can get Maddie to open up.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Luke now knows Lucy is trying to uncover the truth about Damian's illness.  He confronts Lucy and she tells him she still thinks Damian is faking his illness, but Luke is adamant on going to Malta with Damian.  Luke tells her cousin the two are leaving in a few hours, and the two share a goodbye.  When Luke leaves, Lucy makes a quick phone call and asks a co-worker to fill in for her claiming \"her grandmother is very sick and she has to care for her.\"  Unbeknownst to her, Sergio is spying on her again.  Sergio tells Damian that Lucy is up to no good and warns him he and Luke must leave as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, Dusty admonishes Lucinda that her granddaughter may be in danger.  He tells Lucinda that a man possibly working for Damian was spying on her at the hospital.  Lucinda takes Dusty's word for it, but reassures him that Lucy is out of harm's way at the hospital.  Dusty goes to the hospital to check on Lucy, but finds out she isn't at the hospital after all.  He wonders what Lucy is up to.\n\n\nWhen Lucy finds out Damian and Luke are leaving soon, she makes his last few hours in Oakdale worth his while and passionately kisses him.  Before things really heat up, Lucy tries to pry into Damian's personal life and asks him questions.  While she serves him and herself some tea, she slips an anesthetic into Damian's tea.  Damian drinks the tainted tea and after a while begins to feel tired and it appears he is out cold.  Seizing her opportunity, Lucy gets out her needle, hoping to draw blood from Damian.  But before she can insert the needle into his arm, Damian grabs her hand.\n\n\nLuke meets up with Jade at Java and finds out she slept with Will and ruined his marriage with Gwen.  Luke is surprised that Jade is unashamed and she tells Luke that Will is better off without Gwen.  Meanwhile, Barbara tries to talk with Gwen and pleads with her to give her marriage a second try.  She claims that Jade seduced and used Will, but Gwen insists Will is partly to blame as well.  The two are interrupted when Casey walks in.  Barbara leaves Casey and Gwen alone and Gwen reveals to Casey that she found Will and Jade together.  She insists on not moving back to her home with her husband, and Casey offers Gwen to stay at his place for a while.  Gwen happily agrees and the two hug while Maddie jealously looks on.
