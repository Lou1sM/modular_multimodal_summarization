    "soap_central": "\n\nLily finds Holden in Old Town\n and offers him an early birthday gift: she has taken his grandfather's old watch and had it refurbished for him. Holden thanks her but says if she thinks this will make him forget what she did (in hiding the truth from him about paying the ransom money for Carly), she's wrong. Lily protests that it's just a gift to show how much she loves him, and as they talk, Faith walks up and hears the strain between them. They take Faith into Al's Diner to eat, but while there, Holden gets a business call on his phone and goes outside to take the call. Faith asks Lily if she and Holden are getting a divorce. Lily is shocked and insists there's no reason to think such a thing, but Faith says she heard them arguing outside and that she's old enough to know what's going on. Lily gives in and simply says that she did something to betray Holden's trust in her, but they'll work it out and everything will be fine. Faith gets a call from one of her friends inviting her over for dinner, and after Lily speaks to the friend's mom, she tells Faith she can go and says the mom will pick her up outside. Faith hugs Lily and leaves, with reassurances that things will be fine. When Holden comes back in, Lily tells him that Faith asked if they were getting a divorce. Holden simply asks, \"What did you tell her?\" Lily looks at Holden, concerned, and says, \"I told her we weren't. Now I need you to tell me that it wasn't a lie.\" Holden is still upset about the ransom money incident, and Lily tries to explain how she felt, saying she paid the ransom to try to prevent something terrible from happening, like it did with Rose. Holden tells her that what happened with Rose wasn't her fault, but Lily says she can't help but feel that she should have done something, and she tells Holden that the subject of Rose's death came up frequently while she was in rehab. Holden says that the importance Lily places on Rose in her life makes him feel like he and the kids don't count. Lily insists that that's not the case and says she loves and needs them all. He says somewhere along the line, she stopped trusting him, and he doesn't think they can have a marriage without that. Lily says she does trust Holden, but maybe she's been afraid that if she was completely open with him, she'd lose him for good. She promises that in the future, she'll be completely truthful with him and tell him everything.\n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Luke and Noah are horsing around in the kitchen and end up in each other's arms, shirtless and still wet from their swim in the pond. There's an instant of obvious charged attraction between the two before Maddie walks in and they separate. Noah goes to Maddie and kisses her, asking how Henry and Vienna are doing. Maddie tells them but then wants to know what they've been up to. Noah acts noticeably nervous and asks Maddie if she'd like to go somewhere else to eat. Maddie protests that Luke should come, too, or that they can just stay there and eat, but Noah insists he'd like to be alone with her. Maddie thinks that's silly, but Luke, seeing Noah's discomfort, tells her they should go ahead and leave. They go, and Noah takes Maddie to Old Town\n for ice cream. Maddie wants to know what was happening back at the farm with Luke, because it was obvious Noah was in a hurry to get out of there, but Noah says he doesn't want to talk about Luke. Maddie says he should try to become good friends with Luke, because after she leaves to go to Wesleyan in a few weeks, Noah won't have any friends. Noah tells her she should think about not going to Wesleyan but staying in Oakdale and going to Oakdale University with him. Maddie is shocked that he would suggest she give up Wesleyan, a college she's dreamed about for years, but Noah tells her sometimes you have to do the unexpected thing and see what happens. He gets Maddie to say that she'll at least think about staying in Oakdale.\n\n\nLuke goes to work at WOAK, where he remembers the scene at the farm but tells himself, \"That was nothing; it meant nothing.\" He types up more of the story he's writing about the girl no one notices, adding in a scene very much like the one that just transpired between him and Noah, and in his story, he says, \"Maybe I misunderstood what he wanted. Or maybe he doesn't know what he wants himself.\" \n\n\nBrad, determined to get Katie to forget her troubles and worries for a while, makes up a story about Parker acting out since JJ's kidnapping and gets Katie to agree to go to the farm to try to talk to him. Once they arrive, they run into Luke, who's on his way out. Luke tells Katie that Parker's at a friend's house for the night, and he tells her Brad had given Parker permission to go. After Luke leaves, Katie wants to know why Brad lied to her. He says he just wanted her to eat and not be alone, so he concocted the story to get her out to the farm. She gets mad, and he tells her to go ahead and take her anger out on him, because he knows she's mostly mad that Carly's out there helping Jack try to find JJ. Katie says she understands the situation with Carly and Jack and JJ, but a selfish part of her wishes she and Jack had had some time to celebrate their engagement. Brad says they can do some celebrating tonight, and he gets a deck of cards and a bottle of wine, and they sit down to play poker. Katie has a long streak of beginner's luck and ends up enjoying herself and winning all of Brad's money. When she sees that he's out of cash, she says it's time to call it quits, but Brad stands up and takes off his shirt and says, \"I am in it to win it!\"\n\n\nIn Idaho, Carly has gotten JJ's ropes loose, unbeknownst to Silas, and she tells Silas that she's taking JJ with her and leaving. As Silas moves toward the door, JJ finishes untying the ropes and jumps up, grabs a piece of firewood, and knocks Silas over the head with it. Carly shoves JJ out the door and as Silas drags her back inside the cabin, she yells at JJ to keep going, saying she and Jack will find him. Silas ties Carly up, and Ava comes back in with JJ at gunpoint. Silas tells her to take JJ to the back room and then calls Kit at the bar, asking her if there's a man there looking for his old lady. He tells Kit that the man is a cop named Jack Snyder, and that he and his wife are there to make trouble for him and Ava. Then he gets Kit to tell Jack that a drunk at the bar needed a ride home and Lee (Carly) took him home. Kit agrees to tell Jack the story and also tells him that the drunk is sometimes mean, so Jack asks her to give him directions so he can go get Lee/Carly. After he leaves the bar, Kit calls Silas to let him know that Jack's on his way. When Jack's car drives up, Silas tapes up Carly's mouth, but then he hears the car drive away, so he tells her maybe Jack's not much of a hero after all. As his back is to the door, Jack comes in with his gun drawn, but when Silas yells, \"Ava, get that kid out of here!\" Jack looks around, and in that moment, Silas wrestles the gun away and knocks Jack down. Carly, who has managed to get herself untied, runs to Jack. Silas then uses Jack's handcuffs to chain Jack and Carly together around a table in the cabin and leaves. Jack tells Carly he feels like he's been kicked in the gut twice, because of what she's done again, but Carly says she had to take the opportunity to try to find JJ when she had it, and she says she tried to call him but couldn't let this lead get away. Jack tells her they have to work together to get out of this situation and asks if she's with him; she responds, \"I'm with you, Jack --- always.\" Meanwhile, Ava and Silas take JJ back to the bar, where Kit tells them to do whatever it takes to get rid of Jack and Carly, for good.\n\n\n\n\n",
