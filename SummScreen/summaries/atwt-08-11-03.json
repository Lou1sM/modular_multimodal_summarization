Yes, Walker tells her, Travers is Sarah's biological father.\n\n\nAt Mabel's, Todd from the Community Center is having an outing with some of the children from the Center, including Sarah.  Marshall Travers arrives with a date, and while they are involved in ordering their hot dogs, Sarah lifts the woman's wallet from her purse.  She takes out a quarter to use in the juke box and then puts the wallet in her pocket.  Todd takes the other kids out to the van while Sarah listens to her song.  When Travers' date goes to pay for their drinks, she realizes her wallet is gone.

When Jen leaves the room, Paul tells his mother that his nasty streak is genetic.\n\n\nAt Susan's house, Ric tells her that the only time he left her side on the night in question was to go upstairs to get aspirin for his recurring migraine headache.  But why wasn't his car in the driveway, she asks?  Ric explains that because of paving in the neighborhood, he parked a block away so that he wouldn't be stuck in case they paved their street.  Ric has an answer for all Susan's questions, but Susan is getting suspicious.  Ric then tells Susan that her daughters are their \"enemies,\" and Susan comes immediately to their defense.  Ric complains  that he does not like people thinking the worst of him, including her.  Suddenly, Emily bursts in.\n\n\nAt Mabel's, Sarah denies taking the wallet, and Todd comes in to defend her.

Sarah gets very defensive about Bonnie.\n\n\nBonnie and Walker are still talking.

Emily tells her mother to count on her for help.\n\n\nHal finds Alison at the hospital and learns she is living at Katie's now.  She doesn't know, however, what she will do when Katie comes back.  Can she come and live with Hal, she asks?  Hal tells her that that might not be necessary; perhaps she can go back home.  He also confides to her that Ric is still a suspect in the serial killings.  As soon as Hal leaves, Ric finds Alison and tries to explain how he was in the house while she was there the other night.  Alison doesn't believe a word he is saying.

    "tvmega_recap": "Walker told Bonnie that the DNA test results prove that Sarah is Marshall's daughter. Bonnie begged him not to tell anyone, but he tried to convince her that Sarah deserves to know, despite Marshall's past. At Mabel's Red Hots, Sarah stole Marshall's date's wallet. Marshall confronted Sarah, thinking Bonnie had put her up to it. Sarah admitted to the theft, but insisted that Bonnie had nothing to do with it. Emily and Hal agreed that they must be patient if they hope to catch Rick, and Hal repeated this to Alison. Meanwhile, Rick told Susan that when Alison was at the house, he was upstairs getting an aspirin, and said his car was parked on a side street because their neighborhood was being paved. Susan was unsure that others will believe him, but he said he doesn't care, and that her daughters are their biggest enemy. Susan resented this, saying she loves her daughters for caring about her. Rick later confronted Alison, and got angry when she tried to gracefully walk away. At Paul's penthouse, Barbara tried to pay Paul for winning their bet, but he tore up the check. Jen told Barbara that she is finished with BRO, and with her. Barbara told Paul he was just like his father. Paul talked to \"James\" inside his head, who agreed that he was becoming a chip off the old block.",
