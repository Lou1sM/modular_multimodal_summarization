They are not expecting her back that soon.  Sierra wants to know what they are talking about.  She tells them that no one will leave until she finds out.  Lily tells her that Alan engineered Lucy's kidnapping.  Sierra tells them all that they are crazy for thinking Alan could be involved in any of this.  Everything she has belonged to both her and Alan and he loved Lucy.  She asks if they all believe that Alan had something to do with anything.  They question why he would have copies of Lucy's documents.  Sierra calls them all cruel, spiteful and wrong, and she walks out.  Lucy runs after her Mother who is looking through all of Alan's belongings.  It seems the more she looks, the more she finds.  Lucy even finds a key to Metro.  Sierra wants to be left alone, so Lucy leaves and returns to the living room where everyone awaits.  She has items that should be given to the police.  Lucy says that there is enough evidence for Dusty  to stop blaming her Father, because he could never do anything to hurt her.\n\n\nBen re-enters the restaurant looking for Jessica.  In the meantime, Doc has taken her to the hospital where she is in severe pain.  Dr. Schiller is called.

He tells her he's got her.  These things happen.  It's nature's way of making sure you have a healthy pregnancy.  It's not because of what she did or didn't do.

She held her captive in her room in N.Y. while she was constantly being lied to by her Mother yet again.  Jennifer says that she is leaving for Europe that night and she and Jordan can go to hell.  Jennifer tells her Mother that she has to leave for her own survival.  Her Mother wanted to break her and Jordan up, and, she  has, so congratulations.  In the middle of trying to talk with Jennifer, Barbara receives a call from Walker, that he is  on the way over.  Jennifer tells her Mother that if she cares for Walker at all, she will let him go before she destroys his life too.  Barbara tells her that Walker stood by her in her worst times.  Jennifer says that he will learn to regret that.  She calls for her luggage to be taken.  As Jennifer walks out the door, she says goodbye to her Mother.  On the way out, Jennifer is met by Jordan who insists she come with him.  If what he shows her, she doesn't like, he will let her go.  He will even drive her himself.  They leave together.  Walker arrives at Barbara's.  He asks Barbara to listen to what he has to say.  He tells her that people warned him about her in the beginning, but he thought, he would be good for her, and with a little give and take, things would be fine, but, they're not fine Barbara.  You need help, more help that he can give her.  He asks Barbara what she was thinking when she lied to her children again, when they went through hell with her the first time.  Was it James?\n\n\nBarbara says she made a mistake never to be repeated again.  He asks her when the last time was, she saw Lynn Michaels.  It was one of the things ordered when her surgery was over and now it's time for her to resume her therapy.  She asks if that is a condition for them being together.  He answers her by saying, there is no \"us\" anymore.  He tells her he is her friend and she needs friends, but she wants to be loved.  He says she must learn to love herself, and believe that you are worthy of it, then she won't go to such destructive measures.  Barbara shows Walker to the door.  She claims she doesn't need anyone.  Jordan, in Rosanna's living room, tells Jennifer that Rosanna and Paul are at the jail.  They have neutralized James, for good.  She asks, how that can be, and he shows her the annulment papers.  All they have to do is be signed.  He tells her she is the one he loves.  \n\n\nAt the jail, James learns that the Governor is sending him to California.  He will be away from Cabot, Rosanna, Jordan and all the lives he tried to ruin.  He will be placed in solitary confinement.  James tells the Governor that he just wants to serve the rest of his sentence in peace.  He's been, a model prisoner; just ask anyone: the warden, the guards.  The Governor agrees with him.  However, what he also learned was that corruption runs rampant in that facility and he is now making reform the cornerstone of his re-election campaign.  The Governor thanks Paul and Rosanna and leaves.  James asks Paul, if he is stupid enough to believe this will change anything.  Paul says it will, because James will be in a pit so dark  and deep,  he will never see anything again.  There will be no more free phone calls or anyone to do his bidding for him.  The free ride is over.  James asks his son, why, every time Paul is out to prove himself, he always is against him.  James then asks Rosanna, if that's what she really wants.  Paul tells James, that he and Rosanna are together, and they will stay together.  Rosanna tells James, she has no doubts about Paul, in her mind or in her heart.  Are there any other questions?  Paul approaches his Father, once again, saying that James has played his last card and he got trumped.  He'll never know his sons or his grandchildren, no peace, no happiness and no love.  Paul tells him that he regrets not doing this to James a long time ago.  James' bus arrives to take him away and Paul says to Rosanna, \"let's go and celebrate!\"  Barbara answers the door to find a delivery for her.  The man hands her a package and says that's all she needs to know.  It is a cassette tape.    The guards now have James shackled into his seat for the ride.  Barbara plays the tape.  It says that if you are listening to the tape, it only means one thing, I need your help.  It is from James.  James, sitting in his ride, says, \"and they think this is the end.\"\n\n\nPaul and Rosanna return and find Jordan and Jennifer kissing.  They tell them that James is being transported as they speak.    The doorbell rings and it is a gentleman with some papers to be signed.  Rosanna once again, asks Jordan, if this is what he wants, and Jordan replies, only from the day we got married.  The paperwork is complete and everyone is free.  They all celebrate by making a toast of congratulations to the four of them.\n\n\nWalker meets up with Ben at the hospital.  Ben asks him to do some kind of an exam, to find out if anything can be done, to make it easier next time.  Walker says that he can do a full genetic workup for Ben and he will.\n\n\n",
