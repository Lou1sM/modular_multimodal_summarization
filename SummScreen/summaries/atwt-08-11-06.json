    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry, Eve, and her husband, Louis, are discussing Maddie's problems. Louis insists that Maddie trusts him and will listen to him, saying he's been like a father to her and that Henry has been too absent or too soft on her. Louis says no matter what they might think, the truth is that Maddie has \"never been normal.\" Henry tells Louis that it's not every day that a \"fatuous know-it-all\" tells him his sister is \"a nut job,\" and Eve asks both of them to stop so they can work together to help Maddie before she hurts herself, or someone else.\n\n\nBarbara shows up at Will and Gwen's place and tells him about her conversation with Gwen. Barbara tells Will that they need to do some damage control and that she's already started, by planting the idea in Gwen's mind that Jade manipulated both of them from the beginning. Will becomes angry, telling Barbara this was all his fault and he doesn't want to pin all the blame on Jade and play games with Gwen like that. He asks Barbara to leave, which she does.\n\n\nAt Crash, Maddie approaches Gwen angrily and asks what she's doing with Casey. She tells Gwen she overheard her talking to Casey about moving in with him and says that just because she and Casey broke up doesn't mean Gwen \"gets\" Casey. She then tells Gwen she'd better stay away from Casey or she might end up dead like Lia. Gwen leaves, and Jade walks in and tells Maddie that people are out to get her because she ruined Will and Gwen's marriage; Maddie says if anyone needs to be \"punished,\" it's Jade. She tells Jade that it's Jade's fault that Gwen and Casey are now a couple, telling her she saw them hugging and heard them talking about Gwen going home with Casey; Jade tries to tell her there's another explanation for all of that, but Maddie doesn't listen, telling Jade it's wrong and it's not going to happen. Jade tells Maddie not to make trouble, and hearing that, Maddie flashes back to a man's voice telling her the same thing; she runs out of Crash without any explanation.\n\n\nAt Java, Luke asks Jade what she means when she says, \"Gwen won't be around much longer,\" telling her that's an odd thing to say with a murderer on the loose. Jade tells Luke that's not what she meant and wants to know why one minute, he's asking her for a favor and the next, he's on her case. Luke thanks her for agreeing to keep him posted about Lily's condition, but he suggests she learn to butt out of other people's business while he's gone. Holden arrives to meet Luke, and Jade leaves. Luke tells Holden that he and Damian are flying to Malta tonight. Holden is upset to hear this but says that it's like when Luke told Lily and him about being gay: he was taking control of his own life, and Holden respects that. Luke manages a choked-up goodbye, and after embracing his father, he leaves. Holden gets on the phone and asks Jack to meet him right away. When Jack arrives, Holden asks him to somehow help stop Damian from leaving the country tonight, so that Holden can find out why Damian really wants Luke to go to Malta. Jack agrees to do what he can to help, provided it doesn't get him in any more trouble at the police department.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Damian tells Lucy he knows she tried to drug him and that he'll have to ensure she can't tell anyone else about her \"diagnosis\" that his medical condition is being faked. As Lucy begins to feel faint, she realizes that Damian switched the tea cups, and he has now drugged her. As she collapses, he picks her up and carries her down to the wine cellar. Upstairs, Dusty comes in and finds a syringe and a tea cup lying on the floor, and when Damian walks back into the room, he demands to know where Lucy is. After Damian tells him to go away, Dusty pretends to leave, but he returns and sneaks down to the wine cellar, where he finds Lucy. Before he can rescue her, Sergio appears with a gun, and he ties up both Dusty and Lucy and then leaves. Lucy yells for Luke, but assuming he won't hear her, she turns to Dusty and says, \"It's like old times, isn't it?\" Meanwhile, upstairs, Luke has returned; he asks Damian where Lucy is, because she promised to stay to say goodbye to him, and Damian makes it sound like she was called back to the hospital. When Luke calls the hospital, he's told that Lucy's not on duty today, and he gets angry when Damian tries to tell him they don't have time to track Lucy down; Damian reacts to Luke's anger by looking like he's feeling ill, which makes Luke feel guilty. He tells Damian it's not that important for him to find Lucy, and they get ready to leave for Malta.\n\n\nGwen goes home to pack her things; Will hopes she's there to talk things over, but as he tries to explain to her how things happened between him and Jade, Gwen becomes upset and tells him she can't talk about that right now, that she's moving out. Will says he doesn't want to lose her; she says she doesn't want to lose him, either, but she thinks it's already happened. When Will asks where she'll go, Casey walks in and tells Will that Gwen is going home with him. Will becomes angry, saying Gwen apparently has been able to forgive Casey but can't seem to do the same for him. Thinking this means that Gwen and Casey are becoming a new couple, he tells them to stay at the house, and he'll leave; Casey responds by saying, \"While you're gone, if you could ... I don't know ... grow up? That'd be good.\" Will storms out, and Gwen starts crying, telling Casey she's a loser. Casey objects to that and tells her Will's big problem is that he never thinks anything is his fault; Gwen asks him not to disparage Will, even if he thinks it will make her feel better, because it doesn't help. He promises not to do it again and suggests they leave. Gwen realizes she's packed all the wrong things, so Casey offers to go in the bedroom and grab more things out of the closet for her. Someone outside opens the window and climbs in, wearing dark clothing and carrying a knife. The person approaches Casey from behind and hits him on the head, knocking him out, then goes into the living room and hits Gwen when she turns around, knocking her down; the attacker then straddles Gwen, holding the butcher knife over her chest.\n\n\n",
