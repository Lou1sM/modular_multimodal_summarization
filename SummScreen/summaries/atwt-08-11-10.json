A blissful Lucy claimed she'd dreamed of their reunion while she'd been away. The reticent Dusty mentioned his meeting again, and she asked if they were okay. \"More than okay,\" he assured her. With a kiss, he asked her to close the door on her way out.\n\n\nLater, Craig entered in his room to find Lucy there. She said that he could greet her, or have her arrested. Craig hugged her instead. Suspicious due to Sierra's last visit, he asked if Lucy planned to take Johnny, or do Lucinda's bidding. Lucy said Johnny seemed content with his father, and she was there visiting her family, not carrying out one of Lucinda's plots.\n\n\nJohnny arrived with a scrape because a man had bumped into him in the park. Craig lit into the nanny about it, but Lucy calmed him down. She arranged to visit Johnny later, and she left. Craig questioned Johnny about the man who'd knocked him down, but Johnny didn't remember what he'd looked like.\n\n\nAt Metro, Teri quickly gathered that Dusty wasn't interested in discussing the drink menu. She turned the topic to Janet, and he said Janet was busy with Blackthorn. Teri called Blackie and Janet old friends. \"Well, they're acting very friendly,\" Dusty concluded. Teri thought Dusty misunderstood the friendship, but he said he didn't misunderstand making out. \n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Blackthorn asked Janet for coffee with forgiveness on the side. Janet preferred to forget about the kiss, but he longed to do it again. He claimed that he'd been in love with her since they were kids, but she insisted that they'd only be friends.\n\n\nJanet assured Blackthorn that she and Dusty loved each other, but the situation was complicated. Blackthorn called Dusty a punk for not stepping up, but she claimed that she'd forced Dusty to put everything on hold until the baby arrived. Blackthorn still thought he was the best man for her, but he promised not to push if she'd agree to keep him in her heart and mind.\n\n\nBlackthorn tried to coax Janet into having lunch, but she shooed him out of the diner. At the door, he encountered Teri and remarked that he planned to stick around for a long time. He left, and Teri asked her sister \"what the hell\" she was doing. Janet called Blackthorn a flirt, but Teri said to clarify it with Dusty because, \"he thinks you and Blackie are hooking up.\"\n\n\nJanet looked guilty, and Teri exclaimed that Dusty had been right about Janet kissing Blackthorn. Teri explained that Dusty had attempted to visit Janet when he'd seen the kiss. Both men were driving Janet nuts, and she just wanted time to think. \"Do you want Dusty?\" Teri asked. She guaranteed that Janet would lose him if she didn't make him feel wanted fast. \n\n\nAs Janet discussed her hectic life, she decided that she wanted Dusty to raise the baby with her. She realized that she'd been unfair to blame him for Rocco's death. Teri urged Janet to reach out to Dusty, but Janet didn't know how. Teri suggested that she do it with food, and Janet decided to take him a tray of lasagna. Teri was sure it'd lead to a happy ending. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty was surprised to see Lucy back in his room, but said he was always welcomed. She touted that Craig trusted her to take Johnny out. She hoped that Dusty would soon trust her, too\u2014with everything. Lucy was willing to wait, but Dusty said he was sick of waiting. As he lured her to the bed, she asked if he were doing it because of Janet. \"Does it matter?\" he asked. After pondering it, she kissed him.\n\n\nOutside the room, Janet arrived with a pan of lasagna. She used her own key to open the door, and her face blanched when she saw Dusty in bed with Lucy.\n\n\nAt the farm, Holden ended a phone call with Molly as Jack entered. Holden said that he didn't regret going to France, despite the repercussions, because he'd learned that Craig, who'd also been in France, had somehow involved himself in Carly and Lily's business. Jack grew concerned, but Holden warned Jack not to let it ruin his love life, as it had ruined Holden's.\n\n\nJack tracked Craig down at a meeting in the Lakeview lounge. Craig was trying to get credit from a banker until Jack blurted out that Craig had financial troubles. When Craig pulled Jack aside, Jack wondered whose money Craig had blown through, Carly's or Lily's. \n\n\nCraig concluded the meeting with banker, but refused to talk to Jack unless he had an arrest warrant. Jack threatened to snoop into Craig's affairs, and Craig decided to suffer Jack's questions. When Jack brought up Carlisle, Craig called him jealous. Jack conjectured that Craig was behind Carly and Lily's business troubles. \"Go to hell,\" Craig said and strode off.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Lily arrived, feeling guilty about Molly's wedding. Carly didn't blame Lily, because Molly had chosen not to fight for her man. Assuming that Lily and Holden would reunite, Carly said it was better than Lily being with Craig. An indignant Lily asked who'd said anything about reuniting with Holden or disavowing Craig, who'd been a Godsend in France. \n\n\nInstantly livid, Carly demanded to know what Craig had to do with their company. Lily confessed to working with Craig, but she said that was nothing compared to what she'd discovered in France. Lily revealed that Fran\u00e7oise was a fraud, and the perfume factory didn't exist. Carly blamed Craig, but Lily called him the biggest victim of all, because he'd been the silent investor who'd put up all the money they'd lost.\n\n\nBoiling with anger over Lily's deception, Carly didn't believe Craig's so-called good will toward her after the Monte Carlo incident. Carly figured that Jack would never buy that Carly hadn't purposefully gotten entangled with Craig. Carly wondered who'd set them up, and Lily insisted that it hadn't been Craig. Carly warned Lily to prepare for another hit, because Craig would strike when one least expected it.\n\n\nAt the police station, Carly rushed to spill her guts to Jack about the perfume business before anyone else told him. Certain that he'd think the worst of her, she implored him to believe that she hadn't known anything about Craig's involvement in the perfume business. Jack wondered why he wouldn't believe her. \"Because you never do?\" Carly proffered. He claimed that he always believed her, but then he restated that he believed her that time. \n\n\nA relieved Carly started to leave, but Jack asked her to tell him what had occurred. She informed him about the fake factory, and she assumed that Craig had orchestrated it to somehow get closer to her. Jack confessed that he'd confronted Craig, because he'd wanted to ensure that Craig understood that Carly wanted him out of her life. Carly was flattered by the gesture, and Jack uttered that he was nuts about her. \"Don't you know?\" he asked. \n\n\nCarly was glad that she hadn't lost any money\u2014just herself respect and her career. \"I don't even have you,\" she added, pouting. He declared that she did have him. Carly asked if he'd be happy having \"all me, all the time,\" but no career. He asked if she'd be naked the whole time. She chuckled at the thought of having \"all you, naked all the time.\"\n\n\nJack and Carly discussed Craig's motives for his involvement with Carlisle. Jack considered that it had something to do with Blackthorn, and Jack planned to get to the bottom of it, because he wouldn't let anyone hurt or use Carly again. Since Carly couldn't sit around waiting for all the answers, she proposed that he tackle Blackthorn while she worked Craig. Realizing that it was important to her, Jack agreed. \"We're a team,\" she said, grinning.\n\n\nIn Old Town later, Craig confronted Blackthorn about being cowardly enough to go after a child. Blackthorn denied touching the boy and said he only wanted his money. Craig warned that if Blackthorn laid a hand on Johnny, Craig would show Blackthorn what payback was all about. As the men exchanged threats, Carly spied on them from behind a wall.\n\n\nAt the farm, Lily found Holden packing Molly's belongings. Lily blamed herself for botching the wedding, but Holden said that everyone was adult enough to make his own choices. Lily thought Holden ought to be trying harder to get Molly back, because he'd only been acting out of concern. Holden said Molly had suspected that it had been more than that, and he was starting to realize that Molly might be right.\n\n\nLily assumed that Molly had underestimated his love for her and overestimated his love for Lily. Lily claimed that he would've done the same thing for Molly, but he replied that he would have asked Lily first. He hadn't asked Molly, because he hadn't wanted to be talked out of it. He said that was the difference between Lily and Molly.\n\n\nLily asked what he meant, and when he tried to avoid explaining, she persisted. He stated that even though Lily wouldn't have wanted him to go, they would have debated it and made love. He said that if he'd prevailed and boarded the plane...\" I'd be sitting beside you,\" Lily concluded. Grinning, Holden said that was the difference between Lily and Molly.\n\n\nAs they packed Molly's things, Lily remarked that she was sick of appearing to be needy. Holden, however, asserted that she liked it. He pointed out that she'd set out to be independent with the perfume business, but the whole time, she'd leaned on Craig. Holden said she was way too trusting, but then he decided to stay out of it. Lily thanked him for caring, and he said he always would. Hugging her, he stated that she wouldn't need rescuing if she avoided Craig.\n\n\n",
