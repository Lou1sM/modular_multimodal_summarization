Julia said she knew what it was like to be the new stranger in town - even though she didn't know what it was like to have no memory of her life before. Julia went into Jack's room. He was looking at his wedding ring. It had triggered him to remember a song. He sang the song and Julia joined in. He was surprised she knew then song but she said it was popular. Julia told him to keep singing. She thought it might help to jog his memory. Jack said he couldn't believe how beautiful Julia is. Jack noticed that Julia had an indentation on her finger where a ring used to be. He asked Julia why she wasn't wearing her ring. Julia hedged by telling Jack that he should check his own ring - maybe it might have an inscription that give them a clue to his identity. Jack read the engraving. It said \"To Jack, forever.\" Julia mentioned that she had something engraved on her own ring but didn't say what.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Oakdale Carly arrived at Fairwinds with Parker in tow. She wanted to talk with Rosanna so Paul took Parker out to play. Carly was glad to see Rosanna looking so happy. Carly broke down in tears and Rosanna tried to comfort her. Carly apologized for crying and told Ro to treasure every moment she has with Paul. Carly asked Ro if she was in love with Paul. Ro replied that she felt more herself with Paul than anyone she had ever been with. Carly noted that it was ironic that they came together because of James Steinbeck. Who would have ever believed James could play matchmaker? \n\n\nWith romance in mind, Carly read the inscription on her ring. It said \"To Carly, forever\", much like Jack's. Carly told Ro that before Jack died they had talked about having more children. She wondered if she should have a memorial service to honor her husband. Paul came into the room. He said that the sprinklers had come on while he was playing with Parker so the little boy was being cleaned up by the nanny. Paul said that Parker is talking as if he expects Jack to be home the next day. Carly said that her son refuses to believe Jack is dead and makes her set a place for Jack every night at the dinner table. Paul said that Parker was hoping that Jack would be home for the little league game he had coming up. Paul said he would be happy to coach Parker. Carly was touched by his gesture of friendship. Carly left Fairwinds with Parker. Paul made Rosanna laugh when he admitted that he throws like a girl. She said she loved him and they kissed. \n\n\nAt Lucinda's house, Craig told Lily that Sierra had found evidence of Alan's part in the kidnapping and was afraid she would buy into Dusty's theory that Craig had set up Mr. Drake. Nikki arrived with Dusty to take Craig and Lily's statement. Craig was upset to see the other man. \"Why are you so nervous, Craig?\" Dusty asked. Nikki and Lily went to the guest house to see Sierra. Sierra gave Nikki the evidence about the kidnapping she had found. When Nikki left, Lily tried to comfort Sierra. Sierra found a letter from Alan that was written before he went to take the ransom to Wade. In it, he said that he was going to bring Lucy home and that he loved Sierra very much. Sierra refused to believe that Alan had been behind the kidnapping.\n\n\nBack at Lucinda's, Dusty and Craig were arguing. Lucy walked into the room and demanded that they stop fighting. She pulled Dusty aside and told him that she really cared about him and if he cared about her he would drop the accusations about her father.  \n\n\n\"You are wrong about my dad,\" said Lucy.\n\n\nBarbara listened to a tape that James had sent to her. On the tape, James threatened to hurt Will if Barbara didn't follow his instructions to a T. Barbara called the hospital to check on Will and found out he was fine. She wanted him to stay fine so she called and arranged for a helicopter to pick up James.\n\n\nJames was in the bus on the way to another prison when he said he had to use the bathroom. The officers in charge of him were hesitant to stop the bus, but eventually gave in. After using the facilities, James got back onto the bus. He complained about the heat and collapsed on the floor. He then began to fake convulsions. James pretended to be passed out. When the guards came over to him, he grabbed one of their guns and shot the guards. He went outside the bus where a helicopter was waiting. He climbed into the passenger seat and called Babs to gloat that he was free. When she demanded to know where he was going, he hung up the phone. Then he turned to the pilot and told him to take James back to Oakdale. \n\n\n",
