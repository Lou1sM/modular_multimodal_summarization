Katie asked Mike why he had changed his mind about them not seeing each other right now, and he said it was because Katie was \"home\" to him. They kissed, and Maddie walked up in time to watch the kiss. Maddie managed to get the desk clerk away from the desk and went back there herself and somehow messed up the hotel's computer system. When the desk clerk came back and Mike asked for a room, the clerk found that the system was saying no rooms were available, even though he knew that wasn't true. He told Mike and Katie it might take a while to fix the computer system and book a room for them. In the meantime, Maddie made her presence known and claimed to be there getting olives for Henry. She offered to give Katie a ride in the limo back to the cottage, but Katie said she needed to run some errands. Maddie said she would run the errands for her so that Katie could get home sooner. Mike and Katie gave up the idea of spending the evening together, and Katie left with Maddie.\n\n\nAt Emma's house, Meg offered Dusty a taste of the sauce she'd made for the quail she was cooking, Dusty discovered it was incredibly over-spiced. Meg then opened the oven door to find that the quail was very overcooked, so dinner was ruined. Dusty then said that he would cook something. Meg was impressed with Dusty's cooking ability and said she wished she had a talent like that. Dusty told her that her talent was making people feel good, and that she had done that for him that night, because he'd been in a bad place when he arrived for dinner. He kissed her and told her that she was an angel.\n\n\nJennifer wanted to know what Paul knew that might change her life, but Paul just asked, \"Would you trade a few good days for a lifetime of pain?\" Jennifer didn't understand what he was talking about. She saw the baby's footprint and asked if this was about her baby. Paul told her that he'd heard that Rosanna had had a seizure and would never recover; Jennifer told him how sorry she was. Paul told her it was all Craig's fault and that the only good thing that had happened as a result was that Craig was in prison and wouldn't be able to hurt Rosanna or Jennifer any more. He promised Jennifer that he'd never let Craig hurt her again. Jennifer didn't believe that this was why Paul had called her to come over to his place. Emily arrived and told Paul that they needed to get ready; when he asked where they were going, she reminded him about the christening, and Jennifer wanted to know whose christening they were going to. Paul told her that Carly had asked them to be Rosanna's baby's godparents. He told Jennifer that he was sorry, and she said she was sick of people telling her how sorry they were. Paul promised her that things would get better, and then they left.\n\n\nIris went to Jack and Carly's house to tell him that he and Carly shouldn't go digging into the past anymore, because she didn't want any trouble. Jack wanted to know how she could get in trouble, since she said it was Carly's fault that her baby had died. Iris said that Carly might ask Jack to prove it never happened or something, and she burst into tears and said she couldn't stand to live through it all again. Jack assured her that the last thing any of them wanted was for Iris and Carly to have to live through that experience again.\n\n\nJennifer went to Al's Diner, and while she was sitting there by herself, Iris walked in and asked for a drink. The waitress told her they didn't serve alcohol, so Iris asked for a ginger ale and then poured liquor in it from a flask that she took out of her purse. She saw Jennifer looking at her, and she told her that she knew what she was thinking, that she was a pathetic old drunk, but also that maybe she wouldn't mind a shot of that herself. Jennifer apologized for making Iris feel judged, and Iris said she could take that, she just couldn't take the memories of losing her baby boy. Jennifer got up and joined Iris at her table and told her that she had lost her baby boy, too. Iris asked what had happened to her baby, and Jennifer told her he'd been born too small, too early, and not at the hospital. Iris said that was the same thing that had happened to her boy, which amazed Jennifer. Jennifer told Iris that even all the modern technology at the hospital hadn't been able to save her son, and all she had of her baby was his ID band. Iris poured Jennifer a drink and told her she needed it after all. Jennifer told Iris that she still felt a connection to her baby, like he was alive and was somewhere nearby. \n\n\nEarlier at the diner, Will came to see Gwen, who told him about Jack's visit and his offer of a compromise concerning her baby. Will told her that Jack was a good guy and was his dad's best friend, and that Carly could be pushy when she felt she needed to be, just like someone else he knew. He thought that Gwen should trust Jack; Gwen said the only person she'd ever trusted was Will, but that had turned out pretty well so far. She asked Will to go with her to the Snyder's house, and he agreed. When they got there, though, the nurse told them that the Snyders were at the baby's christening. Will and Gwen took off for the church.\n\n\nAt the church, Parker told Carly the minister needed to talk to her for a minute and that he could watch the baby; Carly said okay, but then she had a flashback to Iris telling her to watch the baby, and she decided to stay with the baby herself. Parker asked if Rosanna knew where her baby was now, and Carly said yes, that she had promised Rosanna that they would take good care of her baby, no matter what. Paul and Emily arrived for the christening, and after the minister said some very moving words about Rosanna, he asked what the baby's name would be. Carly said, \"Rory Cabot --- after his mom.\" At that moment, Gwen and Will burst into the church, and Gwen shouted, \"Stop! They've got no right to name that baby! He's mine!\" Carly lunged for her, and Gwen lunged towards Carly, but Jack and Will held them both back. Carly insulted Gwen, telling her she'd given up the baby until she found out about Rosanna's money, and Gwen told Carly that she didn't care about the money, she just wanted her baby. Paul and Emily took the baby and Parker and JJ out of the church. When Gwen told Carly that she had 30 days to change her mind and that she was changing it and was going to take her baby back, Carly snarled, \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\nOutside the church, Paul told the baby that he was sorry, but things would be much worse if he were with his real mom and dad, and that this was his only chance at real happiness. Emily walked up and wanted to know what Paul was talking about, and he said he was sorry about the mess inside the church. Paul gave her the baby and walked further outside, where he ran into Jennifer, who told him she had felt compelled to come to the christening. When the baby cried, Jennifer said, \"That's him! That's my baby!\" \n\n\n\n\n",
