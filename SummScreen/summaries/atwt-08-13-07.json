He later comes too briefly and almost kisses Katie and asks her if he would have a chance if Jack wasn't in the picture. Katie cuts him off pointing out that Jack IS in her life and that's not changing. He passes out again and Katie leaves Jack another message, asking him to call her. \n\n\nWill and Gwen clean up after the party and then talk about the sonogram. Gwen gets a craving for ice cream so they head to Al's where they are surprised by Iris, who has returned to town. She quickly figures out that her daughter is pregnant and can't wait to be a grandma but Gwen and Will don't want her to have anything to do with the baby as she was such a terrible mother to Gwen. Gwen wishes she had had a proper mom growing up and during her pregnancies. Outside the diner, Iris calls someone and leaves a message that she is now back in Oakdale. \n\n\nAaron and Sofie talk about her problems with her boyfriend Cole. She explains he's a music writer who needs a second job at a gas station to support himself which makes him edgy. She plans a picnic dinner to cheer him up and Aaron escorts to Old Town to deliver it. Cole brushes her off as he wants to work on a song instead. He yells at her being selfish and not understanding him. Aaron steps in to stand up for Sofie. Cole threatens to hit Aaron. \n\n\nWhen Kit learns Silas has kidnapped JJ she kicks them out until they explain the situation. She gives them keys to another remote place but reminds them that if they are caught she's never met them. \n\n\nJack and Carly, still tied up in Kit's old place, try to free themselves. Jack manages to get a pin to Carly who fiddles with the handcuffs. They are interrupted by Silas who explains that he's going to raise JJ to repay his debt to Les. Jack points out that Les was abusive to JJ and his mother. Silas spits back that Les was a good man and Jack will pay for killing him. He then gets a gas can and pours it all around. He then tells them to settle things with their maker and tosses a lighter into the liquid, setting the place on fire. Jack tries to calm Carly down so she can work on the handcuffs. She eventually manages to free herself but must drag a passed out Jack from the cabin just before it explodes. The explosion gets the cops' attention as well as Jack's FBI contact. The paramedics take Jack away but not before he asks Carly to return home to be safe for their kids' sake. She refuses, insisting that she will get JJ back and reunite their family.  \n\n\n",
