Chris came into her room to talk to her before she left and offered to give her a ride home. Alison thanked Chris for all he did to save her and explained she wanted to check on Aaron before she left for home. \n\n\nLily came to visit Aaron at the hospital and was met by Holden, who was surprised to see her. Lily was upset no one had phoned her to tell her about Aaron's shooting and was relieved when she learned he would be fine. Holden took Lily into Aaron's room to see for herself that he was getting better. Aaron was still groggy, but joked that his getting shot had brought Lily and Holden back together. Lily and Holden put on a happy face in front of Aaron, but were both uncomfortable when Aaron urged them to work out their problems before it was too late. When Alison arrived to check on Aaron, Lily and Holden left to have coffee together at Java and discuss Aaron's recovery. \n\n\nAlison was happy to see that Aaron was recuperating from his gunshot wound, but she did not want to overstay her visit and make Aaron tired, so she got up to leave. Aaron grabbed her hand and told Alison he still loved her. Aaron explained he would always love her and needed her to know. Alison was surprised by Aaron's declaration and seemed confused about her own feelings toward him. She told Aaron to get some rest, and left. Out in the hall, Chris offered to drive Alison home, but she told him she needed to stay around a little longer. Chris worried that Alison was afraid to be alone with him, but Alison explained she just was not ready to leave. \n\n\nOnce Lily and Holden arrived at Java, Holden asked Lily if she would be willing to help Aaron with his recovery. Lily was happy to help, but was afraid it would be awkward running into Holden at the farm. Holden explained he had taken a room at the Lakeview and Lily was quickly annoyed with the news that Holden had begun staying in a hotel. Lily was convinced Holden had moved so he could be closer to Carly. Holden denied the move had anything to do with Carly, but Lily was not convinced and wanted to move forward with their divorce. \n\n\nAt home, Carly got a visit from Neal, who wanted to know if Carly was still seeing Holden. When Carly admitted that she and Holden were no longer together, Neal hoped that he could have another chance with her. Carly agreed to have lunch with Neal, but their conversation was quickly interrupted when Neal got a call from Mike. Mike told Neal that there was a problem with the Snyder project and he needed to meet with Neal right away. Neal asked Mike to meet him at the Lakeview and then asked Carly if she would mind meeting him a little later for lunch so he could take care of business. Carly graciously agreed and Neal left for his meeting. \n\n\nNeal met with Mike and learned their entire project was in danger of coming to a disastrous end because of toxins in the soils around the farm. Mike said they would know more once they did more testing, but Neal wanted his London office to look over the findings and left to fax them the reports. Soon Carly arrived for her date, but found Mike at Neal's table. Mike wanted to know if Carly was able to get Lily and Holden back together. Carly explained her attempt at reuniting Lily and Holden had failed and she was sure their divorce was moving forward. When Neal returned, Mike left Neal and Carly to enjoy their lunch. \n\n\nNeal and Carly spoke over lunch about their chances at a relationship. Neal said he was happy to let Carly set the pace of their relationship, but Carly was not convinced she was ready to start dating again. Just as Neal was asking Carly what was holding her back, Holden walked into the Lakeview. Neal caught sight of Holden and noticed Carly's interest in him suddenly change. Holden left once he saw the two together and headed up to his room. Moments later, Neal received a phone call and had to leave to take care of business. Carly phoned Holden to ask why he had stormed out and learned that Holden was upset about Aaron's shooting. \n\n\nCarly was concerned about Holden and went to his room to make sure he was all right. Holden invited her in and Carly asked if she could help with Aaron's recovery. Carly offered to listen to Holden if he needed to talk to someone. Holden complained his life was falling apart around him and realized he had no one to blame but himself. When Holden suggested that he and Carly could comfort one another, Carly felt it was time for her to go. Holden begged Carly to stay and tell him why she had really come to his room. Carly admitted she still cared for him and wanted to make sure he was okay. Holden explained his marriage was over and he did not want to pretend anymore that he did not care for Carly. He told her he wanted to be with her and the two began to kiss passionately. Suddenly, Carly stopped Holden and said she could not be the reason his marriage to Lily ended. She walked out. \n\n\nAfter her argument with Holden, Lily returned home and found Mike checking on the work at her house. Lily invited Mike in and he asked her how she was doing. Lily realized Mike had come to check on her and was grateful to have his friendship. Lily and Mike discussed Lily's marriage troubles and Lily admitted she did not understand why Holden could not get over Carly. Mike told Lily she was a beautiful woman with a lot to offer. When Lily passed Mike some paperwork for the farm project, their hands touched and the two finally gave in to their attraction for one another and began kissing. Lily and Mike made their way to the couch, where Mike asked Lily if she was sure she wanted to make love. Lily said she was certain she wanted to be with him and the two began to take off one another's clothes. \n\n\nEmily left the hospital and returned to work at the Intruder to write a story about Rick Decker. Casey arrived at her office and began to question why Emily was suddenly shutting him out of her life. Emily explained that the toxin Rick had poisoned her with had made her irrational and that was the only reason she had married Casey. She tried to make him understand that she was not ready to be married again. Casey tried to convince Emily that they loved one another enough to make their marriage work despite all of their differences. Emily refused to change her mind and told Casey she wanted an annulment. Frustrated by Emily's lack of faith in their relationship, Casey stormed out. \n\n\nCasey went to the hospital to check on his dad and told Chris about his problems with Emily. Chris advised Casey to be happy with Emily and not worry about a piece of paper. \n\n\nCasey took Chris's advice and returned to Emily's office. He told her that he would annul their marriage if that were what she really wanted. Emily tearfully admitted she was willing to give their marriage another try. Casey was happy to hear Emily had changed her mind, but told her that he wanted to annul the marriage and try to just be happy together. He said that if things worked out, they could have a big wedding soon enough. The two celebrated their happiness by making love in Emily's office.\n\n\n",
