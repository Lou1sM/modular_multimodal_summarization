They talked about visiting the Adriatic coast some day, but they decided it was more practical to go skinny dipping in the Snyder pond.  Meg was surprised to find Faith inside, and the girl flashed back to seeing Damian and her mother in a passionate embrace.  Meg took Eliza upstairs, and Faith asked Damian if her Aunt Meg was his girlfriend.  She also asked if there was someone he liked even better.  When Meg returned downstairs, Faith took off.\n\n\nDamian said he thought that they should still go on the cruise and take baby Eliza with them.  He suggested that they fly to New York that afternoon and still catch the ship.  Meg was delighted, and said that she could be ready in half an hour.  Damian had an errand to run, as well, so they agreed to meet back at the farm then.\n\n\nLily looked at a photo of her and Holden and then answered a call from him.  He was en route to Louisville and wanted to know if Faith had agreed to the family vacation plan yet.  Lily said their daughter was still in the \"grip of an adolescent funk,\" and she had gone to the farm to ride.  The phone connection got spotty, and Holden promised to call her back.  He did that, and he told Lily how much he would like to have the family join him.  Holden noticed a state policeman ahead who was flagging him down, so he told Lily that he would check in with her later.\n\n\nHolden stopped by the Kentucky state patrolman and noticed that he had a bloody shoulder.  The cop ordered Holden to open the passenger door, and when Holden did, the man jumped in and pulled a gun.  He aimed the pistol at Holden and ordered him to drive.  The man turned on the radio, which precluded any conversation, and before long a news bulletin announced that a Bingham Skaggs, who was serving a life sentence for murder, had escaped in a hail of gunfire in which Skaggs had killed an officer.  He was to be considered armed and dangerous.\n\n\nHolden attempted to talk the felon into turning himself in, but Skaggs responded that if Skaggs didn't have a bullet in his shoulder, Holden would have been dead the second that he opened the door.  Holden kept driving, but suddenly he realized that his passenger had passed out.  Holden reached for his phone, but Skaggs woke up, pointed the gun at Holden again, and told him to pull over.\n\n\nMargo found Tom making brunch at home, but she realized that he was buttering her up because she was so upset that he had asked Riley to leave their house.  Margo was not happy that Tom had made a unilateral decision.  Tom answered his phone, and Casey informed his dad that Kim had suffered a heart attack and was in Memorial Hospital.  Tom asked if Bob was there, but Casey said his grandfather had not answered his page yet.  Casey spoke with Alison, who told him that no one had seen Dr. Bob.  Margo and Tom rushed to the hospital.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Riley showed Bob how to work his pager, but Bob felt no urgency in returning to the hospital, and, in fact, seemed unsure of how to get there.  Riley offered to walk him back to the hospital, and Bob was grateful.  When they walked into the hospital, everyone told Bob what had happened to Kim, and Bob rushed into his wife's room.  Casey spoke to Alison and learned that she had been talking to Kim when Kim had suffered the attack.  Riley listened to the conversation, as Casey argued with Alison about ratting out his grandfather.  Riley finally jumped in and told Casey that he had been the one who had suggested that Alison talk to someone about Bob's unusual behavior.\n\n\nCasey was upset that his girlfriend had listened to Riley instead of him, and he berated them both for not staying out of it.  Casey reverted back to his usual way of dealing with a crisis: he ran off.  Riley consoled Alison by assuring her that the situation was not her fault.  Margo and Riley hugged, just as Tom exited Kim's room and saw them.  Tom asked Riley why he was there, and Riley explained that he had walked there with Bob.  Both Tom and Margo suggested that Riley leave the family alone.\n\n\nFaith went home, and Lily asked what was bothering her.  Faith asked if her mother knew that Damian and Aunt Meg were \"together,\" and wanted to know if that bothered her.  Lily wondered why Faith was asking such a question about Lily's ex-husband, but she answered that it was okay with her that Damian was seeing someone else.  Faith went upstairs as the doorbell rang.  The visitor was Damian, so he and Lily went outside to talk.\n\n\n Damian said that he and Meg were leaving for New York very soon and they were going on the cruise, after all.  Lily wished him bon voyage, but Damian said that he would not go if Lily could tell him that she was still in love with him. Lily repeated that she loved Holden and was committed to her family.  Damian said that he would not bother her again, and he walked out.\n\n\nIn Kim's hospital room, Bob read his wife's blood pressure as 150/100 and ordered another dose of heparin to prevent blood clots.  Alison offered to do it, but Bob said that he preferred that another nurse take over the case instead of Alison.  Alison left the room, and Casey intercepted her in the hall and suggested that another nurse would be better for everyone.  Kim woke up and said that she felt tired and that her chest hurt.  Bob said that she needed to rest, and he advised the family to go home and try to relax.  He said it was his place to stay with his wife.\n\n\nTom and Margo went home, and Tom went to take some aspirin and chill out.  Casey also returned, and Margo remarked on the tension she had observed between Casey and Alison.  Casey was still upset with Riley, who, he said, had given Alison some stupid advice that she had followed.  He complained that even though Riley didn't live there anymore, he was still \"screwing up things\" with their family.\n\n\nRiley knocked on the door, and Tom answered it.  Riley wanted to see Casey, and the first thing he did to him was to call Casey \"such an ass.\"  He said that Casey had no right to talk to Alison the way he had, and Casey fired back and told Riley to back off or he would tell everyone in Oakdale, including Tom, that Riley was really Adam.\n\n\nRiley went to Al's to have coffee, and he saw Alison walking by.  He caught up with her, and she explained that Dr. Hughes had ordered her off Kim's case.  Alison blamed herself for Kim's heart attack, but Riley gave her a pep talk.  He told her about bumping into Bob in Old Town and how confused and distracted he had appeared.\n\n\nBob continued to monitor Kim, and at one point he got up to check her machines.  He looked at the heparin dosage control and fiddled with the dial.  Alison opened the door and asked to speak with him, so the two of them went into the hall.  Alison said that she was afraid that she had been at least partly responsible for what happened to Kim.  She explained how she had been talking to Kim when Kim had collapsed, but Bob was very understanding.  He told Alison that his wife had a previous heart condition, aortic stenosis, and that Alison had called the paramedics and administered the CPR that had probably saved his wife's life.\n\n\nAlison thanked Bob for his kind words, and then she walked by Kim's room and heard an alarm beeping inside.  She ran in and looked at the machine and immediately yelled for help.  Kim's blood pressure was 55/40, and she was in shock.  Bob rushed in with a senior nurse and checked the chart.  He saw no order for the excessive dose of heparin that Kim was receiving, and it appeared to them that Kim was bleeding out.  Bob ordered some lab tests and another drug, and asked Alison who had been in the room last.  Alison said that he, himself, had been the last one in there.\n\n\nAt the farm, Meg wasn't quite ready to go when Damian arrived.  He said that he had gone to see Lily so that there would be no misunderstandings between them.  Meg did not understand why such a visit was necessary, but Damian revealed that the trip with Meg was a big step in their relationship, with no turning back, and he wanted Lily to know that he was with Meg and no one else, from that moment on.\n\n\nFaith went outside and spoke with Lily.  When she found out that Damian and Meg were going away together, Faith said that she wanted very much to go on the family vacation and meet up with her dad.  The girl went upstairs to pack, and Lily went inside.  She was stunned to find the photo of her and Holden smashed on the floor.\n\n\nHolden stopped his pickup and attempted to convince his captor to talk with him.  Skaggs ordered him out of the truck, and Holden obliged.  They were at a farm, and Skaggs demanded that Holden switch clothes with him.  He also took Holden's wallet, watch, and wedding ring, and he made Holden put on the state police uniform.  They got back into the truck and began driving again.  Holden offered once more to intercede on Skaggs's behalf with the authorities, but the convict turned him down.\n\n\nHolden was desperate, and he began swerving the truck from one side of the road to the other.  They went off the road and across a clear patch of ground as both men struggled for control.  Before either man noticed, the truck sailed over the edge of a steep canyon and rolled over and over until it crashed at the bottom, and burst into a great fireball.\n\n\n",
