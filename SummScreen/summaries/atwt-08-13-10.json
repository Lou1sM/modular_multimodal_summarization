    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the farm, Janet tried to throw Dusty out, but he cited that he wasn't one of the guys who'd disappeared while claiming to love her. She retorted that he was the guy who'd slept with someone else while professing his love. He figured that it wouldn't have happened if she'd married him, but it wasn't too late. \"I can't stop loving you. So take it or leave it,\" he said.\n\n\nJanet was boggled by his insistence that she just forget about what he'd done. As they argued, Liberty strode in and said that the tension wasn't good for the baby. Janet agreed, because the baby was the most important thing. \"So you can take that or leave it,\" she told Dusty. He said that it wasn't over-unless she wanted it to be.\n\n\nDusty left, and Janet slammed pots and pans around until Liberty got her to reveal that Dusty had slept with \"the little princess.\" Janet reasoned that she had precipitated it by pushing him away and getting pregnant, but Liberty said Janet had done it to save Liberty's life. \"You're right. I didn't do anything wrong. He did!\" Janet concluded and said good riddance to Dusty.\n\n\nLater, Blackthorn called Janet, because he'd been worried after not seeing her at the diner. Noting that she still sounded upset with him, he apologized again for the kiss. She claimed that she wasn't angry with him, and he offered to visit her. Though she refused, he said he'd be at the Lakeview, if she changed her mind. Janet stared at the Mona Lisa art print from Dusty and wondered why she still loved him. Envisioning him with Lucy, she threw the print in the trash.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Lucy grew indignant about Gabriel's accusation against Lucinda, but Gabriel recited what Lucinda had said to Fran\u00e7oise on the phone about hurting Lily and taking Craig down. Lucy reluctantly concluded that Craig had been right about Lucinda trying to use Lucy as a distraction. Gabriel wasn't sure whether he should bother telling Craig the truth, but Lucy reminded Gabriel that whatever affected Craig also affected Johnny.\n\n\nIn his hotel room, Craig stared at the clock, but quickly packed it away when Johnny entered. Sierra arrived as Craig set it in the hallway. She'd flown in from D.C. after receiving a text message from a distraught Lucy. Sierra guessed Lucy had become a pawn in some struggle between Craig and Lucinda. He blamed Lucinda, because he'd never use Lucy that way.\n\n\nSierra asked about the perfume factory scam, and Craig called it a bad business investment. When she didn't buy it, he admitted that he'd love for Lucinda to finally pay for something, but he'd never hurt Lily. Sierra asserted that Lily was just his pawn, but he insisted that Lily could be successful if she could get away from Lucinda. He asked Sierra not to spread her suspicions to Lily, because he could be good for Lily. Sierra refused to make any promises.\n\n\n       In the lobby, Craig encountered Dusty and started an argument about Lucy. Dusty refused to get into it. Instead, Dusty intended to go upstairs to say goodbye to Johnny. Dusty explained that he was going away for a few days, and Craig suddenly offered to let Johnny go with Dusty. Immediately suspicious, Dusty guessed that Blackthorn had threatened Johnny. Before Craig could say another word, Dusty tore out of the hotel.\n\n\n       Craig left Dusty several messages, all of which urged Dusty to stay away from Blackthorn. Craig called the nanny to check on Johnny, and Gabriel rounded the corner to say that he had urgent news that could affect Johnny. Craig assured Gabriel that nothing would happen to Johnny. He said that if Gabriel were a good son, he'd stay away from his father, too. When Gabriel looked shocked, Craig said that Gabriel always insisted that he wanted nothing to do with Craig. \"You should be happy as hell now,\" Craig concluded, storming off.\n\n\n       At Al's Diner, Dusty raged at Blackthorn for threatening Johnny. \"If you threaten my son, you're gonna get hurt,\" Dusty warned. Blackthorn had no idea what Dusty was talking about. Craig stormed in and reminded Dusty that Craig would handle it. \"If you don't, I will,\" Dusty grumbled and left.\n\n\nBlackthorn snapped at Craig for unleashing that goon on him. Craig replied that Dusty had acted of his own accord, but Craig preferred being civilized about things. Blackthorn insisted upon having his money. \"Time's a-wasting. Tick, tock, tick, tock,\" Blackthorn warned and left.\n\n\n       At the pond, Gabriel skipped rocks. Liberty approached, and as she joined him, she said she knew the feeling. They commiserated about how they couldn't get through to their parents.\n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Lily met Holden and said it was strange to see him without Molly. Holden held up Lily's necklace, and she gasped. He revealed that he'd bought it back from the Canadian pilot, and she called it the sweetest thing he'd done for her. Draping the necklace around her neck, he said he hadn't wanted her to sacrifice it for a wedding that had never occurred.\n\n\n       Lily wondered if he missed Molly. Dodging the question, Holden joked that she might have to hock the necklace if Craig took all of her money. Lily scowled at him and stormed out. Holden caught up to her on the curb, and she berated him for souring a sweet moment. He thought she'd learned her lesson about Craig, but Lily refused to let Holden choose her friends. She offered the necklace back, but Holden said to keep it. \"You might need it,\" he concluded.\n\n\n       Lily went home to find Sierra there, and as they caught up on things with Gabriel, Lily said that she was doing everything she could to set things right. Sierra figured that would explain why Lily was sleeping with her sister's ex-husband. Lily guessed that their mother had told Sierra that, and Sierra replied that Lucinda had hinted that Sierra would be na\u00efve to believe that Lily and Craig were just friends. \"Typical mother,\" Lily replied.\n\n\n       Sierra was relieved to hear that Lily wasn't involved with Craig. Sierra claimed that she hadn't been jealous; she just worried that the relationship would start another family war. Lily insisted that Craig had changed, and she was tired of being warned away from him. Lucy entered, guessing that Lily didn't want to hear a warning from her niece, either.\n\n\n       Lily hugged Lucy and figured that Sierra and Lucy hadn't wound up in Oakdale by coincidence. Lucy said Lucinda had urged her to make amends with Craig. Sierra added that Lucinda had thought Lucy could get Dusty back, meet her new brother, and be a good distraction for Craig. They all agreed that the former Mary Ellen Walters was ruthless. Though they found many things to admire about Lucinda, they vowed to never turn out like her.\n\n\n       In Old Town, Lucy greeted Dusty, but he told her to stay away from him and her father, because things might get ugly. She asked what was happening, but Dusty didn't elaborate. Lucy gave Dusty the lucky charm that he'd once given her and hoped that it would work better for him. Sierra approached as Lucy wished Dusty a tearful goodbye. Lucy said that Janet was a \"damn fool\" if she couldn't figure things out.\n\n\n       In the police interrogation room, Carly was eager to be wired, but Jack laughed. She guessed that he'd never intended to do it in the first place, but he said he was laughing at her vigor. She planned to let him have all the glory for the collar, because she only wanted to see Craig get what he deserved. \"I can close this chapter of my life once and for all,\" she said.\n\n\n       Jack instructed her to open her shirt so that he could apply the microphone. As their faces loomed closely together, she asked if anyone could hear them. He uttered, \"No,\" and she kissed him. He flipped her onto the table, but she said to lock the door first. Before he could, Holden charged into the room and quickly sensed that he'd interrupted something.\n\n\nCarly and Jack recomposed themselves, and Holden apprised them of the perfume scam. Though Lily insisted that Craig was a victim, Holden didn't trust him. Carly asserted that she didn't trust Craig, either. Jack said he and Carly had been comparing notes about it. Holden told them to do what they had to do, and he would, too. Jack warned Holden not to be impulsive. As Holden rushed out, Jack had second thoughts, but Carly ordered him not to back out on her.\n\n\n       At the Lakeview later, Jack set up surveillance in a hotel room and gave Carly instructions on how to handle Blackthorn. She insisted that she knew what she was doing, but Jack looked worried as she left for the lobby.\n\n\n       In the lounge, Carly tested her wire and saw Blackthorn stride by. She offered to discuss the amazing things she'd heard about him over drinks, and he said he couldn't refuse a beautiful lady. She ordered soda water and said that alcohol made her crazy.\n\n\nCarly pretended that she was a financial blogger, and she'd wanted to go to the source for her article on one of the biggest commodities traders in the region. As Carly used her alluring powers on him, Blackthorn opened up about making it out of his old neighborhood. She asked what his secret was. \"Who says I have one?\" he asked. Carly assured him that he could tell her \"off the record.\" Just then, Janet entered the lounge and saw Carly with Blackthorn.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Holden listened from the living room as Craig visited Lily on her porch. Lily told Craig that everyone thought she was insane to have faith in him. Craig offered to prove himself. He proposed that they rebound from the perfume mess. He said they'd be stronger than ever, and all it would take was money. \"But this time, it's going to take your money,\" he said.\n\n\n",
