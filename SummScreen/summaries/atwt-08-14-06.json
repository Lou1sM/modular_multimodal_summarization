Meg wanted Paul to handle the baby and Emily in a positive way and implied that there was a chance for Paul and Meg. Paul lectured Emily about nixing bed rest and going to work. Then, Paul turned on the sweet and offered to be Emily's friend and fix some bookwork. After coyly demurring, Emily accepted.\n\n\nGwen bashed the slasher over the head with a vase. When the slasher fell to the ground, Gwen called 9-1-1. The slasher revived and again went after Gwen, this time choking her. Later, Will took Gwen in his arms, and she awakened. Will claimed that the person in the house had run off when he'd entered. She thanked him for saving her. Casey rolled over and groaned. Casey asked them what the intruder had looked like. Will shook his head. Gwen said the slasher had been wearing a dark sweatshirt with a mask.\n\n\nCasey looked over at Will, who wore a navy hoodie. Will got defensive with Casey, saying he'd never hurt Gwen like that. Margo showed up in response to the 9-1-1 call. Will's version to Margo: he'd been walking to clear his head and he'd heard Gwen's screaming from outside. The front door had been locked, he hadn't been able to find his key, and he'd crawled through the window. Casey said the slasher had entered the same way. Dallas was searching outside and flashed a light on a cowering Maddie.\n\n\nAt the airport, Sergio forced Damian to meet Luke. Damian was rattled and nervous as a cat with burnt whiskers. Lucy and Dusty were tied with ropes to a pipe, from which they were dangling, in the Fairwinds wine cellar. Lucy managed to untie their hands. Right after they crashed to the ground, Dusty smelled gas. They quickly managed to break out. He and Lucy dove for freedom right before the room detonated and blew to pieces.\n\n\nHolden and Jack convinced a Fed to detain Damian, but the evil Sergio was eavesdropping. Sergio demanded they take another flight. When Damian relayed that to Luke, he refused to go until he got some straight answers. Sergio pulled Luke by the arm. Jack and Holden arrived to save the day. Sergio whipped out a gun and shot Jack.\n\n\nSergio deftly grabbed Luke and used him as a shield, proclaiming, \"No one move, or the boy dies!\" Meanwhile, Meg showed up with a medical bag to work on a comatose Lucy, having heard about the explosion on her radio. Lucy awoke with problems breathing.\n\n\n",

Carly and Simon can't help but enjoy each other's company though. Damian is nervous as he and Luke try to get on their flight; Damian feigns lightheadedness when Luke is concerned that Lucy isn't calling him back. Serge demands Damian get Luke on the flight tonight and he is going with them to make sure it happens. Damian isn't pleased but Serge reminds him of the money he owes their friends. He has to make Luke sign over his trust; he gently reminds him what happens if Luke predeceases him. Jack and Holden are at the airport as well trying to stop Damian from leaving the country with Luke; they enlist the help of a Federal agent. Serge overhears this plan and panics, causing Damian to lose his cool. Serge takes Luke hostage and Jack is shot.

They come to an agreement to try to stay on friendly terms but with boundaries. Paul then offers to help Emily with her work. Gwen struggles with the slasher and seems to get the bette of him when she knocks him out. She calls the police, but the attacker wakes up and tries to choke her. She awakens later finding Will standing over her. He claims he heard her screaming; Gwen thanks him for saving her life and tells her she loves him. When Casey awakens, Gwen explains what happened, but she can't identify her attacker because he had a mask and dark hooded sweatshirt on. Casey points out that Will has one on even though it is 70 degrees out. He is suspicious of what Will is capable of doing to get his wife back. Will assures both of them he would never hurt either one of them. The police arrive, Will is further questioned and he seems nervous.
