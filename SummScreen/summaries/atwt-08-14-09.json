Tom was extremely upset that Riley was there, but Margo asked Tom to leave the boys alone, because the argument was most likely about Alison. Margo told Tom she would gather some things to take to Kim at the hospital to make Kim more comfortable. Tom waited in the living room and overheard some of Riley and Casey's argument. He went outside in time to hear Casey accusing Riley of leading Alison to cause Kim's heart attack, and Tom asked what Casey meant by that. Casey told his father that Riley had advised Alison to talk to Kim about Alison's concerns about Bob's behavior, and Kim had become so upset that she'd had a heart attack. Tom was irate when he heard that.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Bob got the lab work back after Kim's close call, and the results showed that Kim had ten times the appropriate level of thrombolytic drug in her system. Bob wondered how something like that could have happened and who could have done such a thing. Alison told Bob that he had been the only person in the room with Kim, and she mentioned that she had seen Bob adjust Kim's heparin intravenous line right before he had spoken to Alison in the hallway. Bob, however, did not recall having spoken to Alison at all. Alison tried to remind Bob about their conversation concerning the fact that Alison had been talking to Kim when Kim had the heart attack, but Bob was convinced that he and Alison had never discussed any such thing.\n\n\nAlison again told Bob that he had been the only person in Kim's room. Bob became agitated, asking if Alison was accusing him of trying to harm his own wife. Alison said she knew Bob wouldn't do that intentionally, and when she saw how upset Bob was becoming, Alison assured him that everything would be okay.\n\n\nBob went back into Kim's room to check on her, and Alison decided to call Casey to let him know that Kim had suffered a setback. Casey told Tom and Margo, and they all went to the hospital to check on Kim. When they arrived, Bob explained that Kim had been given an overdose of heparin, but they had caught it in time to prevent her from experiencing any complications from it. Tom was astounded that something like that could happen, and he asked who was responsible. Bob said he wasn't sure how it had happened. Tom asked another nurse if she had seen anything, and the nurse replied, \"Alison was already in the room when I got there.\"\n\n\nTom was convinced that meant that Alison had given Kim the wrong dosage of the anticoagulant. Alison stared at him in disbelief, then looked at Bob, but Bob didn't say anything about his previous conversation with Alison. Sizing up the situation, Alison decided no one would believe her if she tried to point out that it must have been Bob's mistake, so she simply said, \"What happened to Kim was unintentional.\" Tom accused Alison of having gone after Kim twice in one day, but Alison said, \"I never meant for any of this to happen!\" Margo suggested that Alison leave, and she did, followed by Casey.\n\n\nTom then announced that Alison had been careless and that what she had done was criminal. Tom said that he would press charges against Alison if Bob wanted him to do that. Bob said he couldn't deal with Alison yet, and needed to concentrate on getting Kim better.\n\n\nCasey caught up with Alison in Old Town, but Alison told him that she wanted to be alone for a while. Casey asked why Alison hadn't defended herself, but Alison said no one would have believed her. Alison said she thought that even Casey would have assumed that she was trying to blame someone else to cover her own mistake. When Casey didn't immediately deny that, Alison said she had her answer, and she left.\n\n\nAlison went into Java, where Riley saw how upset she was and  pulled her over to his table. Alison explained what had happened, and Riley told Alison that she had to defend herself. Alison said the only way to do that was to destroy Bob Hughes. She told Riley that she thought Bob had looked scared when she had spoken to him. She said, \"This strong, powerful man, he doesn't know what he did.\" Riley reminded Alison that he, too, had seen signs of Bob's confusion, when Bob hadn't known how to operate the pager he'd had for years. Riley told Alison that he would accompany her to the hospital to try to talk to Tom and Margo about it, but Alison refused.\n\n\nCasey returned and told his dad that there must be another explanation, because Alison would not have made such a mistake on the heels of the other incident involving Riley's overdose of medication. Tom said Casey was letting his relationship with Alison cloud his judgment. Casey argued that Tom was letting his relationship to Kim cloud his own judgment. Margo tried to calm the two men down. Tom told Margo that because he was the hospital's legal counsel, it was his job to protect the hospital from malpractice. Tom insisted, \"I'll do everything in my power to make sure Alison Stewart never works in this hospital one more day.\"\n\n\nEmma visited Lily, armed with cookies for Lily and the kids to take to Kentucky with them. Lily told Emma that she hadn't heard from Holden yet, but Emma said Holden was probably visiting with some of the men at one of the tracks. Emma then informed Lily that Meg had gone on the cruise with Damian, after all, and Lily told Emma that Damian had stopped by to let her know that. Emma said they would have to let Meg make her own decisions and mistakes, but Lily called Damian \"an error in judgment wrapped in an expensive Italian suit.\"\n\n\nEmma thought that Lily seemed more than a little upset about Meg and Damian, but Lily said she was just trying to protect her son and her sister-in-law from Damian's dark side. Emma suggested that all Lily could do was take care of herself, and Lily agreed. Emma told Lily that she knew Lily and the kids would have a wonderful trip with Holden, and Lily said she intended to put the Damian and Meg business out of her mind. Luke walked into the house; he and Emma greeted one another, and then Emma left to return to the farm.\n\n\nThe phone rang, and Lily answered, hoping it would be Holden. Instead, it was the Kentucky state police, informing her that Holden's truck had been involved in a terrible accident. Lily was distraught and told Luke what had happened. Lily decided to call her mother to ask Lucinda to arrange for the Worldwide jet to fly Lily down to Kentucky and to ask Lucinda to watch Ethan and Faith. Luke insisted that he would accompany his mother to Kentucky, because Holden would want him to do that. Lily agreed, but she told Luke not to let anyone else know what was going on until they had more facts to report. Lily decided to tell Faith and Ethan that Holden's work was delaying him from returning, and she decided not to tell Emma anything at all.\n\n\nDamian and Meg arrived in New York in preparation for their cruise ship departure. At the hotel, they talked happily about their trip, and Damian told Meg that their trip together with Eliza was a sign for the rest of Meg's family that Damian and Meg were officially  in a relationship. As they got comfortable, Damian's phone rang; Meg asked him not to answer it, but Damian saw that it was Luke calling, and he told Meg he had to talk to his son.\n\n\nLuke told Damian about Holden's accident. Luke let Damian know that Lily hadn't wanted him to call anyone, but Luke was concerned that if he didn't let Meg know what was happening, Meg and Damian would be out at sea when the rest of the family found out what had happened to Holden. Damian assured Luke that he'd done the right thing by calling.\n\n\nDamian filled Meg in, and Meg immediately wanted to fly to Kentucky to help find her brother. Damian, however, suggested that it might be better for Meg to return to the farm to be with her mother, so that when Emma received the news about Holden, she wouldn't be alone. Meg agreed, and Damian arranged for them to both fly back to Oakdale. However, Damian told Meg that he would travel on to Kentucky, because he wanted to be with Luke.\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Lily and Luke made their way to the scene of the accident and were told by the police that Holden's truck had gone over the railing and into a ravine, where it had exploded. The police had not been able to get close enough to the truck to determine anything else. Lily clung to the hope that Holden might be injured but alive, and she desperately tried to convince the police to make another attempt to reach the truck. The police insisted that they couldn't do anything else until the scene had been declared safe. Lily announced that she would climb down to the truck herself, but Damian arrived and held Lily back, telling her that he couldn't let her do that.\n\n\nLuke admitted to his mother that he had called Damian to make sure that Meg wouldn't be somewhere out at sea if she were needed back home. Damian tried to convince Lily to go somewhere safe to rest and wait for the police to let them know more as the situation developed. Lily absolutely refused, tearfully insisting that she had to stay at the accident scene until someone found Holden, alive or otherwise. Damian told Luke to stay with Lily, and he left to make a phone call to the Snyder farm.\n\n\nEmma walked into the kitchen at the farm and was surprised to find Meg and Eliza there. She asked Meg why she wasn't in New York getting ready for the cruise with Damian. Meg explained that something else had come up, and the cruise had to be postponed again. Meg was cryptic about the exact reasons for the postponement, and Emma could tell that Meg was hiding something from her.\n\n\nThe phone rang, and Meg answered it. It was Damian, who informed her about the violent nature of the accident and the fact that it did not look like anyone could have survived. After Damian hung up, Emma said that she had gone to the barn to check on the horses, and Holden's horse had kicked violently in the stall, as though it were on fire, until she calmed him down by talking to him quietly. Emma told Meg that for a moment, she had sensed Holden's presence in the barn with her.\n\n\nEmma then asked Meg whether something had happened to Holden. Meg nodded and held her mother while she told her about the accident. Emma told Meg that if Holden were gone, she would know it, because she was his mother. Emma insisted that they had to be strong, because that was what Holden needed. Emma then asked her daughter to pray with her, and Emma prayed that the Lord would protect her son.\n\n\nEventually, one of the policemen approached Lily and told her that they had found a body near the wreckage, and nearby, they had found a watch. He asked whether Lily recognized the watch, and Luke replied, \"It's Dad's.\" Lily tried to hold back her tears as she told Luke that the watch had been his grandfather's, but Holden had intended to give it to Luke one day. Lily quietly said that she wanted to keep it herself for awhile. Damian told Lily there was nothing more they could do in Kentucky and that he could arrange a flight back to Oakdale immediately, but Lily said, \"I can't leave Holden here all alone. I can't just walk away from him.\" Damian put his arms around Lily and quietly told her, \"He's gone. Holden's gone.\"\n\n\n",
