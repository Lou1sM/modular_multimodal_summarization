    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty tried to convince Craig that Paul is no threat. Carly convinced Rosanna to tell Craig that she wants a child. Hal was worried that Susan may be covering for Rick, because that could make her an accessory to his crimes. With Alison's statement as ammunition, Tom tried to get a search warrant for Rick and Susan's home, but he was unable to do so. Alison and Chris decided to search the house on their own, since they wouldn't need a search warrant. Susan told Rick she would stick by him, but after Emily made her confront her doubts, she told him she couldn't keep standing up for him. When John told Marshall Sarah's age and her medical disorder, Marshall started putting the pieces together, and had Zara's casket exhumed. Jessica told Bonnie that if Bonnie didn't tell Marshall about Sarah, she would. Bonnie told Isaac they needed to get Sarah out of the country immediately.",
