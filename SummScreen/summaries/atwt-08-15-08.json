    "soap_central": "\n\nMargo and Casey brought Tom home from the hospital, where Casey gave them the news that he and Emily were going to have their marriage annulled. Casey told his parents that the annulment was Emily's idea, because Emily thought it was too soon for them to get married. Tom and Margo agreed, and Margo said Casey was young to make a commitment. Casey assured her he was still committed to Emily, and one day, they would get married again. Tom offered to prepare the annulment paperwork, but both Casey and Margo told him not to rush into work again. \n\n\nEmily went to the hospital and told Susan about her impending annulment. Susan was pleased to hear the news and told Emily the May-December romance wasn't a good idea. Emily reminded her mother of Susan's own marriage to a younger man, and Susan said that was precisely why she knew it wasn't a good idea. \n\n\nEmily went to the Lakeview lounge, where she met Casey. As they talked, Emily spotted someone she knew: her niece, Dani Andropolous. Emily and Casey got up to talk to Dani, who informed them she had graduated from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and was a criminologist. Casey told Dani he'd been on the wrong side of the law, having served time for grand larceny. Dani was shocked to hear that, but Casey said Dani had no idea how much had happened since she'd been gone from Oakdale. Dani realized Casey meant that he and Emily were a couple. Emily got Casey to leave before he could mention that he and Emily were actually married. Dani told Emily she thought it was great that Emily was dating a younger man, and she called her Aunt Emily, \"queen of the cougars.\" \n\n\nEmily went to her office and was surprised to see Casey waiting for her. Casey asked why Emily hadn't wanted to tell Dani about their marriage. Emily said she didn't think it was the right time to discuss it. \n\n\nDani went to the hospital to see Susan. Dani told Susan how surprised she'd been to learn that Emily and Casey were an item. Susan cautioned Dani against mentioning the age difference to Emily. Dani said one day, Casey would wake up and realize there was a world of hot, young women out there, and then he and Emily would be history. \n\n\nBack at Emily's office, Casey and Emily kissed passionately. Margo walked in and told them the door was open and they should be more discreet. Margo said she'd brought paperwork for the annulment, from Tom. Casey said he'd told his dad not to rush that, but Margo said it had kept Tom from going stir-crazy. She offered to leave the papers for them to sign, but Emily told Margo to wait, and she and Casey both signed the documents. Margo said she would take the paperwork back to Tom so he could have it filed. She left, and Casey asked Emily if she was still as invested in their relationship as he was. She said she was, and they embraced. \n\n\nCarly waited at a train depot for Parker, who was supposed to be coming home from tennis camp, but Parker wasn't on the train. Carly called Jack, who asked if Carly had gotten to the depot on time and whether she had tried to call Parker; Carly answered yes to both questions. Jack said he was sure Parker was fine, but Carly wasn't convinced; however, given Jack's reluctance to do anything, she hung up. \n\n\nCarly kept trying to call Parker, but he didn't answer his phone. She left a message asking him to send her a text message if he didn't want to talk to her, then she called Holden and told him what was happening. Holden told Carly he would come to the train depot right away. When he arrived, he asked Carly if she was sure Jack hadn't picked up Parker. She said he had not and that Jack seemed to think she was making a big deal out of nothing. Holden asked whether Carly had spoken to the camp counselor, and Carly said no and immediately called him. The counselor told Carly that Parker had taken an earlier train, so Carly told Holden that Parker was probably at home, wondering where everyone was. Holden told Carly he would walk her to her car, and he put his arm around her. \n\n\nAt the farm with Janet, Jack tried to call Parker but couldn't reach him. Janet called Liberty to ask if she had seen Parker, but Liberty assured her that she hadn't. When Janet told Jack, he decided maybe he'd better go to the train station after all. Jack arrived at the train depot and asked Holden why he was there. Carly tried to explain, but Jack said Carly's relationship with Holden was a big part of the problems Parker was having, and he thought Holden should think twice before going to Carly's with her to check on Parker. Holden told Jack that the next time Carly called because she was concerned about one of their kids, maybe Jack shouldn't blow her off. Jack became angry. Trying to defuse the situation, Carly asked Holden to leave. Holden asked if Carly was sure she wanted to deal with Jack on her own, but Carly assured him she could handle it. As Holden walked past Jack, Holden told him next time Jack should step up, and then Carly wouldn't have to call Holden. \n\n\nParker showed up at Brad's house and scared Liberty by coming up from behind her unexpectedly. Parker explained that he'd gotten off the train and headed straight for Liberty's house; he assured her he'd waited outside until he was positive Brad and Katie were gone before he came in. Liberty told Parker he had to leave, but Parker kissed her, and she found herself kissing him back. \n\n\nParker told Liberty she was the reason he couldn't concentrate on tennis. Liberty said Parker loved tennis, but Parker said he also loved Liberty. That seemed to freak Liberty out, and she sat Parker down on the couch, turned on the TV, and went to get him something to drink. In the kitchen, Liberty made a quick call to her dad, who was at work at WOAK. Liberty told Brad that Parker was there, uninvited, and didn't appear to want to leave. Brad told her he would be there right away. He and Katie left the studio, telling Kim there was a family crisis. \n\n\nParker told Liberty he'd thought of a plan so that they could see each other despite their parents' objections. Liberty told Parker he was crazy, but Parker said he missed her and wanted to be with her. As he leaned towards Liberty to kiss her again, Brad and Katie walked in. Brad said, \"You must have a death wish, and it is about to come true!\" \n\n\nJack went with Carly back to her house; however, J.J. came downstairs and informed them that he hadn't seen Parker. Carly told J.J. they thought Parker would already be home because he'd taken an earlier train, but Jack went to check, and Parker wasn't there. Brad called Jack and told him Parker was with Liberty, and Brad was going to bring him home. He told Jack he'd better figure out a way to get through to Parker about staying away from Liberty. When Brad dropped Parker off, he told Jack that if he couldn't deal with Parker, Brad would do it himself. Brad left. \n\n\nHolden went to the diner to get something to eat, and Janet waited on him. She could tell he was upset, and he told her he'd already had a run-in with Jack. After he explained what had happened, Janet said she hoped Parker was home and not with Liberty. Janet asked Holden if he was upset only about what had happened at the train depot or if it had something to do with his separation from Lily. Janet said she understood about breakups, that it was like quitting smoking: You kept reaching for something even though you knew you couldn't have it. Holden asked if she was talking about him and Lily or him and Carly; Janet said both. Holden said it was too bad there wasn't a patch, and Janet agreed that a relationship patch would be a terrific idea. Holden smiled and left. \n\n\nJack asked Parker what he'd been thinking when he chose to go see Liberty. Carly told Parker he should have called her to let him know he'd taken an earlier train, but Parker blew her off. Jack told Parker not to use that tone with his mother, and Parker sarcastically agreed that no one deserved his respect more than his mom. Jack told Parker to empty his pockets, and he took Parker's phone and house keys. He told Parker that in the future, Parker wasn't going to make a move without Jack knowing about it, and he sent Parker up to his room. When Parker left the room, Jack told Carly he didn't know what else to do short of locking Parker up. Carly said she understood, but she wondered if Jack would have a better chance of getting through to Parker if he acted less like a cop and more like a father. \n\n\nJack retorted that kids needed a good example of how to behave, and he wondered how Parker was supposed to learn how to act when the only adult he was living with was setting such a poor example. Carly responded that perhaps Parker would be better off at the farm, where Jack was living with Janet, setting yet another good example. Jack said if Parker moved to the farm, he would find someplace else for Janet to live, and he asked Carly if he should look into that. Carly said no, and Jack turned to leave, still upset. Carly asked, \"What about yesterday?\" She said she thought they had put all the \"bad stuff\" behind them; Jack said he had, too, but he'd been wrong again. Jack left. \n\n\nJ.J. went into Parker's room and said Parker must really like Liberty if he was willing to continue being punished by his parents for seeing her. Parker said he would find a way to keep seeing Liberty. J.J. asked how, given that their parents were going to be watching Parker constantly. Parker said they wouldn't be watching J.J.. Parker then proposed that J.J. tell their parents that he and Parker were hanging out together, and then whenever Liberty showed up, J.J. could make himself scarce. J.J. told Parker to forget it, because their parents would figure it out. Parker offered to pay J.J. $20 every time he helped him. \n\n\nLiberty told Katie that although she liked Parker, he was too intense about their relationship. Katie asked if Liberty had told Parker that they should hold off on their relationship because of their parents, and Liberty said she had, but Parker hadn't listened. Liberty told Katie she wasn't worried about her dad as much as she was concerned about Parker and what he might do. \n\n\nWhen Brad returned home, he told Katie he didn't think anyone could keep Parker from thinking he could still be with Liberty. Katie said she had an idea. She thought they should set up a fake date between Liberty and Leo, the new intern at WOAK, so that Parker could see that Liberty wasn't ready for a committed relationship. Brad wasn't sure that was a good idea, but Katie thought it would do the trick. \n\n\nJack went to the diner and told Janet about Parker having gone to see Liberty. Janet assured him they would get through this and told him the kids were tougher than they gave them credit for. Meanwhile, Holden went to Carly's house to make sure she was okay and that Parker was home. Carly told Holden that Jack had threatened to take Parker away from her. Holden said Jack would never do that, but Carly wasn't so sure. She told Holden that Jack had a valid point: she hadn't set a good example for her children. She said her relationship with Holden had to end, and that she couldn't call him anymore when she needed help. Holden reluctantly left.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

Likewise Emily catches her mother at the hospital checking on patients instead of resting. She gives her the good news that she is going ahead with the annulment, but that doesn't mean she and Casey are through. He doesn't care how old she is or what she will look like twenty years from now. Emily sees her niece, Dani, in the diner and they catch up on family history and Dani seems to approve of her Aunt Emily as a cougar to Casey. Parker doesn't show up at the train station from tennis camp. Carly calls Holden as she is worried and he meets her there. Jack eventually does too and the Snyder men exchange snide barbs. Jack throws it in Carly's face of what an example she is setting. If Parker lived with him at the farm, he'd have Janet move out. Parker surprises Liberty by showing up at her place. What's love in tennis when he has her? She manages to call her Dad and he accuses Parker of wanting a death wish and he's about to get it.
