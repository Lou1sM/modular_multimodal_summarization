Simon liked the idea of maintaining the \"mystery\" of their relationship by taking things slow.  Katie on the other hand, accused him of being afraid to make love to her because deep down he knew that they were right for each other.  They were interrupted by the police who had a present for them--plane tickets to America and a police escort to the airport.  \n\n\nOwen admitted setting the bomb in the boathouse to a very surprised Hal and Emily.  When further questioned, he admitted that he did it for Julia.  \n\n\nJessica's questioning of Craig continued on the witness stand.  As his testimony was nearing completion, Hal burst into the courtroom and informed Cass of his recent discovery regarding Owen and the bombing.  The judge allowed Cass to call Owen to the stand where he admitted to the shocked courtroom that he set the bomb on behalf of Julia. In a somewhat bewildered state, he announced that the bomb had not been meant for Barbara--it was meant for Jack and Carly.\n\n\nThe Malta authorities questioned Lily about the death of the friar and locked her in a cell.  She was shocked when she realized that Damian was in the cell with her hiding under a blanket.\n\n\nJulia pulled a gun on Carly and viciously punched her in the stomach when she tried to scream for help.  Carly was horrified when she realized that Julia was behind the bombing of the boathouse.  Julia threatened to kill Jack and Parker unless Carly went with her, which she did reluctantly. Julia took Carly to a piece of property that she had owned. She explained that deforestation on the land had turned up patches of quicksand. Julia motioned to one particular patch and hinted that it would be Carly's final resting place.\n\n\n",
