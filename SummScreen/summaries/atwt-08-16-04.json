Mike convinces Carly that they should humor Parker, and they watch as Parker composes a note to Jack on the back of a family picture.  Parker tells them that he intends to put the note into a bottle and to throw it off the bridge where Jack's car went into the river.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Jack awakens and insists to Nurse Julia that he urgently feels that he must go home, but he can't remember his home.  The doctor still unwisely insists that Nurse Julia play along with Jack's feeling that he knows her, and Jack overhears Julia talking to her son, J. J., in the hallway outside his room.  When Jack hears the name, \"J. J.,\" he is overwhelmed by feelings of familiarity, and he becomes convinced that he is married to Nurse Julia, and that J. J. is his son.  A social worker comes in and tells him that he was found north of town beside the river, and he feels strongly that he must go to the spot where he was found.\n\n\nToday's Keys to the Kingdom clue further complicates the Stewart/Hughes love triangle.  The clue reads, \"Where fowl reigns supreme and lambs do not roam, and pigs in a blanket say, 'Take me home,' tuck in but don't let sleeping dogs lie.  Jump up to claim your prize. \"  Alison and Aaron mistakenly head for Mabel's Diner and join the hot-dog-eating contest, while Emily and Chris are first to arrive at Frankfurter's Mattress Store (whose overhead sign shows a pig sleeping in a bed).  They \"tuck in\" to a bed and see the sign overhead, but only after casting longing looks at each other.  Reaching up to the light fixture for the key, Emily falls on top of Chris on the bed, they kiss and begin tearing each other's clothes off. Nancy Hughes comes to Mabel's and tells Aaron and Alison that they should be at the mattress store instead of Mabel's.\n\n\nHal comes to Barbara's apartment and demands to know if she helped Stenbeck.  Barbara denies it, but is holding the audiotape when Jennifer comes to tell her that Rosanna and Cabot have been kidnapped by Stenbeck.  When Jennifer questions her, Barbara admits that she helped James because he threatened to hurt Will.  Jennifer gives the tape to Hal, and Hal promises to see that Barbara is punished if he can find evidence that she helped James escape from the prison guards.\n\n\nAt the carnival, James holds Rosanna and Cabot underground at knifepoint, until a hysterical Rosanna promises James that she and Jordan will do anything James wants for the rest of their lives if he will let them keep Cabot.  James gleefully agrees, but only if Paul helps.  At the carnival, Paul attacks the clown balloon vendor, thinking that he is Stenbeck.  Embarrassed, he and the police find that he is mistaken.  However, just moments later, Stenbeck appears behind Paul dressed as the balloon clown, and tells Paul that he, Rosanna, and Cabot will be waiting for Paul at the old family cabin.  Paul slips off from the carnival, opens the cabin door, and is stunned by what he sees.\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, Rosanna pleads for her baby in the underground hideaway where Stenbeck has taken them. Stenbeck rails against Paul but Rosanna defends him and reveals she loves him. Later, James, dressed in a clown suit, orders Paul to meet him secretly. Elsewhere, Jennifer discovers Barbara trying to destroy the tape that Stenbeck sent her. Barbara confesses what she did but insists that she did it to protect Will. Jennifer tells Hal everything and as Hal confronts Barbara, Paul arrives at the cabin. He hears Rosanna and the baby inside and is about to find them as James comes out to greet him. Parker shows Carly and Mike the repaired compass hes found, a gift from Jack intended for Carly. Parker wants to use it to locate Jack. Mike persuades Carly to let Parker hold on to his hope of finding Jack in order to let Parker deal with Jacks death in his own way. Later, Parker writes a note to Jack and places it in a bottle to later drop in the river. Meanwhile, Jack is anxious to leave the hospital. Julia continues to play into Jacks idea that he remembers her. When Julias son JJ arrives, Jack begins to think that JJ is his son and Julia is his wife. Emily and Chris go to Frankfurters mattress store to search for the key where they fall into a bed together and start to make out passionately. Meanwhile, Alison and Aaron mistakenly get embroiled in a hot dog eating contest at Mabels, thinking its the place where the next key is hidden. Later, Nancy points Aaron and Alison in the direction of Frankfurters.",

The note is a picture of Jack, Carly, Parker and Sage with a message on the back begging him to come home with their phone number. They're going to throw it off the bridge where Jack's car went into the river. Chris and Emily find the key, but also find themselves in a compromising position at the mattress store as Allison and Aaron talk to the owner. James has taken Roseanna and Cabot to the cabin, telling Paul that he'll get to play hero, but on his terms. When he shows him inside, he informs him that what's going to happen next is almost biblical. Jennifer gives Hal the tape that James sent Barbara and tells him of her mother's confession to help him escape. Hal confronts Barbara and she denies any involvement, Hal swearing that once he finds out she's behind his escape, she'll rot in prison.",
