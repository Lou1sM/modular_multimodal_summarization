He looks at her, while Hal is bringing Barbara in for questioning.  Jordan asks if she is being questioned about Cabot and Rosanna's disappearance.  She tells them all that she did not help to kidnap Cabot.  Jennifer tells Jordan that she  had her suspicions but was not sure .  Inside Hal's interrogation room, they all listen to the tape from James.  Barbara tells them she had to help him or he threatened to kill to kill Will.  Surely Jordan understands that.  She says that Will is still not safe, because James can get to him.  Jordan asks what the charges are, that they are bringing Barbara up on and is told that it is aiding and abetting.  After trying to figure out why this is happening, Jennifer says that no one has heard from Paul either.  She tells Barbara, that if anything happens to her brother, she will hold her responsible.  Hal realizes that this is not about Cabot and Rosanna, but about Paul.  When he thinks about it, he calls in everybody and puts an APB out on Paul Ryan.

James tells Paul, that what he wants, is what he always wanted, for Paul to be a man.  First he wants Paul to call him Dad.

She loves him.  He also tells him that he and Rosanna are going to get married.  James wants to know what was wrong with Jordan and Rosanna being together and raising their son in a family unit.  Paul says it just didn't happen that way.  He tells him to pick a door but to choose carefully because he has a bomb planted to go off.  Paul wants to know where the keys are for the door.  He begs James to let him get Cabot and Rosanna out of there safely.  James tells him to pick a door because there is only time to save one life.  Which one is it going to be?  The love of his life or the love of her life.  He asks again, who's it going to be, because one of them is going to be a goner.  James gives the keys to Paul and shows him where the bomb is planted.  He fumbles through the keys trying to find the right one to save Rosanna.  James tells him to hurry because time is running short, then runs out of the cabin himself.  Paul finds the key and opens the door of the room that Rosanna is in.  He unties and frees her while she is yelling for him to  save Cabot.  He has to physically haul her out of the cabin.
