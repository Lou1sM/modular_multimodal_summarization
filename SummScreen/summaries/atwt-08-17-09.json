Faith walked in, full of excitement for the Snyder family vacation in Kentucky, but she wondered why her grandmother and aunt were upset.  The girl demanded to know what was wrong and if it impacted her.  Meg claimed that they were not keeping secrets, but Lily and Damian arrived.  Meg took one look at Lily's face and began to cry.  Damian went to comfort her, so Faith asked her mother where Holden was, and Lily had to tell her daughter that her father was gone.\n\n\nEmma burst into tears of denial, as Lily explained that Holden's truck had crashed into a ravine and that he was dead.  They held each other and cried, and Emma began demanding proof that it had been Holden in the crash.  Lily produced Holden's watch that the police had returned to her, and they all recognized it.  Emma wanted more, however.  Lily decided to go home, and she asked Faith to help her tell little Ethan that his daddy was gone.  They left for home, and Damian stayed with Meg and Emma.\n\n\nCraig went to Carly's house and told Rosanna that workmen were starting that day on renovations to the kitchen in Metro.  He claimed that Metro was going to have the flashiest, most state-of-the-art kitchen in Oakdale.  Craig was sure that the profits from Teri's cooking would more than justify the improvements.  Teri, who was listening to the conversation, suddenly demanded that Craig stop the workers immediately.\n\n\nTeri proclaimed herself an expert in cooking and plumbing fixtures, and she wanted input on the changes.  That caused giggles from Rosanna, who said that she was truly enjoying a rare moment of hearing Craig's butt getting kicked by a woman other than herself.  Teri grabbed her purse and told Craig that they had to go to Metro right away.\n\n\nLiberty discovered Parker on his front porch, and she asked him why he had not checked his messages.  She had sent him a text telling him that she was arriving to pick him up for the end-of-summer picnic sponsored by the high school.  Parker said that, as much as he would like to attend, he had to go to a photo shoot for his mother's vitamin water, and he was not sure how long it would last.  He sensed that Liberty was down, however, and he agreed to meet her at the picnic when his work was finished.\n\n\nLiberty took off for the picnic, where a young man named Tony immediately hit on her.  Tony offered her a drink from his water bottle, which turned out to be mostly vodka.  Liberty told him that she was waiting for Parker, who was involved in some endorsements for his mother's company.  She called Tony \"a loser\" and walked off.  She hung out with another girl for a while, but she finally decided to go look for Parker.  As she was leaving, Tony made some rude remarks.\n\n\nAt Java, Noah bussed tables, and Luke knocked on the window and motioned his boyfriend outside.  Noah took a break and went out, where a tearful Luke told him that Holden's truck had crashed and burned, and his father was dead.  Luke cried that it had all been Luke's fault.  Noah hugged him immediately, as Luke said that he should not have blown off going to Kentucky with Holden.  Luke felt that perhaps Holden had fallen asleep at the wheel, and if Luke had gone with him, he could have shared the driving.\n\n\nNoah reminded Luke that if he had been with his father, he might be gone, too.  The two went into Java, and Luke explained that he had only delayed to help Lily convince Faith to go on the family trip.  Noah assured him that Holden knew how much Luke loved him, and Luke should not feel as if he had slighted his father.  He said that biology was who you were, but family was whom you loved.  Noah was sure that Holden understood why Luke was also pulled towards Damian.\n\n\nLuke was worried that Holden had been very upset when Luke had given Damian another chance several months before.  Luke felt that he should be with his family, so he got up to leave.  Noah offered to go with him, but Luke said no.  He felt too guilty because Noah had urged him all along to accompany Holden to Kentucky.\n\n\nLily and Faith took Ethan home from the farm, and they sat in the living room.  Lily  explained that Holden had gone on a long trip, and he was \"in a better place.\"  Ethan seemed to understand that people could be gone a long time, but he wanted to know when Holden was returning home.  Lily broke down, and Faith stepped in and kept the boy busy.  Lily went into her bedroom and took Holden's will from his dresser.  She looked at the folder a long time, but she could not bear to open it, and she dissolved in tears.\n\n\nDamian surprised Lily in her bedroom as she sobbed.  He tried to put his arms around her, but Lily shouted at him not to touch her.  There was no way he could console her, and Lily said that everything had happened because she had let Damian kiss her.  She felt that she was being punished, and she yelled at Damian again when he tried to hug her.  She finally had no more strength to resist, and Faith walked in to see Damian with his arms around her mother again.\n\n\nFaith went ballistic and charged at Damian, yelling at him not to touch her mother.  Lily attempted to tell Faith that Damian was trying to be nice, but the girl said that Damian did not belong in her parents' bedroom.  She screamed that nothing would ever be okay again, and she ran out of the house.  Lily and Damian could not find her either inside or outside, so they decided to split up to look for her.  Lily said she would take Ethan to the farm in case Faith had gone there.  Luke arrived then, and Lily asked him to watch Ethan so she could go faster to look for her daughter.\n\n\nDamian sat with Luke and reminded the young man that he had lost one father, but he still had a father left who loved him very much.  Luke sobbed on Damian's shoulder, as Damian advised him to take whatever he could from the people who loved him.  Noah walked in and said that he needed to be with Luke, and he knew that Luke needed him.  Damian left them alone, and Noah offered to hold Luke.\n\n\nAt the photo shoot, Rosanna stressed that the goal was to promote the vitamin water's ability to rehydrate and restore energy after strong physical activity.  Parker was lost in his own thoughts and not paying attention to Rosanna, so she took him aside and asked what was going on.  Parker denied that anything was, but Rosanna guessed that Liberty was on his mind more than vitamin water.  Parker said that a few months before, he could only think of Liberty as his wife, but since then, the two had agreed that they should just be friends.  He was confused, because lately it had seemed that Liberty was wanting more than that.\n\n\nRosanna said that it was no wonder that the boy was befuddled, and Liberty could not have it both ways.  Parker said that Liberty had gotten knocked down at her summer internship; he swore Rosanna to secrecy and told her that Liberty had gotten fired.  Rosanna complimented the boy on being sensitive and a good friend, and she said that Carly would be very proud of him.  She told Parker to forget the photo shoot and to go to the picnic and find Liberty.\n\n\nParker went home first, and he found Faith crying on the front porch.  Parker took her inside, and she told him about Holden's accident.  Parker could not believe that Holden was dead, and he was unsure how to comfort Faith.  He put his arms around the girl, and they hugged.  A surprised Liberty saw them hugging through the front door, and she ran away.\n\n\nAt Metro, Teri made a few changes in the remodel, including the addition of a second sink and an upgraded refrigerator.  Craig began fishing for compliments by trying to get Teri to agree that he had done well, even though he had no knowledge of \"culinary work flows.\"  Teri wanted to do some simple plumbing on the bar sink, and she told Craig that she had spent an entire summer working for an appliance company.  Craig wanted to leave all the work for the experts, but Teri attacked the shutoff valve with a wrench and got thoroughly drenched by the resulting geyser.\n\n\nCraig mentioned that there was a dryer on the premises, so Teri pulled off her shirt.  Just as an embarrassed Craig was wrapping the young woman in a towel, Rosanna walked in and called Craig a \"dirty dog.\"  She berated him for putting moves on Teri, but Craig exclaimed that he loved Carly, and besides, he did not have to explain himself to anyone. Teri went to put her shirt in the dryer, and Rosanna warned Craig that the young woman had a serious crush on him, but Craig was oblivious.\n\n\nRosanna told Craig to put a stop to the crush, but Craig said that Teri was just showing that she was \"grateful.\"  Rosanna advised him to clear the air, as Teri returned with a dry shirt and gave him a kiss on the cheek for all the culinary upgrades.  Craig invited the two women to join him at the Lakeview for lunch.  When they arrived there, Rosanna received a call from the art director of the vitamin water campaign, and he requested a conference with her immediately.\n\n\nRosanna was alone with Teri for a few moments while Craig went to his room at the hotel to make arrangements for Johnny.  Rosanna took the opportunity to \"be straight\" with Teri, and she said that Craig Montgomery always had an agenda, and for her to beware.  Teri argued that Craig had only been lovely to her, and she reminded Rosanna that she was not some dewy-eyed teenager who had never been out in the world.  She said there was nothing she had that Craig would want, but Rosanna had a snide comment about that.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Rosanna left, Teri went to Craig's hotel room and knocked.  She began to cry when he answered the door, and she rushed into his arms.\n\n\nFaith was worried for her family, but she did not want anything to do with her mother.  She asked to hang out with Parker, who almost told his cousin that he needed to find Liberty at the picnic, but instead he told her that she could stay there as long as she needed.\n\n\nLiberty returned to the picnic and found Tony sitting in his car, drinking.  She climbed into the back seat and asked him why he was sitting so far away.  He joined her in the back, and she took the bottle from him and had a long drink.  Liberty kissed him, and things progressed rapidly after that.\n\n\nAt the farm, Lily walked in looking for Faith, but the girl was not there.  She explained to Meg and Emma that her daughter had \"misinterpreted\" a hug that Damian had given to Lily in consolation, which infuriated Meg.  Meg hurled accusations, and Lily began shouting back.  Emma cried out that they should be thinking about Holden, and whoever could not do that could leave her house immediately.\n\n\nDamian wandered into Lily and Holden's bedroom, and he spotted Holden's will on the bed.  He was reading it when Lily's phone rang.  He answered it and spoke with Officer Grady from the Kentucky State Police.  Grady wanted to talk to Lily, but Damian asked what he wanted.  The officer requested Holden's dental records, so they could get a positive identification on a body they had recovered from the burned truck.  Damian said that he would arrange that, and he then gave his cell phone number to the cop.  Damian requested that all calls concerning Holden go to his phone to spare Mrs. Snyder more pain.\n\n\n",
