The two searched the house and found a key hidden in a puzzle box. While the search ensued, Susan confronted Ric about where he had been when Alison had returned home a few nights before. Susan told him that his lame alibis had not convinced her, so Ric explained that he had been suffering from anxiety attacks. He claimed that he had been huddled on the bathroom floor, breathing into a paper bag, the night Alison stopped over. \n\n\nRic insisted that he was merely embarrassed by his weakness, but Susan looked skeptical. Ric persuaded Susan to go with him to a clinic in Florida for treatment of his anxiety disorder, and the two left the hospital for home. Back at Susan's, Chris and Alison were trying to clean up evidence of their search when Alison spotted Susan and Ric at the front door. She cried to Chris, \"We're so busted!\"\n\n\nRosanna, her eyes brimming with tears, told Craig that she loved him so much that she wanted to adopt a baby with him. Overwhelmed by Rosanna's love and sincere desire, Craig agreed that they would contact an adoption agency. Rosanna covered his face with kisses.\n\n\nMike arrived at a cabin in Australia in his search for Katie. He found part of Simon's last letter to Katie in the stove, and he was certain that Katie would never have left that letter behind. He shoved the paper fragment into his pocket, and the door burst open. A man pointed a shotgun at Mike, and Mike explained that he was looking for Katie Frasier. The man admitted that Katie had been there a few days before, but he said that she had taken off. \n\n\nMike was obviously suspicious, but he accepted the offer of a cold beer and a place to sleep for the night. When his host left the room to get a blanket for Mike, Mike stood up to call Margo on his cell phone. Immediately, Mike realized that the man had drugged his beer, and Mike fell to the floor. The man kicked Mike in the ribs and pocketed the cell phone then went directly to his own phone in the other room and placed a call, which Mike overheard. \"Find Simon Frasier. Tell him we've got his wife.\"\n\n\nAt Java Underground, Bonnie begged Isaac to help her sneak Sara out of the shelter, fly with the two of them to Toronto, get married the next morning, and then fly to Europe. When Isaac agreed, but insisted that he finish his inventory first, Bonnie left, whispering, \"Isaac, I'm so sorry.\" At about the same time, T. Marshall Travers went to the airport to get his daughter's casket. When he found the casket filled with bags of sand, he told the surprised employees, \"Keep it. Somebody's going to need it!\" \n\n\nMarshall headed directly to Jessica's apartment to tell her about the empty casket. He deduced that Sara was actually his lost daughter, Zara, and he demanded that Jessica tell him the truth, insisting that, if she refused, he would find out for himself. After Jessica made Marshall promise not to go after Bonnie, she told him the truth, that Sara was his daughter. \n\n\nBack at Java, Isaac realized that Bonnie had left, and he rushed after her. Bonnie went to the shelter to find Sara to say that she was taking Sara out of the country. Isaac arrived at Jessica's and told them that Bonnie had gone to get Sara, so Marshall, Jessica, and Isaac rushed to the shelter, where they found Bonnie and Sara. Marshall shouted, \"Don't go anywhere with my daughter!\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Alison and Chris discovered a puzzle box, which Alison managed to open, revealing a small key. They deduced that it is the key to a bank safe deposit box, and Alison was convinced they will be able to get into the box. When Susan told Rick that she couldn't believe him anymore, he told her he had a psychiatric disorder, and said he had been having a panic attack in the bathroom the night that Alison came for her things. He convinced her to go with him to a Florida clinic, where he can receive \"treatment.\" Craig is hesitant to agree to adoption, saying he felt that he had failed Bryant, and didn't want to fail another one. He also wondered why Rosanna was in such a hurry for a child, and was upset that he felt that she shared more of her feelings with others, like Paul. She insisted that she simply wanted to share a child with the man she loves; he finally agreed to check into adoption. Marshall discovered that Zara's casket was full of nothing but sandbags. When he promised not to go after Bonnie if Jessica was truthful, she admitted that Sarah was his daughter. When Bonnie couldn't convince Isaac to leave the country immediately with Sarah and her, she decided to go without him. Isaac told Jessica about Bonnie's escape plans, but didn't know that Marshall was in the next room. Marshall, Jessica, and Isaac raced to the shelter, and Marshall announced that Bonnie was not going anywhere with his daughter. In Australia, Mike arrived at the Frasier farm. He found Simon's letter, half-burned, then was held at gunpoint by a stranger, who said Katie had been there, but had left. Mike suspected otherwise, but agreed to have a beer with the man. Just as he tried to call Margo, he passed out, realizing on the way down that he had been drugged. When he came to, he heard the man on the phone, telling someone to tell Simon they had his wife.",
