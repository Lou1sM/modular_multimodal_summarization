She gave him box seat tickets to a baseball game and a coupon for an evening of free babysitting. They talked, and Dusty told Lucy he'd had no right to blame Jennifer's death on her. Lucy told him she felt like a failure as a doctor because she'd let Jennifer die; Dusty told her to stop saying things like that, or he'd get mad. The babysitter arrived downstairs with Johnny, who told Dusty that he was having trouble falling asleep, so Dusty took Johnny and told the sitter she could go home. He bid Lucy goodnight and took Johnny upstairs.\n\n\nParker asked Carly why Simon had to go with them to the drive-in movie. Simon told Parker he'd never been to a drive-in movie before, saying they didn't have them in Australia. He said he'd driven into a house and into a pool before, but never into a movie, and he made Parker laugh. Sage and J.J. appeared downstairs, and Carly sent them all out to the car. At the movie, Parker promptly climbed into the front seat between Simon and Carly.\n\n\nSimon asked Carly to go get some popcorn for him, and when she left, he asked Parker why he'd felt like he had to climb up front to sit. Parker said he just wanted to know what Simon's intentions were towards his mom. Simon said that he worked with Carly and would like to be her friend, but that was all there was to it. Parker, looking relieved, said, \"Keep it that way!\" as Carly overheard and smiled.\n\n\nBy the end of the movie, everyone in the car had fallen asleep except Simon. They went back to Carly's house, and Carly asked J.J. to show Simon where Sage's room was, so he could carry her up and put her in her bed. She then asked Parker how the movie was and whether it had ended up being okay that Simon had been there; Parker said he supposed it wasn't too bad. Simon went back down, and Carly invited him to have a cup of coffee, but glancing at Parker, he declined; Carly walked him to the door and thanked him for being so understanding, and he kissed her on the cheek and left.\n\n\nBarbara saw Gwen at Java and expressed concern about her attack, adding that she'd heard that Will had saved Gwen's life. She seemed to think that should have put them well on their way to reconciliation, but Gwen said that Will didn't seem to be going in that direction and that he was at the Wagon Wheel Motel with Jade. Barbara told Gwen it was all Jade's fault, and she was manipulating Will while he was distraught. Barbara told Gwen she'd figure out a way to get Jade out of the picture.\n\n\nAlthough Gwen protested that it was probably not a good idea, Barbara charged off anyway. Casey arrived and sat down, and after Gwen told him the advice she'd gotten from Carly and from Barbara, he told her she should stop listening to everyone else and let her own instincts lead the way. When she asked what he thought she should do about Will, he told her to do nothing.\n\n\nAt the Wagon Wheel Motel, as she dropped her robe and dressed in front of Will, Jade told him he could play the fool over Gwen if he wanted to. Will grabbed her and kissed her, and they had sex. She told Will that she realized he didn't love her, but she thought they could be \"friends, with benefits.\" He said he wanted Gwen back and that he couldn't accomplish that if they were friends of any kind, so he thought it was best if they didn't see each other at all anymore. Jade got huffy and started to dress to leave, when Barbara pounded on the door, demanding that Will let her in.\n\n\nJade hurried into the bathroom, but when Barbara walked in and looked at the room, she immediately realized what was going on and opened the bathroom door. She berated Jade for being disgraceful and asked Will if \"some cheesy motel and some girl you don't care about\" was really what he wanted, telling him he was ruining his life and self-destructing. Angry, Will asked Jade if she had anything decent to wear, telling her they were going to go out. Barbara said, \"Your sister would roll over in her grave,\" and left. Jade put on her best dress, and she and Will left the motel.\n\n\nBarbara returned to Java, where she told Gwen that Will was taking Jade out on the town to spite her. She said she'd have to think up something else, but Gwen said Barbara had done enough for the moment, and Barbara left. Casey sat back down and told Gwen he was tired of trying to get Maddie to open up to him and get back together with him; he said maybe she really was the slasher, and he thought he and Gwen should both get away for the weekend so they could quit worrying about Will and Maddie. He told her there was a big party planned up at the lake, and he thought they should go together.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dallas and Margo wondered what it meant that Maddie had lied about the frat party in Chicago. Dallas, playing devil's advocate, wondered whether Maddie had also lied about being sexually assaulted, but Margo said she didn't think so. They decided to go upstairs to question her about the lie.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Eve's suite, Maddie was upset when Louis entered the room and locked the door to the suite. He told her they needed to become \"close\" again, saying she loved him. When she told him that he'd raped her, he denied that it had been rape, telling her she had been the one who had gone after him, dressing in tight tops and short skirts and always turning to him for advice. He told her they had a \"special\" relationship that was \"private and secret.\" When he touched her, Maddie told him if he raped her again, she would tell Eve; he asked her who she thought Eve would believe.\n\n\nAs Louis grabbed her, Maddie grabbed a knife from a table and threatened Louis, saying, \"I said, 'No!'\" Louis replied, \"Oh, Maddie likes it rough,\" and grabbed the knife from her, but at that moment, Margo and Dallas knocked on the door and called out for Maddie. Louis told Maddie that he could get to Eve and Henry if she talked then he let Margo and Dallas in. Margo took one look at Maddie and asked what was going on, but Louis said they had just been talking. Margo said she needed to ask Maddie some more questions at the station, but Louis objected, saying she was a minor and should have a family member or her attorney present before the police asked any more questions.\n\n\nEve and Henry returned at that moment and agreed with Louis that Maddie shouldn't be questioned alone. They all sat down, and Dallas told Maddie that he'd found out there never had been a frat party in Chicago. Although Maddie admitted having lied about the frat house party, when Margo asked if Maddie really had been assaulted, she nodded, and Margo said that Maddie needed to tell them who'd hurt her.\n\n\n",
