Chris was overjoyed to return to work, but before Chris could start his day, Bob warned Chris to keep his distance from Alison. Chris told his dad he could not do that because he still cared for his ex-girlfriend, but Bob advised Chris to meet someone new and forget about Alison. Chris tried to convince his father that Alison was the woman for him and he wanted a future with her. Bob realized he was fighting a losing battle and told Chris to tread lightly and always consider Alison's feelings so they did not have a repeat of Alison's sexual harassment lawsuit against Chris and the hospital. \n\n\nHolden brought Aaron home from the hospital and Emma happily welcomed them both back to the farm. Moments later, Alison arrived and offered to get Aaron settled in his room. With Alison and Aaron upstairs, Emma asked Holden if he was back at the farm for good, too. Holden explained he was still staying at the Lakeview, but Emma thought Holden should be there to take care of his son while he recuperated. Holden explained he needed a fresh start and time away from the farm. Emma said she understood, but once Holden went to take care of his chores, she seemed upset by her son's decision. \n\n\nUp in Aaron's room, Alison tried to make him comfortable in bed, but all Aaron wanted to do was talk about their relationship. Alison explained she was not ready for anything more than friendship and did not want to lose him. Aaron agreed to respect her wishes. Alison noticed Aaron's wound was bleeding through his bandage and decided to check on it. Once she did, she noticed the injury looked infected and decided to call the hospital to get Aaron's doctor to order antibiotics. Chris answered the phone and Alison tried to disguise her voice to avoid talking to him, but Chris was not fooled. Alison explained where she was and what was going on, so Chris, in an obvious attempt to impress Alison, offered to come by and check on Aaron's wound. Alison told Aaron who was coming to examine him and Aaron was not happy. \n\n\nWhen Chris arrived, Aaron did not want him to touch him, but begrudgingly allowed Alison to take his bandage off so Chris could see his stitches. Once Chris saw the wound he knew it was infected and Alison convinced Aaron to let Chris take a closer look. Chris gave Aaron a shot of antibiotics and then told Alison that Aaron would need four shots a day to fight off the infection. Aaron asked Alison if she was all right with coming out to the farm that often and she said she was happy to take care of him. Alison and Chris left separately to return to the hospital. \n\n\nOnce at the hospital, Alison saw Chris in the hall and the two exchanged smiles. Alison stopped and thanked Chris for helping Aaron. Chris asked Alison if she was still uncomfortable being around him and he offered to keep his distance if she wanted him to. Alison said she was happy to work with Chris again and did not expect him to run and hide from her. \n\n\nAs Meg and Paul watched, Bonnie argued Paul's case for continuing the Snyder farm development project with the Oakdale planning commission. The board was reluctant to let the building continue until Paul could get rid of all the toxins in the soil. In a last-ditch effort to save the project, Bonnie promised all the contamination could be cleaned up in 30 days. A short time later, the board returned and told Paul he had his 30 days to get the site completely clean or it would be shut down. \n\n\nMike was at the construction site, desperately trying to figure out how the contamination of the soil was so high. As Mike worried about the project, Lily arrived with a surprise picnic dinner for her new friend. However, Mike was not in the mood to eat and told Lily he was not ready to push their relationship any further. Lily was shocked by Mike's lack of interest in her and even though he tried to convince her it was work, she left in a huff. As Holden worked on the farm, he caught a glimpse of Lily as she stormed off, and chased after her. \n\n\nOnce he found her, Holden asked Lily if she was all right. Lily lashed out at Holden in anger and said she was fine, but did not want Holden following her anymore. Holden told her it was an old habit of his to check up on her, but one he was sure he needed to break. Holden walked off and Lily pushed the picnic basket in anger. \n\n\nAfter the meeting, Meg and Paul returned to the worksite to share the good news with Mike, but he told them that new tests showed higher levels of contamination than they had previously found and there was no way the work could be completed in 30 days. Meg knew that if the work could not be done, Emma would lose everything. Mike explained to Paul that it would take an incredible amount of money to complete the project on time. Paul told Mike not to worry about money and do whatever it took to get the work done. Meg was not sure that Paul had made the right choice and did not want him to go bankrupt to save the project. Paul told Meg not to worry about anything and guaranteed her he would find the money. \n\n\nMeg went to tell her mom that it looked like Paul was going to be able to save the project. Emma was relieved to hear that everything was moving forward and began to cry when she heard the news. She was grateful that Paul was working to help her and told Meg that she could see the good in Paul. \n\n\nWhile Meg visited her mother, Paul went to Metro and told Henry he needed money. Paul explained to Henry that he knew Henry could introduce him to people who could get him the money for the project. Henry was reluctant to set Paul up with a loan shark, but Paul said he needed the money right away. Henry gave Paul the information he needed and warned him to be careful. \n\n\nPaul returned to Fairwinds and met with Derek Coburn, a friend of a friend of Henry's, who agreed to give Paul the money he needed. Derek handed Paul a briefcase full of cash and told him he had 30 days to repay the money in full. He wished Paul luck on his venture and started to leave just as Meg returned home. After Derek left, Meg wanted to know who he was and Paul lied and said he was a new consultant to the farm project. Meg accepted Paul's answer and the two decided to spend some time focusing on their relationship. \n\n\nAfter Mike talked to Paul and Meg, he went and found Lily in the woods and apologized for dismissing her dinner invitation earlier. He tried to explain that work had been overwhelming him, but he was ready to talk. Lily tearfully said she did not want to keep moving forward if Mike was not interested in her, but Mike said he was very attracted to her and wanted to see where their relationship would go. Lily and Mike resolved their differences and agreed to have dinner together after Lily took care of something at the farm. Lily went to find Holden and apologized for her earlier outburst. Holden accepted and admitted they needed to find a way to deal with their new relationship. Holden admitted that since he was no longer seeing Carly, he believed things would get easier between him and Lily. Holden then asked if Lily was done dating Mike as well, but at that moment Mike arrived to pick up Lily for their date. Lily said Holden was wrong and left with Mike to have dinner. \n\n\nNoah and Luke arrived at the Lakeview to meet with Lucinda about Luke's charitable foundation. Lucinda explained she had found a director for the organization and introduced the boys to Brian Wheatley. Brian was enthusiastic about Luke's ideas, but told everyone he was only taking the job for Lucinda. He gushed over Lucinda's business savvy and good looks, but told the boys to look over his credentials before they made a decision about hiring him. \n\n\nAfter their meeting, Noah got a call from work and learned he did not need to go in that night. Noah asked Luke if he would like to go on a date and the two happily planned a night of fun together. \n\n\nLucinda phoned Brian and asked him to meet her at Worldwide. Brian was impressed with the offices and was happy to learn that Luke had hired him to run the charitable foundation. Lucinda welcomed Brian to the Worldwide family. Brian offered to take Lucinda to dinner to celebrate his new position, and she accepted. \n\n\nAfter her day in front of the planning commission, Bonnie returned to Metro to help Henry get set up for the night. Later that night, Lucinda and Brian showed up for dinner at the club, but once Brian heard the music, he pulled Lucinda onto the dance floor. As the two danced and laughed, Luke and Noah showed up ready for their romantic date and were happily surprised to see Brian and Lucinda on the dance floor. Noah decided it would be a great idea if he and Luke had a dance as well, so the couple joined Lucinda and Brian. \n\n\nAs Henry worked the bar at Metro, Bonnie asked him why Paul had stopped by earlier. Henry warned Bonnie to stay clear of Paul, and this bit of advice caused Bonnie to wonder what Paul and Henry were up to. Henry refused to say, but warned his friend to drop Paul as a client.\n  \n\n\n",
