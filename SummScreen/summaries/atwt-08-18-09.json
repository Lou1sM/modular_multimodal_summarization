    "soap_central": "\n\n \nJanet visited Carly's house, looking for her sister, Teri.  Rosanna told her that Teri was at the Lakeview with Craig.  Rosanna gave Janet a cup of coffee and mentioned that Teri was a young woman who could be very impressed by a powerful man like Craig.  Janet demanded to know if Craig had acted inappropriately with her sister, and said that, if so, she would kill him.  Rosanna said no, but that Teri had a \"look of dazed admiration in her eyes\" when she looked at Craig.  Janet had faith in her little sister, but she took the caveat under advisement.\n\n\nTeri had thrown herself into Craig's arms in the doorway of his hotel room, but he managed to disengage himself and ask her what was wrong.  Teri said that Rosanna had accused her of making moves on Craig.  Craig apologized and explained that Rosanna hated him and was taking it out on Teri.  The girl wanted to know why Rosanna thought that Craig was such a monster, and he answered that in the past, he had not been very nice to Rosanna.  Teri defended Craig, much to his amusement, and they sat and talked.\n\n\nCraig said that Rosanna had accused him of terrible things, none of which he had done.  He maintained his innocence, but said that he had served some time before he was completely exonerated.  Teri announced that she was starving, so Craig, who had promised her lunch, told her to order whatever she wanted from room service.  During lunch, they talked about Carly and Craig's plans after Carly returned from rehab.\n\n\nCraig finally said that he had eaten and drunk enough, and he needed a rest.  He lay on the couch while Teri cleaned up and put the room service cart in the hall.  She spoke to Craig, but he was already asleep, so Terri took off her shoes and curled up on his arm on the couch.  Craig's eyes flew open when he felt her next to him, just as someone knocked on the door.  He flew off the couch, assuming his visitor was the babysitter returning Johnny.\n\n\nIt was Janet at the door, however, and Craig invited her in.  Janet saw her sister curled on the couch, and she ordered Terri to get up and get out.  Teri said that they were only having lunch, and Janet calmed down a bit.  She told the two of them that Holden had died in a car crash in Kentucky, and Craig was shocked.  He worried about Lily, and excused himself to go into the bathroom.  Janet took the opportunity to read Teri the riot act about her behavior.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Damian called Officer Grady at the crash site and told him that he had forwarded Holden's dental records to the State Patrol office.  He expected them to receive the records within the hour.  Lily walked in, still upset, but she refused to talk about what was bothering her and went to her room.  She collapsed, crying, on her bed, and Damian knocked on her door.  Lily dismissed him, but Damian entered anyway.  Lily cried for her husband.\n\n\nMeg broke the news about Holden's accident to Jack, but she did not comment when Jack asked how his cousin was.  She finally had to tell him that the body the police had removed from the truck was too badly burned to identify right away.  Jack was stunned, and he left immediately to go see Lily.  Damian opened the door to him at Lily's, so Jack said that he had found out that Faith was with Parker.  He also asked Damian what the Kentucky police were doing, and Damian said that he had sent the dental records already, so it should not be long before they had a positive identification.\n\n\nJack said he would tell Lily about Faith, so Damian left.  Jack knocked on Lily's door and announced himself.  He went in, and a sobbing Lily threw herself into Jack's arms.  Jack told her that Damian had sent the dental records to Kentucky, but Lily was shocked that the police had not yet identified the victim.  She suddenly became hopeful that the body was not Holden, but Jack explained how slim the odds were that it was not.  Lily begged Jack not to take that tiny bit of hope away from her.  She cited Jack's own example of his \"rising from the dead\" after his accident off the bridge years before.\n\n\nLily got hysterical again and showed Jack the watch that Holden had been wearing.  Jack remembered it well, as it had belonged to their grandfather.  Lily was upset that Jack was so accepting of Holden's death, but Jack explained that Lily loved his cousin so much that she was in denial.  Lily insisted that Holden's loss did not feel final, and she began to cry again.  She vowed that she would not give up on her husband until all the tests were in.\n\n\nJack asked Lily's permission to help with the investigation, and Lily allowed it.  He asked to borrow the watch in case it had any forensic evidence on it, and she reluctantly let him have it.  Lily asked Jack to go, so that she could be alone.  She dozed off a while on her bed, but then woke with a start, calling Holden's name.  She did not understand why she did not feel as if Holden was really gone.\n\n\nAt the farm, Damian embraced Meg and then told her that he had sent Holden's records to Kentucky.  Meg was feeling guilty because she had argued with Lily about Damian's hug.  Damian calmed her and promised to let her lean on him.  Meg wanted to ask him a very serious question; she wanted to know if the two of them were still together.  Damian assured her that they were, but if the police identified the body as Holden's, then Damian had to be there for Lily, as well.\n\n\nMeg understood that, and she talked about how Holden was part of some of her first memories of her life.  Suddenly, she felt a strong urge to see the crash site, and she begged Damian to take her to Kentucky.  Damian agreed, and they took off.   They found the ravine, but Meg insisted on viewing it by herself, so Damian went to speak with the state patrolman.  Damian asked the cop if they had run the dental records yet, and the trooper said that the teeth from the body were so badly damaged that they could not be compared to the records.  They would have to extract DNA samples from the teeth themselves, so there was no positive identification yet.\n\n\nThe officer said that it would take a while for that process, but Damian wished to expedite matters.  He took the patrolman aside and had a private conversation with him, and then Damian joined Meg at the edge of the ravine.  He comforted her as the patrolman approached, and Meg asked the officer if they had identified the body yet.\n\n\nCraig spoke with Rosanna at Carly's and asked if she had sent Janet to check up on him.  He said that he was glad if she had, because he thought she might have been right about Teri.  He told Rosanna that Teri had \"kind of made a move\" on him, and Rosanna burst out laughing.  Craig said that Teri was a sweet kid, but he was in love with Carly.  Rosanna kept laughing, and she told him to get himself out of his own messes.  Craig sincerely asked for her help, so Rosanna suggested something very radical for Craig: he should tell Teri the truth.  Craig agreed, but he wanted Rosanna with him when he did.\n\n\nTeri arrived and Craig admitted that he \"may have acted inappropriately.\"  He said that their relationship had to remain strictly professional.  Teri began to giggle, and she said that the only person under the wrong impression was Craig.  She assured him that he never had anything to worry about in that department, and she excused herself to take a shower.   Rosanna complimented Craig that he had handled the situation especially well, and then she threw him out and went into the kitchen.  Teri sneaked down the stairs and went out on the porch, grinning, to watch Craig leave.\n\n\nJack took Holden's watch to the farm, and got there just as Meg was returning from Kentucky.  They talked about Jack's visit with Lily and how she had compared the crash to Jack's incident several years before.  Meg told Jack that the police had made a positive identification from the dental records, as Janet walked in.  Janet comforted her husband, and Meg told them that Damian was on his way to tell Lily.  Janet and Jack went out on the porch, and Jack talked about his memories with Holden and their grandfather.  He told Janet how lucky they were and how much he loved her.\n\n\nLily went to the Snyder pond and remembered her first meeting with Holden when they were teenagers.  A vision of Holden appeared from behind her and spoke to her.  Lily begged Holden to stay with her, but Holden said that he could not.  Lily felt his hands on her shoulders, but when she turned, it was Damian she saw.  Damian lied and said that the police had made a positive identification of Holden from the dental records, and he put his arms around a weeping Lily.  Meg watched them from a short distance.\n\n\n",
