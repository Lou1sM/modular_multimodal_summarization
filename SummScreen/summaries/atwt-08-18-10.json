    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the hospital, Kim discovered that Bob wasn't dressed for the board of trustees' party that evening. She sensed that Bob was nervous about the board's choice for chief of staff. Bob worried that Chris would drop the ball, but Kim asked her husband to have faith in their son. Bob stated that Chris had to convince the entire board, but Chris was too cocky. \"Maybe he's lazy,\" Bob remarked, and Kim exclaimed, \"Oh, Bob!\" Bob stated that Chris had to earn the position, and Kim stubbornly asserted that Chris would earn it indeed.\n\n\n       On Katie's doorstep, Chris implored Katie to join him at the party, but Katie couldn't keep up with their flip-flipping relationship. Chris owned up to his erratic behavior and claimed the pressure for the chief of staff job had gotten to him. He convinced her to attend the party with him, and as she changed clothes, a sharp pain hit Chris. He winced as he sat on the sofa.\n\n\n       At Lily's house, Luke accused Reid of lying to him. Revealing that he knew Reid had been at Lakeview, Luke wondered when brain surgeons had started making house calls. Reid claimed that he'd been visiting a patient. When Reid refused to divulge the patient's name, Luke accused him of hiding his cheating behind patient-doctor confidentiality.\n\n\nReid asked Luke where he'd gotten his information, and Luke revealed that Noah had seen Reid with his arm around a man at the Lakeview. Reid explained that he'd helped the sick patient to his hotel room. Luke assumed that Reid was saying Noah had overreacted. \"He overstated. You're the one that's overreacting,\" Reid replied. Reid found it discomforting that Luke didn't trust him, and the apologetic Luke decided to prepare for the party, because Reid needed someone to prevent him from insulting the entire board.\n\n\n       At the cocktail party at Metro, Luke and Reid encountered Katie and Chris. They all teased each other about the doctors' professional rivalry, but Katie remarked that the men should be friends no matter what. Glaring at Chris, Reid quipped that friends could tell each other things they didn't want to hear.\n\n\nKim and Bob arrived and urged the candidates to mingle. Reid pulled Chris aside to say that he looked like a wreck and needed hospitalization. Reid again urged Chris to reveal the truth, but Chris insisted that he was on his own timeframe.\n\n\nAs Reid and Chris took questions from the board of trustees, Luke whispered to Katie that Reid was mopping the floor with her boyfriend. When Chris couldn't formulate meaningful answers to the questions, Kim asked Bob what was wrong with their son. Reid covered for Chris, and the trustees were impressed with an idea that Reid had attributed to Chris.\n\n\n       Bob called for a break, and Reid pulled Chris aside to warn him that he was doing irreparable damage to his heart muscles. Katie approached in time to overhear Reid insisting that Chris see a cardiologist. Katie expressed her concern, and Chris lied that he and Reid were debating about who should be the new cardiologist on Memorial's staff. Chris stated that he wanted someone local, but Reid preferred John Dixon.\n\n\nReid strode off, and Katie questioned Chris about his spacey answers that evening. He assured her that he had a strategy, but she dubiously asked what it could be. Bob and Kim approached with their concerns, and Bob guessed that Chris didn't want the position. Chris asked what would make his father think that. Bob cited Chris's odd behavior and Reid's earlier save.\n\n\nChris claimed that he hadn't needed the save, and Kim and Katie reasoned that Reid had made himself look bad by butting in. Puzzled by that conclusion, Bob gravely said that Chris wasn't faring as well as Reid. Chris assured his parents that he'd finish the evening off well.\n\n\n       At the bar, Chris told Katie that he'd done enough schmoozing for one evening. \"Are you serious?\" she asked. He figured that the board loved him, and Katie skeptically agreed to leave.\n\n\n       Bob and Kim saw the couple duck out, and Bob figured that either Chris didn't want the job, or he thought he had it made because he was Bob's son. Bob declared that Chris was on his own, and Kim said she didn't think Bob wanted Chris to have the job. Bob claimed that he'd dreamed of having his son assume his role, but Chris had to prove that he deserved it. She hoped that the chief of staff competition wouldn't get between her and Bob, and he said they at least agreed that they both wanted what was best for Chris.\n\n\nLuke approached Reid to find out why he'd helped Chris with the questions. Reid made up excuses, but Luke said he didn't like living with a parade of lies. Reid admitted that Chris was his hotel patient. \"He's very sick, and I'm the only one who knows,\" Reid said. After Reid explained the whole story, he admitted that he wouldn't have cared about his competition that way a few months earlier. Reid felt that he was changing, and he had Luke to thank for it.\n\n\n       At Katie's doorstep, Katie noted that Chris seemed as if he'd recovered from whatever had been disconcerting him earlier. She worried that he might decide to turn cold to her, but he assured her that he wouldn't. As she opened the door, he grimaced through a pain. She invited him inside and said Jacob was with Alison. Chris kissed Katie, and they made out on the sofa.\n\n\n       At Fairwinds, Henry concluded that Iris was behind Barbara's disappearance. Paul stated that Iris had always been \"a bit of a mooch,\" but kidnapping was a big leap. Henry thought they should at least investigate it, and the brothers left to search Barbara's room again.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Gwen and Will confronted Iris about drinking at the Lakeview, running up bar tabs, and dressing like Barbara. Iris called the drinking a momentary lapse. Grabbing Iris' arm, Gwen threatened to take her to an AA meeting or to rehab. Iris quibbled about going, and Will questioned Iris about lying to Henry about Barbara's clothes. Iris admitted that she was jealous and had wanted to know what it was like to wear nice things.\n\n\n       Will stepped away to take a call from Paul, and Iris lied that she'd been on her way to church. Will returned to say that Paul and Henry wanted to meet him at the Lakeview. Iris urged the couple to go, but Gwen insisted that she and Iris were headed to the AA meeting. Gwen warned Iris that it was her last chance. Will ordered Iris to change clothes, and he left.\n\n\nDuring the AA meeting later, Gwen forced Iris to introduce herself and tell her story. Iris explained that she'd started drinking at 13, when her mother had been going through husbands like babies went through diapers. She claimed that her mother's fourth husband had gotten her hooked on alcohol, and he'd abused her.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds after the meeting, Gwen sarcastically stated that Iris had told quite a story to the AA members. It was a tale that Gwen had never heard before. Iris replied that she'd always tried to keep the nasty details of her past from Gwen. Iris said she was going upstairs to pray; however, when she got to her room, she packed a bag and called Barbara's bank to set up a wire transfer. They asked if she had the password, and a grinning Iris replied that she did.\n\n\n       When Will arrived at the Lakeview, Paul shared Henry's theory that Iris was behind Barbara's disappearance. Will wouldn't put anything past the peculiar Iris, and Henry supposed that she'd nabbed Emily, too. Margo called to advise Henry that someone had used Barbara's credit card to order chilidogs and bourbon at the Eight Ball Tavern. Will said that it sounded like something Iris would order.\n\n\nThe men tried to track Iris down at the AA meeting, but it had already ended. Will called Gwen, who said she and Iris were at Fairwinds. Will warned Gwen not to let Iris leave the house.\n\n\nWhen Will, Paul, and Henry arrived at Fairwinds, they apprised Gwen of their theory about Iris. A worried Gwen went upstairs to get Iris, and Paul suddenly smelled smoke. The men deduced that the smoke was coming from the cellar.\n\n\n       In the cellar, Emily and Barbara managed to bicker with each other as the circuit box on the wall crackled and popped. Emily exclaimed that they'd be burned alive, and it was Barbara's fault for suggesting that they move the beam. Still bound to the collapsed beam, Barbara and Emily shimmed across the floor, to no avail. Smoke billowed from the circuit box, and the coughing women realized that the broken smoke detector had fallen in the crash.\n\n\n       Emily and Barbara argued more, and Barbara decided that they shouldn't use their final breaths fighting. Barbara sincerely apologized for her unfair treatment of Emily, but in return, a shocked Emily only rendered a halfhearted apology for her misdeeds. Barbara snapped that Emily couldn't cut her any slack, even in death. Barbara wondered if they could be friends if they ever escaped. Emily said it wasn't possible. Barbara begged Emily to let her make amends, but Emily said she couldn't.\n\n\n       Suddenly the cellar door opened. Will, Paul, and Henry charged into the room to find the women tied up on the floor. Coughing, Barbara thanked God. As Will went to the fuse box, Henry and Paul untied the women and held them closely. Emily and Barbara rattled off the details of their ordeal, and Paul asked who'd held them captive. \"Iris!\" the women both asserted.\n\n\n       Will rushed upstairs and encountered Gwen, who'd just returned to the study. Will explained that Iris had held Emily and Barbara hostage, and Iris might have tried to burn down the house. Gwen informed him that Iris had packed her bags and disappeared. \n\n\n",
