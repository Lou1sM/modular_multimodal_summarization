Keith gets a phone call from \"work\" and leaves to talk in private to the person on the phone; he tells the person that it shouldn't matter that he took Luke for a private flight on the plane and that of course he knows not to leave his work lying around where Luke or anyone else could see it. Meanwhile, Luke tells Holden that Keith jumped on him once when he asked about his job, and Holden questions Luke, trying to figure out exactly what it is that Keith does. Luke thinks it has something to do with acting as a private supplier of some kind. Luke also tries again to encourage Holden to continue to pursue Lily, but Holden says that dinner the other night didn't go over very well. When Keith returns, Holden tells Luke he needs a minute alone with him; after that, Holden asks Keith what kind of work he's doing, but Keith is deliberately vague about it, implying that it has to do with transporting medical supplies. Holden warns Keith not to do anything that might hurt Lily, Luke, or his other kids, and Keith says Holden's got nothing to worry about.\n\n\nBob Hughes goes to visit Lucinda, telling her he's disappointed that Lucinda didn't tell him herself that she has cancer. He says that Sierra and Lily asked him to visit Lucinda and reassure her that everything will be okay; she asks if that is what he has come for, and he says no, that he can't give her those kinds of assurances. He tells her that her doctor is as close to a miracle worker as they come and that she is in good hands. Lucinda describes the miserable time she's been having since beginning the chemotherapy, and Bob tells her that although that shouldn't get much worse, it will continue to happen, and that it might wear her down. Lucinda is upset with her body's betrayal of her, but Bob tells her that she is still in charge of her will and that she might yet live to be 100. Bob jokingly tells Lucinda that losing her hair is penance for all the years she made the rest of Oakdale pull out their hair.\n\n\nAfter Bob leaves, a woman arrives with a portable massage table; Lucinda asks where she's come from, and the woman, who says her name is Bev, explains that she works at Memorial Hospital and that Meg asked her to come by to give Lucinda a massage. Lucinda says she has a regular masseuse for that, but Bev says she knows how to work with cancer patients who are experiencing tenderness they didn't experience before. Lucinda asks how she would know what it was like to have cancer, and Bev says she herself had breast cancer last year but it's gone now. When Lucinda questions how Bev was cured, whether by surgery or radiation or chemotherapy, Bev tells her it was none of those things, that she did it herself. Lucinda suspects the woman wants to con her out of money to try some wacky cure for cancer, but Bev says that's not what she's doing and that she'd prefer not to say how she cured her cancer. Lucinda presses her, though, and Bev ultimately agrees to tell her how she did it.\n\n\nIn the courtroom, Gwen becomes upset by the machinations of Carly's attorney and protests when the judge decides that she must name the baby's father. Cass Winthrop, her attorney, asks for a recess so that Gwen can consider her options and their implications, but Gwen ends up blurting out that Casey Hughes is the father. The judge says that he will need to hear from Casey in person regarding his wishes with regard to the baby, and he tells the lawyers to schedule another hearing date; in the meanwhile, the baby is to stay with Carly and Jack. Cass tells Gwen that he still thinks her chances of keeping the baby are good, because Casey is from an upstanding local family, and if they side with Gwen, she will almost certainly be given her baby back. Gwen tells Will that she thinks she should go warn Casey that the truth has come out before he or his parents find out from someone else; Will offers to go with her, but Gwen says this is something she has to do by herself.\n\n\nCarly wonders whether she's just destroyed her own chances of keeping the baby, and Jack says finding out that the baby is Casey's has certainly made things more complicated. Jack has to leave to go back to the police station; Carly wants Jack to tell Margo the news about Casey, but Jack says Margo is not on the duty roster for today and that it's not up to them to tell her about this anyway. Jack leaves after warning Carly to stay out of it.\n\n\nAs Carly leaves, she runs into Iris; surprised, she asks why Iris is there. Iris says that she has heard that Carly has a new baby in her household, and that she wanted to congratulate her. She tells Carly she's also heard that the baby's adoptive mother was in a terrible accident but that she has left a large amount of money to whoever is raising the baby. Then, Iris tells Carly that she thinks the judge might be interested in hearing that Carly murdered Iris's own baby boy years ago.\n\n\nAt the Hughes household, Casey asks Tom and Margo to sign an application form; looking at it, they see it's for Casey to become an exchange student in Italy. They question him as to why he has suddenly decided he'd like to spend his senior year of high school in Italy, and he ultimately says it's because he misses Celia and is mad at Will. They don't believe that's all there is to the story, and they tell him that they will need time to discuss it before giving him an answer. They leave to go discuss it privately over coffee at Al's, and after they agree that they think they've raised a smart young man who they should trust with decisions like this, Margo's cell phone rings. When she answers, Carly asks whether she's seen Casey recently or if anyone has told her what was going on; Margo says no and asks Carly to explain herself, but Carly just tells her to talk to Casey as soon as possible and ask him herself.\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Hughes house, Gwen arrives and tells Casey what has happened in court. Casey is furious, throwing things around the room and yelling at Gwen for messing up his life. He tells her he doesn't want anything to do with her or the baby, and she shouts at him to just go tell that to the judge, because it will help her get what she wants: her baby. Casey begs her to go tell the judge she's changed her mind and doesn't want the baby after all, and then to plead with Jack and Carly not to tell Margo and Tom about Casey's role in things. Gwen is shocked that Casey would think she would give up her fight to get her son back just because he wants to keep his name out of it. She tells him it's over, that the truth is out and he needs to face it, and as he reacts angrily, his parents walk in the door. Casey tries to make Gwen leave, but Margo won't let her until they find out what's going on. She tells Casey about Carly's phone call and asks what he's supposed to tell her. Gwen turns to face Casey and quietly pleads with him, saying that she should have given Casey more credit months ago and told him the truth then, and she admits that she was wrong; she doesn't want him to make that same mistake now with his parents. When he doesn't respond, she tells him either she can tell them or he can; after waiting for Casey to admit the truth, she looks at him with disdain and says, \"You coward,\" then turns and tells Tom and Margo, \"Casey is the father of my baby. He can't bring himself to admit that to you, but he's the father of my child.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
