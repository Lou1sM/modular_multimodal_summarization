Alison tried to convince her two suitors that she preferred to think of their conflict as an opportunity to get over their difficulties, but Aaron wasn't convinced. Susan stepped in and offered to examine Aaron and thus solved the problem. Aaron got a good report; his wound was healing nicely. \n\n\nEmma was concerned at the farm and told Mike that her veterinarian had found that the farm-grown feed that she gave the livestock was probably also contaminated. She was also worried that the peaches in her pies were tainted. They discussed whether the toxic land might affect the children who spent so much time there, and Meg reassured her mother that Paul was doing everything possible to make sure the project was safe and successful. \n\n\nMike put in a call to Paul and asked him to come to the site for a discussion. The two of them met, and Mike was especially doubtful that the 30-day reprieve granted by the commission would be realistic for cleaning up the soil. As the men walked the property, they were surprised to meet Emily, who was in reporter mode. She asked Paul if it was true that he was building eco-friendly homes on contaminated land. Paul reminded her that she was on private property, and he assured her and her tape recorder that he was personally doing the appropriate testing and that all the homes built there would be safe. Paul also threatened to take down Emily and her Intruder if she pursued the story. He inadvertently mentioned his investors, which Emily immediately picked up. Emily asked if Paul had secret investors. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison was surprised to see Dani Andropoulos, and introduced her to Chris. Dani remembered that Alison and Chris had once had been engaged but wanted to know if Aaron was Alison's new boyfriend. Alison was befuddled for a minute, but then she answered \"yes.\" Dani asked about Chris's marital status and honed in on him as \"fair game.\" Susan brought Aaron back and invited them to lunch at Al's, and all accepted except Dani, who had an appointment. \n\n\nAt Metro, Derek Coburn, Henry's loan shark connection, came in and struck up a smooth conversation with Bonnie. Henry arrived and Bonnie introduced them. Bonnie then told Henry in front of Derek that she had heard rumors that Paul's project at the Snyder farm was in great jeopardy. Paul was running out of money, she had heard. Derek asked some pointed questions and then left. \n\n\nMike returned to Emma's house to find Meg not feeling well. She was dizzy and felt sick to her stomach. When she almost passed out, Mike volunteered to take her to the hospital, which he did. At Memorial, he left her in a waiting room while he went to find a doctor. \n\n\nPaul followed Emily back to her office and implored her not to write her story on the development. They argued, and Casey interrupted the discussion as Paul threatened to sue Emily. Paul got a call from Meg at the hospital telling him she was there, and Paul hurriedly left. Emily and Casey talked about the developing story, and Casey warned her that Paul was a \"scary guy.\" Emily felt that she needed to break this story for her own feeling of worth, however. Casey helped her find all the paperwork on the project online, and Emily went to work on her story. When she finished, she wanted to celebrate with Casey, but he passed on that and went to class instead. \n\n\nAt Al's, Susan, Aaron, and Alison enjoyed lunch and discussed Dani and her immediate attraction to Chris. Aaron referred to the Stewart cousin as an \"in your face\" kind of gal. Susan realized she was late for work and dashed for the hospital, while Aaron and Alison decided to go to the Lakeview so that Aaron could talk with his boss about returning to his bartending job. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dani was offered, and accepted, a job compiling crime statistics for the city. She celebrated by starting to order a drink, but Chris Hughes walked in and made a recommendation for a wine he favored. Dani asked him to share it with her, and the two of them shared a table and the wine. Alison and Aaron found them there and asked what they were celebrating. Dani explained about her new job and Alison realized that meant Dani would be staying in Oakdale. \n\n\nWhen Paul arrived at Memorial looking for Meg, he was surprised to find Mike there. Mike explained that he had been with Meg when she felt ill and had brought her in. Mike left to go back to the farm, and a doctor told Paul that Meg was stable but they were running more tests. Paul went in to sit with his wife when he received a whispered call from Mike, who had found Derek Coburn wandering around the Snyder property. Coburn identified himself as a friend of Paul's and wanted permission to look around. Mike wanted verification of all this from Paul, who gave instructions that Mike was to tell Coburn nothing and that he would be there shortly. Meg told Paul that she had gotten a clean bill of health and was released. She said she would get dressed immediately and go back to the farm with her husband. When she was alone in her room, Meg smiled and patted her belly and spoke that she would fill Paul in on the \"other details\" later. \n\n\nAlison and Aaron returned to the farm also, leaving Dani with her newfound friend, Chris. She thanked him for helping her celebrate her first real job and causally dropped the news that Alison had said that she and Aaron were together. Chris looked gloomy at the news. \n\n\nMeg told Emma the happy news that she was pregnant but that she had not told Paul yet. Paul found Derek Coburn on the property and asked him why he was there. Coburn said he was just protecting his investment, and Paul reminded him that he was in the loan business, not the investment business. Paul strongly suggested he butt out of Paul's business.\n\n\n",
