She quickly jumped back into the elevator and headed for Henry and Vienna's room.  Meanwhile, Henry studied his likeness in the mirror and then asked Vienna if he had an \"eagle glint\" in his eye that looked as if he wanted to take over the world.  Next he asked if anything about his face reminded her of Paul Ryan or James Stenbeck.  Henry was relieved that Vienna saw nothing of the kind.\n\n\nHenry announced that his mother was crazy, and there was no way that James Stenbeck could be his father.  Audrey knocked frantically on the door and shouted for Henry to let her in quickly.  She dashed in and asked for sanctuary.  Henry offered to throw his mother out unless she had an explanation, so Audrey said that \"Jay Stanhope\" was down in the lobby.  Henry said that he knew \"Jay\" was really Raymond Zuma, and he had figured out that he and Audrey were plotting to kill the real Jay Stanhope.\n\n\nAudrey shouted that Henry had it all backwards; Ray was trying to kill her.  Audrey owed Zuma $50,000 for a real estate deal that went bad, and she suggested that they get the money from Henry's father, who would be so delighted to know of Henry's existence that he would shower them with money.  Henry reminded Audrey that the \"late, great James Stenbeck\" was dead, but his mother swore that Stenbeck was alive.\n\n\nHenry wanted nothing to do with Stenbeck, and he told Audrey how James had held him prisoner in the wine cellar at Fairwinds and tried to feed him a poison blowfish.  Audrey said that James owed Henry for that, and perhaps he would ante up the money.  Henry went down to the lobby to check if \"Jay\" was still there, while Audrey pled with Vienna for help.  Henry returned and reported that the coast was clear, so Audrey promised to get proof that Stenbeck was still among the living.  After Audrey left, Vienna almost convinced Henry that Audrey thought she was telling the truth.\n\n\nDusty and Bonnie walked through Old Town, and Dusty remarked that he did not know how Bonnie had gotten him off with just a suspended sentence.  Bonnie said that she was just that good, but then admitted that Paul Ryan's testimony was a big part of Dusty's getting lucky.  Dusty said he was heading to the Worldwide offices because Lucinda Walsh had been in charge of his company too long.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Barbara complained to Paul that no matter how many times James died, he never got any less infuriating or dangerous.  Paul said that his father was not so dangerous in a wheel chair and stuck in the basement, and he planned on keeping him there until James died.  Emily arrived and overheard part of that statement, and she wanted to know if Paul was talking about the \"not so dearly departed\" James Stenbeck.  Paul did not answer, but instead he asked Emily if she had regained her senses and was going to return the money he had loaned her for her newspaper.\n\n\nBarbara butted in with her two cents, but Emily said that she had hired a lawyer to make sure that she could keep the money.  Paul complained, but Emily told Barbara that her argument was much better since Barbara had tried to have Paul committed.  Paul had to prove that he was in control of his mental faculties in order to revoke the power of attorney that his mother held.  Emily thanked Barbara for making her job easier and offered her flowers.  Emily handed the legal papers to Paul and walked out.  Paul grinned, and walked out after her, leaving his mother fuming.\n\n\nEmily went to the Worldwide offices and found Dusty and Bonnie wrangling.  Bonnie walked out when Dusty began talking to Emily, who told her old boss that Lucinda had fired her from the Intruder staff.  Dusty offered to make that right for Emily, but she said that was not necessary.  She said that she actually had a business proposition for Dusty.  She told him that Paul was bankrolling a newspaper venture for her, and what she needed was office space, staff, and printing equipment.  Dusty grinned that Lucinda would go through the roof, but Emily said the two of them were a match made in Heaven.\n\n\nPaul walked in just as Emily was saying that it would be fun to be in business with Dusty again.  He demanded to talk with Emily , so they went into her old office.  Paul ordered Emily to return his money, and they shouted at each other.  Suddenly Paul leaned in close and kissed Emily until she pushed him away and smacked his face.  Paul said he really needed the money, and they had more conversation, until Emily kissed him.  They ripped off their clothes and began to make love on Emily's desk.\n\n\nAudrey arrived at Fairwinds and met a none-too-cordial Barbara, who was sitting on the couch.  Audrey introduced herself, and Barbara recognized the Coleman name.  Audrey said that she was looking for a Barbara Ryan, but she could not believe that Barbara was so young looking.  Audrey claimed to be a mystery writer, and she wanted to talk about James Stenbeck.  Barbara warned her away with a couple of horror stories, but Audrey was persistent.  Barbara refused to talk about James any longer, and she told Audrey to leave.\n\n\nAudrey was strolling through Old Town when she bumped into \"Jay Stanhope.\"  He demanded his money immediately, and he threatened to make her life very difficult if she did not pay up.  Audrey begged for more time, but \"Jay\" had a tight grip on her arm.  Suddenly Barbara dashed up and pretended that she and Audrey were late for a restaurant lunch.  Audrey said that the man had only needed directions, so she gave him some phony ones.  Barbara grabbed Audrey and said that she was finally ready to have the little conversation Audrey had wanted.\n\n\nBarbara and Audrey went to Al's, and Barbara said that she knew that Audrey owed \"that guy\" money, and that Audrey had obviously heard about the Stenbeck fortune.  Audrey claimed that she was not a gold digger; she only wanted was rightfully hers.  When Barbara looked surprised, Audrey said that she had been intimate with James many years ago, and Barbara interrupted by asking if James had forgotten to pay her hourly rate.  Audrey was miffed, and she wondered aloud if Barbara's son, Paul, might be able to \"spare a little something\" for one of his father's \"old friends.\"\n\n\n\n\nBarbara tried to threaten Audrey, but Audrey hinted that she might drop by Fairwinds to speak with Paul.  At that point, Barbara asked how much money Audrey wanted, and when Audrey answered \"$50,000,\" Barbara took out her checkbook.  Barbara's condition was that if she paid Audrey, the woman had to agree to leave town immediately.  Audrey smiled sweetly, as Barbara searched her purse for a pen.  She couldn't locate one, so she got up to borrow one from the waitress.  While Barbara was gone, Audrey slipped Barbara's keys out of her purse and into her own.\n\n\nAs Barbara began to write the check, Audrey began questioning why a woman would give a total stranger a great deal of money.  She was suspicious of Barbara's motives, and she finally stood up and said, \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" and she walked out.  She went immediately to Fairwinds and used Barbara's keys to gain entry.  She prowled around until she found the stairway down to the cellar.  She walked into the wine cellar, and James kicked the door shut.  Audrey called him \"Jay,\" and he said, \"Hello, Audrey.\"\n\n\n\n\nBonnie was in the Lakeview Lounge when Dusty called her.  She did not know that Dusty was actually in the lounge also until he walked up behind her.  He thanked her properly for defending him so well in court.  He said that he liked and respected Bonnie, so that was why he was always trying to protect her from him.  Bonnie said that she didn't need protection, and she took him by the hand and let him to his room.  They began to undress and then made love.\n\n\nBonnie surprised Dusty, however, by leaving his bed soon after they had finished.  She got dressed and said that she had to prepare for a case.  She also remarked that they could go back to being friends since they had gotten the sex out of their systems.  Dusty was confused, so he did nothing as Bonnie walked from the room.  She returned almost immediately and began pelting him with pillows and swearing at him for not stopping her.  They began kissing again.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna talked about how they could help Audrey if she really thought that James was alive and if Ray Zuma was after her for money.  Vienna suggested that they give Henry's mother the $50,000, but Henry asked where they would get it.  Vienna said they had a great deal of it, thanks to \"Geneva Swift.\"  Henry groaned and said that he had been saving the money that Kim had paid him for his appearances as Geneva and had wanted to spend it on a nest egg.  Vienna considered that money ill gotten, however, so Henry agreed to use his television spoils and to borrow the rest.\n\n\nJames told Audrey that he was sorry that he had made her believe that he was dead.  Audrey sat on James' lap and flirted with him, and they reminisced about meeting in New Orleans.  James said that she had written to him about their son, Henry, and Audrey said that Henry did not believe what Audrey had told him.  She continued to schmooze James, who grabbed her hard by the arm, so she quickly asked if he wanted her to take him to meet their son, and James smiled in agreement.\n\n\nEmily and Paul had slipped off her desk and were lying in front of it, on the floor.  They resumed their money argument, and Emily offered to make Paul co-owner of the newspaper, as long as she could keep creative control.  They began kissing again as Barbara blustered in and loudly asked them if they had no restraint at all.  Barbara told Paul to zip up his fly and accompany her on an important errand that Emily was not involved with.  Paul went out in the vestibule, and Barbara told him that someone was on to them and was looking for James.\n\n\nThey went to Fairwinds and dashed down to the cellar.  James was gone, so they went back upstairs, and Paul asked who could possibly have known where his father was.  Barbara said that Audrey Coleman, Henry's mother, had figured it out.  They talked about how Audrey might have gotten into the house, and Barbara checked her purse and realized that Audrey had stolen her keys.  Paul said Audrey had obviously snuck in and wheeled James out.\n\n\nEmily walked in just in time to hear Paul's last statement, and she asked if James was truly alive. Barbara glared at Paul, who told Emily that James was, indeed, still among the living.  Barbara reasoned that Audrey would need some physical help with a man in a wheelchair, and that probably meant Henry.  Barbara did not want Emily with them, but Paul invited her, and the three of them took off.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna went to Audrey's room but could not find her.  Henry worked his magic on the door, and they went in to wait for her.  Vienna said that she was very proud of Henry for helping his mother, while Henry snooped.  He found a letter to Audrey from Memorial Hospital that confirmed, through DNA testing, that James Stenbeck was the father of Henry Coleman.  Henry could not face it, but he voiced his one consolation: \"At least James Stenbeck is dead.\"\n\n\n\n\nThey went back to their own room, and Henry opened the door.  They both shrieked when they were faced with Audrey, sitting on James Stenbeck's lap, in a wheelchair.  Audrey, with more than a hint of sarcasm, asked Henry if he finally believed her.  Henry clenched his eyes shut and willed his mind to wake up from a horrible dream.  When he opened his eyes, the image was still there, and James said, \"Hello, son.\"  Henry screamed, \"I'm in hell!\" and James suggested that they not hold any more grudges.\n\n\nSuddenly the door flew open again, and Paul, Emily and Barbara burst in.  They saw the same scene of Audrey and James, plus a shell-shocked Henry and Vienna.  Emily was stunned to see James alive, as James addressed Paul and told him to say hello to his brother.  Barbara yelled at Audrey, \"You had a child with him?\" as James smiled and said, \"Don't you just love family reunions?\"\n\n\n",
