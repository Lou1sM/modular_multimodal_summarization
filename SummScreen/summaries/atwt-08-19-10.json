    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Paul's wine cellar, Paul and Henry wanted to take Emily and Barbara to the hospital, but the women insisted upon catching Iris first. Emily and Paul left, and Henry prattled on about how relieved he was to have Barbara back. He swore he'd never leave her again. \"Henry Coleman, I never want to see you again for the rest of my life,\" Barbara replied and stormed out.\n\n\n       Upstairs, Will filled Gwen in on events, and she blamed herself for trusting Iris. When Emily charged in, she was ready to drag Iris by her hair to the police station; however, Gwen announced that Iris had fled. A raging Emily chastised Gwen for believing that Iris had changed.\n\n\n       Barbara and Henry arrived upstairs. Paul said an ambulance was on the way, but Emily and Barbara refused medical attention. Barbara told Henry to stay away from her, but Will said Henry had been the reason they'd found her and Emily. Henry asserted that he'd spent every waking moment looking for Barbara. \"After you married Vienna,\" Barbara added.\n\n\nPaul defended Henry, who'd needed to be plastered at his own wedding. Unimpressed, Barbara hissed that everyone had enabled Iris, the lush. Barbara admonished Emily for being unforgiving in the cellar when Barbara had tried to make amends. Barbara exclaimed that she wouldn't befriend Emily even if they were the last people on earth. Emily said the feeling was mutual. Gwen ordered the quarreling women to be grateful that they'd survived a horrible incident, and she told Will that she had to find Iris.\n\n\nOutside on a shop-lined curb, a raging Iris pounded on the doors of Barbara's closed banking institution. Realizing that she couldn't get any money, Iris went to the Lakeview to raid Barbara's jewelry. She sprayed herself with Barbara's perfume and exited with a rolling suitcase.\n\n\nIn the lobby, Iris decided to have one last drink at the bar. She toasted to \"underhanded, underappreciated me.\" Turning to leave, she heard Gwen say, \"Hi, mom.\"\n\n\n       Confronted by her daughter, Iris made excuses for her drinking, but Gwen called her a lying sociopath, who'd kidnapped Emily and Barbara. \"Is that what they said to you?\" Iris innocently asked. Gwen said she was glad that Hallie would never know what a psycho Iris really was. Iris stated that she'd given Gwen life, and Gwen owed her. Gwen ordered Iris out of her life. Iris said that if Gwen turned around, she'd never have to see her mother again.\n\n\nGwen suddenly pretended to be sympathetic, and Iris inadvertently admitted to the kidnappings. Will rounded the corner with a police offer, and Gwen asked if they'd recorded everything. The police handcuffed Iris, who told Gwen to consider herself an orphan.\n\n\nIn Katie's bed, Chris and Katie kissed after making love for the first time. She slipped out of the room to call Alison to check on Jacob. Chris popped some pills and hissed through a pain. Katie returned and asked what was wrong. He claimed that his doctor had put him on a daily aspirin regimen. Katie guessed that the regimen was for his heart. He claimed that his heart was fine, but she asked if he'd told the doctor that he'd passed out.\n\n\nJust then, Kim called Chris to say that Henry had found Barbara. Since Kim and Bob had gone to Chicago that night, Kim requested that Chris go to Memorial to check Barbara out. Katie scrambled to get dressed and exclaimed that Henry must be over the moon with happiness.\n\n\n       At the hospital later, Barbara told Henry that he wasn't welcome in her exam room. Henry believed that destiny had caused him to hear her calling to him on Jacob's monitor, but Barbara quipped that she'd believe it if Henry had actually located her. \"The monitor doesn't come with a GPS, Barbara,\" he reasoned. She warned that he'd get hurt if he didn't leave. When he invited her to hit him, she threw a pillow at him.\n\n\nThe pillow hit the door as Chris entered, and he deduced that his feisty patient was feeling better. Barbara told Chris to find a real patient, but Chris feared that he'd be disowned if he didn't follow through with his mother's orders. After Chris examined her, he declared that she was fine, but he'd run some tests just to be sure.\n\n\nChris left, and Henry vowed to work things out with Barbara. He asked what the point of being stubborn was. She admitted that she'd thought a lot about him while she'd been locked away. She'd concluded that if Henry had really loved her, he wouldn't have given into Vienna. He replied that wasn't so simple. Barbara decided that she was meant to be alone. She knew Henry wanted her to move on, but it wasn't easy to put everything behind her.\n\n\nBarbara asked Henry to leave, but he wouldn't go until she heard him out. Henry retold the story of his joy and anguish during Vienna's first pregnancy and miscarriage. When he'd learned of the second pregnancy, he'd been determined to be there for Vienna and the baby. Henry stated that Barbara would walk through fire for own children, so she should understand that he'd feel the same way about his unborn child.\n\n\nHenry conveyed his misery and anger upon discovering Vienna's lie. While in pain, he'd also felt relief, because the lie had freed him to make things right with Barbara. Though it might be too late to salvage the relationship, he needed her to hear that he loved only her. He believed that she already knew it, and his love had helped her survive her ordeal.\n\n\nA tearful Barbara recalled that she'd been a muddle of confused emotions, and she'd only had a stupid clown to talk to. She confided that the clown had assumed Henry's voice, and it had been a friend to her. She felt silly, but Henry claimed that the clown had led him to her.\n\n\nHenry declared that he and Barbara were meant to be together, and Iris and Vienna couldn't stop them. Barbara said that those women hadn't kept them apart; they'd kept themselves apart. She claimed that even without Iris and Vienna, Barbara and Henry were still as unreliable as before. Barbara decided that she was going home-alone.\n\n\nChris examined Emily, and in the corridor, he told Katie that Barbara wasn't happy with Henry. When Katie found Henry, he said he deserved Barbara's wrath, because he hadn't been man enough to stand up for her. Barbara was the one for him, but he'd lost his chance with her.\n\n\nKatie left, and Chris entered to encourage Henry to hang in there, because patience paid off. Henry noted that Chris had the same goofy look on his face as Henry had seen on Katie's face earlier. Chris said there was hope for everyone, \"even when you think there isn't.\"\n\n\nA paint-blotched Barbara returned to the Lakeview to find that her room had been trashed. She grabbed her perfume bottle and noted that it was empty. \"Just like my life,\" she uttered. After she straightened up and showered, she sighed to find Katie on her doorstep.\n\n\nKatie, a former hostage victim, commiserated with Barbara and assumed that shock had caused her to reject Henry. Barbara accused Katie of aiding Vienna, and Katie owned up to it. Katie figured that if she hadn't hung onto the past, Henry could have protected Barbara from Iris. Katie insisted that Henry was madly in love with Barbara, and he'd even donned a dress to solve her disappearance. \"It was just a typical day in his life,\" Barbara half-heartedly quipped. Katie insisted that Henry had been the only one who hadn't given up or done anything wrong in the entire situation. \"Welcome back, Barbara. You were missed,\" Katie said and walked out.\n\n\nLater, Henry went to his hotel suite and saw Chuckles. Realizing that Barbara and the clown had grown close, Henry asked if Chuckles had some tips to win her back. Just then, the fabulously dressed Barbara arrived on his doorstep, and the captivated Henry wondered if her presence meant that she'd forgiven him. She said that she was working on it. \"Work on it as my wife. Will you marry me, Barbara?\" Henry asked.\n\n\nAt Barbara's silence, Henry assured her that he was serious. \"Then you'd better get on one knee and start over,\" she suggested. Immediately dropping to one knee, he asked again. She told him that there would be no children, but he said everything he wanted was standing before him. He implored her to marry him, and when she agreed, he swept her up and kissed her.\n\n\nLater, Chris returned to Katie's house. He started to let himself in with the spare key, but an excruciating pain sent him reeling. He downed some pills and took himself back to the hospital. In an office, he called Reid and said they needed to increase Chris's dosage.\n\n\nKatie went home, and as she searched her place for Chris, she remarked that the message he'd left her had made her blush. To her disappointment, Chris wasn't there.\n\n\n       At Fairwinds, Paul searched the house for his wife and found her scrubbing a stain on the cellar floor. She said that she'd only wanted to have a family with Paul and Eliza; however, karma had caught up to her for putting Jennifer, Will, and Gwen \"through hell.\" Emily revealed that she'd shunned Barbara's attempts to make peace, too. Sobbing, Emily wondered what kind of person would be unforgiving in the face of death.\n\n\nWhen Paul helped Emily to the study, they saw Will and Gwen enter. Revealing that Iris was in custody, Gwen said that she should have listened to Emily. Emily apologized for snapping at Gwen, who'd also been a victim. Emily regretted what she and Paul had done to Gwen years earlier, but Gwen said that it was in the past. Paul remarked that they sounded like a family. He called for a toast, but Emily preferred not to get their drinks from the wine cellar. \n\n\n",
