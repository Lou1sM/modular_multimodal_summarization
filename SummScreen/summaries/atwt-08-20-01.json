Damian tells her that this is the safest way for them to speak.  He tells her that Luke and Holden were safe as long as they were in the dungeon, but now his evil stepbrother has them and he can't say if they are being taken care of.  Damian thinks he hears someone coming.  He tells Lily that it is too dangerous for them to speak.  He tells her that they will have to meet tomorrow night.  Lily tells him that she is being held on suspicion of murder.  Damian tells her that the both of them will be released.  He tells her not to ask how he knows, he just knows.  She tells him that they can meet.  She tells him about a caf\u00e9 that they can meet at.  He asks her how she knows this caf\u00e9 and she tells him that she has been there before.  He tells her that he has to be careful.  He adds that he can't trust anyone.  She asks what about her.  Does he trust her.  He tells her that they had shared a bed and she gave birth to his only son.  He reassures her that he can trust her.  Lily looks guilty.  Damian hears another noise and this time someone is coming.

Jennifer walks out and Bryant stays.  Paul tells Rose that he doesn't feel like celebrating since there is nothing to celebrate and asks if she minds if they have dinner another time.  Rose is disappointed, but she tells him that she understands.  Paul starts to leave and Craig stops him and asks for an apology.

Jack starts to look around and the policeman that is with him reminds him that they were supposed to wait for the bomb squad.  Jack tells him to mind his own business.  Jack finds Carly's cell phone and sees that she had dialed in 911.  He says that she was trying to call for help.  Jack looks around some more and finds the picture that Julia left of Carly's Prize (the land that Jack had bought her that Julia took in the divorce).  Jack tells the officer to call for back up and he will radio the directions from the car.  The officer doesn't follow.  Jack yells as he runs out the door, \"I know where Julia has taken Carly.\"\n\n\nJulia has Carly as gunpoint at the barren land that Jack had bought for her.  Julia asks if Carly knows where she is and Carly replies, \"Carly's Prize.\"  Julia tells her that she is correct and now that the land has been stripped, there are a lot of sink holes around.  She points to a big mud hole in front of Carly.  Julia tells Carly to get into the quicksand.  Carly says that she will have to shoot her because she is not going to make this look like a suicide.  Julia warns Carly not to push her.  Carly starts to taunt Julia and tells her that she is tired of her sniveling and whining around.  Julia gets upset with Carly and Carly lunges at Julia.  Julia pulls the trigger on the gun and a bullet grazes Carly's head.  Carly falls down and Julia trips.  She drops the gun and Julia falls into the mud.  Julia tries not to move and she starts to call to Carly.  Carly stirs a little and opens her eyes.  She sees Julia shoulder deep in the mud.  Julia asks Carly to help her.  Carly says that if she just stayed unconscious a few minutes longer she would not have this dilemma.  Carly asks where is the gun.  Julia tells her that she dropped it.  Carly asks where the keys to the car is.  Julia tells her that they are in her pocket.  Carly says, \"Damn!\"  Carly finds a big stick and goes over to the edge of the mud hole.  She tells Julia that she had better not make her sorry for helping her.  She puts the stick into the mud and helps Julia out.  After she is out, Julia gets all whiny and tells Carly that she is hopeless.  Carly tells her that no one is hopeless.  She tells Julia to look at her and what she has done to better herself.  Julia asks if Carly would help her get better.  Carly reluctantly says that she will help her.  Julia asks if Jack will help too.  Once again, Carly reluctantly says that he will.  Julia pushes Carly over and runs for the gun.  She points the gun at Carly and tells her to get into the quicksand.  Carly is stunned.  She tells Julia that she just saved her life.  Julia gives Carly a kick and Carly falls into the hole.  Carly can't believe how crazy Julia is.  Jack comes running up and Julia turns the gun on him.  Jack starts to talk to her about giving him the gun.  Julia yells at him that he only loves Carly.  Jack tells Julia that he still loves her.  He takes a diamond ring out of his pocket and shows it to Julia.  Julia sees it and says that it is her ring.  Jack tells her that he has it with him all the time.  Jack says that he still loves her.  Julia starts to soften.  She says that she always knew that Jack would come back to her.  She holds out her muddy hand and Jack puts the ring on her finger.  He leans in and gives Julia a kiss.  Carly is in the mud sinking lower and lower.  Jack tells Julia that she doesn't need the gun anymore and takes the gun from her hand.  As soon as he has the gun, he pushes Julia to the ground and tells the police hiding in the bushes to grab Julia.  Jack turns and starts to pull Carly out of the mud.  Julia shrieks at Jack that she knew he was there for his slut.  Julia keeps yelling as the police drag her away.  Jack gets Carly out of the mud and holds her close to him.  He asks if she is OK.  Carly doesn't say anything.  Jack asks her please to say something so he knows she is OK.  Carly says, \"Jack?\"  Jack thanks God that she is all right.  An officer brings Carly a blanket and Jack helps her wrap up.  He tells her that an officer will take her home.  He asks if she will be OK.  She says that she will and if she needs someone, she will call Molly.  As Jack starts to walk away, Carly asks him if what he told Julia was the truth.  Was he still in love with Julia?  Jack tells her that everything he did tonight was because he loves her (Carly).  Carly smiles as Jack walks away.\n\n\nHal goes to the hospital to see Barbara.  Barbara asks him to please go away.  He walks into her room and closes the door.  Hal tells Barbara that something happened in the trial and he wanted to talk to her before she heard it from the media.  He tells her about the mental patient that gave a full confession in court.  Barbara starts to cry.  She tells Hal that she has gone through so much humiliation and has lost her family and now everyone is going to think she is a liar.  Paul walks in and sees his mother crying.  He looks at Hal and asks if he had told her about the trial.  Hal shakes his head yes.  Paul tells his mother that he needs to talk to Hal and asks if she will be Ok.  Barbara shakes her head yes.  As Paul and Hal leave, tears stream down Barbara's face.  Out in the hall, Paul tells Hal that he is afraid that the DA will turn on Barbara and get her for perjury.  Hal tells him that he won't let that happen.  He adds that he will talk to Jessica and see what she is planning and if she is planning to bring charges, he will rattle her cage a little.  Hal starts to walk away and turns back to Paul.  He says that he could have stayed out of this mess and let Craig go down for a crime he didn't do.  Paul asks why he didn't do that.  Hal looks at him and says, \"Because I'm not him.\"  Hal walks away and Paul goes back into his mother's room.  Barbara is still crying and she begs Paul to get her out of the hospital.  She says that she knows that the media will be snooping around and trying to get a look at her.  She says that she can hire nurses and doctors to come and be with her wherever he takes her.  Paul hugs his sobbing mother.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, court is back in session and the judge dismisses all charges.  After the judge leaves the room, Craig and Cass stand up and shake hands.  Cass says, \"We did it.\"  Craig asks, \"Was there any doubt?\"  Cass and Jessica shake hands and walk out.  Sierra walks up to Craig and asks if he would like to go celebrate.  Craig says that maybe some other time, he just wants to reflect.  Sierra questions, \"You, reflect?\"  He says that if she tells anyone he will deny it.  Sierra says that she thinks this trial has changed him, but she is not sure yet if it will be for the better.  She walks out and leaves him alone.  He walks over and looks at the picture of he and Carly kissing.  He sits down on the table with his head down.\n\n\n",
