She told him he'd better change his business practices, or else it could cost Rosanna and Craig their family. Dusty asked how, and Rosanna explained that they were going to adopt a baby. She told him to stay legitimate or else she would ruin his life. Dusty asked if Paul had put her up to it, but she told him that Paul had nothing to do with it.\n\n\nPaul told Jennifer what had happened with Will. Rose walked over and asked if Paul and Jennifer would help out with her bachelor auction. Paul asked how he could help and suggested perhaps he could be a bachelor that Rose could bid on and make Dusty jealous. Jennifer left, and Rose told Paul that she just wanted to be friends. Paul said, \"You have a new friend now.\" \n\n\nPaul told Rose that he couldn't wait until Dusty screwed up then Paul would know that he had been right all along; he added that he could then throw Rose out into the streets. Rose couldn't believe how much different \"this Paul\" was from the \"old Paul.\" The new Paul said that his fianc\u00e9e and best friend had killed the old Paul. Left alone, Paul started to cry, and James \"appeared\" to him. James told him that he needed to prove that Dusty was worthless. James said, \"Punish those that deserve it.\" \n\n\nJennifer went over to Java to see Dusty, and she made sure to tell him that Rose had gone to see Paul. Dusty found that unsettling and told Jennifer that he thought Rosanna and Paul were teaming up against him. Jennifer tried to reassure Dusty and hugged him, just as Rose walked in.

    "tvmega_recap": "Rosanna saw Dusty bribing the building inspector, and warned him that any shady dealings of his could jeopardize her chances of adopting a child with Craig. Dusty wondered if Paul put her up to the warning, but she insisted that wasn't the case. He promised to keep his business dealings clean. Meanwhile, Rose visited Paul and Jen, asking them to participate in her charity bachelor auction. Jen agreed, but Paul said no way. Paul wondered if Rose was using him to make Dusty jealous, and said that Dusty would eventually screw up. When he did, Rose would come running back to Paul, but he would turn her away. She left in disgust at this changed Paul, and he broke down. Suddenly, the \"James\" in his head appeared, and told him that it would be easy to get revenge on Dusty. Rosanna interrupted this \"conversation\" with a warning to watch out for Craig and Dusty. Jen told Dusty about Rose's visit, and flirted with him as she dropped hints that Rose may not be over Paul. Rose walked in just as Jen threw her arms around him. As Rick told Susan that Alison and Chris had stolen the key to his safety deposit box, the young duo made plans to get into the box. Chris pointed out that they could only do it if they could show that Rick was dead; Alison said they could arrange that. Rick confronted Alison, and offered her $1000 for the key. When Alison told Susan, Susan asked why Alison was trying to make trouble. Chris got a fake death certificate from the morgue, and they went to Tom's office to use his notary stamp, but Tom caught them. Bob continued to have problems, and went into arrest.",
