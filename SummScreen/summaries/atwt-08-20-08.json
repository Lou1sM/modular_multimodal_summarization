When Lily arrived, she found her mother choosing two sexy dresses for herself. Lily suggested that Lucinda's updated image was perhaps due to a newfound interest in Luke's foundation director, Brian Wheatley. Lucinda denied this, but also asked Lily to arrange a dinner party that evening for Luke, Noah, Mr. Wheatley, and herself. Lily agreed and issued the invitations. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Noah and Luke met with Brian Wheatley to discuss plans for the foundation. Wheatley suggested that the foundation partner with theme parks to provide fun for underprivileged children. He was obviously aware of the close relationship between the two young men. \n\n\nAgainst all parental edicts, a miserable Parker snitched Carly's phone and called Katie's phone. Liberty answered and told him that she was going to Al's for lunch with Katie and Brad. She told Katie that it was Parker on the phone and was surprised that Katie wanted Parker to know exactly where the girl would be. After the teens hung up, Parker convinced J.J. with a $20 bribe to provide him with an alibi to leave the house. J.J. reluctantly agreed, and they told Carly they were headed to the movies. \n\n\nUnknown to Liberty, Brad and Katie had enlisted the aid of Leo, one of the WOAK interns, to deliver a package to them at the diner and then appear interested in Liberty. Katie's theory was that if Parker saw Liberty with another boy, he would be discouraged enough to leave her alone. Katie and Liberty went to the diner to meet Brad, and soon Leo arrived with his delivery. Brad graciously invited the boy to join them for lunch, and he sat next to Liberty. Parker hid outside the diner and peeked through the window. He was obviously upset to see his girl with another guy, and Janet spotted him lurking outside. She took pity on him and went out to tell him that Leo was not a \"date\" but just someone delivering a package to Brad. She encouraged him to go home before he got caught and had more problems. \n\n\nCarly went to Parker's room looking for some school papers and surprised J.J., who was sneaking back into the room through the window. She questioned him, and J.J. spilled the beans about being a paid conspirator. Carly immediately called Jack, who figured out that Parker was probably at the diner where Liberty was. He showed up at Carly's, however, since Janet told him she had sent Parker home. Unfortunately, Parker did not come home. \n\n\nLily's dinner party got underway with Lucinda in one of her new dresses. Brian Wheatley learned that Lily was recently separated and shared that he had gone through a similar situation not long before. He signed the contract with the foundation with a flourish. Noah had to leave, so Luke gave him a goodbye kiss, which Wheatley noticed. When Luke and Wheatley stepped out on the terrace, the new director cautioned Luke that the philanthropic community was not as tolerant of certain behavior as others. Luke was stunned at this homophobic comment, which amounted to asking him to go back into the closet about his relationship with Noah. \n\n\nAfter Wheatley continued his discussion about the fact that there were children involved with the foundation's work, Luke was furious that he and Noah were being considered pedophiles. After Wheatley left, Luke informed his mother and grandmother what had taken place. Lily and Lucinda were upset, but they felt that Wheatley was not homophobic himself or he would not have taken the job with the foundation in the first place. Lucinda left soon afterwards and found Wheatley in the bar at the Lakeview. She told him he had offended her grandson and asked him to explain himself. He assured her that he did not feel that way himself; he was only trying to warn Luke. Lucinda assumed a cool manner, and left. \n\n\nAt the diner, Liberty and Leo went by themselves to the bookstore just a few doors away. Janet realized that Brad and Katie had set up the whole scenario with Leo, and she was horrified. She called Jack again, and he came to the diner. The adults had a lively discussion about the way they had handled the situation, and Brad and Katie left to bring Liberty back to the diner to say goodnight to her mother. When they could not find the teens, Janet was upset that Liberty might be in trouble. \n\n\nLiberty and Leo, followed by a skulking Parker, went to the gazebo in the park. Leo began making moves on Liberty, which she did not welcome. She explained that she still felt connected to the boy she'd had sex with recently. Leo took that as an invitation for more advances, and Liberty jumped up and ran, but Leo caught her. Parker materialized and punched Leo in the face and knocked him down. Leo ran off and Liberty hugged Parker. She called her mother, and soon all her family was there. Liberty explained that Parker had saved her, and Brad apologized to Parker and thanked him. Liberty accused Katie of not listening to her. \n\n\nCarly and Jack took Parker home and Jack's talk with his son was interrupted by visitors. Janet and Liberty asked to speak to them, and Janet suggested they all relax and let the teens at least see each other and be friends, subject to some rules. Everyone agreed that the teens could spend time together as long as an adult was present. Liberty thanked Parker again for fighting off Leo and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Janet and Carly shared a surprise bonding moment in the kitchen when they hugged. Jack announced there must be a full moon that night. \n\n\nLuke went back to the farm after his disturbing conversation with Brian Wheatley and told Noah all about it. Noah reassured his boyfriend that it made no difference to him, and they kissed. \n\n\n",

Brian, Luke and Noah talk ideas for his foundation when Brian sees Luke and Noah acting affectionate. Katie and Brad leave Liberty in the dark about their setting her up with Leo, the WOAK intern. Parker takes Carly's cell phone and calls Liberty and she tells Katie, who thinks this will work out perfectly if Parker follows Liberty on her \u0091date'. Parker bribes JJ to help him get out of the house. Leo arrives as Katie, Brad and Liberty have lunch and pretend it is by accident; they ask him join them.

Liberty is thankful he saved her and calls her mom to tell her what happened. Everyone heads over as Liberty explains how Parker saved her. Brad thanks Parker, as Liberty is upset with her dad and Katie for setting this in motion. Brian warns Luke about the philanthropic world being very conservative; he might want to not advertise he is gay. Luke thinks it isn't right to have to hide being gay and is annoyed at Brian's suggestion. After Brian leaves, Luke tells Lucinda and Lily that he isn't sure Brian is right for the job. Surprised by his about face, Luke admits what Brian said to him. Lucinda and Lily don't believe Brian is homophobic, but he was simply trying to warn Luke of what he is up against; they ask him to give Brian another chance. Liberty would like to thank Parker for what he did, so Janet takes her to his house and pleads Liberty and Parker's case to Carly and Jack. Lucinda orders Brian to make things right with Luke after his comments, as he agrees to do that. Luke tells Noah about Brian's suggestion and Noah understands. Carly and Jack finally relent and agree to let Parker and Liberty hang out again. Carly and Janet hug when Carly thanks her for looking after Parker, as Jack sees this.",
