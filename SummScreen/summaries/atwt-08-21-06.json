A distressed Emily stumbles in as her first patient. Emily refuses to let Meg treat her, until Meg tells her the baby is at risk. Em has a complete hissy fit until Meg calls Paul for her. Paul shows up and Meg explains how Em's condition is set off by stress. Paul lectures Emily, but then assures her she can do right by their baby. Emily whines that she needs to be able to count on him, like when he helped her with the newspaper. Meg listens in. Afterwards, she's mad Paul didn't tell her about doing Em's books.\n\n\nAt Lisa's restaurant, Jade dines with a disgruntled Will. Paul walks up and Will introduces Jade. Paul asks where Gwen is. Jade excuses herself and goes to talk to Luke and Holden, who are at a nearby table with the baby. Holden lets her hold the little guy. Jade says she prays for Lily every day. Later Luke is at Lily's bedside pleading that he'll be a better son. Emma comes in and tells him that he's a good son and Lily knows it. They both believe Lily will wake up.  Holden comes in, and Emma encourages him to name the baby now, rather than wait for Lily. Back at dinner, Paul assures Will that Gwen may tell him it's over for them, but just be very mad. He also says eating out with \"drop dead gorgeous\" girls in public probably isn't wise. Paul admits he misses Jennifer and his own life is a complete mess. After dinner, Jade gushes about dessert and tries to entice Will to have sex. Amazingly, he's smart enough to stick to his guns and go home. \n\n\nMargo and Dallas continue to interrogate Maddie in the hotel room with her family members present. As they press her for the rapist's identity, Maddie mumbles that she can't remember--the details are fuzzy and maybe it didn't even happen. Louis says the police need to back off. Eve and Henry are concerned for Maddie. Margo says she's in a lot of trouble, but understands Maddie is confused and scared. She'd like to talk to Maddie alone. Maddie wants this; Louis of course does not. Henry talks to Margo and Dallas, who think Maddie's \"forgetting\" is protecting someone she knows. Meanwhile, Louis is alone with Maddie, threatening her to keep things \"private,\" or Eve and Henry will get hurt. Henry walks in at the end of their conversation. He has a few sarcastic words with Louis and is suspicious. Henry promises Maddie nothing bad will happen if she tells Margo the truth. Maddie tells Margo the frat party story was a lie. Margo asks her the rapist's identity. As Margo talks, Maddie has flashbacks of Louis' attack, and she clams up. Maddie pleads for it to be over. Margo says it can't be until she tells someone the truth. Eve says that there is something really wrong with Maddie to lie about being raped. Louis says this is \"a cry for help.\" Later, Eve tries to talk to Maddie, who starts crying. Louis blathers on to Henry about how Maddie will be making up more stories. Henry flashes to Oakdale PD talking about Maddie knowing her rapist, back to the look of disgust on Maddie's face when Louis tried to hug her, to his rage with Henry. He tells Louis that he is \"looking at the piece of dirt who raped my sister!\" Upstairs, Maddie, with tear-stained cheeks, picks up her backpack and leaves.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Maddie insists she lied about the whole thing, but Henry begins to get suspicious, and Louis's reaction to the thought of Maddie being questioned leads him to suspect his brother-in-law. Bob reinstates Meg at the hospital, where Emily is her first patient. Will takes Jade out for a fancy dinner, but the two are interrupted by Paul, and Jade takes the opportunity to speak with Luke and Holden and to hold the baby. Paul gets a call from Meg to come to the hospital, where he berates Emily for putting her petty grievances with Meg above the life of their child. Emma tells Holden that it's time to name the baby. Margo talks with Maddie alone and comes close to getting to the truth until Maddie comes back, and she and Dallas wonder what the best route to follow is. Margo tells Dallas that it's possible the murders and the rape are not connected. Henry puts two and two together and confronts Louis about raping Maddie.\r\nSource: tv.com",
    "tvmega_recap": "Meg gets her job back at the hospital and her first patient is Emily \u0096 having another mild bout with preeclampsia. Emily goads Meg by demanding having Paul by her side during this. Will and Jade head out on the town and bump into Paul. Paul learns of Will and Gwen's break up and offers Will some unsolicited advice, which falls on deaf ears, or so it seems until the end of the evening when Will explains to Jade why they can no longer see each other. Jade sees Luke with Holden and the new baby, and even ends up holding him. Luke talks to his comatose mother. Maddie claims to have lied about the rape. Margo and Dallas are confused as to whether Maddie is lying about the whole rape or simply about who raped her. Henry is told women sometimes lie about some of the facts of a rape in order to protect someone close to them. Margo speaks with Maddie alone but not before Lewis threatens he, Eve and Henry again. Lewis tells Eve that Maddie has had deep-rooted mental issues for a long time and cannot be believed, which she has ignored for a long time now. Eve pleads with Maddie to open up, but she tells her she just wants to be left alone. Lewis tells the same thing to Henry later but Henry is not biting and stuns him when he declares he is \"looking at the piece of dirt who raped his sister!\"",
