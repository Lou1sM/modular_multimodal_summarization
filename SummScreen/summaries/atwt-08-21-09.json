    "soap_central": "\n\n \nRosanna received a phone call from the rehabilitation facility where Carly was staying. Rosanna was told that Carly was ready to have visitors. Craig, who was at Carly's house, was thrilled to hear the news and told Rosanna that they should leave immediately to visit Carly. Rosanna told Craig to slow down, because Carly could only have one visitor at a time, and Rosanna wanted to be that person. Parker walked into the room and insisted that he should be the one to visit his mother first.\n\n\nParker told Craig and Rosanna that he wanted to let his mother know that he was sorry for having made things worse for her when she was drinking. Craig and Rosanna reassured Parker that it hadn't been his fault, and that both Parker and Carly had been in a situation that they couldn't handle. Craig promised that he would take Parker to visit Carly as soon as he was sure it was okay.\n\n\nParker decided to go for a bike ride, and after he left, Rosanna began to argue with Craig about his relationship with Carly and how much he had enabled Carly's drinking. Craig told Rosanna that since he was paying for Carly's rehab and since he was engaged to be married to Carly, it was his right to be Carly's first visitor. Rosanna countered by saying that Carly would no longer want anything to do with Craig after she had completed the rehab program.\n\n\nCraig told Rosanna he was surprised that she had become so nasty since her return to Oakdale, but Rosanna said she was simply protecting her loved ones. Craig responded by saying that Rosanna's anger and resentment would begin to show on her face if she wasn't careful, and then she'd be \"a lonely, spiteful, sad, old maid.\" He told Rosanna that he was in Carly's life, which meant he was also in Rosanna's life, and Rosanna would just have to get used to it.\n\n\nLiberty and Tony walked through a park, but Liberty tried to stop Tony when he started to kiss her. Liberty asked Tony if all he wanted to do was have sex, and Tony replied that sex had been fine with Liberty the previous day. When Tony took Liberty by the arm and told her they should \"go for a ride,\" she pulled back and said she didn't feel like it. Parker rode up on his bike and saw that Liberty appeared to be trying to get Tony to leave her alone. Parker told Liberty that he thought her mother was looking for her. Liberty went along with Parker's story and told Tony that she had to do something for her mom. Tony left, and Parker asked Liberty if she was okay.\n\n\nLiberty thanked Parker but said he should just worry about his new girlfriend. Parker had no idea what Liberty meant, so she told him that she'd seen him hugging a girl when she had gone by his house the previous day. Parker told Liberty that the girl had been his cousin, Faith, and he had been hugging her because Faith had just found out that her father had died.\n\n\nLiberty told Parker that she felt like a big screwup, especially since she had been fired from a job she'd been doing for free. Parker told Liberty that she shouldn't take her firing personally, but Liberty said it was personal. She told him, \"I sucked. I would have fired me, too.\" Parker assured Liberty that even though things weren't going her way that summer, she was still one of the coolest people he knew.\n\n\nParker then told Liberty that his mother was able to have visitors at the rehab facility, and Liberty asked when Parker was going to visit Carly. Parker explained that Craig had wanted to see Carly first, but Parker would go as soon as possible. Liberty told Parker that his mom would be very proud of him for going back to school and having the modeling job. Parker then told Liberty that if Tony gave her any problems, she could count on Parker to help her. He also told her that she could do way better than Tony. After Parker left, Liberty called Tony and told him she didn't think they should see each other again.\n\n\nWhen Craig arrived at the rehab clinic, the receptionist informed him that Carly had changed her mind and didn't want to see him that day. The nurse apologized and explained that someone was supposed to have called to let Craig know before he made the trip to the clinic.\n\n\nCraig returned to Carly's house, and when Rosanna walked into the living room, he lied and told her his visit with Carly had gone very well. Craig said he hated to disappoint Rosanna, but Carly still loved him, and he wasn't \"a mere side effect of the alcohol, after all.\" He added that Carly's problem was her addiction, not her relationship with him, and then he told Rosanna that he was going to get something to drink because he was thirsty after the long drive. Craig went into the kitchen.\n\n\nThe phone rang, and Rosanna answered it. After a brief conversation, she hung up, and when Craig walked back into the room, she said, \"You jerk. You lied to me.\" She told him the clinic had just called to reassure Craig that it wasn't necessarily a bad thing that Carly had changed her mind about the visit and that Craig shouldn't take it personally. Rosanna couldn't believe Craig had lied to her to cover up the fact that Carly had hurt his feelings and so that he could be right about where his relationship with Carly stood. Craig admitted it and said that he hadn't wanted to see the smug look on Rosanna's face again, and he asked her if she was happy about it.\n\n\nParker went home and saw that Craig was back. He asked Craig how the visit with Carly had gone, and Craig told him that it hadn't actually happened because Carly wasn't ready. Parker worried that meant that his mother wasn't getting better. Craig asked Rosanna to give him a minute alone with Parker, and she left the room, but she stopped in the kitchen to listen to the conversation.\n\n\nCraig told Parker that he thought it was a good sign that Carly had recognized for herself that she wasn't ready to see Craig yet. He said, \"It's either that, or she's completely over me.\" Parker said that wasn't funny, and Craig agreed. Craig pointed out that it was only one day, and he said he could give that up in the hope that he and Carly would have years together. Parker asked if Craig was positive that nothing was wrong, and Craig assured Parker that Carly was simply trying to get well and strong so she could be back with her family, because she loved Parker and always would.\n\n\nParker went upstairs, and Rosanna walked back into the living room. Craig said he thought it was good that Parker hadn't gone to the clinic earlier, and Rosanna agreed that it would have been devastating if Carly had decided at the last minute that she wasn't ready to see Parker. Craig said maybe Carly would have agreed to see Parker instead of him. Rosanna told Craig she knew it had hurt him when Carly hadn't wanted to see him, and she wanted Craig to know that it didn't make her happy. She thanked Craig for being so good with Parker, and he told her she was welcome.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Audrey massaged James's leg and offered to rub anything else James wanted rubbed. As she flirted with him, Audrey told James that Henry would be a better, more loyal son to him than Paul was being. James replied that he wasn't worried about Paul, because Paul lacked the courage of his convictions.\n\n\nBarbara cornered Henry in the Lakeview as he was returning to his room and told him that he should get to know his brother, Paul. Henry saw through Barbara's supposed concern for family ties and told her he knew she was trying to make sure Paul didn't lose his chance to get some of James's remaining money. Henry opened the door to his room and found Vienna at the doorway.\n\n\nVienna asked what Henry and Barbara were talking about, and Henry said that Barbara wanted him to celebrate his new brother. Barbara informed Vienna that she just wanted to make sure that Henry and Paul would share equally in whatever their father might leave behind. Vienna told Barbara that she and Henry didn't want any of James's money or anything to do with James, but Barbara told Vienna that she had gotten a different impression from Henry.\n\n\nAfter Barbara left, Vienna asked Henry if he had led Barbara to believe he was interested in having James's money. Henry admitted that he had decided it couldn't hurt to get to know his rich father and perhaps inherit some of the millions of dollars James had. Because James had told them that he was dying, Henry thought James was harmless. Vienna was worried that was exactly what James wanted them to believe.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul called the police and reported that his father, James Stenbeck, could be found in Henry Coleman's room at the Lakeview Hotel. He then thanked Emily for having given him the idea to call the police. Emily told Paul that was a good argument for keeping her around, and Paul agreed, but said he could come up with a better reason. Emily nipped Paul's idea in the bud, though, and said she had to follow the story for her newspaper.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry arrived in the lobby in time to overhear a couple of policemen asking the desk clerk about James Stenbeck. Henry rushed back upstairs and went to his mother's room. Henry told Audrey and James that the police were downstairs looking for James, and he quickly wheeled James out of the room. Henry took James and Audrey down to the boiler room of the hotel and told them he would get a few things to make them more comfortable.\n\n\nHenry returned to his room and grabbed a pillow, a blanket, and a bottle of champagne. As he was leaving, Vienna walked in and asked what he was doing. Henry told Vienna that he was going to sit by the pool and get a little sun. He told her the blanket was because he didn't like the marks the lounge chairs left on his back, and the pillow was for his neck, while the wine was for \"hydration.\" Vienna asked if Henry was hiding anything from her, but he assured her he wasn't, and then he left.\n\n\nEmily and Paul went to the police station to await James's arrest. Barbara called Paul and told him that Henry was trying to get all of James's money for himself. Paul told his mother that he didn't care, and then he let her know that he had told the police where to find James.\n\n\nBarbara went to the police station to try to talk Paul into leaving so that James wouldn't find out that Paul had been the one to turn him in. Paul said he wanted his father to know who had done it. Emily asked Barbara why she was encouraging her son to grovel to a man who treated him like garbage. Barbara told Emily that Paul needed James's money, because Paul had given the last of his own money to Emily.\n\n\nPaul asked one of the police officers if he knew what was happening with the arrest, and the officer told him that James hadn't been at the hotel when the police had arrived to arrest him. Barbara told Paul that she was sure that meant that Henry and Audrey had hidden James away somewhere, because Henry wanted James's fortune all for himself. Paul told Barbara that Henry could have it all, but that James deserved to be in jail. He then told Barbara that she could help him or she could stay out of his way.\n\n\nBarbara decided to help Paul, so she called Vienna and told her that she thought that Henry and his mother might be trying to hide James from the police, Vienna asked what she should do. Barbara told her to \"stab Henry in the back\" for his own good. Barbara convinced Vienna that even if Henry thought all he had to do was to do a few favors for James, that wasn't the way James operated, and James would change Henry into someone Vienna wouldn't recognize. That scared Vienna, so she agreed to Barbara's plan.\n\n\nVienna called Henry on his cell phone, and when Henry answered, Vienna told him that she knew he was hiding with his father. She told him that she thought he was doing the right thing, and she wanted to help him. When Vienna asked where Henry was, Henry told her, and she in turn told Barbara. Paul and the police arrived, and they went to the boiler room and found Henry, Audrey, and James. When James saw Paul, he realized that Paul had turned him in.\n\n\nHenry asked Vienna why she had betrayed him. She told him that she was trying to save him from James, but Henry said he didn't want to be saved. Vienna told Henry that she was afraid he would become obsessed with James's inheritance the same way he had become obsessed with being Geneva Swift. In that case, Henry had been drunk on fame, and Vienna worried that he would become drunk on his dream of an inheritance. Vienna didn't think their relationship could survive something like that again. Henry asked if Vienna was saying that unless he stayed away from his very rich father, she would trick him again. Vienna agreed that she would if she had to.\n\n\nAt the police station, James told the arresting officer that Henry and Audrey had had nothing to do with him evading arrest. Audrey thanked James for saying that and promised that she and Henry would do whatever they could to get James out of jail. Paul then went into the interrogation room to tell his father that he expected James to die in jail. He said goodbye and told James that he wasn't sorry. James asked, \"Why should you be sorry? You've finally done something I can be proud of.\"\n\n\n",
