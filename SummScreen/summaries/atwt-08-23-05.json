But, Emily remains unconvinced that they are actually saving Jennifer by keeping the truth from her and she convinces him it's time to tell her. When they get to Jennifer's, however, they discover her doing much better and find her grateful to finally be free of Craig. What Emily and Paul don't realize is that Jennifer's good mood is due to a hit of Crystal Meth that her friend Jasmine gave her. Jennifer's positive mental state convinces Paul he is doing the right thing and he and Emily once again keep their secret hidden. Thinking she might have a fight on her hands from the baby's grandparents, Carly heads to Tom and Margo's in hopes of working out an arrangement that will allow Rory to stay in her hands. To Carly's pleasant surprise and subsequent relief, Margo sticks to Casey's lie that he's not the father and assures them that they will stake no claim to the baby. But, Tom remains unconvinced and wants to proceed with the DNA test to reveal the truth one way or another. A freaked out Casey tries one last attempt to escape the situation by begging his former friend Will to revisit his paternity claim on the child. But, Will refuses and Casey prepares to take the test. Lucinda gets an unexpected visit from Lily just as she is about to take off to Mexico for her alternative cancer treatment. Lucinda spins a story about going to a spa and Lily believes her, never suspecting her mother would decide to put chemo on hold indefinitely in search of alternative methods. Meanwhile, Keith continues to work at his mysterious job, all the while making strides in paying Lily back the money he owes her. But, his suspicious behavior leaves Lily slightly unsettled.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lily is worried about Lucinda's secretive trip, and how Keith continues to come into such large sums of money for just delivering medical supplies. Lucinda keeps everyone in the dark about her trip to Mexico, including Meg, whom she \"pays off\" to say she is going out of town with her. Margo continues to have blinders on with Casey, but Tom seems to be wise to him. The DNA tech shows up to take a swab from Casey, but he is nowhere to be found. Little do they know, he is pleading with Will to claim he is really the father of Gwen's baby. When Will doesn't go for it, Casey lashes out at him, and heads home, and comes face to face with his baby son. Will he go through with the test or own up to his part in Gwen's pregnancy? Jen is full of energy, as she has taken the meth. She feels back to her old self, but Jasmine cautions how regularly Jen is trying to take it. Unhappily, she gives Jen another vial, but cautions her that the elated feeling of being able to conquer the world will wear off, but it falls on deaf ears. Emily tells Paul she is telling Jen the truth today, and finally Paul gives in, but asks to go with her. They arrive at Street Jeans, as Jen is about to take some meth. Jen covers, and is acting very hyperactive. Emily is skeptical, but Jen assures them the medicine is working because it feels as if the fog has lifted, and she is finally feeling good again. She feels everything that happened with her baby now is for the best. Emily is in disbelief, but Paul is happy he doesn't have to admit to the secret he has been hiding. Later, Emily is searching for a pen, as Jen looks on in horror, as Emily starts to open the drawer she has hidden the vial in.",
