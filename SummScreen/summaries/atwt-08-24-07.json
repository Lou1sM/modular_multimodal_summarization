She sees the baby outfits and toys that Barbara has brought over and tells Gwen she's sure that Barbara will shower the baby with money. Gwen says she's taken all she's going to get from them, and she's not getting anything from the baby. She asks why Cole picked this time to come back to town; Iris fakes surprise that Cole is in town, but Gwen tells her not to even try that and warns her that whatever she and Cole are planning won't work. Iris wonders why Gwen can't be more helpful to her own brother, but Gwen says she doesn't owe him anything. She tells Iris that she and Will don't have any money of their own anymore anyway, thanks to her, so she couldn't help Cole even if she wanted to, then she throws Iris out.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Cole is upset with Sofie for trying to get him together with Gwen. Sofie apologizes for not having known that Gwen was his sister, but Cole just tells her not to talk to Aaron anymore about anything important about them. He leaves, and Sofie is upset. When Aaron comes into work later, he asks how things went with Gwen and is surprised to find out that Gwen is Cole's sister and that she wouldn't agree to help Cole. He asks Sofie if she's told Cole about the baby she's carrying yet, but Sofie was hoping for good career news to put Cole in a good mood before she told him. An angry customer is rude to Sofie when she forgets to bring his water and ketchup, and she leaves the lounge in tears; Aaron follows her and puts his arms around her and tells her not to worry; Sofie tells him that she can't do anything right, but that if she has a problem with Cole, she has to work it out with Cole.\n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Henry and Vienna are bemoaning the lack of customers when Alison comes in for her shift. They explain that they are the new owners of the diner and thus her new bosses. Vienna doesn't like the waitress uniform and asks Ali if she'd mind showing some skin. Alison is startled by the question and walks off into the back. When she returns, Henry apologizes for the way that sounded and tells her they're just trying to make some uniform changes. He asks her if she's heard from Emily lately, saying he heard that Emily was traveling in Europe. Alison says they're not exactly talking. Vienna notices a man pacing outside, and Alison says he's probably come to stare at her; when Henry wonders why she thinks that, she says he's probably either seen the porn movie she made in Vegas or the video of her and Dusty having sex that's circulating on the Internet. Henry is shocked to hear that but doesn't let it faze him. Vienna agrees they still want Alison working there, but Vienna says the man outside needs to come in and buy something or go away. The man comes in and tells Henry he'd like the waitress to come outside so he can taste what she's really selling; Henry grabs the man and puts him in a headlock and forces him to apologize to Alison before throwing him out. Alison thanks Henry but says she's not ready to deal with this today, and she leaves. Henry says it doesn't matter anyway since they have no customers; Vienna says she has an idea to solve that problem, and later, Henry finds her dressed in a sexy Swedish outfit giving away free samples of her cooking outside to a gathering crowd. \n\n\nAlison goes to Will and Gwen's house, but Gwen tells her that Will is out of town. Alison says she doesn't know where else to turn, because Will is one of the only friends she has left, but she can see that Gwen would rather that not be the case. Gwen says she doesn't mean to be rude but she's had a rough day already and can't deal with Alison's stuff, too. Suddenly, Gwen bends over in pain, holding her abdomen.\n\n\nLily runs into Dusty leaving the Lakeview, and he says he's on his way to meet Cheri because she called him, but when he says he doesn't know what Cheri wants, Lily tells him not to go, or at least to let her go with him. Dusty says that's not necessary and assures Lily that he'll take care of Cheri and make sure she doesn't ever hurt him or Alison again.\n\n\nDusty goes to Cheri's hotel room, where she tells him that she now regrets having released the video onto the Internet and wants to make things right with Dusty. She insists he share a drink with her, saying this is hard enough for her to do. Dusty assumes this is an attempt to stop him from striking back, and she agrees, saying she'll leave town if he'll give her $50,000 to do so. He tells her to forget it, but then, something in his drink causes him to sway and pass out.\n\n\nHolden finds Aaron at the farm, working on his motorcycle during his lunch break, and they talk about the infamous video. Aaron says that Alison's inability to tell him about her one-night stand with Dusty is what made him break up with her; he could take everything else, but not her lack of trust in him. Holden says he completely understands, because Lily has kept several secrets from him, and now he finds himself unable to stop wondering what else she might be keeping from him. Aaron says not taking Lily's phone call the other day was probably not the best way to mend their relationship, and Holden agrees. Lily walks up, and Aaron gives her a kiss on the cheek and leaves. Lily asks Holden if Aaron's okay and offers to try to talk to him; Holden tells her that's not a good idea because she'd just try to make excuses for what Alison did. Lily says she wouldn't do that, because Alison's a grown woman, and what she and Dusty did, they did when neither of them was in a relationship with someone else. Holden accuses her of making excuses for Dusty, and Lily says she's not making excuses, but she's not judging them, either, and she wonders who he's really mad at, Dusty or her. Holden says Dusty should mind his own business, and Lily thinks so should they, and she asks what happened to letting Aaron make his own mistakes. Holden responds that sometimes people keep making the same mistakes over and over; still angry, he leaves. Lily picks up her cell phone and calls Dusty. The ringing of his cell phone helps to bring Dusty back to consciousness; looking across the room, he sees Cheri on the floor, covered with blood.\n\n\nRosanna and Paul are on a plane heading back to Oakdale, with Paul trying to answer Rosanna's many questions about Craig, Jennifer, and Johnny. Paul confesses to Rosanna that after discovering the secret Rosanna had found out about Johnny being alive, he had decided to keep the truth from Jennifer, because he believed that returning Johnny to Jennifer would be like sending Craig after her, and he worried about what Craig would do to Jennifer, based on what he had done to Rosanna. Paul tells her how much he regrets this, now that he knows the pain of losing a baby and now that he knows how little time Jennifer would have had with Johnny before she died. Rosanna says she understands his thinking, and it's more Craig's fault than his. Paul tells her that Craig has taken everything Rosanna had and made it his own; Rosanna responds that she'll enjoy taking it all back from Craig.\n\n\nAt Montgomery Enterprises, Craig is offended when Meg refuses to put on her wedding ring until Meg explains that Paul originally gave her that ring but took it back to the store after having a vision of her wearing it that led to something bad happening to her. Craig is astonished that he and Paul had the same taste in wedding rings but is relieved to find out what the problem is and immediately takes Meg to Old Town to buy her another wedding ring. The ring needs to be sized, so Meg goes back to the store to have them make it smaller while Craig waits outside. His cell phone rings, and it's Dr. Cutler from Rosanna's hospital, saying angrily that he should not have taken his wife from the hospital without their consent. The call is disconnected, and Craig is obviously very flustered by it when Meg returns. He tells her he's decided they should take the corporate jet and leave tonight for a real honeymoon, a chance to have a new beginning. He talks Meg into the trip, but she wants to have dinner first at the Lakeview, so she goes home to change. Craig goes into the lobby of the Lakeview, where he tries again to reach Dr. Cutler; as he shouts into the phone, angrily declaring that this is a medical emergency, he turns to see Paul, very much alive, wheeling a no longer comatose Rosanna into the room. He turns white and almost drops the phone in shock at this sight.\n\n\n\n\n",
