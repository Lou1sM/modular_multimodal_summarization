Luke ran in and was glad to see Ethan, whom he was pursuing, and his grandmother.  Ethan asked them when his daddy was coming home, and it was hard for the adults to answer him.  Luke told Lucinda that Lily had taken to her bed and would not talk to anyone.  Lucinda ordered Luke out of the house to get away from all the gloom for a bit, and she promised to look after Lily.  Luke hugged his grandmother and left the house.\n\n\nAt the farm, Damian expressed sympathy to Emma and gave her a bouquet of flowers.  Emma asked him to leave, but Meg, who had also entered, said that her mother had no right to treat Damian that way.  Emma apologized for seeming rude, but she rationalized that Damian had done nothing but cause Holden trouble when he was alive, and she did not want Damian in her house.  Damian apologized to Emma, who got tearful and declared that he had made Holden's life miserable.\n\n\nEmma broke down and excused herself.  Meg asked Damian to stay, and she said she couldn't get through their family crisis without him.  Meg arranged the flowers and worried that her mother was holding in her grief without dealing with it.  She said she needed a break and asked Damian to go for a walk with her.\n\n\nJanet went to the police station and wanted to know why Jack had left home so early.  She also delivered the news that Holden's body had arrived at the local funeral home.  The funeral director had called Lily, but no one had answered, so they had called Jack as the next of kin.  Janet said that she had not told Emma yet, but Jack felt that all the decisions about Holden had to be from Lily.  He decided to tell Lily in person, and Janet promised to wait for him at the station until he returned.\n\n\nMason dashed into Java, full of excitement.  He told Noah that he had a friend in Los Angeles who was an agent, and Mason had sent him a copy of Noah's script.  The agent had liked it so much that he had sent it to actor Jude Law.  Mason said that Noah had a meeting with Jude Law in L.A. in the morning, but it took a while for Noah to realize that his mentor was serious.  Noah could not believe he \"had a date with the Law.\"   Mason said that Noah had better go home and pack for the meeting.\n\n\nNoah stopped Mason, however, and said that he could not possibly go out of town because of Holden's death.  He could not leave Luke alone at that time, but Mason advised Noah not to pass up the opportunity to have a big star in his corner.  Luke walked in, and Noah tried to hustle Mason out, but his mentor continued to demand that Noah give the meeting more thought and to talk to Luke about it.  Mason's point was that if it was something that was going to change Noah's life, he needed to talk about it with his life partner.\n\n\nMason went out, and Luke immediately wanted to know what the professor had meant.  Noah avoided Luke's question by asking about how Luke was doing, but his boyfriend was not dissuaded and said he needed to hear about it.  Noah finally admitted that Jude Law liked his script and wanted a meeting in L.A., but the timing was off.  Luke was thrilled for Noah and told him that he had to go.  Noah protested that Luke had been there for him when he was going through hell with his father, and Noah was not about to bail on Luke when he had a crisis.\n\n\nLuke said that he really wanted Noah to go, and he talked about how terrible he would feel if he were to be the cause of Noah's giving up his dream.  Noah needed to go to California, meet Jude Law, and \"knock his socks off.\"  Noah finally agreed to make the trip.\n\n\nLily lay in bed, as Lucinda knocked and then walked in.  Lucinda lay on the bed with her daughter and told her to do whatever made her feel better.  They hugged, and Lily cried for her husband.  Lily kept dwelling on the time they had spent apart, she with Dusty, and Holden with Carly, but Lucinda tried to stress the positive side of their relationship.  Jack arrived, and Lucinda let him in.  Jack spoke about the message from the funeral director, so Lucinda went back to Lily and told her.  Lily cried that she did not want a service; she only wanted her husband back.\n\n\nLily broke down, as Lucinda reminded her that other people loved Holden, especially their children, and they would want a chance to say goodbye.  Lily agreed that Emma could have a service if she wished, but not to count on Lily, because she would not attend.  Lily was adamant that she had nothing else to say.  If someone else wanted to make decisions, she would let them.  Lily crawled back under the covers.\n\n\nA discouraged Lucinda drove to the farm and met Meg and Damian as they were starting their walk.  She said that Lily only wanted to lie in bed and \"sob her heart out.\"  She was worried about who should make the decisions about a funeral, and she hinted that Emma might want to do it.  Meg said her mother was among the walking wounded and was probably not capable of dealing with it.  Damian said that only Lily should do it, and he wanted to talk to her, but Lucinda said no.\n\n\nDamian argued that Lily had been counting on him  lately, and finally Lucinda agreed that he could attempt to talk with her.  Meg asked to accompany him, but Damian wanted to go alone.  He left for Lily's house, and Lucinda went in to speak with Emma.  She told Emma that Holden's remains were at the funeral home in Oakdale, but Emma could not cope with that; she was busy making strawberry pies, Holden's favorite.  She and Lucinda shared some good memories of Holden, and Lucinda said that no man  could have made her daughter happier.\n\n\nDamian went into Lily's bedroom, but she told him that he didn't belong there.  Damian tried to talk with her about Holden, but Lily ordered him to leave.  Damian said that she would have to get up and throw him out, and Lily broke down again.  Damian held her, and Meg observed from the door.  Damian talked about what Holden would expect from her at such a time, but Lily said that she didn't know how she could manage it.  Damian said that she could lean on him.\n\n\nLily got dressed and Damian helped her out to the living room.  Meg pretended to be just arriving, so Damian asked her to take Ethan to the farm while he accompanied Lily to the funeral home.  Lily agreed and thanked Meg for her help.\n\n\nJack returned to the police station and told Janet that he had not seen Lily, but he had  spoken with Lucinda, who had promised to relay the message.  While he was gone, Jack received a fax from the Kentucky State Police.  It was photos of Holden's accident scene, which Jack had requested.  Jack was uneasy about the trajectory of his cousin's truck, and he felt something was \"off\" about the accident.  He showed Janet the skid marks that showed how Holden had headed straight for a tree and then veered into the ravine.\n\n\nJanet suggested that perhaps Holden had fallen asleep, but Jack said that was unlikely.  There was no one more responsible about driving that Holden, and things just did not add up.  Jack wanted to go to Kentucky and see the scene for himself.\n\n\nStill at the farm, Lucinda was very relieved to hear from Meg that Lily and Damian were headed for the funeral home.  She left, and even Emma complimented Meg on Damian's getting Lily rocked off center.  Emma apologized to Meg for how she had treated Damian.\n\n\nDamian held Lily's hand as they entered the funeral home.  The director escorted them into a room where Holden's casket lay, and Lily asked Damian to leave her.  He respected her wishes and walked out.  He returned to the farm and told Meg what had happened. She said that Emma had apologized for her rude words to him, and they hugged.\n\n\nAt the funeral home, Lily talked to Holden and said that she didn't feel that he was \"in the box.\"  The Holden she knew was in her heart and her soul.  She laid her head on the casket and sobbed.\n\n\nSomewhere, in an undisclosed location, a restless Holden slept on an old cot.\n\n\n",
