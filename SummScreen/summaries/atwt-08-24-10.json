    "soap_central": "\n\nCraig was stunned that Lily had asked to spend the night with him, until he realized that she was referring to the fact that she was \"temporarily homeless,\" since Lucinda had conscripted their room.  He helped Lily with her bags, as she assured him that their arrangement was for only one night, and there was no way that she was sharing the bed with him.  Lily was adamant that she would never forgive her mother for setting up the perfume business to fail, and Craig suggested that she remind herself of that frequently to keep herself strong.  Lily wanted to have dinner in the dining room, so Craig offered to go down and reserve the best table in the house.\n\n\nIn Ralph Manzo's room, he asked \"Mary Ellen\" for a hug, but Lucinda was repulsed and asked him not to call her by her childhood name.  Ralph poured himself a drink, as Lucinda asked him what pretext had gotten him out of jail.  Ralph praised her \"connection\" with the governor, and he produced a phony furlough for the funeral of a family member.  Ralph also said he was honored that Mary Ellen would ask for his help with her problem with Craig Montgomery.  He assured her he was there to \"save the day,\" so Lucinda began to explain the situation.\n\n\nLucinda wanted Ralph to use his influence to get Anthony Blackthorn out of Oakdale, but Ralph chose to wax nostalgic about the days of their youth in Peoria.  Then he accused Lucinda of trying to \"snow\" him, and he asked her to tell him what she wanted done and why she needed him to do it.  Lucinda asked Ralph to call off his men in a low-key manner and also to rescue a woman from Blackthorn's clutches.  Ralph was disturbed to learn that Janet Ciccone was the woman to whom Lucinda was referring, but he did promise to take care of everything.\n\n\nLucinda left Ralph's room, and she wandered into the pool house to look for Lily.  Craig, instead of reserving a table in the dining room, had been scouting for Lucinda, and he spotted her in the pool house.  He went in and taunted Lucinda about Lily, telling her that her daughter was in room 313 with him, and he hinted broadly that he and Lily were already very well acquainted.  That made Lucinda livid, and she could not believe that Lily had \"given in\" to the likes of Craig Montgomery.  Craig told her to \"face the music,\" because she had already lost Lily forever.\n\n\nAs Craig zinged Lucinda one last time and attempted to move past her, Lucinda moved quickly and gave a mighty shove, toppling Craig into the deep end of the pool.  Craig began treading water and screaming for witnesses to \"the assault.\"  Lucinda spewed insults at him and walked out.  Carly walked into the pool house and spotted Craig struggling in the water.  She went to help him out, but at the last minute, she shoved him back under the water.  \"Too bad about your suit,\" she quipped, and she left him there.\n\n\nLily was the next visitor, and she was amazed to see a dripping Craig emerging from the water.  She ran inside and confronted him, but she could not restrain her laughter.  Craig told her that Lucinda had pushed him into the pool, followed a few minutes later by a shove from Carly.  Lily laughed again, so Craig asked if she was going to dunk him, as well.  Lily instead offered to \"wade\" back with him to their room.\n\n\nCraig changed his suit, as Lily considered an earlier suggestion of his.  She said she just might take on Lucinda and Dusty and make a run on Worldwide.  Craig got excited and hinted broadly that the two of them form a \"different kind of partnership,\" since they were both single.  \"You never give up,\" scolded Lily.  \"Never,\" replied Craig.  Lily said she was only offering to be his business ally, nothing else, but Craig grabbed her and kissed her hard.\n\n\nIn their room in the castle, Carly asked Jack why he thought Ralph Manzo, of all people, had anything to do with why Dusty had not shown up.  Jack was sure that Anthony Blackthorn was somehow involved with Manzo, and that made him dangerous to Dusty and Janet.  Carly wanted to call the local cops to help Jack, but he made her stop.  He lectured her about standing between him and his job, and that frightened Carly.  They talked about Brad and how Jack had made some peace with what had happened.  Jack was still worried, however, about Dusty's safety, so he called Margo for encouragement.\n\n\nMargo agreed to have officers check the parking lot at the Lakeview to see if Dusty's car was still there.  She was also not happy to learn of a possible connection between Blackthorn and Manzo.  Carly was furious that Jack would not admit that Manzo was a personal issue for him, but Jack kissed Carly and they made plans to go downstairs for dinner.  They sat on the porch before dinner and had a drink, and Jack obsessed about how to find Dusty.  They decided to split up, and Jack went to get a map of the grounds, while Carly set out to chat up the hotel workers to find out if Blackthorn had any thugs with him.\n\n\nProwling outside the kitchen pantry, Janet ran into Blackie, who was sporting a red forehead from contact with Dusty's head.  He gave Janet a tale about \"low beams\" in the castle, but Janet was hungry and wanted to continue into the pantry.  Blackie stopped her roughly, while inside the pantry, a gagged Dusty tried to yell for help.  Blackie took Janet by the arm and escorted her to her room with instructions to meet him there for dinner.  After he dropped off Janet, Blackthorn placed a call to the state prison, trying to reach Ralph Manzo.  When he said Manzo's name, Ralph himself spoke to Blackthorn from the other end of the room.\n\n\nManzo reminded Blackthorn that Lucinda Walsh had given Blackthorn money to leave Oakdale, but the punk had disrespected her by defying her.  Also, Ralph reminded him that Janet Ciccone was like part of Ralph's family, something that had slipped Blackthorn's mind.  Ralph ordered Blackthorn back to Chicago and told him not to say goodbye to anyone, just to leave.  An angry Anthony Blackthorn had to agree with his boss.\n\n\nCarly reconnected with Jack, but she had garnered no useful information from the staff.  Jack said he was sure that Blackthorn had hidden Dusty somewhere on the grounds, so he and Carly pored over the map. Janet walked by, so Jack asked if she knew where Dusty was.  She said she did not, nor did she care.  Jack asked her to consider the possibly something bad had happened to her former lover, and that gave her pause.  She took off to find Blackie, and Jack and Carly were surprised to see Blackthorn approaching.  He taunted Jack about his being in Janet's life and therefore an influence over Jack's \"kid,\" and then he left.\n\n\nJack asked Carly if he had noticed the bad bruise on Blackthorn's forehead, and then took a call from Margo.  She reported that Dusty's car was still parked in the Lakeview lot, but the surveillance camera had picked up two tough men who had \"escorted\" Dusty into an SUV with a license plate that read ELVIS 18.  Jack and Carly walked outside to the castle parking area and spotted the SUV with that license plate.\n\n\nBlackthorn went back to the pantry and learned that Ralph had ordered his crew to turn Dusty loose.  Blackthorn, however, called Manzo \"an old man who was going back to prison,\" and he tried to get the goons to allow him to give the orders.  He walked into the pantry and chased out everyone but Dusty, who was still bound and barely conscious.  Blackthorn got in Dusty's face and promised him a \"dramatic ending.\"  He called back the thugs, who got Dusty to his feet and out the door just as Janet began prowling the pantry area again.  She tried to open the door to the pantry, but suddenly Blackie burst out.  Janet heard strange banging noises from inside, as Dusty kicked some shelving to get attention.\n\n\nRalph cornered Lucinda outside the castle, and she explained how she had devastated na\u00efve Lily.  He urged her to slow down and remember their humble beginnings in Peoria, but Lucinda was not willing to be linked to Ralph Manzo in any way.  She reminded him that he would still be behind bars in the state prison if she had not made a phone call, and Manzo whined that his worst mistake had been letting her go.  He was only half kidding when he proposed that if Lucinda could get him out of jail for good, the two of them could run away together.  Lucinda giggled and called him a \"convict,\" so Ralph reminded her that she had asked for and received help from organized crime for one of her ventures.  Lucinda refused to consider going away with Ralph, but he asked her to \"rethink\" his offer and then threatened her with the Feds. \n\n\n",

Lucinda has Uncle Ralph released on furlough from jail because thanks to her call from the Governor one of Ralph's relatives died and he has to attend the funeral. It turns out that Lucinda and Ralph had a relationship when she was poor and known as Mary Ellen Walters. Lucinda asked Ralph to help her with her plan to bring down Craig so Ralph ordered Blackie to be at Lucinda's beck and call and follow all of her orders. Ralph is upset to learn from Lucinda that Blackie disobeyed her and won't leave town and is also dating Janet. Ralph promises Lucinda that he will get Blackie out of town without a major fuss. Ralph orders Blackie to go back to Chicago, stay away from Janet and let Dusty go. Blackie of course does none of those things and orders Ralph's men to disobey Ralph and take orders from him since he will be the new head of the organization when Ralph goes to jail again. Ralph asks Lucinda to go away with him and have a life of her own and trust that her children can stand on their own two feet. Lucinda tells Ralph no several times so he says that he will turn her into the police for fraud. Lily tells Craig she has decided to take over worldwide so Craig wants to be Lily's business partner as well as romantic partner Lily says yes to the business partnership but no to the romantic partnership so Craig grabs Lily and gives her a romantic kiss. Carly worries that Jack is getting too intense about wanting to capture Ralph so she persuades him to call Margo for help. Jack asks Margo to help him track down Dusty's car and find out if he was kidnapped. Margo gets surveillance video showing Dusty being put into a car with the license plate Elvis 18 and Jack and Carly find the car in the parking lot of the Avalon castle. Janet refuses to hear Carly and Jack's warnings about Blackie being involved in the mob. Blackie decides its time for Dusty to have an accident before he follows Ralph's order to return to Chicago. Janet arrives looking for food in the Avalon castle pantry just before Blackie's goons are taking Dusty away so Dusty makes noise and Janet hears the noise and asks Blackie if he heard the noise.",
