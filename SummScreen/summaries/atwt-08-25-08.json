She and Aaron were celebrating her success when suddenly Aaron asked her if she loved him. Alison was totally surprised but did admit she loved him. Then Aaron offered to make her a sandwich and asked Ali to get some lettuce from the refrigerator. While Alison's back was turned, Aaron hid something under a dishtowel on the counter. Alison opened her sandwich to add mustard and discovered a diamond engagement ring nestled on a bed of lettuce. \"Will you marry me?\" asked Aaron, on his knees. Alison was hesitant, she said, because although they loved each other, perhaps the time was not right for them to marry. Aaron then asked her to wear his ring and see if it felt right. He was willing to wait until Alison could say yes. \n\n\nDani Andropoulos found Chris at Memorial and made a strange request: Could he hook her up with some dead people? Dani explained she was tracking violent death statistics for her job and needed to ask questions about how some crime victims had died. Chris fetched a doctor from the pathology department, \"Dr. Mort,\" who proceeded to wheel out a body on a gurney. Dani took one look and passed out. When she awoke, Chris was hovering over her, teasing. Dani offered to buy lunch for him, but he said he had to make rounds first and then would let her know. \n\n\nLily took Faith and Natalie to Fashions to check out its new children's department. Lisa tried to persuade Lily to leave and come back later, but Lily did not understand Lisa's attitude until Carly came out of one of the dressing rooms. Lily assured Lisa that she needn't try to keep Carly and her apart. Natalie asked if Sage could come home with them and spend the night, and both mothers agreed. Lily told Carly that she and Holden were legally separated, but Carly tried to assure Lily that there was nothing between Holden and her. Lily explained that Carly should feel free to go on with her life. Lisa was stunned that Lily apparently gave Carly a green light to be with Holden. Carly bought one of the dresses she had tried on. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Holden ordered breakfast, but when Mike Kasnoff walked in, he cancelled it. He and Mike sparred about Mike's new relationship with Lily, and Holden agreed that Lily was a free agent and could date whomever she pleased, but he, Holden, didn't have to like it. Holden left, and Lily called Mike. She invited him to spend the afternoon with her at her home. When he arrived, Faith asked her mother if she was getting back at Holden. Lily was disturbed by Faith's continued dislike of Mike, but Mike had an idea. He invited the three girls and Lily to go to Magic Land Amusement Park for the afternoon. The younger girls were enthusiastic, but Faith asked Mike if he was trying to buy her off. \n\n\nCarly called Holden and told him about her chat with Lily. When she explained that Lily had suggested she help herself to Lily's ex, Holden was insulted. Carly believed that it was the first day of the rest of their lives, and perhaps they should take advantage of it. She invited Holden to get together since Sage was with Lily and the boys were at a two-day school retreat. Holden was overwhelmed, but agreed to meet Carly for a real \"date.\" \n\n\nHolden was waiting for Carly in the bar at the Lakeview and she arrived wearing one of the new dresses. Holden told her she stopped his heart, she was so beautiful. Carly looked at the menu and blurted out that the salad sounded good, but that she was allergic to radishes. The conversation was very forced, and Carly finally came out and asked Holden if it were not the worst date either of them had ever had. She could not figure out why there was no longer any spark between them. Holden took her up to his room, and Carly decided that without extreme guilt and sneaking around, there was no excitement in their being together. \"Ain't this somethin'!\" she declared, and departed. Holden followed Carly home and kissed her, telling her never to doubt their relationship again. The two of them made love, knowing they had the house to themselves all night. \n\n\nAt Magic Land, Mike and Lily had a chance to talk while the girls were on the rides. Mike threw darts and rings and won prizes for all three girls. Faith finally relaxed and smiled and seemed to be having fun. \n\n\nAlison came to Memorial and Chris immediately congratulated her. Alison misunderstood, thinking Chris was referring to her engagement, while Chris was speaking about her good grade on the exam. Alison kept her left hand, with Aaron's ring, behind her back, which Aaron noticed, so he assumed she had a problem with her arm. Dani arrived and claimed Chris for lunch while Alison showed her ring to her mother. Susan was so excited, she could hardly wait to start planning the wedding. She got a page and had to leave, so Aaron came in and asked Alison if she were really saying yes to his proposal. She agreed, and they kissed. \n\n\nAt Carly's, she and Holden, in various stages of undress, were eating ice cream in the living room when they heard a car pull up in front. It was Sage, returning from her trip to the amusement park. Carly pulled on a robe and Holden hid in the kitchen. Sage explained that Natalie had gotten sick on the way home, and she decided she had better come home. Sage went upstairs, and Holden snuck out the front door. \n\n\nLily wanted Mike to stay at her house, but he was not willing to risk giving up the ground he had gained by taking the girls to Magic Land. He kissed Lily goodnight and left.\n\n\n",
