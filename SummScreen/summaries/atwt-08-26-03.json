A court order was being issued as they spoke. Jessica told Marshall that she wasn't surprised.  Marshall wanted to press charges against Bonnie. Jessica defended Bonnie and told Marshall to get over it. She then told Marshall that he would further alienate Sara if he kept picking on Bonnie. Marshall started to turn the table on Jessica and accused her of knowing all along that Sara was his daughter. Jessica just ignored him and asked him if he was going still going to press charges against Bonnie.  Marshall said he had other matters to attend to and left.\n\n\nOver at Java, Isaac talked about how fortunate Sara was to have someone like Bonnie who cared for her.  He then proceeded to bring up the idea of marriage. Bonnie would not give Isaac an answer.  She was so consumed about Sara that she changed the subject and started to make a phone call. Marshall arrived to talk to Bonnie and thanked her for breaking into his room and taking his DNA, otherwise it would have taken weeks for him to figure out that he was Sara's father.  He told Bonnie that he had filed a motion and Sara was going to live with him.  Bonnie was heartbroken because Marshall threatened to never let Sara see Bonnie again.  At the center, Marshall showed up just as Troy told Sara that she was going to go live with Marshall.  \n\n\nKim wheeled Bob down the hall and they were met with cheers by the hospital staff.\n\n\nJohn told everyone that when Bob fully recovered he would be back as Chief of Staff.  After taking a phone call about Susan and Alison, Kim was just about to tell Bob when Tom showed up and filled them in about the situation.  After Tom explained about Susan and Alison, Bob told Tom and Kim that he heard everything his family had said to him while he was in the coma. Bob said that he was back because of the love that everyone showed. Later, Kim and Bob shared a tender moment.  \n\n\nSusan and Ric were lying in bed talking.  Susan interrupted and said she needed to call Alison. Ric stopped her by saying \"not today.\" This comment surprised Susan until Ric said that he wanted her all to himself just for the day.  They planned on taking a drive and Ric went to take a shower.  Susan went out to get the paper and when she opened it the headline read, \"LOCAL TEEN MURDERED - ALISON STWEART, 18, FOUND SLAIN IN WOODS.\"  Overcome with grief, Susan collapsed on the bed but quickly recovered when Ric yelled from the bathroom that Susan should come join him.  Susan went to the phone and called Emily. Hal took the phone and told Susan to remain calm. Just as she was explaining to Hal where she might be, Ric came out of the bathroom and asked who Susan was talking to. She tried to cover but Ric caught on to her. Susan then accused Ric of killing Alison. Ric confessed to Susan that he had killed all those people and then explained that Alison was in the way so he had to take care of her as well.  He told Susan she was next. Susan kept saying how could you kill my little girl.  Just as Ric was trying to get to Susan they heard sirens.  Susan took the lamp and knocked Ric out. She ran out of the room. Ric came to and followed her.  When the police showed up the room was empty.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Alison was alive and well, sitting in the police station.  She explained to Emily how she survived.  Flashbacks showed Alison removing the potassium chloride from the bottle and replacing it with water.  Emily thought Alison was very clever to have thought of it. Emily told Chris to take Ali home. As they said goodbye, Alison made Emily promise that Susan would be okay.  After they arrived at Susan's house Chris told Alison that he had to go to the pharmacy to get a prescription filled for her.  Chris and Alison shared a few kisses before he left. \n\n\nSusan showed up at the police station hysterical about Alison. Emily calmed Susan by telling her that Alison was alive and safe.  At the house, Alison heard a noise and, thinking it was Chris, came face to face with Ric!\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica told Marshall that it would be in his best interest not to press charges against Bonnie, as it would only make Sarah resent him. He took her advice, but told Bonnie he was getting custody of Sarah, and that she wouldn't be allowed to see the child. After taking comfort from Jessica and Isaac, Bonnie vowed that Sarah would know the truth about her father. Bob was thrown a surprise \"welcome back\" party at the hospital. Susan saw a headline proclaiming that Alison had been murdered, and was horrified to realize that Rick was the killer. She tried to get away, but Rick eventually admitted to the killings, saying she was next. She managed to get away anyway, and arrived at the police station, where Emily informed her that Alison was actually alive; her death was a setup to draw Rick out of hiding. As Hal and Margo searched for him, Rick was stunned when he snuck into his home and found Alison, alive and well.",
