Lucinda offered to buy dinner for the four of them, but Luke begged off because he and Noah had been invited to the engagement party for Alison and Aaron. Lucinda and Brian went to the diner where Brian invited Lucinda camping so that they could hunt mushrooms. She accepted the invitation with no hesitation. Brian expressed interest in getting Luke to trust him again. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Alison had Susan check out Aaron's healing wound one more time. They planned the engagement party for that evening. Someone sent Alison a huge bouquet of freesias and she assumed they were from Aaron. She had to leave, so Aaron read the card on the flowers and learned they were from Chris. He asked a nearby nurse for Chris's cell phone number. \n\n\nDani Andropoulos found Chris at the coffee shop and invited him to dinner to thank him for setting up her appointment in the morgue. Chris admitted he was still carrying the torch for Alison and explained that the situation was complicated but that he was not available. \n\n\nEmily told Casey she was headed to her sister's party but excluded him as not being family. Casey reminded her that they were married, which made him part of the family, but Emily did not want him to accompany her. She left without him, so Casey went to the coffee shop where he met up with Dani. Casey told her about Alison's engagement to Aaron, which pleased Dani because of her interest in Alison's other suitor, Chris. Dani found a message on her cell phone inviting her to the party, and she took Casey with her. \n\n\nHolden arrived at Lily's to pick up his children for a special date, but the girls were already excited about going to the races with Mike. Holden declared he was taking the children and felt he should not have to compete with Mike for his children's attention. He felt Mike could hurt the kids by disappearing when Lily's relationship with him was over. Holden told Lily about the engagement party for Aaron, and Lily agreed that a family party took precedence and said that she would drop the children at the Lakeview so they could attend. \n\n\nThe party got underway with the arrival of Alison, and Aaron greeted her with a big kiss. Julie and Caleb, Aaron's mother and uncle, called from the northwest to congratulate the couple. Much to Emily's chagrin, Casey walked in with Dani. Emily warned Dani not to mess with her life and took Casey away with her. Lily dropped off the girls and chatted with Aaron, who begged her to stay. She left a message canceling her date with Mike and joined the party. Holden was not pleased that Lily was staying, however. Aaron began a toast to his beautiful bride-to-be when Chris Hughes walked into the room. Aaron continued his speech, and Chris turned and walked out. Alison followed him and asked why he had come. He told her she had invited him by text message, but Alison denied it. Chris showed her the message on his phone, and told her he had sent the flowers. They both realized that Aaron had set it up so that Chris would be humiliated. Chris walked out. \n\n\nLucinda found Luke and Noah at the farm, dressing for the party. She told them that she was going camping with Brian to hunt for mushrooms. After his grandmother left, Luke could not believe the lengths to which his foundation director was going to impress him. He also wondered why Lucinda was so interested in the man. He persuaded Noah to abandon the party and instead check out Wheatley by starting with the recommendations on his resume. \n\n\nAlison went back to the party and confronted Aaron about his sneaky tactics with Chris. She was unhappy that Aaron had used her to hurt Chris. Aaron complained that she was sending mixed messages to him about Chris, and Alison accused Aaron of acting like the old Alison, sneaky and underhanded. Lily and Holden came by with the girls to say their goodbyes, and Aaron especially thanked Lily for staying. Holden sneered when Lily announced that family came first. \n\n\nChris went to Yo's to get drunk, and Dani found him there. He asked her if she could read the future, and she answered that he needed to rethink his dating options. They played some pool, and Chris admitted that he still cared about Alison. \n\n\nLuke and Noah called all the people on Brian's resume, but no one answered. Brian showed up and questioned Luke why he was checking up on him. Luke suggested that cozying up to wealthy women was more lucrative than working for non-profit organizations. Brian then invited the boys to go camping with him and Lucinda, and they accepted. Luke called Aaron and apologized to his stepbrother for missing the party. Noah told Luke he felt different about Brian, but the boys were sure the camping trip would reveal Wheatley's true colors. \n\n\nLucinda dropped in to World Wide and was pleased to find Brian there. She had bought a book on mushrooms in preparation for the hunt, and she was surprised when Brian told her that Luke and Noah would be coming along. \n\n\nAt Lily's house, Holden told Lily that he missed the bedtime routine with the children. Lily reminded him he was welcome anytime. They reminisced about raising Aaron from a surly young teen to the young man he had become. They made a deal that they would not ruin their other children.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Luke is still harboring some resentment towards Brian for suggesting he might want to go back in the \u0091closet', and he is making his feelings apparent. Susan is throwing an engagement party for Allison and Aaron that night, as flowers arrive for Allison \u0096 only they are not from Aaron; Aaron peeks at the note and sees they are from Chris. Dani tries to ask out Chris, who tells her that he has feelings for someone else \u0096 Dani figures out it is Allison. Casey is offended when Emily doesn't want him to go to the family engagement party for Allison and Aaron. Aaron has a plan to stop Chris' advances towards Allison. Holden surprises Lily when he shows up unannounced to take the kids, as Lily tells him that Mike is taking them all to the races. Lily and Holden argue, as Holden thinks Lily shouldn't be allowing their kids to be around Mike because he could leave and therefore hurting their kids again \u0096 probably not the real reason Holden is upset though. Chris gets a text message from Allison supposedly telling him to meet her at the Lakeview. Dani and Casey commiserate together and then decide to crash the engagement party on each other's arm. After their argument, Holden explains that Aaron got engaged and that is where he wants to take the kids, as Lily is hurt that noone told her. Lily offers to drop the girls at the party. Emily is bothered when Casey shows up with Dani and drags him away. Aaron asks Lily to stay at his party and she calls Mike to cancel their plans. Brian asks Lucinda to go camping and mushroom hunting, as he admits to her that he is afraid he has lost Luke's trust; she is sure he will come around if he gives Luke time. Chris walks in as Aaron is toasting to his new bride-to-be. Allison doesn't understand why Chris is at her party and is even more confused when he says she asked him; Allison and Chris realize who set him up to show up there. When Luke finds out that Brian is taking Lucinda camping, he is worried and wants he and Noah to check into Brian. Allison is furious with Aaron for pulling that scheme on Chris, as they argue. Dani follows Chris to a bar after he showed up at the engagement party where he is getting drunk. Brian tells Luke that one of his references told him that he was checking up on him; Luke is skeptical so Brian invites Luke and Noah to join them camping, as Luke agrees. Aaron gives Allison a heartfelt apology, as they make up. Lily and Holden talk about Aaron and the past and agree that they should focus on getting along for the sake of their family, as they agree with a shake to make more of an effort.",
