    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLiberty walked down the stairs at the farm with a small paper bag in her hand.  She set it on a chair at Emma's kitchen table, as someone knocked on the door.  It was her Aunt Teri, who was dropping off food for after Holden's funeral.  Teri noticed that Liberty was really down, but she incorrectly guessed that it was because of Holden's death.  Liberty denied that, so Teri invited her niece to tell her what else was bothering her, and she poured them each a glass of lemonade.\n\n\nLiberty told Teri that she had been on her way out when Teri arrived, and her aunt was welcome to stay, but Liberty had to go.  The girl grabbed her purse and went out the door.  Teri went to sit down and found the paper bag that Liberty had forgotten.  She opened it and found something that prompted a strong reaction of surprise from her.\n\n\nShe replaced the bag on the chair as Liberty burst back in, grabbed the bag, and ran out.  Teri said to herself, \"Oh, my God.\"\n\n\nA gloomy Parker went into the living room at Carly's house and spoke with Rosanna and Craig.  They told him they were about to schedule another photo shoot for him, and Craig suggested the next day.  Rosanna reminded him, however, that it would be the day of Holden's service, which Craig had not known.  Craig left to go to Metro, and Rosanna sat with her nephew, who continued to be sad about Holden's death.\n\n\nStill at Java, Casey pushed his brother to tell him the truth about what was going on with Riley and Alison.  Casey's phone rang, but he was focused on what Riley might tell him, and he let it ring.  Riley reminded Casey that the call could be about Kim in the hospital, so Casey answered.  The caller was Alison, who said she was in Old Town by the bookstore and that something had happened to Dr. Hughes.  She urged Casey to get there fast, and said she had already called the paramedics.\n\n\nBob lay on the pavement while Alison talked encouragingly.  Riley and Casey arrived, along with the paramedics who transferred Bob to a gurney.  They put him in the ambulance, and Casey chose to ride with him.  Alison tearfully blamed herself for not telling someone about Bob's earlier symptoms in spite of her promise to him.  Riley told her not to blame herself, but she did.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Kim complained to Tom and Margo about how long it was taking Bob to bring her some ice cream.  Margo suggested that Tom call his dad, but Bob did not pick up.  Kim was obviously worried, so she asked Tom to go look for his father, but Tom made a joke of it and did not take it seriously.  Casey opened the door and asked to borrow his parents, so Tom and Margo stepped into the hall.  Casey broke the news that Bob had just been taken to  the hospital after passing out in Old Town.  As soon as Casey added the detail that Alison Stewart had found him, both Tom and Margo made disparaging remarks about her.\n\n\nRiley and Alison ran up, and Tom yelled at her, \"What the hell did you do to my father?\" Alison explained that Dr. Hughes had been having \"episodes\" of blackouts and forgetfulness, and she had tried to tell the family earlier, but they had not wanted to listen.  Tom accused Alison of blaming her \"feeble mistakes\" on his father, and he further scolded her for not making Bob seek medical attention.  Alison explained that she had talked with Bob and had heard him make an appointment with the neurologist, Dr. Prendergast. Riley stepped up and said that Alison had never made the mistake in his care or in Kim's; that had been Dr. Hughes's error.  He also said that Bob had made Alison promise not to tell anyone.  \"Except you,\" added a jealous Casey.\n\n\nTom could not understand why Alison had allied herself with Riley and had gone to him for advice and counsel.  The neurologist walked by, and Tom stopped him and asked about his father.  Dr. Prendergast said that he had just been called to consult on an MRI for Bob, but Tom asked if the doctor had not previously examined Bob.  The doctor said that Bob had made an appointment for an exam, but he had canceled it.\n\n\nMargo continued to berate Alison for not keeping a closer watch on Bob, but again Riley jumped in and made Margo back off.  Tom told Riley not to speak to his wife like that, and suddenly Kim burst out of her room demanding to know where her husband was.  She was sure something was wrong.  Margo got Kim back in her room and promised to tell her news when she had any.  Dr. Prendergast returned and told Tom that the MRI had shown a small mass on Bob's brain that required surgery.  Tom threw in a parting barb at Alison.  He said if anything bad happened to his dad, he would never forgive her.\n\n\nLiberty sat on a bench in the park and called Tony, the young man with whom she had sex on the day of the school picnic.  She left a message saying that they had to talk.  Next she called Parker and asked him to meet her there.  Parker agreed, so he told Rosanna that he would be back shortly.  Tony never returned the call, but Parker showed up and asked what was in the bag.  Liberty picked the sack up protectively and just sat there, saying nothing.  Parker asked what was wrong, but Liberty looked even sadder and said she had made too many mistakes already in her life.  She began to cry, and she ran off.\n\n\nAt Metro, Craig went over the plans for the kitchen remodel with Teri, but she was extremely distracted.  Craig questioned her about that, and Teri said she had a lot on her mind.  Craig pushed her by promising that whatever it was, he could \"fix it.\"  Terri finally swore him to secrecy and then blurted out that she thought Liberty was pregnant.  Craig's first question was if Parker was the father, but Teri had no way of knowing.  Craig assumed the father was Parker, and he commented that Carly would kill him for not keeping a better eye on the boy.\n\n\nCraig dashed out of the club and went back to Carly's house.  Rosanna said that Parker was not at home, so Craig spun one of his yarns about an emergency photo shoot that very afternoon and how important it was for him to locate Parker right away.  Rosanna said that Parker had gone to visit with Liberty in the park.  Craig ran out immediately.\n\n\nParker caught up with Liberty in the park, and the two of them walked and talked.  Liberty reiterated that she had been really messing up lately, but Parker assumed she was referring to her failed summer internship.  Parker suggested that Liberty use her good brain and go to college or find a challenging job.  He urged her to confide in him, and Liberty was just about to when she spotted Craig hoofing down the path towards them. Liberty ran off, and that upset Parker.  He asked Craig what he wanted, but he said that he had important business with Liberty first, and he took off after the girl.  Parker returned shortly, saying that he could not find her.  Craig began asking questions about Liberty, and he was greatly relieved when he heard Parker say that he had put girls on the back burner for a while.\n\n\nAlison found out that Bob was returning from the MRI, but he was not yet conscious.  Margo told her in no uncertain terms to stay away from all of them, but Casey protested.  Margo said that she did not want anyone as careless as Alison around the people she loved.  Alison was hurt, so she backed off.  Across the hall, Riley shook his head at his mother's actions.\n\n\nTom went into his father's room and sat by the bed.  He said that he was very  angry at Bob for not being the smart one in the family for once.  He begged Bob to return to them.\n\n\nIn Kim's room, Margo broke the news that Bob was also hospitalized, and Kim agonized about how she had not been willing to listen to Alison and how badly she had treated the girl.  Like an outraged mother bear, Kim got right in Margo's face and demanded to see her husband.  Margo went out to tell the doctor what Kim had said, but Riley waylaid her and pulled her aside.  He warned her that they had to talk.\n\n\nRiley and Margo escaped to Java, where Margo accused Alison of being responsible if Bob died.  Riley said that Alison had not given Bob the brain tumor, and he begged her to \"give Alison a pass\" just the way she had done for him.  Margo reminded him that Alison was not the first Stewart woman to hurt their family with lies, so Riley retorted that Margo was certainly in a position to know all about lying.  Tom approached Riley from behind and heard his comment.  Tom bristled and reprimanded Riley for his language to Margo.\n\n\nMargo said that they were just arguing about Alison's role in keeping Bob's secret, but Tom was irritated that Riley had the audacity to give an opinion on such an intimate and personal family matter.  Tom questioned why Riley even cared so much for them, and an emotional Riley walked out without answering.  Margo told Tom that she was going home to get food for Kim, since hospital meals were not so tasty, and her puzzled husband said he was headed back to the hospital.\n\n\nParker went home and Rosanna told him that Jack had called to say that there was a gathering at the farm that night with some out-of-town family.  Jack further said that it was totally up to Parker whether he wanted to attend, but Parker wanted to go and support his cousin and friend, Faith.  Rosanna asked how the photo shoot had gone, but Parker had no idea what she was talking about. Rosanna mentioned that Craig had gone looking for him at the park, but Parker said that Craig had shown up, but he had only wanted to talk about Liberty.\n\n\nCraig returned to Metro and gave Teri the good news that Parker was not the father of Liberty's baby.  Teri said that was good news for Craig, but it didn't much change Liberty's situation.  Craig suggested that she talk to Janet about it, but Teri said an adamant \"no.\"  She knew that her sister would go ballistic after what Janet had gone through when she was a teen.  Craig promised that they would figure out a solution together.  He suggested that Teri get Liberty to confide in her, and then Craig was willing to hook her up with the best person to help her.  Teri called Craig \"the best person.\"  Rosanna called Craigand casually asked how the photo shoot had gone with Parker, and Craig slipped in another of his smooth lies.\n\n\nCasey found Alison on the roof at their special spot, and he apologized for how his family had treated her.  They hugged and then were surprised to see Tom walking across the roof towards them.  He asked Casey if he knew why Margo and Riley were lying to him.  Tom gave particulars, but Casey was evasive in his answers.  Tom finally gave up and realized that Casey perhaps did not know, or if he did, he was not telling, so he left. Alison looked at Casey carefully and said that he knew something.  She used Bob's situation as an example of what happened when a kept secret should have been exposed.\n\n\nTony met Liberty in the park, expecting more games, but Liberty set him straight by telling him that she was pregnant.  Tony complained that they had only \"done it once,\" but Liberty said that was sometimes all it took.  Tony refused to believe that the baby was his, and he ran off.  Parker called on Liberty's phone, but she was too upset to talk with him.  Then he sent a text, and through her tears, Liberty read that Parker hoped she was okay and that she should call him if she needed him.\n\n\nMargo dashed home from Java and found Riley waiting for her.  She chewed out her son for befriending Alison Stewart and risking his freedom by having such a personal conversation in a public place like Java.  Riley got emotional and shouted that he was tired of calling his mother by her first name and not being able to worry about his grandparents who were both in the hospital.  Riley was also worried that Casey's jealousy over Alison might lead him to spill the beans, but Margo assured him that would not happen.  Riley promised to be more careful, and Margo asked him not to put more pressure on Tom.\n\n\nKim sneaked  into Bob's room and gave him a kiss.  She sat by his bed and talked about their \"his\" and \"hers\" hospital rooms.  She spoke to him poignantly and promised to sneak back in the middle of the night for \"a cuddle.\"\n\n\n",
