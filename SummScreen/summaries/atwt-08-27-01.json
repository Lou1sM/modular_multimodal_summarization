Hal tells her that the guy adamantly denied that he had anything to do with the mug shots that are being sent around Oakdale.  Hal tells her that there is nothing more that he can do.  Molly starts to ramble about going down the aisle at her wedding wondering if this guy is going to pull something else.  Jake walks into the room and starts to kiss her neck.  She hangs up from talking to Hal and Jake asks her whom she was talking with.  Molly tries to lie and she says that she was talking about plans for the wedding.  Then she looks at Jake and tells him that she can't lie.  She tells him about calling Hal and getting him to go put the squeeze on Nick.  Jake tells her that she is crazy and she gets mad at him.  He then tells her that she is intense and that makes her even madder.  Finally he gets her to cheer up and she tells him that she has to go into work for the late night news.  He tells her not to worry that everything is going to be OK.  \n\n\nAt WOAK, Nick gives Kim his resignation.  She tells him that she will not accept it and rips it up.  Nick tells her that he can't go on any longer with Molly.  He tells Kim that Molly had the police get involved with the mug shot business.  Kim sees Molly walk by and she grabs her and makes her come into the office with Nick.  Kim tells them both that she wants them to work this whole mess out.  Kim leaves the two alone.  Nick asks Molly what he has to do to convince her and she tells him to leave town.  Nick walks out and leaves Molly alone.  Molly looks at the wedding invitation with her mug shot on it and says, \"Well, it is worth a try.\"  She throws the invitation into the trash and walks out.  Nick comes back in and picks the invitation out of the trashcan.  He looks at it and says that he is going to prove to Molly that he didn't have anything to do with this.\n\n\nLucinda sees Katie at the Lakeview and asks her about Lily.  She asks if Simon is still helping Lily.  Katie says that she is sworn to secrecy and she can't tell her anything.  Katie walks away and then looks back and sees how sad Lucinda is.  She goes over to her and tells her that she will tell her what is going on, but she can't tell anyone or act upon the information.  Lucinda swears on her mother's grave that she won't.  Katie tells her about Lily seeing Luke and he is still alive.  Lucinda is so happy she almost starts to cry and then she asks Katie where it was that she said Lily and Simon was.  Katie says that she didn't say and she warns Lucinda not to act on anything or she could interrupt everything.  Lucinda can see the young woman is upset and she tells Katie to go home and not to worry.  Katie flashes her a look as to say she had better not do anything.  Katie leaves and Lucinda pulls out her cell phone.  She calls her butler, Matthew, and tells him to wake up the maid and get her to pack her bags and call the pilot and plot a course to Malta.\n\n\nIn Malta, Lily opens her door at the Villa and Signora Cordina is standing at the door.  She accuses the woman of eavesdropping.  The woman says that she was only cleaning.  Lily starts to drill her about who she works for, Damian or Dante.  The woman denies working for either one.  Lily warns her that she will not rest until she finds her husband and child and takes them back home.  The woman runs away from Lily.  Lily goes back into her room and someone grabs her and puts their hand over her mouth.  Lily turns and gets away from the intruder.  When she turns she sees that Simon is in her room.  She is shocked and asks him how he got back to her.  He tells her about getting off the plane and leaving Katie on and that he gave her strict orders to go back to Oakdale.  Lily tells Simon that she is sure that Signora Cordina works for either Damian or Dante.  Simon asks what she has planned.  She tells him that she is supposed to meet Dante at the caf\u00e9 and she has made a plan with Damian to meet him there also.  She tells him that she doesn't think that she can go through with setting up Damian, but she wants Holden and Luke back.  Simon asks if there is a way to get a message to Damian.  She says that she could possible get Signora Cordina to deliver a message, but she doesn't know whom exactly she works for.  Simon asks if there is a word that only she and Damian would know that would warn him.  She thinks for a minute and says that there is a message she can send him.  She sits down and writes out the note.  She gives it to Simon and he reads it.  The note says that she is looking forward to meeting him at the caf\u00e9 and she hopes that they will have the same ambiance as the Caf\u00e9 Rigoletto.  Simon asks about Caf\u00e9 Rigoletto and Lily says that he will understand.  She adds that he has to his life depends on it.  There is a knock at the door.  Simon hides and Lily opens the door.  Signora Cordina is there and Lily asks if she would please deliver a note to Damian.  At first, the woman says that she cannot do this.  Lily begs her and she gives in and says that she can't promise but she will try.  Lily says that she will wait for her response.  Lily closes the door and tells Simon that all they have to do now is wait.  Simon says that they can't wait.  He adds that the woman may come back with Dante.  He says that they will go to the caf\u00e9 and wait.\n\n\nDamian is at a church and he is praying.  The inspector comes in and tells Damian that he would like to go ahead of him to the caf\u00e9 and check things out.  Damian tells him that he trust Lily.  He adds that she will not betray him.  The inspector offers Damian a gun and Damian says that he will not need it.  Signora Cordina comes in and gives Damian the note.  Damian reads the note and looks up at the inspector.  He tells him that he will take that gun after all.  He tells the inspector that Lily has mentioned Rigoletto and that was the scene of a bloodbath.  The inspector gives him the gun and says that he will send his men ahead of Damian.  Damian tells him no, he will go alone.  The inspector says that he will say a prayer for him and that he hopes to see him soon.  Damian puts the gun in his pants and leaves.\n\n\n",
