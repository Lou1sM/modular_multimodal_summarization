Jessica says it is wrong to tell Sarah that her father is a rapist.  She says that Sarah hasn't had a father for fifteen years and it is time she got to know him.  Bonnie leaves to go tell Sarah anyway.  Ben comes in and he and Jessica toast Isaac.  Ben tells Jessica to stay away from Bonnie's problems because he is afraid Marshall will use it to try to get close to Jessica again.  Jessica assures him that her guard is up and she won't let that happen.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah tells Marshall that she hates him and that if she is forced to live with him, she'll just run away.  She tells him she is mad that he didn't find her earlier.  Marshall tries to convince her to give him a chance.  He says he loved her mother and he sees her face in Sarah.  He admits that he was too caught up in himself then and that is why her mother went back to Brazil.  Sarah enjoys hearing about her mother and decides to give Marshall a chance.  They hug just as Bonnie runs in saying she has to tell Sarah something about Marshall.  Sarah says she already knows about Marshall and she is learning about her mother too.  Bonnie realizes she doesn't know about the rape and is about to tell her when she sees how happy Sarah is learning about her past.  She decides not to tell her and goes back to Java Underground very upset.  \n\n\nSusan calls Alison on her cell to make sure she is okay.  Ric forces Alison to \"act normal\" and forces her to say she is okay.  Then, Ric grabs the phone and says, \"Don't say a word if you want to see Alison alive,\" and he tells Susan to come right home but not to tell anyone they talked or he will kill Alison.  Chris comes to the door looking for Alison but she is forced not to answer.  Susan then shows up at the house and goes right to Alison.  Ric says he would do anything for Susan and that all he ever wanted was a family.  Susan motions for Alison to go along with her and they tell Ric that they are sorry.  Ric takes out a gun and Susan guards Alison.  Hal and Emily, along with police back-up are at the door.  Ric tells Hal he is too late and that he will stop the pain and take his family with him.  As Ric is about to pull the trigger, Chris leaps out from the stairwell and jumps on Ric.  They struggle and the gun goes off as Hal bursts in.  At first, no one is moving but then Chris gets up and they realize that Ric is only sedated, not dead.  Apparently, when Alison didn't answer the door, Chris climbed into the house through the upstairs bathroom window.  The only weapon he had with him was the sedative he brought for Alison.  As Ric wakes up, he tells Susan, \"I'll always love you.\"  He then says to Hal, \"Why didn't you let me die?\"  \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica and Isaac tried to convince Bonnie not to tell Sarah that Marshall is a rapist, but she wouldn't listen. When Bonnie left for the shelter, Jessica tried to run after her, but Isaac and Ben convinced her to let Bonnie make her own mistakes. Marshall went to the shelter to pick up Sarah, but she didn't want anything to do with him, believing he had never cared about her. He calmed her down, and showed her pictures and told her stories about her mother. Bonnie walked in just as they hugged. Bonnie started to spill the beans, but couldn't ruin Sarah's happiness. Sarah told Troy that she suspected there was more to Bonnie's dislike of Marshall than she was admitting. Rick threatened to kill Susan, Emily, and Daniel, if Alison didn't help lure Susan to the house. When Susan called, Rick grabbed the phone and told Susan to come home alone. She gave Emily the slip, and arrived home. Rick held a gun on Alison and Susan, saying if they can't be a family in this life, they will in the next. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, Chris snuck in and knocked Rick to the floor. The gun went off, just as Hal burst in. The shot missed everyone; Chris has injected Rick with a sedative he had brought to calm Alison. Rick shouted that he loved Susan as the police dragged him away. Susan wondered how she could have fallen for such a maniac.",
