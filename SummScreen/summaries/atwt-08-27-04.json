They persuade him to go with them.\n\n\nAt Susan's house, Aaron arrives with a gift for Alison.  Things are in an uproar and he gets out of there as soon as he can.  It seems as though Alison has forgotten to mail the invitations and so nobody turned up.  Susan is blaming Alison for her immaturity.  Susan tells Kim that she expects Alison to behave like a responsible adult, but she is still a kid at heart.  Kim thinks that if Alison were as committed to getting married as she is, say to the contest for the keys, there would be no problem.  Later, Chris arrives looking for Alison.  He is surprised not to find anyone there, and asks if the shower is over.  Susan says that it never began because Alison forgot to mail the invitations.  She wants to talk to Chris about something.  She asks him if he thinks Alison is immature.  She asks him if he ever wishes that Alison were more mature, like Emily.  Chris tells her that he loves Alison's spirit.  She asks him again, if, he thinks that Alison is the right woman for him? She sends him to Emily's with food, and says that Alison will probably be there.  \n\n\nBob and Chris are still having their discussion in the apartment that Bob has told Chris about.  Bob tells Chris that he would be worried about Chris, if he didn't have  cold feet. Bob, on the other hand wonders, if it is cold feet, or true misgivings.  Is he afraid of getting married in general, or marrying Alison?  Chris tells his Dad that everything is all right and he appreciates all that he has done including the talk.\n\n\nAlison sits on a bench crying, wondering how she will ever get herself out of this. She's ruined everything, once again.  She goes to Emily's house.  She tells Emily that she has done it again.  She will never be able to hold a party or act like she belongs.  She asks Emily what she thinks about the \"Stewart curse?\"  No one has had a really happy relationship until just recently between her and Hal.  She says that since her Father left, Chris is the only person that ever made her feel special.\n\n\nEmily says that she should not worry.  Chris loves her and nothing will ever come between her and Chris.  Alison gets a phone call from Aaron, saying that he needs to see her.

She is having the best time.  She opens her gifts, which include a pair of toothbrushes, etc.  The final gift is from Aaron.  It is a \"recycled\" blender.  Alison hugs Aaron.  When everyone is gone, Alison asks Aaron if he thinks she can make it work.  He says that she can do and make anything happen that she wants.  Aaron tells Alison that she was born to be a bride.

After listening to her \"law student\" attorney, she stands up and asks if she can represent herself, as it is her day in court. The Judge rules that indeed, she can be her own defense.  Barbara stands up and turns to those who are there to condemn her, that her only crime is in loving her children including the daughter who wants to put her away.  She says her youngest son was threatened by James Stenbeck, and he is the real culprit, not her.  He is the guilty party.  She looks at Jennifer, Hal, Nikki, and Tom.  She says, \"how superior you all must feel.\"  She asks the Judge to set bail at a reasonable amount and release her immediately, if not sooner.  She then asks the Judge to remove her handcuffs.  The bailiff does.  Hal moves a guard to the back door.  She knows they are all jeering.  She hasn't swayed any of them as they all ready made up their mind, and so, she is given no other choice, because they will kick her while she is down.  She says, so long you miserable hypocrites.
