    "soap_central": "\n\n \nIt was the day of Holden's funeral, and Emma played with Eliza because the baby was a good distraction.  She talked with Meg about Holden as a child, while outside, her son, Seth, the writer from New York, arrived and greeted Brad, Jack, and Janet.  Emma got emotional when she saw her eldest son, and she hustled him into the house.  Parker and Liberty stood on the porch and watched Seth greet Meg and meet Eliza.  Emma cried about losing Holden, and then she discussed the driving arrangements to the church.\n\n\nEveryone had a car assignment except Meg, who said that Damian was picking her up.  Seth was very surprised and not particularly pleased to hear that Meg and Lily's ex-husband were a couple.  He made a few cracks that Meg did not appreciate.\n\n\nAt Lily's, Damian arrived to pick up the family in his limo, but Lucinda said that she believed that he and Meg should go to the church by themselves and let Lily bring her children with her.  Damian said that he was not trying to interfere in any way, and he would be on his way to pick up Meg.  He was about to leave when Lucinda announced that she was going to get Lily started towards the car, so Damian stalled in order to see Lily.  Just then, Natalie ran in to tell Lucinda that Ethan was going to get his clothes dirty in the yard.\n\n\nLucinda dashed out to rescue Ethan and told Damian to see himself out.  Instead, Damian went to peek in Lily's bedroom, where Lily was looking at her wedding  room and hearing Holden's voice. Damian approached and announced that Lily's children needed her, and it was time to go to the church.  Lily stood up but said she couldn't move, so Damian told her to lean on him.  He led  Lily to the living room, where she asked to go in Damian's car instead of Lucinda's.  Damian said that was no problem; he would call Meg and tell her to ride with someone in her family.\n\n\nWhile Damian was making his call, Lucinda questioned Lily about the message Lily was sending to her children by riding to Holden's funeral in her ex-husband's car.  Lily was too numb to think rationally, and when Damian returned, she got into his car.\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Holden murmured Lily's name as he awoke from a fitful sleep.  He found a blonde  woman sitting by his cot, so he sat up slowly and asked who she was.  The woman answered, \"Maeve.\"  She said that she had found Holden in a ravine next to a burning truck and had taken him home.  Holden tried to get up, but pain in his ribs put him back on the bed.  Maeve said that her husband, Eb, would be back soon.\n\n\nHolden asked how long he had been there, and the woman answered, \"Days.\"  Maeve warned Holden not to try to  get up, and she promised that he would be fine after some of her special soup.  Holden asked if anyone had called his family, but Maeve said they had no phone, and besides, they had no idea who Holden was.  Holden realized that he had no wallet and no cell phone, plus his wedding ring was missing.\n\n\n\n\nMaeve suggested that Holden just sit back and relax, and everything would be fine.  She fed him, and Holden was grateful, but he was desperate to contact Lily.  Eb returned to the cabin and told Holden that his wife \"never knew how to mind her own damn business.\"  He wanted to know where Holden was from, so Holden said that he raised horses in Illinois.  Suddenly, he remembered that Skaggs, the escaped convict, had been with him in the truck, so he mentioned it.  Both Maeve and Eb reacted to that news, as Holden related how Skaggs had hijacked Holden and his truck and had grabbed the wheel and caused the accident.  Holden was exhausted from all the talking, and he dozed off.  Eb said to Maeve that they \"had to get rid\" of Holden, and he took a pistol out of a desk drawer.\n\n\nAt the church at Luther's Corners, Luke and Faith put together a board of family pictures, and Holden's son, Aaron, walked in.  He told Luke that his mother, Julie, was having more medical tests, and that his step-father, Caleb, felt he needed to stay with her rather than attend his brother's funeral.  Aaron asked about Holden's accident, and Luke said that they really didn't know much.  There was speculation that their father had fallen asleep, but no one knew for sure.\n\n\nAt the farm, Janet asked Meg when Damian was arriving, and Meg was concerned that he was late.  Meg answered her phone and was disappointed to learn that Damian was going to take Lily to the church instead of her.\n\n\nEmma greeted Aaron with a big hug and told him how much he reminded her of a young Holden.  She asked Meg to sit with her at the church, but it was obvious that Meg wanted to sit with Damian.  Faith put the finishing touches on the photo board, as Parker talked to her.  He said his favorite picture was the one of Lily and Holden together, but his cousin Faith replied, \"It's a lie!\"  Luke approached and asked the teens to take their seats, but Faith declared that she would sit where she chose.  Luke told her to save whatever problem she had for later.\n\n\nDamian escorted Lily to the first pew, and the children followed.  Liberty asked Parker what was eating Faith, but he did not know.  A police officer appeared and motioned for Jack.  The cop handed Jack a small plastic bag that contained Holden's wedding ring.  Jack delivered it to Lily, who began to cry.\n\n\nThe minister began the service, and Jack spoke first, calling Holden a \"decent and honorable man.\"  Aaron spoke next and recounted how Holden had taught him how to be a man.  Emma took the pulpit and referred to Holden as \"the son that every mother should have.\"  She also praised Lily as \"the love of his life.\" Faith suddenly jumped up and ran out of the church, with Lily close behind.  The girl ran to the photo board and ripped the picture of her parents together right down the middle, separating them into two pieces.  Lily asked what Faith was doing, but her daughter gave a disrespectful reply. \n\n\nLily asked why Faith was so angry with her, but the teen yelled that she didn't want to talk to her mother.  Faith ran off, as Luke and Parker joined Lily. Lily had no idea what the problem was, so Parker offered to go after his cousin.  Damian took Lily and Luke back inside, and that further irked Meg.  The minister prayed for Holden's soul, and the service concluded.\n\n\nParker found Faith at home, but she wanted to be alone.  He asked why she was so angry, and Faith said that \"all that garbage\" about her parents' \"perfect marriage\" was all a lie because Lily had cheated on her father.  Faith said that she had seen Lily kissing Damian in their living room, and Parker said that the girl needed to tell her mother that.  Faith refused, so Parker suggested that he take her to the farm with the family, and that Faith should act as if everything was cool.\n\n\nLucinda was worried about Faith after the service, but Lily had no clue why the girl was so upset.  Luke said that he had tried to find out, but his sister had shut him out.  Damian went inside and gave his condolences to Emma, who excused herself so that he could talk to Meg alone.  The two of them made plans to meet at the farm, and then a sulky Meg watched Damian take Lily to his car.  Something in the bushes caught Meg's eye, and she retrieved the two halves of the photo of Lily and Holden that Faith had ripped in two.\n\n\nDamian poured Lily a glass of wine at the farm and was just handing it to her when Meg came in and took the wine for herself.  She also pulled Damian away to meet someone, leaving Lily alone and bewildered.\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Maeve told her husband that Skaggs had hijacked their visitor's truck, but Eb was not sure that Skaggs and the strangers had not been \"jailhouse buddies.\"  He was worried that Skaggs had \"cut them out of the deal,\" and the two men had been making off with their share.  He waved the gun, frightening Maeve, who suggested that the stranger might know where the money was.\n\n\nParker took Faith to the farm, but she refused to answer any of Luke's questions about her behavior.  Luke took her inside, as Parker managed to avoid answering any of Liberty's questions. Liberty said goodbye to Parker and said that she needed to take a walk.  He offered to go with her, but she wanted to be alone.  Faith asked her mother if she could go home by herself, and Lily agreed.  Faith walked out, followed by her Aunt Meg.  Meg asked the girl if she could help, but Faith refused.  Meg showed Faith the ruined photo and asked why she had done it.  The girl told Meg to figure it out for herself, and she took off.\n\n\nThe Snyders drank a toast to Holden, and then Meg spoke privately with Damian and told him that she wished she knew what the conflict was between Lily and Faith.  Lily wanted to go outside and be alone, but Damian tried to follow her.  Lucinda intervened and told Damian to let her daughter say her goodbyes as she wished.  Lily walked to the pond and talked to Holden, telling him that she needed him to be there for their children.  She said that she knew he would return to her, and she kissed her wedding ring.\n\n\nOn his cot in Kentucky, Holden dreamed that he heard Lily telling him that she needed him and believed that he would return.  He tried to move, but discovered that he was no longer free; he was chained to the bed.\n\n\n",

Emma struggles with having to bury Holden, and she isn't sure how she will get through it. Lily continues to not want to accept that Holden is gone and even is sure she hears his voice calling out to her. Lucinda thinks Damian should focus on comforting Meg and leave Lily to her and her family. However, when Lucinda goes to tend to Ethan, Damian goes to see Lily upstairs against Lucinda's wishes. Lily leans on Damian for support and tells Lucinda that she wants Damian to take them to the service, much to Lucinda's chagrin. Lucinda asks Lily if she thinks it is appropriate. Lily doesn't care; it is the hardest day of her and the children's lives and she needs to get through it however she can. Holden awakens in a run down home with a woman, who introduces herself as Maeve, taking care of him. She explains how she found him beside a burning car in a ravine and has been nursing him back to health. When he wonders why he isn't in the hospital, she explains the nearest one is 40 miles away and she didn't think he would make it. Holden worries about contacting his family, as Maeve insists he worry about his health first plus they don't have a phone. Meg takes some flack from Seth about her relationship with Damian. She waits for Damian to show up to go with her to the service, but he calls and asks if she doesn't mind going with her family because he needs to go with Lily, as Meg hides her disappointment. At the service, Faith is angry as she looks at pictures of her parents, but Luke is able to coax her inside. People speak lovingly in remembrance of Holden, but when Emma talks about the true love that Lily and Holden shared, Faith runs out and Lily goes after her. Faith won't tell her what is wrong, but she is clearly furious with her mom and stomps off. Meg watches Damian comfort Lily during the service. Jack hands Lily Holden's recovered wedding ring from the accident site. After the service, Meg wonders why she found a ripped picture of Lily and Holden in the bushes.

At first, Holden doesn't remember what happened, but then he recalls Skaggs and the harrowing story before he drifts off to sleep again. Ed worries that they need to get rid of him, as he grabs his gun, but Maeve talks him out of it. Ed thinks Holden and Skaggs were coming to get them and to cheat them out of their money. Maeve convinces him that that Holden can lead them to the money. People worry about Faith's reaction, as Parker goes to talk with her. Faith finally admits to Parker that she saw her mom kissing Damian. She makes him promise not to say anything. He thinks she should say something, but after she refuses to, he tells her if she wants to keep this hidden, she has to stop being so mean to his mother. At the farm, Parker is worried about Liberty and how she is acting. Liberty snaps at Janet, who assumes her mood is nothing much. Liberty later is on the phone with Tony leaving him a message telling him that the baby is his and he needs to call her back. Liberty almost opens up to Parker, but he can't spend too much time talking with her because his family needs him. Meg worries about why Faith ripped the picture and she tells her to figure it out. Faith tries to be nice to her mom, but she can't so she wants to head back home and asks Parker to take her. Damian starts to go after Lily, who leaves by herself, but Lucinda stops him.
