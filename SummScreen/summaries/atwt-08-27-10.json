She hysterically called herself crazy for thinking that he'd want to spend his life with her. She imagined that it would be horrible to watch her age, but Henry insisted that her aging and her sons weren't the reasons. He declared that he loved her too much to marry her.\n\n\nHenry said he was James Stenbeck's son, which meant he was probably cursed. \"You can't marry me because of bad DNA?\" Barbara incredulously asked. She ordered him to polish up the rings, because they were forging ahead. She refused to let James take one more second of happiness from her, and she wouldn't live another second without Henry. Henry exclaimed that he wanted her, too, and he proposed all over again. He wanted to wed that very day, but she said they needed a license. \"Honey, I got that the moment you said, 'yes,'\" he replied.\n\n\nBarbara called Judge Frankel to officiate, and since the couple couldn't count on Paul and Will, Henry decided to ask Katie and Chris to witness the ceremony.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul paced around, declaring his intention to ignore Barbara's engagement. \"You're ignoring very aggressively,\" noted Emily, who'd decided to get along with Barbara. Gwen and Will tried to calm Paul down, to no avail. Will cited that they'd gotten married despite other people's opinions, and Paul couldn't tell their mother not to marry the man she loved.\n\n\nPaul went to see his mother, but when he arrived at the Lakeview, he saw Judge Frankel, who announced that he was officiating Barbara's wedding that day. Paul called Emily to say that things had escalated, and he needed to take action.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Katie found Chris using an oxygen mask. Chris pretended to be embarrassed because moving the bench had left him winded. When he offered even more excuses for his breathlessness, Katie wondered what he was hiding from her. Bob interrupted to ask Chris to stop by his office to discuss a research project. After Bob left, Katie made Chris assure her that he'd admit it if something were wrong.\n\n\nHenry called Katie about the wedding, and Katie and Chris agreed to attend. In the hospital corridor, she and Chris told Bob and Kim about the wedding. Kim exclaimed her happiness, but wished that Barbara and Henry hadn't forgone a big event. Just then, Kim received a phone call. Kim then told Chris, Katie, and Bob that there had been a change in plans.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Barbara and Henry had dressed for the ceremony. The judge had arrived, but they wondered what was delaying Chris and Katie. Henry planned to call a couple of bus boys up to witness the ceremony, if Katie and Chris didn't hurry up. With none of her own family in attendance, Barbara refused to let Henry be without his best friend, Katie, on his wedding day. Henry had assumed that Barbara was still furious with Katie for aiding Vienna, but Barbara said she'd chosen to get over it, because Henry loved Katie.\n\n\nKatie and Chris arrived, and Katie decided that the wedding couldn't commence without music or flowers. Barbara said she would have demanded a big wedding if she'd wanted one, but Chris called the scenario pitiful. He suggested that they go downstairs to the lounge. \"Come on. It'll be fabulous,\" Katie urged, prodding everyone out the door.\n\n\nWhen everyone entered the lounge, they saw Will, Gwen, Paul, Emily, Bob, and Kim waiting. \"Happy wedding!\" Gwen said, offering Barbara a bouquet. Emily congratulated Barbara, and they hugged. Paul offered to give Barbara away, Kim asked to be the matron of honor, and Katie decided to fill in for Brad as the best man. \"I think it's fitting that a cross-dresser like myself should have a gender-jumbled wedding party,\" Henry said.\n\n\nJudge Frankel called everyone into place, and after walking Barbara down the aisle, Paul warned Henry not to mess up. Paul glanced at the judge and did a double-take upon seeing James in a black robe. When Paul looked again, he saw that it was actually Judge Frankel. Paul strode to Emily to ask if she'd seen that, but Emily didn't know what he was talking about.\n\n\nHenry glanced at the judge and saw the same thing. Barbara asked if Henry were okay. He looked at Judge Frankel again. When he saw Judge Frankel, and not James, he chuckled that he was fine. The judge asked the bride and groom to exchange improvised vows. Before Barbara began, she looked at the judge and was stunned to see James Stenbeck grinning at her.\n\n\nBarbara stammered, and Paul said he couldn't bear to look. James told Barbara that she couldn't do it. \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she uttered, turning to Henry. He looked terrified as he stared at the judge. Barbara urged him to look at her, and he forced his eyes away from Judge Frankel.\n\n\nBarbara told Henry that she'd been cruel and ruthless at times in her life. When she'd gotten cancer, she'd realized that she wouldn't live forever. Even though she'd survived, she'd felt damaged. Henry had entered her life and changed everything. She didn't care what people thought of her, because it was her life and her choices. She refused to judge others, because she wanted to spend her short time on the earth loving him.\n\n\nHenry said that Barbara didn't have the monopoly on crazy. Though he'd strived to be a normal businessman and had given up his vices many times, he liked gambling and impulsiveness. Barbara had shown him that what might be wrong for others wasn't necessarily wrong for them. He felt that he could be reckless, overly dramatic, or even cowardly with her, because she'd taught him not to fear anything, especially his own nature. Neither of them was perfect, but together, they made \"some kind of perfect something.\"\n\n\nBarbara and Henry held hands and glanced at the judge. Both were relieved to see Judge Frankel, not James. The judge pronounced them husband and wife, and the newlyweds kissed.\n\n\nDuring the reception, Paul told the bride and groom that the weirdest thing had happened to him during the ceremony. \"You, too?\" the Colemans asked in unison. Barbara was certain that James was gone. Just to make sure, Henry politely sent the judge on his way.\n\n\nChris found a happy but tearful Katie drinking champagne. She smiled, remembering the happiness she'd had with Brad. \"I'd like to have it again,\" she uttered, and Chris kissed her. Across the room, Kim and Bob remarked upon the tender moment between Chris and Katie.\n\n\nPaul called a toast to Barbara and Henry, the second happiest couple in Oakdale. Later, Barbara soothed the crying Gwen. Gwen still felt guilty about Iris, but Barbara said she didn't blame Gwen. Barbara told Will that Hal would be proud of the man that Will had become.\n\n\nBarbara decided to throw the bouquet, and Emily and Gwen pushed Katie forward to catch it. Katie grinned shyly at Chris. Though she was the only single woman there, she said it was still fun to catch the bouquet. Nodding sadly, Chris asked if she were ready to leave, because he had something to tell her. When Katie said her goodbyes, she surprised the newlyweds by revealing that Paul had gathered everyone for the wedding.\n\n\nWill and Gwen decided to head back to Carbondale, and their family saw them off and wished them well. Kim told Barbara that both Jennifers were there in spirit. Kim felt that Barbara's mother and Barbara's daughter were always near. As Kim and Bob exited, they saw a man signing in at the front desk. \"John!\" Bob called. Turning around, John Dixon chuckled and greeted Bob and Kim.\n\n\nBack in the lounge, Henry and Barbara wanted to go upstairs, but Paul told them that they needed to follow him back to Fairwinds for an exorcism. At Fairwinds later, Paul handed pictures of James to Henry, Barbara, and Emily. Paul found it bizarre that he and the newlyweds had seen James that day. Henry stated that he knew how persistent ghosts could be.\n\n\nIn an effort to banish James, the foursome tossed the pictures into the crackling fireplace, and Emily told James to burn in hell. Barbara thanked Paul for making the wedding special, and he apologized for taking a while to come around. Before Henry and his wife left, he warned Paul not to call him \"Dad.\"\n\n\nAlone, Paul and Emily expressed pride in each other for being on their best behaviors. Paul said all the being good made him want to be bad. As they kissed, they fell onto the sofa.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Henry carried Barbara over the threshold of their room. Barbara said there would be no more divorces, because she'd reached her quota. He replied that she couldn't get rid of him if she wanted to. \"Wanna dance?\" he asked and flipped on \"More than a Woman,\" by the Bee Gees. Barbara laughed, and they danced.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie apologized to Chris for overreacting about the bouquet. Chris claimed that it wasn't the problem. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with Katie, but he just didn't know how long he had to live. \"I'm sick, and I may not get better,\" Chris revealed. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Barbara and Henry get married today after both having doubts about James and his role in both their lives. The ceremony starts out with just Chris and Katie as witnesses. Then Paul, despite his feelings about the marriage, arrives with Gwen and Will. Kim and Bob are also there for the wedding. Barbara, Henry, and Paul both think they see James, but they all push past their fears. After Barbara and Henry express their love for each other with beautifully moving wedding vows, they become husband and wife. Gwen and Will return to Carbondale after the wedding. Bob and Kim see John get off the Lakeview elevator and wonder what he is doing back in town. Paul tells Barbara that, after hearing her and Henry's wedding vows, he knows that they belong together. Before the newlyweds can have some alone time, Paul decides to finally exorcise James from their lives. Paul and Emily and Henry and Barbara go to Fairwinds and throw some flowers into the fireplace and get rid of James' influence that has plagued them most of their lives. Henry and Barbara head back to the Lakeview to start their honeymoon by dancing together to the song they danced to when they won the dance contest, the Bed Gees' 'More Than a Woman.\" Chris is moved by Barbara's vows which mention that after surviving cancer life is too short not to tell those that you love the truth and share life's ups and downs with your family and friends. Katie tells Chris that just because she caught the bouquet at the wedding, he shouldn't feel any pressure about their relationship. Chris tells Katie that he would love nothing more than to spend the rest of his life with her, but he is sick and doesn't know how long that will be.",
