He said he was trying to burn off some energy.  Jennifer was surprised that she had slept so long.  Bryant said it's not how long she slept but where she was sleeping.  Jennifer knew what he was referring to and reminded him that he had told her that she could take as much time as she needed before having sex with him.  He said it was very hard for him because she is a beautiful woman.  He wanted to know if she had second thoughts about living with him.  She told him no.  He wanted to know why she was holding back.  She said she had the right to say no.  He told that he has always respected her and that no other guy would have...he stopped before finishing what he was going to say.  She asked if he meant that no other guy would have put up with her that long.  She was upset and he tried to apologize and said he didn't mean it.  He said he loved her.  Jennifer told him that he thinks that it's never been the right time for her, but when she thought it was, he wasn't ready.  They continued to argue about her not wanting him to touch her.  She said she'd know when it's the right time for her.  She told Bryant that she was scared that she would need him too much.  He said he wanted her to need him.  She said everything is so messed up in her life and she is afraid if they do have sex, she would be giving him everything she had.  He calmed her down and they kissed.  When they lay down on the bed, she jumped up and told him she couldn't do it now.  Bryant was mad and Jennifer asked him to say something.  He said he couldn't believe that she did it again and left.  \n\n\nLakeview Hotel Restaurant:\n\nCraig was sitting at a table when Sierra walked in.  She said she came to say goodbye.  She was on her way to Montego.  He thanked her for her help in supporting him.  She said she always knew he was innocent.  He thanked her for being a rare friend.  She said she needed for him to call Bryant and apologize to him.  He said that he didn't think Bryant wanted to hear from him.  She said that Bryant made the first move by hugging him after the trial was over.  Craig said a hug doesn't make a relationship.  She continued to pressure him to call Bryant again.  He asked Sierra what was he going to do without her around to give him advice.  She told him that maybe he should find someone else, like Carly.  He said Carly doesn't want him around, she pushed him out of the door when he went to her apartment and told her he loved her.  Sierra thought it was bad timing, since it was just after the trial was over.  He agreed that maybe his timing was off.  Sierra said to trust her, and that she knew that Carly would forgive him.  She advised him to be a friend to Carly and when she was ready to reach out to someone, he'll be there for her.  She again asked him to make amends with Bryant. He said he was going to miss her, they kissed and she left.\n\n\nMolly saw Craig and sat down with him at his table.  She told him that Carly was moving to Chicago and it was all his fault.  She said he was the only one that could make her not leave.  He said he would do anything for Carly but the last time he saw her, she shut the door in his face.   She said he owed it to Carly to help her get a job, or anything so she wouldn't have to leave town.  \n\n\nCarly's Apartment:\n\nCarly made hotel reservations at a hotel in Chicago.  She talked to Parker and asked him if he was sad because she was leaving town for a few days.  He nodded his head yes.  She said she was going to find a new place for them to stay where they could be together all the time.  She told him he would be staying with Hal while she was gone and she was going to make everything just fine for them.   \n\n\nCarly asked, \"who is it \" when she heard a knock at the door.  Craig told her it was he.  She told him that no one was home.  She was mad when she opened the door because he spoke loud enough for the neighbors to hear him.  She asked him what he wanted.  Craig told her that he wanted her to stay.\n\n\nAl's Diner:\n\nEmily wanted to know why Hal didn't mention anything about the \"power suit\" she was wearing.  Hal said it was very powerful.  She said she had a meeting with the Bureau Chief of the Reuters News Service.  Hal congratulated her.  She was so excited.  She said that they might want her to do an in depth series on how they caught the real culprit.  She told him that she might need to collaborate with him in case she forgot some details.  He said as long as he was and unnamed source.  She wanted him to get credit for his part but he said he would pass, getting his job back was enough for him.  He didn't think she should share the spotlight with anyone else.  She thanked him for inspiring her to go after the story.  \n\n\nCarly walked in with Parker in her arms.  She saw Hal and Emily talking and sat down at a near by booth.  She listened to them chat and could see that they had a connection that was more that just them working on the case to find the bomber.  Hal said a few months ago, he would never have believed that they would ever be palling around together.  He told her that now that the story is over, they would be going back to their respective corners, her as a reporter and him at the police station.  Emily said she guessed it was the end of a wonderful partnership.  He said there was no reason they couldn't meet for coffee sometime.  Parker ran over to Hal and Emily said that was her cue to leave.  Carly told her not to go, she said she knows she owed Emily for getting her off the hook of being Craig's accomplice and she was grateful.  Emily was very appreciated of what Carly said.  Carly asked Hal if she could speak with him for a min.  Emily offered to buy Parker a banana split at another table so that they could talk.  \n\n\nHal asked Carly if she heard of Jack's suspension.  She said no, but she thought that she and Jack should stay clear of each other.  She asked Hal to watch Parker for a few days while she looked for an apartment for her and Parker in Chicago.    She asked Hal how were things were with him and Emily.  He denied anything was going on.  Carly told him that she could see that Emily was crazy about him.  Carly told Hal she knows love when she sees it.  She told Hal to ask Emily on a date.  She said he should accept that Barbara won't come back and he shouldn't pass up something real for something that may never happen.  \n\n\nAs Carly left, Emily asked Hal what she wanted.   Hal said that Carly just gave him some food for thought.  Emily said she had to leave and Hal told her he wasn't ready to say goodbye yet.  He didn't want to say goodbye before he told her how great she was when he was hurting because of what was going on with Barbara.  She told him that he already thanked her and she had to get to her meeting.  He said that she wasn't making it easy for him.  She wanted to know what he was trying to say.  He finally asked her out to dinner.  She said sure, they could meet for a burger now and then.  He said no, not for a burger, he wanted to take her to a fancy restaurant for a real dinner.  Emily wanted to know if he just asked her out on a date.  He said yes, it's a date.  She asked \"what about Barbara.\"  He told her that he would always love Barbara but that Barbara told him that she doesn't belong to him any more.  Emily said she had to get going but before she left, she accepted his dinner invitation and told him to call her, as she patted him on his cheek. He asked Parker if he wanted to go for a ride, and he went on to say that it turned out to be a very nice day.\n\n\nJake and Molly's Condo:\n\nMary brought the twins in the living room, all ready to take them to the park.  Molly was making sure that they had all the toys etc. that they would need.  Mary assured her that she had everything and that it wasn't the first time she took them to the park.  After Mary and the twins left, Jake asked Molly what was wrong.  She looked worried but said she didn't know.  Nick was listening out side the door.  He heard Abigail and Adam walking toward the door and backed away.  Jake insisted that Molly tell him what was wrong.  She told him about Carly moving to Chicago.  She blamed Craig for making Carly move.  Adam and Abigail walked in laughing while Adam was taking movies of Abigail.  Molly wanted to know what was going on.  They said they signed up for filmmaking and he was giving Abigail her first screen test.  Abigail said that they each had to make a film by the end of the semester on video.  While they were talking, Nick was outside the door listening again.  Molly wanted to know what Abigail's topic was going to be about.  She said that she wanted to interview kids that lost a parent and the different ways that they handled grief.  Molly said she thought it was a great idea, but she just remembered that there was something she had to do and left.  \n\n\nAfter Molly left, Nick knocked on the door.  Jake told him that isn't a good idea for him to be there.  He said he wasn't there to cause trouble, that's why he waited until Molly left.  .  He said he dug up some information that he thought that Jake would be interested in.  He found out who had been harassing Molly.  He gave Jake the name of the store that had the invitations made.  He told Jake to check it out and that he is glad to able to show Molly that he isn't the jerk that Molly thinks he is.  Jake told Adam and Abigail he'd be back in a few min.  Adam thought that story would make a great film.  \n\n\nJake ran in the apartment calling for Molly.  She wanted to know what was wrong.  Jake told her that Nick had been there earlier.  Molly was worried, but he told her that that wasn't the problem.  He said that Nick gave him the name of the stationary store where the invitations were printed and it was Mary that had them made.  Molly couldn't believe that it was \"their Mary\" that had done it and looked shocked.  \n\n\n",
