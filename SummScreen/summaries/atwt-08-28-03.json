    "tvmega_recap": "Hal and Tom questioned Rick, and he admitted to the killings. Susan listened in as he denied ever intending to hurt her. He said that at first he was using her as a way in at Memorial, because she was a respected staff member, but he eventually fell in love. Susan insisted on seeing him, and Emily and Hal feared she was falling for his words, but she erased their fears when she slapped him across the face. Chris and Alison publicly praised each others' heroics. Bob told Chris he was proud of him. Mitzi convinced Walker and Chris to participate in Rose and Lily's breast cancer bachelor auction.
