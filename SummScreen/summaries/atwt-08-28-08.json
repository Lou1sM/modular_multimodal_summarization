Paul asked his father if he were still in jail, and James refused to tell Paul where he was. He also made it clear that although he was not responsible for taking Barbara's money, he would be Paul's only solution for getting it back. When Paul asked what James wanted in exchange, James said that they would discuss it when they were face-to-face. The screen faded to black, and James was gone. \n\n\nJack and Janet were playing in Emma's kitchen when Janet expressed interest in having a kitchen of her own. Jack agreed, and then declared he wanted to move in with her. Janet could not believe that Jack wanted to live with her and reminded him of the problems between their children. Jack stated the children would be happy if the adults were happy. Janet grabbed the real estate section of the newspaper, and Jack gave her a big smooch. \n\n\nKatie and Brad arrived late for their segment of \"Oakdale Now,\" and Kim was more than ready to tape their travel show. Brad wanted to wing it and not rehearse, something that always made Katie nervous. As the show began, Brad griped about the fact that he and Katie were married on the air and never got any kind of a honeymoon. He suggested that they do the show from Tahiti and share their adventures with the audience. Katie loved the idea, and Brad dragged Kim on camera since that was her decision to make as producer. Kim agreed as long as the couple allowed some of their honeymoon activities to be shown. \n\n\nParker and Liberty wandered into the woods from the school picnic, and Liberty was extremely affectionate. Parker couldn't figure out her strange behavior. Liberty wandered off, and Parker followed as she finished off the last of the brownies that Leo had given her. Parker soon got disgusted and started home, leaving Liberty a bit dizzy. She tried to move and passed out. Leo approached, looking pleased with himself. He called Brad anonymously and told him that Liberty and Parker were in the woods and that Liberty was in trouble. He gave directions so Brad could find the girl easily, and then he ran off. \n\n\nCarly checked in at Metro and found Henry with nothing to do. Bonnie was proving to be a whirlwind worker who got all the jobs done in record time. Carly was at a loss as to how to spend her free time, and Henry was feeling the same. They shared a drink and Henry grieved for Vienna, who had gone to Sweden. Carly said she missed no one, and the pity party continued. Suddenly, Vienna walked through the door, and Henry could not believe his eyes. Vienna told him she had made a terrible mistake and could not live without him, and they kissed as Carly snuck out the door. Vienna suggested they run both Metro and the diner together, and then Bonnie walked in. \n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Paul went to Meg's room and urged his wife to continue resting. He was nervous because of his father's surprise appearance on his computer. When Meg went back to sleep, Paul went downstairs and called an Internet genius to help him trace where James' transmission had originated. Paul was stunned to see his father walk into the room saying, \"Hello, son.\" James told Paul he knew Meg was pregnant and he also knew that Paul had borrowed money from a stranger-\"a dumb move,\" he said. James demanded food, a sandwich in particular, and because Paul wanted answers, he complied with James' wishes and made a sandwich. When Paul returned to the living room with the food, James was gone but Meg was there. James was lurking behind a door while Meg ate half of the sandwich. While Meg dozed on the couch with Paul, James snuck in and took the rest of the food. Meg went back upstairs, and James suggested to Paul that he stay down in the wine cellar at Fairwinds for the time being. \n\n\nCarly arrived at her empty house, but Parker came in soon. He refused to talk about the picnic, but he was obviously upset. Meanwhile, Katie and Brad found Liberty passed out in the woods with her clothes disheveled. They roused her, and she remembered being in the woods with only Parker. Brad was distraught and told Katie to take his daughter to the hospital, and then he took off at a run. He drove to Carly's where he loudly confronted a bewildered Parker and forcibly dragged the boy from his bedroom. He told Carly her son was going to the police station because he raped Liberty. A panicky Carly phoned Jack at the farm, but he ignored the call. \n\n\nThe longstanding antagonism between Bonnie and Vienna resulted in a nasty catfight in Metro. Bonnie tried to quit her job there, but Henry intervened. Then Bonnie promised him only 24 more hours of her time, and she ran out. Vienna explained how much she detested Bonnie, so Henry acquiesced that just the two of them would run both the diner and the nightclub. \n\n\nCarly burst into the kitchen at Emma's farm and told Janet and Jack that Brad had accused Parker of raping Liberty. She said Katie had taken the girl to Memorial, so that was where Janet headed. Jack went to the police station to talk to his son. When Janet arrived at the hospital, she asked Liberty if Parker had really attacked her, but Liberty could not remember. A nurse took the girl away for her exam while Janet blamed herself for all the trouble. \n\n\nJack hustled Parker into one of the interview rooms at the Oakdale Police Station and questioned the boy. Parker described Liberty's odd actions and how she had finally run him off. Jack told Brad that he believed Parker was innocent, but Brad needed much more convincing.\n\n\n",
