When Maeve approached, Holden grabbed her and threatened her, but Eb walked in and stopped Holden. Eb demanded to know where Holden and Skaggs had hidden the stolen money that Eb and Skaggs were supposed to split, but Holden protested that he knew nothing about any stolen loot, and that he had never met Skaggs before Skaggs hijacked his truck. Eb didn't believe him, but Maeve seemed to think Holden might be telling the truth.\n\n\nEb threatened to shoot Holden, but Maeve convinced him that if he killed Holden, he would never find out where the money was. Eb left, and Holden again tried to persuade Maeve to let him go. Maeve told Holden the only way they could free him would be if he told them where to look for the money.\n\n\nMaeve asked Holden who \"Lily\" was, because Holden had been calling that name in his sleep. Holden answered that Lily was his wife, and he begged Maeve to at least find a way to get a message to Lily, so that Lily would know he was alive. Maeve said she didn't even know what Holden's name was, so he told her. Maeve said she would see what she could do about getting a message to Lily.\n\n\nAt the farm, Teri and Janet visited in the kitchen until Liberty walked into the room. Janet could see that Liberty wasn't feeling well, and Janet told Teri that Liberty had been complaining of a stomach bug for the past couple of days. Liberty insisted she was fine, but Janet told Liberty that she should see a doctor, because school would be starting soon. Liberty didn't want to, but Janet insisted, saying she would take off from work and take Liberty to the doctor at the hospital. Teri jumped in and offered to take Liberty instead, so that Janet wouldn't have to miss work. Janet agreed, but she asked Teri to call her as soon as the doctor had seen Liberty.\n\n\nJanet went upstairs, and Liberty told her aunt that she really didn't need to see a doctor. Teri told Liberty that she was pretty sure she did need a doctor, although perhaps not the kind Janet thought she needed. Teri then told Liberty that she'd seen the pregnancy test in the brown bag that Liberty had taken with her the day before, and Liberty admitted that she was pregnant. Teri told Liberty that she had to see a doctor, to confirm the pregnancy and discuss her options, and Liberty reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nRosanna and Craig met at the Lakeview to review financial information about the bottled water campaign. Rosanna kept pressing Craig for details about the supposed photo shoot that Craig had arranged for Parker the other day, and Craig continued to act as though there had actually been a photo shoot. Rosanna became frustrated when she couldn't get Craig to admit that he'd lied about the photo shoot, and Craig decided it was time for him to leave. He walked away from the table and called Teri, who was still at the farm. Craig told Teri that he thought they had a problem with Rosanna, but Teri told him that she didn't have time to talk, because she was on her way to a doctor's appointment.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor did confirm that Liberty was pregnant, and Teri went in to talk to her niece about her situation. Liberty was distraught, but said the doctor had gone over all of her options and had told her to take her time in making a decision about the pregnancy. Liberty told Teri that she thought she already knew what she wanted to do, because she didn't think she could carry a baby to term and then give it up for adoption, and she wasn't ready to be a mother yet. Liberty worried that having a baby at her age would prevent her from going to college and having the kind of life she'd dreamed of having.\n\n\nTeri pointed out that there were many young women who had babies and still went to college and had a career, but Liberty said her own mother hadn't been able to manage that. Teri told Liberty that Janet would support her decision if she chose to have the baby, and that Janet wouldn't throw Liberty out of the house the way Janet and Teri's parents had done to Janet when she had gotten pregnant with Liberty. Liberty knew that, but she said she couldn't bear to see the disappointment on her mom's face and to know that her mom would somehow blame herself for having set a bad example for Liberty. Liberty made Teri promise not to tell anyone about her predicament, and Teri promised.\n\n\nTeri left the room and ran into Craig in the hallway. Craig asked why Teri was there, wondering if she had a medical problem, but Teri told him that she was there with Liberty. Liberty walked out of the examination room and overheard Craig remarking to Teri about Liberty's pregnancy. Liberty looked at her aunt and said that she'd thought she could trust Teri not to tell anyone, but she had obviously been wrong. Teri tried to explain, and Craig told Liberty that he had forced Teri to tell him. Craig told Liberty that he'd been concerned that the baby might be Parker's, but Liberty said since that wasn't the case, it was no longer any of Craig's business.\n\n\nCraig disagreed and reminded Liberty that he had often been the only person on Liberty and Parker's side. He told Liberty that he wouldn't let her down this time, either. Craig asked if Liberty was considering having an abortion. Liberty said that hearing Craig say the word out loud made it even more real for her, and Teri agreed that it was very real, which was why Liberty needed to be positive about what she wanted to do. Liberty didn't know where to go for the procedure, though, because she didn't want her mother or anyone else who knew her to find out about it. Craig said that in that case, he would find a clinic somewhere nearby, like Chicago. Liberty wondered how she would explain to her mother that she had to go to Chicago, but Craig said that he would handle that.\n\n\nRosanna stopped by the diner to talk to Janet. She asked Janet how the Snyder clan was doing in the aftermath of Holden's funeral, and Janet told her they were doing as well as could be expected. Rosanna then told Janet that she was worried about Teri and Craig. Janet assured Rosanna that Teri knew all about Craig and his deceiving charms, and Janet was certain there was nothing for Rosanna to worry about. Rosanna thought that Teri and Craig were trying to hide something from her, and she asked if Janet knew where Teri was, because Rosanna thought that Craig had gone to meet her somewhere.\n\n\nJanet informed Rosanna that Teri had taken Liberty to the doctor for her. A moment later, Liberty and Teri walked into the diner. Teri told Janet that Liberty had a minor stomach bug and would be fine. Teri then asked Rosanna if she could take a couple of days off to go to Chicago, and Rosanna asked who she'd be going with. Liberty answered that Teri was going to take her to Chicago to look at Loyola and Northwestern. Rosanna agreed to Teri's request, and then Rosanna left.\n\n\nJanet, however, said that she wanted to be the one to take Liberty to look at colleges, but she couldn't leave that weekend because of what was going on with Jack and his family. Teri said that was why she had offered to take Liberty. Liberty then lied and said she had to make the trip that weekend because her friend Mackenzie and Mackenzie's family were also going. Janet liked that idea, but she didn't like the idea of Liberty leaving town when she was apparently still recovering from an illness, and she told her daughter that her final answer was no.\n\n\nAfter leaving the diner, Rosanna ran into Craig. He informed her that he was getting ready to leave town for a few days. Rosanna asked where he was going, and Craig replied that he had to go to New York for a business meeting. Rosanna told him that she had just learned that Teri and Liberty were also leaving town that weekend, although they were going to Chicago, and she told Craig that she thought that was highly coincidental. Craig looked astonished and asked Rosanna if she was implying that Liberty was acting as some kind of cover story for him and Teri to leave town together. Rosanna asked if that was what was happening, but Craig told her he would be in New York while apparently Liberty and Teri would be in Chicago.\n\n\nCraig followed Rosanna back to Carly's house and walked in to ask her why she was so suspicious. Rosanna told Craig that she knew that he'd been lying about Parker's most recent photo shoot, and she wanted to know why. Craig told Rosanna she was leaping to the wrong conclusions, and he asked her to give him the benefit of the doubt. Rosanna said she couldn't do that, and she demanded that Craig tell her the whole truth.\n\n\nAt home, Faith saw that Lily was dressed up, and she asked where her mom was going. Lily told Faith that she had decided to try to work for a little while, to focus on something other than her grief. Faith became very disrespectful, accusing Lily of moving on with her life and not caring how the rest of the family felt in the wake of Holden's death. Lily asked Faith to tell her what was bothering her so much, but Faith didn't answer and instead ran off for the farm.\n\n\nAt the farm, Damian visited with Meg. Meg told Damian that she needed his comfort, and she asked if he could take her away from the farm and make love to her. Damian agreed, but said he had a few things to check on at work first. He gave Meg the key to his hotel room and told her to meet him there later. As Damian left, he received a call from Lily. Lily had gotten to the foundation office and had found a mountain of paperwork awaiting her. She told Damian that she was overwhelmed, and she asked if he could help her with it.\n\n\nDamian went to the office and found Lily sitting at her desk, with a pile of papers strewn across the floor. Lily had knocked them down in a fit of emotion just before Damian had entered the room. When Damian tried to help her pick them up, Lily yelled at him to leave her alone, telling him she didn't need his help. Damian pointed out that Lily had just called him and asked for his help, but she said that had been a mistake, and she should be able to handle things by herself. Damian held Lily and told her she didn't need to try to handle anything by herself, because he was there for her. Damian then told Lily that it was too soon for her to try to get back to work, but that he would be there for her when she was ready.\n\n\nFaith went to the farm, where Meg gave her a hug and assured her that things would get better eventually. Faith asked where Meg was going, because Meg was dressed up. Meg said she was going to meet Damian. Meg's cell phone rang, and it was Damian. He told her that he had some foundation work to do, and he would be later than he'd originally thought. Meg asked whether Damian still wanted her to wait for him, and he said yes, so she told him she would see him later.\n\n\nAfter Meg hung up, she told Faith about Damian's need to work at the foundation. Faith asked if that was where Damian had said he would be, because that was where her mother had gone, too.\n\n\nMeg went to Damian's room and drank wine while waiting for him. When he finally arrived, he embraced her, and she asked how Lily was doing. Damian wondered how Meg knew that he had been working with Lily, and Meg replied, \"Working? Is that what you call it?\" Damian could see that Meg thought he had been doing something else with Lily, and he tried to explain about Lily needing help with the foundation and then falling apart when he had arrived to help her.\n\n\nMeg told him that she understood why Damian had stayed to help Lily compose herself, but Damian wasn't sure if Meg was being truthful or sarcastic. Meg answered that she did understand, and the real problem was that she was being petty, and resenting her brother's widow for spending so much time with Damian. Meg told Damian that she needed support, too, and Damian said he understood that. Damian apologized for not having been around for Meg, and he assured Meg that she was the most important woman in his life and that she had no reason to be jealous. Meg told Damian that was good enough for her.\n\n\nLily went home, where Faith asked if she had found Damian too distracting to get any work done. Lily asked what Damian had to do with anything, and Faith told her that Damian had put off his date with Meg in order to go meet Lily at the foundation. Lily said she and Damian had a lot of work to do to get a foundation scholarship ready before the school year began. Faith asked if they were naming the scholarship after anyone. Lily said they hadn't thought of that yet, and she wondered if Faith was suggesting that they name it after Holden. Faith said yes, and Lily thought it was a great idea. Faith wondered why her mother hadn't thought of it herself.\n\n\nFaith then said they shouldn't forget about her dad just because he was gone, and Lily became incensed, telling Faith not to dare accuse her of forgetting about Holden. She grabbed Faith and said that Faith had to tell her why she was so furious with Lily. Faith told her mom to let her go, and Lily did, apologizing for having gotten so upset. Lily told Faith that she understood that Faith was struggling to deal with her emotions. Faith asked Lily what she was feeling, wondering whether her mother felt any guilt. Lily looked confused and said she had nothing to feel guilty about.\n\n\n",
