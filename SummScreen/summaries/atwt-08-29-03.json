    "soap_central": "\n\nKatie frets as Mike rigs up an eavesdropping connection in the basement to listen to Mordacai's phone conversations.  Mike tries to distract her and tells her to look around for something useful.  She messes around with a badger trap, until Mike warns her to stay away.  Katie steps on a scrapbook.  She opens it and says, \"Oh my God!\"  She is jealous Simon had a life before Katie.  They hear a phone ring, proving that Mike's tap works.  Mordacai is glad that whoever is on the other end of the phone got the necklace.  Katie thinks it's Simon.\n\n\nAlison runs into Aaron at Al's Diner.  She confides to him she's worried whoever wins Chris at the auction might somehow find a way into his heart.  Aaron tells her to go bid on him herself.  He even offers to loan her $300.  In return for the loan, Aaron asks Alison to buy him.  He's afraid some old hag will get him.  Alison agrees.\n\n\nWalker stops by the Roller Palace and gives his \u2018him-bo' application to Lily.  She thanks him for joining in the event, then returns to directing the workers as Bonnie arrives.  Bonnie needs to tell Lily that Isaac has pulled out of the auction.  Walker tells her he has been hired full time at the hospital.  He asks Bonbon if she can keep the DNA test a secret.  Bonnie gives him her word that she won't tell anyone Walker ran the test.  Bonnie laments over letting Sarah go, and Walker comforts her.  Chemistry is in the air.\n\n\nRosanna is squirming at the Lakeview waiting for Craig to join her for the adoption meeting.  The adoption representative is growing impatient and snaps, \"People who are anxious to adopt, tend to be on time.\"  Ro tries to make up an excuse, but the rep will only give her a few more minutes of her time before she leaves.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the new Java, Jack & Co. arrive with a search warrant to look for evidence in regards to Dusty's illegal gambling operation.  Craig is relieved that the OPD finally made an appearance.  Now he won't be able to make Rosanna's adoption meeting.  Craig's phone rings, but Jack demands he turn the phone off.  A short search turns up a bag full of cash and betting slips.  Jack arrests Dusty and Craig as construction workers in the background shake their heads in surprise.  Jack takes great pleasure in advising the two of their rights, but says, \"You probably already know them by heart.\"  Dusty searches his brain to try to figure out who snitched.  He remembers Jenifer casually looking at him while he was putting his bag-o-cash away one day, and is convinced Jen is the rat.\n\n\nPaul returns home and Jen introduces him to her model friend, Connie Larson.  He asks Connie for a moment alone with his sis, and she leaves the room.  Once again, it takes Paul five seconds to jump down Jen's throat about her and Dusty.  Mitsy stops by in the middle of the fight to deliver invitations to the auction.  Jen introduces her to her \"model friend\" Connie.  Mitsy sizes Connie up and down then deadpans, \"Oh!  A model.  What a surprise!  It's a shame about your looks.\"  Mitsy asks Paul to be a model, but he regrettably declines the invite.  After Mitsy leaves, Jen offers her brother a deal: She'll stay away from Dusty if Paul goes to the auction.  He puts up a mild fight, but finally agrees to attend.  Later, Jen asks Connie to tag alone with Paul and to keep him out late so she can have the penthouse all to herself.\n\n\nMolly stops by the Roller Palace to drop off a donation check.  Lily looks at all the zeros and her eyes bulge out.  She asks Ms. M if she'll attend the auction.  Molly snaps, \"I'm not so desperate that I have to buy my dates.\"  Even though, that's about the only thing she hasn't tried yet lately.  She bursts into tears and laments that she's drifting along in her life.  She reflects how good things were when Jake was around, and how it was all taken away with one bullet.  Lily advises her to get back in touch with Carly.\n\n\nMarshall arrives at the station to represent Dusty and Craig.  He boasts that all the evidence is circumstantial and he can get them out in record time.  Craig asks him to slow down, \"Don't want you to make any mistakes.\"  Craig's phone rings again.  He looks at Jack and asks, \"Mother may I?\"  Jack consents.  Rosanna is on the other end and demands to know what happened.  Craig can barely keep a grin off his face as he says, \"Rosanna there's a problem.  Dusty and I have been arrested.\"  Back at the Lakeview, Ms. Bryce returns.  Ro scrambles to reschedule another adoption appointment, then runs out to take care of an \u2018emergency' at Cabot motors.  At the station, Marshall tells the boys they'll probably keep the bar, but will likely run into problems acquiring a liquor license.  Craig dismisses Marshall's lack of faith, \"We'll think of something.\"  Jack snickers and says, \"I bet you will.  I've never seen someone get in so much trouble in so many ways.  It's incredible.\"  Jack gives Craig some privacy to make a call when Rosanna arrives.  With tear-filled eyes, she says, \"Craig?  How could you?  We had an appointment to adopt a child, and you get yourself arrested instead?\"  The adoption representative arrives on a hunch Rosanna's earlier excuse was a fake.  Ms. Bryce witnesses Jack giving Craig a copy of his arrest sheet, then dismisses the Montgomery application to adopt a child.  Again, Craig can barely contain his joy.  Rosanna looks at her husband and says, \"You're not upset.  You're relieved!\"  Craig halfheartedly tries to comfort his wife.  Rosanna turns in disgust, \"I can't look at you right now.\"  She walks out of the station.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While searching for tools that she and Mike could use to escape, Katie found an old Fraser photo album, and lamented not knowing about Simon's life before their marriage. She figured that Simon had forgotten about her, but Mike insisted that was impossible. Mike patched into Mordecai's phone line, and he and Katie heard Simon warn Mordecai to stay away from Katie. Walker, Bonnie, and Molly arrived at the salon. Walker told Bonnie he had been offered a job in Oakdale, then reassured her she had done a good thing by giving Sarah a father. Molly cried to Lily about missing her family, and Lily convinced her she needed a night out with Carly. Paul heard Jen warn Connie to leave Dusty to her. Jen tried to pretend that she had been referring to him, but he didn't buy it. She promised to stay away from Dusty if Paul participated in the charity auction, but, when he agreed, she secretly plotted with Connie to get the penthouse to herself for the night. After Craig's anonymous tip to the police, he and Dusty were arrested for illegal gambling. Dusty mistakenly thought Jen was the whistle-blower. Rosanna was heartbroken when Craig's arrest forced the adoption agency to rescind their offer for an interview. Alison revealed her jealousy about Chris's participation in the auction to Aaron. Aaron offered to lend her the money to bid on Chris herself, if she promised to help make sure only someone \"safe\" bid on him.",
