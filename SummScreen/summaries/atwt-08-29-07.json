When their cook quits in frustration and Henry goes to get eggs, Vienna is left alone to offer their anxious customers cereal.   As Henry returns to the diner with eggs for the morning rush, he runs into a lawyer who offers to buy the diner back on behalf of Al's nephew.  At the diner, Alison comes by to get takeout for Gwen and Will and offers help to Vienna with customers and the two succeed in making a few customers happy.  Vienna is reinvigorated at her mini-success at the diner and when Henry returns with the offer she tells him she wants to keep the diner and make it a healthy Swedish alternative for their customers.  \n\n\nWill returns home from his trip early and is greeted by a sad Gwen and surprised when he finds Alison in his home taking care of Gwen.  Alison leaves the two alone so Gwen can tell Will that she had a miscarriage.  After leaving Gwen's house, Alison is confronted by Barbara at the Lakeview who tells her to stay away from Will and Gwen.  Alison tells Barbara about Will's early return from his trip and when she questions why Alison knows about Will's arrival she dismisses Alison and begins to call Will for answers.  Alison stops Barbara and tells her about Gwen losing the baby.  \n\n\nBack at their house, Gwen explains to Will what happened and then tells him she wants to try again as soon as possible.  A visibly sad and shocked Will tells Gwen that whenever she is ready they can try again.  As the two continue discussing what has happened, Barbara arrives and asks if there is anything she can do to help them.  Gwen informs Barbara that she is feeling better and can't wait to try again; Barbara tells her she thinks it is a bad idea.  Gwen questions Barbara's response and she tells the two of her experience with losing Johnny and not to rush into anything, but to grieve over the loss together.  The two try to convince Barbara they will be fine, but she continues to worry about them as she heads out.  Later Alison returns with sandwiches and is there when Will and Gwen get the bad news from Dr. Samuels that she will probably never be able to have a child.  Gwen is devastated by the news and is comforted by Will as Alison looks on.  \n\n\nPaul lies next to a sleeping Rosanna and flashes back on his last night with Meg at the Lakeview.  He is jarred out of his memory by a phone call and goes into the hall to take the call.  He seems happy with the news he gets on the phone and is startled by Rosanna's yells from the other room.  She has woken up distressed by her new surroundings and not being used to being back home after her coma.  Paul comforts Rosanna and lets her know that the call he received was good news that he will share with her once she is dressed and ready to go.  \n\n\nCraig tries to comfort Meg about Paul's return and reassure her that she is a good person with a fine future as his wife.  Meg claims not to understand why Craig wants to be with her after all she has done and reveals that she understands Paul's distain for her decision to stay with Craig.  Craig claims to resent Paul's making her feel unworthy of love and promises to cherish Meg for the rest of her life if she will let him.  Meg tells Craig she wants the marriage to work, but doesn't want to feel weak and needy.  As the two finish their conversation and head off to get breakfast, Paul wheels Rosanna in and tells Craig to get out of Rosanna's house.   Rosanna and Paul scold Craig for not changing the name on the deed and for divorcing his wife while she was in a coma.  Craig insists he will contact his lawyer and get it straightened out, but he and Meg are sent packing.  While Craig gets his things together, Paul refuses to speak with Meg and she is left alone with Rosanna who questions her about how she came to be with Craig.   Meg fills Rosanna in on what really happened up at the cliffs between Craig and Paul and about her earlier plans to marry Paul.   Rosanna asks Meg if she thinks she would be married to Paul if the cliff fall hadn't happened.   Meg replies that she loved Paul and had planned a future with him.  Paul overhears the conversation and rushes in condemning Meg's betrayal at being with Craig so soon after she thought he had died.  Meg lashes out at Paul deception and tells him that one of the reasons she stayed with Craig was because he doesn't make her feel worthless, like Paul does.   When Craig is done packing he and Meg leave the house accepting the loss of this battle.  \n\n\nCraig and Meg arrive at the Lakeview where Craig tells Meg that as long as he has her he doesn't care about losing all the other possessions.  The two hug and Meg tells Craig that she wants to be his wife in \"every way\" and she undresses and kisses him. \n\n\nBack at her mansion, Rosanna is made comfortable by Paul, but she continues to questions his true feelings for Meg.  He tells her that he thought he loved her once, but all he feels now is contempt.  Rosanna asks for the phone to call her sister, but holding the phone reminds her of what happened the night of her accident. \n\n\n",
