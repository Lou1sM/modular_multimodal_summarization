While pandemonium is engulfing the courthouse, Chris delivers leftovers which Susan sent from the aborted wedding shower, to Emily.  Sparks once again fly between Chris and Emily, but Hal bursts in the door, worried about Emily's safety because of Barbara's escape.

At this time, Dusty meets Craig at metro, where he informs Craig that he will be staying with Lucy from now on.

Dusty backs down and returns to Lucy, where he receives a loving welcome.  Craig goes back to metro, where he meets Dominic Ramsey, who is an old friend of Dusty's from Chicago.  He tells Craig that he is looking to make money in the fight game, which piques Craig's interest.\n\n\nAt the water park, Jack gets a glimpse of Carly and Sage, but they move out of sight before he can approach them.
