Nervous, Paul gets off the subject by surprising Emily with gifts for her son but a suspicious Emily questions his motives. Will interrupts and drops the bomb that Gwen thinks the baby she's trying to get from Carly may not even be hers. Meanwhile, Casey lambastes Gwen for trying to trap him. At the same time, Will confers with Bob about Gwen's suspicions of a baby switch. Bob doesn't think a baby switch is possible and cautions Will to be Gwen's friend but to take care of himself as well. Meanwhile, back at Al's, Paul surprises Gwen by offering his help. Jennifer scores another hit of Crystal Meth and mixes it with double-doses of her antidepressants. Though Paul remains oblivious, Dusty begins to see a change in Jennifer but when he mentions it, she goes off on him. Dusty tells her he will back off but remains suspicious. Facing the possibility that re-injured Henry might never get out from under their feet, Mike puts in a call to his friend and physical therapist who promises to have Henry back on his feet in no time. But, Katie and Mike are stunned when Maddie announces that she will be staying in Oakdale and attending school at Oakdale Latin. The news causes Katie to worry that even if Henry recovers physically, he will have a hard time stabilizing himself economically now that he's got a young teenager to look after. Later, however, after the examination which Henry fakes, the physical therapist tells Mike he's not sure there's anything physically wrong with Henry and the problem could stem from the emotional stress he has been under. Just as Mike is about to tell Katie the news, a bouquet of flowers arrives for Katie, to Maddie's delight. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jen is having withdrawals from the drugs, and is acting erratic, which Dusty is suspicious of. His suspicions are even more piqued when he runs into the dealer Jen has frantically called. When his prying and questions send her over the edge, a now high Jen, tells him to leave her alone! Maddie ups her plan to break up Katie and Henry when she emails Byron, a geek from high school that liked Katie, under the guise of being Katie. He later anonymously sends her flowers, to Maddie's pleasure. Gwen wants to see the baby at Carly's, because she will know if the baby is hers. She considers a maternity test after she wonders if the baby is hers. She needs money to pay Cass in order to keep his services though. Will promises to come through with the money. Later, Casey bitterly threatens to get Gwen back for trying to trap him into being the father to her baby. He will make sure Will deserts her for what she has done. Gwen worries about Casey's threats. Will asks Bob if there could be a chance of a baby switch, and Bob assures him it is very unlikely. Paul wants Daniel to move in with him and Emily, but Emily is still unsure of how she feels about her and Paul keeping quiet about Jen's baby being alive. Will interrupts them by asking for Paul's help, explaining what happened to a suddenly nervous Paul about Gwen and her \u0091baby' in court. Is all of Paul's plotting going to blow up in his face because of Gwen's situation? What can he do? He decides to go pay Gwen a visit.",
