Hal had told Chris to stay with Emily after finding out about Barbara's escape.  Hal calls Emily's cell phone, but, gets Barbara instead.  Hal asks her about the gun going off and was anyone hurt?

It's a matter of high priority and an extreme emergency.  While saying this, Hal receives another call.  It is from Barbara, once again.  She tells him that she is far, far away and will be leaving the country.  Hal asks her if it is a farewell call.  She tells him that Chris and Emily are at the boathouse and there's a device that will blow them up in 20 minutes if he ever wants to see his wife again.  She says then he can feel what it is like to lose someone, since he won't let her have Will.  He questions her about explosives and where she got them.  He tells her that he doesn't believe what she has to say, and is only saying the things she is to get Hal out to the boathouse so he will not go to the hospital.
