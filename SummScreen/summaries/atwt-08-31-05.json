Emily noticed the baby's footprints were on the table so she rushed Susan out but gave her a key to Paul's before she left in case she ever needed to watch Daniel. Emily than called Paul and told him she was putting the baby's footprints in the wall safe. After Susan left Paul's she meet up with Hal to tell him about Daniel moving into Paul's. They were both still worried about Emily so they decided to go to Paul's to search around for something suspicious. \n\n\nCarly called the bank to make sure that she could write a check for $10,000 for Iris. After Carly got off the phone Jack wanted to know why Carly wanted to take $10,000 out of the bank, she covered by saying she wanted to make sure they had enough money in the bank to cover the lawyers fees for the case against Gwen. Carly left to go give Iris the money. Carly told Iris this was the last of the money she was going to get from her when Emily showed up; Iris made an excuse that her and Carly were old acquaintances and left but not before she told Carly she would stay in touch.  Emily told Carly how happy she was with Paul and that nothing would stand in the way of her happiness as Emily looks on at Rory. Carly told Emily that Gwen lied and Casey was not the father of her baby. A shocked Carly listened as Emily suggested that Carly just give the baby back to Gwen. \n\n\nPaul was telling Gwen how he wants to help her get her baby back and pay for her lawyer bills. Paul also tried to convince her that maybe Carly switched the paternity tests to make it look like Gwen was lying about the father. They were interrupted when Will stopped by so Paul snuck out the window. Will told Gwen he wanted to take money out of his trust fund to help pay for the lawyer. Knowing Paul just snuck out of the window Gwen got Will to leave. After Will left Paul came back and tried to explain why he did not want Will to know he was there but Gwen did not but his act and wanted to know what his true motives were.  \n\n\nKatie wondered who sent her the flowers but Mike thinks he knows who sent them, Simon. Katie did not believe Simon would ever try to contact her again but than started to have doubts herself and was afraid he might come back and ruin her relationship with Mike again. Mike told Katie he would never let anything come between them again. Meanwhile Maddie is sending an email to Bryon as Katie thanking him for the flowers he sent Katie. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jack almost catches Carly pilfering their accounts to pay Iris, but she covers claiming that she is getting the funds together for the lawyer. She almost changes her mind to tell Jack, but chooses not to when Iris interrupts. Carly pays an additional $10,000 in hush money to Iris, as Emily, who thinks she recognizes Iris, runs into them with Rory. The guilt seems to get the best of Emily when she finds herself defending Gwen to Carly. Susan tells Hal that she is worried about Emily moving Daniel into Paul's apartment to prove to everyone she is fine. They later use the key Emily gave Susan to check out Paul's apartment to see if they find anything suspicious will they see the baby footprints? Paul subtly directs Gwen into assuming Carly messed with the paternity test results. He tells her he will help her if she only listens to him. He claims he is helping her because of Will, but when he hides from Will when he comes to see Gwen, she pointedly asks Paul if Carly isn't the only one playing her? Mike is concerned the flowers anonymously sent to Katie are from Simon. Maddie is interested in hearing the story of Simon now, hoping this will help her cause further to break up Katie and Mike, as she continues to email Bryon as \u0091Katie.'",
