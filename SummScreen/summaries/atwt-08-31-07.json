    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Old Town\n, Holden runs into Luke, Noah, and Maddie, who are talking about the 1-bedroom apartment Maddie and Noah have found; Luke introduces Noah to Holden. Holden shows the teens the newspaper headline about Dusty's arrest for the murder of Cheri Love at the Lakeview. Maddie and Noah realize that's the woman they saw Dusty arguing with, and Holden asks what they heard. Maddie tells him that Dusty said he'd get even with Cheri for hurting him, and she mentions that Lily heard the exchange, too. Noah heads back to WOAK to work, while Maddie leaves to go get Henry to cosign their lease. Holden asks Luke if something's up with Noah and cautions him against getting himself into another situation like the one with Kevin. Luke assures him this is different but doesn't really want to discuss it. Holden tells Luke he'll always worry about him, and Luke tells Holden the same is true for him, and he doesn't want to worry one day that Holden didn't do everything he could to fix things with Lily.\n\n\nLily visits Carly, telling her she has heard the wonderful news about Paul and Rosanna. Carly is wearing her little black dress, the one that Jack used to find irresistible, and Lily points out it's a bit much for the backyard picnic they were invited to in honor of Jack and Katie's engagement. Carly makes it quite clear that she intends to win Jack back, even after Lily tries to tell her she's deluding herself. Lily leaves and runs into Holden in Old Town\n, where he tells her he found out that she actually overheard Dusty threatening Cheri Love. Angry, he grabs her arm and tells her she has to stop hiding things from him and stop trying to help Dusty, instead putting her family first, for a change. Lily says she's leaving to go post bail for Dusty. When Holden asks why, Lily says because Cheri went after Dusty after he told Lily who she was and stopped her from using the Lakeview for her prostitution activities; Lily feels like she owes it to Dusty to help him get out of this situation, but Holden doesn't agree. He reminds her that Barbara brought Dusty back to town to break up Rose and Paul's engagement, and that after that, Dusty rigged the boxing match that almost got Aaron killed and then hurt Aaron by sleeping with Alison, and later, shot Craig in the chest. He calls Dusty self-destructive and says he's dragging Lily down with him. When Lily says she doesn't see why she should have to choose between her family and her friend, Holden tells her that's the whole problem right there, but Lily leaves anyway and goes to bail Dusty out of jail.\n\n\nAt the diner, Henry and Vienna are alone and taking advantage of the moment when Colonel Mayer walks in; embarrassed, he turns to leave, but Henry apologizes and tells him they're closed. The colonel says he was looking for Henry Coleman, and Vienna tells him he's found him. Colonel Mayer tells Henry that he's Noah's father, and Henry invites him to sit down to talk. Vienna is her normal, quirky, flirtatious self, and the colonel is clearly flustered by her. Henry gets up to get him some coffee, when Maddie walks in; Henry points out that Noah's dad is there, and Maddie joins Vienna and the colonel at the table. Colonel Mayer wants them all to go have dinner together, but Vienna and Henry are supposed to be at the engagement party, so he says they'll do it another time. Everyone leaves, but Henry and Vienna go back to canoodling and never do make it to the engagement party. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Luke walks up to Noah in the editing room and tells him he wishes that his presence didn't make Noah so uncomfortable. Noah tells Luke that they've discussed this already and that he can't be gay, for a lot of reasons. Luke tells him that he understands what he's fighting, because he fought it, too, but he says it won't work in the long run, and he asks Noah what would make him happy, as opposed to his father or Maddie. Luke tells Noah that one day, he'll wake up and realize he's made a life with someone he's never been in love with, and he tells Noah that he has to face the fact that he's gay. Noah tells Luke to get over himself, and as he tries to leave, Luke grabs him, and they look at each other, face to face. At that moment, Maddie walks up, and seeing their reactions, she demands to know what's going on between them, because she doesn't believe it's \"creative differences.\"\n\n\nAt the farm, Jack, Katie, and the kids get things ready for the engagement party. Brad is the first to arrive, and he tells Katie that he tried to \"slow down the Carly express\" while she was in Hawaii. Katie is upset that Brad didn't listen when she asked him to stay out of her personal affairs, but then she asks Brad what Carly tried to do, and he tells her that Carly thinks she and Jack are \"inevitable.\" Carly eventually arrives, bringing a gift, which Jack asks her to put with all the others on the porch. Sage comes out with Parker and JJ and tells Carly that Katie has asked her to be her flower girl; Carly graciously agrees that that's a wonderful thing. Parker asks why Carly is so overdressed, and she says she just didn't realize this was going to be so casual. The kids leave to go fishing at the pond, and Jack announces to everyone that he'd like to say a few words. He tells everyone that he was a broken man when he and Katie became friends, and that he realized one day that it was more than friendship that he felt for her. He gives her a watch as a present, but it doesn't quite fit. The party breaks up, and Carly lingers, wanting to talk to Jack. He goes inside to answer the phone, and Katie takes the opportunity to tell Carly that she understands how she feels, but if she really loves Jack, she needs to let him go. Inside, Jack is talking to Holden on the phone, as Holden apologizes for missing the party. When Jack asks if everything's all right, Holden says \"things are pretty far from all right,\" but he tells Jack not to worry about it.\n\n\n\n\n",
