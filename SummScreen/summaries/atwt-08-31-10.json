When Casey again offered his great-grandmother's ring to Alison, she answered that they just couldn't spring their engagement on their families because it involved their moving to Carbondale, which would create even more sadness.  Alison said that was all about remembering Nancy.  Casey, however, was not satisfied with just an hour's church service for the family, even though that was what Nancy had expressly requested.\n\n\nCasey gave it some thought and then grabbed Alison's hand and pulled her out the door.  They were surprised to find that Lucinda had already arrived for the family gathering, so Casey invited her in and urged her to make herself comfortable while he and Alison ran an errand.\n\n\nKim, Bob, and Margo gathered in Tom's office, waiting for him to read Nancy's will, per her instructions.  Kim was unhappy that they were not doing more to honor the memory of her mother-in-law, someone who had meant so much to all of them.  She got upset and had to leave the room, so Bob followed her.  Margo and Tom also mused about how they, like the rest of the family, had no chance to say goodbye to the matriarch of their family.  Bob escorted Kim back into the office, and Margo suggested that they name something important in Oakdale for Nancy, and Tom flashed back to when his grandmother had lost Dan, her second husband, and Tom had realized for the first time that Nancy was not indestructible.\n\n\nChris and Katie returned to her house after the funeral, and Chris received a text message from John Dixon asking why Chris had not yet checked himself into Memorial Hospital.  Chris told Katie that he could not do that without first telling his family, but he was not prepared to further burden his folks with bad news on that day.  He also asked Katie to please not treat him like an invalid, so Katie offered to tell him about her dearly departed friend, Nancy.  Katie had enjoyed an unusually close relationship with Nancy, and she shared some stories with Chris.  That only made Katie more fearful of losing him, as well, so Chris asked Katie to help him through the day, and said that the next day, they would tell everyone about Chris's illness.\n\n\nBarbara could not reach Lisa by phone, so she went down to Fashions but found the place closed and locked.  She left Lisa a message to meet them at Tom and Margo's, but Lisa, who was grieving inside the store, did not acknowledge it.  Finally, Lisa had to answer a persistent pounding on the door, and she found Casey and Alison standing there.  Casey said he felt terrible that people were so sad, and he asked Lisa what one last present Lisa would give Nancy if she got the chance.  Lisa said that Nancy was not about \"things;\" instead she spoke of Nancy's \"loving spirit\" that went right into action when people needed help.\n\n\nAt Tom and Margo's, Susan Stewart and Barbara joined Lucinda, and they laughed about their \"bus ride from hell\" that involved many of the women of Oakdale.  Soon Margo and Tom, plus Bob and Kim, arrived, and Bob reminisced about a Christmas many years before when Tom was just a boy, and Nancy had urged him to call his mother, who was no longer married to Bob.  Chris and Katie rang the doorbell, and before long, Casey and Alison arrived with Lisa in tow.\n\n\nAlison and Casey said they had decided to do what Nancy, herself, would do if she were there, and that was to help other people.  They asked everyone to take two hours to volunteer somewhere where they could make a difference in the community.  John Dixon surprised everyone by showing up, and he began talking to Kim and Bob as if they knew about Chris's illness.  John thought the gathering was for Chris to tell his family about his condition, and he was stunned to learn of Nancy's death.\n\n\nChris took John aside and explained, but John made him shake his hand so he could check Chris's pulse. Lucinda surprised John and walked up behind him, and the two traded barbs.  Casey announced that it was time for everyone to take off for his volunteer duty, and they made plans to meet in Old Town in two hours.\n\n\nBob and Kim, along with Chris and Katie, went to Nancy's apartment to begin packing up things to be donated to the women's shelter.  Kim, however, decided that was a job for the younger generation, so she and Bob left on their own mission.   Katie was upset that Chris was so stubborn, but they began going through Nancy's treasures.  Katie found Nancy's marriage license to Chris and the bronzed shoes of their first child, Susan, who had died in a swimming accident as a teenager.  Chris also found an album of pictures that showed 50 years of happiness, and it inspired the younger lovers to kiss.\n\n\nMargo and Tom went to Nancy's favorite school and endowed a Nancy Hughes Memorial Scholarship.  They remembered how Nancy had mentored Kira, an illiterate teen, who had captured Nancy's heart with her enthusiasm for learning.\n\n\nKim and Bob packed up some of the many books that Nancy had loaned the hospital, and Kim suggested that they set up a mini-library in her honor at Memorial.  Lisa took Susan and Barbara to the bar at the Lakeview and ordered them two regular Pink Ladies and one virgin one.  They sat at a table, and Lisa told them how loving Nancy had been during the first few months of Lisa and Bob's marriage.  Then she informed the women that they were \"buying\" their own drinks by donating a large amount in Nancy's name to a local charity of their choice, and they toasted Nancy.\n\n\nJohn Dixon and Lucinda sat at the bar at Yo's, and John griped that Lucinda had conned him out of donating free medical services to Luke's foundation and then had taken him there for a lousy beer.  Lucinda blurted out that Lily was no longer speaking to her, and she had been praying for a solution but was having a hard time believing that John Dixon was the answer to her prayers.  John reminded his old friend that children were more important than anything, particularly pride.\n\n\nAlison and Casey volunteered at the Legal Aid Society, and then they went to Old Town to distribute memorial candles to the group.  Casey couldn't stand it, and he took out Nancy's engagement ring and slipped it onto Alison's hand.  They kissed, and Alison stopped resisting.  Everyone joined them to light the white tapers, and Bob began reciting his mother's favorite Thanksgiving prayer, which soon was taken over by Nancy's voice.  Chris showed up late, but Katie was not with him.  She had returned to Nancy's apartment alone because she remembered how comforting Nancy had been when Katie had lost Brad.  Katie cried out to Nancy to help her deal with the crisis with Chris. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "The Hughes family and friends gather for a private funeral service for Nancy which was not shown on screen. Casey comes up with the idea to spit everyone into groups of two to do a good deed to honor Nancy. Chris and Katie gather Nancy's things and place them in boxes to be distributed to family and friends. Chins insists that he won't go to the hospital or tell his family about his medical condition until the family has had a little time to mourn Nancy's loss. Chris ignores John's medical advice to go to the hospital right away. Chris promises Katie that he will fight his illness so that he and Katie can have a strong marriage like that of his Granma Nancy and Grandpa Chris. Casey and Allison volunteer at Legal aid to honor Nancy and Casey's places Nancy's ring on Alison's finger even though they decide not to tell the family the news right away. Lucinda persuades John to volunteer to give free medical care to the people that ask for help from Luke's foundation. Lisa, Susan, and Barbara drink pink ladies and toast Nancy and decide to donate money to a charity that was dear to Nancy's heart. Tom and Margo create the Nancy Hughes memorial scholarship at a local school because Nancy worked as a teacher for most of her life. Bob and Kim decide to create a mini Library at the hospital because Nancy loved to read and thought it was important to know how to read. The family also shares memories of Nancy and then meet at Old town for a candle light service to Honor Nancy. Katie promises Chris that she will be with him as he fights his illness but she misses the candlelight service because she stayed behind in Nancy's apartment to cry because she can't bear to lose another person that she loves.",
