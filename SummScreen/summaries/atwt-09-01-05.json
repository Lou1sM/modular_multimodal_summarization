    "soap_central": "\n\nCarly is unnerved by Emily's suggestion that she give up the baby. She realizes that Emily's reasoning stems from her desire to keep Rosanna's baby far away from Paul. Meanwhile, Paul allays Gwen's suspicions about why he wants to help her and says that her best hope of a normal, safe life with her child is for her to leave town and never return. Gwen is torn about taking this extreme step and is also still very upset about the idea of claiming in court that she doesn't know who the baby's father is. She does, however, agree to think it all over. Meanwhile, Hal and Susan search the penthouse for clues to what may be upsetting Emily about Paul's recent behavior. They come across the wall safe that holds the baby footprints and Hal manages to crack it. Before they can look inside, Emily interrupts. Susan tries to cover why they're there and then leaves when Hal asks to speak to Emily alone. It seems Hal is making progress in getting Emily to open up about what's bothering her until Paul walks in and sees them standing together in front of the safe. Lily learns from Meg that Lucinda went on her trip alone and Lily's annoyed about being kept out of the loop. Meg shrugs it off and later goes to take Lucinda to chemo. Meanwhile, Lucinda receives very positive test results from her treatment at the Mexican clinic. Her good news prompts her to overlook any qualms about the illegal organ transplants connected to the clinic. When Meg arrives to pick her up, Lucinda says she's not going to have chemo and is taking another treatment route. She orders Meg not to tell anyone and despite Meg's arguments, Lucinda refuses to reconsider. Later, Lily and Keith arrive in time to hear Meg quit as Lucinda's nurse and Lily demands to know why. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "A special news report interrupted the last 30 minutes of the show so the short recap will be very short but here is what happened in the first half. Carly has a fight with Emily because Emily suggests that she give the baby back to Gwen. Paul offers to help Gwen get custody of the baby and pay for her education and living expenses if she leaves Oakdale forever. Lucinda is angry and decides never to return to Clinica de la vida but has second thoughts after she sees very good test results after one week of treatment at the clinic. Keith keeps his promise to Lucinda by persuading Lily not to ask Lucinda any more questions about where she went when she was supposed to be at the spa. Hal and Susan open Paul's safe and when Emily arrives home she decides to tell Hal what has been bothering her but Paul arrives home before Emily has a chance to tell Hal the truth about the baby switch.",
