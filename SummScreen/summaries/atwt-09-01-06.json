    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Tom and Margo's house, Tom has found out from one of the other parents that none of the teens' cell phones are working up at Raven Lake. Margo is still worried about Casey, but she doesn't want to drive up there to see how he is. Jessica goes to visit Tom and Margo, where Tom tells her that Maddie has been cleared in the slasher case because they found a new suspect: her brother-in-law, Louis, who raped her back in Chicago. Margo tells Jessica she's worried about Casey, and she says she wishes Maddie had had a chance to tell him that her name had been cleared. Margo says that Maddie lived with them so long, she began to think of her as the daughter she never had.  Margo wants Maddie to find healing after the ordeal she's been through, having been sexually assaulted, and Jessica reminds Margo that both of them are living proof that you can move past things like that.\n\n\nHenry goes to the police station, where Dallas and Jack are reviewing a list of possible sightings of Louis, anywhere from Oakdale to Mexico. Henry thanks Dallas for his part in helping Maddie; Dallas says he feels guilty that he didn't do more to prevent the killings. Jack asks Henry if he's spoken to Eve or Maddie since they went to Chicago; when he says no, Jack suggests he call to see how they are, and he tells Henry that he and Dallas think they should notify the Chicago police that Eve and Maddie are up there in case Louis decides to double back to Chicago. Henry reaches Eve on her cell phone, but the reception isn't good; Eve tells him she thought Maddie had stayed in Oakdale with him, which sends Henry into a panic. Dallas asks where Casey is, and Jack says he thinks he knows; he takes Henry, and they go to Tom and Margo's house. Meanwhile, Jessica comes to the station and talks to Dallas, who again puts a lot of blame on himself for not figuring everything out sooner, but Jessica tells him not to feel guilty, reminding him that he helped a young girl face her past and brought a family closer together. The phone rings at the station, and when Dallas answers it, it's bad news. Henry and Jack arrive at the Hughes's house and tell Tom and Margo that Maddie is probably out looking for Casey, and Louis could be following her. They tell Henry that Casey is at Raven Lake, but they can't reach anyone up there by phone, so Tom says he'll drive Margo and himself up there while Jack takes Henry with him, and he says they'll call the sheriff, too. Dallas comes rushing into the house, saying he's just gotten a call from Raven Lake, and kids are being killed up there.\n\n\nAt the lake, Gwen is being strangled from behind by the slasher, but Will comes to her rescue, knocking the slasher down, but not before Gwen has been stabbed in the leg. Will and Gwen manage to get to a gardener's shed, where they try to regroup. Gwen says whoever attacked her was taller than Maddie. Will finds matches and lights a lantern, then looks at Gwen's stab wound. He puts alcohol on it from a whiskey bottle he finds among the gardener's things, then improvises a bandage for her leg. She asks where he learned to do that, and he says his dad taught him. Gwen says, \"Don't you wish you could call your dad right now?\" and he agrees, but he tells her Hal is in Washington working on a case. When she asks when he'll be back, he says he's not sure, but he thinks his dad would approve of the bandage he's just made. Gwen thanks him, telling him that's twice he's saved her life, and she apologizes for the first time, when Casey and the police basically accused him of having attacked Gwen himself. She says she knew then that he couldn't be capable of something like that, yet she stood by silently, even though she'd promised him to always be there for him. She asks if he can forgive her, and he says of course, because he still loves her so much, and he just wishes everything could be different. He leans in to try to kiss her.\n\n\nElsewhere at the lake, Maddie bangs on the door to the bus, begging the other teens to let her on, but they drive away. Ian, one of the teens, says he's upset that leaving Maddie all alone means she'll probably get away before they can call the police; he thinks they should all go back to get her, but the others disagree. Maddie stumbles around, from body to body, looking for a safe place at Raven Lake; she hears a noise near the boat house, and it's Ian, who tells her he came back for her. He tells her she won't get away with killing his friends; Maddie insists she didn't kill anyone, but Ian attacks her with a boat paddle anyway. Maddie hides in the boat house, and Ian keeps looking for her. Maddie gets out of the boathouse, but after stumbling around in the dark some more, she comes across Ian, now stabbed to death like the others. Louis walks up to her, and Maddie runs, eventually coming across Casey's body. Maddie apologizes to Casey, telling him it's her fault he's dead; Louis comes up and grabs Maddie, who knees him and runs again. Louis catches her, and when she accuses him of all the killings he calls her a \"stupid girl,\" saying the 2 kids in Oakdale and the others at the lake were all stabbed by ... but then he is stabbed from behind by the slasher. Maddie screams.\n\n\n",
