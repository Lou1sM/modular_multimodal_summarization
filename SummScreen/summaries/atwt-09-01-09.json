Audrey said that she had slept like a log, so Henry asked if she had forgotten that they had James's lawyer bound and gagged in the boiler room.  Audrey preferred to think of Mr. Hanson as being in \"protective custody,\" because the words \"felonious kidnapping\" had a nasty ring to them.  She reminded her son that they only had to keep the lawyer captive until Henry's \"dear, sweet daddy\" croaked.\n\n\nHenry said that James had no visible expiration date, so there was no telling how long they would have to keep the lawyer sequestered.  Audrey offered to kill James, and she laughed at how uncomfortable that made Henry.  She was only kidding, but Henry was seriously disturbed that they might both end up in prison.  Outside the door, Vienna listened to their raised voices, as Audrey packed a bag with breakfast goodies for their captive.  Vienna dashed away just as the two emerged from the room.\n\n\nVienna hustled to Katie's house and made sure that Brad was not there.  Vienna told her best friend that she had overheard Henry telling Audrey that they could be arrested for kidnapping.  Vienna had no idea who the victim was, but she was horrified that the thought of James's millions had so corrupted her Henry.\n\n\nKatie tried to tell Vienna, in a nice way, that perhaps she had \"an inflated sense of Henry's moral fiber,\" because everyone knew that Henry adored money.  Vienna agonized that Henry would never trust her again because she had tipped off the police about where to find James.  She begged Katie to talk to Henry, so they went to the Lakeview.  They were surprised when Audrey and Henry exited the elevator, so Vienna grabbed Audrey to take her shopping, and Katie took Henry by the arm and escorted him to a table in the lounge.\n\n\nTom arrived at his father's hospital room and found Kim faithfully sitting by her husband's bed.  Bob had not regained consciousness, but the doctors had said that it could take a while.  Kim said that the neurosurgeon had removed the entire tumor, and  they were waiting to see if Bob had suffered any brain damage.  Tom blamed Alison again for not pointing out Bob's symptoms, but Kim said the girl had gone to all of the family, and no one would listen to her.  Kim asked Tom to let go of his feelings for Alison, but Tom said that he could not.\n\n\nTom did admit, however, that he and Margo were at loggerheads over Riley, who just didn't seem inclined to leave them alone.  Kim understood that Adam's death had hit Margo very hard, but Tom said that it was difficult for him, as well, and having Riley around was a constant reminder that Adam had died.  A tearful Kim urged Tom to go home and say some things to his wife before it was too late.  She looked at Bob and reminded Tom how precious life was.\n\n\nTom left, and Kim continued talking to Bob.  She told him it was time to wake up, and she began to cry.  She stood up to go outside and get herself under control, when Bob said, \"Don't go.  I need you, too.\"  Kim began to laugh with relief when he continued with, \"This place bores me silly.\"\n\n\nIn Java, Riley spoke with Alison, who was blaming herself for honoring Bob's wishes by not telling someone in authority that Dr. Hughes was endangering patients' lives.  They also talked about how obvious it was that Tom could not stand Riley.  Alison knew that Casey was keeping some sort of important secret from his dad, and she asked Riley if he knew what it was.  Riley evaded the question, but Alison continued that she had a feeling that something huge was about to happen.\n\n\nRiley admitted that there was something going on with the family, but he assured Alison that it had nothing to do with her. Alison thought about that and then replied that she loved Casey, so whatever concerned him also involved her.  Riley warned the girl to back off, or she would soon be \"collateral damage.\"  Alison asked Riley to tell her the secret, but still he refused.\n\n\nCasey found Margo scurrying around the kitchen on her way to work.  She said that she wanted to stop by the hospital first, but Casey said that Tom had grilled him about Riley at the hospital the day before.  It was killing Casey to have to lie to his dad, and he said that it was not fair to him or to Tom.  Finally, Casey gave him mother an ultimatum: either she would tell Tom that Riley was really Adam, or Casey would.  Margo said that it was not a good time to push Tom because of Bob's illness, but Casey was worried that his dad might suffer another heart attack.\n\n\nCasey stated that the longer they continued the lie, the worse it would be when the truth emerged.  Tom walked in on the serious conversation, and he asked if anyone was going to tell him what was going on.  He said that he felt like an outsider in his own home, and he wanted it to stop.  Tom looked at Margo and said that he felt as if something had  come between them, and he was also afraid that Casey no longer trusted him.  Casey complained that he was in the lousy position of having to choose between his two parents.\n\n\nMargo was upset, and she asked Casey to give her some privacy with Tom.  She promised that she would tell the truth, all of it, so Casey walked out.  Margo told Tom that, first of all, there was no blame attached to Casey.  Everything had been her idea.  She continued that there had always been a connection between her and Riley, but not the one that Tom had suspected.  Finally, Margo said, \"Riley is my son.  Riley is Adam.\"\n\n\nTom laughed, but Margo quickly explained that the bomb in Afghanistan had blown off most of Adam's face, but Riley was really Adam.  The real Riley Morgan had died in the bomb blast, while Adam suffered through dozens of painful surgeries to restore his face.  When Adam realized that he looked so different, he felt as if he had been given a second chance.  He took advantage of a new start and declared Adam Munson dead and claimed to be Riley Morgan.\n\n\nTom was confused how stealing a war hero's identity and lying to his family was any kind of change from the kind of man Adam had been originally.  To him, it was his son's usual behavior. Margo shouted that their son had made amends for his former life, but Tom could not see it.  Margo couldn't understand why Tom did not see what she did, and she had not realized that Tom would be so angry.  Tom was furious that Margo had put Casey in such a terrible position, and he snarled at his wife that \"Casey did his time.\"  He was also hurt that Margo had felt that she could not trust Tom with the family secret.\n\n\nTom answered his phone, and the caller was Kim, telling him that Bob was awake and talking.  Tom prepared to leave immediately for the hospital, but he told Margo that he wanted to go alone.  His parting words to her were \"I can't bear to look at you right now.\"\n\n\nCasey went to Java and told Riley that Margo was telling Tom the truth that very moment.  Riley blamed Casey, who was relieved that they no longer had to live a lie.  Alison was confused and asked what was going on.  Riley spoke up that his name was not really Riley Morgan.  When he told the girl that he was Adam, Alison's comment was that he was \"so not what you were.\" She talked about his many transgressions, including the attempted rape of Gwen Munson, and Adam agreed that he had been a \"low-life coward.\" He explained about his facial surgeries, and Alison was freaked out by the revelation that a good friend was really a despicable person.  She hastily left, and Casey followed.\n\n\nAt Fashions, Audrey's mind was not on dresses.  She turned back all the dresses that Vienna had wanted her to try on, and she spotted the key to the dressing rooms on the counter.  She grabbed a dress and urged Vienna to try it on, and when Vienna went into the dressing room, Audrey locked the door, put the key in her purse, and walked out.  Vienna tried to open the door and began shouting for Audrey.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Katie chatted with Henry in the lounge.  She told him that Vienna felt that the Stenbeck money had turned him into a different person.  Henry said that he planned to sign over all the money to his mother, but Vienna was still worried.  Katie saw no problem if Henry kept his word, and she left the lounge.   Henry scooped up rolls from the table and stuffed them into a napkin.  He walked through the lobby where Katie was hiding, and she followed him through the door to the boiler room.\n\n\nHenry was shocked to find no lawyer trussed up in the boiler room.  He spoke out loud that he and his mother were \"toast,\" just as Katie popped out from behind the furnace and agreed with him.  Henry explained why he and Audrey had snatched James's lawyer, but Katie thought they were crazy.  Henry said that he had warned Katie what would happen if he let his mother invade his life again.  Katie hurried him out of the boiler room, as Henry got more and more wound up.\n\n\nA steaming mad Vienna met them in the lobby and asked if they had seen Audrey.  She told them about the dressing room incident, and Katie pressured Henry to admit that he was in big trouble.  Vienna listened to the tale of the kidnapping, and Henry's phone rang.  It was Audrey, who asked if Henry was alone.  When he said that he was with Katie and Vienna, Audrey ordered him to \"ditch the broad squad\" and get up to her room. Vienna wanted to go and give Audrey a piece of her mind, but Henry refused to let her.  He was determined to stand up to his mother.\n\n\nHenry pounded on Audrey's door, and she quickly pulled him into the room.  Henry hysterically described his fate in the \"big house\" if he had to share a cell with his mother.  He said that he would take the drawstring out of his polyester pants and hang himself.  Audrey motioned him over to a laundry basket, which contained a very alive, but angry, gagged, and bound, lawyer.  Audrey said the plan was to keep Hanson alive until James died.  The only hitch was that nature might not run its course \"in a timely fashion.\"  The bottom line was that Henry was going to have to kill his father.\n\n\nMargo rushed into Java and was thankful that she had found Adam before Tom did.  She said they needed to \"fix it\" before something terrible happened.  Adam was relieved that he no longer had to lie about who he was, but he knew that his father would report his return to the authorities.  Margo said they had to change Tom's mind, but Adam said that he needed to live up to what was expected of him, or else there was no point in his return.  Margo begged her son to make his father understand.\n\n\nAlison and Casey went to the roof of Memorial, and she felt used and betrayed by Adam.  She had really liked Riley, and had shared a lot of her thoughts with him.  She and Casey hugged and talked about keeping secrets.  Alison realized what Adam had been talking about when he mentioned \"collateral damage.\"\n\n\nAdam went to the hospital to see how his grandfather was doing.  He ran into Tom in the hall outside Bob's room.  Tom was bitter and unfriendly, and he criticized Adam for knowing before the rest of the family that his grandfather was sick, but doing nothing about it.  His words expressed how little he believed that Adam had changed , and he said that he was going to have his son arrested and thrown into prison.  He said the word \"son\" with a great deal of sarcasm.  Margo walked up and overheard that last comment.  She reminded her husband that she knew of Adam's identity and had broken the law by not telling, and that Casey would have years tacked on to his parole.\n\n\nMargo stepped back and asked Tom if he was going to send his whole family to prison. Adam said that he was willing to face any consequences he had to, but he didn't want Margo and Casey to suffer.  Margo was determined not to lose her boys, and she begged Tom to reconsider.  Tom said he could not even recognize his wife any more.  He went into Bob's room, as Adam told Margo that he never should have returned.\n\n\n",
