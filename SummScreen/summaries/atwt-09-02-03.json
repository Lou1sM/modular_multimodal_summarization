Paul is sold for $5,000 to Rosanna, Walker is sold to Nancy Hughes, Henry is sold to Lucinda for $10,000, Aaron is sold to Jen's friend Connie for $1,000 and Chris is sold for $1,000 by a woman hidden behind a large black hat.  It turns out to be Emily who did it as a gift for Alison who only had $487.26.\n\n\nPaul and Rosanna decide to go out for coffee, Nancy tells Walker that she wants to take him out to thank him for helping Bob, Henry hides from Lucinda, even telling Alison he won't be home that night, Aaron goes to the Lakeview with Connie, and Chris and Alison decide to go back to the cottage.\n\n\nAaron feels a little uncomfortable at the Lakeview seeing Lucy having dinner with her tutor.  Connie gives her opinion and tells Aaron that he can't compete and that he could lose Lucy when she goes to college.  Aaron says he needs a new job.\n\n\nAlison and Chris go to the cottage where Chris lights candles for their romantic evening.  It is sweet, touching and both seem to be very much in the moment.\n\n\nMolly goes to Java Underground looking for Dusty but only finds Craig.  She tells him what happened with Carly and he tells her what happened with his recent arrest and the adoption.  Molly comes up with an idea - for Craig to suggest getting a surrogate to have a baby with them.  She says there are so many problems with it that they'll probably never get the baby and then Rosanna can't blame Craig for it.  With a smile, Craig says, \"That's diabolical Molly.\"\n\n\nPaul and Rosanna's date is cut short by a phone call.  Later, Rosanna goes home but Craig already knows that she was with Paul because Rose told him earlier at Java Underground.  Rosanna decides not to tell him and she is still angry with him about the arrest.\n\n\nJen and Dusty go to the penthouse where she continues to try to seduce him.  They kiss and then Dusty stops saying he doesn't want to take advantage of a drunk woman or even a woman that is pretending to be drunk.  Dusty is convinced that Jen called the police on him but she just tells him that she wants him.  He says he can't believe that Paul would \"pimp out\" his sister.  Jen slaps him but still tries to seduce him.  Then, Paul walks in and Dusty leaves.  Paul asks if Dusty threatened her and Jen says no she has him exactly where she wants him.  Paul is concerned and although he tries not to run her life, he tells her to leave things alone.\n\n\nAfter the benefit, Rose goes to Java Underground and waits for Dusty.  She tells him that she can smell Jen's perfume on him. Dusty denies it and tells Rose to go home with him.  He reaches out for her hand, but she pulls away.   \n\n\n",
