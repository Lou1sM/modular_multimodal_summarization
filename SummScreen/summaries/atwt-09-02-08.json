Getting no response from Leo, Brad began CPR and unsuccessfully tried to call for help on his wet cell phone. He ran to a public phone and called 9-1-1 anonymously, and then ran back to continue the CPR. When Brad heard the EMTs arriving, he hid behind some trees and let the medics do their work. \n\n\nJames offered Paul a drink, which his son refused. Paul accused his father of stealing Barbara's money and then playing games with him. Meanwhile Barbara realized that the driver of her limo was Derek Coburn, who wanted her to deliver a message to Paul so that he would take the loan shark's threats more seriously. Barbara called Paul, who asked to speak to Derek and told him to let his mother go if he wanted his money back. Paul then ordered James out of Fairwinds. \n\n\nAt her house, Liberty agonized about whether to call Parker. At Carly's, Parker was upset that he had not heard from Liberty. Each felt responsible for ruining their relationship. Janet showed up at Carly's with a basket of fruit and was surprised to find Jack there. He was unforgiving with her and told her he would be staying with his family that night. After Janet left, Carly accused Jack of being judgmental with someone other than herself, and Jack tried to explain why he felt justified in being disappointed in Janet. Carly suggested he lighten up on Janet, who was primarily trying to protect her child. Jack finally had to admit that Carly was \"100% right,\" difficult words for Jack to utter to his ex-wife. The two of them decided they had actually found one of the rare perks of divorce. Jack got a call from Dallas, who told him that Leo was in custody in Memorial Hospital, so Jack left immediately. At the hospital, Dallas further informed Jack that the boy was in a coma and could not be questioned. \n\n\nPaul went to Lucinda, prepared to sell Worldwide back to her for cash. She asked him how dumb he thought she was, and proceeded to turn him down. She then realized that Paul was desperate for cash and told him to get himself out of his own mess. \n\n\nBarbara went to Fairwinds looking for Paul, but instead, she was stunned to find James Stenbeck in residence there. She was hostile to him and refused to share a drink with him. She told her ex-husband that she had substituted chemotherapy for drink, and James complimented her on how well she looked and how she had handled her cancer. Barbara told him that next to cancer, James was nothing. He mentioned how quickly one's fortunes could change, and Barbara realized that James was behind her missing money. Paul returned, and James suggested that they let him help with the money solution. Despite his mother's stern warnings, Paul asked what exactly James was offering. Paul was out of time, and he had to get Derek Coburn away from his family. James handed Paul a map, which showed where Barbara's money was hidden: under the Snyder construction site. \n\n\nJanet went to Brad and Katie's and checked in with Liberty, who was still worried about Parker. Janet sang her daughter a song from her childhood until the girl got drowsy. Brad came home and Janet inquired as to why he was soaking wet, but Brad was reluctant to give any details. Katie came home as well, and before long, Jack arrived looking for his brother. \n\n\nJack announced that Leo was in a coma and told them an anonymous person had summoned help for the boy. Jack asked Brad if he had gone looking for Leo, and Brad lied and denied it. Jack asked a few more questions and then left, followed by Janet. When they were alone, Katie questioned Brad about his lying, and he admitted that he had pushed Leo, but had also gotten the EMTS there. Katie was horrified and told Brad he must confess everything to Jack, but Brad was afraid. He urged Katie not to tell anyone and then said he needed time alone and walked out. \n\n\nParker told Carly that he was having flashbacks to the time of Sam's murder and how it never seemed to be finally over. His mother reassured him that the nightmare with Liberty and the rape was, indeed, finished. He got a call then from Liberty, and the two had a good talk. Carly went to Memorial and talked with Dallas, who told her they were waiting for Leo to wake up. She spotted Brad sneaking into the boy's room and heard Brad apologize to the unconscious teen. \n\n\nJack found Janet gathering up her Italian spices from Emma's kitchen. He also noticed that Janet had her suitcase packed and waiting. When Jack questioned her, she announced she was moving out. Jack asked her to stay and said he still wanted the two of them to be together. Janet, however, had realized how easy it was for her to let Jack down, and she walked upstairs to get the last of her things. \n\n\nKatie surprised Jack at the farm and told him she knew how Leo had been hurt. She begged him to understand that Brad had only wanted to scare the boy, not injure him. She told Jack she had urged Brad to confess to Jack, and asked for Jack's help. Janet walked in and said she had overheard their discussion. She told Katie that it would be terrible if Brad confessed, because that would mean that the police would take Liberty's father away when she was just getting to know him.\n\n\n",
