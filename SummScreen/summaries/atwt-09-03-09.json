Rosanna said she thought Craig was too busy canoodling with his \"Oakdale Lolita\" to get any work done. Parker arrived downstairs, and Craig said that the ad agency wanted them all to attend a meeting to discuss some new ideas. Parker said that he didn't want to go, because he had heard them fighting, and he didn't want any part of it.\n\n\nCraig told Parker that they had to put aside their differences to do a good job for Midday Sun and Carly. Parker said it didn't appear as though Rosanna and Craig were going to be able to do that, and he didn't want to be in the middle of it. Craig said Parker didn't need to be in the middle, unless someone had already put him there.\n\n\nRosanna pointed out that Craig had used Parker as a cover once already, when Craig had told Rosanna about the mythical photo shoot that Parker knew nothing about. Parker said that it didn't matter, anyway, because he had promised Liberty that he would accompany her to a college fair at school. Parker walked out.\n\n\nCraig asked Rosanna, \"Is there anyone you aren't trying to turn against me?\" Craig then asked Rosanna if she had told Parker her \"paranoid fantasy\" about him and Teri. Rosanna said that she had, although not in detail. Craig was upset, because he was engaged to Carly, and Rosanna said she would be sure that Carly heard every detail.\n\n\nCraig pointed out that Carly's recovery wouldn't be helped by Rosanna's baseless accusations, and he reiterated that he wasn't sleeping with Teri, Teri wasn't pregnant, and that was the way they both wanted to keep it. When Rosanna said that she didn't believe Craig, Craig told her that she needed to move beyond the past. Rosanna agreed with Craig, but said the best way for her to do that was to get rid of him.\n\n\nAt the farm, Janet found Liberty in the kitchen and reminded her that there was a college fair at school. Liberty said she didn't think she was ready for something like that. Janet wondered what Liberty meant, since Liberty had practically begged her to let her to go Chicago with Mackenzie to check out colleges. Liberty said it was a lot to think about, and Janet hugged her and told her she'd do fine.\n\n\nTeri arrived, suitcase in hand, and asked Janet if there was any room for her at the farm, because Rosanna had fired her. Janet was shocked and asked why, but Teri said she didn't really know. Liberty left for school. Teri then told Janet that she thought Rosanna had fired her because the kids were back in school and busy with their lives, so Rosanna didn't need her as much.\n\n\nJanet pointed out that Teri still had a job at Metro, and Teri said that she thought Craig would be able to help her keep that job. Janet asked if Teri believed Craig. Teri said yes, and she reminded her sister that they had agreed not to fight about Craig. Janet then said that if Teri wasn't working, they could spend more time getting to know each other again. Teri told Janet that she thought Janet had done a great job with Liberty. Janet remarked that she and Liberty were very close and had always shared everything.\n\n\nLiberty went to Java. Parker walked in and saw her; he asked if she was ready to leave, and Liberty asked what he meant. Parker reminded her that they were supposed to go to the college fair at school together, but Liberty wasn't enthusiastic.\n\n\nTony walked in with some friends, talking about getting into a good fraternity at college; when he spotted Liberty, his expression changed, and he told his friends they should go somewhere else, because the coffee wasn't good at Java. Tony and the other guys left, and Parker asked Liberty if she was ready to leave. Liberty told Parker to leave without her, and said she would meet him there later. Parker told Liberty that he couldn't help her if she didn't talk to him, but he got up and left.\n\n\nLiberty called Teri and said that she had gotten another appointment at the clinic for that afternoon. Liberty asked if Teri could still accompany her, and Teri said of course. Liberty told Teri where she was, and they hung up. Teri told Janet that she had to leave to see about a possible job interview. Teri told her sister that she loved her, and she walked out.\n\n\nTeri found Liberty at Java and asked if she was sure she wanted to have the abortion. Liberty said she wanted to be able to think about college, not about a baby. Teri then called Craig and told him about Liberty's new appointment. Craig said he would meet them, and he hung up and told Rosanna that he had to leave. Rosanna asked what was so urgent, but Craig told her it was personal.\n\n\nCraig met Teri and Liberty in Old Town. He asked Liberty if she was sure about what she was doing, and Liberty said yes, then asked if they could just leave. As they left, Parker appeared, watching them. Parker sat down on a bench, and Janet walked by. Janet asked Parker why he wasn't at the college fair with Liberty, and he lied, saying that he'd been there, but Liberty was looking at more colleges, and he hadn't wanted to wait for her to finish.\n\n\nJanet didn't believe him and got him to admit that he wasn't sure Liberty had ever gone to the college fair. Parker told Janet that something was bugging Liberty, but he didn't know what it was. He then confessed that he had covered for Liberty a few days before when he had said that Liberty had been with him. He then told Janet that he'd seen Liberty leave with Craig and Teri, but they hadn't seen him, and he didn't know where they were going.\n\n\nJanet went to Carly's house and asked Rosanna if she knew where Liberty, Teri, and Craig had gone. Rosanna said she didn't, but Janet got Rosanna to admit that she suspected something. Rosanna told Janet that the day Janet had thought that Liberty had gone to Chicago to look at colleges, Rosanna had found Teri and Craig together in a hotel room. Janet asked why they would have taken Liberty with them, and Rosanna suggested that it was for cover. Janet found that unlikely, but Rosanna told her that she thought that Teri was pregnant.\n\n\nRosanna also told Janet about the abortion clinic literature she had seen at the hotel. Janet was convinced that her sister would never have an abortion, because of the way they'd been raised. Janet wondered whether Craig might be forcing Teri to have an abortion, because he didn't want Carly to find out he'd gotten Janet's sister pregnant. Janet asked Rosanna which hotel she'd seen Craig and Teri at in Chicago.\n\n\nAt the health clinic, the nurse told Liberty that they were ready for her. Teri asked how long it would take, and the nurse said that Liberty would be ready to leave in a couple of hours. Teri again asked Liberty if she was having any second thoughts, but Liberty insisted she couldn't have a baby at her age. Liberty then asked Craig and Teri if they could wait for her elsewhere.\n\n\nCraig and Teri went back to the hotel where they had stayed before, to wait until it was time to pick up Liberty. Teri told Craig that she thought he'd been pretty amazing dealing with Liberty. Craig said that when a person had messed up as many lives as he had, it felt good to help someone solve their problems.\n\n\nThere was a knock on the door, and Craig answered it. Janet and Rosanna came in, and Janet rushed to hug her sister, telling Teri that she knew the whole story and was going to help her. When Teri asked what Janet meant, Janet said that she knew that Teri had been sleeping with Craig and was pregnant.\n\n\nTeri told Janet and Rosanna that Janet was wrong. She said she wasn't pregnant, and that she had never slept with Craig. Janet asked why there had been a brochure from an abortion clinic, and then it dawned on her, and she began yelling for Liberty. Craig told Janet, \"She's not here.\"\n\n\nJanet demanded that either Craig or Teri tell her where Liberty was. Teri said she couldn't, so Rosanna told Craig to tell Janet. Craig informed Janet of the clinic's location, and Janet stormed out of the hotel room. Meanwhile, at the clinic, the doctor prepared an injection for Liberty and told her to keep taking deep breaths.\n\n\nKatie met Vienna in the lobby of the Lakeview Hotel. Vienna told Katie that Henry hadn't been arrested yet, and that Henry thought that meant that James's lawyer, Mr. Hansen, had decided not to talk, perhaps because James had asked him to keep quiet about the kidnapping.\n\n\nHenry went to Audrey's room, where Hansen was still tied up, with duct tape across his mouth. Henry and Audrey heard the lawyer's cell phone ringing. Henry found it in the man's jacket pocket and saw that it was James calling. Henry listened to the message James had left about needing to sign the revised will in order to leave all the money to Paul.\n\n\nAudrey asked Henry if he was ready to do what needed to be done. Henry said he might be a Stenbeck, but he wasn't a killer. Audrey thought that he could be, and she said that by not killing James, Henry would be killing both himself and her, because James would kill them both if he found out what they'd done.\n\n\nHenry wanted to know what his mother thought the lawyer would do if Henry killed James, but Audrey said the lawyer would keep his mouth shut for $250,000. Henry wondered how Audrey thought they could get that kind of money, and Audrey said it was obvious that they would get the money after they killed James. Henry asked why Audrey thought she could trust the lawyer; she pulled the duct tape off of his mouth, and he said that for $250,000, they could kill his own father. Henry, however, told his mother that if she wanted James dead, she would have to kill him herself, and he left.\n\n\nHenry went downstairs, where he found Vienna waiting for him. Henry told Vienna that he had been talking to Audrey. He assured Vienna that he had told Audrey that he didn't want anything more to do with her or her plans, but he also told Vienna that Audrey had the lawyer bound and gagged in her room.\n\n\nVienna was shocked, but told Henry that he had to tell the police. Henry said he couldn't do that, because Audrey would somehow get away with it and blame him for the whole thing. Vienna said the police would find out the truth when Audrey set the lawyer free, but Henry told Vienna that Audrey had bribed the man. Henry said the only thing they could do was leave the country.\n\n\nVienna asked Henry if they had to leave right away, and he said yes. She then asked if there was time for them to make one more happy memory in Oakdale, and seeing what Vienna had in mind, Henry agreed that there was time for that.\n\n\nAudrey went to Oakdale Memorial Hospital and began looking through a drawer in an unlocked drug cart. Katie walked by and called out to Audrey. Audrey turned and complimented Katie on the beautiful glow she had, and Katie thanked her. Katie then asked what Audrey had been looking for, and Audrey lied and said she had a stomachache and was trying to find an antacid. Katie suggested that Audrey ask a nurse or go to the pharmacy, and Audrey said she would try the pharmacy.\n\n\nKatie left, and Audrey went back to the drug cart. This time, she withdrew a syringe and a vial of medicine before walking away. Later, Katie walked by the drug cart and overheard two nurses talking about a missing vial of potassium chloride.\n\n\nKatie went to the Lakeview and knocked on Henry and Vienna's door. When they let her in, she told them what she'd seen at the hospital. Henry realized that meant that Audrey was going to kill James. Vienna and Katie wanted Henry to call the police to alert them about a potential murder, but Henry said that Audrey would be doing a \"public service\" if she killed James Stenbeck. Katie and told Henry that she couldn't believe he would do something as despicable as allow a murder to occur. Vienna reminded Henry that Audrey would probably find a way to blame him for the murder, too. Henry agreed, but said that there were other considerations. Vienna asked whether he meant the money, and Henry said yes.\n\n\nAudrey went to the police station to see James. She told him that she had a treat for him, since the food at the police station was probably getting pretty old. She took out a dark chocolate cupcake and placed it before him, but James said he wanted Audrey to take the first bite. Audrey acted hurt that James didn't trust her, and she said she would never do anything to hurt him.\n\n\nJames asked if his changing the will might prompt Audrey to want to hurt him, but Audrey swore she didn't care about James's money. To prove it, Audrey took the first bite out of the cupcake. James was pleased by Audrey's actions. Audrey sat on his lap and cuddled with him and said that she would make his last hours pleasant. When Audrey promised that it wouldn't hurt one bit, James looked concerned and asked what she meant, as Audrey raised the syringe to plunge it into the back of his neck.\n\n\n",
