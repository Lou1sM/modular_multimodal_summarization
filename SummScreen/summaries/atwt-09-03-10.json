Henry and Barbara arrived to offer their support, and after Barbara took Kim to the waiting room, Henry was surprised to learn from Luke that Katie wasn't at the hospital.\n\n\nSitting by Brad's grave, Katie sobbed, confessing her love for Chris. Though it was different from her love for Brad, it was real. Katie asked Brad to help her muster the strength to be there for Chris, because she was a coward. \"The hell you are,\" Henry said from behind her.\n\n\n       Katie asserted that instead of being with the man she loved, she was talking to stone. Henry confided that he did it all the time. He'd even passed out beside the grave after \"drinking with Brad\" one night. Henry thought it took more courage to keep Brad alive in her heart than to blot his memory from her mind.\n\n\nKatie sobbed to think of having to let Chris go, too. Henry explained that Brad's love was still with her, and Chris's would be, too. People died, but the only way to escape mourning was to lock oneself away. Henry said that they weren't getting weaker and more afraid; they were getting stronger and braver. Katie asked Henry to take her to the hospital.\n\n\n       Back in Chris' room, a groggy Chris asked what had happened. John, Reid, and Bob explained that they'd revived him after a cardiac arrest. Bob decided to have Chris moved up on the transplant list, and John suggested installing an LVAD (left ventricle assist device) to help Chris' heart pump. \"No way. Forget about it,\" Chris responded. He refused to die while hooked up to a machine.\n\n\n       John and Bob believed that Chris was a good candidate for a new heart, but Chris replied that if he were any other patient, they'd tell him that there were no guarantees. Reid stated that Chris wasn't just another patient, and if they didn't keep him alive, the heart search would be meaningless. Chris stated that Katie deserved a man who'd enrich her life, not one who'd be hooked up to a machine. \"No machines. I'm not gonna do it,\" he concluded.\n\n\n       Kim and Barbara entered, and Bob explained that Chris was refusing a life-prolonging treatment. \"Christopher, is that true?\" Kim asked in a motherly tone. Chris refused to allow Kim and Katie to watch him waste away. He didn't want to be remembered that way, either. Kim demanded that he stop thinking about dying and start thinking about living. Barbara implored him to do it for his parents. Entering with Henry, Katie asked if Chris wanted her opinion.\n\n\n       \"How dare you sacrifice yourself for me! You think I can't handle you being a little sick?\" Katie asked. She said that Chris had three capable doctors, and he needed to listen to them, so that she and Chris could have as much time together as possible. Katie felt that he wasn't nearly sick enough to give up the fight, and doing so would be cowardly.\n\n\nChris uttered that his heart was giving out, and he might not get another one. Katie told him that they'd deal with that, if it happened. She implored him to at least try, because she and Jacob needed him. \"Nobody who loves you wants to be spared,\" she said.\n\n\n       Pledging her support, Katie imagined that they'd take Tango lessons after Chris recovered, and they'd give Barbara and Henry a run for their money on the dance floor. She said they'd build a meaningful life together, and Chris wouldn't want to miss a moment of it. Chris thanked Katie for reminding him of what he had to fight for, and he agreed to the treatment.\n\n\n       In the corridor later, Bob called Tom to ask about the heart that had become available in Bay City. Aside, Barbara figured that Katie would need Henry, and Barbara promised that they'd dance rings around Chris and Katie once Chris recovered.\n\n\n       In Chris's room, Kim hugged Katie and thanked her for knowing what to say. Barbara, Henry, and Bob returned, and Bob announced that a heart had become available.\n\n\n       At Al's Diner, Alison suggested a wedding in Las Vegas, and Casey figured that she was ashamed of what had happened at the last wedding. Glancing at Nancy's ring, he said he believed in them, just as Nancy had. Alison insisted that she'd had the big wedding already. It had been a disaster, and she wanted something completely different the next time. Casey gave in, because the only thing that mattered to him was having her as his wife.\n\n\n       Luke entered, and they noticed that he looked troubled. Luke gave the couple the bad news about Chris, and Casey realized that he needed to get to the hospital. He asked Alison to join him, because it was her family, too.\n\n\n       When Casey, Alison, and Luke arrived at Memorial, Reid told them about the heart match for Chris. Alison and Casey went into Chris's room, and Reid told Luke that the timing was perfect, because Chris wouldn't have lasted much longer. Reid tried to be nonchalant about the heart news, but Luke got him to admit that it was incredible.\n\n\n       As they waited for the heart, Henry drank coffee to prepare himself for the long night of surgery. Barbara guessed that he'd convinced Katie to be at the hospital, and he said that Barbara had married a wonderful guy. She agreed, hugging her husband.\n\n\nBob asked Alison to scrub up for surgery, because he wanted his best people in the operating room. Kim noticed Nancy's ring on Alison's finger, and Casey and Alison explained that they hadn't found the right time to announce their engagement news. An elated Kim advised them not to hide their joy, if they were ready to be married. Casey stated that they were more than ready, and with hugs, Bob and Kim welcomed Alison into the family.\n\n\nWatching the foursome, Luke told Reid that things were looking better. \"It ain't over till the nurse in pediatrics sings,\" Reid replied. The couple spotted John on the phone and saw him grimace. John headed back to Chris's room, and they followed. John told the family that Chris and the heart were a perfect match; however, a young cardiologist at the Bay City hospital had taken the heart for one of his own patients.\n\n\nChris figured that they'd fall back on the LVAD plan. Katie said she wanted to check on Jacob, but when she left the room, she went to the lounge to cry. Barbara followed her, but Katie didn't want to have a pep talk. Barbara said things didn't always turn out well, but Chris had a lot of support. Barbara realized that she never would have survived her warehouse ordeal without all the people who'd been fighting for her return. Katie said that Henry had been relentless in finding Barbara, and Barbara replied that it was Katie's time to be relentless for Chris.\n\n\nBack in Chris's room, Chris asked to talk to Reid alone. Chris congratulated the new chief of staff. \"Oh, shut up. You know I don't want the job that way,\" Reid said. Reid admitted that he'd stolen a medical grant from Chris once, but he planned to beat Chris for the hospital job fair and square once Chris recovered. \"Take care of Katie for me,\" Chris uttered.\n\n\nKatie entered, and Reid went into the hallway. He watched Chris and Katie from the viewing window. After a long look at Chris's loved ones, Reid strode to his locker. Luke asked what Reid was doing, and Reid replied that he was driving to Bay City to get the heart that rightfully belonged to Chris.\n\n\nLuke said that even Dr. Reid Oliver couldn't walk into some hospital, toss a heart into a cooler, and walk away. \"Watch me,\" Reid replied and raged about the arrogant doctor who'd stolen Chris's heart. Luke replied that he'd once known the same kind of doctor, and Reid rhetorically wondered what had happened to that doctor.\n\n\nIn the parking lot, Luke tried to go with Reid, but Reid insisted upon handling it alone. Luke got Reid to admit that he wasn't merely upset about the pompous doctor in Bay City. Reid confessed that he wanted to get the heart for Bob, Kim, and Katie. Reid warned that he was still the same jerk he'd always been; he just couldn't pass up the opportunity to throw his weight around-especially when he had a good cause.\n\n\nReid asked Luke not to tell anyone about the trip. Before he got into his car, Reid turned and said, \"I love you. There I said it.\" The men kissed, and Reid drove away.\n\n\nAfter Reid left, John told the Hughes family that Chris's heart wasn't strong enough for the LVAD procedure. John said they needed a new heart right away. Luke returned, and Casey told him the news. Luke said they wouldn't need the procedure because Reid had a plan. Luke confided in Casey and Alison that Reid had gone to Bay City for the heart. Casey wondered if Reid could just take the organ. Luke doubted it, but he'd never seen Reid not get his way.\n\n\nIn the car, Reid argued with the Bay City cardiologist on the phone. He said he'd be there in ten minutes, and he warned the doctor not to release the heart to someone else. As he drove, Reid tried to speed over a train crossing, but his car stalled on the tracks. An oncoming train roared, and Reid tussled with his seatbelt. He reached for his door latch, and he froze, locking his eyes on the train.\n \n\n\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "It's a heartbreaking day for the Hughes family and Katie as Chris's condition gets worse. John considers putting Chris on an IVAD machine to keep his heart pumping until they can find a donor heart, but Chris refuses to have the operation to install the machine. Henry finds Katie at Brad's grave and persuades her that she is strong enough to help Chris fight for his life, because when you truly love someone, you risk sadness just to be happy with the person you love. Katie rushes to the hospital with Henry and persuades Chris to have the operation and fight for their future. A heart is found for Chris in Bay City but John is later informed that the head of Cardiology at the Bay City hospital took the heart for his patient. Chris asks Reid to take care of Katie if anything should happen to him. Luke and Reid have a long talk and Luke gets Reid to admit that he cares about Chris and the Hughes family. He can't watch Katie lose another man she loves because he cares about her too. Reid is determined to go to Bay City and claim the heart for Chris, and he refuses Luke's offer to go with him to make sure he doesn't lose his cool. Reid tells Luke he loves him and they kiss before Reid heads to Bay City. Reid talks to the cardiologist on the phone to tell him not to put the heart in his patient, because he will be there in ten minutes to talk to him. Reid tries to make it to the train that is coming, but when he hits the accelerator, his car stalls. He tries to untie his shoelace from the accelerator, but he doesn't have enough time and all he can do is watch as the train heads towards his car.",
