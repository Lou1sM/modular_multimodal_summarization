He told Jack that Carly moved out.  He said, \"a good looking woman like that, probably found a sugar daddy.\"  Jack immediately thought of Craig and stormed out.\n\n\nLakeview Hotel Lounge:\n\nCraig wanted to know what Cass meant when he said that there was trouble with the WorldWide Stock.  Cass said that Craig bought the stock in his name, but that he used BRO money, so Paul and Barbara arranged for a meeting with a judge.  Craig couldn't see how a judge could side with Barbara after she lied in court.  Cass reminded him that this was civil court and it was a whole new ball game.  Cass said the law might be on her side.  Craig asked if Cass knew Rose.  Cass said that he had met her.  Craig said that Paul was clue less and Barbara wasn't thinking clearly since the accident.  He was sure that this all came up at the suggestion of Rose and Lucinda.  He said if they want to fight, then he'll give them a fight.\n\n\nCraig was on the phone when Jack walked in and wanted to know where Carly was.  He asked if Carly was upstairs.  They argued about Carly.  Craig was surprised that Jack didn't know that Carly left town.  He was only too happy to tell Jack that Carly wasn't upstairs in his room, that she moved to Chicago.  He said that he assumed that she told Jack when she told him about her leaving.  Jack asked why she left for Chicago.  Craig said she left because of him.  Craig asked why he was arguing with him, that if Carly really meant anything to him, he would be half way to Chicago by now.  Craig and Jack continued to argue then he told Jack that he'd give a lot for Carly to want him like she wanted Jack.  He said he tired to get Carly to want him, but Carly only wants Jack.  \n\n\nJack was talking to someone on the phone that he asked to tail Carly.  He was happy that Carly hadn't noticed that she was being followed.  He thanked who ever he was talking to and said to himself \"Carly hang on, I'm on my way.\"\n\n\nBryant & Jennifer's Cottage:\n\nBryant walked in as Billy and Jennifer were talking.  Bryant asked if she met his cousin.  She said yes that he was there when she got home.  She left the room and the cousins hugged and made small talk.  Bryant questioned him about being so close to Jennifer when he walked in.  Billy said she was crying and he was trying to console her.  Jennifer walked back in the living room and Bryant asked if she was OK.  He said that Billy told him that she was upset.  She said she was looking for him but she couldn't find him.  He told her he was at the Lakeview talking to his dad.  Jennifer didn't like that and was sarcastic to him about doing what ever Craig wanted.  Bryant wanted to know what was going on with her to get her so upset.  She didn't want to talk.  Billy told Bryant that he was going to leave to give him and Jennifer some time to talk.\n\n\nBryant told Jennifer he wasn't going to apologize because he talked to Craig, but that he was there to listen to her now.  She didn't want to talk.  He said it's not working between them and if she isn't confiding in him, that maybe they need to rethink their situation.  He told her that maybe they should call it quits.  She asked him if he wanted her to move out.  He said no, he wanted her to stay, but he wanted them to talk to each other.  She said she wanted to talk about her problem but every time she thinks about it, she starts to cry.  He wanted to know what happened that day.  She said she saw her Mom and then put her head on his shoulder and he hugged her.  They started kissing when Craig knocked at the door.   Jennifer wasn't happy about that.  \n\n\nBryant told Craig he should have called first.  Craig said he would have called but it was urgent.  He said he has some assets that needed protection and he wanted to put them with his trust fund for safe keeping temporarily.  Jennifer wanted to know \"what trust fund.\"  Bryant told her they'd talk about it later.  She told Craig that Bryant knew that trust fund was blood money from her mom and he wouldn't touch it.  Craig apologized and said he thought that Jennifer knew.  Bryant asked Craig to leave.  \n\n\nAs Craig walked out, he ran into Billy.  The made small talk and then Craig asked him to come for dinner the next week and ask Bryant to come with him.  Billy thought it was a great idea.  \n\n\nBryant and Jennifer talked about him keeping the trust fund.  She said he didn't need the trust fund when he had a great job with Lucinda.  When he didn't reply she realized he lied about that too.  She said it was easier to take the money and lie about it.  He said he wanted to tell her but she was in such bad shape worrying about her mom.  She asked if it was her fault.  He said no that it wasn't her fault.  She said, \"You're just like him.\"  You lied about what you did and when you got caught, you blame someone else.  She said, \"You're exactly like your father.\"  He told her he's just as angry with Craig as she was for what he did to Barbara, but the trust fund was set up by Lucinda for him.  She reminded him that Craig stole that money from her mother to replace the money he stole for Bryant's trust fun.  She said he lied to her about it.  He said yes that he did but that he didn't agree with her that he should give up $2 million.  They continued to argue and then she turned to walk out.  As she was leaving she told him that she refused to end up like her mother.  She opened the door and Billy was just coming in and asked where she was going.  She said she was going home.  Bryant was mad and kicked over some furniture.  \n\n\nJava Underground:\n\nIsaac tried to tell Ben there were a lot of girls out there and all he had to do was scoop them up.  Lisa laughed at what Isaac was trying to do.  Isaac mentioned that he was short handed at the club and Lisa told him she had someone in mind to help him out.  Isaac saw Bonnie walk in and was immediately attracted to her.  \n\n\nIsaac introduced himself to Bonnie but she wasn't impressed or interested and tried brushing him off.  Jessica walked up and Bonnie introduced her to Isaac.  Jessica and Bonnie sat down and Bonnie told Isaac to bring her a drink.  Isaac left and told Ben that Bonnie really had a bad attitude and he really didn't like her.  Later Isaac overheard Lisa telling Bonnie that she had arranged for her to work at Java.  Bonnie said she didn't think waitressing was her thing.  Jessica told her that she has to get a job to pay for her bills.  Isaac walked up with the drinks and asked to talk to Lisa.  Bonnie and Jessica argued about her having to work.  Jessica told her to get the chip off her shoulder.  It made Bonnie mad but she told Lisa that she'd take the job.\n\n\nIsaac told Lisa that he wasn't hiring Bonnie.  She said no; he wasn't hiring her that she was.  She reminded him that he was under staffed.  She told him that he is going to give Bonnie a chance.  He wasn't happy about it.\n\n\nThe Munson's House:\n\nEmily walked into Hal's patio.  She felt uncomfortable about what Craig wanted her to do.  She thought about Craig's words telling her to hire Carly.  As she started to knock on the door, her cell phone rang.  It was Hal calling to tell her that sitter canceled and he had to take care of Parker.  He said he was having a food fight with Parker and needed to cancel their date.  She looked in the window and smiled as she saw the problem he was having with trying to feed Parker.  She opened the door and told Hal she thought she might as well come in since she was already there.  He told her that she looked beautiful.  She started to leave, but he told her to stay.  He cleaned up Parker after he finished feeding him.  Emily asked Parker where his mom was.  Hal said she was in Chicago looking for a job.  Emily thought that was a long commute.  Hal said Carly wouldn't be commuting that she and Parker would be moving to Chicago.  He told Emily that Carly wanted to get a fresh start for her and Parker.  Emily said she packed her bags and was ready to leave several times but there is no place like home.  Hal said he couldn't stand the idea of Parker being so far away.  Emily started to say she had a job for Carly but she stopped and said she should leave.  Hal stopped her and asked to give him a few minutes while he got Parker ready for bed.  He said  he would fix them something to eat and they could have their date there instead.  \n\n\nHal surprised Emily by decorating the patio for an alternate date at home since he couldn't take her out somewhere special.  She was amazed that he did that all for her.  Emily asked if Carly had something lined out or was she just scoping things out.  Hal asked why?  She said if she is looking for a job, why not look in Oakdale.  Emily said she could hire Carly to work at the Intruder.  Hal was suspicious and said \"but you don't like Carly.\"  She told him she doesn't like a lot of people but that doesn't stop her from working with them.  She said she was just thinking that Carly could run a fashion column for her.  She wanted to know what Hal thought about that, since he wanted Carly to stay in town.  He asked if she wanted to hire Carly so that Parker would be staying closer to home.  She said sure.  He told her that he knew that's not the way she operates.  She told him to forget it.  She realized that he figured out that it wasn't her that was really offering Carly the job.  She said Craig didn't want Carly to know that he was behind her getting the job.  He was hoping that Hal could suggest it to Carly.  She said she should have come right out with it, but she knew how he would react.  Hal asked her if she was doing Craig's dirty work.  Emily denied it, she said she came to have a date with him.  She said that she knew Carly needed a job and he wanted Carly to stay in town.  He asked her if she thought that Carly wouldn't have figured it out that she was working for Craig.  Emily said Carly would be working for her.  He said that Craig has ruined every happy relationship in Oakdale.  She said those relationships were weak to begin with.  Hal said it sounded like she was defending him.  She said if he didn't want Carly to work for Craig that was fine but it wasn't any of his business.  They continued to argue and she said it was stupid for her to get into it with him.   Hal said he was happy until she brought up Craig.  He said that Craig was on a mission to get Carly back in town and that the reason Carly left was because of Craig.  Emily said \"so what\" and wanted to know what that had to do with the two of them.  She reminded him that they were supposed to be on a date.  They continued to argue and Emily got mad and stormed out.  \n\n\n",
