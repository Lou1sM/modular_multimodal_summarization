At first, the girls open up to Lily and tell her about a horrible man who scared Cheri.  Lily blows her cover when she claims to not remember the man's name and the girls tell her Cheri would have never mentioned the man's name and they know she is a fake.   Lily continues to play her role and ask the girls about Cheri and it seems convinces them that she may just be an old friend of Cheri's.  Lily decides to report back to Dusty what she has learned and leaves the girls with her card and money if they change their mind and want to talk.  \n\n\nHolden confronts Dusty at the Lakeview and tries to find out where Lily has gone.  Dusty tells Holden he has no idea where Lily went and thought she was heading home.  Aaron sees the two and attempts to find out what is happening between his father and Dusty.   In the midst of their conversation, Alison arrives to talk to Dusty, but sees Aaron and runs out with Aaron giving chase.  As Holden continues to demand to know about Lily, Dusty receives a call from Lily who tells him she needs to meet with him immediately.  He lets her know that he is with Holden so the two arrange to meet at Al's.   Dusty leaves Holden to meet up with Lily, but before he goes he warns him not to be so angry at him that he doesn't worry about Lily.  \n\n\nLily meets up with Dusty who is shocked by her appearance and the fact that she returned to the Avalon alone to talk to Cheri's girls.  Lily tells him she knows who killed Cheri, but doesn't know his name or anything about him.  Dusty thanks her, but warns Lily that Holden is very upset.  Lily tells Dusty that Holden's anger has nothing to do with him, but is directed at her.  She also tells him she is closer to finding out who killed Cheri than anyone else and knows that if they go back to the Lakeview and search Cheri's room they may find the name of the man who killed her.   They get into Cheri's room and begin to look around and Lily finds a box filled with a ring, pictures and baby hair.  They discover that Cheri was married with a child, who would now be in his late teens, and feel that Cheri left her life behind to avoid some danger that finally caught up with her and lead to her death.  \n\n\nIn the meantime, Aaron has tracked down Alison and asks why she ran out.   Alison explains to Aaron that the video and everything that has happened is just as much her fault as Dusty's.  She goes on to explain that she didn't return his calls because she was trying to help out Gwen and Will.   Aaron comforts Alison and tells her not to beat herself up over her past mistakes.  He makes Alison promise to call him back from now on.  The idea that Aaron is going to call her again makes Alison smile.  Aaron leaves to go back to work, but tells Alison to take care of herself.  \n\n\nWill and Gwen wait for a fertility doctor to find out what their chances are for future conception.   Susan arrives and talks to the two and warns them about trying so soon after Gwen's miscarriage.  She advises them to take things slow and recover from their loss.  Susan explains that Gwen needs to be in good mental and physical health to help guarantee a safe pregnancy for her and the baby.  Susan leaves the two to wait for the doctor and they discuss what Susan has just told them.   When the doctor arrives he tells them the chances of Gwen getting pregnant are very slim and her best chance of getting pregnant is with an egg donor.  He cautions them not to be too excited about the prospects of becoming pregnant right away because the process can take a long time.  \n\n\nWill and Gwen return home and get a visit from Paul who expresses his condolences over their loss.  Paul and Will leave to talk, while Gwen goes off to bed.   After Will leaves Alison arrives with groceries for Will and Gwen and is invited in by Gwen.

At the same time, Will tells Paul about what has happened and Paul promises to be a better brother and offers to pay for the procedure to help the two have a baby.  Will admits he hopes the process takes a while so Gwen can recover and avoid future pain.  \n\n\nCraig and Meg have dinner at Al's Diner and when their meal is over Craig's card is declined.  Just as he and Meg are getting the news from the waitress Paul walks in with a wad of cash and offers to help out.   Craig declines Paul's offer and hands all of his credit cards to the waitress.   Paul makes a snide comment to Meg that sends her away from the table to check on the waitress and leaves Craig to question Paul's appearance at their meal.  Paul explains he is there to watch Craig's financial demise and gloats about seeing all of Craig's credit cards being denied.  Meg returns with all of Craig's cards and tells him they have been declined and asks how Paul knew.  He explains that Rosanna is in Detroit and has set about ruining him financially.  Meg criticizes Craig for not telling her and for letting it happen.    \n\n\nMeg and Craig return to the Lakeview to discuss the downfall of his fortune, where they are confronted by the hotel manager who tells them Craig's credit card has been declined and they need to leave the hotel.  As they are getting ready to leave, Craig gets a call from his lawyer who informs him that Rosanna has frozen all of his assets and that he is broke.    Meg runs into Holden and tells him that she and Craig are moving out to the farm.
