However, Emily hates the idea. Meg found Holden and Emma in the Snyder kitchen, where she got the lowdown on Luke/Kevin. Emma noticed Meg's ring. Meg suggested she and Paul can overcome the \"problem\" of Emily's pregnancy. Emma suggested celebrating with Paul. Meg called Paul, who said he's in a meeting at the Lakeview, so Emma suggested joining him. Emily wanted to shake on the deal, and thanked him for his support. He suggested a celebratory toast, she suggested sparkling apple juice. Emily was skeptical he could deal with Craig, but Paul said he enlisted Lucy to give him a message. Emily made a toast to Paul, just as Meg entered. \n\n\nKatie said she wanted to ask Carly about a job opportunity, but joked about that incident where Simon stripped, so Carly explained the spackle accident again. Katie was caught off-guard by mention of Carly's divorce. She cautioned Carly against getting involved with Simon. About that job?

Meanwhile, Luke defended Jade from Gwen's suspicions. Meanwhile, Maddie removed the slasher's mask to reveal...her sister Eve! Eve mocked Maddie's cluelessness and blamed her for all the dead kids. Eve said \"cute little Maddie, pretty little Maddie\" was taking advantage of people's goodwill. She accused the \"disgusting slut\" of parading herself in front of Louis and tempting him into raping her. Eve considered letting it go until Maddie was prompted to accuse Louis, so Eve had to frame Maddie. Maddie was aghast at all the dead day-players...er, teenagers, and Eve snarked, \"Don't get moral with me. I was protecting my marriage!\" from \"a vicious, grasping slut.\" She started to cry over Louis, which angered Maddie. \"You gave me no choice!\" Eve spat. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jade caught up with the kids and asked what happened. Gwen accused her, and Jade appealed to Will, who defended her. Eve said killing Louis was a sort of release, and the kids were just \"collateral damage.\" Except for Casey. \"He had to die,\" Eve laughed, because she wanted to take away someone Maddie loved, just like Maddie took Louis away. As Maddie reeled, Eve reached for a stone. Maddie wrestled the rock away, but couldn't bring herself to beat in Eve's face with it. Instead she tried to revive Casey. Tom and Margo finally arrived, and the kids pointed out Eve \u2014 who had disappeared! But the fleeing Eve ran straight into Jack, who read her her rights. She laughed maniacally at the stunned Henry. Gwen apologized; Jade let it slide. Dallas brought the news about Casey rescuing Maddie from Eve. Jade noticed Gwen recoiling from Will, and hoped they had not reconciled yet. Eve was furious that Henry was more concerned about \"poor Maddie\" than her. \"How come you never worried about me?\" she cried. \"I hope you're happy.\" As she was led away, Eve asked Jack, \"Get the wine I sent you?\" As she passed her little sister, Eve sniped, \"Later, Maddie.\" Gwen regretted suspecting Jade, and Will regretted things he said to Casey as Jade and Luke watched from the bushes. As an EMT attended to Gwen, Jade thanked Will for defending her. A distraught Maddie noted that Casey saved her life twice, and that Eve blamed her for everything. Will carried gimpy Gwen to the ambulance. At the police station, Eve tried to flirt with Jack, then told him, \"Enjoy the wine.\" At the hospital, Margo reassured Casey before he was wheeled away. Maddie pleaded with Casey to be okay. \n\n\n",
