Katie had to tell Chris that the doctor had not been able to do the operation because Chris was just not strong enough.  Then Katie threatened the patient if he dared to give up hope.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Bob asked John how long Chris would live in his present condition, and John answered that they needed a suitable heart donor match within 24 hours.  John's pager beeped, so he excused himself, and Bob went try to convince Kim to go home.  She refused to leave, so they both went in to visit Chris, who still had Katie with him.  Bob finally persuaded Kim to get something to eat, and Alison offered to accompany her.  Kim was pleased that Alison and Casey had made their engagement official, and she admired Nancy's ring on the girl's finger.  She also said she felt very blessed, also, that Katie had stepped up to support Chris.\n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station, Tom and Margo talked about how Tom had arranged for the donor heart at Bay City, and he was quite proud of himself.  Margo, however, read her phone messages and was shocked to read that John Dixon had called to report that the Bay City heart was no longer an option for Chris.  Then Margo answered her phone and was shocked to learn news of a terrible accident from the chief of police of Bay City.  She and Tom got in their car and drove to the site of the accident on the railroad tracks outside Bay City.\n\n\nLuke, Casey, and Alison discussed the secret they all shared: that Reid Oliver had gone to Bay City to retrieve the donor heart himself.  Alison wanted to give a little hope to Bob and Kim, and Luke finally agreed.  He walked over to them and said that Reid was on his way to Bay City to lobby the surgeon who had blocked the donation for Chris.  Bob talked about having hope again for his son, as Tom and Margo arrived looking very disturbed.  Bob realized there was something wrong, so Margo told him there had been a horrendous accident.\n\n\nMargo explained that Reid Oliver's car had stalled on the railroad tracks while he was on his way to Bay City, and the train had hit him before Reid could scramble out.  The doctor was barely alive and was en route to Memorial by ambulance.  Bob approached Casey and Luke and ordered them to go to the cafeteria to look for Kim and Alison, but the EMT's wheeled Reid through the corridor before the boys had left.  Luke recognized Reid and called out his name, but Bob prevented the boy from following the gurney.  Instead, Bob went to check on the doctor and then reported back to Luke that Reid's injuries were \"beyond repair.\"\n\n\nLuke ran to the emergency room where Reid was and was frantic that no one was \"doing a damn thing\" to save him.  Bob allowed him entrance, and Luke saw a mortally wounded Dr. Oliver.  Reid consoled his friend, who haltingly made it known that Luke should get his wallet.  A nurse handed over Reid's personal effects, and Luke took out the billfold and looked through it.  He noted all the credit cards and then saw Reid's driver's license.  On the back it stated that the man was an organ donor.  Luke began to sob and tried to tell Reid that he wasn't donating any organs any time soon, but Reid whispered, \"Now, I need a lawyer now.\"\n\n\nLuke ran outside and grabbed Tom Hughes and took him back to the emergency room.  Tom asked how he could help, so Reid sputtered that he wanted Luke to have his durable power of attorney.\"  Then Reid said, \"Heart,\" and Tom realized that the man was giving his heart to Chris.  \"Who knew I had one to give?\" joked Reid, as Luke said how much he loved Reid, and Reid's monitor flatlined.\n\n\nBob and John pronounced Reid dead, while they kept his heart beating in preparation for a possible transplant.  Luke fought the idea, while Tom reminded him that Reid still had one patient he had to help.  John spoke up and announced to everyone that there were tests to be run for tissue compatibility, plus all sorts of legal ramifications.  Tom said he had legal authority based on Reid's deathbed request, so John said he would do the tissue tests to determine if the doctor was a match for Chris.  Luke was still unwilling to give up, so Bob escorted him out while John worked.  After John rushed the tissue to the lab, Luke went back in and talked to his love until he could finally say goodbye.\n\n\nChris weakened, but Katie kept encouraging him by telling him what their lives would be like when he was well.  She begged him to hang on a little bit longer.  Luke joined them there, and Tom found him and gave him a legal paper to sign, which gave John permission to shut off the heart machine and to donate the heart expressly to Chris Hughes.  John then notified Katie, who was taking a break in the hall, that they had a heart that was a perfect match, and they were moving on it fast.  Katie went and kissed Chris, as the staff prepared to wheel him to an operating room.\n\n\nBob sat with Kim and explained what was going on.  \"How could this happen?\" cried Kim, as her heart ached for Reid.  She felt awful for all the times she had blasted him for his inappropriate comments and rudeness.  Alison found Bob and asked him if she could be a part of the transplant team, and Bob agreed.  Katie found Luke sitting alone in a hallway, and she was very excited about the prospect of the transplant.  She told Luke that she loved his boyfriend for going all the way to Bay City and wresting the donor heart away from the doctors there.  Katie asked where Reid was, and Luke began to cry.  He shared the bad news with her, and Katie wept, also.\n\n\nJohn inspected the legal papers offered by Tom, and Tom verified that Luke had signed them.  Katie then found Kim, Margo, and Casey, and she began sobbing in Kim's arms.  They all went in to the emergency room, and Luke joined them, for a final goodbye to Reid.  Then Katie went back to tell Chris that she loved him.\n\n\nMargo and Tom waited through surgery with Casey.  Tom expressed the thought that Reid Oliver had done a magnificent and selfless thing by donating his heart to Chris, so he felt it was only fitting that the Hughes family start doing more for others.  Kim and Bob had every confidence in John Dixon's abilities as a surgeon, but they felt helpless at that moment.  Luke and Katie returned to the empty emergency room where Reid had died and comforted one another, as Chris lay on an operating table nearby, and John began the transplant.\n\n\n",
