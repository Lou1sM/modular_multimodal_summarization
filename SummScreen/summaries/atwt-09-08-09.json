As she was handing Holden the food, Eb burst in and scattered it.  He struck Maeve and knocked her to the floor, as he further threatened his weeping wife.  Eb went outside, and Holden asked Maeve to move  closer so he could see if she was hurt.  He told her that he had absolutely no idea where Skaggs had hidden his money, but Maeve did not know what to believe.\n\n\nHolden said that if money was the issue, then he could get her some.  He asked for Maeve's help and promised her and Eb all they needed.  He said he would write a letter authorizing his bank to allow Maeve to make a withdrawal.  He explained that it was as good as a check, and all Maeve had to do was find a branch of Holden's bank.  Maeve said that Eb would not like the idea, so Holden changed the plan.  He suggested that the woman withdraw the money and hide it, and then give Holden the directions, and he could lead Eb to the site.\n\n\nHolden was sure that Eb would believe that the money was Skaggs's treasure. Maeve thought there was a chance that would work, but she was worried what would happen to her after Eb got the money.  Holden offered her money of her own from his account and suggested that she hide it for herself, but Maeve said she would not take a penny from Holden.  She admitted that she did not want to live with Eb any longer, so Holden gave her his word that he would help her get out of her situation.\n\n\nHolden wrote the letter to the bank and told Maeve to give it to a manager.  Maeve said that she trusted Holden, and she hoped that he trusted her, as well.  They discussed the plan further and decided that she would take the money and bury it, as a start.  Maeve thanked Holden for putting hope back into her life, and she gave him a quick kiss.  They heard Eb returning, so Maeve made a fast exit.\n\n\nLily found Damian by her front door moving a potted tree around the patio.  He explained that it was a custom of his family to plant a tree in memory of a lost loved one, and he thought Lily and her children might like to do that for Holden.  Lily was hesitant and reminded Damian that just a day earlier, he had declared his undying love for her.  Damian apologized for hurting Lily's sensibilities, but he claimed that his feelings were valid.  Lily said that as long as Damian felt that way about her, their being together was awkward.\n\n\nLuke joined his mother and Damian, and his birth  father told him about the tree tradition.  The boy was enthusiastic about doing it, and he felt it might help the girls, and particularly young Ethan, face the reality of Holden's loss.  Lily said she thought it was too soon to have another ceremony, and they all went into the house.  Luke said the tree-planting could be very informal and would concentrate on something living for a change.  Lily finally agreed, so Luke left to find Noah, and Lily suggested that Damian invite Meg, as well.\n\n\nDamian showed up at the farm and asked to speak with Meg.  He claimed that he had not broken up with her; he had only suggested that they take a break and spend some time apart.  Damian said that Lily's family was going to plant a tree in Holden's memory, and he invited Meg to be there.  Meg accepted, but she wanted to go on her own.  When Damian offered to take her, Meg asked if Lily had turned him down.  She yelled at him, and he turned to go, but Meg stopped him.  When she learned that Damian had bought the tree, she asked what he had meant when she had suggested that the two of them go together.\n\n\nThey talked some more, and Meg said that she was willing to try again at their relationship if Damian was.  They agreed, so Meg got Eliza ready and realized that the baby was running a fever.  She suspected that a latent ear infection was flaring up again, but she wanted to have a doctor check the baby before she went to the tree-planting ceremony.  She promised to meet Damian there at the park, and she gave him a kiss.\n\n\nLuke and Noah walked on the path at the park, and Luke explained about the memorial tree.  Noah was pleased that since he had missed Holden's funeral, he could still honor a man whom he very much admired.  Mason was pedaling down the path towards them, but he lost control of his bike and crashed into a fence railing.  He screamed with pain when he tried to get up, so the boys helped him.  Luke suggested that Noah take Mason to Memorial, because Mason needed Noah more than Luke did.  Noah agreed and promised to meet up with Luke and his family later.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Noah helped Mason remove his shirt, and Mason told his student to go meet up with Luke in the park for the tree ceremony.  Noah said that he would wait until a doctor arrived, but one soon did.  Noah took off, but he promised to check back on Mason soon.\n\n\nLuke went home, and he and Lily were ready to leave for the park, but Faith refused to attend because the idea had been Damian's.  That made no sense to Luke, so he sent Lily on ahead with the smaller children and said he would talk with his sister.  Faith appeared and told her brother that Damian had no right to be involved in Holden's ceremony; after all, Damian was not family.  Luke reminded Faith that Damian was his father and had definitely changed for the better.  Faith said that Damian only wanted..., but then her words trailed off.  Luke told his sister that he needed her support and help, and she relented.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul received a call and told Emily that he had to go to the hospital to sign some papers and claim his father's body.  He was actually eager to do it, and he explained to Emily that he \"wanted to make sure the bastard was really dead.\"  Emily offered to go with him, so they left together.  At the hospital, Paul signed the paperwork, and a doctor said they would be sending James's body to the funeral home soon.  Paul was overjoyed, and he began nuzzling Emily's neck, as Meg and Eliza walked up.  Paul said hello, and Meg instantly realized that her ex-husband had recovered his memory.\n\n\nPaul asked to hold the baby, as Emily watched him closely.  Eliza slept contentedly in her father's arms, and a nurse approached and told Meg that her appointment had been delayed.  Meg was unhappy because she wanted to get to the park, so Paul offered to stay with the baby and go with her to the appointment.  Emily backed him up, so Meg ran off, promising to be back as soon as she could.  Paul took Eliza in to see the doctor, and Meg had been correct that the baby needed antibiotics for her ear infection.  Paul called Meg and left a message saying that he would take the baby home and Meg  could let him know when she wanted the baby home.\n\n\nIn the park, Faith, Natalie, Ethan, Luke, and Lily gathered around the tree.  They had found a good spot and had prepared a hole.  They took turns putting soil around the roots, and Luke helped Ethan do his share.  They circled the tree and held hands, and Lily spoke to Holden about how the tree would grow and how they would hold family picnics under it in his honor.  Suddenly, Damian appeared, much to Faith's annoyance, and Lily asked why Meg was not with him.  Damian said that he was afraid that Meg could not make it because of Eliza's appointment.\n\n\nLuke asked Damian to join them, and when Faith protested, Luke said that Damian was there for him.  Damian held Lily's hand and said some nice remarks about the whole family.  Damian picked up Ethan, who had begun to cry because he had finally realized that his daddy was never returning home.  Damian told the boy it was perfectly all right if he felt like crying.\n\n\nNoah ran up, and Luke hugged him.  Lily began talking to Holden again, followed by Luke.  Natalie said something, but when it was Faith's turn, the girl said that her daddy already knew how she felt, even if her mother did not. Faith ran off, and it began to rain as they finished up the tree ceremony. They had already left when a soaked Meg arrived in a downpour.\n\n\nNoah returned to Memorial and found Mason waiting.  Mason said the doctor had said that he had a bad sprain and that he might have to call on Noah for some menial tasks in the next few days.  Luke joined them, which did not seem to please Mason.  The boys offered him a ride home, but Mason had already called a cab.  The boys left, and Mason looked pensive.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul watched his daughter sleep in her infant seat.  Emily watched Paul, and his devotion to his baby moved her.  Paul apologized for ignoring Emily, but he said it felt very right to be around Eliza again.  He told Emily that if spending time with the baby was a problem for her, he was more than willing to discuss it.  Emily, however, said that she totally understood an attachment to one's child.  In fact, she admitted, it appeared that Paul was getting closer to \"sealing the marriage deal.\"\n\n\nAt home, Damian held a sleeping Ethan on the couch, and Lily tried to figure out why Faith was treating her like Public Enemy # 1.  She had no idea why her daughter was so unhappy with her.  Damian suggested that Faith just needed time, but Lily suspected the problem was deeper.  Lily went to help Natalie find a DVD, and she left Damian holding Ethan.  A soggy Meg walked in and said that she had run into Paul at the hospital and that he had regained his memory.  He was also interested in spending time with Eliza again .\n\n\nMeg said that she needed to go get her daughter, and she asked Damian to join her.  Damian said that he could not because he still had to help Lily with the kids.  He did suggest that they meet later at the farm after she had picked up her daughter.\n\n\nMeg walked outside and got a call from Paul asking if he could keep their daughter a bit longer.  Meg agreed, and then she looked in the window and saw Damian and Lily comforting Ethan, who was still in Damian's arms.\n\n\n",
