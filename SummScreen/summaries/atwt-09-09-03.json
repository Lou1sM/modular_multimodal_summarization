    "tvmega_recap": "Susan and Alison were still shaken by their ordeal with Rick. Alison had a flashback of Rick's hand over her mouth, and Chris reassured her she was safe now. Susan decided that she needed to see Rick again, to ask him why he chose her. Emily and Hal reluctantly agreed. Marshall accused Bonnie of orchestrating Sarah's disappearance, but she insisted she knew nothing about it. Jessica blasted Walker for interfering with Bonnie and Sarah, but Walker insisted that she is the one who will end up breaking Bonnie's heart. She told Marshall that she would help him retain custody once the girl is found. Meanwhile, Bonnie found Sarah, then promised her she wouldn't make her move in with Marshall. Tom and Marshall decided that if they didn't hear from Katie soon, they would go to Australia themselves. On the sheep station, Mordecai killed Constable Brighton just as he found Katie and Mike. He made them bury the body, then forced Katie to call and reassure Margo, to keep the police from arriving. Simon called, and Mordecai prepared to meet Simon in Sydney with Katie, but leave Mike behind. Margo wasn't sure that Katie was really alright.",
