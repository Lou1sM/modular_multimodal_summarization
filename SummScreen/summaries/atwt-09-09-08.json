Dallas told Jack that there was some new evidence in the Leo Morrisey case that might lead them to discover who had almost drowned the boy. \n\n\nAt Lily's house, the Snyder/Stewart women gathered to help with the wedding preparations and to attend the rehearsal. Casey was short with Emily, reminding her that he knew quite well how she felt about marriage. Emily was still worried about Alison's odd behavior earlier that day. Aaron arrived and was surprised that Alison was not there yet. Holden helped Lily with an electrical problem at the house, but not without making a hurtful crack about Mike. Dani Andropoulos questioned Susan about Alison's continued absence and volunteered to go search for the missing bride. Aaron received a text message from Alison saying she was on her way, but Dani had already left. \n\n\nIn his room at the Lakeview, Chris told Alison to calm down and take a step back from the wedding plans. He felt Alison really did not want to marry Aaron, but she disagreed. Aaron called on Alison's cell phone, but she chose not to answer. Chris apologized for questioning her feelings and blurted out his own: he was in love with her himself. Alison denied that, but Chris protested that he had always loved her. He kissed her with great feeling, and the two of them fell on the bed and began to make love. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Brad and Katie finished taping a promo as Jack arrived with the news that Brad had better contact a lawyer because the Morrisey case was about to burst wide open. Jack explained that the investigators had found footprints at the lake and fingerprints on the pay phone Brad had used to call the EMTs. Brad argued that he had committed no crime, and had in fact tried to revive the boy, but Jack said his brother could be facing attempted murder charges. A frightened Brad asked Katie to tend to more WOAK business while he talked with Jack. Jack asked him to turn himself in, but Brad stalked out. Jack found him at the police station, however, waiting for Dallas, and offered to help if he could. Brad asked him to take the evidence against him and get rid of it. Jack refused to put his job on the line, but Brad begged him not to destroy the wonderful new life he, Katie, and Liberty were building. Jack caved in and shooed Brad out of the station. \n\n\nSusan decided to begin the wedding rehearsal without Alison since the practice was primarily for the little girls' benefit. Faith kept the wedding participants on the right path, and Emily stood in for her sister. \n\n\nJanet and Liberty were baking pies in Emma's kitchen, and Liberty mentioned how \"normal\" her mother was around Jack and how much more relaxed she was when she was with him. The two of them decided they had time to do a bit of shopping so that Janet could dazzle Jack at the wedding, and they left the last of the pie making until later. \n\n\nDani went to Memorial to see if she could locate the missing bride. A nurse told her that Alison had left quite a while ago. Then Dani asked for Dr. Chris Hughes and was told that he, too, had left earlier. Dani began wondering if those two occurrences were just a coincidence. \n\n\nAlison and Chris finished making love and Alison was shocked to find out it was 5:00, an hour past the start of the rehearsal. Chris could not believe that Alison was going through with the wedding and urged her to tell Aaron what she and Chris had done. Alison dashed out, determined to get married, and Chris, wearing only a towel, followed her into the hallway outside his room. He did not see Dani hiding around the corner, watching. \n\n\nLiberty stopped at the police station after finishing shopping and brought Jack a coffee and a bakery treat as a thank you for giving her mother another chance. Jack questioned her about how she was faring following the attempted rape, and she told her new uncle how much she loved having a dad who really cared about her. She left, and Jack picked up the Morrisey evidence folder and gave it a long look. \n\n\nAlison went to Lily's to find the rehearsal over. Dani returned and made some leading remarks to the bride-to-be. Everyone left for the rehearsal dinner at the Lakeview, where Aaron made some loving remarks in his toast to Alison and their new life together. When he asked her about the chocolates for dessert, she lied that she had eaten them all because she was so nervous about the wedding. She also intercepted some meaningful looks from Dani at dinner. Alison excused herself and headed to the ladies' room but ran into Chris in the lobby. He asked her if she had told Aaron what they had done that afternoon, and she said no; she was not going to hurt him. The two of them argued about Alison's denying her feelings for Chris. \n\n\nJack found Janet finishing up her pies and told her Brad was in big trouble. He had with him the evidence reports that incriminated his brother. Janet asked if anyone else knew about them, and when Jack said no, she offered to take the reports and hide them so that guilt would not eat Jack alive. Jack handed the reports to her and walked outside. \n\n\nBrad met Katie at home and told her that he thought Jack was going to make the evidence against him disappear. They waited impatiently for a phone call confirming this. They were still agonizing about what Jack would do when Brad got the phone call. Jack simply said Brad had nothing to worry about. Jack went back inside the farmhouse and Janet told him he had done the right thing. He replied, \"No, I don't think I did.\" \n\n\nDani came up to Alison, who was still having a discussion with Chris in the lobby of the Lakeview, and told Alison that her mother was getting some tea for her to calm her nerves. Alison left to go back into the banquet room, and Dani remarked to Chris that Alison would make a beautiful bride. Aaron found Alison and gave her a big hug, but Alison could see Chris staring at her over Aaron's shoulder.\n\n\n",

Alison is very late to her rehearsal dinner and Susan sends Dani to look for her because she is very worried about her.

Jack heads to the farm and shows Janet the evidence and she offers to help by hiding it and not telling him where it is so he won't feel so guilty about taking the evidence from the station.",
