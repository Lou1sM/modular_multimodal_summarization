Adam's most grievous error, though, was that he had forced his mother to cover it up.  Tom said that if the crimes had involved only Adam, he would have no qualms about turning his son over to the police.  Since Casey and Margo were on the hook for aiding and abetting a criminal, the situation was more serious.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Adam told Alison that he was sorry for lying to her about who he was.  Alison quickly reminded him that he had also lied to almost his entire family.  Adam said he was only trying to live a good life, but Alison asked him whose.  She was confused as to whether he was planning on being Riley Morgan or Adam Munson.  She said Adam's apology was bogus, and the only thing that had changed about him was his face.  She called him as messed up and dishonest as he had always been.\n\n\nAdam's \"excuse\" was that every time he had talked about stepping up and facing the music, Margo had begged him not to.  Adam could not break his mother's heart again.  Alison didn't buy his story and told him it was not too late for him to be just plain Adam again.  Adam left, and Casey found Alison alone in a hospital room, thinking.  He said he had heard his mother crying in her room all night, but she had gone to work early.\n\n\nCasey also said that his father was torn up about the thought of sending the three members of his immediate family to jail. The boy was worried that his folks' marriage could not withstand the strain, mainly because his mother felt that Adam had already atoned for his crimes by suffering in Afghanistan.  Alison said that Adam had paid her a visit to apologize, but she had told him to forget it.\n\n\nAdam went to the police station and told Margo that he could not have her lying for him anymore, but his mother said that was her choice.  Adam was willing to pay whatever penalty was required for him to resume a normal life after he had paid his debt.  He said it was the only way he could live with himself, and he vowed that he would turn himself in.  Margo thought that Tom could figure out a solution, and she begged Adam not to destroy her \"mother's miracle.\"\n\n\nMargo also reminded Adam that she and Casey would also face jail time if Adam turned himself in to the authorities.  Adam said that the one way to avoid that was for his mother to lie one last time for him.  He argued that if his mother and Casey pretended that they did not know that Riley Morgan was Adam, they would be in the clear.  Adam was hopeful that Tom and Casey would also see it as the best possible solution.  Margo called for an officer to arrest her son, Adam Munson, for several outstanding federal warrants, and the stunned policeman took Adam away.  Margo spoke to Hal's picture on the wall and asked him what had happened to their wonderful son.\n\n\nCasey and Alison adjourned their discussion to Java, and Margo found them there.  She included Alison in the conversation when she learned that the girl knew the truth about Adam.  Margo told them that Adam had presented himself at the police station and turned himself in.  She also revealed that her son was going to claim that no one knew the truth about his true identity, so they were off the hook.\n\n\nTom met with Adam at the station, and the young man said that he needed to own up and pay for his mistakes.  He asked his father to overlook the fact that Margo and Casey knew who he was, and he asked for Tom's help with that.  Tom said he had no answer for Adam at the moment, and he walked out.  He went home and discussed the situation with Margo, who had just returned from Java.  Tom was concerned about the status of their marriage, and Margo said that she had hoped her husband would just be happy that their son was still alive.  She apologized for her mistakes and said she knew that her son was going away again. They hugged before Margo returned to work.\n\n\nBarbara showed up at the police station and hassled Margo for James's death on her watch.  Margo finally agreed to look into whether foul play had taken place in Stenbeck's most recent demise.  The two of them drove to the funeral home, and Margo explained to the funeral director that James's body had been released to him before the medical examiner had performed an autopsy.  She requested that the director send the remains to the coroner's office immediately, but the man told her that it was too late; Mr. Stenbeck had been embalmed earlier that day.  He also said that the special speedy embalming had been at the request of the decedent's son, Paul Ryan.  Barbara turned and stomped out.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul discussed details with a caterer for a reception following James's funeral service.  He eschewed the \"dignified, discreet service\" recommended by the caterer for an \"over-the-top, happy food and fireworks\" celebration.  Emily walked in, and Paul told her of his plans.  They enjoyed some champagne, as Barbara stormed in.  She began yelling accusations at her son and asked him what he had been thinking when he had ordered his father's embalming right away.  She announced that Paul had just ruined any chance he had of getting his father's money.\n\n\nPaul said that he had called the funeral home and ordered a \"box for dead dad and a hole to put him in.\"  Barbara explained that if her son had not been so hasty, the medical examiner would have done a postmortem that would have shown that Audrey had killed James, most likely with Henry's help.  That would have resulted in Paul's getting James's entire inheritance.  Paul tried again to explain that he wanted neither the Stenbeck name nor the Stenbeck fortune.  He was prepared to enjoy every moment of James's send-off.\n\n\nBarbara said that Audrey Coleman could no longer think of James's death as her own personal cash box, because Barbara was going to put up a fight.  Emily lifted her champagne flute in a toast to \"James Stenbeck, the gift that keeps on giving.\"\n\n\nHenry got dressed for his father's funeral and worried that a black armband might be over-the-top.  Vienna reminded him that he had promised to give all the inheritance to his mother, but Henry quibbled about the meaning of \"all.\"  Vienna said Henry had to make the choice again:  the money and his mother or Vienna and true love the way it used to be.  Henry chose Vienna.\n\n\nIn the lobby, Audrey Coleman met with Mr. Hanson, James's former attorney.  He gave her a hard time about his kidnapping, but he was willing to keep the deal he had struck with her.  Hanson questioned whether Henry would actually follow through with the cash payout, but Audrey guaranteed it.  She went up to Henry's room and called through the door that it was time to go to the funeral.  Henry let his mother in, and she announced that they should go in a group, so as to present a united front to the Ryan contingent at the reading of James's will.\n\n\nAudrey whined that it was so sad to lose her \"Jimmy,\" just when she had gotten him back.  Henry suggested that she not waste her crocodile tears on them.  He knew that Audrey had not \"lost\" James; she had \"dispatched\" him and tried to pin it on Henry.  Audrey said that Paul was paying for the funeral, the gravesite, and a reception afterwards at Fairwinds.  They left for the funeral home.\n\n\nAt the funeral home, Audrey introduced herself to the director as \"the widow Stenbeck,\" at least in her heart.  Henry went immediately to the open casket and poked his father.  Vienna asked what he was doing, and Henry replied that it was not as if James hadn't risen from the dead before.  They sat down as Barbara, Paul, and Emily arrived.  Paul approached the casket to \"make sure the old guy was really dead.\"  All three stood beside James, and Barbara took out a long hat pin and plunged it into his chest.  When there was no reaction, Emily removed a mirror from her purse and held it in front of the corpse's mouth and nose.  She announced that he was not breathing. \n\n\nThe director sent them to their seats and asked if anyone wanted to share a memory of Mr. Stenbeck.  When no one responded., Paul shouted, \"Guess not!  Let's put the old guy in the ground.\"  Audrey got up and began some hysterical crying beside the coffin, while Henry rolled his eyes.  After hearing Audrey scream \"Jimmy! Jimmy!\" one too many times, Barbara got up and approached, shoving Audrey aside.  Barbara  yelled, \"You killed him!\" as Audrey warned her \" not to touch the merchandise.\"  Paul egged the women on with his tasteless comments.\n\n\nAudrey mentioned \"Jimmy's prowess in bed,\" and a mortified Henry asked if they were to be spared nothing.  His mother retorted with a crack about Henry's role-playing costumes, and that shut him up.  She urged her son to say a proper goodbye to his father by giving him a kiss.  Barbara had reached her limit, and she pushed Audrey away and took Audrey's place by the casket.  Audrey asked if Barbara really wanted a fight, and Barbara replied, \"Bring it, bitch.\"  The two women went at each other, grabbing and punching.  Audrey backed Barbara up to the casket and pushed her backwards on top of James.\n\n\nHenry and Paul jumped in and separated the women.  They tried to figure out what to do next, so Emily suggested they drive a stake into James's heart, just to be sure.  Everyone left except Audrey, who immediately called someone and said, \"It's show time!\"\n\n\nAt Faiwinds, everyone drank to the latest demise of James Stenbeck and the end of his reign of terror.  They discussed many of the man's misdeeds and wicked schemes, including when a teenaged Paul had shot his father, who was strangling Emily.  Vienna was shocked that Paul had actually shot James, but Paul explained that in his family, that \" was like bonding.\" Audrey was not there, and they questioned her whereabouts.  Just then, she walked in with Hanson, the attorney, in tow.  She announced that it was time to read James's last will and testament, and Hanson began.\n\n\nJames's few words said that he left his entire estate to his illegitimate son, Henry Coleman.  Barbara jumped up and said that the will would not hold up in court, but Paul told Henry that he was welcome to the money.  He wished Henry luck. Henry grabbed Vienna and they made a fast exit, with Audrey trailing behind.  Barbara declared that James had twice cheated Paul out of his inheritance, but Paul did not care.  Barbara had a response ready, but Emily interrupted her by asking her to \"play nice,\" or they would make sure she had to sit next to Audrey at the wedding.  Barbara stormed out, as Paul reacted to Emily's word \"wedding.\"\n\n\nPaul and Emily finished the champagne, and Paul slyly asked if she was considering a wedding in the near future.  Emily said yes, because Paul had turned his back on James and everything he stood for, including his money.  She said that she trusted Paul, and agreed to marry him.  Emily hoped that they could make a better job of it the second time around. She declared the Stenbeck curse over and done with, and they embraced.\n\n\nAudrey caught up with her son at the Lakeview as he and Vienna headed for their room.  She said they had unsettled business, but Henry reminded her that they did not have the money yet.  He said that the lawyer had read a will, not an ATM.  Audrey offered to fetch paper and pen so that Henry could give her a sworn statement that he was granting her the whole amount of the estate, free and clear.  Henry said no; the money was his and the terms would be his.  He promised to give his mother enough money to pay off Hanson and to settle her debt with Ray Zuma.  They would see about the rest.\n\n\nVienna complained that Henry had said that he would give the whole amount to Audrey, but Henry said he was having second thoughts.  Audrey was prepared for a fight, and she stated that, but Henry countered with the thought that he just might have kept the murder weapon.  Audrey made some more threats before she took off, and Vienna again reminded Henry that he had chosen her over the money.  She said they had to get rid of it, or it could ruin their lives.\n\n\n",
