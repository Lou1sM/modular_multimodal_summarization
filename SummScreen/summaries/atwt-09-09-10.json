Luke wondered how Noah knew he would be at the pond, and Noah answered that it had always been Luke's place.  Luke agreed, and he said he would have to put swimming there on the list of things that he never got to do with Reid.  Noah asked what else was on that list, and Luke answered that they had never gone to a movie together, or bowled, or watched a ballgame, nor had they ever visited a museum or gone shopping.  Noah said that whatever the two of them had done was obviously enough to make them fall in love.\n\n\nLuke admitted, however, that he and Reid had never made love because Luke had wanted to wait.  Noah recounted the wonderful things Reid had done, such as restore Noah's sight and donate his heart to a dying Chris Hughes.  According to Noah, that made Reid Oliver a hero in his book.  Luke, however, told Noah that Reid was not a hero, and he railed about how anti-hero Reid's behavior was when it overrode good sense in trying to beat the train to the crossing.  Luke got emotional, and Noah hugged him.  They continued to talk as Luke reminded Noah that Noah had a plane to catch to LA.  Noah said he could get another one.\n\n\nIn his hospital room, Chris demanded to know whose heart he had, but Katie continued to put him off.  Chris said some things did not add up, and he only wanted the truth.  Finally Katie said that Chris had Reid's heart, but Chris did not understand.  She explained that Reid had been in a car accident on a railroad crossing, and Chris figured out immediately that the doctor had been on his way to Bay City to get the heart for Chris.  Chris felt responsible for Reid's death, and he began to get agitated.  He and Katie argued about whether Reid had died in vain, and Bob Hughes heard the commotion and barged into the room.\n\n\nBob said he had not wanted his son to know the source of his new heart so soon, but Chris kept asking whose idea it had been to slap Reid's heart into Chris's chest.  Katie finally yelled that it had been Reid's idea, and Bob described what had happened.  A nurse entered to take the patient's vitals, so Bob and Katie stepped out.  Katie apologized to Bob for spilling the beans, but Bob was not upset.  When Katie returned to Chris, he was wondering if every breath he took for the rest of his life would be a reminder of Reid Oliver.  Katie got angry and told Chris he was dishonoring both Reid and the amazing gift he had given Chris. \"Suck it up, Hughes,\" she advised.  Chris held Katie, and she admitted that she wanted to fall asleep every night listening to the beat of Chris's beautiful heart.\n\n\nIn the park in Brooklyn, Reid Oliver's uncle Angus shouted at Lily and Holden for ruining his chess game and his entire day, for that matter.  Holden interrupted and said that Reid was dead.  \"That's a damn shame,\" said Angus, and then he inquired \"what the hell\" he was supposed to do about it.  Holden explained that his son Luke was the one designated by Reid to dispose of his remains, but the law required a signature from a family member.  Oliver asked, \"who the hell Luke\" was to his nephew, and Holden answered that he was a \"very close friend,\" but then he changed that to say that Reid and Luke were in love. \n\n\nLily and Holden said that Reid had died as a hero, and Holden handed the man a paper to sign.  Angus signed, and then he shared a story about Reid as a child when he had lost an important chess match.  Angus also handed them a black knight chess piece to give to Luke in memory of Reid.\n\n\nBack in Oakdale, Lily and Holden met Luke and Noah at the pond to scatter Reid's ashes.  Luke spoke about how Reid had hated Memorial Hospital but loved the new neurological wing, so some of his ashes would be interred there and the rest in the Snyder pond.  \"We're finally going to get that swim,\" said Luke, as he gently emptied the box into the water.  Then Luke took out the black knight that Angus had sent him, and whispered, \"Goodbye, Reid.\"\n\n\nBob and Kim visited their son and told him the news that the new wing on the hospital would be named in memory of Dr. Reid Oliver.  Then Bob said that Luke had also asked that some of Reid's ashes go into the cornerstone of the new neurological wing, and they all agreed that would be wonderful.\n\n\nIn her office in Worldwide, an enraged Lucinda ordered John Dixon to leave, and she threatened to call security.  John told her to calm down and listen to him.  He said he wanted to apologize for the way he had spoken to her earlier in the day, but overhearing Lucinda's conversation to a crony to do more harm to Lily had put him off.  John demanded to know what Lucinda had done to her daughter, and Lucinda admitted that she had crossed the line one too many times with the result that Lily had disowned her mother.  She also said that Lily owned enough stock in Worldwide to cause endless trouble.\n\n\nWhen John realized that Lucinda was planning on striking first and destroying Lily, he yelled, \"What the hell is wrong with you, woman?\"  He said she was behaving like the classic Lucinda Walsh, but Lucinda accused John of descending on Oakdale like Superman to perform miracles and save a life.  That, she explained, gave him no right to hold everyone to the straight moral code that he had apparently recently adopted.  John said Lucinda sounded exactly like the old war-horse he remembered, and he reminded her that she had at one time been his wife.\n\n\nWhen John continued to say that he would like to think of Lucinda \"as a friend,\" she called him \"delusional.\"  She also explained that she was a cancer survivor in remission, and not once during her horrendous ordeal had she heard from John.  John acknowledged that, but he still felt that Lucinda was making a huge mistake with her daughter by destroying her connection with Lily.  He warned her to \"stay the hell away from Lily.\"\n\n\nOut of the blue, John asked Lucinda if Reid Oliver had been in love with her grandson, and that infuriated her.  John went on to say that Lucinda was so programmed to fight that she didn't back down even when her adversary was her own flesh and blood.  Lucinda responded honestly that fighting was the only thing she did well, but John contended that it was not too late for her to change the outcome of how things would go down with Lily.  He told Lucinda that she had it within herself, and he called her \"old girl of mine.\"  \n\n\nJohn offered to speak with Lily, but Lucinda declined.  As John turned to go, he told Lucinda that she had only one thing wrong.  He said no one before or after him had ever known her so well, and he was very, very glad that she wasn't sick any more.  Lucinda watched John leave, and then she sat at her desk and thought.\n\n\nA bit later, John showed up at Margo's house with a bouquet of daisies.  He announced that he was considering hanging around Oakdale for a while.  He also asked how his daughter felt about that, so Margo invited him in and hid her smile.\n\n\nLucinda also arrived at Lily's empty house with an armload of flowers, which she dumped on the doorstep before she left.\n\n\n",
