As she is about to walk out of the room, Ric calls out to her.  She asks him why he picked her.  He says she was attractive, professional but also lonely and available.  She says, \"You used me.\"  Ric says, \"Because you let me.\"  He says they both haven't felt good about themselves in a long time. He goes back into his psychotic break and Susan leaves with Emily and Alison.  \n\n\nJen asks Hal to help her find out who made the 911 call that led to the arrest at Java Underground. She explains her situation and that she needs proof to clear her and Paul.  Barbara comes in but Jen tells her to \"back off\".  Hal gives Jen the information she is looking for and they discover that it was Craig.  \n\n\nRosanna goes to Paul and asks him if he did call the police.  She is also surprised to learn that Craig went to see Paul yesterday.  Paul says, \"I did not call the cops.\"  He knows it would ruin her chances of adopting and he says he would never hurt her.  Paul \"sees\" James Stenbeck again who tells him to \"get his hooks into Rosanna.\"  \n\n\nDusty talks with Craig and says that it must have been Paul who called the police.  They are both in trouble with their respective significant others and Dusty says, \"Women in this town are control freaks, all of them.\"  They drink beer and toast to themselves.  Dusty runs to the back room while Jen walks in and tells Craig that he's busted and she has proof.  She calls out to Dusty and tells him what she has discovered just as Rosanna walks in and hears that Craig did make the call.\n\n\nKatie and Mike are separated.  Mike is thrown back into the cellar with no food or water and although he grabs for the gun, he loses the battle. He is knocked down and becomes furious throwing things around the room.  A shelf falls on him and as he lays on the ground, he imagines seeing Katie.  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Mordecai told Mike and Katie that he intended to leave Mike in the cellar to die, while he took Katie to Sydney. Mike was determined to find a way to escape. Susan visited Rick at the asylum, and was told that he only has moments of lucidity. During one of these moments, he told her he chose her as his target because she was beautiful, successful, lonely, and desperate. Hal provided Jen with the transcript of the 911 call the night of the bust at Java Underground. She raced straight to the bar with the proof that Craig ratted out his own business. Barbara told Hal she was worried about Jen, but he reminded her she was a grown woman. She told him that she believed that Paul was financing Andre, but admitted she had no proof. Hal warned her that she'd be sorry if she turned her kids against each other. Paul told Rosanna that he was not the one that made the 911 call. The \"James\" in Paul's head told him he missed a perfect opportunity to get to Craig and Dusty through Rosanna.",
