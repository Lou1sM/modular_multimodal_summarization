Winston brushed the concern aside, telling Henry not to worry and that he felt Maddie had been a good influence on Noah. Luke showed up, and Henry asked if Luke and Winston had met. Winston very abruptly excused himself to make a phone call. Henry wanted to know what that had been all about, and Luke said that he apparently rubbed the colonel the wrong way.\n\n\nHenry went over to refill Winston's coffee and mentioned Katie's upcoming bridal shower. Winston seemed to be suspicious when Henry stated that Katie -- a woman -- was his best friend. Winston asked Henry to suggest a healthy choice off the menu, as he was watching his weight. Henry remarked that Winston seemed to be in good shape, which drew another suspicious look from Winston. Winston said he needed to stay in shape so that when the day arrived that Noah got married, he could wear his dress blues.\n\n\nWinston went on to say that when they had moved to town, he and Noah hadn't known anyone and that he was very glad that his son had Maddie. Henry, who had grown suspicious of Winston's motives, pointed out that Noah did have other friends, like Luke, and that the three were very close. Henry asked Winston if Luke had done something to offend him. Winston replied that he knew Luke's \"type\" and didn't want his son to have anything to do with him. He then left rather abruptly.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Noah told Maddie that his father had paid for all their new bedroom furniture. Maddie questioned Winston's quick approval of her and Noah's living arrangements.\n\n\nHenry bumped into Noah and Maddie. After a brief introduction, Noah left to go to the apartment. Henry told Maddie that he needed to talk to her. He told her that he could finally afford to pay her tuition at Wesleyan. He didn't want her to give up on her dreams. Maddie told Henry that dreams changed; she had registered for classes at Oakdale University and was going to have a job at WOAK. Henry asked her who she was trying to convince, him or herself. She asked him what was wrong and questioned if he liked Noah.\n\n\nHenry told Maddie that Winston seemed to have a problem with gay people. He told Maddie that Winston had made it clear that he didn't like Noah and Luke hanging out together. Maddie didn't understand what the problem was, but Henry told her that he suspected Winston thought there was something going on between Noah and Luke. Maddie told Henry that was ridiculous. Henry agreed and offered to help her and Noah in any way he could.\n\n\nBack at WOAK, Maddie confronted Luke and asked him if there was something going on with him and Noah. He told her that he couldn't answer her question. Maddie replied, \"You just did.\" Luke tried to apologize and explain why he hadn't told her, but a devastated Maddie backed away, saying that she needed to talk to Noah about it. Luke agreed that she should do do that.\n\n\nAt Emma's, Meg told Craig that she was okay with them living there, but Craig told her that he wasn't. He told her that he could handle the lack of luxury at the farm, but he couldn't handle being a disappointment to her. Meg told him everything was fine and for him to go shower while she did her chores. When Craig went upstairs, she left.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, the maid delivered to Paul a framed photo of him and Meg. He asked her where she'd found it. She told him it had been in the guest room where Meg had been staying. A perplexed Paul asked her if that was where she always stayed -- not with Craig, which the maid confirmed. Meg then stormed in and told him that if he had a problem with her, he needed to leave Craig out of it.\n\n\nPaul asked if Craig had sent Meg there to fight his battles. She told him again how sorry she was for hurting him but that he wasn't sorry at all for allowing her to think he had been dead. Paul reminded her that she had moved on. Meg told him that she had done so because she'd thought he'd been dead. She told him that he was the one who had moved on -- just like that. Meg told him that if he, in fact, loved Rosanna, she didn't understand why he couldn't leave her and Craig alone.\n\n\nPaul told Meg that he couldn't just let her and Craig live in Rosanna's house and spend her money. Meg asked Paul where Rosanna was. He replied that she was busy handling her affairs. Meg questioned how Paul could have fallen back in love with Rosanna so quickly, to which he replied, \"... too sudden? That's quite an accusation from a woman who changes partners as often as you do.\" She told him that he was trying to convince himself that he didn't love her anymore, which he denied.\n\n\nMeg admitted that she still loved Paul. \"You're a married woman,\" he told her. \"What if I weren't? Would that make a difference?\" she asked. He asked her if she was thinking of leaving Craig. She asked him if that was what he wanted her to do. He told her it didn't matter because she was married.\n\n\nPaul reminded Meg that Craig's last wife had ended up in a coma for two years, and he said that he didn't want that to happen to her. Meg told him that was proof that he still cared about her. Paul said it just made him a decent guy -- unlike Craig. She told him that he had never stopped loving her. She kissed him, and he didn't pull away.\n\n\nAt the farm, Craig was fiddling with his cell phone when a gloating Lucinda interrupted and told him that she wouldn't be finished with him until she had her company back. He scoffed at that. She told him that Rosanna would give her the company back just to spite him and that Meg was going to dump him, since he was broke.\n\n\nLucinda told Craig that when Rosanna got her memory back, he would be going to jail. How painful it had to be, she said, when his wife and former wife were both in love with Paul. She asked him if he worried that Meg would run to Paul -- especially with Rosanna being out of town. She asked him where Meg was. A rattled Craig threw her out.\n\n\nOn the phone with his attorney, Craig received good news. He went outside to call for Meg, who he thought was doing chores in the barn. He realized that she was gone.\n\n\nAt the condo of the potential designing job, Carly was distracted and tired. Her prospective boss asked her if she had any ideas and questions and if she really wanted the job. Carly told him that she hadn't slept well the night before and that she just needed a little time alone in the space. He asked her if she would have something for him by the end of the day. She said yes, and he left. Carly, clearly weak, took some medication and sat down on the couch.\n\n\nIn Old Town, while waiting for the Realtor, Katie told Jack that she loved his kids but wanted them to have their own child. Jack told her that he was not sure about that. Katie told him that they needed to straighten that out before they got married. The Realtor showed up with a property for them to see, emphasizing to Katie how perfect it would be for the nursery that she had talked about and that a preschool would be opening in the building.\n\n\nThe Realtor took Jack and Katie to the property and told them it was in the midst of being redecorated. The condo was the same one that Carly was at. Jack and Katie told the Realtor that they wanted to look at it alone. The Realtor left. Katie tried to tell Jack that maybe they shouldn't bother looking at the condo. In the living room, Carly, who had been resting on the couch, awakened and heard their conversation.\n\n\nJack told Katie that he was unsure because his kids were going through a big transition, and having a new baby might make them feel left out. Katie told him that once he had the baby in his arms, he would feel different. He told Katie he wasn't saying not ever, just not at that moment. Katie then walked into the living room and saw the listening Carly sitting there. Carly tried to explain why she was there, but Katie wanted to know why she hadn't said something sooner.\n\n\nCarly denied intentionally eavesdropping. Carly assured them that she was no longer pursuing Jack, a man who no longer wanted her, and she didn't want them to think that was what she was doing. Carly told Katie that anyone could see that Jack loved her. Carly left.\n\n\nJack told Katie he believed that had been Carly's attempt at being civil, but Katie wasn't buying it. She thought that Carly had something over her; she had a child from Jack, and Katie never would. Katie said that she needed to know that he would at least think about it. He told her to give it a year. She worried that, in a year, if he didn't change his mind, she would have to give up on her hopes of having his child.\n\n\n",
