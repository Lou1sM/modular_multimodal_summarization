Bonnie promised that she would handle it and told Sarah to go hide on the third floor. Bonnie went to the police station and told Marshall that she would tell him where Sarah was if he would share permanent custody with Bonnie. Marshall and Bonnie argued and could not come to an agreement sharing custody. When Bonnie still refused to tell him where Sarah was, Marshall asked Hal to arrest her.  Meanwhile back at Jessica's house, Jessica came home to find Sarah in the living room. Jessica asked her why she doesn't want to live with Marshall. Sarah does not trust Marshall and said he treated her like she was 10 years old. And, Sarah doesn't understand why he never looked for her. Jessica told Sarah that Marshall had been looking for her but stopped when he was told that Sarah was dead. Jessica told Sarah about Marshall being blackmailed and shot. Jessica also told Sarah about her relationship with Marshall leaving out the part about the rape. Jessica said that even though Marshall has had problems in the past, he deserved the chance to be her father and that Sarah should give him that chance.  Later, at the police station, Bonnie was about to be arrested when Jessica walked in with Sarah.  Sarah told Marshall she got scared and that she was ready to go home with him. Bonnie looked at her mother confused and hurt. \n\n\nAt Java, Jennifer presented evidence that the call getting Dusty and Craig arrested came from Craig's cell phone as Rosanna listened from the door.  After words were exchanged Craig finally admitted to Rosanna that he called the police.  Before Craig had a chance to explain to Rosanna, she ran out with Craig following her.  Jennifer wanted an apology from Dusty. He didn't seem to think he needed to apologize.  Jennifer started to come on to him and Dusty rebuffed her advances. Jennifer backed off, extended her hand and said \"Friends?\"  After a few seconds, Dusty shook her hand.\n\n\nBarbara showed up at Paul's door to let him know that she was on to him about using Andreas to set her up so that Jennifer would not talk to her.  After they exchange accusatory remarks, Barbara said she would go to Jennifer with the information she has.  Paul told Barbara she was bluffing and that if she went to Jennifer it would only alienate Jennifer more and possibly turn Will against her as well.  Barbara said that he would never turn Will against her. Paul said he wouldn't have to she'd do that all on her own. Barbara warned Paul that he would not win this one and left. Paul tried to reach Andreas to cover his tracks when Jennifer walked in. Jennifer told Paul that Craig was the one who called the cops. Paul became more interested when he heard that Rosanna had found out.\n\n\nCraig caught up with Rosanna and tried to apologize.  Rosanna, totally crushed, doesn't understand why he would hurt her so badly when he knew how much she wanted a child. Craig asked her what he could do to try to make it better.  She said there was and it was non-negotiable.  She wants him to give up Java. Craig tried to talk her out of it but she said that if there was no baby, there was no business and she was pulling her money out of Java.  She walked away and told Craig not to follow her.  She went to the Lakeview where she started to drink.  Paul came up behind her and told her he heard what happened and comforted her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bonnie promised Sarah that even if she had to live with Marshall, he wouldn't keep Bonnie out of her life. She told a frantic Marshall that she would tell him where the girl was in exchange for shared custody. He refused, and ordered Hal to arrest her for kidnapping. Meanwhile, Jessica discovered the girl hiding in her apartment. After talking through her fears, she convinced Sarah to give living with Marshall a try. Jen showed Dusty, Rosanna, and Craig the proof that Craig had made the 911 call that got the club raided; he admits his guilt. She demanded an apology from Dusty, insisting she really does like him. He said she just needs to stay away. Rosanna was furious and hurt, but said that Craig could make things better by giving up the club. When he begged her not to make him give it up, she said she would just pull her money, instead. Overhearing this, Dusty threatened to beat up Craig. Barbara told Paul that she knew he had paid off Andre to set her up, and threatened to tell Jen. Paul tried to call Andre, then had a drink with Rosanna. Barbara went to see Jen, and told her that Paul is not all that he seems.",
