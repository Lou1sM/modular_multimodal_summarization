He told her that he'd heard her leaving the message for Dusty and wanted her to stay away from him and the murder investigation. He told her that if she kept doing things behind his back, they wouldn't have a marriage anymore. A phone call from Jack interrupted their conversation, and Holden had to go.\n\n\nLily told Holden that she would never do anything to deliberately hurt him or their family. He said he knew that. He left, and Lily received a phone call from the escort Krista, who said that she had information about Cheri's murder and wanted to meet in Old Town.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Lily was dressed in her escort clothes to meet Krista, who still doubted that Lily had really known Cheri. Lily said that she knew Cheri had been married and had had a child and that her name had been Charlene Wilson. Krista confirmed the information and seemed more trusting of Lily.\n\n\nKrista told Lily that Cheri had loved her son and that her husband had had a bad temper and had forced Cheri to leave her son. He'd told Cheri that if she ever tried to see her son again, he would make her regret it. Lily said she thought Cheri's husband had killed her, but Krista said she thought Cheri's son had because he had been angry over her career choice. Lily gave Krista money and told her to call if she got more information.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Lily asked the desk clerk to have Dusty meet her in the lounge. Holden arrived and saw Lily dressed in the escort clothes. He wanted to know why.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg was kissing Paul, but he pulled away. Meg told him that he'd felt that kiss. He told her he had felt something: pity for her being so desperate. Meg told him that he had feelings for her and that they still loved each other. Paul told her that the second she'd put Craig's ring on, whatever they'd had, had died. Meg told him that he needed to let go of his hate for Craig. He told her to leave.\n\n\nPaul threw the picture of him and Meg in the trash and angrily poured a drink. Rosanna arrived home with a surprise for him: she could walk again. She joyfully walked into his waiting arms, and they embraced. They moved closer to kiss, but Rosanna spotted lipstick on Paul's collar. Paul told her that Meg had been there and that there wasn't much to tell, but Rosanna asked how the lipstick had gotten there. He told her that she'd kissed him -- as a ploy to get Paul to back off of Craig. He told her that the kiss had meant nothing to Meg. Rosanna wanted to know if it had meant anything to Paul.\n\n\nPaul told Rosanna that when Meg had thought he'd been dead, she'd stayed married to Craig, and he no longer loved her. Rosanna questioned whether or not she would remain married to Craig, since Craig was broke. She wondered if maybe Meg had gone there that day because she wanted Paul back. Paul told Rosanna that he only wanted her.\n\n\nWhile Paul and Rosanna kissed, he remembered his kiss with Meg. He ignored those thoughts and told Rosanna that he couldn't believe she was there and how beautiful she was. She told him she wouldn't ever leave him again. He picked her up and took her upstairs.\n\n\nAt Emma's, Craig called out for Meg, but she wasn't there. J.J. told him that he had seen her drive away a half hour before. J.J. said that he knew Craig didn't like living there at the farm. Craig said that his lawyer had pulled through with money, so Craig and Meg could move out. Meg arrived at the farm. Craig demanded to know where she had been.\n\n\nMeg told Craig that she had gone to see Paul to get him to stop his vendetta against Craig. He asked what had happened. Meg, remembering the kiss, told him that nothing had happened, and she'd had no effect on him whatsoever. Craig wanted to know everything that had happened, and he felt that she was holding something back. Meg told Craig that Paul had changed since returning home with Rosanna.\n\n\nCraig pointed out that it wasn't the first time Paul had become obsessive about revenge. Meg said that it had never before been directed at her. She said she knew Paul's feelings for Rosanna were real. She told Craig that even though she had rejected him, Craig had never given up on her. He told her that he had tried to give up on her, but he couldn't, and he never would. They kissed.\n\n\nCraig gave Meg the good news that some of his assets had been unfrozen and that Rosanna and Paul wouldn't keep them down. Meg told him that they would try, but Craig said that as long as he had her by his side, he could handle anything. He embraced her, but she looked uneasy.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Jack told Katie there was no guarantee he would change his mind about having a baby with her. He was worried about what his kids had just been through, especially with Carly. Katie told him that it was always about Carly, and she wanted them to have a baby so, for once, it wouldn't be about Jack and Carly, but instead about Jack and Katie. Jack told her it was Katie who was making everything about Carly. He told her that she wanted to have his baby so she would be even with Carly.\n\n\nKatie told Jack that she had wanted to have his child since they had fallen in love. He told her that they needed to just give it time and that it would all work out. She told him that she feared she was giving up her dream, but Jack told her to focus on their bridal shower and wedding. She agreed and left to go shopping.\n\n\nAt Henry's diner, Jack met Holden and told him that he feared having his children's lives turned upside down by having a new baby. Holden pointed out that having a new baby might make his family feel more secure. He told Jack that having Ethan had helped them all a lot while Lily had been in the coma. Jack said he cherished his memories of when Sage had been born. Holden left, saying he had to go take care of something and that he felt Jack did too. Alone, Jack said to himself, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\nAt a clothing store in Old Town, Carly picked out a black dress, but she remembered Jack's hurtful words and put it back. In the dressing room mirror, Carly's image talked to her. It told her that buying a new dress wouldn't solve anything because Jack didn't love her anymore. She told her image that she wasn't doing it for Jack, but for herself.\n\n\nKatie showed up at the shop and found a dress she liked, but she didn't have enough cash and left to go to the ATM. Carly walked out of the dressing room, saw the dress at the register, and wanted to buy it. The saleslady told her that someone else was going to buy it, but Carly insisted on trying the dress on. Katie returned and saw Carly wearing the dress. She asked why Carly was wearing her dress. Carly said that Katie could have it.\n\n\nKatie asked Carly why she tried to take everything Katie had. She accused Carly of intentionally eavesdropping, and since Carly learned about Katie and Jack's disagreement over having a baby, Katie feared Carly would try to stop the wedding. Carly asked if Katie was insane. Carly said that she had been doing everything possible to steer clear of both Katie and Jack. Carly insisted that if anything screwed up the wedding, it wouldn't be her, and if Katie lost Jack, she would have no one to blame but herself. Carly left to change out of the dress.\n\n\nCarly tossed the dress to Katie, which resulted in her wish bracelet breaking off. Carly asked if Katie was going to blame her for that too. A flustered Katie left. Carly then became dizzy and asked the saleslady for some water.\n\n\nOutside the store, Katie tearfully remembered when Jack had given her the bracelet and thought that her dreams of having a baby with Jack were over. Jack found her there and told her that he indeed did want to have a baby with her.\n\n\nJack left to get something from his car. While he was gone, Katie noticed a disoriented Carly standing nearby. She accused Carly again of eavesdropping and gleefully told her that Katie and Jack were going to have a baby after all. A weak Carly gave her congratulations. Jack returned and noticed that Carly wasn't right. He asked what was going on. Carly then fainted. An unbelieving Katie rolled her eyes.\n\n\n",
