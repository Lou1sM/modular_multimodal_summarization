    "soap_central": "\n\nWhen Dusty confronts Jennifer about her crystal meth use, she lashes out, \"Who the hell are you to tell me what to do?\"  Near hysterical in her need for the drug, she continues, \"If you breathe a word of this to anyone, we are finished!\"  Determined to confront her, Dusty shows Jen that she is \"creating\" the same design over and over.  Jennifer screams that she is quitting Street Jeans, and orders Dusty out of Barbara's suite.  As soon as Dusty leaves, Jennifer swallows handfuls of prescription antidepressants.  Barbara returns to the suite and is surprised when Jen suggests that the two of them go back into business together.  Jennifer desperately spins a story, telling her mother that Dusty has become so possessive that she must sever their business relationship.  She even warns Barbara that she is afraid that Dusty might lash out at her in some way.  Just then, Dusty calls and asks Barbara if he can come up and talk with her.  When he arrives, he shows Barbara the crystal meth he took from the drug dealer, as Jennifer listens from the next room.  Although Barbara defends her daughter and ushers Dusty out the door, she begins watching Jennifer carefully.\n\n\nGwen arouses after being drugged by Carly to find baby Rory missing.  When Carly arrives with Nancy Hughes, she calls the police, and Gwen frantically calls Will.  The fellow who sold Carly the \"bottled water\" returns Rory, saying he found the pram abandoned around the corner.  Margo arrives to question Gwen and asks Gwen what she had to eat and drink.  Gwen accuses Carly of drugging her water bottle, and Carly retaliates by demanding that Margo arrest Gwen for endangering Rory.  Margo easily talks Carly out of arresting Gwen, since Carly's objective is only to retain custody of the baby.  After everyone else leaves, the water vendor returns and Carly pays him for his help.  He assures Carly that he has switched water bottles, leaving a clean bottle in the pram for the police to check.\n\n\nHolden comforts Lily, who is both disappointed in Keith and frightened for Lucinda, when she discovers that Keith has flown her mother to the clinic in Mexico.  When they cannot find Luke, Holden and Lily meet a friend of Luke's at Java.  Luke's friend tells them that he gave Luke a fake ID so that Luke could buy a bottle of vodka.  Meanwhile, in Mexico, Keith tells Lucinda that he has told Lily that Lucinda is there at the clinic, and that they must leave as soon as possible so that he can go home to explain to Lily that he has been transporting human organs illegally.  When Keith and Lucinda arrive at the airplane, they find Luke's backpack and an empty bottle of vodka.  Keith leaves to try to find Luke, leaving a weak Lucinda in the plane with his gun, with orders to \"shoot first and ask questions later.\"  Lucinda quickly calls Lily and Holden to tell them what has happened, but their phone connection fails before the conversation can go any further.  Lucinda hears a noise at the door of the plane.  Keith goes to the clinic and hears someone (maybe Luke) screaming in pain, just before someone knocks him out.\n\n\n",

Dusty meets with Barbara, to let her in on Jen's extra curricular activities. Barbara, who has already been manipulated by Jen, doesn't believe Dusty's words, but can't hide her concern with his words. Score one for Jen though!
