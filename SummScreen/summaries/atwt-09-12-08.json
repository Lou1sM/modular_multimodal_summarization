When she saw Carly and Holden laughing together, Lily used her cell phone to call Mike and ask why he hadn't met her for their planned romantic rendezvous after the wedding. Mike apologized but said Emma's errand had turned into a nightmare. Lily told Mike he would have to make it up to her, and she suggested meeting in 30 minutes at the Lakeview. Mike agreed, and Lily hung up and went back home. \n\n\nWhen Lily arrived back home, she saw Faith talking on her cell phone. Upset, Lily told Faith she was going to be late for school, but Faith informed her mother that it was teacher conference day, so the kids had the day off. Lily verified that on her school calendar and then asked Faith to watch Natalie and Ethan for a couple more hours so that she could run some errands. Faith protested that she had a big science project to work on, so Lily called Holden and left a message asking him to come over to watch the kids. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Meg called Barbara and told her she was worried because Paul had apparently been out all night. Paul walked in, and Meg asked if he was okay. Paul assured her that he was. He went to take a shower, and then Meg questioned him as to his whereabouts the night before. Paul admitted to having gone back to the work site. Mike burst into the room and demanded to know why Paul had continued digging at the site, saying they would have to have the whole site condemned as a result of the damage. Paul denied having done any more digging, but Mike shook his head and told Meg that obviously, Paul hadn't changed after all. \n\n\nMike stormed out, and Meg asked why Paul had lied to Mike. Paul was upset that Meg didn't believe him. She asked why he'd been covered in dirt; Paul said he'd fallen into a ditch. He told Meg he didn't want to disappoint her, but she told him saving the development project wasn't worth it if it made him crazy. \n\n\nBarbara arrived at Fairwinds, and Meg apologized for not having called her back to tell her Paul was okay. Barbara asked Meg to let her have a few minutes alone with Paul. When she found out that Paul hadn't found the money James said was buried at the work site, Barbara told Paul she thought James had come back to Oakdale to drive Paul insane. Paul showed Barbara the bar of gold that James had given him and told Barbara he did believe there was gold buried at the farm. He said he needed Barbara to help him by giving him a cover story so he could find the gold, pay back Derek, and then pay James back with Barbara's other money when it became available, so that they could get James out of their lives. Barbara said she knew better than that, and so did Paul. \n\n\nPaul told his mother that he wanted Meg to continue to believe he would be a good father. When Meg walked into the room and saw that Paul was preparing to leave again, she asked where he was going. Barbara looked at her son and then told Meg she had convinced Paul to go with her to meet with Dr. Michaels, the psychiatrist at the hospital, to discuss ways to alleviate the stress Paul was feeling. Meg was impressed that Barbara had gotten Paul to agree to that. Barbara and Paul left, and Meg received a call from Dr. Schiller's office, reminding her that she had an appointment that morning. Meg said she had forgotten about it but would leave right away to go to the hospital. \n\n\nMike went to the Lakeview to meet Lily. He told her about the magnitude of the problems at the farm, and she led him upstairs to help him forget his troubles. They made love. Meanwhile, back at home, Ethan wanted Faith or Natalie to play with him, but Faith had to do her schoolwork, and Natalie was mad because Ethan had torn the head off of one of her dolls. Faith gave Ethan a ball and told him to play with it. \n\n\nLily and Mike ran into Holden in the lobby at the Lakeview, and Lily asked where the kids were. Holden said he thought they were at school. Lily said they had the day off, and she had left Holden a message asking him to watch them for her because she had things to do. Holden said he'd left his cell phone at the farm and had never gotten her message. Lily told Mike she would have to go home, but Holden sarcastically told her to finish what she was doing, and he would go home to check on the kids. \n\n\nPaul went to the construction site and found that Mike had boarded up the cavernous hole Paul had dug and put yellow tape around the area for safety reasons. Paul tore through the tape and began pulling the boards up, uncovering the hole once again. Paul received a call from Meg, who explained that she was at the hospital for an appointment. Meg asked if Paul was finished with his appointment with Dr. Michaels and could meet her for her appointment with Dr. Schiller. Paul told Meg to stay where she was, and he would meet her. He left the construction site, leaving the huge hole still uncovered. \n\n\nHolden arrived at the house and found Faith and Natalie, but Ethan was nowhere in sight. When Holden asked where Ethan was, Faith said she'd just seen him. They began searching for Ethan but had no luck finding him. \n\n\nLily told Mike that even though she felt that she had covered the child-care situation by leaving Holden a message, she felt guilty for having left the kids unattended for so long. Mike assured her she hadn't done anything wrong, but Lily felt guilty anyway and left to go home to check on the children. Lily returned home, and Holden told her Ethan was missing. Meanwhile, Ethan played with his ball near the large hole at the construction site. He took off one sneaker and left it on the ground, then walked over by the deep hole. \n\n\nBrad ran into Jack in Old Town and told him he had informed Margo that he wouldn't let Liberty press charges against Leo, so the case should be dropped. Jack told Brad to shut up. Brad thought Jack was being harsh, but Jack said he hadn't done what he'd done for Brad's benefit and that Brad should never talk to him about it again. \n\n\nMargo went to the diner to talk to Janet, who worried that Margo knew something about the evidence she and Jack had hidden for Brad's benefit. However, Margo had come to ask Janet to let Liberty testify against Leo. Janet said she agreed with Brad that Liberty shouldn't be put through that. Margo tried to persuade Janet that they were making the wrong decision, and ultimately, after realizing Margo was speaking from personal experience, Janet told Margo she would try to convince Brad to let Liberty testify. \n\n\nJanet went to WOAK and told Brad she thought Liberty should press charges against Leo, so that Liberty would learn to stand up for herself. Brad objected and said as Liberty's father, he had stood up for her. Brad convinced Janet that it was more important for Liberty to have her dad in her life than to go after Leo and risk having Brad locked up for assault, given that Leo had survived. \n\n\nBrad told Janet to go home and forget the whole thing, but she said that wasn't easy for her to do, because Jack had given her the stolen evidence to hide, and it was killing Jack. Brad told Janet to give him the evidence so he could destroy it, and they could put the whole thing behind them. Janet told Brad how much Jack had done for her and said she didn't want to lose him. Brad assured her she wouldn't, and Janet told him the evidence was behind her mirror at the farm. \n\n\nCarly went to the police station and told Jack they needed to talk. She took him to Yo's, where she knew they wouldn't be interrupted, and told Jack her suspicions about Brad, Leo, and the missing evidence. She told Jack to look her in the eye and tell her if she was wrong. When he couldn't, Carly asked why Jack would risk everything for his brother when he wouldn't do it for his own son. \n\n\nJack told Carly he hated that he hadn't done anything to help Parker's case. Carly said that as mad as she was at the time, she was also grateful that Jack had remained the one person she could count on to do what was right. Carly told Jack he could not keep up the deception, because it wasn't who he was. \n\n\nCarly asked what he was going to do; Jack answered, \"Don't you know?\" Together, they went to the farm, where they found Brad and Janet, who had just burned the evidence implicating Brad. When Jack told Janet he needed the papers back, she said it was too late. When Jack protested, Brad said he didn't know why Jack was getting so bent out of shape, since he wasn't going to use the evidence. As he looked at Jack, Brad realized that Jack had indeed intended to use the evidence after all. Brad accused Jack of having been willing to leave Liberty without a father just so he could sleep at night. Carly told Brad to shut up. \n\n\nJanet tried to tell Jack she thought she'd been doing him a favor by getting rid of the evidence. Irate, Jack shouted that he hadn't asked Janet to do him any favors. Jack left, telling Carly there was only one thing he could do. Janet cornered Carly on the porch and accused her of having orchestrated Jack's desire to retrieve the evidence, both because Jack had been willing to lie for Janet but not for Carly and to prove that Carly knew better than Janet what Jack needed. \n\n\nJack went to the police station, where he met with Margo in an interrogation room and told her he had stolen the missing evidence in the Leo Morrissey case. Jack said the evidence had been destroyed, and he took full responsibility for it. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "All of the digging for gold bars that Paul did at the work site leaves structural damage too far to be repaired. Meg is upset that Paul is acting strange, and Barbara fears that James is trying to drive Paul insane. Carly helps Jack see that hiding the evidence is against everything that he stands for and that he won't be able to live with himself if he doesn't come clean. He agrees, but Janet & Brad have already destroyed the evidence. Jack comes clean to Margo. Lily leaves a message with Holden to come watch the kids while she goes off to meet Mike at the hotel for a tryst, but he doesn't get the message, and by the time the parents arrive home, Ethan is missing. Playing alone at the construction site, Ethan chases a ball into the deep hole.",
