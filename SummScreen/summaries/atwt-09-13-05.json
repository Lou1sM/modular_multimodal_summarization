Paul persuades Cass to stay but to keep Paul's name out of it. Meanwhile, Jack confronts Carly about what happened. Jack finds it too convenient that this happened right before the next custody hearing, and that it is very similar to what happened to Iris's baby. Carly begs Jack just to support her through the next hearing, but he sends her up to bed alone. Meanwhile, Emily meets with Margo and learns things look bad for Gwen. Later, Margo questions whether moving Daniel into the penthouse with Paul is a wise decision and Emily orders Margo to mind her own business.

Mike confides in Katie that he thinks Henry sent the sweater and the flowers, and is faking his injury. Inside, Maddie slips up and Henry forces her to come clean about Byron.

    "tvmega_recap": "Mike tells Henry that he will help him anyway he can, after seeing that Henry's MRI came back clear. He asks Henry if there is another reason, beside the supposed back pain he is having, that makes him unable to move forward out of Katie's house? The guilt is getting to Henry who wants to tell Mike the truth. Maddie (as Katie) continues her online flirtation with Byron, which leads to him send Katie another anonymous gift. When Maddie is cornered into telling Henry her plan for Byron, Henry bans her from using her computer, and goes to lock it in the limo, and in the process runs right smack dab into Katie and Mike, who are talking on the steps about whether or not Henry can really walk unassisted. Guess that question was answered! Gwen thinks the whole town is against her attempts to get her baby back, and Will is worried more and more she is acting irrational. When he voices his concern, they argue and Will storms out. When Casey later sees Will in the park, he tries to salvage their friendship. Carly is sure that her plan will be successful in making sure the judge rules in her favor. Emily and Paul worry about what this means for their cover up. So, Paul comes to Gwen's rescue by funding more of Cass' fees, plus a bonus, to make sure Gwen wins back her baby. Meanwhile, Jack tries to get Carly to see what she is doing to Gwen. She is screwing up her life in order to make up for what supposedly happened to Iris' son. Carly thinks Jack should just accept that fate is going to keep Rory with them. Jack isn't sure what he wants to do with the information he knows about Carly.",
