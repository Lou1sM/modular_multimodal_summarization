Meanwhile, Lily arrived at the farm and found Luke working on his writing. Noah showed up, and Luke introduced them. Lily could see the awkwardness between them, so when Noah said he needed to talk to Luke, she said she'd go outside for a while. Noah asked Luke what he had said to Maddie, and Luke said he hadn't said anything but that Maddie had gone to him, \"knowing what you didn't want her to know,\" and he had told her to talk to Noah herself. Noah told Luke that he was not like Luke, and Luke agreed, saying he was happy with who he was.\n\n\nNoah left and found Maddie at WOAK. He confronted her, and she told him she was mad because he'd used her to get acceptance from his father. Maddie said she didn't care if Noah was straight, or gay, or bisexual, or if he was attracted to Luke, but when she asked, \"And you are, aren't you?\" Noah finally replied, \"Yes.\" She told him that was okay, but the way he had treated her was not okay. He asked if she could forgive him and they could move on, because he cared for her and wanted to get past the issue. Maddie said, \"Because I mean that much to you?\" Noah said yes, but Maddie replied, \"Or I mean that much to your father?\"\n\n\nBack at the farm, Lily asked Luke what was wrong, and he told her he had basically outed Noah to Maddie. He didn't think Lily really wanted to talk about it, but she insisted she was okay with it, so he told her Noah's dad was strict military and wouldn't be accepting if Noah came out to him about being gay. He said even Noah didn't want it to be true, and he told his mom that while he'd liked other guys before, it was the first time someone had felt that way about him.\n\n\nMaddie went to the diner, where she told Henry that he had been right about his suspicions about Noah and Luke, and she'd broken up with Noah because of it and had said some mean things to him to keep him from seeing how much she really cared about him. She told Henry she apparently wasn't meant to have someone to love and spend her life with, but Henry pointed out that her two previous relationships were not quite a \"history.\" He told her the missing ingredient with her in her relationships had been magic, saying she hadn't had that with either Casey or Noah. He told her that the right guy was out there somewhere.\n\n\nNoah went to the Lakeview to meet his dad for dinner. His dad assumed Maddie was simply late, but Noah said they'd broken up. His dad insisted that was not possible, saying they'd just had a fight and that Noah needed to do whatever it took to straighten it out with Maddie. Noah asked what would happen if he couldn't change, but when his father asked him to repeat what he'd just said, Noah backpedaled and asked what would happen if he and Maddie couldn't change whatever was wrong between them.\n\n\nAt that moment, Luke walked into the room, having gone to the Lakeview with his mom at her suggestion. He was alone because Lily had spotted an auditor she needed to talk to quickly. Noah's dad saw Noah looking at Luke, and he got up, marched over to Luke, and warned Luke to stay away from his son, \"or you will be dealing with me, and you will not like that!\" The colonel left, and Luke approached Noah to apologize, but Noah said, \"Just leave me alone!\" and walked out.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty had a drink with Tom Hughes and discussed the police's failure to look for another suspect in Cheri's murder. Dusty said he has an alternative theory involving an abusive husband and a child, but Tom said he'd need evidence to get anyone to listen to such a theory. He told Dusty they should run it by the district attorney. Dusty said he would after he had more evidence, and Tom cautioned him to be careful not to do anything illegal at that point.\n\n\nWhen Dusty acted like he knew more than the cops, Tom left, saying they had a word for people who thought they were smarter than cops: convicts. Dusty called his private investigator and arranged to meet him in his room. The private eye gave Dusty a folder, saying he'd found Charlene Wilson and that she'd had a domestic battery charge against her husband in 1988 in Fort Gordon, Georgia -- and there had been an infant involved. Dusty looked for the husband's name and found it in the file: Lieutenant Winston Mayer.\n\n\nJack arrived at the hospital and found Carly, Sage, and the doctor, who was finishing up putting stitches in Sage's forehead. He assured Jack that Sage would be fine, but someone needed to wake her up every hour or so overnight in case she had a concussion. Jack asked Brad to please take Sage to the cafeteria to get some dessert, since she had missed the wedding shower. Before leaving, Brad asked Carly how she was doing, something Jack hadn't done, and she thanked him for asking. He left with Sage, and Jack asked Carly what had happened.\n\n\nCarly said she didn't really know, but she'd been depressed and probably shouldn't have been driving. However, Sage had been concerned about how Carly would feel about Sage liking Katie, so she'd wanted to prove to Sage that she was okay with Sage loving Katie, too, by taking her to the wedding shower. Jack worried that Carly was not in control of herself anymore and that she was too depressed about him marrying Katie.\n\n\nCarly told Jack she'd like to go home and rest and not discuss it anymore that night because she had a headache. He said he'd take Sage home with him so Carly could rest, and she told him not to try to pretend that he would have left Sage with her anyway. She told him to go ahead and take Sage and apologize to Katie for her and tell the boys she was okay. Jack asked, \"But are you really?\"\n\n\nSage and Brad returned, and Carly told Sage she got to go home with Jack for the night. Sage asked if Carly was really okay, and she said yes. Sage told Jack the nurse needed some paperwork signed, so he and Sage left. Brad stayed, and the doctor entered and told Carly that some of the initial tests they had run had him concerned about her. He wanted her to contact a neurologist in the morning, and he gave her the doctor's card, saying he didn't think it was related to the accident.\n\n\nWhen the doctor asked if Carly had been having headaches or dizzy spells, Carly denied it. Brad jumped in to tell the doctor the truth, but Jack showed up, so Carly cut Brad off mid-sentence. The doctor left, saying he'd be in his office if she wanted to talk some more, and Jack wanted to know what was wrong. Carly asked Brad to get Sage so Carly could reassure her that she was okay then told Jack the doctor had just said her headache had made her pass out but that it wouldn't happen again. Brad shook his head but left, and Jack wanted to know if Carly was lying to him.\n\n\nCarly said she just didn't want Jack to tell Sage he thought her mom was losing control. Sage and Brad returned, and Carly gave Sage a goodbye hug after assuring the girl that she was okay. Brad asked why she hadn't told Jack that something was wrong with her, because she shouldn't have to go through it alone. Carly said she was not alone, that \"God, in His wisdom, has given me you.\" Brad said he was useless, and she should still tell Jack, but Carly said she didn't want to, because whenever she told Jack, it would make whatever was wrong with her more real, and she was not ready for that yet.\n\n\nBrad drove Carly home and refused to leave unless she called Jack and told him what was going on. She told Brad not to blackmail her and threatened to call the cops. He told her to put his number on speed dial on her cell phone so she could call him if she needed him, and then he'd leave. She tossed the phone at him, and he entered his number then pretended to leave but instead settled himself down in a chair on her porch.\n\n\nAt the diner, Katie found out from Margo on the phone that Sage was going to be okay and that Carly didn't know exactly what had happened, but Margo mentioned that there were no skid marks that would indicate Carly had swerved or braked hard to avoid hitting something. Henry suggested Carly had done it as a way to pull Jack back in, but Katie insisted Carly wouldn't put Sage in jeopardy like that. Henry was impressed that Katie was being so generous with her thoughts, and Katie said she actually felt bad for Carly, who had lost a lot.\n\n\nShe met Jack back at the farm, where Jack told her that it was worse than being mad at Carly; he was actually scared for her. Katie assured him they would get through it together.\n\n\n",
