Susan, after insisting that she will be fine, pulls a pint of vodka from her purse.  Alison has trouble relaxing because she is so worried about Susan, but the attraction between Alison and Chris distracts her from thoughts of Susan.  At home, Susan pours herself a glass of vodka.  Chris and Alison run into Henry and Chris offers Henry $100 for three hours at his house, and the two young lovers excitedly leave for Henry's.  However, Alison begs Chris to let her stop and check on Susan first.  Back at home, Susan catches herself in time - she pours the contents of the glass into a potted plant, then stashes the vodka bottle, half full, back in her purse.  When Alison and Chris arrive at Susan's, they call for Susan, but she doesn't answer.  Alison decides to leave a note for Susan, but she can't find a pen, so she opens Susan's purse!  She finds the half-empty bottle, and cries to Chris, \"My mother is in trouble.\"\n\n\nAlthough Jessica swears to Bonnie that she is on her side, she asks Bonnie to move out of her house because the two disagree so strongly about Sara.  Bonnie declares that if she moves out she won't come back.  Bonnie sobs to Jessica that not only has she lost Sara, but now she has lost her mother too.  Jessica leaves, and Bonnie packs her things to go stay with Lisa for a few days.  As she is about to leave, Isaac comes to the door and informs Bonnie that he is leaving for Florida to go into a business with a friend who owns a few clubs there.  Bonnie tearfully wishes him good luck.  Jessica runs directly to Ben, who is bare-chested and ready for bed.  Ben holds Jessica against his muscular chest and comforts her, and Jessica tells him that she is ready to make love to him.\n\n\nMolly gives Craig a check to keep Java Underground afloat, and her only condition is that no one ask her why she chose to make the investment.  In return, Craig asks Molly to keep the fact that the money came from her a secret from Rosanna until he has time to tell Rosanna.  Molly agrees to keep quiet about her investment, although she tells Craig that she will not lie if someone asks her a direct question.  Craig gives Molly a key to Java, since she is now a part owner.  While Molly and Craig are meeting, Carly visits Rosanna in her garden and tells her that she heard Craig ask Molly to replace the money Rosanna withdrew.  Rosanna, shaken, tells Carly that by tonight, everything will be resolved one way or the other.  She explains to Carly how she intends to confront Craig, and Carly promises to support her.  Just as Carly leaves Rosanna, Craig calls Rosanna to tell her that he has some news.  When Craig arrives in the garden, he tells Rosanna that Dusty has found financing, but that Craig doesn't know the details.  Rosanna turns away from Craig, then gently cries to him that he is losing her because of his lies.  She begs him to tell her the truth, because she cannot stay married to a man who lies and manipulates.\n\n\nAfter Dusty and Jennifer share a passionate kiss at Java Underground, she tells him that she wants to be with him that night.  Dusty protests that he is still emotionally attached to Rose, and further, he is a little suspicious of Jennifer's motives, since she is Paul's sister.  Jennifer tearfully confesses to Dusty that Paul betrayed her, and tells Dusty that she doesn't want to be a liar like her mother and her brother.  Dusty gives in and the two share a tender kiss, when Molly bursts in saying, \"This certainly is an interesting return on my investment.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Alison and Chris left for a date, Susan poured herself a drink. Thinking better of it, she poured it out and put the bottle back in her purse. After paying off Henry to let them use the cottage for a few hours, Alison and Chris stopped by to check on Susan, and Alison found the bottle. Jessica told Bonnie it was best that she move out, then cried on Ben's shoulder. He told her it was time that she lead her own life; she said she was ready to feel safe with him again, and said she wanted him to make love to her. Isaac told Bonnie that they were through, and that he was leaving town. Molly agreed to finance the Java Underground renovations. Craig said that no one must know that she invested, not realizing that Carly had already spilled the beans to Rosanna. When Craig lied to her and said that Dusty was working on financing, Rosanna said that she needed honesty, and couldn't stay married to Craig. Jen told Dusty that Paul had lied to her, and she no longer trusted him. She said that she knew Dusty wouldn't lie to her, and begged him to make love to her. At first, he resisted, but started to give in, just as Molly walked in on their kiss.",
