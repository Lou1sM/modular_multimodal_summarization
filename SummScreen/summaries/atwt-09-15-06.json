    "soap_central": "\n\nSimon, who is getting drunker by the minute, tries to get Carly to drink her long, tall drink of \"alcohol, alcohol, and more alcohol,\" so that she can forget all about her new divorce and her ex-husband, Jack. He then goes to try to get the lounge to change the music they're playing, and Carly takes that opportunity to go to the bar and exchange her drink for a rum and cola. While waiting for the new drink, she picks up a Tarot card lying on the bar, and a woman comes up behind the bar and tells Carly that she knows what she needs by the card she just picked up; Carly turns it over and sees that it's a man and a woman locked in a passionate embrace. When the next card is turned over, it shows a half-full or half-empty cup, and the woman tells Carly this means she's suffered the loss of something precious but that the future will bring much joy, if she'll let it. Carly sees Simon dancing with another woman, and she catches his eye, getting him to come dance with her instead. They do a very intimate dance, and when Simon asks if she wants to go upstairs, she agrees. In the hotel room, they kiss passionately before Carly puts the brakes on, telling Simon she's not sure about this; Simon tells her he'll stop if she really wants him to, but after a moment's hesitation, she grabs him and kisses him again.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Lucinda questions Lucy about why she doesn't want to see Dusty again; Lucy has several reasons, including the age difference and the fact that Craig is her father and Johnny's father, too. Lucinda doesn't seem to think that's an issue since Dusty is Johnny's legal father now. She tries to get Lucy to change her mind, but Lucy says she's just going to go see a movie by herself. At the movie theater, though, she literally bumps into Dusty, spilling his popcorn in the process; when she asks why he's there, he reminds her that he loves the \"AstroGirl\" movies and never misses one. They end up sitting together, sharing Lucy's popcorn, drink, and red licorice and engaging in some friendly banter.\n\n\nAt the church where the memorial is being held for the murdered teens, Jade is telling Will she's pregnant. Will overhears Gwen talking with the Hughes family and Barbara, saying they're ready to go into the church now, so he grabs Jade, and they run out of the main part of the church. Will asks Jade when she found out she was pregnant; she tells him she was 2 weeks late but had attributed it to stress at first, but she took a home pregnancy test the day before and then went to the local family health clinic to confirm it with a doctor. When Will protests that he had used a condom, she says if he thinks she's lying about it, he can call the doctor himself, and she offers Will the number. Will declines and asks what she intends to do. Jade says she can't have an abortion, because if her own mother had done that instead of giving her up for adoption, she wouldn't be here today; Will asks about adoption, but Jade says her own experience with that was so unpleasant, she can't imagine doing that to a child. She has therefore decided to have the baby and raise it herself, and she tells Will he can be as involved or uninvolved as he wants to be. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Bob and Kim Hughes arrive for the service, and Barbara has Gwen tell them the happy news that she and Will have reconciled. Dallas and Jessica arrive, as do Tom and Margo, and Casey brings Maddie in; Gwen walks up and hugs her. Maddie sees the photos of the murdered teens up on the altar and runs out of the church in anguish. Casey tries to follow her, but Margo stops him, saying she'll go instead. Casey sits back down with Tom. Margo sits down with Maddie in her suite at the Lakeview. Maddie tells Margo that when she was growing up, seeing Eve's purse on the table when she got home from school meant that everything would be okay, that Eve would put their mom to bed and make dinner for everyone. She tells Margo that Eve never used to hate her, but now she does, and she is trying to accept the fact that Eve is sick; she tells Margo that the doctors said Eve had a psychotic break and might never recover from it. She blames herself, and Margo lays out Maddie's theory for why none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for Maddie; Maddie is amazed that Margo knows just what she's thinking about this, but Margo says feeling guilt is normal, and that she feels guilty every time someone she works with or someone she's supposed to protect is hurt, and she felt guilty after she was raped, too, because it gave her some kind of control in a situation in which she'd felt helpless. But she reminds Maddie that both her rapist and Louis were the ones who made the choice to hurt them, that it was Louis's fault, not Maddie's, and that one day, Maddie will recover and go to college and meet someone and get married. Maddie disagrees, saying she feels like no one's ever going to want her, and she doesn't know how to change that feeling. Margo tells her to surround herself with family and people she can talk to and give it time, and she invites Maddie to move back into her house.\n\n\nIn another part of the church, Will and Jade can hear that the service is about to start, and Jade says they'd better get in there. She leaves first and goes in to sit by Luke, and Will goes around to the back of the church and walks up to join Gwen and Barbara in the front pew. Bob Hughes stands up and says he was asked to speak because he knew each of the teens who died, having seen them as babies and throughout their young lives. He mentions something personal about each of them and then says he's always heard that the spirit lives on in each of us, and the life force survives in every baby that is born. Hearing that, Will jumps up and leaves the church, and Gwen follows, asking him outside what's wrong. She assumes he's having trouble because of his recent loss of his sister, but he says that's not it. She tells him he can tell her anything, saying there's nothing he can do now that will make her stop loving him. She tells him they'll have a future together, that they'll move back in together, go to college, graduate, adopt some kids, and in a few years, they'll have a family together. As Jade peeks out of the church door, Gwen asks Will what it is that has him so upset.\n\n\nBack inside, Bob says that he and the Reverend had agreed that if anyone wanted to sing a special song or get up and say a few words, it would be a good thing. Casey stands up and says that they'll all miss their friends and will feel angry about what happened, but they need to place the blame for it where it belongs, with Louis and Eve, and not blame Maddie. He points out that she's been badly hurt by those closest to her and needs their support, and he says anyone who can't offer that to her will have to answer to him.\n\n\n",
