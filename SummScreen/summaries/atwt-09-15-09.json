Damian discouraged Lily from getting up her hopes that Holden was still alive.  Lily was weak and unsteady on her feet, so Damian insisted that he take her to see a doctor.  He also took a call from Meg, who said that she needed to see him right away.  Damian said that it would be a while before he could get to the farm, but he promised to go when he could.  Lily told him that he was not going to accompany her to the doctor and that he needed to go take care of Meg.\n\n\nLily promised that she would see Susan Stewart because she was sick of feeling tired.  She also told Damian that he could call her later, but she did not want him to return.  Lily kept her word and saw Susan at the hospital, and she talked about her grief.  Susan asked if Lily was sleeping, but Lily said that she could only sleep for very short periods of time.\n\n\nSusan said that she would prescribe something that would make her sleep, but Lily was hesitant because of her previous addiction problem.  Susan understood, and said she would only give Lily a few pills, and she also recommended that Lily think of the good times with her husband while she was trying to fall asleep.\n\n\nLily went home and got into bed.  She swallowed one of the prescription pills and lay down next to Holden's picture.  She fell asleep, but soon thought she heard Holden talking to her.  When she opened her eyes, Holden was sitting on the end of their bed.  Lily was overjoyed that he was alive, but Holden asked her to follow him.  Lily got up and walked out of the bedroom.\n\n\nVienna delivered  breakfast pastries to Henry, along with a promise of fun with whipped cream as a postprandial romp. Henry was in a hurry and said that he was sorry, but he had a meeting at the lawyer's office to sign the inheritance papers.  Vienna tried to pin him down as to what his plans for the money were, but Henry was slippery.  He said he would love to give the money to Audrey, but he did not want to be disrespectful to James's memory.\n\n\nVienna calmly announced that she was leaving Henry, even though she loved him dearly, and she got out her suitcase. Henry tried to talk with Vienna, but she said that it was a matter of self-respect; Henry did not seem able to keep his promises.  Vienna begged him to give the money to his mother, but Henry reminded her that dear old mom had murdered dear old dad.  Next, Vienna suggested that he give the money to charity, but Henry was reluctant to part with what he viewed as a house with a pool, a sauna, and room for a pony.  Vienna asked if that was for all the children they were not going to have, but Henry said that no one had decreed that they wouldn't someday have children.\n\n\nVienna said that she did not want to have children with a man who could not keep his promises.  Henry begged her not to leave, but Vienna said if the money was not out of Henry's hands by the next day, she would be getting on a plane out of Oakdale then.  Audrey knocked on the door, and when Henry let her in, he said nothing to her about the inheritance.  Vienna grabbed her purse and ran out.  Audrey noticed the suitcase on the bed and asked if Vienna was leaving.  Henry said that he had to give away the Stenbeck fortune, and Audrey said she was more than happy to help him out.\n\n\nHenry shouted that his mother had masterminded James's death, and he was not going to give her one red cent.  He and Audrey went downstairs to have a drink, and he told her that his plan was to unload the money on a charity.  Audrey laughed at that \"dumb idea,\" and then chattered that there might be a way to keep both Vienna and the fortune.  She suggested that Henry get the same amount of money in a legitimate way, and her plan was to use Henry's half-interest in Metro.  Henry said that when the club reopened, they did not have room to pack in the number of bodies needed to equal a whopping fortune.\n\n\nAudrey acknowledged that, but said that could change if she brought in \"Ralph.\"  Henry asked what a \"Ralph\" was and how it would help to keep Vienna.  Audrey revealed that Ralph was someone she knew who had a lot of money and needed to \"put it into circulation.\"  He also ran a \"charitable organization\" that Henry could donate his money to, and then Ralph would turn around and give the same amount to Metro.  She said it was a win/win situation, but Henry said it was money laundering, and it was illegal.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul declared a holiday, and Emily noticed fresh fruit and flowers in the living room.  She said she was taking the day off, and since Paul had opted for a short engagement, she suggested that they go to a justice of the peace or a judge at City Hall and \"take the pledge.\"  Paul said that was not going to happen, and Emily assumed that he had set her up yet again.  She badgered Paul until he admitted that he wanted to marry her, but not at City Hall.  The two times they had tried that before had not worked so well, and Paul wanted a church wedding in front of the whole world.\n\n\nEmily laughed hysterically, but Paul was serious about wanting to do things differently.  He said that they could have a big party at Metro to celebrate their nuptials, and they set the date for the next day.  Emily said it was time for her to tell her mother, so she left for Memorial, and Paul offered to set up the Metro deal.\n\n\nDamian arrived at the Snyder farm, and Meg told him that since they had not been able to travel together previously, she had booked flights and a hotel in Aruba for them.  Damian was surprised, but he got to thinking that a long weekend with Meg might be enjoyable.  Meg, however, said that the trip was for two weeks, and they would take Eliza with them.  Damian was stunned, but he went along with Meg until she said that their flights were that evening.  He said he couldn't possibly leave that soon, and he referred to the timing as \"delicate.\"  He did not want people to think that they were insensitive so close to Holden's death.\n\n\nDamian suggested that they delay the trip for a month, but Meg argued that she had already booked and paid in advance for everything.  She said she was disappointed, but that she would get over it.  Meg went to get Eliza up from her nap, and when she returned, she was surprised that Damian was still there.  He said that he really wanted to be with her, but he couldn't go to Aruba yet.  Meg assumed Damian was concerned about Luke, and when she mentioned the boy, Damian jumped on it and used him as his excuse.\n\n\nA pouting Meg said that she wished Damian had more time for her; after all, she was the woman he loved.  Damian kissed her for a while and then agreed to the Aruba trip that night.  He said he would go pack a bag and meet her back at the farm.  After he left, Meg packed up the baby and set out for Fairwinds. The housekeeper let her in, and she wheeled the stroller into the living room and heard Paul asking for the number of Metro.  He put down the phone when he saw Meg, and he was delighted when she asked if he wanted to keep their daughter for a while.\n\n\nWhen Meg said she would be gone two weeks, Paul was surprised, but he readily agreed.  He did ask Meg what had  prompted the offer, given their tumultuous history.  Meg said that she was going to Aruba with Damian, and Paul was happy for her.  He also hoped that she would return the favor when she heard his news.  Meg's only comment on hearing of Paul's impending nuptials was to remind him about the gunshot wound to his back that Emily had delivered several years before.  Paul said that Emily's craziness merged with his and made them kindred spirits.  Meg congratulated him, and they hugged.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Susan's first words to Emily when she heard of the soon-to-be marriage were,\" Are you nuts?\"  Emily said that she was hoping for a more traditional response, such as \"Congratulations.\"  Susan's point was that she wished that her daughter was marrying someone Emily had not shot in the back, and then she dumped on Emily and concluded by saying that Paul was \"flakier than a croissant.\"   They argued until Susan gave in and agreed to attend the wedding.  She said that she loved Emily and she \"hoped to hell\" that Emily didn't \"rue the day\" that she remarried Paul.\n\n\nEmily returned to Fairwinds, where she walked in on Paul and Meg hugging.  Emily told Meg that she had not expected to see her there, so Paul explained that Eliza was visiting for a couple of weeks while Meg went to Aruba with Damian.  That pleased Emily, and she wished Meg a good time.  Meg walked out, and Paul and Emily kissed.\n\n\nIn her nightgown, Lily followed the spirit of Holden to the Snyder pond, calling for him to wait.  She found him swimming, and he invited her to join him.  Lily walked into the water and began swimming with her husband.  They kissed and began a playful splashing.  Suddenly Holden disappeared beneath the water, and when he surfaced, he was calling for help.  Lily went below to help him, but she could not find him.  She began calling for help and floundering in the water, and a passing Damian heard her cries.  He dived into the water and swam to save her.\n\n\nDamian found Lily and pulled her to the edge of the pond.  He carried her to the grass and tried to rouse her.  Lily began to cough, and Damian knew she was all right.  He picked her up and carried her home.  She assured him that she had not tried to commit suicide, and they realized that she had been sleepwalking.  She said Holden had called her.  She asked how Damian had happened by, and he said that he had been going to check on her, despite her previous instructions.\n\n\nLily took a warm shower and got into bed.  Damian wore a robe and put his wet clothes into the dryer.  Lily was shivering, so Damian climbed into bed with her and took her in his arms. Lily turned to him, and Damian began to kiss her.  Soon they began making love.\n\n\nHenry returned to his hotel room bearing a beautiful bouquet.  Vienna chided him for wasting some of his millions, but Henry explained that he had rescheduled the lawyer's appointment for the next day because he could not enjoy being rich without Vienna by his side.  He promised that he would sign the papers, get the millions, and give it all away.  He said they could find a suitable charity together, if she still wanted to be with him.  Vienna threw her arms around Henry and thanked him.  They kissed.\n\n\nIn the Lakeview lobby, Audrey spotted \"Ralph\" when he entered.  They hugged, and Ralph said that it was always a pleasure working with her.  He asked if her son was interested in their plan, and Audrey said that Henry was \"completely on board,\" and she assured her old friend that Henry would cause no trouble.\n\n\nMeg did not understand why Damian was not back at the farm or why he was not picking up his phone.  She left another message asking where he was, and telling him that he would love something she had picked up for their trip.  She pulled a bright red bikini out of a shopping bag as she talked.  She asked him to call her, and then headed for Damian's room at the Lakeview.  Meg got no response from her knocks on his door, and she could not understand why Damian was not there.\n\n\n",
