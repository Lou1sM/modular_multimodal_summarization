    "tvmega_recap": "When Alison confronted Susan about the empty vodka bottle that she found in her purse, Susan swore she poured it into a plant before taking a drink. Alison believed her, but told Chris that she needed to stay home with her mother instead of going to Katie's cottage with him. He was impressed by her maturity, and she promised that she won't let her family problems come between them. Rosanna was heartbroken when Craig missed his last chance to come clean, and still lied about Molly's investment. Lucy was devastated when Rosanna told her she was leaving Craig. Carly and Jack's first romantic evening since Sage's birth was interrupted, first by Craig, then by Rosanna. Craig blasted Carly for spilling the beans to Rosanna, but she insisted he was the one who broke his wife's heart; Rosanna wanted a place to stay after leaving Craig. Despite Lucinda and Mitzi's advice to the contrary, Rose decided to give Dusty another chance. Molly teased Jen that Dusty was too old for her. Dusty insisted to Molly and Rose that Jen means nothing to him. Rose and Dusty made up. Barbara tried to enlist Paul's help in keeping Jen away from Dusty, but he said he would let his sister make her own decisions. Jen told Paul she was moving out of the penthouse the next day.",
