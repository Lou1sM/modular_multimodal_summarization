When Lucinda comes to, the doctor wants to examine her, but Lily and Holden won't let him. He lets them go into his office to wait for Lucinda's next treatment, which Lucinda insists she intends to have. Holden follows the doctor out and accuses him of running an illegal operation involving smuggling human organs; the doctor says Keith only met a former employee of his there and that the clinic has nothing to do with it. He leaves, and Holden overhears a conversation in Spanish between a Mexican couple and the clinic receptionist; they're rebuffed by the receptionist when they ask to speak with the doctor, and Holden overhears the daughter tell the father that last week, everything was okay, but the father replies that perhaps it's for the best, because he is the one who should \"be doing this,\" not his daughter. Speaking Spanish, Holden asks them what their appointment was for; they don't want to talk to him, then he shows them a picture of Luke and asks if they've seen him. The say they haven't seen Luke, and they leave. Holden asks the receptionist/nurse why she told them they couldn't see the doctor, and she says because people come in all the time hoping for free appointments or treatments. He then asks the nurse what is kept in the room she just locked up, and the nurse says it's where they keep their patient records. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Lily tells Lucinda they are all in this illness together and that Lucinda needs to start acting like they are; they embrace, and Lucinda agrees to return to Oakdale with Lily. Holden comes in, and Lily tells him she's arranged for a pilot to fly Lucinda back to Oakdale. Holden tells Lily she should go with Lucinda, because Lucinda is feeling so weak. Lucinda and Lily leave, with Lily telling Holden to call her whether he hears anything about Luke or not. Holden says he will, and after they leave, he takes a screwdriver out of his pocket and breaks into the locked room where the clinic nurse said they kept their patient records. On the floor of the room, he finds something that belongs to Luke.\n\n\nIris visits Gwen, saying she heard that Gwen was in trouble and had had a baby and was fighting for custody. She says she can't believe her little girl has grown up and made her a grandma. Gwen suspects Iris wants the trust fund money; Iris claims not to know about it and says she just wants to help Gwen, and that maybe between the two of them, they can figure out the motherhood thing. Despite Gwen's misgivings, she invites Iris to stay, and Iris asks Gwen to tell her the whole story. When Gwen mentions Carly by name, Iris acts like she has no idea who Carly is, but she tells Gwen that everyone has a weak spot, and if they hit Carly in the right spot, she'll come tumbling down.\n\n\nJack comes home to find that Carly has arranged for the whole family to go to the Lakeview for dinner. The boys are excited, but Jack is still upset with Carly about setting Gwen up and doesn't want to go out. The boys bring out the family's mailbox, to which they've added Rory's name (at Carly's suggestion), and Jack finally agrees to go to the restaurant with them. At the restaurant, while Jack parks the car, the kids talk about Rory and ask Carly if his \"other mommy\" will get to visit him. Carly says no, that the judge decided the other mommy couldn't take care of a baby properly; she tells the kids the other mommy left Rory alone, and the kids say that's a bad thing. They see Jack, who has overheard the conversation and is obviously upset. Carly gets the desk clerk to agree to keep an eye on her kids while she goes after Jack. Jack is now mad because not only has she lied to the judge, she's also lied to their kids about Gwen, and he thinks that's pretty rotten. She tells Jack it sounds like he doesn't really want Rory in their family. \n\n\nUpstairs in Barbara's suite at the Lakeview, Hal, Paul, and Barbara hear Jennifer scream; they go in and find Jennifer crumpled, speechless, on the floor. Jennifer finally comes around and says she found the baby's death certificate and lost control of herself. Hal insists on talking to Jennifer alone, and he accuses her of abusing meth. She denies it, becoming angry and saying that Dusty is being vindictive and controlling, that he wants Jennifer to be in trouble so he can protect her. Hal tells her that Meg Snyder told Dusty that she found a bag of crystal meth in Jennifer's purse; Jennifer denies that too and says Meg's motivation would be to get Dusty to not be interested in Jenn. Hal says that doesn't make any sense and that Barbara might believe Jenn's stories, but he's not buying them. He tells her quite firmly that he has seen plenty of drug users, and he knows what he's seeing. Jennifer swears she's not using drugs; just then, Hal gets a call from the station and has to leave, but he tells Jennifer that their conversation is not finished. Jennifer says it is because she's fine, and Hal hugs her and says he hopes she is. When he leaves, Jennifer has a flashback to the day she spilled some meth on the carpet in Barbara's suite, and she drops down to her knees and begins frantically clawing at the carpet, trying to scrape up some of the spilled meth.\n\n\nDownstairs in the restaurant, Paul and Barbara have drinks and discuss Jennifer's situation. Paul tells Barbara that Jennifer needs to get away, and Barbara agrees and suggests a place, but Paul says Barbara isn't invited, that Jenn needs to get away from Oakdale and from everyone who will remind her of her son. Barbara is angry with Paul's tone, but Paul insists he's right about this. Then Paul notices Jack and Carly at the bar and sees a waiter carrying a high chair over by them, and he realizes they're out for dinner with the kids, including Rory. He excuses himself and heads over in their direction; as he passes, he overhears Jack telling Carly that she can try to justify what she did all she wants, but it won't change the fact that Gwen should not have lost her baby that way.\n\n\nJennifer gets off the elevator and walks past the pram; looking inside, she asks Parker and JJ if she can hold the baby. They say sure, so she picks him up, and looking at him in amazement, she says, \"It's you, isn't it? You're my baby!\"\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The fact that Carly won't tell the judge the truth about what she did to Gwen causes Jack and Carly to have a fight. Hal confronts Jennifer about her drug abuse but Jennifer denis she is taking drugs. Iris tels Gwen she will help her get her baby back but the truth is she wants to use Gwen and the baby to get revenge on Carly. Lily takes Lucinda back to Oakdale while Holden stays behind to look for Luke. Holden finds something Luke left behind inside a secret room at the clinic. Jennifer holds baby Rory in her arms and is sure he is her son.",
