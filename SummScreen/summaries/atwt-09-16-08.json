Brad told Katie he was worried that Margo would show up and haul him to jail for his involvement with Leo Morrisey. Janet came to the television station and informed the couple that Jack had resigned from the police force to protect his brother. Brad was defensive and claimed Jack had made his own choice. Kim overheard Janet's comment about Brad's trying to drown someone in the reservoir, and she zeroed in on him for an explanation. He and Katie made up a story to appease her. \n\n\nVienna and Bonnie continued their arguing while being held hostage in the warehouse. Bonnie tried to figure out which of them Derek had really meant to capture. She began to think that it might have been she who was the target, not Vienna. They screamed and pounded on the door, hoping to attract attention, to no avail. Bonnie broke the heel off one of Vienna's expensive shoes, and that started the arguing again. This time, it began to get physical until Vienna drew boundary lines with lipstick on the floor to designate separate turf. Eventually, the two were forced to huddle together for warmth under an old furniture pad. \n\n\nJames brought lunch to Henry in the wine cellar at Fairwinds, and soon Derek arrived. Henry was concerned about whether Vienna and Bonnie were all right, and Derek promised that they were. Henry got angry and threw his soup all over the front of Derek's suit, and Derek warned him to watch his step. After the loan shark left, Henry resumed chipping at stones in his cell. \n\n\nPaul brought tea to Meg and tried to persuade her to go back to her room and rest. Meg showed him a sonogram of their baby, and the two took some time to talk about looking ahead. Meg decided to take that nap, and when she had left, James appeared to scold Paul for not getting back to work. James tried to see the sonogram of his grandchild, but Paul snatched it away. \n\n\nHolden and Lily searched the woods while Jack and Carly stayed at the pit and called Ethan's name. After they found one of Ethan's shoes, Jack phoned Holden to come to the crater. Lily panicked that their son was down there in that bottomless pit and tried to climb in, but the men restrained her. They heard Ethan call out to his mother, and that verified that the boy was in the hole. Holden took Carly aside and asked her to please find Faith and tell her what was happening. Jack called off the search and instead requested a rescue crew. Lily was impatient and still wanted to go down there herself. \n\n\nMike arrived at the site and wondered who had created the pit, but he had a good idea it was Paul. Paul showed up and flashed back on removing the boards over the crater to resume his digging, and realized that he was responsible for the boy's fall. He apologized to everyone, and Holden asked him to notify Meg that the boy had suffered an accident. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Kim dashed into the studio and immediately sent Brad and Katie with a film crew to the construction site at the Snyder farm. Meanwhile, the rescue crew arrived there and coordinated with Mike. Carly returned and said she had notified Faith, but could not reach Emma. She tried to offer Lily water, but Lily was too distraught and asked Carly to leave. \n\n\nPaul returned home to tell Meg about her nephew, and she immediately wanted to accompany him back to the site. Paul reluctantly agreed to take her, since his wife was so adamant. When Meg went to get a sweater, James stepped in and Paul yelled at him that a child had been hurt falling into the pit that his father insisted he dig. James answered back that he could not believe he had a son who was such a coward that he was giving up on the project to find the hidden money. They argued more, and Paul said he was done with everything, but James again threatened Meg. He strongly suggested that Paul cover all traces of his involvement with the digging of the hole. Meg heard their voices, but Paul was alone when she returned. \n\n\nHenry heard James and Derek approaching and he dashed back to his chair. James whined that his son was a great disappointment to him, and blamed Barbara. Henry opened some expensive wine and James shared several glasses with him. James soon fell asleep, and Henry went back to working on his escape route. Henry did manage to get out, but when he went to use the phone upstairs, Derek and a revitalized James caught him and tied him into his chair. \n\n\nCarly went to the farm and found Emma inhospitable. Carly told her about Ethan, and Emma prepared to go to the site. Faith asked to go along, and Carly suggested she bring some of the boy's favorite books and that she read them to him while he was waiting to be rescued. Emma appreciated Carly's efforts and apologized for her earlier harsh words. \n\n\nThe news crew from the television station arrived with Brad and Katie, but they promised to stay out of the way. Jack assured them all that he was there strictly as a family member, not as a cop. Janet came, too, but Jack was curt with her. Mike approached Paul, who had returned with Meg, and accused him of continuing to dig in unstable ground and causing the mammoth sinkhole. Meg asked why Mike was thinking Paul was at fault, but he did not answer. Mike explained how he was installing rigging to stabilize the walls of the hole, and Janet arranged for food to come from Al's for the workers. \n\n\nBrad interviewed Lily briefly, and she asked for prayers for her son. Carly brought Emma and Faith, and Lily thanked her for that. Holden made the decision that he would be the one to go down into the hole to search for his son. Mike and Paul also volunteered, but Emma made the call that the boy was Holden's son, and he should go. Emma led all the volunteers in the 23rd Psalm as they gathered around the crater.\n\n\n",

Paul remembers that he left the hole uncovered and can't help but feel terrible about Ethan's accident. James takes Paul's feelings of compassion and remorse as a sign of weakness and tells him to be a man handle the set back and continue looking for the gold. Paul and Mike both offer to go down the hole and get Ethan but Holden ends up going down to try and get Ethan out. Henry tries to escape by getting James drunk and stealing the key to his cell but James catches him. James points a gun at Henry and tells him he is through being nice and he had better start praying to live. Bonnie and Vienna fear they will never be found as they hold each other to keep warm in the cold warehouse. Katie and Janet feel guilty that protecting Brad forced Jack to quit his job. Brad is grateful for Jack's help but insists that quitting the police force was Jack's choice.",
