The doctor met with them briefly to see how they were feeling. Alison denied any nausea. As they were parting, Alison got a phone call from Aaron confirming their movie date that night. They planned to meet at the Lakeview.\n\n\nBack at Gwen's house, Gwen and Alison were surprised to find Iris waiting there. An exasperated Gwen introduced them. Alison asked to use the bathroom to touch up her makeup, and Iris told Gwen how sorry she was about the baby. She gave Gwen a plant and told said that Gwen needed her mother. She said that maybe Gwen wasn't meant to have children.\n\n\nAs Alison was leaving, Iris thanked her. Alison, thinking that Gwen had told her about the egg donation said, \"You told her?\" Iris wanted to know what Alison was talking about. Gwen covered, saying that she and Alison were putting together a memorial for the baby that Gwen had lost. She then walked Alison outside. Alison apologized for her blunder. Gwen said it was not her fault and that she wasn't going to tell Iris about it. Alison left.\n\n\nBack inside, Iris questioned Gwen's friendship with Alison, mentioning her previous interest in Will and her porn movie history. Gwen told Iris to leave. Iris played on Gwen's sympathy, saying that she had lost both her grandbabies. Gwen asked what had happened to Sofie's baby. Iris said that she'd paid for Sofie to have an abortion.\n\n\nGwen was outraged and wanted to know what had changed Sofie's mind and how Iris could have done that. Iris told her that Sofie and Cole weren't ready for a baby. She tried to make Gwen feel guilty for not helping Cole with his music career. Gwen told her that after that, she would never help him. Iris said that she wished Gwen could have a child so she could see just how ungrateful children could be. She stormed out.\n\n\nGwen threw out the plant that Iris had given to her and called the Lakeview, looking for Sofie.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Aaron's boss asked about Sofie's whereabouts, and Aaron covered for her.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Sofie remembered Cole asking if her unborn baby were his. Cole took her some breakfast, but she told him she wasn't hungry. Cole apologized for acting the way he had, and he told her that there was a way out of it -- to get an abortion. He told her that they could have a baby when they were ready, but the time was not right. Sofie tearfully said he was right.\n\n\nCole gave Sofie the envelope of cash that Iris had given him. She rejected the money and wanted to know where it was from. He told her it was from his mother. Sofie worried that Iris would think she was a horrible person. Cole said that Iris understood the situation and pointed out that it was ultimately her choice, but if she had the baby, he wouldn't be involved. He left her standing there, holding the envelope of money.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, a distraught Sofie told Aaron what had happened and contemplated going through with the abortion. Aaron asked her if it was what she wanted. She said that she had no choice and that she could not lose Cole. She told Aaron that she loved Cole and that her baby deserved to have a mother and a father. Alison showed up to meet Aaron but ran to the bathroom with nausea, and Aaron followed her.\n\n\nCole saw Sofie sitting there and asked if she had changed her mind. She said that she was going to have the abortion. She wanted to know when to schedule it and asked if he was going with her. He said that he would but made her feel guilty by reminding her that he got \"weird\" around doctors, and he wouldn't want to make things worse for her. She sadly told him not to worry about it and that she would go by herself. Cole told her that he loved her and left to meet a business contact.\n\n\nAaron returned and offered to go with Sofie if she decided to get the abortion, but she told him that Cold had already said he would go then she left. Alison returned. Aaron asked if she was okay, and she admitted she really wasn't -- the hormone shots were making her sick. She canceled her date with him that night so she could go home and rest. Aaron told her he wanted her to go home with him so that he could take care of her. Sofie saw them walk out together.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Sofie called the clinic to make an appointment for the abortion, asking to make it for that day.\n\n\nAt Emma's, Craig received a large envelope that he had apparently been waiting for. He tipped the courier generously and left with a large smile on his face.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul and Rosanna shared breakfast after a night of lovemaking. Rosanna wanted to forget about Craig and just focus on them. Paul said it was a mistake to forget about him. He insisted that the only place where Craig wouldn't be able to hurt anyone anymore was prison. Rosanna agreed, but pointed out that she couldn't testify against him if she couldn't remember what had happened. Paul told her that it wasn't an issue; she just needed to not tell the judge and jury that. Rosanna said that she couldn't do that. She said that Craig no longer had power over them.\n\n\nJust then, Craig walked in and stated that they shouldn't be so sure about that. He served her with papers; he was suing her for freezing his assets. Craig said that she wasn't acting like herself and hoped that the brain damage hadn't altered her personality. He said that he was worried about her. Suddenly she got a flashback of him saying those words. Craig left.\n\n\nRosanna told Paul that she was no longer worried about lying in court because her memories were suddenly returning to her. Rosanna remembered confronting Craig with the truth about Jennifer's baby being alive -- she'd told him to call Bob so that Rory could be tested. She couldn't remember what had happened after that. Frustrated, she became very short of breath. Paul went to call a doctor, but she stopped him. She remembered realizing that Rory was Jennifer's baby and that she had to tell her the truth even though it meant losing the baby, and she remembered fearing Craig would kill her for crossing him.\n\n\nPaul told Rosanna that she'd nearly lost her life because of Craig, and they needed to stop him. He went to call the police; Rosanna said no and put her hand on the phone. She suddenly had another memory of Craig ripping the phone out of her hand and telling Rosanna that no one would ever take his son away from him. Rosanna still couldn't remember everything, but Paul said he had an idea. He arranged for her driver to take them to where the accident had occurred. Just then, she heard the tires of the car peeling out, and remembered being in her car, trying to get to Paul. She saw headlights behind her and saw Craig in her rearview mirror. She said that she remembered everything.\n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Station, Craig showed up to talk to Margo. He lamented about Paul and Rosanna's vendetta against him. He told her that Paul was obsessed with him. Margo wanted to know why he was really there. He asked her for a favor. If the case against him for running Rosanna off the road were to be filed again, he wanted her to be fair. Margo told him she would not look the other way. He said that he hadn't done anything wrong.\n\n\nMargo said that if Craig hadn't done anything wrong, he had nothing to worry about. He said that it wasn't always true -- that they had both done jail time for crimes they hadn't committed, but he didn't want to dwell on that because he loved her. Margo told him that she wasn't the one he should be sucking up to -- but rather, he should be sucking up to Tom, because if he were arrested, she would do her job.\n\n\n",
