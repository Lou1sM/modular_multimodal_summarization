    "soap_central": "\n\n \nMargo hugged Adam, who was in handcuffs in the interview room at the Oakdale police station.  She said Tom was trying very hard to understand what was going on, and Casey was having an even harder time with it.  Adam announced that he had made a decision: he was pleading guilty to all the charges against him.  Margo shouted, \"Absolutely not!\" She said it would kill her to see her son in a federal prison, and Adam had no idea what life was like behind bars.  Adam also wanted to reveal all his transgressions, even those he was not charged with, but Margo also felt strongly against that. She said if Adam was not going to fight for himself, then she would do it.\n\n\nAlison went to the Hughes home and invited Casey to a cocktail party at Metro to celebrate Emily and Paul's engagement.  His response was that he was dating his ex-wife's sister, who also happened to be her daughter; and if he could handle that, Casey could certainly handle going to a party.  Tom arrived home and wanted to speak privately with his son, so Alison left.  Tom said that he and Margo had made a decision about Adam, and they were both on the same side.  He could not blame Margo or Casey for not wanting Adam to face hard time.\n\n\nTom needed Casey's aid to help Margo face whatever was ahead for Adam.  Margo rushed in and told Tom that their son was about to make a bad situation worse, and he was the only one who could stop him.  Tom said that he could not believe that Margo was asking him to take Adam's case when she knew how her husband felt about what their son had done.  Margo begged Tom to do it for her, while Casey argued that Adam didn't \"give a damn\" about any of them.\n\n\nCasey got disgusted and did one of his quick retreats out the door.  Margo continued to plead with Tom, who said that too much had happened with Adam to wipe the slate clean, but she continued to argue that they could not turn their backs upon their son.  Meanwhile, Casey visited his brother at the police station, much to Adam's surprise.  Casey asked when Adam was going to end the game, and he said that Margo was working on Tom to persuade him to represent their son.  Adam claimed that he had never asked Margo to do that; in fact he had told her that he was pleading guilty to all charges.\n\n\nThe interview room door was open, and Alison appeared in the doorway, but neither young man saw her.  She ducked to the side but stayed to listen to their conversation.  Alison was stunned to hear Adam describe how Maddie Coleman and Gwen Munson had buried him alive in the woods, and she jumped into the room to ask Adam what he was talking about.  Adam explained how Maddie had assumed that he was trying to hurt Gwen, so the two of them had bashed him in the head with a shovel and then buried him in the woods.  He said no one knew about the incident except the principals and Casey and Alison.\n\n\nA horrified Alison said that Adam had to tell the police that story, but Adam did not want to cause the young women any more trouble.  He asked the two of them to swear that they would not reveal his secret.  Tom and Margo walked in, and a disgusted Casey led Alison out.  Tom said that he would be representing Adam, but Adam said no.  Tom said that he wanted to help him because Adam was their son and always would be.  He said the first thing they had to do was figure out some kind of defense, but Adam claimed he had none.\n\n\nMargo protested that there had to be some mitigating circumstances because Adam was not a violent person.  Tom said that if there were such circumstances that might explain what drove Adam to such actions, it might prompt a jury to cut Adam some slack.  Adam said harshly that there was nothing they could use.\n\n\nCasey and Alison went to Java, and Casey griped that anyone but Adam would be behind bars by now.  Alison was still stunned that Maddie and Gwen had buried Adam alive, and she wondered out loud if that fact would make a difference in the outcome of Adam's trial.  She said that personally, she was willing to give Adam the benefit of the doubt.  She said that they could always ask Gwen and Maddie, but Casey was strongly opposed to that.  He reminded Alison that his brother did not want anyone else to know about the burial incident.\n\n\nAn unhappy Lily knocked on Damian's hotel door.  He let her in, and Lily told him that Luke kept looking at her with accusatory eyes, and Faith would not look at her at all.  She said that she and Damian had made a terrible mistake that she needed to fix.  Lily decided that all she could do was to make sure that it never happened again.  Damian was shocked when Lily asked him to stay away from her.  She said that she had regained her senses, but Damian argued that they could not deny their mutual feelings.  All of a sudden, a loud rapping on the door interrupted them, and they heard Lucinda's voice calling for Damian.\n\n\nDamian opened the door, and Lucinda said, \"Perfect timing\" when she spotted Lily.   She told her daughter that she was not leaving without her after she had chewed up Damian.  Damian told Lucinda that she had no right to barge into his room and issue orders, but Lucinda countered by asking what right Damian had to crash land in the middle of Lily's life and destroy her family.  She claimed to know just how Damian had used Luke to insinuate himself into the Snyder family.\n\n\nLucinda suggested that Lily pack up the children and join her on a world cruise, but Lily reminded her mother that running away never solved anything.  Lucinda accused Damian of having one of his minions arrange for Holden's accident, and that horrified Lily.  She demanded that her mother stop hurling accusations at Damian.  Lily also refused to disrupt her children any further and declared that she was the only one who would be making life decisions for her.  Damian ushered Lucinda out the door.\n\n\nLily admitted that she had caused her family great pain at the worst possible time.  She repeated that she and Damian had to stop seeing each other.  Damian attempted to change her mind, but Lily held firm.  She told Damian to stay away from the house and not to try to see her, and she walked out.\n\n\nMeg appeared at Fairwinds, much to Paul's surprise.  She said that she wanted to pick up Eliza, but she refused to go into any explanation.  Meg took the baby and left in a hurry.  Paul looked at Emily, who gave him permission to follow Meg and find out what had happened.  Paul went all the way to the farm to speak to Meg, who bluntly said that Damian had slept with Lily, so the two of them were finished.  Meg said that she should have seen the signs earlier, and she apologized for crying on Paul's shoulder.  She also felt that Holden's death had a lot to do with speeding up Damian's affair with Lily.  \n\n\n\n\nPaul said that Meg deserved someone better than either Damian or himself.  He wished Meg well and went to Metro where Emily was supposedly getting things ready for their engagement party.  Paul was a bit late and was surprised that no one else was there except Emily and the stock boy.  Emily explained that she had phoned all the guests and cancelled, because she had called off the wedding.  She said that she had finally realized that she would never be number one with Paul; otherwise he would not have run after Meg.\n\n\nPaul admitted that he was worried about Meg, but as Emily railed on, Paul began to laugh.  He said Emily was correct, but they both had a lot of baggage.  Emily's retort was that they had enough baggage to bring down a 747.  Paul said they needed to throw it all on the side of the road, and he suggested that they do something unexpected..  He asked if Emily was really invested in a big wedding, and she said that none of the trappings were important to her.  Paul said that the wedding was off, but the marriage was on.\n\n\nPaul and Emily went to a justice of the peace and ordered the short ceremony.  Just before the justice pronounced them man and wife, Paul stopped him.  He wanted to say how long and how much he loved Emily, and she then responded by remembering how many years the two of them had been tied together, both good and bad.  She called Paul her \"home,\" and the justice pronounced them man and wife, and they kissed.\n\n\nLucinda called at the Snyder farm and surprised Meg by asking her if she was going to mope around the farm or put up a fight and go after her man.  Meg said that Damian did not appear to be her man any longer, and she asked what Lucinda was really up to.  Meg rightly said that Lucinda only wanted Lily away from Damian, and Lucinda did not disagree.  She asked Meg is she was willing to put her money where her mouth was.\n\n\nLily rested on the couch at home, as Meg rang the doorbell.  Lily tried to put her off, but Meg said they needed to have a conversation.  Meg said some nasty things, including that Lily's affair with Damian had begun before Holden's trip to Kentucky.  She also accused her sister-in-law of being jealous when Damian became interested in Meg, and she called Lily a \"spoiled princess\" who always got what she wanted.\n\n\n Meg was angry that she had made it easy for Lily to take advantage of Damian, and she should have fought harder.  Meg warned that Lily had better change or she would lose everything, including her family.  Meg called Lily a classic \"damsel in distress,\" and Lily asked if she had taken the role that Meg usually favored.  Lily opened the door and told Meg to \"get the hell out.\"  Meg returned to the farm and played with her baby.  She told Eliza that she was going to fight for Damian so that the baby could have a wonderful new daddy.\n\n\nLucinda's next stop was the foundation office in the Worldwide suite, where she found Damian doing paperwork.  She asked him what it would take to get him out of Lily's life for good.  Damian asked if she was really that afraid of him, and Lucinda answered that she thought that Lily was beginning to see through Damian's \"Maltese charm.\"  She urged him to name his price and to let her know.  Lucinda walked out, and Damian immediately called Lily.  He told her to meet him because there was something that she needed to know.\n\n\nLily met Damian in his car, and he said that he wanted to make sure she was all right after Lucinda's tirade.  He repeated that he did not feel that they had done anything wrong, and Lily finally admitted that she no longer had any guilt about their actions. That gave Damian hope, and he said that he was not ready to walk away from her.  He asked if Lily was really sure that she wanted to end things between them, and Lily said no, she was not.  Damian kissed Lily's hand.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Damian and Lily sleeping together continues to cause problems with Lily and the Snyder side of the family. Lucinda isn't too happy either and asks Lily to take the kids and go with her on an extended vacation but Lily refuses telling her mom she can't run away from her problems. Lucinda then goes to Meg and tells her she has lost her edge and she must fight for Damian. Meg decided to take Lucinda's advice and warns Lily she intends to fight for Damian. Lily had told Damian she didn't want to see him anymore but after her discussion with Meg she changes her mind and tells Damian that she still wants to see him. Emily calls off the wedding after Paul allows Meg to tell him her troubles with Damian. Emily doesn't want to come in second to anyone anymore. Paul persuades Emily that he and Meg will always be connected because of Eliza but he isn't in love with Meg anymore. Paul and Emily later have a very touching wedding ceremony before a justice of the peace. Margo persuades Tom to defend Adam in his trial because she doesn't want him to plead guilty to the charges against him. Casey is angry that Adam always gets what he wants no matter who gets hurt. Adam tells Casey and Alison about when Gwen and Maddie buried him in the ground and left him to die but insists that neither of them tell anyone about the incident because he doesn't want to cause Gwen and Maddie anymore pain. Alison thinks that what Maddie and Gwen did to Adam was horrible and thinks that Casey should talk to Maddie or Gwen and hear their side of the story. Casey thinks that Adam deserved whatever Maddie and Gwen did to him and he is annoyed because Alison is taking Adam's side just like everyone else.",
