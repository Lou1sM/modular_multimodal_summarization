Sarah wanted to call Bonnie for moral support but Marshall said no. He told Sarah that she would be fine and, once she started to meet other kids, she would enjoy school.  He kissed Sarah good-bye and she left.  Bonnie came up and said that she could help but Marshall said, \"Over my dead body!\" He told Bonnie that it would take some time and that he had everything under control. Later, Sarah showed up having run away from school because the kids were making fun of her.  Marshall tried to reassure her that everything was going to be fine but Sarah ran away.  Bonnie, who was listening in the hall, approached Marshall and asked him, \"So, you have everything under control?\" Marshall gave her a dirty look and went after Sarah. \n\n\nBen and Jessica were having coffee when Isaac came and announced he was leaving. Isaac said that it was over between him and Bonnie and he was okay with it.  They try to convince him to stay but he said he had to go and will keep in touch.  Ben, Jessica, and Isaac exchange hugs and Isaac left. Before he left, Isaac asked them why they weren't married yet so Ben and Jessica set a wedding date.\n\n\nRose and Mitzy were talking about Jennifer, who had just left.  Rose told Mitzy that she and Dusty made up.  Mitzy doesn't like the idea that Rose is with Dusty but said she would mind her own business. Paul showed up to clear up a few things and proceeded to try to find out why Dusty was spending so much time with Jennifer. He thought Rose and Dusty were supposed to be so happy together.  Rose couldn't find the answer and told Paul that she and Dusty were just fine. Paul kept after her until Rose finally broke down and cried.  When she looked at Paul again, she slapped him.  Paul said he didn't come there to fight with her but was concerned about her. He told Rose that she deserved better and that Dusty doesn't know her like he does. Paul said, as he looked her straight in the eye, that Rose needed someone to look her in the eye and tell her \"I Love You\", not just today but everyday. He then put his hand on her face and, as Rose reached for it, they fell into a passionate kiss. \n\n\nPaul offered Henry loads of money to bug Java so Paul could keep tabs on Dusty because he wanted to protect Jennifer. Over at Java, Dusty was on the phone with Jennifer when Molly came in.  Dusty had made a date to meet Jennifer at the Lakeview and told Molly to be there when the building inspector came. After Dusty left, Henry arrived at Java and tried to convince Molly to hire him as a bartender.  Molly said thanks, but no thanks. The building inspector arrived just in time for Molly to get away.  Henry installed the bugging device and left. At the Lakeview, Dusty tried to tell Jennifer that he couldn't have her anywhere near Java because of Rose.  Jennifer tried to convince Dusty that he needed her but he told her to leave.  \n\n\nMargo was frantic about Katie especially when she heard that the constable's body was found behind the ranch in a shallow grave. Hal tried to stop her but she said she would quit first. Margo started to make the arrangements when Tom came in and said that he would go with her. Meanwhile, in Australia, Mordecai took Katie to a place where he had electronic surveillance equipment set up. Katie was trying to talk him out of his plan to trap Simon when Mordecai thought he saw something and left to investigate. Katie was able to free herself from being tied to the desk and was trying to get out when Mordecai came back. He had enough of Katie so he took her downstairs and tried her up with a bomb placed under her chair. Mordecai came back into the room and was on the phone with Simon when Mike came in and placed a knife to Mordecai's throat.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sarah was terrified about her first day of private school, and wanted to see Bonnie. Bonnie overheard, and offered to talk to the teen, but Marshall insisted he had things under control. Sarah left school, saying she was never going back, because other kids were laughing at her. Henry agreed to bug Java Underground for Paul, then offered his services as a bartender to Molly. She said no way, but, while she was distracted by the health inspector, he managed to plant the bugs. Dusty told Jen that she and her model friends were no longer invited to the club opening. She insisted that he would eventually give in to his desire for her. After Marshall cleared Dusty's gambling charges and the health inspector gave them the go-ahead, Molly and Dusty embraced; it was obvious that there was still sexual tension between them. Rose told Mitzi and Paul that Dusty made her happy, but Paul forced her to see that wasn't completely true. She slapped him, but after he said that she needed someone that would love her forever like he had, they began to kiss. Margo told Hal and Tom that the constable's body and Katie's fingerprints were found at the sheep station, so she and Tom made plans to head to Australia to search for Katie. Mordecai strapped Katie to a bomb, but Mike snuck up on him and held a knife to his throat. Isaac told Ben and Jessica that he was leaving town, then convinced them to set a wedding date; they decided on Thanksgiving.",
