Holden's patience was at an end, and he demanded that someone go into the crater to retrieve Ethan. Lily was distraught to think she might lose another family member in the rescue attempt. Mike tried to persuade them to leave the rescue to the experts, but everyone was aware that time was passing. Mike reminded Holden that he had injured himself in the unsuccessful rescue attempt and was not capable of effectively removing the boy. Holden, in his frustration, tied a rope around his waist and told Mike to get out of his way. Faith cried that she did not want her father to die, and Lily stopped Holden with a similar concern. Finally, Holden conceded to wait for the professionals and persuaded Lily to go with him for some food. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul assured Meg that he was working on a solution for repaying his loan to Derek Coburn. Meg immediately wanted to report the loan shark's threats to the police, but Paul nixed that. His deal to her was that she would take care of their unborn baby while he figured out how to solve their financial problems. Paul said he was going back to the construction site, but Meg begged him to tell her a story until she fell asleep. Paul was shocked when she asked him to talk about his father. When Meg dozed off, Paul crept out quietly. She awoke soon afterward and drove to the Snyder construction site. \n\n\nJack took Carly to the Snyder farm, and they found Janet there, cooking. Carly was uncomfortable being there with Janet and Jack, so she walked out. Jack followed her and reminded her that feeling guilty never helped any situation. The two of them talked on the porch while Janet watched from the kitchen window. Jack was still struggling with his resignation from the police force, so they discussed that. As Carly was leaving, Holden and Faith arrived. Carly volunteered to gather blankets and sleeping bags for the crew. Faith blamed herself for ignoring her little brother just before he wandered off and fell into the crater. Holden consoled her by telling her he was at fault as well for not checking his messages to realize the children were alone. \n\n\nMeg arrived at the site looking for Paul, but there was no sign of him. She encouraged an exhausted Lily to eat something and asked many questions, trying to better assess Ethan's medical condition. Paul was lurking at the site, hiding behind the construction office with a large coil of rope. Meg and Mike had a discussion during which Meg told Mike about threats from the loan shark. She defended Paul, but she was not about to change Mike's low opinion of her husband. Meg told Mike she was sure Paul would show up because he felt responsible for Ethan's accident. \n\n\nMike had to give Lily the bad news that the rescue equipment was delayed by bad weather, despite all Lucinda could do about expediting it. Lily refused to leave the site to eat or rest, so Holden came back with a tent so that Lily could remain at the site close to her son, but still get some respite. Mike brought them a map he had made of a possible route to tunnel into the side of the crater, and he and Holden left the map on one of the worktables. When those two walked off, Paul snatched the map and hid behind the office again. Meanwhile, Lily was comforted when she heard her son making snoring noises as he slept in the pit. She and Holden hugged, and he persuaded her to lie down in the tent. Lily invited Holden into the tent, and the two of them fell asleep. \n\n\nCarly told Janet that she thought Janet was good for Jack and then left with a cooler full of food for the crew and volunteers. She peeked into the tent at the site and saw Holden and Lily very close. \n\n\nMike apologized to Meg for his earlier remarks about Paul. Meg suffered a muscle spasm and accepted Mike's offer to take her home. When they left, Paul emerged from his hiding place and tied his rope around the backhoe and threw the other end into the hole. Slowly he lowered himself down the rope, stinging his hands. \n\n\nJack told Janet that it was a lot easier for him to talk with Carly since they were no longer married. He assured Janet that he no longer had a future with Carly, but he could not tell her anything else about his plans. \n\n\nIn the crater, Paul found Ethan, who appeared to be all right and happy to see his Uncle Paul. Paul gave the boy some water and promised to get him out safely. As he shone his flashlight around the bottom of the crater, Paul noticed a chest partially buried in the soil. He pried it open but was disgusted to find it filled only with dirt. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Carly tells Jack that she hopes this crisis will bring Holden and Lily back to each other because they need each other. Carly later sees Holden and Lily sleeping in the same sleeping bag while they wait for Ethan to be rescued tomorrow. Carly advises Jack to allow himself to need Janet because she is good for him. Carly tells Jack that if Holden and Lily do get back together she will be waiting for someone to love her and someone she can love with her whole heart. Janet wonders if Jack still loves Carly and he says he will always care about her but he isn't what Carly needs and she isn't what he wants anymore. Carly overhears this conversation between Jack and Janet and goes home a little sad for herself but happy for Jack. Lily stops Holden from going to get Ethan until the proper equipment arrives tomorrow because she couldn't survive if she lost both him and Ethan. Paul overhears Meg defending him to Mike and when most of the people have left the work site he goes down to find Ethan and the gold. Paul is happy to find Ethan is okay and he is even happier to find the gold bars that James said were down in the hole. Paul sits and waits beside a sleeping Ethan to be rescued in the morning.",
