Henry explained that he had been out shopping, because Vienna had promised him a night he'd never forget if he agreed to give up the Stenbeck inheritance. Audrey told him that she thought Vienna would love the bullfrog, and Henry wondered how his mother knew what he'd bought.\n\n\nAudrey showed Henry a check that had arrived in the mail, representing the first installment of his inheritance. Audrey told Henry to sign the check over to Ralph's \"charity,\" called \"Children of Adversity.\" Henry gaped at the amount of the check but did as he was told.\n\n\nBarbara walked into Metro and told Henry not to become too comfortable with his newfound wealth, because she intended to contest James's will. Audrey told Barbara that would be a waste of time, because Henry didn't intend to keep the money, anyway. Audrey informed Barbara that Henry was going to give the money to charity, and Barbara asked Henry if that was his new nickname for his mommy. When Henry informed Barbara that the charity was called \"Children of Adversity,\" Barbara said she wasn't stupid enough to believe Henry and Audrey's ploy. She informed them that she intended to check out the legitimacy of the charity, and she left.\n\n\nAudrey told Henry that they had to do something to keep Barbara from investigating the bogus charity. Audrey suggested that Henry visit Barbara and use his charms to convince Barbara that it was a great idea for Henry to be keeping the money. Henry told his mother that he was good, but he wasn't that good. However, Audrey insisted that Henry try. She cheered him on as she pushed him out the door, telling him to keep his eye on the prize.\n\n\nHenry went to Barbara's suite at the Lakeview, and she reluctantly let him in. Henry told Barbara that he hoped they could work out a mutually beneficial resolution regarding the inheritance. Barbara told Henry that he had one shot to make his argument, and he began by asking Barbara why she was so opposed to him giving the money to charity. Barbara said that she didn't believe it was a legitimate charity, and to make her point, she picked up the phone and told Henry that she was going to call her lawyer to have him investigate it.\n\n\nHenry told Barbara that she didn't need to do that, and when she asked why not, he told her that although the charity was completely legitimate, that wasn't why he had gone to visit her. Barbara asked what his reason had been, and he told her that he wanted her to be on his side and to \"let the money go\" the same way that he had. Henry asked Barbara if she really wanted to saddle Paul with money that would only remind him of James, and he pointed out that Paul himself had claimed not to want the money.\n\n\nBarbara told Henry that she wouldn't give up without a fight, but Henry told Barbara that she would never be able to have the will overturned. Barbara then suggested another alternative, splitting the money 50/50 between Henry and Paul. Barbara was sure she could convince Paul to use the money to set up a trust for Eliza. Barbara told Henry that it was her only offer before she had her lawyer began the process of contesting the will and investigating the charity.\n\n\nPanicked, Henry agreed to Barbara's terms. He then suggested that they celebrate their agreement by having a drink together, and he took out a bottle of champagne from the bag he'd been carrying. Barbara didn't feel that a drink was necessary, but Henry thought it was good form, so she went to get a couple of glasses. When Henry popped the cork on the champagne, the cork flew across the room and broke a crystal vase on the mantelpiece. Barbara was horrified when she saw what had happened, and despite Henry's apologies, she threw him out of her suite. In his haste, Henry left behind his bag.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Ralph asked Teri why she was worried about taking him to see Janet. Teri said she was sure that Janet would be thrilled to see Ralph, but she wasn't sure Janet would want to see her again. Ralph asked Teri what was wrong between her and Janet, but Teri said it would be better if Ralph heard it from Janet.\n\n\nTeri took Ralph to the Snyder farm, and when Janet saw Ralph, she exclaimed with happiness and hugged him, telling him how glad she was to see him again. Janet asked Ralph what he was doing there and whether he was sick. He assured her that he was fine, then he asked her what was going on between her and Teri.\n\n\nJanet said she couldn't forget what Teri had done, and Teri replied that she realized that Janet didn't like the idea that Liberty wanted to have an abortion, but it was Liberty's choice. Janet said it wasn't a choice, and she turned to Ralph for backup. Ralph said he thought they were both missing the point, which was that they both loved Liberty and loved each other, and they should be looking for common ground. Ralph said that in their situation, the common ground was that they both wanted what was best for Liberty.\n\n\nRalph told Janet and Teri that he wanted to meet Liberty, and he also said he wanted them to make lunch for him, which he would then turn into a special occasion. Janet told Ralph that she would call Liberty and ask her to return home for lunch.\n\n\nParker ran into Liberty, who was sitting on a bench with some pamphlets in her lap. He asked her what she was reading, and Liberty told him that they were brochures from churches and hospitals about adoption. Liberty explained that Janet had asked her to read about all of the options before deciding what to do about the pregnancy.\n\n\nParker said he thought that Liberty had already decided what she wanted to do. Liberty told Parker that she had promised to look at the information about adoption. She then remembered that when she had married Parker, Janet had told her that she was too young to be somebody's wife. Liberty wondered why her mother couldn't see that being somebody's mother would be \"a million times worse.\" Parker assured Liberty that everything would be okay, and reminded her that he would be there for her, no matter what.\n\n\nLiberty's phone rang, and it was Janet, who told Liberty there was someone she wanted Liberty to meet at the farm. After making sure it wasn't another priest, Liberty agreed to return home. Liberty told Parker that something was up, and Parker asked if Liberty wanted him to accompany her to the farm. Liberty did, so the two went together to the Snyder farm.\n\n\nWhen they arrived, Parker and Liberty were introduced to Ralph. Ralph asked Parker if he was the guy who'd gotten Liberty into trouble, and Liberty was horrified to hear that her mother had told someone Liberty hadn't even met about her pregnancy. Janet defended herself by saying that she'd had to, but Liberty said, \"No, you did not.\" Janet told her daughter that \"Uncle Ralph\" would help them figure out the next step.\n\n\nRalph asked Liberty to sit at the table for a minute so they could talk. Liberty sat down, and Ralph explained that he'd been told about her situation. When Liberty said that she didn't want to be a mom, Ralph pointed out that adoption was a solution. Liberty responded that she'd already told her mother that she didn't think she could continue with the pregnancy and then give up the baby. Janet thought that with more time, Liberty might change her mind. Ralph told Liberty that he could check into the adoption possibility immediately, because he had a lawyer he could call to discuss it. Liberty agreed to let Ralph make the call.\n\n\nJanet told Parker that it was time for him to leave. Parker asked Liberty to call him later, and then he left. Ralph then informed Liberty that his lawyer knew of a couple who wanted to adopt. Ralph said it was possible that the couple could even meet with Liberty in the lawyer's office later that day.\n\n\nCraig went to Carly's house, where Rosanna was on the phone with a private investigator. Craig overheard Rosanna asking the person to perform a background check on Ralph Manzo. After Rosanna hung up, Craig asked her why she was doing that. Rosanna told Craig that because Ralph was supposed to become one of Carly's business partners, she thought she should check up on the man.\n\n\nCraig told Rosanna that after he had spoken to Teri about her \"Uncle Ralph\" at length, he felt reassured about him. Rosanna couldn't believe that Craig suddenly had no problems dealing with Ralph, and she said that \"when things are too good to be true and there are large amounts of money involved,\" it was best to be careful. Rosanna then reminded Craig that she herself had once lost all of her money, and she said she didn't want the same thing to happen to Carly. Rosanna complimented Craig on his suit and asked if it had been expensive.\n\n\nCraig told Rosanna that he could see that she was making the issue more about them than about Ralph Manzo, but Rosanna claimed that Craig was mistaken. She did agree that he had a point when he pointed out that she apparently didn't trust him, and she reminded him that she had made the mistake of trusting the wrong person in the past.\n\n\nCraig pointed out that Rosanna's lack of trust in him when she had suspected him of having an affair with Teri had led to Janet inadvertently learning that Liberty was trying to have an abortion. Rosanna couldn't believe that Craig had thrown that back at her, but Craig simply said that the truth could hurt. Rosanna told Craig to get out, and as he left, Craig told Rosanna that when her investigation of Ralph blew up in her face, she shouldn't cry to him, because he would just say, \"I told you so.\"\n\n\nParker went home, where he told Rosanna that he'd met Ralph, and that Ralph liked to take charge of things. Parker told Rosanna that Ralph thought that Liberty should have the baby and give it up for adoption, even though that didn't seem to be what Liberty wanted. Rosanna apologized to Parker for her role in stopping Liberty from having an abortion, but Parker told her that Liberty didn't blame her.\n\n\nParker started to leave the room, but Rosanna stopped him and asked him if he thought she was being too hard on Craig. Parker admitted that Rosanna could be intense at times, but he said that he knew that Rosanna had her reasons. When Rosanna asked how Parker felt about Craig, Parker said that Craig had been cool with him and had offered support for Liberty. Rosanna asked how he felt about Craig and Carly's relationship, and he told her that although he'd been against it at first, he could see that Craig loved Carly and had tried to help Carly with her drinking problem. Parker told Rosanna that Craig wasn't perfect, but no one else was, either.\n\n\nCraig went to Metro, hoping to be alone for a while, but Audrey was there. She asked him why he wanted to be alone, wondering whether he'd had an argument with his girlfriend. Craig asked who Audrey was talking about, and she said the blonde woman who had been with Craig previously. Craig said that was Rosanna, and he assured Audrey that Rosanna was not his girlfriend. Audrey offered to pour Craig a drink. When Craig declined, Audrey grabbed a bottle of vodka and poured a couple of drinks, anyway, telling Craig that he shouldn't let a lady drink alone. Craig went along with her, and the two drank a few shots together.\n\n\nCraig explained that he had once been married to Rosanna, but was engaged to her sister, Carly, who was part owner of Metro. Audrey shook her head at the complexity of that relationship and told Craig that he was \"grazing way too close in the same field.\" She then said that she couldn't picture Craig with Rosanna, anyway, because Rosanna seemed to be too tense. Craig said that was the least of Rosanna's problems, but he assured Audrey that he wasn't interested in Rosanna, because he was a \"one-woman man, now.\"\n\n\nAudrey asked what Craig meant by \"now,\" and he told her it was cruel to tempt him when he was in a weakened state. Before Craig could answer, Rosanna appeared and said that Craig was in a state of drunkenness. She asked if that was how Craig had planned to spend the rest of his day, and she told him that if he was determined to make \"an ass\" of himself, he was doing a brilliant job of it.\n\n\nAudrey invited Rosanna to join them for a drink and try to unwind a bit, but Rosanna declined curtly. Rosanna then stated that Craig was clearly too inebriated to drive home, and she said that she would drive him. Rosanna went out to her car to wait for Craig. Craig apologized to Audrey for the abrupt end to their socializing, and Audrey wished him luck.\n\n\nCraig left, and later, Henry returned. When Henry told his mother about his arrangement with Barbara, she was unhappy. Henry told Audrey that he had a plan, which was to delay the paperwork on splitting the inheritance while at the same time having Ralph put 100% of the money into the charity immediately. Audrey understood that Henry meant the paperwork for the charity would be finalized before anyone could stop them from depositing the money into it. Henry said that it would all appear to have been a clerical error, which was something Barbara wouldn't be able to do anything about.\n\n\nHenry then realized that his bag was missing. Audrey thought he'd taken it with him when he'd gone to talk to Barbara, so Henry rushed back to the Lakeview and knocked on Barbara's door once again. When Barbara answered, Henry told her that he thought he might have left something there, and Barbara replied that he had and said that he was apparently spending his inheritance on some interesting purchases. She handed Henry the bag, and he took it and left, but when he opened it up, it was empty. Looking back at Barbara's door, an astonished Henry said, \"No way.\"\n\n\nRalph went to Metro, and Audrey gave him the check, which Henry had endorsed. Ralph told Audrey that it was always a pleasure to do business with her.\n\n\nWhen Rosanna got Craig back to Carly's house, she laid into him about having gotten drunk with another woman while Carly was at rehab. Craig told Rosanna to lighten up, saying it had been a few drinks, not an affair. When Craig asked Rosanna when she'd last had fun, telling her it wouldn't hurt if she cracked a smile, Rosanna replied that Craig was being insulting and should leave. Craig told Rosanna that she made snap judgments about people and hung onto those judgments, even when she knew she was wrong, but Rosanna retorted that she'd had plenty of time to make her judgments about Craig. Craig asked why Rosanna couldn't try to put their past behind her so that they could move forward, and as Rosanna protested that it wasn't possible, Craig kissed her.\n\n\nLiberty asked Janet whether she could walk to the pond, and Janet agreed. Instead of going to the pond, however, Liberty called Parker and asked him to meet her right away in Old Town. When Parker arrived, Liberty explained about Ralph's offer to check into an arranged adoption, and she asked Parker if he would accompany her to the meeting. Parker agreed, but wondered why Liberty was even going to the meeting, since she didn't want to have the baby at all. Liberty told Parker that Janet had promised to let her make her own decision about the baby ultimately, provided that Liberty examined all of the other options first. Parker asked if Liberty believed Janet, and Liberty replied, \"When she makes a promise, she keeps it.\"\n\n\n",
