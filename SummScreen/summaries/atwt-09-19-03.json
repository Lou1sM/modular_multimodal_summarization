Mike demands to know where Katie is.  In a nearby room, Katie hears the timer begin to count down.  She also hears Simon's voice calling out for her.  She pleads with Simon to stay away.  Mike finds Katie and sets her free.  He wants to get away from the bomb, but now that Katie is free she wants to find Simon to warn him about the bomb.  Mike doesn't let her.  Time is almost up.  He tosses her over his shoulders like a sack of potatoes and carries her to safety as the building explodes.\n\n\nRosanna rocks Sage to sleep as Carly observes her sister in the background.  She asks Ro if she can watch Sage for the afternoon while she runs a few errands.  Rosanna agrees.  \n\n\nCraig stumbles into the new Java looking for his wife, but he finds Molly instead.  Molly tells him to quit chasing Rosanna, \"Stop crawling.  It's not attractive.\"  He starts to bite back, but Molly cuts him off, \"Don't you have a bridge to sell somewhere?\"  Meanwhile, Henry is giggling with glee as he listens to all the action via closed circuit audio.  His bugs seem to be working perfectly.  Carly arrives complete with attitude and snaps.  She berates Craig for his refusal to give up the club and for denying Rosanna a child.  Molly chimes in with thoughts of Craig living his life how he sees fit.  Carly asks Molly to buy Craig out and send him home to Rosanna.  Molly wonders, \"To do what?  Help Rosanna?  Why in the world would I wanna do that?\"  Carly retreats from Molly and returns to Craig warning him that no matter how strong their love is, \"it can be lost.\"  Seeing that she is having no effect on the man, she gives up and heads home.  After Carly is gone, Craig decides to give up the bar, but Molly has some advice of her own.  \"Women don't want a guy they can push around.  Do what she wants.  Give her a baby.\"  She offers him the name of a baby broker.  All of a sudden, Craig decides he wants a baby and rushes off to meet his wife.  Henry can't believe what he's hearing.  \"Cutting corners to speed up an adoption?  And they accuse me of being sleazy? (sigh)\"\n\n\nRose and Paul conclude their hot and heavy kiss at the Roller Palace.  Paul leans in for another, but Rose comes to her senses and says, \"That didn't happen.  That kiss?  That never happened.\"  Paul starts to walk toward the door just as Dusty arrives.  Rose's eyes bulge out of her head as she sees her boyfriend.  Paul walks by Dusty, and Dusty knows something big just happened.  He asks Rose if she is hurt, but she won't divulge any info so he walks off in a huff after Paul for some answers.\n\n\nChris and Alison talk about Susan over a cup of joe at Al's.  Chris tells her Susan must deal with her alcoholism on her own.  Alison cannot become the parent and keep watch over her mother every minute of every day.  He thinks it's time for her to move out, \"as soon as possible.\"  Alison thinks this is an invitation to move in together with Chris.  He dances around the issue until Alison takes the offer off the table.  She says she needs to be at home for her mother no matter what he says.  Chris changes the subject and tells her how much he wants to have sex with her again.  Alison feels the same way.  He holds up a set of keys and Alison guesses they belong to Margo and Tom.  They plan a rendezvous at the Hughes' home later if Emily can watch Susan.\n\n\nMike returns from searching the wreckage looking for Simon.  He tried to get as close to the ongoing fire as he could, but he didn't see any sign of her husband.  Katie collapses to the ground under the guilt of knowing she may have caused her husband's death.  Her tears of guilt quickly turn to anger.  She thrashes Mike for not allowing her the chance to see her husband one more time.  Mike tries to tell her that she should be happy because she's alive.  None of that matters to her, \"You kept me from having one last moment with Simon, and for that I HATE you!  I will never forgive you for what you did!  You kept me alive because you wanted me for yourself!\"\n\n\nWhen Paul gets home, he is greeted by another appearance from his father (in subconscious form).  James is excited his son has moved in on Rose.  Paul appears to be unaffected, and says he doesn't care anymore about Rose.  Just then, Dusty knocks at his door.  Paul opens the door and Dusty sucker punches him to the floor demanding to know what he did to Rose.  Paul gives him a lame answer, so Dusty takes off his watch for another round with his ex-best friend.  Just then, Rose knocks on the door.  He again asks his girl for the truth.  As she struggles for an answer, Paul rubs his jaw and says, \"We were kissing.\"  Dusty doesn't believe him until Rose reluctantly confirms the story.  Dusty makes another move to fight with Paul, but Rose stops him saying he needs to have a clean record if he wants to get his club up and running.  Dusty calmly points his finger at Paul and says he doesn't know when, but, \"you and me...we're gonna go.\"  \n\n\nShe gets Dusty to leave the apartment, and then she turns to Paul for some answers.  She wants to know why they fight and fight and fight, then all of a sudden, he kisses her.  Paul sees things in a different way, \"No Rose...You kissed me!\"  She admits she may have started it, but he turned it into something special.  In a tender moment, Paul admits he doesn't think he's as over Rose as he hoped.  Rose tries to squash that hope and tells him that the kiss meant nothing.  \"Kissing you is like kissing a flat can of soda...no fizz left.\"  Paul calls her out.  He says she would have left with Dusty if she were over him.  He worms his way into her heart again, but all he finds there is Rose in pain.  She is torn, and tells him to find somebody else to be his friend and confessor.  She finally leaves his apartment, and doubles over in tears and heartache just outside his door.\n\n\nDusty returns to Java angry with Rose and Paul.  He pours himself a drink, and then another.  After explaining to Molly what happened, she gets really close to him and says, \"Don't get drunk.  Get even.\"  She closes her eyes and purses her lips waiting for her ex-lover to make a move.  Dusty, however, gets a \"what the?\" look on his face.  He laughs and pulls away.  \n\n\nCarly returns home, and Craig isn't far behind.  Craig tells his wife he has a lawyer lined up who can help them find a baby to adopt.  Rosanna is speechless and demands that he leave.  Outside, Craig thinks he has Rosanna right where he wants her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Mike knocked out Mordecai, then rescued Katie. They heard Simon calling out for Katie, but Mike carried her out before they could find him. Just then, the building exploded. Katie told Mike she hated him for cheating her out of a final moment with her husband, and accused him of only saving her because he wanted her for himself. As Henry listened in, Carly confronted Craig, saying he needs to work things out with his wife. Molly suggested that, instead of giving up the bar, Craig should use a baby broker to find a baby to adopt. Although it could be illegal, Craig agreed, and told Rosanna that he has found a Canadian lawyer who thinks he can help them. Rose broke off Paul's kiss, and told him to go. Dusty saw him leaving, and, when Rose was too shaken to say what happened, he punched Paul. Paul told Dusty that he and Rose had kissed. Rose asked why he had kissed her, and he reminded her that she kissed him. He admitted he is not over her, and believed she isn't over him. She denied this, and ran out in tears. Molly made a pass at Dusty, but he turned her down. Henry told Paul about the pass, and Paul decided to have a talk with Molly. Chris worried that Alison is taking on too much responsibility, but she insisted she is fine. He told her he is staying at Tom and Margo's while they are gone.",
