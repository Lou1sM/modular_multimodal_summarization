Mike and Katie are still angry at Henry, believing that he pretended to be Katie's secret admirer, when Maddie was the one who perpetrated the online scam.  Katie dashes off to Tom and Margo's to ask them to let Maddie stay with them.  When they agree, Katie takes Maddie over to Casey's party for the evening.  Everyone agrees that Maddie will stay with the Hughes family after one night with Katie. As soon as Katie returns, Henry leaves, but he forgets the computer which is still on, showing a message to Katie from Byron.\n\n\nAt Casey's party, he slips outside with a blonde just before Maddie arrives.  Maddie sits on the couch, ignored by everyone, until someone spills a drink on her.  Irritated, she goes out to the patio where she overhears Casey putting the moves on the blonde.  Maddie's giggles give her away, and Casey is irate to find her eavesdropping.\n\n\nIn the bar at the Lakeview, Jack and Carly argue over her determination to keep Gwen's baby, even if she has to lie and cheat.  Jack tells her, \"I can't do this,\" but they are interrupted by a disturbance in the lobby.  There, Jennifer holds Rory and announces, \"This is my baby,\" while Paul, Barbara, and Emily look on.  Carly and Jack walk in and find J. J. and Parker watching while Jen refuses to let anyone else touch Rory. Emily leaves to take the boys home, and finally Paul gets Jen to give the baby to Carly.  As Carly leaves with Rory, Jen cries and cries for her baby.  Emily is stunned when Carly returns with the baby, since Emily expected Paul to tell everyone the truth that the baby is actually Jennifer's.  After Emily rushes out Carly's door, Jack returns and once again tries to reason with Carly that Gwen has the same feelings about her baby that Jennifer had expressed a few minutes before. In Barbara's suite, Jen, although sedated, still begs Paul to help her get her baby back.  Dr. Michaels tells Barbara that she must put Jennifer in the hospital for an internal medicine consult because of Jen's racing heartbeat. Paul watches with a stony face, and remains unmoved when Emily arrives and, outside the door, again insists that Paul must tell Jennifer the truth.\n\n\n",
