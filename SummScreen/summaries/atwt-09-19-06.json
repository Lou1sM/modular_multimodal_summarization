Lucy walks in and wants to hear what Barbara has to say for herself.  Barbara gets angry about Jennifer's death and is worried about Lucy and Dusty getting cozy and starting things up again.  Dusty escorts Lucy out and she tells him that Barbara is right, it hasn't been that long since Jen died.  He tells her that he needs a lot of friends right now and he feels that Jen would approve of Lucy being one of them.  Barbara and Dusty argue again about how dangerous Craig and Lucy could be for Johnny, but Dusty points out to Barbara that what she's really afraid of is that he's going to forget about Jennifer.  Barbara admits that Dusty is right.  Dusty helps her to see that no one is going to forget about Jennifer and that Lucy has done nothing wrong.  He also tells her that Lucy is not spying for Craig.  Barbara knows this, and asks him to apologize to Lucy for her.  Dusty leaves to take a walk and Barbara calls Lucinda.  She asks Lucinda to meet with her, they have a big problem.  Lucinda arrives and Barbara tells her that she doesn't want Lucy and Dusty getting involved.  Lucinda tries to make Barbara understand that Lucy and Dusty are adults and that Barbara should not get involved.  She tells Barbara that it would be a shame to let her life and Dusty's life end with Jennifer's death.\n\n\nLucy and Lucinda meet up at the hotel bar and Lucinda wants to know how things have been going with Lucy and Dusty.  Lucy tells her that Barbara doesn't approve and chased her out of their room.  She also tells Lucinda that she's right; she is still in love with Dusty.  Lucy is tired of pretending that she's not in love with Dusty and Lucinda tells her she doesn't have to pretend, just be his friend.  She also tells Lucy to stand up to Barbara.  Dusty finds Lucy at the bar and she tells him that Barbara had called Lucinda up for a meeting.  He assures her that Barbara doesn't hate her, she's just afraid.  \n\n\nEmily arrives at Henry's place to see how he's doing.  He has just returned from Chicago where he had to tell his family about everything that happened with Eve.  Emily wants to cheer him up by getting him involved in an \"adventure.\"  She wants to find Paul and wants Henry to help her do it.  Henry tries to talk her out of breaking into Paul's apartment.  She insists, and the next thing we see is Emily in a short brown wig pretending to be Barbara with Henry posing as a blind man next to her.  Henry picks the lock on Paul's door and they go in.  They hear the music but Emily thinks it's just what Paul usually does, leaving the TV or some music on when he goes out of town.\n\n\nPaul and Meg are hiding out at his place and are giddy about the thought of hiding from Emily.  Paul puts on some Hawaiian music and they pretend that they are on the beach and they head off to make love.  They are enjoying a romantic candlelit evening on the balcony when suddenly they hear Emily in Paul's apartment.  They wonder how she got in since Paul had the locks changed.  Meg decides to try to get rid of Emily.  She walks in and tells Emily to leave and they start to argue.  Emily accuses Meg of being jealous of her baby and Meg accuses Emily of making up \"genetic testing\" reasons for getting in touch with Paul.  Emily tells Meg that if she doesn't tell her where Paul is, she's going to tear the apartment apart and find out herself.  Emily starts to look around and finds it odd that Paul has left his laptop behind.  Meg threatens to call the police and Emily decides to leave.  Paul comes in and Meg yells at him about how frustrating it is to deal with Emily.  Henry and Emily are hanging around outside Paul's door and hear Paul and Meg talking.  Emily bursts in and tells them that if they think they're going to make a fool out of her and get away with it, they're mistaken.\n\n\nAt the church, Will is pleading with Gwen on her voicemail to call him.  Luke walks in and tells Will he knows that Jade is pregnant.  Will tells Luke that he's afraid this was the last straw with Gwen and it's all over.  Luke suggests that things could still work out with Gwen and Jade's pregnancy.  Gwen calls Will and tells him they need to talk.  Luke wishes Will well and leaves.  Gwen arrives at the church and tells him that she saw Jade.  Will tells her that since she called he's been sitting there praying for them.  He feels like with everything that's going on, he needs some extra help from somewhere to get through it all.  He tells her it's not God's forgiveness he needs, it's hers.  She tells him that a baby changes everything.  She reminds Will about how her baby brought them together and she's worried about the same happening with Will and Jade.  Will insists that his plans are with Gwen and that she's the one he loves.  Gwen tells him that she loves him, too, but that love isn't enough.  She confesses that she can't spend the rest of her life watching Jade give Will the one thing that she can't.  Will stops her from leaving and they discuss how things are going to change with a baby.  He assures her that he loves her; he only wants to be with her, and someday build a family of their own.  She tells him that she just can't be with him; she knows that she'll end up resenting him and walks out.\n\n\nIn Jade's room, Gwen wants to know why Jade is making her life miserable.  Gwen tells her she's been nothing but a friend to Jade and yet Jade still tries to take the one good thing that ever came into her life away.  She asks Jade why she hates her so much.  Gwen accuses Jade of setting up everything starting with getting Will to cheat in school.  She accuses Jade of sleeping with other guys and asks if she would be fine with taking a pregnancy test but decides that Jade would be able to scam her way through that, too.  They argue and things start to get heated and Gwen wants badly to smack Jade, but doesn't.  Jade tells Gwen that it's not her fault that Gwen couldn't give Will everything he needed.  Jade brings up Casey and Gwen's baby and compares it to the current situation.  She tells Gwen she's just going to have to live with whatever happens.  Luke arrives and Jade starts complaining about the fact that Gwen is blaming her for everything.  Luke warns her that she needs to realize that Will is not going to come running to her.  He knows how much Will loves Gwen and he doesn't think the pregnancy can change that.\n\n\n",
