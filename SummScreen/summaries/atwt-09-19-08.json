Lily shouted to Ethan, and Paul answered via the microphone Carly had brought to the site. Paul assured Lily that Ethan was fine. The rescue squad leader told Mike they could lift Ethan out with a standard hoist since someone was in the hole to put Ethan in the harness. As Mike looked on, Lily sobbed and clung to Holden, deeply relieved by the turn of events. \n\n\nMeg realized Paul had not returned to Fairwinds the previous night, and she began to worry about where he was. When she was unable to reach Paul on his cell phone, Meg grabbed her keys and left Fairwinds. Barbara arrived at Fairwinds looking for Paul to let him know she had the money he needed. Instead, she found James, who informed her that Paul had passed his test and no longer needed her money. James told Barbara that Paul was rescuing Ethan and would be the hero of Oakdale, assuming he didn't die. \n\n\nMeg went to the construction site, where Mike told her that Paul was down in the hole with Ethan. Barbara asked when they were going to get Paul out. As Meg tried to fill Barbara in, the workers brought Ethan back up to the surface via the hoist, and Holden took Ethan and put him in his mother's arms. The rescue squad leader suggested they take Ethan to the hospital to be examined thoroughly. \n\n\nAfter Holden and Lily left with Ethan, Mike told Meg they were ready to try to bring Paul up. However, at that moment, the walls of the hole caved in, piling dirt and rubble on top of Paul. Paul was able to reach the walkie-talkie that Mike had lowered down to him, and he let everyone know he was okay for the moment. Mike told Meg he wasn't sure whether they could get Paul out at all after the collapse. \n\n\nMeg became hysterical and pleaded with Mike and the rescue squad to rescue Paul immediately. Barbara tried to get Meg to let her take her back to Fairwinds, but Meg insisted she couldn't leave while Paul was still trapped. Mike picked up the walkie-talkie and asked Paul to tell Meg to go home and rest. Paul told Meg that for once, Mike was right, and he would feel better about Meg and the baby if Meg went home. Meg told Paul she loved him and that he had better come back to her, and then she made Mike promise to do whatever it took to get Paul out of the hole. \n\n\nAaron and Alison returned to the farm from their two-day honeymoon only to learn of Ethan's predicament. Emma received a call saying Ethan was being rescued, and everyone at the farm was elated. Emma and Faith left the room, and Alison told Aaron she was surprised no one had called them to tell them what was going on while they were out of town. Aaron said his family probably didn't want to ruin their honeymoon. Alison and Aaron talked about how wonderful their short honeymoon had been, and then they received another call, this time from Lily, who told them she was taking Ethan to the hospital to be examined, but that he appeared to be fine. \n\n\nAaron and Alison met Lily and Holden at the hospital. Chris came out and told them that Ethan appeared to be dehydrated, but was fine otherwise. Chris had put an I.V. line in Ethan's arm to replenish his fluids and had given him a sedative, but Chris thought Holden and Lily could take Ethan home in a couple of hours. Lily went to call Emma and Faith, and Holden went outside to discuss Ethan's needs with Chris. Alison and Aaron stayed with Ethan. Aaron told Alison that Ethan must be really tired, because he couldn't keep his eyes open. Alison looked and saw that Ethan wasn't breathing. She rushed out of the room shouting for Chris. \n\n\nChris was able to revive Ethan, and he told Holden that Ethan must have had some dirt lodged in his larynx. Chris apologized for not having caught it when he examined Ethan earlier. Holden told Ethan he was going to be fine. \n\n\nLily arrived at Emma's and told Emma and Faith the good news about Ethan. Faith said she wanted to apologize to Ethan for not watching him closely, but Lily assured Faith that what had happened wasn't Faith's fault. She then left to take Faith to see Ethan at the hospital. When they were reunited, Holden filled Lily in on Ethan's choking incident, but told her Chris had said Ethan was going to be fine. \n\n\nBarbara took Meg back to Fairwinds. Meg insisted that Barbara return to the accident site, because no one else there cared about Paul very much. Barbara finally agreed, after telling Meg to get some rest, and she left. James then made his presence known to Meg. Meg was startled, but James assured her he wasn't a dream. Meg asked how long James had been there. James told her he had been around since the problems started with the farm development project. Meg asked if the problems and the loan shark were James's doing, and he admitted that he was responsible. Meg told James he'd better make sure nothing happened to Paul. James said he couldn't do that, but Meg could. \n\n\nJames handed Meg some paperwork. Meg looked at it and saw that it was an agreement to give her child to James. James said he needed an heir. Meg asked why Paul wasn't his heir, but James said Paul was worthless and that Meg and Paul's child was James's only hope for the future. When Meg told James he was insane, he told her not to insult him, since the only way to save Paul's life was to sign the paperwork. Meg couldn't believe that James would let his own son die, but James said he didn't really care about Paul very much. Because Meg did care, James suggested she sign the paperwork, saying, \"You sign this document, I'll save Paul, and your child will inherit an empire.\" \n\n\nHenry awoke to find Derek watching him in the wine cellar. Derek received a phone call from James, instructing him to let Henry, Bonnie, and Vienna go. Derek passed the news along to Henry and untied him. He told Henry he would take him to where Bonnie and Vienna were being held. \n\n\nBonnie and Vienna awoke in the warehouse horrified to find they had slept huddled together for warmth. They decided to work together to try to find food; Vienna opened some lockers and found canned corn, but it was stale. Vienna managed to cook the corn to a palatable taste, thereby impressing Bonnie a little. As they were eating, they heard someone shouting outside the building. It was Henry, who had arrived with Derek. When Henry realized the warehouse was locked, he asked Derek how to get in, but Derek told him that getting the women out was Henry's problem, and he left. \n\n\nHenry spotted a gasoline can and a soda can and rigged a Molotov cocktail. He warned Bonnie and Vienna to take cover, and then he lit the improvised bomb. It did the trick, blasting open the warehouse door, but in the process, Henry was hurt. Vienna shouted for help, but both she and Bonnie were shocked when Derek arrived. Derek said he had dropped Henry off and then had heard an explosion, so he had returned to find out what had happened. He suggested they take Henry to Derek's car. Vienna and Bonnie said they didn't want to go anywhere with Derek, but Derek pointed out that their options were limited. \n\n\nAfter they arrived at the hospital, Derek took Bonnie aside and said he couldn't stay. He apologized for getting Bonnie involved in the whole situation and told her he hadn't had a choice. Meanwhile, Vienna sat with Henry and told him he had saved her life. Bonnie walked in and said, \"Mine, too!\" Bonnie told Vienna that Derek had gone, and Vienna told Henry that Derek had probably saved his life. Bonnie pointed out that Derek was hardly a hero, but Henry said he didn't think Derek had had much choice. Bonnie said Derek had told her the same thing. Henry said that James Stenbeck had been calling the shots. Bonnie said everyone always blamed James for everything, but it wasn't possible this time because James was locked up in prison. Henry said he had seen and talked to James and that James had imprisoned him so that he couldn't tell anyone that James was in Oakdale. When Bonnie and Vienna had gone looking for Henry, James had Derek imprison them, too. \n\n\nAt the construction/accident site, Paul waited for Mike and the rescue squad to finalize their rescue operation. Suddenly, Derek appeared in the hole with Paul. Paul asked what Derek was doing there, and Derek said he had come to rescue Paul, having followed Paul's father's directions. Paul asked how he could rescue him, and Derek said there was a tunnel that only James knew about, because James had dug the tunnel. Paul said he would kill James, and then he punched Derek and knocked him down. \n\n\nAbove ground, the rescue squad was almost ready to attempt to rescue Paul when the walls of the hole caved in once again. The rescue squad leader took a look at the resulting damage and declared that no one could have survived. Meanwhile, Paul rushed back to Fairwinds, only to find that neither James nor Meg was there.\n \n\n\n\n\n",
