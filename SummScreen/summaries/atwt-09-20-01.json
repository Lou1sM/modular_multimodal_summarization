Dante takes this all in from afar and he approaches the police chief who assures him that Luke is dead. Back at the villa, Lily finds a note on the back of the death certificate which tells them to go to the church tomorrow. Troubled by Jennifer, Bryant boasts to his father that he's not giving up on her. Meanwhile, Jennifer falls for Billy's kind words and ends up making love to him for the first time. Feeling guilty for what they've done, both agree not to tell Bryant for fear of hurting him and split up.
