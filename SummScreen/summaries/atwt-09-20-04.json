Lily is adamant in her refusal to go along with the plan to release Will, because she is still certain that Will's repeated attempts to kill Rose were deliberate.  After Jessica and Paul leave, Holden tells Lily that he is considering signing the petition, but Lily tells Holden that she wants Will locked up until someone proves to her that he has changed.  In spite of Lily's feelings, Holden leaves to find Jessica and sign the petition.\n\n\nBarbara awakens in the mental hospital to find herself restrained in her bed, with Will at her bedside.  Will coldly tells Barbara that his plan has worked out \"exactly as it was supposed to.\"  He further tells her that his plan is to get himself out of the state hospital, but that he intends for his mother to stay there, \"where you belong.\"  He tells Barbara that he wants to get away from her and all her hate.   Barbara cries and begs Will, \"Untie me and let me hold you.\"  Will snarls, \"I wouldn't untie you if the room was on fire,\" and leaves Barbara hysterically crying for him.  After Will returns to his room, Paul comes in and tells Will that he and Jessica are working to get him released.  Will pretends that he is sorry for killing Rose and that he is afraid of Barbara, so Paul hugs him and promises to stand by his brother.\n\n\nSkydog and Wyoming call Carly in response to Carly's plea on WOAK to help find Jack. They make the call from the pay phone in the parking lot where they have been hanging around and begging for money.  They sound so drugged that Carly hangs up on them.  They call Carly again and ask for money, telling Carly that they saw Jack in the parking lot.  Convinced that they only want money for drugs, Carly hangs up on them again, but that only convinces Skydog and Wyoming to go to Carly's house since she won't speak  to them on the telephone.  They break into the house and threaten Carly and Parker.\n\n\nAt nurse Julia's house, Jack and Julia have a romantic morning, talking about their night of lovemaking and Jack's marriage proposal.  Julia is afraid that Jack's homicidal ex-wife (the old Julia) will find Jack and might be a threat to them.  Julia is called in to work, so Jack leaves to take J. J. to a baseball game.  Julia finds the bottle with Parker's message to Jack in J. J.'s backpack, and she also finds a note from her ex-husband to J. J.  Just then she gets a call telling her that she does not have to go to work after all, so she leaves to confront her ex-husband about the note in the backpack.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jack and Parker arrive for the ball game at the parking lot where Skydog and Wyoming had been hanging out.  His detective skills resurfacing, Jack recognizes their tire tracks, and goes to the same pay phone to call Julia to warn her.  Instead, he instinctively calls Carly instead.  Carly, surrounded and frightened by Skydog and Wyoming, picks up the telephone and hears, \"Honey, it's me, Jack.\"\n\n\n",
