Emily is taken aback by this information.\n\n\nAt the Church, they are preparing for the rehearsal and everyone is there but Alison.  Tom, Margo and Casey have arrived.

Susan tries to put it off, until Alison can arrive, not knowing that Aaron has gone after Alison and is talking with her now.

He finally blurts out that he loves her.\n\n\nAs the rehearsal proceeds, Emily runs out saying that she cannot do this.

They decide to marry, but realize that Jack doesn't have any legal ID.  He calls Frank, his boss and asks him for help.\n\n\nJack is connected to Carly on the phone, but doesn't realize who she is.  The two hippies have tried to sell information to Carly as to Jack's whereabouts but things go awry.  Rosanna arrives at the door as the two men race out.  Carly is disconnected and is yelling that she was talking to Jack.  Rosanna, at this point, isn't sure what has transpired.  A mix-up in circumstances keeps Jack and Carly apart once again.  Rosanna says that Carly must call Hal.  She does so and he comes over.  Rosanna can describe the van the two men were in and perhaps they have Jack or know information about him.
