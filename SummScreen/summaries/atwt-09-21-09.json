    "soap_central": "\n\n \nAt the farm, Jack told Meg that he had fixed the rototiller, but he gave no guarantees.  Meg remembered that Holden had always been tinkering with the farm equipment to keep it in working order, but he was gone, and she missed him.  Jack offered to fill in for Meg's big brother, so she told him that something was bothering her.  Meg said that Lily was acting strangely, and she related the story about how her sister-in-law had taken sleeping pills and walked into the pond.\n\n\nMeg was concerned about the welfare of Holden's children, and she confided that Lily had \"all but attacked\" her over Damian.  Meg called what was happening between Lily and Damian \"inappropriate behavior,\" and she was worried.  Jack needed details, but Meg would only say that Lily and Damian were up to things that the children should not see.\n\n\nAt Java, Noah mentioned to Luke that Luke still seemed upset at his mother and Damian.  Luke admitted that he had learned that Lily and Damian had kissed even before Holden had left for Kentucky.  Unfortunately, Faith had witnessed the kiss, and she was an astute observer of people.  Noah likened that kiss to the incident when Luke and Brian Wheatley had kissed, but Luke said that he had been drunk.  Noah defended Lily by saying that her whole life had just been turned upside down, and he counseled Luke to let it go.\n\n\nLuke, however, was convinced that Lily was the reason that Damian had returned to Oakdale. He said that Holden's accident had simply cleared the way for Damian's original plan.  Luke decided to try to help his mother, and he and Noah kissed.  Mason approached and watched the lovers kiss.  After Luke left, Mason asked Noah how he felt about another road trip for just the two of them.  He produced two passes to the prestigious Minnesota Film Festival.  Noah was thrilled, but he worried about missing some important classes.  Mason offered to contact Noah's  professors and clear the way for him.\n\n\nNoah was excited, but then he said that Luke's family was suffering, and he felt that he needed to stay in town for Luke.  Mason said that he was just a little bit jealous, but Noah did not believe that.  Mason said that he envied the relationship that Luke and Noah had where they did everything 50-50.  He said that his relationship with George had not been like that, and they had failed as a couple.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Damian asked her how she felt, and Lily's answer was that she thought she was the worst mother in the world.  Damian attempted to reassure her and gave her a kiss, which Faith observed through the window.  That first kiss turned into a more passionate one, and Faith continued to watch, as Jack walked up to the door.  He asked Faith why she was not in school, and the girl said that she had left school to go home, but she had not gone inside because her mother was there making out with Damian.\n\n\nJack walked in unannounced and said it looked as if he should have called first.  He asked Faith to go to her room so that he could talk with Lily, and the girl complied.  Lily was surprised that her daughter minded Jack so well, considering how she had been acting for the previous several weeks.  Jack asked what was going on between Lily and Damian, and Damian spoke up and told Jack that it was none of his business.  Jack defended his position by reminding Damian that he was Holden's cousin and considered Holden his best friend.  He also felt that he had an obligation to Holden's children.\n\n\nDamian took offense, and Lily also bristled and said that Jack should say what he came to say in front of Damian, too.  Jack told them that the kids, and particularly Faith, needed someone in their lives on whom they could count.  He offered to take Faith, Natalie, and Ethan to stay with the family at the Snyder farm for a while, but Lily got upset and cried.  Jack lit into Damian for trying to worm his way back into the family.  Lily then got angry and brought up that Jack had not done such a good job in raising Parker with all his troubles.\n\n\nJack tried to calm Lily by saying that it was way too early for her kids to have to deal with a new father figure, especially if it was Damian.  Damian asked if Meg had put Jack up to the \"attack,\" but Jack only said that while Meg had brought up the subject, the whole family was concerned.  Damian stormed out suddenly, while Lily told Jack that he was wasting his time with her.  She claimed that Damian kept her strong, but Jack was not appeased.  He gave one more pitch for taking the kids to the farm, but Lily again refused.\n\n\nFaith walked into the living room and announced that she wanted to go with Jack and live at the farm.  Luke also arrived and wanted to be brought up-to-date.  Lily and Faith argued about where the girl should stay, and that caused Lily to turn on Jack and shout that her children were going nowhere.  Jack backed down and offered to take Faith back to school, as Luke thought of a solution and volunteered to move back to the house temporarily.  Lily asked if her son was to be the \"designated spy,\" but Luke said that what she and Damian were doing was just plain wrong.  He said he was going back to his apartment to pack, but he was returning as a helper, not a spy.\n\n\nDamian barged into the farm kitchen and accused Meg of believing that Lily was unfit to care for her own children.   Meg appeared innocent that Jack had gotten so involved, but she did admit that she had mentioned her concerns for her brother's children to him.  Damian told Meg to mind her own business, and then he softened and confessed that he had made mistakes in their relationship.  He blamed those on Lily, however, but Meg did not agree.  She was hurt that Damian's actions were a denial of Holden's existence.\n\n\nDamian became self-righteous and declared that \"some things were meant to be.\"  He asserted that he and Lily belonged together, and he walked out, passing a returning Jack at the door.  Jack comforted Meg, who was in tears, and said that Holden always thought that Damian wanted more from Lily than he admitted.  Meg called herself an idiot for falling in love with a Grimaldi.\n\n\nLuke returned to Java and asked Mason to speak with Noah alone.  Luke said that he hated to do it, but he had to move back home for a short while for the sake of his family.  Noah totally understood, and Luke thanked him for that.  The boys hugged, while Mason watched.  Luke left to go pack, so Noah told Mason that he would be able to accompany his mentor to the film festival, after all.\n\n\nIn Maeve and Eb's cabin in Kentucky, Holden was once again chained to his cot, but Maeve was tied up in a chair in the kitchen.  Holden tried to convince Eb that he had talked Maeve into helping him escape, but Eb was not satisfied, and promised his wife some painful retribution.  Holden said again that he could give Eb some money for a ransom, and all that Eb had to do was to call Holden's wife.  Eb told Holden to forget it, because he knew that Holden would call the cops as soon as Eb let him go.\n\n\nEb insisted that he wanted Skaggs's money, because they had been partners.  Maeve reminded Eb that Skaggs was dead, so Eb had better plan on calling Lily if he wanted any cash.  Eb finally agreed that he would call Lily, and if she delivered the money, he would let Holden go; however, if Holden said one word to the cops about Maeve, Eb would put a bullet between her eyes.  Holden assured his captor that Lily would deliver the money to wherever Eb wanted, but he thought that she would want some proof that Holden was really alive.  He suggested that Eb take him to a phone, so that Holden could talk to his wife himself.\n\n\nEb laughed, but he finally agreed on that plan.  Someone drove up the path that led to the cabin, so Eb quickly ran to look.  Maeve told Holden that she was sure that Eb would kill her the minute he got the ransom money.  Eb dashed back and untied Maeve and ordered her to get Holden gagged and under the cot.  Then Eb hid behind the privacy curtain in the bed area and demanded that Maeve answer the loud knock on the door.  Officer Grady from the Kentucky State Patrol walked in and took a cursory look around.\n\n\nGrady asked Maeve if she knew an \"Eberly Stone,\" and she replied that he was her husband.  Eb walked out from behind the curtain then and introduced himself.  The officer began asking him about an escaped felon named Skaggs, but Eb denied any knowledge of his friend.  The cop said that he knew otherwise, but they just didn't have enough proof to nail Eb for the same bank job. He said that once they did, they would throw the book at him, too.  The officer left, and Eb ordered Maeve to take off Holden's gag.\n\n\nEb was panicky and declared that the ransom scene was not going to happen, and he said he had to \"get rid of the evidence,\" so he pointed his gun at Holden's head.  Holden became desperate, and he promised that Lily would give Eb as much money as he wanted.  He urged Eb to take him to a phone, and the man could have his money within an hour.  Eb had no other choice, so he put Holden in his truck and drove to a phone at the nearest convenience store.  He put his gun to Holden's back and told him the rules.\n\n\nDamian returned to Lily's and told her how upset Meg was.  He admitted that they had made a bit of a mess of their lives, but Lily answered, \"Not any more.\"  She said that they could not sleep together anymore because she could not risk hurting her children further.  Damian blamed Jack, but Lily said that she needed to know just how badly she had wounded the kids.  Damian promised to wait for her as long as it took, and they hugged.  Lily went to get them drinks, and the phone rang.  Damian answered it, and Officer Grady asked to speak to Lily.\n\n\nDamian identified himself, and Grady remembered that Damian had been with the Snyder family to visit the accident site.  Grady said that there had been a new development in the case that Lily needed to know about, but Damian offered to take a message.  The officer said that the DNA test results on the body in the burned truck had returned, and the body was not that of Holden Snyder.  Damian was stunned, but he stalled answering when Lily returned and asked who had called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Holden dialed his home number, but he got a busy signal.  Eb told him to dial it again, but just then Officer Grady walked out of the convenience store, so Eb ordered Holden to hang up immediately.\n\n\n",
