Katie enters the room to ask if there is word about Simon, since she still hopes that he might have survived the explosion somehow.  A policeman enters to say that they have found a body, and hands Katie Simon's cross necklace and his wedding ring for her to identify.  Katie asks to see the body to identify it, but the policemen tell her that it will not be necessary for her to identify it.  Katie insists that she wants to take the body back to Oakdale, then she cries, blaming herself for being the bait, and thus causing Simon's death.  When Mike tries to comfort her, she pushes him away saying, \"I don't want you near me, ever again.\"  Mike is stunned when Katie goes on to blame him for not letting her go into the explosion after Simon, but he declares that he will never be sorry for keeping Katie alive.  Katie puts Simon's cross around her neck, and his ring on the finger next to her wedding ring.  She intends to go directly home to Oakdale and not wait for the body to be released, and states, \"I don't want you to do anything for me, Mike - ever again.\"\n\n\nAt Carly's house, Carly oversleeps and finds Rosanna taking care of Sage.  The sisters discuss Rosanna's situation with Craig, and Rosanna tells Carly that she is ready to give up the idea of adopting a baby with Craig.  Meanwhile, at Java Underground, Craig takes a card bearing the name of a Canadian lawyer from Molly and leaves to \"go get a baby.\"  Craig goes to Fairwinds to pack for the trip.  There he finds Lucy working on college applications while Aaron despairs over finding a new job with no education.  While Aaron goes out to move his truck, Lucy begs Craig to help Aaron find a new job.  After grumbling for a while, Craig gives Aaron a card from Java Underground to call for a job.  Aaron is thrilled, but tells Lucy that he is going to keep the job a secret until he actually gets it.  Craig calls Dusty and asks him to hire Aaron as he leaves the house.  Craig appears at Carly's door to ask Rosanna if she still wants a baby, because he is on his way to Canada to see a lawyer about adopting a baby.  Rosanna, thrilled, jumps into his arms.  She agrees to come back to Fairwinds to help Lucy with her college applications.\n\n\nAs soon as Craig leaves Java Underground, Paul and Dusty arrive and Molly watches Paul taunt Dusty about his kiss with Rose.  When Paul leaves, Dusty mutters, \"I could kill that guy.\"  Molly, coming on to Dusty, tells Dusty that the fact that Rose did not show up to meet him the night before is giving him a message.  Paul and Henry have wired Java, and are outside listening to the conversation.   Paul gloats that Molly is doing exactly what he wants her to do.  Dusty and Molly, with their lips inches apart, continue to talk about the kiss and Molly tries to convince Dusty that Rose's feelings toward him have changed.  Dusty accuses Molly of trying to push his buttons, and Molly responds, \"I have some buttons I'd like for you to push.\"  In spite of Molly's efforts, Dusty goes back to work.  Paul then calls Molly and asks her to meet him at Paul's penthouse.  When he disconnects, he tells Henry, \"It's only a matter of time until Rose is mine.\"  Molly leaves to meet Paul.  Aaron enters Java to ask Dusty for a job.  Aaron is delighted when Dusty hires him.  Dusty tells Aaron to buy a new suit and charge it to Java, then as Aaron leaves, Dusty further instructs him, \"Cut your hair.\"  When Molly arrives at the penthouse, Paul tells Molly that he would like to help her get together with Dusty.  Of course, Molly tells him that she knows that what Paul really wants is to get together with Rose himself, and that he does not care about Molly and Dusty.\n\n\nAt the Roller Palace, Rose is so distracted that she snips a customer's ear.  Later, she admits to Mitzi that she kissed Paul and that she has discovered that she still has feelings for Paul.   Fighting these feelings, Rose tells Mitzi that she is determined to stick with her commitment to Dusty, and that she will put Paul out of her mind.  Rose sends Mitzi home for the day, and Dusty enters the shop.  When Rose professes her love for him, Dusty insists that they get things straight about Paul.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The Australian police told Katie and Mike that a badly-burned body was found in the rubble of the explosion. They found her crucifix on the body, so she assumed that it was Simon. She told Mike he should have left her to die with Simon, and told him she never wanted to see him again. Lucy asked Craig to help Aaron find a job, so he arranged for Dusty to hire Aaron at the new club. Carly apologized to Rosanna for confronting Craig, and they discussed their mutual skepticism about Craig's sincerity when he said that he now wants to adopt. Craig surprised and thrilled Rosanna when he arrived and told her that he was on his way to meet the lawyer, unaware that he was actually meeting with a baby broker. Paul and Henry listened in as Molly needled Dusty about Rose. She said that if they were meant to be, things wouldn't keep getting in their way. He insisted that Rose wanted to be with him. Paul told Molly that he wanted her to get back together with Dusty, so she deduced that he wanted Rose back. Rose admitted to Mitzi that she still had feelings for Paul, but insisted that she wanted to be with Dusty. Dusty arrived and said they needed to get things straight about Paul once and for all.",
