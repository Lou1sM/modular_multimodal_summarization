Chris pronounced the patient ready to go home, and Aaron decided he wanted to go with him to share in the celebration of the boy's homecoming. He asked Alison to come along, but she said she could not take the time away from work. Lily and Holden brought Ethan out, and Aaron left with them. Alison sought out Chris and thanked him for his help. Chris told her Morty, the pup, missed her and Chris invited her to spend some time with him. Even though Alison told Aaron that she could not take time away from work, she did find someone to take her shift so that she could go to the Lakeview and see the dog. Chris was there by then, and Alison rattled on nervously, making Chris suspicious that all was not well in Alison and Aaron's marriage. Alison denied that, but Chris grabbed and kissed her. She dashed out telling Chris that it was \"too late.\" \n\n\nJack went to the farm and talked with Emma. His aunt told him that Janet's things were still there and that he should not give up on her. Holden called to tell Emma that Ethan was home at Lily's, and she left to see her grandson. She invited Jack to come along for some family time, but he declined. \n\n\nThinking that her son had been killed in the cave-in, Barbara was hysterical at the construction site until she got a call from Paul. He asked her to come immediately to Fairwinds. Meg was missing, and Paul was sure that James was at fault. Paul questioned the maid, but she had no idea where Meg had gone. When Barbara arrived full of questions, Paul explained that James had Meg, so Barbara suggested he call the police. Paul would not consider that, so his mother offered another solution. She told him to call Jack, who was no longer on the Oakdale police force but was a good investigator. This Paul did, and Jack arrived and asked questions, particularly about how Paul had initially contacted Derek Coburn, the loan shark. Paul explained that the connection was through Henry Coleman, and Jack determined that was the place to start. \n\n\nAt Lily's, Holden and Lily connected over the joy of their son's safe return. Mike dropped in and broke the mood between them. Aaron had a discussion with his father about marriage, while Lily explained to Mike how Paul had gotten out of the hole safely through a tunnel. Mike promised to call her later, and he let Lily get back to her family. Emma offered to take the children to the farm for some of her cookies and to give Lily and Holden some time to rest after their ordeal. After the family left, Holden suggested Lily catch up with Mike if she so wished, but Lily told him she did not want to be with Mike. She offered Holden a chance to shower and to change into some of his clothes that were still at her house. Lily took a shower while Holden went looking through a dresser in their former bedroom for his clothes. Lily came out wearing only a towel and headed directly for the bed. She appeared exhausted, so Holden went to take a shower. When he came out, Lily was awake and asked Holden not to go. Instead, she welcomed him back into her bed. \n\n\nJack and Paul found Henry recuperating in a bed at Memorial after the explosion at the warehouse. They questioned him about Derek and James's relationship, and Jack asked Henry how to locate the loan shark. Henry did not know, but gave the two of them a good lead. The lead turned out to be Bonnie McKechnie at Metro, so Jack and Paul went there to talk with her. They convinced Bonnie to call Derek and invite him to Metro, and Derek seemed all too willing to get back into Bonnie's good graces. When Coburn arrived, Jack and Paul jumped him and Jack began questioning him concerning Meg. Derek confirmed that James had taken Meg, and Paul went ballistic. Jack asked Bonnie to call her cousin Dallas at the police station to take Derek into custody. \n\n\nVienna fed cookies to Henry at the hospital. He told her that James had kidnapped Meg, and apologized to his lover for not protecting her well enough. Vienna was forgiving and even offered to sing Henry a Swedish lullaby. \n\n\nAt the farm, Emma cornered Aaron to have a serious discussion. She had overheard a comment Aaron had made about having a baby with Alison right away, and she wanted to caution her grandson not to rush into an instant family until the bride and groom had some time together as a married couple. Alison came in, looking desperate, and asked for some privacy with Aaron. They went to his bedroom and Alison told him she wanted a baby immediately and the two began to make love. Aaron questioned her sudden change of heart, but Alison was not talking. \n\n\nJack and Paul followed Coburn to the station, hoping he could give them a lead on James. Bonnie showed up, as well, and Derek asked to speak with her alone. Bonnie only agreed to the conference in case it would save Meg. Derek was angry that Bonnie had set him up at Metro, but he still asked Bonnie to represent him as his lawyer. Bonnie claimed she was his victim and had no interest in acting as his attorney. She refused and went outside to tell Paul what Derek had requested. Paul begged her to accept the offer because Derek Coburn was the one person who might lead them to his wife.\n\n\n",

Barbara pleads with Mike to get Paul out of the collapsed hole, but he tells her that there is nothing more for them to do. Emma and Jack talk about his life now. Paul calls a shocked Barbara to tell her that he is ok, as an angered, Barbara relays that to Mike after she feels he was ready to pack it in. Barbara finds out from Paul that James took Meg, and she suggests he work with Jack because he resigned from the force. Paul calls Jack. Lily, Holden take Ethan home and have a small family celebration. Holden looks depressed when Mike shows up outside. Alison tells Aaron that she can't blow off work so she can go home to Ethan's party, but then she later blows off work to go to Chris' to see Morty supposedly. When Alison overdoes it trying to convince Chris about how happy she is, they share another kiss. Paul tells Jack what happened with James, Derek and Meg and he agrees to help. They go in search of Henry to find out about Derek. The Snyder party ends early, as it is suggested that Lily and Holden get some rest, as the kids head off with Emma. Holden assumes Lily is going to go be with Mike and even offers to look after the kids, but Lily doesn't want him to leave. Jack and Paul talk with Henry about Derek. Aaron talks about having kids. Jack and Paul go to Bonnie for help with Derek. She finally agrees to call him. Derek agrees to meet her at Metro where an enraged Paul and Jack are waiting. Derek doesn't give up any answer, as Jack and Paul play good cop, bad cop so to speak. Jack runs Derek downtown to see Dallas. Lily wants to take a shower and asks Holden if he would like to stick around to take one after so they can relax together. Emma talks to Aaron about waiting a little while before he and Alison try to have kids. Alison pulls away from Chris, who pleads with her to reconsider her marriage. Alison tells him that it is too late and heads home and right into Aaron's arms. She desperately comes onto Aaron, who is a little stunned by how she is acting. She tells him that she wants to have a baby with him \u0096 now. Aaron is unsure at first considering her quick turn around, but gives in when Alison tells him that she is sure now. Dallas questions Derek, as an impatient Paul waits. Bonnie arrives at the station and Derek wants to talk with her only. Paul pleads with her to talk with him. Derek wants her to represent him, but Bonnie tells him that he is crazy; she was his victim and will not represent him. When she tells Paul and Dallas, Paul again pleads with her to do as he asks because if he will talk about where Meg is, it would be to his lawyer. Holden is in Lily's room when she comes out of the shower. Holden thanks Lily for keeping his clothes for him. Chris heads into work when he can't get Allusion off of his mind. After Holden showers, he touches a sleeping Lily's hair. She awakens, takes his hand and asks him not to leave. He lies down beside her, tells her she is beautiful, which leads to a kiss. When Lily pulls back gently, Holden asks what is wrong. She tells him that she is so happy he is home, as they fall back on the bed and begin to make love.",
