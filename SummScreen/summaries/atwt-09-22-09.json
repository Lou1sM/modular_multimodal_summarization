He grabbed his jacket and left for the cemetery, where he found Emily putting flowers on the grave of their infant daughter, Jennifer.  Paul said he knew where Emily would be as soon as he saw the date, because it was Jennifer's third birthday.  They shared some poignant moments remembering their little girl, and Paul wished the girl a happy birthday.  Emily shed some tears and said that her life with Paul was almost complete; only one thing was missing.\n\n\nThey went back home, and Paul mused that perhaps they had not been ready to be good parents when Jenny was born, but Emily thought they would have stepped up and done well.  Paul said that perhaps they could still have a baby, but Emily said it was too late.  She explained what had happened to her stored eggs, and rejoiced that she had two fine sons, and Paul had Eliza.  Paul said there were other ways to get a baby, and Emily asked if they were seriously talking about adoption.  Paul remembered that they were still on their honeymoon, so he began kissing Emily.\n\n\nAt Lily's, Damian had just received the phone call that told him the DNA result had verified that the body in the burned truck was not Holden's.  Damian lied and said the call had been a wrong number, but Lily remarked that he looked as if he had seen a ghost.  Lily could not understand what would have upset Damian so much, but Damian said that he had to go away for a few days on business to San Francisco.  Lily was shocked that he was leaving her, but Damian said he was making things difficult for her family, so it would be better if he left town for a short while.\n\n\nLily, however, felt that Damian was punishing her for declaring a moratorium on their sleeping together until the children were better adjusted to life without their dad.  Damian assured her that a bit of distance between the two of them would benefit her family. Luke walked in, and Lily mentioned Damian's business trip, which took Luke by surprise, too.  Damian said goodbye to Lily and walked out, and Luke declared that he would not miss his father.  Luke hoped that Lily would end her relationship with Damian, so he was disappointed when his mother said that she would make her own life choices when she was ready.\n\n\nLily tried to assure her son that no one would ever replace Holden in her heart.  She went into the kitchen, as the phone rang.  Luke answered it, and Eb Stone asked for Lily Snyder.  Luke introduced himself as Lily's son, so Eb made his pitch to him.  He asked for $100,000 in cash, all in small bills, or Lily would never see her husband again.  Eb said he was holding Luke's father, and he would be in touch with delivery directions.  \n\n\nA frantic Luke explained to Lily that someone had said that Holden was alive and being held for ransom.  Luke had his doubts, but Lily was filled with hope, and she asked Luke to call Jack immediately.\n\n\nOutside the convenience store in rural Kentucky, Eb marshaled Holden back to the truck after the aborted call to Lily.  Officer Grady had exited the store, and Eb was afraid to hang around there and use the phone again.  Holden tried to persuade Eb to try again, but seeing the cop had spooked Eb.  They returned to the cabin where Maeve was still tied to her chair.  Eb put Holden on the cot and refastened his shackles.  Eb did not trust Maeve enough to untie her, and he repeated his threat to shoot her if Holden made any attempt to rescue her after he was freed.\n\n\nMaeve played Eb by saying that she had been dumb to let Holden lead her astray, and she vowed that she loved only Eb.  Holden butted in and suggested that Eb buy a disposable phone so that they could make the call right from the cabin.  That would get them their money, so Eb left to go buy a phone.  Holden asked Maeve if she was really planning on running off with her husband after they got the money, and she admitted that she didn't know.  She acknowledged that the most important thing was to get Holden free, unharmed.\n\n\nHolden again promised to do whatever he could to help Maeve get away from her dreadful circumstances. Eb returned with the news that he and Maeve would soon be \"rollin' in the dough.\" He said he had made the first call and spoken to \"the boy.\"  They made plans to drive to California, but Holden interrupted and said it was time to call Lily and give her the drop-off directions if Eb wanted to get the money right away.\n\n\nAt the farm, Meg and Jack talked about the situation between Lily and Damian.  Jack said that he had wanted to punch Damian in the face when he had seen him sitting on Holden's couch.  He also warned Meg that if her \"concern\" for Lily was based more on her feelings towards Damian than her worries about Lily, then Meg would only make things worse.  Meg said that she could not turn off her feelings for Damian like a faucet, but Jack asked her not to make the family choose between her and Lily.  He told her to let Damian go.\n\n\nJack answered Luke's call about Holden, and he promised to be right there.  He told Meg that Lily had received a possible ransom call, and he dashed to Lily's.  Lily was hoping hard that the police identification on Holden's body had been wrong, but Jack told her not to get her hopes up.  He would not let her go to the bank to collect the money, because he told her that they were going to \"play it by the book.\"  \n\n\nJack said he would go to Kentucky immediately to talk to the local cops and look for clues.  Lily had to stay home to answer any more calls and also for her children.  Luke offered to accompany Jack, and Lily gave them her blessing.  She admonished Luke to bring his father home to her.\n\n\nDamian's \"business trip to San Francisco\" was just a ploy, and he actually flew to Kentucky.  He met Officer Grady at the convenience store, and the cop said that he had been totally shocked when the DNA report had arrived.  He said they did not know who the body in the truck was, but they were going back to the accident scene to look around.  Grady thought, however, that the chances were still great that Holden was dead of some other cause.  Damian asked him not to tell Mrs. Snyder anything until they knew more, but Grady found that a very unusual request.\n\n\nDamian convinced the officer that Mrs. Snyder had suffered enough and did not need to hear gory details if her husband had been devoured by a wild animal in the forest or something equally as gruesome.  Grady still felt that Mrs. Snyder had a right to know what was going on, but he promised to wait until they had some more information.  Damian said he was going to the crash site, and Grady warned him to stay out of the officers' way.  Another patrolman approached and asked to speak with Grady.  He said that an Oakdale policeman had just phoned about a ransom call, and the hostage was Holden Snyder.\n\n\nLily waited impatiently at home for another call from the kidnapper with the delivery instructions.  Meg rang the doorbell and said that she had heard the news.  She seemed very compassionate towards Lily, until she casually mentioned that Lily and Damian had \"jumped the gun.\"  Lily resented Meg's nastiness, but Meg continued to maintain that if Holden were really alive, then it put Lily in \"an awkward situation.\"  Lily was furious, but her phone rang, and she grabbed it.\n\n\nLily's caller was Eb, and he refused to take the time to let Lily speak with her husband.  He told her to write down directions for the delivery of the money, and Lily pretended to do so.  Eb hung up, and Meg asked if they should call Emma and alert her, but Lily said she did not want to get Emma's hopes up.  Meg got vindictive again and demanded to know exactly what Lily was planning to tell Holden about her jumping into bed with Damian, practically right after the funeral.  Lily said that she was sick of Meg's insults, and they could either call a truce, or Meg could leave.  Meg chose to walk out, but not before another rude comment.  Lily sat and prayed for Holden's safe return.\n\n\nHolden wanted Eb to tell him what Lily's response had been to the second call, but Eb couldn't remember.  He did say that she promised to do as instructed, and Holden vouched for her trustworthiness.  Maeve asked Eb to untie her, but he still refused.  He said it was time to collect the money, so they were to say farewell to \"poor Eb\" because, when he returned, he would be $100,000 richer.  Eb had barely pulled out in his truck when Holden and Maeve heard another car approach.  Someone pounded on the door, and the two of them yelled for help.\n\n\nOfficer Grady entered  with his gun drawn, and he saw Holden in chains and Maeve tied to a chair.  He recognized Holden right away, and began untying Maeve, who knew where there was another key to the shackles.  Grady took the key and began working on Holden's chains when suddenly Eb sneaked up on the officer and hit him hard over the head with the butt of his pistol.   Grady fell unconscious, and Eb relieved him of his handcuffs and put them on Maeve. Then he dragged Grady outside and dumped him into the trunk of his police cruiser.  Eb got in the front seat and drove away.\n\n\nHolden and Maeve had a heart-to-heart talk, and he said that he would love Lily until the day he died, crushing any hope that Maeve might have had for a future with Holden.  Tears slipped out of Maeve's eyes and ran down her face.\n\n\nLuke and Jack flew to Kentucky and then took a car to the convenience store, looking for Officer Grady.  Jack continued to call him, but the patrolman did not answer.  Luke was excited about the possibility of being able to say some things to his father that he hadn't had a chance to say yet.  Jack, however, was worried about Grady, so he called Lily who told him that the drop-off place for the ransom was the crash site.  Lily was worried what would happen when the kidnapper realized that there was no ransom money, but Jack said that they would have him in custody by that time.  Jack and Luke headed for the site.\n\n\nDamian arrived at the crash site first, and he looked down into the ravine.  He said out loud, \"Where are you, Holden?\" just as Eb approached him from the rear.  Eb asked if Damian was the man Mrs. Snyder had sent with the money, but Damian said he didn't know what Eb was talking about.  Eb pulled his gun and asked for the $100,000.  Jack and Luke ran up and realized the situation, as Eb threatened all of them.\n\n\n",
