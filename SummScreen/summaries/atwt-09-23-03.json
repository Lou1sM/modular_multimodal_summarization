    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica told Marshall she is glad he wants Bonnie to stay away. Later, she asked Walker to check in on Bonnie. Sarah told Bonnie that other girls were talking about her at school. Bonnie told Marshall that it was only a matter of time before Sarah heard the truth from someone at school, but, when he tried to tell her himself, he chickened out, and admitted he needed Bonnie's help. Rose admitted to Dusty that Paul still has feelings for her, but insisted they weren't mutual; Dusty didn't believe her, though he told her he did. Paul wanted Molly to seduce Rose, but she refused, saying she didn't want to be used. Later, after sensing that Dusty was upset about Rose, she changed her mind and told Paul she was in. Rose told Paul that their feelings were irrelevant because she plans to stay with Dusty. Lucy loved Aaron's new look, but was less than thrilled when he said he would be working at Craig's new club. He ultimately convinced her that it was a good opportunity for him.",
