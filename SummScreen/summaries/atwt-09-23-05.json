Jennifer says she'll do that only if Barbara promises to help her get her baby back after she gets out. Barbara says she'll do anything to help her, but Jennifer doesn't believe her. Will comes in and tells Jennifer that she has no idea what it's like to be confined to a mental hospital for a long period of time, but when Jennifer asks him if he thinks Barbara is right about what she should do, he says one thing he's learned is that their mother is rarely right about anything. Barbara takes Will outside the room and asks what she did to have such ungrateful children; Will says they are who she has made them to be. She agrees, saying they are stubborn and bright and talented, and she's responsible for that, but also that they have each taken a turn loathing her, and she is responsible for that, too. Will thinks Barbara is afraid of being humiliated by the fact that 2 of her children have been in mental hospitals and by the possibility that word will get out about Jenn's use of methamphetamines. He tries to tell her that maybe Jennifer needs to be in a mental health facility right now, but Barbara says if she gets Jennifer to tell the doctor that she doesn't believe her baby is still alive, she might start believing it herself. Barbara returns to Jennifer and sees her with something that belongs to Rory, which Jennifer says she took before they took him away from her. Barbara wants to take it so Dr. Michaels won't see it, but Jennifer refuses to give it up. When Dr. Michaels and Will come into the room, Jennifer tells them that no matter what they think, she knows Rory is her baby, and she'll stop at nothing to get him back when she gets out of the hospital.\n\n\nAt Java, Lea and Casey are making out when Maddie walks in, oblivious to their presence, to ask for a job application. As Maddie sits quietly filling out the application, Lea points her out to Casey and insists that Maddie has been following them. When Maddie goes to get a new pen from the cashier, Lea confronts her and tells her to stop following them; Maddie assures her the last person she is interested in is Casey Hughes. Lea then tells Casey that he needs to put a stop to this before it gets out of control, and Casey goes over to ask Maddie what she's doing there. When she tells him she's filling out a job application, he doesn't believe her, and she mouths off to him, and Casey, Lea, and Maddie get into a loud argument. The manager overhears the argument, recognizes Casey as being the boy who was fighting with Will one day at Java, and asks them to leave. Casey and Lea go to get their things to leave, and Maddie tries to introduce herself to the manager and ask for a job, but he tells her she's trouble, and there's no chance she'll get a job there. Maddie tells Casey that they've just cost her a job before she even got one, and she leaves; Casey then sees the job application she'd been filling out and realizes she was telling the truth.\n\n\nCarly and Jack are at Iris's house. Gwen arrives, and Iris calls her \"Miss Norbeck\" and acts like they barely know each other. She gets Gwen to leave and then tells Carly and Jack that she just met Gwen and is trying to help her get her baby back because she feels sorry for her. Carly tells Iris to stop plotting with Gwen to get the baby back, and Iris says she'll keep Carly's secret about her baby's death if Carly and Jack won't press charges about the blackmail. They agree, but Carly insists that Iris tell Gwen right then that she won't help her with the baby situation. Iris brings Gwen back into the house and tells her she's sorry, but she won't be able to help her anymore. Gwen leaves, and so do Jack and Carly.\n\n\nAt home, Jack and Carly discuss the fact that neither of them believed anything that Iris said at her house, and Carly frets again about Gwen and Iris trying to take Rory from them. Jack reminds her that she's not in this alone anymore, because he will do whatever it takes to keep that from happening. Carly tells him she's corrupted him, but Jack says she completes him; then he says he has to leave to \"serve and protect,\" and Carly asks if he has any other cliches, and he says, \"Yes, I love you...slo-mo\" very slowly, and together, they move in pretend slow motion towards each other to embrace. Jack leaves.\n\n\nBack at Iris's house, Gwen returns and asks Iris what all of that was about and how the Snyders even knew where Iris lived. Iris says Jack must have followed her from Java. When Gwen asks why Iris didn't tell them she was her mother, she says it's because she thinks it's always good to be one up on your enemy and because if they knew Iris was Gwen's mom, they might hold Iris's apparent lack of maternal abilities against Gwen and use it against her in her effort to get custody of Rory. Gwen says she is having trouble dealing with this selfless version of Iris, but Iris assures her she's acting selfishly, because Gwen is her daughter, and no one should mess with Gwen except Iris. Iris tells Gwen she is going to the park to try to bribe the vendor into coming clean about having drugged Gwen; Gwen wants to go along, and Iris agrees, provided that Gwen stays out of sight. They leave, and Jack, who has been hiding outside the house, follows them.\n\n\nAt the park, Gwen hides, as does Jack, and Iris confronts the water vendor, telling him she has a wad of cash for him if he'll come clean and tell the cops that he drugged Gwen, or she can just keep the cash and tell the cops about it herself; he says he doesn't know what she's talking about and that she's got no evidence against him anyway. He leaves, and Gwen comes out. Iris tells Gwen that the vendor will cooperate, but Gwen says she didn't see him take the money; Iris tells Gwen she didn't pay close enough attention and not to worry about it, that \"Carly is going down!\" They hug, as Jack watches.\n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Dusty tells Meg that he's beginning to wonder if the hospital could have made a mistake about which baby died; Meg tells him that's virtually impossible in this day and age of enhanced security, and she thinks he's just trying to believe that because he's so into Jennifer. Dusty walks away but later returns and asks Meg how she would feel if she were in Jennifer's shoes and everyone was telling her something she believed in her heart not to be true; Meg said she would want Dusty to help her prove she was right, and she suggests that Dusty go see Rory, because he delivered Jennifer's baby and felt some kind of bond with him as a result. She thinks he could recognize the baby, particularly since he had noticed things like the stork bite birthmark on Jennifer's baby. Dusty latches onto that idea and thanks Meg for her help, as Emma arrives to go with Meg to have lunch.\n\n\nMeg and Emma go to Java for lunch, where Emma asks what Dusty was thanking Meg for. She explains, and she sounds like she still believes she and Dusty have a chance together as a couple, which Emma strongly disagrees with. She tells Meg that Dusty is sure to hurt her again if she doesn't watch out.\n\n\nDusty goes to Carly and Jack's house, and Carly assumes he has come to try to talk her into designing for Street Jeans while Jennifer is indisposed. Dusty goes along with that premise, and even though Carly says there's no possible way she could do that right now with 4 kids to take care of, Dusty asks her if she has any new sketches she's been working on; when she leaves to go get her sketches, Dusty picks up Rory and looks for the birthmark.\n\n\n\n\n",

Barbara pushes Jennifer to tell Dr. Michaels that she no longer believes the Snyder baby is hers to get out of there, but Will encourages Jennifer to do what she feels is rights. Meg and Emma have lunch and Meg tries to cheer Emma up regarding Luke. Iris pretends that she doesn't know Gwen in front of Jack and Carly, but later privately assures her daughter she will still help her.\r\nSource: tv.com",
