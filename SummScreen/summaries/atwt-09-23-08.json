Aaron had to work, but Alison accepted. Alison noticed Chris ordering a take-out lunch from Aaron and decided to abandon her salad. She approached Chris just as Aaron delivered his order, so Alison put on a show of affection for her new husband in front of Chris. \n\n\nJack called on Carly to tell her he was going out of town for a few days to work on a private case. Carly demanded to know if the case was dangerous, so Jack swore her to secrecy and disclosed that James Stenbeck was on the loose and had kidnapped Meg. Jack particularly did not want the rest of the family to know about Meg until he had some better news for them. Carly agreed to silence, but she refused Jack's second request that she talk to Janet and explain that Jack would be out of touch for a while. Carly told Jack he was a \"piece of work\" for not being brave enough to speak to Janet himself. Jack was fearful that Janet could not keep the secret, so Carly reluctantly agreed to help him. Carly went to the farm to tell Janet, who did not receive the news well. \n\n\nMike arrived at the farm to tell Emma that he had begun cleaning up the construction site, but she gave him the news that she was shutting down the project entirely. She regretted selling the land in the first place since it had brought the family so close to tragedy when Ethan fell into the crater. At Lily's house, Lily and Holden enjoyed pillow talk after their lovemaking until a call from Emma summoned them to the farm to help make decisions on the land. They drove to the farm and ran right into Carly, who was leaving after delivering Jack's message to Janet. Holden followed Carly outside to talk and told her that he and Lily were giving their marriage another try. He thanked her for helping him through one of the toughest times of his life, and Carly wished him well. \n\n\nEmma told Lily and Mike that she could no longer give up the Snyder land, and her emotions overtook her and she went outside. Lily asked Mike what he would do next since the project at the farm was dead. Mike said he would have to move on unless Lily gave him a reason to stay. Lily told Mike that could not be and explained that she and Holden were trying to resurrect their relationship. She and Mike hugged, and Mike left. \n\n\nAt the police station, Bonnie told Paul that she had been one of Derek Coburn's victims so her representing him in court would be a conflict of interest. Paul pled with her to take the only road that might lead them to his wife. Bonnie relented and told Derek that she would represent him, after all, but the loan shark had changed his mind. He no longer wanted her on his case. They discussed his options, and once again Derek reversed his decision and hired Bonnie. He stated his terms: full immunity for his crimes in return for everything he knew about James Stenbeck and his plans. Barbara arrived at the station to see if Paul had learned anything about Meg, and she told her son that she thought James was still testing Paul and had no intention of bringing Meg back. \n\n\nJanet found Jack still at the police station, and she told him he owed her a personal notification if he were leaving town for a while. They went for coffee, and Jack apologized for sending Carly as a messenger. Janet pointed out to Jack that Carly continued to be his own personal comfort zone. Jack asked for space in order to work through all the recent changes in his life. Janet referred to herself as an \"all or nothin' kind of girl,\" and she was afraid that part of Jack would always belong to Carly. \n\n\nCasey told Emily that she had run Alison off by being so vocal about the negative aspects of marriage and her cautions to her sister about not getting pregnant too soon. They retreated to Emily's office and began to make love, but Emily called a halt because Casey was not using a condom. He finally produced one, but he was disappointed that Emily was so down on marriage and babies. \n\n\nAlison followed Chris to Memorial Hospital and accused him of stalking her in the Lakeview. Chris reminded her that Oakdale was not that large a town and they would be running into one another on occasion. He also brought up the fact that the two of them had made love the night before her wedding to Aaron, and she almost gave in to him again. She dashed out, but Chris followed her and asked why it was so difficult for her to say goodbye to him. \n\n\nBack at the Oakdale Police Department, Bonnie told Dallas what Derek's demands were, and Dallas explained he was not authorized to cut a deal-and a plea bargain was not in the works, either. Bonnie suggested that her client lead the police to Meg Snyder and perhaps then they would cut him a deal. Surprisingly, Coburn agreed to tell them all he knew. Jack and Paul joined them in the interrogation room as they learned some facts. Stenbeck kept a safe house somewhere on a beach on the east coast, and he had captured Meg in order to take her baby. He needed an heir, and Meg was providing one. \n\n\nLucinda and her friend Brian, along with Luke, arrived at the farm, and Luke immediately noticed how different his parents were with one another. He was delighted that they were making another attempt at being a family. Emma asked Lucinda for some business advice. What did Lucinda think about donating the Snyder land to the town for use as a children's playground? First, however, Emma had to buy the land back, and she was stumped for a way of getting that much money. Brian suggested a fundraiser and offered some helpful ideas. \n\n\nLily and Holden took the children home, and Faith questioned them about their reconciliation. Lily could only promise that she and Holden were going to try their best to make things work this time. Holden then asked Lily about Mike's plans, and, in turn, Lily wanted to know where Holden stood with Carly. The two promised to work on their marriage as a top priority. \n\n\nJanet approached Carly and told her that she realized she had never really had a chance with Jack. She referred to an \"invisible rubber band\" that bound Jack and Carly together, and then walked out. \n\n\nSomewhere on a sandy beach, James Stenbeck led Meg to her new seaside home.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Holden and Lily say tell Mike and Carly that they have decided to give their marriage another try and Carly is happy for them. Mike is sad and tries to hold back tears when Lily tells him the news but he wishes Lily the best of luck with her marriage. Emma decides to shut down the development project because she blames herself for Ethan's accident. Mike tells Lily since the project is shut down he will probably leave Oakdale. Janet gets angry at Jack because he didn't tell her himself that he was going out of town on a private case instead he sent Carly to tell her the news. The incident makes Janet realize that Carly will always come first with Jack so she tells him that he should stop lying to himself and get back together with Carly. Janet also tells Carly not to lose Jack and try to have a relationship with him again. Emma decides to donate the land to the city and make it a wildlife preserve or a park for children. Lucinda's friend Brian suggests that they have a benefit to raise money for the project. Derek tells Jack and Paul that James has a beach house somewhere on the east coast and that is probably where he took Meg. Paul thinks Jack's way of finding Meg is too slow so he goes out to search for Meg on his own. James does indeed take Meg to a very secluded beach house and says that it will be her new home.",
