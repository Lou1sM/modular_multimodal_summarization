    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLily tried to convince her mother that it was possible that Holden could still be alive and a victim of a kidnapping, but Lucinda reminded her daughter how severe the crash and resulting fire had been.  Lucinda wanted proof that Holden was alive, something like a photo, or his voice on tape, or a phone conversation.  She hated seeing Lily's hopes built up without any proof.\n\n\nAt the crash site, Eb held Damian, Luke, and Jack at gunpoint.  Jack began a dialogue with Eb, and he said that he was Holden's cousin.  Eb asked who the other two were, but he was only concerned with which of them had his money.  Jack wanted proof that Eb really had Holden, and he also asked Eb to put down the gun. Eb protested that he wasn't as dumb as he looked, but Jack held out for a positive sign that Holden was a captive. Damian, who identified himself as \"a friend of the family,\" attempted to make a deal with Eb for money, but Jack kept hammering on proof.\n\n\nDamian finally jumped Eb, and in their struggle, Damian pushed Eb over the cliff, but not before Eb squeezed the trigger.  Damian fell to the ground as a bullet passed through his left shoulder.  Luke ran to comfort his father, and Jack called 9-1-1 and then looked into the ravine.  There was no sign there of either Eb or the missing Officer Grady.  Jack walked back and asked Damian why he was there, and Damian began one of his involved lies.\n\n\nDamian said that Grady had called him and said that there was talk around the police department that there were \"mysterious circumstances\" surrounding Holden's accident and death.  He continued by saying that the police had evidence that Holden was driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs, and he also had \"someone\" in the truck with him who was not supposed to be there.  Damian hinted that the \"someone\" was a woman.  Damian further embellished his lie by saying that Grady had managed to hold off the media so far, but Damian had flown to Kentucky to \"set the patrolman straight.\"\n\n\nJack answered his phone, and the caller was Lily, so Jack had to tell her that the \"kidnapper\" had shown up but had no proof that he had Holden.  Jack was sorry, but the whole thing smelled like a hoax.  He hung up when the EMTs arrived, along with a state trooper.  Jack described Eb for the trooper, and they both expressed concern about the missing Grady.\n\n\nAfter Lily spoke with Jack and got the bad news that it was unlikely that Holden was alive, she told Lucinda that she felt that Holden was trying to reach out to her and say that he wasn't dead.  Lucinda advised her daughter to give herself time to accept her husband's loss before she \"started anything new.\"  Lily got angry that Lucinda was referring to Damian, and she announced that she would not have another conversation on that topic.  Lucinda gave up and went to her offices at Worldwide.\n\n\nMeg used the key that Damian had given her to gain access to his hotel room in the Lakeview.  Hidden in a drawer beneath some shirts, Meg found the note that Holden had written for Maeve to give to his bank manager, along with another sample of Holden's handwriting.  Meg continued to look for the writing analyst's report, but she could not find one.  First she wondered if Damian could have already given it to Lily, but on second thought, she realized that Damian most likely had never had it analyzed at all.  Meg wondered what Damian was hiding.\n\n\nMeg took the papers to Lucinda's office, where she learned that the ransom call had been a scam.  She showed Lucinda the papers from Damian's room and said that she was concerned that Damian had never followed through by having the writing analyzed.  Lucinda reminded Meg that she, of all people, should know that Damian's first impulse was to lie.  She also urged Meg to take the papers to Jack, but Meg was fearful that her cousin would arrest her.  Lucinda, who was not afraid of anything, said she would deliver them herself.\n\n\nJack reported back to Damian and Luke, and he heard Luke thanking his father for saving his life.  The boy went on to say that while he was not happy about Damian and his mother, Luke knew that Damian had Lily's \"best interests at heart.\"  Damian suddenly got woozy and passed out, so the EMTs rushed back to check him again.  Damian stabilized, but he refused to go to a nearby clinic.  He said he had to get home, and he offered Jack and Luke a ride back in his plane. As they were leaving, the trooper returned with the report that there had been no sign of Grady.\n\n\nIn the cabin in the woods, Holden worried that Eb had been gone for a very long time, and he was also concerned about the fate of Officer Grady.  Maeve was frightened that Eb had gotten the money and had taken off, leaving her and Holden to die.  Holden was sure that someone would drop by, but Maeve said that they never had guests.  Holden asked why Maeve had allowed Eb to cut her off from the world, and her answer was that she had loved him.  Holden said that she needed to get away from there, but Maeve was discouraged.\n\n\nHolden told Maeve that he had grown up on a farm around horses, and he had met Lily when they were both teens and he was a stable boy and she was a princess.  He said they had each betrayed the other along the way, but he and Lily had never stopped believing that they belonged together.  Maeve said that she had met Eb when he was young and handsome, and full of hope that some day they could be rich.  Then Eb had met Skaggs, and things went sour.  After the bank job, Eb turned mean and violent.  Maeve said she had almost believed in Holden's \"pretty stories,\" but that life was not for her.\n\n\nHolden heard the desperation in Maeve's voice, and he determined to get out of there right away.  He slid off the cot and suggested that he tip over Maeve's chair, and then they could slip one of the handcuffs off the chair.  She agreed, and they struggled to get the chair to tip.  Finally it went over, but Maeve hit her head hard on the floor and passed out.  She was out for a while, but she eventually awoke and began working on her leg ropes.   Holden also got one of Maeve's arms freed and then was able to slide the other off the chair leg.\n\n\nMaeve went to look for a tool to break Holden's leg chains, and she returned with an axe.  Holden was able to free his legs, and he also was successful in removing Maeve's last cuff.  They stood up, and Maeve gave Holden a big kiss, just as Eb walked in the cabin.  Eb jumped Holden, who grabbed the axe, but Eb punched Holden in the face and knocked him back onto the cot.  Eb brandished the axe over Holden, but Maeve held his arm and would not let him strike.  She tried to pacify her husband, but he threw her on the cot with Holden.  Eb made Maeve tie Holden's hands behind his back and then marched them both out of the cabin.\n\n\nBack in Oakdale, a doctor admitted Damian to Memorial Hospital for overnight observation.  The doctor said that after some physical therapy and rest, Damian would make a full recovery.  Luke stood by his father and promised to return later after he ran some errands.  Noah was out of town, so he had some chores to do.\n\n\nJack went immediately to Lily's when he returned to Oakdale and expressed his sincere regret that the kidnapping had been a hoax.  He also brought up some anomalies in Damian's story about his conversation with Officer Grady, but he did not go into detail.  He promised to follow up with Damian later.  Jack explained how Eb had shot Damian, and Lily wanted to go to the hospital immediately.  Jack said he would meet her there, after he had checked in at the police station.  He repeated that he had more questions for Damian.\n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Station, Jack was at his desk when Lucinda arrived.  She handed over Holden's handwriting samples, and Jack at once asked where she had gotten them.  Lucinda refused to name her source, but she generously shared her theory that Damian had tried to keep the truth from Lily so that she would think that Holden was dead.  Jack thought a bit and then figured out a way to make the samples admissible in court, if that became necessary.\n\n\nLily visited Damian in the hospital and expressed her gratitude for his saving Luke.  Damian spun his story for Lily, but she said that the two of them needed to be straight with each other about everything.  Jack walked in and said he had a few questions for Damian.  Lily was opposed, but Damian said it was fine with him.  Jack asked if Damian had sent Holden's handwriting samples to his expert, and Damian assured him that he had.  Then Damian volunteered that the samples were \"not a match,\" and that was news to Lily.  When Jack asked for the written report, Damian said that he had gotten the report over the phone, and the report had not yet arrived.\n\n\nDamian also said that the expert still had the writing samples and would return them with the report.  Lily got upset with the questioning, so she asked Jack to leave.  She told Damian that she was horrified at how close she had been to losing him, too, and Damian kissed her hand.\n\n\nJack left the hospital and went to see Lucinda.  He told her of Damian's lies, and then he received a phone call from a trooper in Kentucky.  The cop said that they had found no trace of Officer Grady.\n\n\nAt the farm, Luke spoke with Meg.  He was upset that she and Lily had shared bad feelings about Damian.  Meg was bitter, and Luke asked her to please back off and let Damian comfort his mother.  He explained how Damian had saved his life in Kentucky, but Meg said that Lily was not the only one whom Damian was playing for a fool.  Luke resented that, and the two got into a full-blown argument.  Meg said that Luke would eventually thank her as soon as he heard the truth she had learned that afternoon, but she refused to say more.\n\n\n",
