Grabbing her head in pain, she says she is dying. A small group on bystanders has gathered around her as a police officer approaches. The man told him what happened and the officer said he would take it from there. He instantly recognizes Carly, but she doesn't know who he is. The officer mentions Jack- a name the Carly recognizes. She begins to cry, telling him to please call Jack. Confused, he tells her that Jack is getting married today \"Don't you remember?\" he says to her. Carly seems to remember, saying \"how could I forget that?\" The officer wants to call an ambulance, but she refuses. She tells him that she hasn't eaten yet, and this must be why she fainted.  He refuses to leave her there alone and takes her back to the station. Once there, Carly wants to leave, but Dallas won't let her drive. He offers to call Gwen or Rosanna, but she refuses. He tells her that she can't leave in this condition unless someone comes to pick her up. \n\n\nAt the wedding, Henry walks Katie down the aisle to give her to the groom. Beaming, Jack tells Katie he loves her, and tries to kiss her but is stopped by the minister. \"Not yet!\" he said. Everyone laughs. Brad worriedly looks at his cell phone. Because of car trouble, Tom arrives with Bob and Kim just in time as the minister gets started. As he speaks, Bob and Kim exchange loving looks, Holden smiles touching his wedding band and Parker, JJ and Sage happily look on. A watchful Henry tells Vienna he is keeping an eye out for Carly. Kim notices that Brad seems distracted. The minister asks if anyone objects to the marriage, Henry whispers to Vienna \"why would they leave that part in?\" Just then Brad's phone rings. He leaves to answer it as everyone is disgusted including Margo who mutters \"I knew I should have kept that phone!\" It is Carly; she asks if it is a bad time and he says no. She needs him to pick her up, without hesitation he says that he will be right there. Brad returns to the waiting wedding and explains that he has to go- but will be right back. Jack wants to keep going without him, but Katie insists that Brad be there, so Jack announces to the guests that there will be a little wait. \n\n\nIn Emma's kitchen Katie is worried. Margo asks her if she thinks that Brad and Carly are up to something. Katie told her that Brad wouldn't do that. She then spills some of the water she is drinking on her gown.\n\n\nOutside, Jack complains about Brad, and tells Holden that he better not let him down.\n\n\nParker takes off his tie saying he will put it back on if the wedding ever gets started. He and JJ bicker. Faith tells them how great they both look. JJ thanks her and returns the compliment drawing an evil look from Parker.\n\n\nBob remarks that it looks like rain; Tom points out that rain on your wedding day is supposed to be good luck. Not for an outdoor wedding, said Bob. Tom stated that he felt it was a bad sign when his car broke down on the way. Kim lamented that she wanted this day to be perfect for Katie. Bob said that as long as they get married, it will be.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna decide to entertain the guests while they wait; Henry suggests that they each take turns sharing secrets that they know about Jack and Katie.\n\n\nHenry gives a little speech about what a wonderful friend Katie is. Jack asks Kim if she thinks that Brad's phone call involved his job somehow. Kim said no, and suggested that Jack call him. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Station, Brad arrives and wants to know what happened. Carly told him that she blacked out again and didn't want to go to the hospital because she already knows what's wrong with her. Brad points out that the doctors could possibly give her more quality time. Brad's phone rings; it's Jack. Carly tells him to go to the wedding because Jack needs him. Brad answers the phone and tells him that he is on his way. An impatient Jack tells him to hurry up. Carly, realizing that the wedding is soon starting, again tells Brad to go, but he tells her that nothing is as important as taking care of her. Carly worries that the wait at the ER would be too long. He lies and tells her that Katie is having issues with her hair and it would be another 2 hours, so they have plenty of time. Brad assures her that her neurologist will see her right away, and they leave. \n\n\nBack at the farm, Margo is still trying to dry the water spot on Katie's dress. Katie doubts it will come out and sarcastically states the maybe she should have invited Carly- she would know what to do! Margo got the stain out and Jack told her that they wouldn't wait for Brad- they were going to get married now!\n\n\nJack and Katie resume their wedding. The minister picks up at the part where he was interrupted; does anyone have just cause to object to this couple joining together? Parker stands and says \"nobody objects- let's do this.\" \n\n\nJack tells Katie that he was a lonely heart looking for someone who understood him, and then he saw her with his children and fell in love with her. He told her that they were not joining together as one; but as a family and he can't wait to build their family and future together.\n\n\nKatie tells Jack how she was always searching for something, never sure what it was until she met him; he was what she was looking for. She told the children that she was not just making vows to their father today, but was making a promise to them as well. She knows they have a mother who loves them very much and she could never replace her and would never try- but she is here for them and will love and respect them always. She thanked them for sharing their father with her. \n\n\nJack and Katie each take their vows and are pronounced husband and wife. Jack happily kisses his wife as everyone blows bubbles around them.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Carly's doctor said he is concerned that the lesion is growing faster than he thought. He wants to admit her overnight for tests and observation. He leaves to get the paperwork. Carly tells Brad she doesn't know if she can do this. She says that dying is bad enough, but to know that Jack is marrying a woman she doesn't like who will now be a mother to her children is unbearable. Brad reminds her that her kids have one mother; her. She worries she will never leave the hospital. Brad tells her to get treatment and fight because no one can be a better mother to her children than her. Carly agrees to the tests, and Brad stays as they give her a hospital gown to put on. The nurse puts her wrist band on and Brad holds her hand as they draw her blood. \n\n\nAt the wedding, everyone is enjoying the reception:\n\n\nConcerned by his worried look, Faith asks Parker if he is ok. He tells her that he is worried about his mom. \n\n\nWhile dancing, Vienna asks Henry if he is ready to give marriage another chance. \n\n\nJack and Katie are happily interrupted by Sage, who wants a dance with her dad.\n\n\nMargo toasts the newlyweds!\n\n\nJack and Katie cut the cake and feed each other.\n\n\nHolden tells Jack and Katie that Brad doesn't know what he's missing. \"Eat your heart out Brad!\" says Jack as he kisses his bride. \n\n\nA worried Parker tries to call his mother, but is unable to reach her. \n\n\nAt the hospital the Dr. has some results of Carly's tests. He tells her that the disorientation was caused by a seizure and that she is likely to have more. Brad asks what can be done. He tells her she can go on palliative treatment- which doesn't change the outcome, but will give Carly some better quality of life. Carly worries that the treatment will make her sick. He tells her she can stop the treatments anytime she wants, but if she is going to start she needs to start soon; her disease is progressing quickly. He urges her to stay the night. She says no, because she has to watch the kids while Jack is away on his honeymoon. She vows that she will not ruin his happiness; not this time. Brad tells her that Jack would never forgive her for not telling him. She asks the doctor if the treatment will give her more time, or make the time that she has more comfortable. He tells her that he can't make promises, but highly recommends it. Carly stated that this is now out of her hands. She tells Brad to go to the wedding, she wants to rest. He finally agrees. He kisses her on the cheek and goes. Alone in the hospital room, the words of the doctor and the ticking of the clock go through Carly's mind.\n\n\nAt the wedding Jack announces that he and his new bride have to leave to prepare for their early departure to the honeymoon, but Sage reminds Katie that she didn't throw her bouquet yet. All the unmarried ladies got ready, and Katie threw the bouquet- right into the hands of the just arriving Brad! \n\n\n",
