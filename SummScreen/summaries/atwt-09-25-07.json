He tells her that his lawyer has managed to free up some of his assets. Meg wants to make sure it is being done legally, and Craig assures her it is. She wonders if Rosanna is going to end this attack on him, but Craig reminds her that Paul is really the one behind it. Craig tells her how much he missed her, and wants to take her out to dinner tonight. He wants one perfect evening with her. \n\n\nAt Fairwinds Paul and Rosanna share the couch after making love. Much to Rosanna's dismay, Paul brings up the issue of Craig. She tells him that she wants to focus on them- not Craig. He says he wants that too, but all he can think of is how Craig took her away from him and he must suffer for it. He tells her she knows what to do to make that happen and the had made an agreement. He picks up the phone and hands it to her. She reluctantly takes it and calls the police saying she wants to report a crime. \n\n\nLater, Rosanna worries that going after Craig might be a mistake- that it might open old wounds. Paul is unfazed- pointing out that while she was in a coma Craig lived in her house and spent her money AND he married Meg, Rosanna adds but Paul said she has nothing to do with this. Rosanna worries that they will lose \"us\" in the pursuit of Craig. Paul said that was not going to happen. They are doing this for Jennifer and for Johnny. Rosanna agrees and Paul toasts to Craig Montgomery finally getting what's coming to him. But Rosanna toasts to them; to their happiness and may they never forget the price they paid to get it. \n\n\nCraig and Meg are waiting for a table at the Lakeview when Dallas approaches them and tells Craig he has a warrant for his arrest. Paul and Rosanna walk in and Meg is outraged. She asks them why they just can't leave them alone. She tells them that Craig is not responsible for Rosanna's accident, but Rosanna tells her that he is a liar. She tells Meg that Craig no doubt tells her that she is the only one that truly believes in him. Meg is taken aback by this. Rosanna tells her that Craig's lies aren't enough to save him now. Craig tells Meg to not worry because he can't be charged for the same crime twice. Dallas then tells him that the arrest has nothing to do with the accident. Paul tells Meg that Craig is being charged with kidnapping and fraud for switching Jennifer's baby with Gwen's baby- and Rosanna can prove it. Meg tells Paul that he is doing this because they couldn't get Craig for Rosanna's accident. Craig assures Meg that everything will be fine. Dallas takes Craig away in handcuffs and Paul reminds him to read Craig his rights. \n\n\nIn the interrogation room of Oakdale P.D. Craig tells Meg not to worry- his lawyer is on the way. She tells him that she is bothered by the fact that he didn't seem surprised; that he knew all along that this could happen. He admits to this, but tells her there is no evidence that he did it- the hospital could have made a mistake. Meg demands to know if Rosanna knew. He asks why it matters- Meg tells him that it matters because if Rosanna had figured out he had switched the babies, maybe he did run her off the road that night on purpose to cover it up. He tells her that she can believe him or Paul and Rosanna. Dallas tells Meg that she has to leave. Craig tells her that he will be home soon and then they can figure everything out. Meg says nothing and leaves. \n\n\nBack at Fairwinds Rosanna goes upstairs to bed, leaving Paul downstairs. Meg shows up and wants to talk to Rosanna about the accident. They argue about Craig. As the argument escalates, Paul grabs Meg's arm, she tries to get away but he pulls her closer, demanding to know why she is still with Craig and does she let him touch her the way he used to. Rosanna walks in and they separate. Just then Craig arrives, but they don't see him. Paul tells her that Meg was just leaving. Meg apologizes to Rosanna for disturbing her. Paul tells Rosanna that Meg is in denial about marring a would-be murderer. Craig then interrupts and a shocked Rosanna wants to know why he is not in jail. Craig says he made bail and he is there to collect his wife and they leave. \n\n\nAt the wedding, Katie gets ready to throw the bouquet to the waiting single ladies. She counts to three and throws it right into Brad's hands! Vienna says that she was supposed to catch it- and grabs it from him, but he takes it back and passes it back to Katie for a do-over. Vienna and Katie are both outraged, as well as Jack who tells him that he treated their wedding like a joke. In the kitchen with Brad, Jack is furious. He asks Brad how he could take a phone call during his wedding; he needed him there, to stand up for him. He accused Brad of doing this because he couldn't have Katie. Brad told him to please listen to him, but Jack refused telling him he had to go on his honeymoon and turns to leave. Brad tells him that he was with Carly- the she is sick. Jack doesn't believe him, saying that Brad will use any excuse. Brad tells him that he wouldn't lie about something like this. He told Jack that she called him because she had no one else to turn to and she made him promise not to tell. Jack still doesn't believe him, but Brad tells him that she had collapsed in Old Town and he took her to the hospital. He told him that the first time she collapsed it was real- she was having really bad headaches and blackouts; like the one that caused the accident with Sage. Jack, now realizing that Brad is telling the truth admits that Carly was vague about what had happened. Katie comes in, sees the look on Jack's face and accuses Brad of upsetting him, but Jack tells her he did nothing wrong. He tells Katie that they may have to change their flight; Carly is sick and he needs to know what is going on before he leaves the kids with her. Katie is concerned and agrees. Jack leaves for the hospital. \n\n\nHolden brings Parker, JJ and Sage back into the house and he and Faith leave to go home. Sage and JJ go upstairs. Parker notices Jack's luggage on the floor and asks Brad why it was there. Brad told him that Jack and Katie missed their flight but were still going, just later. Parker says he knows Brad is lying- he thinks it has something to do with his mom. Brad changes the subject and tells Parker that Carly is tough and will be ok. Parker, satisfied for the moment tells Brad he hopes so. \n\n\nAt the hospital Carly tells Dr. Evers that she doesn't want to have anymore tests since it won't change the fact that she is dying. He tells her that she is leaving against medical advice and that they can make her more comfortable. She tells him that she understands, but if nothing can save her life- was there really any point? \n\n\nJack arrives at Carly's hospital room. She is surprised to see him. Dr. Evers tells him that he hopes he can get through to her. He then leaves to answer a page. Jack tells her that he knows she is refusing treatment wants to know why. She tells him that there is no point to the treatments because she is dying. He refuses to believe this. She tells him that there is no cure- she has a tumor in her brain and they can't operate because where it is. She tells him that she only has a couple of months left. Jack cannot believe it. \"I'm not going to let you die Carly.\" She tells him that she doesn't know how to tell the kids. She starts crying and Jack assures her that they will tell them together. She laments about leaving them- she will never be able to make it up to them now and knows that the time she was away was gone- and she can't get it back. Sobbing, she says that she wants more time to watch them grow. \n\n\nKatie arrives at the hospital with Henry; she goes to the room and sees Jack holding the sobbing Carly. Katie doesn't go in. Katie tells Henry that Jack needs to be with Carly now and that they should go, so they leave. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry wants to stay with Katie, but she wants to be alone if she can't be with Jack. She opens the gift that Jack gave her before the wedding. It is a sports jersey with K Snyder on it. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Jack tells Carly that they will find another doctor- that she must fight. Carly then sees the band on his finger and realizes that he and Katie got married. \"You did it- you and Katie, you're married!\" Her face was full of joy. She tells him \"Go! Get out of here- now!\" But Jack tells her he isn't leaving just because he is married now. He tells her that she can't refuse the treatments. She tells him she will hold off just while he is on his honeymoon, but Jack tells her that he is not going anywhere- he is not letting her go through this alone. Carly tells him he is not her husband; he is Katie's and that this is his wedding night- a hospital is the last place he should be. Crying now, Jack begs her to fight for their children. \n\n\nJack arrives at the Lakeview waking Katie. He tells her that they have to postpone the honeymoon because Carly is dying. A shocked Katie tells him that she understands. \n\n\nJack joins Katie in bed and they hold each other. He tells her he is exhausted and they can talk in the morning. She says ok. He thanks her for being understanding. He rolls over and says goodnight. They lie on separate sides of the bed not sleeping. \n\n\nCarly tells Dr. Evers that she will stay and agrees to the tests and treatments. He tells her they will start in the morning. \n\n\nAlone in her hospital room, Carly lies not sleeping.\n\n\n",
