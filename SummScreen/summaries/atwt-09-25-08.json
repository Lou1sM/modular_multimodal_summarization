Holden followed her out and told her that the two of them had to act naturally when they had chance encounters, and pretend that things were the way they used to be. Carly protested that things never would be the same. They continued their discussion while Lily waited and finally paid their bill. When Holden returned, he tried to explain his position, but his wife was not receptive. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Station, Dallas told Jack that Swan Island off the coast of Maine was a nature preserve and was uninhabited. The local police knew of no houses on it, so that was a dead end. Paul burst in, hoping to hear that the police knew where Meg was, and when he found out the cottage description had gone nowhere, he went out of control. He shouted at Dallas and Jack that the department should drop all other cases and concentrate on finding his wife. Jack accompanied Paul back to Fairwinds, but Jack said the crime lab could find no evidence that James Stenbeck had been there recently. Jack also recommended that Paul take a couple of the pills Barbara had brought to calm him down. Paul agreed, and took the pills, hoping to get some rest. He took out some photos of Meg and began talking to them when James walked in. \n\n\nMeg was stunned to see Dusty in a cage in the room she had discovered in the island house. Dusty was asleep, so Meg awakened him, and he recognized her. Meg told him that James had brought them to an island, and it was news to Dusty. He had no idea that James was his captor. Dusty explained how he had faked his death with the help of some nameless people whom he was still protecting. He hoped to find Jennifer's son, Johnny, and had tracked Lucy Montgomery and the boy to Bangkok when someone jumped him in an alley, and he woke up in the cage. The two of them tried to figure out why James had brought them both there. Dusty thought he was still in Thailand and was shocked to learn they were back in the US, or so Meg believed. They realized that James had gone to a great deal of trouble to keep Dusty in the dark. Meg turned on a light switch in the room and was stunned to get a good look at Dusty. He was weak and listless, probably due to lack of exercise and drugs in his food. \n\n\nLily and Holden took the kids home and then allowed the girls to take Ethan to the park to swing. Lily felt it was important that Faith knew they still trusted her to look out for her brother because she was still harboring guilt about Ethan's near-tragedy. Holden intimated that the empty house was an opportunity for them to make love, but Lily was reluctant. She told Holden that sex had to be about her and not because of guilt over his affair with Carly. Holden tried to convince her that he had put Carly behind him, but they began to argue. Faith came back to ask a question and was aware of her parents' mood. \n\n\nCarly called Jack to ask if her sketch had produced any results towards finding Meg. Jack told her unfortunately no one had recognized the cottage. Carly began making lunch alone but then dumped it into the garbage. \n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Paul grabbed James and threatened him, but his father professed no knowledge of Meg's whereabouts. Stenbeck suggested Meg might have left of her own volition, perhaps to meet someone more appealing than her husband. Paul refused to take the bait, however, and threatened to call the police. James called his bluff, and as Paul was dialing the number, James disappeared. \n\n\nDusty asked Meg why James had captured her, and she explained that he wanted to get back at Paul. That did not make sense to Dusty until Meg told him she had married Paul recently. Dusty was shocked, and Meg tried to convince him that her husband was a changed man. The two argued, but Meg suggested they concentrate on trying to free Dusty from the cage. \n\n\nLily showed up unexpectedly at Carly's house and thanked her for her help during the crisis with Ethan. She also told her former friend that her help did not make up for the fact that she had slept with Lily's husband. Lily took some blame on herself because of her affair with Dusty, but she cautioned Carly that she would never forgive Carly for coming between her and Holden. \n\n\nHolden had taken the kids for ice cream and came home to find Lily gone. Faith questioned her father about his argument with Lily, and Holden reassured her that he and Lily were working on their marriage. When Lily returned, she told Holden she had visited Carly, and that upset Holden. They talked about how Holden had felt when he discovered the souvenirs of Dusty that Lily had saved and how hurt he had been. Lily asked him if Carly could ever be as dead to him as Dusty was to her. Holden agreed that she was not asking for more than he had required of her with Dusty. \n\n\nJack arrived at Carly's and she filled him in on what had transpired with Lily. She asked why Holden got a free pass for their affair while she had to wear a scarlet letter. She felt she had lost something valuable: Lily's friendship-along with a chance for a new life. \n\n\nMeg tried to open Dusty's cage but she had no luck. He urged her to keep trying, but they heard someone coming, so Meg doused the lights and ran back to her room. James returned with food and supplies, and Meg asked if he had gotten her soy milk and cocoa butter. She declared she was lactose intolerant and could only drink that kind of milk, and if James had not gotten it, he had to go back. James believed her until she asked for ice cream, as well, and then he confronted her with being lactose intolerant. She covered that well by telling him he had to find the special ice cream for that condition. He appeared convinced and left again. Meg dashed back to Dusty's cage and this time her pounding on the lock broke it. Dusty was almost too weak to move, but Meg helped him. \n\n\nPaul lay on the couch for a rest and began thrashing in a half-sleep. He found one of Meg's scarves under the cushions and then slipped into another vision. In this one, he saw Meg and Dusty standing together on a shoreline.\n\n\n",
