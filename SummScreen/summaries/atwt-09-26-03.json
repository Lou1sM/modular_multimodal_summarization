This time it's Katie mourning Simon.  Mike suggests she bring ice cream sundaes over to Chris and Katie to help lighten their mood.  Alison coerces Mike to tag along.\n\n\nKatie, in a dream, sees Mike held captive in the warehouse sitting on the same bomb.  She also hears Simon's voice calling out to her.  She starts to look for Simon until Mike pleads with her to untie him before the bomb explodes.  The timer counts down from fifteen seconds.  Katie actually thinks about it before she leaves Mike to look for Simon.  As the imagined bomb explodes, Katie screams Mike's name.  Chris arrives and wakes her up assuring her it was all just a bad nightmare.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Jen tells her mother she's not concerned if Rose hates Paul right now.  She thinks Paul's charm will soon win Rose back, leaving Dusty available for Jen.  Barbara scoffs and tries to warn her daughter about Dusty's character...again.  She also has a sudden lapse in memory, \"When have I tried to control you Jen?\"  Jen can't believe her ears, but reminds her mother how cool they were before she left town in the first place.  Babs, to her credit, reveals some of her rationale.  She says she \"let her\" go to Europe instead of college, when other mothers might have forced their daughters to stay at home or pursue education.  Babs says she sent Jen letters and left messages to her in Europe none of which Jen returned.  Barbara respected her privacy and her need to be alone, even when her mother needed her the most, when she was on trial and when Will was in a coma.  Barbara admits some guilt, and actually asks for her daughter's forgiveness.  Jen pieces a theory together in her head and accuses her mother of wanting her to stay away from Dusty so she can have him all to herself.  Babs' jaw drops in shock.  She denies the accusation and tugs harder at Jen's heartstrings.  Barbara reveals some of her depression about being alone after losing Hal, and after being taken by Craig.  She hates waking up to an empty bed, but won't resort to filling the void with Dusty.  Sensing she has an edge after Jen has apologized for her attack, Babs gently surfs the edge of manipulation, \"Dusty is poison.  Be cautious.  I don't want you hurt.\"  After her mother walks away, Jen looks within herself to take another look at her plans with Dusty.\n\n\nPaul leads Rose to where the surveillance van should have been, but it's missing.  He has a slip of the tongue and wonders where \"they\" went.  Rose starts to catch on that Paul may be planning this whole charade.  He tries to cover his tracks, but Rose says, \"something stinks.  If any of this keeps Dusty from opening the club, you're going to wish you stayed buried in the Atlantic Ocean.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the van, Molly and Dusty take advantage of their alone time and begin to rekindle old fires.  The van stops somewhere, the side door opens, and someone yells, \"Freeze!\"  Dusty and Molly are caught.  Later, an officer brings the two turtledoves back to the OPD for booking.  Dusty wants a lawyer, and Molly can't stop giggling.  She sees an opportunity to plant more seeds of suspicion into Dusty's head.  \"Paul is never gonna give up, and Rose, is never gonna make up her mind.\"  She says she thinks he enjoyed rolling around in the van.  Dusty accuses her of being in on the plan with Paul.  Molly recoils, denying the accusation.  Seeing her reaction, Dusty thinks he may have been off the mark.  Margo arrives to take a statement.  Later, Dusty makes an almost gracious apology, and Molly apologizes for taking advantage of the situation.  Dusty mumbles that he knew what he was doing.  Molly giggles, \"You always did.\"  He thinks about how crazy Rose is making him feel.  Molly suggests that the only cure for crazy love is unabashed lust.  \"You've got my number.\"  Margo returns and they head over to the bar to check out the bugs.\n\n\nRose and Paul return to the old Java, where she tries to get in touch with Dusty.  Paul says he wanted to show Rose a different side of Dusty, but she says, \"Instead you showed me the apple doesn't fall far from the tree!\"  She suspects Paul is reeling her in for the old \u2018hook \u2018n dump.'  She thinks Paul is trying to get her back so he can dump her after she can't get Dusty back.  Paul explains he fell in love with Rose because she is a fighter and because she is good, \"and that's a great combination.\"  Paul professes his love for Rose again.  Rose doesn't buy it.  Paul tells her he's changed.  He's now a fighter and now he's going to fight for her.  Rose still isn't swayed.  He says everything changed when they kissed last week.  He takes her hand and says, \"I want you back Rose. Will you give me another chance?\"  Just then, Dusty kicks in his front door and walks down his stairs.   He tells Margo to cuff him and drag him out.  Margo has a few questions to ask first.  Paul saves her the trouble and admits his mistakes, offering an apology to Dusty.  Rose gets Dusty to not press charges.  He sucker punches Paul in the stomach to take some sort of revenge.  Margo looks the other way.  After Margo leaves, Molly also slugs Paul for getting her locked in the van.  She says she won't be helping him in the future.\n\n\nAlison and Mike visit Chris and Katie with sundaes.  Mike asks for some alone time with Katie.  After her dream, Katie's heart is a little more open to hear what Mike has to say.  He offers her another olive branch, and this time it's not greeted with a hedge trimmer.  She begins to sob again, and pleads with Mike to give her some more space and time to heal.  He passes Chris and Alison on his way to the car.  Chris asks Alison to go to the new Java club opening tomorrow.\n\n\nJen storms into Paul's apartment looking for answers after going a few rounds with Barbara.  She calls Dusty and leaves a message after she can't find her brother.  Later, Dusty returns Jen's call from the Lakeview Lounge and tells her to meet him tomorrow, then hangs up.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Alison convinced Mike that if they went to Tom and Margo's together, they would both get away with it, but things were still awkward when they arrived. Alison told Chris that Katie should be turning to Mike right now. They planned to attend the new club opening, then get a room in Bay City. Katie told Mike he was just a horrible reminder of Simon's death, and he said he understood, but that he would always care for her. Jen insisted that Dusty is the only person to never hurt her, and insinuated that Barbara actually wants Dusty for herself. Barbara admitted she was lonely, but said she didn't want Dusty. In the surveillance van, Dusty and Molly continued to kiss, but were soon discovered. They were brought to the police station, and Dusty told Margo they were there because of Paul bugging the club. Paul told Rose he loved her and would fight for her. Rose convinced Dusty not to press charges against Paul, but he punched Paul in the stomach before leaving with Rose. Molly said she was out of the deal with Paul.",
