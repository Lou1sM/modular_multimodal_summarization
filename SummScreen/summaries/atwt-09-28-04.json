He left a nurse in the room as he exited, so that Barbara could take her medication. Barbara disrupted the situation by dropping her pills, causing the nurse to have to bend over to pick them up from the floor. As she did so, Barbara drugged the nurse, and she fell to the floor.\n\n\nAt the house, Will and Paul were talking. Will thought that no one would ever forgive him for what he had done. Paul said that it would be all right. He blamed Barbara for a lot of things and said that he was through with her. Paul left the room for a moment, and there was a knock on the door. He opened it and found Barbara, his mother, standing there. She said, \"Hello, son.\" Then she entered the house. He told her that he didn't want to see her again.\n\n\nPaul went down the stairs and discovered that Barbara was in the house. Paul was concerned for Will but told him that everything was going to be all right. He called the hospital and told them to go there and pick up Barbara and to take restraints for her because she was dangerous. He comforted Will by telling him that they were only going to take Barbara back and not him.\n\n\nBarbara was trying to tell Paul that Will had manipulated the whole situation. He was responsible for going to her the first night she had been admitted to the hospital and also for taking her a nurse's uniform so that she could make it to Will's room. He'd also planned for her to be there as Hal, Jennifer, and he had been visiting. He'd had a plan for getting out, and he'd used and was using all of them for his own purposes.\n\n\nBarbara told Paul that \"Will is just not confused as he was when he first was admitted, but now he is dangerous.\" The men arrived from the hospital, and Paul instructed them to take her away. For Paul, the message to Barbara was, \"stay away from Will, or if you try to see him, you will have to see me too.\"\n\n\nHal and Emily talked. Emily told Hal that she'd never had an affair with Chris. It had just been that she had always been left alone. Chris walked into the room and announced to Hal that he was in love with Emily. He walked over to Emily and told her that he thought that she was in love with him too. Emily was beside herself. She was saying to Chris that he was all wrong and that he was making a fool of himself. He needed to stop going on about his feelings. She said that marriage wasn't a bed of roses, but she wanted her husband.\n\n\nEmily looked at Chris and told him to go and look for Alison and to let her yell and whatever at him for causing her so much pain. She said that it was the least he could do for her. Chris left. Emily tried once again to tell Hal how she had been feeling. He was never around for her and was always helping someone else. She'd gotten involved in the contest for the keys because she'd wanted something to do, but she'd ended up getting involved. She wanted to make it up to Hal but didn't know how. Hal told her that he didn't think she could make it up.\n\n\nHal walked out on Emily once again. She sat and cried. A while later, Hal returned and wanted to talk to Emily. She wished he would just yell at her or do something, besides just stand there and do and say nothing. He related the fact that on his cell phone, there were many calls from friends and the people at the police station, needing him for one thing or another, and he always had time for them. She had turned to him on numerous occasions, and he had always been too busy for her. She'd tried over and over, and he'd just kept shutting her out. He said that he didn't blame her for what had happened. He apologized to her and embraced her and she him.\n\n\nAaron and Alison were still in the pond. She blamed Aaron for what had happened because he had known about Chris and Emily and hadn't told her. She asked Aaron how he could do that to her and then say that he loved her. She accused Aaron of letting Chris break her heart and wanted to know why. He explained that he had tried to tell her when he'd first suspected something; in fact, he had gone to Chris, and Chris had explained it away. He hadn't wanted to say anything to her because he didn't want to be the one who hurt her. Alison told him that he'd hurt her every day by not saying anything to her.\n\n\nChris approached the area, calling for Alison. She didn't want to talk with him, and Aaron helped her to hide. He faced Chris instead. Aaron told him to stay away from her. Chris told him that he'd tried to do everything to make it work, but he just couldn't. He left. Alison appeared at Aaron's side and began to wonder what was wrong with her. She'd had nightmares about the wedding, and it seemed that they were being realized. She asked Aaron to not try to protect her but to be honest and real with her.\n\n\nAlison thought that something had to be wrong with her that those things kept happening to her. Aaron told her that she deserved to be treated like the totally amazing person that she was. She rebounded by grabbing him, kissing him, and then running away.\n\n\nDusty and Lucy were trying to settle things. She wanted to know the truth about what was going on with the fight. He tried to explain it to her by using a ballet dancer and Swan Lake as an example, to no avail. Lucy just knew that things would be a lot simpler if he would use her money. She asked if he thought that she would love him any less if he used her money.\n\n\nTom and Margo were having a heart-to-heart about what had happened. Chris entered and wanted to talk with Tom. Margo let the two of them talk alone by leaving the room. Tom asked Chris what he was planning to do. Chris explained that the only thing he knew was that Alison had trusted him, and he couldn't have hurt her more. Tom told Chris that what had happened didn't make him a terrible person, but he had done a terrible thing. He said, \"In time, people will forget what happened and will forgive you, but it won't be tonight.\"\n\n\nChris thanked Tom and left. Margo overheard the last part of the conversation and walked into the room. She asked if it was true that people would forget and forgive. Tom told her that he thought it was possible. A cup of coffee was offered, but Tom rejected it. He expected that his parents would want to talk with him in the morning. Tom reached for Margo, planted a kiss on her cheek, smiled, and walked out the door. Margo smiled back at him.\n\n\n",
