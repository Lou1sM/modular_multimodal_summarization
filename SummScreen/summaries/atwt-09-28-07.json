Sofie tells him to mind his own business, but later, Aaron finds a bottle of prenatal vitamins hidden behind the bar and tells Sofie it's hard to mine his own business when she's hiding things from Cole right in front of him. Sofie apologizes just as Cole walks in; he's there to get money from her so he can go eat at the diner, and when she asks how his writing is going, he snaps at her to stop nagging him and leaves.\n\n\nAt home, Will tells Gwen he'll feel better when it's just him, Gwen, and the baby, without Alison being involved anymore. Gwen tells Will she's worried about Sofie and Cole and thinks she may have been too hard on Cole, given that he also had to put up with Iris as a mother. Will doesn't agree, but he says he'll go with her if she truly feels the need to try to reach out to Cole. They find Cole at the diner, where he rudely tells them to get out. Gwen repeatedly tries to apologize and offers to take his music to a composer friend of hers, but Cole continues to be belligerent about it, so Gwen says Will is probably right, Cole just needs to grow up. She tells him he's not doing a very good job of that, letting his pregnant girlfriend work to support them and turning down offers of help; Cole says Sofie's not pregnant anymore, and Gwen starts to contradict him before she realizes he doesn't know that Sofie never had the abortion. She tries to cover, but Cole realizes what she means and goes to the Lakeview looking for Sofie. He sees her just after she turns away from the bar and puts her hand on her abdomen, feeling her baby move.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Henry and Vienna visit Katie, who tells them Jack is with Carly, telling the kids about her illness. When she says she wishes there were something she could do, Vienna says there is, and she makes up the room and tells Katie she should dress more attractively for Jack, to remind him that there is good and bad in life at the same time; she needs to not let Jack forget the good things. They tell Katie that Jack needs to take care of Carly, Katie needs to take care of Jack, and they will take care of Katie.\n\n\nAt Carly's, Jack tells her that the kids are asleep, and Carly tells him that she has decided to take whatever treatments the doctor offers that will help improve the time she has left to live. She asks Jack to be honest with her throughout this ordeal and let her know if she's not acting like herself, and if she can't get it together, to please take the kids so they won't see her like that. Carly then asks Jack if he will videotape her making some messages for the kids to watch on future occasions like birthdays and graduations. He understands the need to do this while the kids are sleeping, so he goes back to the Lakeview to find the video camera the kids gave him as a wedding gift. Once there, he explains to Katie what Carly wants to do, and she tells him not to worry about her, but to help Carly through this. He leaves, and Carly has him tape messages, including one for Sage's 16th birthday, in which Carly asks her to try to be like her father (to think about what's right and wrong and to tell the truth, something that did not come naturally to her); she tells Sage to seek advice and strength from all the wonderful women in her life, including her aunts, the Snyder women, and Katie, who's in her corner, too. When she's finished, Jack goes back to Katie, who is watching TV with Henry and Vienna. They leave so Katie and Jack can have their privacy, but Jack is so exhausted that he lays down on the bed and immediately falls asleep. \n\n\nAt Carly's, she awakens after having a bad dream, and she sees the video camera still set up and decides to tape a message for Jack. In it, she tells him about her dream and how her current situation feels like a bad dream to her; she also tells him how much she loves him, and how much she wants him to be really happy with Katie, because more than anything else, she wants Jack to have a happy life. She finishes the tape and turns off the camera, then begins crying. Parker comes downstairs and sees her sobbing, so he uses his cell phone to call Jack. Carly hears him and takes away the phone, telling Jack she's fine and saying that she and Parker will talk about things some more. She tells Jack to turn off his phone and go back to sleep, but instead, Jack takes the phone to bed with him, laying it between him and Katie. Carly talks to Parker, who says he called Jack because he always knows what to do. Carly says that's a great quality for a father to have, and she'd feel better if he would let Jack adopt him. Parker says he doesn't want to talk about it, and Carly says she'll shut up when the adoption papers are final; Parker starts to get mad, but then catches himself and apologizes. Carly tells him she wants to spend her remaining time with her kid, the one who gets mad, the one who gives her a good fight; Parker says meekly, \"I hate you.\" Carly laughs and says, \"Right back at you,\" and hugs him.\n\n\nRosanna tells Paul she has a session with her physical therapist and would appreciate some time alone, so he tells her he's going to Old Town to shop for a while. After he leaves, Rosanna gets a call from Craig, who again tries to tell her that pursuing a case against him will only result in Meg ending up with Paul. She hangs up, and a private investigator, Jim Fellows, arrives; she shows him a picture of Paul and Meg and says she needs to be sure it's over between them. She tells him where Paul has gone, and he tells her she'll have an answer by the end of the day. \n\n\nIn Old Town, Meg walks by Barbara and tries to get away without talking to her, but Barbara corners her and says she was shopping for something festive to wear to Craig's trial tomorrow. Barbara tells Meg one of the many reasons she wants Craig put in jail is that then Meg can leave him and try to save her soul, if she still has one. After Barbara leaves, Paul walks up; seeing Meg, he turns to walk in the opposite direction, but she goes after him and gets him to sit with her for a minute. As they are talking, Mr. Fellows arrives and begins taping them with a cell phone video camera. Meg doesn't think what Craig did in switching the babies was any worse than what she and Paul did in keeping the information from Jennifer. She wants to know whether Rosanna truly remembered what Craig did the night of her car accident or if she's just saying what Paul told her to say, because if Rosanna really remembered it, and Craig did try to kill her, then she wants to see Craig punished for it, no matter what the actual charges are. Paul says Rosanna really remembered it, and he can't understand why Meg married Craig, knowing what kind of man he was. Meg reminds him that he knows exactly why she married Craig, and he knows who she really loved at the time. When Paul asks why she doesn't just walk away from Craig now, she says because she's been told there's no hope of being with the one she really loves, so she has nothing to walk to. Mr. Fellows leaves, and then Paul tells Meg that it's over between them; Meg responds that saying it doesn't make it so.  Then she says that ever since Craig returned to town, Paul was more involved in hating him than in loving her, and she thinks he came back from the dead not to find Meg, but to get Craig. She then tells Paul she knows who Craig is; it's Paul she's not sure she knows anymore.\n\n\nMeg leaves and finds Craig, who is upset because his lawyer thinks he should accept a plea bargain because he's afraid of Rosanna. Meg thinks Craig should be afraid, too, and she asks again if he tried to kill Rosanna. Craig again says no and wants to know how many more times he has to tell her that; she says until she believes it. Then she asks what happens if he goes to trial and is convicted, and Craig says the lawyer thinks he would get 10 to 15 years in jail. Meg says, \"Go for it.\"\n\n\nBarbara goes to see Rosanna, telling her how happy she is about her recovery and that she knows Paul is happy being with her. Rosanna is surprised, saying things sure changed in 2 years, and she thinks it's because she's the one who can put Craig in jail. Barbara says if that happens, then Paul will be happy and Lucy can bring Johnny back, and Rosanna says \"Everyone lives happily ever after?\" Barbara agrees, but she says it's all up to Rosanna. She leaves, and Rosanna wonders what Paul will do after she solves all his problems. The private investigator arrives with his camera and tells Rosanna he's sorry, saying she can keep the phone. Rosanna watches the video until Paul arrives. He is surprised she's not resting after her therapy session, and she says she does feel very tired and is going to go to bed so she can be rested for tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n",
