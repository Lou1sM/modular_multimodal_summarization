He said that there was no way that Liberty could afford the basic equipment she would need to take care of an infant.  Janet rang the doorbell and said that she had good news: they had found a couple who wanted to adopt Liberty's baby.  Brad griped that he was always the last one to know what was going on with his daughter, but Janet assured him that no one was keeping him out of the loop.\n\n\nJanet said she, herself, had just heard about it, and she was pleased that Liberty was handling the interview that afternoon without her mother's help.  Janet left the lawyer's card with Brad, and she left.  Brad looked at the card and decided that he needed to check out the adoptive parents, as well.  Katie tried to talk Brad out of it, but her husband was acting rashly, so in the end, Katie said that she would go with him.\n\n\nAt the farm, Jack walked downstairs and found Parker waiting with Liberty in the kitchen.  Jack was not pleased that his son was accompanying Liberty to meet with the lawyer and the adoptive parents to discuss legalities.  Liberty really wanted Parker with her, but Jack thought it was inappropriate, since Parker was not the baby's father.  Jack asked to speak with Parker privately, so Liberty left them alone in the kitchen.  Parker explained that Liberty was terrified that she would give the child to the wrong parents, and she was relying on Parker's opinion.\n\n\nLiberty returned, and Jack gave Parker permission to go with her.  The teens left for the appointment, and Janet returned, complaining about how negative Brad was about the adoption.  She was surprised that Parker had gone with Liberty, and it gave her second thoughts.  She changed her mind and decided that her daughter needed an adult's opinion, and that opinion should be hers.  Jack offered to drive them to the lawyer's office.\n\n\nAt the bar in the Lakeview, Paul and Emily met with an attorney about adopting a child.  Emily was amazed that their application had passed scrutiny, since both of them had served time in jail.  Paul reluctantly admitted that he had \"altered the truth\" a bit on the application, because, he said, \"everybody lies.\"  Emily thought that events were happening way too fast, so Paul asked if she was having second thoughts.  Emily said that she was totally on board, just nervous.  They headed to the meeting with the pregnant mother.\n\n\nLiberty and Parker were the first to arrive for the meeting, so they waited in a conference room.  Parker assured Liberty that she would make the correct decision.  Jack and Janet walked in, much to Liberty's surprise, followed almost immediately by Brad and Katie.  Everyone began talking at once, and that escalated into shouting.  Paul and Emily walked up to the door and could hear the maelstrom from inside.  They almost didn't go in, but Paul opened the door.  Jack told them that they were about to have a meeting in that room, and Emily answered that so were they.  Liberty asked if they were the couple who wanted to adopt her baby, and Jack blurted out, \"No way!\"\n\n\nThe judge arrived, but Jack continued to express his displeasure at the identity of the couple.  He and Brad ran through a litany of offenses, both legal and moral, that Paul and Emily had committed.  Paul then accused them of insulting him and his wife, while poor Liberty shook her head in disbelief.   The judge was disgusted and declared the non-meeting over, but Paul said that he had heard from everyone but Liberty.  Emily addressed the girl to see if there was anything that Liberty wanted to ask them, but Liberty called for Parker, and the two made a hasty exit.\n\n\nJanet was angry and complained that Uncle Ralph, who had recommended the attorney, had made a mistake, but Paul stated that the meeting got \"whacko\" when all of Liberty's family showed up to attack him and Emily.  Paul called them all \"judgmental,\" and said it was too bad that the Snyders didn't have to fill out questionnaires before they had children.  Paul and Emily walked out, and Brad turned to Janet and accused her of stalling until it was too late for their daughter to have an abortion.  Katie yelled at Brad to stop shouting and to find Liberty and give her an apology.\n\n\nParker and Liberty went to the diner, and Liberty asked about Paul and Emily.  Parker said that he and Paul were friends, dating back to the days when Carly had run off with Simon Frasier.  He said that he didn't really know that much about Emily, but she had helped his sister, Jennifer, when Johnny was an infant.  Liberty did not think that Paul and Emily sounded so horrible.  She wished that she could have heard why they wanted her baby, but everyone was too noisy.  Parker said that perhaps it was not too late.\n\n\nThe teens went to Fairwinds, so Liberty could ask Paul and Emily why they wanted to adopt her baby.  The four of them sat down, and Parker began by asking why Paul had kidnapped Eliza, and the teen called it a \"creepy thing to do.\"  Paul explained that he and Emily had lost a baby several years before, and that had made him overprotective.  When Paul thought that Meg was taking Eliza away from him, he did some wrong things.  Paul called himself \"a changed man,\" who wanted to be a good person for his daughter and any other child that he and Emily might have the good fortune to raise.\n\n\nEmily said that her worst mistake was having a tubal ligation that could not be reversed.  She admitted that she had not always been a good mother, but she earnestly promised to be the best mom she could be, if she had another chance.\n\n\nBack at home, Katie told Brad that they should never have gone to the meeting.  Brad was sorry that he had lost it, but he was not sad that the adoption had fallen through.  Brad blamed Janet and her tunnel vision for all of Liberty's recent problems, and he said he was determined to take his daughter to the abortion clinic in Chicago as soon as possible.  Katie was disgusted, and she walked out of the room.\n\n\nCraig and Rosanna shared a hot kiss at Carly's house.  Craig said that it was the only way he could shut Rosanna up.  They immediately resumed their argument about Craig's \"cavorting\" with Audrey Coleman.  Craig claimed to be loyal to Carly, so Rosanna threw out their recent kiss.  Craig suggested that they just forget the kiss; it never happened.  Rosanna called Craig a pig, and he shouted, \"Back atcha, sister!\"  Rosanna tried to throw him out, and Craig was almost out the door when he remembered that she had driven him home from Metro and had his car keys in her purse.  Craig referred to Rosanna as a \"buzz kill\" while she searched for the keys.\n\n\nRosanna finally located the keys and handed them over, as Craig answered his phone.  The caller was Maggie, Johnny's babysitter, with the news that the boy had fallen on the school playground and suffered a gash on his head.  Craig told Maggie to take the boy directly to Memorial Hospital, and said that he would meet them there.  Craig was so upset that he didn't realize he had his keys in hand, and he kept shouting at Rosanna for them.  Rosanna took charge of the situation and said she would drive them to the hospital.\n\n\nCraig took Johnny from the sitter's arms and put him on a bed.  The gash looked painful, and a nurse asked everyone to leave the room while a doctor examined the boy.  In the hall, Craig lambasted Maggie with very harsh words until Rosanna was able to calm him.  Craig remembered how his son, Bryant, had looked after his motorcycle accident. The boy had been talking at the hospital, but he died not long afterward.  Rosanna assured Craig that would not happen to Johnny.\n\n\nCraig went into the room and accused the doctor of not doing his job.  Rosanna told him to lower his voice as the doctor explained that they were waiting for a plastic surgeon to arrive, and the specialist would put stitches in Johnny's forehead.  Rosanna started to leave, but Craig asked her to stay, so she thought up a game of charades to keep Johnny amused.  They played until the surgeon arrived, and he took the adults outside and explained that, because Johnny might have sustained a concussion, they would have to use a local anesthetic on the boy.  If they waited to verify the concussion, they risked danger of infection and scarring.\n\n\nRosanna assured the doctor that she and Craig could keep Johnny quiet during the suturing, and the procedure went well.  The doctor said the boy could go home, and Johnny asked Rosanna to go with them.  Back at the Lakeview, Johnny wanted to continue the game of charades, but Craig said it was bedtime.  Rosanna sang him the \"Mockingbird\" song, and Johnny fell asleep as she cuddled him.  Craig took the boy to bed, and Rosanna took off her blouse, which had gotten wet while they were bathing Johnny.  She had a shirt of Craig's to put on, but he walked in on her as she undressed.  They looked at each other for an electric moment.\n\n\nCraig apologized and turned his back.  As Rosanna prepared to walk out the door, Craig said, \"Stay.\"  She teased him until he changed his tune to \"Please, stay.\"  They sat on the couch, and Rosanna confessed that she used to imagine the two of them as parents, but they never got the chance.  Craig called Rosanna \"terrific,\" and they hugged.  They drew apart and had a deep look, and then they shared a long kiss.\n\n\nParker and Liberty finally returned to the farm, and Janet immediately apologized for \"bombarding\" her daughter.  She promised to do better at the next hearing, but Liberty announced that there would not be another one.  She said that she had decided to give her baby to Emily and Paul.  Jack and Janet were horrified.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul opened a bottle of champagne and said that even though she was an expectant mother, Emily could still drink.  They shared a laugh, but Emily was worried about Jack and Janet's reaction when they learned of Liberty's decision.  Paul said that they were going to think about their future and their family together.  They drank to \"new beginnings.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brad still wrestles with how to handle Liberty's pregnancy. Janet interrupts them to tell them after the fact that her uncle set up Liberty with a couple that wants to adopt her baby. At first, Brad isn't happy, but Katie is able to calm him down. Liberty wants Parker to go with her to the appointment. Jack isn't sure, but they are both able to convince him. Later, Janet and Brad separately both have misgivings about Liberty handling this without them and vow to show up at the meeting. Meanwhile, Paul and Emily are nervous about their meeting with a pregnant mother-to-be; Paul secretly admits to lying on the application, but Emily is more concerned about how this is going to play out with them as potential parents. Paul allays her fears. Craig and Rosanna are in another heated argument after Craig kisses Rosanna, but the argument is interrupted when Craig gets a call that Johnny has been hurt and is at the hospital. When Rosanna sees his reaction, she offers to drive him. Rosanna is able to calm Craig down, as he lashes out at the babysitter and doctors after admitting to worrying Johnny will die like Bryant. Rosanna is touched by this side of Craig and agrees to stay with him after Craig asks. Rosanna and Craig actually are able to enjoy each other's company, as they try to make Johnny feel better, as he gets stitched up. Craig appears vulnerable to Rosanna, as he needs her and Rosanna is moved by this side of him and can't help but be affected. They take Johnny home together. Liberty is overwhelmed when Janet, Jack, Brad and Katie show up at her meeting and everyone is even more shocked when Paul and Emily show up at the adoption meeting. Jack and Brad won't have it and loudly voice their opinions. Liberty can't take all of this and rushes out. Later, Liberty asks Parker about Paul and Emily's past. She decides to talk to them. After she does, Liberty is affected and appreciates Paul and Emily's candor; she goes to tell her mom that she made a decision. Janet is worried she is going to have an abortion because of how they all acted, but she is even more stunned when Liberty announces she wants Paul and Emily to adopt her baby. Meanwhile, Paul and Emily celebrate the possibility of their growing family. Rosanna sings Johnny to sleep, as Craig watches how maternal she is with him. Craig walks in, as Rosanna is changing out of her shirt, which leads to some awkwardness. Later though, after complimenting each other on how they were today, they wind up in an embrace that leads to a kiss.",
