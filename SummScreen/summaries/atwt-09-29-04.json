It seemed that Jennifer had told Mike about how Nikki felt, and Mike knew how Henry felt about Nikki. It didn't seem to be the right combination for anybody. Mike thought that he could only think about friendships for the moment.\n\n\nJennifer and Mike had nothing to do, since they'd pushed Henry and Nikki to each other, so they decide to have a cup of coffee and let the other two figure things out for themselves. Henry tried to make suggestive comments to Nikki, but she told him in no uncertain terms that they were just friends, which unfortunately was what Henry said they were also.\n\n\nPaul and Will went for a bite to eat. Will excused himself for a minute, and Lily entered the room and saw Paul. She walked up to the table. Her feeling was that Will had been let out of the hospital too early. She did want Will to get better, however. She just felt that he hadn't been treated for a long enough period of time to be released yet. Paul told Lily that he didn't feel it was fair that Will was treated like the town pariah either. Will returned to the table, and Lily addressed him. She tried to remain civil and said that he had every right to be back in town. Even though she'd lost Rose because of him, she would do her best to be cordial to him.\n\n\nLily extended her hand to shake his, but Will just stood there, forcing Lily to leave, telling Paul that it seemed Will had not been touched by her speech. Paul felt it was because Will just hadn't grasped what had happened to him yet, and he implored her to please give Will a break. Lily felt like she had just done that. Later, Paul told Will that he needn't worry so much. His mother had been locked away, and he had just been given a new life for himself.\n\n\nBarbara told her new doctor that perhaps her brain tumor was resurfacing and perhaps she should see the doctor who'd treated her before. The new doctor said that her problem from before was probably not the problem, but she was allowed to contact her old doctor. Walker Daniels entered Barbara's room. She embraced him. She tried to use the same old story on him. He told her that he could not believe that someone else was causing the problems she was having. He told her that she was sick and needed help.\n\n\nWalker assured Barbara that he would help her -- by doing what he could to make sure that she stayed there and got the help she needed. He told her that she needed someone else to tend to her. Walker told her not to call him anymore, because he wouldn't go there. Walker left the room.\n\n\nInside the room, Barbara was calling out, \"Where are my children?\" Outside the room, someone was watching Barbara very carefully. The doctor returned to check on Barbara. As he left, another doctor walked into the room. Barbara looked up to hear the man say that he \"is there to help\" her. It was Rick Decker.\n\n\nHolden watched as Aaron tried to take his anger out on something else. Aaron admitted to being angry and not knowing what to do to stop how he was feeling. He told Holden that he was in love with Alison, no matter what she had done to him. Holden reminded Aaron of some of the things that Alison had been involved with, yet Aaron was in love with her. Aaron could not control how he was feeling. Holden told him to go to Alison and tell her how he felt about her. If he loved her, he should go after her.\n\n\nSusan answered the door and found Bob and Kim on the other side. They were there to help find a solution to what had happened. No one had seen either Chris or Alison since the ceremony. While the two women were bantering back and forth, Bob received a phone call from Lisa, stating that Chris was at the Lakeview.\n\n\nJust before they reached Chris's room, Bob and Lisa talked about the doubts that Chris had been having before the wedding. They knocked on Chris's door, and he opened it and let them in. Bob told Chris that what he had done was absolutely thoughtless. He had no regard for Alison or for what he had done to her in front of her friends and family. His father thought that Chris had a lot of apologizing to do, especially to Alison, and instead of wallowing in self-pity, he should go and take care of things.\n\n\nEmily walked into the church and spotted Alison there. Alison wondered why Emily had let it all happen. Alison told her that she was her sister, and she trusted her more than anyone. She told Emily that even though Chris was the one who had driven a knife into her back, Emily was the one who had twisted it. Emily apologized. She told Alison that none of it was Alison's fault. Things had just happened.\n\n\nAlison, upset and angry, told Emily that she'd ended up not getting married and not being with Chris. She had no wedding, no husband, no ring, and no sister. Alison left her and headed for home. Susan told Alison that there would be a day when she felt that special something for someone else again. Susan said if she could survive Rick Decker, then Alison could certainly survive Chris Hughes.\n\n\nAt the pond, Aaron met up with Alison. He wanted to talk to his best friend. Alison let Aaron know that she'd slept at the church. Aaron admitted to Alison that they could write a book with all that had happened to them. He told her that he would always be her very best friend.\n\n\nHolden told Lily that he was concerned about all the anger that she was keeping inside of her. She needed to feel better about the future.\n\n\nAaron daydreamed about Alison.\n\n\n",
