She and Simon bemoan the fact that this means the realtors can't come to see the finished penthouse, but Simon tries to look on the bright side of being stuck with Carly in a beautifully appointed penthouse that still has electricity. They change into robes and smoking jackets that Carly has bought as \"accent pieces\" for the suite, and as Simon offers Carly some champagne, the power finally goes out. Carly worries about her kids, but Simon points out that Jack would have made sure they were safe, so Carly relaxes, and when Simon begins to try to romance her, she tells him to shut up and just kiss her.\n\n\nLucy runs into Dusty in the woods and tells him she lost control of her car and went into a ditch. He asks about Johnny, and Lucy says his fever was very high and that he needs to get to the hospital right away. She tells Dusty to go on without her, because she'll just slow him down and she needs to go back to look for the man who helped her get out of her car, but Dusty insists that they all go together. Just then, a man rides up in some type of tractor/plow and offers them a lift; when Lucy asks, he tells her he saw her car in the ditch but didn't see any signs of anyone trapped near it. \n\n\nJack and Margo go to Memorial Hospital, where Bob asks for their help in keeping the ER moving in an orderly manner. Margo is worried about Katie, who is out looking for Mike, but no one has seen either of them yet. Meanwhile, Luke and Holden tell Lucinda that Lily is missing, and when they get no help from the staff, they split up and begin searching the hospital for her, floor by floor. Luke runs into Bob and tells him about his mom, and Bob says he'll take the time to find out what happened to Lily because \"Lily's important to me.\" Lucy and Dusty arrive with Johnny, who ends up just having a case of strep throat, but Bob tells Lucy she did the right thing by bringing him to the hospital because he could have had seizures with a fever that high. Dusty gives Lucy a kiss on the forehead as thanks \"from Johnny\" and then kisses her on the cheek as thanks \"from me.\" Holden, Luke, and Lucinda all meet up again, with no news about Lily; a gurney is wheeled by with a dead body covered up on it, and Holden asks if he can see who it is because his wife is missing; when he pulls back the sheet, it's another woman, not Lily. Relieved, Lucinda takes Luke down to the hospital daycare center to check on the girls while Holden stops by the chapel. Kneeling, Holden remembers his \"visitation\" from Lily; when he turns around, he sees Lily in the flesh, sitting in another pew.\n\n\nOut in the woods, Katie stumbles across some type of building where she finds Mike.\n\n\nPaul finds Meg and Emily trapped in Emma's burning barn, grabs a blanket and throws it in the trough to wet it, then runs into the barn and drapes the wet blanket over Meg and Emily. They run out of the barn, and Paul grabs another blanket and follows them. Their phones are still not working, so they take Emily to Emma's house, where Meg begins directing Paul as to what supplies to get to prepare to deliver Emily's baby. The ice storm eventually puts out the fire in the barn, so they are safe at the house. Emily blames Meg for her water breaking, saying she locked her in a burning barn. She says she refuses to let Meg be the one to deliver her child and that she'll walk to the hospital if she has to, but it is obvious that that is not an option, and Meg tells Emily that she'll just have to deal with it. Emily then tells Paul she's worried that he and Meg will take the baby and leave as soon as it's born, but Paul promises her he won't do that. As she prepares to deliver her baby, Emily tells Paul that if it's a girl, she wants to name her Jennifer, because Paul's sister was so good to her, and Paul is obviously very touched by this. He provides plenty of encouragement as Emily pushes, and Meg delivers a baby girl.. Emily says, \"It's Jennifer!\" but then asks, \"Why isn't she making any sound?\"\n\n\n",
