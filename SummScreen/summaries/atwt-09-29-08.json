He was surprised when Janet told him that Katie had not come home all night. Brad called the hospitals to make sure she had not had an accident, but there was no word there. He then waited for a call from the Oakdale Police Department, telling him what the consequences of his confession would be. \n\n\nIn Chicago, Katie woke up next to Mike and was horrified. She realized Brad would be frantic, but first she called WOAK and asked Kim to postpone her shoot so she could talk to Brad. Both Katie and Mike were suffering from major hangovers from their binge the night before, and Mike said he had to feel better before he could drive home. \n\n\nCarly went to Metro and found Bonnie, who had been waiting there all night for Derek Coburn. She was very worried that he had come to harm at the hands of James Stenbeck, so she asked Carly to call Jack and ask him to look for her friend. Carly reluctantly agreed. \n\n\nAt the police station, Dallas informed Jack that his brother had made a confession. Jack was pleased, but then he suddenly received a text message purportedly from Meg, telling him she was on an island called Mattamoi. Jack took Carly's call but told her he was involved in following up a lead on Meg at that moment. \n\n\nDusty and Meg, who had escaped from the cottage on the island, woke up on the beach, and Dusty wanted to sneak back in for some food, but Meg would not allow it. They saw a flagpole flying the American flag on top of the cliff and decided they would climb to it. Meg had spelled out P-A-U-L in stones on the beach, but Dusty persuaded her that it was too dangerous and destroyed her signal. They climbed the hill and discovered that the flag was flying from an abandoned lighthouse. They went to the top and found it gave them a great vantage point of the beach. They found some food and cooking equipment, but Meg was more interested in getting the electricity working and possibly the lighthouse beacon. She told Dusty she was handy at fixing things at the farm, and before long she had electricity for a hot plate and they could make something to eat. As they ate, Meg questioned Dusty as to how he had accomplished his \"death,\" but he would only say that he had help. Then Meg began working on the light while Dusty prowled through some old boxes. In one of them, he found a loaded revolver. \n\n\nPaul arrived at the cottage and found it deserted until James walked in. James claimed he knew nothing about Meg but had only followed Paul there. Paul said he knew Meg had been there and smelled her perfume on her bed pillows. Beside the bed, he found a locket belonging to his dead sister, Jennifer, and he knew that Dusty had been there, as well. Paul, however, felt something did not make sense. James suggested that Dusty had brought Meg to the island and Meg was willing because Paul had disappointed her by not being enough of a man. His father urged Paul to go looking for Meg and Dusty and handed him a gun. \n\n\nBrad was still making calls looking for Katie when Janet told him that Katie had phoned the television station and explained she was delayed in Chicago. Brad knew WOAK kept an apartment in Chicago for their news staff, and despite being told not to leave town by the police, he took off for Chicago with great expectations of a conjugal visit with Katie. \n\n\nBonnie and Carly made calls around town, still looking for Derek, until it occurred to Carly that Fairwinds had been where Henry had been imprisoned, and it might warrant a look for Derek. The two of them went to investigate and indeed found Derek in the holding cell. He told them that Stenbeck had Meg at a place called Faro Island, and Carly realized that Jack was on his way to Mattamoi and was probably walking into a trap. She tried to call him, but had to leave a voice message instead. Carly left Bonnie with Derek and took off. \n\n\nIn Chicago, Brad knocked on the door of the WOAK apartment and Katie answered. Mike was in the shower, so Brad was understandably disturbed when Mike exited the bathroom wearing only a towel. Brad complained to Katie that he had taken responsibility for his actions and there she was carrying on with Mike. Brad walked out, and Mike tried to calm Katie. \n\n\nPaul ran on the beach looking for signs of his wife and noticed the flag on top of the hill. He climbed the hill and approached the lighthouse. Inside, Meg got the beacon working, and Dusty suggested they find some material to block it so that when it got dark they could send an SOS signal. Dusty checked the gun he had found and went to work looking for something to block the light. Meg was feeling some twinges from the baby, so Dusty insisted she lie down and rest. \n\n\nBrad went home, and Katie followed soon afterward. She had taken a taxi all the way from Chicago. She kissed her husband, who told her it was too late, but Katie argued that she wanted to have a life with Brad and only Brad, and he admitted he wanted the same thing. The phone rang and it was the call Brad had been expecting; Dallas wanted him at the police station. Brad and Katie went down, and Brad signed the statement he had given earlier, and then girded himself for the punishment. They were pleasantly surprised when Dallas gave them the news that Leo's parents had declined to press charges. Katie figured out that Dallas had spoken to them on Brad's behalf, and Brad was free. \n\n\nDusty and Meg practiced with the signal light as Paul entered the lighthouse at the bottom. Dusty wanted Meg to get some more rest but she wanted him to rest with her. They leaned against a wall and tried to sleep. Dusty put the revolver down near them in case he fell asleep. Paul checked his own gun as he came up the stairs and approached the top slowly. \n\n\nJack found Mattamoi Island and a man with a boat who was willing to take him around the island for no fee. As they made the loop around the island and neared the dock again, the boatman grabbed Jack from behind and tried to strangle him. Carly appeared on the dock and spotted Jack just as the boatman threw him overboard. Carly jumped in and swam to Jack and towed him to some reeds along the shoreline. She asked him if he had been shot, but Jack went unconscious, and Carly began CPR.\n\n\n",
