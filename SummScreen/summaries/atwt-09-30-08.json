Susan realized that Emily was having her tubes tied and questioned her about the suddenness of her decision. Emily left for the hospital, and Susan ran into Dani Andropoulus as she was leaving. She casually mentioned to Dani that Emily was having a minor procedure that day, and Dani promptly made a phone call. \n\n\nAaron took a message for Alison reminding her of an appointment with Dr. Schiller. He got excited when he remembered she was Meg's  obstetrician-gynecologist, and asked Alison if she had something to tell him. She assured him that it was just a routine check before they planned a baby. Alison went to Memorial and Chris overheard her checking in, so he expressed concern to her about the appointment. She told him that she was none of his business any more. Dr. Schiller examined Alison and asked all the appropriate questions. She also suggested an ultrasound just to be sure there were no problems, and Alison agreed. \n\n\nCarly's CPR worked on Jack, and he regained consciousness. She told him how James had set him up, and they hugged. Jack had injured his hand, but he was too anxious to find Meg to get medical help for himself. The two of them began to explore the island and came across a cottage called \"Swans Down,\" with a sign with two swans on it. It matched the cottage that Paul had described in his vision. They went in carefully and found the living room and then the bedroom where Meg slept. Jack was feeling that something was \"off,\" and went back into the living room alone. As soon as he passed through the door, James stepped out from behind the door and knocked him out with a blow to the head. Carly rushed in, and James's associate covered her nose with a rag doused with chloroform. \n\n\nPaul climbed to the top of the lighthouse and found Dusty and Meg asleep. He woke them at gunpoint by demanding that Dusty take his hands off Meg. Meg tried to explain the situation, but Paul did not believe it because of the lies James had told him. James crept up the stairs as Meg inserted herself between Dusty and her husband and tried to defuse the situation. She begged Paul to just take her and their baby home, but James spoke up and called his son weak-and urged him to kill Dusty. Dusty put his own gun to James's head and told Paul to just say the word and his father was history. As Paul was making up his mind which course to take, James grabbed Dusty's arm and the two struggled out onto the balcony of the lighthouse. Paul angled for a good shot, and finally fired. James tumbled over the balcony onto the ground below. \n\n\nDani met Casey after her phone call to him and explained that Emily was having surgery, probably at that very moment. Casey was stunned and called Emily, but she did not pick up. He took off for the hospital while Emily was signing the consent forms for her tubal ligation. \n\n\nIn another examining room, Dr. Schiller broke the bad news to Alison that her ultrasound had revealed pelvic inflammatory disease, a condition that would make it difficult, if not impossible, for Alison to get pregnant. The disease was sometimes caused by having multiple sexual partners, any one of whom could have infected her. Alison's past had come back to haunt her yet again. She was upset and ran out of the examining room. Chris was in the hall and comforted her. \n\n\nCarly and Jack woke up in a rowboat in the middle of nothing but water. Jack's hand was bleeding badly, so Carly made a bandage from her bandana. Jack was cold, despite the warm sunlight, so Carly put her arms around him. He apologized for how he had treated her, and she told him he could make it up to her by getting them off the boat and back into civilization. Suddenly, Carly realized the boat had been drifting, and she spotted something encouraging. \n\n\nCasey saw Emily in one of the examining rooms at Memorial and barged in. She explained she was having her tubes tied, but Casey told her she could not go through with it. Emily told him it was not his decision to make, but Casey argued that she had no faith in them as a couple. He said to her before he left that if she loved him, she would not have the procedure. \n\n\nMeg came out on the balcony of the lighthouse and discovered Dusty had been shot in the shoulder. She brought him inside while Paul ran down to see what had happened to his father. James was lying at the base of the lighthouse, and he grabbed Paul and called him unworthy, then passed out. Paul screamed at him that he could not die before he gave Paul some answers, but Barbara arrived with the EMTs, who could not find a pulse on James. They prepared him for transport while Paul continued to ask his father if he were proud of him yet. Meg brought out Dusty and told the medics that he had a shoulder wound. Barbara was stunned to see Dusty and asked him if James had shot him. Paul admitted that he had shot Dusty. \n\n\nAaron found Dr. Schiller in the hospital, but Alison was gone. Alison went to the coffee shop with Chris and told him what the doctor had told her. She referred to herself as a slut and cried over never having a little voice call her \"Mommy.\" Chris tried to cheer her up, but Alison could not be consoled. She and Chris went back to Memorial where they found Aaron, who was angry and hurt that Alison had told Chris about her condition before she told him. The newlyweds left, and Chris tried to get Dr. Schiller to talk about Alison's condition, but she told him he knew better than to ask. When they got back to the farm, Aaron reassured Alison that nothing had changed and she should stop taking all the blame. Alison did not want to talk about it anymore. \n\n\nDani found Casey in Old Town and asked him about Emily. He explained what Emily wanted to do in order to avoid a commitment to him. He was discouraged about their relationship. Meanwhile, the doctor at Memorial questioned Emily about whether she was sure she wanted to take such a final step. \n\n\nCarly and Jack floated to shore, and Carly hiked to an abandoned ranger station and called Dallas, who promised to send the local police. She gave the news to Jack that James had fallen and was dead, but she assured him that Meg was safe. \n\n\nAt the lighthouse, Meg told Paul that she loved him and then left with the EMTs to get checked out. Paul looked at James's body on the gurney, and James appeared to him in a vision and warned his son that he had failed to kill the real Stenbeck, Dusty, and he would lose his wife to him. Paul watched the medics put his father's body in the ambulance. \n\n\n",
