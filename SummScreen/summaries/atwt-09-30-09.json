Janet was very worried and wanted Jack to put out an all points bulletin on her daughter immediately.  Jack laughed and suggested that Janet just call the girl on her cell phone, but Janet was fearful that if Liberty didn't answer, it might mean that she had gone to Chicago for the abortion.  Jack finally convinced his wife to call Liberty.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Liberty said good morning to Emily and Paul.  She said that she had slept very well and was actually hungry for the first time in a long while.  Liberty mentioned how stressful it was for her at the farm, so Emily suggested that the girl move in with them for the duration of her pregnancy.  Liberty's phone rang, and she spoke to her worried mother.  Liberty evaded Janet's questions by saying that she had spent the night with a friend, but she would be home soon.\n\n\nEmily again invited Liberty to live with them, but Liberty said there was no way that Janet would go for it.  Emily said that she would go home with the girl and speak to Janet, so the two of them drove to the farm.  When Janet saw that her daughter was safe, she overreacted and shouted that she had been frightened to death not knowing where Liberty was.  Emily walked in, much to Janet's surprise, so Liberty owned up that she had spent the night at Fairwinds.  Janet demanded to know what was going on, but she did not want to hear anything from Emily.\n\n\nEmily explained that Liberty had chosen her and Paul to be the baby's adoptive parents, so Liberty was her business, too.  In fact, Emily said, Liberty would be living with them until the baby was born.  \"Over my dead body!\" yelled Janet, and she lit into Emily and raised Liberty's stress level even higher.  Liberty accused her mom of telling her that what she wanted was wrong, and Janet became even more wound up.  Jack grabbed Janet's hand and dragged her out to the porch.  He told his wife to let Liberty go with Emily and to let him try to help her.\n\n\nJack left, and Janet went back inside.  As soon as Liberty went upstairs to pack, Janet turned to Emily and asked \"where the hell\" she got off turning Janet's daughter against her.  Emily said that Janet didn't need anyone to do that, because Janet had done a pretty good job of it herself.  Emily tried to convince Janet that Liberty's living with them was a win/win situation, but Janet grumbled that having Paul and Emily raise her grandchild was no win/win.  Liberty returned with her bag, but she refused any more conversation with her mother.  She carried her bag outside, and Emily followed.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul was playing on the floor with Eliza when Jack walked in.  He bluntly asked Paul to back off on the \"baby situation.\"  Paul said that he thought they were adopting a baby, not a \"situation.\"  Jack pointed to Eliza and remarked that Paul already had a gorgeous daughter of his own, so he didn't need another baby.  Paul said that he was unaware that there was a limit on babies, and he wanted to know what Jack's real problem was.  Jack mentioned how upset Janet was, and Paul caught on that Jack was worried that Janet would go off the deep end.  Paul said Liberty wanted him and Emily to be her baby's parents, and Jack needed to let it be.\n\n\nAfter Jack left Fairwinds, Emily and Liberty returned.  Liberty watched the couple play with Eliza, and the discussion turned to Liberty's prenatal care.  Emily began pushing milk, healthy foods, and meal plans, and she warned Liberty against diet sodas.  Liberty became overwhelmed with all the information, but Paul and Emily stopped by the hospital on the way to return Eliza, and they took home all sorts of pamphlets and prenatal brochures.  Emily also promised to order some books on her computer for Liberty, and then the conversation turned to labor pains.  Liberty folded and said she needed to lie down.\n\n\nJack told Janet that he had seen Paul playing with Eliza and that he was very good with the baby.  Janet was unimpressed, and again Jack reminded her that it was Liberty's decision to make.  Janet pondered for several minutes, and then she asked what Jack thought Liberty might do if they made her a better offer.  Janet's idea was to keep the baby and raise it themselves.  Jack looked stunned, but Janet argued that her solution would be best for everyone concerned.  She pleaded with Jack to give Liberty a chance for a real future, and Jack agonized over his decision.  Finally, he gave in, and Janet was very grateful.\n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Station, Tom joined Margo as they made plans to attend Adam's hearing that morning.  Adam had wanted some time to himself and had agreed to meet them at the courthouse.  Both Tom and Margo were grateful to Maddie Coleman for returning to town to testify on their son's behalf.  Tom, however, was also worried about Casey and his deep-seated resentment towards his brother.\n\n\nAt Java, Alison was paying for her drink when Adam burst in and declared that her money was no good.  He insisted on paying her bill out of gratitude for Alison's convincing Maddie to set the record straight about Adam and the incident with Gwen.  Adam was distrustful of the hope he was feeling for the first time in a couple of years.  Alison was more hopeful than Adam about Casey, however.  Adam had to leave for the hearing, so Alison wished him luck and said she would wait at Java to hear the results.\n\n\nCasey awoke at home to find Maddie sitting on his bed.  She said that she had been considering his request not to testify for Adam, and she referred to it as \"emotional blackmail.\"  Maddie explained that her testimony had nothing to do with how she felt about Casey.  Casey was grumpy and claimed that everything in his life had gone wrong when Adam turned on him and the family.  He was still angry that his brother had used Casey's gambling addiction against him\n\n\nMaddie said that she thought Adam had changed, but Casey next accused his brother of turning Alison against him, and he was not about to stand by and watch Adam hurt Maddie with fallout from her testimony.  Maddie said that she had overreacted when Adam had attacked Gwen; she knew that he had not been trying to rape her.  Maddie gave Casey a hug, but she appeared conflicted.\n\n\nMaddie dropped by Java and talked with Alison.  She told her old friend that she had decided that she could not testify, after all, and Alison argued with her.  Maddie told her to let it go, and Alison figured out that Maddie had backed out because Casey didn't want her to testify.  Alison reminded Maddie how good Casey was at getting people to do what he wanted. Maddie said that Alison might have slept with Casey, but she didn't really know him at all.\n\n\nAdam met his folks at the courthouse, and Tom said that, with Maddie's testimony, probably Adam would be spending the night in his own house.  Margo worried that Maddie was not there yet, as the clerk called Adam's case.  The three of them entered the courtroom, and Tom requested a brief recess to await a witness.  The judge granted them an hour, so Adam said he thought he knew what had happened.  He said he had to leave, but he promised to be back on time.\n\n\nAdam went home and accused Casey of talking Maddie out of appearing in court.  Casey bitterly replied that \"forcing women\" was Adam's forte, not Casey's.  Casey was not at all moved by the fact that his brother was facing some serious jail time without Maddie's help.  Adam asked what Casey wanted in exchange for Maddie's testimony, and his brother answered that he wanted Adam to be out of his life, once and for all.  Adam once again agreed to leave Oakdale and never return.  Casey unloaded on Adam and restated his offer, and Adam again agreed to the terms.\n\n\nCasey went to Old Town and found Maddie leaving Java. He told her that he had changed his mind and wanted her to testify for Adam.  Maddie was pleased, because she had been carrying a load of guilt.  The two of them hugged, and Maddie left for the courthouse after warning Casey that Alison was in Java and \"on the warpath.\"  Casey went inside and told Alison that he had \"fixed it.\"\n\n\nBack at the courthouse, Adam reassured his folks that everything would be all right.  The clerk called the case again just as Maddie walked in the door.  Maddie took the witness stand, and Tom led her through her story, including the part about burying Adam alive.  Maddie apologized to Adam profusely for that, as Tom asked her about Adam's state of mind after the accident.  When Maddie finished, Tom dismissed the girl and proffered an affidavit from Gwen Munson stating that she had no objection to the court's not pursuing Adam's case.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Tom respectfully requested that the court drop the charges, and the judge concurred and dismissed the case.  Margo was ecstatic, but Adam wrestled with mixed emotions about being free and knowing that he had made a deal with the devil in order to achieve it.  Maddie went back to Java and told Alison and Casey the good news.  Tom also called Casey and said that Margo wanted to celebrate at the Lakeview, and she wished to invite Casey, Alison, and Maddie, as well.  Maddie declined, but Alison talked her into it.  Casey said he would meet them at the hotel, and he left to go home.\n\n\nAt the Hughes house, Adam was writing a note to his folks.  He told Casey that he hoped someday that Casey would want Adam in his life again, and Casey turned down a hug.  Adam put the note on the table and walked out.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Margo and Tom waited with the girls for Adam and Casey.  Margo finally decided to postpone the celebration, and she told Tom that they should go home.  The girls went back to Java and questioned Casey about his absence at the celebration.  Casey said he hadn't seen the point of the hoopla, and he dropped the bomb that Adam had left town for good.  Alison was shocked, and mentioned the effect Adam's leaving would have on Margo.  Casey said that it was necessary, and if Alison loved him, she would be on his side.\n\n\nAlison said she did love Casey, but she would not allow him to use her love as a weapon against her.  She walked out of the coffee shop, but Casey followed.  Alison said that Casey had accused Adam of pulling strings, but Casey had manipulated people even more.  She pointed out how deeply he had hurt his parents, and Alison said she could not be with Casey anymore.  As far as she was concerned, they were done.\n\n\nMaddie watched from the doorway of Java, and after Alison walked away, she approached Casey and put her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\nAt home, Margo read Adam's note, and she tearfully said that something drove her son away.  She broke down, and Tom took her in his arms.\n\n\n",
