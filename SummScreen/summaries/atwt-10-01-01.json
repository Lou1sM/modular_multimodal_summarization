Jake tells her that he is just going to call for a carry out and then he will disappear into his bedroom.  The women all jump on him and tell him that he can't stay there.  Carly hands him his tuxedo and the keys to her apartment and pushes him out the door.  As he is leaving, Jennifer walks in and tells Abigail that she needs to talk to her.  Molly tells Abigail that she has done enough and if she wants to go with Jennifer, she can leave.  Abigail gives her mother a kiss and tells her that she won't be out too late.  Abigail and Jennifer leave and in the hall, Jennifer tells Abigail that she has some amazing news to tell her.  Back in the apartment, the ladies go back to work discussing something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.  Molly tells Donna that she is going to pin that Scottish coin that belong to her family to her dress.  Donna has tears come to her eyes and tells Molly that she is grateful that she is so sensitive to her family.  \"Something new will be her Carly Original dress that she will wear.\"  Carly states.  Donna asked about something borrowed.  Molly looks at Carly and says that she doesn't have something borrowed.  Donna tells her not to worry, she will take care of that.  Then they go on to something blue.  Carly pulls out some blue underwear and twirls it around.  Molly asks how Carly knew that she needed that.  She looks at Donna and tells her that she didn't have enough time to do the laundry.  With all that done, Molly tells Carly and Donna that it is time for some chocolate.  Carly says, \"A chocolate sundae!\"  Donna tells them that they can't eat ice cream the night before the wedding; they won't fit into their dresses.  Carly tells Donna that it won't affect Molly and Donna says that she will stay with the girls and the two cousins go out the door giggling all the way.  \n\n\nAt Carly's apartment, Jake goes to the refrigerator and takes out a juice box.  He asks if this is what Carly calls a stocked fridge.  He takes a few sips of his juice and there is a knock at the door.  When he opens the door, Hal is there with a toy police car in his hand.  Jake takes the toy and asks Hal how he knew that he needed this.  Hal takes it back and tells him that Parker doesn't know how to share yet.  He asks Jake why is he at Carly's apartment and Jake tells him about getting booted out of his home because he is getting married tomorrow.  Hal and Jake sit together on the couch and talk about the pains of having women in their lives.  Hal asks Jake if he likes it and Jake replies, \"I love it!\"  Hal tells Jake that he doesn't think that he will be coming to the wedding tomorrow.  Jake asks why and Hal tells him that he is seeing Emily and he knows that she won't be accepted at the wedding.  Jake tells Hal to bring Emily and he will make sure that he covers it with Molly.  Hal thanks him and leaves.  After he is gone, Jake says to himself that he needs human contact.  He adds, \"I need Al's diner!\"  Jake runs out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him.\n\n\nJennifer and Abigail go to the rooftop where they had watched the fireworks on the Fourth of July.  Jennifer tells Abigail that \"it\" had happened.  Abigail's mouth drops open and the only thing she can think of to say is, \"How was it?\"  They both laugh and Jennifer tells her that it was amazing.  Abigail says that she and Adam are still holding hands but she had done it.  Adam walks in and asks Jennifer what has she done.  When the girls start to giggle, Adam realizes and asks if she has told their father.  Jennifer tells him that she doesn't think that is the type of thing a girl tells her father, but she thinks he knows something is up.  Bryant and Billy walk in and Adam sees his cousin and says, \"Billy!\"  Jennifer twirls her head around and sees Billy and Bryant.  Bryant gives Jennifer a peck on the cheek and Adam reads between the lines.  Bryant asks Billy if he saw the view and the two cousins walk over to the wall to have a look.  Adam looks at Abigail and makes a motion toward Billy and then to Jennifer.  Abigail gets it and when Adam walks over to his cousins, Abigail leans in to Jennifer and asks if it was Billy that she was with.  Jennifer explains that she had broken up with Bryant and then Billy was there and everything got out of control and she just let it happen.  She tells Abigail that after that, Bryant had come back and explained a lot and they decided to be together again.  Abigail looks at Billy and says, \"Well, he is cute.\"  Jennifer says that she knows.  She tells Abigail that it has to be over because Bryant had come back to her and told her everything that he was giving up and that he would do anything for them to be together.  Bryant walks over to the girls and asks what they are whispering about.  Abigail covers and says that they were talking about wedding stuff.  Adam looks at Billy and asks what it was he was thinking about.  Billy says that he knows it was wrong but he never felt like this before.  Adam tells him that the best thing for him to do is finish Bryant's deck and then leave.  \n\n\nWhen Simon gets back into town, he goes straight to Craig's hotel suite.
