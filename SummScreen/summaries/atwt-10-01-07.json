Sofie asks why she was talking to Cole. Gwen explains that she was trying to help him with his music and give him another chance since their baby was family. Cole shows up- Sofie says that she was worried about him, but he tells her that she should be worried about herself since she was the one having a baby. He tells her that if it's a baby that she wants, it's a baby that she'll get. Sofie beams with happiness. She tells Cole how happy she is that he has changed his mind. Cole then asks her how they were going to pay for this child and doubts that they can afford it on the tips she makes. Gwen, now getting involved tells him that maybe if he got a job they could do it. Cole said that it wouldn't be fair to the baby to grow up like they did, not knowing where their next meal was coming from. Cole asks Sofie what made her change her mind and wants to know who else she told besides Gwen. He asks if Aaron know. Gwen tells Cole to stop being that way, but Sofie angrily tells Gwen to stop and that she needed to talk to Cole alone. Cole told her that she was wrong to keep the pregnancy from him and that maybe he didn't really know her at all. He told her that maybe she was a two-faced liar and storms out. Sofie runs after him apologizing. She tells him that she must get back to work, but Cole becomes more upset. He yells at her and throws a tray on the floor before leaving as Sofie's boss looks on.  She starts to clean the mess and explain, but he fires her. \n\n\n\n\n\nAt home Carly is watching her video messages when she is interrupted by Brad who tries to lighten the mood. She tells Brad how she misses Jack, but she doesn't want to bother him and Katie. Brad tells her that Jack wants her to lean on him- that if she doesn't he will feel guilty. Carly tells Brad that Jack has nothing to feel guilty about; he gave her a wonderful life. Brad tells Carly that instead of videotaping her feelings she should tell him. Carly tells Brad that she cannot spend her last days with Jack- it's too painful. They talk a little longer and he leaves. She then gets a phone call from the hospital with news and they insist that she come in right away. As she is getting ready to leave, her phone rings. She pauses for a second, but decides not to answer it. She grabs her keys and leaves. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview Katie is still in bed as Jack gets dressed. He kisses her waking her up. She asks why he is dressed, assuming he is going to Carly. He tells her that they are going house shopping. Katie is very excited about looking for a house, while she is getting dressed Jack calls Carly, but she doesn't answer the phone. Katie comes back out and asks who he is calling. He said he was trying to check in on Carly, but she wasn't answering the house phone. Katie suggests calling her cell, which he does. Carly tells Jack that she is meeting with an oncologist that Dr. Evers referred her to, and that she will be there for several hours for tests. Jack is alarmed, but Carly tells him to not worry; she will be fine. \n\n\nKatie tells Jack that if he wants to go check on Carly, they can look at the house later, but Jack worries that they might miss out on a good deal. He then tells her go without him; if she likes the house to buy it. He tells her he will check on Carly and meet her there. Katie agrees and Jack leaves. Katie is confident she can do this, but while in Old Town waiting to meet the realtor she begins to doubt herself. Brad sees her and joins her. She tells him that she doesn't know how to buy a house- Brad offers to help, but Katie worries that she won't know if Jack will like the house. She agrees and takes Brad with her. At the house, she tells Brad that the house is perfect; but she is having a hard time imagining the house being theirs. Brad tells her to pretend she is cooking- and he pretends he just got home from work. They continue role-playing, but Katie becomes sad again, wishing that Jack was there. She thanks him for trying to help, but without Jack it just won't work. He tells her that he thinks Jack would like the house and leaves her alone to her thoughts. Katie remembers Jack talking about having a baby and she starts crying.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Carly's doctor tells her that the treatments will be very debilitating and that she should not be alone, but Carly told her that she wants to do this on her own. \n\n\nJack arrives at the hospital, Carly tells him that he didn't need to come and if it was ok with Katie. Jack assured her that Katie was fine with it and he wants to be there. The Doctor met them and was pleased to see that someone was there with Carly. She explained to them that the chemotherapy treatments were palliative and would not cure her. If the treatments are successful it will buy her more time and lessen the pain but if the side effects are very serious. Jack told the Doctor that he will be there for Carly whenever she needs him. She tells Carly they will start treatments as soon as they can get her in and she leaves. Carly tells Jack that she doesn't want her hair to fall out, but Jack tells her that with or without her hair he and the kids think that she is beautiful. Carly wants to take a cab home, but Jack insists that he drive her. \n\n\nGwen shows up at Carly's house just as Jack is leaving. She asks Carly if they had had a fight. Carly told her that she was fighting, but he was just being Jack. Gwen happily tells Carly about her fertility treatments and that next year Carly will hopefully be an aunt. Gwen then sees a chemotherapy information pamphlet on the coffee table- she asks Carly why she was reading that. Carly is vague, telling her that she just had this \"thing\". Gwen wants to know that she will be ok, but Carly shakes her head. Gwen is shocked and tells her how unfair this is since she lost so much time with her already. Carly tells her she is not gone yet and plans on spending as much time as she can with the people she loves, including her. Gwen asked her if now that Jack knows if they are back together. Carly told her that Jack is with Katie, but she now feels closer to Jack than she ever did.\n\n\nJack arrived at the house. Thinking that he missed her he curses, but Katie appears around the corner; \"What, you don't like it?\"  She tells him that she is glad he is home and they embrace. Katie told Jack that she loves the house, but if he wants to wait that's ok. He told her that he was ready to start a home with her right now. They kiss and lower to the floor.  \n\n\nIn Old Town Craig remembers Meg's words that she will not stand by him if it is revealed that he did cause Rosanna's accident. Meg shows up to accompany him to court-but he tells her not to go. He tells her to grant him this one request and that if she is hoping to hear Rosanna testify about the accident, he is sticking to his story. Meg told him that she needs to hear it from Rosanna and decide for herself; if he can't understand this, they don't have a marriage. Craig agrees and they leave.  \n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Rosanna watches the video of Paul and Meg on the cell phone.  Craig's words run through her mind; that if he is jailed, Meg and Paul will be together. She puts the phone in her purse as Paul comes in ready to leave for court. He happily hugs her but she looks uncertain. He tells her that once she testifies against Craig, he will be out of their lives forever. He leaves to get the car. Rosanna retrieves the phone and throws it in the trash.\n\n\nBefore entering the courthouse Rosanna wants some water and Paul leaves to get it. Nearby, Craig is telling Meg that he must meet must meet briefly with his lawyer, so Meg goes inside. Alone together for the moment, Craig asks Rosanna if she has thought about what he told her. She tells him that she had come to a realization. He gleefully tells her that she can't trust her fianc\u00e9 and that he told her so, but Rosanna told him she now realizes that Paul loves her; and only her. She walks to a waiting Paul and they go into the court room. \n\n\nThe trial begins and Rosanna is called to testify. Craig's attorney remarks on how confident Rosanna looks and that he should have accepted the plea-bargain. \n\n\nAt the trial, Rosanna testifies to Craig's involvement in switching the babies. Her lawyer asked her what she had discovered but she paused and told the judge that she was unsure. She said that she was confused about what happened that night. Paul stood up and shouted that she knew what happened and told her to tell them. She said that she wanted to, but couldn't remember. Meg looks on suspiciously as Craig beams. Barbara bursts out that Rosanna is lying. The judge calls for order in the court. Rosanna explains to the judge that since she was in a coma for 2 years, she sometimes cannot distinguish between what was real and what was a dream. The judge starts to dismiss the case, but Paul tells him to wait. He pleads with Rosanna to not let Craig get away with this. Rosanna's lawyer asks that Paul be allowed to testify to what he knows about the case, but the judge doesn't allow it and dismisses the case. As Meg listens, Craig's lawyer tells him that his instincts were dead on. Craig tells her that he knows Rosanna well and knew the stress would be too much for her.\n\n\n Rosanna tells Paul that she doesn't know what happened, that her mind suddenly went blank. Barbara attacked Rosanna and told her that she had betrayed Paul. Paul stopped his mother's tirade and he and Rosanna started to leave. They passed Meg, and she and Rosanna exchanged looks. Craig gloated to Barbara, who warned Meg to get away from him. \n\n\nCraig and Meg arrive at the Lakeview. He is in festive mood and orders champagne. Meg remarks on his good spirits, which he told her \"...I won!\"  She told him that it was interesting, because he knew he would. As they drink the champagne, she asks him if he cheated. She points out Rosanna's sudden memory loss, and wants to know how he made that happen. \n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Paul angrily makes a drink. Rosanna apologizes- but he tells her that she did that already. She asks if he believes her; is there is any reason I shouldn't? He said. Rosanna tells him that she wanted to put Craig away- but Paul said that she shouldn't have lied.  \n\n\n",
