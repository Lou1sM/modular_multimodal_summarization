Brian called Luke and asked him to come to Metro for a foundation meeting, so Luke took Noah along. \n\n\nLiberty noticed her mother's depression and said she hated to see Janet so sad. Janet was doing laundry, even Brad's, to keep from missing Jack. She explained to Liberty that she was discouraged because Carly was in Jack's blood and he would never be rid of her. \n\n\nAt the hospital on the island, Carly helped Jack eat his breakfast. He wanted to know the details of James's death, but Carly reminded him that he was no longer a policeman so he was not entitled to know the inside story. Jack took off his hospital gown and put on his own clothes, and he and Carly shared a tender moment as she helped him button his shirt. He told her how much he appreciated how she always seemed to know when he needed help and stepped up. He suggested they stop fighting their connection and just go with it. Carly understood what he was saying and tried to convince him it was not love he was feeling, but gratitude. Nevertheless he professed his love for her, while Carly said that loving him was like breathing for her. She was afraid, however, that she was not what he needed anymore. A nurse interrupted them, and Carly left to make a phone call. \n\n\nMeg talked with Dusty at Swans Down Cottage after he was released from the hospital. He told Meg he was not going to press charges against Paul for the shooting, and Meg told him that Barbara had promised not to reveal to anyone that Dusty was still alive, because it might jeopardize his search for Johnny. Holden barged in looking for his sister and was stunned to find her with Dusty. Dusty asked Holden to keep mum about his reappearance, but Holden was furious and accused Dusty of ruining his marriage. Meg defended Dusty, but Holden maintained he owed Dusty nothing, including his silence. Dusty made a phone call and found out the investigation into James's death was closed. Holden inquired who shot Dusty, and Meg told him it was Paul. Holden left, but not before he threatened Dusty to stay away from Lily. \n\n\nMike surprised Lily at her house and told her goodbye. He had decided to go back to Europe and work with Neal. Lily felt as if she were running him out of town, but Mike told her she was doing the right thing by reuniting with Holden. Lily said she would miss Mike, and the two of them hugged just as Lucinda and Brian walked in, unannounced. Lucinda misinterpreted the situation, but her mood changed when she learned Mike was leaving town. After Mike left, Lucinda questioned Lily about her other problem-Carly. Lily told her mother that Carly knew enough to stay away from Holden. \n\n\nCarly called Janet and told her Jack was in the hospital on the island, and suggested Janet come up and take her place. Janet packed like a whirlwind and left immediately. Carly went to the boat dock to get back to the mainland, and Holden ended up there also. He explained that he had come to see that Meg was all right, and Carly told him she had been with Jack when he had gotten hurt. Janet arrived and asked Carly if she were crazy to try again with Jack. \n\n\nMeg asked Dusty what his plans were, and he said he would go back to Asia to try to pick up the trail on Johnny. He was concerned that Paul would not be a good husband and father, so he gave Meg the phone number for an Ed Suzuki, a private investigator in San Francisco, who was the only person who knew how to reach him. Meg left and went to the boat dock, and accompanied Holden and Carly back to Oakdale. They took her to Fairwinds, but Meg was determined to check on Paul, so she left for Memorial Hospital, where Paul was confined after a breakdown. Holden asked Carly if she was having second thoughts about calling Janet, and she shared with him the special moment she and Jack had experienced in the hospital room. Holden offered to give her a ride home, but she preferred to be dropped at Metro instead, and promised him a drink there. \n\n\nWhen Jack woke up, Janet was by his bedside. She brought him shirts, games, snacks, magazines, none of which interested Jack. Janet realized she should not have come and that Jack was thinking only of Carly. She attempted to leave, but Jack yelled at her to stop and tried to tell her he was really happy to have her there. \n\n\nLucinda, Brian, Lily, Noah, and Luke met at Metro to plan a benefit for their foundation. Henry had agreed to let them rent the club for a nominal fee, and the event was named \"Green Up,\" and would be an eco-friendly project that would tear down old housing space and replace it with a green area for public use. Carly and Holden walked in, and Lily overreacted. She immediately asked Carly if she had not made herself clear about Carly's staying away from Holden. Luke and Noah made a hasty exit to go talk to Kim about having WOAK make a donation for the benefit. Holden explained that Meg had been kidnapped by Stenbeck, and he suggested he take Lily home so they could talk in private. At home, Lily apologized for her knee-jerk reaction to seeing Carly and Holden come in together. Holden brought up Lily's affair with Dusty again, and that puzzled her. \n\n\nAt Memorial, Meg questioned why Paul was on such a heavy dose of sedative and expressed interest in taking him home as soon as possible. \n\n\nBack at Metro, Lucinda introduced Carly to Brian, and then told Carly that on the night of the benefit Carly should perhaps put her charitable efforts to use somewhere else in Oakdale. Carly told Lucinda to go to hell, and Lucinda then explained to Brian the story about Carly and Holden and why she disliked Carly so much. \n\n\nAt the cottage, a Nathan Jolley arrived from the island's funeral home, seeking a Mr. Dusty Donovan. Dusty asked why he wanted Mr. Donovan, and Jolley explained that he wanted to know what Mr. Donovan wanted done with the remains of James Stenbeck. Dusty said that Donovan was dead and suggested he ask Stenbeck's son, or else stuff Stenbeck in a tin can and kick him down the beach. As soon as the funeral director left, Dusty called someone and asked for the first flight out of there. \n\n\n",
