Barbara said what she wanted was an explanation for his goofy behavior, but then the elevator arrived.  Henry talked fast and pulled Barbara inside with him, and just as the door was closing, Maddie walked up and saw her brother and Barbara arguing.\n\n\nBack at the table, Vienna worried about Henry's stomach, and she wanted to check on him.  Audrey tried to stall her, but Ralph, who was unaware of the Barbara maneuver, gave Vienna permission to go as soon as she handed over the check for the charity.  Vienna stood up but was hesitant to part with the check, so Audrey got more forceful in her request.  Just then Maddie walked up and asked Vienna why she had just seen her brother forcing Barbara Ryan into an elevator.  Ralph asked who the \"delightful creature\" was, and Audrey introduced her daughter.\n\n\nMaddie gave Audrey's unctuous greeting a cold reception, and Vienna said she needed to go find Henry.  Audrey again reminded her about the check, so Vienna opened her purse, but Maddie stopped her.  Maddie asked her mother what kind of scam she was trying to pull, but Audrey immediately jumped up and wondered aloud why Maddie was always so suspicious.  Maddie asked about the check Vienna was holding, and her mother explained that the always-generous Henry was donating all his Stenbeck inheritance to charity.  Maddie warned Vienna that her mother was a first class con artist, so Vienna stuck the check in her bra and departed to find Henry.  Maddie bid her mother adieu and said she was glad to see that \"Mom\" had not changed.\n\n\nIn Barbara's room, Henry locked the door, and that set Barbara off.  Henry said they needed to sit down, and when he did so, he sat on the \"Bullfrog\" adult toy that he had originally bought for him and Vienna.  He held up the croaker for an explanation, and Barbara said that she had bought it for a bachelorette party for a friend.  She snatched the frog away and demanded to know what was going on.  Henry said that Barbara could stop denying the chemistry between the two of them.\n\n\nBarbara asked how many martinis Henry had already had that morning, but he claimed he was \"stone cold sober.\"  He said he just couldn't help himself when he looked at Barbara, and he moved closer.  He said he wanted only her, and he made his move, but Barbara eluded him.  They ran around the room with Henry shouting how Barbara \"charged the air with electricity.\"  Barbara finally stopped and told him that he was making a fool of himself and he had to go.\n\n\nHenry grabbed Barbara and bent her over backwards and planted a big kiss on her lips.  Vienna knocked on the door and called out to Henry at that moment, so Henry let Barbara back up.  He told her to fix her hair, and he answered the door.  He told Vienna that he and Barbara had reached an agreement about James's inheritance.  Barbara asked them both to leave, so Henry escorted Vienna out, telling her that he would be giving the entire inheritance to charity.  When he picked up his suit coat, he also pilfered the Bullfrog. Vienna was ecstatic and gave Henry a big hug.  She felt the Bullfrog in his coat, so he pulled it out and the two of them hurried back to their room.\n\n\nAudrey tried to stall Ralph longer by chatting incessantly , but he finally told her to look at him and be quiet. He warned her to keep up her end of the bargain, and he reminded her how displeased he got when thing didn't go his way.  A somber Ralph left the table.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna were under the covers amidst loud frog croaks when Henry's phone rang.  He swore, but he answered it.  The caller was Barbara, who said they needed to get something straight.  She told him to forget about seducing her as a means to an end, because Paul deserved half of James's fortune.  She warned Henry that any more stunts would have no effect on her.\n\n\nHenry and Vienna fell back asleep until knocking woke them.  Henry got up and stepped out into the hall when he saw his mother.  Audrey demanded the check, but Henry said that Vienna would be upset.  When Henry learned that Maddie was in town and had been bad-mouthing Audrey in front of Ralph, he took that as a sign that they were in way over their heads.  Audrey was worried that they would both end up on the bottom of the river.\n\n\nMaddie was in Java, and she called Casey and left him a message.  Hunter was standing at the counter staring at her, and when Maddie challenged him, he said he had been looking at her phone.  He identified it as a \"Raspberry 350,\" and he said he had been considering getting one.  Maddie said she loved hers, and she touted all its wild applications.  Margo entered Java and interrupted them, and she asked to speak with Maddie.  Hunter excused himself and took another long look at Maddie and declared that she had \"some nice software.\"\n\n\nMargo sat down and asked the girl if she had any idea why Adam had left town.  Maddie said that she didn't have a clue.  Margo then asked why Maddie had been so late to the court hearing, and Maddie lied that she had been \"nervous.\"  Margo asked if she had experienced second thoughts, but Maddie's response was vague.  The detective in Margo said that she knew Maddie was not being forthright, but Maddie said she was not the one who could answer those questions.  Margo correctly surmised that that person was Casey, so a dejected Margo got up and left.\n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Casey approached Alison and asked for a minute.  Alison tried to put him off, but Casey wanted to \"talk out\" their problems. He said that Adam had been getting between them, but since his brother was gone, that was no longer an issue.  Alison said that Adam was not the reason she had broken up with Casey; Casey, himself, was.  Alison was angry that Casey had forced his own brother to leave town by making \"a deal.\"  She accused him of using Maddie and her testimony to get Adam to do what Casey wanted.  She was also hurt that Casey had lied to her and obviously did not fully trust her.\n\n\nAlison was sad that she and Casey were never going to see what had happened the same way.  She tried to leave, but Casey grabbed her arm, and Alison struggled.  Hunter happened to walk by, and he made Casey back off.  Alison was afraid for her job if the two of them made a scene, but just then Casey took a hike in his usual manner.  Alison told Hunter that she and Casey had broken up, and she began to cry.  She talked a bit more with Hunter, who told his little sister that it was Casey who blew the relationship.  Alison gave Hunter a hug.\n\n\nCasey went home, and Margo arrived soon afterward.  She said that she knew something was wrong, and she agonized that her first born had gone away again because of her baby.  She asked Casey if he was the reason that Adam had left, and Casey admitted that he was.  Margo angrily said that Casey had no right to take her child away from her, but Casey defended his actions.  Margo really believed that  Gwen and Maddie had traumatized Adam in the woods, and he was not in control of his feelings or actions.  Casey said that Adam was eager enough, however, to make the deal for Maddie's testimony.\n\n\nMargo said that Casey was so mired in his anger and jealousy that it was ugly.  Casey whined that Alison had broken up with him because he had made Adam leave, and his mother yelled that Casey should grow up and stop using Adam as his excuse for not getting on with his life.  Tom walked in on the shouting match, and Margo told him that Casey did not care how much he had hurt the family.  Casey dashed out the door, so Tom sat with Margo and reminded her that Adam was not \"owed forgiveness\" by anyone.  He said that Casey had to be really hurting to go to such extreme measures to get Adam out of his life.  Tom said that Margo had another son who needed her.\n\n\nCasey talked with Maddie at Java and said that he had told Margo the truth.  He felt that the only thing that he had done wrong was to give Adam a free pass.  Casey felt that Maddie was the only one in his corner, and she promised to be there always.  Maddie left, but Casey followed her out and thanked her for listening to him.  Maddie reached out and kissed him on the lips, as Hunter watched from behind a pillar.  Casey took Maddie's hand and led her away.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Tom spoke with Alison and asked if she had any idea where Adam might have gone.  She shut him off and asked Tom to leave her alone.\n\n\n",
