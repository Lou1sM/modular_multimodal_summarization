    "soap_central": "\n\nJake & Molly's Wedding Day at Lucinda's Mansion:\n\nMitzy told Jack that there was a dead body in the guesthouse.  Jack and Mitzy walked in the guesthouse and saw a body on the floor.  Jack felt his wrist and said he was still alive.  The guy woke up and asked where he was.  Jack told him he was in Lucinda's guesthouse and asked who he was.  He said his name was Harvey.  Since there was an empty bottle of booze on the floor next to him, Jack thought that the guy drank too much and passed out.  Jack was still suspicious though and said he wanted to check it out further.  Officer Slocomb came to help Jack.  He told Harvey that the officer was going to take him to Memorial hospital to get a check up.  Jack whispered to the officer to be sure to get a blood work-up and a Breathalyzer test.  Mitzy asked Jack what they were going to do now.  Jack told her that Harvey could be a drunk or could have been KO'd by the guy with the ponytail.  She asked if he was going to stop the wedding.  Jack said he hoped not, but admitted there may be no other way. \n\n\nDante was hiding behind a doorway when he saw that Simon and Katie were coming inside by the side door.  Simon told Katie that Craig told him that she was happy and starry eyed being with Bruno.  He asked if it was true.  Before she could say anything, Bruno walked in and said that Katie was as happy as a clam.  Katie told Bruno that Simon was still her husband and she had the right to talk to him.  Bruno told her to go ahead and talk, as long as it's \"goodbye.\"  He told Simon that he and Katie had a wedding to attend to.  As Bruno led her out of the room, Katie looked over her shoulder and mouthed the words \"don't leave\" to Simon.  \n\n\nKatie told Bruno it was nice knowing him but her husband was back now.  He said the marriage that she and Simon have was nothing but the agreement that they have means everything.  She promised to pay back the quarter million that he bailed her out of jail with.  She tried to tell him that there were plenty of girls out there that would really appreciate what he had to offer.  He said he's had a lot of girls but there weren't her, that she was his unattainable little object.  She said that she didn't think it would cut the ice with her husband.  He said it wasn't a problem and that he would have a nice long talk with Simon.  \n\n\nSimon was waiting for Katie in the house when she showed up.  She told him they only had a minute that Bruno was at the bar and would be looking for her.  She asked him to tell her again that he came back for her.  He admitted that he did and that when he got to Tahiti that he found that everything was boring without her.  She was happy to hear that but was angry that he didn't realize it sooner before everything got messed up with Bruno.  She began kissing Simon when Bruno walked in.  He asked if the kiss for Simon was a good by kiss. Simon said it wasn't.  Katie was afraid of what Bruno would do to Simon and told him that she was with Bruno now and walked out of the house with him.  Simon couldn't believe what Katie was saying.  \n\n\nAfter Simon left the room, Luke, Curtis and Will ran in and started playing games.  Holden found Luke playing with Curtis and Will.  When Holden told Luke to come and watch the wedding ceremony, he begged to stay and play games with the other boys.  Holden said he could but to not go anywhere without letting him and Lily know.  Luke promised.  Dante was still hiding and listening to what was being said.  As the three boys played games, Dante watched.  Curtis said he couldn't concentrate on the game with all the people around.  Luke said he knew of a place where no one would bother them.  Curtis asked about him having to tell his dad where he was going if he left the house.  Luke was afraid if he asked Holden, he would make him stay and watch the wedding.  He told Curtis he would tell Holden later.  When they left, Dante started to follow, but he heard Lucinda talking and got back to his hiding place. \n\n\nMolly walked down the isle while Jake smiled with delight.  Paul said to Rose that Molly's gown was amazing.  Rose was miffed and said that the gown on the girl next to him (meaning herself) was great too.  Paul ignored what she said which didn't make Rose happy.  Rose told Paul she cried at weddings.  Paul still ignored her and only had interest in the wedding dresses.  He asked Rose if she could find out who designed them.  She got disgusted with Paul and got up and changed seats.  She sat in front of Nancy who remarked how lovely her dress was.  Rose told her she was glad that someone noticed and glared at Paul.  \n\n\nLucinda wasn't happy that Jack called her away and said that she was missing the ceremony.  Jack told her about one of the catering people being passed out in the guesthouse.  Lucinda said \"so what\", until Jack mentioned that Mitzy saw someone with a pony tail and an Italian accent earlier.  Lucinda realized it could be Dante.  Lucinda wanted to announce that fact to the guests but Jack told her not to upset them until they knew for sure.  He wanted her to round up all the staff members to make sure there were no impostors.  As they went outside, Dante began taking off his tie.  Mitzy and Jack began looking for Dante.  They saw one waiter with a ponytail and asked Lucinda if she recognized him.  She said it wasn't Dante and wanted to announce that he was around somewhere and wanted to warn everyone.  Jack still wanted to keep it under wraps.  \n\n\nThe minister said that this was a special day for Molly and Jake and that they would start by having Abigail sing a special song for them.  After Abigail was done singing her song, she hugged both Molly and Jake.  Jake and Molly were going to say their own vows, but first they had words to say to their family.  Jake said special words to Abigail and then Molly said special words to Donna and Marley.  Then standing alone, Jake and Molly said their vows to each other.  The minister then told them to look at him as he began the wedding ceremony.  He then pronounced them Husband and Wife.  As Molly and Jake were kissing, Carly and Isaac were standing by watching.  Isaac told them that they had a receiving line waiting for them.  \n\n\nJennifer told Billy that she didn't expect to see him there.  Billy told her that he was leaving as soon as he told his relatives goodbye.  Nick had been filming the wedding ceremony and all the guests when he walked up to Jennifer and Billy talking.  He thought they were a couple and asked them to kiss for the film.  Bryant walked up and Billy said he had to leave and left Jennifer and Bryant alone.  Abigail and Adam walked up to talk to Jennifer and Bryant and offered them some hors d'oeuvres.  Adam asked where Billy was.  Jennifer said she had a headache and went to find an aspirin.  Bryant went after her.  Adam told Abigail that her singing voice was fantastic.  As he started to kiss her, Nick showed up with the camera and wanted to film them kissing.  Adam was upset and walked away.  Nick started to leave but Abigail suggested he take a break.  \n\n\nJennifer ran into the house and sat down on the couch.  Bryant ran in after her to see if she was OK.  She told him she just needed some time alone away from the crowd.  Bryant left and shortly after Billy showed up.\n\n\nPaul stopped Rose as she was walking by and apologized for ignoring her.  He said he was preoccupied with the BRO business and he was so sorry that he didn't even tell her how beautiful she was in her dress.  She told him he could tell her again.  He said he'd get some champagne and toast her.  Paul brought the champagne but when he saw Molly, he put the glasses down on a table and didn't notice that Rose started to walk towards him.  Rose asked Mitzy where she had been all day.  She told her that she was hanging out with Jack Snyder.  Mitzy asked where Paul was.  Rose told her he left for champagne months ago and hadn't returned.  \n\n\nWhen Rose saw Simon, she asked what he was doing there.  She said that she thought that he was still at the South Seas.  He said he probably should have stayed.  She asked if Katie and Bruno were still an item.  He said that Bruno thought so, but Katie wasn't making any sense at all.  When Simon asked if she thought Bruno would be good to Katie, she realized that Simon was really worried about her.  Simon asked Rose to distract Bruno for a few minutes so he could talk to Katie.  \n\n\nBruno asked Katie if she had something on her mind.  She noticed the gun under his jacket and wondered why he had it.  Rose walked up and told Bruno she needed to talk to him.  When they left, Katie looked for Simon.  She spotted him across the room and walked towards him saying for him to stay away from her, that she was with Bruno now and that he was good to her.  Simon was hurt and told her to have a good life and walked away.  \n\n\nEmily asked Lily and Holden where Lucinda's rose garden was.  Hal said that the Intruder had a home section now and that Emily wanted to take some pictures.  Lily said she thought it would be OK, but wondered if they should check on the kids first.  Holden said they were fine, that Luke promised not to go anywhere without checking with them first.  \n\n\nJake and Cass embraced and Cass told him that he was happy that he could make it to the wedding.  Jake said to give Lila and the girls their best.  Cass said to Molly that he was sure that wherever Vicky was; that she was happy that Jake was lucky enough to be with her.  He also said everyone from Bay City wished them well.  \n\n\nLisa told Molly her dress was divine and asked who designed it.  When Molly told her that Carly did, Lisa couldn't believe it.  Ben congratulated Molly and said he loved what she had to say about Jake and the kids.  Bob told Molly that the ceremony was wonderful and that he stayed awake through the whole thing.  Paul walked up and introduced himself to Molly.  She reminded him that they met when she tried to interview him during the trial.  He told her congratulations then asked about her wedding dress.  He said that the dress was amazing and that he wasn't easily impressed.  He asked if Vera Wang or some other famous designers designed it.  She told him to read the label.  He couldn't believe that Carly was the designer and said that she was incredible.  Molly agreed that Carly was incredible and said that Carly also designed the bridesmaid dresses too.  Molly wanted Paul to give Carly a job.  She told him that he owed her for the stunt he pulled with the picture of Carly and Craig at the trial.  \n\n\nCarly asked Jack if anything was wrong.  She said he had a worried look on his face.  He told her he was checking on the security for Lucinda.  She asked if he was staying for the reception.  Before he could answer, Paul walked up and asked if he could talk to Carly for a minute.  At the same time, Lucinda motioned to Jack and he left to see what she wanted.  Carly told Paul that she didn't work for the Intruder so if he wanted to talk to her about that he's wasting his time.  Paul assured her that wasn't why he wanted to talk to her.  He said that Molly told him that she designed the wedding dress.  When she said \"so\", he asked if she would design for BRO.  She brought up the fact that he threw her designs away when she offered them to him earlier.  He admitted that he didn't even look at them, but that by looking at the wedding dresses he could see first hand what a great designer she was.  Carly couldn't believe that he wanted her to design for BRO and asked him if he had too much champagne.  \n\n\nLucinda showed Jack the caterer's uniform that she found in the shrubs.  They smelled chloroform on the jacked and Jack said that Harvey must have been knocked out.  Lucinda wanted to know why Dante would get rid of the uniform.  Jack told her that Dante knew they were on to him posing as a waiter and got rid of it.  Lucinda was upset to know that Dante was there at the wedding.  \n\n\nJake and Molly began to dance to the tune of \"This Guys in Love with You\" as everyone watched.  \n\n\nThe boys ran into the guesthouse with Dante right behind them.  The boys were trying to decide what game to play and decided to play hide and seek.  Curtis and Will ran out the door and when Luke started after them, Dante opened the door.  Dante told Luke that he was a very bad boy.  He said that he just talked to his parents and that they were looking all over for him.  He told Luke to come with him and that he would take him to his parents.\n\n\n",
