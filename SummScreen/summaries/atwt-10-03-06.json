He snuggled with her, but she balked, interpreting the disaster as a warning from a higher power not to get busy. Carly tried to be upbeat about the project, but he revealed that he was broke. Simon was sure Carly could bounce back and showed her pictures for her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She wept that her career and marriage had gone up in smoke. They snuggled together under a blanket to get some sleep.\n\n\nPaul comforted Emily, who cooed over the dead body of their daughter. Jack arrived and was able to take Emily and her child to the hospital. Jack comforted Meg and asked about Carly, but Meg didn't know anything. She felt guilty for not saving the baby. Then, Jack got a call from Margo that Simon's building was damaged.\n\n\nJack made his way inside the building and was dismayed to surprise Simon and Carly together on the couch. Carly thanked him and asked about the kids. She said she hadn't gotten trapped on purpose. Jack tried to usher them out, but Simon said he would take Carly home. After Jack and the firefighters left, Simon needled her. She suggested they rise from the ashes -- \"literally\" -- and show the world they had it going on. Carly vowed to find more money for another project.\n\n\nHolden explained to Lily that she had been in a coma, and memory loss was normal. However, she didn't even remember being pregnant. Lucinda arrived to comfort her. Holden fetched little Ethan, and they bonded. Later, Holden took in Faith and Natalie, as well as Luke. Alone with Holden, Luke feared that Lily would remember that he was the reason she'd fallen. Holden assured him she would understand. Surrounded by all her family, Lily was grateful to be back. Suddenly, a vision of Rose appeared and admonished her to take a head count; somebody was missing.\n\n\nIn her room, Emily was inconsolable, but Paul tried. When Meg appeared, Emily shrieked, \"You killed my baby!\" Paul defended Meg, and Susan arrived to comfort Emily. Meg vowed to stick by Paul then get married and have their own family.\n\n\nSeeing Craig holding Johnny, Dusty hissed, \"Give me my son, or I'll kill you.\" Lucy revealed that Craig was the masked man who had saved her and Johnny on the road. Dusty sniped at Lucy for defending her father and threatened to call the cops. \"I'm the natural father,\" Craig pointed out, adding that he was a free man because his case had been overturned on appeal.\n\n\nLucy kept Dusty from pummeling Craig but scolded her father, so Craig assumed they were back together. Dusty reminded Craig about the court order keeping him away from Johnny. Craig told Lucy he was here to put things right with her. He blamed Dusty and Paul for tricking him, but he was motivated by hope, not revenge. Lucy told Dusty she hadn't known Craig was back, but he asked her, since she did, what she would do.\n\n\nIn the chapel, Paul lit a candle and asked God if he was being punished for taking Johnny away from Jennifer. If so, God should tell her Paul was sorry. Then Paul said God should have stopped that night's tragedy. \"I'm punished,\" he confessed. Craig rolled up to marvel at the sight of Paul on his knees.\n\n\n",
