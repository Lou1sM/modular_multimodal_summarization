    "soap_central": "\n\nEmily showed up at Tom and Margo's house looking for Casey, but Margo told her Casey didn't want to talk to her again. Margo said Casey had told her about Emily having her tubes tied, and she said what Emily had done showed how selfish Emily was. Emily said one day, Casey would understand that Emily had done the right thing. Margo replied that Casey understood that Emily was no good for him, and actually, Emily was no good for anyone. Emily told Margo the upside to the situation was that Emily no longer had to take such judgmental talk from Margo. Emily stormed off after telling Margo to \"stick it where the sun don't shine!\" \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Lucinda toasted Brian Wheatley for coming up with a way to save the Snyder property, through a benefit for \"Project Green Up.\" Lily interrupted and angrily told Lucinda to stop meddling in her life. Lily said Lucinda had no right to tell Carly not to attend the benefit at Metro, since it was Carly's nightclub. Brian reminded Lily that all mothers wanted to protect their children. Lily softened somewhat, but pointedly told them, \"See you both at the party tonight ... at Carly's club.\" \n\n\nMeg went to Holden and Lily's home to tell Holden she was upset because Margo had insisted that Meg knew who had been shot at the lighthouse. Meg believed Margo would keep pressing her for information, and Meg didn't want to reveal that Dusty was alive. Holden tried to convince his pregnant sister that she couldn't risk going to jail for Dusty's sake. \n\n\nLily walked in and asked them what was going on. Meg told Lily she was upset about not being allowed to visit Paul at the hospital. Lily offered her sympathy, and Meg left. Holden told Lily he had to take some brochures to Metro before the party started; Lily told him to go ahead, but she had to finish getting ready for the benefit. \n\n\nWhen Holden arrived at Metro, Carly was there, putting together gift bags for the guests. Holden complimented her on how she looked, but Carly warned him not to say anything that might bring on another lecture from Lily. Carly said maybe Lucinda had been right and she should leave for the night, but Holden said Carly had every right to be there. Lily walked in and told Carly she agreed with Holden, and she thanked Carly for agreeing to have the benefit at Metro. Lucinda came in with Brian and immediately confronted Carly about her presence at the benefit. Carly excused herself, and Lily warned her mother not to make a scene. \n\n\nMeg arrived at Metro and was dismayed to see Margo there. Margo told Meg she hoped Meg would make a statement about what had happened at the lighthouse. Meg asked if Margo intended to harass her all night, and Emily walked in and said Margo wasn't happy unless she was making someone miserable. Margo told Meg she would wait on the other side of the room, in case Meg changed her mind. Emily asked Meg what she had done to get on Margo's bad side, but Meg said it was nothing. Emily said she had heard that Paul had \"flipped out\" when his father was killed, but Meg said she didn't want to discuss it. \n\n\nJack took Janet's dress to her at Brad and Katie's house and told her Carly had dropped it off at the farm by mistake. Janet, wearing a facial mask and with curlers in her hair, was embarrassed for Jack to see her, but they both laughed about it and talked about how strange it was that Carly kept trying to fix them up. They arrived at Metro in time to hear Lily and Holden welcome the guests to the party. Lucinda then took the stage and surprised Holden and Lily by announcing that the board of directors at Worldwide had decided to sell the land they'd been planning to develop back to Emma for one dollar, and any funds raised at the benefit would therefore go to decontaminating the land and converting it into a nature preserve and a public park. Lily thanked Lucinda, but Lucinda said it had all been Brian's doing. \n\n\nHolden introduced Will Dailey as the entertainment for the evening. Lily asked Carly if she needed any help, and Carly said she had planned to offer a tray of free champagne to the guests to help get them to open their pocketbooks and donate money to the cause. Lily took the tray and began offering the champagne to people. She approached a man standing at the bar and asked if he would like a glass; when he turned to face her, Lily saw that it was Dusty. Dusty said, \"Hey, Lily,\" and Lily dropped the tray, shocked by Dusty's resurrection from the dead. \n\n\nDusty apologized for having shown up so unexpectedly. Lucinda muttered, \"He's not supposed to be here.\" Dusty told Lily he was there to speak to Margo because he had heard she had some questions about what had happened when James Stenbeck was killed. Margo asked if Dusty had been there. Dusty admitted he had, and he told Margo he'd been shot when Paul's gun had gone off during the struggle with James. \n\n\nDusty said Meg hadn't done anything wrong, and if Margo needed to arrest someone, she should arrest him. Margo agreed that was a good idea. Jack asked if Margo needed any help, but Margo told him to stay and enjoy the party. Jack told Janet he was having trouble remembering he wasn't a cop anymore. He said he didn't want to talk about it and asked if they could leave; Janet agreed, and they went back to Brad and Katie's house. \n\n\nLily said she thought she should go with Dusty, but Lucinda told her absolutely not. Lily replied that she had already told Lucinda not to tell her what to do, and Holden told Lucinda he would handle the situation. Lucinda and Brian left, and Holden told Lily that Margo would find out what had happened with Dusty and fill them in later. Later, however, Lily overheard Holden talking to Meg and realized that Holden had known Dusty was alive. She asked why he hadn't told her. Meg said Dusty had asked them not to tell anyone he was alive, but Holden admitted he hadn't told Lily because he hadn't wanted Dusty to come between them again. He asked Lily to forgive him, but she said she didn't know if she could. \n\n\nHolden requested a song from Will Dailey, about having a broken heart, which Will announced was a dedication from Holden Snyder to his wife. Lily relented and danced with Holden, but she thought of Dusty as they danced. \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo listed the many things she could charge Dusty with, from perpetrating a fraud to obstructing several police investigations. She demanded to know how Dusty had managed to fake his own death. Dusty said he had substituted a designer drug for the vial that Evan Walsh had used to inject him, so that instead of receiving a lethal drug, he received one that stopped his heart and put him into a deep coma. Margo wanted to know who had helped Dusty, but Dusty said he couldn't reveal that information. \n\n\nMargo left to get a list of the personnel who had worked on Dusty's autopsy report. Emily snuck into the interrogation room after Margo left. She slapped Dusty and became emotional, telling him she'd been the one who had discovered Dusty's body. She told Dusty she had tried to revive him, and she and others had been accused of having murdered him. After telling Dusty she had thought she would never see him again, Emily sobbed and hugged Dusty tightly. They were very close to kissing when Margo came back into the room; Emily left without exchanging words with Margo. \n\n\nAaron tried to get Alison to make love as they were getting ready for the big party, but Alison told him they needed to be on time. Aaron pointed out that Alison had been too tired the night before for sex, and he wondered what was going on. Alison said she was still upset about her diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease and that it would prevent her from becoming pregnant, something Aaron had wanted so badly. Aaron insisted that Alison should stop worrying about that, saying it wasn't the end of the world, and they had other options. \n\n\nLater, Alison went to the Lakeview to meet Aaron, but Aaron wasn't there. Alison thought she must have gotten her signals crossed and was supposed to meet Aaron at Metro instead of at the Lakeview. As she turned to leave, she ran into Chris. Chris asked Alison why she seemed upset, but Alison told him it wasn't something he could fix. Chris told Alison that because she still had feelings for him, she couldn't be happy in her marriage to Aaron. \n\n\nChris said he had been offered a job with the Global Health Association, and that they wanted him to go back to Africa. He asked Alison to go with him; he told her the organization needed doctors and nurses, and he could help her finish her nursing studies in Africa. Alison said it would never work, and Chris should just let it go. She rushed off, upset, as Aaron entered the room. Aaron stopped Chris and asked why he couldn't leave Alison alone. Chris said Aaron had no idea what Alison wanted, but he knew because Alison talked to him, and Chris understood her. Aaron said Chris must be a lot dumber than he looked, but Chris retorted that it wasn't dumb to think that \"a woman who slept with another guy the day before her wedding maybe married the wrong guy.\" Aaron was stunned and asked Chris what he was talking about. Chris said it didn't matter, and he wasn't going to talk about it. \n\n\nAlison went to the farm to pull herself together. Aaron walked in, and Alison told him they needed to work things out. Aaron asked how they could do that, and Alison said by concentrating not on what they couldn't have, but on what they could have. Aaron said he had one question for her: had she slept with Chris Hughes the night before the wedding? Alison couldn't believe Aaron had asked her that and wanted to know why he would say such a thing. Aaron said Chris had told him, so either Chris was lying, or Alison had been lying since she took her wedding vows. Alison broke down and admitted it, telling Aaron she was \"so sorry.\" Aaron said, \"It's a little late for that, don't you think?\" and walked out of the house. \n\n\nAlison went to Chris's suite at the Lakeview. When he answered the door, she slapped him and asked him what he'd been thinking when he told Aaron about the night before her wedding. Chris said he hadn't meant for it to come out that way, but Alison told him he had ruined the one thing she was counting on to turn her life around. Alison told Chris she hated him for what he'd done.\n \n\n\n\n\n",
