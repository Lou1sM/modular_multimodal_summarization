Will refused to believe her and later took action to get Jade to move out. Meanwhile, Maddie was making peace with Dallas when Jade arrived, misinterpreted the situation, and warned Dallas not to believe whatever Maddie was saying about her. Jade's paranoia piqued Maddie's interest -- as did Dallas relating how Jade had said her pregnancy was a secret. Later, Maddie called Gwen to say something weird was going on with Jade.\n\n\nDusty dropped the bomb of Craig's return to upset Barbara while Margo debated giving her brother a second chance. When Casey heard Craig was back, he went ballistic over the pain Craig's baby switch had caused him and Gwen. However, it turned out Casey's conflict wasn't just with his uncle when Margo asked him to give Craig a chance. At the same time, Dusty told Barbara he planned to have Johnny guarded 24/7 and wasn't worried about Craig's return. Barbara went to Craig to plead with him to stay away from her family. Later, Craig decided to leave the hospital against Lucy's wishes, and Chaz, Dusty's new bodyguard for Johnny, intercepted Lucy from getting near Dusty and Johnny.\n\n\nIf Luke was worried Lily would remember she wanted him not to be gay, his fears were washed away when she remembered everything and begged his forgiveness for not accepting him the way he was.

Later, against Holden's better judgment, Lily decided to find Rose's lost daughter and take care of her the way she should have done from the beginning.\n\n\n",
