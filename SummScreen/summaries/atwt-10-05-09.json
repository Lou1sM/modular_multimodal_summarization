Holden was not ready to give up, and he suggested that they look around for some tools they could use.  They needed more light than just the kerosene lantern they had lit, so Maeve picked up a bundle of Skaggs's cash and set it on fire.  She laughed and said she had always wanted to have money to burn.  Maeve tried to imagine Eb's face if he could see her there, burning his money.  She was still convinced they were going to die there, however.\n\n\nHolden found a tall and heavy ladder and said the two of them could use it to ram the hatch on the root cellar.  They tried that several times until Maeve had a severe hand cramp.  Holden massaged it for a while, and Maeve suddenly asked him to make love to her.  Holden said that he would get her out of there, and she would find someone wonderful of her own.  He also said that Eb would be in jail for the rest of his life, so Maeve didn't have to worry about him.  Maeve said that Holden's wife was the luckiest woman in the world, and it had nothing to do with her money.\n\n\nThe two went back to ramming the hatch, and Holden began to sense that the outside latch was weakening.  One more powerful thrust did the trick, but the hatch collapsed in on the ladder, and all of it ended in a heap on top of Holden.\n\n\nRosanna arrived at Metro, where Teri was serving some patrons.  She asked Teri for help in preparing food for Carly's kids again, and she offered the young woman her job back at double the salary.  Teri was flattered, but she said that Metro took all her time, and she respectfully declined.  Craig walked in, but Rosanna refused to include him in the conversation.  She excused herself to go to the ladies' room, and while she was gone, Teri filled Craig in on Rosanna's job offer.\n\n\nWhen Rosanna returned, Craig offered her a drink; in fact, he insisted on it.  Craig said that he knew why Rosanna had asked Teri to return to work at Carly's house.  Teri was \"protection\" for Rosanna from her feelings for Craig.  Rosanna laughed, as she talked about Craig's mistaken belief that she desired him.  Craig wanted Rosanna to admit how wonderful their liaison had been, but instead she threatened to kill him if Craig ever went near her again.  Craig appeared startled, and then he promised that \"the urge\" had passed, and he wouldn't bother her.  Rosanna referred to his \"taking liberties\" with her, and Craig called her \"Jane Austen.\"\n\n\nCraig determined that they were done with each other, but Rosanna left first.  Teri approached and asked Craig what his animated conversation with Rosanna had been about, but before he could answer, Teri misinterpreted it by saying it was sad that Carly's sister and her fianc\u00e9 hated each other so much.  Craig appeared to have had an epiphany, and he left.\n\n\nCraig drove to the Spring River Rehab Center and asked to see Carly.  The receptionist said that Craig's name was not on the approved list, and that puzzled him.  Suddenly Rosanna walked by on her way out, and Craig accused her of telling Carly about the attraction between the two of them.  Rosanna refused to answer him, and she ran out.\n\n\nBack in Oakdale sometime later, Rosanna knocked on Craig's hotel door.  He opened it and blasted her for ratting him out to Carly, but Rosanna interrupted and said that she had not talked with her sister.  She also admitted that Carly would not see her, either.  Rosanna said that Craig had been right about her wanting Teri around to prevent more \"incidents\" from occurring.  Craig then admitted that he could not stop thinking about Rosanna, but she cautioned that \"it\" could never happen again.  They looked at one another for a long minute, and then they flew into each other's arms in a passionate embrace.\n\n\nJanet and Brad walked into the farm kitchen together and found Jack taking it easy.  Brad had just learned that Liberty had moved in with Paul and Emily Ryan, and he was very upset.  He wanted to get his daughter out of there; he said no way would he allow Liberty to become \"a baby-making machine for those two whack jobs.\"  Jack suggested that Janet tell Brad her plan, but she was hesitant.  Finally Janet said that she and Jack wanted to adopt and raise Liberty's baby as their own.  Brad asked them if they were out of their minds.\n\n\nBrad went on about Janet's \"screwing with Liberty's head,\" and he asked if she had really thought things through.  Brad said it hurt his head to try to figure out all the permutations of relationships between his and Katie's expected baby and Liberty's baby, his grandchild.  Janet called the arrangement \"a little unconventional,\" but Brad said it was pure \"Jerry Springer.\"  Jack called a \"time out\" and asked the two of them to take their shouting match someplace else, and he was serious.  He was having a bad day.\n\n\nJanet and Brad went to Java, and Brad accused her of moving heaven and earth to make sure that Liberty didn't get an abortion.  Janet asked why Brad was being so pigheaded about her raising the baby, and he said it was a terrible idea.  Brad stood up and said he was done.  Janet ran after him, begging him not to tell the plan to Liberty yet.\n\n\nBrad went to Metro and sat at the bar.  He waited for Teri to make an appearance, and he blurted out that Janet and Jack wanted to adopt Liberty's baby.  He pleaded with Teri to talk her sister out of it and to get Janet away from the influence of \"Uncle Ralph.\"  Janet walked in and demanded to know whose side Teri was on.  Teri only wanted to be on Liberty's side, but Janet was ready to strong-arm her.\n\n\nJanet was sure that Liberty's \"mother genes\" would kick in, as hers had, but Teri reminded her sister that Liberty had big plans; the girl wanted to go to college.  Brad accused Janet of wanting to hold on to her little girl forever by tying her to a baby \"sister,\" but Janet denied that.  Brad got disgusted and left. Teri said that maybe Brad was right, and it was all about Janet.  Janet admitted that keeping the baby was not Jack's first choice, but he was willing to go along.  Teri warned that if Janet forced Liberty to keep the baby in her life, Janet could lose her daughter, and perhaps her husband.\n\n\nAt Lily's house, Eb held Faith captive, as Damian tried to talk reason to the enraged man.  Damian promised to do whatever Eb wanted if he would let the girl go.  Faith struggled, and Eb put the gun to her head. Damian offered him any amount of money.  Eb ordered Damian to get \"the kid's mama.\"  Faith cried out, so Damian told her to do what Eb said.  Again Eb demanded that Damian go get \"the rich lady.\"  Damian attempted to convince Eb that no one else was home, but Eb said he knew how rich folks lived; there had to be cash tucked somewhere, perhaps in a safe.  Faith bit Eb on the hand and screamed, but he put the gun to her temple.  Damian begged Eb to put the gun down.\n\n\nUpstairs, Lily was dozing, and she heard Faith cry out.  She walked into the living room and was horrified to find her daughter a hostage.  Lily begged Eb not to hurt the girl, as Damian introduced Eb as \"the man from Kentucky.\"  Lily moved forward as Damian grabbed Eb's arm, and the gun fired.  Faith made a break for the door, as Damian struggled with Eb for control of the gun.\n\n\nFaith ran to the farm, where Jack was still sitting at the kitchen table.  She explained what was happening, and Jack told her to lock the door behind him, and promised he would send a squad car to protect her.  Then Jack took off for Lily's and called for backup.\n\n\nIn Lily's house, Eb knocked down Damian, as Lily leapt upon his back and began hitting him.  Eb threw her off, and Lily hit the floor.  Damian regained his feet and managed to throw Eb hard against the wood pile, and the man slumped to the floor.  Damian checked for a pulse, but then went to see how Lily was.  She was unconscious, so Damian held her and kept calling her name until she woke up.  Just then, Jack called from the door, and Damian assured him that it was all over.\n\n\nJack examined Eb and declared him dead, so he called for the coroner's wagon.  Damian explained what had happened, as Jack searched the body for identification.  He found Eb's driver's license, so he knew his name.  Lily was shaky and wanted to call Faith at the farm, but an officer showed up with the girl.  Faith ran to Lily, and they hugged, and then Faith asked about the man.  Damian said that he was dead, and Faith thanked him for saving them.  She even hugged him, much to Damian's amazement.  Faith went upstairs to lie down.\n\n\nJack went to the police station and received a fax of Maeve Stone, Eb's wife, from a church bulletin.  Jack looked at it and then requested the stills from the bank's security camera the day the woman had presented a letter supposedly from Holden.  He compared the photos and decided the photos were of the same woman.  He went back to Lily's and explained that Eb's wife, Maeve, was the one who had tried to pull off the scam at the bank.  Jack was still convinced, however, that Holden had died in the truck crash.\n\n\nJack went home and had another visitor -- Brad.  He walked in and asked if Jack really wanted to raise another baby.  Jack said he did not want to talk about it, or what had happened that got him so down in the dumps.  He finally relented, however, and said that he had finally realized that his cousin and best friend, Holden, was never returning.\n\n\nLily and Damian went up to her room, and Damian said that he would never again let Lily lose someone she loved.  They kissed, and Lily said that she needed Damian \"so much.\"  Damian asked Lily to marry him right away.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rosanna wants Teri to come back and work for her, but she is too busy at Metro. Craig overhears and thinks he knows why she wants this; she can't control herself around him and needs protection. Rosanna is aggravated that he thinks that and stomps off after more bickering. Brad and Janet continue to argue about what is right for Liberty, as Jack wants a break from it. Brad and Janet enlist Teri to take sides.

He is upset to see Rosanna there and assumes she was there to tell Carly what happened; Rosanna leaves without telling Craig why she was visiting Carly.

Teri tries to reason with Janet about how it won't be right for Liberty for her to keep her daughter's baby; she fears if she forces this on Liberty, she will not only lose her but maybe Jack as well. Rosanna comes to see a furious Craig to explain herself; Craig has assumed she spilled the beans to Carly to save herself. Rosanna admits that she was not going to tell Carly, but she was only there to remind herself why they can't be together because he was right - she doesn't trust herself with him. However, Carly wouldn't see her. Craig appreciates her honesty, and he admits that he was there to let Carly know they still hate each other to convince himself of that so he wouldn't feel so badly about betraying her.
