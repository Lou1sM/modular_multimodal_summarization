She looked up the phone numbers for the various health clinics in town and called the first one on her list, going through steps on her cell phone so that her number wouldn't show up on the caller ID system at the clinic. When she said she was Jade Taylor and needed a copy of her medical files, the clinic asked for her patient ID number or Social Security number; unable to provide either one, Maddie hung up.\n\n\nAt Will's place, Jade walked in with coffee from Java, and Will told her he had rented an apartment for her and prepaid it for six months; she could move in that day. She was upset to hear that but calmed down and told him it was not that she didn't appreciate it, just that she wished she and the baby mattered half as much to him as Gwen apparently did. Will assured her that the baby did matter to him. Jade's cell phone rang, and it was the woman from the health clinic, telling her she was sorry they had been disconnected. When Jade said she hadn't called them, the woman told her someone was trying to get her medical files.\n\n\nJade hung up and told Will that she thought it was Maddie and that Maddie had to be trying to prove something -- maybe that Jade was faking her pregnancy. Will assured her that he didn't believe that was true. A cab arrived to take Jade to her new apartment, and Will left to go to Java, where he told Maddie about the phone call Jade had gotten from the clinic. Maddie tried to convince him to go to the clinic to try to get a peek at Jade's files, but Will said as much as he'd like to think she was faking it, he believed Jade really was pregnant. Maddie left, and Will sat down to talk to Gwen, who filled him in on how college was going, saying she liked her music theory class and had to write two or three original songs for it. Will asked if any of the songs would be about them, and she said, \"Only all of them.\"\n\n\nHenry went to see Emily to give her a ride home from the hospital because Susan was all tied up with storm victims. Emily called him a traitor for having called Meg to say she was planning to leave town with Daniel, but Henry insisted he had acted as a good friend by doing that. He told Emily that if she needed to blame someone for what had happened to her baby, she should blame him. Meanwhile, Meg told Paul that she had made arrangements with the hospital chaplain to have a memorial service for baby Jennifer and that she'd like to be there, too, to tell Jennifer goodbye; Paul thought that would be fine.\n\n\nWhen Paul went to see Emily, she begged him to let them be alone together to say their goodbyes to their baby, saying it was the one thing she'd be able to do for her daughter. Paul left to tell Meg, who said she was not surprised and assured him it was okay. Meanwhile, Henry told Emily that one day, she'd want to call the one person who had never asked her, \"What's in it for me?\" and she said, \"Don't wait for your phone to ring!\" He left, saying, \"I will, Emily -- for as long as it takes.\"\n\n\nPaul returned and took Emily to the hospital's chapel, where the chaplain offered his condolences and told them their baby had been a gift that had been taken the moment it had been given. He said there was no answer to \"why,\" but they'd had a glimpse of parenthood and should always mark their daughter's birthday. He told them perhaps their baby's mission had been to remind them how precious love was then he had them light a candle for the baby and one for each of them, to represent their bond as a family. The chaplain left, and Emily asked Paul, \"What happens when the candles go out?\" Paul hugged her and said, \"If we remember her, she'll always be a part of us.\"\n\n\nA nurse told Meg that a package had been delivered for her; Meg opened it, seeing a beautiful glass vase, and thought it was from Paul, but the card read, \"Congratulations on your engagement. With warmest regards, Craig Montgomery.\"\n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Chaz, the bodyguard Dusty had hired to protect Johnny from Craig, tried to stop Lucy from approaching Dusty and the baby. Dusty told Chaz that it was okay to let Lucy approach, and when she sat down, Lucy told Dusty that she'd never liked being told what to do or who to see -- by anyone. She told Dusty she loved her father but that she could separate who he was to her from who she thought he should be to Johnny. She said she didn't want Johnny to grow up having to make excuses for his dad the way she had always had to make excuses for hers, and she said she wanted Johnny to be proud of Dusty. Then she introduced herself to the bodyguard and explained exactly who she was, and Dusty told him, \"She's okay.\"\n\n\nMr. Yamamoto walked up, explaining that he had a business meeting in Chicago that allowed him to make a side trip to Oakdale, since Dusty had needed to cancel his meeting in New York. He said he had a conference room set up for a meeting if Dusty could attend, and Lucy told Dusty she'd watch Johnny for him, accompanied by Chaz. Dusty and Mr. Yamamoto left; as soon as Lucy sat down with Johnny, Craig walked in, and the bodyguard grabbed him. Lucy demanded to know what he was doing there when he should be in the hospital, and he told her he'd checked himself out against medical advice. Lucy told him she thought he'd said he'd changed, and Craig asked if she expected him to just sit by and watch another man raise his son; she said yes, if he really loved Johnny, that was what she expected him to do.\n\n\nCraig informed Lucy that he had rented a suite upstairs at the Lakeview, and at that moment, Dusty walked up, took Johnny from Lucy's arms, and demanded to know what Craig was doing there. Craig said Dusty could keep him from holding Johnny, but he couldn't make him invisible; glancing at the bodyguard, Dusty replied, \"I wouldn't be too sure about that!\" Craig left, and Dusty turned on Lucy, saying, \"Is this becoming a habit? Setting up Johnny?\" Lucy insisted she'd known nothing about her father's discharge from the hospital or plans to stay at the Lakeview, but Dusty told her to tell him what she and her dad had planned next, because he was not in the mood for any more surprises.\n\n\n",
