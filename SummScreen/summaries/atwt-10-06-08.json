    "soap_central": "\n\nAt WOAK, Katie and Brad watched a new promo rehearsal, and Kim introduced them to Spencer McKay, a new program host at the station. Kim wanted Brad not only to do the promo with Spencer, but to be the woman's co-host for the new show, \"Oakdale 4-1-1.\" Kim also explained that Brad was going to be doing both the old show with Katie and the new one, while Katie would be branching out into hard news. Katie seemed fine with the new schedule, but Brad was reluctant because he did not want to do anything without Katie. \n\n\nAlison found Casey moping in the coffee shop, and he explained that he and Emily had broken up over the disagreement about her tubal ligation. Casey resented  Emily for making such a life-changing decision without considering his feelings. Alison began thinking about her own situation with Aaron and began to cry as Chris came in and watched. Casey guessed that Aaron had found out that Alison had slept with Chris just before her wedding, and Alison realized it was Dani who had spread the news. Casey tried to convince Alison that all might not be lost with Aaron. \n\n\nHolden told Lily that Dusty should have been honest with her when he faked his death. Lily agreed and admitted that she wanted to go see him at the police station. She felt she had the right to some answers, and Holden needed to trust that she was not the same person as the Lily who had gotten involved with Dusty. \n\n\nEmily tracked down her mother at Memorial and gave her the third degree about Dusty. She accused Susan of helping him cheat death, since she was the examining doctor after the \"fatal\" injection. Susan could not believe that Dusty was alive or that Emily would ever want anything more to do with him, in spite of their history. Susan had little faith, however, that her daughter could stay away from him. \n\n\nLucinda had a private meeting with Dusty, and he filled her in on his lack of success in finding Lucy and Johnny. Lucinda was one of those who had made his escape possible by providing him money. She told Dusty she hoped he would stay away from Lily, but Dusty could not promise that. Lucinda explained what had happened between Lily and Holden recently, while Dusty informed her that Margo was trying to charge him with fraud for faking his own death. As Lucinda was leaving the interview room, Lily arrived and overheard Lucinda's parting comments, particularly the comment in which she told Dusty not to tell Lily about her part in his \"death.\" Lily pinned her mother down immediately and learned that Lucinda had been involved with the scheme practically from the beginning. Lily blamed both of them and told her mother to get out of her sight. Everyone left Lily and Dusty alone, and the first thing he did was beg her forgiveness. He thought she hated him and figured when he was out of the picture, she would go back to Holden. Dusty said he had to find his son, and that was his primary concern. Suddenly Holden burst in and told Dusty to take his hands off Lily. \n\n\nBrad explained that Katie made him the popular television personality he was, but she told him he could be a real star if he took the opportunity for the new show Kim was offering. That way, Katie could also do what she had always wanted to do, the hard news. Brad thought about it and then finally agreed. They met with Spencer in the Lakeview, and the three of them planned some episodes of the new show together. Spencer took so many notes she had to go to the gift shop to buy another notebook, and while she was gone, Katie told Brad that he had to stop playing dumb. Spencer returned and suddenly Brad remembered an \"appointment\" that he and Katie had, and he took her home to bed. \n\n\nSusan saw Alison in the hospital and made a crack about how tired she looked, and also mentioned Dusty's sudden return from the grave. Susan cautioned her to stay away from him, but a shocked Alison reminded her that she would not be in nursing school if Dusty had not left her scholarship money in his will. She also hinted that her marriage to Aaron might be over, and Susan picked up on that immediately. She asked her daughter to explain herself, but Alison declined. Susan told her to hang on to Aaron because he was a good guy. \n\n\nChris went to WOAK and told Kim he was leaving shortly for a meeting with the Global Health Association. He was interested in returning to Africa with that organization and felt he could do some real good there. His mother asked if his decision had anything to do with Alison Stewart, and Chris admitted that was part of it. Kim suggested he take a long vacation instead of pulling up stakes completely, but Chris told her the Global people had already accepted his application; it was a done deal. Kim got teary-eyed, and said, \"Nuts!\" but then gave him a big hug and wished him well. \n\n\nCasey went to Emily's office bearing coffee for her and apologized for being so harsh about her making decisions about her own body. He wanted to resume their relationship, but Emily was reluctant to be with him any longer. Casey asked what had suddenly changed, but Emily just said she was smart enough to know they could never be more to each other. Casey walked out and went to find Alison. He asked her if she knew what was wrong with her sister, and Alison responded, \"Dusty Donovan.\" \n\n\nAt the station, Dusty told Holden he was not back in Oakdale to destroy Holden's marriage, and would be leaving soon. He only came back so that Meg would not get arrested for keeping his secret. The police released Dusty, since no charges had been filed, and told him not to leave the jurisdiction. Emily arrived unexpectedly and offered Dusty a ride to the Lakeview. \n\n\nHolden and Lily headed home, only to find Lucinda waiting for them. Holden tried to get rid of her, but Lily was primed for a confrontation. She asked her mother why she had hurt her whole family by aiding and abetting Dusty, but Lucinda claimed she was only trying to help fix Lily's marriage. Lily still blamed Lucinda for not telling her that Dusty was still alive, and accused her mother of moving mountains and changing lives her entire life. That, said Lily, was about to stop, and she asked her mother to leave. Lucinda still claimed she had no knowledge of the plan until after Dusty had faked his death. Dusty had offered the solution to Lucinda, and she had leapt at it, thinking that it would force Lily and Holden to get back together. Lily made it clear that her mother should leave. \n\n\nSpencer interrupted Brad and Katie's lovemaking with just one more fantastic idea for an episode of their show, but Brad told her to catch up with him the next day. Spencer was aware that the couple was otherwise occupied. \n\n\nEmily drove Dusty to the Lakeview and waited for him to check in. She offered to leave so that an exhausted Dusty could get some sleep, but he grabbed her hand and told her not to leave. \n\n\n",
