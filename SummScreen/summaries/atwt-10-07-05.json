Luke wanted to know what had happened to Keith, and when Lucinda and Holden made everything sound like Keith's fault, Luke defended him and said he would never have knowingly left Luke in trouble in Mexico. Luke was worried that something bad might have happened to Keith, so Lucinda decided they should tell Luke about Keith being involved in smuggling human organs out of Mexico to sell in the United States, and Holden told Luke that Keith had been working with Blanca, the woman who had kidnapped him. Luke still thought something bad had happened to Keith if he hadn't turned up yet, but Holden assured him that the authorities were looking for Keith. Luke then told Holden that he thought he and Lily looked different, and Lucinda told Luke that something was happening between his parents that he would be very pleased about. Holden walked out, and Lucinda told Luke she thought that Holden and Lily would get back together. She also told Luke that she was having surgery in the morning for her cancer.\n\n\nMeanwhile, outside the house, Keith had encountered Lily and explained to her what had happened, telling her that he had been hit over the head by someone at the clinic when he went to try to find Luke and then left in the desert to die. A farmer found him and took him to safety. He told Lily he had spent the next 2 weeks looking for Luke in Mexico. He also said he had thought he was helping people by transporting the organs and that he hadn't known they were using live donors and exploiting people to get the organs. Holden then walked outside and saw Keith and told him to get lost. Keith told Holden he needed to talk to Lily and that it wasn't his business, but Holden said, \"It is now.\" Keith realized things had changed between Lily and Holden, and he left, telling Lily that things weren't over between them yet and that he would come back later after she'd had more time to think about things.\n\n\nEmily waited with Paul at the airport for his flight to Italy, which was delayed because the pilot was ill. Eventually, Paul's flight was called, and he kissed Emily goodbye and left to board the plane. At the same time, Dusty and Jennifer were waiting for their flight to Tampa, Florida, where they were going to try to find Nurse Thompson and get her to admit that she had switched Jennifer's baby with another baby at the hospital. They saw Emily and tried to avoid her but ended up running into her anyway. Emily told them they'd just missed Paul, but when she saw that they had bags with them, she asked them where they were going. Dusty and Jennifer made up a story about going to a fashion show to talk to a designer who could fill in locally for Jennifer while she was out of the country, and they told Emily that they were going to Philadelphia and then to New York but that they'd be back in a few days. Emily told them she didn't think Paul would like the idea of Jennifer traveling for work very much, and she wanted to call him, but his cell phone was already turned off for the flight. Jennifer told Emily she didn't need to justify her actions to Emily unless Emily intended to make her feel like an invalid for the rest of her life; Emily said of course not, and she wished them luck on their trip. After they left, Emily checked with the ticket agent, saying her sister-in-law had just gotten on the plane and she needed to reach her; the agent told her the flight for Tampa had already left. Emily then called Paul on his cell phone and left a message for him, then returned to the ticket agent and asked for a ticket out on the next flight to Tampa.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the nurse told Carly that Gwen had told her she was Carly's babysitter, so she had left Gwen alone with Rory when she had to leave the room. Carly called Jack to tell him that Gwen had taken Rory. Jack had the hospital exits monitored and told Carly that they'd find Rory. They went to Gwen's apartment and could see that she had been there; a mechanic from Burt's Garage told them he had seen her leave about a half an hour earlier. Jack reassured Carly again that they had an APB out for Gwen and that they would find her, and he sent a policeman to Iris's house to see if Gwen was there and to bring Iris back to him for questioning if Gwen wasn't there. Carly had a meltdown, blaming herself for leaving a baby alone again, just like she'd done with her brother, and letting Rosanna down. The uniformed officer brought Iris to Gwen's place to talk to Jack, but Iris denied knowing anything about Gwen taking the baby. Carly accused Iris of helping Gwen take Rory to get back at her for what happened to her baby boy, but Iris said if she was going to steal Carly's baby for payback, she would have done it a long time ago. Jack asked Iris where she thought Gwen might have gone, and Hal walked in and said wherever it was, he thought that Will might have gone with her and might be helping her. \n\n\nGwen took Rory up to the roof where she and Will both used to go for quiet thinking time and called Will to ask him for help, telling him it was an emergency and that she really needed him. He told her he was on his way, but then Hal walked in and asked if he could spare a few minutes to talk about Jennifer being released from Deerbrook. While they were talking, Hal got a call from the station about the APB that had been put out for Gwen and the baby. Will took the opportunity to leave while his dad was busy. When he got to the roof, he couldn't believe that Gwen had stolen the baby; she insisted it was stealing because she was his mother. She told Will that she'd found out that Carly had killed her own baby brother when she was a kid, and she also told Will that he'd been right about Iris being out for the baby's trust fund money. She said that Will was the only one she could still trust. Will pointed out all the reasons why Gwen would be in trouble for this and all the reasons why it wasn't a good idea for her to just take off by herself, thinking she could manage to get a job and go to school and find someone to watch the baby for her. Gwen told Will she wanted to go to New York, and she asked him to take her to an out-of-town bus station to catch a bus, but Will said he'd drive her to New York himself, telling her that two of them could take better care of the baby than just one of them could. Gwen agreed and told Will that she had an ex-teacher who lived in New York with whom she was still in touch and that she planned to contact her. Will thought that sounded like a plan, and they left.\n\n\n\n\n",
