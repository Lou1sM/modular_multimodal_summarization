She then volunteered to help break the two of them up, if that were the case. Carly reminded her daughter that she and Jack were no longer a couple and would never be together again, so Sage should give Janet a chance because she was good for Jack. \n\n\nJack was having breakfast at the diner and tried to persuade Janet to abandon her job for the day and go for a hike with him. Janet was tempted, but she feared Vienna would not give her the time off. She reminded Jack that she could not just blow off her job for him, which was exactly what Jack did for her when he stole the evidence in the Morissey case. When Janet realized what she had said, she apologized and said she only opened her mouth to change feet. Jack left so as not to distract Janet any more, and Janet and Vienna chatted. \n\n\nJanet took a free lunch to Margo at the police station as an excuse to talk with her. She begged Margo to give Jack his job back on the police force. Margo said she had no choice but to fire Jack, but Janet interrupted her by confessing that she had actually destroyed the evidence herself after Jack had given it to her for safekeeping. Margo reminded Janet that the destruction of evidence was a criminal matter, but Janet gave one more plea for Jack's reinstatement, and then she left. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Dusty told Emily that he still cared for her and kept apologizing for not telling her he was still alive. Emily made no promises to him, but did go up to his room with him. She continued to tell him how angry she was when she thought he died being disappointed in her. When she asked him if he would have come back to Oakdale if he had found Johnny, he could not answer. Emily said she learned to cope without having him around and asked him how he felt about her. A knock on the door interrupted a kiss, and a courier handed Dusty a package. \n\n\nMeg visited Paul in the psych ward, where he was fighting his restraints. Meg tried to calm him, but he wanted to get out so he could protect her. Meg left the room for a minute, and James appeared to his son and advised him to stop acting like a crazy if he wanted to get out. Paul told James he knew he was dead and only a figment of his imagination, but James continued to taunt him. Paul kept it together when Meg came back with a nurse who attempted to give him a sedative, but Paul refused. He inquired what had happened to James's body, but Meg did not know, nor did she know where Dusty had gone after he had been released. Meg offered to speak with Dr. Bob to see if she could take Paul home and regulate his medication herself, and when Meg stepped out, James reappeared. Meg talked with Bob and assured him she could handle her husband at home. Bob reluctantly agreed and released his patient. \n\n\nDusty and Emily began opening the recently delivered package while Dusty pondered who might know where he was. The package contained a large Swedish Bible embossed with the Stenbeck name. Inside, Emily found a letter in Swedish, which prompted her to review Dusty's history as the birth son of Gunnar Stenbeck, although he was raised by both Burt Donovan and John Dixon. James's mother, who was a family servant, had switched baby Gunnar with her own newborn son, James, at birth, making her son the Stenbeck heir. Dusty reminded Emily that James had looted all the family money and power over the years, and he was not interested in being part of that family or of Swedish royalty. Dusty needed sleep desperately, so he kissed Emily goodbye and told her that while he was in Oakdale, he needed her as his friend. She left, taking the book with her, and suddenly Dusty dashed out, as well. \n\n\nIn the Snyder orchard, Jack found Carly and Sage picking apples. He admitted to his ex-wife that he hated every day he was not on the police force. Carly offered Jack a juicy apple, and when he questioned if there were a serpent around, she reminded him that sometimes temptation was a good thing. Jack took a big bite of the apple and thanked her for a lovely day with her and their daughter. \n\n\nJanet went to the Snyder farmhouse and Jack came in with Carly and Sage. When Jack and Sage went out to the car, Janet asked Carly yet again if she was sure she was finished with Jack. Carly explained how it was to Janet and left in a huff. After Jack came back in, Margo called him and asked that he come down to the station immediately. That lifted Janet's spirits immeasurably. \n\n\nMeg took Paul home to Fairwinds, and when she went into the kitchen to talk to the staff about dinner, Dusty came in. Paul told him to get the hell out of his house and threatened him with a fireplace poker. Paul was furious, and screamed at Dusty to get out. Dusty left because there was no reasoning with Paul, who was then threatening to kill Dusty with his bare hands. Meg calmed Paul by snuggling with him and trying to get him to focus on the future and their baby. Paul saw the vision of James again, and the vision warned him about Dusty. \n\n\nEmily took the Stenbeck Bible to Vienna and asked her to translate. Vienna looked at some of the Bible entries and affirmed that the Stenbecks had married into Swedish royalty in the 16th century. She translated the letter, which was from a lawyer, Mr. Bergman, in Stockholm, asking Dusty to get in touch with him immediately. He gave a number for contact. \n\n\nAt the Oakdale Police Department, Margo offered Jack his job and shield back. She said that Janet had stepped up and admitted that she had actually destroyed the evidence, so Margo had reconsidered her position with Jack. She needed him on the force and was willing to reinstate him immediately. Jack walked out without taking either the job or the shield, because he was angry. Margo tried to call him on his cell phone, but Jack had it turned off, so she left a message that ordered him back to work. \n\n\nCarly returned to the farm after taking Sage to dance class and apologized for snapping at Janet. She even brought a peace offering, which Janet accepted before saying she was sorry, as well. Jack came in and berated Janet for going behind his back and telling Margo what happened to the missing evidence. Jack told her it was just too late and went upstairs. Janet was upset and walked out, and when Jack came down later, he lit into Carly, too, asking her what her angle was in trying to set him up with Janet. \n\n\nEmily went back to see Dusty and told him what Vienna had learned from the Bible and the letter. She had called Mr. Bergman, who was eager to talk directly with Dusty. Dusty was not pleased with the distraction, and told Emily to call Bergman back and give him Paul's number instead. Emily reminded him that James was dead and had made tons of money, all of which should come to Dusty.\n\n\n",
