    "soap_central": "\n\n \nLily lay in bed looking at her wedding ring from Holden, and Lucinda walked in unexpectedly. Lucinda said that Faith had just told her the most preposterous tale: Lily was getting married to Damian!  Lucinda hoped desperately that her granddaughter was lying, but Lily said that Faith was speaking the truth; Lily was marrying Damian that evening.  Her mother was stunned and asked if her daughter had lost her mind.\n\n\nLily said that the children had approved, and that was all the permission she needed.  Lucinda was particularly concerned about Faith, who, she said, needed more of Lily's attention.  Lily countered by saying that she saw no joy in her future without Damian.  Lucinda was horrified at such an ugly statement, but Lily continued by telling her mother to \"get over it.\"  Lily was sure that Damian had only her best interests at heart, and she asked if Lucinda  could support her enough to attend the wedding; otherwise, her mother was not welcome. Lucinda thought long and hard, and then she decided that she could not watch Lily make such a terrible mistake.\n\n\nHolden awakened in the hospital in Kentucky and spoke to the nurse, Renee.  He remembered that she was Maeve's friend, so he asked her for a phone so he could call his wife.  Renee loaned him her cell phone, but Holden could not bring himself to make the call.  He said that he needed to show up in person, so that there would be no more misunderstandings.  Holden did not care that he was not well enough to leave the hospital; he was going home.  He put on his clothes and begged Renee to help him escape.  Renee gave him her car keys, and Holden promised to leave her car at the airport.  He had severe pain in his back, but he was determined to go home.\n\n\nDamian and Luke had breakfast at the Lakeview, and Damian told the boy that he hoped to be able to make Lily's whole family happy.  Luke was sure that the younger kids would grow to appreciate Damian in time.  Damian shocked Luke by saying that the wedding would be that night at Lily's house, and he asked his son to be his best man.  He also said that fate had led  him back to Oakdale, and it was his destiny to be Lily's husband.  Luke looked uncomfortable with those words, and he wondered what to call Damian, but he agreed to be the best man.\n\n\nDamian went to Lily's and excitedly told her that Luke was to be his groomsman.  Lily was sad that her mother would not be at the wedding, so Damian promised that, after they were married, he would do his best to make Lucinda like and respect him.  Lily was having second thoughts about such a rushed wedding, but Damian said that they did not need spectators, only the children.  He asked Lily to trust him, and he handed her his credit card.  Damian told Lily to go buy a new dress, have her hair done, or get a massage, and he promised to take care of all the wedding arrangements.\n\n\nAt the farm, Emma put some fall wildflowers in a vase and told Meg that she had also just put some on Holden's grave.  She said that she was missing her boy particularly that day, so Meg tried to cheer her up by saying that things were turning for the better in her life.  Besides the joy of baby Eliza, Meg felt that she and Damian had cleared the air and begun to get their relationship back on track.  A startled Emma reminded her daughter that Damian had left her under nasty circumstances, but that only made Meg defensive.  She asked Emma to watch the baby, and she set off to run some errands.\n\n\nNoah went to Mason's office at the university for an appointment, but he found a different professor there.  Her name was Professor Gruen, and she announced that she was Noah's new advisor.  She handed over Noah's screenplay, which she had just read and covered with pink sticky notes.  She told him that he had better get to work because she had \"made a few notes.\"  Noah was flattened because he had been expecting to go scouting for shoot locations with Mason that very day.\n\n\nNoah went to Java and began reading the notes, and Luke found him there.  Luke was surprised that he was not driving around with Mason on a visit to the quarry, where Noah wanted to shoot his film, but his boyfriend gloomily said that outside powers had intervened in his life, but he gave no details.  Luke casually mentioned that his parents were getting married again that evening.  Noah was shocked, and then he shared that Mason had quit being his advisor and passed him off to another professor, who hated his script.\n\n\nLuke suggested that Noah continue working with Mason for the ongoing  project, but cautioned Noah not to let Mason touch him, and he was only half-kidding.  He also wanted Noah at his folks'  wedding, and Noah promised he would go look for Mason, go to the quarry to get permission to film there, and then he would meet Luke at Lily's for the wedding.\n\n\nNoah hunted down Mason and chewed him out for pawning him off on an advisor who didn't know anything bout him or his work.  Noah begged Mason to \"fix it,\" but Mason said he regretted the remark he had made about Noah's attractiveness, and it was \"too weird\" for them to be working together.  Noah reminded Mason that he had to lock down his location site immediately, so Mason relented and agreed to go with Noah to the quarry.\n\n\nInstead of going shopping, Lily went to the farm, and Emma remarked that her granddaughter looked pale.  Lily said that she needed to talk to Emma because she was marrying Damian that evening at her house.  Emma declined to give her blessing, so Lily tried to assure her that Damian cared very much about Holden's children, and even grumpy Faith had changed her mind about him.  Lily invited Emma to the nuptials, but as expected, Emma refused.  She said that she never expected Lily to spend her whole life alone, but it was way too soon for her to remarry.  Emma still felt Holden's spirit around them, so it was not the right time.\n\n\nA sad Lily then drove to the cemetery and spoke to Holden at his grave.  She explained that she could not be alone, especially with the children to care for.  She wept and said that she was moving on, but she would never stop loving him.  The sky began to get darker, and a storm appeared imminent.\n\n\nDamian went to Old Town and ran into Meg as she exited Fashions.  She invited him for a cup of coffee, but he said that he had to make some hurried arrangements for his wedding to Lily that night.  Meg was gobsmacked , but Damian reminded her that he had told her that he had proposed to Lily. Meg said there was no way those kids would have accepted Damian; they hated him and didn't want him around.  Damian said that things had changed.\n\n\nMeg recovered her composure and said some platitudes to Damian and then took off.  She went home and burst into the farmhouse, raging at Emma, as lightning began flashing wildly.  Emma accused her daughter of being upset about the wedding, not because of Holden's death.  She knew that Meg wanted Damian, but she said that he had used her to get to Lily.  She declared that Damian was not a good person and that Meg deserved better.\n\n\nAt Lily's, Damian and Luke were dressed for the wedding, and they stood outside and watched the storm move in.  Lily returned with no shopping bags, and she was worried that even the weather disapproved of what they were doing.  She questioned whether they should get married so quickly, but Damian perked her up by joking about some Maltese wedding traditions.  Lily went inside and found a wedding cake waiting, along with champagne and flowers. The children were clean and dressed in new togs, thanks to another Grimaldi -- Lisa.\n\n\nLily went upstairs to find something suitable for her to wear and returned in a white dress.  Damian declared that the judge was ready for them, and suddenly Lucinda walked in as the heavy rain hit.  Lily hugged her mother, and the thunder cracked.  Luke was concerned that Noah had not yet arrived, and he worried about the storm.  Damian gave a saccharin spiel to Lucinda about proving himself \"worthy of Lily's love,\" but she wasn't buying it.\n\n\nNoah and Mason were on the road back from the quarry when the downpour began, and Mason's car died.  He tried to call for roadside service, but he had no cell service.  Noah asked his mentor if he had arranged the breakdown on purpose, and Mason yelled, \"Get over yourself,\" and stated that he was not in love with Noah, only trying to help him lock down his shoot location.  Noah apologized and said that he had just promised Luke that they would be together for all the important moments in their lives, and he had failed again.\n\n\nThunder boomed while Lily, Lucinda and the girls went to get the wedding flowers from the refrigerator.  Out on the rain-soaked porch, a wild-looking Meg peered through the glass panels in the door, and Damian spotted her.  He went outside, and Meg went ballistic.  She raved like a crazy woman, and Damian spoke harshly to her and told her to \"get over it.\"  Meg said no and refused to leave, so Damian told her to go before she made a complete fool of herself.  Damian went back inside, but Meg continued to spy on them as the judge began the ceremony.  After a few moments, however, Meg ran off.\n\n\nDamian spoke and said how he felt about Lily and her family, and he promised to make them happy.  Lily also spoke, and she thanked Damian for helping her through the worst tragedy of her life.  She said that she trusted him to love and care for them all.\n\n\nMeg returned to the farm to find Emma packed and ready to leave for a fall foliage trip with her church ladies.  Emma said goodbye to her daughter and told Meg that she loved her.  The first thing Meg did after Emma left was to pick up a dinner plate and smash it to pieces on the floor.\n\n\nThe judge led Lily and Damian through the placing of the rings, and then he declared them man and wife.  At that moment, the door flew open, and there stood Holden.\n\n\n",
