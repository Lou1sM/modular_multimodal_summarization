She tells Jake that work is following them and she wanted to only think about their honeymoon.  Jake tells her to go look at the papers.  He has made it possible that they got the next morning addition of The City Times so she could see her beautiful face on the social page.  She starts to read the article and tells Jake that he is so handsome.  Then she gasps and tells Jake that there was a shooting at their reception after they had left.  Jake thinks that she is joking, but when he sees the look on her face, he can tell that she is not.  She starts to call Abigail and Jake tells her not to call all upset like she is right now.  She doesn't listen and she dials anyway.  She gets the answering machine and tells Abigail to pick up.  Abigail does not answer the phone.  She hangs up and she is very upset.  Jake calls Donna and Donna tells him that everything is alright.  She tells Jake to tell Molly that her daughter is eighteen and a freshman in college.  When Molly hears this she takes off in a huff.  Jake tells Donna that didn't help and he hangs up the phone.  Molly is packing her suitcase.  Jake says, \"I guess that we will be honeymooning in Oakdale.\"  There is a knock at the door and when Jake answers it a bellhop is there with a big fruit basket and a bottle of champagne.  Jake accepts it and tips the bellhop.  He takes the gifts in and sets them down.  He takes out the card and reads it out loud to Molly.  It is from Lucinda.  She tells them that everything is ok and that they should stay in Hawaii and celebrate their honeymoon.\n\n\nAt Jake and Molly's apartment, Abigail and Adam come in.  They discuss the events of the evening.  Adam makes a comment about the apartment being so quiet.  Abigail tells him that Donna has taken the twins back to Bay City with her.  She adds that Donna had asked her to come along, but she couldn't pass up having the apartment all to herself.  Adam realizes that they are alone and takes advantage of the moment.  He leans in and kisses Abigail.  They discuss Jennifer's situation with Billy and Bryant and they wonder if \"it\" happens that way.  They kiss some more.  Abigail lies down on the couch and Adam lies on top of her as they make out.  Adam stops and asks if Abigail if she is ok and she says that she is.  They start to kiss again and then Abigail stops him.  She is not quiet sure she is ready.  Adam says that he understands and he can wait.  Then he adds, \"But not too long.\"  They stand up and start to kiss.  The phone rings and it is Molly.  Abigail tells her that everything is fine.  Abigail keeps changing the subject on Molly and then she cuts the conversation short.  When Abigail hangs up, Adam asks if she didn't want them to know he was there with her.  She tells him that she didn't have to lie that way.  They start to kiss again and the phone rings again.  Adam says that the phone is not his friend tonight.  Then the doorbell rings.  Adam and Abigail laugh and Adam tells her to answer the phone and he will get the door.  Abigail answers the phone and it is Donna.  As Abigail talks to Donna, Adam answers the door and Nick is standing there.  Nick asks if Abigail is ok, then he sees her on the phone.  Adam says that she is fine and she is busy.  He tells Nick that he will tell Abigail that he was here and starts to close the door.  Abigail looks up and sees Nick and tells him to come in, she will just be one minute on the phone.  Adam reluctantly lets Nick in.  After Abigail hangs up the phone she smiles at Nick and says hello.  She had heard Nick asking Adam about getting the footage at the shooting after the reception.  Abigail tells Nick that Adam got the whole thing on the camera that he had left.  Adam tells Nick that he had given the tape to his mother who is a police officer.  Nick jumps on him and says that they need that footage for the news.  Nick scolds him and says that he should always make a copy of the tape before giving it to the police.  Adam says that the police need to start the investigation and he wasn't going to make them wait until he could make a copy of the tape.  Abigail tells Adam to settle down.  Nick says that they can go to the station and get started until they get their tape back.  Adam yells at Nick again and says that he wasn't there to get famous and then he walks away.  Abigail apologizes to Nick and tells him that it has been a long day and they will be at the station first thing in the morning.  After Nick is gone, Adam and Abigail start to yell at each other.  All the sudden they stop and look at each other.  Adam asks why are they yelling at each other.  Abigail says that she has been up a long time and she needs to get some sleep.  Adam puts on his tuxedo jacket and they walk to the door.  They kiss again and Adam says that he is going \"patiently\" into the night.  Abigail laughs and closes the door.\n\n\nBack in Hawaii, Jake comes in after making arrangements for he and Molly to go back to Oakdale.  He sees Molly standing in the middle of the room with nothing on but a short grass skirt and a lei around her neck.  Jake tells her that she will make quit a stir in the airport dressed like that.  She tells him that she got to thinking that this will be their only honeymoon and thinks it would be better to stay and celebrate their marriage.  Jake walks over to her and kisses her.  He picks her up and takes her off to the bedroom.  She says that she hopes he is not allergic to grass and they both laugh.\n\n\nJack brings Carly a mug of coffee.  She has come to Jack house to see if he is all right after the events of the evening.  He tells her that his instincts are to take her upstairs and take all her clothes off and make love to her.  She tells him that they should have their coffee and see what happens.  He tells her about quitting the police department.  She tells him that being a cop is something that he loves.  He tells her that he just can't do it anymore and he is trying to think of something else to do.  He tells her that one thing he will be doing is watching her back.  She informs him that she doesn't need anyone to watch after her.  She tells him about working for BRO.  Jack is surprised and then he tells her to watch out for Craig.  Carly tells him to please not go there.  Jack reminds her that Craig is after the company and if he knows that she is working for the Ryan's he could do something to her.  Carly reminds Jack that she can handle Craig.  Jack is not convinced.  Carly decides it is time for her to leave.  Jack walks her to the door and tells her to be careful.  She touches his cheek with her hand.  He takes her hand and kisses it.  She tells him that she has always loved the way he looks out for her.  He says that he has always wanted the best of all worlds for her.  She says goodnight Jack and he tells her good morning.  They look into each other's eyes and she tells him to stop it with his eyes.  She says that he is messing with her head.  He says that it is fair game because he can't get her out of his head.  He tells her to take care of herself.  Carly walks away with a big smile on her face.\n\n\nAt Craig's suite, someone knocks at the door and when Craig opens the door, Margo walks in.  She tells him that she saw him leave the reception with Carly.  Then she adds that Jack saw them too.  He asks if it put a bee in his bonnet.  Margo asks if that was the intent.  Craig says that he doesn't need to make Jack jealous.  He adds that Carly has always been attracted to him and now that he has saved her life, you know.  Simon comes walking in and announces that Katie is gone and she took her pet rabbit Snickerz.  Craig asks if she has left with Bruno.  Simon says that he doesn't know.  Margo says that she will check out some things and get back to him.  Simon says that he would appreciate that.  Margo gets a call and when she hangs up, she tells Craig and Simon that she was having Bruno checked out and it seems he did have mob ties in New Jersey.  Margo leaves and Simon tells Craig that he was wrong about Bruno.  Craig tells Simon that Katie gets into trouble on a regular basis and she will be ok.  Simon reminds him that if he had listened to him before, Katie would still be on that island.  Craig starts to laugh and tells Simon that all this is for his benefit.  Simon tells Craig that if he knows something he had better tell him, because he is in the mood to beat it out of him.  Craig tells him that Katie is doing all this to make Simon jealous.  He adds that it seems to have worked.  Simon says that she seems to be a little over the top with this guy.  He tells Craig that when she saw him at the wedding she was all over him and then when Bruno showed up she went ice cold.  Craig asks if Simon thinks she is afraid he might hurt her.  Simon says that he is not sure.  Then he adds that now that he thinks about it, maybe she is afraid of what Bruno might do to him.  Later, Margo comes back in and says that they have no evidence that Bruno made Katie leave against her will.  Simon says that they all know that Bruno forced Katie to go.  Craig tells Simon to trust his wife.  He adds that Katie will find a way out of this mess, she always does.  \n\n\nA big wooden door opens and Katie is standing outside.  She says, \"Hi, my name is Katie Peretti and I have found myself in some trouble and I was wondering if you would offer some refuge for the night?\"\n\n\n",
