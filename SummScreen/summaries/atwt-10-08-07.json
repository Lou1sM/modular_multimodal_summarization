Margo was very upset he didn't tell her what he had found out Cheri's death. He told her that once she had charged him- she wouldn't have believed him. She told him that she wasn't out to get him- that the case was on going, but Dusty told her it didn't look like it. She brought up how Dusty shot Craig- but he pointed out that when he shot Craig he confessed- and he had told her he didn't shoot Cheri.

Lily tells Holden to tell her everything is going to be alright, but an angry Holden tells her he can't do that. \n\n\nMargo arrived at the hospital and talked to Noah. Noah tells her he didn't know his father was capable of this.

Katie told him that both she and Carly thought it was a good idea. JJ told her that she was just pretending to like him; that she was waiting for Carly to die so she can be with his dad. \n\n\nJack arrives at Carly's. He knocks but there is no answer. She is on the floor leaning on the couch, but is awake. He wants to call the Doctor, but she says no.  While she is freshening up Jack finds the DVDs she made for each of them. He plays the one labeled for him. On the DVD Carly tells Jack how much she loves him and that she is happy that he is with Katie. She wants him to be really happy and that's all she wants. Shaken, Jack turns it off. Carly, who was watching behind him reiterates what she said; \"I want you to be happy- really happy.\" He tells her he doesn't know what to say. Carly tells him that there are things that she still needs to say to him. Uncomfortable, he tries to leave, but she stops him. She tells him that she lived her life like she had a million chances. But now she was out of chances, no more do-overs. He told her that the way she lived her life made her exciting; it made him love her. She told that she meant what she said- she wants him to be happy with Katie- but there was just one more thing that would mean the world to her; one more chance for him to hold her, just one more time to feel the way she felt when he kissed her- just one more chance. \n\n\n",
