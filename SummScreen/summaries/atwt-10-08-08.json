Brian was enthused until he learned that the festival was for gay films. He explained that those were not the investors they were seeking at this that time. Luke was offended, but Brian went on that the foundation could not appear to be in any way political. He then criticized Luke for being oversensitive about the whole gay issue. He invited Luke to ride with him to a conference meeting at Worldwide, but Luke preferred to take his own car. After Brian left, Noah suggested to Luke that he not let his being gay define himself completely. \n\n\nLily chastised her mother for coming into her house uninvited. Lucinda said she wanted to spend some time with Lily's younger children, but Lily refused the request. Holden came in and heard Lily ordering her mother to leave. Lucinda knew the reason for her daughter's anger and admitted that she had helped Dusty leave town, but she did had done it to save Lily's marriage. Lily continued to demand that her mother leave, even though Lucinda protested that everything she did was because she loved Lily. After Lucinda finally left, Holden questioned Lily as to why this particular interference by her mother was so memorable to her. Lily described her mother as a bulldozing force all her life, and for once she would like to see Lucinda face the consequences of her actions. \n\n\nIn Dusty's room at the Lakeview, Emily could not understand why Dusty was not excited about being the possible Stenbeck heir. Dusty, however, looked at the situation as James's pulling the puppet strings from the grave. Emily received a call from Mr. Bergman, the Swedish lawyer, and reminded Dusty that the call could easily change his life. \n\n\nPaul received a call from his accountant that irritated him, and he hung up on him. James's image appeared and taunted him for not handling the call well. Paul went downstairs to find Meg and asked her to come upstairs and lie down with him. Meg wanted to give Paul his medication, but he argued that it made him feel strange. Then Paul received a call from Mr. Bergman, and he told Meg to put on her prettiest dress for the \"party of the year:\" the reading of the last will and testament of James Stenbeck. Meg questioned why Paul would want anything to do with his father, but Paul was angry and told her what was left of his mind was made up. Meg agreed to go with him to the reading of the will, provided he took his medication. She handed him the pill and went upstairs to get dressed. Paul tossed the medication into the waste basket. \n\n\nDusty got the same invitation for the reading of the will, and he asked Emily to join him. The two of them left for the appointment as Dusty claimed it was good to have a \"friend\" with him. Emily obviously questioned the use of the word, \"friend.\" \n\n\nPaul and Meg arrived at the office of a local lawyer, Walter Streenberg, who was handling the reading of James's will. Paul noticed an insignia on an urn, which turned out tohe learned contain contained the ashes of his father. He mentioned that the design matched the one on the cards his grandmother used to send him when he was a child, and Mr. Streenberg explained that the design was the Stenbeck family crest. Dusty and Emily arrived, much to Paul's displeasure. They all took seats around a large plasma television set. James appeared on the screen and guaranteed that if they were watching thisthe video, he was, indeed, dead. He explained that he had been poisoned in Thailand, but his doctors had assured him he had time to put his house in order. He continued by saying the Stenbeck fortune belonged to the true warrior and proper heir: winner takes all. He said the final battle would be between James's son, Paul Ryan, and Dusty Donovan, the true Stenbeck heir. He declared that if Dusty was alive and watching the broadcast, then he had won and inherited the Stenbeck fortune. To Paul, he simply said, \"Farewell.\" At the conclusion of the reading, Paul verbally attacked Dusty and then turned more violent. Meg restrained him, but Paul grabbed James's urn and left in a hurry, trailed by his wife. The lawyer apologized and told Dusty he would be in touch. \n\n\nLucinda arrived at the foundation meeting between Brian and Luke, who were waiting for the conference call, and told them about her unwelcome visit to Lily's. She asked Luke to talk to his mother on her behalf so that she could have the chance to spend time with her grandchildren. Brian agreed to cancel the conference call and reschedule, and Lucinda was grateful. Luke left to do his grandmother's bidding, and Lucinda and Brian shared a drink. Brian shocked her by telling her she was one controlling bitch. He felt, however, that Lily would eventually forgive her mother, and just then Lily walked in. Lily told her mother she was done with her and that Lucinda needed to stay away from her children, as well. She resented the fact that her mother had used Luke to intervene in the situation. Lucinda could no longer have a relationship with Lily or her family. Lily walked out, and Lucinda was upset. Brian gave her a hug. \n\n\nEmily and Dusty had a drink at the Lakeview bar, and she reminded him that he should be celebrating his newly found fortune. Dusty considered using the money to find Johnny. He was also worried about Paul's next move and how it might affect Meg. Emily declared that he always seemed to need a woman to save, but she recommended this time he pick someone other than Meg. \n\n\nPaul and Meg went home to Fairwinds, but Paul was in a foul mood. He was exhausted, and took James's urn to his bedroom. Meg intercepted a call from their accountant, who told her they were in serious financial trouble since Paul had \"borrowed\" funds from Worldwide to use for his personal debts. Meanwhile, James's specter joined Paul in the bedroom and chided him for not getting rid of Dusty Donovan when he had the chance. James said he got a kick out of the buried treasure scenario with which he had tortured Paul. Meg interrupted Paul and asked him to whom he had been speaking, but Paul said he was only talking to himself. This worried Meg, but Paul promised he would rest for a while, and Meg told him to sleep while she ran a couple of errands. \n\n\nMeg found Dusty at the bar while Emily was in the powder room. She told him that Paul had said something that she did not understand; he said James had been bleeding him dry financially but he was determined to get the money back. She explained that the accountant had described Paul's using Worldwide funds for his personal debts, and Dusty called that embezzlement. Meg swallowed her pride and begged him to help. Dusty said he would take care of her, and they hugged as Emily watched from the doorway. Dusty asked Meg to call him with the accountant's name and number so he could arrange to get him the money. He also asked Meg to take care of herself and her baby, in return. Meg left and Emily returned and asked Dusty not to do whatever he was contemplating. She told him that he was absolutely the last person Paul would want to bail him out, and she was afraid his plan would put Meg directly in the crossfire. Dusty reminded her that he had a savior complex. \n\n\nLily went home to Holden and told him what had transpired with her mother. Holden questioned her motives for cutting her mother out of her life. Was He asked if she was doing it because she wanted to free herself from her mother's interference, or was if her motivation was that Lucinda had effectively taken Dusty away from her? .\n\n\nMeg went home and comforted Paul and told him all she cared about was him. She just wanted to put all the misery of James Stenbeck behind them.\n\n\n",

Brian expresses his concern that if Luke's gay film festival is the place they need to hand out brochures to find investors. Luke tells Noah that he is Lucinda's grandson and he's going to do it anyway. Dusty doesn't like the fact that James is trying to buy the last word and warns Emily to just let this go. But he does invite her to go with him to the reading of James' will. Paul refuses to take more medication. He doesn't like what it does to him. He continues to see and hear ghost James. Meg doesn't want James' money in her house. But Paul insists he needs to be paid back for his losses. Lucinda tries to make amends with Lily but is promptly shown the door. She tells Holden for once she'd like Lucinda to face the consequences of her actions. Lucinda speaks with Luke and asks that he speak with Lily on her behalf. Lily tells Luke he has no obligation to speak for Lucinda and she is sorry to put him through that. Lily feels if she gives in to Lucinda then there is no telling what she might do. Paul has a problem with Dusty being at the will reading, but is told James wanted him there. The lawyer presents a video, and James declares he is really dead. He just wants to make sure the Steinbeck fortune goes to the proper heir. Paul is livid that Dusty is included in this and warns Dusty to leave Meg alone. He grabs the urn and leaves. Meg takes a phone call from the accountant who tells her they are about to lose everything. Ghost James tells Paul that he is a loser and will lose Meg. Dusty is less than enthusiastic to be the heir and beneficiary of a small fortune. Brian is a sympatric ear for Lucinda. Lily interrupts and tells Lily that she means it, she does not want Lucinda in her life anymore and not to come near her children either. Meg seeks out Dusty to beg him to help as Paul was depending on the inheritance to bail him out. Emily oversees as Meg thanks Dusty with an embrace. She tells Dusty this is cozy, but Paul will never accept Dusty's help so going through his wife is even worse.",
