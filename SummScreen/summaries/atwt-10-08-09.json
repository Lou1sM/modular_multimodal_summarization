He could not bear to think about disappointing Luke again by not showing up for a family event, but Mason discouraged his student from thinking about braving the elements.  As the thunder boomed and the lightning cracked, Mason asked Noah if he was afraid that Mason would make a pass at him.  He assured the boy that it would not happen, but Noah opened the car door anyway.\n\n\nHolden entered his house at the conclusion of the wedding, and he immediately collapsed.  Luke and Damian rushed to him and helped the exhausted man to the couch.  Holden apologized for passing out, and then he kissed Lily.  Lucinda beamed, but Damian wore a scowl.  Holden greeted his children, and Luke asked what had happened to him, but Holden was not ready to get into the long story just yet.  He refused to go to the hospital despite Lily's urgings, but he did ask what he had just walked in on.\n\n\nLily tried to distract Holden, but he wanted to know why everyone was dressed up.  Lily asked why her husband had not called, so Holden explained that a man named Eb Stone had held him captive in Kentucky after his truck crashed. Lily said she was happy to see him, but Holden became aware that he was in the midst of a wedding party.  He assumed that Damian was marrying Meg, but Lily began crying that they had thought Holden was dead and that Damian had held them all together.  Holden asked where Meg was, and Lily had to tell him that his sister was not the bride.\n\n\nHolden suddenly noticed a new wedding ring on Lily's finger and realized that his wife had just married Damian.  He staggered and sat down, as Lily rationalized that no one believed that anyone had survived the truck accident.  Lily wanted to take Holden to the hospital right away, but he said that they needed to talk first.  Damien put a proprietary hand on Lily's shoulder, and Holden became insistent about talking to Lily.  He also asked someone to call Emma and the rest of the Snyder family, and Luke volunteered.  He hugged his father and told him how much he loved him.\n\n\nThe girls helped their dad to the bedroom, as Lucinda got in Damian's face and asked if it was not the perfect moment for him to leave.  Lily reminded her mother that she was in Lily's house, and Damian was staying.  She also asked Lucinda to take the younger children to her house for the night, and Lucinda hugged Lily before she left.  Lily explained to Damian that she had to be with Holden, but Damian added \"for the time being,\" and he kissed the ring on her finger.\n\n\nAt the farm, Meg swept up the shattered plate she had smashed, as Jack walked in.  Meg was obviously in a foul mood, and Jack correctly guessed that \"Grimaldi\" was the cause of her bad temper.  Meg said that she saw Damian marrying Lily minutes  befor e, in spite of Damian's telling Meg that he loved her.  Jack agreed that what Damian had done was despicable, but what was done, was done.  Jack continued by saying that Damian was not the right man for Meg, but she could not let it go.  She blurted out that she would not be surprised if Damian had orchestrated Holden's accident, so a confused Jack asked if Damian was the guy she loved or the one who had plotted to kill her brother.\n\n\nMeg went so far as to suggest that perhaps Lily might have been involved, but Jack said that his cousin was being absurd.  Unfortunately, said Jack, there was absolutely no evidence against Damian.  Luke interrupted their conversation when h e burst into the kitchen and announced that Holden was alive and had returned home.\n\n\nMeg was overjoyed, but her questions to Luke were all about Damian and his reactions.  Jack could not believe Meg's response, and she wanted to rush to Lily's house, but Luke asked both of them to wait one day so that Holden could have some rest.  Meg offered to give Luke all the family numbers, but Jack was concerned with finding out who had detained Holden, and why.\n\n\nBack at Lily's, Holden was disgusted to find rose petals strewn on his bed.  He grabbed Lily and looked at the new ring on her finger and said, \"How could you?\"  Lily answered that she had been sure that Holden was dead, but he detailed a few of the horrors he had gone through and then commented on arriving home to see Lily wearing a new wedding ring and rose petals on his bed.  Lily sobbed about how awful it had been to mourn and bury her husband, but nothing she said lessened Holden's pain.  He asked her which of two situations had occurred: whether Damian had pushed Lily into marrying him that soon, or whether Lily had run to Damian the moment Holden went missing. \n\n\nLily took some of Holden's clothes back  into their bedroom, but he asked her for the answer to his query.  Lily said that she had been able to open up to Damian like no one else, and she talked about her pain.  Holden hugged her and apologized.  He also realized that Damian had seen Lily's vulnerability and had preyed upon her.  Lily denied that, so Holden asked if his wife loved Damian.  Lily said that she loved Damian in some ways, but not the way she loved Holden.\n\n\nHolden did not like that answer, and he said that normally Lily did not rush into things.  He asked if she had feelings for Damian before Holden had gone to Kentucky, but Lily said a definite no.  Holden went to take a shower alone, and Lily went downstairs and found Jack outside her door.  She let him in, and he explained that he had  many questions.  Lily said perhaps Holden would talk to Jack, because he certainly did not want to talk to her.  Jack went upstairs, and Lily grabbed a wrap and went out.\n\n\nJack and Holden hugged, and Jack said that Lily had been a wreck when Holden disappeared.  Holden told his cousin about being held captive by Eb Stone, and he was stunned to hear that Eb had died at Damian's hand in Holden's living room.  Then Holden told Jack that Maeve, Eb's wife, had also been one of Eb's victims.  Jack said that Emma was getting home as quickly as she could, and the two hugged again.  Jack left so that Holden could get some sleep, but instead, Holden ripped the covers off the bed, scattering the rose petals everywhere.\n\n\nHolden got in the shower, and Luke returned home.  Noah finally arrived and hugged Luke.  Noah apologized for missing the wedding, and then he asked where everyone was.  Luke explained that Holden had returned right after the ceremony, and Noah was excited.  Then Noah asked how Damian was taking it, and Luke said that Damian had lost Lily for good.\n\n\nThe boys went to Java, and Luke said that his mother and Damian would have to annul their marriage, but he questioned whether Lily and Holden could just pick up where they had left off.  Mason walked in and apologized to Luke for getting Noah back so late.  He also informed Noah that the quarry had confirmed the location shoot, so the film was good to go.  After Mason left, Luke mentioned that he had not known that Noah had been with Mason during the storm.  He asked his boyfriend why he had not mentioned it.\n\n\nNoah said that Mason had given him a ride to the quarry, and then the car had broken down.  Noah had not mentioned it because he had not wanted to upset Luke.  Luke decided that he had another errand to run, so he walked out.  Soon Mason returned and said that he hoped he had not made Noah's bad situation worse.  Mason began hinting that Noah was the one Luke did not trust, not Mason, and that angered Noah.  He finally told Mason that he and Luke were none of his business, and their conversations should be limited strictly to school business.\n\n\nDamian began drinking in the Lakeview bar, and Meg arrived.  She called it \"amazing\" that her brother had returned from the dead, but Damian was less than enthusiastic.  Meg said that she was sorry that Damian's future was not shaping up as he had envisioned, but Damian was not receptive to her words.  He finally asked her what she wanted from him, and he got up to leave.  Meg stopped him and said he would bounce back if he would just let Lily go.  Damian headed for his room.\n\n\nDamian continued drowning his sorrows in his room, but he answered a knock on the door.  His visitor was Lily, and Damian embraced her.  Lily said she wanted Damian to know that Holden's return changed everything forever.  She said her relationship with Holden was not temporary; she had made a commitment to him a long time before and she should not have moved on so quickly.  Lily said that she knew in her soul that Holden was alive, but she had let fear and emotions crowd it out.  She tried to leave, but Damian stopped her with a kiss.  They moved to the couch, and Lily could not deny that she loved Damian.\n\n\nLily finally said that she was staying with her husband.  She dashed out of the room, and Damian went back to the couch and fingered his wedding ring.  Luke knocked on the door and told Damian that he was very sorry that things had not worked out for him.\n\n\nMeg stayed in the bar at the Lakeview after Damian left, and she saw Lucinda walk up.  Meg approached and asked if she had been at Lily's when Holden had returned.  Lucinda said that Holden was weak and exhausted, and she mentioned that she thought Meg might have more important things to do that evening.  Meg said that Damian could not stop talking about Lily, but Lucinda said that she was sure that her daughter and Holden would reconcile.\n\n\nMeg went home after talking with Lucinda, and she was drinking tea when Jack returned from seeing Holden.  Jack was unhappy about the shoddy work the police had done following Holden's accident, and he said that he would \"damn sure\" find out who was responsible.\n\n\nHolden went back downstairs after his shower and found Faith there.  She said she could not sleep at Lucinda's, so her grandmother's driver had driven her home.  She wanted to find out what was going to happen, so Holden said that he and Lily would work things out.  Faith went to her room, as Holden answered the phone.  The caller was Renee, the nurse at the hospital in Kentucky, and she said she was calling to tell Holden that Maeve was in trouble.\n\n\nLily returned and found that Holden was not in their bed and the bed was torn apart.  She slumped to the floor and looked at the scattered rose petals.\n\n\n",
