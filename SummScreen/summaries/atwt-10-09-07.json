She backs off and apologizes, telling him she is scared, but Jack interrupts her with a kiss. After kissing, each back away and are silent. They say nothing, but look into each other's eyes as he helps get her comfortable on the couch.\n\n\nCarly starts to speak, but Jack tells her to rest. He goes to leave, but Carly tells him to wait. She thanks him for everything. He leaves but sits outside her house looking conflicted. He goes to go the door. Inside Carly is replaying their kiss and senses him outside the door. She opens the door, but he isn't there.\n\n\nThe doorbell rings; it's Brad. They are talking, when JJ comes home. She wants to know how it went at the studio. He hangs his head saying it was just ok. Brad tells him to finish up with his school project in the kitchen. Brad filled Carly in on what happened with Katie and JJ. Carly says that Katie is acting like she owns JJ and she doesn't blame him for being upset, but Brad tells her that she needs to let go of her anger. She tells Brad that she knows that Jack still loves her- and she feels it stronger than she ever did before; but it's too late now to do anything about it. \n\n\nShe said that she thinks she is getting what she deserves. She feels it is divine justice that she and Jack spent so much time denying how they felt and now they have no time left. Brad tells her he doesn't care about that- he just doesn't want her to die. She says that but for the dying part it would almost be worth it. \n\n\nAt WOAK JJ is telling Katie that he thinks she is waiting for Carly to die so she can be with Jack. Katie tells him that it's not true. She points out that she and Carly were once friends, but JJ doesn't believe her. A hurt Katie tells JJ how much she cares for all of them, but JJ tells her that if she really cared about Jack she would let him go be with the person he really loves. \n\n\nKatie tells JJ that he is right; Jack does still love Carly, but that he is in love with her. JJ tells her that she just wishes this was true but she was wrong. Just then Brad intercepts and tells JJ that even though he has a lot to deal with, he is out of line. Brad tries to tell Katie that this isn't about her and that JJ doesn't hate her. Katie tries to defend JJ, but an upset Brad tells her that he shouldn't be treating her like this and goes to talk to him. \n\n\nIn the WOAK office Brad tells JJ that what is happening to Carly really stinks, but this isn't how to handle it. He told him that Katie is trying to make an awful situation more bearable for him, but JJ tells Brad that she can't and should stop trying. Brad tells him that Katie really cares for him. JJ says \"whatever\" but Brad tells him that if he wants to take shots at someone; take them at him. JJ gets his anger out hitting Brad but soon is sobbing in his arms. \n\n\nJJ and Brad came out of the office and JJ apologized to Katie and went out to the car. Katie hugged Brad. She thanked him for helping with JJ. She told him that lately he has really been there for her. Brad told her it was no big deal. Katie told him it was nice to see another side of him. She smiled at him as she left. \n\n\nKatie arrives back at the room at The Lakeview and Jack is already there waiting for her. She starts telling him about what happened, but Jack is preoccupied. She asks him if something happened at Carly's. He tells her something did. He tells Katie how he found Carly on the floor and that Carly had asked him to kiss her. Katie is shocked, but tells him that she isn't upset, but rather embarrassed for him and assumes that he told her no- but he tells her that he did kiss Carly and it was a real kiss. Jack knows Katie is upset but tells her it was just one kiss. Katie tries to brush it off, saying that she doesn't blame Carly. She goes to give Jack a kiss, but backs away when she sees his face. She asks him if the kiss meant something, but Jack said that he doesn't know. He tells her he is feeling things that were supposed to be gone and admits that he has feelings for Carly. He tells her that he gave up on Carly a long time ago, but when he found her on the floor everything came flooding back. He wants to save her, but can't. He admits that doesn't know if he kissed her to help Carly forget she is sick, or to make himself feel better. Katie tells Jack that if he still has feelings for Carly, where does that leave her?\n\n\nIn Old Town Rosanna leaves Paul a voice message. She turns and literally runs right into Craig. He comments on her and Paul's upcoming wedding and asks her where Paul is. She tells Craig that Paul must be with Barbara telling her about their wedding. Craig says they should all celebrate, but Rosanna said that Meg still carried a torch for Paul. Craig disputes this and says that he trusts Meg. Rosanna told him that he should trust her since there was no way Paul would do anything with her now. Craig asks her that if she is so confident about Paul, why doesn't she give Montgomery Enterprises back to him. But Rosanna told him that it is too soon and Paul would become suspicious. She told him that until Meg becomes pregnant she won't give him back the company. She tells him that she is sure Meg is honorable enough to not cheat on the father of her child, but Craig asks Rosanna if she is sure that Paul won't chase a married woman. Rosanna told Craig that there was only room for one married woman in his life; her. \n\n\nAt the cabin Meg and Paul embrace after making love. Meg suddenly tries to leave saying that she shouldn't be there, but Paul grabs her, they kiss and she is easily convinced to stay. Paul tells her how beautiful she and tells her about the moment he fell in love with her and tells her he loves her. He tells her that he tried not to- tried to hate her, but couldn't. He told her that he gives up. He laments the things he said to her, but after fighting so hard to get back to her and finding her with Craig was really difficult. Meg told him that she had no place to go- when she thought she had lost him- she lost herself. Paul told her that he hopes they can get past it, because he now sees that it doesn't matter if she is married to Craig; she belongs with him. He said that Craig will finally know what it feels like to lose. Meg abruptly left the bed leaving a puzzled Paul. She tells Paul that she is leaving because he can't let it go; Craig.\n\n\nPaul pleads with Meg to talk to him, but she refuses. She tells him that he only wants her so Craig can't have her. Paul tells her that she is leaving not because she is scared by how much he hates Craig, but because she is scared of how much he loves her. \n\n\nPaul tells her that he knows Craig doesn't love her or touch her the way he does but she is safe because her heart is already taken.  Meg angrily tells him that his heart is also taken- by Rosanna. She tells him that if he loved her he wouldn't have asked Rosanna to marry him and she can't afford to love someone who would do that. She leaves the cabin. \n\n\nAn angry Paul storms into Al's looking for Meg, but instead finds Rosanna. She tells him that she is surprised to see him and that she had been trying to reach him for hours. He tells her that his phone didn't ring. Rosanna tells him that he was with Meg; wasn't he? Paul denies this. Rosanna apologizes and tells him that she saw Meg earlier and told her that she was only with Craig because Paul didn't want her and she told her about their wedding date. Paul said that he was glad she told her.  Rosanna said she had to drop a package for Carly off to Jack at the station so Paul said he would go with her. As they go to leave she notices a leaf in Paul's collar. They both nervously act as if it's nothing. \n\n\nIn Old Town Craig meets up with Meg and gives her a gift he just bought for her; a negligee. Putting it away, Meg tells him it's an inappropriate gift to open in Old Town. Craig suggests they go home so she can put it on, but Meg is less than thrilled. Craig then tells her that they aren't going anywhere until she tells him what's wrong. He affectionately touches her head but she pulls in away in pain. She tells him that she went for a walk in the woods and was hit over the head by someone. Upset, Craig wants to know who did this. He insists that they go to the police and won't take no for an answer.\n\n\nAt the Oakdale police station Craig tells officers that his wife was attacked and he wants to file a report. Paul overhears and wants to know what happened; he has a cabin in those woods and has a right to know.  Meg leaves to freshen up before giving her statement. Craig tells Paul to go home to Rosanna. In the hall Meg asks Paul what he is doing. She tells him that they are over and that if he brings up what happened to her or Craig, he will be very sorry. She goes back into the station. Rosanna joins Paul after leaving the package for Jack and is ready to go. They happily kiss and leave as Meg watches through the door.  \n\n\n",
