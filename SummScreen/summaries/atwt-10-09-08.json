Emily would tell her mother nothing, but Susan nagged her to stay away from that troublemaker. \n\n\nDusty was also at Memorial getting his gunshot wound checked, and the examining nurse told him he had a fever and would have to wait to see a doctor. Meg called him while he was waiting, and Dusty assured her that he had paid back all of Paul's debts to Worldwide. As he continued to wait, Alison ran in, delighted to see her old friend, and she thanked him for his generosity in leaving her money for nursing school. She told him sadly that she had done everything else in her life wrong, including her marriage. The doctor came in and Alison learned that Dusty had been the victim of a gunshot, courtesy of Paul Ryan. The doctor gave Dusty a couple of prescriptions for antibiotic pills and ointment, and Alison offered to get them filled. Meg called back, fearful that Paul could trace the money Dusty had paid, but Dusty assured her no one could pin it on him. Dusty decided to wait out in the hall, and there he ran into Susan, who warned him to stay away from Emily. She threatened him that the next time he died, he would stay dead. \n\n\nPaul visited Lucinda at Worldwide to ask her to intervene with the board of directors to see if they could give him some time to pay back the money he \"borrowed.\" Lucinda felt she owed Paul a favor, since he was the one who actually saved Ethan from the sinkhole, and she told Paul he owed nothing because the funds had been transferred back to the company that very morning. Paul said he had not paid it, and Lucinda joked that he must have a fairy godmother lurking out there somewhere. Paul took the money transfer paper with him and ran out to try to identify his unknown benefactor. \n\n\nAaron talked to his father and revealed that Alison had slept with Chris the day before their wedding. Aaron had no idea what to do, and Holden explained it would take time for him to feel forgiveness. Aaron asked if Holden was over Lily's affair with Dusty. Holden said that if his marriage was to work, he had to trust Lily. Aaron was not sure that Alison still loved him. \n\n\nCasey explained to Margo why Emily had called off their relationship. He said the worst part was that Emily did not want his input on her decision about her tubal ligation. He was trying to amuse himself by playing outrageously loud rock music on his electric guitar. \n\n\nAlison and Emily saw each other in the hospital corridor and talked about Dusty, something that irritated Susan. Alison figured out her mother had scared Dusty away, since he was nowhere to be found, so Emily took the antibiotics and offered to drop them off at the Lakeview on her way to work. Alison took a call from Aaron, who asked to meet with her at the coffee shop, so she left for there. When she arrived, Aaron told her he was not ready to lose her yet, and she apologized for hurting him over and over. She was afraid their relationship had to be over for both their sakes, so Aaron accepted that and walked out. Casey came in and sat with Alison as she explained that she had just ended her marriage. Casey made a crack about the irresistible Stewart women, and the two commiserated together until Casey had a brainstorm and whisked Alison away. \n\n\nAt the Snyder farm, Lucinda asked Holden to intervene for her with Lily, but he refused. Lucinda did not understand that Lily did not want her mother interfering in her life any longer. She offered Holden some psychobabble about Lily's anger and sexual frustration at Dusty's return, but Holden did not buy it. They argued loudly until Lucinda lost her cool and, as she was leaving, bumped into Margo. Margo told Holden she wanted to nail Dusty for conspiracy and was fishing to find out how involved Holden was. Someone had obviously helped Dusty fake his death and disappear, and Margo was going to find that person. She strongly hinted that Lucinda was a real possibility to be Dusty's confederate. \n\n\nPaul talked to Meg by phone and explained that someone had paid his debts, and he suspected a trap. He then called his accountant, who had no answers either. Next, he waylaid Emily in the lobby of the Lakeview and asked her to use her reporting skills to find out who had provided the funds. He even threatened her job until Emily brushed him off and told him to go ask his wife. Emily continued up to Dusty's room and delivered his medications. The two of them laughed together as she applied the antibiotic ointment to his shoulder. Dusty brought up the last time they had slept together before he \"died,\" and as he kissed her, Emily remembered her mother's warning. She also remembered that she never minded her mother, and the two of them began to make love. Afterwards, they each assured the other that there was trust between them. \n\n\nPaul went home to Fairwinds and pressured Meg into telling him that Dusty had saved them financially. At Meg's response, Paul surprised her by embracing her instead of becoming angry. Meg went on to explain that Dusty would use the rest of his inheritance to track down Lucy and Johnny. Meg handed her husband his medication and then went upstairs to rest, and Paul promised to join her soon. Paul threw his meds into the trash again, and James materialized behind him. His father told Paul that Dusty and Meg wanted to be together, so Paul had to get rid of Dusty for good. Paul maintained that the person he had to get rid of was James. Paul reconsidered and took two of his pills, hoping that would make the vision vanish. Then James suggested that Meg, a nurse, might be poisoning Paul's medicine so that she could be with Dusty. James handed Meg's purse to Paul and asked him to check it. \n\n\nUpstairs, Meg called Dusty to tell him that Paul had figured out who had paid off the debt, and then she went back downstairs to get her purse. Paul took a piece of paper from the purse and put it in his pocket without her seeing it, and then informed her that he had to go out of town for a quick trip but she was not to worry. Meg was not happy about that, but she could tell that Paul was rational, so she went back upstairs. Paul pulled the paper from his pocket and read on it the name of the private investigator with whom Dusty was working. \n\n\nCasey took Alison to his house to cheer her, and the two of them turned on the loud music and electric guitars and began to rock out.\n\n\n",
