Carly told Parker that they didn't care about the storm because they were going to celebrate the check she got from Paul Ryan for redesigning BRO's Spring line.  She drank a toast to the two of them and then she and Parker began to dance.  \n\n\nCraig walked in.  Carly told him he couldn't just barge in any time he wanted.  He looked at the bottle of wine on the table and asked her what they were celebrating.  He offered to cook dinner for them.  After Craig sweet talked Carly, she told him that he should show his soft side more often, that maybe everyone wouldn't hate him so much.  He said he didn't care about anyone else, he only had one person he cared about.  He started to kiss her when she noticed that Parker knocked her sketches on the floor.  Craig offered to help pick them up, but she said she was teaching Parker responsibility and he should pick up things that he knocked over.  She asked Craig if he didn't have things to do in the kitchen.  As she was picking up the sketches, Craig saw her from the kitchen and didn't like that she was keeping secrets.  \n\n\nWhen Carly was sitting on the couch with Parker, Craig came out of the kitchen and asked if it wasn't about time for Parker to go to bed.  When Carly left to put Parker in bed, Craig began looking for what she was hiding.  Carly came back in the room and wanted to know what Craig was doing at her desk.  Craig said he was sorry.  She said she smelled something in the kitchen.  His chicken dinner was burned and he suggested Chinese food.  Carly suggested that it was time for him to leave.  When he asked to stay, she told him he could, but only until he cleaned up the kitchen.  The city lights went out.  Craig held out his hand for Carly and she took it.  \n\n\nLucinda's Guest House:\n\nJack was outside the guesthouse with a flashlight, looking for James Stenbeck.  Mitzi heard him and opened the door and asked, \"Who's there.\"  Jack said \"it's me\" and he was sorry that he disturbed her.  She wanted to know what he was doing.  He told her he was checking out the property to make sure it was safe.  She wasn't buying it and asked him to clue her in.  They went inside and he told her that on the night of Jake and Molly's wedding, he thought he saw someone he knew in the shadows and he was trying to make sure that he didn't imagine it.  Mitzi wanted to know what would happen if he didn't imagine it.  He said that a lot of people could be in danger.  Mitzi wanted to know how Jack knew so much about James.  He told her about working undercover for the FBI years ago.  She was impressed and told him that he was a G-man and a hero for what he did at the wedding.  He didn't think he was a hero and explained that what he had done recently, he now realized was stupid.  \n\n\nThe Munson's House:\n\nWill asked Hal if his mom really wanted to see him and Jennifer.  Hal said he was sure.  Will asked Hal if he thought that his mom would want to move back with them.  Hal said he didn't think so.  Will then asked if Hal thought he would be afraid of Barbara because she looked different.  Hal told him that Barbara has some scars and that it will be strange at first but he'll see that inside she is still the same Mom and she still loves him very much.  Will wondered if Barbara would like it if he made her a get-well card on the computer.  Hal thought that Barbara would like it a lot.  \n\n\nJava Underground:\n\nJennifer told Bryant that she had something to tell him about Billy.  She asked him if he knew how upset she was when he told her about the trust fund.  He told her that he did.  She said she didn't want him to feel that way about her if she kept something from him.  He said he didn't think she would ever do that and he wanted to know what it had to do with Billy.  She asked if he remembered the day she moved out of the cottage.  He said he did and she told him that something happened that day and that she and Billy didn't plan it.  She began to tell him what she and Billy had done, when Billy walked in and told them that he should be the one to tell Bryant.  He said that he's had a tough time telling Bryant, but he was going to leave and to go California.  Jennifer's cell phone rang.  It was Hal telling her that Barbara wanted to see her and Will.  She was elated and said she'd be right there.  She told Bryant about Barbara wanting to see her and Will.  He was happy for her.  After she left, Bryant asked Billy why he really was leaving.  \n\n\nLater, Bryant asked Abigail why he was the last to know about Billy.  She thought Bryant knew about Billy and Jennifer having sex and was surprised when he asked her to try to convince Billy to stay in town.  She told him that she could talk to Billy but she was sure he had made up his mind to leave.  She felt uncomfortable knowing that she knew about Billy and Jennifer and Bryant didn't.  She said that she had to leave and asked him to tell Adam to give her a call when he got there.  \n\n\nWOAK TV Studio:\n\nNick was showing Abigail how to edit her film.  She was thrilled with the results.  Nick told her how much talent she had.  She couldn't wait to show Adam the film.  \n\n\nFairwinds:\n\nBarbara was walking in her garden thinking about her children.  James was hiding and watching her.  She smelled his cigar and though it was another fire and panicked.  When Hal, Jennifer and Will arrived, he heard Barbara in the garden.  She told him she heard someone and was frightened.  Hal tried to comfort her and said they should go inside.  Barbara told Will and Jennifer that she was so glad to see them.  Jennifer gave her some flowers, which made Barbara happy.  Will gave her the card that he made.  She read what he had to say in the card and was thrilled to hear that he missed her.  When she bent down to give him a hug, he backed away from her and said he wanted to go home.  He and Hal left the room and Barbara was crushed.  Jennifer tried to comfort her.  Hal and Will came back in the room and said that they were ready to visit.  Barbara held her hand out for Will but he was scared and wouldn't take it.  Barbara started to cry and said that it was a mistake for them to come and told them all to leave.  Jennifer told her it wasn't a mistake for them to come.  Barbara told her that she and Will were better off without her.  Jennifer asked her not to push them away and that if she didn't stop; she may not ever come back.  Barbara told her that she was looking forward to that day.  Jennifer ran out.  Barbara told Hal to go after her, that she and Will will need him more than ever because their mother was dead.  \n\n\n   Bryant's Cottage:\n\nJennifer walked in and saw Billy.  She told Billy what happened with her Mom.  She felt guilty for yelling at Barbara.  When Billy told her that Bryant wasn't there, she told him that she came to see him not Bryant.  \n\n\nThe Munson's House:\n\nWill asked Hal if he'd ever see his Mom again.  Hal tried to explain it was going to take some time and that it wasn't his fault that Barbara wanted them to leave.  \n\n\nFairwinds:\n\nBarbara was frightened by the storm and was trying to yell, \"help\" but the words wouldn't come out.  \n\n\n",
