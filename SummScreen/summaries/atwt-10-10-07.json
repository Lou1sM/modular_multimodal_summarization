Lily goes into Luke's room and checks in on him before leaving the hospital for a few minutes to talk to Holden.   Once she and the nurse are out of his room Colonel Mayer sneaks in and looms over Luke's bed and begins to fiddle with his I.V. when the nurse walks in and tells him to leave the room unless he is family.  Away from the hospital, Lily has met up with Holden at Al's Diner and questions whether Holden believes she intentionally withheld information knowing that Luke might be hurt.  Holden tells Lily she should have told him that Colonel Mayer was a potential threat, but he knows she wouldn't knowingly put Luke in danger.  When Lily begins to cry, Holden starts to reach out to support her, but pulls back.  Holden says he will be a \"united front\" in front of Luke because he needs them, but that their fight is not over.  Lily leaves to go back to the hospital while Holden pays his check. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, the Colonel is outside of Luke's room in the hall and finds a syringe on a cart.  When the nurse leaves again he goes back in and stands over Luke holding the syringe.  Luke wakes up and sees the Colonel standing over his bed with the needle as Lily walks in and screams at the Colonel to get away from her son.  She fights with him over the needle and as she starts to lose Dusty bursts in and grabs the Colonel and tells Lily to get out.  Dusty knocks the Colonel out as Lily arrives with the police and the Colonel is arrested.  Dr. Bob enters the room to find out what happens and sends Lily and Dusty out so he can check Luke and make sure he is o.k.  Out in the hall Lily cries in Dusty's arms as Holden appears and witnesses the two.  He rushes over and asks Lily what is going on and she explains.  Dr. Bob comes out and tells everyone that Luke is disoriented, but fine and wants to see his mom and Holden.  Inside they find Luke wondering why he is in the hospital.  Lily asks him to recount what he remembers and he recalls the fishing trip and asks if Noah is o.k.  Lily and Holden explain to Luke about the Colonel attacking him and Cheri being Noah's mom.  Luke is concerned for Noah and asks to go and see him, but   Lily and Holden explain he needs rest.  Luke agrees saying that he must be tired because he feels numb and really can't feel his legs.  Concerned over what Luke has said Lily immediately seeks out Dr. Bob.  \n\n\nNoah is interrogated by Margo at the police station and he explains his father would never hurt anyone and that something must be wrong with him.  Margo shows Noah a picture of Cheri and asks him if he knows who she is.  Margo is called out on a phone call and Noah stares at the picture and wonders why Margo is questioning him about a dead hooker.   When Margo returns she explains that the woman in the photo is named Charlene Wilson and she was Noah's mother.  Noah is shocked by the news and at first doesn't believe Margo.  She quickly convinces him that Cheri was his mom and that Dusty wasn't not her killer, but his father was.  \n\n\nAfter his arrest at the hospital, Colonel Mayer is brought to the station where Noah confronts him about the true identity of his mother.   The Colonel says it was the right thing to do and that Cheri didn't deserve to be his mother.  Dusty arrives at the station and overhears their conversation.  He tries to explain to Noah that he killed Cheri and tried to kill Luke to protect him and turn him into a \"strong and decent man.\"  Dusty watches as Noah walks out on his father and Margo orders the Colonel booked for Cheri's murder.  Dusty goes to find Noah who apologizes for what his father did and Dusty reassures him he is not responsible for what his dad did.  Dusty asks if he has anywhere to go or anyone to talk to and encourages him to go see Luke because Luke needs him. \n\n\nAt the hospital Noah arrives in time to see Dr. Bob asking Luke to move his legs, but Luke is unable to move and begins to wonder loudly what is wrong with him.  \n\n\nCarly calls to say good night to Sage and reminds her to say her prayers.  Talking to Sage inspires Carly to get down on her knees and ask God for a long healthy life with Jack and her children.   Carly tries to bargain with God to save her for Jack and the kids and asks God shows her to show her a sign through a bible verse that will tell her whether she will live or die.  She reads a verse about love and not being able to see it and becomes frustrated and asks for a concrete sign just as the phone rings.  The call is from her doctor who tells her he needs to see her right away and will drop by with some news.   The doctor arrives at Carly's house and informs her that she may not have a lesion at all, but an abscess that may prove to not be deadly.   He explains the headaches and dizziness are caused by the abscess and that he is certain that she was misdiagnosed.  He reassures her that she can be treated with antibiotics and in a couple of weeks she will be fine.  Carly is overjoyed with the news and looks to the heavens and says a simple \"Thank you.\"\n\n\nBack at their hotel room Katie asks Jack what the kiss between him and Carly really meant.  Katie cries over Jacks betrayal as he tries to justify that kissing Carly didn't mean anything because he will be with Katie for the rest of his life, but he can't deny that he still loves Carly.   Katie questions if losing Carly will leave her filling an empty space in Jack's life and she leaves the room in tears.   Jack tells Katie he loves her and he will try to make everything easier, but he can't change how he feels about Carly.  Katie offers to get Carly help so she and Jack can have a little more time together and Jack tells her that Carly needs him.   Katie tells him she doesn't want him to turn his back on Carly and she knows he needs to be with Carly, but she can't watch him always go to Carly and asks him to move out.  She explains that she understands that Carly and the kids need him, but that she can't put herself through imagining what he and Carly are doing and it will be easier if she isn't waiting, counting the minutes, until he is home.  She begs him to put her first in this situation and he agrees and leaves.\n\n\nJack arrives at Carly's house after leaving Katie and she begins to tell him about her good news, but Jack thinks Carly is acting a little crazy and seems flushed so he asks her to calm down and takes her temperature.  Once Carly is seated she asks Jack why he is back and learns that Jack told Katie about the kiss and that she has asked Jack for time apart.  Jack leaves to get Carly some water and she smiles to the heavens.   Carly apologizes that her illness came between him and Katie, but Jack explains it wasn't the illness, but his feelings for Carly that came between him and Katie.  Jack asks Carly to tell him about her good news and she tells him she will let him know later.  Jack rubs Carly's shoulders and tells her he will help her through this all she needs to do is ask. Carly tells Jack to stay with her and he accepts, saying he has no where else to be.  \n\n\nKatie goes to the lounge after Jack's departure and runs into Henry.  She tells him everything and Henry tries to console her, but Katie explains she can't wait for Carly to die so that Jack will love her.
