Jen is scared, thinking it's Bryant, but it is a stranger asking for directions.  She and Billy talk about what they would do if Bryant caught them.  Jen tells Billy she needs him and does not want him to go back to California.  He tells her he's not leaving until the end of the week and they will be able to see each other again as long as they are careful.\n\n\nPaul and Carly argue because she lied to him about Craig being at her apartment.  Paul tells her he can't work with her unless he can trust her, so Carly tells him the deal is off.  She then points out that Craig is naturally curious about what might be going on between her and Paul.  Paul tells her he needs her and wants their deal to continue.  He asks her why she has been willing to sacrifice so much for Craig.  Carly insists that she and Craig are just friends and that she doesn't feel anything else for him.   Paul admits that he really doesn't understand why women are attracted to Craig.  He warns Carly that Craig will get under her skin in order to get what he wants and then he'll discard her.  Carly insists that nothing like that will happen because she doesn't have romantic feelings for Craig.  Paul tells her she is not being honest with herself and her face gives her away every time she talks about Craig.  Paul then asks Carly for some kind of guarantee that Craig won't be able to go through her to destroy BRO.  Carly shows Paul her designs and tells him that if he doesn't like the sketches, she'll resign, return his check, and they will end their agreement.  However, if he does like the sketches, she wants him to butt out of her relationship with Craig.  Paul really loves Carly's sketches and tells her he will trust her from now on.  Carly then tells Paul she wants him to give her some kind of guarantee that she can trust him and asks him if he has told Barbara yet about their agreement.  Paul makes numerous excuses, but Carly insists that Paul has to tell his mother about their agreement as proof he can be trusted.    \n\n\nBarbara tries to convince Jack that nothing is wrong and that he doesn't need to search her house or grounds.  Jack is suspicious and asks Barbara why she is trying to get rid of him.  Barbara lies and tells him she was just shaken up by the kids' visit, but he can leave because she is okay now.  As Jack leaves, James comes back in the room and tells Barbara she is a magnificent liar.  Barbara orders James to tell her what he knows about Paul's behavior and then get out of her house.  She tells James she is not going to play games and he can either tell her what he knows or get out and leave her alone.  She promises to destroy James if he tries to double-cross her and lets him know that she doesn't trust him.   James plays on Barbara's insecurities and warns her that the woman Paul is talking to will manipulate him and use him to steal BRO.  Barbara thinks James is talking about Rose and he does not tell her she is mistaken.  James then tells Barbara that her sketches are marvelous and he doesn't understand why she hasn't shown them to Paul.  Barbara can't figure out why Rose would want to steal BRO from her and James reassures her they will find out.  Barbara again tells James she doesn't trust him and will call the police if he ever comes back to her house.  As the lights come back on, Barbara turns around, but James is gone!    \nAbigail goes over to Jennifer's house looking for Adam.  She thinks he might be at Bryant and Billy's cottage, but Jen insists he isn't.  Abigail asks how she knows and Jen confesses that she and Billy had sex again.  She tries to explain what is going on to Abigail, but admits that she doesn't really understand it herself.  Abigail tells Jen that she has to tell Bryant about Billy, but Jen says she doesn't want to hurt him.  She finally agrees that she will talk to Bryant after she talks to Billy again.    \n\n\nBryant returns home to find Billy lying in the dark.  Billy lies to him about seeing Jennifer and tries to get Bryant to go to Yo's with him.  Bryant refuses because he has bought Jen a gift and wants to give it to her.  He asks Billy if he thinks Jen might be seeing someone else.  Billy lies again and says he doesn't know Jen well enough to answer.  Bryant tells Billy that Jen seems very preoccupied all the time and is very distant with him when he sees her.  He asks Billy what he would do and Billy avoids the question by trying to get Bryant to go play pool with him.  Bryant turns him down.\n\n\nJen tries to justify her behavior with Billy to Abigail.  Abigail advises Jen to tell Bryant the truth and be with Billy out in the open as a couple if they really feel so strongly about each other.  Jen tells Abigail she loves Bryant, but her feelings for Billy have caused her to feel really confused.  Abigail asks Jen what she really knows about Billy and she shows Abigail the box Billy made for her.  She tells Abigail that she doesn't know how she would feel if Bryant slept with someone else, but she would kill Billy if he did.  Bryant shows up at Jennifer's and Abigail leaves.    \nHe gives Jennifer a silver heart-shaped locket and she tells him she wishes he had not done that.  He gets affectionate with her, but she avoids his embrace.  Jen uses the excuse that she is still very upset about her mother.  Bryant reassures Jen that she can talk to him about anything and he wants them to have some time alone as soon as Billy leaves.  After Bryant leaves, Jen takes off the necklace and gets out the box Billy made for her.  She holds one in each hand and looks from one to the other.\n\n\nCarly tears up her revised sketches.  She tells Paul that their agreement is over unless he tells Barbara about it.  She also tells him she doesn't want to talk to him again until he has told his mother about their agreement.  As Paul leaves, Carly looks at herself in the mirror and says, \"Who says I can't bluff?\"    \n\n\nBarbara looks for James, but he is gone.  She looks at her sketches and tells herself that Paul will like them.  She also intends to make sure that Rose doesn't see them.\n\n\nJack examines the grounds around Barbara's house even though she told him not to.  As he searches the gardens, he discovers the cigar James threw on the ground. \n\n\n",
