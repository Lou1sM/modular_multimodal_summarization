But, he starts to sweat when Hal reveals that Jack is a cop. Later, fake documents are found in Blackmoor's apartment and Hal is able to threaten Blackmoor with prison unless he talks. Meanwhile, Carly and Rosanna are at the rest stop when Hal calls with the news that Jack has a fake Kentucky drivers license. Hal orders Carly to come back to St. Genevieve and let the police handle this, but Carly insists she can't. Carly hitches a ride in the cab of a semi-truck when she overhears the St. Genevieve Police Chief report to Hal that a woman matching Julia's description was seen at a convenience store near Louisville. Carly tells the driver to put the pedal to the metal to Louisville. Meanwhile, Jack, Julia and JJ arrive at the Triple Crown motel in Louisville.

When the orderly finally goes they rejoice that they have the impressions of the keys needed to escape. An adrenaline pumped Rick grabs Barbara and kisses her! Barbara deflects his passion, arguing that if they were caught, they would be separated, saying that they have to concentrate on getting the keys made and getting out. Eager to please her, Rick says he's made friends with a janitor, Alfonso, who has done Rick some favors in the past for a fee. Barbara will pay anything for those keys, but when they approach Alfonso, he flat out refuses. Even Barbara's offer of thousands isn't enough to get him to risk his pension or time in jail. Just as they feel all is lost, Barbara sees a flyer for a ceramics class and gets an idea. She has some gold jewelry in her room that she can melt down in the kiln and use to make the keys. She sneaks off to the arts and crafts room, leaving Rick more enamored than ever. Barbara returns and reports she successfully made the keys and is just waiting for them to harden. Rick waxes on about them being together when they escape and suggests they get married. Barbara has no intention of doing anything of the sort, but leads him on. Later and alone, she takes out a picture of Will and smiles.\n\n\nAs Aaron works behind the bar, Dominic comes in to Dusty and demands that he sign up Aaron to fight. Dusty's not happy about it, but doesn't have another alternative. Dusty reluctantly offers Aaron the deal and, despite Dusty's attempts to dissuade him, Aaron accepts just as Lucy arrives to hear it. Dusty apologizes to Lucy for breaking his promise, but explains that he didn't have a choice. He needed a fighter, and Aaron wanted to do it. Lucy worries that Aaron isn't a professional fighter, and that she keeps hearing how good Dominic's guy is. Dusty promises her that Aaron will be ready to do what he has to do and Lucy accepts that Aaron is a big boy who can make his own decision. Later, as guest singer Ryan Cabrera takes the stage and begins his song, Dusty takes Lucy in his arms and they dance.\n\n\nAlison approaches a customer only to discover, when the menu lowers, that its Emily. When Alison refuses to take her order, Emily becomes such a demanding customer that Alison has no choice and sits down to talk. Emily makes a heartfelt appeal for Alison's forgiveness, citing Alison's mistake of sleeping with Aaron and comparing that to Emily's kiss with Chris. She begs Alison not to cut her out of her life and just when it looks like Alison might forgive her, she gets up and walks away.
