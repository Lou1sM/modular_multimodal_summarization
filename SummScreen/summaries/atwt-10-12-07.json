Noah thinks if he had just stayed with Maddie, everything would have been fine, but Maddie tells him that wouldn't have been right for him, and they can't go back there now. She tells him that pretending to be straight won't help him or Luke, and he apologizes for coming on to her and leaves.\n\n\nAfter Holden knocks Dusty down at the hospital, Lily tells him if he wants to be mad at someone, be mad at the psychopath who wanted to hurt Luke just because he's gay. Dusty leaves. Lily asks Holden what they can do about the fact that they are barely speaking while their son is in so much trouble. Holden says he doesn't know how to stop history from repeating itself, that they always seem to be sitting at someone's bedside in the hospital. He says he doesn't blame her for that, but he doesn't want to keep going over the same ground. He goes in to see Luke. \n\n\nLucinda finds Dusty sitting on \"her\" bench in Old Town and joins him. She tells him she's on her way to the hospital and is worried about Luke; he tells her she should worry about Lily, too, because her husband's not being very supportive. Lucinda realizes Dusty's been punched in the face and that it was Holden who did it; Dusty tells her that Lily will fill her in, and he leaves. Lucinda arrives at the hospital and hugs Lily outside in the hallway. She offers to get a top specialist for Luke, but Lily says she doesn't know how Holden would feel about that, and she says they are having a hard time agreeing on anything right now. When she tells Lucinda how critical Holden has been of her lately, Lucinda responds, \"He's a Snyder, dear --- they're always holier than thou!\" But she says that's who Lily married and who she fell in love with, and Lily says she still loves him but feels like they're caught in a vicious cycle with Luke in the middle. Lucinda tells Lily not to blame herself for what has happened, and after Burt, the physical therapist, walks up, Lucinda goes to get coffee for everyone. Burt and Lily go into Luke's room, where he introduces himself to Luke, who is less than enthusiastic. Burt asks Holden and Lily to give him a minute with Luke, so they leave. Holden says he's going to Al's to get coffee, and Lily tells him Lucinda's here and just went to get some coffee for them, but he says he'll go anyway because he needs to get out of there for a while. He leaves, and Burt comes out and tells Lily that they'll need to work on Luke's attitude and that Lily is his secret weapon. Lily goes back into Luke's room and tries to bolster his spirits, but he says things don't work out for him, citing Noah as an example, asking \"Where is he now?\" Lily leaves and finds Holden still at Al's, where she tells him that she thinks they do need to call Noah, but Holden's not having any of it, saying Noah is the cause of Luke's problems. He brushes her off and leaves. Back at the hospital, he runs into Lucinda, but when he realizes she wants to talk to him about Lily, he tries to brush her off, too. Lucinda is persistent and goes after him, finally catching up to him and telling him she knows they are all exhausted and worried, but he needs to try to talk to his wife. He says Lily knew Colonel Mayer might have killed his wife but didn't say anything, and Lucinda says Lily is Luke's mother and would never intentionally let any harm come to him. Holden asks how many times he's supposed to forgive her, and Lucinda says if he loves her, then as many as it takes.\n\n\nAt Al's, Lily tries to call Noah anyway, but he won't pick up his phone. She then runs into Dusty and asks him to find Noah for her and get him to come to the hospital. Dusty goes to the Lakeview, where he finds Noah, who has been given a suitcase with his father's belongings in it. He tells Dusty he doesn't want it and just wants to get as far away from Oakdale as possible. Dusty says he doesn't seem like the type to run out on a friend who needs him, and he tells him Lily thinks Luke really needs to see him now. He encourages Noah to not be a coward and to prove his dad wrong, and in the end, he gets Noah to go to the hospital with him. Lily thanks him for coming, and she and Dusty leave Noah in the room with Luke, who's dozing. When Luke awakens and sees Noah, he reaches for him and holds his hand. Lily thanks Dusty and hugs him, just as Holden walks up. Dusty quickly leaves, and Lily tells Holden that Dusty brought Noah to the hospital.\n\n\nKatie arrives at WOAK late for work, and she and Brad talk about their interview with author Emily Giffen, which neither one has really prepared for, but when Katie asks what Ms. Giffen's books are about, Brad tells her she writes about getting back together with your lost love. As they do the interview, the author says falling in love with your best friend can be wonderful, but if you give your best friend your heart, you'll never get it back. Katie excuses herself and leaves the set, so Brad finishes the interview alone. After the author leaves, Katie thanks Brad. Her cell phone rings, and when she hears it's Jack, she hangs up after telling him she's in the middle of an interview. She then tells Brad that Jack kissed Carly, and when Brad points out it's not like he's jumping into bed with Carly, Katie says it's not like he's jumping into bed with her, either. Brad says he'll talk to Jack, but Katie says no and leaves the room.\n\n\nLater, the realtor comes to see Katie at WOAK and tells her she needs to do something today if she wants that house, because other people are interested in it, too. She tells Katie that having a house together can help make a new marriage seem more permanent, and Katie brightens at the thought of that.\n\n\nCarly comes downstairs after waking up from a nap, and Jack tells her the kids are at a football game at the high school. She is on the verge of telling him that she's not dying after all when the phone rings. Jack answers, and it's Dr. Evers, who asks Carly how she's feeling. With Jack out of the room, Carly tells the doctor she's feeling better now that she's not taking medication she doesn't actually need, and he apologizes for putting her through that. He asks if she can come in to see him in an hour so he can run a few more tests to be sure the abscess isn't growing and to pinpoint the source of her infection. Carly agrees and hangs up; Jack comes back in and sees her bottle of pills in the wastebasket. He asks her why she threw them away, and Carly says she didn't, that they must have fallen, and that she'll take one now. He gives her a pill, but she only pretends to take it. She tells Jack the doctor wants to run some more tests, so he says he'll drive her to the hospital. She says she can take a cab and that he should get back to Katie, but Jack tells her he's where he wants to be right now. He takes her to the hospital, and the doctor privately tells Carly that he just wants the tests to confirm what he already knows, that she doesn't have a lesion after all, saying he doesn't blame her for not taking his word for it right away. As they leave the room, Jack sees the doctor and thanks him for everything he's done, then tells Carly he won't let her go through the chemo alone. The doctor tries to tell him Carly won't be having the chemo after all, but he is paged and has to leave; he tells Carly he'll call her with her test results. Jack wonders why they're still running tests, and Carly says so that they won't treat her for the wrong things. Just then, Jack's cell phone rings, and it's Brad, who tells him he should be home with his wife right now, except that he and his wife don't actually have a home. Jack asks if Katie knows Brad is calling, and he says no, so Jack tells him to mind his own business and hangs up. Jack takes Carly home, where he pleads with her to have the chemo, but Carly says there's something he doesn't know, that she doesn't need the chemo after all. Jack doesn't understand, and Carly says she's doing better on the medications they've given her, so Jack asks how much time she has. Carly says she doesn't know how much time she has, but she doesn't want this to end, their time together. Jack asks if he can move in with her, and he holds her tightly as he tells her he wants every minute he can get with her.\n\n\nBrad goes to the hospital looking for Jack and Carly, but they've already left. He runs into Dr. Evers, though, and reintroduces himself, asking if Carly started her chemo today. Dr. Evers says he supposes Carly hasn't had a chance to tell everyone the good news yet, and when Brad asks what that means, he tells him that she doesn't have a lesion after all, but instead has a condition that's very curable. \n\n\n\n\n",
