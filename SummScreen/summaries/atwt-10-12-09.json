Parker had a favorite for the teen market, and he shared it with Rosanna and Craig. Johnny drew his own \"ad\" for kids, and they all liked it. Craig was kidding and suggested that they pull an all-nighter and get all the ads decided by morning. Johnny looked at his father and Rosanna and asked, \"Another sleepover? Cool!\" Parker looked strangely at the adults.\n\n\nRosanna said that she would give the paperwork to the ad agency, but Parker had picked up on Johnny's comment, and he questioned the boy. Rosanna and Craig talked fast, and Craig produced money and asked Parker to take Johnny for ice cream immediately. The boys went outside, and Parker stopped to tie the boy's shoe. He asked Johnny why he had called the other night a \"sleepover,\" but the child didn't answer and instead asked if there was really a man in the moon.\n\n\nInside, Rosanna was sure that Parker knew their secret, but Craig disagreed. Rosanna had a large moment of remorse and called herself the \"whore of Babylon in front of a teenager.\" Craig said that Parker knew nothing about their relationship, and that was Rosanna's guilt speaking. Craig said he had his own share of guilt because he could not stop thinking about her. The two of them kissed, unaware that the boys had returned.\n\n\nParker walked in on the kiss and hustled Johnny upstairs. He announced that he could see how it was going to be. Rosanna and Craig looked stunned, and Parker continued, saying that he had known it the moment Johnny had mentioned a \"sleepover.\" He accused the two of them of sending Carly to rehab so they could \"hook up,\" and he demanded to know if they had been \"doing it\" the whole time his mother had been gone. Parker ordered Craig to \"get the hell out,\" and he turned to Rosanna and asked how she could do that to her own sister. Rosanna shouted and asked what they were going to do about Carly.\n\n\nCraig tried to talk to Parker, but the teen was upset and not cooperative. Craig told him that telling Carly about him and Rosanna would do nothing constructive for Carly's recovery. Craig was sorry that Parker knew about the affair, but he asked the boy to back off so the adults could figure out what was best. Parker agreed, on the condition that Craig would do the same with Rosanna. Parker went upstairs, and Craig told Rosanna, who was hiding in the kitchen, that Parker was keeping mum. They kissed, and neither one wanted to stop the affair. Finally, Craig said that Parker had only agreed not to tell his mother as long as Craig stayed away from Rosanna. He said goodnight and walked out.\n\n\nIn Al's Diner, the smoke was heavy, and a very pregnant Katie tried to drag an unconscious Vienna outside. She called 9-1-1 first then tried to reach Henry, who did not pick up. Katie continued to try to move Vienna, but fortunately Brad dashed in and pushed Katie outside and dragged Vienna into the clean air.\n\n\nHenry was having sex with Barbara in her hotel room when his phone rang. As Henry reached for the phone quickly, Barbara remarked, \"Where's the fire, Henry?\" That call was from Audrey, but he put her on hold as Katie rang in again. Katie could hardly talk for coughing, but she managed to yell \"Fire!\" then got through to Henry that Vienna had been hurt and was on her way to the hospital. Henry dressed as quickly as he could, but Barbara was suspicious that the call had been a setup. Henry left for the hospital as soon as he found his second shoe.\n\n\nAudrey and Ralph had a discussion at Metro, and Ralph suggested that \"as soon as someone lit a fire under Henry, he would get his priorities straight.\" Teri served a lovely cherries jubilee dessert, Ralph's favorite, and Dusty Donovan entered the bar. He was not pleased to see Ralph sitting at a table, and Audrey noticed Dusty's expression. She mentioned it to Ralph, who claimed he had never seen the guy before. Dusty approached and helped himself to Ralph's dessert, but Teri challenged him. Dusty told her that he and Ralph had previously been in business together in Chicago, but Ralph had been better at sharing back then.\n\n\nDusty reminded Ralph about a project they had planned together and for which Dusty had raised all the money. Dusty said the money had disappeared, and he had ended up in a cast. Ralph was not sympathetic, and Teri asked Dusty to back off. Teri got upset and said she had to go to the market and buy more fennel, but Ralph said that was not necessary. Ralph said that he knew \"that Donovan character\" had bothered her, but he told Teri to forget him. Ralph said Dusty had always been jealous of him, and Teri gave her \"uncle\" a hug.\n\n\nDusty left Metro and went to Old Town, where he ran into Bonnie , who said that she was just on her way to meet him at the bar. Dusty handed her a dollar and told Bonnie to consider it a retainer. Bonnie wanted to know what trouble Dusty had, and Dusty asked if she had ever heard of a Ralph Manzo. Bonnie knew that Manzo had connections in the construction industry around Chicago, and Dusty added that Manzo was a big-time crook. He also said that he had unfinished business with Manzo, so Bonnie suggested that the two of them take a break for a couple of days and plan a getaway. Dusty agreed, and they kissed.\n\n\nDusty waited for Bonnie to finish shopping in Fashions, and he spotted Teri on her way to the market. He asked if she was stalking him, and he complimented her on her \"cover.\" Teri did not understand the reference until Dusty explained that no one would suspect that Metro's new chef was on Ralph Manzo's payroll. Teri called Dusty \"a real jackass\" and said that Ralph was like a father to her. Bonnie walked out of the shop and spoke to Teri, who then called Dusty \"a creep.\" Bonnie assumed that Teri's meeting Dusty had not gone well, and Teri added that Bonnie made a great martini, but her taste in men was terrible. Bonnie took Dusty's arm and led him away.\n\n\nAt Memorial, Vienna awakened with no visible burns, and the EMTs took her to an exam room. Brad also asked a doctor to check out Katie, as well. Henry arrived and saw his love, Vienna, lying in a hospital bed, wearing an oxygen mask, and he almost lost it. The examining doctor said that she would be all right, and Henry hugged him. Henry mused about what could have started the fire. He started to go across the hall to check on Katie when a nurse stopped him with a huge bouquet of flowers for Vienna. The card read: \"The circle of life is a beautiful thing. Don't break it.\"\n\n\nAudrey arrived after seeing all the fire trucks at the diner and hearing that the EMTs had transported Vienna to the hospital. She had a box of chocolates to soothe Henry, but she began eating them herself. Henry handed her the card from the flowers, and Audrey realized that the fire had been Ralph's doing. Henry said everything was his mother's fault, and he wanted Ralph out of his life. He blamed Audrey for his love's lying in a hospital bed with \"two charred lungs and an oxygen mask\" and for a terrible scare for pregnant Katie.\n\n\nHenry raved on how hard it was on him to lie to the woman he loved and who meant more to him than his own life. He wanted to walk into Vienna's room and confess everything, but Audrey, with chocolate on her lips and teeth, sweet-talked Henry into thinking that Vienna would then hate him forever. Henry looked at his mother and yelled, \"Crap!\"\n\n\nHenry went into Katie's hospital room and saw her bent over with pain. She said that the baby was fine, but Brad had gone to see if a fetal monitor was necessary. Henry tried to leave, but Katie called him back and asked if he knew how the fire had started. Henry showed her the enclosure card from the flowers and explained that \"the circle of life\" was a euphemism for money laundering. He confessed all about the scheme, as well as Barbara's involvement in trying to freeze James Stenbeck's fortune. Katie asked whose idea it had been for Henry to have sex with Barbara, and he told her it had been his mother's idea. Katie's response was a loud \"Ewwwwwwww!\"\n\n\nHenry told his best friend everything, and Katie was horrified. She was also upset at Henry's \"woe is me\" attitude, but he said he was doing some despicable things just to get his evil father's money. Brad joined them to ask about Vienna and to tell Katie that they could go home. Vienna was about to be released, as well, so Audrey left the hospital.\n\n\nAudrey stopped back at the diner and saw Ralph looking at it. She attempted to talk to him about how hard Henry was working on getting the payments to Ralph, but the man was all business. Audrey assured him that her son had a plan.\n\n\nAt home, Brad gave Katie a back rub, and they discussed how the fire had started. Katie, who knew the truth, said that it had probably been a grease fire because they were common in restaurants. Brad said he would be watching Katie like a hawk until their baby was born, or \"forever,\" for that matter. He said loving words to his wife about their family until Katie fell asleep.\n\n\nBack at the Lakeview, Henry got Vienna back to the room, but she not want to dwell on the fire. She told him how proud she was of him for giving away all his inheritance, and someone knocked on the door. He answered it and found Barbara in the hall. Henry stepped outside as Barbara asked if Vienna was okay. She reminded Henry that they had not completed their \"negotiations,\" and she told him that she would be waiting in her room until he got Vienna settled. Henry covered his face with his hands.\n\n\nIn a few minutes, Henry appeared at Barbara's door and said that he was madly in love with Vienna and had only \"had sex\" with Barbara. He said the relationship would never have happened \"organically,\" so Barbara wanted to know if what they had had was \"non-organic sex.\" Henry said it was all about the money, and if Barbara did not share it, he and Vienna were dead people. He desperately begged her for the money, but Barbara shut the door in his face.\n\n\n",
