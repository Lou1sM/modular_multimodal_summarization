As Marshall and Bonnie happily plan the party, Jessica arrives outside the window and observes Marshall and Bonnie having a pleasant conversation.  Jessica tells Tom Hughes that she has just lost her appetite.  Tom tries to talk Jessica into being reasonable, but Jessica storms off. \n\n\nIn their home, Jack and Carly are so thrilled to have agreed on Henry as their baby sitter that they tumble into bed.  There they are interrupted by a call from Alison at the hospital, telling them about Mike's accident.\n\n\nAt Metro, Molly has discovered the handwritten medical records for Craig's new baby, and she confronts Craig, observing as well that Annabel Fettle does not appear to be a legitimate adoption agent.  When Molly states, \"This adoption stinks to high heaven,\" Craig responds that everything is legal.  However, he then asks Molly to download a medical form and copy the handwritten information onto it.  Molly, refusing, tells Craig that his adoption plan is sure to fail.  Their phone rings with news about Mike from the hospital, and both Craig and Molly leave for the hospital.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Lucy and Aaron admire baby Cabot, then Aaron begins telling Lucy how much he likes his new job.  When Lucy questions him about his exact duties, Aaron describes various chores to her, omitting his involvement with the bookmaking aspect of the business.  When Rosanna comes into the room the telephone rings, and she rushes off to the hospital to see about Mike, leaving Lucy and Aaron to baby sit.  The teenagers are nervous, even before Cabot starts to wail.  The only thing they find that will calm the baby is an off-key duet of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" which instantly puts Cabot back to sleep.\n\n\nAt Oakdale Memorial Hospital, the nurse tells Chris and Alison that Mike is being prepared for surgery by Ben Harris, a brain surgeon, because there might be neurological damage.  When Alison confesses to Chris that she feels responsible for Mike's accident, Chris responds that \"the animal\" who mowed Mike down and left him bleeding in the middle of the road is the one who should be worried.  Margo comes up and berates Chris for leaving Katie's bedside, but Alison overhears and steps in to take responsibility for Chris' absence.\n\n\nAt Mike's bedside, Katie confesses to Mike that she is responsible for the accident and beg his forgiveness.  Mike answers, \"I remember, I remember,\" just as Margo opens the curtains.  Katie tells Mike to go ahead and tell Margo what happened, but instead of telling Margo that Katie's car hit him, he tells Margo how he told Katie that he loved her, then Katie told him that she wished he were dead instead of Simon.  Katie tries to tell Mike about the accident, but Mike interrupts her, telling her that he knows that if she meant what she said before, she wouldn't be there with him right then.  When Katie again insists on having time alone with Mike, he tells her what a wonderful friend she is, and she loses her nerve and doesn't tell him.  Dr. Ben insists that Katie leave so that he can give Mike a sedative, and Margo insists that Carly, who has just arrived at the hospital, take the ill Katie back to Margo's house.  Katie rushes out of the hospital crying, \"I'm never going to be okay again!  I have to get out of here.\"  When they arrive at Margo's, Katie asks Carly how she got Jack to forgive her when she made a huge mistake.  Carly advises her that she must tell Mike the truth and ask him to forgive her.  Jack arrives at the hospital to question Mike just before he goes in to surgery, but Mike can't answer any questions about the hit and run driver.  Rosanna arrives to see Mike, but Dr. Ben tells her that Mike can have no more visitors.  Next come Molly and Craig.  When Molly starts to go in to see Mike, Rosanna flatly tells her, \"You can't.\"  Molly bristles and snaps at Rosanna, \"You don't know what's going on in there....You barely know what's going on in your family.\"  Craig tries to look innocent.\n\n\n",
