After he left, Dusty found someone who worked at the hotel who recalled having seen Nurse Thompson talking with a blond woman. Jennifer and Dusty found out that Nurse Thompson's brother had a common-law wife who was blond, but they didn't know if that was who had been talking to her or not. Jennifer told Dusty maybe they should give up and he should go back to Oakdale, but he said he wasn't leaving without her. He said things had changed when they kissed, and when Jennifer tried to say it was just a \"moment,\" Dusty said it was more than that for him. Jennifer said she wasn't ready to go there yet, and Dusty said he would wait. Dusty asked Jennifer if she still believed Rory was her baby, and she said yes, so Dusty said they should keep looking.\n\n\nAt Java, Meg left Dusty an urgent message on his cell phone. Emily came in and talked with Meg, telling her that Dusty and Jennifer had gone to Philadelphia to see a designer.\n\n\nLily and Holden were at Lucinda's bedside after her mastectomy, which the doctor said had gone well. Emma came by with flowers. When Lily left to go get some coffee from Java, Emma talked with Holden about his presumed reconciliation with Lily. Meg came up and remarked on how supportive Emma was being of Holden. Holden left, and Emma said she was trying to protect Meg from Dusty, which is why she wasn't as supportive of her. Meg said she needed less protection and more support. Meg then told Emma she had to cancel their dinner plans because she had to find Dusty, although not for the reasons Emma was thinking. She told Emma that she had important news that would change Jennifer's life for the better and would reap benefits for everyone involved.\n\n\nAt the police station, Hal questioned Cass Winthrop about where Gwen might have gone, and after Cass insisted he didn't know, Hal asked him who was paying his legal fees. Cass admitted that Paul had been paying him. Hal ran into Emily and asked her how involved she was in Paul's recent doings, which he now knew included paying for Gwen's attorney. He told her he thought that Paul knew that Gwen had planned to kidnap the baby, that he had encouraged Will to go along with it, and that he probably knew where they were right now. Emily denied that, but Hal still believed Paul was involved in the kidnapping somehow. Emily said that Paul was on his way back from Italy, where he'd been looking for a place for them to live with Jennifer. Hal asked Emily why Paul was so interested in Gwen and her baby.\n\n\nWhile his plane circled while waiting to land, Paul took a quick nap and dreamed that Jennifer had found out about the baby and tried to kill him for his role in covering it up. Meg called Street Jeans to get the name of Dusty's hotel in Philadelphia but was told he was actually in Tampa. She then booked a flight to Tampa. When she sat down on the plane, Paul walked up and sat down next to her.\n\n\nJack caught up with Will and asked him where Gwen was, but Will lied and said he didn't know. Meanwhile, Carly found Gwen by accident and pleaded with her to bring Rory back to Oakdale with her so that they could work things out. While they were talking, Will ran up, shouting that they needed to leave right now. Carly and Gwen both grabbed the handle of the baby carriage, and it went tumbling down the steps. Fortunately, Jack came running up just in time to catch the baby at the bottom of the steps. When Carly tried to run down to see the baby, Gwen grabbed her, and they fought with each other until Gwen fell down the stairs, too. Iris came running up, and she and Will knelt down by Gwen while Jack called for an ambulance. Iris called Gwen \"my angel girl,\" which triggered a memory for Carly of overhearing Iris holding a baby girl and calling her \"angel girl\" and saying she had a perfect plan to get her away from there (Oakdale). Carly realized then that Iris's baby was a girl, not a boy.\n\n\nAt Java, Lily overheard Keith trying to rent a place to live in Oakdale. She told him she had thought he was leaving town, but he said he planned to stick around. He told Lily he was staying both for JJ's sake and for Lily's, because he didn't believe that what they had could be dismissed and forgotten so easily. Lily told him he was wasting his time, but he grabbed her hand and pleaded with her to stay for a minute to talk. Holden walked in just in time to see Keith holding onto Lily.\n\n\n\n\n",
