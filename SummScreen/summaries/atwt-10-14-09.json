Meg wanted to talk longer, but Damian was brusque and told her to send him an email instead, and he turned his back on her. Meg pursued him and apologized for letting her emotions get out of control.\n\n\nDamian declared that he was Lily's husband legally, and in every other way. He explained the legalities and said that his and Lily's marriage was binding. Damian admitted, however, that Lily was conflicted and felt guilty. He was surprised when Meg reassured him that all she wanted was for him to be happy.\n\n\nIn Old Town, Lily asked Holden who the woman with him was, and he introduced Maeve to her. Lily got almost hysterical when she realized that Maeve had been married to Eb Stone, who had threatened Lily and her children in her home. Holden tried to calm Lily, but she was furious. Holden explained that Eb had locked them in a root cellar, but Maeve had rescued him and gotten him to a hospital, and that had saved his life.\n\n\nLily thanked Maeve, but the two of them continued to trade verbal barbs. Lily found out that Maeve was staying at the Lakeview, so she told her to use Lily's name at the front desk if she needed anything. After all, Lily said, she did own the hotel. Then Lily asked Holden to stop by the house later to see the children, and he agreed. Lily walked away and went to the Lakevew, where Meg called to her from the bar.\n\n\nMeg asked if Lily had misplaced one of her husbands, but Lily said that she didn't want a fight with Meg. Meg told Lily that she had just missed Damian, and they sparred back and forth until Lily said that she considered herself to be still married to Holden, and the legal issue was just a technicality. She taunted Meg by saying that wherever that left Damian, it was not with Meg.\n\n\n Lily said that Damian was over Meg completely, but Meg questioned why Lily was still wearing his wedding ring and not Holden's. Lily explained that she was probably going to have the jeweler cut the ring off her finger, but she didn't convince Meg. Meg said they could agree on one thing: both of them wanted Lily no longer to be married to Damian.\n\n\nDamian went to Lily's and was surprised to find Holden there. Holden said he was waiting for the children to return from school, but he asked why Damian was there. Damian said the fact was that he and Lily were legally husband and wife, but Holden refused to believe that. Damian said that was a wrong assumption because the coroner had issued a death certificate that declared Holden legally dead. He offered to send for his lawyer, but Holden thought Damian was bluffing. As he walked out the door, Damian said that he would wait as long as it took for Lily to ask him back.\n\n\nWhen Lily got home, she found Holden playing cowboys with Ethan. Holden mentioned that Damian had delivered the news that Lily was no longer married to Holden, but Lily said that she didn't care. All that mattered to her was how they felt. Holden walked outside and said the only thing that had drawn him back was that he'd had Lily to go back to. He looked really down and walked away, leaving Lily sad, as well. Damian returned in a short while and found Lily twisting and pulling on his ring on her finger. He asked if she truly wanted if off, because he felt they belonged together. Just then the ring slipped off, and Lily tried to hand it to him. Damian told her to keep it.\n\n\nHolden returned to the Lakeview and was going into his room when Maeve passed by with an ice bucket. She called him \"neighbor\" and asked if he wanted to share some ice.\n\n\nAt Metro, Craig and Rosanna negotiated with Mr. Swanson, whom they had convinced to display their vitamin water in every one of his 1,438 convenience stores. After Swanson left, Rosanna told Craig to stop flirting with her because Carly was \"working her butt off\" in rehab, and they could not disappoint her. They were standing very close together when Jack walked in unannounced and said that he had just talked to Carly. They were all excited that she had earned phone privileges.\n\n\nJack noticed that Craig and Rosanna seemed strung tightly, and he commented on that. Then he guessed wrongly that they were wondering why Carly had called him instead of one of them, and Rosanna took that and ran with it. Jack said that Carly had wanted to know about the kids, so she had called him, and he said that she'd sounded more peaceful than when she had left. Both Craig and Rosanna said how much they wanted Carly home, and Jack mentioned that he was glad to hear that because he was beginning to think that Craig liked the temporary setup a little too much.\n\n\nCraig barked at Jack and asked \"what the hell\" he meant by that. Jack commented that Craig was very defensive lately and asked if he had hit a nerve. He stated that having Carly back would put a considerable crimp in Craig's style, and he walked out. Rosanna was positive that she wanted to be the one to tell Carly about her relationship with Craig, but she was terrified that Parker would tell Carly first.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Paul arrived home and called out for Emily. He reported that he had found organically grown, grass fed, hormone-free, antibiotic-free soy ice cream that was healthy enough for Liberty. Unfortunately, Emily could not find the girl anywhere, and Emily was fearful that Liberty would take the baby and run. She felt responsible for Liberty missing the SAT test and took all the blame.\n\n\nLiberty and Parker went to the park after he rescued her from the drinking party. Liberty called herself a loser, and she got sick again. She said she felt helpless, but she drank some water and felt slightly better, although she still thought her life was over. Parker gave her some aspirin, but Liberty was just tired of everyone running her life but her. She even felt that her mother was validating her own life through her daughter. She thanked Parker for being the one who \"got it,\" but she asked for a time out just to be by herself. Parker agreed and told Liberty to call him if she needed him.\n\n\nAt the farm, Brad visited with Janet and remembered that Liberty was taking the SAT exam that day. He wanted to celebrate in some way, so he suggested they gather the family at Al's, and he asked Janet to get their daughter there under false pretenses. Brad left to make the rest of the arrangements, and Janet took a call from Emily, but it was not a friendly one. It turned out that neither woman had seen or talked to Liberty since the test.\n\n\nParker was walking in Old Town, and Janet saw him and told him about the surprise party for Liberty. She explained that the occasion was Liberty's \"knocking the SAT test out of the ballpark.\" Parker explained that Liberty had been denied admittance to the test because she had been late, and he blamed Emily, who had turned off the girl's alarm. Janet flipped out and called Emily some nasty names. Parker got upset and said that both Emily and Janet only wanted Liberty's baby and didn't care about the girl's life at all.\n\n\nBrad arrived with balloons and asked Janet where the guest of honor was. Janet told him what Emily had done and how Liberty had missed the test. She was even more convinced that she and Jack needed to raise the baby. Brad still disagreed with her.\n\n\nLiberty returned to Fairwinds and collapsed on the couch with her head in her hands. Emily and Paul walked in and worried aloud about Liberty, who stood up and announced that she was going to bed. Emily got close to the girl and smelled liquor on her. She lit into Liberty about the dangers of fetal alcohol syndrome, and an exhausted Liberty warned that she was not Emily's \"pet incubator.\" She said that she was just as important a person as \"the kid,\" and she told Emily to back off. Then she announced that she was glad she had not signed the adoption agreement because they were better off without her and her \"damaged kid.\" Liberty ran out.\n\n\nEmily was distraught and continued to blame herself for ruining their baby plans. Paul assured her that Liberty would return, but instead, Parker entered. He asked for Liberty, but Emily explained what had happened. Paul asked Parker to find the girl and escort her home safely. Parker said it sounded as if they only cared about the unborn baby and not the mother, and he took off.\n\n\nEmily was miserable and said that she had lost her last chance at \"the mom thing.\" Paul said he had promised her a child, and he would get her one. He took Emily in his arms and comforted her.\n\n\nLiberty went back to her park bench and watched a very tired mother walk by with a stroller. Jack walked down the path and spotted Liberty, so he called Janet, who was still with Brad in Old Town. He told them where their daughter was, and when they got to the park, Jack pointed out the melancholy Liberty on the bench. Brad chewed out Janet and asked her to leave Liberty alone. He told her the girl needed to feel that what she thought really mattered. Jack jumped in and said that Liberty just needed her parents.\n\n\nBrad and Janet approached Liberty and hugged her. Jack said, \"Let's go home,\" and they did. Liberty went up to her room at the farm, and Janet and Jack sat in the swing on the porch. Jack told Janet he was very proud of her and Brad for how they had handled the situation. They strolled away from the swing for a while and did not see Parker sneak into the house. He called upstairs to Liberty, and she ran down the stairs. She told him that her parents were playing \"Super Mom\" and \"Iron Dad,\" and they were driving her nuts.\n\n\nParker said that she wouldn't have to put up with that much longer if things worked out the way he had planned. He was about to tell Liberty his idea, but she saw Janet and Jack walking back, so Parker ran into the parlor, and Liberty ran back upstairs.\n\n\nCraig and Rosanna went back to Carly's, and he asked what Rosanna would say to Carly about their affair. Rosanna made Craig stay out on the porch while she stood in the doorway to alleviate temptation, and she was glad she had done so, because Parker walked up. He told Craig that he had decided to accept Craig's offer of access to his trust fund, but Rosanna cried, \"Over my dead body!\" Craig tried to talk her through it, but Rosanna called it \"blackmail.\" Craig argued that it had been his idea, and therefore, it was not blackmail. Rosanna did not care; it was still paying for Parker's silence.\n\n\nParker wasn't into subtleties and asked if they had a deal or not. Rosanna said no, and Craig said yes. Craig reminded them that he was the trustee, and Parker would have some cash when the banks opened the next morning. \"Cool,\" said Parker, but before he walked away, he reminded them both that Carly was not an idiot and that she would see right through the two of them. Parker called it a \"win/win\" situation, and he dashed off, grinning. Craig commented that the more he learned about that boy, the more Parker reminded him of himself.\n\n\nRosanna slammed the door in Craig's face. He began to walk away, but he turned back and kicked in the door. He grabbed Rosanna in his arms, and she cried that she was trying hard to be \"a good sister,\" but Craig silenced her with a kiss. They began ripping off each other's clothes right in the living room.\n\n\n",
