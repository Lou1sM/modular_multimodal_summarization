Margo shows him a note from a sister at a convent.  She says that it seems that Katie had gone there looking for sanctuary.  Simon starts to leave and Margo stops him.  She tells him that they know Katie is ok and she had checked out this Bruno guy, but now she has some questions for him.  Margo tells him that she knows that her sister can be a hand full, but when he finds Katie, she wants him to be honest with her.  Simon says that he will.  Margo says that he must put an end to their relationship.  Simon shakes his head no.  Margo says, \"What?\"  Simon tells her that he loves Katie.  Margo says, \"What?\"  Simon says that he doesn't want to end it with Katie.  Margo tells him that if he doesn't end it with Katie that he had better get ready for fifty or sixty years with her and that means a house and kids and a white picket fence.  Simon smiles and says that he wants to go get her.  Margo is stunned but she gives Simon the address of the convent.  Simon tells Margo thank you and gives her a kiss on the cheek and leaves.  At the convent, Simon talks to a sister and tells her that he is there to get his wife, Katie Peretti Frazer.  The sister rolls her eyes and tells him that he will have to talk to the Reverend Mother Sister Mary.  She tells him that she is in her office talking to the other guy.  Simon asks, \"What other guy?\"  The Reverend Mother comes walking out with Bruno.  She informs the two men that Katie is no longer with them.  She tells them about Katie giving make-up tips to the other sister for people who wear only black and white.  She tells them about how she called the Pope, the Popester.  And she ends with when she took communion; she told them that the host would be better with guacamole on it.  The two men smile and Bruno says, \"That's my girl.\"  Simon reminds him that she is not his girl, she is his wife.  The Reverend Mother tells the two men that before they had arrived that Katie had left and they hope that she does not come back looking for sanctuary at their convent.  The Reverend Mother leaves.  Simon tells Bruno that he doesn't have to chase after Katie and he can just leave.  Simon says that he is going to go find Katie.  Bruno asks, \"Where?\"  Simon tells him to mind his own business and he starts to leave.  Bruno grabs him and tells him that he is not going anywhere.  Simon pushes him away.  Bruno tells Simon that he never told Katie how beautiful she was and he only used her to stay in the country.  Simon tells him that he is a gambler and he should just go back to his blackjack.  Bruno gets in Simon's face and tells him to stay out of his way.  He adds that if he does get in his way, they will see who has the luck.  Bruno walks out and Simon shakes his head.\n\n\nPaul walks into his mother's room and she is arranging flowers.  She questions how late he got in the night before.  Paul tells her that he got back to Oakdale early, but he wanted to give her time with the family.  Barbara tells him that he didn't have to do that.  She questions him about who he went to see and alludes to Rose.  Paul tells her that she was one person he needed to see.  He asks her what is going on.

She opens the door and asks, \"What?\"  Craig walks in and sees the packages all around and sees that Carly has bought some expensive wine.  He asks if she has hit the lottery.  Outside her window, someone is taking pictures of her and Craig.  Craig sits down on the couch with Parker and makes comments about his new toys.  He starts to look in one of Carly's bags and she grabs it and tells him to stop it.

She tells him that she is going to be busy all week.  He asks what is going to keep her so busy.  She tells him to back off.  She goes to the door and opens the door for him to leave.  He tells her that if it is important, he will find out.  She says, \"Not if you want to have dinner with me, you won't.\"  Craig says goodbye to Parker and walks to the door, stops and looks at Carly and says, \"toodle-lou.\"  She waves goodbye and closes the door.  She looks at Parker and tells him that he gave up way too easy, he must have a plan.\n\n\nAt the police station, Emily walks in and sees that Margo or Hal are nowhere in sight.  She walks over to Margo's desk and sees the file on Dante Grimaldi.  She picks up the file and starts to read it.  When she hears Margo and Hal coming, she ducks behind a file cabinet.  Margo walks to her desk and says that the file for Grimaldi was lying right here and now it is gone.  She sniffs the air and asks Hal if he smells that.  Hal asks, \"Smell what?\"  Margo says that she can smell obnoxious perfume.  She reaches over the file cabinet and pulls Emily up by her hair.  Emily is still holding the file and Margo grabs it from her.  Margo starts to complain about Emily to Hal and her phone rings.  Craig is calling Margo and asks if she can meet him for coffee.  She looks at Emily and says that she needs a break.  She hangs up the phone and goes to the diner to meet Craig.  When she gets there she tells him that if he is worried about Katie, she has found her at a convent.  Craig says, \"That's good.\"  Margo says that their baby sister goes off and is missing and all he can say is that's good.  Craig says that she goes off missing once a month, it is hormonal.  Margo asks what is up with him.  Craig tells her that Carly is lying to him.  Margo laughs.  He tells her about Carly designing for BRO and keeping it a secret.  As he thinks out loud, he tells Margo that he wants to be the one who gives Carly her own label.  Margo tells him that he doesn't have that kind of money.  Craig tells her that if he can take over Worldwide, he would have more than enough.  Margo asks if he bought enough shares to knock Lucinda off her throne.  Craig says yes, but half belongs to Barbara.  He adds that he needs to get Barbara to vote with him.  Margo tells him that he has a snowballs chance in hell getting Barbara to vote her shares with him.  Craig says that he just needs to find a way to keep Barbara from voting with Lucinda.  Margo looks at him very strangely.  He smiles at her and says that he always loves their little talks and adds that her advice is always on the money.  \n\n\nBack at Carly's apartment, Paul shows up to tell Carly that he couldn't tell his mother about Carly designing for her company.  Carly tells him that it was the deal that he would tell her up front.  Paul shows her the designs that his mother had worked on all night.  He tells Carly that his mother thinks these designs are good.  Carly tells him that it won't work.  She reminds him that when the designs are shown they won't look like anything in her sketchbook.  Paul tells her that his mother won't leave the house and she won't be there when the sketches are shown.  Carly looks at Parker.  She turns to Paul and says that she wants a contract stating that she will have her label.  Paul says that he will get that for her.  Paul says that they have one last problem; she can't let Craig find out about their arrangement.  Carly tells him that she can handle Craig.  As they walk to the door, Paul tells her that he is counting on her and he is counting on a brilliant line from her.  She tells him that he will have that by the end of the week.  As she opens the door and Paul steps out to leave, someone is taking pictures of them from the bushes.\n\n\n",
