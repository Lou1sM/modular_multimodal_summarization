The doctor explains that it was a big error and Brad is stunned.\n\n\nCarly and Jack embrace after he tells her he is going to move in for a while. Carly tells him that she doesn't want to interfere with his life but he tells her not to worry. Just as Jack goes in the other room there is a knock at the door; it's Katie. Katie apologizes for intruding, but asks to see Jack. Carly tells her that she is sorry for causing problems. Just then Brad bursts in and tells Carly that he just saw Dr. Evers. Jack then walks in to see what was going on. Brad begins to speak, but Carly interrupts telling Jack that Katie was there to see him. Jack suggests that they go for a walk so they both leave. Brad tells Carly he knows she isn't dying and wants to know why she isn't bursting to tell everyone the good news.  Carly tells Brad that this was never her intention and that she plans on telling Jack- but just hasn't been able to do it yet. She tells him that she prayed and her prayer was answered. Brad is unmoved, but Carly tells him that she needs more time with him- what difference does a little longer make? Brad tells her that he knows what she is doing- she is hoping that by the time Jack knows the difference he will be in it too deep and won't be able to leave her. Brad tells her that it's wrong because Jack has Katie now. Carly tells him that if Katie really loves Jack then she will fight for him because Jack is willing to fight for. \n\n\nBrad asks Carly what she is going to do when Jack finds out she isn't dying and didn't tell him. Carly tells Brad that Jack can find out in a week of two. Brad tells her he just might tell Jack because this lie is so nasty and conniving. Brad brings up Katie and how her heart was broken because Jack abandoned her on their wedding night to be with Carly. Brad brought up the kids and that their hearts are breaking. Carly tells him that she has figured out a way to let them know and begs Brad not to tell him. Carly said that she never meant for Katie to be involved in any of this- but it is fate. Carly points out that this will leave Katie open to him- she will be heartbroken and in need of comfort. Brad says he won't stoop to her level, but Carly reminds him that he has stooped lower. She tells Brad that she is willing to set one foot in hell to retrieve the love of her life. \n\n\nOn their walk Katie tells Jack that if they don't make an offer on the house, they will lose this opportunity. Jack tells her that this situation isn't going to be forever and asks her what she wants to do. Katie tells him that she loves the house so Jack tells her to buy it.  They happily embrace, but Jack tells her that he won't be able to move in right away because he is going to live with Carly until she dies. Katie is upset and tells him that she doesn't know what to say. Jack promises her that they will live their entire life there. Katie looks unsure. She tells him that she isn't going to wait for him- she just can't do it. Jack tells her that he loves her and he wants to spend his life with her, but Katie fires back with \"just not while Carly is alive!\" she apologizes for the comment, but then asks Jack how she can compete with a dying woman. Jack tells her there is no competition and that he loves her. She loves him too, but it doesn't change that he is living with his ex-wife. Katie said that when she married him it made her a better person, but if things don't change she doesn't know how long that will last. Katie tells him that she isn't going to file for divorce, but she can't wait in the wings anymore. \n\n\nJack and Katie return to Carly's. Katie quickly grabs her purse and walks out as Jack tries to stop her. Brad then spoke up, asking Katie if she wanted to go over some work at the station. Katie starts to tell him that it wasn't a good time, but changes her mind  and they leave together.\n\n\nA quiet Jack sits staring. Carly tells him that she knows he is upset and asks him to talk to her. Jack tells her that he wanted to make Katie happy, but has just made a bigger mess of their life. Carly tells him that if being there is upsetting him, maybe he shouldn't be there. She tells him that she won't keep him there- she won't obligate him. He tells her that he isn't staying with her out of obligation. He brushes her cheek and tells her it's more than that- a lot more. He embraces her. \n\n\nAt WOAK Katie and Brad work together and he tells her that she was right to want to get her mind off Jack and Carly. But Katie wonders why he would say that, when before he was telling her to fight for her man. She asks Brad what was going on with him. \n\n\nAlison arrives at Will and Gwen's so they can go to the hospital together for the egg harvesting procedure. At the hospital Gwen is excited. Susan takes Alison into the exam room to sign the consent papers, notices her nervousness and reminds her that if she isn't sure she can back out. She tells Alison that once she signs the papers she is giving up all parental rights. Alison says she will finally be able to say she did something to change somebody's life forever and she signs the papers. \n\n\nIn the hall Will and Gwen say goodbye to Alison as she is wheeled into the operating room and thank her again. \n\n\nWill and Gwen make jokes after he had to submit a sperm sample for the fertilization.

Holden is angry that she called Noah- but Lily is certain she did the right thing. \n\n\nIn Luke's room Noah tells him that he wouldn't be surprised if he hated him after what his father did, but Luke tells him that it's the opposite. Holden comes in to make sure everything is ok and Luke tells him he wants more time alone with Noah. \n\n\nAfter checking on him, Holden tells Lily that Luke wants Noah to stay. Lily points out that she was right, but Holden tells her that she has thrown their marriage away just to be right. He tells her that she again turned to Dusty because she didn't trust him. Lily tells Holden that she doesn't recognize him anymore- and Holden tells her they shouldn't be together right now and walks away. \n\n\nLuke tells Noah that he feels bad for him growing up with his father. Noah tells him that seeing him reminds him of what his father is, but it also reminds him how much he cares about Luke. Luke tells him that knowing that he cares about him makes this whole thing bearable. Luke tells him that whatever happens, he is happy they met. Noah wants to pick things up where they left off when he gets better, but Luke tells him that they can't; because he might not get better. Noah tells him he didn't realize that Luke's injuries were permanent. Luke tells him that it sucks to have a boyfriend that's in a wheelchair. Noah asks him if that's what he is. \n\n\nLuke tells him that he might not ever get feeling back below his waist. Noah asks him again if he wants him to be his boyfriend- Luke says yes and Noah smiles. Noah tells him to do what he has to do to get out of the hospital- Luke said he isn't sure he can. Noah takes his hand and asks him if he will try. Luke smiles and says he will. \n\n\n\n\n\nBack at Emma's Holden is fixing the sink. Lily finds him there and tries to talk to him, but Holden tells him that he has no more ideas of what to do for their marriage. Lily said that maybe they shouldn't talk but just be there for each other and Luke. She asks him if they can just go home- but Holden said no. \n\n\nHow many times can they patch things up? He said. They should just admit that their marriage is broken. Lily doesn't agree- she wants them to have time to just be. But Holden disagrees and tells her to go home alone- that they shouldn't live together anymore. Lily tells him that they need to think about Luke now- but Holden tells her this will be the best way for them to focus on Luke and not their problems. Lily told him he was still mad at her, but Holden told her that he is beyond mad and is tired and doesn't have the energy for anything right now but Luke. He tells her that right now he has no energy left for their marriage.  Lily tells him she is tired too of talking and it not doing any good. Holden told her that it would be best if they leave each other alone for a while. He returns to fixing the sink and Lily leaves. \n\n\n",
