She told Rose she'd never have a chance with Paul if she continued to let Lucinda run her life.  Rose didn't think that Lucinda was that bad and Lily told her to wait until she knew her better.  Rose said she had seen Lucinda's other side.  She said she had to get to the board meeting.  Lily suggested that she not go since Lucinda wasn't paying her.  She wanted Rose to let Lucinda flounder without her and then she would see what and asset she really was.  Rose said she wasn't going for Lucinda -- she was going for herself.  She told Lily that she was in heaven when she went to the last meeting posing as her.  She said she loved how everyone there paid attention and listened to her every word.  Lily told her love it or not that she deserved a salary for her work.  \n\n\nFairwinds:\n\nPaul was mad at Barbara for going back on her word regarding her voting her shares with Lucinda.  Barbara told Paul that she wasn't voting the shares with Lucinda unless he stopped seeing Rose.  He wanted to know what Rose ever did to her.  They continue to argue about her going back on her word and when he got mad enough, he told her that he was moving out and left.  \n\n\nThe Honeymoon Suite:\n\nJake and Molly kissed as Jake tried to hide some papers behind his back.  He tried to distract Molly with kisses but she managed to get the papers from him.  They were drawings by the twins that Donna sent them.  Molly thought they were wonderful and began to cry from happiness and sadness because she missed them so much.  \n\n\nMolly and Jake were enjoying getting massages together.  They talked about how great their honeymoon was.  They both agreed that that was the life.  Molly told him that she knew he missed their family and couldn't take this kind of living forever.  Molly told him if he admitted that he missed the girls that they could go home.  Jake admitted that he missed the them.  Molly said she missed them as much as he did.  They decided that they could finish their honeymoon at home and planned to leave in the morning and surprise the girls.  \n\n\nBryant's Cottage:\n\nBryant and Billy argued about Billy wanting to leave.  When Billy insisted that he was leaving, Bryant told him not to leave before he told Jennifer goodbye.  They told each other goodbye and Bryant left for work.\n\n\nThe Munson's House:\n\nEmily asked Hal what crime she committed by taking Jennifer to see a gynecologist.  They argue about it when the phone rang Jennifer answered it.  It was Billy and he asked Jennifer to meet with him one more time.  She told him that she'd meet him at Al's.\n\n\nLater Jennifer walked down the stairs into the kitchen and Emily remarked that she liked her dress.  Jennifer asked if there was something wrong between her and Hal.  Emily said that they survived on arguments and asked what was up with her.  She wanted to know if it was something to do with Bryant's cousin.  Jennifer told her that Billy was leaving town and wanted to see her one more time.  She said she didn't know if she should go or not.  Emily asked her what she wanted to do.  Jennifer said she didn't know and wanted to know what Emily would do.  Emily said she didn't know and suggested that she talk to Hal.  Hal walked in and wanted to know what they were talking about.  Will came down stairs and said he was ready to go on his sleepover at the O'Mally House.  Jennifer offered to take him.  Hal asked when she would be home.  She said she wasn't sure but not to worry.  \n\n\nHal was proud of how that went with Jennifer and told Emily that, that's the kind of relationship he had with his daughter.  Closing her eyes, Emily remarked \"yes, open and honest\", knowing that Jennifer was going to meet Billy.  Hal said Jennifer didn't use to lie to him and Emily asked if he thought that Jennifer started lying since she was around to influence her.  She told Hal that teenage girls are naturally secretive when it came to boys and sex.  They continued to argue about Emily taking Jennifer to a gynecologist.  He asked her why she took her to that kind of doctor when she wasn't having sex.  Emily told him to wake up that Jennifer wasn't a little girl anymore.  Hal grabbed his keys and said he was going to kill Bryant.  Emily almost told him that it wasn't Bryant but managed to keep it from him.  He told her that when Jennifer moved back from living with Bryant, she told him that they never had sex.  Emily said, \"maybe she changed her mind.\"  Hal wanted to know if Emily changed her mind for her.\n\n\nHal and Emily continued to argue about Jennifer being interested in sex.  Hal said that it seemed to coincide with the time that Jennifer had been around her.  He made it clear that he didn't want her to interfere with his family.  Emily stated to leave but Hal stopped her, saying that he wasn't through with her.  Hal told her that they needed to set some ground rules in their relationship.  Emily cried as she told Hal that she got his message that she wasn't good enough for him and his family.  Hal told her to shut up, grabbed her and began kissing her.  They continued kissing and Hal suggested that they take it upstairs.\n\n\nWorld Wide Board Room:\n\nLucinda discussed business with one of the board members as Craig walked in and listened, standing behind her.  She turned and saw Craig and told him that without Barbara's votes, that he doesn't have a chance to take her company.  He didn't think she should count her blessings just yet.  \n\n\nWhen Rose walked in, Lucinda asked her where she had been, then she asked where Barbara was.  Rose said she guessed she was coming with Paul.  Paul walked in and told them that Barbara wasn't coming.  Rose wanted to know what happened.  Craig overheard and was delighted that Barbara wouldn't be there.  He said it was time for the meeting to begin.  Lucinda told Rose that she was going to stall and she wanted Rose to get Barbara to the meeting.  She told her that if she failed to bring Barbara to the meeting, she might as well go back to Atlantic City.  \n\n\nCraig told the board members that World Wide was long overdue for a change.  Lucinda closed the door to the boardroom in Rose's face.  Rose looked at Paul and he told her that he wasn't adding any more pressure to his Mom for anyone.  Rose said she didn't think that he was the kind of guy that would turn his back on somebody.  She then reminded him that Craig dropped the lawsuit against them because of her.  They continue to argue about Barbara not being there and Paul finally told her that Barbara had reservations about his relationship with her.  Rose said that she was going to talk to Barbara.  He didn't want her to do that.  He said he was going to tell the board members about the awful things that Craig did to Barbara and that Craig would be dead in the water.  Rose told him OK and to go in the boardroom and she'd be there in a few minutes.  \n\n\nWhen Paul walked in the boardroom, Lucinda wanted to know where Rose was.  She immediately thought that Rose went to see Barbara.  Paul told her that she wouldn't do that.  Craig again asked for the meeting to begin so that the members could get home.\n\n\nFairwinds:\n\nRose thanked Barbara for seeing her on such short notice.  Barbara told her that she thought she'd be at the stockholder's meeting and wanted to know what she wanted.  Rose reminded Barbara that she did her part by making Craig drop the law suit against her and in return Barbara said she was going to help Lucinda hold on to World Wide.  Barbara said she didn't sell her stock to Craig and that tonight Lucinda was on her own.  Rose couldn't believe that Barbara hated Lucinda that much and was siding with Craig after what he did to her.  Barbara told her there was no love lost between her and Lucinda, but it wasn't the reason she's withholding her votes.  Rose wanted to know why then and that she was ready to fix it, whatever the problem was.  Barbara said she'd give Lucinda her votes if Rose stopped seeing Paul.  Rose's jaw dropped as she stared at Barbara. \n\n\nAl's Diner:\n\nAbigail and Adam just finished eating and then discussed their video project.  When she told him that Nick was helping them, Adam changed his mood.  He didn't like the idea that Nick was involved with their project.  He left just before Nick walked up.  Abigail told Nick that she was sorry that Adam didn't want his help.  \n\n\nAbigail suggested that she and Nick both edit a piece and she'd show it to Adam.  Nick didn't think that was a good idea but Abigail thought that once Adam saw the video he'd flip.  Nick said he couldn't help because he didn't have time that he was booked.  Abigail said he wasn't busy right then.  He told her that the only way that it would work was for them to pull an all-nighter.  Abigail thought that was a great idea.  She said she was 18 now and no one would worry about her.  Nick said OK, but that he had to check to make sure the equipment was ready.  As he left the table, Abigail saw Billy and then noticed Jennifer walk in.  Abigail ran over to Jennifer and told her that she was hoped that she wasn't there to see Billy.  Jennifer didn't even look at Abigail; she had her eyes glued on Billy.  She told Abigail that she just came to tell Billy goodbye.  Abigail and Nick left as Jennifer and Billy took each other hands.  \n\n\nBilly said he was surprised that she came.  She admitted that she almost didn't.  Billy said she could come with him if she wanted.  He poured out his heart about how much they belonged together.  Jennifer got up to leave but Billy stopped her.  He said he wasn't going to leave without kissing her one more time.  She told Billy to come with her.  As they left Al's, Bryant spotted them and followed.  \n \n\n\n",
