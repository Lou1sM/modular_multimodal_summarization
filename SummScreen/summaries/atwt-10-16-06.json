The librarian runs them off after directing them to leave the books on a top shelf since it is time for the library to close. Margo called Katie with the news of Craig's release from prison. Katie ran off to see Craig at the Lakeview and Mike headed over to Crash, forgoing a reunion with his brother-in-law. \n\n\nCraig and Lucy met at the Lakeview. Craig told her about his plans for the research fund in Jennifer's name. He handed Lucy the check and she gave it right back to him, while calling him out on his plan to upset Jennifer's family and walked out.\n\n\nUp in Barbara's suite she, Paul and Dusty discussed Craig's research fund. Barbara and Paul were beside themselves, while Dusty decided to downplay the whole situation thinking Craig was just using this to get under their skin. Lucy arrived at the suite and Paul left to talk to Craig. Barbara hovered over Lucy and Johnny, as she refused to discuss the matter in front of Lucy. Dusty told Lucy he thought her father was trying to ruffle his feathers in case there was a custody battle in the future. Lucy promised to testify in Dusty's favor if there was one.\n\n\nCraig saw Meg walk into the Lakeview and called her over. Meg questioned his plan with the fund, while Katie walked in and stopped by the bar watching the two talk. Paul arrived and sent Meg away while he told Craig he couldn't use Jennifer's name and threatened to do to Craig what Craig did to Roseanna. Meg went over to Katie and tried to get her to talk some sense into Craig, but Katie just left. Paul then went over to Meg at the bar and she told him he was falling for Craig's scheme and that it would be best for him to forget about it. \n\n\nIt was open mic night at Crash and Casey showed up to join Maddie and Gwen. Gwen saw Jack drinking at the bar and tried to console him, only to have Elwood rap a song in her honor. Gwen then sang and Casey recorded the performance to give to his brother Adam. Outside Crash Mike and Jack met and Jack told Mike about finding Carly and Simon in the hotel room. They both discussed Simon's shady character and dealings. Mike wondered out loud to Jack if he should tell Katie about Carly and Simon as Katie walked up. Jack left and they both agreed not to talk about Simon or Craig.\n\n\nIn Simon's hotel room Carly ranted over Simon's dealing with the loan shark and how her shot at becoming independent and respectable was now gone. Simon apologized and told her to leave, as he did not want her to be involved in his mistake and didn't want her to suffer any consequences of his actions. He didn't want her to have anything more to do with the project. He cared about her too much.\n\n\nAt Oakdale Memorial Luke told Jade she had to tell Will the truth about her not being pregnant. Jade said Will loves her and not Gwen, and that she would get Will to sleep with her again so she would get pregnant. Luke said Will did love Gwen and that he would tell Will if she didn't. He would make a copy of her chart and save it for proof if he needed to use it. He gave her 24 hours. He also said he would still be her friend even though he didn't agree with how she goes about things.\n\n\nWill arrived at the hospital over concern for the baby and Jade quickly sent him off for her prescription in case Luke would spill the beans. Jade then asked Luke to go get her some food. Luke left and said he would make a copy of her chart on his way. Jade then calls Gwen at Crash. Jade told Gwen to meet her at the library so she could tell her something important and hung up. Gwen decided to go since she didn't want to feel intimidated or scared of Jade. Luke and Will met back up and they both wondered where Jade disappeared to. Will asked Luke what was going on and Luke said nothing. Gwen showed up at the darkened library and Jade appeared from the shadows.\n\n\n",
