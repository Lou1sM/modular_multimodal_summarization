    "soap_central": "\n\nKatie was still feeling shaky after a 24-hour bout with Mr. Cho's sesame chicken, so it was not difficult for Brad to persuade her to stay home another day. She felt even worse when Spencer McKay rang their doorbell and Katie announced to Brad that the \"new girl\" had come to finish her off. She hid while Brad opened the door and found Spencer bearing gifts for Katie: candy and sunflowers. Brad hustled Spencer out, and Katie told him she did not buy Spencer's \"good friend\" routine. She also remarked that Liberty had not been able to find the tainted food container in the trash at WOAK. Brad found it all hard to believe, but Katie challenged him by asking whom he believed, his loving wife or someone he had known for five minutes. Brad assured her he was on her side, and the doorbell rang again. It was Henry, so Brad asked him to stay with Katie while he made a quick trip to the studio. Katie told Henry she was sure Spencer was trying to kill her and explained about the Chinese food. Henry reminded her that he and Katie had done the same thing years earlier to Molly Conlon when Katie wanted Molly's air time. Katie begged Henry to drive her to the television station and finally badgered him into agreeing. \n\n\nCarly got take-out food for her and Parker from Janet at the diner. Janet was grateful to her for letting her whine about Jack the other afternoon. Jack came in, and when Janet went to the kitchen to get some cookies for Carly's order, Carly asked him if he was truly moving on, and he agreed he was. Carly left, and Janet confessed to accusing Carly of harboring Jack in her bedroom. Janet laughed until Jack told her she was correct; he had been hiding in Carly's bedroom. He admitted he and Carly had started making love, and Janet realized she had interrupted them. She asked him directly if she had not shown up, if he would have slept with Carly. Jack hedged by saying he didn't know, and then explained that he and his ex-wife had always had a strong physical attraction. He also told Janet he loved being with her because he could trust her. Janet felt stupid for spilling everything to Carly and asked Jack to call when he figured out what he wanted. Jack walked out. \n\n\nCarly went home and Parker told her his coach had called about a tee shirt design she was creating. She told him the design was upstairs in her bedside table, and he was welcome to get it. When Parker returned, he had his father's watch in his hands and questioned his mother if Jack had been in her bedroom recently. He wanted to know if Carly and Jack were hooking up again. Carly assured her son that they were not, but that sometimes Jack forgot that they no longer belonged together. She cautioned him not to get his hopes up, and Parker chose to go for a walk. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Spencer surprised Katie, who was busy snooping in the trash. Katie explained she had lost her pen, and Spencer volunteered to help her look. Brad arrived and was angry that Katie had not stayed at home to rest. Brad and Spencer began to work on their show, and she took Brad aside and told him she was getting a vibe that Katie did not want her around. \n\n\nAfter Henry dropped Katie at WOAK, he went to Metro. Vienna chastised him for just leaving Katie there and concocted an adventure for the two of them to help Katie. She called the diner and asked Janet to take care of the cash receipts and deposit the funds so that she and Henry could go elsewhere. Janet agreed, so Henry and Vienna went to the Lakeview where Spencer McKay was staying. They broke into her room and began searching. They eventually found a large briefcase stashed under the bed and were trying to figure out how to open it when they heard the noise of someone coming in. Spencer opened her door to find Henry and Vienna lying on the bed in each other's arms. She was horrified, and the \"embarrassed\" couple jumped up and apologized before they fled. \n\n\nJanet showed up at Carly's and confronted her about pretending to be her friend while Jack was waiting in her bed. She wanted to know what would make Carly want to hurt her so badly. Carly explained that she was trying to spare Janet's feelings, but Janet lost it. Neither of them could figure out how to get Jack out of her system. Carly felt she was not good for him, and Janet was. Janet realized that Carly was really out for herself and was tired of being used. She decided she was going to make her own decisions without Carly's knowing her business. \n\n\nParker rode his bike out to the farm to return Jack's watch. He asked his dad why he was hanging around Carly when he was supposed to be dating Liberty's mother. Carly walked in, and Parker made a hasty exit. Jack apologized for leaving his watch, and Carly told him he should start letting Janet be important to him. The two of them hugged, and Carly said they should stop before someone got really hurt. The question was, were they together or not? Neither would commit to an answer, so Carly declared they were not together, and Jack agreed. \n\n\nBrad found Katie at home and accused her of being jealous of Spencer. He asked her if she thought Spencer or anyone else could steal him away from her. He reassured her that no one could accomplish that. He asked her to be nice to Spencer because he thought their new show would be a hit, and he knew he would like the extra pay. They began to kiss on the couch when the doorbell rang again. It was Spencer, in tears, telling them that their friends had broken into her hotel room. Both Brad and Katie denied sending Henry and Vienna, but neither could give a good explanation, either. Spencer cried she was sorry for whatever it was she had done to offend Katie. All Brad and Katie could offer was that Henry and Vienna were a bit of an odd couple, prone to unusual behavior. \n\n\nJanet went to a bench in Old Town to dry her tears, and she realized when she opened her purse that she had forgotten to deposit the diner's cash receipts as she had promised Vienna. Suddenly, a man grabbed her from behind and dragged her several feet before punching her in the face, stealing her purse and ripping a ring from her finger.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is hurt when Brad doesn't believe her when she tells him that Spencer is trying to kill her in order to steal her husband and job. Henry arrives to visit Katie and tells her that she is feeling guilty for doing the same thing to Molly Conlin years ago. Henry advises Katie to stop being paranoid about Spencer and enjoy her life now with Brad. Vienna also suspects that Spencer is hiding something so she and Henry break into Spencer's room at the Lakeview and find a locked box but before they can open it Spencer arrives in her room. Henry and Vienna pretend to be making love in the wrong room and leave quickly. Brad assures Katie that no other woman can replace her in his heart so she agrees to give Spencer another chance. Spencer later tells Brad and Katie that Henry and Vienna broke into her room. Jack tells Janet that he almost slept with Carly and she tells him to give her a call when he has chosen either her or Carly. Parker advises Jack to stop stringing Janet and Carly along and leave them both alone until he can decide which woman he wants in his life. Jack and Carly briefly consider getting back together but decide against it because they can't be sure that their relationship would work this time.",
