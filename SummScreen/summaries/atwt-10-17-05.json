She shows Paul the paperwork and slowly realizes that she is not telling Paul anything he doesn't already know.  She is stunned that Paul has known all along and not told Jennifer.

They talk seriously, then kiss, and then begin to make love.\n\n\nJack and Carly suddenly realize that if Gwen is the baby that Iris had with Ray Tenney, then Carly and Gwen are half-sisters. Carly wonders if Gwen knew that all along and wants to confront her.\n\n\nPaul follows Meg to the hotel where Dusty and Jen are staying.
