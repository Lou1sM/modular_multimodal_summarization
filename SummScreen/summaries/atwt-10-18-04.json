Lucy and Alison see an article in the paper about the press conference, and they head for the gym, despite all that Dusty has done to keep Lucy from knowing about the press conference.  Dusty tells Aaron that his role is to keep in the background and make Ortega look good.  When Lucy arrives, Dusty tries to get her to leave, but Lucy is so hurt that Dusty lets her stay in spite of Dominic's objections.  The press conference starts, and, as planned, all the attention goes to Rafael Ortega, until he and Lucy see each other.  Lucy , obviously recognizing him from Montega, runs to him and exclaims, \"Jose'!\"  The two hug as flashbulbs pop.\n\n\nAt lunch, Ben insists to Bob Hughes and Jessica that he has been taking Ibuprofen, rather than prescription painkillers.  Ben then accuses Jessica of trying to ruin his career as payback for his serving her with divorce papers.  Bob tells Ben that, since a complaint has been lodged against a staff member, Bob is obligated to investigate the complaint.  Bob calmly tells Ben that he merely has to take a urine test, but Ben angrily refuses and storms out of the restaurant.\n\n\nAt Carly's house, where Rosanna is watching Carly's children, Paul and Rosanna find that they can discuss happy memories of Cabot, their first step in finding their way back to one another.

Carly agrees to go home without him, and Jack promises to come home the next day at the latest.  Carly gives him her address and phone numbers, as well as a credit card for his plane ticket.  Then she kisses him and goes home.  When she arrives at her front door, Paul leaves so that the sisters can talk.  Paul goes directly to the diner and tells Will about his reunion with Rosanna.  Carly takes Rosanna out on to the porch, so that Parker will not overhear, and tells Rosanna that Jack cannot remember his Oakdale family, and that Jack has married Julia.
