He got Emily to leave and then asked Meg to help him find out the truth about Jennifer's baby. Meg asked how much he and Jennifer had already found out, and he told her not much, but that if they could have a blood test done, they could resolve this whole issue and prove that the baby was Jennifer's. When Meg realized that Dusty was only being nice to her because she could help him do something for Jennifer, she decided not to tell him about the DNA results that she already had in hand. \n\n\nPaul tried to convince Jennifer that Dusty was not the person she should be relying on to help her prove her baby was still alive. He told her that he would help her instead if she would just let him. Emily then called Paul from the hospital and told him she was afraid Meg was getting ready to tell Dusty the truth, so Paul rushed over to the hospital, leaving Jennifer at Java with Barbara, who had walked in while they were talking. Barbara told Jennifer that Will was in trouble because of Gwen kidnapping the baby; Jennifer was very concerned to learn that the baby had been taken to New York by Will and Gwen and wanted to know where the baby was right now. Barbara said she assumed he was with Carly and Jack, but she wanted Jennifer to go to the custody hearing with her so she could try to talk some sense into Will about being involved with Gwen and the baby. Jennifer said she couldn't go right now because she had to take care of something more important, and she rushed off to the hospital to find Dusty, Paul, and Meg.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Paul cornered Meg after diverting Dusty's attention by faking a phone call to him from Jennifer (which Emily actually placed instead). He tried to convince Meg that it would be in her best interests to fake the blood test and convince Jennifer that she was wrong about her baby being alive, because then, Jennifer would hate Dusty for having led her on in her belief that her son might be alive, and with some help from Paul, Jennifer would want to break things off with Dusty entirely, leaving him open for Meg to date. Meg couldn't believe that Paul could continue thinking this was best for his sister.\n\n\nWhen Jennifer got to the hospital, she was hysterical and told Dusty, Paul, Meg, and Emily that her baby wasn't safe with the people who were taking care of him and that they needed to get the blood tests done right now, so that she could get her baby back. Dusty tried to calm her down, and as they watched Dusty and Jennifer embrace, Paul took the opportunity to again try to persuade Meg to not tell Jennifer and Dusty the truth. Meg then told them all that she was going to perform the blood test, to help Jennifer find the truth.\n\n\nHolden and Lily rushed Luke to the hospital, where Susan ran several tests to try to find out what was wrong beyond the obvious infection that he had. Keith came, too, trying to ensure that Luke was going to be okay. Holden and Lily both apologized to him briefly for not believing him when he said that he thought Luke was still seriously ill. Then Susan returned and asked to speak to Holden and Lily. She told them that Luke's kidneys were shutting down and that he needed specialized help or he would die; she told them he would have to be moved to St. Paul, where he could undergo dialysis and see a pediatric specialist. Lily was stricken to hear that Luke might actually die, although Holden assured her that wouldn't happen. Keith overheard Susan telling Lily that Luke needed to get to St. Paul as soon as possible, and he offered to immediately fly Luke up there, but Lily turned on him and angrily said none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for him and that there was no way she was ever going to let him have anything to do with Luke again. Holden then arranged to have Lucinda's corporate jet take Luke to St. Paul, and Susan arranged for a MedEvac helicopter to take him to the airport. Emma arrived suddenly at the hospital, having had a premonition that something was very wrong, and she told Lily that both she and Holden should go with Luke to St. Paul, and that she would take care of Faith and Natalie for them.\n\n\nBefore the custody hearing, Will told Gwen he was concerned about her health because she looked like she was about to pass out and she hadn't stayed at the hospital to have the MRI they wanted her to have. She assured him she was okay and that she could make it through the hearing. In the courtroom, Carly told Jack she thought she had a way to turn everything around and win the custody case, but Jack tried to convince her that her best option was to try to work things out with Gwen. She disagreed and refused to try. Jessica came in and told Jack and Carly that Cass had managed to get a new judge assigned to the case. Gwen and Will came into the courtroom, followed by Iris and Cass Winthrop. Gwen had already told her mother that she didn't want her to come to the hearing, but Cass said he had insisted she be there because it would help Gwen's case if the judge could see that she had extended family who could help her with the baby. When the judge came in, Carly insisted that she had to make a statement, and the judge decided to give her 1 minute. Carly tried to explain about Iris having falsely accused her of murdering a baby boy, only to recently find out that the baby had been Gwen, and that they were sisters. The judge said he didn't believe in listening to grown adults make excuses for their behavior based on their childhoods. He then stated that he had decided that the baby was to be removed from the Snyder's care, and Gwen assumed that meant she was going to get custody, especially when the judge said he was going to recommend to Tom Hughes that no charges be pressed against Gwen and Will for kidnapping the baby, because he could understand what motivated her to do so and because she gave the judge her assurance that she'd learned her lesson and wouldn't do anything like that again. But the judge stunned everyone by saying that he had decided not to award full custody to Gwen either.\n\n\n\n\n",

Meg agrees to help a desperate Jennifer find out the truth about her baby. Paul and Emily worry that despite their efforts to persuade Meg not to tell Jennifer the truth Meg might follow her heart and tell Jennifer Rory is her son. Carly and Gwen are shocked when the judge doesn't award custody of Rory to either one of them.",
