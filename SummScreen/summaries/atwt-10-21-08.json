    "soap_central": "\n\nMargo was leaving the Oakdale Police Station when Dani Andropoulos came in to apply for the job of profiler and bragged about her sterling qualifications. She intimated to Margo that all Chief Margo had to do was say the word to hire her, but Margo instead made some sarcastic remarks about her \"Auntie Em,\" and walked out. \n\n\nBrad found Spencer searching the classified ads for a new place to live. She reminded him that she had walked into her hotel room and found two crazies making out on her bed, referring to Henry and Vienna and their aborted search attempt. Brad admitted that his friends were afraid she had a \"thing\" for him, which set Spencer into gales of laughter. Brad was a bit insulted by the thought that the two of them as a couple was so humorous. Spencer assured him that she was no competition for Katie, but Brad showered her with confidence-building compliments. \n\n\nKatie went to the diner and told Henry and Vienna it was time to call the conspiracy squad off Spencer. Vienna said it was no time to quit because they had found a suspicious locked suitcase hidden under Spencer's bed. Katie could not think of anything Spencer could have in that bag that involved her, but Henry suggested they go back to the Lakeview and break the lock on the suitcase. Katie was uneasy that Brad would not approve, but she gave the go-ahead to her sleuths in her most subtle manner. \n\n\nJack was fixing Emma's sink at the farm and had just unloosed a geyser when Janet walked in, and they both got drenched. Fortunately Janet was wearing a raincoat, and she announced to Jack that she had a surprise for him. She was just unbuttoning her coat when Margo barged in. She had learned that Jack had caught Janet's mugger and was there to convince him to come back to work on the police force. She offered him the same pay and his old desk back. She urged him to call her with his affirmative answer, but if he said no, she would not ask again. After Margo left, Janet suggested Jack think about why he became a police officer in the first place, and she vowed to stand by him, no matter what. Jack suddenly became a man of action and grabbed Janet's arm and pulled her out of the house. \n\n\nKatie went to work at WOAK and interrupted raucous fun between Brad and Spencer, who were supposed to be rehearsing. Spencer apologized for accusing Katie of being part of the Henry/Vienna conspiracy. Katie felt guilty because she knew Henry and Vienna were probably at that very moment attempting to open the suitcase hidden under Spencer's bed. Spencer announced that she thought she would go back to the Lakeview for a bit of a nap, but Katie improvised quickly by inviting Spencer to lunch with her and Brad. They went to the Lakeview, although Katie tried suggesting other restaurants. Spencer felt dizzy, and Katie pulled out all the stops to keep her from going up to her room. She suggested the ladies' room off the lobby, and Spencer went there. Brad tried to confirm with Katie that she had, indeed, called off Henry and Vienna, but Katie took off to make a call. She talked to Henry in Spencer's room to warn him that Spencer was close by, and he told her the suitcase was crammed full of money. Brad and Spencer found Katie, so she told Henry in code to replace the bag and get out. Spencer bowed out of lunch to go to her room to lie down. Brad realized that Katie was back in the thick of things, so Katie explained what Henry and Vienna had found in Spencer's case. \n\n\nJack dragged Janet to the police station and accepted Margo's offer of reinstatement, beginning the next day. When Margo stepped out of the interview room, Jack asked Janet for the surprise she had been promising him all day. She opened her raincoat so only he could see inside, and Jack was - surprised. The two of them left quickly. \n\n\nKatie was frustrated, so she went to the Oakdale Police Station to speak to Margo. Margo was in conference with the Mayor, but Katie found Dani Andropoulos still waiting there. Dani offered to help, so Katie spilled everything about her friends finding a suitcase full of probably stolen money. \n\n\nJack was enthused about what Janet was not wearing under her raincoat, but the two of them could not think of anywhere to go to be alone. The farm always had people arriving and leaving, and Janet was still bunking at Katie and Brad's, along with Liberty. They stopped for a drink, and Jack asked if Janet would consent to live with him, but she turned him down. Jack was confused and asked her what would make things easier for her. Janet told him she wanted the whole fairy tale: husband, house, family. She thanked him for making her realize that she was worthy of having it all. Jack continued to ponder how the two of them could be together, and after a long kiss, Janet hinted that she knew a way, but she wasn't about to tell him. He had to figure it out himself. \n\n\nSpencer barged into WOAK toting her notorious suitcase. She warned Katie and Brad to be careful where they spent it and then opened the bag. The money was not real; Spencer claimed it was a present for her 10-year-old autistic nephew in Arizona. She asked Katie why she hated her so much and stormed out. Brad could not believe that Katie had actually made a police report, and they argued about Katie's insecurities and her allowing Vienna to fill her head with paranoid fantasies. Brad ordered her to call Henry and Vienna and to make them quit harassing Spencer. Instead, Katie went to the diner and spoke with her friends in person. She explained that the money was fake, but Henry and Vienna swore the money they saw was authentic. Henry declared someone had obviously made a switch. \n\n\nDani ambushed Margo again at the police station, still badgering her about the profiling position. She said she had solved Katie's problem for her and saved Margo a good hour of investigative work. Margo was still non-committal about whether that had given Dani a leg up on the job.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Henry and Vienna break into Spencer's room and find a suitcase full of money which Spencer later tells Brad and Katie is fake money she bought as a present for her autistic nephew who loves to count money. Spencer is hurt that Katie sent the police to question her about it. Brad thinks Katie doesn't want him to be a success without her as his partner. Katie apologizes to Spencer and promises Brad that Henry and Vienna won't bother Spencer again. Henry tells Katie that the money in the suitcase was real and that Spencer must have switched the money in the suitcase before she showed the suitcase to Brad and Katie. Margo and Janet finally persuade Jack to take his job back at the station. Dani applies for the job of police profiler but Margo isn't sure that she is the right person for the job. Jack wants he and Janet to live together but she turns down the offer telling him she is an all or nothing kind of woman.",
