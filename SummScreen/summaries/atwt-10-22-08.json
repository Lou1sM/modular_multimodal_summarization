She offered to give Lily a lift, but her former friend refused her help. Lily called Holden, but he did not answer. As Carly was driving out, she offered assistance again, and this time Lily accepted. Carly drove her home and was surprised when Lily invited her in for coffee. Over their refreshment, Lily told Carly that she and Holden were giving their marriage another try, and that meant putting old relationships behind them. Carly apologized again for her affair with Holden and said she had missed Lily's friendship. \n\n\nLily offered to try acting as if the two of them were friends again, and Carly confided that she and Jack had decided to steer clear of one another. Besides, Jack was dating Janet. Lily asked a searching question: had Carly tried so hard to set up Jack and Janet because, in her heart, Carly felt that Janet was no threat to her? Lily suggested that Carly stop being Janet's cheerleader and to tell Jack how she really felt about him. Carly realized that Lily was right in her assessment of Janet, and she left in a hurry, hoping she was not too late. When Holden came home, he was pleased that Lily and Carly had made some progress in restoring their friendship. \n\n\nAaron met with Alison and told her his lawyer was sending her a packet of divorce papers. Alison was shocked that Aaron had gotten moving on the dissolution of their marriage so quickly. She asked if the two of them could remain friends, but Aaron nixed that idea immediately. \n\n\nHolden went to the farm and gave Jack a bottle of wine to celebrate his reinstatement on the police force. Jack shared that Janet had squelched the idea of moving in with him, and Holden wondered how his cousin would feel about life without Janet. Jack, in turn, asked Holden about Carly, and was happy to learn that Lily and Holden were back together. Aaron came in, and Jack asked for some newlywed advice, not realizing that was the last subject Aaron wanted to address. After Jack left, Holden asked his son if he had seen Alison, and Aaron told him he did not know which was worse, Alison's cheating on him or her not fighting him on the divorce. Aaron was sad that there was no way he could go back to the way things were before with Alison. \n\n\nLuke found Noah working at the coffee shop, where Casey spilled the news that Luke's name was on the ballot for the election of student government officers on campus. Noah was hurt that he was the last to know of Luke's plans. Luke apologized for that and asked for Noah's approval. Noah was hesitant because he was fearful Luke would be hurt if he was not successful, and Casey agreed. Alison came in and Casey was quick to notice her glum mood. She confided to him that she was about to be served with divorce papers. \n\n\nLuke's old love, Kevin, with his entourage, came in the coffee shop and asked Luke if he would be supporting him for office. Luke introduced himself as Kevin's new opponent. As the group left, Kevin's campaign manager, Mark Vero, made a snide remark about gambling to Casey. Luke asked who Mark was, and Casey explained he was a fraternity brother and campaign manager to Kevin. Then Casey remarked that Luke could use someone like that on his own campaign, and Noah proposed Casey for the job. \n\n\nJanet told Liberty that Jack had asked her to move in with him, but she had turned him down. Liberty was horrified that her mother might have blown her last chance at happiness. She was concerned that Mr. Right would once again turn into Mr. Dead Wrong. Janet explained she was holding out for the big prize and called her daughter \"Debbie Downer\" as she sent miss doom and gloom off to school. Liberty had mentioned a sad, jilted character in the book she was reading in English literature, and Janet visualized herself as Miss Haversham in \"Great Expectations,\" sitting forever in her wedding dress, surrounded by cobwebs. \n\n\nLuke's group attempted to talk Casey into the position of campaign manager, and Alison seemed willing to participate, as well, in spite of the fact she was not an Oakdale University student. Mark, Kevin's manager, came back to their table and made several anti-gay remarks about Luke while inviting Casey to come to a rally at Al's Diner. As soon as Mark left, Casey agreed to run Luke's campaign, provided Alison would help. Alison asked what her job description would be, and Casey basically described the work of a spy. Alison left to check out the rally, since she was unknown on campus, and Kevin approached her and introduced himself. He took Alison inside, and Mark announced that Luke Snyder was Kevin's opponent in the race and then made several disparaging remarks about changes that would come about if someone like Luke was in charge. Alison listened a bit but then walked out in disgust. She reported back to Team Luke that she had heard nothing but homophobic remarks. What Alison did not know was that after she left, Kevin told his followers that Luke was a good guy and had as much right to run for office as he did. \n\n\nJack went to the police station for his first day back and started on mounds of paper work. Liberty showed up, worried about her mother. She said her mother had mentioned that she wanted something more permanent than what Jack had offered. Liberty begged Jack to break off his relationship with Janet before he broke her heart completely. On her way out of the station, Liberty took a call from her mother, who had guessed where Liberty had gone. Then Janet called Jack, and the two agreed to meet in Old Town. They both arrived soon, and Jack asked if she had been referring to marriage when she said she wanted the whole fairy tale. Janet said yes, but that she did not want Jack to feel guilty about anything. She prattled on, not making much sense, until Jack told her to shut her mouth for 30 seconds and she might learn what was going to happen next. Janet became suddenly silent, and Jack got down on one knee and asked her to marry him. Neither of them noticed Carly watching from around the corner.\n\n\n",
