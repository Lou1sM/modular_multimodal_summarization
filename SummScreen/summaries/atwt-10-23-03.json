Mike fired her but told Katie that she was not Glenda's replacement and to go home. Katie convinced Mike that he needed her to take care of him until he could find someone else.  Mike was tired and after Katie helped him settle in, he fell asleep holding Katie's hand. After Katie thought he was asleep, she started to apologize and explain to him how she was feeling after Simon died.  She told him that she would never hurt him intentionally.\n\n\nBen and Tom tried to talk Jessica out of bringing rape charges against Marshall. Jessica was insistent so Tom called the judge who advised against it. Tom said he wasn't going to waste the taxpayer's money re-opening the case. Instead they were going to arrest Marshall and make life miserable for him until he left town.   Ben tried once again to convince Jessica not to go through with the charges. Jessica wouldn't relent so Ben said he would stand by her. At the Halloween party, Marshall was thanking Bonnie for helping him with Sarah. They call a truce when Sarah enlisted them in a few Halloween games. As Marshall was bobbing for apples, the police came in and arrested Marshall. Marshall asked Bonnie to take Sarah home.  At the station, Marshall told Jessica that he would destroy her. Jessica told Marshall that she would put Sarah on the stand if Marshall didn't plead guilty.  Bonnie heard it and started to defend Marshall.\n\n\nPaul told Jennifer to pack her bags and move out. Jennifer tried to tell Paul that she was only trying to protect him. Paul yelled at her and told her she was a miniature Barbara. Jennifer and Rose argue and just as Rose is about to hit Jennifer, Paul stops her and asked to speak to Jennifer alone.  Jennifer continued to try to convince her brother that Rose was no good for him.  Rose told Paul that she couldn't go on like this and Paul agreed. He asked Jennifer to leave.  As Paul was listening to the tape, James came to him and told him that Rose was a fake and Paul should end it once and for all. Paul was arguing with James in his head and shouted out that he wanted James dead. Rose walked in and asked Paul who he was talking to.\n\n\nHolden went to Metro and threw Aaron's keys on the bar. He told Dusty that Aaron doesn't work for Dusty anymore. Molly interrupted and started to defend Dusty.  Holden said he knew that Jack was going to bust Aaron. Dusty accused Holden of setting Aaron up and didn't know why Holden was blaming him.  Molly continued to defend Dusty and said that Holden was setting a bad example for Aaron. Holden turned the blame on Molly for not keeping an eye on Aaron and left.\n\n\n",
