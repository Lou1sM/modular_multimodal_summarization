Carly apologized for being there, but said she was too shocked at what she was seeing to move. She wished the two of them good luck and dashed into the coffee shop. Janet was stunned both by the proposal and Carly's showing up, and she told Jack she needed time to think. She left, and Jack went into the coffee shop to ask Carly if she had planned the whole scenario. Carly told him there was no way she knew he was proposing then, and Jack admitted it was rather spur-of-the-moment on his part, too. Carly made fun of his romantic skills in proposing without a ring, and she offered many suggestions in the romance department. Jack told her to stop and to quit worrying about his problems, and he went to work. \n\n\nHolden talked with Meg who was living back at the Snyder farm. Paul knocked on the door, and Meg went upstairs while Holden let him in. Paul told Holden that Meg and their baby were the most important things in his life, but Holden scolded him about trying to set up Dusty with the woman and child impersonating Lucy and Johnny. Paul countered with reminding Holden how Dusty had gone after Lily. Holden advised Paul to get more psychiatric treatment because he was sick. \n\n\nAt Worldwide, Emily was pleased to have alone time with Dusty, but he told her he was preparing to leave for a trip to New York. Emily attempted to invite herself along, but Dusty was reluctant to agree. He told her to stay home and run her newspaper. When Emily pursued the matter, Dusty broke the news that their romance was finished. He was afraid that she wanted more than he could give, and besides, he was still in love with Jennifer, his dead wife. He walked out, leaving Emily devastated. \n\n\nJanet went home and told Liberty that Jack had proposed. The girl was ecstatic, but Janet tired to calm her. Liberty had the color scheme of the wedding all planned before her mother could get in a word to tell her she had not yet accepted the proposal. Janet explained how Carly had shown up unexpectedly and put a damper on the moment. She called Carly a \"Super Magnet\" who could always pull Jack back to her. Janet was feeling that she and Jack did not really belong together, and Carly's appearance was a sign. Liberty advised her mother to stop sabotaging herself. \n\n\nHolden went into the coffee shop and sat with Carly. He thanked her for helping Lily with her car trouble, and Carly told him that Jack had just proposed to Janet. Holden was surprised and told Carly he didn't think Jack was ready for that step yet. He asked Carly how she felt about it, but she had no ready answer. She remembered then that Janet had not given Jack an answer to his proposal, either. Holden told her that she knew if she put her mind to it, she could always get Jack back. He suggested she had time to execute a plan, since Jack and Janet were not actually engaged yet. \n\n\nPaul summoned Emily to Fairwinds, and she seemed glad to get her mind off her troubles. Paul demanded to know what Dusty was up to and found it hard to believe that Dusty was still hung up on Paul's sister, Jennifer. Emily told Paul that he was acing like a \"freakin' psychopath,\" and he needed to get help. Paul said Meg had left him and gone back to the farm, and he didn't know what to do. Emily suggested he do exactly what Meg wanted, and that was to go back under a doctor's care. She offered to drive him to the hospital, and this time Paul agreed. \n\n\nOn his way to the airport, Dusty visited Meg to tell her he was off to New York. He thought her leaving Paul was a good thing, and suddenly Meg began having severe abdominal cramps. Dusty got her some water, but she got no relief, so Dusty said he was driving her to Memorial. \n\n\nAt the police station, Margo noticed that Jack seemed a million miles away. Jack said he had a serious question for her and asked if it made a difference how a guy proposed. He explained about his aborted proposal to Janet, and Margo asked if Jack was sure he really wanted to marry Janet. She reminded him how Carly had faked her terminal condition to win Jack back before, but Jack was convinced that her showing up in Old Town at just the right moment was coincidental. Jack asked if he needed to sweep Janet off her feet, and Margo let him go early to make preparations for some romance. \n\n\nJack called Janet and asked her to meet him in room 206 at the Lakeview in about an hour. Liberty was almost more excited than her mother that Jack had called back and was obviously preparing a romantic evening. Janet got dressed for the occasion, and Liberty wished her mother good luck. She said she would be home studying but would listen for an exciting call from Janet. Janet was picking up her purse to leave when the doorbell rang. It was another surprise visit from Carly. Janet explained she was on her way to meet Jack at the Lakeview and get officially engaged, but Carly asked if Janet was all right and pointed to her face. Janet looked in the mirror and was horrified to see she had broken out in unsightly hives. She told Carly that happened to her during stressful times and suggested Carly leave to lessen her stress. After Carly's exit, Janet begged Liberty to run to the drug store for some antihistamines, which her daughter did. Janet called Jack and told him she was running late, and he understood. When Liberty came back with the medication, Janet doubled the usual dose and lay on the couch to relax and let the medication work. \n\n\nDusty brought Meg to the hospital, and while they were waiting for an exam room, Emily and Paul arrived, as well. A nurse took Meg into a room and left her. Paul walked in and tried to speak to his wife, but she told him how much he frightened her, and he left. Meanwhile, in the hall, Emily verbally attacked Dusty until he told her to shut up. \n\n\nAt the Lakeview, Jack signed for an elegant room service delivery including champagne and a single white rose. As he was lighting the candles, he heard a knock at the door and assumed it was Janet. It was Carly, however, also bearing champagne. She offered to inspect his other romantic trappings, but Jack could only think about how to get her out of there. She kept referring to Janet as \"the un-Carly.\" \n\n\nLiberty could not awaken Janet on the couch, so she called Jack and explained what had happened. Jack promised to hang in there at the hotel until Janet was functional again. Carly overheard Jack's part of the conversation and took it as an invitation to stay and partake of the spread that was \"already paid for.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dusty breaks up with Emily telling her that he will never be over his feelings for Jennifer. Emily tells Paul the reason Dusty broke up with her and also advises Paul to stop acting like James and come up with a plan to win Meg's heart again. Emily advises Paul to pretend to get medical help so that Meg will be willing to give him a second chance. Emily takes Paul to the hospital but they are not happy to see Meg there with Dusty because Meg is having cramps. Emily tells Dusty to stop playing the hero to pregnant women and also accuses him of trying to replace Jennifer and Johnny with Meg and her baby. Jack proposes to Janet but Carly interrupts so Jack tries a more romantic proposal at the Lakeview but Janet is unable to make it because she gets a case of hives because she is nervous about Jack's proposal. Carly realizes that she must try once more to win Jack's heart before it is too late. Carly later arrives at the Lakeview and asks Jack if she can have dinner with him since Janet can't come because she is sick with hives.",
