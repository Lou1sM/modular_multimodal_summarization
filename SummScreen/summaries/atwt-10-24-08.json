    "soap_central": "\n\nAt WOAK, Brad and Spencer were filming a segment of \"Oakdale 411,\" but Brad was distracted and on edge because of his disagreements with Katie about Spencer. Katie went to the police station, where she told Margo her concerns about Spencer and confessed to attempting to dig up information on Spencer. Katie asked Margo not to pursue her complaint against Spencer. Margo wouldn't make any promises. \n\n\nLiberty managed to wake Janet up despite the multiple antihistamines Janet had taken, but Janet was still covered in hives. Liberty told Janet that Jack wouldn't care how she looked, but Janet insisted she couldn't let Jack see her looking that way. Liberty told her mom to at least call Jack to let him know she couldn't meet him that evening, saying that once Janet heard Jack say, \"I love you,\" she'd begin to relax and could recover from the hives. \n\n\nIn the hotel room Jack had rented, Carly made herself at home, eating some of the oysters on the half shell that room service had brought up for Jack and Janet. Carly teased Jack until he finally tried an oyster; when pushed by Carly, Jack ate a second oyster and decided he liked them. \n\n\nThey drank champagne with the oysters, and Carly suggested that Jack practice his proposal on her. After Jack told Carly what he intended to say to Janet, Carly remarked that it was forgettable, unlike his proposals to her. Jack said Carly couldn't possibly remember each of his proposals to her word for word, but she assured him she did. Carly then reminded Jack of the first time he'd proposed to her. Jack remembered but said it made him sad, because that wasn't how they were anymore. Carly said, \"We're not over yet, Jack.\" \n\n\nJanet agreed to call Jack, while Liberty went to the store. When Jack answered his phone, Janet asked if their date could wait until the next day. Jack assured Janet that it could and told her to take care of herself. He hung up without having said, \"I love you,\" and that worried Janet. \n\n\nCarly said it would be a shame to waste the champagne, and Jack opened the second bottle. Carly told Jack he could use some more practice on his proposal. Jack said anything would be better than the time he proposed to Carly in front of Emily and Craig, but Carly said she hadn't cared who was there at the time. Jack then remembered the time he had proposed when Sage was a baby. Carly remembered, and she asked if Jack remembered why he had said all the beautiful things he'd said when he proposed that time. Jack said it was coming back to him but that there was something Carly should know. Carly realized Jack wasn't drunk, and she asked him what he was trying to do to her. \n\n\nJack pointed out that Carly was the one who had walked in and gotten Jack to eat the oysters and drink the champagne and remember his previous proposals to her. Carly said she thought Jack was trying to see how far he could go with her, to prove to himself he could be true to Janet. Jack said he knew he could be true to Janet forever, and he suggested Carly had been trying to prove that no matter who he claimed to love, he would end up in bed with Carly. Angry, Carly turned and tried to walk out of the room. Jack said he wouldn't let her leave until she told him why she'd done it. Carly looked at Jack and said, \"You know. Don't you know?\" \n\n\nJack asked why Carly had kept pushing him towards Janet. Carly told Jack about Lily's theory, that Carly was being Janet's advocate because she hoped that Jack could never love Janet the way he'd loved her, and that at some point, he would realize that. Jack asked what Carly had expected to happen after that, and Carly said, \"You'd marry me again. And we'd head out toward forever once more. And this time, we'd get there.\" \n\n\nJack told Carly he loved her and always would. He said loving Carly was a constant for him, a necessity. Jack said loving Carly was easy, but living with her was \"harder than hell,\" and he couldn't do it anymore. Carly said she couldn't either, but she thought they could try something different, that they could change. Jack said he didn't want to change, and more importantly, he didn't want Carly to change. He told her she was a force of nature, and he didn't want to always be the guy who was holding her back. \n\n\nCarly told Jack they could find a way to make it work, and she asked Jack to tell her what he wanted. Jack replied, \"Janet. I want Janet.\" When Carly asked why, Jack said, \"Because she's not you. She's as far from you as I can get.\" Jack said he didn't mean to hurt Carly, but he wanted peace, and he and Carly couldn't offer that to each other. \n\n\nCarly asked if Jack would go ahead and propose to Janet that night, but Jack said he thought he would wait until the morning, because the timing didn't feel right anymore. Carly said Janet would surely say yes, and she was glad Jack was going to sleep on it. Jack said he wasn't going to change his mind, and Carly said she knew that, but she wished he would. \n\n\nKatie went home, where she found Janet attempting to recover from the hives and worrying about having ruined things with Jack. Janet told Katie about the botched marriage proposal, and Katie told Janet about her fight with Brad. Katie assured Janet that Jack still loved her and pointed out that Janet had managed to win Jack despite Carly's presence in Jack's life, something Katie hadn't been able to do. Janet reminded Katie that Brad loved her, and Katie decided to go to the station to try to make up with Brad. \n\n\nAt WOAK, Kim called Brad and Spencer into her office, where she introduced Spencer to Margo, noting that Margo was the chief of police. Margo told Spencer that she was also Kim's daughter-in-law, and Brad pointed out that Margo was his sister-in-law. Margo told Spencer she'd heard that Spencer had had some trouble at the Lakeview. Spencer said she had told the police everything she could about the break-ins and that she didn't want to press charges against anyone. Margo gave Spencer her card and told her to call if she ever wanted to discuss it further. \n\n\nAfter Margo left, Spencer told Brad she couldn't believe Katie would send her own sister to stalk her like that. Katie walked up, unaware of what had just happened, and gave Brad a kiss. Brad didn't respond, and when Katie asked what was wrong, Brad told her about Margo's visit. Katie swore the only thing she had asked Margo to do was to forget about the whole incident with Spencer, but Brad didn't seem to believe her. \n\n\nBrad and Katie had to tape a segment of Oakdale Now, but they snipped at each other throughout the taping. Kim lost her temper and stopped the taping, telling Brad and Katie to stop having hissy fits on the air. Kim announced that she was pulling the show off the air temporarily, giving them a hiatus for a few weeks so that everyone could relax and get back to business as usual. Katie and Brad were stunned by Kim's decision, but Kim said it was final. Kim wanted to focus on Oakdale 411 with Brad and Spencer, assuming that Brad could act professionally enough to keep that show going. When Katie complained about Kim's decision to stop airing Oakdale Now, Kim said, \"It's just a break!\" Katie looked pointedly at Spencer and said, \"And a lucky one at that,\" before storming off the set. \n\n\nKatie went to see Margo and told her what had just happened. She was angry that Margo had gone to see Spencer, but she admitted the whole mess was actually her own fault. Katie burst into tears, telling Margo she didn't want to get divorced again. Margo tried to reassure her, saying Brad loved her and everything would be fine. \n\n\nLiberty brought Janet some ice cream to help make her feel better about the missed evening with Jack. As they ate, Janet told Liberty it didn't matter what happened with Jack, because Liberty was the love of her life. The doorbell rang, and Jack called out for Janet. Janet panicked and told Liberty to get rid of him, but Liberty insisted her mom open the door, hives and all. \n\n\nWhen Jack saw Janet, he smiled, and she told him to go ahead and laugh. Jack said she looked beautiful, but Janet said that was because Jack had apparently been drinking. Jack admitted to that but said it wasn't just the champagne talking. He then told Janet to imagine a room full of oysters and flowers and champagne, with soft music playing. He told her to imagine himself standing there with his heart in his hands, then said she didn't have to imagine that part, because he was right there with her. Jack told Janet he needed her and that she was all he wanted. She said he was all she wanted, too, \"and then some.\" Jack then asked, \"Will you marry me?\" From her bedroom, Liberty called out, \"Say yes, Mom! Please!\" Janet said yes excitedly, and she and Jack kissed as Liberty watched from the hallway. \n\n\nCarly went to Yo's and drank some shots. When the bartender remarked that Carly looked like she'd just lost her best friend, Carly said although that wasn't a very original thing to say, it happened to be true.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
