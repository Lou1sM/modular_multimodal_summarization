Jen told Barbara that she lied about believing her baby was dead and that Dusty was helping her find the truth. Meanwhile Meg drew a sample of her own blood and pretended it was Jen's blood so the blood tests will come back negative. Dusty insisted he be there while the hospital tech ran the tests. The tech ran the tests and they proved that Jen was not Rory's mother. Dusty told Jen the results and Jen became hysterical saying the tests were wrong. Paul told Meg she did the right thing but Meg was not to sure. \n\n\nHal asked for Jack's badge and put him on leave without pay. Carly walked in and begged Hal to reconsider saying Jack only did what he did to protect her. Jack told Carly not to worry about it and that everything would be ok. The main thing Jack was concerned about was Carly and Gwen's relationship. Jack wanted Carly to apologize to Gwen and reminded her that they are sisters. \n\n\nBJ wanted Henry to help him get some alone time with Katie. Henry did not want to get involved but BJ told him his intentions were harmless. Henry went to Katie's and told Mike he broke BJ's car and needed his help. After Henry and Mike left BJ showed up. After looking for BJ's car for hours Mike decided to stop looking and went back home. Mike walked in on BJ and Katie dancing. Katie told Mike there was nothing going on and BJ left. Feeling suspicious of Henry's story Mike called him and asked him if Henry's story was true about breaking BJ's car. Henry told Mike that he was telling the truth and would not lie to him. After Henry got off the phone BJ gave Henry a lot of money as a thank you.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "BJ convinces Henry, through the power of the almighty dollar, to help him get Mike out of the way temporarily, so he can spend some alone time with Katie. Henry runs Mike all around town on a wild gooses chase to fix BJ's car, while BJ shows up coincidentally right after at Katie's to talk about the Halloween party. They get talking and soon Katie is dancing closely with BJ, who claims he has two left feet. Mike interrupts, but BJ covers. Later, Mike wonders if Henry helped BJ get some alone time with Katie? Henry claims to not have a clue what he is talking about. Moments later, Henry becomes wealthier thanks to BJ's appreciation. Jack has to face Hal knowing he lied to him and committed a crime in covering up evidence. Hal is hurt, but won't arrest him. He has to hand it over to IAD; Jack will be suspended for a couple of weeks. Carly is beside herself over having made everyone's lives so hard. She starts by apologizing to Nancy and then more importantly to Jack. He doesn't feel she owes him one, but she may owe someone else one instead. She can't apologize to Gwen; she won't. Jack continues; Rory is her nephew; Gwen is her sister. Will she at least consider it? Paul continues to try to get Meg to see things his way. She is disgusted by his way, but at the same time is conflicted. She wants Dusty. Would letting Jen believe her baby is really dead send Dusty into her arms? Meg wrestles with her decision, but then takes a blood sample from herself. Later, when the tech is taking the samples, Meg again has an attack on conscience, but ends up taking a blood vial from her back pocket. Later, as an elated Jen, Dusty, Paul, Emily and Barbara await the results, Meg delivers the bad news. Jen is not a match to Rory; the baby is not hers. Jen is devastated; Dusty is shocked; Paul is thrilled. It is over now he believes. Barbara takes Jen home after blaming Dusty for Jen's disappointment. Meanwhile, Paul is the only one happy over this; Emily and Meg seem disturbed by it in the end.",
