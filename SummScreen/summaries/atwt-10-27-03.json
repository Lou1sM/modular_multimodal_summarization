I love you...you have to forgive me.\"  Lucy answers that she feels that she doesn't know Aaron any more, since he blew off her homecoming dance to help Dusty with illegal gambling.  Aaron again tries to excuse his actions, insisting that he wanted to impress her with money since she is about to go off to college where she will be surrounded by future C.E.O.'s.  When he begs forgiveness for his mistake, Lucy continues to say that she can't forgive him for lying to her, and again she asks him to take back his jacket.  Aaron turns and leaves, saying, \"Nothing here belongs to me any more.\"   \n\n\nAt the rented hotel suite, Alison, wearing a hotel bathrobe, frantically tries to stop Chris from breaking up with her by telling her that she now feels like a woman, not a girl.  Chris interrupts her with, \"We're not okay.  I think we need to stop seeing each other.\"  Alison's eyes fill with tears, but Chris continues, \"We don't fit together....I'm a doctor and you are barely eighteen....I feel that I'm pushing you along too fast.\"   When Alison responds, \"you think I'm holding you back,\" Chris' only answer is \"I'm sorry, Alison.\"  Alison tells him to leave, saying, \"You dumped me just in the nick of time.  One more day and I would have loved you so much this would have killed me.\"  As Chris closes the door and leaves, Alison collapses on the bed sobbing.\n\n\nAaron arrives home at Holden and Lily's to find that Holden is angry at him for forgetting a family dinner.  Aaron's cellular phone rings, and Alison sobs that she has mistakenly dialed his number when she intended to call Chris, who just dumped her.  Aaron rushes out of the house saying, \"I've got to go.  Don't wait up for me.\"  Holden continues to berate Aaron as he goes out the door, and Lily informs Holden that he is doing everything he can to make his son despise him.  Aaron calls Alison back, continuing to talk to her until after he has arrived at her hotel room.  Alison admits that she doesn't want to face her mother, who is angry with her about her hotel room seduction plan, and Aaron confesses that he doesn't want to go home either, to face Holden.  Alison suggests that Aaron spend the night in the hotel room with her.  A cell phone rings, and Alison grabs it and answers, \"Hello, Chris?'  Lucy, on the other end, hangs up, and Alison realizes that she has picked up the wrong phone.  However, the number on the display was blocked, so Alison and Aaron do not realize that the call was from Lucy.  Aaron and Lucy settle down to play video games, and eventually get ready for bed.  Aaron takes off his shirt and they get into bed and turn off the light.  Alison admits to Aaron that she made a mistake trying to manipulate Chris, then the two young people laugh that it wasn't nearly as bad as the way that she stalked Aaron the year before.  Alison tells Aaron that Lucy was so lucky that Aaron loved her as much as he did.  The two look into each other's eyes and kiss, then they make love.\n\n\nHolden, sorry for his outburst at Aaron, watches at the window as time passes and Aaron does not return home.  He tells Lily that he hopes that Aaron has gone to see Lucy and that she has taken him back.  Holden and Lily kiss, then go on to bed.\n\n\nBack at Fairwinds, Rosanna counsels Lucy, telling her that \"you don't stop loving someone overnight.\"  She makes Lucy see that Lucy hates what Aaron did, but she doesn't hate Aaron, feelings that Rosanna herself has confronted often herself in her relationship with Craig.  She advises Lucy to explain to Aaron how she feels.  Next Craig comes in and tells Lucy that if Aaron loved her, he would never let her get away.  Lucy, obviously beginning to forgive Aaron, lovingly puts on his jacket.\n\n\nChris arrives at the police station and tells Margo that she got exactly what she wanted - he broke up with Alison.  Margo responds, \"You broke it off because it's what you wanted to do.\"  Chris admits, \"Staying with her and getting in deeper - it would have been a complete disaster,\" but he looks miserable.\n\n\nThrough the bars of his prison cell, James Stenbeck predicts that Paul will kill either Rose or Dusty, as a little \"treat\" for himself, \"unleashing his vengeance.\"  Paul responds to his father, \"You want to see a good show?  I'll give you a good show - one month from today.  Stay tuned.\"  As Paul turns to leave, James begs for details, but all Paul will say is, \"Trust me.  You'll be amused,\"  as he leaves the still protesting James.  Once out the door and still in view of James, Paul calls Rose on his cell phone.  When Rose asks Paul where he has been, Paul lies that he has just been for a drive.  He asks Rose to meet him at his penthouse, where he has \"big plans, and they're all for you.\"  Rose is waiting when Paul arrives, and he kisses her passionately.  When he asks her how much she loves him, she answers that she loves him more than anything, and \"I'll always love you.\"  Paul responds, \"That's a good answer.\"  When Rose again asks where Paul went, Paul tells her that he has been to a place where he can see everything clearly, and knows how much he loves her.  He again tells her that he wants to marry her: \"I want us to set a date - one month from today.\"  Rose agrees happily, and starts talking about Paris, but Paul tells her that he wants a wedding \"extravaganza\" in Oakdale, with Barbara and Jennifer on the front row, and maybe Dusty as his best man.  Rose stares aghast as Paul tells her that he wants everyone who hates them to choke on every \"I do.\"  Rose treats his suggestion as a joke, but Paul insists that, instead of slinking out of the country like they are ashamed of something, he wants to celebrate in front of the whole world to show how much he loves her.  He urges her to stand up and fight \"like a D'Angelo,\" so Rose agrees.  When Rose asks Paul again where he went, Paul replies that it wasn't where he went, but  he went somewhere where he learned to ask himself the right questions, which \"always began and ended with how much I love you.\"  They kiss and begin to make love.\n\n\nJack answers a disturbance call at Rose's Roller Palace.  He finds the door unlocked, and enters, pulling his gun.  He startles Mitzi, who drops a handful of money.  Mitzi explains that she forgot to make a deposit, and begs Jack not to tell Rose about her absentmindedness.  Agreeing, Jack escorts Mitzi out but has to remind her to set the alarm.  Mitzi again worries about what Rose would think, \"If something happens to this place before Rose gets to sell it, she's going to explode!\"  When Jack asks, \"Why should anything happen to this place,\" Mitzi answers, \"Paul's sister and his mother - they're nuts, and they hate Rose's guts.  If you ask me, I wouldn't put anything past them.\"\n\n\nIn the penthouse, someone seems to be secretly watching Paul and Rose, who have emerged from the bedroom, still aglow with their lovemaking.\n\n\n",
