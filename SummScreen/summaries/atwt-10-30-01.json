    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Lakeview suite, Rose and Mitzi talk about Paul and Mitzi says he is \"husband material.\"  Rose asks Mitzi for help because Barbara is trying to not only ruin Rose's relationship with Paul but also to make sure \"nothing good\" ever happens to her ever.  Rose explains that Barbara dug up information about Rose's past - a rap sheet with prostitution charges.  Apparently, when Rose was young and upset over her mother's death, she propositioned a vice cop and did 30 days time.  Rose tells Mitzi she would do anything to keep Paul to herself and that Barbara threatened to show the rap sheet to Lucinda and Rose's Pop.  Mitzi tells Rose to stay away from Barbara.  Rose tries to decide if she should tell Paul about the rap sheet.  Mitzi doesn't think he'd understand because he's from a privileged background.  Rose explains that Paul has had it rough because of his evil father, James Stenbeck.  Rose and Mitzi wonder how Barbara even got the information.  They realize someone must have helped her.  Mitzi suggests that Jack Snyder could help.  Rose doesn't think Jack would want to because he's Holden's cousin who Rose had to lie to when she impersonated her sister Lily and also because Jack is friends with Barbara Ryan.  Mitzi insists he's \"a stand-up guy.\"  Since Rose doesn't have a better suggestion, she reluctantly agrees to ask Jack for help. \n\n\nJames Stenbeck and Barbara talk on the phone.  James tells Barbara he has more information that will be useful to her. She tells him he can't keep \"popping up.\"  James suggests meeting at the gazebo.  As Paul walks into the room, Barbara quickly hangs up the phone.  Paul tells his mother that Rose broke up with him.  She feigns concern and says she wishes she had been awake last night to comfort him.  Paul tells his mother that she knew Rose would break up with him and that's why she went to bed early.  Then Paul adds, \"And I bet you slept like a baby.\"  Barbara insists Rose must have had a reason.  Paul tells Barbara that Rose acted different.  He explains how they booked a room at the Lakeview and he tells the story about security calling him about a broken windshield.  After leaving to take care of it, Rose completely changed and broke up with him -- almost like she was being forced -- as if, someone got to her.  Barbara says she wouldn't make another deal with Rose.  She says maybe Rose is toying with him or showing a side he doesn't know about yet.  Barbara tells Paul that he likes complicated women like Rose and Emily Stewart and that Rose has a dark side.  Paul says Rose is a \"breath of fresh air.\"  Barbara says that Rose made threats to her the last time they tried to make a deal, even suggesting she'd break her legs.  Barbara tries to convince Paul that she is not involved in the breakup.  After their discussion about Rose is over, Barbara talks about the upcoming show and her new designs.  She is especially excited to see the suit she designed which was inspired from the suite she wore at her wedding to Craig.  She wants to see it on the runway because she will feel vindicated and it will be turning \"disaster into art.\"  Paul is worried and suggests to his mother that going to the show in NY would be a bad idea - interviews, photographers. (Carly's fashions on the runway, not hers.)  He quickly leaves and Barbara yells, \"Paul, I think you're doing a wonderful job!\"  Barbara calls James and tells him Paul is hiding something else from her.  James says he will go right to the gazebo to meet her.  \n\n\nJack goes to Margo's house and she tells him she is having a difficult time accepting Bryant's death.  She says, \"He was so young and in love and now he's gone.\"  She feels she doesn't have the right words to use with her kids and with her brother Craig.  Jack tells Margo that Craig has Carly.  Margo is surprised to hear Jack say this.  Jack isn't happy about it but says if Carly can help, he won't stand in the way.  Jack then tells Margo that James Stenbeck is back in Oakdale and that he briefly saw him at the wedding.  Margo tells Jack to follow up and to come back to the police force.  Jack feels it is too soon.  At that moment, Simon comes over interrupting their conversation.  Jack leaves and goes over to meet with Rose and Mitzi.  At first Rose pretends she is talking about a \"friend\" but then she admits the whole thing, the criminal record in NJ and how Barbara is using it for blackmail to keep Rose away from Paul and to gain control of Paul.  After hearing the story, Jack says one word, \"Stenbeck\" and then agrees to help.  At the gazebo, James waits for Barbara while Jack walks right over to him and says, \"Waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nSimon is concerned about Katie and asks Margo if she has heard from her.  Margo hasn't but agrees to help Simon find her.  Simon tells Margo that they have to find Katie before Bruno does.  Margo is upset and tells Simon about Bryant's death.  Simon is sad about the news and tells Margo he is sorry about Bryant.  He says he won't forgive himself if something happens to Katie.  The last he saw her was when she hitched a ride to LA but then he lost her.  Margo asks Simon if he wants Katie back.  He tells her he's been thinking and the answer is yes - he wants Katie back.  At his moment the exterminator that Margo had called shows up because Margo says there is something in her attic.  After a few minutes a noise is heard and the exterminator says he found the problem. Coming down the stairs, he is holding a white bunny rabbit and Katie is running down the stairs after him.  \"Hi I'm back\", she says.  Katie hid in the attic because she needed time to think and didn't feel safe anywhere else.  She heard about Bryant and is upset feeling as if she were a horrible aunt to him.  Simon says he missed her and loves her.  Katie says she is scared of Bruno and doesn't want him to get angry.  Margo leaves to check on information about Bruno.  Katie and Simon proclaim their love and kiss.  Just then, the doorbell rings and it is Bruno.  He tells Katie that if she doesn't do what he wants, then she will regret it.\n\n\nCarly goes over to the cottage and finds Craig sleeping on the couch.  Craig says he doesn't want to go to the funeral.  \"My son needed me - for what?\"  Carly tells him he may never know but whatever it is, it's over.  Craig feels he was the last person his son could turn to and he let him down.  Craig tells Carly that Billy is hiding something and that the answer is in the house, somewhere.  Jennifer walks in and tells Craig, \"I think I have what you are looking for.\"  She tells him that Bryant found out that she was seeing another guy.  Jennifer says she is responsible for Bryant's death.  Carly says it's not her fault.  Craig wonders why Billy didn't mention any of this and finally asks Jennifer if Billy is the other guy.  Jennifer confirms it for him.  Craig says, \"You betrayed my son with his cousin.\"  Carly tries to smooth things but Craig wants more details.  He asks her how Bryant found out.  Jennifer says he saw them together.  Craig is mad that a picture of the two of them together, going behind Bryant's back, was the last thing he saw.  Jennifer tells Craig that he cared more about money than about his own son and that Bryant knew it too.  She then tells him about the letter Bryant wrote before he died.  Craig wants to see the letter but Jennifer will not let him see it.  Carly breaks up their fighting words.  Carly tells both of them not to blame someone else and that Bryant caused his own death by not wearing a seatbelt.  Jennifer says that maybe neither of them loved Bryant enough and that if they had loved him, he would be alive today. Jennifer leaves and Carly tells Craig to turn to her.  She tries to convince Craig to get cleaned up and go to the memorial service. Craig agrees but asks for a minute alone in the cottage.  He spots on the floor a picture of him and Bryant as a boy.  Craig says, \"You needed me, I was there for you.  Now I can take care of things.\"\n\n\n",
