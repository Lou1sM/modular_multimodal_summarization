Paul tried to tell Jennifer that he was the reason she lost her baby, but Emily walked in just as he was trying to explain it and interrupted him, telling Jennifer that she'd given Paul a strong sleeping pill before she left and that he must be having a bad reaction to it. Jennifer said that explained the strange things Paul had been saying, like the fact that he'd seen Craig in the mirror and had said that he was worse than Craig. Emily got Paul alone and insisted that they needed to keep the baby's existence a secret from Jennifer. Jennifer left, and Emily emphasized to Paul that if he told Jennifer the truth now, he would lose Jenn, he'd lose Emily because they'd both go to jail, and she'd lose Daniel. Paul relented, and they made love on the couch.\n\n\nJennifer ran into Will at Java, and he sat down to chat for a few minutes and filled her in on his new relationship with Gwen. He showed Jenn a picture of the baby, which Jennifer looked at affectionately. Will apologized for talking about the baby when Jennifer was going through such a bad time in her life, but Jennifer told him she wanted him to be happy and to feel like he could share his new relationship with Gwen and the baby with her whenever he wanted to.\n\n\nAt BJ's party, BJ had Katie locked in his bedroom and tried to get her to kiss him. When she refused, he told her he loved her and always had. Katie tried to leave, but BJ pulled her back, and she fell to the floor; BJ got down on top of her, and Katie cried out that she couldn't breathe, so BJ moved away and tried to help her up. Downstairs, Maddie told Mike that BJ is actually Byron Glass, from Katie's high school days, and said she thought that Katie was in trouble up in BJ's bedroom. Henry gave Mike a key to the bedroom, and Mike opened the door to find BJ grabbing after Katie. He pulled Katie out of the way and punched BJ in the face, then stormed out with Katie. When Henry and Maddie saw the shape Katie was in when she left with Mike (different clothes than she'd been wearing when she arrived at the party, distraught expression), they realized something awful had happened with BJ. BJ tried to explain to Henry and Maddie that he was only trying to reconnect with Katie, and he asked Henry and Maddie not to quit their jobs. Henry agreed that they would both continue working for BJ. BJ told Henry that \"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" meaning he intended to continue to pursue Katie. BJ went to his room and smashed the disco ball hanging from the ceiling.\n\n\nMike comforted Katie back at the cottage and told her that she wasn't to blame for this and that they'd go to the police tomorrow to file charges against BJ/Byron.\n\n\nGwen and Will were kissing on the porch when Iris came out and demanded that Will leave because he was a murderer and a psycho. Gwen told Iris that Will had been released from the mental hospital because the doctors considered him to be well again and that he was welcome at the house whenever he wanted. Gwen and Will expressed their feelings for one another and their commitment to be there for each other. Will left, and Gwen reiterated to Iris that she wanted Will in her life. Iris tried to warn her about bad men by making a reference to Ray Tenney, which caused Gwen to ask questions about her real father. Iris wouldn't say much except that he was bad news and that she'd wanted Gwen away from him so much that she'd staged the whole \"what have you done to my beautiful boy\" thing with Carly just to make that happen. Iris left soon afterward, saying she'd be back in a couple of hours.\n\n\nJack and Carly talked about Halloween and what the kids had gone as (the boys went as cops, Sage as a carrot); Carly had meant for Rory to go as a pea pod so that Sage and Rory would be peas and carrots. Carly found a toy of Rory's that she said he depended on to go to sleep without fussing, and she wondered whether she should go return it. Carly expressed her concern that she'd be convicted of assaulting Gwen and that with Jack being suspended from his job, they might lose custody of their kids. Jack tried to reassure Carly that this wouldn't happen. Later, Jack asked an old FBI buddy for a job, after explaining why he'd been suspended from the Oakdale Police Department. The FBI buddy told him they did have someone they'd been watching who just moved to Oakdale.\n\n\nCarly brought the baby's toy to Iris's house and gave it to Gwen, and Gwen asked her to come inside. She asked Carly about their dad,  and Carly said Ray had been stubborn, would get real mean when you pushed him, and would try to make things seem like your fault if you tried to defend yourself. Gwen said that sounded familiar, and although Carly assumed she was talking about her, Gwen said she was talking about herself. The two of them seemed to \"bond\" somewhat over that observation. Gwen left the room and Carly got a call on her cell phone from Jessica, who told her that her trial was going to be soon. Carly told Gwen what the call was about, and Gwen became suspicious that Carly had only come over to try to get her to drop the charges against her. Carly said Gwen needed to do whatever she wanted to do about that, and she started to leave. Gwen called out as she was leaving that next time, Carly should call before she came over (which at least implied that there will be a next time for Carly to visit the baby and Gwen). Carly said she would do that, and she thanked Gwen.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "BJ/Byron's bizarre obsession with Katie and their supposed connection really upsets her, especially when he won't let her out of the room. Mike has escaped from the basement and comes looking for Henry to find out where Katie is? Henry stalls not wanting to give up his meal ticket. Maddie tells Mike where she is and fills Mike in on whom BJ really is \u0096 Byron Glass. Mike rescues Katie from BJ/Byron, as things are on the verge of getting physical. Mike punches him out. Later, BJ/Byron apologizes to Henry and Maddie and begs them to stay with him, which Henry agrees to, against Maddie's wishes. BJ/Byron loses his cool and shatters the disco ball with a bat, which Maddie secretly witnesses. Jack has a meeting with a friend from the Bureau about a job. After Jack explains the circumstances with the Oakdale Police Department, the friend tells him they happen to need someone local for a job. Someone they are looking at just moved to Oakdale. Iris wants to keep Gwen away from Will, because he is standing in the way of her meal ticket \u0096 the baby. Iris tells Gwen certain aspects about her and Carly's father, which work to her advantage. Later, when Carly shows up with a toy the baby needs, they bond slightly over the fact they share a father. Paul hallucinates seeing Craig and almost tells Jen about the baby switch, but Emily stops him. Later Paul comes to his senses, but Emily continues to wonder if she can keep this act up?",
