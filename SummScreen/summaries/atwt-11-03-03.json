Mitzi asks Jack for a favor - she wants Jack, since he is Holden's cousin, to talk Lily into letting Mitzi manage the beauty salon if Rose leaves for Paris.  When Jack reluctantly agrees, Mitzi jumps up and covers Jack's face with lipstick kisses.  Naturally, Carly picks that moment to come in the door.  Mitzi tries to talk her way out of it, prattling as fast as she can, but Carly, smiling sweetly, asks Mitzi to tell her \"all the details.\"  Mitzi chatters on about what good friends she and Jack are, but after she leaves, Carly still is suspicious of how the two came to be such good friends.\n\n\nIn the police station interview room, Jessica promises Bonnie that she will have her released that very morning.  When Bonnie insists that she caused Marshall's death by pushing him out the window, Jessica responds that many people would think that Bonnie was justified.  Bonnie looks directly at Jessica and asks, \"What people?  You?  Ben?\"  When Jessica assures Bonnie that she and Ben are 100% behind her, Bonnie replies that the only opinion she cares about is Sarah's.  When Tom enters the room, Bonnie asks to see Sarah, but Tom tells her, \"You won't be seeing Sarah for a long, long time.\"  Tom goes on to explain that Bonnie can't see Sarah because Sarah is a material witness.  Jessica and Tom go outside the room, where Tom tells Jessica that Bonnie might be facing prison time.  When Jessica goes back into the room, Bonnie begs her to go see Sarah to see if Sarah understands that Bonnie was trying to protect her.  Jessica agrees to go see Sarah, after making Bonnie promise not to talk to Tom or anyone else, especially after Bonnie admits to her that she \"wanted Marshall dead.\"  Jessica assures Bonnie that she is not to blame for any of this, and that Jessica will make sure that everything will work out.  After Jessica leaves, Bonnie murmurs, \"No, you won't.\"  Jessica goes to Al's Diner, where Troy has brought Sarah to meet with her.  Sarah lashes out at Jessica, saying that Jessica never cared for her.  Sarah accuses, \"You're the reason he is dead, and we both know it.\"  She tells Jessica that she knows that Jessica was making Marshall leave town, and cries, \"I hate you, and I'll hate you forever.\"  Jessica breaks down in tears.  Back at the jail, as soon as Jessica leaves, Bonnie comes out of the room to find Tom.  She tells Tom that, because she cannot let Sarah go through the trauma of testifying, she will plead guilty to whatever charges he is thinking of bringing against her.\n\n\nIn their kitchen, Emily tells Hal that Will admitted lying about spraying the paint on Paul's walls, after she and Rose forced him to admit that he did not know about the safety strip on the can of spray paint.  When Hal assumes that Barbara actually sprayed Paul's walls, Emily tells him that when she asked Will if Barbara did it, Will rushed out of Al's diner.   Just then, Will rushes in and insists that he was the one who spray-painted Paul's apartment.  Hall tells him tiredly, \"I know what your mother has done, and I am not going to let you take the blame.\"  Will accuses everyone of trying to make his mom look bad.  Hal sends Emily from the room and has a straightforward talk with Will.  He tells Will that lying to protect Barbara will only hurt her in the long run.  Hal hugs Will and tells him that he loves him, and begs him to tell the truth.  Will finally says, \"The truth is....Mom just wants Paul to stay, and so do I.\"  When Will pauses, Hal finishes for him, \"So....your mother spray-painted Paul's place and asked you to take the blame?\"  Will asks, \"Why is that so bad?...We just wanted Paul to care.\"  Hal thanks Will for telling the truth and leaves purposefully for the hospital.  Will immediately tries to call Barbara to warn her that Hal knows what they did, but Emily stops him.  Will spits, \"I hate you!\"  Answering, \"It's okay to be angry,\" Emily explains that Barbara is a grownup and that grownups know that they have to take the consequences for their actions.\n\n\nAt Oakdale Memorial Hospital, Barbara is talking to Dr. Lynn Michaels, Will's psychiatrist, about Will's supposed vandalism of Paul's apartment.  Barbara is suggesting that Dr. Michaels convince Paul to make a commitment to stay in town for Will's well-being when Paul walks up.  Barbara immediately grabs Paul, telling him that it is important for the family to pull together in this time of crisis.  She stops suddenly when Rose enters the room after Paul.  Barbara, with a poisonous smile, tells the couple that Rose's presence is irresponsible, since Rose's relationship with Will is \"casual, at best.\"  Rose responds crisply, \"You blew it, Barbara, big time!\"  Rose informs Barbara that Will did not know about the safety strip on the can of spray paint, proving that Will did not spray paint Paul's apartment.  In front of both Paul and Dr. Michaels, Rose accuses Barbara of the vandalism and of having Will take the blame.  Paul pulls Barbara aside and angrily asks her, \"What have you done with Will?\"  Barbara grabs her mobile phone to call Will, but stops and begins screaming at Rose, blaming her for everything.  Hal enters the hospital and tells everyone that Will admitted to him that Barbara spray-painted the apartment.  Barbara, cornered, demands, \"What did you do to get him to say that?\"  Hal responds that the told Will, \"When you love somebody, you don't lie, or you don't get somebody to lie for you.\"  Barbara frantically paws at Paul's sleeve, crying, \"I did this for you.  I did this for Will.  I did this because you brothers should not be separated.\"  Paul leaves to find Will, but he will not let Rose accompany him.  He leaves, telling her, \"I don't know why you bent over backwards to hurt Will...and me.\"  Rose gasps in surprise, but Paul goes on to tell Rose that  sees that she waited to confront Barbara in the most embarrassing way possible, rather than thinking of a way to help Will.  \"You traded in any chance of helping Will for a chance to stick it to my mother.\"  The elevator door closes behind him.  Dr. Michaels takes Hal aside for a talk, but Hal demands that Barbara wait right there until he comes back.  Barbara grabs Rose, saying, \"You destroy everything in my life that is good and decent, and I'm sick to death of it....You'd better be afraid because you have crossed me for the last time.\"  Hal returns and Barbara continues ranting that Rose has done all the damage, that Barbara was just trying to help her sons, etc., etc.  Hal responds, \"Will is not fine....you are destroying him - lie by lie, bit by bit.  And I'm not going to stand by and let you do it any longer.  I will make absolutely sure that you never mess with our son's mind again!\"\n\n\nPaul arrives at the Munson home and asks to see Will alone, so Emily leaves him there with Will.  When Paul tells Will that he understands why Will lied, Will asks him, \"Why is it okay that I lied but it's not okay for Mom to do the same thing?\"  Poor confused Will wonders why nobody cares how Barbara is doing.  \n\n\nEmily arrives at the penthouse just as the cleaning crew finishes their work.  Emily comes in to comfort her, saying, \"To hell with Barbara and to hell with Paul, too.\"\n\n\n",
