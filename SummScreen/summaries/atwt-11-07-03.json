Holden tries to understand why Aaron won't take the job.  Aaron is looking for a quick jump up the status ladder.  Aaron leaves to run an errand, and Holden takes off for the christening.\n\n\nRosanna calls Katie and tells her Cabot's christening is this afternoon.  Katie asks Mike if he wants to join her.\n\n\nBarbara meets a hit man.  James Stenbeck sent him to help Babs.  She tells the man she needs assistance with \"someone who's been causing my family a great deal of pain.  I want you to kill her.\"  She holds a package with half his fee, and shows him a picture of Rose with a list of places she frequents.  He makes her think twice before accepting the money.  Once he takes the cash, he says there is no going back.  She hands him the package and says, \"This is not my fault!  You have to understand, this is not my fault!\"  The hired gun doesn't care about her inner demons.  He just takes the package and walks away.\n\n\nPaul is lying on Dusty's bed when Dusty and Rose walk into Dusty's apt to talk about how to handle Molly and her comments.  Paul diffuses the situation and asks Dusty if they could all bury the hatchet and be friends again.  Dusty is skeptical and tells Paul to get out.  Paul wants to know why the thought of the three of them being friends scares him so much.  Dusty asks for one good reason why he should believe Paul.  Paul asks Dusty to be a second best man, and stand up for him at the wedding (Will is going to be the first best man).  Aaron stops by to ask for his old job back.  Dusty tells Aaron that his father turned him in.  Aaron tears up and then runs off.  Dusty returns his attention to Paul and Rose and demands to know Paul's real plan.  Paul gives a speech about how much he trusts both of them, and then he leaves the room.  A couple of moments later, Rose says her own good-byes.  As she walks out of his room, Barbar's hit man starts to follow.\n\n\nRosanna reflects on all the changes that have happened in her life since she rejoined the Oakdale population.  Craig runs to the car to get the digital camera, but runs into Ms. Fettle on the way back.  She demands, \"You better help me duck the long arm of the law or you can say good-bye to your precious son.\"  She wants cash, a disguise, and a ride to the airport, and she wants it right away.  Craig tells Rosanna he can't find a battery pack for the digi-cam, so he'll have to run home.  Rosanna is flustered as she watches him walk out the front door.\n\n\nMitzi is stealing more cash from the register when Craig knocks on the door.  He barges in throwing a bundle of cash in Mitzi's hand asking for a wig, a scarf, and a pair of sunglasses...for Rosanna.\n\n\nHolden talks with Lily at the church about Aaron.  She advises him to back off before he loses his son.  Lucy arrives and asks how Aaron's interview went.  Holden squirms.  Inside, Rosanna is peeved Craig isn't back yet.  Later, Mike and Katie arrive.  \n\n\nIn Craig's car, he asks Ms. Fettle if she abducted the baby.  She doesn't deny anything.  After Craig pays Ms. Fettle $20,000, she gives him a packet of info on the baby's 17-year-old mother, Jane Courier.  She says the mother lives in Ottawa and won't ever come around looking for the baby.  Ms. Fettle gets out of the car and Craig returns to the church.\n\n\nBabs is enjoying a drink in the lounge when Rose's spirit walks in dressed in black.  Rose's spirit congratulates Barbar on getting her son back, and then she takes off a hat revealing a bullet hole in her forehead.  Rose smiles, then says, \"See ya in hell,\" before she keels over.  Babs rushes to her aide screaming Rose's name.  Barbara finally snaps back to reality when a waiter asks her if she wants another drink.  She is still a little foggy, but she declines the drink and rushes out of the lounge to find Rose.  She's having second thoughts about killing her.\n\n\nAaron storms into the church and yells at Holden in front of everyone.  Holden pushes Aaron off to the side so they could have a little more privacy, but it doesn't cool Aaron's anger.  Holden tells his son he should be thankful he got a gentle wake up call.  Aaron rages that he is moving out tonight.  Lucy comes to his side and asks where he's going to live.  Aaron says he'd sooner live on the street than spend another minute with his father.  \n\n\nThe ceremony resumes, and Craig returns just in time.  Rosanna leers at her husband and says, \"You better have a darn good reason for being late to your own son's christening or I'm going to book the minister for a funeral\u2014yours!\"\n\n\n",
