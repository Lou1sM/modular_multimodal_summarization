Of course, he can't tell her that he had to help the adoption lady get out of town, so he only tells Rosanna, \"I would do anything to keep him,\"  as he slides a piece of paper under a hymnal  Although his answer seems a little odd to Rosanna, she forgives him.  As they prepare to leave the chapel, Craig tells Rosanna that he wants to stay and say a quick prayer.  With the paper in his hand, Craig prays, \"Lord, I haven't asked for anything in a long time....Please, can you help me keep this a secret?  Amen.\"  Craig joins Rosanna in the car, where she and Cabot wait in the back seat.  He covers the wig and scarf under his coat in the passenger seat.  Rosanna, in the process of changing Cabot's diaper, uncovers the wig and scarf.  She angrily begins hitting Craig with the wig, demanding to know what woman he was with.  Craig frantically makes up a story that the wig  and scarf belong to Carly, who left them in the car when he gave her a ride after she called and told him she had car trouble.  Rosanna tells Craig coolly that she would like to drive the car home.  He opens the door for her, she gets into the driver's seat, locks the doors, and drives off.  During this time, Jack and Carly have discussed Craig's delay at the christening, and Carly is suspicious that Craig is plotting something that has to do with the baby.  After Rosanna drives off, Craig walks to Carly's house and asks Carly to cover for him.  Immediately, Rosanna appears at the door, having dropped Cabot off at Fairwinds with the nurse, and Craig tiptoes into the next room.  Rosanna anxiously asks Carly if the scarf and wig belong to her.\n\n\nAt the hotel bar, Paul tells Molly that she was overly suspicious of Rose and Dusty, and that their relationship is perfectly innocent.  After Molly leaves, Paul has an odd look on his face.  Molly goes up to Dusty's room, finding it topsy-turvy from his search for a bug.  Molly leaves to go to The Metro, telling Dusty that Paul is toying with him, and that Dusty is playing into Paul's hands with his suspicions of Paul.  Dusty admits to Molly that he is afraid that, once Paul marries Rose, he will stop pretending to be nice to her and show his true colors.  Dusty tells Molly that he wants to protect Rose since he still cares for her.  Molly answers, \"I hope to God that you are not the one who is destroyed instead.\"\n\n\nOutside Al's Diner, Lily runs into Hal.  They agree to have a cup of coffee to discuss their fear for Rose's safety, since Rose publicly humiliated Barbara.  Both feel that Barbara might do something drastic again, and Hal asks Lily to try to persuade Rose to back off from baiting Barbara.  As Hal and Lily talk at the diner, Barbara pounds on the door of Rose's Roller Palace, screaming, \"Rose! Are you in there?\"  She recalls hiring the hit man to kill Rose, calling, \"I have to talk to you before it's too late!\"  However, Rose is entering the front door of her house in Luther's Corners.  As Rose puts the chain on the door, someone watches through her front window.  A hand knocks on the door, and a nice-looking strange man is at the door, who is actually the hit man without his sunglasses.  The hit man asks to use her phone to call a tow truck for his disabled car.  Rose lets him in, and he pretends to call for help.  When Rose turns her back, he pulls a wire out of his brief case and is about to garrote her, but Mitzi rushes in and asks Rose to help her with her hair.  As the hit man pretends to give directions to the garage, he pulls a gun out of his brief case.\n\n\nLily enters the hotel bar, having called Paul.  When she tells Paul that she is frightened for Rose's safety, Paul replies, \"I have a plan to keep Barbara at bay.  When Paul tells Lily that Rose has gone home alone, she again tells Paul that she is afraid for rose.  Paul tells her, \"Believe me, I've got Rose covered.\"\n\n\nAs the hit man points the gun at the back of Rose's head, there is a knock on the door.  Barbara bursts in, sees the hit man, and offers to give him a ride home.  The hit man declines and walks out the door.  After a few unpleasant words, Barbara leaves, telling Rose, \"You're playing with fire, and you don't know how close to the flame you really are.\"  Lily enters, bring Rose a cheeseburger from Al's Diner, and warns Rose about Barbara, reminding her how unstable Barbara is.  Rose assures Lily that Paul will never let anything happen to her.  Outside the house, the hit man tells Barbara, \"That was a stupid thing you did in there.\"  Barbara tells him that she has changed her mind, but he responds, \"Money has changed hands.  Somebody is going to die.\"  When Barbara tells him that he can keep the $20,000 down payment, he says, \"It's your money.  You won't be seeing me again.   The girl gets a break.\"  After he leaves, Barbara mutters to herself, \"I have other plans for her.\"\n\n\nLily leaves Rose' house and a frightened Rose carefully locks her door.  Her phone rings, and a mechanical voice says, \"Careful, Rosie.  Somebody's got it in for you.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rosanna was very upset with Craig for being late to Cabot's christening. He manages to convince her he was truly sorry and then says a prayer asking for help keeping his secret. As Rosanna and Craig are about to go home she decided to change Cabot. She finds a wig and scarf and immediately asks Craig who it belongs to. Craig lies saying it might be Carly's. Rosanna leaves Craig at the church and goes to Carly's. Before Rosanna can get there Craig shows up asking for Carly's help. Craig is listening to Rosanna ask Carly if the wig and scarf are hers. Just as Rose gets home there is a knock on the door. The hitman Barbara hired is asking to use the phone because he has a flat tire. As Rose turns her back he pulls out a cord to choke her. Mizi comes into the room as he puts away the cord and pulls out a gun. He points the gun at Rose just as Barbara starts yelling and banging on the door. The hitman leaves and Rose demands to know why Babs is there. Later Babs meets the hitman to tell him she changed her mind. He says that is impossible because the money has changed hands and someone will die. He finally changes his mind after telling Barbara he could kill her. She tells him that James knows him and wouldn't like that. He walks away. Rose answers the phone and hears a voice on the other end tell her someone has it in for her.",
