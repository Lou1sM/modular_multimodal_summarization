They then received an unexpected visit from Ms. George from the Department of Child and Family Services, checking to see how Gwen and the baby were doing. Iris arrived while Ms. George was checking the baby's room, and Will went outside to stall her, telling her the strange car in the driveway belonged to a guidance counselor from Gwen's school. Will gave Iris some cash and told her it was from the baby's trust fund and that she should use it to go shopping, then he went back inside. After talking with Gwen and checking out the baby's room, Ms. George told Gwen she thought her chances of getting full custody were very good. As she was leaving, Iris came in and found out who she really was. She tried to make it look as though Gwen was still struggling to care for the baby properly, but Will pulled a flask of whiskey out of Iris's purse and asked her if this was her \"proof.\" Iris tried to say that Will must have planted it, but Gwen asked if he could have planted the smell of whiskey on her breath, too. The case worker left, saying she had seen enough.\n\n\nWill and Gwen left to go see the apartment, and Iris's new friend Stan came in, saying he'd waited until she was alone. Iris told him that he could help her out and make some money if he'd do a little research for her; she wanted him to find out exactly how Will had killed Rose D'Angelo.\n\n\nIn the wine cellar at Fairwinds, Henry realized that BJ must have drugged his martini. BJ arrived, and Henry tried to get him to let him go by telling him that he suddenly had amnesia and couldn't remember anything that had happened that day, or that he and BJ could have a \"do over\" on the whole day, but BJ was not amused. BJ told Henry he would decide what the payment would be for Henry's earlier threats to go to the police, and he left. Henry began to call for help and was happy when a woman came walking down the stairs into the cellar, but when she kicked him down and stood over him, he realized that he was at her mercy.\n\n\nMaddie ran into Casey and told him she was worried because Henry was supposed to be meeting her and hadn't shown up. Casey offered to go back to WOAK with Maddie to look for Henry. When they got there, Maddie called Henry's cell phone again, and it rang from inside BJ's office. They went in and found the cell phone under BJ's desk, and they then began looking for \"clues\" as to where Henry might have gone. Casey looked in a filing cabinet and found one shoe, which Maddie said belonged to Henry. When Maddie realized BJ was coming back into his office, she and Casey began kissing, so that it would look as though he had simply caught them making out in his office.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Lucinda visited Luke and told him that he had given her a reason to fight for her own life, and she wanted him to agree to fight for his life now; he said he would, on the condition that she continue to fight for hers. Keith came to see Lily, and Holden tried to get him to leave. Lily told Keith that she needed to talk to Holden alone. Holden told Lily that he understood that she might still have feelings for Keith but that he thought that he and Lily were now closer than they'd been in a long time, and that he saw Luke's recovery as a second chance to get his family back together. Keith called Lily and asked if she'd told him yet about their marriage plans, but Lily said she couldn't break his heart right now and that Keith needed to give her more time. He said he would, but that he wouldn't let her back out now.\n\n\nHolden told Lucinda about Keith hanging around the hospital, and Lucinda told Holden that they would just have to fight fire with fire. Lucinda ran into Lily in the hallway and told her she had promised Luke she would fight for her family, and that's what she intended to do. After Lucinda left, Lily went in to visit Luke with Holden, Faith, and Natalie. Lily saw Keith outside Luke's door and went out into the hall; he gave her an engagement ring, and she gave it back to him, telling him, \"You have to release me from this promise.\"\n\n\n",
