Later, Carly invites Gwen, Will and Billy to lunch. Gwen is unmoved at first thinking Carly just wants to guilt her into not testifying, but later Carly and Gwen seem to get closer as they talk about the baby and some concerns Gwen has. Iris steals Will's credit card and uses it to buy the same poison he purchased when he poisoned Rose's mouthwash. Will inadvertently signs for the package, which pleases Iris to no end. Katie arrives home early from her press trip hoping for some romance with Mike, but they are interrupted when Maddie wants their help. She is fearful that BJ has done something bad to Henry. Mike is not convinced, but Katie is more concerned. They end up calling Jack who lets them know that he approached Henry to do undercover work for the FBI, who are interested in Byron/BJ, but he turned him down. Katie offers herself as bait to catch BJ, but Mike won't let her do it. A mysterious person armed with a gun watches as Mike, Katie and Jack talk. BJ continues keeping Henry under lock and key in his wine cellar. He even gleefully shows Henry a toy he created which is a hologram of Katie, that leaves them both drooling when the illusion tells them what they want to hear. Henry wants him to promise that he won't harm a hair on Mike's head. BJ promises that, but there is something cold and calculating in his voice.",
