Emily told Paul she didn't want to come second to everyone else in his life, and just then, Barbara pounded on the door, yelling that she had to talk to Paul urgently about Will. Paul was torn, but he let Barbara in, and she told Paul she was worried about Will's threats against Iris. She told him that Will was planning to live with Gwen in an apartment in Oakdale, and Paul told Barbara he thought that was great, that he thought Gwen was good for Will, and that he had promised Will he'd never again question his stability. Paul told Barbara that he, Jennifer, and Will were tired of Barbara trying to decide what was best for them and control their lives. Barbara left, upset that Paul wasn't as concerned about Will as she was. Afterward, Paul told Emily again how much she meant to him, saying she had been his first love and that he hoped she would give him another chance now. He asked her again to marry him, and this time, she said \"yes.\"\n\n\nAt Iris's house, Iris stumbled in complaining of bad stomach pains. Will and Gwen called an ambulance, and Iris was taken to the hospital, where she had her stomach pumped. Bob Hughes told Gwen and Will that they were running toxicology tests to find out what had happened but that he thought Iris would be fine. When they went in to see her, though, Iris began saying she thought she might be dying. Cass Winthrop came in, and Iris said she'd called him to ask him to help her make her will; she told Cass she wanted Gwen to get everything she had, even though it wasn't much. Iris then asked Will to go to her house to get her insurance paperwork; as Will was leaving, he warned Gwen to be careful, because he thought a lot of what Iris was doing now was for show. Gwen was a bit upset by that accusation, saying she thought they needed to give her mom the benefit of the doubt right now.  Bob asked Gwen to go to Java with him to grab a quick bite to eat. While at Java, Bob told Gwen the preliminary tests indicated that Iris might have been poisoned intentionally. Barbara, who had just walked into Java, overheard this statement and looked alarmed.\n\n\nAt Iris's house again, Will ran into her friend Stan and told him that Iris was in the hospital. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Cass asked Iris if she was worried that she was in some kind of danger, and she told him that she was; just as Will returned with Iris's paperwork, Iris told Cass that she was afraid someone might be trying to hurt her.\n\n\nHenry yelled and broke wine bottles in the wine cellar at Fairwinds, frustrated that he couldn't get out. BJ came and teased Henry about Mike being \" a dead issue\" but warned Henry that he ought to be worried about Maddie instead, because she'd been snooping around too much. Henry got angry with BJ and told him he'd better leave Maddie alone, and BJ told Henry that he was going to try one more thing to make Maddie stop being suspicious about where Henry was, but that if it didn't work, he might have to get rid of Henry and Maddie both, for good. BJ left.\n\n\nMaddie made phone calls to Palo Alto to try to find Henry but couldn't locate him. Casey brought her a package that was postmarked from Palo Alto and told her it was from Henry, but Maddie was pretty sure it wasn't, because the gift (an I-Pod type of thing) Henry had sent was in a color he knew she hated and had a smiley face on it, which he knew she didn't like. But when BJ walked up and asked if she'd heard from Henry, Maddie told him that she'd just gotten a neat gift from him and realized he really must be in Palo Alto after all. BJ left, and Casey told Maddie that he thought things were indeed a little strange and that he would help her investigate Henry's whereabouts some more if she wanted him to; they decided to go over what little information they had, and Maddie began by recollecting the phone call from Henry in which he'd told her not to \"whine, whine, whine.\" Suddenly, she said, \"That's it!\"\n\n\nBJ's guard, Olga, came down into the wine cellar when Henry started breaking bottles again. Henry tried to talk Olga into helping him get out or warning Maddie that she might be in danger, but BJ returned just as Henry was making progress with Olga. BJ dismissed Olga from the room after telling her to remember who signed her paychecks, and then he told Henry that Maddie was satisfied for now that Henry was okay.\n\n\n",

Maddie figures out the clue Henry gave her during their last phone conversation. Paul finally realizes that he loves Emily and he proposes to her. Emily accepts Paul's marriage proposal. Iris plan to separate Will from Gwen works perfectly.",
