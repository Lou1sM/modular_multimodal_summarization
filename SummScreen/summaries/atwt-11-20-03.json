The phone rang and Susan informed Alison that she should have been to work an hour ago. Alison made up an excuse that she overslept. Lucy appeared at the door and said she had something important to say to Alison. Lucy asked Alison who made the first move when her and Aaron made love.  Alison told Lucy that it was none of her business. After a brief argument, Lucy pushed Alison who fell. Alison hurt her knee and her mother arrived in time to take her to the hospital for x-rays. At the hospital, Bob and Susan wanted Alison to have her knee x-rayed. When she and Katie objected, Susan realized that Alison was pregnant!\n\n\nMike and Katie arrived at Al's Diner where Margo was waiting for them.  Katie asked where Tom was and when Margo said she would call Tom she realized that she left her cell phone on her desk.  Katie said she would call Tom and left.  Mike asked Margo to convince Katie to have a memorial for Simon. Margo thought that Katie needed to deal with Simon's death under her own terms and that they shouldn't push Katie into doing something she isn't ready for.  Meanwhile, outside Katie was asking Tom if there was some legal action she needed to take to officially end her marriage. Tom said she was free.  Tom told Margo what Katie had asked him and, after hearing that, Margo agreed to talk to Katie about the memorial service.\n\n\nHal noticed that Will kept looking at his watch during breakfast and later found the note from Barbara. Hal went to the park and confronted Barbara. They started arguing about Rose and Barbara said that Rose was nothing but a gold-digger and was after Paul's money.  Hal then accused her of vandalizing Rose's car and making the threatening phone call. Hal told Barbara that he had lost his patience with her and that there were no more chances. Next time, he would lock her up for good.\n\n\nJack was questioning Dusty about the vandalism and Dusty informed Jack that Molly found the voice device in Paul's pocket.  After Molly and Dusty told him the whole story, Jack called Paul. After Jack left, Holden and Aaron came in and asked Dusty for Aaron's job back.  Holden supported Aaron and Dusty said okay.  Holden then shook hands with Dusty. \n\n\nRose woke up and discovered Paul was gone.  She kept thinking about what Dusty had said about the voice device and saw Paul's bag.  Paul walked in as she was opening the bag.  Rose told him about the voice device but Paul brushed it off as Dusty being paranoid.  Paul opened the bag and presented Rose with a beautiful photo album he said he got in Paris.  Rose thanked Paul with a lot of kisses. Just as they were getting intimate, Carly arrived with Rose's wedding gown. Paul left the house and told Crater to lie for him. Jack arrived and asked Paul where he was when the car was trashed. Crater lied for Paul then went and told Dusty.  Jack was also concerned that Paul had not called the police when Rose received the call.  Jack told Paul to react a little faster next time anything happened. Paul walked in just as Rose and Carly were admiring her dress. Rose stopped him and, after Rose took the dress off, Paul asked her to let him love her till death do they part.\n\n\n",
