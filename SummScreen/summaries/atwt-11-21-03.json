Craig asks, \"Think Barbar is doing body work?\"  But Rosanna thinks Paul may have done the deed.  She picks up her phone and calls him to see if he is all right.  After she sets a meeting up with him, she leaves for the Lakeview Lounge.  Even though Craig is not invited, he picks up their shopping bags and follows after his wife.\n\n\nCrater breaks into Paul's car and finds a bat and a pair of gloves that indicate he may have trashed Rose's car.  He hears a noise, then tries to hide behind the convertible.  It was only Mitzi returning home.  He continues to search the car until he hears someone coming.  He stashes the bat and gloves in the bushes, and closes the trunk.  Paul arrives and asks him why he's so far away from the door.  Crater says he thought he heard a noise.  On his way back to the door, Crater tells Paul he'll lie for him to the police if he needs help again.  Paul says thanks but no thanks, as he doesn't make lying to the police a regular habit.  Later, Crater calls Dusty to tell him about the bat and gloves that he found.  Dusty runs off to look at the evidence.\n\n\nInside Rose's place, Paul and Rose are planning last minute details for their wedding when Mitzi comes home.  Paul and Rose are angry that Mitzi didn't check in with them when she didn't come home last night.  The couple starts to suspect Mitzi may know something about the car, but Mitzi says she just spent the night alone because she needed some air.  Mitzi has enough of the conversation and walks off to her room.  Paul gets a call from Rosanna.  She asks to meet him at the Lakeview Lounge in a half-hour.  Paul leaves.  Mitzi walks out of her room with a pair of suitcases.  Rose thinks she won't be coming to the wedding.  Mitzi says she's right.  They hug, and Mitzi walks out.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Lucy forces Alison to admit that she is pregnant.  Susan gives her daughter a hug and says, \"I'm glad it came out.  You shouldn't be going through this alone.\"  Bob steps in to ask if she told Chris.  Alison fibs and tells everyone, \"The baby's not his.\"  Lucy asks who is the father, and Alison pins the baby on Aaron.  Just then, the man of the hour walks in to check on Alison, and Lucy asks him, \"How could you do this to me?\"  Alison tells Aaron the news.  Bob excuses himself.  Aaron sinks under the weight of the news of being a father.  He apologizes to Lucy, but of course it's not good enough.  Lucy wishes them both well, then storms off.  Aaron wants to run after her, but Susan stops him and says, \"No.  You wait a second.  You're gonna be a father.  That's serious business.  Playtime is over.\"\n\n\nBarbara calls Will and asks him about a video game, but Hal catches them talking on the phone and stops the conversation, then hangs up on her later.  As Barbara leaves the Lakeview Lounge, a man gets up to follow her.  Kim stops by to visit Hal and Will.  Kim starts to talk with Will, but he ignores her and walks away.\n\n\nBabs runs into Metro to try to get away from the man following her.  Molly confronts the man, who later identifies himself as a member of the Oakdale PD.  He says he was instructed to keep an eye on Barbara.  Smoke starts to come out of Babs' ears.\n\n\nHal meets Emily at Al's.  She wonders if Barbara will try to sneak another visit with Will, but Hal scoffs.  He says he has police surveillance tracking her every move, for now.  Babs rages into Al's and demands that Hal remove the spy.  He slowly finishes his sandwich, then tells her the police spy will stay on the job.  Barbara fixes her eyes, and says, \"You'll regret this Hal.  You think we're at war now?  Wait.\"  She turns on her heels and rushes out.\n\n\nDusty arrives at Rose's house and meets Crater.  Crater shows Dusty the bat and gloves.  Dusty tells him to return everything back to Paul's car because he wants to use this info later.\n\n\nAt the Lakeview Lounge, Rosanna asks Paul if he was the one who trashed Rose's car.  Paul denies any involvement.  Craig sits down at the bar behind them.  After a small civil chat, he leaves.  Rosanna then gets up and says hello to her husband.\n\n\nAaron asks Alison how in the world this could have happened.  Alison says all it takes is one time.  Susan comes over to comfort her daughter, while Aaron hyperventilates.  Alison tells Aaron she won't expect anything from him, and Katie steps in to advise them both to table that discussion for later.  Katie also tells Aaron to call Holden and Lily so he can be the one to tell them.  Aaron tells Alison he won't bail on her, then takes off to call his father.  Katie asks Alison who the real father is.  Aaron returns and says he couldn't get through to Holden.  Susan returns and takes Alison home.  After Susan and Alison are gone, Katie asks Aaron if he thinks Alison is telling the truth.  Aaron says they didn't use any protection, and that since Chris is a doctor he would have used protection.\n\n\nBob stops by to see Kim at Hal's.  He tells her about Alison's news.  A hair almost falls out of place on her head until she hears that Aaron, and not Chris, is the father.  Later, Kim calls Chris, and they nearly tell him Alison's news.\n\n\nLucy finds Rosanna at Al's and sobs that Aaron and Alison are having a baby.  Rosanna says she knows exactly how she feels.  Lucy doubts that.  Rosanna explains Carly once got pregnant by a man she loved.  Lucy is scared to tell her father, but Rosanna says he'll understand.\n\n\nPaul returns to Rose's home and he finds her depressed about Mitzi leaving.  A delivery man arrives with a package for Rose.  She opens the package and reads papers that reveal the buyers for her shop just backed out of the deal.  It dawns on her that Mitzi might be embezzling funds.\n\n\nMitzi bumps into Craig at the Lakeview lounge and asks him for a favor.  She wants a ticket out of town, but Craig doesn't think it's such a good idea.  After he leaves, she calls Jack and asks for a loan on his answering machine.\n\n\nDusty returns to the bar and tells Molly what he saw.  He says he wants to be the one to tell Rose about Paul.  \"I'm not concerned with making Rose feel bad.  I want her to tell me she's finished with Paul.\"  Molly advises him to go to the cops.  Dusty says, \"We're doing this my way.  That means no cops.\"  He turns and walks away.  Molly whispers, \"Yeah, we'll see about that.\"\n\n\n",
