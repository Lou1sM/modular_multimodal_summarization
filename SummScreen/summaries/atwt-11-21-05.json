She shows the shoe to Mike and tells him she wants to take it to Margo to investigate. Mike thinks Katie is way over-reacting. \n\n\nMaddie figures out that Henry must have been hinting that he is in the wine cellar at Fairwinds. Casey tries to talk her out of her detective mode, but Maddie isn't listening. She has a key to the mansion and is determined to search until she finds her brother. Casey volunteers to help her. \n\n\nBJ tells Henry that Maddie is convinced that her brother is safe in Palo Alto on a business trip. BJ doesn't understand why Henry is so protective of Mike Kasnoff. When Mike is \"out of the picture,\" BJ tells Henry, then Katie will turn to BJ for comfort. BJ takes Henry's remaining shoe and lectures Henry on what a miniscule contribution Henry has made to the world in his lifetime. BJ leaves Olga in charge of Henry in the wine cellar. \n\n\nAt Memorial Hospital, Dr. Bob tells Gwen that Iris has been poisoned and suggests that she be tested as well. Barbara overhears this conversation and suddenly remembers how Will poisoned Rose. \n\n\nIn Iris' hospital room, lawyer Cass Winthrop asks Iris who tried to poison her. Will arrives with Iris' insurance policy and dares her to name her attempted killer. Will voices the opinion that the culprit is Iris' drinking partner, Stan, whom he has just run into at Iris' home. Will gets a call from Gwen asking him to meet her immediately at Java, so he leaves. Cass continue to press Iris to name her poisoner, and then leaves to report a crime to the Chief of Staff. Iris leaves with a nurse to take another lab test, and Barbara finds the toxicology report naming Methanol as the drug used to poison Iris. \n\n\nBack at WOAK, Kim's assistant asks Katie for Henry's shoe so that she can overnight it to Henry on the West Coast. She tells Katie that Henry has requested it, so Katie surrenders the shoe, but she is not convinced that Henry is safe. \n\n\nMaddie and Casey arrive at Fairwinds and run straight into BJ. BJ allows them to search the premises for any sign of Henry, and Maddie cannot resist telling BJ that she hates smiley faces such as the one that is pictured on the present that Henry supposedly sent her from California. \n\n\nWill tells Gwen that he suspects Stan poisoned Iris, and Gwen begins to feel sorry for her mother. Will has no such sympathy and suggests that Gwen and the baby move out of Iris' house, but Gwen is fearful about violating the court order that demands she stay under Iris' supervision. \n\n\nBarbara realizes that Methanol was the very drug Will used to kill Rose, so she takes the lab report with her and leaves. \n\n\nIn the cellar at Fairwinds, Henry hits Olga over the head with a wine bottle, but she overcomes him again. Olga reports back to BJ who asks her if she has followed his latest instructions. \n\n\nCasey and Maddie find the empty wine cellar, and Maddie is almost convinced she was wrong about her suspicions when she finds a loose bottle on the floor with the word HELP written in its dust. \n\n\nHal responds to the report of a crime at the hospital and discusses Iris with Bob. Hal needs to interview Iris, so he goes to her room and asks her if she knows who poisoned her. Iris says she will tell all right, but not Hal. She changes her mind, however, and tells Hal it was his own \"kid\" who tried to kill her. \n\n\nAt Iris' house, Will suggests Gwen pack up the baby and bring him to where Will is staying at Kim and Bob's house. Gwen agrees, and Will goes outside to begin taking the baby equipment to the car. Barbara finds him and urges him to come with her. It is obvious that she thinks he poisoned Iris. \n\n\nWhen Maddie and Casey leave Fairwinds, one of BJ's henchmen arrives and receives the order to \"get rid of Mike\" tomorrow.  \n\n\n",
