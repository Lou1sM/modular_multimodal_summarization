When B.J. showed up, she pretended that she and Mike had had a terrific fight, and she broke into tears. B.J. comforted her and asked her to return to Fairwinds with him to get over Mike. Katie agreed as long as Henry wouldn't be there to bother her. B.J. assured her that Henry was on a business trip and would be nowhere around. Mike suddenly rushed in and stopped them from leaving.\n\n\nMeg and Dusty were cleaning up the Thanksgiving dishes at Emma's farm. They talked about moving in together, and Dusty was pushing for it. Meg finally agreed and got out her old hope chest that contained many memories from her childhood.\n\n\nJennifer visited Will in jail, and Barbara showed up. Barbara had been in contact with Will's psychiatrist in hopes of getting Will out of jail. Will could not believe his mother thought he'd poisoned Iris, and Barbara got furious with Will. While they were arguing loudly, Gwen arrived, and Jennifer left in a hurry. Gwen and Barbara argued over what was best for Will.\n\n\nIris and Stan arrived at Iris' house, very pleased with how well their plan to frame Will was working. Stan was disappointed that the police had taken all the liquor in the house to test it and proposed they adjourn to Yo's to have a drink. Iris did not feel all that well and asked Stan to drop her off at the pharmacy so she could fill her prescriptions.\n\n\nGwen found Carly and asked for help with Will. Carly wanted to help and asked Gwen to trust her. She had figured out that Iris was setting Will up to get rid of him. Gwen took the baby to Carly's house for the sitter to watch, and Carly left for Iris' house. She was sneaking around the outside when Jack suddenly grabbed her. He tried to talk her out of committing another felony by breaking and entering.\n\n\nA very distressed Jennifer went to Yo's for a meeting with her drug supplier. He was furious that he had lost all his last supply to Dusty and never been paid. He told Jennifer she needed to pay for that shipment, as well, or he wouldn't sell to her. Jennifer agreed to pay and got a small supply of crystal meth. She almost took the drug but then found one of Billy's toys in her purse; she broke into tears and hurled the drug away. Kim found her sobbing on the ground and took her away.\n\n\nBack at WOAK, Katie berated Mike for interfering with her life again. Mike was confused by Katie's behavior but was convinced to leave when one of B.J.'s \"security\" men arrived with a gun. The gunman roughly escorted Mike out.\n\n\nCarly arrived at Yo's, dressed like a dance-hall girl, and put the moves on Stan, who was sitting at the bar, looking for someone to talk to. He started babbling about coming into a great fortune in a few weeks. Back at Iris' house, Jack went into the house himself and found a folder containing newspaper articles about Will and how he'd poisoned Rose. Iris surprised him by arriving home and began to hit on him.\n\n\nMike got delivered back to Katie's house, where Maddie was still waiting. He called Katie and let her know he was wise to what she was trying to do. He told her she had better be home in two hours, or he would go to Fairwinds, looking for her.\n\n\nAt the farm, Meg found a plane ticket to Alaska, and Dusty asked her if that represented her way out if she needed to get away from him. Meg suggested that they burn the ticket.\n\n\nAt the jail, Gwen and Will kissed through the bars of his cell and declared their love for one another.\n\n\n",
