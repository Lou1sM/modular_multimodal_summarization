Katie rushed outside to call Alison to warn her then walked back in. Margo led the conversation around to a memorial service for Simon, but Katie immediately knew that Mike had asked Margo to broach the subject.\n\n\nAfter Margo and Tom left, Simon told Katie that he hoped she would want to get on with her life and that there would be a place for him in her new life. Katie confessed that she couldn't handle a traditional memorial service in which everyone sat around telling stories about Simon. She knew that she was ready to say goodbye to Simon, but she didn't know how. Katie felt a strong need to talk to Simon, so she took his ashes and went out alone for one last time with him.\n\n\nChris appeared at Alison's door, and Katie called just as Chris went inside, warning Alison that she needed to tell Chris right away if he were the father of Alison's baby. First Chris apologized for the way he had left Alison then Alison admitted to Chris that Aaron had been the person in the hotel room with her. At that moment, Aaron rushed in with a bag of maternity clothes, which was how Chris found out that Alison was pregnant. Chris at first assumed that the baby was his, but Aaron said that Alison had told him that Aaron himself was the father.\n\n\nAlison asked Aaron to give her time to talk with Chris alone, but when Chris asked if he was the baby's father, Alison told Chris that the one thing she would not lie about was the paternity of her child. She insisted that Aaron was the father. Chris told Alison that for a minute, he had thought the baby was his, and that had made him happy. He told Alison that he loved her, but it was obvious that she was still obsessed with Aaron.\n\n\nChris left, and when Aaron returned, Alison cried on his shoulder. Chris went to Metro and called Tom to meet him. Chris told Tom that he was in love with Alison, even though she said that she was pregnant with Aaron's baby and still wanted Aaron. Chris was angry because he was stuck in Oakdale, where he didn't want to be, since he had quit his job in Philadelphia.\n\n\nBarbara sat in the wedding chapel, telling herself, \"I just can't let this happen.\" Jennifer walked in and begged Barbara not to do something desperate to stop the wedding. When Jennifer begged Barbara to accept Rose, Barbara replied, \"Rose D'Angelo has destroyed everything that is precious to me, and she will be my enemy until one of us is dead.\" After Jennifer begged Barbara to give up her hatred for Rose and to accept her as part of the family, Barbara pretended to agree and told Jennifer that she would stay home from the wedding the next day. Jennifer left, and Barbara drew a gun from her purse, saying, \"I'm sorry, Jennifer. This wedding won't happen tomorrow -- or any other day. I will do what I have to do.\"\n\n\nOutside the back door of the Snyder farm, Hal informed Paul that he suspected Paul of harassing Rose, although he didn't have proof. Will walked outside, and Paul gave him a camera for his computer that would enable the brothers to talk \"face-to-face\" every day, even though one would be in Oakdale and the other in Paris. Before Paul left, he thanked Hal for taking such good care of Will.\n\n\nAt Rose's house, Dusty showed Rose proof that Paul had made the threatening calls and damaged her car. He showed her paint, windshield glass, gloves, and a bat that he had found in Paul's trunk. He begged her to call the wedding off, saying, \"Your life depends on it.\" Rose threw Dusty out of her house, telling him to leave and never return.\n\n\nDusty returned to Metro, telling Molly that Rose hadn't believe him. Dusty told Molly that, in spite of her objections, he was going to continue to try to save Rose from Paul. When Paul returned to the penthouse, he was surprised to find Rose there, since he had expected her to spend the night before the wedding apart from him. She told him about Dusty's accusations, so he rushed back out the door after kissing her, saying, \"Remember -- I love you. Forever and always.\"\n\n\nPaul rushed into Metro, punched Dusty, and warned Dusty to stop harassing Rose. Paul left. Back in the penthouse, Rose looked through Paul's desk for a compact disc, and she found the voice alternator. After a few minutes Paul returned to the penthouse and found Rose gone and the desk in disarray. He told himself, \"She found it.\" Rose entered Metro and held out the device to Molly and Dusty. She asked Molly, \"Is this the voice alternator you found in Paul's pocket?\"\n\n\n",
