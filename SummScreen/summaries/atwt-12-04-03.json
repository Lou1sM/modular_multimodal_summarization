Alison told Katie that Chris was staying, and Katie told Alison that sooner or later, he would find out that the baby was his. Alison didn't feel that Chris loved her, and she wouldn't use the baby to make him be with her.\n\n\nKatie asked Alison about Aaron. He thought he was the father of her baby, and it wasn't fair to him to make him believe he was. Alison was about to leave when she ran into Chris. Chris wanted to know how sure Alison was about who the father was. Chris wanted Alison to have an ultrasound so he could be sure that the baby wasn't his.\n\n\nHal asked Will to call his mother. Hal was concerned about what Barbara would do at the wedding. Hal convinced Will to help Hal protect Will's mother. Will called his mother and told her he wanted to see her. Barbara caught on that Hal was involved and asked Will to put his father on the phone. She then proceeded to tell Hal off, and Hal warned her that she'd better not pull anything, but Barbara wasn't listening. After she hung up on Hal, Barbara pulled a gun out of her purse.\n\n\nAt the church, Paul was telling Rose that it was he who had made the phone call, because he had been trying to protect her. Paul was adamant about Rose telling him the truth about where she had been the night before. Rose never told Paul that she had been with Dusty. After she left to get ready, Paul turned around and called Rose a liar. Paul returned to his apartment and was having hallucinations about Rose and Dusty together, plus hearing his father's voice telling him not to call off the wedding.\n\n\nPaul finally emerged from his daze when Jennifer called his name. Jennifer gave Paul a gift and apologized for not being more supportive of him and Rose. She said that she was going to the wedding. Jennifer noticed that Paul was acting strangely, and when she asked him about it, Paul told her that he knew exactly what he had to do and that Rose was going to get the wedding she had always deserved.\n\n\nEmily caught Molly snooping around Rose's place. After arguing, Molly told Emily that there wasn't going to be a wedding because Rose had spent the night in Dusty's arms. Molly left and went back to Metro, where she ran into Lily. She told Lily that Rose was the one who was causing all the trouble and that Rose couldn't decide which man she wanted.\n\n\nBack at Rose's, Carly and Emily wanted to know what was going on with Rose. Rose told them that she was really nervous about the wedding and that she was upset over Mitzi. Just as they were about to get ready, Dusty showed up and asked Rose if she had called off the wedding. Rose told him that she was marrying Paul.\n\n\n",
