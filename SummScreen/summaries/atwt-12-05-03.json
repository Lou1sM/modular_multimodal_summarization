Paul claimed he had later realized the mix-up, so he had gone shopping instead. He had bought a present for Rose. He dismissed his earlier rage as pre-wedding jitters. Paul said, \"Living well is the best revenge. And I will have lots of revenge.\" He excused himself to get ready for the wedding.\n\n\nRose told Dusty she was going forward with marrying Paul, despite his threat to kill her. She also said Dusty needed to accept the fact he couldn't see her anymore. Dusty whispered, \"What if I say no?\" Then he threatened to tell Paul she had spent the night before in his arms. She said Paul had had nothing to do with damaging her car. Inside, Emily was at the door, trying to eavesdrop. Carly decided to call Jack to help her break up Rose and Dusty.\n\n\nJack received Carly's call while he was at Hal's place. He headed over to help out. Hal called his stakeout team at the church and told them to conduct a thorough search of the church and to make sure his ex-wife didn't get inside. One of the cops sniped, \"I had a wife like that.\"\n\n\nAs the cops entered the church, they saw a shadow move and heard someone walking. They asked, \"Who's there?\" They saw someone sitting in a pew. The figure stood up and slowly turned around. Barbara was wearing a nun's outfit and makeup and was holding a rosary. The cops didn't question her presence and apologized for disturbing the sister. Barbara just grinned menacingly.\n\n\nBack outside Rose's house, Dusty said he was trying to protect her not because he wanted her back but only because he cared for her safety. Rose called his bluff and said Paul would forgive her if he found out about \"last night,\" because Paul was just that kind of guy. Right after Dusty grabbed Rose to help him get his point across, Lily arrived and told him to get his hands off her sister. Carly and Emily also joined the group and told Rose to say goodbye to Dusty. Rose said, \"I've been trying to do that, but he won't take 'no' for an answer.\"\n\n\nLily said, \"There's a name for people like that.\" Dusty asked her to prove that she wanted him to leave, so she slapped him. Soon after, Jack arrived. He grabbed Dusty by the arm, but Dusty shook Jack loose and walked away under his own power. Jack made sure Dusty returned to his car. Emily and Carly went back inside while Rose and Lily chit-chatted. Rose claimed Dusty had threatened to tell Paul about \"last night.\" Lily promised she would handle Dusty then took off to look for him.\n\n\nKatie and Mike prepared for the wedding. Katie looked stunning in her dress, but Mike couldn't find a tux, and his black suit was at the cleaners. Katie didn't seem to mind. She suddenly remembered she had to feed Snickers and slipped out. Later, she returned wearing a frumpy outfit to match the best of what Mike had available to wear. Katie admitted she and Mike were best friends and that she was ready to move on with the rest of her life.\n\n\nRose, Carly, and Emily arrived at the church and headed off to the prep room. Ms. Walsh was already waiting inside and wanted to confirm that Mitzi wouldn't be a part of the wedding. Rose briefly filled her in on Mitzi's character and wasn't happy to find out Lucinda had given her $500. Rose wrote Mitzi off and said, \"That means she won't be here to wreck my wedding.\"\n\n\nBack at Rose's house, Mitzi unlocked the door and confirmed no one was home. Once inside, she said, \"Now's my chance to stop you from sending me to prison.\"\n\n\nCarly noticed Rose's shoes were missing. Lucinda gave Carly and Emily the keys to her car to go get the shoes. After the girls left, Barbara sneaked up to the door and eavesdropped. She pulled out a gun and reached for the door until she heard voices. Inside, Lucinda gave Rose a beautiful antique mirror. She told a story of how she looked in the mirror to find strength and confidence.\n\n\nRose wondered why Lucinda hadn't given the heirloom to Faith or Lily. Lucinda said she saw a bit of herself in Rose. Rose asked if Lucinda would walk her down the aisle, since Rose's father was sick and couldn't make it. Lucinda accepted. Rose let down her guard, let a tear fall, and then said, \"I'm just starting to have fun for the first time!\"\n\n\nJack escorted Dusty back inside Metro. Dusty asked what Jack was doing about Paul threatening to hurt Rose. \"If you people can't get it together to protect the woman, I'm going to have to do it myself.\" Jack looked around the club and made a veiled threat about causing trouble for Dusty and his club if Dusty didn't stay away from Rose. After Jack left, Lily stepped up for round two.\n\n\nLily warned Dusty not to tell Paul about \"last night\" and said, \"Don't you get it? This wedding is going to go off no matter what you say.\" Dusty turned everything around and pointed the finger at Lily. He accused her of making Rose's head spin with crazy ideas of her love for Paul. Dusty accused Lily of wanting Rose to marry Paul because, \"You don't want her to hook up with me.\"\n\n\nDusty thought Lily still had a secret passion burning for her ex-lover. Lily tried to slap him, but Dusty grabbed her arm and whispered, \"Your sister's a lot quicker.\" Lily turned to leave, and on her way out, Dusty uttered, \"See you at the wedding!\"\n\n\nJennifer couldn't resist finding out what Paul had bought for Rose. She pulled out a beautiful red goblet, but Paul caught her. He encouraged her to look at the rest. She blushed and then found an expensive bottle of champagne and other matching goblets for the bridesmaids.\n\n\nMitzi finally found the old books from the Roller Palace, but she heard Emily and Carly approach the front door.\n\n\nLucinda finished buttoning up the backside of Rose's dress before she asked if there was anything else Rose needed. Rose asked for a moment alone to compose herself. Lucinda obliged and left Rose alone in the room. After Lucinda was gone, Sister Barbara took a few steps toward Rose's door, gun in hand.\n\n\nHal arrived at the church and checked in with his police detail. One officer said, \"Everyone is accounted for, even the nun.\" Hal wondered what a Catholic nun was doing at a non-Catholic church. It didn't take him long to figure out Barbara was up to something, and he raced inside the church, looking for his ex-wife.\n\n\nBarbara reached the door, opened it just a crack, and pointed her gun directly at Rose's head.\n\n\n",
