She goes to the hospital where she gets Gwen's records and calls Dusty over. She reveals to him that Billy's blood type makes it impossible for Gwen to be his mother. A stunned Dusty doesn't understand how this happened or what it means. Meg then pretends to retrace her steps during the time she performed the blood tests and feigns a terrible realization that when she was called away from the lab for a moment, she saw Paul in the corridor. Meanwhile, Jennifer tries to force a reconciliation between Paul and Will but she's thrown when Will shows up with Billy in tow. She tries to hold onto herself, but Emily sees she's in trouble and takes the baby away. Later, Jennifer admits to Emily her one time belief that Billy was hers and Emily works hard to convince her to leave town as soon as possible. Katie is shocked to find out that BJ has taken her to his private island. She manages to get the conversation around to Henry and BJ surprises her by agreeing to take her to see Henry in Palo Alto.

    "tvmega_recap": "Mike is growing more concerned with Katie whom is still missing. The FBI won't help him so he is going to do some of his own PI work. Maddie sees Olga ordering Henry's favorite and very bizarre coffee drink. An overwhelmed Maddie demands to know what she has done with her brother, but Olga pushes her away and takes off. Mike who has just arrived is hot on her tail though. BJ takes Katie to his private island where he tries to make her forget the rest of the world; only she is trying to work him to find out where Henry is. She pretends to have a revelation about why she messed up her relationship with Mike. She needs to have closure with Henry . Can he fly her to Palo Alto? He agrees to, but then he supposedly finds out the pilot is on the mainland picking up parts for the plane and won't be back till tomorrow. Meg can't deal with the guilt over having lied about Jen's baby. She calls Dusty to the hospital pretending to have figured out a mistake in the blood work that might have caused an incorrect result regarding who is Billy's biological mother. She steers Dusty conveniently in the direction of Paul being involved. Dusty's interest is now piqued. Jen wants Will and Paul to make up, as she continues to be preoccupied by Billy when he is around. Will and Paul finally hash things out, as Jen admits to Emily that when she holds Billy it is like coming home, and that is why she is leaving town. Emily suggests that she not wait; she should leave town - tonight.",
