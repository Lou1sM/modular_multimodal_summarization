She asked Gwen whether she and Will were in love, because it looked that way to her, and Gwen admitted that they were. Carly then told her she hoped they would be careful, because even though they love Billy, they don't need another baby right this minute, and Gwen said they hadn't found any \"alone\" time yet to worry about that kind of thing. Carly then offered to keep Billy for the night so that Gwen and Will could get away, and after discussing it with Will, Gwen decided to take her up on the offer. Carly promised to take good care of Billy and promised Gwen that he'd be right there when they got back in the morning.\n\n\nGwen and Will drove up to Barbara's cabin, where it was snowing hard, and they again professed their love for one another and for Billy, with Will telling Gwen, \"Billy's happy because he's got you, and you're happy because you've got me, and I'm quite the catch, you know!\" They kissed and began to undress one another as they prepared to make love for the first time.\n\n\nJennifer ran into Meg at Java and told her how much she appreciated how honest Meg has always been with her. Meg tried to find out whether Jennifer thought she might ever want to have a relationship with Dusty again, if things were different or after she came back from Europe, and Jenn said she'd never do that to Meg after all Meg has done for her. Meg told Jennifer that she loves Dusty and thinks he loves her, and Jennifer said she was sure that by the time she returned from Europe, Meg and Dusty would be married and have a baby of their own.\n\n\nJennifer then went to Carly's house looking for Will, to tell him that Paul and Emily's wedding had been moved up to the next day, but Carly, who was holding Billy,  told her Will and Gwen had gone for a long drive in the country. Jennifer reached out to Billy, who grabbed her hand and held it tight.\n\n\nHal and Dusty met Tom at the courthouse and told him they needed a warrant to get into the medical records room at the hospital. When Tom asked for more details, they told him they needed to see the DNA test that had been done on \"the baby known as Billy Norbeck.\" Tom had a fit and said that those records had been sealed and no one was supposed to know about them, and he demanded to know how they'd found out about the DNA test. Dusty told him that he'd overheard Casey talking to Will about it and that he'd then asked Casey about the test. Tom was upset that Dusty had questioned Casey about anything at all. Hal explained that they weren't interested in Casey's role in the matter but rather in the fact that it was possible the baby in question had been switched at birth, but Tom was disbelieving. Hal and Dusty told Tom that they had proof that Gwen Norbeck could not be that baby's mother, and Hal said he thought it was possible that Gwen's baby had actually been switched with Jennifer's baby. Tom then agreed to get the warrant for them, and they left to go pick it up at the station.\n\n\nTom called Casey and asked him to meet him down at the courthouse. When Casey arrived, Tom asked about the incident with Dusty and whether Casey had told the full truth about his relationship with Gwen. Casey continued to deny that he had ever, even once, slept with Gwen.\n\n\nEmily called Susan on the phone, pretending to be distraught and saying she had to see her right away. She went to the hospital and burst into tears, telling Susan that the wedding to Paul was off because she'd found out that Paul had lied to her about not being in love with Rosanna anymore. Susan tried to comfort Emily, and while they were hugging each other, Emily reached into Susan's lab coat and pulled out her keys. Susan had to leave to take care of a patient, and Emily and Paul used Susan's keys to unlock the medical records room. They eventually realized they needed to be looking for \"Rory Cabot\" and not a baby named \"Norbeck,\" and then Paul found the password for the computer in the room and deleted the record for Rory Cabot. Emily found the hard copy in the file and was about to shred it when Hal and Dusty burst into the room, with Hal shouting at Emily, \"Don't even think about doing that, Emily!\"\n\n\n",
