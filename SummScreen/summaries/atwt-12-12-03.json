Lucy's ears perk up and Alison's heart starts to race.  Aaron just numbs out.  The JP says all they need to do is sign another license.  After Aaron looks at Lucy, he sighs and says, \"Where do I sign?\"  He starts for the other room, but Lucy grabs his arm and says he doesn't have to go through with it.  Aaron's sense of duty wins out, and he signs the document making everything official.  While he is out of the room, Lucy takes off.  Aaron wants to get home to help his family with Rose's medical situation, but Alison has other plans.  She suggests they get a hotel room and leave around noon the next day.  Aaron won't listen, \"Alison!  We're goin' home now!\"  Alison furrows her brow because she knows she will have to confront Chris about the scheduled sonogram if she returns.  Alison feigns sickness and tells Aaron she should stay overnight.  Aaron doesn't want to leave her in a foreign town all alone, so he grabs the marriage license, then her arm, and they head back home.\n\n\nRozilla's fangs come out in the hospital chapel after hearing Craig's ultimatum, \"My darling, ...I am not going home simply because you want me there instead of here.\"  Craig argues Paul is playing his wife for a fool, \"His is a junky for attention.  Despite your friend's Mommy issues, tonight, we need you a little more than he does.\"  Craig thinks Lucy is at home brooding over Aaron, until Rosanna tells him his daughter is probably off looking for Aaron since she told Lucy where Aaron and Alison went.  Craig immediately tries to call his daughter, but she doesn't answer.  Craig decides to run off to look for Lucy on his own, giving Rosanna permission to stay behind.  Before he leaves, Rosanna concedes, and leaves with her husband.\n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Carly can't understand Molly's sudden lack of empathy for Rose especially since her own husband, Jake, was murdered.  Molly doesn't feel sorry for Rose because she was in Dusty's arms the night before she was to marry Paul.  Carly understands.  Molly is jealous.  Molly softens her voice, then deadpans, \"Yup.  That's my problem.  You completely figured me out.\"  Molly turns and walks away leaving Carly catching flies.  Outside the diner, Molly talks to herself, \"I have to find out what they know.\"\n\n\nAt Barbara's suite, Jen begins to suspect her mother has something to do with Rose's poisoning.  While her back is turned to her daughter, Barbara takes this opportunity to collect the gloves she used to handle the goblet Rose used to toast her wedding.  She stuffs the gloves in her purse so she can dispose them later.  Babs turns and fixes her gaze on Jen then says, \"Rose D'Angelo will never hurt this family again...alive or dead.\"  Later, Barbara stuffs the gloves in a drawer, then utters the best line of today's episode, \"Someday, they'll thank me for cleaning up their messes.\"  Jen packs up and heads off to the hospital to be there for Paul.  Barbara wants to ride along with Jen, but her daughter advises her to stay behind.  Jen leaves, then Babs quickly follows.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Rose's heart monitor continues to register a flatline.  John is called to help.  Lily has a meltdown while Holden tries to comfort his wife.  Dusty seethes with anger at Paul.  Paul is mired in the wake of his own doing until Lily grabs him and shakes him back into the here and now, \"What did you do!!  I told you stay away from her!!\"  Dusty chimes in to suggest Paul wormed his way back in Rose's room to finish what he started.  Paul lunges for Dusty, but Hal and Jack are there to break the two apart.  Jack takes Paul into the Chapel to cool off.  \n\n\nPaul pleads with Jack to let him return to keep a vigil.  Jack asks him if he poisoned Rose.  Paul responds with a question of his own, \"Do you remember what it felt when you found out about Mike and Carly?\"  Jack tries to avoid the parallel, but Paul presses him to answer.  Jack says he was angry, and Paul says he felt the same way but not angry enough to poison Rose.  Paul wants another chance to make things right with Rose before she dies, and Jack looks at the altar and snidely says, \"You're in a chapel.  Pray that doesn't happen.\"  Paul asks Jack to check on Rose.  After Jack is gone, Paul kneels to pray.  He says, \"OK Father, you have to save Rose....\"  The music sours, then James appears and says, \"You know?  I don't think so.\"  Paul gets up as his father taunts him saying that even on her deathbed, Rose still wants Dusty.  Paul scampers around for something to ground his soul, but grasps for air.\n\n\nHal eschews Dusty off into a corner and tells him he doesn't think Paul committed the crime.  Dusty admits he was with Rose the night before.  He also admits he should have told Rose just how much he really loved her when he had the chance.  \n\n\nAround the corner, Lily shakes with worry.  John returns with a diagnosis, \"Her internal organs are shutting down.\"  They ask how much time Rose has left and John just shakes his head.  Emily comforts Lily and encourages her to spend these precious last moments with her sister.  She composes herself, then enters Rose's room.  Lucinda and Holden are already there.  Lucinda promises to bring her father to her bedside as quickly as she can.  Both Lucinda and Holden leave the sisters alone.  Rose tells her sister she doesn't want to die.  Lily says, \"I won't let you.\"  Rose asks Lily to find Mitzi and tell her she is forgiven.  Lily asks what for, but Rose says she'll understand.  Lily assures her she will take care of Mitzi.  Rose continues to say her good-byes to Lily.  She tells Lily she needs to see Paul one last time.  \n\n\nHolden runs into Molly outside.  She asks about Rose's status.  Holden confides they know she was poisoned with Methanol.  Holden also tells her Dusty is off somewhere with Hal.\n\n\nDusty asks Hal to check on Rose, but before he leaves, he tells him to pass along the message that he loves her, \"She's gotta know that.\"  After Hal walks away, Dusty turns around and spies Molly who heard every word.  She lays into him hard, \"You love Rose?!\"  Dusty yells back telling her she doesn't know what she's talking about and accuses her of being jealous.  Molly knows her place and points out her role, \"I'm just the woman you slept with while you couldn't have the woman you loved.  You destroyed her!  You were the one who brought poison into her life.  So you get to live with that!\"  She's through with this joker, but before she leaves, she has one more zinger, \"I guess I'm lucky I'm the one you didn't love.\"\n\n\nCraig and Rosanna return home and find Lucy sitting on the sofa crying.  The parents stand in the doorway and debate who should comfort her.  Craig winces because he usually makes things worse when she is crying about Aaron.  Rosanna leans in and whispers, \"Well...don't do that.\"  Rosanna walks off to check on Cabot.  Craig gathers some fake compassion, then sits next to his daughter.  Lucy embraces her father and cries on his shoulder, then she says, \"Aaron and Alison...they got married.  They got married!  Not only is she having his baby.  She's his wife!!\"  They hug, and as he whispers comforting sweet nothings in his daughter's ear, a grin surfaces on his face despite his urge to suppress it.  Later, Rosanna returns and she tells Lucy about Rose's condition.  Lucy wants to go to the hospital, but Craig reminds her Aaron might be there.  Lucy hesitates.\n\n\nAlison runs into Chris at the hospital and she can't wait to tell him she is now married to Aaron.  This doesn't persuade Chris to drop the sonogram issue.\n\n\nAs Paul kneels at the altar making deals with God, Lily walks in with Jack and asks him to visit Rose.\n\n\nMolly sits down at a booth at Al's Diner and opens a small brown paper bag.  She pulls out a bottle of Methanol and says, \"Somebody's gotta pay for what happens to Rose.\"\n\n\nPaul sits down next to Rose, and promises to make everything up to her as he strokes her hair.  As the strength of life ebbs out of her body, Rose whispers with a serene smile, \"Why did you do this to me?\"  As Paul tries to explain how he wasn't involved in poisoning her, Rose closes her eyes and then the heart monitor flatlines again.  Lily is standing close by and screams at Paul to get away from her sister.  John arrives, and everyone clears the room.  Lily and Paul rejoin everyone waiting in the lobby.  They all stand at attention and want to know what is going on.  Dusty whispers, \"Is she alive?\"  Before John returns, Lily zones out and says, \"She's gone.\"  Dr. Dixon joins the group a moment later with a defeated look on his face and only says, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\nJack walks up to Hal and asks, \"What do we do?\"  Hal says,  \"Now?  We say good-bye to our friend...and then we find out who murdered her.\"  The camera pans around first to Dusty, then to Barbara, and finally lands on Paul.\n\n\n",
