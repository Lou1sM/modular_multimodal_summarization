Jennifer went by Carly's house and asked to hold Billy for a while, since she was leaving for Europe the next day. Jennifer left just as Jack arrived home, and she went home to Barbara, where she admitted that when she held Billy, she thought that he was her lost baby. Jennifer was so upset that she called the airline and made plans to leave that very night.\n\n\nAt the hospital, as Susan was telling Meg that her key to the records room had disappeared, Paul had just deleted Rory Cabot's record from the computer. Emily started to shred the paper copy of the report, which showed the baby's blood type, when Hal and Dusty burst in the door. Dusty looked at the partially shredded page and announced that there was enough evidence to prove that Jennifer was the baby's mother. Hal told Paul and Emily, \"This sheet of paper is enough to send you both to prison.\"\n\n\nHal discovered Susan's ID in Emily's hand and demanded that Emily tell him what Paul had \"coerced\" her into doing. Emily responded that she loved Paul and would not betray him. Susan watched as officers arrested Paul and Emily and led them out of the hospital. Dusty and Hal went to a lab technician and had a DNA test done to compare a strand of Jennifer's hair to the partially shredded report on the baby. The technician confirmed that Rory Cabot was actually Jennifer Munson's baby. Hal rushed to the courthouse to find a judge who would return the baby to Jennifer.\n\n\nWhen Dusty told Meg the news, she began to worry that Paul would implicate her. Her worry increased when Dusty told her that he wanted to be with Hal when he gave the baby to Jennifer.\n\n\nEmily and Paul waited together in a room at the police station when Susan arrived and asked them, \"What kind of monsters are you?\" She continued, telling Emily that she had regressed into an unstable, dishonest child again.\n\n\nHal and Dusty arrived at Jack and Carly's house with the court order to take the baby.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Will and Gwen make love and admit how much they mean to one another. However, Gwen gets nervous about getting back to Billy, and Will gets insecure about why she would want to leave so quickly. Gwen admits that she is nervous about living up to his expectations, but then admits that she dreamt about them being together like this and it surpassed her wildest dreams. They decide to stay and fall back into bed again. Jen shows up at Carly and Jack's wanting to say good-bye to Billy. Carly finally relents and lets her. Jen shares an emotional goodbye with him and then leaves. Later Barbara tries to convince her to cancel her trip when she opens the suitcase Jen had originally packed for the hospital when Billy was to be born. Jen instead pushes up her reservations and decides to leave that night. Hal and Dusty catch Paul and Emily shredding papers in the hospital record's room and arrest them. Hal tries to get Emily to roll over on Paul, but she stays loyal. They agree to stick together, much to Susan and Hal's disappointment. The doctor gives Hal and Dusty irrefutable proof that Jen's baby is alive and it is Billy. Hal goes to the courthouse to make provisions to get him back. Meg worries when Dusty admits that he almost told Paul the truth about Meg's part in his downfall. She also feels guilty when Dusty thanks her for being the hero in getting Jen's baby back. Hal shows up at Carly and Jack's to take Billy out of their house, because of the proof they have that shows he is Jen's biological baby. Carly will not let him go.",
