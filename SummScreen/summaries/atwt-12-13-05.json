Realizing she still hadn't been told, he urged her to leave for the airport right away, to avoid Dusty's big bombshell that her baby was alive. Jennifer prepared to leave and shared warm moments with Barbara.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Emily and Paul began to wonder how the truth had finally fallen into Dusty's lap. It was then that Meg entered the police station, and a suspicious Emily and Paul tried to trap Meg into confessing. However, Meg insisted she wouldn't have told Dusty, especially since doing so would result in her losing him. Paul believed Meg, but Emily still had her doubts. Later, Emily was given the chance to turn on Paul when Hal presented her with the option of going to jail or turning state's evidence on her husband-to-be.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Gwen and Will were enjoying a time out of time up at the cabin, completely unaware that back at Milltown, Carly was being forced to turn Billy over to Hal and Dusty. Carly did her best to put them off, insisting they wait until Gwen got back before doing anything.

    "tvmega_recap": "Lily meets with Holden regarding their divorce. She wants him to stop making things so hard, but he won't give her a divorce. He knows she doesn't want it. Keith witnesses this. After Holden leaves, Keith pleads for Lily to give their relationship a chance because he will always make her happy and never cheat on her like Holden did. Later, Lily ends up at the barn with Holden though. They share memories of their Christmas traditions, which winds up with a roll in the hay. Jen calls Paul to say goodbye, and when he hears she is leaving town that night, he couldn't be happier. It looks like she will leave town before the secret gets out. Meg pretends to know nothing about the reasons why Paul and Emily were arrested. They believe her, and agree to not let anyone know of her role in order of keeping Dusty away from Jen. Hal and Dusty show up at Carly and Jack's to take Billy. They have irrefutable proof he is Jen's child. At first they don't believe it, but as Hal fills in the missing pieces, it does start to make sense. Carly doesn't want them to take Billy right then because Gwen is out of town. They have to because Jen is leaving town in the morning. Hal has to go back to the station, and asks if Dusty will bring his grandson to his daughter? Dusty happily agrees. Gwen and Will share a blissful night at the cabin, preparing to come home with toys for Billy, unaware of what is going on in Oakdale. Dusty shows up at Jen's with her baby, but finds out from the bellman that she is on her way to the airport. He is about to leave when Jen shows back up, as a smiling Dusty is standing there holding Billy in his arms.",
