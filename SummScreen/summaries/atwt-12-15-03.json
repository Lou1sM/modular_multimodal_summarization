Ben checks the lock and finds that it has not been forced, and they remember that the only other people who have keys are Bonnie, Isaac, and Curtis, all who they believe are out of town.  Jessica immediately jumps to the conclusion that Sarah must have done the damage.  She calls the Center and demands that Troy come over right away.  Troy comes with Sarah, and Jessica angrily shows them her trashed house.  Sarah defiantly insists that she didn't do it, and Troy tells Jessica and Ben that Sarah was in bed with the flu the entire time they were gone on their honeymoon.  Just then, Curtis comes in the door and cheerfully welcomes the newlyweds' home.\n\n\nAt Al's Diner, Alison calls to cancel the sonogram, so that neither Chris nor Aaron can find out that the baby is actually Chris'.  At the hospital, Chris tells Susan that he ordered the sonogram because he thinks the baby might be his, and he is the first to break the news to Susan that Alison and Aaron were married the previous night.  Aaron joins Alison, and the two agree that their marriage doesn't seem real.  Alison suggests that the two of them go to Chicago to the Women's Health Center rather than to Oakdale Memorial, but her plan is interrupted when Susan calls and berates her for not telling her about the marriage.  Susan demands that Alison come to the hospital to talk to her and to have the sonogram.  In spite of Alison's repeated attempts to go to Chicago, Aaron bundles her up and takes her to the hospital. As soon as they arrive, Susan sends Aaron off to get her a cup of coffee so that she can speak to Alison alone.  Susan tells Alison that Aaron is too nice a boy to be saddled with a baby that is not even his.  Chris arrives and confronts Alison about canceling the sonogram.  Aaron returns and shouts, \"Leave my wife alone,\" but then turns and asks Alison why Chris is talking about a sonogram.  Instead of answering, Alison keeps trying to get Aaron to leave with her.  Chris finally interrupts and tells Aaron that he and Alison had unprotected sex and that he thinks the baby might be his.  Aaron, Chris, and Susan all insist that she have the sonogram immediately, and Susan is able to get Alison's appointment reinstated.   An orderly takes Alison in a wheelchair to her sonogram, while the others just stand there and don't accompany her.\n\n\nAt Oakdale Memorial, Joe D'Angelo arrives from Italy and Lucinda must tell him that Rose has died.  In the room where Rose's body still lies, Dusty cries and promises Rose that he will make the person who killed her pay.  Lily, overhearing, blows up at Dusty and accuses him of coming between her and Rose.  She tells him, \"There's no hero in this story, just two selfish men!\"   Lily cries to Holden in the hospital chapel, \"I feel so alone.\"  Holden leaves to go help Joe, and Dusty enters the chapel.  Joe cries at the sight of his daughter's body, slips his ring on her finger, then, bewildered that his daughter has been murdered, sobs to Holden, \"The whole world loved my little Rose.\"  In the chapel, at first Dusty blames Lily for pushing Rose toward Paul, then admits to her, \"It's not your fault.\"  Lily cries and cries, but Dusty finally tells her that Rose is still living in Lily.  She collapses in Dusty's arms just as Holden enters the chapel.\n\n\nBarbara arrives at the police station to tell Hal her theory that Dusty wanted revenge on Rose and Paul for marrying, so Dusty murdered Rose himself and framed Paul.  At the same time, Paul comes to the church, tears off the police tape, and walks down the aisle toward a figure covered by a white veil.  He begs the veiled figure for forgiveness, and a ghostly Rose throws back the veil and tells him that it is too late.  A policeman arrives to find Paul there and the vision disappears.  Paul collapses on the altar in hysteria, and the policeman calls Hal to tell him Paul's whereabouts, since the police were looking for Paul.  When Hal arrives at the church, he discovers Paul sitting in a pew begging for forgiveness.  This, of course, makes Hal suspicious, but Paul insists, \"I'd never hurt Rose.\"  Hal tells Paul that the fact that Rose had had nothing to eat or drink but the champagne Paul brought to her makes it clear that the poison was in Rose's glass of champagne.  Paul admits that he bought the champagne and the special red glass to lull Rose into a false sense of security, so that she would be totally set up for her humiliation at the altar.  Paul tells Hal that he poured the champagne into the four glasses and left the tray in the hall outside their room.  Paul insists that he did not put poison in the glass, and he suggests that Hal find out who took the champagne and the glasses.  Hal answers, \"I think I might already have an idea.\"  Barbara is lurking outside the door, eavesdropping.  Hal then tells Paul the evidence that points to premeditation:  the disguised-voice threats and the vandalism to Rose's car.  When Paul denies the vandalism, Barbara, still outside the door, looks frantic.  Hal leaves, admonishing Paul not to leave town.  Barbara quickly disappears. \n\n\n",
