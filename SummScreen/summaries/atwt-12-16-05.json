Olga entered the room after Mike fell asleep and was about to inject him with something when she heard Maddie outside the room. Olga hid, and while Maddie woke Mike up and talked to him, Olga slipped out of the room and went back to Fairwinds.\n\n\nMaddie found out from Mike that BJ and Katie were back. Mike said Katie couldn't help her try to find Henry anymore because it was too dangerous. Maddie cried, and Mike said he would try to find Henry after he got out of the hospital if Maddie would promise not to push Katie into trying to get to BJ anymore and promise not to go after BJ herself. Maddie promised.\n\n\nBJ took Katie back to her cottage, saying he felt like being alone with her. He found pictures of Katie and Mike and got Katie to agree to burn them in the fireplace. BJ told Katie that since they'd taken care of Mike, they just needed to take care of Henry. He said he had called Henry in California and told him he needed to return to Oakdale so Katie could see him and that Henry had said he would get there as soon as he could.\n\n\nAt Fairwinds, Henry sweet-talked Olga into believing that BJ was treating her poorly and Henry would know how to treat her right. She grabbed Henry and kissed him, and when she got him down on the floor, Henry told her she deserved a comfortable bed, and he suggested they go upstairs. Olga unlocked the wine cellar, and Henry turned and threw her back into the cellar then he escaped.\n\n\nAt the Hugheses' house, Casey showed Tom his acceptance letter to the University of Wisconsin. Tom was happy for him. Casey appeared to be most interested in what fraternity he could join there. When Margo got home, she congratulated Casey on being accepted at his first choice of colleges. Tom tried to tell Margo that while she'd been out of town, something had happened concerning Gwen's baby, but Margo didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\nGwen went to visit the baby at Barbara's apartment. Barbara wasn't going to let her in, but Will intervened. While the baby slept in her arms, Gwen told him she knew he would have a good mom but that his new mom could never love him more than she did. As Barbara took Johnny away, Gwen told Will, \"He'll forget me, but I will never forget him.\" She asked Will what the baby's real name was, and Will said, \"John Dustin Kasnoff,\" but he thought it would probably end up being Munson instead of Kasnoff. That made Gwen realize that her baby had been buried under that name at the cemetery.\n\n\nGwen told Will that she needed to be alone, and she left without him. Barbara stopped Will from following Gwen, telling him he needed to leave her alone and that she had to tell him something about Paul.\n\n\nWhen Gwen left, she went to the Hugheses' house. Tom and Margo were talking to Casey about college, and when Gwen walked in, she told them she thought they should know that Billy wasn't her baby and that Craig had switched her baby with Jennifer's baby at birth. That was why the DNA test hadn't proved Casey was the baby's father. She then told them that her baby by Casey was the one who had died.\n\n\nMeg questioned Dusty yet again about whether he might want to get back together with Jennifer since things had changed. He insisted he wouldn't and told her if she didn't stop asking things like that, he'd have to take back the gift he'd bought for her, which was a beautiful necklace. Meg told Dusty she wouldn't always be insecure like that then she got a call from the hospital and had to leave for a while. After she left, Dusty called Jennifer and left a message saying he would stop by the Lakeview to see how she was doing after her visit with Paul.\n\n\nJennifer went to the jail to see Paul and to ask him if it was true that he had kept her from her baby. Paul told her everything that had happened, from Rosanna finding out and trying to tell him, to Craig running her off the road, to Paul eventually figuring out that the babies had been switched and going to see Craig in jail to try to confirm it. Jennifer didn't want to hear his excuses that he had been trying to protect her from Craig, saying it was really all about Paul and Craig and about Paul and Rosanna.\n\n\nJennifer asked Paul how long he had known then she realized that he'd known as far back as when he'd found out that Rosanna had gone into a deeper coma, which meant he'd known her baby was alive since August. Jennifer also realized that Emily had known for some time about the switch. Paul asked what he could do to make things right, but Jennifer told him she was done with him and that he was no longer her brother then she left.\n\n\nA bailiff arrived to take Paul to his arraignment, and as he left the cell, Will stormed up, grabbed Paul, and said, \"You did this! You!\"\n\n\nJennifer arrived back at the Lakeview, crying and fumbling for her keys. When Dusty walked up behind her, she fell into his arms, sobbing.\n\n\n",
