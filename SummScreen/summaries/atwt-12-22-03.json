When Jennifer reminds Barbara of the restraining order, Barbara tells her, \"Hal and his watchdogs are all at the funeral.\"  When Barbara sends Will off to get her a cup of coffee, Jennifer tells Barbara that the police found a vial of presumed poison in Dusty's hotel room.  Barbara, relieved, says that she hopes that now the police will no longer suspect Paul.  Will walks up just in time to hear and asks, \"Is Paul in trouble?\"  Barbara smiles her fake smile and lies, \"No, honey, your brother is in the clear.\"  Suddenly, Barbara jumps up and leaves.  Poor Will looks confused and distressed, as usual.\n\n\nAt the police station, Hal discusses finding the vial of poison in Dusty's room with Jessica and Dusty. Jessica demands that Hal either change Dusty or release him, so Hal leaves the station with Jessica and Dusty, warning Dusty not to leave town.  James Stenbeck is escorted into the station by two prison guards, who are immediately dismissed.  Jack frees James' hands and, right in the middle of the police station, Jack questions James about his talk with Paul before Rose's murder.  James tells Jack that he advised Paul to act like an man and kill Rose, and that Paul agreed. When Jack asks James if he himself had arranged for Rose's murder, James tells Jack, \"Poison's not my style....My son finally came through.\"  James further tells Jack that Paul intended to ask Rose about the night before the wedding, to see if she would tell him the truth, which she obviously did not.  When Jack asks James if he will take a polygraph test, James smiles and answers, \"Absolutely.\"  The polygraph shows that James was telling the truth when he said that he believed that Paul killed Rose.  Barbara arrives at the police station, to find James alone in the main room, with one officer in the background reading a file.  She begs James not to accuse their son, but James says, \"I told the truth - and I think that Paul will be gone for a long, long time.\"\n\n\nCurtis meets Ben at Al's Diner before their appointment with the headmaster of Oakdale Latin.  Curtis is not dressed appropriately and insists to Ben that he doesn't want to attend Oakdale Latin because it is full of \"stuck-up trust fund babies.\"  Ben finally understands that Curtis was smoking pot in the quad of his last school because he wanted to be expelled.  Curtis tells Ben that the school was all Ben's idea, and that Curtis was miserable there and didn't fit in.  Curtis asks Ben that from now on he would like for them to make decisions about Curtis' future together.  Curtis leaves and Jessica arrives.  Jessica advises Ben to listen to Curtis, and that all Curtis wants is to be at home and to be included.  They get ready to leave the diner when Troy rushes up to them and frantically tells them that Sarah has run away from the Center.\n\n\nHolden, Aaron, and Luke are ready to leave for Rose's funeral when Lily walks in wearing her bathrobe and announces that she is not going to the funeral.  Lucinda arrives and convinces Holden that they should go without Lily.  At home, Lily picks up a picture of herself and Rose, then walks over and opens a box of Rose's belongings.\n\n\nThe first to arrive at the church for the funeral are Iva and Joe.  Next Bob and Kim arrive with Nancy and Emma, followed by Dr. Walker Daniels.  Then Paul walks in, whereupon Joe runs up to him and demands, \"You get out!\"  Bob, supporting Joe, also asks Paul to leave.  When Joe explodes, \"You're a lyin' murderer just like your old man!\"  Paul responds in a dead voice, \"I loved her,\" then he leaves, passing Craig and a distressed Rosanna.  \n\n\nHal arrives a the church and finds Emily and Carly, who asks where Jack is.  Hal will not give them a direct answer, but both women agree that Hal does not seem to be following up on their suspicions about Mitzi.  Emily asks Lucinda if she has the financial books on Rose's Roller Palace, and she and Carly tell Lucinda that they suspect Mitzi of poisoning Rose to keep Rose from pressing charges.  Lucinda tells them that she has the books and agrees to show the books to Emily and Carly after the funeral.\n\n\nLucinda, Holden, and Luke arrive and try to explain Lily's absence to everyone.  \n\n\nAaron sees Lucy and starts toward her as Craig looms up behind her. Just then Alison and Susan come up behind Aaron, and immediately Susan leaves to pay her respects to Iva and Joe.  Alison asks Aaron, \"Does everyone still hate us?\"  Aaron glances around at Lucy, who looks down at the floor, and answers, \"Oh, yeah.  But I have a lead on a new apartment.\"  They agree to tell everyone that they are moving in together after the service.  \n\n\nKatie and Mike come into the funeral, and Katie is overwhelmed by her emotions, telling Mike that her earliest memory was the funeral of her father, Casey.\n\n\nThe mourners, one by one, place roses on the rose-covered casket, as \"A Hymn to Love\" plays in the background and each person remembers his or her special time with Rose.  The minister walks up to the lectern and begins the service when Lily arrives, dressed as Rose.  Lily is wearing a long red sequined dress, a red feather boa, a sequined turban crowned by massive red plumes, and is carrying a boom box which is playing loud jazz.  Lily announces, \"None of you knew my sister at all if you think this is what she wants!\"  With a huge smile on her face, she looks around the assemblage.  Lucinda tries to hustle Lily out, but Lily insists that Rose loved life.  She starts the music again and tries, ineffectively, to get everyone to get up and dance.  Dusty, fresh from the police station, walks into the back of the church and tells Lily, \"I'll dance with you.\"  After a moment's hesitation, Lily attacks Dusty, screaming, \"You put her in that box!  You did it!\"  When Hal intervenes, Dusty protests that Paul was the one who poisoned Rose, then leaves the church.  Holden picks Lily up in his arms and carries her outside, leaving the congregation dazed.\n\n\nPaul goes to Rose's Roller Palace and places a briefcase on the counter.  He takes out a picture of Rose, a red rose, and makes a circle of red candles, which he lights, effectively building an altar to Rose.  He recalls loving moments and tells Rose, \"It's just you and me,\"  musing that it is appropriate that he mourn her alone, since the two of them had always been alone, with so many people objecting to their union.  He apologizes for losing faith in her and promises her that he didn't kill her.  Jack and another officer arrive at the Roller Palace to find the shrine Paul has constructed to Rose, and they take Paul to the station.  The officer symbolically blows out the candles that surround Rose's picture.\n\n\n",
