Emily was grateful until Susan expressed her disbelief that Emily was still planning to marry Paul. Susan couldn't believe Emily would choose Paul if it came to a choice between him and her own son, but Emily told Susan she wouldn't abandon Paul to please anyone, including Susan.\n\n\nKeith showed up at the Snyder farm with gifts, and a chill quickly settled over the room, particularly after Holden walked in with Faith and Natalie. Holden went to the barn to finish wrapping presents, Keith went upstairs to read to the girls, and Lily followed Holden to the barn. Holden told Lily that all she owed anyone was the truth, and Lily admitted then that she loved Holden and always would. They kissed, and Luke, who had just arrived, drunk, saw them kissing. When Keith approached the barn, Luke told him he should go on in and get a surprise. Keith lectured Luke about drinking after having had a kidney transplant, but the lecture fell on deaf ears. After Luke left, Keith walked up to the barn door.\n\n\nBack at Emma's house, Dusty helped Faith find a picture she had drawn and put away in a drawer, but several other things fell out of the drawer, and Dusty saw that one of them was a boarding pass for a flight Meg had taken to Tampa the same day that Jennifer and he were there.\n\n\nBarbara went to the jail to visit Paul. She told him that Jennifer had said she couldn't be around Barbara if she was going to support Paul after all he'd done to her, so Barbara had come to say goodbye to Paul. Paul gave her grief for choosing one child over the other, but Barbara was not apologetic about the situation, believing that it was all Paul's doing. She told Paul he was all alone now, but Emily walked up and said he wasn't alone.\n\n\nBarbara left, and Emily told Paul she thought she knew a way to get him out of jail, and then they could get married like they had planned.\n\n\nAt the church at Luther's Corners, Jennifer, Johnny, and Kim had arrived for the Christmas Eve service, and then Gwen and Will walked in. Gwen wanted to leave, but Jennifer said they needed to talk first about the baby, and she thanked Gwen for taking such good care of him and assured Gwen that she could see the baby any time she wanted to. Gwen said she didn't think she was ready for that, and Jennifer decided to take Johnny and go home, so Gwen could have some peace at the church. Kim approached Gwen and got her to sit down with her and Will. After the service, Gwen went up to the nativity scene, then she told a stunned Will, \"I want to have a baby with you.\"\n\n\n",
