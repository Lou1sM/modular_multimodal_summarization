At the WOAK telethon, BJ has planted a bomb that will go off when the red temperature indicator goes over the top. An oblivious Katie emcees the event, where Tom and Lisa sing a duet and Barbara does a solo. BJ slips off to the wine cellar where he torments Henry, telling him that Katie will get what's coming to her while Olga takes care of Henry, permanently. Desperate, Henry seduces Olga into one more tryst and while they claw at each other's clothes, Henry gets the handcuffs and slaps them on Olga. Henry then flees Fairwinds in Olga's clothes and sets off to rescue Katie. Meanwhile, despite Maddie's attempts to keep him away, Mike is stunned to see Katie and BJ together at the telethon. He flips out and flees the hospital. Meanwhile, Jack admits to Carly that though he's singing in the telethon at Kim's behest, his real concern is BJ. Carly wants to go along and hear Jack sing but Jack warns her of the dangers. Carly suspects the real reason is that Jack is too embarrassed to want her there and promises not to show up. Later, Carly calls Kim and asks her if she can volunteer to answer phones. On her way, Carly gets a flat tire and a mysterious motorcycle driver stops to help her fix it. Carly takes an immediate dislike to him when he tries to flirt with her but later, he oddly appears at WOAK. Also at WOAK, Katie and Jack are surprised to see each other. As they argue over whether BJ poses a real threat, the man himself arrives back from Fairwinds and Jack quickly catches on that something is going on. When Mike shows up, he and Jack both start to snoop around, but Jack is called on-stage by Katie to sing his song. Afterwards, he and Mike find the bomb, just as BJ presents Katie with the final check that will push the red indicator over the top! Jack tells Mike he has to stop Katie from pulling the lever but it's then that BJ pulls a gun on them.\n\n\n",
