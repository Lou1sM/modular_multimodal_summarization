Stephanie tells Brooke that Storm is a danger especially as it appears he put a lot of thought into shooting her and framing his father. She worries about what will happen if he gets upset with her again or Ridge if he leaves Brooke or Eric if he breaks it off with Donna so she tells Brooke no. Frustrated, Brooke tells Stephanie that she gave her word that she would do anything for her forgiveness and all she wants is to save her family.\n\n\nBrooke tells Stephanie that Storm is not a danger, he needs help but he won't get what he needs in prison. She informs her that Storm wanted to confess but Brooke wouldn't let him. Stephanie doesn't want to put her life or the lives of her family members at risk. She tells Brooke to go home, say goodbye to Storm, have him get his affairs in order and turn himself in or she will. Upset, Brooke grabs her purse and leaves saying, \"Why did I think you would ever do anything for anyone but yourself?!\" \n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Storm is reading the paper as Donna is anxiously pacing, worrying about what is taking Brooke so long. Storm expresses concern over Brooke obstructing justice by going to Stephanie and that he's turning his sisters into criminals.  The doorbell rings and Donna opens it to find Eric standing there holding an envelope. Storm leaves the room to give them privacy and Eric tells Donna he's bringing Stephanie the divorce papers.  Donna is thrilled but worries about the timing as Eric looks puzzled.\n\n\nEric asks Donna if she doesn't want him to divorce Stephanie and she ends up telling him that Brooke is over there with her trying to make peace. Eric thinks the timing is good as Stephanie will be in a good mood but Donna tells him it's about Stephen's case so she's not sure. They both agree that no matter what happens with the case, it won't get in the way of their relationship. Eric asks Donna to meet him at Forrester Creations after, kisses her and heads over to Stephanie's.\n\n\nKatie and Donna are worrying about Brooke when she walks in and breaks the bad news. She's upset that after all the lies Stephanie has told that she couldn't tell one more. Katie is relieved that at least they didn't lose anything by trying and Brooke is forced to tell them she let it slip that Storm shot her. Crying, Brooke tells them about her conversation with Stephanie and Storm walks in. Having heard the conversation he sadly hugs Katie and tells them they should break out the champagne and get his bon voyage party started.\n\n\nBrooke walks over and hugs Storm; apologizing for telling Stephanie the truth. Storm isn't worried about it as he was going to turn himself in anyway. He tells them that they will be fine; they don't need to be together to be the family they were meant to be. He feels he is ready to take responsibility and everyone has forgiven him and that is all he needs. Brooke and Donna offer to take him but he tells Brooke to be with her kids and Donna to be with Eric. He tells them that Katie can take him and that he doesn't want to say goodbye at the police station. As they leave, Donna breaks down crying in Brooke's arms.\n\n\nStephanie lets Eric into the Mansion and after some small talk; she asks what he's holding. Eric tells her she knows already and Stephanie's face drops and she takes a step back. She tells him she thought he was happy at Christmas and he tells her he is sorry if he gave her the wrong impression. He says how he will always be happy at the house as it holds a lot of memories for him but it is time for him to move on. Stephanie realizes that he is going to marry Donna. She tells him she can't do this right now so he puts the papers on the coffee table and leaves.\n\n\nAt a loss, Stephanie walks around the living room, stops to look at the family pictures and reminisces about happier times with Eric. She calls Brooke and finds out Storm has left for the police station and tells Brooke to stop him. She asks her if she meant it when she said she'd do anything for her family and Brooke says she did. Stephanie tells her that maybe there is a way they can help each other, she's on her way over.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Stephanie and Ridge discuss how depressed Eric is. Stephanie tells Ridge that they may be able to get Forrester Creations back and informs him that Jackie was a prostitute. Ridge is thrilled and feels they can blackmail Nick, but Stephanie is concerned that it could cause Taylor to lose her job. Taylor pulls away from Nick and explains the kiss away as gratitude for her help, although Nick doesn't quite see it that way. Taylor wonders if Nick will sign the company back to Eric, but he says he isn't yet ready. Jackie later yells at Taylor for bringing up her past. Jackie accuses Taylor of making Nick hate her. Stephanie confronts Nick with legal documents to transfer the ownership of the company. Nick refuses to sign them and burns them in the fireplace. She leaves with a warning that nobody gets the better of Stephanie Forrester.\n",
    "yt": "\n\nTaylor tells Nick that he caught her off guard with their kiss. Taylor and Nick reflect back on the night (a long time ago) when they were both drinking and they almost got together and agree it was a very vulnerable time for both of them. When Taylor asks him about selling back Forrester Creations, he tells her he doesn\u2019t want to sell back without turning a profit first. Stephanie tells Ridge that Jackie was a prostitute and if Nick doesn\u2019t sell back the company soon she will blackmail him with this information to get it back. Taylor arrives to inform Stephanie that Nick will sell back the Forrester soon but he\u2019s not ready to now. Stephanie is too impatient to wait and decides to confront Nick. She goes to Nick\u2019s house and presents him with a sales contract for him to sign but he refuses. Stephanie informs him that he\u2019s made a big mistake. Jackie is angry with Taylor for opening Nick\u2019s old wounds. She is afraid that now Nick won\u2019t be able to see her in the same way again.",
    "imdb": "\nRidge and Stefanie worry Eric shows little enthusiasm for his new fashion company. He learns what she overheard about Nick. Taylor pussyfoots around Nick's kiss and tries again to make him sell Forester Creations, in vain so far. Brished off by Taylor, Stefanie goes press Nick, who now feels betrayed by Taylor, to sell back. When Nicke refuses, she promises he'll regret it 'when your world comes crushing down'. Jacqui complains Taylor's sessions destroyed her bond with Nick.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge is beyond shocked when Stephanie tells him that Jackie was a prostitute and turned tricks when Nick was small and now he's devastated that Taylor helped him remember this. This is too good to be true. Nick blackmailed them to get the company and now they are in position to do the same. Stephanie hedges; she wants to do this but she doesn't want Taylor to lose her license over it. Nick kisses Taylor and then both proceed to try to minimize the situation as just a transference in patient/doctor type of thing over intimate matters. She states it is nothing romantic or sexual, but not sure Nick believes that. Stephanie calls Taylor just as she reaches home. Taylor tells her that Nick needs more time; he's not quite there yet with selling them back the company. She barely hangs up and is on her way upstairs to Thorne when Jackie barges in railing at her for her ruined relationship with her son, for what Taylor was able to get out of him. Taylor is sympathetic and vows that he is angry and mad now, but he will deal with it in time as he does love her. Jackie states that she has to believe that; he is her whole world. Stephanie also has a late night visit \u0096 with Nick. She says Taylor has held up her end of the bargain and she is hoping he will too. Slyly he grins when she holds up the sale's contract. He tears it up and throws it in the fireplace and tells \"Toots\" that it ain't gonna happen. It will be one cold day in Hell before he gives her anything. She warns him that was a mistake and he will remember this moment when his world comes crashing down around him, both he and his mother. One parting word, \"nobody gets the better of me, Nick, nobody!\"",
