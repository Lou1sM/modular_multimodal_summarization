    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Rick met with Maya at the sky lounge to tell her that his lawyer was on the way. Though Eric hadn't given Rick all he'd asked for, Rick was glad to have a year to prove himself as CEO. Maya was excited that he'd have a year with her and could end the charade with Caroline. Rick left, saying he'd text-message Maya when it was done.\n\n\nLater, Othello arrived at Maya's request. She informed him that Rick's plan was happening as they spoke. Maya nervously tapped away on her phone and explained that Rick had to get Eric's signature on the papers before anyone caught on. Othello didn't know how Maya didn't have a problem with what Rick was doing to Caroline. \"Do I think he could do that to me?\" she knowingly asked.\n\n\nOthello rephrased and asked why Maya was nervous if she thought Eric would comply. Maya claimed that she and Rick weren't liars. She and Rick never hid what they wanted, and because she always kept it real, she doubted she could keep up the charade for another day. Her phone beeped, and she had to go; however, she said not to worry because once Rick called her, she and Rick would emerge as \"The Future Mr. and Mrs. Eric Forrester Jr, CEO of Forrester Creations.\"\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Ridge tried to convince Caroline that Rick was up to something with the papers Rick wanted Eric to sign. Caroline felt that if absolute control would make Rick more confident and secure, then Eric should give it to Rick.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Eric bade goodbye to the retiring Gordon. Gordon left, and Carter arrived to advise Eric that a year was a very long time to hand over power to Rick, especially if something went wrong. Resolved, Eric said he was leaving town with his brother and needed to act upon it. Carter stressed that once Eric signed it, no one could contradict Rick's ultimate power, not even Eric.\n\n\nRick arrived with his attorney, ready to sign the papers. Carter said that Rick shouldn't expect an immediate answer, and Rick asked what he hadn't done or said to convince Eric. Carter interjected that he, Forrester's counsel, had to caution Eric and Rick about the long-term ramifications of the proposal.\n\n\nRick asserted that he was already CEO and needed to be focused. He wanted security and no interference from Ridge while Eric was away. Eric looked at the papers again, and Carter slipped a text message to Ridge to say that Rick was making his move.\n\n\nRick explained that Ridge could undermine Rick's decisions and cause gridlock. Eric said Ridge didn't want that any more than Rick did. Rick asked what would happen if Ridge disrupted things and Eric wasn't there to remind Ridge who was in charge. Rick noted that Eric had taken the position away from Ridge after a couple days, and Rick merely wanted to carry out his own vision, unimpeded.\n\n\nConfident that Caroline and Rick were the future of Forrester, Eric leaned over the desk and signed the papers. Just then, Ridge and Caroline barreled into the office. Ridge announced that he knew about Rick's papers, but Rick gloated that it was too late -- they'd already been signed.\n\n\nOutside the door, Pam eavesdropped on the meeting. Ivy asked what was going on. All Pam knew was that half the company was in there arguing, and Rick's attorney was in there. Ivy asked if the argument was about work or something else. Pam couldn't tell and asked what Ivy thought. Ivy said she was trying not to think about it at all.\n\n\nIvy left in search of Maya but found Othello in the sky lounge. She threw a barrage of questions at him about Rick and Maya, but Othello only shrugged in response. Ivy believed something was happening between Rick and Maya, and Othello said it was complicated. Ivy deduced that Othello knew something, but when he played dumb, she revealed that she knew about Rick and Maya.\n\n\nIvy asked if the affair was still going on, and Othello's eye rolls and shrugs told Ivy that it was. Angry, Ivy said that he needed to tell her if Maya and Rick were planning something that would hurt Ivy's friend, Caroline, and Ivy would put an end to it.\n\n\nBack at Pam's desk, Maya was about to enter the CEO's office, but Pam stopped her from interrupting the meeting. Maya decided to wait in a chair. Pam tried to politely get rid of Maya, who said that Pam could do what she had to do, but Maya wasn't leaving.\n\n\nBack in the office, Ridge refused to let the papers leave the building, but Eric stated that it was signed and done. Caroline thanked Eric, and Rick's lawyer left with the paperwork. Eric explained that Rick would have the security he needed to run the company for a year.\n\n\nRidge argued that Eric had given Rick carte blanche. Caroline declared that Rick wouldn't hurt the company. Eric stated that Caroline and Rick were reunited, and Eric trusted them to lead the company into the future. Ridge asked what would happen if Rick made a mistake, and Ridge emphasized that Rick had already led Eric into a bad choice that very day.\n\n\nEric said Rick had proved himself and handled a bad situation with maturity. Ridge corrected that Rick had thrown a tantrum. Ridge asked why Rick needed Eric's trust in writing and advised Rick to handle his trust issues on his own. \"This is the exact reason for it, Dad,\" Rick replied.\n\n\nAs Caroline continued to advocate for Rick, Rick secretly messaged Maya to prepare to enter the meeting. Ridge didn't like that no one could tell Rick what to do. Rick said he wasn't going to run the company alone, and Eric stated that Forrester had always been a team effort. Rick asserted that it wouldn't change, and Forrester had always had a history of strong couples.\n\n\nCaroline grinned as Rick declared that he'd continue the tradition, and the biggest thing he'd learned over the last months was the value of a great partner. He claimed that he couldn't have done it without \"her,\" someone who'd been trustworthy and loyal to him. Caroline thanked him; however, everyone's heads turned when Maya entered and said Rick had asked to see her.\n\n\nBack outside the office, Othello strolled up as Pam continued eavesdropping at the office door. He asked what was happening. Pam conveyed that Rick had gotten Eric to sign some papers, and Ridge was upset about it. Pam believed it was a big deal and noted that most of the staff was in there, including Maya, who'd just entered after getting a text message from Rick.\n\n\nPam noticed that Othello didn't seem surprised and questioned why he was there. He claimed to have stopped by because he had a gig in town that evening. Her eyes lit up, and she insisted that he knew something. He decided to return later, but Pam said he'd told him what she knew. He revealed that big changes were about to happen, and he was kind of looking forward to them.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Eric told Maya that it wasn't the time. Ignoring him, Maya said she'd gotten Rick's text. Carter and Ridge tried to usher her out, but Rick said he wanted her to hear what he was saying. Caroline decided that she did, too, and said she was just thanking Rick for his kind words.\n\n\nMaya asked what Rick had said, and Rick stated that he'd just gotten irrevocable control as CEO for a year. Maya congratulated him. He discussed everyone working as a team while Eric was away, and she said she'd do what he needed. Rick added that he wouldn't be working alone, and he'd need a partner who'd be there celebrating with him and helping him overcome challenges.\n\n\nCaroline said she looked forward to being there as Rick's wife and partner. Rick told Caroline that he wasn't talking about her; he was talking about Maya. Caroline, Ridge, Carter, and Eric looked shocked as Rick said the cat was out of the bag -- he and Maya were still together. Caroline exclaimed that she and Rick were married, but Rick said the marriage had ended the day she'd betrayed him with Ridge. Standing by Maya, Rick said he'd share the company and his life with Maya. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Maya waits at the Sky Lounge for Rick. He tells her that his lawyer should be there shortly. His dad will sign the papers and he has a year to prove himself. He says he will text her as soon as it is done. She is so excited. Ridge tells Caroline that he doesn't know why but Rick is up to something. He still is not touching Caroline and yet he is trying to convince his dad they are back together and will be a team to lead FC into the future. Caroline says if it makes Rick more confident and secure then she thinks Eric should give it to him. Before Carter comes in to see Eric, Eric wishes Gordon a good retirement and thanks him for making them look so good for so many years. Carter wants to make sure Eric is happy with his decision. Eric says it is only for one year. Carter says he knows and if all goes well, fine but if not, then a year is a very long time. He's giving Rick all the power and no one will be able to contradict him, not even Eric. Eric says he is leaving town with his brother so he needs to act on this now. Rick walks in with his attorney and wants to get started right away. Rick pretends he does not understand. Is there something his dad needs to hear from him first. Eric says no. Rick says good. He is already CEO so this just gives him more confidence that Ridge won't interfere while his dad is away. If Ridge interferes the company could become a gridlock. He just needs to know he has his dad's full support and trust. Eric says he does. He and Caroline are the future of this company and if he ever doubted that he doesn't anymore. While still in the room Carter texts Ridge who in turn tells Caroline that Rick is making his move now. He and Caroline head straight for Eric's office where Pam tries to block the door saying they are in a meeting. Othello shows up per Maya's request and asks what is going on. She says it is finally happening. Rick and his attorney are down with Eric right now. Rick can not play Caroline's happy husband forever so their plan has to work. Eric takes the pen Rick is holding and signs the papers. Ridge busts in but Rick tells him it is too late. The papers have been signed. Maya tells Othello that he knows her. She is not a liar and neither is Rick so she does not like to hide like this even for one more day. This is their future. They had to delay it a little bit but today it could happen. She says she has to go but she will text him. After today they can come out as Mr. and Mrs. Rick Forrester Jr. CEO of FC. Ivy catches Pam doing her best to eavesdrop at the door and joins in. All Pam can tell her is there is a meeting with Eric, Rick and his attorney and Caroline and Ridge just barged in. About all they can hear is that Ridge is not very happy and is arguing with Rick. Pam thinks Ivy seems to know more than she is saying. Ivy says she is trying hard not to think about it at all. Rick asks his lawyer if all seems to be in order and the attorney says yes. Eric tells Ridge there is no need to get upset with this as he has signed the papers and all are in order. Caroline thanks Eric. He tells Ridge that he had plenty of time to think about this and he is satisfied with this decision. Ridge argues that he just gave him carte blanche even if it just for a year. Caroline says Rick is not going to do anything to hurt the company. Eric says Caroline and Rick are back together and are going to lead this company into the future and he suggests that Ridge accept that and do the same. Ridge still argues that Rick is already CEO so why is he pushing for this now. Ivy looks for Maya but finds Othello. She says Caroline is her friend and if something is going to happen today in that meeting he needs to tell her so she can warn Caroline. She needs to go into that meeting and end it. Maya shows up and attempts to go into Rick's office. Pam stops her and says she will buzz her when they are done. Maya chooses to just wait in a nearby chair. Pam tells her nicely that if Maya wasn't invited then this does not concern her. Maya says okay, Pam can just do what she needs to do and Maya won't bother her. But she is not going anywhere. Ridge still argues that something is not right. Eric says Rick has proven himself to him. Caroline adds everyone is getting along and working together now. He's had some problems in the past but he's handled this with a great deal of maturity. Ridge says Rick had a tantrum and that is maturity? Eric says this is over. It's signed, sealed and delivered. Ridge tells his dad it's not just the papers. He can't put his finger on it, but something is not right. Rick texts Maya and tells her to be ready to come in. Caroline tries to argue that Rick is doing a good job and it will be a team effort. Eric agrees, FC has never been about one person leading it, it's always been a team effort. Rick stands up and says and that won't change. He says FC has always been about strong couples beginning with Eric and Stephanie and he intends to keep that tradition. If he has learned anything lately is that he needs a strong partner. He pushes the button for Maya to come in. He continues that he could not have done this without her. Someone he trusts and is completely loyal to him. Caroline thanks him for saying that and says she is so proud to be his partner. Maya comes in and Caroline, Eric and Ridge try to excuse her as they are in a meeting. Rick says she can stay. He would like her to hear this. He explains that his dad signed the papers and he will be leading FC forward as CEO for one year but not alone. He's going to need a partner a person who is loyal to him and be there for him through it all, helping him celebrate every success and overcome every challenge. Caroline beams. She says as his wife and his partner he can count on her. He drops the bomb. He was not referring to her but Maya. She is stunned. He says the cat is out of the bag. He and Maya are still together. His marriage to Caroline is over. It was the day she betrayed him with Ridge. He walks past her to stand behind Maya and says Maya is the one he will be sharing his life with and they will be running the company. Caroline is stunned and everyone else's chins almost hit the floor.",
