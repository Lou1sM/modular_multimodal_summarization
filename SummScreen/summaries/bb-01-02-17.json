    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the cliff house, a romantic time in bed turned into a debate about Steffy living with Liam while still married to Wyatt. Steffy said it was out of respect for Eric and her new CEO position and would be just until the divorce was final. She assured Liam that he was the one she wanted a life with. \"Just stay then. Tell me you're not leaving me,\" he replied.\n\n\nSteffy hated to put Liam though it. Liam said it was Quinn doing it and using Eric to accomplish it. Steffy stated that her grandfather didn't feel as if he was being used, and he definitely wasn't pressuring her. \"But he is pressuring you,\" Liam countered.\n\n\nSteffy contended that Eric was just looking out for her and wanted what was best for her in her new role as CEO. Liam wanted the same things, but he said it wasn't the nineteenth century. In Liam's view, she was getting a divorce, therefore, she was not cheating. He felt that no one would stand in judgment of it. She replied that it wasn't Eric's point.\n\n\nLiam knew that Eric was concerned about appearances, which seemed strange to Liam if he considered the number of divorces and scandals the family had undergone through the years. Liam didn't consider his relationship to be a scandal because they'd been ripped apart by a malicious woman and stood the chance of the same woman doing it all over again. He asserted that they couldn't keep letting Quinn do it to them.\n\n\nIn the living room later, the conversation continued. Liam assumed she'd made up her mind. Steffy said she hadn't decided anything, but she hadn't been comfortable with moving while married from the onset. It was why she hadn't done it right away. Liam believed that being sensitive to Wyatt had been the right thing to do back then. Steffy countered that \"this\" might be the right thing, too.\n\n\nLiam asserted that nothing was right about it, and Quinn was still pulling strings. Steffy said the move would just be until the divorce was final. He asked if Steffy really thought that they'd ever get their life together when Quinn was working overtime to keep Steffy with Wyatt. Liam stated that Quinn had brainwashed Eric and was using the CEO position to turn Steffy and Liam against each other.\n\n\nSteffy said she wouldn't let it happen, but Liam replied that it was happening at that very moment. He believed that Quinn would keep poking and prodding until the divorce didn't happen.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn limped in from work. The incident in the steam room with Ridge was still heavy on her mind. Eric entered and warmly greeted her. He sensed that she wasn't herself and asked if something had happened. She asked why he'd think that. He said they hadn't known each other long; however, she was his wife, and he could read her well.\n\n\nIntrigued that Eric thought so, Quinn asked what she was thinking at that moment. \"After you tell me what happened at the office today,\" he replied. He wondered if Ridge was giving her a hard time. Eric was aware that Ridge had been helpful with her ankle but wondered if Ridge was back to his old tricks -- or had found a new way to get at her. Quinn jokingly assured Eric that his eldest son was putty in her hands.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Wyatt and Steffy. Quinn was concerned that Steffy worked all day with Wyatt but went home to Liam. Eric conveyed that he'd talked to Steffy to let her know how inappropriate he thought shacking up with her husband's brother was. Quinn was surprised that Eric had broached it with Steffy. Eric affirmed it, saying that Wyatt was perfect for Steffy.\n\n\nEric believed that Wyatt admired Steffy and respected her skills and talents -- unlike Liam, who acted as if he felt that way when he didn't. Wyatt was a stand-up guy in Eric's eyes, but Liam had caused heartache and was unreliable. Wyatt, on the other hand, stood by his promises and made the marriage one that Eric could support.\n\n\nHugging him, Quinn called Eric a dear man whom she didn't deserve. She wondered if Steffy could be loyal to her marriage as well as to the family and business. Eric said he'd given Steffy a lot to think about. He hoped he'd gotten through to her. Deciding to find out, Eric whipped out his phone to call Steffy.\n\n\nAs Eric and Steffy greeted each other, Eric heard Liam in the background and asked her to turn on the phone's speaker. Liam sighed in frustration as Eric said that Steffy and Liam were good people, but they knew it was wrong for Steffy to live with Liam before the divorce was final. Eric stated that once it was final, Liam and Steffy could do whatever they wanted; however, until then, they needed to respect Wyatt and the institution of marriage.\n\n\nEric told Steffy to move out. \"Do you understand, Steffy? Liam? Do you understand?\" Eric authoritatively asked. Liam attempted to reason with Eric but spoke to air because Eric had already clicked off the line. Liam was beside himself with frustration. He understood Eric's place in Steffy's life but said Eric had no right to keep making demands like that. Liam screamed that it wasn't a casual fling between him and Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy empathized with Liam but said she'd promised to listen to Eric and respect his opinions. Liam replied that listening was fine, but Eric wasn't really doing the talking. Liam believed that Quinn was. Steffy said that even if it was true, it didn't mean that Eric had no point. Steffy stated that she was married but living with a man who wasn't her husband. She'd had mixed feelings about it from the beginning.\n\n\nIn Steffy's view, all that would change was that she wouldn't be at Liam's house. She'd return to pick up where they left off the moment the divorce was final. It was her vow to Liam. She kissed him and said she'd have someone get her things.\n\n\nLiam was despondent. Steffy apologized and asked him not to doubt her love. Steffy gave him a long look back as she strode out the door. On the porch, she sobbed. Inside, Liam shed tears.\n\n\nIn the design office, Brooke entered, giggling, which snapped Ridge out of thought. She was amused at the babysitting R.J., who'd said he didn't do lullabies when she'd suggested that he sing Lizzy to sleep. Brooke cupped Ridge's neck in her hand and kissed him. She noticed that his hair was damp. He said he'd taken a steam. She teasingly asked if he'd been alone or with someone that she knew.\n\n\nRidge claimed it had been a spontaneous thing. Lightly tickling her hands over him, Brooke said he should have asked her to join him and advised him not to forget her the next time. She asked how the steam had been. He replied that it had had its moments. Brooke eyed him curiously.\n\n\nRidge indicated that he was behind with work because of it, and his daughter ran a tight ship. Brooke wondered if Steffy was still at work then asked if Quinn was. Nervously, Ridge asked if Brooke was asking if he'd seen Quinn. Seeming perplexed by his question, Brooke shrugged and asked, \"Have you?\"\n\n\nLater, Brooke was fiddling with jewelry when Ridge asked her opinion of a sketch. She liked it but noticed he'd sketched in a necklace of Quinn's. He said it went with the dress. Brooke asked if he was complimenting Quinn, and he replied that he was trying to throw Quinn off balance. Brooke believed it would take more than nice words to rid them of Quinn. He replied that he had a few things up his sleeve. \"Do I dare ask?\" Brooke wondered.\n\n\n\"Nope. You don't want to know,\" Ridge replied. Brooke stated that she'd always believed in Ridge, but she was pretty sure Quinn and Eric wouldn't reverse themselves on the CEO pick. Ridge said the thing about life was that one never knew what might be around the corner.\n\n\nCiting that Ridge hadn't fared well the last time he'd gone up against Quinn, Brooke suggested that he just let Quinn self-destruct. Brooke's next thought was that self-destructing could take a long time. \"Or not, depending upon how it plays out,\" Ridge replied. She asked what he was up to. All he said was that he had to protect the family and company at all costs. Whatever it took, he had to get Quinn out of their lives.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was working alone in the design office when Liam called, upset that Steffy had moved out. Liam said Eric and Quinn had played on Steffy's emotions and guilt-tripped her into staying elsewhere until the divorce was final. Liam wanted to do something about Quinn right that instant. Ridge replied that he was on it and had been in the steam room with Quinn.\n\n\nLiam assumed that Ridge was referring to his cat-and-mouse game with Quinn and asked if Ridge thought something would really happen. Ridge said he'd make sure it did. Liam wondered if Ridge would do so even if it meant betraying his father. Ridge replied that it was fine -- if it was what it took to open Eric's eyes.\n\n\nRidge said that, when he was done, Eric would want nothing to do with Quinn. Liam stated that Eric might not want to have anything to do with Ridge either. Ridge stated that it was a risk he was willing to take to rid everyone of Quinn.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Quinn was in a nightgown, pulling back the bed covers, when she received a message from Ridge. He wrote that she'd been right, and they needed to stay far away from each other. \"Ok,\" Quinn typed back. Quinn stood pensively with the phone in her hand.\n\n\nEric entered and decided to take a shower. Quinn climbed into bed and stared at Ridge's message and her reply on her phone. After putting the phone aside, she lay her head on a pillow.\n\n\nIn Quinn's mind played a montage of Ridge's confusing behavior toward her. Over the montage played her voice, telling Ridge that he didn't get to play with her emotions. Quinn's twitched and gasped as if awaking from a disquieting dream.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Quinn is feeling immense guilt for her recent flirtation with Ridge, especially after learning about Eric's attempt to get Steffy and Wyatt back together.

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tells Steffy that he can't believe her grandfather told her to move out on Liam. They know there is more to it than that, so she can tell him she is not leaving. He cannot dictate her love life. Quinn limps home and Eric greets his lovely wife but says she is not herself, so what happened. Brooke kisses Ridge and feels that his hair is damp. He says he took a steam. She wonders if it was alone. He says it was a spur of the moment thing. She says he could have included her so do not forget that next time. Eric says they have not been married that long but he can read her pretty well. Something is not fine and he wonders if Ridge is giving her a hard time. Has he found a new way to get to her? Liam tells Steffy this is ridiculous considering the long list of scandals all the Forrester's have had. And this is not a scandal, just two people who love each other and want to be together. She is getting a divorce so it is not like she is cheating on Wyatt. Brooke notices that Ridge is using one of Quinn's necklaces with his drawing of one of his gowns. She thinks it will take more than that to get Quinn on his good side. He says he has other tricks up his sleeve too, nothing that he wants to share with her now. Whatever it takes he has to get her out of their lives. Quinn tells Eric that his son is putty or something like that in her hands. Eric says Wyatt is perfect for his granddaughter whereas Liam certainly isn't. He's unreliable while Wyatt is a stand up guy that does what he says he is going to do and that is the man he wants to support. Steffy says she has not made her decision yet but maybe this is the right thing to do temporarily. Liam laments that Quinn has already worked her hammering away on Eric and now she is working on Steffy, surely she sees that. Eric comments to Quinn that he told Steffy what to do and he will call to see if she is going to do that. He wants to put Liam on the speaker phone. Basically he tells Liam that he wants Steffy to move out right away and not disrespect her marriage. He hangs up and Liam goes ballistic that this is not right. Eric does not have that right, and it is not even him. It is all words that came from Quinn. Steffy says she has always had mixed feelings from the beginning. She is still married yet living with another man and it doesn't feel right. She kisses him and says she is sorry but she will be back before he knows it .and never doubt how much she loves him. He looks defeated so pretty sure he is not believing it. He calls Ridge right away and says Steffy moved out. Ridge tells him about Quinn being in the steam room and for the good of the company she has got to go. He calls Quinn at home. She takes the message and replies okay. Eric tells her that he will take a quick shower and be right back. She lies down in bed but panics when she suddenly remembers Ridge touching her leg in the steam room.",
