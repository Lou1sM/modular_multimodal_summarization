Brooke got a sense of satisfaction after recalling that she had seen Taylor and Hector together in Taylor's bedroom. Taylor arrived at Brooke's to find out if Brooke intended to tell Ridge about seeing her and Hector on New Year's Eve. Brooke could not think of a reason to be charitable to Taylor. Brooke reminded Taylor how badly she and Stephanie had treated Brooke; why should Brooke now grant a request from Taylor to not go to Ridge with what she had observed? Brooke reminded Taylor that she came home and wrecked hers and Ridge's marriage and made her children have to live without their father.\n\n\nMeanwhile Dante visited Felicia. He didn't know that she is sill. Felicia was happy to talk with someone who wouldn't be devastated by her death. Felicia told Dante that she is happy that Bridget and Nick will be bringing up her child. Felicia told Dante that Nick was ecstatic over finding out that Dominick is his child.\n\n\nDarla went to talk to Hector at the fire station. She apologized to him for encouraging him to go after a married woman. Hector told Darla he was with Taylor on New Year's Eve and that everyone would find out because Brooke was there and found them together. Hector was hopeful that once Ridge finds out, it might free Taylor for a better life with him. He admitted to Darla that he is very in love with Taylor and intends to pursue her fully.\n\n\nBack at Brooke's, Taylor begged Brooke not to tell Ridge what she saw-besides, Brooke is incorrect in thinking that she is having an affair with Hector. Taylor tried to tell Brooke that she was getting ready for bed after she thought Hector left, then he came upstairs, that is when Brooke saw them. Taylor figured that Brooke would be seeking revenge for Ridge choosing her over Brooke. Taylor begged relentlessly to Brooke to no avail. Brooke appeared to be intent on telling Ridge what she saw, no matter what Taylor did or said.\n\n\n",

Darla goes to Hector to apologise for urging him to chase Taylor. Hector tells Darla about his kiss with Taylor, and how Brooke witnessed everything. Taylor begs Brooke not to interfere in her marriage, but Brooke believes it's payback for Taylor destroying her marriage to Ridge, and leaving her children without a father.\r\n",
