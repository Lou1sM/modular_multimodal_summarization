    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the hospital, Rick asked Caroline if she'd really only fallen at Bill's house. The weak Caroline said she'd stood her ground. She added that she'd been afraid, but Katie swore that Bill wouldn't get violent. Caroline explained that she'd reached out for Bill, he'd pulled his arm away, and she's slipped.\n\n\nThe tense but skeptical Katie asked if that meant that Bill hadn't pushed his niece. Caroline said Bill hadn't, and relief washed over Katie. Bill gently stated that he'd said it had been an accident. Rick still seemed unconvinced. Bill left to look around the corridor for the doctor.\n\n\nRick asked how Caroline felt, and she indicated that she still had a headache. He claimed that she was as beautiful as ever. He gave her a kiss and stepped out of the room.\n\n\nSitting at Caroline's beside, Hope suspected that Caroline and Bill had been arguing over Hope, because Bill couldn't stand the idea that Hope and Liam might reunite. Hope wondered how many more people had to be hurt, but Katie stated that Bill hadn't meant to hurt anyone. Hope bitterly stated that all Bill cared about was keeping Liam and Steffy together, and Hope exited the room.\n\n\nRick located Bill in an unused patient's room elsewhere in the hospital with a paper cup in hand. Rick asserted that Bill had lost control, resulting in the woman Rick loved getting hurt. Bill told Rick that whatever Rick had to say could wait because they needed to focus on Bill's niece. \"Oh, so now she's your family,\" Rick quipped.\n\n\nRick relayed that Caroline had done Bill a courtesy by telling him that she'd encouraged Rick to do the right thing, because it really hadn't even been any of Bill's business. Rick figured that most people would applaud Caroline's convictions, but Bill had deemed her a traitor to her family. Bill claimed that he wasn't most people, and though he understood that Rick was upset and cared for Caroline, Bill refused to allow her boyfriend to lecture him.\n\n\nBill admitted that he'd had a heated argument with Caroline, but he declared that he hadn't pushed her off the balcony. Rick figured that Caroline didn't want Bill to take any blame, but Rick had seen in her eyes that she did blame Bill. Bill replied that Caroline should have listened to him, but Rick said Caroline cared about people too much for that. Because of Caroline's caring heart, Rick decided that he'd let Bill be innocent, as she'd said; however, Rick asked that Bill do them all a favor and stay \"the hell away\" from Caroline. Rick left, and Bill swigged on his drink.\n\n\nIn the corridor later, Hope saw Bill in a chair. She approached him, but he behaved as if she weren't there as he fiddled with his phone. Bill guessed that, like her brother, Hope didn't believe Bill about the fall. Hope replied that she believed he'd wanted to hurt her, not his niece. Bill sardonically quipped that it was so unusual of Hope to make everything all about her.\n\n\nHope stated that Bill had been upset with Caroline about Hope and about what Rick's revelation could do to Liam's relationship with Steffy. Bill explained that Caroline hadn't listened to him when he'd told her to stay out of it. Hope figured Caroline had tried to make Bill see reason, something that was impossible to do when things regarded Liam and Steffy.\n\n\nBill asked if Hope had talked to Caroline's doctor, but Hope said it wasn't her place to do that. Bill sarcastically replied that meant Hope respected boundaries, and that was good because it meant she wouldn't use the lie as an excuse to go after his son again. Hope stated that she and Liam would be together if it hadn't been for the lie, and Caroline hadn't betrayed Bill -- she'd stood up to him.  \"And I know that may feel like the same thing to you, but it's not,\" Hope added.\n\n\nHope figured that Caroline had inspired Rick to be a better person, and if Bill had listened, Caroline could have inspired him, too. Bill seethed that he could never be inspired to let Hope have another crack at his son. Hope decided that Bill just couldn't help himself, but Bill retorted that his position hadn't changed just because Rick didn't have the backbone to stand up to Caroline.\n\n\nHope wondered if Caroline almost dying had changed anything, and the livid Hope warned Bill that he wasn't protecting his family; he was tearing it apart. Hope raged that if Bill had possessed one tolerant bone in his body, then Caroline wouldn't have had an accident, and Hope and Liam would still be together. Though Hope admitted that she'd made mistakes, she said she was determined to have the life she and Liam should have had, and she wouldn't let anyone stand in her way.\n\n\nBack in Caroline's room, Rick returned in time to hear the doctor telling Katie, Brooke, and Caroline the prognosis. Caroline hadn't sustained any trauma to her skull or spine, but she'd suffered a concussion. The doctor had decided to keep Caroline at the hospital for observation and advised that Caroline get mental and physical rest. Rick vowed that they'd all see to it Caroline got plenty of both.\n\n\nKatie and Brooke left, and Rick wished he'd been there to protect Caroline. Caroline uttered that he was her boyfriend, not her bodyguard. Taking her hand, Rick wished he could be much more. She looked startled, and he chuckled, saying he wasn't proposing under such unromantic circumstances. She joked about the hospital being romantic, and Rick whispered that he actually wouldn't mind proposing right then, because the only future he could see was with her.\n\n\nLater, Bill returned to the empty patient's room with his drink. Katie and Brooke entered, claiming they'd looked for him all over. They gave him the good news about Caroline's condition. Bill suggested they see Caroline, but Katie and Brooke wanted to give Rick and Caroline a little time alone.\n\n\nKatie decided she wanted some coffee, and she picked up Bill's paper cup. As she tipped it to her face, the very smell of it made her frown. She asked what was in it, and Bill replied, \"Coffee...mostly...\" Sniffing it again, Katie said, \"I smell booze. Are you drinking?\"\n\n\nAt the cliff house, the underwear-clad Steffy tried to lure Liam into bed, but Liam wanted to get to work and give the staff a reprieve from the fiery Bill, who was probably seething about what Caroline had done. Steffy slinked back into her dress but said there was still time if he changed his mind. Liam, however, did not change his mind.\n\n\nSteffy said she was glad Caroline had convinced Rick to tell the truth, because lies never fixed things. Though Steffy wasn't at ease about things, she felt Hope deserved to know the truth. Liam gave Steffy a wondrous look, and Steffy guessed that she was \"knocking his socks off\" at that moment.\n\n\nSteffy made out with Liam more, but he insisted he had to get to work. She said she'd take care of dessert if he'd cook dinner later. Steffy kissed Liam along his neck, but he looked distracted.\n\n\nLiam left, and Steffy packed up for work. In her files, Steffy found a promotional photo of Hope. \"There's no way you're getting him back, Hope,\" Steffy told the picture.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam was working when Hope entered. From the way he looked, she could tell no one had called him about Caroline. Hope explained that Caroline had fallen during an argument with Bill about \"us.\" Hope conveyed that Caroline hadn't been seriously hurt, but Hope believed the fall wouldn't have happened if Bill hadn't been so concerned that Hope and Liam might get back together.\n\n\nHope claimed that Rick, Bill, and Steffy had caused many problems, but they weren't the only reason that Hope and Liam weren't together. Liam looked away, and Hope apologized for the way she'd acted in the past. She believed that she'd been too proud and too selfish. She'd wanted things done her way, and she'd put unrealistic expectations on their relationship. She said Rick had lied, and she should have believed Liam.\n\n\nLiam turned to Hope, and he seemed entranced by her eyes and her lips. Suddenly, he snapped out of it and said he couldn't do it. He asked why Hope was talking that way. He stated that before, he'd been ready to get married, and he'd begged Hope. Liam claimed that since that time, he'd begun living with Steffy, and he couldn't do it. Without batting an eye, Hope said, \"Yes, you can.\" \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "With Bill looking on, Rick insists that Caroline tell them what happened. Katie reminds him that she just woke up, so give her a few minutes. Caroline utters that she stood her ground. She says she remembers yelling, Bill trying to walk away and she grabbed for his arm. In the process, she hit her heavy handbag, slipped and flew over the railing. Katie emphasizes that it was an accident; Bill did not push her. Caroline says no he did not push her. Steffy coos to Liam that she wants him to stay with her and not go back to her. For now he says he has to go back to the office and protect them from his dad. Rick follows Bill and tells him that he may not have pushed Caroline, but he was responsible for hurting the woman that he loves and that will not happen again. Caroline did not have to tell him a thing. She told him out of respect. Bill reminds him that Caroline is family. They had a heated argument and it got out of control, but he is not going to listen to a lecture by her boyfriend. Rick tells him to do them a favor and stay away from her. Hope explains to Caroline that Bill really didn't care that Caroline told about the lie. He only cared how this affected Liam getting back with Hope and instead keeping him with Steffy. Hope confronts Bill and says she knows he did not push Caroline but Caroline stood up to him and he didn't like that. Bill says he did what he had to do and there is no way he is going to give Hope a second chance with his son. Steffy says she learned the hard way that lying doesn't fix anything, so she's glad Caroline told the truth. Liam's dad won't like it though. Bill tells Hope that his position hasn't changed. Hope says she and Liam would still be together if it wasn't for him. She wants Liam back and the life they should have had. This time she won't let anybody stand in the way. Katie tells Bill that no one is blaming him. They are only worried about Caroline. She picks up his coffee cup and smells booze and accuses him of drinking. Rick kisses Caroline and says the only future he wants is with her. Steffy packs up her bag for the office and spies a pix of Hope and vows to her that she will never get Liam back. Hope stops by Liam's office, surprised that no one called him and told him about Caroline. She says it was an accident, but one that would not have happened except Bill was so concerned and worried about keeping them from getting back together. His dad, Steffy and Rick all caused them a lot of problems. She apologizes again for being so selfish and not believing him over her own brother, Rick. From moving in and moving out, she placed too many expectations on him and she is sorry. For a split second he seems to be divided in what he should do. Finally he blurts out that he can't do this. He begged her more than once to marry him. Now he is living with Steffy; he can't do this. Hope says yes he can.",
