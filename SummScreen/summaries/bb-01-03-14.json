He said it had been effortless, and it was natural for him when he loved someone like he loved her.\n\n\nWyatt told Hope the story of an island flower that a princess had torn in half when she and her lover had parted. The flower had felt the sadness of the couple, and it only grew in the mountain where the princess had exiled herself and by the shore where her lover had lived. The flower grew in halves, and Wyatt said that putting two flowers together was like reuniting the couple.\n\n\nHope found the story to be romantic and tragic. Wyatt gave her another flower and explained that it was Plumeria, which meant \"long love in absence.\" He said people gave it to sailors who'd go off to war. Hope said she wasn't going to war, but he replied that she might be if she didn't stay with him.\n\n\nWyatt placed the flower behind Hope's left ear and said that a flower placed there meant that the lady was taken. He added that kisses accompanied gifts of flowers, and they kissed.\n\n\nWyatt stated that the flower also had healing properties. He decided to keep one of the flowers that hadn't bloomed. Hope stated that the bud just needed time and light, and he replied that it worked that way for all things. He recalled that he'd been closed up when they'd met, but her light had opened him. Wyatt said he wanted to be the light in Hope's life, too, and he kissed her again.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn stated the Liam's Spencer swagger was too late because Wyatt already had Hope in Hawaii. Liam reasoned that the trip had required Quinn's engineering. He said that Quinn didn't understand that none of the many attempts to break up him and Hope had ever worked, and he assured her that hers wouldn't, either.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that she'd merely been the whistle-blower, and Hope had seen Liam's feelings for herself. Liam claimed that it was foolish of Quinn to play upon Hope's fears. Quinn countered that Liam had returned from Hawaii empty-handed, and it had been his weakness and indecision, not Quinn's actions, that had caused him to lose Hope.\n\n\nLiam asserted that Hope knew that he'd fly to the ends of the earth for her, and he'd do it again, and again, and again if he had to. He suggested that Quinn apprise her son of that fact. Quinn told Liam to show his brother some respect because Wyatt deserved his chance with Hope. Liam replied that he'd show Wyatt the same respect that Wyatt had shown him.\n\n\nOn the subject of Wyatt deserving a chance, Liam reminded Quinn that she and Wyatt had bulldozed their way in with manipulations. Quinn seethed that her son was in love with Hope, and Liam had Steffy. Liam replied that he'd always care for Steffy, but Hope would be his wife. Liam also felt that it was debatable whether Wyatt could love anyone above himself.\n\n\nQuinn hopped to her son's defense and berated Liam for his subpar treatment of Hope. Liam contended that Quinn had only heard stories from Wyatt, and Liam and Hope had never had a life without intrusions and manipulations. Quinn retorted that Liam had failed. Liam, however, replied that Bill had failed, Steffy had failed, Deacon had failed, and so would Wyatt and Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that she hadn't failed yet, and Liam called her out on making it into her own twisted game. He called her neurotic and assumed that Wyatt was embarrassed of her. Quinn swooped into Liam's space, hissing, \"My son loves me, and don't you dare imply otherwise!\"\n\n\n\"Then why don't you do what a loving parent should do and back the hell off!\" Liam roared back. He decided that Quinn had no faith in her son, and she clearly didn't believe Wyatt could win Hope on his own merit. Liam suggested that Quinn allow Hope to make her own decisions.\n\n\nQuinn stated that Hope had already made the decision, but Liam disagreed. He believed that when Hope did choose, it wouldn't be Wyatt. Quinn warned Liam to stay away from Hope and Wyatt -- if Liam knew what was good for him. Unfazed, Liam told Quinn to keep threatening him. \"Because it only fuels my fire, baby!\" Liam haughtily added.\n\n\nQuinn warned Liam not to mess with her, but Liam said he was driven by a desire protect Hope. Quinn felt that Liam was insane if he thought she'd ever hurt Hope. Liam contended that no one knew anything about Quinn, who'd dropped in from the sky after lying to her son his entire life. Quinn retorted that she was capable of more than he could imagine, and she warned him to stay away from her and Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam declared that he didn't want any part of Wyatt and Quinn, and he didn't want Hope to suffer a mother-in-law like Quinn. Liam vowed to make sure nothing became of Hope and Wyatt, but Quinn asserted that something already had. \"Hope will see through both of you soon enough,\" Liam replied and walked out.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill learned that Brooke hadn't seen Ridge again yet. He assumed that Ridge was off licking his wounds, but Brooke said that Ridge had a right to be disturbed by her actions with Bill. Bill stated that, if it were him, he wouldn't care about whom she'd spent her time with in his absence. All he'd be concerned about was being in her bed with his arms around her.\n\n\nBill didn't feel that Brooke owed Ridge any apologies for what had gone on. Brooke stated that she owed more than an apology, and she felt that she should have to atone for it. Bill deduced that she wanted to punish herself for loving him, but he figured that doing so wouldn't make the feelings go away. \"Unless you've found something better with someone else. Did you, Brooke?\" he asked.\n\n\nBill instructed Brooke not to let Ridge make her feel guilty all over again. Because of the progress she'd made after they'd been exposed, Bill advised her to just let the guilt go. He asked how he could help, and she said that, for the kids' sakes, he could go back to Katie.\n\n\nJust then, R.J. arrived home. He took off his coat and immediately noticed that something was wrong with his mother. Brooke played down her feelings and sent the child upstairs to do his homework. To Bill, she said R.J.'s reaction was exactly what she had been trying to avoid. She didn't want R.J. to know about her relationship with Bill.\n\n\nBill told Brooke to calm down and not let Ridge whip up all the feelings again. Brooke stated that things had become that way because Ridge had just found out. Bill argued that Ridge had been gone a year, and the best he'd given Brooke upon his return had been a lecture. Bill called Ridge a loser who only focused on Brooke's faults, and he asked if Ridge was made of cardboard or something.\n\n\nBill asked if Brooke was thinking about returning to Ridge. Brooke denied that she was, but she said that she had to do what was best for Katie. Bill insisted that the damage had been done, Katie was finding her way, and Brooke and he had to do the same thing. He urged her not to let their precious bond slip away, and he asked if she'd been any happier than when they'd been together.\n\n\nBill declared that he wanted their relationship back. He swept Brooke into his arms and kissed her. Brooke tearfully asked him to leave, and Bill silently exited the house. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope tells Wyatt that the hula was fun and only he could pull this off by not forcing her to go outside but still enjoying the island. Wyatt tells her it wouldn't be Hawaii without a pig roast. She's immediately scared until he says not a real pig roast but he has some takeout. He recommends the pineapple bar- b-que sauce because it is so good on everything. Liam tells Quinn that regardless of what she thinks, Wyatt is not the one for Hope. She grins at him and says he has his daddy's swagger all right but it is ill-timed now since Hope is with Wyatt right now in Hawaii. And they are getting closer and closer with every passing hour. Liam accuses her of setting that up. And brags there have been many, many others who have attempted to break them up but none have worked and neither will she. Quinn says his confidence is impressive. That's probably why women find him attractive. She reminds Liam that she was just the whistleblower. Steffy showed up at the cabin all on her own. Liam says all Hope saw was a bad memory but then Quinn was counting on that. In her own twisted mind she thought that would be enough. How foolish of Quinn. She scoffs \u0096 he is the one who went to Hawaii and came back without Hope. So it was not her actions but his own .his own indecisiveness and insecurities. Liam looks her square in the eyes and says he will fight to the end of this earth to get Hope back so Quinn better be ready for that reality. He will not forfeit Hope. She fires back that he had his chances with Hope but he blew it. So man up and give his brother some respect. Liam counters with that he'll give him as much respect as Wyatt gives him \u0096 ZERO. He mocks Quinn when she says Wyatt deserves this, He says her lies and manipulations are only going to make him and Hope stronger. Hope is gonna be his wife. And as far as Wyatt is concerned Liam is not sure he can love anyone but himself. Bill asks Brooke if there has been any more Ridge sightings. She says no but she doesn't think Ridge over-reacted either. He says well if he was Ridge and had been gone a year he would not care what she did or who it was with. He'd just want to be up in that bedroom with her arms around him. She says she was mortified in having to explain. Bill says she shouldn't have to. She says yes she does and it should be atonement and punishment. He continues then that is the problem. Punishment is not going to make it go away. They can not deny what they have unless she has found something better with someone else. Hope thanks Wyatt for the most wonderful sandwich she has ever had. He says Hawaii has always been one of his passions. That's his mantra, find out what she needs then supply it. She says he does that a lot. He says it comes naturally when you love someone the way he does. Bill asks Brooke how he can help her. She says for all the kid's sake, go back to Katie. RJ walks in from school and thinks his mom looks upset. She quickly scoots him upstairs to do his homework. Then tells Bill that is exactly what she didn't want, her son picking up on something between them. Bill says they have been quiet about this so she has nothing to worry about. And Ridge has been gone for a year and all he can do is lecture her. He had the most beautiful, sensual woman on the planet and could not even see it. He must be made out of cardboard as all Ridge sees is her faults. Wyatt tells Hope one of his favorite legends involving a native flower and a princess. And back in those times it was taboo for a commoner to have anything at all to do with royalty. But the commoner and princess fell in love and went up into the mountains to see this priest. He told them to pray and as they did it started to rain. Their hearts were broken and he took this flower from her ear and divided it and said one of them would go below and one stay on the mountain. As they parted, all the flowers there on the mountain saw how sad they were. That half of the flower blossomed and today only those two places has this flower. And when they are together it means the commoner and his princess are reunited. Hope says that is beautiful but very sad. He quips that he's not really a commoner so he doesn't think they will have that problem. He tells her to stay put, he has another story for her. He returns with another flower, one more common and seen throughout the island. It's one that young women give to their men when going off to war. And if a woman puts it behind one ear it means she is available and the other that she is taken. And course it always is accompanied with a kiss. He puts the flower behind Hope's ear and kisses her. Brooke tells Bill that yes she is in love with him but it is wrong. He makes her look at him and says he is not giving up. The damage has been done and the pain felt. Katie is finding her way so the two of them must do the same. This is not about Katie anymore and Brooke can not let something this precious slip through her fingers. He wants to be up in that bedroom again with her. He wants that back where he was never more happier. She allows him to kiss her but with tears she tells him to go. Liam continues to tell Quinn to stop meddling. She must not have faith that Wyatt can get Hope on his own. But when Hope makes her decision it won't be Wyatt. She glares at him and tells Liam to leave Wyatt alone .and stay away from Hope too if he knows what is good for him. He says just keep on threatening him as it only fuels his fire. She says he really doesn't want to push her. He says what drives him is that he really wants to protect Hope .from her and Wyatt. She says he is insane if he ever thought she'd hurt Hope. He counters with they really know nothing about her. She and Wyatt just fell out of the sky. And she's been lying even to Wyatt all of his life so no telling what she is capable of. She says she is capable of much more than he realizes so he better stay away from her and her son. He says he sure as hell doesn't want Hope to have her as a mother-in-law so that is why he's going to do all he can to see that Hope doesn't end up with Wyatt. Hope will see through them eventually. Wyatt holds up a tiny blossom from the flower and says he is keeping it as a reminder. It will open up with just a little time and light. And that's the way he was. When he met Hope, he was closed and when she shone her light on him he just opened. And he wants to do that for her; to be the light in her life. He kisses her again several times, and she gazes into his eyes with a smile on her face.",
