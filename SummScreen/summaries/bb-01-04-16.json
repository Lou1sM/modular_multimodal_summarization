    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Liam rushed in and saw Ivy unconscious at the bottom of the staircase. He called paramedics as Steffy trotted down to the landing. \"Don't you touch her,\" Liam said to Steffy.\n\n\nThe ambulance arrived and took Ivy to the hospital. \"Again, Steffy?\" Liam asked. Liam started to leave the house, and Steffy said she was going with him. He told her that she wasn't. He claimed that Steffy wasn't supposed to go near Ivy, and he asked how many times Steffy had to learn it.\n\n\nSteffy swore she hadn't touched Ivy. Liam didn't care, and he didn't believe it was a coincidence that Ivy ended up in the hospital whenever Steffy was nearby. He yelled that they'd had a whole conversation about Steffy staying away. \"Oh, yeah. It's convenient for you just for me to stay away and tell her that you're in love with her, right?\" Steffy asked.\n\n\nLiam asked why Steffy hadn't been able to rein it in for once and just let Ivy go to Australia. Steffy sobbed that it wasn't her fault. He asked her to tell him why violence followed her around. Liam said it was always someone else's fault, and he was done with her excuses. \"I'm done,\" he said and left.\n\n\nLater, Steffy left what she indicated was another message for Liam. In it, she said she'd tried to call the hospital, but no one would tell her anything. She asked Liam to call her back even if he was upset because they never shut each other out. She said she'd be waiting at home.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Steffy finally got the hospital to let her know that Ivy was conscious and might be released that day. Steffy messaged Liam to say she hoped he'd be home soon. She waited and worried about Liam saying he was done. Grimacing, she looked at her ring.\n\n\nIn the design office, Wyatt arrived. Quinn said no one expected him to be at work. Wyatt replied that he wouldn't stay at home and stare at the ring all day. He was upset because he thought he'd done everything the right way that time, without trickery or trying to outdo the competition. He hadn't even known that he'd had competition, and he wondered how many lies Ivy had told him.\n\n\nQuinn was sure Ivy would soon feel the pain of what she'd done and said that Ivy had thrown away something that she could never replace. Wyatt no longer felt like the main character in his own story. Quinn replied that it hadn't been that way when it had just been the two of them. Though he hadn't been thrilled about it, he admitted that being the center of attention with Quinn had been a rare gift.\n\n\nWyatt didn't regret learning that he was a Spencer, but he didn't like being the least magnetic one. Quinn didn't want to hear him talk badly about himself. Wyatt believed he was a great person; he just didn't understand his effect on others. She regretted spending recent years surrounded by people who weren't committed to anything. He said Steffy wasn't like that, and Quinn agreed.\n\n\nQuinn noted that Ivy wasn't the same, sweet, dimwitted Ivy they'd first met. She wondered if Ivy had suffered a mental breakdown. Wyatt didn't want to disparage Ivy and reminded Quinn that he'd had to defend her against mental illness claims in the past. Quinn reasoned that it might not be Ivy's fault; it might be culture shock that had caused Ivy to lose her ladylike roots. \n\n\nWyatt asked what culture shock would make Ivy get the hots for a man she'd been raised to think was her cousin. \"There!\" Quinn exclaimed. She urged him to keep the fire in his belly.\n\n\nPam entered and told Wyatt that Ivy needed him. Wyatt disagreed, but Pam said that someone from the hospital had called for Eric, and an unconscious Ivy had been admitted.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Liam entered as a doctor was checking Ivy's vision and reflexes. The doctor said Ivy was lucky, even though she kept winding up in the emergency room. He told Liam that Ivy had regained consciousness pretty soon after she'd arrived.\n\n\nThe doctor left, and Ivy joked that staying in Los Angeles was lowering her life expectancy. Liam said he was sorry, and she asked if he was really going to marry Steffy. Ivy had meant it when she'd said she loved him. She was sure Steffy would beat him down into an unrecognizable version of himself. She said he already didn't resemble the guy she'd been with in Amsterdam.\n\n\nLiam stated that Steffy had said she hadn't pushed Ivy. Ivy guessed Steffy would say such about Ivy's newest \"brush with emergency medicine.\" Ivy didn't think he believed Steffy. He replied that he did, but he didn't know if it mattered. Ivy replied that it didn't matter if Steffy told the truth because Liam didn't trust her. \"And she did tell the truth this time,\" Ivy added.\n\n\nIvy wanted to wish Liam and Steffy a happy life, but Ivy said havoc kept the couple together. Liam decided to leave, but she asked him not to go. She guessed she'd painted herself into a corner in L.A. He asked why his brother hadn't been enough. Ivy said it was hard to get over what one had lost, even if it wasn't the right thing. \"Well, that doesn't explain Thomas,\" Liam replied.\n\n\nIvy reasoned that if she'd been able to explain Thomas to herself, she could have stopped herself. She asked if Wyatt would forgive her. Lam doubted it. He advised her to take time for herself and made it clear that he and Ivy wouldn't be a couple. He didn't want her to think he was doubtful or confused about it.\n\n\nWyatt and Quinn arrived, and Wyatt noted that Ivy was conscious. Ivy said she was unkillable. \"Not unlike a coach roach. Can we go now?\" Quinn asked. Wyatt asked what had happened, and Ivy explained that she'd fallen down the stairs. Liam reluctantly revealed that Steffy had been there. Using air quotes, Liam mumbled that it had been an accident. \"No, I'm sure it was,\" Liam decided.\n\n\nThe doctor arrived to take Ivy for a scan to check against her last one. Ivy thanked Wyatt for checking on her, even though he probably didn't care what happened to her anymore. She said she hadn't deserved him. He asked her to do them a favor and stop winding up hospitalized.\n\n\nAfter Ivy and the doctor had gone, Liam apologized for not calling Wyatt. Wyatt wasn't surprised because Liam also hadn't notified him about Ivy's feelings. Liam claimed he hadn't told Wyatt because Liam hadn't believed Ivy. Wyatt didn't buy it, and Liam insisted that, because Ivy and Steffy had been so competitive, it had seemed as if Ivy had just been trying to get a response out of him.\n\n\n\"Yeah, but she did, didn't she? Because you kept it a secret,\" Wyatt countered. He said Liam had given it priority over his own brother. Liam claimed that he wasn't the cause of Wyatt's pain and hadn't invited whatever Ivy was going through. Liam stated that he and Steffy had been happy, and he'd assumed that Wyatt and Ivy had also been happy.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Ivy had really fallen down a flight of stairs that she'd navigated hundreds of times in her life. Liam replied that he was having trouble with it, too. Quinn speculated about Steffy's part in it. Liam replied that it wasn't attempted murder, and each woman had said Steffy hadn't touched Ivy.\n\n\nUpset, Liam said the problem was Steffy even being there after they'd had conversations time and time again about it. He stated that Steffy had agreed that it wasn't her job to defend Wyatt, but she'd hunted Ivy down again.\n\n\nFrustrated, Liam decided to take a walk. As soon as he left, Quinn noted that Steffy had been defending Wyatt. Wyatt didn't know why Steffy wouldn't defend him, the inured party. Quinn replied that it was because Liam wouldn't like it. Wyatt stated that Steffy spoke her mind no matter what. Quinn conveyed that Steffy and Wyatt had that in common.\n\n\nWyatt relayed that Steffy had been a friend to him, and Quinn suspected that Steffy might need a friend at that moment. Wyatt wanted to wait and make sure Ivy's head wasn't broken. Quinn exclaimed that Ivy was fine and didn't deserve his concern -- unlike Steffy, who had stuck up for him. She urged him to go to Steffy. \"Maybe that's how this whole thing is supposed to turn out,\" Quinn reasoned.\n\n\n",
