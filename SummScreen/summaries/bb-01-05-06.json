Stephanie tells her that she knows her son well enough to know that he would not accept any reason for her unfaithfulness, and it will be the beginning of a marriage being destroyed, that doesn't have to be.  She warns Taylor to forget about what happened so long ago, even if the kiss with Hector brought it all to the surface again. Taylor tells her that she doesn't even know why it happened with James.  They weren't lovers, they were colleagues and she thought that James was going to die. The phone rings and Taylor answers it to find that Ridge is at the airport.  His bags are in the trunk and he is on his way home from the airport; he is back home and will be with her soon.  She looks at Stephanie, not at all sure about herself and the reunion she had waited for so long for.  Aside from all the turbulence Taylor is going through, Stephanie also warns her that she has Brooke to consider.  If Ridge has any reason to walk out on his marriage, Brooke will smell blood and come after him again.\n\n\nThorne, Darla and Sally discuss what has just happened in Thorne's office.  Thorne has offered her a job, but she tells him that she can't accept it.  She feels that a year ago she would have been able to do it, but now she just thinks that everyone is feeling sorry for the old lady in the wheelchair.  She really doesn't feel that she can handle it.  She tells Thorne and Darla that it takes her long to remember things, it isn't the same anymore.  Thorne calls her a problem solver and a people motivator, and, that's what the company needs right now.  She starts to think about working with her friend, Stephanie and how it could help Thorne keep all those against him being the President, in place.  She tells him that she will do it, but, she doesn't come cheap!  She insists on a company car, and a driver with large biceps.  Thorne laughs with Darla, then agree to her wants and needs.  She thanks them both very much.  Later, when they are alone, Darla asks Thorne if he rigged that whole scene or not.  He laughs and tells her that perhaps he didn't call in all the \"smartest\" choices that he could have called.  Darla thinks that he is wonderful and sweet also.\n\n\nBrooke is with Nick.  She tells him that Taylor said she was going to tell Ridge everything, so she didn't need to be involved in their marriage, it was their business.  Brooke doesn't know what to do.  Nick asks her if she wants a future with Ridge again.  She tells him \"no\" that she doesn't think of any man, and Nick should know why.  Nick suggests that she do what she believes is best.  He will back her, no matter what.  She tells him that she just wants the truth to be known.  She thinks it is best for Ridge to know it.  \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Taylor makes it clear to Stephanie that she plans to tell Ridge the truth about everything, not just the recent encounter with Hector but also her encounter with James many years ago. Stephanie confesses that she already knows about Taylor sleeping with James. Stephanie tries to convince Taylor not to tell Ridge, as it will give Brooke the perfect chance to swoop in and snatch Ridge up, but Ridge arrives home before Stephanie can convince Taylor to go her way. Brooke tells Nick that she has accepted that she will never have a life with him, but admits that she wants her children to have a stable home. Brooke says that therefore she needs Ridge. Sally initially turns down Thorne's offer to take the job, convinced that it's charity, but Thorne manages to convince Sally that she is truly the best person for the job, and convinces her to accept the position.\r\n",
    "yt": "\n\nTaylor tells Stephanie that she is going to let Ridge know about her past mistakes, and her most recent one with Hector. Stephanie discourages this idea, and tells Taylor that revealing these secrets will end their marriage. She is also afraid that Brooke will then steal Ridge away. Ridge surprises Taylor and arrives home, while she is conflicted about what to do. Brooke asks Nick what she should do about Taylor. Nick says that he will support her decision, and she decides to tell Ridge about Hector, if Taylor does not. Sally accepts the job and thanks Thorne for offer.  She is extremely grateful for all of his help.",
