    "imdb": "\nIt's nail-biting everywhere now Nick's first Clark Garrison-designed cruise collection is being presented. The Marone board attends, worrying about their 'conservative values'. Stefanie brings captain Kramer, in uniform. Taulor hears about the sabotage plans, probably too late. Thorne knocks out Clark to approach the models and cue a spectacular 'sho-stopper' in the literal sense.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "All abuzz backstage at the fashion show, Clarke reminds them that it looks like it's show time. Jackie reminds him their clients need to see sophistication, elegance and class \u0096 most of all class. In his Texas drawl, George tells Nick that this fashion show better prove to be an asset or the rope will turn into a noose. Nick smoothes feathers by telling Jackie it's been a rough couple of days, but all is forgiven and their future is together. He tells the press this is all due to his mother being in charge. Today will be a day to remember because of her. Ridge assures Stephanie that Rita and Davis are on board and all is in place. They mention that Eric knows nothing about this; he would never approve. Captain Kramer arrives and he and Stephanie leave for the showing with Ridge staying behind. Taylor comes back from her conference early and decides to stop and cheer up Eric. Talking with Ridge she figures out that Stephanie is sabotaging the show. The show seems to be a success, lots of applause. Nick gloats to George that he thinks they have a hit. Congratulations, they have beat the Forrester's at their own game. Rita and Davis tell Stephanie they just want her and Eric to get the company back. They are instrumental that everything backstage goes according to her plan. Thorne sucker punches Clarke out cold and Rita informs the models of an alternate plan, one Jackie would want. Stephanie continues to BS Kramer that he keep his eyes on the prize at the end of the runway \u0096 Miss Jackie. Donna pulls him on stage whereupon Jackie immediately recognizes him, and then Nick. He leaps on stage and pummels him by the lapels with the press and cameras recording it all. Over the loudspeaker Stephanie gleefully announces the real show-stopper is Captain Kramer and Ms. Marone is his Number One prostitute. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the new owner of Forrester Creations is no more than a common whore.",
