    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester corridor, Pam continued to grill Othello about the changes he was referring to at Forrester. Ivy interrupted and asked where Maya was. Pam explained that Rick had called Maya into the meeting. Ivy decided that she couldn't contain the secret any longer, and she was telling Caroline. \n\n\nOthello said it might be too late, and Pam asked what secret he and Ivy were talking about. Ivy revealed the kiss secret to Pam, and Pam swore herself to secrecy about it. Ivy wanted to tell Caroline, but Pam said to wait to see how the meeting played out. Ivy was upset at herself for not speaking up, but Pam reasoned that Rick had threatened Ivy's job. \n\n\nIn the CEO's office, everyone expressed outrage at Rick's declaration that he'd run the company with Maya. Eric said it hadn't been what he'd agreed to. As Caroline sobbed, Carter surmised that Rick had tricked Eric while secretly with Maya the whole time. \n\n\nEric insisted that the deal had been made under the \"pretense\" of Rick remaining with Caroline. Rick said he wasn't breaking any rules of the contract, which contained nothing about Caroline, and Caroline wasn't Rick's problem anymore. Eric demanded to know how Rick could play them all -- including his own father. Eric intended to have the deceitful act reversed. Rick said the document had already been signed and witnessed. \n\n\nEric couldn't believe Rick had betrayed everyone \"for this.\" Rick said Eric had given him a year to prove himself as a CEO without interference from Ridge, and Rick and Maya would prove themselves with soaring profits. Maya added that Rick was the same son Eric had trusted with the business regardless of Rick's personal life. Eric apologized to Caroline and said he wouldn't have signed if he'd known.\n\n\nRidge accused Rick of being a spoiled, petulant brat. Rick quipped that Caroline could have the kids she wanted with Ridge and asked if she'd really thought she could get away with her betrayal. Caroline yelled that Rick had said he'd forgiven her. Rick retorted that she had said she'd be faithful. \"I guess we both lied,\" he concluded.\n\n\nRidge suggested that Eric find a loophole in the agreement. Rick responded that the papers were clean-cut, and Ridge had better tread lightly under fear of termination. Eric told Rick that he wasn't going to fire anyone. Rick rasped that designers were a dime-a-dozen, and he could get them anywhere. He suggested that the designers think of that the next time they held hands by a sketchpad.\n\n\nRick suggested that Eric go on vacation while Rick ran the business. Rick asserted that he expected everyone to treat his new partner with respect. Eric understood Rick's pain, but Eric declared that no CEO or son of his behaved the way Rick had. Ridge accused Rick of using Caroline to get what Rick wanted. Caroline glared at Rick. \"You made me choose,\" he said. \n\n\nMaya claimed that she and Rick were committed to Forrester and each other. Rick asked Eric to teach and travel while Rick carried on Eric's good deeds and, as Eric's son, made Eric proud. Rick told Ridge and Caroline that they were free to work together and to give in to their feelings because what they did no longer affected him. \"So go be free,\" he urged them.\n\n\nThroughout the argument, Ridge and Eric were enraged, Carter was in disbelief, and Maya was complacent. Caroline and Rick seemed to be the only tearful and hurt people in the room. \n\n\nRick sadly but bitterly informed Caroline that he'd hired someone to pack her things, and he'd send them wherever she directed. He added that Maya was moving in. Caroline burst into a ball of anger and declared that it was enough. She ordered everyone out of the room so she could talk to Rick. She screamed at Maya to get out, but Maya didn't move until Carter called her to the door.\n\n\nOnce Rick and Caroline were alone, Caroline asked if it had all been a put-on. \"Yeah, from the moment you turned to Ridge,\" Rick answered. She felt sick. He said he'd felt that way; he'd felt empty, betrayed, and as if his whole world had been taken from him. She figured that he'd wanted her to feel the same, but even if she deserved the feeling, \"I do not deserve this!\"\n\n\nCaroline had never been more stunned or hurt in her life. She'd genuinely thought they'd been working on the marriage. She'd known that something hadn't been right, and she'd questioned herself as Rick had slept beside her night after night. She'd berated herself for hurting him so badly that he couldn't bear to touch her. She yelled that the truth had been that he'd been sneaking around with Maya. \"Congratulations. You got me,\" Caroline hopelessly uttered.\n\n\nCaroline was angry with Rick for lying to her and carrying on with Maya; however, she knew that he'd done it because of his pain and history with Ridge. Rick said it wasn't about Ridge. Rick declared that he wanted to be with Maya, and he wanted to be CEO with Maya. Caroline didn't think he believed that. He sank into the desk chair and said she could believe what she wanted. \n\n\nCaroline hated making excuses for Rick. Balling her fists and gritting her teeth, she revealed that it was taking everything within her not to slap him; however, she was willing to swallow her pride for their marriage and the children that they might someday have. She still wanted everything they'd signed up for, and she knew he wanted it, too. \n\n\nCaroline told Rick to look at her, but he wouldn't. \"Look at me!\" she screamed and banged her hand on the desk. With tears streaming down his cheeks, he faced her. She decided to give him one more chance. She said she was sorry for hurting him, but he'd hurt her more than anyone ever had. \n\n\nSobbing, Caroline yelled that she knew Rick didn't love Maya or want a life with Maya. Caroline said that she loved him, and he still loved her. She felt that they'd each made mistakes, but it wasn't too late to save the marriage. At the top of her lungs, she cried that he had to tell her that he was willing to try. She begged him to say that he was. Rick shed tears, but his mouth remained stubbornly shut. \n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Maya grinned and flashed back on her and Rick's relationship. Ivy arrived, and Maya announced that Ivy was too late -- Rick had told Caroline the truth about him and Maya. Maya said he'd done it right after securing control of Forrester. Ivy said she should have known that Rick and Maya were not only kissing behind Caroline's back but also scheming a takeover. \n\n\nMaya liked to refer to it as actualizing a man's dreams. Ivy doubted Ridge and Eric would stand for it, but Maya said the contract was iron-clad. Ivy asked if Maya was just as sure of her and Rick. \"Do I look like I have any doubt?\" was Maya's placid response.\n\n\nIvy advised Maya to be concerned that she was a rebound. Ivy added that Rick had the power, but he couldn't feel good about his actions. Ivy said Maya shouldn't either, but Maya said not to worry about how she felt. Maya was looking forward to the world finally knowing that she, not Caroline, was the woman in Rick's life. \n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Carter pored over a copy of the contract, searching for a loophole, but the document contained no stipulation about the marriage. Ridge said Carter should have added it, but Carter noted that Chris, Rick's lawyer, had drawn it up. \n\n\nEric piped up that he hadn't taken the decision likely. He'd based it upon Rick's work and had thought the marriage was solid. Carter said that Eric had thought that Rick still loved Caroline. \"He does love her. That's why he's doing this,\" Ridge interjected. \n\n\nEric urged Carter to find something, but there was nothing to find. Eric had voluntarily given up the control. Ridge dismally concluded that they had to listen to the power-hungry idiot for a year. \"Anyone who wants to work here,\" Carter added. \n\nEric decided that he wasn't leaving town. Ridge said Eric might as well, and there was nothing Eric could do. Carter reported that the move had been Maya's desire all along, and she'd been targeting Rick for months. Eric stated that Rick had known exactly what he'd been doing, Maya aside. Ridge conveyed that Maya was Rick's pawn, but she didn't know it yet. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "With Caroline hanging her head in shame, Rick tells her that from now on he will be running the company with Maya. Eric can not believe he is hearing this. He signed those papers under the premise that Rick was back with Caroline. That was part of the deal and he knows it. Rick says no, it is not in the contract so he better look that over. He is not violating any rules. And Caroline is not his problem anymore. Eric asks how could Rick do this. It is so underhanded, deceitful and hateful. He is going to have this reversed. Rick says too late, it has been witnessed. He tells his dad that he has a year now to prove he can do well by the company and Maya will prove very beneficial to the company's future too. Eric apologizes to Caroline that he would not have done this had he known. Ridge calls Rick a spoiled petulant child, the same as he was as a child. Rick shouts at him that he is now CEO and he would tread lightly \"my friend\" if he wants to stay. He snaps his finger and says they are all replaceable and he could have ten more of them just like that. He tells his dad he has earned his time, so go ahead and go on vacation. He will run the company and it will be in good hands, but to Ridge he says he will run it like he sees fit without interference from Ridge. And he says he expects them all to treat his new partner, Maya, with respect. Pam tells Othello she thinks he knows more than he is saying. All he will say is that he has these vibes that there will be some big moves around here soon. Ivy walks up looking for Maya. She is concerned when she hears that Maya was called into the big executive meeting. She says she can not keep this secret anymore. She needs to go in and tell Caroline. Pam says she might as well wait and let this play out as it sounds like it is too late anyway. Eric tells Rick that he knows he has been hurt but this is not the way a CEO behaves or a son of his would. Rick says this is the way it had to be. They made him choose. But he will honor his dad by continuing giving to charities and to hospitals so Eric can rest assured and go on his travels with John. He will be the son that Eric raised and make him proud. He tells Ridge that his tenure as designer and VP will continue and he hopes he and Caroline will continue working together. And they can do it upfront and give in to passion if they want to as it would have zero impact on him now. He tells Caroline to pack her things and let him know where to send them. Maya is moving in now. Caroline shouts at them to all leave; she wants to talk to Rick alone. She asks if this is all a put on. He says it has been ever since he found out about her and Ridge. He felt like he had been kicked in the stomach the way she must feel now ..empty and betrayed like his whole world had been taken away from him. Now she knows how he felt. She says she knows he is angry and hurt and she deserves that but she does not deserve this. She genuinely thought they were working on their marriage. Something was not quite right but now she knows what it was. He was sleeping with her night after night without touching her yet he was sneaking around to be with Maya. Ivy catches up with Maya who says Ivy is too late. She can not blow the whistle on her now. Rick finally has the power that he deserves. She tells Ivy she has been waiting for this day to be named the woman in his life and not Caroline. Ivy tells her that she is just Rick's rebound and she should never have gotten involved with him. Maya tells her to butt out as she will sleep just fine tonight right beside Rick. Ridge argues to Carter that Rick deceived them. Carter sees nothing that can be revoked. If Eric tries, Rick can sue. Carter says Maya has wanted this all along. She has been wanting this for months. Ridge says Maya is just Rick's pawn in his little game only she does not know it yet. Eric agrees. He blames Maya too but Rick did this on purpose and knew what he was doing. He is certainly not going to leave and go out of town now with this brewing. Ridge says Rick still loves Caroline and that is why he is doing this. Caroline rants this is about Ridge who he has always had a problem with. Rick says he is with Maya because he wants to be with her and Caroline can think what she wants. She cries that she still wants everything they signed up for and she is willing to swallow her pride and will give him one more chance. She is sorry that she hurt him but he has hurt her more. He cries as she says she knows he still loves her and she still loves him. They both made mistakes but she is willing to try. She begs him to.",
