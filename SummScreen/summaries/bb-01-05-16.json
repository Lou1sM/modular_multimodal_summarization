    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's beach house, Steffy waited for Liam, and she flashed back to Ivy's fall down the stairs. She remembered that Liam had entered the house after Ivy had fallen, and he had been angry. Liam had shouted at her that it seemed to be a \"cosmic coincidence\" that something bad happened to Ivy every time Steffy was near her. \"We weren't even close to each other,\" Steffy had said.\n\n\nLiam had angrily reminded Steffy that she had been instructed to stay away from Ivy. \"It isn't my fault,\" Steffy had said. Liam had maintained that it was never Steffy's fault, but people continued to get hurt. \"I'm done,\" Liam had said. Steffy sat alone near the fire and worried.\n\n\nSteffy looked at a wedding picture of Liam and her at their first wedding, and she flashed back to meeting him on the mountain for the wedding. She recalled happier times with Liam, and she smiled.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Pam told Eric that Ivy had fallen down the stairs at the Forrester mansion. Eric was worried, but Pam added that she had more news. \"Steffy was involved,\" she said.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Wyatt and Quinn waited for word on Ivy's condition. Wyatt lamented that they were again waiting to hear what had happened to Ivy. Quinn wanted Wyatt to consider that Steffy needed a friend, considering what had happened. Quinn reminded Wyatt that Liam had been angry with Steffy, and Ivy was fine. Ivy had been alert and talking when she'd entered the emergency room.\n\n\nQuinn encouraged Wyatt to pursue Steffy. Liam entered and recognized that he had interrupted something. Quinn said he had caught a nice mother-son moment. Quinn asked about Ivy, and Liam answered that the doctors were running tests.\n\n\nQuinn noted that Liam looked exhausted. She added that it had to have been difficult for him to see Ivy hurt again after she'd barely recovered from being \"nearly shocked to death.\" Liam maintained that Steffy should not have been at the house with Ivy.\n\n\nLiam noted that Steffy didn't care what she was supposed to do, \"and somebody ends up in the hospital,\" he said. \"Or dead,\" Quinn added. Liam and Wyatt were shocked at Quinn's response, and Wyatt announced that Quinn didn't have to say every thought that entered her head.\n\n\nQuinn wondered how Liam had left things with Steffy. Liam admitted that he had told Steffy he was done. Quinn noted that it had been a bad night, and Liam refused to discuss it with her. He worried that Steffy always had to have the last word. Quinn wondered where Steffy was, and Liam said she had remained at Eric's house after the accident.\n\n\nThe doctor wheeled Ivy into the room in a wheelchair, and Ivy was surprised to see Wyatt, Quinn, and Liam. She thanked them all for waiting for her. The doctor announced that Ivy had a mild concussion and could return home as soon as he cleared up her paperwork. The doctor advised her against any strenuous activity and told her that if she had any nausea or dizziness, she needed to return to the hospital. \"Try not to visit us again for a while,\" the doctor suggested. He left.\n\n\nIvy asked Wyatt to remain and talk, but Wyatt refused to discuss anything further with her. He left. Quinn looked at Ivy and said she was glad Ivy was all right, but Quinn would not forgive her for how much she had hurt Wyatt. Quinn left.\n\n\nLiam asked if she was ready to return to Eric's house, and he offered to drive her. \"Liam, I have to go home to Australia today,\" Ivy said. Liam looked disappointed.\n\n\nLiam reminded Ivy that she wasn't supposed to be driving or anything, let alone flying. Ivy ignored his warnings and used her cell phone to schedule a flight. Liam tried to convince her to stay.\n\n\n\"I've gotta get out of here,\" Ivy said. She insisted that she was ready to return home to Australia.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn and Wyatt discussed what had happened, and Steffy called Wyatt to ask about Ivy's condition. Steffy worried that Liam had not answered any of her calls. Wyatt advised her that Ivy was all right and had a mild concussion. \"Thank God,\" Steffy said. Wyatt apologized that he hadn't thought about calling Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy admitted that she had been worried because Liam had been upset with her. \"Are you okay?\" Wyatt asked. Steffy answered that she had wanted Liam to talk to her. Steffy insisted that she was not giving up. She promised that she and Liam would work it out. She hung up.\n\n\nQuinn suggested that Wyatt should spend some time with Steffy. Wyatt refused because he was tired of ending up with women who had a history with Liam. \"I'm not doing that again,\" he said.\n\n\nQuinn argued that she believed Wyatt and Steffy were meant for each other. She added that Hope and Ivy had not been worthy of him. She pressured Wyatt to be a friend to Steffy because Steffy clearly needed one. Wyatt shook his head.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Eric sat with Ivy and begged her to wait a couple of days so that he could get used to the idea of her leaving. She thanked him but declined. \"I'm really going to miss you,\" she said.\n\n\n\"You're a Forrester and there's always a place for you here,\" Eric said. He hugged her. Liam interrupted and said he had to take Ivy to the airport, since he couldn't change her mind. He wanted to make sure she got into her seat. Ivy maintained it was all for the best.\n\n\nOn the plane, Liam helped Ivy into her seat, and she thanked him but reminded him that his ticket was not refundable. He said it was more important that he knew she was all right. Liam added that his ticket gave her an extra seat to stretch out and relax. Liam tried one last time to persuade her to stay in Los Angeles. Liam talked to a flight attendant about Ivy's condition and her concussion.\n\n\nLiam rejoined Ivy, and she said she was glad he was joining her. Liam noted that he was not accompanying her on the flight. \"Are you okay?\" Liam asked. Ivy smiled and apologized. She said she was fine, but she started to look sick and leaned forward.\n\n\nLiam jumped up to get her a towel from the flight attendant. The flight attendant reminded him to fasten his seat belt because the plane was ready to take off. Liam raced to the bathroom and put the towel under the faucet, but the faucet sprayed all over the place. Liam backed up to get away from the spray, but he slipped in the water, hit his head, and passed out. Meanwhile, the plane taxied down the runway.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Wyatt entered and greeted Steffy. Wyatt realized that Steffy had thought he was Liam. Wyatt wondered if Steffy had heard from Liam. She had not, and she asked if Liam was still at the hospital. Wyatt said he probably was. Steffy said Liam was probably at Ivy's bedside to \"monitor her breathing.\"\n\n\n\"Why did you come here?\" Steffy asked. She acknowledged that it was a difficult time for him too. Wyatt said he felt she might need a friend. Steffy wondered why \"all these terrible things keep happening around me.\" Wyatt said he believed she had not been involved. She said it meant a lot to her. Wyatt wondered if there was anything he could do for her. She maintained that she needed Liam to return home to her.\n\n\n",

Ivy informs Eric that she will return to Australia because she cannot be with Liam and started to become untrue to herself by alienating Wyatt. A surprised Eric tells his niece that he will always welcome her back. Ivy does not waste any time and asks Liam to give her a lift to the airport.

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy thinks over Ivy falling and what Liam says that she was supposed to stay away and every time Ivy and she are in the same room then Ivy ends up in hospital. Wyatt tells Quinn that Ivy could be seriously injured so he thinks he can rise above his own hurt feelings right now. Quinn says Steffy needs a friend right now. She is probably very upset and Liam says it is over. There is no need for Wyatt to be here, go get his life with Steffy, they belong together, so go get her. Liam walks in and wonders what he missed. He admits that Steffy was there at the accident again and should have just stayed away the way he asked her to, but she always has her face in someone else's business. But she doesn't care and she just goes off half-cocked and someone ends up in the hospital. It drives him nuts that she has to have the last word. This time he got upset and told her he was done. Quinn perks up at that. The doctor comes in and says Ivy is a very lucky woman. She suffered a mild concussion but they will not keep her. Just no strenuous activity, no working no driving and if she feels any nausea or dizziness to get back there immediately. She thanks Wyatt and asks if he will stay and talk. He says there is nothing more to say and perhaps it is Liam she needs to talk to. In leaving Quinn tells Ivy that her concern now for her and being here does not negate how much she hated her for hurting her son. Liam is ready to drive Ivy back to Eric's when she says no, she can not stay in L. A. one more day. She has to go on to Australia. He reminds her that she can not work or drive and needs more rest and should not even be flying until she has a clear head, but she insists. She explains to Eric who hugs her and says he will miss her. She is a Forrester and will always have a place here if she does not find what she wants out there. Steffy calls Wyatt and says she is just waiting if it takes all night to hear from Liam. He is being unresponsive. Quinn tells Wyatt that a little motherly advice never hurt anyone. She keeps telling Wyatt that don't waste time; go to Steffy. She reached out to him. He points out his track record with Ivy and Hope. He is not repeating that old pattern with Steffy going after Liam all the time. She says she can not understand why he is so underappreciated by people. She knows these women broke his heart but Ivy and Hope were not worthy of him, but he and Steffy are meant to be together and they could have a bright future. Steffy is all alone and has been left in the dust by Liam once again and she turned to Wyatt so go to her. Liam gets Ivy settled on the plane against his wishes. She is confused and thinks he is coming with her. Wyatt shows up and tells Steffy that he knows she is not expecting him but he will stay a while until Liam returns. He knows he will stay with Ivy until she is on her plane and well on her way. He just thought Steffy might need a friend. He laments that he believes her story that Ivy's accident was not her fault. Ivy tells Liam that she appreciates him and she will never forget. She has a dizzy spell so Liam grabs a towel and goes to the bathroom to dampen it with water. He slips and hits his head on the lavatory just as the plane is about to take off.",
