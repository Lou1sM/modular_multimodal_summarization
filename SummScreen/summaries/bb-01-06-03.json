    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Portofino, Italy, the fashion showdown between Eric and Ridge began with an announcer heralding, in Italian, the first entries by Spectra Fashions. Elegant but slightly edgy models sashayed down the pier-turned-runway to the beats of \"Oceanic Love\" by Lunar Plexus as Sally, Darla, Clarke, and Ridge looked on. Eric, Stephanie, and Brooke took in their competitors' offerings. Massimo stood sternly, while the bulk of the showing's attendees watched from boats bobbing in the harbor.\n\n\nNext, Eric's slightly more sophisticated models took a turn. Eric and Ridge locked eyes from across the runway, looking both competitive and pleased with each other. Bridget approached Massimo and asked how he was doing. When Massimo conceded that the show was going \"pretty well,\" Bridget clarified that she was asking about Massimo, acknowledging it couldn't be easy for him to watch her father share the moment with Massimo's son. Massimo sighed.\n\n\nThe music changed to Third Sun's \"Gonna Get It On,\" and Spectra's next contributions were put on display. Darla grooved and Sally beamed as Ridge and Eric observed with a sense of happy contemplation. Eric and Stephanie's exchanged glance seemed to say they approved. Brooke surveyed the festivities favorably, as well.\n\n\nAbove the harbor, in front of a bright yellow church, Thorne ran up to a waiting Macy. Thorne couldn't believe she was there, and he hugged her tightly. Finally breaking their extended embrace, Thorne kissed Macy's cheek and admitted he hadn't thought she would be there. Macy said she hadn't planned to meet him, but she couldn't leave without saying goodbye. Thorne stared at Macy as the Italian-language announcement that Eric's couture was up next wafted from below.\n\n\nWhile Eric's models showed off exquisite dresses, Stephanie paid a visit to Sally's side of the runway. The fashion mavens traded greetings that were more mirthful than antagonistic. Sally hoped Stephanie was there to concede, but Stephanie replied, \"Not on your life, Sally.\" Sally laughed and said that she was just trying to save Stephanie the double disappointment of losing the fashion challenge that Stephanie had waged against her own son. Stephanie confidently said they'd see, and she left the equally confident Sally to continue watching the show.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ridge amicably went up to Eric and told the \"old man\" that his designs weren't bad. Eric boasted comradely that they were the designs that were going to win the competition. Ridge said Eric had done something amazing -- not his designs, but arranging the whole showdown in Italy. Ridge declared that it had worked -- he was back on his feet. No matter what the judges decided, Ridge felt Eric had accomplished what he'd set out to do, which Ridge thanked him for. Eric responded with a \"You're welcome\" and a hug. Ridge deadpanned that he'd thought he should thank Eric at that moment, in case he was too busy later, collecting his trophy. \"Get away from me, Ridge,\" Eric said, grinning.\n\n\nSpectra took another turn as \"So Beautiful\" by Renald Francoeur played on the loudspeakers. The judges took notes from a vantage point on their boat.\n\n\nInside the church, Thorne asked if there was anything he could do to change Macy's mind. When Macy didn't answer, Thorne swore he would do whatever it took to stop her and vowed he would never let her down again. All Thorne wanted was to spend the rest of his life with Macy. When he'd told her he loved her earlier, he had meant it. Macy cried that she knew that, and that was why she was there. Thorne realized from her statement that, after everything that had happened, Macy still loved him. With tears in her eyes, Macy told Thorne that she had never stopped loving him.\n\n\nThe Italian announcer called in Eric's next grouping, which was even more cultivated than his previous work. Applause echoed through the harbor. Ridge reached Brooke with the showing's program and thanked her for the lovely tribute to Taylor. Brooke pointed out that, as she had told Thomas, she hadn't had a chance to pay her respects at Taylor's funeral. Ridge reported that Thomas had been very moved by Brooke's gesture. Brooke thought maybe that meant a new beginning for them. Ridge agreed it could definitely be that.\n\n\nThorne held Macy's face and insisted she couldn't leave. After Macy said she didn't have a choice, Thorne replied that one always had a choice -- Macy had chosen to stay with her father after her accident, she had chosen to see Sally while in Italy, and she had chosen to see Thorne, who confessed that he himself had made a lot of bad choices. But Thorne knew this choice was right. Macy wept that it wasn't right for her father and that Thorne didn't understand what he was asking Macy to do. Thorne said he and Macy belonged together, and the biggest mistake he had made was doubting that. Macy didn't doubt it, so Thorne asked her to look at him and admit what her heart was telling her to do, then and there. As Macy was about to speak, Lorenzo rushed in and demanded Macy not listen to Thorne because Thorne was lying to her.\n\n\nTo the strains of Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture,\" Clarke announced Ridge's showstopper for Spectra Fashions. Salvos of confetti erupted, and a giant banner with Sally's picture on it unfurled at the back of the runway. Massimo groaned, while Eric, Stephanie, and Ridge's groans were more playful. Clarke, Sally, and Darla laughed. Then, as the music changed to \"In a Dream\" by Above the Clouds, Sofia floated down the runway in a sumptuous wedding dress adorned with intricate stylings. Sally grabbed Ridge's arm and happily disbelieved that Eric could top the design. Ridge didn't look happy about Sally's pronouncement.\n\n\nTo close the challenge, Stephanie stood at the edge of the pier/runway and teased that the audience was about to see the most elegant design of any showing. She waved to the water, and Josh Groban's \"To Where You Are\" began. Everyone turned to see a boat sailing toward them, aboard which a woman stood in a magnificent bridal gown, her veil covered in glittering jewels. Stephanie was shocked and Massimo chagrined to see that the model was Brooke. Ridge smiled as Brooke's boat drew closer to the dock, and he applauded meaningfully, though Sally, Clarke, and Darla's applause was more grudging.\n\n\nMacy told Lorenzo she was only at the church to say goodbye to Thorne. Lorenzo knew Thorne was trying to convince Macy to stay. Thorne grumbled to Lorenzo that Macy could make up her own mind. Lorenzo maintained that Thorne couldn't be trusted and that Thorne didn't love her. Lorenzo reminded Macy that she had been broken and empty when she'd arrived in Camogli. Over time, her body had healed, and she had stopped drinking.\n\n\nLorenzo told Macy she had built a good life in Italy and was stronger than ever -- and that if she wanted to continue standing on her own, she needed to walk away from Thorne. Lorenzo informed Macy that her father was waiting for them, and it was time for them to go. Macy saw Thorne's pleading look and appeared conflicted.\n\n\nEveryone from Forrester and Spectra received uproarious applause from the competition's attendees. The announcer, Riccardo, proclaimed that both houses had dazzled the spectators, as evidenced by their cheers. He asked his colleague, Rebecca, to do the honors. Rebecca opened an envelope and prepared to reveal the winner of the Portofino Challenge. Ridge and Eric eyed each other knowingly, all smiles.\n\n\n",
