    "tvmega_recap": "Hope shows Wyatt that the flower opened. He says it must be from the warmth of her hand. She chuckles that flowers close at night and open in daytime. He says it must have seen her shining. He tells Hope they could change their minds and still go out. She says she still can not handle that right now. He gets a phone call which he ignores. She says it might be his mother checking on them. He says his mother wants him to be happy and she also thinks Wyatt can make Hope happy too. She adds and Quinn didn't think that might happen by chance. He says he's not going to make excuses for his mom for being underhanded if that is the way it goes down. He thinks Quinn just felt that Hope had the right to know what was going on with Steffy. Hope says Liam said it was nothing and she believes him. He says but if nothing makes her run for the hills, what does that tell her. She says she knows. What Liam said made total sense but she still couldn't go back with him and she knew Steffy would always be there. She needs to let that go and open up to the rest of her life. She says it's hard. She always thought her life was headed in one direction and now it's not. He offers her a suggestion. He kisses her. He says L.A. is great but here they have the palm trees swaying, the waves crashing and no horns or sirens blaring, just the rare force of nature. They kiss again. He tells her they can analyze what happened between Liam and Steffy twenty different ways or they can just let it blow away. He says he could say a lot of things to her but they would just be meaningless words and would not say this. He kisses her passionately again. She pulls him in for a second one. Then she pulls away and says she is sorry. He says no, it's all right. He's going to enjoy himself every little step and nibble along the way. He gives a devilish smile and she wants to know what he is thinking. He says she doesn't want to know but then tells her he just had a vision of them in an outrigger canoe making love. Sorry but that is where his mind went. He says they are going to be here a while so they need to get started. He picks her up and she giggles, but adds that she wants to take this slowly. He lets her down gently and says yes the first time needs to be special ..and it will be. He kisses her again. Rick calls the gang together in his office and tells them to take a deep breath, the holidays are behind them. They will be working on the spring line. Ridge walks in and congratulates them for all being here. They need to focus on what is next. It's soon clear that Rick and Ridge are not on the same page. Ridge says HFTF is changing their identity and they can\u0091t afford that. Couture is what made his father's name. The ready to wear line is fantastic, but they came later. They can not be center stage. The public and buyers are looking at them and thinking they are committed to the young market instead of them. Rick says all he has done is preach couture but that market just isn't cutting it. Dad gave him one goal to increase sales any way he could. This team here smashed that goal. Ridge says he is not telling them that wasn't great but they must get back to re-branding what made them great in the first place. What they need now is some bold new designs. Rick sarcastically says what they need obviously is Ridge as their savior. Ridge says sounds like the two of them need to talk. Rick says might as well since Ridge is not going to let him continue the meeting that he has planned for weeks. Brooke tells Katie that Ridge knows everything and she is sure Ridge mentioned that to her. Katie says Brooke knows they have always gotten along, so how is Bill. Brooke says Katie knows she is not still seeing him. He still keeps coming around although she tells him not to. Katie says obviously Brooke wants something from her so just tell her what it is. Brooke says Katie must know how much she wants to rebuild hr life with Ridge. Katie pretends not to be interested, whatever Brooke says. Brooke says Katie knows how devastated she was when she came back alone from her honeymoon. None of this would have happened if Ridge hadn't left her. Katie says there is not a very big correlation between what Brooke says and what she does. Brooke says she would like this resentment ad hostility between them to change as she has told Bill to stay away. Katie says and yet he keeps ringing her door bell and she lets him in. Brooke says she should not have come. Katie says but she did; she wants both men. She sees her sister's objective. She wants to give Katie back her husband like some old sweater that she borrowed and beat up, but she's not going to have that. Brooke says she knows Katie wants Bill's job, she wants to be super-mom and prove to the whole world that she can do everything. That's great but is she happy in this big old house alone. Katie says and Brooke must think she'd really like to be sleeping by a man each night that had really rather be sleeping with Brooke. Katie says Brooke only wants to park Bill there because it will be more comfortable for Ridge who does not like competition. And the bonus is Brooke gets to look like she is cleaning up her mess at the same time. Brooke says she knows Ridge has his reservations, but she told him everything and he wants to come home. Rick tells Ridge he's dying to now when is he going back to International. Ridge says he has bad news for him. He's not going anywhere. Thorne has taken over that job and is on his way as they speak. Brooke calls and wants to see Ridge when he can pull himself away. Rick tells him to feel free to go and he'll know later if he is blissfully happy or just gonna wipe his shoes off on Brooke. Ridge asks why Rick didn't do something about Brooke and her sister's husband. Rick scoffs that Ridge had left her. He cut her loose and she was drowning. He doesn't think Ridge has any right to criticize her how she kept from going under. And Katie herself is not blameless in this. Ridge says that is fair. When he decided to come home; home was Brooke. Now he doesn't know what it means anymore. Caroline asks Rick how bad was his meeting with Ridge. He says Ridge got a call so anti-climax. She asks if he wants her to beat Ridge up? He's such a gentleman that he probably won't even hit her back. He tells her that Ridge is not going back to International. She says yeah the whole building is buzzing about Thorne going instead. It'll be great for him and an opportunity for Brooke to win Ridge back if he can come to terms with her being with her uncle Bill. Brooke gets the bedroom ready but Ridge arrives early and catches her by surprise. He comments that she never changed the locks on the door so he came on in. She says so many nights and she'd wake up and swear she heard his key in the door. He says his key, did Bill's sound differently? She tells him that Hope is in Hawaii and RJ at Ojai and this is like old times when they would lock themselves away in this room, away from the whole world. And they never hid anything from each other. They had this unspoken language. She puts her arms around his face and he recoils slightly. She says welcome home to her dear beautiful husband. She's waited so long for this moment and now it is finally here."
