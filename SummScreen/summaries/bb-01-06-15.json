    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Rick and Caroline emotionally discussed their marriage. Rick lamented that Caroline had turned to Ridge. Caroline argued that she had remained faithful to Rick. Rick regretted that everyone wanted marriage to last forever, but no one had actually made it work.\n\n\nCaroline disagreed. She pointed to her mothers. She promised to make their marriage work because she knew how to do it. Rick insisted that he couldn't turn back the clock \"and love you like I used to,\" he said tearfully.\n\n\nCaroline countered that Rick had promised to love her till death, and she intended to hold him to it. Rick tearfully said that it was too late and too hard. \"I don't care that it's too hard. Don't leave,\" Caroline commanded.\n\n\nRick asked Caroline to stop talking because she seemed clueless and knew so little about him. He recalled that Caroline had defended her actions with Ridge as just a few kisses, but the actual translation was that she had no idea how many kisses.\n\n\nRick continued that Caroline had justified that Ridge had been mentoring her and that he hadn't been able to draw. Rick was convinced that it had been a series of lies that had become public humiliation of Rick for everyone's entertainment.\n\n\nRick further insulted Caroline. He said that if she'd \"hiked that skirt up for the mailman,\" he'd have been able to forgive her. Caroline shot back that Maya had engineered the public humiliation. Caroline added that she'd been sincere in her effort to help Ridge because he'd been injured.\n\n\nRick said that women who'd been involved with Ridge never forgot him. Rick warned that Ridge had broken hearts his entire life, and Rick had needed to dry too many tears since he'd been a kid -- all because of Ridge. Caroline insisted she and Ridge were over, but Rick maintained that women were never done with Ridge Forrester.\n\n\n\"Are we done here?\" Rick asked. Caroline angrily advised Rick that she wasn't like any girl he'd ever known, and she wasn't the \"standard issue wife.\" She shouted that he'd insulted her with his comments about hiking up her skirt for the mailman. She realized that she'd hurt him to his core, but she wanted a life with the man she loved. She knew him better than anyone else, and she knew that he was not happy.\n\n\nCaroline didn't believe that he was proud of himself for what he'd done to the people he loved. \"You made a fool of your father,\" she said, declaring, \"You win. You proved you are the meanest, and you got us all.\"\n\n\nCaroline maintained that Rick could change it all. She demanded that Rick undo what he'd done. He'd earned respect, and he'd been a leader at Forrester. \"You can't just throw that away. I won't let you,\" she shouted. Rick sorrowfully shook his head.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Maya told Ivy that they should be friends. Ivy was surprised, but Maya suggested that Ivy had been \"besties\" with the boss's wife. Maya said she would soon be the boss's wife. Maya added that she'd almost felt sorry for Caroline. Ivy scoffed. Maya said she had things to take care of at home.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office at Forrester, Eric lamented that he'd made a huge mistake in signing the contract. Carter said that there was no way out of the contract. Ridge said there was -- because of fraud. Rick had fooled everyone with what he had done to Caroline. Carter said it wouldn't hold up in court, but Ridge insisted it was a family business, and Rick had misrepresented what he had planned.\n\n\nEric disagreed. He refused to appear before a judge and admit that he'd advised Rick to get back together with Caroline or lose his job. Eric lamented that he'd had no right, and it had been foolishness. \"It was an invitation for Rick to lie to me,\" Eric said.\n\n\nRidge angrily said that Eric was making excuses, and Rick had scammed them. Ridge advised Eric not to say it was only for a year. Eric claimed he wasn't excusing Rick, but Ridge shook his head. Carter promised to file a petition to nullify the contract, and he left.\n\n\nRidge accused his father of creating a monster. \"Rick would say the same about you,\" Eric shot back. Eric and Ridge engaged in a dramatic exchange that recycled a lifetime of past arguments. Ridge accused Eric of having a guilty conscience and giving Rick power because Eric had spent more time with Stephanie than with Brooke, Rick, and Bridget.\n\n\nRidge insisted that he and Eric had been rivals for Stephanie's attention, and Eric said that Ridge had always won that battle. Ridge reminded his father that Rick had stabbed him in the back. \"As if you never did,\" Eric replied.\n\n\nEric asked if they wanted to resurrect that tired argument. Ridge shook his head. Eric noted that Ridge and Rick had never gotten along. Eric pointed out that Ridge had flirted with Caroline for all the wrong reasons. He hadn't liked being impaired, and he hadn't liked that he'd needed her help, so \"he exerted power over her, and it worked a little too well,\" Eric said.\n\n\nAt Eric's, Ivy prepared to enter the house, but she flashed back to Rick's threats that she would lose her job if she opened her mouth about Maya and Rick. Ivy flashed back to Maya's warning that Maya and Rick had history long before Caroline had been in the picture. Ivy opened the door, and the foyer was filled with boxes.\n\n\nMaya directed movers to place furnishings in Rick's study and the master bedroom. Ivy was shocked that Maya was not only moving in but kicking Eric out of his bedroom. Ivy asked if Maya had even asked for Eric's permission. Maya replied that she had Eric Forrester Junior's permission. Ivy was surprised.\n\n\nIvy told Maya that she and Aly didn't want to live with Maya and Rick. Maya reminded Ivy that it was a big house. Ivy promised to find solutions. \"Aly and I are Forresters, and you're still a wannabe,\" Ivy fired back.\n\n\nMovers carried Caroline's clothes from the guest house into the main house, but Maya told them to remove them. Maya insisted that she wanted to be Ivy's friend. \"And I usually get what I want,\" Maya said.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline tells Rick they are married and he can't just quit. He retorts that she should have thought of that before Ridge. He continues that he can't turn back the clock and love her like he used to. She says fine. She will take how he loves her now. She will take the anger and the hurt and all the lies. She reminds him that he said he would love her until death do they part and she is going to make him keep that promise. He counters that sometimes it is just too damn late. She argues more that is what people tell themselves when it gets too hard. But she doesn't care, she will work on it anyway. She will work on it for both of them, just he can not leave. Carter tells Eric they do not have a grace period. Eric says he knows he told Carter they would not need that so this is all on him. Ridge is disgusted that his dad is accepting this that Rick has scammed them. And he keeps saying it is only for a year. Ridge says with Rick and Maya running the place at that time it will be a war zone. Eric declares that Rick is not that destructive. All he wants is a chance and he is willing to give that to him. Ridge says of course he always does, it's Rick they are talking about. Maya tells Ivy that she thinks they ought to be friends. Ivy says she doesn't see how as all Maya has done since she had known her is prove how untrustworthy she is. Maya thinks that is a little harsh and Ivy only wanted to be friend's with the boss's wife but Caroline won't be that much longer so she could be Maya's friend then. Ivy says she does not see them as friends even in the future. Maya says she realizes Ivy doesn't like her and she doesn't disguise her feelings. Her honesty is risk free because she is being bought and paid for. When she gets back to Eric's house, Ivy is shocked that Maya is directing traffic for the movers to put boxes in the master bedroom. She asks Ivy if she has a problem with that. This is Rick's father's house and he has a right to take over while Eric is away. Maya says there is no eviction notice on the door. The house is big enough for all of them. Ivy says she thinks she should have been asked if she wanted to live with Maya. And while Maya is trying to stay so positive just remember that Ivy and Aly are Forresters and Maya is just a wannabee. Caroline asks Rick how many times does she have to say she was wrong. He says she does not know him obviously and he is tired of explaining it to her. He tells her to stop as the more she talks the more clueless she sounds. It was a few kisses, then a lie and she let it blossom. And he could forgive her of many things but not with Ridge. Ridge tells Eric he is just having a guilty conscious for how Rick was raised and is willing to give him a pass now. Eric says Rick could say the same about him. Ridge tells it like it is that Eric has always been this way, making rivals of Ridge and Rick. Eric doesn't remember it that way. Eric reminds him that he exerted his power over Caroline and it worked too well. Rick tells Caroline that she used to defend him against Ridge so she knows how he treats people. The great artist needed Caroline and only her so now she is on his side. Now he will not be there for her when Ridge breaks her heart. She tells him what little there was is over. He scoffs, no woman is ever over Ridge Forrester. Maya tells Ivy that she is not taking anyway anything from Ivy so for now can they at least be civil. She usually gets what she wants. Ivy says she can see that. Caroline tells Rick that she is not like any girl he has ever known. She is taking all of this scorn as if she hiked her skirt for the mailman but she has not been unfaithful like him. And she will not accept this and will not give up on the man that she loves. He used his father today and pretends he is proud of himself but she knows he hates it. They may be furious with each other but both know how strong their love is. He has tears in his eyes as she says she will not let him do this.",
