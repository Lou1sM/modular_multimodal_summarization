    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Wyatt was impressed by some numbers he saw, and he couldn't wait to show Eric at the meeting that day. Wyatt snapped the distracted Steffy out of thought to ask when the meeting was, and he guessed that she was still thinking of what Liam had said. Steffy admitted that she was beginning to think it wasn't a bad idea to keep her private life private.\n\n\nWyatt exclaimed that Steffy's influence on social media was skyrocketing. Steffy didn't know if she was supposed to feel good about it if Liam was in pain over it. She instructed Wyatt to head out for the meeting while she wrapped things up at the office.\n\n\nLater, Steffy was on the phone with Thomas to let him know she'd set up at his loft until the divorce went through. She pretended to be fine during the call, but upon ending it, she sighed in disillusionment. She flashed back to Liam welcoming her home, and she almost cried.\n\n\nIn the design office, Liam complained to Ridge about feeling disconnected from Steffy. Liam didn't think he and Steffy could discuss or even argue about things anymore. \"That's Quinn. Everyone's dancing to her tune,\" Ridge replied. Liam could feel Steffy slipping away. There wasn't anything he could do about it, but he said that Ridge could -- if he was still up for it.\n\n\nRidge had been having second thoughts about the plan, but after the encounter he'd had with his father, he realized that Eric didn't see Quinn the way Liam and Ridge did. Ridge was sure that Eric would get burned. Liam asked if it meant Ridge would go through with it. Ridge didn't think he had a choice, because Quinn had Eric all tied up and could do whatever she wanted.\n\n\nLiam found it ironic that Steffy had walked out on him and Wyatt for the same reason -- Quinn. Ridge believed Steffy was blind, like Eric; however, Ridge said he'd like to believe that Steffy could hear Liam and knew what he was going through. Liam had no care for himself. What terrified him was that, every day, Steffy got closer to Quinn.\n\n\nLiam wanted to get Steffy out of there before she was too brainwashed to see the truth. Liam said Steffy was getting sucked in more and more, and it had started with the CEO position, which Liam couldn't believe Steffy had taken after all Quinn had done to them.\n\n\nRidge understood the opportunity presented to Steffy and said Quinn had understood it, too. Liam noted that Quinn had fame, power, influence, and Eric cheering for her. Liam saw Steffy gradually changing and becoming more accepting of Quinn.\n\n\nRidge left the room, and Liam flashed back on times with Steffy. Ridge returned and said it wasn't over. Liam felt that it was drifting in that direction. He'd never felt that way with Steffy before. He felt that Steffy was loyal to him, \"but she's still human, and I'm losing her.\"\n\n\nRidge said he was working on it. Liam feared that Quinn was just taunting and teasing Ridge because she knew what he was up to, and she'd never cross the line. Ridge believed Quinn would do it, and Eric would never see her the same way again. Liam felt that Eric, Quinn, and Wyatt were ganging up on him and tempting Steffy by offering her the world. \"Don't fall for it, Steffy,\" Liam said.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Eric was telling Quinn how bad the argument with Ridge had been. Eric had thought things would improve after the holiday, but he'd been wrong. Quinn asked what Ridge's complaint had been that time, but Eric was so frustrated that he didn't even want to get into it.\n\n\nQuinn suggested that they talk about something positive. Eric said thinking of their relationship made him smile. Quinn felt she could do more than make him smile. She said that they were family, and even though they'd momentarily lost Ridge, they had Wyatt and Steffy.\n\n\nEric said the couple might be on the verge of rediscovery. Quinn attributed it to him, but he said that all he'd done was tell them how he viewed loyalty and commitment. Quinn said that it had stuck, and Steffy had moved out of Liam's house. Quinn asked Eric if it would be wonderful if Steffy moved into the mansion with them and Wyatt.\n\n\nEric stated that it would take more convincing to accomplish it. Quinn relayed that Steffy listened to him and responded to him. Eric didn't want Steffy to feel pressured. Quinn understood but said the divorce was getting closer by the day. Quinn asked if he wanted his granddaughter to live there. Eric did, but he started to say what had happened when he'd asked. Quinn cut him off, suggesting that he ask again.\n\n\nQuinn reasoned that Eric had already given Steffy a lot, and it wouldn't be much more. She said Steffy was living out of a suitcase but could have her own suite. Eric added that Steffy would be with her husband, and she'd be at home. Quinn stated that they'd be saving a marriage. Eric concluded that they were on the same page, and he absolutely agreed.\n\n\nWyatt arrived with equipment to set up a presentation. Quinn said they'd just been talking about him and Steffy, and she and Eric believed that, if they worked together, they could get Steffy to move into the mansion. \"And then you and she can move on with your life,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nLater, Steffy arrived for the meeting. Eric said that, before they got started, he wanted to acknowledge how hard but necessary for Steffy's position the assignment to move out of Liam's house had been. Steffy replied that her relationship with Liam wasn't on the agenda, and she just wanted to get the meeting started.\n\n\nEric handed the floor to Wyatt, who stood by the fireplace with his equipment and a covered easel beside him. He asked why he'd been working so hard on the social media campaign. The brand was excelling with Steffy in the spotlight, but Wyatt had created the media storm for one reason -- sales.\n\n\nWyatt turned on his laptop. On it played a video montage of Steffy laughing and modeling in footage Wyatt had taken in Los Angeles and in Monte Carlo. The female voiceover said that, like \"you,\" Steffy was no ordinary woman. After each sentence the woman said, a male's voice whispered, \"Steffy Beverly Hills...\" The woman said, \"Like you, an individual with hopes and dreams....And like you, they're all coming true. Steffy Beverly Hills.\"\n\n\nIn between the Steffy clips on the video, there were flashes of cosmetics and perfume with a purple \"S\" and \"Steffy of Beverly Hills\" as their logo. The video ended with a spray of perfume into black space and the Steffy of Beverly Hills Logo appeared.\n\n\n\"Reaction?\" Wyatt asked in the silence. Steffy asked if it was a new product line and if they were supposed to go through R and D for it. Wyatt replied that he kind of already had. \"Without telling the CEO?\" she asked. Wyatt replied that he'd wanted to, but he'd also wanted it to be a surprise. Steffy stated that it certainly was. She smiled in wonder and said she was blown away.\n\n\nSteffy and Wyatt exchanged smiles, and Quinn asked for Steffy's feedback. Steffy asked if Wyatt had done it on his own. Wyatt said that his mother had helped with fragrance samples. Eric added that Wyatt and Quinn had been working on it behind the scenes for quite some time.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Eric had known about it. \"I know about everything,\" he replied. He added that he especially knew her thoughts and how she was feeling.\n\n\nWyatt directed the topic back to his pitch. He let Steffy smell the perfume, and she detected lilac in it. Steffy was still shocked that Wyatt hadn't even hinted to her. He said that she had a lot on her plate, and it was what she hired professionals like him to handle. Handing her a contract, Eric said the deal was generous and offered growth for Forrester, as well.\n\n\nOn the top of the contract was attached a check made out to Steffy from Forrester for one million dollars. Steffy gasped. Handing her the perfume, Wyatt said it was just the start. \"My own brand,\" she said. He corrected that she was the brand. He said people followed her because she was incredible, and she radiated confidence, fun, and power. He believed that every man wanted to be around it, particularly her husband.\n\n\nEric told Steffy they were a team. They fed off each other, which meant they had to stay close. \"Stay close?\" Steffy asked. Eric asked her again to move into the mansion. Steffy flashed back to telling Liam that she'd be back at the cliff house once the divorce was final.\n\n\nEric said the house had spun wonderful chapters in the history of Forrester, and the next one could be the best one ever. \"If we work together,\" Quinn added. Wyatt conveyed that it was a lot to absorb, and Eric and Quinn had just dropped it on him before the meeting. After he'd thought about it, he'd concluded that it was a wonderful idea, plus he'd be living with his wife again. Steffy thought of memories with Liam and when he'd said he'd fought his way back to her and couldn't imagine his life without her.\n\n\nEric wanted Steffy to see something. He pulled a cloth off the easel near the fireplace. Steffy's mouth dropped as she viewed a portrait of herself that he'd unveiled. Eric announced that the house could be her home one day, and it would be if she did it with them \"now.\" He said the portrait of her would go over the mantel.\n\n\nQuinn hoped that Steffy could see by then that Quinn really loved Eric, and she and Eric could be good for Steffy. Eric asked Steffy to remember the good in her marriage to Wyatt, and he believed it wouldn't be hard to do. Eric said to think of how good it would be to be married to Wyatt again.\n\n\nWyatt remembered how Steffy had changed his life, and he said the days had been some of happiest in his life. He still believed that they could be together. Wyatt referenced his love/hate relationship with his mother and said he'd felt that way when Eric and Quinn had sprung the Steffy moving in thing on him earlier.\n\n\nWyatt said that Steffy was right that Quinn had manipulated their marriage and right in her feelings about Quinn's past actions. Wyatt asked Steffy to see that Quinn had changed and how happy Eric and Quinn were together. Wyatt reasoned that nothing had gotten between Steffy and Wyatt except his mother, and he and Steffy had been \"damn good\" together. All he wanted was another chance to try.\n\n\nEric told Steffy that the four of them were the power of Forrester Creations, and there was nothing they couldn't accomplish together. Eric advised her to give her marriage to Wyatt another go. Quinn asked what Steffy had to say. Eric said to move back home, and Quinn echoed the sentiment.\n\n\nAs Steffy stared at Wyatt, Quinn said Steffy belonged in the house on the hill with her grandfather -- and her husband. Wyatt uttered that he wanted to be with Steffy and support her in her life. He said there was nothing they couldn't accomplish together. He asserted that they couldn't fail with family supporting them. He asked Steffy to return to where she belonged and to give him another chance.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Wyatt enthuses about the great feedback Steffy is receiving on social media as a result of the new marketing campaign. Frustrated that he is losing Steffy as each day passes, Liam pressures Ridge to act on his plan to get Quinn out of their lives. At the Forrester Mansion, Quinn and Eric marvel at the prospect of Steffy moving into the house and getting back together with her husband. Right on cue, Wyatt and Steffy arrive for a business meeting. Then, Wyatt makes a presentation to Steffy about creating her own brand \"Steffy of Beverly Hills\". Steffy is speechless by the effort Wyatt put into the campaign and possible products like a fragrance line. Eric and Quinn urge her to acknowledge the obvious: they make a great team and should be together. Will Steffy buy into this imploration or hang on to her devotion to Liam?",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy is off in some dream world and does not hear what Wyatt is asking he \u0096 when is their meeting with Eric. She says soon and he remarks that Liam was wrong. There is nothing wrong with their campaign and she does not have to be more private. The interaction she has right now on social media is skyrocketing. She says she knows and Liam is in pain and she is supposed to feel good about that. She tells Wyatt to go on to the meeting as she has a few things to finish up. Liam whines to Ridge again that he feels so disconnected. It used to be he could discuss things with Steffy, even argue about them but now it's all about Quinn. He says he can feel Steffy slipping away and there is not a damn thing he can do about it. But there is something Ridge can do if he is still up for it. Ridge says he has no choice, she has Eric all tied up. Liam agrees and more and more every day Steffy is accepting Quinn. Waiting for the meeting, Eric tells Quinn that it was horrible. He and Ridge have had their differences but this was the worst. She knows it was about her. He laments that he was hoping after the holidays they would get better but he thinks they never will now. When he doesn't want to talk about it she says they can talk about something positive. He says okay \u0096 something solid about them that he can smile about. She says they may have lost Ridge for the moment but he has Wyatt and Steffy in large part due to him. He says all he told Steffy was what he believed would be good for her. Quinn agrees, it would be so good if she were to move in here with them and Wyatt. She respects Eric and listens to him so give her a chance. She's living out of a suitcase now and could have her own suite. Wyatt comes in laden down with boxes ready for showtime. Steffy talks to Thomas on the phone and says she is fine but she has moved back to his loft until her divorce is final. Liam comments to Ridge that he sees it happening every day more and more that Quinn has Steffy brainwashed. They definitely have to get her out of there. Steffy is late and apologizes but wants to get right to the meeting. Eric says Wyatt has a presentation first and he realizes just how hard this is on Steffy to move out on Liam but it was best with her new position. Wyatt remarks about Steffy's beauty and intelligence and how far this will take them, but there is something more \u0096 the brand for FC. And that can be summed up in one word \u0096 sales. He turns on the laptop and shows them S for Steffy, a brand all her own. She smells it and likes the tiny smell of lilac. But shouldn't they go through R&D and he says he kinda already did ..even without telling her. She says she is surprised but she is blown away. Wyatt says it is her brand and people are inspired by her ..the confidence and the power, something every woman wants to be and every man wants to be around .and one in particular .her husband. Liam asks Ridge what if Quinn is toying with him. She taunts him but she never crosses the line. Ridge says yes this time she is going to cross that line. And her whole world will fall apart and Eric will never look at her the same way again. Eric tells Steffy that they need to stay close, be a team. She has already moved out on Liam so just move on in here. Wyatt says he knows this is sudden; he only heard about it before this meeting but he thinks it is a great idea. Eric says in time he has something to show her, her portrait will go over the mantle. Quinn says surely Steffy can see how good she and Eric are together. Eric adds that even Steffy can see the good things she had with Wyatt and can still have. Wyatt steps forward and says she changed his life and brought him some of the happiest days he has ever had. He goes on that he knows Steffy blames Quinn for manipulating them into getting married but she has changed from the past, just look at her. She and Eric are good together and she cannot deny that so he is asking her just to give it another try. Eric says again to give her marriage to Wyatt another go, there is nothing the four of them can not accomplish. Wyatt agrees there is nothing they cannot accomplish and that is all he wants. They will be with family and cannot fail so just come back to him. Liam thinks aloud \u0096 Steffy is being ganged up on by Quinn, Eric and Wyatt. With a conflicted look on her face, Wyatt tells Steffy to come home to him.",
