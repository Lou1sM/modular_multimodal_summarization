    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the outdoor caf\u00e9, Marcus and Justin discussed Caroline's fall. Marcus guessed it was interesting working for a protective man who didn't play fair. Justin said he could be just as protective as Bill could be, but Marcus replied that Justin didn't do the messed up stuff Bill did to get his way.\n\n\nMarcus' mind trailed into deep thought about the time his father had \"butt-dialed\" him, and he'd overheard Bill scheming to sabotage Hope's wedding. Marcus then mentioned that his father had never said what had happened to Hope's wedding as a result of the sabotage mentioned on that call.\n\n\nJustin asked if Marcus had told anyone about the call, and Marcus claimed he hadn't. Justin said it had been a personal and private conversation that he wouldn't want others knowing about.\n\n\nIn the Forrester's CEO office, Hope and Dayzee discussed Hope's talks with Bill, Liam, and Steffy. Hope felt as if her relationship with Liam had been sabotaged from the beginning. \"Sabotaged,\" Dayzee thoughtfully repeated and flashed back to her and Marcus' past suspicions about what Bill might do in Italy. Hope figured she was being paranoid, but Dayzee said Hope might be onto something.\n\n\nDayzee wasn't sure she should tell Hope what was on Dayzee's mind, but then Dayzee decided that Hope needed to know. Dayzee explained to Hope about Marcus' past worries after overhearing Bill and Justin using the word \"sabotage\" while discussing Hope's Italy wedding. Hope didn't think that made any sense because Bill had been very supportive at the wedding.\n\n\nHope recalled that she'd had a string of weird coincidences that day. Flashbacks played as Hope gave Dayzee a rundown of all the delays Hope had experienced in Italy that day -- from seeing Deacon, to the car leaving her, to the roadblock. Hope then realized that there hadn't been any coincidences; she really had been sabotaged -- and Bill had been behind all of it.\n\n\nHope didn't know what Bill had done, but she said his fingerprints had been all over it. She was furious that he'd had the nerve to pretend to accept her at the wedding. Hope recalled the gondola incident and Steffy's blood clot, and Dayzee asked what Hope was going to do about it. \"Get even,\" Hope vowed, grabbing her keys. Dayzee advised Hope to think about it before confronting Bill; however, Hope was determined to make sure Bill knew that he hadn't succeeded in his plan.\n\n\nHope left, and later, Marcus arrived. As he kissed Dayzee, he could tell that she was distracted. She admitted that she'd just told Hope about what he'd overheard on that accidental phone call from his father. Marcus informed Dayzee that he'd just talked to his father about that very subject, and Justin had made it clear that he hadn't wanted anyone to know about that call.\n\n\nDayzee was sorry to have gotten Marcus in trouble, but she felt that Hope had needed to know.  Dayzee relayed that Hope was on her way to confront Bill about what he'd done. Sighing, Marcus murmured that Bill would rip Hope apart. Dayzee didn't think so because Hope was on a mission.\n\n\nIn the Spencers' living room, a circle of women closed in on Bill. He said he'd love to hear how they'd arrived at the conclusion that his drinking had precipitated Caroline's accident. Dani added that it was also his temper. Bill exclaimed that was ridiculous, and they were wasting his time.\n\n\nBill insisted that Caroline's fall hadn't resulted from his drinking. \"So she just toppled over?\" Dani quipped.  Bill looked to Brooke for her opinion. Brooke said everyone knew Bill loved his family, and Caroline's fall had been an accident. Taylor added that the accident had been the catalyst, but no one had gathered there to accuse him of hurting Caroline. \"Thank you, Taylor,\" Bill snickered.\n\n\nBill figured that Taylor's words had confirmed that there was no need for the meeting, and he suggested that they focus all their energy on Caroline's recovery. He tried to exit, but Katie coaxed him to sit on the sofa. Everyone else took seats, and Taylor suggested they start with the incident on the tennis court, where things had gotten heated.\n\n\nBill stated that Caroline had done something that she shouldn't have done, but Karen and Dani suspected the true issue was that Bill didn't want Liam with Hope. Bill asked to talk to his wife alone, but Karen disagreed with dividing the group. Brooke said the couple should be able to talk alone, but Taylor interjected that it was only if Katie wanted to do it, too.\n\n\nKatie agreed with it, and she and Bill went to the foyer. He asked why she was subjecting him to that meeting. Katie explained that she was doing it for them to make up for her mistakes during her bout of depression. Bill understood her feelings, but he didn't want to continue the meeting. Katie asserted that the family loved Bill, and it was time to get a handle on his control issues.\n\n\nBill said he could handle anything, but he told Katie not to speak about Deacon. Bill admitted that he'd had a huge lapse in judgment with Deacon, and he claimed he wasn't that person anymore. Katie agreed, but he added that if Hope found out about it, he could go to prison. Katie grimly nodded.\n\n\nBill and Katie rejoined the group, and Karen and Dani implored Bill to stop bullying people and trying to control his family. Everyone thought Liam was a good example to demonstrate that, and Taylor asked Brooke to say what she thought of Bill trying to control Liam. Brooke scoffed at being put on the spot, but she claimed that all of them had been too involved in Liam, Hope, and Steffy's issues.\n\n\nBill said it wasn't about Hope, but Karen asserted that it was about Bill's interference in Liam, Hope, and Steffy's relationships. Bill got a call, but Katie told him that it had to wait. He answered the phone anyway. It was Hope, who was standing outside the front gate of the estate. She demanded that Bill open the gate because they needed to talk.  \"Not now,\" he said and clicked off the line.\n\n\nStill at the entrance, Hope punched numbers into the security box but failed to guess the code. Then she pressed the dollar symbol four times, and the gates swung open for her.\n\n\nBack in Bill's living room, Bill told all the women that they'd won, and he'd become well aware of his shortcomings. Karen replied that his words weren't good enough. He claimed that he appreciated everyone's concerns, but he and Katie were having ongoing discussions about his control issues. As far as the drinking, he reasoned that a controlling person like him wouldn't let scotch be in control.\n\n\nThe women stared at Bill in disbelief. He admitted that he liked to have a few drinks, but he didn't get drunk. Everyone kept staring at him, and he asked Katie if she'd seen him drunk. Katie shook her head, and Bill said the time for him to drink had been during Katie's postpartum depression absence. He asked Brooke to vouch for him, and Brooke readily said he hadn't been drinking during that time. Taylor looked at Brooke as if Brooke were crazy for her constant defense of Bill.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and Bill went to answer it. Upon seeing Hope standing on the stoop beside his golf bag, he stepped outside, closed the door behind him, and hustled her onto the driveway. He demanded that she get off his property, and he returned inside the house.\n\n\nHope looked into the golf bag and contemplated which club was best. \"Driver...Better go with the 3-iron,\" she decided and snatched it out of the bag.\n\n\nBack inside the house, Bill returned to the meeting and again apologized to the ladies for his temper. He claimed he'd do everything within his power to make it up to Caroline. Karen looked disgusted, but Bill grinned, asking, \"We all good?\"\n\n\nJust then, glass shattered from the terrace doors, and everyone shrieked and ducked. From outside, Hope unlocked the broken door and entered the living room with the 3-iron in hand. Panicked, Brooke asked what Hope was doing. As if it were a sword, Hope pointed the club at Bill and declared that she was about to tee off on him. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells the family intervention group that his drinking had nothing to do with Caroline's accident. This is ridiculous for him to stay and listen to them. He says it is unfortunate, but they are all gathered here as family and friends and now they just need to focus on Caroline's recovery. He tries to leave, but Katie grabs his arm and wants them all to sit down and talk. Bill says Caroline did something that she shouldn't have. Suddenly Katie wants to speak to him alone. She tells him that she made many mistakes but she is trying to right them now. She wants to be the best mother and woman that she can be. She wants him to be the best man he can. He says he will be and he can put up with most anything except he does not want her to bring up Deacon in Italy. He could go to prison for arranging that and he knows she does not want that. Marcus has lunch with Justin and remembers the word \"sabotage\" when Justin accidentally but called him and mentioned to Bill that Liam and Hope were sabotaged. At the same time Dayzee tells Hope that she agrees with Hope that their relationship was sabotaged. Marcus told her about a conversation he overheard between Bill and Justin. Hope finds it hard to believe that Bill could have had anything to do with all the chaos in Italy. It was just one coincidence after another .unless it really wasn't coincidences and they were indeed sabotaged. Like a light bulb going off, Hope sees that this has Bill's fingerprints all over it. She's not even going to bother telling Liam; she will go straight to Bill. The gang tells Bill again that he has control issues if he doesn't want to take responsibility for any part his drinking might have had in recent events. Before they are through, Hope is outside and calls Bill on the phone and says they must talk. He says it is not a good time ..he's in the middle of something. She tells him to open the gates; it must be now. When he doesn't, she figures out the gate code system herself and goes in. Dayzee questions Marcus about what he overheard about the sabotage. They both agree that it is strange that they both are thinking about that. She tells Marcus that Hope is on a mission. Big Dollar Bill is gonna have his hands full. Bill says he knows he has a control issue. He and Katie have had many talks about it. Brooke agrees they need to cut Bill some slack. He is not a drunk. Bill says if he was ever going to turn to booze it would have been when Katie left him. She begs him to be the best parents they can be. The doorbell rings and Bill gets it. He grabs Hope by the arm and tries to hustle her off his property. She takes only a breath, spies the golf clubs sitting outside the door and grabs one. Bill thanks Katie for putting up with him. Suddenly the window is being smashed as Hope walks in with blood in her eye and wields it before Katie and Bill and says she is going to tee off on her husband.",
