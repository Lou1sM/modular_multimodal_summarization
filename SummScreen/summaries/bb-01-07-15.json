    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Rick and Caroline continued to discuss their marriage. \"Why did it have to be Ridge?\" Rick shouted. Caroline insisted that they could go away and put it all behind them, but Rick said he had a company to run. \"I'm trying save a marriage,\" Caroline countered.\n\n\nRick professed that he had loved Caroline so much that he had regretted his deception. \"I loved you that much,\" he said. He had wanted to reach out to her. He'd thought of how their future would include kids, getaways, and more. They would have run the company together. \"That was my plan -- our plan. I knew that you shared that with me,\" he said.\n\n\nRick lamented that the one thing he'd needed most from her was loyalty. \"You broke that pact. You broke it,\" he said. Caroline countered that Maya had made it all seem worse than it was. Caroline demanded to know if Rick loved Maya. Rick was silent. \"You don't,\" Caroline said. She reminded Rick that Maya was just a rebound who had targeted him from the start.\n\n\nCaroline begged Rick not to destroy their marriage. \"You wanted to have children,\" she said. Rick admitted that he'd wanted a family with Caroline, and he seemed to soften for a moment, but he said he could never forget. \"It is over,\" he said and he removed his wedding ring.\n\n\n\"Our marriage is over, Caroline. I can never trust you again. Goodbye, Caroline,\" Rick said. Caroline picked up his ring and left. Caroline stood outside the office. \"It's not over,\" she said, and she clutched Rick's ring.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Eric lamented that he should never have given Rick an ultimatum about Caroline. Ridge discouraged Eric from making excuses for Rick. Ridge said Rick had been thinking like an angry little boy. \"And now he has control over every single one of us.\" Ridge said.\n\n\nEric doubted that Rick would remain with Maya, but Ridge advised Eric not to underestimate Maya because Maya was the only person Rick felt he could trust. Eric acknowledged that Maya had been a help to Rick, but Eric had been convinced that Rick still loved Caroline. Eric believed in Rick and Caroline.\n\n\nEric lamented that he had planned a trip with John and had to leave. Ridge encouraged his father to enjoy his trip. Ridge promised that he would find a way to get along with Rick.\n\n\nCaroline had returned to her office. Ridge entered and asked if Caroline had spoken to Rick. She explained that Rick had ended things. Ridge worried that it was his fault. Ridge said that Rick had behaved like a child. Caroline said he'd been hurt.\n\n\nRidge believed Rick would get over Maya, but Caroline disagreed. She said that she'd felt she had gotten through to him at one point, but he refused to forgive her. Ridge said she was impossible to forget. Caroline thanked Ridge.\n\n\nRidge said he was going to spend some time in Paris to escape the drama, but Caroline said she needed him to draw. Ridge said he needed her, but they could communicate over the \"Interweb.\" He teased that he couldn't hold a pencil without her, and she laughed.\n\n\nRidge said he loved her laughter, and part of him wanted Caroline to leave Rick and join him to start something somewhere else. But he knew that her commitment to her husband was extraordinary.\n\n\nCaroline said that Ridge was every woman's unattainable dream, so handsome. She sighed. Ridge was sure Rick would return to her. Caroline lamented that it might happen someday, but not soon.\n\n\nIn his office, Rick paced, and Eric entered. Eric angrily told Rick that he'd scammed everyone. \"You never would have signed it if I hadn't done it this way,\" Rick said.\n\n\nEric laid into Rick.\" I'm sorry. I'll make you proud,\" Rick stammered. Eric told Rick that he doubted that Rick would remain with Maya. Rick said that she was the only one he'd trusted. Rick said he had not been using her. Eric was unhappy.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Ivy watched Maya move boxes, but Maya stopped to take in the splendor of her new home. Ivy suggested that Maya should wait until Rick showed up before she moved more boxes, but Maya told Ivy she and Rick would be living her dream. \"Everyone can be a part of it,\" she said.\n\n\nIvy wanted to wait for Rick to get home. Maya said that she and Rick had been waiting for their moment for a long time and had been stealing moments away in an apartment. Ivy agreed that they had been living a lie to hurt Caroline. Ivy said she would go to her room, but Maya stopped her.\n\n\n\"Ivy, you and Aly won't be staying here tonight,\" Maya said. Maya explained that it was the first night she and Rick would spend in the main house. They wanted their privacy.\n\n\nIvy couldn't believe she was being kicked out, but Maya promised to make hotel arrangements for the night. Ivy argued that Maya had moved too fast, but Maya disagreed. \"Rick loves me,\" Maya said. She added that no one had ever loved her like Rick had. Maya said she had to change her clothes and wait for Rick so she could make him forget all about Caroline. \"He loves me, Ivy. I know he does,\" Maya said.\n\n\nLater, Rick entered and called out to Maya. He looked up at the portrait of Stephanie. \"Well there she is -- Ridge's greatest champion ... if you could only see us now,\" Rick said. Maya welcomed Rick home, and he poured some martinis. Maya balked at the strong flavor, but she promised to get used to it. \"I'm starting to feel at home,\" Maya said.\n\n\nMaya wondered if Caroline had tried to talk him out of everything, and he said she had. He promised that he and Maya would run Forrester together. They hugged. Maya said it felt more like home. Rick noted that he had a present for Maya -- a new portrait of her had replaced the portrait of Stephanie. Maya was shocked.\n\n\nRick said Maya had earned it, but Maya maintained that she was a guest in the house and not an institution like Stephanie had been. Maya asked Rick to take it down until she felt she had earned it. \"It just doesn't feel right,\" Maya said.\n\n\nRick credited Maya for his success. \"This is our home. Good things happen to good people,\" Rick said. He added that they had worked hard for their dream, and it was time to enjoy it. Rick and Maya kissed, and the portrait of Stephanie sat nearby on the ground. \n\n\n",

Later, Rick has surprise for Maya in their new home: he has hung down the portrait of the late Stephanie and instead presents Maya with a baroque painting of herself overlooking the living room of the mansion! Maya is deeply touched by Rick's gesture as she doesn't think she deserves this kind of respect and honor just yet despite Rick's assertions of the contrary.",
    "tvmega_recap": "With his voice breaking, Rick tells Caroline that he can not put this past him. Why did this have to be with Ridge? She says yes he can put this past him. They do not have to let this destroy them. They can go away to Paris or New York and put this behind them. He says no, he has a company to run. She counters that she is trying to save a marriage which is more important. Eric blames himself. He forced Rick's hand by making him go back to Caroline. He needed time not an ultimatum. Ivy tells Maya that she needs to slow down and wait for Eric to get home before making any big decisions. Maya retorts that the papers are signed and Rick is in command and she is the woman behind the man. And Ivy should be more careful with what she is saying. Maya says she knows she is excited but so would anyone else be. She has waited a long time just scraping by and now she gets to live with Rick in the mansion. She is living her dream and so can everybody else. Ivy tells her at least wait until Rick comes home. Maya reminds her they have waited a long time, been apart at the holidays, stealing moments at the apartment yearning for each other. Disgusted, Ivy says she is going to her room. Maya tells her wait up, she and Ivy will not be spending the night in their rooms. It is hers and Rick's first night in the main house and they want their privacy. Ivy is shocked even though Maya says it is only for one night and she will put them up in a really nice hotel. Ivy wants to wait until Rick comes home and hear it from him. Maya says perhaps it is a bit too fast for Ivy but the pace is just right for her and Rick. Eric tells Ridge that Rick needs to be brought to his senses. This thing with Maya is just a passing fancy. Ridge says good luck with that. She really loves Rick and he is convinced she is the only person he can trust. Eric says maybe so but his heart is still with Caroline and he believes in those two. With tears in his eyes, Rick says it's not that easy. He loved Caroline. He wanted it more than anything. He lay there with her night after night and wanted to touch her. He did not want to see her suffer but every time he thought of touching her, his mind went to Ridge. She broke her loyalty to him. Eric tells Ridge that he is supposed to be leaving for Europe to meet up with John. Ridge tells him go ahead. He will not mix it up with Rick, he promises. He does not know what will happen to Caroline. He is hoping Rick will wake up and realize what an incredible wife he has but he can not guarantee that. She's very talented and special, they work well together. They are able to create better than they can on their own. Rick muses to Caroline that trust, loyalty and commitment, that's what he needed from her and she let him down. She declares she can be all those things again but just don't throw this away over one little mistake. He reminds her it was a mistake with the wrong man and he never would have known it except for Maya telling him the truth. Caroline says Maya made it sound worse than it was. Rick says it was a betrayal pure and simple and he tried to let it slide. Caroline says Maya is just his fallback, he doesn't love her. She has been targeting him from the start. She begs him to forget Maya and they can still have children the way they planned. He says he did want children but he can not forget what she did. Their marriage is over. He takes off his wedding ring and lays it on the table. It is over. He could never trust her again. He says goodbye. She says it is not over for her but picks up the ring and leaves. Eric confronts Rick and asks him why. Rick says because Eric would not have signed the papers unless he did it this way. Eric had made it very clear that he had to have Caroline by his side, but she was too busy with Ridge. He could never run a company with someone he could not trust much less be married to her. He trusts Maya and is not using her. And she would never do to him what Caroline did. Ridge asks Caroline if she talked to Rick. She mumbles yes, it is officially over. He took off his ring. Ridge is sorry but she says it is not his fault. She created this and she is not sure he will get over Maya like Ridge thinks. He says Caroline is a tough one to pluck from one's mind. He also tells her that he is going to Paris and keep out of Rick's hair for him to think things through. Caroline admits she does not want him to leave. He says she does not need him; they can still design and communicate on the internet. Rick will come back. Ridge says he likes to hear her laugh; makes him happy. He'd love to tell her to leave the guy and come with him and they will find a place but he isn't. Her commitment to him is extraordinary. And she is extraordinary. She tells him that he is every woman's unattainable dream. He's so handsome and confident and it would be so easy for her to go with him. But she is not going to give up on her marriage and that is what got her in this mess in the first place. It's her fault and she knew at the time that Ridge was the one guy she could not cross the line with and she did. Yet she still believes she can have that future with Rick. Ridge says okay. Maya welcomes Rick home and he shares martinis with her. She says it is potent but if that is what they serve at the mansion on the hill she will learn to like them. Then she is shocked when Rick shows her the portrait over the fireplace, replacing Stephanie with one of Maya. He says he could not stand watching those disapproving eyes. He thinks this is a vast improvement. Maya isn't sure. She says she is a guest in this house, not an institution like that one. He says she will be one soon. She'd like him to take it down until then as she has not earned it. He says he would not be where he is now without her loyalty and support. This is her home now. Good things happen to good people and she has worked hard for this dream. He thinks it is damn time that dream came true.",
