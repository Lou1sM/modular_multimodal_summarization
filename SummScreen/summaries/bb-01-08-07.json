    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the Forrester Runway, Nick lashes out at Captain Kramer and has the security guards take him away while the photographers and reporters have a field day with Stephanie's show stopping scandal. Trying to do damage control,  Donna tells the press that there is clearly no truth and blames the whole fiasco on  Stephanie's attempt to sabotage  the fashion show. When Taylor rushes in, Ridge holds her back.  Nick scornfully stares at her, clearly blaming her for the whole debacle.  Once most everyone has left, Ridge enjoys his champagne and eagerly watches to see  how upset the Marone Board is by what just happened.  He  assures George, the head of the board, that the Forester's are willing to buy back their company before Nick drives it to Chapter 11. George informs him that they will be calling an emergency meeting to deal with this public relation's nightmare. As the board members are leaving, Nick walks in looking for his mother and Ridge gleefully tells him about the emergency meeting about to take place at Marone. After Nick leaves Ridge continues to drink champagne,  when Jackie walks in,  she disgustedly tells him she can't believe how much like Stephanie he has become.  Ridge smugly tells her that she and her \"bastard son\" have no one to blame but themselves. He  cruelly adds that soon she and Nick  will need a new cozy office space that will be suitable for entertaining sea captains. Standing her ground, Jackie proclaims that the Forresters  haven't won yet \n\n\nIn  Nick's office, Jackie confronts Stephanie asking her how she could do this.  She warns  Stephanie that Eric will leave her when he finds out.  Taylor burst in ready to let Stephanie have it.  Before she gets the chance, Jackie comes down on her saying she can't believe Nick ever trusted her.  Stephanie  defends Taylor, telling Jackie Taylor had nothing to do with it.  Not even caring who was responsible, Jackie leaves in a huff.  Once they are alone Taylor lights into Stephanie. She can't believe that her so  called best friend could betray her like this.  She shrieks  at Stephanie that she isn't upset because of her reputation, but because what has happened to Nick and Jackie. Stephanie questions where Taylor's loyalties lie, with the Forresters  or with the Marones?  Taylor angrily replies that she's going to have to think about that.  She blames Stephanie for \"playing her\" for years accusing Stephanie of pushing her off on one son, then the other.  Taylor adds that when her actions don't please Stephanie, Stephanie just cuts her out of her life.   Before she leaves Taylor angrily tells Stephanie she will not be pushed around anymore and she no longer wants to be a part of this one sided friendship. Later Captain Kramer finds Stephanie and she offers him money for all of his help.  Offended, he can't believe Stephanie lied through her teeth to get him there and now she's insulting him? He admits that he may have done some really lousy things in his life, but believes when it comes to 'pure nasty', he can't hold a candle to her. After he storms out,  Nick walks in and calls her a bitch. He  is upset that she had to bring Jackie into their fight. He  also can't believe that Taylor would betray his confidence.  Stephanie tells him that Taylor had no part in this and warns him that Marone industries is probably ready to flush him down the toilet.   \n\n\nIn the Dressing Room, Taylor is upset with Thorne for being part of Stephanie's nasty revenge scheme.   Thorne defends himself saying Stephanie and Ridge would have done it either way.  He feels justified in telling the truth about Jackie's past, if  it helps them to get back Eric's company. Taylor argues that airing someone's dirty laundry is not telling the truth.  She remains mad at him for not telling her about Stephanie's plans,  whether he had a part in them  or not. While they are still fussing,  Nick walks in and tells Taylor that her guilt for killing Thorne's wife should be over now since she has more than made for it by sabotaging Jackie.  He then leaves and Taylor goes  running after him.  When Stephanie and Ridge walk in on Thorne he tells them getting Forrester back wasn't worth losing Taylor.  \n\n\nBack on the runway, Nick cringes as he remembers the horrible events of the show and the spectacle the press made of his mother.  Taylor approaches begging him to listen to what she has to say. Nick accuses  her of planning this all along.  Taylor says he is wrong and explains that Stephanie overheard her going over her notes about Jackie.  She assures him that she made it clear to Stephanie that she wasn't to say a word.  Nick doesn't understand why she didn't warn him in advance that Stephanie knew,  Taylor admits that she made a mistake and tells him she feels as betrayed as he does.  Nick is  mad that Taylor had to dig up all of his past in the first place. Taylor vows to a disbelieving  Nick that she will make it up to him somehow. \n\n\nMeanwhile back in Nick's  office, Captain Kramer finds Jackie and apologizes to her.  He explains that Stephanie convinced him that Jackie wanted to see him.  Jackie can't believe he would think she would ever want to see him again. He tells her he had alot of things he wanted to say to her.  She is still angry about what he did to her in the past and slaps him.  Kramer says he saw she was in a tough situation back then and he wanted to help,  but admits it was the wrong way.  He explains that he gave her money because he couldn't give her what he really wanted to give her, since he was married at the time.  Not able to stomach him any longer, she reminds  him that he is no longer paying for her time and orders him to get out.\n\n\n",
