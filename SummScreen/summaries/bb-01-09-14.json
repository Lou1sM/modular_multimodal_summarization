    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Donna moped as she walked in and sat at the conference table. She'd thought she was alone, but from behind her, Eric asked why she wasn't on a date. She said she'd decided to tie up loose ends at the office and then mentioned that she'd been at Katie's house earlier. Eric called Donna a supportive sister, and she replied that Ridge was on Katie's side, too.\n\n\nEric was surprised that Ridge wasn't supporting Brooke, who'd probably had a difficult time revealing the truth to Ridge. Donna feared that, if Brooke and Ridge didn't reunite, it would give Bill more reason to go after Brooke -- no matter how hard Brooke pushed him away.\n\n\nDonna and Eric ordered Chinese takeout, and as Eric poured some wine, the topic turned back to Brooke and Katie. Donna stated that Bill wouldn't back down, and Ridge's return had made it even more of a challenge to Bill. \"One that he doesn't intend to lose,\" Donna ominously added.\n\n\nDonna wondered whether Katie would want Bill back as a consolation prize. Donna assumed that Katie would reunite with him only if he'd get on his hands and knees to beg. Donna stated that, if it weren't for Will needing his parents, she'd prefer that Bill go away and leave the path clear for another man to love Katie in a way that Bill never could.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke was livid that Bill had shown up in her bedroom. Bill refused to leave until she assured him that he wasn't losing her to Ridge. She insisted that she wanted Ridge and her family back, and even though Ridge was disillusioned, she'd do everything she could to fix it for him.\n\n\nBill felt that Ridge was guilting Brooke into that choice, but Brooke said she'd always wanted her family. \"Even when you were with me?\" Bill asked. She said that she and Bill had never been together the way a real couple should be, and she claimed that their affair had put her family in jeopardy.\n\n\nBill believed that Ridge had put the family in jeopardy, but Brooke insisted it had been her own scandalous ways that had done it. She cited that Ridge had walked out on her because of Deacon, and Ridge had walked out on her again earlier that night because he wasn't sure about her. Rolling his eyes, Bill quipped that Ridge was probably hopping a jet to Paris at that very moment.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want to listen anymore, but Bill said that Ridge had her taking responsibility for everything. She asserted that she was responsible, and she'd caused a lot of pain and scandal in the past. Bill replied that he didn't care about that; he only cared about her.\n\n\nBrooke felt that if Bill cared about her, he'd let her go. She stated that she loved Bill, \"but my love for Ridge...\" She said that their children needed both parents at home, and she and Bill had a chance to do something right. Bill insisted that their relationship was right, but Brooke disagreed. She said he hadn't been there for his older sons and wouldn't be there for Will if he didn't change course.\n\n\nBrooke noted that Katie was still very upset, and for some reason, Ridge's return had seemed to worsen Katie's feelings about Brooke. Bill figured that Katie had decided that Brooke wanted both men, and that was why Brooke was trying to send him back to her sister. Brooke replied that she was asking Bill to think about what they'd done to Katie and the children.\n\n\nBrooke said that children picked up on things, and she wanted Will and R.J. to recall having happy childhoods, not ones fraught with tension. She added that she and Bill could achieve that by not making more mistakes. Bill insisted that he and Brooke hadn't been a mistake, but he admitted that he did miss Will. \"And Katie,\" Brooke added.\n\n\nBrooke urged Bill to return to his family and give them what they deserved. Brooke wanted her family back, but she said it couldn't happen as long as she was with Bill. Bill asked what would happen if Ridge left again or if Katie didn't want him back. Brooke believed that Katie had things to get through, but Katie ultimately wanted to have Will's parents together.\n\n\nBill said that he couldn't forget about his relationship with Brooke. Brooke told him that he could savor the memories, and she'd do the same. A song called \"Your Bleeding Heart,\" by Kim Taylor played as Brooke and Bill's memories of Aspen and the Mediterranean played on-screen. Bill touched Brooke's face and strode out of the bedroom.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie was surprised by Ridge's arrival and asked why he was there. Ridge asked why she hadn't told him about Bill's fake reunion with her just to get her to sign the documents. Katie frowned, and Ridge expressed amazement at what Brooke and Bill had put Katie through.\n\n\nKatie asked what had happened between Ridge and Brooke earlier. Ridge murmured that it was complicated. He felt that Katie had survived her share of heartache from Brooke, and he was sure Katie would survive \"this,\" too. Katie was relieved that someone finally understood her point of view.\n\n\nKatie noted that even the family members who were supposed to be on her side had always wound up telling her to forgive Brooke, who hadn't meant to hurt anyone. Katie had almost been convinced that she was wrong to feel the way she did, and she'd begun to think that she was losing her mind. Katie said she was glad to have Ridge back in town.\n\n\nRidge remarked that he'd never know what Katie had seen in Bill. Katie explained that Bill had been the first person to see the real her, and when she'd looked into his eyes, she had been able to tell that he'd believed she was someone special. Bill had made her believe it, too, and the feeling had been intoxicating and additive. \"He looks at Brooke like that now,\" Katie added.\n\n\nKatie relayed that Brooke had taken that feeling away from Katie because Brooke had been alone and lost without Ridge. Katie didn't know if Brooke had targeted Bill, but she said it didn't matter because Brooke and Bill loved each other. \"And I don't think he'll ever look at me that way again,\" Katie sadly concluded.\n\n\nKatie guessed she was sounding pitiful. Ridge disagreed, but she noted that things were much better for her than they'd been in the past months. He responded that Brooke and Bill hadn't made it better, but Katie said she had some responsibility in it, too. Ridge felt that he had some responsibility, as well, but the bulk of the blame belonged to Bill.\n\n\nRidge said he'd returned to town to reunite his family; however, he felt that doing so at that point would be like condoning what Bill and Brooke had done. \"And I don't. I can't,\" Ridge decided.\n\n\nKatie said that the issue shouldn't destroy two families, and if Brooke was truly sorry, then Ridge should go back and give R.J. his family. Katie was sure that Ridge could forgive Brooke because he'd done it before, and Katie added that R.J. was counting on Ridge.\n\n\nRidge assumed that Katie was saying that she'd also take back Bill. Katie said that was entirely different, and she didn't even know if Bill wanted to be back with her. Katie reminded Ridge that Brooke was his destiny. Since nothing had gotten between him and Brooke before, Katie didn't see why it should be any different that time. \"It feels different,\" Ridge responded.\n\n\nKatie advised Ridge not to let it be. Ridge asked if she minded being alone. She said she was fine, but he told her that she deserved to have someone to care for her and cherish her. Katie replied that she was good at caring for herself, and love was overrated. He agreed with that, but he was sure she'd find love again. Katie and Ridge hugged.\n\n\nThis episode feature the song \"Your Bleeding Heart\" by Kim Taylor. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Donna is at the office moping around thinking about Katie. Donna tells Eric that Ridge is on Katie's side, too. Eric figures that Brooke probably had a difficult time revealing the truth about Bill to Ridge, but he thought Ridge would support Brooke. Donna reveals she is fearful that if Brooke and Ridge don't reunite, it will give Bill all the more reason to pursue Brooke, no matter how hard she tries to push him away. Having Ridge back home only makes it more of a challenge to Bill and she knows that he doesn't intend to lose. Donna also wonders if Katie is even interested in taking Bill back. Donna confesses to Eric that if weren't for Will she'd like it if Bill would just go away and leave the future clear for another man to love Katie like Bill never could. Bill waltzes right into Brooke's bedroom. She's aghast and asks him to leave. He refuses and makes it clear that he is not losing her to Ridge. He won't put up with Ridge trying to guilt Brooke. She says it is her choice. Bill even knew that the entire time they were together. She always wanted her family. Bill basically badmouths Ridge and blames him for leaving Brooke stranded on their honeymoon over a silly text message to Deacon. However Brooke takes the blame and beats herself up for it and her scandalous ways over the years and the pain she has caused. She says that if Bill cares for her, he'd let her go now so she can be with Ridge and her family. Both sets of children need both their parents at home. They have a chance to do something right here. She points out that Bill was not there for his older sons and it might turn out that way with Will too if he doesn't change course and go back to Katie. She's worried too that Katie's feelings for her have worsened since Ridge returned home. She wants Bill to go home and be with his family and give them what they deserve. He tells Brooke that he could never forget his relationship with her. She says the same, but they will savor the memories. He touches her face lovingly and strides out of the bedroom. Ridge surprises Katie by showing up at her house. He's amazed at what Katie had to go through because of Bill and Brooke. He wonders why Katie hadn't told him about her and Bill's fake reunion just so he could get the papers to his company back. He's sympathetic and tells Katie she has survived a lot over the years with her health, and she will get through this too. He will help her. She tells him that there were times she thought she was losing her mind. She is glad he is back in town. She confides that her love for Bill had been intoxicating and he made her feel so special, but now he only looks that way at Brooke. She isn't sure whether Brooke targeted Bill, but it doesn't matter now. She is sure Bill will never look at her that way again. Both agree they played some part and need to take responsibility for what they did, but they mainly put the bulk of the blame all on Bill. Ridge admits he came back to town to reunite his family, but he feels if he does that now it will be like condoning what Brooke and Bill have done. He just can't do that. Katie reminds him that Brooke has always been his destiny and they always found their way back to each other. This time should be no different. He says it feels different though. She tells him not to let it. He wants to make sure that she doesn't mind being alone. She deserves to have someone to love and cherish and take care of her. She sucks it up and says she is good at caring for herself and love is overrated anyway. He agrees with that, but assures her she will find love again. They hug.",
