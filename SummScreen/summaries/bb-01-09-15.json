    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Maya looked through the bedroom window and saw Caroline's car in the driveway below. The glowering Maya flashed back to times that Caroline had been catty to her.\n\n\nOthello called to check on how Maya was doing. Maya asked him to guess what Rick had done with Stephanie's portrait. Othello hoped Rick had taken the scary, eye-moving thing down. Maya said Rick had done more than that; he'd replaced it with picture of Maya.\n\n\nMaya felt like she was living a dream she didn't deserve. Othello insisted that she did deserve it. He felt that Rick had made bad choices in women, but he'd found one who'd be committed and honest. He advised her to support Rick and enjoy it.\n\n\nDownstairs, Caroline gasped at the portrait and asked Rick what he was doing. Rick taunted that he guessed he was about to get a broom so Maya wouldn't cut her tiny feet on the glass Caroline had dropped. Caroline asked how he could let Maya put the picture up there, and Rick haughtily revealed that he'd put it there as a housewarming gift.\n\n\nCaroline deduced that Rick had invited her there so she could see the portrait. Rick claimed that Stephanie had always favored her Marone bastard Ridge, and Rick refused to live under the stare of her disapproving eyes. Rick liked Maya's photo; it reminded him that honest people still existed.\n\n\nCaroline quipped that Maya would have lied to get into Rick's bed. Caroline asked Rick not to do what he was doing, and she asserted that he didn't love Maya. Rick stated that Caroline liked to believe that he was lashing out, but the truth was that she was suffering the consequences of her betrayal. She declared that he wanted her to suffer.\n\n\n\"You act like I care about your feelings. I don't,\" Rick replied. Caroline congratulated him on getting to her once again, that time through the photo. She told him that carrying on with Maya wasn't going to heal his pain. Rick yelled that Caroline had betrayed him, and she yelled back that \"now\" he'd hurt her. She reasoned that they were married, and it didn't have to be the end of them. All he had to do was break up with Maya, take that thing down, and return home.\n\n\nRick wordlessly strode out of the house, and Maya sauntered down the stairs, asking to what she owed the pleasure of Caroline's visit. Seeing glass on the floor, Maya asked if something had broken. Caroline said she'd been startled and glanced at the picture. Maya admitted that its presence had surprised her, too. She'd never expected to see herself displayed in a mansion in Beverly Hills.\n\n\nCaroline scoffed, saying that if Maya had been so shy about it, she could have asked Rick to remove it. Maya replied that she'd done so. Caroline asked about Rick's reputation and what people would think. Maya asked who cared. Caroline noted that the married Rick had placed a giant picture of his mistress in the family home, replacing Stephanie Forrester.\n\n\nMaya said no one was replacing Stephanie, and Rick was merely adding his touch to the home. Caroline asked if Maya was too blind to see what was going on. Caroline asserted that Rick had refused to see her unless it was at the house because he'd wanted her to see the picture. Maya didn't see where Caroline was going with her musings.\n\n\nCaroline declared that it verified that Rick's carrying on with Maya was all for effect. Caroline believed that Rick wanted to hurt her to get through his pain. She warned that once Rick had exhausted his anger, he'd have no use for Maya. \"And then what are you going to do?\" Caroline asked.\n\n\nMaya agreed that Rick was angry with Caroline, who'd lied to him and fooled around with a man he'd never trusted. Maya didn't think it was unreasonable that Rick wanted to hurt Caroline and added that the picture could be part of the hurt. Maya claimed not to worry about the end of Rick's vengefulness toward Caroline because Maya knew how to meet his needs.\n\n\nMaya said Rick needed honesty, support, and loyalty. \"You failed in that department, and I am more than making up for it,\" Maya concluded. She laughed at the idea that the picture shamed Rick or ruined his reputation. In her view, Rick had proved himself and earned the right to put up a picture of the one woman who'd given him the respect he deserved. Maya claimed she appreciated him and his hard work. She asked if Caroline had appreciated Rick between her selfie sessions and kisses with Ridge.\n\n\nMaya stated that Caroline wanted the picture to be about proving something to her, but she believed if it proved anything, it was that Maya was on track to being the next leader of the family. Shedding a tear, Caroline bellowed that the picture proved that Rick was desperate to push his feelings for her away, and the picture didn't make Maya the leader of the family.\n\n\nMaya claimed that her actions and her devotions would make her so, and they'd make her a wife Rick could count upon. \"A wife?\" Caroline exclaimed. Maya declared that she'd be Rick's perfect partner and succeed where Caroline had failed. \"Hear me and believe me, Caroline. I will be the next Forrester matriarch,\" Maya proclaimed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam arrived with lattes for himself and Ivy. Ivy discussed being busy at work because Wyatt was in Italy. Liam wondered how the trip was going. Ivy said Wyatt had been checking in at work but that she didn't know anything about \"the Hope situation.\" Liam hoped the couple was okay, and he noticed that Ivy was preoccupied. Ivy replied that Liam wouldn't believe what Rick had done.\n\n\nIvy revealed that Rick had replaced Stephanie's portrait with one of Maya. Ivy felt that Rick was just using Maya, and all Maya cared about was getting Rick's last name. Liam wasn't so sure. He said that Rick and Maya had been sweet together when they'd first met, and even though the pair had been devious, there was more to the relationship than Ivy or Caroline realized.\n\n\nRick entered to tell Ivy that he had to postpone a meeting they had scheduled. He asked Liam how Caroline was settling in at Liam's, and Liam replied that Caroline was doing fine. Rick offered to send more of her things to Liam's house.\n\n\nRick acknowledged that the picture replacing Stephanie's had probably thrown Ivy for a loop, but he asked if Ivy could help them all get along at the house. Ivy scoffed at the suggestion and stated that tossing Aly and her out the first night hadn't been a good start. Rick dismissed it as being just one night. Ivy replied that each thing Rick had done with respect to Maya said something to Ivy. He believed it said people needed to respect him and Maya. Ivy replied that it told her that he still wanted to be with Caroline.\n\n\nRick didn't know why he'd want someone who'd betrayed him. Liam said feelings didn't disappear overnight. Rick conveyed that his feelings had evolved into hate, anger, and disappointment. Liam said he knew the pain of a relationship ending, and Rick's hadn't ended. Liam relayed that Caroline loved Rick and was trying to make the marriage work.\n\n\nLiam acknowledged that kissing Ridge had been wrong but said Caroline regretted it. Liam stated that she even seemed to be willing to forgive a lot worse from Rick. Rick didn't know why he'd spend his life with a woman who was so clueless to his needs that she'd turn to \"that man.\"\n\n\nRick preferred the honest Maya, who supported his needs. Rick never had to question her loyalty. Maya believed in him, and she was what he needed after what he'd been through with Caroline. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Rick cuts right into Caroline\u2019s heart when he tells her that his gift to Maya is a reminder that there is still someone who is loyal to him. Caroline calls Rick out on what she thinks is the real reason why he is in a relationship with Maya. Now having visible proof, Maya gloats to Caroline about being the woman in Rick\u2019s life. Ivy and Liam confront a defensive Rick about his recent actions and give their opinion regarding the root of his behavior.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick starts to go get a dustpan and broom. He states that Maya likes to walk around barefooted sometimes and he doesn't want her to cut her tiny feet. Caroline can not believe he let her put that picture up. He says she didn't. That was his little housewarming gift. She shows scorn that this is the reason he invited her here so she would be sure to see the portrait. He reminds her that she called him and wanted to talk. She says yes because it is not too late for them if he would just allow her to sit and talk this through. Instead he is moving on with his life with Maya and even putting up her portrait. Rick says Ridge was always Stephanie's favorite son .the Marone bastard son she always tried to pass off as a Forrester. If his dad wants to look at her disapproving looks that is fine but he is not here now, he is. And he happens to like that picture as it reminds him there are still some honest people in this world. Caroline begs him not to do this. He does not love Maya. He invited her here just to see her suffer. He wanted her to see the portrait so Caroline could see the pedestal he put Maya on. So yes she is hurt and his plan worked but not the way he thought it would. Shutting her out now is not the way. He can not turn to Maya and expect all his feelings for Caroline to just go away overnight. He shouts that she betrayed him with the one man She says and now he has hurt her but they can get through this. All he has to do is break up with Maya, take that picture down and come home. She begs him but he walks out the door. Othello calls Maya to see how things are going. She tells him about the portrait and he says Rick has made some bad choices in the past but it looks like he is finally with the one who will stay committed and she deserves being the lady of the manor. Liam brings Ivy a latte. She thanks him but says she is more excited about the cute delivery boy. She asks him to give her a second as she has some backorders with more work since his brother went to Italy. Liam asks if Wyatt has been in touch as he has not heard from him. She says he responded to her e-mail only about work but she knows nothing concerning Hope if that is what Liam is asking about. He says he just hopes all is okay with them. She seems distracted then finally fills him in on what Rick is doing at home. She muses that Maya is just using Rick. She is only interested in getting that last name. He admits that Rick has done all kinds of wrong and is on the rebound and Maya is on a real power trip but they used to have genuine feelings for each other. Ivy and Caroline may be surprised that there is much more to that relationship. Maya comes downstairs and asks Caroline to what does she owe this honor. Rick goes to the office and asks Ivy if they can re-schedule their meeting for tomorrow then he says hello to Liam and asks how is it having Caroline stay with him. And if she needs more of her things he can have them sent over. He says he knows she was a little thrown by the portrait of Maya but it is a big house and he'd like them to all get along peacefully so whatever she can do to facilitate that he would appreciate. Ivy says okay but she sort of feels like kicking her and Aly out the very first night was not a good start. She adds he is moving on with Maya too quickly and adopting this \"Maya walks on water\" policy they have to accept at work tells her one thing that he still wants to be with Caroline. He says it tells him one thing too, that he is with Maya now and they all need to respect that. Maya tells Caroline that she is making too big a deal about the portrait. Rick wants it there. Caroline says Maya should think of Rick's reputation and what people will think of him hanging this monstrosity. Maya says no, she is not trying to replace Stephanie. It is just a picture and she should be glad it is not a tasteful nude, although she is not ruling that out for the bedroom. Caroline tells her that Rick only agreed to talk to her if she came here. He wanted her to see the picture, wanted her to be hurt and feel pain. But he will snap out of it soon and then where will Maya be. Rick tells Liam that why would he want to be with Caroline. She betrayed him. No his feelings have not disappeared overnight but they have evolved into something else like hate and anger and disappointment. Liam says he knows the pain Rick is going through. Rick lashes back really as he did not know Liam's wife ever cheated on him. Liam says again he knows how it feels when a relationship ends but Rick's has not. There is still a chance for him and Caroline. She still loves him and is trying to make the marriage work. Yes there were a few kisses with Ridge if he calls that cheating and she should not have done that. But she feels badly about it and regrets it and is willing to forgive Rick for much worse. That ought to count for something. Rick says he gets why Liam would support Caroline. She is his cousin. But he does not want to be with a woman who cheated on him and does not support him. He chooses to live his life with a woman who is supportive of his needs and he sees that every time he looks into Maya's eyes. She believes in him and that is exactly what he needs. Maya tells Caroline that she does not disagree with her. Caroline lied to him and betrayed him so yes Rick is rightfully upset. He wanted to hurt Caroline and that is part of the reason he hung the picture. But she suggests when that desire is gone she is not worried where she stands. His needs are simple \u0096 he wants support, appreciation and loyalty and Caroline failed on all of those. Maya is the woman he deserves. And Rick has earned the right to put up the picture of the one woman he trusts and gives him the respect he deserves. So maybe it is time that Caroline learned that life on this planet is not all just about her. And if this picture proves anything it is that she on track to being the next leader of this family. Caroline gushes back that the picture does not prove she is the next leader of this family, just that Rick is trying desperately to push his feeling for her away. Maya says her devotion to Rick will make her a good wife. Caroline is shocked to hear her use that word. Maya says yes she will be Rick's perfect partner. She will be successful where Caroline failed. So hear her good, she will be the next Forrester matriarch.",
