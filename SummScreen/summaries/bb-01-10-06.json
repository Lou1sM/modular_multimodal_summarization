Ridge did not want to hear that Taylor was attempting to rebuild their relationship after she had kept the fact that she had slept with James a secret all of these years. Ridge stated that he could not forgive Taylor's hypocrisy all these years. Taylor had always taken the higher ground and tore Brooke apart for her actions. Ridge told Taylor that \"he does not know who she is anymore.\" Ridge revealed that now the two most important people in his life have lied to him-Taylor and Stephanie.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Felicia overheard Stephanie leaving a voice message for Taylor, begging her not to tell Ridge that she had slept with James. Felicia only heard the part when Stephanie said not to tell Ridge. Stephanie explained to Felicia that Taylor had made a mistake many years ago and now wants to tell Ridge about it. Stephanie feared that Ridge would not forgive Taylor and then reunite with Brooke. This would be Stephanie's worst nightmare.\n\n\nNick, Bridget and Brooke tried to guess what was happening between Ridge and Taylor. Bridget saw no reason why Brooke should not reunite with Ridge if he and Taylor break up. Brooke shot Nick a look to see his reaction to her possible reunification with Ridge. After Bridget was asleep, Nick advised Brooke not to reunite with Ridge as he had treated her so badly in the past.\n\n\nRidge continued to rant and rave about how badly Taylor had treated Brooke in the past. Ridge said he was disillusioned with Taylor; he had treasured her for her honesty. Ridge said all of his decisions were made based on Taylor's honesty and how he treasured that. Ridge said that his decision to give up his little son and Brooke were made based on his remarrying an angel. Now Ridge doesn't even recognize who Taylor is. Ridge said he saw Taylor as an angel placed on earth for him. Ridge became cruel and said that \"who we were as a couple is no longer recognizable to me.\" Ridge reiterated again, that he does not know who Taylor is. Taylor begged Ridge to stay with her to no avail. Taylor continued to beg Ridge who was distraught and left the house. Taylor became frantic and distraught when Ridge left.\n\n\n",
