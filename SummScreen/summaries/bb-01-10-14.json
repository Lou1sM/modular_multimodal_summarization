Hope replied that she'd returned early to get some work done and to have a conversation that she hadn't been looking forward to having.\n\n\nQuinn assumed that Hope was angry. Hope responded that the manipulation of her and Liam had gotten old, and if Quinn wanted Hope to know something, Quinn could just tell her without faking emails or forging notes. Hope also felt that Quinn hadn't had a reason to get involved with Steffy's fertility news. Hope liked working with Quinn but was starting to feel like she couldn't trust Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn asked Hope not to blame Wyatt, who'd had nothing to do with his mother's actions, and then asked how the trip had gone. Hope said Wyatt had gone out of his way to make it special. Quinn admired Hope's new necklace and said that her son really was \"Mr. Romance.\"\n\n\nLiam stepped into the doorway, and Quinn welcomed him to take a look at the jewel Wyatt had given Hope. \"Hope, I need to talk to you -- alone,\" Liam said. Hope asked Quinn to leave, and Quinn sneered at Liam as she exited.\n\n\nLiam guessed that the jewelry gift and trip to Hawaii meant that things with Wyatt were getting serious. Hope indicated that Wyatt hadn't ever been shy about his feelings for her, but she wanted to take time for herself. She was excited about her line and a future with no weddings on the horizon.\n\n\nLiam asked where she stood with Wyatt.  Hope said that one could say she and Wyatt were dating. \"And you and me?\" Liam asked. Hope grew tearful and turned away. \"Okay, so I'll wait,\" he decided as the two sat on the sofa in Rick's office.\n\n\nHope became confused and said Liam had told her that it had been \"now or never.\" Liam reasoned that Hope had been shocked by Steffy's visit, but Hope was already starting to see through Quinn's games. Believing that she wasn't far from seeing through Wyatt's, too, Liam assured her that a marriage and family with Liam would be waiting for her once she finally did.\n\n\nHope asked if Liam thought it was just another obstacle for them. Liam stated that it wasn't unlike the other obstacles that they'd surmounted. Disagreeing, she said she'd experienced divided feelings like the ones that Liam had experienced with her and Steffy, and she'd figured out that Wyatt was more than just a roadblock in Hope and Liam's relationship.\n\n\nLiam felt that it was a good thing, and it meant that she understood why he'd allowed Steffy to tell her news to him that day. Because Steffy had been his wife, he believed that they'd always have some sort of connection. Liam figured that Hope and Wyatt would probably be the same way.\n\n\n\"But it's not this, Hope. It's not us, and you know what I'm talking about,\" Liam stated. Hope agreed, adding that it didn't hurt with Wyatt. Liam guessed it didn't, but he said Wyatt wasn't the guy for her. Liam expressed genuine worry for Hope if Wyatt turned out to be anything like his mother.\n\n\nQuinn slipped up to the ajar office door and listened in as Hope declared that Quinn just wanted her son to be happy, and Liam was reading too much into it. With a mirthless chuckle, Liam asked how Hope would have responded if he'd said the same thing about his interfering father. She guessed she wouldn't have let it slide.\n\n\nLiam declared that Wyatt and Quinn weren't good people, and Liam intended prove it. Liam stated that he wasn't done with Hope. He knew that she was the only one for him, and he sensed that she knew it, too. Quinn's mind churned in thought as she listened.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Bill met Brooke and asked why they were there. Brooke said it was his home, but Bill corrected that it was his property. He warned her about trying to get him to have a sit-down with Katie, but Brooke replied that Katie was at work and didn't know they were there. He wondered what they were doing there. \"Opening your eyes,\" Brooke replied.\n\n\nBill said that being in that house wouldn't make Brooke's words more believable to him. Bill and Brooke looked at the pictures on the mantel, and after citing how much Will had grown, she asked Bill to consider what he'd missed. Bill stubbornly replied that it couldn't be helped.\n\n\nBrooke asked Bill to remind her of what he'd been thinking about during his fall. Bill replied that he'd thought of what Katie had taken from him. Brooke, however, reasoned that he'd been thinking about what he'd been losing -- not what Katie had taken.\n\n\nBill said that he'd reflected upon his life the other evening, and it had felt no different from when he'd dangled from the rope on the mountainside. \"You've been my rope. Are you sure you want me to let go?\" Bill asked. Brooke replied that they'd had their time, and the time had arrived for him to think about his important memories with Katie.\n\n\nBill said Brooke was talking as if Katie wanted him back, but Katie hated him. Brooke asserted that Katie loved him, and though it might take her time to work through things, he was the father of her son. Brooke believed Katie would take him back. He asked if it was really what Brooke wanted.\n\n\nBrooke said it was. She relayed that she'd finally have her happily ever after with Ridge, and Katie would have hers with Bill. Brooke felt that she and Katie were parents who wanted their children raised in two-parent homes. Brooke asked if he'd want anything less for himself. Bill sadly relented, and Brooke shed a tear as he decided that he'd get Katie to take him back.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Ridge arrived to further discuss Brooke and Bill with Katie. Ridge was sorry to keep rehashing the pain for Katie, but he didn't have anyone else to talk to about it. No matter how much Brooke had explained things to him, he couldn't understand how she and Bill could have betrayed Katie.\n\n\nRidge asked how Katie had found out about Brooke and Bill and what Brooke had said for herself. Katie began with the story of Taylor at Brooke's birthday party, explaining that by that time, Brooke and Bill had made themselves break up as a sacrifice for Katie. Katie said the cameras had given Bill the excuse he'd needed to walk away.\n\n\nKatie claimed that she wouldn't have wanted Bill anyway because he'd be fantasizing about her sister. She supposed that some women would settle for that. \"But not me. Not from any man,\" she said.\n\n\nKatie relayed what had happened with her premonition about Bill's climb. Ridge wondered why she'd cared if Bill had fallen off the mountain. Katie said that Bill was the father of her son, and she'd loved the man he'd once been. She recalled how electric her connection with Bill had been, even when he'd touch her, but she guessed that relationships like that only happened once in a lifetime.\n\n\nRidge assured Katie that she'd get it again someday. Katie doubted it, but he said she wasn't the only one with premonitions. Ridge touched Katie's arm, and an imperceptible change occurred in Katie. She looked down at his hand on her arm, and then she tearfully stared into his smiling face. \n\n\n",

Bill resists Brooke efforts to show him the life that he could have if only he would reconcile with Katie.

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn is surprised to see Hope back at Forrester and that she had not stayed in Hawaii with Wyatt as he searched for some pearls on the island. Hope replies she needed to get back to work and also to have a conversation she was not looking forward to. Quinn knows that Hope must be angry. But Hope says it is mainly that she and Liam have been manipulated so many times that it is getting old and far too familiar. If Quinn has something to say to Hope then say it without fake e-mails or notes. Hope says she likes working with Quinn but is beginning to feel she might not be able to trust her. All Quinn asks is that Hope not blame Wyatt as he knew nothing of her actions. She asks about the trip and Hope responds that Wyatt had gone out of his way to make it very special. Quinn is delighted to know her son was Mr. Romance. Liam comes by to see Hope and Quinn quickly points out to Liam what her son gave Hope, a beautiful diamond pendant. He asks to speak to Hope alone so Quinn smirks at him and leaves. Liam deduces with the jewelry and them staying in Hawaii things must be getting serious with her and Wyatt. She replies that she wanted time for herself and was excited about her line and a future with no wedding in sight. She did admit that she and Wyatt are dating now. He wants to know where they stand. She doesn't answer so he says he will wait. They fall back into the same old pattern of discussing Steffy and her news. Liam thought Hope should have understood it was manipulation again and he thought Hope would see through Wyatt eventually. He was afraid Wyatt was going to turn out just like his mother and would end up hurting Hope. Quinn is listening to them behind a door that is ajar. You can almost see the wheels churning in her head. Liam continues that Wyatt and Quinn are not good people and he is going to prove it. And he vows that he wasn't done with Hope yet and he thought she knew it too. Bill meets Brooke at Katie's house and asks why they are both there. He does not want to have a talk with Katie, but Brooke assures him that Katie is at work. She is watching Will. Brooke wants to open his eyes. She shows him the pictures on the mantel and what he has missed. He states that it couldn't he helped. He says he reflected on his life just a few days ago and it was no different than when he was dangling on the mountain top. He tells Brooke that she was his rope and he can't believe she wants him to let go. Brooke says they had their time and now it's time for him to return to his family. He says no; Katie hates him yet Brooke is acting like she will gladly take him back. Brooke says she knows it will take some time, but she know Katie loves him and she believes she will take Bill back. Then she can have her happily ever after with Ridge. She and Katie both have children that should be raised with both parents in the house. Brooke sheds a tear when Bill relents and he decides to get Katie to take him back. Ridge arrives at Spencer Publication to discuss more with Katie about Brooke and Bill. He apologizes for causing her more pain by rehashing, but he has no one else to talk to. Brooke has explained everything, but he still can not accept how she and Bill betrayed Katie. Katie begins with the sequences of events at Brooke's birthday party with Taylor exposing the whole affair. By then Brooke and Bill had given each other up as a sacrifice. And Katie adds the cameras she had planted had given Bill the excuse he needed to walk away. She'd had this premonition about Bill's climb and she still cared as he was the father of her son. She recalled how electric it was when Bill touched her, but she guesses relationships like that only happen once in a lifetime. Ridge assures her that she will get it again someday. She doubts it. He touches her arm and says she is not the only one who gets premonitions. Something inside Katie is shaken, and she looks down at his hand on her arm, and she tearfully stares up into his sympathetic face.",
