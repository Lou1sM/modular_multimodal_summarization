Ridge wanted Brooke to have Hope accompany her home so that Hope could attend their wedding.\n\n\n\nBrooke suggested that she and Ridge had to have a plan and date for the wedding first, and Brooke reminded Ridge that he didn't want to get married until he had eliminated Quinn from their lives. Brooke was stressed, and Ridge rubbed her back and shoulders.\n\n\n\nBrooke told Ridge she wanted him to share his plan, but Ridge said he wanted to keep it quiet. He promised he was working on it. He said it was his first priority, but Brooke balked and insisted that she was his first priority. Ridge agreed, but he said he needed to make Quinn disappear.\n\n\n\nConversation returned to Brooke's visit to Hope. Brooke planned to surprise her and leave the next day. She hoped that while she was gone, Ridge would have Quinn taken care of, but Ridge reminded her it was not a quick or easy process.\n\n\n\nBrooke reminded Ridge that he was a lover not a fighter. She wanted to get married before she was too old to walk down the aisle. Ridge said she would never be too old. She acknowledged that Quinn drove him crazy.\n\n\n\n\"Quinn does things to me that no one else ever has,\" Ridge said. He shared that she had cost him his relationship with his dad, and she was a puppet master. \"Now you're trying to scare me,\" Brooke said.\n\n\n\nRidge told Brooke not to worry. Brooke said that perhaps Ridge needed the massage. They kissed, fell back on the bed, and made love. Later, Brooke asked about the wedding again and about Quinn. Brooke wanted her out of their lives because of everything she had done to Hope, Liam, and Steffy. She reiterated that Ridge was a lover, not a fighter. She teased that he was quite a lover. They cuddled.\n\n\n\nLater, Ridge sent a text message to Quinn that he needed to see her in the office the next day. Brooke asked if Ridge felt she should call Hope rather than surprise her because she might be out of town.\n\n\n\nRidge hadn't heard Brooke because he was busy sending the text message. \"Should I be jealous?\" Brooke asked. She noted that he had ignored her. Ridge answered that he had a message to answer about a meeting with Quinn at Forrester. Ridge felt responsible for the future of the company and his family. He had to get rid of Quinn, and \"it might be a little dirty.\"\n\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam and Steffy discussed that Quinn, Eric, and Wyatt had pretty much bribed Steffy into moving into the Forrester mansion with a million-dollar salary, cosmetics line, portrait over the fireplace, and promise that the mansion would belong to her one day.\n\n\n\nLiam kissed Steffy and said he realized that she had turned her grandfather, Quinn, and Wyatt down in order to commit herself to a life with him. \"This is what I want -- you loving me for the rest of our lives,\" she said.\n\n\n\nSteffy promised the waiting period for the divorce would pass quickly. Liam worried that she was giving Wyatt hope. Steffy said she should have been more sensitive to Wyatt from the beginning. She knew that he had been sincere about wanting to save their marriage.\n\n\n\nLiam admitted he was worried that Quinn, Wyatt, and Eric would never let up. Steffy promised that Liam offered her something no one else could. They kissed passionately, undressed, and made love.\n\n\n\nLater, Steffy lamented that she had to leave. Liam suggested that she take a stand against her family and move back in with him. He added that the family had stooped to an all-time low, promising to advance her career as long as she lived under the same roof as Wyatt.\n\n\n\nSteffy promised that Liam's home would soon be her home, \"and you will be my husband. I love you so much,\" Steffy said. They embraced.\n\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Quinn and Wyatt discussed that Eric had been disappointed in Steffy's decision. He had gone to bed. Wyatt lamented that they had basically been trying to bribe her. Quinn argued that wasn't true, but Wyatt was angry. He believed Steffy was gone for good.\n\n\n\nWyatt guessed that Steffy was already at Liam's house. Quinn wanted him to call her to find out. Wyatt angrily refused. Quinn tried to convince Wyatt not to give up because his divorce had a long time before it would be final. Wyatt agreed he would never give up, but he was not hopeful.\n\n\n\nWyatt said his brother wanted Steffy to shun the spotlight, but he wanted the whole world to see her. Wyatt said he wanted a drink, and he poured some tequila. He persuaded Quinn to drink one as well. She choked down the tequila. \"That's the spirit,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\n\nQuinn shared that she had just received a text message from Ridge, and he wanted to meet with her the next day. Wyatt worried. \"Be careful, Mom. People might start to talk,\" Wyatt said. He reminded her that she had a lot of closed-door meetings with Ridge.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "\nLiam is concerned that Steffy will not be able to withstand the family's aggressive tactics to buy into her affection. Steffy tries to reassure him. Over at the Forrester Mansion, Wyatt is not too sold on Quinn's words of encouragement that Steffy will eventually change her mind and decides to drink some Tequila with his mother to soothe the pain. Ridge strategically sidesteps Brooke's questioning about what exactly his plans are to get rid of Quinn. Instead, he assures Brooke that when she returns from her trip, Quinn will be gone and they can finally be married.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Liam that no matter what Quinn, Wyatt and her grandfather offered this is where she wants to be not the mansion on the hill. Quinn tells Wyatt that was a lot for Steffy to try and absorb but once she does she thinks she may change her mind. Quinn says she is not much of a tequila drinker but allows Wyatt to pour her one as he is having a shot. Wyatt tells his mom that they offered Steffy everything and then some and still she did not sway. He is sure he will go ahead tomorrow and do the same. Liam laments to Steffy that she did move out of his house but with a mixed message that the divorce is not final yet with Wyatt so that gives him hope. That is their goal and they will keep hammering away until they change her mind. And now that the clock is ticking the pressure will only mount. Brooke tells Ridge that she is going to surprise Hope and go see her tomorrow. This will give him time to work on his move to get rid of Quinn. He says she has cost him his relationship with his dad and does things to him that no other woman has so he will spare Brooke all the details. Quinn is the puppet master and yet Eric cannot see it. So Ridge will now have to be a little more extreme. He's a lover not a fighter and they will be fine once she is out of their lives. It might be a little dirty but it has to be done for the company. Quinn gets a text from Ridge to see her in the office tomorrow.",
