    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Quinn's office at Forrester, she and Wyatt discussed that they had been drinking tequila the previous night. Quinn was tired but claimed she hadn't been drunk. She lamented that Steffy had not agreed to move into the mansion and work on her marriage with Wyatt. \"I really thought we were getting through to her,\" she said.\n\n\n\nQuinn recommended that Wyatt continue to try to get through to Steffy. She said Steffy had to recognize that Wyatt was her champion and the man who really cared about her. Wyatt agreed, but he didn't think he had a lot of time. He worried that Steffy could be a huge star, but Liam would hold her back.\n\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, she was working and smelled breakfast tacos. Liam walked in with breakfast and teased that he would have preferred to serve her breakfast in bed, but since she'd had to leave, he'd delivered it to Forrester. Liam reminded her that he had wanted to wake up in the same room with her, but her grandfather had prevented that. He didn't prevent them from being together, however. They ate breakfast together and kissed. Steffy said she had a meeting.\n\n\n\nWyatt entered Steffy's office and slammed the door. He sarcastically said it had slipped. Liam called him out on trying to bribe Steffy with cosmetic lines and plastering her image all over the Internet. \"You didn't want her to have the CEO position,\" Wyatt said. They argued, and Wyatt insisted that Steffy had a lot more potential and star power on the Internet. \"You're holding her back,\" Wyatt argued.\n\n\n\nSteffy begged Liam and Wyatt to stop. Liam argued that she was a CEO not a spokesperson. Wyatt countered that she was a powerful woman that other women wanted to emulate, and that directly benefited Forrester. Steffy said the idea had some merit. Liam argued that Steffy was busy running one of the largest fashion houses in the world. She didn't have time to promote cosmetic and perfume lines. Wyatt reminded all of them they had a meeting. \"Tell Pam we don't want to be disturbed on your way out,\" Wyatt ordered. Liam and Steffy kissed, and Liam left.\n\n\n\nSteffy sat down next to Wyatt, and she asked to see his ideas. \"You were with him last night, weren't you?\" Wyatt asked. Steffy didn't answer at first. \"I don't want to discuss this. Let's talk about the campaign,\" Steffy said. Wyatt explained that he had more plans for products and endorsements. He had another pitch, though -- for their marriage. He didn't like that she was with Liam when she was still his wife. Steffy countered that the divorce would soon be final.\n\n\n\nWyatt hoped that Steffy hadn't thought they were trying to bribe her the previous night. She walked away from the table. Wyatt explained that he and Liam saw her differently. Wyatt maintained that Liam wanted to hold her back. \"I see how great you are and your potential and how big of a star you can become. You were with Liam, and I can't pretend that doesn't upset me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWyatt insisted he would not give up on his and Steffy's marriage. He held out hope that they could reunite because they'd meant their vows. Wyatt noted that Steffy had moved out of Liam's house. \"At my grandfather's request,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAt Bill's, Katie arrived to pick up a teddy bear that Will had left there. Bill noted that Katie loved her new home, and Will enjoyed it too. Bill wondered how she had coped with living next door to Eric and Quinn. Katie responded that she loved living next door to Eric. Katie wondered if Bill was pining over Brooke. Bill was surprised. Katie said she wasn't meddling, but she thought he might want to know that Brooke was headed out of town to visit Hope. \"So I will see myself out, and you can tell my sister goodbye for me,\" Katie said.\n\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke, Ridge, and R.J. discussed that Brooke was headed to Italy to see Hope. R.J. wondered why his parents didn't marry in Italy because they could make it a family vacation. Ridge explained that he couldn't get away, but they were planning to get married after Brooke returned. R.J. figured that Ridge had something to do for Quinn. \"I gotta take care of this for the company and the family,\" Ridge said.\n\n\n\nLater, Ridge and R.J. were gone, and Brooke was packed. Bill showed up. He shared that Katie had told him about her trip. He suggested that they marry while she was in Italy -- aboard his yacht. Brooke reminded him that she was engaged to Ridge. Bill replied that he was still waiting for her.\n\n\n\nBill offered to drive Brooke to the airport, but she had a car ordered. Bill refused to believe that they would not be together. He regretted that he had postponed their wedding. \"I didn't fight for you,\" he said. He admitted that he loved her.\n\n\n\nBill added that he had put his life on hold for Brooke. He refused to give up on them. He reminded her that he would always be loyal to her, and he said that she knew Ridge would do something to betray her because he always did.\n\n\n\nBrooke looked pensive. She said that Ridge was committed to her. Bill countered that he was committed to breaking her heart. Brooke's car arrived, and Bill carried her luggage outside the door. \"I love you. I won't give up on love. It will happen for us. You will be my wife,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBrooke grabbed the handle of her luggage, and Bill's hand was on it. They clasped hands and looked at each other. Bill left, and Brooke cried.\n\n\n\nIn Quinn's office, Ridge showed up, and Quinn told him he was late. He said he'd been saying goodbye to Brooke because she was headed out of town. Quinn asked if something was wrong. Ridge explained that she was headed to Italy to see Hope. \"What will you do with yourself with Brooke gone?\" Quinn asked. Ridge responded that he had a project he'd been working on, and he would have time to give it his full attention without distraction. Ridge left.\n\n\n\nIn Quinn's office, Liam confronted Quinn for trying to bribe Steffy. Quinn countered that Liam wanted to hold Steffy back. Liam argued that he didn't want to hold her back, but he did want to protect her from too much exposure and from Wyatt and Quinn. He insisted that Quinn was manipulating everyone again in order to make Wyatt happy.\n\n\n\nQuinn agreed that she felt Wyatt and Steffy's marriage was worth fighting for. Liam and Quinn continued to shout at each other. Ridge entered and asked if there was a problem.\n\n\n\nQuinn looked to Ridge for help, and Liam reminded her that she had scammed him out of his job. Liam advised that at some point, Quinn was going to slip up, and Eric would realize it. She would be out of their lives for good.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Bill and Katie play nice for the sake of Will as she prods him on the current status of life and his relationship with Brooke. With Brooke going to visit Hope, R.J. is disappointed that Ridge will not join his mother there and have a romantic wedding in Italy. Ridge cites work as the reason why he has to stay in Los Angeles. Later, Bill pays Brooke a visit and expresses that he is willing to make the commitment Ridge is shirking from. Brooke feels flattered, yet leaves for the airport without giving Bill the answer he was hoping for. Wyatt teases Quinn about her tequila hangover from last night, before making another attempt to convince Steffy that he loves her more than Liam and that they could achieve greatness not only in business. Liam finds Quinn and confronts her about the attempt to bribe Steffy. Quinn argues that she and Eric simply believe in Steffy more than he does. Shortly after, Liam presses Ridge to act now to get rid of Quinn once and for all.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy smells breakfast tacos; sure enough right on cue Liam walks in. He says it could have been breakfast in bed but this is the best he could do. Bill tells Katie that he is glad she told him he could stop by. They both opine they are doing pretty well, her living next to Eric and despite his pining over Brooke. She does say she is not trying to give him a hard time and he says he is not giving up. RJ wants to get a wedding started but Brooke says that takes time and Ridge says it is just bad timing. He can't get away right now. Wyatt slips into the office and slams the door, but tells Liam that it slipped. Liam isn't buying that and makes a smart remark. He and Wyatt have words over what the new product line will mean and how important it is to women to hold such an important position. Wyatt sits and Steffy does tell Liam she told him that she had a meeting. Wyatt tells Liam on his way out to tell Pam they do not want to be disturbed. He tells Steffy that he does not want her to think he is trying to influence her to move into Eric's. He is just wanting her to realize all her potential. He knows she was with Liam last night and that grates at him but it is not his call. Liam wastes no time in going straight to Quinn and says she is still working her angles to get Wyatt and Steffy together. Steffy it not settling for just being CEO and nothing else but to be with Liam. Quinn differs; she could have much more with Wyatt. Liam says yes her dirty little fingerprints are all over this so she can hand Steffy to Wyatt, something she thinks her son deserves. Ridge comes in and puts himself between the two of them and Liam keeps going off on Quinn. Bill stops by and surprises Brooke. He says he heard she is going out of town and he could be ready in ten minutes if she let him. He thinks it is great that she is going to see Hope and he will be on the Stella Maris close by so just give him a call anytime. He tells her one last time that he loves her and he is not going to give up on that. Ridge is only devoted to Ridge and that is not her future. Liam tells Ridge with Brooke out of town now is the perfect time Ridge needs to make his move on Quinn.",
