    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Caroline snickered at the idea of Maya Avante being the next Forrester matriarch. Maya stated that Rick believed in her. Caroline countered that she believed in her marriage. Maya said that Rick knew who he wanted and wasn't looking back. She claimed that Rick was a dead end for Caroline, but there was another man with real feelings for Caroline.\n\n\nCaroline was aware that she'd broken Rick's trust and handed Maya her opportunity. Maya guessed Caroline saw her as an opportunist but asserted that she loved Rick enough to drop it all in a heartbeat. Maya explained that she'd fallen in love with \"Rick the waiter,\" but she'd gotten scared and run away upon learning that he was a Forrester heir.\n\n\nMaya thanked Caroline for showing that a proper pedigree didn't guarantee a happy marriage. Maya had gotten pregnant and in trouble with the law in the past, but she'd felt inferior only because she'd allowed herself to. Since then, Maya had discovered her good qualities.\n\n\nMaya asserted that she wasn't Stephanie or Caroline, but she was ambitious, driven, and a quick study. Maya vowed to be the grande dame that the family needed her to be. It might not happen naturally, but given time, she'd surprise everyone -- even Caroline.\n\n\nCaroline said Maya thought she had it all figured out. Maya believed that Caroline had it figured out, too, which was why it didn't make sense that she kept hanging on to Rick. Maya reasoned that Caroline wouldn't have turned to Ridge if she'd been happy with Rick. Caroline asserted that she hadn't turned to Ridge. Maya guessed Caroline had just \"gotten caught up in something.\"\n\n\nMaya said Caroline treated her as if she were unworthy to breathe Caroline's air. Maya declared that she'd be a good wife, partner, model, and whatever Rick needed her to be. Maya believed she had something to offer the world and the family, and all that mattered was that she and Rick knew it.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Pam called Ridge and Carter into Rick's old office to announce that Rick and Maya had moved into Eric's bedroom and replaced Stephanie's portrait with one of Maya. Pam listed Rick's reasons for removing Stephanie's image from the wall, but Pam was outraged that the married Rick had put his mistress in Stephanie's place. Pam asked Ridge to imagine how Caroline would react. Ridge believed it was the very reason Rick had done it.\n\n\nPam left, and Ridge expressed his frustration about how Rick's actions would affect Caroline. Carter tried to remind Ridge that he'd said, \"If things were different, you would -- \" Ridge interrupted to insisted that he'd respect Caroline's choice to repair her marriage -- even if he didn't respect Rick. Ridge said he'd started the mess by enlisting Caroline to draw for him, and he left to talk to Rick.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Aly dropped off reports. She was trying to understand Rick, but his power moves had upset her. Rick claimed that none of it had been an affront, but she asked if he could see how it seemed to be so. He explained that Stephanie's portrait had been an unneeded reminder of how Stephanie had played favorites with Ridge.\n\n\nAly decided that it was more about sending Caroline a message than about Stephanie. Rick guessed that Caroline had sent Aly to talk to him. Aly replied that it wasn't true, and she hated seeing Caroline and Rick miserable. He asked why he'd be miserable while having absolute power, all the perks that accompanied it, and a beautiful, deserving woman by his side.\n\n\nAly said she understood what it was like to carry around a lot of pain inside. She'd blamed Taylor because it had been easier than dealing with losing her loved one. Aly guessed it was like that for Rick, too, but added that he didn't have to lose Caroline. Rick replied that he'd already lost Caroline, and he owed Maya for exposing Ridge and Caroline -- and for so much more.\n\n\nAly left, and Rick flashed back to Caroline seeing Maya's picture on the wall. Ridge arrived. Rick assumed Ridge was worked up about \"mommy's portrait,\" but Ridge said Rick's treatment of Caroline had worked Ridge up. Rick stated that moving into the mansion had nothing to do with Caroline, but Ridge countered that moving Maya in there had everything to do with Caroline.\n\n\nRidge asked if Rick was sticking it to everyone. Rick said he didn't sit around, worrying about what others thought. Ridge doubted the wisdom of going it alone. Rick stated that he had Maya, and he wouldn't be with his wife. Ridge said Caroline still saw Rick as the man she'd married, and if he still wanted a family and future with her, then he had to stop punishing her and himself.\n\n\nRick grumbled that Ridge's words were white noise. Ridge ordered Rick to talk to Ridge like a man. Rick disparaged Ridge as a \"man\" who'd strung along two families and a man who'd used a married woman to get his design gift back. Ridge acknowledged his part in things. He was sorry for it but less sorry every day in light of what Rick had done to their father.\n\n\n\"My dad,\" Rick corrected, and Ridge asked if they were going there again. Rick asked if Massimo still wore his pinkie ring but decided that Ridge wouldn't know the answer because Massimo had written Ridge off, too. Ridge contended that no one had written him off, but it would happen to Rick if Rick let his insecurities rule his life.\n\n\nRick deflected the insecurity onto Ridge, who'd gone after Eric's wife, Thorne's wife, and Rick's wife. Rick decided Ridge had no boundaries because he had no Forrester blood or heart within him. \"All you are is a bastard Marone, who takes and keeps on taking,\" Rick quipped. Keeping calm, Ridge said he was there to relay that Caroline loved Rick, and if Rick wanted to reconcile, he had do it \"now.\"\n\n\nRick insisted that he wanted to be with Maya. Ridge noted that it was just the two of them in the room. He asked why Rick couldn't admit to loving Caroline, so they could start healing. Rick said he couldn't admit what he didn't feel. Ridge relayed that Rick's stunts said otherwise. Rick yelled that, for the last time, the portrait wasn't a stunt.\n\n\nRidge announced that no one was buying it. He likened Rick to a little boy on the playground who pulled the pigtails of the girl he liked, hoping to get any kind of reaction from her. Rick warned that Ridge was testing Rick's limits. Ridge promised to leave after saying one more thing. Ridge stated that Maya was Rick's number one person. \"So have you told her you love her?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nRick said nothing. Ridge guessed that Rick hadn't done it and said they each knew why he hadn't. No matter Maya's loyalty, beauty, or sexual prowess, she wasn't Caroline, the love of Rick's life. Ridge said Rick proved it was so each time Rick hurt Caroline for hurting Rick. Ridge pointed out that he had been the one to hurt Rick, not Caroline, but Rick went after Caroline day after day after day.\n\n\n\"Most women would have given up on you already, but not Caroline. She sees something good in you. She believes in your marriage. Rick, that speaks volumes, or it would to any other man,\" Ridge stated. He warned Rick to take Caroline back before it was too late. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Everyone, but Rick, seems to know the true reason for his offensive behavior and why he is flaunting his scandalous relationship with Maya. Caroline and Maya go head-to-head over which woman loves Rick more and which will end up with him in the end. Maya vows that she will prove to everyone that she is worthy of being a member of the Forrester family. Despite Carter\u2019s warning to mind his own business, Ridge is determined to get through to Rick about his poor treatment of Caroline.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Pam tells Ridge and Carter to brace themselves .Rick has moved into Eric's house and that little weasel has put up Maya's picture after taking down Stephanie's portrait. Ridge and Pam agree this is all for Caroline's effect. Ridge tells Carter that he is not worried about Rick and what he is doing but he is concerned for Caroline. She wants to have a baby and is trying to put her family back together. He is going to respect that even if he doesn't like Ricky boy. He will go talk to him. Aly explains to Rick that she is upset not only about the portrait but the whole thing with him moving into the house and she knows it has a lot to do with sending a message to Caroline. About the portrait he says Ridge was always Stephanie's favorite golden child and he doesn't need that looking down on him with disapproval. And Maya has earned her place as the matriarch. He says Caroline crossed the line with Ridge's help and Maya exposed them. He owes her for that and so much more. Caroline tells Maya that she is just trying to save her marriage. And she knows she just handed Maya this opportunity. Maya says yes she wants the finer things in life just like Caroline does but she would give it up in a minute if Rick asked her to. She reminds her how she met Rick, not as a Forrester but just another guy who hung out at Dayzee's. She says she does not have Caroline's lineage but she will surprise everyone when she learns to be the grand dame in the family. Ridge barges in on Rick just as he is thinking about Caroline and her begging him to work on their marriage and her being so upset when she sees Maya's portrait where Stephanie's was. Carter tells Aly that Ridge is talking to Rick now and trying to solve all of this. Rick tells Ridge that the house on the hill suits them fine and he does not want Caroline; he has made that clear so he doesn't care what Ridge or anyone else thinks. Ridge says he is to blame, not Caroline. Rick gets very defensive and tells Ridge that he has no Forrester blood, not even a Forrester heart. He is nothing more than a Marone bastard who takes and keeps on taking. Ridge holds his furor in check. He states that Caroline still loves him so if Rick wants to reconcile he has to do it now. Caroline tells Maya that she thinks she has it all figured out. Maya says yes .. even if Caroline thinks those with lower class status have no feelings with all her putdowns. She has something to offer the world, FC's and this family. So does Rick and that is all that matters. Ridge tells Rick that Maya is his number one but he has not told her he loved her. Caroline is the love of his life and he proves that every day that he tries to hurt her. Most women would have given up already but not Caroline. She believes in them. He should not screw this up. He needs to take her back before it is too late.",
