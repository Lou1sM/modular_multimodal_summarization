The hosts wanted Ridge and Quinn, and Eric believed the company should be represented there.\n\n\nA nervous Quinn said Ridge should go alone. Ridge complained about it being all the way in San Francisco. Eric said it was an hour flight, and it would be just a simple overnight trip. Quinn didn't think it was a good idea, but Eric said it wasn't up for debate. Ridge stated that he wasn't CEO, and Steffy or Eric should go. Eric replied that it would be good for Ridge and Quinn, who were family. They needed to get to know and appreciate each other.\n\n\nThe hotel was booked, and Eric advised Ridge and Quinn to get moving. Ridge still griped about it, but Eric asked for his cooperation. Quinn suggested that Eric go, too. Eric responded that the doctor hadn't cleared him to fly, and Ridge and Quinn could use time together. Ridge decided that Eric had a point, and it was Quinn's chance to show the world who she really was.\n\n\nLater, Quinn and Eric were alone, and she draped her arms around his neck as she pouted that she didn't want to go anywhere without him. She asked who'd make sure he took his medication and who would make him his tea. Eric assured her that she'd be fine, and Ridge had been right when he'd said it was a chance for Quinn to show the world who she was.\n\n\nQuinn didn't want to go and claimed to have stage fright. She fretted over what Eric would eat. Eric reassured her and said Ridge would take care of her. Quinn asked to video-chat later and started talking to him about his dinner preparations. Eric said he'd be just fine, and she'd be his shining star. Quinn didn't like the position she was in. She wondered if she'd mess up and let him down. Eric said it wasn't possible. They said their farewells, and Eric took her bags outside.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Steffy dubiously stared at a tablet. She didn't know about whatever she was viewing and said it was embarrassing. As Wyatt encouraged her about the brand-building they were doing, Liam entered and congratulated Steffy on being a product.\n\n\nLiam and Wyatt sniped at each other until Thomas crossed the threshold of the office and announced that he was back. Steffy exclaimed Thomas' name. Looking at Steffy's doorplate, Thomas said some things had changed. When he glared at Liam and Wyatt, Thomas concluded that others never did.\n\n\nIn conversation with Thomas about his trip, Liam, Wyatt, and Steffy learned that Thomas had arrived on his own because Caroline had wanted to spend more time with her parents. Thomas wondered how his little sister had become his boss, and Liam replied that it was a question for Eric and Quinn.\n\n\nLater, Liam was across the hall in the design room with Ridge, who was informing Liam about the trip. Liam thought it was too convenient to be true and asked if Ridge was going through with the plan. Ridge said that he would do it that night. He'd do anything he had to do to get Quinn into a compromising position. \"Within reason,\" Liam added.\n\n\nRidge said that it would be within reason, of course, and he wouldn't cross the line. Liam was happy to hear that because Brooke would be ticked off it she knew about things. Ridge liked to believe that Brooke would understand.\n\n\nLiam asked about the possibility that Quinn wouldn't buy it. Ridge thought there was no good way to put it; however, he knew women, and she would buy it. Liam reminded Ridge that Quinn was suspicious. Ridge replied that Quinn was attracted to danger, and he was dangerous to her.\n\n\nRidge called the hotel Eric had booked, and the reservationist confirmed that Mr. and Mrs. Forrester had two rooms. Ridge asserted that it was wrong and should be just one room. The woman corrected it to one room and gave Ridge a complimentary breakfast for two. After the call, Liam was amazed Ridge had put himself in a hotel room with Quinn. Ridge added that he'd gotten a free breakfast, too, and he needed to get to the airport.\n\n\nLater, Liam wandered back into the CEO's office, where Wyatt was listening as Thomas and Steffy ribbed each other about having to live together again. Wyatt asked why Liam had abruptly taken off after getting a text message. Liam quipped that, as a former employee, people there still valued his opinion. Wyatt advised Steffy to look into getting rid of those people.\n\n\nLiam asked Thomas how long he would be in town. Thomas said it would be a long time. Wyatt inquired about working things out with Caroline. \"Yeah,\" Thomas said and quickly changed the subject to how big Douglas had gotten. Steffy missed her nephew. Thomas stated that Caroline and Douglas would be back eventually, and Steffy should be out of Thomas' place by then. \"And hopefully moved in with me,\" Liam added, to Wyatt's chagrin.\n\n\nThomas said he had been trying to catch up with Ridge and asked where he was. Liam replied that Ridge was on a jet to San Francisco with Quinn.\n\n\nLater, evening fell. Wyatt and Liam were alone when Wyatt remarked that Quinn and Ridge had landed a while earlier. He thought it was weird that Eric had sent the two on a trip. Liam was conspicuous as he said it was to mend fences or something like that. Wyatt said it would never happen, and Liam murmured that one could be surprised by what could happen.\n\n\nWyatt was surprised Liam hadn't tagged along with Thomas and Steffy to Eric's house and quipped that Liam didn't seem to be letting Steffy out of his sight. Wyatt knew what Liam was doing by following Steffy around with his tacos and lattes. Liam replied that Wyatt was freaking out over Liam taking Steffy some breakfast. Wyatt asked if Liam shouldn't be at work and if Bill wasn't wondering where Liam was.\n\n\nLiam claimed that Bill didn't keep Liam on a leash as Bill did some people, and it seemed that Eric was holding Wyatt's leash at that time. Wyatt quipped that while busily making Steffy a star, he'd forgotten how annoying Liam was. Liam said that if Ridge and Quinn could do an overnight trip, Liam and Wyatt could stand each other for an afternoon.\n\n\nWyatt was still puzzled by Eric pairing Ridge and Quinn. The sarcastic Liam couldn't imagine what could go wrong with Quinn involved. Wyatt didn't know why Eric hadn't chosen Wyatt and Steffy, who were amazing at public appearances, in Wyatt's opinion. Wyatt assumed the jet ride had been awkward, and he couldn't imagine how Ridge and Quinn had passed the time. Liam remarked that there were any number of things to do.\n\n\nWyatt noted that it was nearing dinnertime, and Steffy probably wouldn't return to the office -- in case Liam was waiting. Liam asked why Wyatt had to assume that everything Liam did was about Steffy. \"Because you're obsessed with my wife! Key words: my wife!\" Wyatt exclaimed. Liam contended that it was only legally. Wyatt said he and Steffy were still married, and he was still Steffy's husband. \"Until the divorce goes through,\" Liam stated.\n\n\n\"If it ever does, thank you,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nBack at Eric's house, Eric was talking to Steffy and Thomas. Eric said it would be nice to see Caroline and Thomas work things out. Thomas replied that they were giving it a shot, but no one knew what the future held. The talk turned to Steffy being CEO, and Thomas joked that he felt overlooked. Eric stated that Thomas' time would come, but for then, he needed Thomas designing because Eric had backed off a bit.\n\n\nThomas agreed to do it and wondered how Ridge was taking things. Eric replied that Ridge wasn't happy. It was tough on Quinn, upon whom Ridge unleashed his frustrations. Thomas and Steffy wondered why Eric would send Quinn and Ridge on a trip when the two drew out the worst in each other. Steffy didn't know if it had been the best plan of action.\n\n\nLater, Thomas looked at Quinn's portrait and said he'd never get used to \"this.\" Steffy said she wouldn't, either, and the two asked Eric for any updates. Eric hadn't gotten any messages after Quinn had notified him of her arrival. Steffy and Thomas hoped Ridge and Quinn didn't embarrass Eric on-screen. Eric said Ridge and Quinn were adults. It was business, and Eric was sure they'd behave appropriately.\n\n\nEric knew that Quinn wanted to get along with Ridge, and Eric believed that, after that day, things would be different. Eric knew his wife and trusted her, and after that day, she'd prove to the world who she really was. \"And after that, she'll be welcome with open arms,\" he concluded. Steffy hoped for the best and that Ridge and Quinn could resist the temptations to push each other's buttons.\n\n\nIn San Francisco, a woman named Cyndy greeted Mr. and Mrs. Forrester at a filming studio. Quinn clarified that she and Ridge had the same last name because she was married to his father, not to him. Another host greeted the Forrester team and said they'd soon go to the green room while the audience took their seats.\n\n\nAlone with Ridge on the talk show-themed stage, Quinn shook off her nerves. Ridge asked if she was okay. She didn't normally get anxious and asked if she was sweating. Ridge said she looked pretty. Brushing her hair from her face, Ridge said nothing bad would happen unless she wanted it to, and she was in control.\n\n\nAfter the show had started later, Quinn was telling the host about herself. Quinn said she and her son had begun in downtown Los Angeles, making jewelry in a warehouse. They'd done well and had had a few loyal clients. She'd been blown away when Forrester had approached them. She'd admired the Forrester family and their company for a long time and had thought their offer had been the pinnacle of her career. It wasn't, however, and life kept giving her new challenges.\n\n\nQuinn discussed taking over as interim CEO, and she said that with the help and support of coworkers and family, she'd faced the task and Eric's illness head-on. She said she'd even had fun with it. On a television screen behind them, pictures of the jewelry pass and Quinn in the showstopper appeared. Ridge agreed that Quinn had had fun with it.\n\n\n From Ridge's demeanor, Cyndy gleaned that he hadn't been a fan. Quinn tensed when Ridge admitted that he hadn't been. He said that because they were being truthful, he'd reveal that he and Quinn didn't get along. He explained that when two artists worked together, they'd have different visions. The tough part was creating one vision that worked for both.\n\n\nRidge said that listening to Quinn that night about her story, her journey, and her appreciation had made him feel that he owed her an apology. He said the jewelry pass had been a good idea. Quinn began telling him that he didn't have to, but he spoke over her to emphasize his point. He said it had been inspired and successful, but he hadn't seen it. The showstopper hadn't been designed for her, but she'd been flawless.\n\n\nRidge apologized to Cyndy for using a lot of words to say that Quinn was a force to be reckoned with. Quinn thanked Ridge and told the hosts and audience that she appreciated being with them that day. She felt truly welcomed and accepted. It was a dream made true for Quinn to represent Forrester that day. Looking at Ridge, she added, \"And to be sharing the stage with such a brilliant designer as Ridge Forrester.\"\n\n\nThe audience applauded. Ridge grinned at Quinn, but inside his head, he said, \"Tonight, it all ends for you, Quinn.\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric springs it on Quinn and Ridge. He wants them to go to San Francisco, just the two of them since he does not have permission to fly yet. Both try to find ways out of it but Eric won't hear of it. He says the company needs this and so does the family. They need a chance to be together and it's only one hour away on the jet. Ridge tells Liam who thinks this is too good to be true. Ridge says he will not cross the line but this will work. He is involved, it is a both a blessing and a curse, he knows women. He makes a phone call and makes sure they change the room in SF to one room for a couple and it will include a complimentary breakfast. Liam thinks it is a hoot. Wyatt and Liam are going at it as usual when Thomas walks in, back from his long stay in New York. He says Caroline stayed behind but he is here to stay for a long while. He glances at the door with Steffy's CEO nameplate on the door and says some things change while others do not \u0096 looking at Wyatt and Liam.

Liam spars with Wyatt but adds if Quinn and Ridge can survive a trip to S.F. together then they two of them can do better. Eric tells Thomas his time will come. Right now because he has backed off on designing a little he needs Thomas to pick up the pieces and keep designing. Quinn is a little nervous. She tells Ridge she is not much of a public speaker and she feels like she is sweating. He says nothing bad is going to happen unless she wants it to, she is in control. Eric tells Steffy and Thomas that it is no secret that Ridge and Quinn do not like each other but he thinks they can make it through one meeting and one flight and she can show the world who she is. He trusts her. Quinn does well on camera and says this is the pinnacle of her career. Ridge takes over and says his showstopper wasn't for her but she made it a success. They do not really get along as they are two artists with different views who now are trying to mesh together their views. She repays the compliment by saying she is truly honored to be sharing the stage with the great Ridge Forrester.",
