A call announcing that Bill was there interrupted them, and Ridge quickly slipped out the back door of the office. Bill entered, and with a serious look on his face, he declared, \"I want you back.\"\n\n\nThe surprised Katie asked what Bill had just said. Bill said it wasn't a game, and it wasn't a lie. He wanted to love Katie again, and he asked her to give them a chance. She thought it sounded familiar, and she sarcastically recalled that he'd said it all to her before -- only to be gone again before breakfast.\n\n\nBill acknowledged that he'd had an agenda before, and he admitted that he had one that day, as well. He stated that he'd started a life with Katie, and it was the life he wanted to live again. Katie, however, informed Bill that there was no \"you and me\" anymore.\n\n\nBill posited that the divorce wasn't finalized yet, and they could try again. Katie asked if she was supposed to believe that Bill's feelings for Brooke had vanished. Katie was sure that Bill was there with her because Ridge was back, and Brooke didn't want Bill anymore.\n\n\nBill claimed that Ridge wasn't a factor for him. \"You really believe that?\" Katie asked. Bill said it was only about the two of them. He claimed that he wanted to make up for his mistakes, and he was committed to putting his family back together.\n\n\nThough a part of Katie wanted to take Bill back and have her family, the other part of her knew that he was there because his first option was off the table. No matter how much Katie wanted to give Will his family back, she refused to be a consolation prize to anyone, not even for her child's father.\n\n\nKatie relayed that she'd become skeptical and cynical about people after what Bill had done to her, but she didn't want to teach her son to be that way. She imagined that, someday, a man would say beautiful things to her, and she'd be able to trust what she heard. She believed that a man would love her someday, and she wanted to love him freely in return. \"But that someone isn't you,\" Katie told Bill.\n\n\nKatie said she was sorry that Bill had experienced another epiphany and wanted to return home, but she wasn't his home anymore. She asked him to excuse her so that she could get back to work.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Ridge sat down to sketch. Brooke entered and noted that his work was fabulous. She said she'd sought him out because of his concern for Katie. Brooke let him know that at that very moment, Bill was asking Katie to take him back.\n\n\nRidge assumed that it was some sort of ploy, but Brooke insisted that Bill was serious that time about getting his family back.  Ridge didn't buy it, and he didn't think Bill deserved Katie. Brooke replied that it was up to Katie. Ridge thought that Katie was smart, and he hoped Bill didn't hurt her again.\n\n\nBrooke was glad that Ridge was concerned about Katie, who needed \"our\" support. Ridge called Katie an incredible woman, who'd even been concerned about Bill during his climb. Brooke noted that her sister could be difficult at times. Ridge started to say that Katie had \"always been the most...\"  Brooke assumed he'd wanted to say that Katie had always been the most decent of the Logan women.\n\n\nBrooke decided that they should be happy about a Bill and Katie reunion. Ridge asked if Brooke really thought it would happen, and she said she hoped so. Ridge felt that Bill treated Katie like a second-class citizen, but Brooke felt that Katie knew what was best for herself.\n\n\nBrooke acknowledged that she'd made a mistake, and she'd been lost without Ridge. She said she was getting her priorities straight, and she wanted her family back. Brooke thought that she and Ridge should get their family back on track, just like Bill and Katie were doing.\n\n\nBrooke asked how Ridge felt about it, and he replied that he just didn't want any more drama. She claimed she'd behave, and smiling, he asked what he'd do with her. Ridge decided that he needed more time. He kissed her cheek, and she strode out, telling him not to slack off at work.\n\n\nBrooke exited, and Ridge called Katie to ask if he could congratulate her for not taking Bill back. Katie said she hadn't taken Bill back, and she thanked Ridge for visiting her earlier. Ridge assured her that they'd get through the thing together. The call ended, and Katie and Ridge smiled to themselves.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Quinn entered after Hope had left. Quinn told Liam that she hadn't been able to help overhearing. Liam retorted that she'd been spying again. Quinn corrected that she'd happened by, and she'd heard begging. He told her to stay out of it, but she asked when he'd realize that it was over.\n\n\nLiam asserted that Quinn didn't know him if she thought he'd just give up. Quinn complained about the many times he'd wronged Hope, but he replied that Quinn had orchestrated the last instances. He felt that her actions reflected badly upon Wyatt, but she said that Hope would eventually understand that Quinn had been protecting her.\n\n\nLiam stated that the only things Hope needed protection from were Quinn and her son, and he suspected that no one had seen half of Quinn yet. Quinn warned Liam to respect Hope's decision, and Quinn recalled how he'd almost caused her business and employees a great loss due to his insecurities. He replied that his feelings had been right -- if one considered what had happened.\n\n\nQuinn told Liam that he'd gotten sloppy and complacent, and Hope had moved to a man who valued her. Liam admitted that he didn't know much about the Fullers, but he would bet that they had a lot of secrets. She warned Liam that he didn't know the lengths she'd go to in order to defend her son.\n\n\nLiam guessed that Quinn's words had been meant as a warning, but Quinn retorted that the warning was that the next time, she wouldn't be so friendly. He wondered if she really thought he'd let her do more damage. Liam said he planned to put a stop to her, and in the process, he'd find out what kind of people the Fullers were. With a smug smile, Liam exited the office.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Pam and Charlie teased each other about the treats they'd baked. They decided to play cowboy and cowgirl later, and Pam said she'd wear stilettos.  Liam happened by as the couple discussed Charlie liking stilettos, just not on the jewel thieves. Liam joined the conversation, claiming that he'd love to hear Charlie's perspective on what had occurred.\n\n\nCharlie explained what Wyatt had done with the coffee and cooed about the publicity the event had garnered. Quinn slipped behind a clothes rack and listened in as Liam asked Charlie to say what had really happen. \"I mean, did Wyatt really catch those jewel thieves?\" Liam skeptically asked. \n\n\n",

He wants her back. He wants to love her again. He asks for her to give them a chance. Katie is skeptical. Ridge is back so naturally Bill would come running back to her. He begs her to give them a chance. He vows that he is committed to putting their family back together. She smiles and says part of her would love to have him back with her but she knows he's here because he is out of other options. The first one is off the table. She adds and she is not going to be a consolation prize for any man, not even the father of her child. Some day there will be a man who will love her completely and say beautiful words of love to her and mean them and she will love him back freely. But that man is not Bill. She says they have Will so they will always have a connection. She's sorry if he had another epiphany and wants to come home, but she is not home anymore. He turns and leaves. Quinn walks in on Liam and says she heard begging between him and Hope. She doesn't believe he has a relationship with Hope anymore. They immediately begin sparring and she tells him to stop meddling in Hope and Wyatt's relationship. His interference is over as of today. He scoffs that she doesn't know him very well if she thinks he is going to back away from Hope. He starts in on her bringing Steffy back from Paris and getting her to the cabin. Quinn says she merely did Hope a favor and in time she will realize that she was protecting her. Liam says he doesn't know if Wyatt knows about any of this, but Hope does and does not like it one bit. And the only people that Hope needs protection from is Quinn and her son. Quinn reminds him that Liam almost cost her her livelihood and all those people working for her. But Liam wouldn't care as all he cared about was his insecurities. He says he had a right as look how it all turned out. She walks closer and says he doesn't know how far she will go to protect her son .and he probably doesn't want to know. She says this is no threat, just a friendly warning but next time it might not be so friendly. Liam says that isn't going to stop him. He's going to find out just what kind of people she and her son are, as he bets they have a lot of secrets. Ridge is sketching in the office when Brooke walks in and declares his sketch stunning. She says she has some news. Bill is getting back together right now with Katie. Ridge is not sure he buys that. Brooke makes another pitch to Ridge. She knows she made a mistake but she still wants Ridge. She thinks they can work this out for both her and Katie. She'd like to know where they stand. He says he wants no more drama. She promises they can do that. He says okay but he needs more time. Outside in the hallway Pam and Charlie are exchanging some baked delights and joking about later they can play the Cowboy and the Sexy Stable Girl. He wants to be the Cowboy. Liam saunders by when they are discussing Charlie still being hounded about his part in the jewelry heist. Liam ducks behind the clothes rack and listens. Finally when Charlie keeps dropping the name Wyatt and him being the hero, Liam comes out and joins in the conversation. He says he'd sure like to hear more about this from Charlie's perspective. At Pam's urging, Charlie is only too willing to give every little detail. Quinn walks up just as Liam asks Charlie if that is really the truth \u0096 that Wyatt caught those jewel thieves. Ridge calls Katie and asks if congratulations are in order or did she turn Bill away. She said she did not take him back. He thinks she made the right choice. She deserves the best and Bill Spencer isn't it. They will get through this together. She likes the sound of that.",
