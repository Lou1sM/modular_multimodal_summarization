    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge tried to convince Rick that if he didn't reexamine his relationship with Caroline, Rick would lose her forever. \"Is that what you want?\" Ridge asked. Rick argued that Ridge only wanted to know about Rick's feelings for Caroline because Ridge planned to be there to pick up the pieces.\n\n\nRidge disagreed. He pointed out that Caroline had begged Rick for forgiveness. \"But Ricky, everyone has a limit,\" Ridge said. Rick countered that Ridge had broken the hearts of countless women; Taylor, Brooke, and Katie were among them. Rick chided that Katie had figured out Ridge's pattern and dumped him. \"Caroline's figured that out, too,\" Rick said.\n\n\nRick dredged up ancient history about how Ridge had pursued his mother, but Ridge countered that his history had nothing to do with Rick's recent actions: moving into their father's house and making love to Maya in their father's bed.\n\n\nRidge insisted that there was still a part of Rick that loved Caroline, but Ridge noted that Rick would lose Caroline because she deserved someone who loved, appreciated, and respected her. Rick advised Ridge to steer clear of Caroline because Ridge had never respected a single woman in his life.\n\n\nRidge turned away to leave, but he turned back. \"Tell me one more time. Tell me that you're done with your wife, and I promise this time, I'll believe you,\" Ridge coaxed. Rick remained silent.\n\n\nIn Carter's office, Maya barged in, and Carter told her to leave. He said he wanted to stay neutral in the battle over her portrait hanging in the Forrester mansion. \"Take down the picture, and we'll talk,\" Carter advised. Maya argued that he didn't sound neutral.\n\n\nCarter suggested that Maya didn't see what she had done. Maya paced his office and countered that she was good enough to model the company's clothes and be photographed but not good enough to have her picture on the wall of the Forrester mansion.\n\n\nCarter reminded Maya that her portrait had replaced that of Stephanie -- an incredibly important woman in the Forrester family. Maya explained that Rick had hung it up as an expression of his love and respect for Maya. She added that Eric could replace it when he returned.\n\n\nMaya insisted that people misunderstood why Rick had hung her portrait in place of Stephanie's. She maintained that it was not an act of disrespect to Stephanie, but rather a message of confidence in their future.\n\n\nCarter disagreed. He noted how hurtful it had been to the Forrester family. Maya defended Rick's decision to replace Stephanie's portrait with one of someone who loved Rick. Maya reminded Carter that Stephanie had favored Ridge over everyone her entire life.\n\n\nCarter said it didn't improve her standing with the Forrester family members. Maya shouted that she had no reason to care what the family thought because she deserved to be there. She dished that Caroline had freaked out when she'd seen the painting. Caroline had said it was all about Rick getting back at Caroline. \"The woman is delusional,\" Maya said. Maya maintained that Caroline needed to get over Rick and move on with her life.\n\n\nCarter disagreed. He called Maya a classic rebound. Maya said that Caroline had hurt Rick more than anyone else ever had. Carter argued that Rick had been using Maya to get back at Caroline. Maya disagreed, but Carter said that Rick hadn't had any interest in Maya until Caroline had kissed Ridge.\n\n\nCarter asked if Rick had told Maya that he loved her. Maya paced, and she told Carter not to judge her. Carter gently said that he understood Maya loved the security that Rick offered. Carter noted that Rick had slept with Maya and moved her into his father's house, but he had never professed his love for her.\n\n\nMaya maintained that Rick had shown her that he loved her, but she acknowledged that he had not said it. \"He will,\" Maya said hopefully. She said he had no reason to hold back anymore because everything had fallen into place. Carter looked skeptical.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Caroline met with Aly and Ivy and discussed that Rick had hung a portrait of Maya in place of Stephanie like the mansion was \"under new management.\" Ivy and Aly agreed it had been a sign that Rick was not over Caroline.\n\n\nCaroline lamented that she had apologized for her actions with Ridge and wanted her marriage back. \"Why are you apologizing at all?\" Aly asked. She noted that Rick had done far worse things with Maya than Caroline had ever done with Ridge.\n\n\nIvy asked about Ridge, and Caroline answered that she and Ridge wouldn't work because they were in different places in life. Caroline wanted to start a family, and Ridge had already had a family. Caroline refused to give up on her future with Rick in order \"to chase some impossible dream\" with Ridge.\n\n\nCaroline returned to Forrester, and she found Ridge. He figured she had been looking for Rick. \"Believe me, you don't want see him right now,\" Ridge said. He explained that he had tried to convince Rick that he didn't want to lose Caroline, but he didn't think he'd made a difference. \"I know the feeling,\" Caroline said.\n\n\nCaroline changed the subject, and she looked at Ridge's design. She asked him to cheer her up and tell her what he had been working on. She liked it, and Ridge said it needed a lot of work. He suggested she add something, and he presented the pencil, but she declined.\n\n\nRidge asked if something had happened. \"She's gonna be the new Forrester matriarch,\" Caroline said of Maya. She lamented the picture, but Ridge noted it wouldn't be there for long, and everyone knew that Maya would never be the Forrester matriarch. Caroline maintained that everything with Rick had become a mess and continued to worsen. She hoped that it would improve.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya welcomed Rick home after work, and she poured some martinis. Rick complained about his employees, and Maya teased that it went with the responsibility of being CEO.\n\n\nMaya said that she had looked up the recipe for martinis because she wanted to maintain the Forrester tradition. Maya gushed that she was very lucky to have a man like Rick. She hoped he had felt the same way. Rick and Maya toasted, and Maya looked hopefully at Rick.\n\n\nRick said they were off to a good start and needed to plan for the future. Maya dished that Caroline had been outrageous in her criticism of Maya earlier in the day. Maya added that Caroline and others had felt that the painting had been more about his feelings for Caroline than his feelings for Maya. \"She thinks you're doing it to get back at her. It's not why, right?\" Maya asked.\n\n\nRick looked at the portrait and suggested that it was too bad if it had made Caroline unhappy. Maya said that she had never been happier. \"I love our life together,\" she said. Maya continued that she loved security, glamour, luxury. \"More than all of that, I love you,\" she added.\n\n\nMaya continued to fish for a profession of love from Rick. \"I want to know that I mean as much to you as you do to me ... I need to hear it,\" Maya said with a smile. She said she had been grateful for how Rick had said that she was important to him and that he appreciated her, \"but you never said how you feel ... that you love me,\" she said.\n\n\nRick answered that Maya had been amazing, and he promised that they would do incredible things together. Maya pressed on. \"I just need to know. Can you say you love me?\" Maya asked.\n\n\nIn Carter's office, Ivy, Aly, and Carter reviewed a contract, and conversation quickly turned to Caroline and her reaction to the painting of Maya at the Forrester mansion. Carter pointed out that Maya really loved Rick, and he admired that Caroline did not want to give up on her marriage, but he didn't think Rick cared. Ivy didn't think Rick loved Maya. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Rick senses that Ridge is issuing an unspoken threat to steal Caroline while doling out relationship advice. Unwilling to listen to a man with such a poor track record with women, Rick rehashes all of the broken hearts that Ridge was responsible for throughout the years. Maya is furious when Carter refers to her current role in Rick\u2019s life as a rebound relationship and questions whether or not her feelings are reciprocated. Ivy and Aly are curious as to Caroline\u2019s true feelings as she discusses her recent situation with Rick and Ridge.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Rick that he's only trying to help him. He needs to take Caroline back right now or he will lose her forever. Rick says he knows Ridge is not concerned about him. He is just serving notice that if Rick is not there for Caroline he will be. Rick keeps throwing the names of Ridge's conquests to him and saying they all came to their senses and he figures Caroline will too. Carter tells Maya that replacing Stephanie's portrait wasn't cool. She says it makes sense to her. He just wants her to know how it looks. She does not care how those other people think. And Rick thinks she belongs up there so that is good enough for her. Carter says this is the classic rebound and that it is possible he is using her to get back at Caroline. Caroline talks to Ivy and Aly and shows them the picture and they all agree Rick is just trying to hurt her more. And yet what Rick is doing is so much worse than what Caroline did with a few kisses. Caroline says Ridge taught her a lot but now they are in different places. She is not going to give up her future with Rick to follow some impossible dream with Ridge. Ridge tells Rick that nothing he has done in his past made him hang up that picture of Maya or move her into the bedroom. Rick still refuses to see or believe what Ridge says when he says that if Rick doesn't take Caroline back someone else will, someone who will love and appreciate her. Rick holds out his hand to shake and says Ridge has never appreciated any woman within his touch. Ridge does not shake hands. He tells Rick to please say it one more time and this time he will believe him. He is saying he is done with Caroline. Maya tells Carter that her relationship goes back months with Rick, and Caroline is now out of his life and he came back to her. Carter reminds her that he is not judging her but Rick has not told her that he loves her. He just wants her to be careful. It's good to be on top in the Forrester mansion but it won't last. She says there is no reason to hold back. She will tell Rick tonight that she loves him and he will say it back to her. Caroline comes to the office to find Rick but finds Ridge instead. He says she would not want to talk to Rick right now anyway. She likes what he is working on but she refuses the pencil when he hands it to her and says it needs work. She says Maya says Stephanie can not be replaced yet she says she will be the next matriarch. She thinks she is getting through to Rick but the longer it goes on the worse it gets. The portrait of Maya was like saying \"Under new management.\" Ivy and Aly tell Carter that Rick is not being very subtle. Caroline saw the portrait but she is not giving up. Carter says he is beginning to think this is real. Rick comes home after getting Maya's text. She hands him a martini which she has never made it before .it's a Forrester tradition so she learned. She says she feels so lucky and she hopes he feels the same. She tells him about Caroline being here and that Caroline thinks it is all about his feelings for her and not Maya. He says he can not help if it hurts her. They are just trying to lead their lives. She tells him she loves the security that all of this makes her feel, but more than that she loves him and she needs to hear him say it .how important she is to him and how he appreciates her support. He wants to know where this is all coming from. She repeats again that she loves him; can he say the same?",
