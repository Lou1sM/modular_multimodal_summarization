Brooke wondered if they should postpone. Thomas asserted that he was ready for Eric to decide things, and Rick agreed.\n\n\nEric permitted Dayzee to watch the showing because he was interested in her reactions to the designs. Marcus joked that it was too bad that they'd see nothing from the lingerie line that day. Brooke asked where Steffy was, and Donna seemed reluctant to tell Brooke that Steffy had gone to Paris to see her father. With a thin smile, Brooke said that Ridge would be happy to see Steffy.\n\n\nBeginning the presentation, Eric remarked upon the changes that had taken place with Ridge no longer wanting to be there. Retirement without Stephanie seemed pointless to Eric, and he needed an heir to Forrester Creations by his side. He appreciated how hard Thomas and Rick had worked up to that point. Eric said he'd only choose one president, and the winner would run Forrester with him.\n\n\nFirst, Thomas made his case for working alongside Eric. Thomas positioned himself as a creative designer, capable of putting his ideas on paper. Though he respected his grandparents' legacy, Thomas believed the company had to push boundaries. He believed he was the only one to help them stay ahead of the trends and build upon the founding traditions with the technology available to them.\n\n\nPam cued the music, and Thomas' designs hit the runway. There were outfits from three categories of clothes: a casual dress, a pantsuit, and a formal gown. The models showed off their outfits, and everyone applauded.\n\n\nUp next, Rick took the stage and reminded everyone that, contrary to what Thomas thought, Forrester had always done the very things that Thomas had spoken about, and it would always do those things. Rick said that he and Caroline had collaborated on the delicate balance of what was new and what was timeless. Rick claimed he'd continue to raise the bar, and he and Caroline understood that they had to do more than follow trends. \"We need to transcend them,\" Rick concluded.\n\n\nPam started the music, and Caroline and Rick's designs hit the runway to Juliana Joya's song, \"Crazy Good.\" Three models showed off outfits in the same categories as Thomas' models had, and everyone applauded.\n\n\nThomas' models reappeared, and Thomas rolled his eyes at Rick, who stood confidently with his models on the opposite side of the runway. Thorne congratulated his brother and nephew on their work, and Brooke said the company would flourish no matter whom Eric chose. Eric then announced that he'd made his decision.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Steffy was astonished to see that her pregnancy test was positive. She picked up her phone and thought of how she'd tell Liam the news. Shaking her head, she decided to go home. As she exited, Steffy left her purse and the test box in her office. While driving, Steffy flashed back to everything that she and Liam had done together after the Italy trip, and she grinned.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Hope explained that she'd been too busy micromanaging how life should be, and she hadn't been able to enjoy it or Liam. Hope had figured out that she could live her life and promote her values without being a drag. She was sorry that she'd believed her brother over Liam, and she wanted another chance.\n\n\nHope explained that they couldn't change the past, but they could make things right for the future. Liam said she made it sound so easy. Smiling, Hope asserted that they could do anything as long as they believed in each other. She asked where they'd be if others hadn't interfered. Liam guessed they'd be married. \"I was gonna say in bed, but that works, too,\" Hope replied with a sultry grin.\n\n\nHope felt that she and Liam owed it to themselves to pick up where they'd left off before Steffy, Rick, and Bill had interfered. Hope realized that Steffy had turned over a new leaf, but Hope didn't think that changed everything Steffy had done. Glad that Steffy had gone to Paris, Hope declared that it was her and Liam's time.\n\n\nLiam reminded Hope that he was living with Steffy, and he couldn't just ship out all of her things. Hope said not to worry because she'd donate the stuff to a nice charity for out-of-work biker chicks. They laughed, and she said being nice had never gotten them anywhere. She refused to give up the battle for the life that they deserved, and she wondered what had happened that couldn't be undone.\n\n\nLiam still seemed unsure, and Hope said she understood that he had feelings for Steffy. Hope didn't know why, though, after all of Steffy's lies and manipulations; however, Hope said he wasn't married to Steffy or otherwise tied to her, and it was Hope and Liam's time.\n\n\nHope found Steffy's jacket in a chair and then decided that she needed a suitcase or trash bag. Gasping, Liam followed Hope into the bedroom, where she was clearing Steffy's stuff from a drawer. Dumping the clothes on the bed, Hope declared, \"I'm through being nice. I'm coming home.\"\n\n\nHope threw more clothes from the drawers on the bed, and she insisted that she and Liam were returning to who they'd been before Bill had totally screwed them. Hope cited that Steffy had suspected Bill, but she'd said nothing. Hope asserted that Steffy only told the truth when it benefited herself.\n\n\nLiam asked what Hope wanted him to do because he was in a committed relationship with Steffy. Hope huffed that he'd been committed to her first, and Liam shot back that he'd begged and begged her.\n\n\nAt that point, Hope and Liam were arguing in each other's faces. Hope yelled that it should be her bedroom, he should be her husband, and she'd never stopped loving Liam. \"You know what? I love you, too!\" Liam yelled back. Suddenly, they grabbed each other and passionately kissed.\n\n\nOutside the house, Steffy stood at the front door, where she realized she didn't have her key. She strode around to the bedroom patio door, but before she could open it, she saw Liam and Hope making out on the bed. \n\n\n",
