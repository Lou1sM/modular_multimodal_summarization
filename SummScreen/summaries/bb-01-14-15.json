Rick tried to convince Maya that she had always known how he felt about her. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he asked. Maya praised Rick. She told him again that she loved him and asked him to say the same about her. Rick hedged and told her that he showed her every day and night how he felt about her.\n\n\nMaya thanked Rick, but she confided that she needed to hear the three little words from him, or she didn't want to stay at the mansion. She conveyed that it was very important to her. Rick sweet-talked Maya, and he complained that he had been overwhelmed with \"assassins\" at Forrester. Rick thanked Maya for standing by him and being so important to him.\n\n\nMaya was not swayed. She told Rick that she would always be there for him, but she noted that he'd recently shown her that he enjoyed power and revenge. She worried that he had done some things to get back at Caroline. Rick disagreed. He reminded Maya that he had kicked Caroline out of the guesthouse and didn't care about her at all.\n\n\nMaya pressed on. She told Rick she loved him, but she refused to stay if he couldn't tell her the same thing. She walked toward the door, but Rick stopped her. \"I can't let you leave,\" Rick said. Maya told him that if he didn't feel the same way, she planned to leave. \"I do. I love you,\" Rick said. Maya smiled. \"I mean it,\" Rick said.\n\n\nRick confided that he had wanted to say it, but hadn't been. He apologized. He told Maya that he didn't deserve her, but he was very grateful that she was someone he could trust. \"I can't imagine not having you in my life,\" he gushed.\n\n\nMaya smiled. \"We're just getting started,\" she said. They kissed passionately. Maya pulled Rick upstairs. He started to disrobe on the way up the stairs. Maya and Rick made out and made love. Afterwards, they cuddled, and Maya maintained that they were blessed with each other, a wonderful home, and a successful business.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Caroline talked to Ridge. She worried that Rick had fallen for Maya, but she refused to give up on her marriage. At some point, Ridge advised she had to give up on her angry, belligerent, and unreasonable husband. Ridge grabbed Caroline and begged her to promise that she would no longer play Rick's game. Caroline agreed, but she said she was unwilling to give up her marriage.\n\n\nCaroline professed that she'd made vows, but Ridge noted that Rick had also made vows. Ridge wondered why Rick had not tried to work it out with Caroline if Rick truly loved her. Ridge worried that Caroline would be disappointed. Caroline said she had faith, but Ridge asked her how long that would continue.\n\n\nRidge reminded her that Rick had been intentionally hurting her. \"What kind of man does that? You're better than this,\" Ridge said. He wondered how much more she would take. Caroline acknowledged that Rick had been pushing her, and she wondered how he could possibly love Maya.\n\n\nCaroline was convinced she could change Rick's mind. She called Rick on FaceTime, and she asked if she had caught him at a bad time. Suddenly, she noticed that Rick and Maya were in bed together. Caroline was disgusted, and she hung up.\n\n\nRidge told her he was sorry. \"Your marriage is over,\" Ridge said. Caroline furiously said that Rick had done it all on purpose, and Ridge discouraged her from living a fantasy. Ridge claimed that Rick was not the guy she'd married. \"I think he's still in there,\" Caroline said.\n\n\nRidge said he felt sorry for Caroline. He advised that the battle was not worth fighting. \"He wants to blame other people for his shortcomings. Let him go. You deserve better,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nCaroline said she didn't know what to do. She couldn't take it anymore, and she couldn't stand that she had to report to Rick with Maya gloating by his side. \"What should I do? Tell me,\" Caroline said. Ridge stepped close to Caroline and kissed her passionately. She kissed him back. They paused and began kissing again.\n\n\nIn Carter's office, Ivy, Aly, and Carter discussed that Maya really did love Rick, but Ivy questioned whether Rick felt the same about Maya. Ivy said Rick was still in love with Caroline. Carter shared that Rick had never told Maya that he loved her.\n\n\nIvy and Aly maintained that Rick was cold and bitter. Carter said he believed it was all payback for Caroline hurting him. Carter was convinced that Maya would end up disappointed. They all agreed that Rick had punished Caroline with his relationship with Maya.\n\n\nCarter worried that Maya had been getting in deeper with Rick. Ivy wondered how long it would take for Caroline to lose patience. She added that they all had known that one guy appreciated Caroline: Ridge. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Rick is put on the spot when Maya asks him if he truly loves her or if he is using her to get back at Caroline. Feeling vulnerable and apprehensive, Maya threatens to leave if Rick doesn\u2019t give her a straight answer to her reasonable question. Regardless of her unwavering desire to reunite with Rick, Ridge advises Caroline against fighting a losing battle. Caroline unexpectedly stumbles upon heartbreaking evidence that proves that Ridge\u2019s words are valid.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Maya tells Rick that she needs to hear him say it when he tells her that she knows how he feels about her. She admits that yes he makes her feel wanted and important but she needs to know that she is loved. He says it seems obvious. She continues that he is the most wonderful man that she knows and she is so excited about their future together. She says she loves him but she'd like to know that he feels the same about her. Those three words mean everything to her. She says she does not want to pressure him and she does not want him to say it unless he truly means it but if he can't . then this is not what she expected. Apparently with nothing more to do at their jobs, Aly, Ivy and Carter stand around and discuss Maya's situation. Carter says Maya enjoys the finer things in life and she makes no bones about it. He thinks she is genuinely into this. Caroline explains to Ridge that Maya's picture is now upon the wall instead of his mother's. Ridge doesn't know why Caroline puts up with Rick. This is all part of his game. Everybody has their limit. She says she is just not there yet. Ridge muses that yes he knows; Rick knows it too. He tries to get her to say she will not give in to this anymore, but she says she is just not ready to give up on her marriage. He doesn't want her to be disappointed. She says she will just have to have faith. He says faith is good but what if Rick still doesn't forgive her. Rick tells Maya that he can not do this alone. He is CEO but he is surrounded by a lot of assassins who want to see him fail. She says he is not alone. He has her. He says he knows. She has been loyal and supportive and he wants her in his life. But he avoids the obvious question if he loves her and she corners him if he is with her just to get back at Caroline. He declares that he kicked her out of the guest house and he is filing for divorce. He wants nothing to do with her anymore. She says she loves him but she thinks she needs to leave. He either does or he doesn't but he's not saying. Finally as she walks away he grabs her arm and says he does feel that way. He loves her. He says he doesn't know what he has done to deserve her. She is someone he can trust. She is happy again and says those words mean so much to her. They kiss and she says she is not going anywhere. This has just begun. She takes his hands and slowly leads him up the stairs and ends in the bedroom. At the same time Caroline is talking to Ridge she calls Rick. He answers and even answers her question that he is with Maya in bed. Caroline is furious and hangs up. Ridge holds her and says he is so sorry. The marriage is over. She can't understand why Rick is doing this. He wanted her to see him in bed with Maya otherwise he would not have answered the phone. Ridge says as he has been telling her, enough is enough. It's over now. Rick hasn't been her husband in a long time so she can not hold onto that fantasy anymore. She says Rick is in there somewhere. He's not happy with Maya. He has to be pretending. Ridge says Rick is trying to hurt her but she deserves better. She raises her voice and says what is she supposed to do. Ridge needs to tell her. After three or four of these, he cups her face and kisses her and that follows with several more.",
