Relieved Aly was okay, Thorne picked up his daughter and hugged her. Upset with both of them, Aly screamed at Thorne that she hated Taylor and didn't understand how he could marry the woman that had killed her mother. \n\n\nThorne admitted that at first he had blamed Taylor, but then he had realized it had been an accident, and he had forgiven her. Taylor tried to explain to Aly how hard she had tried to keep her car from hitting Darla. When they got back to Thorne's house Aly ran to bed, still upset with the whole situation. \n\n\nOnce Thorne and Taylor were alone, he tried to comfort her by telling her that once Aly had time to process it, she would forgive Taylor just like he had. Taylor doubted it would be that easy, pointing out that he was an adult, and it had taken him a while -- and a child might never be able to accept it. Taylor told him they couldn't get married as long as Aly felt that way. Ever optimistic, Thorne gave her a hug then told her he loved her and in time Aly would \"come around.\" \n\n\nAt the Forresters', Bridget confessed to Eric that she had allowed Shane to stay at her place for a few days so she could keep an eye on him and Phoebe. Then they discussed the Nick situation.  Bridget understood why Eric was upset with Nick.  Eric angrily told her that a sailor had no business running a fashion company. Bridget defended Nick, saying that he had done it mainly for his mother. \n\n\nEric acknowledged that what Stephanie had done to Jackie was horrible, but he thought Bridget was lying to herself if she didn't realize Nick's actions had more to do with Brooke. Eric worried that Bridget was still hung up on Nick.  Bridget assured her father she was keeping her distance but admitted that she still had feelings for him. Bridget wistfully thought things would have turned out differently for them if she had known about Nick's troubled childhood. \n\n\nAt Taylor's, Brooke dropped by to see how things were going with Aly and was surprised to find Nick there. He explained that Taylor had rushed off to Thorne's to try to make things better after Aly had found out the truth.  Brooke thought it was nice that he was waiting for Taylor to get back, but not appropriate. She scolded him about his recent actions toward the Forresters.  Not wanting to discuss it, Nick told her he'd had to move on, and Brooke was shocked when he handed her divorce papers.   \n\n\nSuspicious, Brooke told Nick he wouldn't be so anxious to get the divorce papers signed unless something else was going on in his life.  She asked him if it was Taylor, but before he could answer, Taylor walked in. Taylor was an emotional wreck from what had just happened, and Nick tried to comfort her. Nick told Taylor once more that he believed she was only marrying Thorne out of guilt. \n\n \nAnnoyed by Nick's obvious interest in Taylor, Brooke said Taylor was a grown woman and could make her own decisions. Brooke watched as Nick continued to fawn over Taylor, until she could take it no more and demanded to know if something was going on between them. \n\n\n",
