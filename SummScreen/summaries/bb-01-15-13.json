She looked in the window to the bedroom and saw Liam making out with Hope on the bed -- on top of Steffy's clothes that Hope had removed from the drawers.\n\n\nSteffy left and recalled a few of her adventures and passionate times with Liam. Steffy flashed back to how Liam had declared his loyalty after he had found out what Bill had done to keep Liam away from Hope. Then, tears streamed down her face as she recalled seeing her pregnancy test results. She cried when visions of Liam and Hope making out on the bed resurfaced.\n\n\nInside the beach house, Liam stopped himself before he and Hope had started to remove their clothes. Hope kissed Liam and said they had already waited too long. She had grown tired of worrying about what was right. She reasoned nothing was impossible if they believed in one another. Liam agreed, but he didn't want to make an instant decision. Liam lamented that he could not be disrespectful of Steffy.\n\n\nLater, Hope sat in the living room, and Liam joined her. He felt that they had gotten out of control in the bedroom. Hope remembered that Liam had said that too much had happened between them, and too much had gotten in the way. Hope noted that everything had finally fallen into place. \n\n\nHope pointed out that everything that had been in their way had not been their fault. Bill, Rick, and Othello had tricked them. She promised that nothing else would get in their way.\n\n\nLiam hugged Hope. He wondered how they could be together. Hope knew they didn't want to wreck other people's lives, but she added that they had been victims. She said that outside forces had kept them apart. She said they had learned the truth, and they deserved the chance they had missed. \"We were robbed, Liam,\" Hope said, insisting, \"Let's make it right.\"\n\n\nLiam said that his head was spinning, and passion was burning inside him. \"I love you; I always have,\" Liam said. He agreed they had been cheated, but he needed time to figure out what to do, and he wanted to show Steffy the respect she had deserved. He didn't want to hurt anyone.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric complimented Thomas and Rick on their presentations. He said it had been a difficult decision. Donna begged Eric to stop being a diplomat and announce the winner. Before Eric announced the president, he insisted that they were all on the same team. \n\n\nRick and Thomas sniped that there could only be one president, and Eric interrupted that he was still the CEO. He reiterated that Forrester was a family business and they needed to work together, trust each other, and depend on each other.\n\n\nEric announced that Thomas was going to become the co-head designer to fuel the renaissance of the company. Eric named Rick as the new company president. Eric apologized to Thomas but added that Rick had a lot of tenure at the company and international experience. Eric wanted Thomas to work with Eric on designs, and it was the job of the president to move the company forward and convince the buyers, employees, customers, and shareholders that they were moving in the right direction. Rick had the experience to do that, Eric noted.\n\n\nEric reminded Thomas that Ridge and Eric had been one of the best design teams in the world for many years. Eric wanted to do the same thing with Thomas, but Thomas was angry. \n\n\nThomas said that he should be the owner of Forrester because Stephanie had given him her shares before she had changed her mind. Thomas was not satisfied as co-head designer. He admitted that he should have been grateful, but he was not. He left. Brooke told Eric that they all trusted Eric's decision.\n\n\nThorne, Donna, Marcus, Brooke, Pam, and Caroline congratulated Rick, who later met alone with his father. Rick emotionally thanked Eric for the opportunity. Eric noted that Rick's presentation had been excellent. \"I couldn't be more proud,\" Eric told Rick.\n\n\nEric left the office, and Rick sat in the president's chair. Caroline joined him and sat on his lap. Caroline said Rick was running the entire company -- it was his legacy. Rick noted that he had to answer every day to clients, employees, and stockholders. Rick teased that he would be working a lot of overtime, and Caroline would to. Caroline said she looked forward to it. They made out.\n\n\nTaylor entered Steffy's office and prepared to write her a note. Thomas sulked into the room and moaned that his granddad had chosen his son Rick to run the company. Taylor sympathized. Thomas whined that he had grown tired of Brooke's family always ending up on top. Taylor agreed, but she warned Thomas not to give up. Thomas left. \n\n\nTaylor turned to Steffy's desk, where she saw the pregnancy test box sticking out of Steffy's purse. Taylor was shocked. Steffy interrupted and told Taylor that she had to catch a flight but had forgotten her purse. Taylor quizzed Steffy about what was wrong. \n\n\nSteffy hurriedly grabbed her stuff. Taylor inquired why Ridge wanted to see Steffy, but Steffy ignored her and headed toward the door. Taylor asked why Steffy had missed the announcement about the fashion challenge. Steffy stopped in her tracks.\n\n\nTaylor announced that Eric had named Rick as the new company president. Taylor asked about the pregnancy test. Steffy dismissed Taylor's concerns and warned that Taylor was to say nothing to anyone about the test. Steffy said the timing was all wrong. \n\n\nSteffy made Taylor promise to keep her mouth shut, and Steffy left. Taylor stared at a picture of Liam and Steffy on Steffy's desk. Taylor recalled everything that Steffy had said. \"A baby,\" Taylor said.\n\n\nAt the airport, Steffy sat in her seat on the plane. She cried and recalled her conversation with Taylor. She remembered Liam kissing Hope. A man sat down next to Steffy and asked if she was all right. Steffy rudely said that she was fine, and she told him to leave her alone. She cried and looked out the window. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy is heartbroken as she peers through the window at Hope and Liam kissing and rollicking on the bed in each other's arms. They are hot and heavy, but Liam pulls away and says they can not do this. This is not fair to Steffy. Meanwhile Steffy has seen enough and drives away. Eric tells the group that the last thing that he wants is this to be a rift in the family. This is a family business and they have to trust each other and work together as one. They've made their cases and now he needs to make his. He congratulates them individually for their stunning, innovative designs. He names Thomas as the new co-head designer but Rick as the President. He explains to Thomas that Rick's experience at International gives him the tools to do this and Eric's and Thomas's designs can lead them into the future. Thomas says he can not be happy with being co-head designer and walks out. All of them congratulate Rick and he tells Eric that he is looking forward to this as he knows he can't run Forrester alone. Thomas catches Taylor in Steffy's office as she is leaving her a note. She doesn't have to even ask how the morning went; she sees it on his face. Taylor spies the pregnancy box hanging half way out of Steffy's bag. She picks it up and looks at it skeptically. Steffy catches her and makes her promise to secrecy. She wants Taylor just to treat her like a patient now and say nothing, not even to Liam. The timing is wrong and she needs to give it more thought before revealing it. Caroline is there for Rick to help him celebrate being Mr. President. He tells her it will mean a lot of long hours behind the desk and he hopes she does not mind overtime. Liam tries to explain to Hope why they had to stop. She counters with that now that everyone knows the truth, there is no reason they can not get back together. She offers that neither of them are people who want to wreck people's lives, but it was outside forces that divided them. They were robbed and they need to make it right, the way it was supposed to be. He admits that he loves Hope and he feels cheated, but he will not do this to Steffy what was done to Hope. He needs time. Steffy is on the plane, alone and crying when the young man claims his seat next to hers. He asks if she is all right and she stammers yes, just leave her alone.",
