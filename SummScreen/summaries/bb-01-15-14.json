Wyatt countered that they knew how they felt about each other, and it only made sense for them not to waste time apart.\n\n\nHope suggested that it was too big of a step. She wanted to take their relationship slowly. Wyatt disagreed. \"Say yes, Hope -- when have I ever steered you wrong?\" Wyatt asked. Hope smiled and said that she loved Wyatt's spontaneity. She loved that he was always fun, adventurous, and unafraid to take chances.\n\n\nWyatt added that he had been an incredibly patient man. Hope wondered if Wyatt had lived with anyone other than his mother. Wyatt admitted that he had not. He wondered if his inexperience in the cohabitation department was a good thing.  \"I will come visit you a lot,\" Hope said. Wyatt kissed her.\n\n\nWyatt worried that they had always been good together. He didn't want to miss a window of opportunity. Wyatt worried that Hope had always gone back to Liam. Wyatt blamed Liam for letting Hope down and pulling her back in. Wyatt refused to allow it to happen again.\n\n\nHope added that she didn't want to rush things and have the appearance of a rebound relationship. Wyatt agreed. He admitted that it might not help the Hope for the Future brand if they moved too quickly. Hope nodded, but she said that she did want to take their relationship public. She was proud of what they had accomplished together personally and professionally.  \n\n\nWyatt complimented Hope on all that she had done and her status as a role model. He recognized that it was important to do things that would work well on a public level. He gushed that Hope had flawless beauty and incredible strength and integrity all in one priceless package. They kissed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn quizzed Pam about what Liam had wanted to do with all the details about the jewel heist. Quinn wondered if Liam had planned an article, and Pam felt it would be wonderful to see Charlie in a magazine article. Quinn looked worried. Pam told Quinn that Charlie and Liam were at the boutique. Quinn said she had to leave, but Aly interrupted. Aly insisted that staff needed Quinn in the showroom. Quinn was irritated, but she headed to the showroom.\n\n\nAt the Forrester Rodeo Drive boutique, Charlie explained to Liam that he and Wyatt had been among the last of the Forrester employees in the building when the heist occurred. Charlie said he had been shooing the remaining customers out the door while Wyatt had told a few remaining sales employees that they could leave. When Charlie had turned back to look at the diamond, it had been gone. Liam looked suspicious.\n\n\nCharlie suspected that Liam wanted to accuse Wyatt of being involved in the heist, and Charlie defended Wyatt. Liam insisted that he wanted to know what had happened  -- he didn't mean to make accusations. Charlie did admit that it seemed fishy. Charlie promised to review the security footage and call Liam if he found anything. Liam left. \n\n\nLater, when Charlie reviewed the surveillance videos, he didn't see anything extraordinary. Charlie looked closer and discovered that Wyatt had indeed removed the necklace -- it was visible in a mirror in the security footage. \"Liam was right,\" Charlie said. Charlie picked up the phone to call Liam, and Quinn showed up. Quinn ordered Charlie to put the phone down.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Aly worried that she had offended Quinn. Aly asked Pam if that was the case. Pam told her not to worry. Liam showed up and asked Aly and Pam about Hope.  Liam said that Hope had not returned any of his messages, and he had been worried. Pam had to leave, and Aly wondered what had happened. Liam said that he needed to talk to Aly in private.\n\n\nAly and Liam entered an office, and Liam explained what he believed had happened at the boutique. He confessed that he felt Wyatt had somehow been involved in the heist -- and not as a hero. Liam worried that Hope was in danger because Quinn and Wyatt would do anything to stay involved in Forrester and in Hope's life. \n\n\nAly argued that Liam's scenario of Wyatt having a role in stealing the necklace was farfetched. Aly felt Wyatt had no reason to take the necklace because robbers had been there to steal it, and the thieves were seasoned criminals experienced in jewel heists. Liam maintained that Wyatt had done it all as part of a publicity stunt. Aly said it didn't add up, and Aly doubted that Quinn or Wyatt would do anything to hurt Hope.\n\n\nAly pointed out that a stunt was an extreme way to increase sales, but Liam argued that Quinn and Wyatt would do whatever it took. Liam noted that Quinn had forged notes and flown halfway around the world to get Steffy to return and ruin Liam and Hope's wedding. Aly tried to calm Liam. Aly said she knew that Quinn had done horrible things to Liam, but Aly maintained that Quinn and Wyatt would never hurt Hope. Liam disagreed. He felt that Hope was in danger. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope is shocked that Wyatt wants her to move in with him in his new digs. He admits that it is too fast and they should wait, but why. They know how they feel about each other and they should just do it. She mentions that she was ready to take it slow. He says okay, she can just move in one shoebox at a time. He tells her to say yes, has he ever steered her wrong? He asks her what does his past have to do with this. She reminds him that he just asked her to move in with him so that is a valid question. She asks pointblank if he has ever lived with anyone before. He quips what - in his one tiny little loft room in the warehouse. He tells her that he knows why she is hesitant but his inexperience in the co-habitation department is a plus. He assures her that she is the only person that he's ever wanted to share his life with. He says this place is amazing and the only thing to make it better is living there with her. She says she will come visit him a lot and he says he will hold her to that. She hopes he is not upset with her. He says no, he knew it was a long shot but he's a spontaneous guy. Hope says that is what she likes about him. He's full of fun and adventure, the way he looks at the world and not afraid of taking chances. But they don't have to rush this. He says he will ask her again and she says she hopes he does. Wyatt says but then there is Liam. He keeps letting her down but pulling her back in. He's not going to let him do that anymore. Hope tells Wyatt that he is not her rebound guy, but if they move in too fast then it will look that way to others. He agrees. He says they have worked too hard for HFTF to have it undermined by their relationship. How people perceive her will affect the label. That's why the diamond was a perfect tie in for her line. He wants to make sure that she continues to have her message heard. Quinn asks Pam if Liam went to the Boutique with Charlie. She asks if he is writing an article about the jewel heist. Pam says Quinn is probably right and that is why Liam was asking so many questions. At the Boutique Liam is still asking questions of Charlie, even getting him to re-enact his exact movements before the heist. Then alone Charlie watches the footage from the surveillance tape. Liam goes back to Forrester and runs into Aly and she answers Liam's question about Quinn not being there at work. She wants to talk to him about the Boutique so he steers her into the Executive office so they can talk privately. Liam gloats to her that he thinks he got him. He thinks Wyatt is involved and now he's got him. He tells her that he's got Charlie looking at the Boutique tape now, but he found out he and Wyatt were alone in the store that day. According to Charlie it was there and then it wasn't. And the thieves passed their polygraph test today so it is suspect how the diamond got in their purse. Wyatt benefited the most by coming out as the hero. And he got Hope. Aly can't see how Wyatt could have been involved in just publicity as the thieves were real. Liam admits he hasn't figured out that part yet. Aly tells him that she is sorry for the wedding being cancelled but to try and tie Wyatt to this doesn't make sense. He keeps insisting the guy has no boundaries and Hope is not safe and she needs to know that. Until now it's all been Quinn but if he could just prove that Wyatt is just as involved. Aly says she knows Liam feels this way and maybe Quinn has done some questionable things but she does not feel either of them would hurt Hope. Charlie is about to give up on the tape when he spots one more frame, one that shows Wyatt taking the diamond off the display cone. He picks up the phone to call Liam when a voice behind him tells him to hang up the phone. He turns around to see Quinn glaring at him.",
