    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge and Caroline kissed. Ridge asked her to say what she wanted, and she eagerly locked lips with him again. He pressed her against the desk, but she apologetically pulled away. He told her not to apologize and said he wanted whatever she wanted.\n\n\nCaroline said that if they did something, they couldn't go back. Ridge stated that whatever he and Caroline did, the past was lost. Rick and Katie were gone, and the only thing left was the desire for something he and Caroline hadn't had before. She wasn't sure she was ready. He said he wasn't pushing, and she could take or leave him.\n\n\nCaroline didn't like feeling as if she'd failed. She'd wanted to stay married and believed she could have made it last. Citing his own failures, Ridge said he hadn't gotten beyond Brooke having an affair with her sister's husband, but he'd wound up doing it with his brother's wife. Caroline said they hadn't had an affair. \"No, we were just kissing,\" Ridge joked, but he added, \"We both know it was more than that.\"\n\n\nCaroline asked what Ridge saw in her. She mentioned her aunt Caroline, and Ridge readily said Caroline wasn't her aunt. He acknowledged that she did look like her aunt, and she sometimes reminded him of her aunt; however, he wasn't living in the past, and he knew exactly who stood before him.\n\n\nRidge became emotional as he described the late Caroline as steady, deliberate, and sweet. He said that Caroline wasn't sweet or deliberate -- not reckless, but not deliberate, either. With a coquettish tilt of her head, Caroline agreed that she wasn't sweet or reckless.\n\n\nCaroline neared Ridge, and nose-to-nose with him, she admitted that if things were purely physical, she would have acted already. He agreed and poised himself to kiss her. Pulling back, he said he wasn't seducing her. \"Maybe I'm the one. Maybe I'm seducing you,\" she uttered, and they kissed.\n\n\nCaroline pulled back. Catching her by the waist, Ridge told her that she couldn't do that. She playfully argued that he had to let her. He said she could lead, and he'd follow, but \"you can't [stop] in the middle of it. You can't.\" Caroline grinned and moved in to devour him.\n\n\nAgain, Caroline pulled back. That time, she asked if they had room in their lives for it. They worked together and had to consider their families. Ridge was sure it would be a difficult and a little messy, but it would also be fantastical. He asked her what she wanted. \"You,\" she replied, and he smiled. \"Time,\" she added. He agreed to it and said they could wait.\n\n\nRocking with Ridge as if they were dancing, Caroline said she wanted it to last. \"This part,\" she added, excitedly waving her hand between them to indicate the chemistry and the getting to know each other. Still smiling, he said he didn't want her to run. The gleeful Caroline asked where she'd go.\n\n\nRidge's smile disappeared, and he stared knowingly and vulnerably at Caroline. Caroline stated that she couldn't close her eyes and jump, but she wouldn't run. He smiled again, and she kissed him.\n\n\nThe two cuddled on the sofa, and Ridge stroked Caroline's hair. He asked her what was wrong. She was thinking of the next day -- or trying not to think of it. He advised her to just enjoy the day at hand. \"This feels good,\" he added, pressing his chin against her forehead. She agreed and decided that they should pay attention to what felt right, because being close had felt impossible only an hour earlier.\n\n\nRidge remarked that it felt like what happiness could be -- if only for a minute. Caroline sat up and said she didn't know if she'd been trying to find happiness. \"What if -- all along, it was trying to find me?\" she asked. Ridge kissed and hugged her.\n\n\nIn bed at the mansion, Maya asked Rick if he'd ever slept in the master bedroom. Rick recalled sleeping there once when Stephanie and Eric had been away. Rick had wanted to see how his dad slept after divorcing Brooke. He'd awakened to Stephanie shrieking upon discovering him in her bed.\n\n\nMaya asked if Stephanie had been awful to Rick. Rick said one never knew what side of Stephanie he would get, but it wasn't like that with Maya. Maya, who'd made her share of mistakes, said he should love her because she was good to him, not because she was good. He said statements like that were why he wanted her picture on his wall, and she promised to make the best life for him.\n\n\nMaya retrieved some fruit from a bowl in the hallway. Rick didn't know what a clementine was, and she joked that he'd never been to a grocery store. She stated that she'd go for him and get him all the food he needed. She offered to peel the clementine.\n\n\nRick marveled at the way Maya spoke to him with so much love. He didn't know if he deserved it. Maya said people didn't get what they deserved in life -- they got what they were given and what they could take. \"Take me,\" she uttered, and they began having sex.\n\n\nLater, Rick and Maya discussed how her family had treated her as if she wouldn't amount to anything. She wished they could see that she'd turned out okay. She asked if she and Rick would last. He said he'd normally say it was up to them; however, they couldn't see into the future. Maya claimed that her superpower enabled her to see it.\n\n\nDownstairs, Ivy and Aly arrived. Aly scowled at the empty martini glasses in the living room. The women weren't sure if they should yell out, announcing that they were home, but they speculated that the alternative would be to walk in on something they didn't want to.\n\n\nAly found out that Rosaria, the cook, had made dinner for Rick and Maya. Ivy wondered where the two were. \"Well, we wouldn't want Rosaria's cooking to go to waste, now, would we?\" Aly asked. Ivy called the bedroom upstairs. Rick answered and was irritated to get her call. She informed him about dinner being ready, but he said he had everything he wanted upstairs.\n\n\nAfter the call, Ivy decided that the meal was hers and Aly's. Aly remarked that Maya was glued to Rick's wallet, but Ivy didn't think Rick's wallet was in play at the moment. Aly didn't understand Rick. Ivy said it was a powerful thing for someone to back \"you\" no matter what, and Aly nodded, saying she had that with Oliver. Ivy hoped to have it one day, too.\n\n\nAly asked if Ivy thought Caroline would give up. Ivy didn't know why Caroline hadn't done it yet. In Ivy's view, Rick wasn't sending mixed messages. Ivy wondered if Caroline was afraid of letting go.\n\n\nBack upstairs, Maya insisted upon fetching wine from the basement. As Rick explained that the wine cellar was like a vault. He indicated that the vault protected the wine in case of an earthquake.\n\n\nOnce Maya was gone, Rick checked the nightstand drawer beside him. He reached across the bed to check the other one, and his face stiffened as he stared into the open drawer. Maya returned to ask what kind of wine Rick wanted and noticed his stiff expression. He claimed that nothing was wrong; he'd just realized that he was looking on Stephanie's side of the bed.\n\n\nRick asked Maya not to take too long reading the wine bottles. Maya offered to take a course in wines, and Rick, who'd lived in France, replied that he'd teach her. She promised to learn to be a good hostess and not to embarrass Rick. He said she never had and never could. Maya said she loved him and flounced off to get the wine. With a grim expression, Rick pulled a revolver out of Stephanie's drawer. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge and Caroline kiss passionately. She says if they do this they can not go back. Whatever they do or don't do it will be lost. He is not with Katie and Rick has moved on. They both want something they have not had before. Maya and Rick are snuggled in bed and she asks if he has ever slept in here before. He laughs that yes although it wasn't even overnight. All were away except the staff and he came in and climbed in the bed to see how it felt to be his dad .until he was startled by a screaming Stephanie who had returned and was stunned that Brooke's son was in her bed. Maya says she had made mistakes but she wants to be good to him. He says that is why he put her picture on the wall. They hug and kiss when she says she will make the best wife for him. They do joke that he does not know what a small orange, actually a tangerine is, since he's only been to a grocery store once. Ivy and Aly walk into the Forrester home and wonder if Maya and Rick are there and are afraid to barge in and find out or see something they don't want to see. They notice the clothes strewn on the staircase. And they decide not to let the family dinner go to waste and make plans to serve it on the coffee table. Maya tells Rick that she thought she heard a car. Rick says there is always someone coming or going not to mention Aly and Ivy. Maya says wishes her family could see her now. They always thought she'd never amount to anything. Every choice was a catastrophe and it almost was. She asks if they will last and he says it is up to them. He can not predict the future but she more than makes up for it by saying she has a super power and she can. Caroline is not sure she is ready and Ridge says he is not pushing her. Caroline does not like these feelings of being out of control or feeling that she failed. She wanted to stay married. Ridge says he knows and he wanted to be a better person so there is plenty of failure to go around. They did not have an affair but it was more than that and they know it. She asks what does he see in her now. He says fear and the other Caroline had it too although they are not alike. He says Caroline is not reckless or sweet. He says he is not living in the past and knows exactly where he is going. Caroline says she wants him but she wants this to last and she needs time. He says he will not seduce her and he thinks it can be easy to filter out what others will say. Ridge holds her in his arms when she says an hour ago she would have thought this impossible but now it feels so right. Ivy calls Rick upstairs to see if they are going to come down for dinner. He is not hungry and Maya forgot to tell him their dinner was ready. Ivy says she will see him tomorrow. They decide to just have some wine and Maya offers to go down to basement to get a bottle and she will stop and get some cheese to go with it. He tells her he is sure Eric has a corkscrew around here somewhere. With Maya gone, he looks on Eric's side in the drawer but does not find and then he opens the other side and is taken aback when he finds a gun. He picks it up and holds it.",
