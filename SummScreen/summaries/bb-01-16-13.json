Taylor called Steffy, but Steffy insisted that Taylor remain quiet about the news and hung up on her. Taylor murmured about her first grandchild, and Taylor decided that she should tell Liam and Hope about the baby.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Hope congratulated Rick on his new title as president at Forrester. Rick worried that Hope was still mad at him. Hope promised that she would get beyond the damage that Rick had done. Rick left to meet with Eric. \n\n\nBrooke entered, and she and Hope discussed that Hope was still upset with Rick. Hope promised that she would get over it, but Rick, Bill, and Othello were all responsible for the lies that had kept Liam and Hope apart. Hope announced that she had told Liam everything, and they were working on getting back together.\n\n\nBrooke warned that Liam and Steffy had been living together. Hope confidently stated that they had details to work out, but she and Liam wanted each other. Brooke worried that Liam had hurt Hope before. Hope reminded Brooke that Liam had settled for Steffy because Hope had rejected him. \n\n\nBrooke warned that Liam and Steffy had made significant commitments to each other. Hope insisted that nothing would keep Liam and Hope apart. Brooke left, and Hope stared at her wedding photos with Liam.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Liam remembered his argument with Hope that had ended with them in each other's arms in a passionate clinch. Katie and Bill arrived and interrupted Liam's thoughts. Bill pretended that nothing had transpired and asked about Steffy. Liam said that she had gone to Europe to visit Ridge. Bill wondered why Liam hadn't gone with her. Liam explained that Steffy had wanted to go alone.\n\n\nBill thanked Liam for wearing the sword necklace, and Liam filled Katie in on Bill's dramatic stabbing display. Katie was shocked to hear about Bill's craziness then asked about Hope. Katie thought that Bill would welcome Hope back into Liam's life. Bill insisted that Liam had been living with Steffy and was committed to Steffy. Bill worried that Hope would be sniffing around Liam while Steffy was gone.\n\n\nAt Eric's house, Pam offered to make lunch, but Eric insisted that he didn't want to become a \"rotund old fogey.\" Rick arrived. Rick thanked Eric, and they embraced. Rick thanked Pam for looking after Eric. She returned to the kitchen. \n\nEric told Rick that Pam had been keeping him company. Eric admitted that he made two martinis and talked to Stephanie every night. Eric said that he missed Stephanie, but he added that Stephanie had spoken to him and said, \"No more tears. Get on with your life.\"\n\n\nAt home, Bill and Katie played with Will. Bill presented Katie with the stunning diamond necklace. She wondered why he had given her such an extraordinary gift.  Katie teasingly accused Bill of offering the gift to apologize for going to extremes -- like stabbing himself. Bill reminded Katie that he had never been a wallflower and had always been passionate about his beliefs and his love for Katie, Liam, and the baby. They kissed.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Taylor called Liam, but she suddenly thought better of calling him, and she hung up.  At Liam's, Liam's phone rang, and Taylor's name came up on his caller ID, but Liam heard nothing when he answered. Brooke suddenly appeared at Liam's back door. Brooke entered and wondered if Hope had any reason to believe that Hope and Liam had a future.\n\n\nLiam said that Hope had been very clear about her feelings for him. Brooke wondered if Liam could rip Steffy's heart out to start a future with Hope. Liam looked confused. Brooke warned that Liam shouldn't be rushing to the altar, and Liam vowed that he had some loyalty to Steffy. Brooke understood.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Liam that she had been in love with a man who had been in the same predicament at one time. Brooke ordered Liam to make a decision -- one that he could stick to for the rest of his life. She added that Hope believed that Hope and Liam were meant to be together for the rest of their lives, but Brooke wasn't sure that was true. Brooke encouraged Liam to think before he hurt anyone. Liam looked conflicted. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope congratulates Rick for being named President of FC. She thinks he will make a great one. He realizes she has not fully forgiven him. She says that he did a lot of damage in her life, but she will eventually get past it although she can't promise to forget. Brooke comes in and congratulates and hugs Rick too. He says Eric had a tough decision, but Brooke said he made the right one. Rick says he still has to prove himself and right now he needs to go see his father. Brooke asks Hope if she is still mad at Rick. She says she knows he did not mean to hurt her, but it might take a little time to get back on track. Brooke asks if she has seen Liam since Steffy left town. Hope says yeah they just spent some quality time together, just talking. Brooke says good as she should be careful. Hope gloats that no she is tired of being careful. She's done that all of her life and look where it has gotten her. She and Liam are now moving forward. Brooke points out that Liam is living with Steffy, but Hope says they just need to work out the details there. Liam is sitting and thinking about the recent conversation with Hope when they both told each other they loved each other. Bill and Katie walk in. He determines that Steffy is not there otherwise they would be in the bedroom together. Bill says it is good to see Liam still wearing the sword necklace. Liam says better on him than stuck in Bill. This is the first that Katie knows about it. Bill quickly says he is still a little sore, but is okay. He admits that he deserves some pain after all he did to Liam and Hope. Katie hopes this means that he now will accept his son and her niece together. Bill scoffs and says Liam is living with Steffy so Hope is no longer a consideration. Pam offers to make some lunch for Eric. He nixes it for now and says she is going to turn him into a rotund old fogey especially with the lemon bars that he can't pass up. Rick comes in and they congratulate him all over again. Eric tells him he did not choose him because he is his son; he really earned it. He confides in Rick that Pam hovers, but it keeps him from being lonely. He misses Stephanie every single day. He still makes two martinis every night and talks to Stephanie. She is always with him. Rick thanks Pam for being there for his father and looking after him with Stephanie gone. Liam tells Bill that Steffy is in Paris as her dad wanted to see her. Bill said he could have gone too, but Liam says she did not even ask and besides he had work to do. Bill is worried that now Hope will come sniffing around again. Liam says yes he knows, but that is not Bill's concern. He can schedule his own life. Hope tells her mother that she doesn't have to worry about her. They did not make love although they wanted to. It wasn't Liam that hurt her in the past, but lies by Rick and Othello and even Bill Spencer. But now they are back to where they were. And they will plan a life together. Brooke questions whether Liam is ready to break up with Steffy. Hope says she knows he will have to process everything, but this is their opportunity with Steffy gone. She gushes that she wants her life back and she's just glad she didn't make some life-altering commitments. With the way they feel about each other, nothing can keep them apart now. At home, Bill has Katie reach into his jacket and she finds the necklace. She is blown away with its beauty. He says not half as much as the lady who is going to wear it. She's not sure why he had to make this point by going to such extremes. He says sometimes extreme measures are called for. Yes he goes overboard at times, but then she knew she was not marrying a wallflower. She married him because he is passionate about her, about their life, about his family. Taylor agonizes but decides this is her first grandchild and Liam needs to know; even Hope. She calls Liam but then ends up hanging up before he answers. Brooke shows up and tells Liam that she owes him an apology for knowing about Deacon and his dad's involvement in getting him to Italy. But now it's out in the open and Hope is a different person because of it. Yet she knows it can't be easy on Liam since he is living with Steffy and truly cares for her. But he and Hope have another opportunity. He says it is not quite that simple. Brooke agrees. She knows it is going to be difficult as he is living with Steffy and he's a compassionate person and very considerate. She once knew a man like that. But he had to make a decision just as Liam will, and not just for now but for the rest of his life. Three lives are at stake here and Hope really thinks they are meant to be together. Brooke is not so sure now, but Liam has to decide.",
