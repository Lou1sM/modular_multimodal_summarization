    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the sky lounge, Othello found Carter doing a fierce workout and joked that if Carter had steam to blow off, then he should go to the club to meet some ladies Othello had for him.\n\n\nMaya breezed onto the rooftop, interrupting the conversation with boisterous glee. Carter bit out that he and Othello were in the middle of something, but Othello said they had time for a pretty lady. Maya was in an exceptional mood, and Othello guessed it was because she was the queen of the empire. Carter felt that the \"mistress\" of it would be more accurate.\n\n\nCarter wanted Maya to be careful about being with a married man, but Maya declared that Rick had shown her all night long, in the morning, and five minutes earlier that he loved her.\n\n\nCarter chuckled at the fact that he'd just questioned Rick's love, and suddenly -- that fast -- Rick had professed it. Carter wanted to know if Rick had said it naturally or because she'd confronted him. She claimed it made no difference; Rick loved her and had moved mountains to unite them.\n\n\nCarter asked if Maya was there to flaunt the affections of Rick Forrester. \"That and to let you know that you were wrong,\" Maya replied. Maya felt she'd proved that she could measure up to Caroline. Maya had been intimidated at first, but she never would be again.\n\n\nMaya started talking to Othello about d\u00e9cor changes at the office, and Carter told her that she wasn't the CEO. She touted that she was the woman behind the CEO, who supported the CEO. Carter replied that Rick had a whole company behind him for that. Maya asked if Carter meant Ridge.\n\n\nMaya questioned Ridge's loyalty to Rick and vowed not to let anyone disrespect Rick or her relationship with him. Othello said she'd spoken like the first lady of Forrester Creations. \"At least someone knows what's going on,\" Maya quipped, slapping Othello's hand.\n\n\nMaya left, and Carter wished Maya would dial it back a bit. To him, she acted as if Rick was a wounded bird in need of nursing. Othello recalled knowing Rick for years. Back then, Rick had seemed to have everything, but Stephanie's strong hold over the family had made it hard for Rick, who'd only reminded Stephanie of Brooke. Even as Eric's son, Rick had always felt like a bastard. Rick finally had someone who had his back, and Othello felt that Ridge had better be careful.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick looked at Maya's modeling pictures and grinned. Ivy asked if she should contact Wyatt about some designs and if Rick had heard from Hope. Rick said that the couple was strong and would pull through their troubles. Admiring the strength of married couples, Ivy said that married people took vows and held onto them when faced with the worst. Rick sighed.\n\n\nIvy asserted that she cared about Rick and Caroline. Ivy asked if he could honestly say he didn't love Caroline anymore. Rick didn't want to discuss it with Ivy, but she claimed to be concerned that he was deliberately hurting Caroline and lashing out at everyone else. He called it ridiculous. Ivy noted that the portrait had devastated Pam, and he'd threatened Ivy over the kisses prior to his power move.\n\n\nRick agreed that the threat had been extreme, but he'd needed allies. Ivy claimed that she hadn't told Caroline, which should have earned his trust. He responded that it had, so she told him to trust her when she said that if he was lashing out against the woman he still loved, he had to know there was only so much a woman could take.\n\n\nRick claimed not to be concerned about Ridge and Caroline but about running the business. Rick had only had one dream -- to make his mark at Forrester and make his father proud. Ivy doubted tricking her uncle had been a good start. Rick felt it would pay off and said he couldn't have Ridge undermining him. Ivy asked if Rick really thought the contract would stop Ridge from challenging Rick.\n\n\nRick explained that he'd neutralized his father's favoritism, and having complete control gave Rick the chance to prove himself. He said Ridge had tormented him since he was a child. \"First my mother and now my wife,\" he revealed. Rick appreciated Ivy's concern but said he had work to do.\n\n\nAcross the hall, Caroline was drawing and thinking about Ridge. Ridge touched her drawing hand and resisted the urge to kiss her. She relayed that she'd been up all night, thinking about whether they could let it happen and what her uncle would think. Ridge playfully teased her with kiss attempts. He said he didn't care what anyone thought, and he was letting her off her worrying hook. \"You don't have a choice. I'm not letting you go,\" he declared and finally kissed her.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline cuddled on the settee, and Ridge stroked her leg, which her skirt had left bare. Caroline wanted the feelings to be real and not something they were conjuring up to cover the pain of their past breakups. He said they wouldn't know, so they wouldn't rush or define it. They decided to take it slowly, because he didn't want it to end before it began.\n\n\nCaroline relayed that it was the first time in a long time that she didn't feel completely miserable, but she felt guilty that she wasn't crying over Rick, who didn't want her. Ridge called Rick an idiot. She asked how they would be together and work for Rick. Not wanting to talk about Rick anymore, Ridge moved in to kiss her. He received a text message from Rick, who wanted to see some designs.\n\n\nRidge left, and Caroline tried to bite back her bubbling smiles as Ivy arrived to get Caroline's input on some jewelry samples. Caroline said that she and Ridge were a team, so she couldn't make decisions without him. Ivy was surprised by Caroline's cheery mood.\n\n\nAs Caroline continued to twist and grin like a schoolgirl, Ivy said that Caroline's happiness was weird. She was eager to know what had changed. Caroline reasoned that she'd changed. While begging for her marriage, Caroline had lost sight of herself and what she had to offer. She added that someone had looked inside her and reminded her of how beautiful and strong she was.\n\n\n\"Someone meaning Ridge?\" Ivy asked. Caroline smiled, and Ivy asked what it meant. Grinning, Caroline quickly said that she and Ridge were taking it slowly, \"but yeah, Ridge and me.\" Caroline emphasized that it was new and delicate, and Ivy said her lips were sealed.\n\n\nThe women heard a knock at the door, and a young woman entered, looking for Maya. Guessing that Pam was at lunch, Ivy asked if the woman had an appointment. Nicole Avante doubted that she needed an appointment to visit her big sister.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Ridge stormed in and told Rick that it would be a \"cold day in hell\" when he started taking orders from Rick. Rick didn't think he was being unreasonable because Ridge's deadline had passed that morning. Ridge raged that Rick was supposed to lead, but he was disrespecting everyone. Rick had moved \"that woman\" into Ridge's father's house and had hung her picture up in place of the one of Ridge's mother.\n\n\nRick stated that \"her\" name was Maya, and he could do what he pleased where he lived. Ridge persisted in saying Rick was disrespecting Ridge's parents. Rick clarified that Eric wasn't Ridge's father, and Stephanie wasn't Rick's mother. Rick told Ridge that he could get the portrait out of the garage.\n\n\nMaya strode in during the argument. She told Ridge that if he couldn't leave his baggage at the door, he could find work somewhere else. Maya claimed to see right through Ridge, who hurt people. She claimed that Ridge had \"broken\" Rick's mother and destroyed Rick's marriage. She said that if Ridge couldn't respect Rick as a brother, he'd respect Rick as a boss or find some other place to work and another CEO's wife to help him draw.\n\n\nRidge charged out of the office and collided with Carter, who asked what was going on. Ridge snarled that Rick had deceived everyone, but if Rick thought Ridge would fall in line, he was mistaken.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Maya apologized for overstepping, but Rick said no one had ever done that for him before. Maya said he didn't have to hide his feelings, and no one had the right to speak to him like Ridge had. She claimed to be there for Rick completely. She said that Eric and Stephanie had laid the foundation, but the future was up to Rick. \"No, it's up to us,\" he said and kissed her. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Revitalized, Caroline starts sketching when Ridge comes in. He tries to kiss her several times but she pulls back, yet seems happy. They finally do kiss and he says he does not care what her Uncle Bill will say. She has no choice as he is not going to let her go. She says they need to take things slow. He agrees, he does not want it to end before it begins. Ivy asks Rick if he has heard from Wyatt as she needs to proceed on a few things. Then she asks about Hope and he says no to both fronts, but it won't be long. She starts in again about him and Caroline and wants to know if he no longer loves her. He tells her they have had this conversation before. She says there is only so much a woman can take. So if he is just hurting Caroline to get back at her, it may backfire. Rick says he is not distracted by Caroline now; just the business. He could not be at his best with Ridge challenging him at every turn. Having total control of the company for a year will prove he can succeed. He appreciates her concern but he has a lot of work he needs to get done. Carter is working out and Othello joins him but they don't get into much when Maya joins them and is happy to announce that Rick told her last night that he loved her. What they have is real. She is his lady. Carter laughs as this only came up when she told him, presto just like that. She says Rick moved mountains to be with her so what else do they want. Caroline tells Ridge that she feels sort of guilty but for the first time in a long time she does not feel miserable here at work. But how is this going to work with them working and yet reporting to Rick. He says he is here now so he does not want to talk about Rick. At that moment he gets a text from Rick wanting to see their designs. Maya admits to Carter that she was intimidated by Caroline with the hold she had on Rick but not know or ever again. Maya wants to make a few changes at work and Carter reminds her she is not the CEO. She says no, just the woman behind the CEO. Ivy notices that Caroline is smiling once again and wants to know what is up. All Caroline will do is smile and say they will wait for Ridge. Eventually Ivy gets it out of her that this new attitude is due to Ridge. He has told her she is beautiful and strong. They are more than just a team but are taking it slow, very slow. Ridge marches into Rick's office and says it will be a cold day in hell when he takes orders from Rick. Rick says they had a deadline and it was due this morning. Ridge says Rick is disrespecting his mother and his father. Rick says Eric is not his father and Stephanie is not Rick's mother. And he is living in the house now and can do what he wants. Maya comes in and throws in her two cents that Ridge is a problem and if he can't handle it he can find employment elsewhere. If he can not respect Rick's choices then at least respect him as the boss or go somewhere else. Ridge storms out and Maya goes to Rick to smooth his feathers. He says no one has ever come to his rescue like that but they have each other and will run this company. Ivy tells Caroline that her lips are sealed. They are interrupted by a young girl who wants to see Maya, her sister. Othello tells Carter that Rick has always felt like the family bastard because of how they all treated Ridge.",
