Ridge felt that it was only the two of them again; however, that was not reality. The reality was that while Taylor was away, he grieved for her, and then eventually found happiness again with Brooke. The birth of RJ solidified Ridge's happiness with Brooke.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Stephanie went to Hector's house and told him to stay away from Taylor or else. Hector told Stephanie that he did not know if he could stay away. Stephanie reminded Hector that Taylor loves her husband and wants to save her marriage. Hector viewed his involvement as help to Taylor who needed to find herself and be with someone who treated her better than Ridge did. Stephanie continued to threaten Hector about Taylor.\n\n\nOn Nick's boat, Nick asked Brooke to promise that she would not reunite with Ridge if he and Taylor divorced. Brooke stated that she would not reunite with Ridge because she could not and Nick knows why. Brooke said she had brief happiness with Nick and would never love another man. Brooke telephoned Ridge but got his voice mail. She left a message advising him not to leave Taylor.\n\n\nBack at the cabin, Ridge told Taylor that he could no longer be her husband. He told her that he is drawn to RJ who needs his father the same way Thomas needed him as a baby. Taylor was acutely aware that Ridge was also drawn to Brooke. Taylor begged Ridge not to leave her. Ridge said he could no longer stay with her. Ridge told Taylor he would always love her, and then apologized for leaving her. Taylor was distraught with despair. \n\n\n",
