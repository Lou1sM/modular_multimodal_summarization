He told her that her Sexy CEO photo shoot had gone well and was trending in social media. Thomas entered and asked about the campaign. He sneered that it had clearly been Wyatt's idea.\n\n\n\nWyatt ignored Thomas and said there was more good news at Forrester because his mother and Ridge had been a hit at the symposium in San Francisco. He encouraged Steffy and Thomas to meet in Quinn's office to hear the news.\n\n\n\nIn Quinn's office, she flashed back to her kiss with Ridge at the hotel in San Francisco. She took a call from Eric and told him she missed him. She couldn't wait to see him. She explained that she had taken the private jet home, and Ridge had returned on a commercial flight. Eric thought that was odd, but she said she thought Ridge had some other business to attend to.\n\n\n\nEric said he knew that Quinn and Ridge had to update Steffy about the symposium, but Eric wanted his own personal update as soon as possible. Quinn gushed that it had gone well, and she was curious how Eric had fared without her. \"I hated being without you,\" she said. Eric agreed and said it was funny that they had only been apart one night, but it had seemed longer. Ridge eavesdropped on Quinn's side of the conversation. Quinn hung up and promised to see Eric soon. Ridge entered and closed the door.\n\n\n\n\"Someone feeling guilty?\" Ridge asked. He wondered why. Quinn regretted that she had not left San Francisco sooner. Steffy, Wyatt, and Thomas barged in to hear about the success in San Francisco. They had all heard that Quinn and Ridge had praised one another's talents. Ridge and Quinn were quiet.\n\n\n\nWyatt joked that there was something juicy they were keeping from everyone. Ridge ordered Wyatt to take a breath and stop talking. Ridge said that he and Quinn had complimented each other and impressed everyone because they had simply acknowledged each other's accomplishments and talents. \"I still have issues with her,\" Ridge said. But he added that they would all learn to work together.\n\n\n\nRidge sent everyone out of the office, and he closed the door. Quinn said she knew what would happen next. \"You're going to leave the office and tell your father what happened, aren't you?\" she quizzed.\n\n\n\nQuinn worried that Ridge would tell his father that she had crossed the line -- something he had wanted her to do all along. She lamented that he would soon destroy her marriage, but she made an impassioned plea for how much she loved Eric.\n\n\n\nQuinn knew Ridge had his proof, and she could deny it, but it would mean lying to her husband. She refused to do that to the only man she had ever loved. She knew that Ridge would shatter her world. \"And I will be gone,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRidge agreed she had figured out his plan and caught him. \"And I admitted it,\" he said. But he added that something had happened in San Francisco. He had gotten to know her better. \"I allowed myself to know you better. I'm not gonna say anything to my dad,\" Ridge promised.\n\n\n\nQuinn wondered what else he had planned to trap her. Ridge's reaction to her had been one of her worst nightmares for a long time. Ridge answered that he wanted them to try to get along. Quinn agreed it was what Eric had wanted all along. Ridge demanded that she had to stop controlling people. Quinn agreed.\n\n\n\nRidge said that whatever the breakthrough in San Francisco had been, they had to build on it. Quinn reminded him that she loved her husband. She didn't know what had happened with the flirtations with Ridge, and she couldn't explain it. \"I am in love with Eric,\" she said. Ridge understood. \"Eric can never know. This will be our secret,\" she said. Ridge agreed.\n\n\n\nLiam sent a text message to Ridge to see what had happened in San Francisco. Ridge responded that things had not gone as planned. Liam was disappointed and flashed back to an argument he'd had with Steffy about how she believed that once the divorce was final, they would be together. Liam had argued that once the divorce was final wasn't soon enough because Quinn had been working overtime to break them up. He also flashed back to a time that he had encouraged Ridge to get rid of Quinn. Liam was distraught, and he left the house.\n\n\n\nAt Eric's house, Katie delivered mail that had been dropped at her house by mistake. They discussed that it was from Eric's brother. Eric encouraged her to stay and keep him company, but Katie said she was uncomfortable visiting Eric without Quinn's permission. Eric wondered if Quinn had really intimidated Katie, and she said that Quinn had. Katie and Eric laughed.\n\n\n\nKatie wondered how things had gone at the symposium. Eric said that Ridge and Quinn had been a hit. He believed that Quinn and Ridge would learn something about each other and learn to get along. He was happy that it had gone well because he had forced them to present at the symposium. \"I want this for Quinn and Ridge. They may find something between them that they didn't even know was there,\" Eric gushed.\n\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Liam barged in and said she had to listen to him. He said they had been tested more than any other couple, and he was tired of it. She wondered why he was so fired up. He said she had not been listening to him. \"You shouldn't have moved out, and it's not fair what your grandfather has done,\" he said. He said his father had given him a lecture on patience and reminded him that Spencers never gave up. \"And that includes Wyatt,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLiam insisted that Quinn had never paid for her crimes. She had tried to murder him, kidnapped him, taken advantage of him, and stolen months from them. \"We will never get that back,\" he said. Liam worried that Steffy was placating Wyatt. \"You're not doing me or Wyatt any favors,\" Liam said. Steffy shook her head.\n\n\n\nLiam lamented that Eric, Quinn, and Wyatt had gone too far trying to bribe her to move into the Forrester mansion. He wanted to stop worrying and begging her to move back in. He wanted their relationship back on track.\n\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Wyatt entered and told Eric that Quinn and Ridge had been an absolute hit at the symposium. Eric smiled and said he had missed her. He added that he loved Quinn like Wyatt loved Steffy. Wyatt thanked Eric for supporting him and his marriage.\n\n\n\nEric said that Wyatt should work on his marriage, but Wyatt disagreed. He said he had wanted to win Steffy over, but it was time to admit that what they had done was unfair. \"Three of us against my brother -- it's not right and not fair,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\n\nWyatt planned to move back to his beach house. Eric said Wyatt always had a home with Eric and Quinn. \"This is the Forrester house. I'm not a Forrester,\" Wyatt said. He thanked Eric because Eric had given his mother peace and happiness. They had created a beautiful, inspiring relationship, and he knew they would never let each other down. \"I know that my mom will never let you down,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Wyatt presents Steffy and Thomas with extremely positive feedback on the new \"Sexy CEO\"-campaign. Quinn and Ridge are back in Los Angeles, yet they feel vulnerable after the interaction they shared the night before. During a staff meeting, Steffy, Thomas and Wyatt are surprised that Ridge seems to have undergone a dramatic shift in his opinion towards Quinn. Once alone, Quinn confronts Ridge about whether he will tell Eric what happened between them in San Francisco. Ridge remarks that he knows her better now and will not say anything to his dad. Eric and Katie wonder whether Ridge and Quinn were able to mend their strained relationship on the trip. Wyatt goes to Eric to let him know that he is grateful for all the support he has received, but he has decided to move back to his Beach House. Elsewhere, Liam implores Steffy to finally have their relationship come first and officially cut all ties with Wyatt.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn reflects back on a few moments with Ridge, especially the kiss. Eric calls and wants to know if she made it home all right. She says yes, she took an earlier commercial flight while Ridge stayed to do more business. She will be home shortly. She hates being away from him if only one night. Ridge walks into her office and hears this. He asks why is she feeling so guilty. Wyatt walks into Steffy's office and says he has good news and better news, which should be first? He starts again that her sexy new shots of the CEO is off the charts. Thomas walks in and Wyatt says he is just giving the public what they want. It is taking a life of its own. Katie drops by Eric's with a piece of mail that was left at her place by mistake. Eric is happy to see it is from his brother, John. Eric convinces her to stay a while and keep him company. She is not sure that is a good thing considering how Quinn feels about her stopping by. He says he has seen that look in Quinn's eye but he hopes she is not too intimidating. Quinn tells Ridge do not start; she knew she should have gone home first. But before she can say more Thomas, Wyatt and Steffy join in. Ridge has not seen Thoams in a while and gives him a big hug. Wyatt wants to hear all the dirty details of how they survived a whole day and a half together. Thomas tells his dad that he makes it sound like it was no big deal \u0096 Quinn had a job and she did it. Quinn jumps in and says Ridge was very gracious to her and she will always be grateful for what he said. When they all want more details Ridge says why don't they all take a breath and let it go at that. He is not singing her praises but just acknowledging her value to the company and that should be okay with everybody. He says he still has issues with her but she needs to get home to his dad if this inquisition is over, so meeting adjourned. As soon as he closes the door Quinn says he does not have to say any more. As soon as he can he will be going to his dad and telling him exactly what happened in San Francisco. Liam catches Steffy back in her office alone and says good, they need to talk. He feels they have been tested more than any other couple he knows. He knows she hears his words but she does not always agree with him. She should never have moved out and that has to change. Her listening to her grandfather is not fair to them. She guesses that his dad fired him up. Liam says he also reminded him that Spencers never give up. Unfortunately that will also include Wyatt. He reminds her that Quinn is working overtime to pull all the strings, making sure that Wyatt and Steffy will be working alongside each other. This is a woman who has wrecked their lives. She physically tried to kill him and then she kidnapped him and took advantage of him. And that was not the worst part, that was that she stole months from them when they could have been together and now cannot get that back yet she has suffered zero consequences for that. She says over and over that she has changed but that is not true. And he accuses Steffy of placating Wyatt now and she is not doing Liam any favors. He does not want to be this guy that is constantly harping at her. Simple, their relationship has to come first before anything or anyone else. Wyatt stops by to see Eric and says his mother will be on her way soon but all things went well at the symposium. He wants to thank him for supporting his marriage. He does not want to pressure Steffy anymore. If they are meant to be together he should not have to work this hard to keep her. As long as he is living here it is putting Steffy right back in the middle of things. He intends to just quietly move back to his beach house. Eric tells him he will always have a home here. He wants to thank Eric for giving his mother peace and happiness. He knows they will never let each other down. Quinn tells Ridge to go home and tell his father anything he wants. She is not going to lie to him. Ridge says no, he knows her better now and he is not going to say anything to his dad. She cannot help but believe this is a trap. He says no, they should just try harder to get along. She says whatever happened between them she cannot explain but she loves her husband and this has to be their secret.",
