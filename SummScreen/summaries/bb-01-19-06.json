    "soap_central": "\n\nBrooke and Taylor have a face to face with each other about their relationships with Ridge.  Taylor tells Brooke to leave and run to her \"destiny\" like she liked to claim Ridge was.  Taylor tells Brooke that all she has ever done is sleep not with just one man, but a gene pool, and when she is through, she starts all over again.  Taylor keeps on lashing out at her and finally says that if she came to see her cry then she hopes the trip was worth it.\n\n\nBrooke has had enough and starts back on Taylor telling her that she used to look up to her.  She accuses her of having a lofty world of principals, that she used to have everyone measure up to, and when they didn't, she showed them a complete lack of respect.    Brooke tells her that she will end up alone, just like Stephanie.  She tells Taylor that she was more competition when she was in the grave than she was when she came back.  Taylor takes off her wedding ring, and holds it out to Brooke, telling her to \"score one for the whores of the world and God help the rest of us.\"\n\n\nNick comes home to Bridget and she asks him if he thinks that her Mother and Ridge should get back together with each other.  They share a lot of history and have a family also.  He says no, trying not to say too much.  He tells her that he didn't think Ridge treated Brooke very well and he doesn't want her to go through that again.  Bridget, on the other hand thinks it would work this time, because her Mother can stand on her own now, and wouldn't be a doormat for anyone.  Nick tells her that he thinks that Ridge has the ego of a whale and the attention span of a goldfish when it comes to women.  \n\n\nRidge visits with Stephanie.  He tells her that his marriage to Taylor is over.  He asks her when it meant more that her happiness became necessary over that of her son's.  Ridge tells his Mother that he intends to ask Brooke to marry him and he thinks that she will say \"yes.\"  When she does, Ridge expects Stephanie to treat Brooke with respect and to accept her -- and if she doesn't, she can just stay out of the rest of his life.  \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke pushes Taylor not to give up on her marriage with Ridge, but Taylor tells her that she and Ridge are finished. The two women trade insults before Taylor tells Brooke to go for Ridge. Ridge blasts Stephanie and blames her for all of his troubles, and then tells her that he is still in love with Brooke and intends to ask her to marry him. Bridget encourages Nick not to stand in Brooke's way if Ridge and Brooke decide to be together.\r\n",
    "yt": "\n\nBrooke tries to convince Taylor that her and Ridge can work things out, but Taylor tells her that it\u2019s over.  Taylor continues to insult Brooke until she finally snaps back and calls Taylor a hypocrite.  Taylor then tells Brooke to go ahead and give Ridge everything hat she never could.  Ridge tells Stephanie that his marriage with Taylor is over.  He then accuses her of not caring about his real happiness and admits that he is still in love with Brooke.  Ridge tells Stephanie that he intends to ask Brooke to marry him.  Nick tells Bridget about her mother\u2019s visit.  Bridget asks Nick not to make things difficult if Brooke decides to get back together with Ridge, but he seems uneasy with the thought.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke can't fathom why Taylor is so mad at her. Taylor is insulted that Brooke is trying to be the rescuer now and pretending to be her friend and not the vulture she really is. Nick slips into the beach house, unwittingly waking up Bridget and tells her it is probably over between Taylor and Ridge. Ridge lets himself in Stephanie's house and he tells her he broke Taylor and all the kid's hearts tonight and now he is there to break hers as well. Taylor refuses to believe Brooke doesn't want her husband. She's made a life out of wanting him; it was what she did for a living! She mocks her that her DESTINY is knocking, go let him in. Bridget is sympathetic but doesn't understand why Nick is so adamant that Brooke not get back with Ridge, if that is the way it plays out. Stephanie tries to convince Ridge he needs to work this out with Taylor. She's aghast when he tells her it's too late; he's still in love with Brooke. They have been waiting decades for their moment and it's NOW. Brooke IS going to be his wife and as such his mother will give her the due respect and consideration. Or if hating Brooke is more important, then tell him now and if he has to choose between the two of them, she won't like the result. Taylor and Brooke have it out. Taylor is full of venom and Brooke counters with she used to think Taylor was nice, but she never realized that she and Stephanie are the exactly alike. They are both going to end up old, bitter and alone. Taylor chastises her to go to Ridge, give him all her warmth and comfort. She even slaps her wedding ring into Brooke's palm. She'll make it real easy for her. She claps - all the years of flirting, begging, wiggling and jiggling will finally pay off. Take Ridge and score one for the WHORES of the world, and God help the rest of them.",
