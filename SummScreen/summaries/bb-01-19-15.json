    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Rick called Caroline into the CEO's office to tell her that he expected daily progress reports from her, and if he wasn't available, she'd report to Maya. Caroline noted that the busy Maya had called in reinforcements. Rick became curious, and Caroline remarked that Nicole, Maya's sister, had been there. Caroline was surprised that Rick didn't know about Nicole's appearance earlier.\n\n\nThe last Rick had heard, Maya's family was scattered throughout the Midwest. Caroline quipped that Maya would round them up and move them into the mansion. Rick was sure that it was just a visit. \"And when you become newly successful, relatives just appear!\" Caroline stated.\n\n\nRick dismissed Caroline, but as she left, he asked what the sister had been like. She described the young girl as forward, young, and pretty. Caroline asked if he was done with her, and he noticed that she seemed different. \"Maybe you never knew me very well,\" she responded then left.\n\n\nLater, \"Stephanie\" arrived, carried by the determined Pam. Pam refused to let Rick stuff Stephanie away in the garage, exposed to the elements, and decided that she'd keep Stephanie at her desk. Rick asserted that Pam would not do it and added that there was no element exposure in the garage. The cynical Rick said he'd have shipping pack Stephanie up and treat her like the Mona Lisa.\n\n\nPam left with the portrait and returned to take dictation. Rick wanted to help Maya locate her relatives, starting with a sister named Nicole. \"No,\" Pam pointedly said. Pam refused to do a deep background check on his girlfriend. \"You don't trust her? I wonder why,\" Pam quipped.\n\n\nRick claimed to trust Maya, but Pam doubted that he trusted himself. She said he'd known he was wrong for moving Maya into Stephanie and Eric's house and bed, but he'd also known Maya would push him to do it. Pam offered to feel sorry for Rick, but he'd been doing enough of that for everyone.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill called a meeting with Alison, Justin, Katie, Jarrett, and Liam to discuss some changes he'd decided to make at the company upon his return from San Diego. Ivy rushed in, and Bill explained that he'd called Ivy there to witness Bill promoting Liam as president of Spencer Publications.\n\n\nEveryone congratulated Liam, and Katie, who was late for a nail appointment, asked what the next announcement was. Bill said he'd created a vacuum by promoting Liam and needed someone to fill the vice presidency. \"So, Katie, what do you say? If you can stand me, I need you back,\" Bill stated.\n\n\nEveryone applauded and left Katie and Bill alone. Bill asked her what her answer was. Katie agreed to return, but she wanted seventy-five percent of her former salary, and she didn't want to deal with Alison -- ever. Katie also wanted the daycare back and flex-hours, so she could work from home.\n\n\nBill called it a nice home, and Katie said it was too bad he'd had to move out. He said he'd been kicked out but would settle for sleeping in his old bed. She counter-offered to make him dinner instead.\n\n\nJustin returned with a contract for Katie, but Katie said she'd be crazy to sign anything from Justin without reading every word first. She took the papers and exited with Justin.\n\n\nThrough another door arrived Caroline in a huff. \"It's Forrester, isn't it?\" Bill guessed. She filled him in on what had happened in his absence, and Bill was livid about Rick shacking up with the ex-con all along. She said she'd wanted to talk to Bill and make sure that he didn't blame things on Ridge.\n\n\nBill called Ridge a player with hairy hands. Bill didn't want Ridge touching Bill's niece, who Bill asserted needed to be back with her husband. Caroline claimed she'd wanted it, but Rick had kept shutting it down. \"Did he now?\" Bill pointedly asked.\n\n\nLater, Katie entered with her contract and halted upon seeing Caroline in the office alone. Caroline could barely look at Katie as Caroline relayed that Bill would be right back. Katie noted that it was the first time they'd seen each other since \"it\" had happened. Caroline murmured that she'd ruined everything, but Katie stated that nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n\nKatie said Caroline hadn't taken Ridge away from Katie. Katie explained that she'd let him go because she couldn't understand him. She'd lost herself in Ridge. It had felt good to be lost, but Ridge's art would always be his first love, which made his wants and needs all-consuming. Katie had wanted to be what he'd needed her to be, but she'd realized that she needed to be more than that. Katie had forgotten who she was, and she warned Caroline to never forget herself.\n\n\nCaroline thanked Katie, and Katie asked where Bill had gone. Caroline conveyed that she'd filled Bill in on Rick and Maya. Katie jokingly guessed Bill was in raging bull mode.  Caroline noticed that Katie felt much more at ease with Bill than when the two had been married. Katie said she was more comfortable with herself, and being so was allowing her to reevaluate things.\n\n\nIn Liam's office, Ivy congratulated Liam on his new position, but Liam was sure that his promotion contained an ulterior motive to get Katie back at the business. \"For two people who are divorced, they act very...\" Ivy said, thinking of a word. \"Married,\" Liam offered knowingly.\n\n\nLiam figured that Ivy thought he was too young for his job and had only gotten it because of his father; however, he felt that he'd worked like a dog to get there, and the new position required him to keep doing that. Ivy said good things happened to good people. She believed that he was a good person, but good things didn't happen to him often enough.\n\n\nLiam held Ivy from behind, and Ivy decided to get back to work. Liam said that they'd agreed to take things slowly, but she had no idea where he wanted to put his hands at that moment. Ivy told him that she'd win in the wandering-hands game, and they kissed.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Maya answered the door for Nicole and blankly asked what she needed. Nicole was surprised that Maya didn't recognize her.  Gasping, Maya hugged Nicole and announced that her little sister was all grown up. Nicole quipped that puberty would do that to a person.\n\n\nNicole had transferred from her college in Evanston and was attending UCLA. Maya asked why Nicole hadn't contacted her. Due to Maya's years of silence, Nicole hadn't been sure Maya wanted it.\n\n\nNicole made a quip about the portrait on the wall. Maya said it had been Rick's idea, and Nicole remarked that Rick was married. Maya explained that he was getting a divorce, but Nicole said someone had forgotten to tell the Internet that part.\n\n\nMaya was headed to work but decided that it could wait because her sister was there. Hugging Nicole, Maya said that she didn't know what people had told Nicole or what Nicole would think of Maya, and that was why the birthday and Christmas cards Maya had sent hadn't said much. Maya guessed that she didn't exist back home, but Nicole revealed that she'd quietly tracked Maya.\n\n\nNicole asked if Maya remembered receiving a hundred dollars in prison commissary money.  Maya had thought it had been an error and had kept quiet about it. Nicole explained that she'd hacked the system so that Maya could have money for lotions and hair products.\n\n\nThe topic turned to school, and Nicole conveyed that she was a computer science major. Maya grilled her about where she'd go with that, and Nicole asked if Maya was really giving her the \"Mom and Dad talk.\" Maya glared expectantly, and Nicole stated that she really wanted to design -- just not clothes.\n\n\nMaya asked what future there was in it, and Nicole asked what future there was in modeling. Nicole noted that Maya was already getting facial lines, and Maya looked offended. Nicole decided to leave for class, but before going, she said she'd been angry at Maya for taking off to do her own thing because Nicole had been too young to do it, too. Maya hugged Nicole.\n\n\nLater, Maya answered the door for Bill and dismally said he was a lovely surprise. She asked if he had a message to leave because she was the only one home. Bill retorted that his message to her was that she was nothing but a resident squatter.\n\n\nBill asked if Maya was fulfilling a trailer park fantasy. Maya asserted that Rick was in love with her, and Bill asked if she was kidding. \"Rick is in love with misery. He's in love with tormenting himself,\" Bill explained. He said it was just how some people got off, but Rick was married to Caroline and in agony over not fulfilling his vows.\n\n\nMaya offered to let the police remove Bill. \"How long do you think it's going to be before you're removed?\" Bill asked. He reminded her that he knew all about her past and could make it stick to her in a New York minute. He gave her twenty-four hours to say her goodbyes, because at that time the following day, she'd be gone. \n\n\n",
