He took her to Eric's house, and as he got her some water, she said he probably had better things to do. Ridge replied that he didn't, and he asked what had driven her into his arms earlier.\n\n\nKatie explained the dilemma she had about taking Bill back, and she wondered if she should do it for Will's sake, as Brooke had urged her to do. Ridge said that reuniting their families might be the ultimate solution for each of their situations, but he and Katie should really think before acting.\n\n\nKatie discussed Brooke's ease of moving from one relationship to another and said that Brooke didn't worry because she always had someone waiting in the wings. To Katie, it seemed logical to Brooke that Katie would go back to Bill because Brooke followed her heart without thinking about the past or future. Katie said Brooke lived in the present, and it might be nice if everyone could do that.\n\n\nRidge began quoting Sonnet 29 by Shakespeare. Recognizing the piece, Katie recited the verse that followed. Ridge continued with the quote, and Katie became thoughtful as he recited his final lines, \"For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings that then I scorn to change my state with Kings.\"\n\n\nThe impressed Katie asked if poetry was Ridge's new hobby. Ridge stammered bashfully, and she said she'd been a life-long poetry fan. He replied that he still had a lot to learn about poetry, relationships, love, and life. Katie thanked him for making time for her. She said she had a tendency to get worked up, but he'd reminded her that being with a friend made all the difference. Ridge smiled and touched her knee.\n\n\nIn Rick's office at Forrester, Quinn warned Wyatt about getting a free place to live from Bill. Wyatt noted that she hadn't minded him living rent-free above the warehouse. \"Okay, fine. When do we move in?\" Quinn asked. Wyatt stammered, and she claimed that she was joking. He stated that he'd love to live with his mother, but privacy was a good thing to have for him and his girlfriend.\n\n\nQuinn's eyes lit up at his use of the term. Wyatt bashfully claimed he was trying it out. She complimented him on the necklace he'd give Hope, and he replied that he had more surprises in store. He suspected that one would be arriving soon, and his \"girlfriend\" would like it more than the necklace.\n\n\nQuinn became offended that Wyatt hadn't asked her to craft the surprise, but Wyatt said that it wasn't jewelry. He'd promised to go to his mother for ring advice, and Quinn remembered that she needed to talk to him about the attempted heist. Before she could say more, Pam entered to let Wyatt know that there was a delivery for him, and Wyatt asked his mother to check it out with him.\n\n\nOutside, Quinn stared at the surprise and wondered if it was Hope's kind of thing. Wyatt reasoned that it was adventurous and filled with quality time with him, so Hope couldn't resist.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Liam arrived to see Hope. He said he'd missed their relationship, and Hope replied that she felt the same. He wondered if Steffy was still holding Hope back, and Hope admitted that it was partly so. He remarked that he hadn't talked to Steffy and didn't have plans to in the future. Hope quipped that she hadn't expected to see Steffy on the wedding day, but it had happened.\n\n\nLiam recalled that Steffy's arrival had been Quinn's doing, and if it hadn't been for Quinn, he and Hope would be married. Hope didn't deny that Quinn could go to extremes, but Hope asked if Quinn was any worse than Bill. Liam figured Bill was motivated by his ego, but with Quinn, Liam could hear the Psycho music playing in the background.\n\n\nHope was dismissive of Liam's concerns, but Liam insisted that he was just trying to keep her safe. Hope agreed that Quinn had made some bad decisions, but she said she'd called Quinn out on them. Hope felt that Quinn's antics wouldn't do if Hope and Wyatt continued together.\n\n\nLiam asked if Hope planned on marrying Wyatt or if Liam was wasting his time trying to put the relationship back together. Hope claimed she didn't know the future. \"This is too much!\" she exclaimed. Liam replied that it was really very simple. He stated that Quinn had gotten Steffy there on the wedding day, but Liam had sent Steffy away. He hadn't spoken to Steffy since then, but Quinn was manipulating the situation to make Steffy look like a problem.\n\n\nHope cited that Quinn hadn't made the video. Liam owned up to making the video, but he said he hadn't given it a second thought until Quinn had dredged it up again. He asked if Hope actually thought he'd been pining for Steffy while planning a wedding with Hope and if Hope thought he had anything to do with Steffy showing up at the wedding.\n\n\nHope spoke over Liam, saying that it didn't change how she felt. Liam was saying that Quinn set up the manipulations, and Hope fell for them every time. He said that with one look at Steffy, Hope had run off to Hawaii, and it hadn't been right. Liam declared that the Fullers shouldn't be in their lives, and he vowed not to stop until he'd convinced Hope of it.\n\n\nIn the Forrester corridor, Charlie made his rounds for his new job. Pam was surprised to see him, and he told her that Eric had hired him to patrol at Forrester to keep all the new gems floating around there safe. She lauded Charlie for his work, but his face darkened.\n\n\nLater, Charlie made his rounds again, and before approaching Pam's desk, he glanced at the boutique video, which was on his phone. He became gloomy again, and Pam guessed he was upset because she'd told him about her past.\n\n\nAs Pam and Charlie spoke, Quinn stopped in a discreet spot in the corridor to observe them. Charlie told Pam that everyone had a past, but he was concerned about the present. Pam said she remembered what it had been like to be on the wrong side of the law, and it was better on his side. She liked a man in uniform, too, so she didn't want to mess things up between them.\n\n\nLiam exited the CEO's office, and he thanked Charlie for helping him out before. Liam asked if Charlie was sure there had been nothing on the footage. Noticing Quinn standing behind a plant, Charlie replied that he was sorry, but there had been nothing.\n\n\nBack outside, Wyatt showed Hope the surprise he had for her. It was an aluminum camper. As he tried to sell her on taking a camping adventure with him, she guessed that his mother had never wanted to go with him as a child. Wyatt claimed that camping was about getting away from everything -- including work, family, and mothers. He said he wanted to christen the vehicle on a surfing safari, and he urged her to get away with him for a few days or a week.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge catches Katie as she flees from Brooke's house. He tells her that she is in no condition to drive so come with him. Hope dumps a lot of paperwork on Pam who is disgruntled because Donna didn't show up; she had a broken shoe strap so they won't see her until after lunch. Wyatt tells his mother about his new place. She thinks it sounds great, but she does not want him indebted to Bill. Everything comes with a price. He says he is not leaving the country; it's just Malibu. She says fine, when do they move in? She had him for moment. He says normally he would not mind her moving in, but right now he needs his privacy with a girlfriend. She's ecstatic that this is what they are calling it now. She's only a little offended when he mentions he has another gift for Hope besides the necklace he gave her. Since she designs jewelry, she would have thought he would have come to her. He says no, it is not that kind of gift. And certainly if he ever needs that sort of ring he will come to her. She is about to tell him something about the Hope diamond when Pam interrupts and says Wyatt has a delivery out front. He asks his mom to come with him. He might need anther woman's opinion. Ridge brings Katie back to Eric's. She says she is sure that he has more things to do than talk to her. He say no, not really. He wants to know what drove her into his manly arms. She tells him about her visit to see Brooke. And Brooke wants her to just go back to Bill but Katie doesn't think she can do like Brooke does which is just follow her heart. She is not concerned with the past nor the future just lives in the present. Ridge quotes a sonnet from Shakespeare that makes Katie smile and she recites the finish of the verse. They have that in common that she did not know. Charlie shows up at Forrester and surprises Pam. He tells her that he has been assigned the Forrester company now and old Hawkeye will be guarding the emeralds. He looks a little down when she says he is like royalty around here as he saved the diamond. Liam stops by and he tells Hope that he is not there for a fashion piece. He does slip in that he misses the two of them together and she agrees so does she. He asks if it is Steffy that is still keeping them apart and she says partly. Liam counters that he has not been in contact with her since their aborted wedding day. And the only reason she was there then was because of Quinn. The only reason they are not married right now is because she got involved. Hope acknowledges that Quinn has done some far out things and she has called her on it and said she did not like it. But she has not done any worse than his own father has in keeping them apart. Liam says if she will listen she can almost hear Psycho music playing in the background. Hope says no, she is not that bad. Liam says all he is trying to do is make sure she is safe and in good hands. Then he goes into a tirade of all that Quinn has done to push Steffy between them. He chastises Hope for always falling for what Quinn does. Neither her or her son should be in Hope's life or in her company and he will not stop until they are gone. Liam leaves and runs into Charlie talking to Pam. Liam thanks him for trying to help with the boutique footage. He asks again if Charlie is sure there is nothing on those tapes. Charlie spies Quinn listening behind a potted plant and tells Liam no nothing revealing. Wyatt escorts Hope outside to see his surprise. It's an Airstream motor home, like a big old Silver Bullet. He points out that it is completely air conditioned and heated, has full bathroom, beds with pillowtop mattresses, furnished kitchen .no sleeping on the ground here. She says she feels like she is getting to know what he must have been like as a little boy on Christmas morning. He tells her he always wanted one, so now he finds himself with a little extra cash. And the most important part is that he has someone to share it with. She jokes that guess his mother didn't want to go along. He said no, it wasn't that but camping is about getting away from everything \u0096 work and family and mothers. It's about freedom, going to beautiful places like beaches, the woods, or the desert. He's ready to christen this bad boy. He's enthusiastic and begs her to please come just for a few days or a week just the two of them. He says she needs to live the dream. He kisses her.",
