    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester Creations, Wyatt told Hope that he wanted Hope to get away from everyone -- alone with him. He pointed to the silver retro RV -- a basic trailer -- he had purchased below them in the parking lot. He promised they could unplug from everything and have a surfing vacation at stops along the Pacific coast. Wyatt promised that Hope wouldn't miss anything at Forrester. Hope looked thoughtful.  \"Let's do it,\" Hope said. Wyatt and Hope laughed and looked down at the silver bullet -- an aluminum RV.\n\n\nLiam showed up on the rooftop, and he overheard Wyatt and Hope's laughter. Wyatt dished that he and Hope had planned to head up the coast. Liam asked to talk to Hope privately. Hope agreed, but she had to leave because she received a text message from shipping. \n\n\nHope left, and Wyatt warned Liam not to interfere in his time away with Hope.  Wyatt said that Liam was boring. Wyatt rubbed it in that he and Hope were going away as a couple. Liam looked angry.\n\n\nInside Forrester, Charlie tried to stay away from Quinn on his security rounds. He stepped into the freight elevator, and Quinn followed him. Quinn stopped the elevator and threatened that Charlie needed to remain silent about the security video. Quinn warned Charlie not to talk to Liam. Charlie worried that Hope would be shocked if she knew that Wyatt had stolen the necklace.\n\n\nQuinn reminded Charlie that he had been a hero because of Wyatt. Charlie admitted that he had enjoyed the notoriety, and he loved that Pam had been turned on by the heroism, but he added that it was unfair to Hope. Quinn warned that if Charlie told the truth, Quinn's business would suffer, and Wyatt's reputation would be ruined. Quinn advised Charlie to forget what he had seen.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Rick and Caroline joked that they were the perfect couple. They kissed and hugged. Rick said that he hoped Hope could find the right guy. Rick felt that Wyatt might be a better match for Hope than Liam. Caroline argued that Liam was not at fault in most of Hope and Liam's twisted romance.\n\n\nRick and Caroline agreed that Quinn had been trouble for Hope and Liam, but Caroline noted that Wyatt and Liam were both her cousins. She had to remain neutral. Hope interrupted. Hope shared that she had an offer to take a trip with Wyatt, and she suddenly realized she had left Wyatt and Liam alone on the rooftop. Caroline promised to check on them, and she left.\n\n\nHope told Rick about the surfing trip that Wyatt had planned. Hope admitted she was not sure she was ready to take her relationship with Wyatt to the next level. Rick asked if Liam had heard about the trip. Hope said Liam had overheard Hope and Wyatt planning the trip. Hope said Liam obviously didn't want her to go with Wyatt. Rick believed that Wyatt was good for Hope, but he understood Liam's stance, as well. Hope said she wanted to go on the trip. She left.\n\n\nOutside on the rooftop, Caroline teased Wyatt about buying a used trailer. He called it vintage. Caroline said that Wyatt was living the glamorous life of a hero with a surfing safari. She teased that he had saved the day, gotten the girl, and was traveling in style -- the glamorous life of a hero. Wyatt looked thoughtful at the mention of being a hero.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Liam entered, and Liam confessed that he didn't trust Wyatt or Quinn. Liam called Hope on the phone to dissuade her from taking a trip with Wyatt. Hope agreed to meet Liam at his place after she ran an errand. Rick knew that Liam wanted Hope to stay away from Wyatt. Liam said that he loved Hope, and refused to give up on her. Liam wanted to prevent Hope from doing something she'd regret. Quinn had been eavesdropping at the door and heard Liam set up the meeting with Hope.\n\n\nQuinn put an \"out of order\" sign on the elevator, and it forced Liam to choose the freight elevator instead of the traditional elevator. He was in a hurry to meet Hope at his house before she left on the trip with Wyatt.  After Quinn watched Liam get into the freight elevator, she managed to open the fuse panel and hit the breaker, which left Liam stuck in the elevator in the dark. Liam was furious, and he screamed for help.\n\n\nQuinn was proud of herself. She called Wyatt and told him to hurry and get Hope out of town because Liam had planned to meet Hope. Wyatt warned his mother not to interfere, but Quinn was adamant that Wyatt had to hurry and get out of town with Hope. \n\n\nWyatt said that mechanics had not hooked the RV up to his truck yet. Quinn advised him to hurry.  Wyatt worried that Quinn had done something. Quinn hung up and smiled at her success.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt tells Hope to imagine the fun they are gonna have in that baby. She says yeah it is one fine looking trailer. And he says no internet, no TV, just adventure. There's even a break in their work right now so they can get away from Liam and Quinn. And he promises her she won't miss anything important. He promises she won't regret one minute of this trip so she finally says yes that she is in. He grabs her and gives her a big hug just as Liam comes out and sees them. Hope spots Liam and says hi. He walks up and asks what is going on. Wyatt points below and says that is his new baby. Hope adds that it is not just any trailer, it's a vintage aluminum masterpiece. Wyatt says he and Hope are going on a trip down the coast. Liam asks if he can speak to Wyatt. Hope says sure. She needs to get back inside anyway. Wyatt tells Liam that this is a big step forward in their relationship and he trusts that Liam won't try to get in the way. Hope has already said yes to this. He's taking her someplace special and Liam would be green with envy. Liam wants to know what it is with him \u0096 first Medico then Hawaii and now he's whisking her out of town again. Wyatt says Hope likes adventure. Liam says it is more like he is just trying to get her out of town away from Liam. Wyatt says Liam is a snoozefest so he can stay home laying on a bed of rosemary or whatever he does. What he is trying to say is that sometimes you have to spice up the gumbo. You have to go that extra mile and show a woman that she is wanted and appreciated. Liam scoffs and a trailer is just the trick. Bet it's pretty tight in there. Wyatt says yes with candles, pillows, tight sleeping quarters, only room for two. He hopes Liam isn't going to invite himself along. He just wants to spend some alone time with Hope. Whatever happens happens. Caroline tells Rick that she is going to go check on her cousins to make sure they both have all their teeth. Rick questions Hope how things are going between her and Wyatt and Liam. She tells him that Wyatt just bought one of those Silver Bullet's and they are going on a little trip. It will be fun but she is not quite sure that she is ready to go alone with him on a camping trip. She likes Wyatt a lot, they have fun together and she trusts him but she's just not sure she is ready to go away and take their relationship to the next level. Rick says Wyatt is a good guy but she should not go unless she really cares about him. He's kind and attentive. It's always about her and there is no other woman. There is no Steffy. Rick says he knows, and a relationship shouldn't be that hard. She said Liam just found out and he definitely looks like he doesn't want her to go. She says she was super excited but now she is not sure she should go. Rick says he wasn't so sure about Wyatt in the beginning but the way he has supported Hope during the HFTF he thinks that he is good for her. Charlie is in the freight elevator just as Quinn walks up, gets in and closes the door. Stammering he says he's just making his rounds to check on the emeralds. She says enough chit chat. She hits the stop button. She says she has seen him talking to Liam again. And he has a terrible poker face and needs to be more committed to keeping their secret. He says he does not like lying. She says he better get comfortable with it because he agreed he would keep her secret and she expects him to keep it. He says Hope is a sweet girl and she has taken quite a shine to Quinn's son but would not if she knew what he'd pulled. She reminds him again that she wants his silence on this. He says it doesn't feel right. And everyone is calling Wyatt a hero. Quinn reminds him that they are giving him hero status too. He admits that is fun and Pam likes to tell the story and seeing him in uniform. Quinn says no one has to know the details. She begs him to keep the secret. If it gets out, Wyatt will be in trouble and she will lose her business. So think of all the people it will affect. She pushes the button again and the elevator starts going. She tells him she knows she can count on him to keep it to himself. Caroline talks to Wyatt. She's impressed. He caught a couple of jewel thieves and then went out and bought this trailer .not a sports car or a yacht. He says he likes his truck just fine and this is not just any old used trailer but vintage. He knows she and Rick will want to use it sometime. Liam ducks back into the building and finds Rick and asks if Hope is still there. Rick says he just missed her. She is delivering something to Santa Monica. He gathers Liam is not too happy about the trailer. He said he would be except that it's with Wyatt. His mother clearly has a screw loose and they don't even know what Wyatt is capable of. He texts Hope and asks if she can meet him at his place before she meets Wyatt. Quinn hears this and that Hope agreed. Quinn puts up an Out of Order sign on the elevator. Liam tells Rick that he loves his sister and he just wants to make sure she doesn't do something she will regret. He is not giving up on the two of them. He spies the out of order sign and takes the freight elevator. Quinn follows and sees him get in and she runs to the fuse box and pulls the lever stopping the elevator between floors. Liam starts beating on the walls, calling out to anyone who can hear him; tells them his name and that he is trapped. Quinn calls Wyatt and tells him that Hope is on her way to Liam's and he needs to rush over and pick her up and get out of town now. Wyatt tells her to cool down, all is fine. Hope has already agreed to go. He is just waiting for them to hook up the trailer to his truck. She says okay hurry. He asks if she has done anything to make her so nervous. She says he just needs to get out of town. He tells her all is fine, so don\u0091t worry. He and Hope are gonna have the best trip of their lives.",
