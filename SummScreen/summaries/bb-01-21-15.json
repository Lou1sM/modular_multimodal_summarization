Rick maintained that Liam didn't want to take Rick on.\n\n\nLiam disagreed. Liam warned that no on should treat employees the way that Rick had, and Liam reminded Rick that Caroline was his cousin and Ivy was his girlfriend. \"You disrespect them, and you'll have to go though me,\" Liam commanded.\n\n\nLiam advised Rick to stop yelling at people as a normal order of business. Rick shouted that what he did was none of Liam's business. Liam shouted right back at him. \"These are my people,\" Liam said. Liam chastised Rick for berating Caroline and Ivy. Rick droned on about how Caroline had disrespected him with Ridge.\n\n\nLiam laid into Rick and called him a hypocrite. \"How's your new roommate?\" Rick asked. He reminded Rick that he had been sleeping with Maya for weeks, and Caroline had only kissed Ridge.\n\n\nRick refused to give in, but Liam warned that firing Caroline and Ivy was ridiculous. Rick called Caroline a \"faithless liar.\" Rick whined that he hadn't created the situation at Forrester. Caroline had, and she had to deal with the fallout.\n\n\nLiam told Rick to stop expecting sympathy because he'd been hurt. Rick also demanded that Rick stop bullying people and look for a better solution. \"I'm CEO,\" Rick shouted, but Liam told him to stop his grandstanding and acting like a child.\n\n\nLiam shouted that Rick needed to stop trying to break Caroline's spirit and rubbing his relationship with Maya in Caroline's face. \"Would your father be proud of you right now?\" Liam chided. Rick looked away and told Liam to never touch him again.\n\n\nRick put Ivy and Caroline \"on notice.\" Liam reminded Rick that he needed to stop his power trip and remember who he was talking to because Liam wouldn't allow Rick to mistreat his cousin and his girlfriend.\n\n\nRick said that Liam behaved just like his father, and Liam agreed. Liam planned to protect his family. Caroline, Rick, and Ivy walked out, and Caroline shook her head at Rick.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie and Bill continued their discussion of the future of Spencer. Katie said she had missed the view from his office. Bill promised to give her his office, and he would choose another. Bill said he wanted to run the company with his family. Katie worried that she would spend too much time away from Will.\n\n\nBill said that Katie's idea of daycare had been good for the company and its employees. Katie remembered that Bill had previously said derogatory things about daycare. He feigned surprise. Katie said she needed him to admit it. He growled, \"I was wrong.\"\n\n\nKatie smiled. \"That is the sexiest thing you ever said to me,\" Katie said. Bill admitted that Katie's changes had improved the morale and productivity of the staff. \"Bill Spencer lives and learns. Who would have thought?\" Katie teased.\n\n\nBill wanted Katie to take him back. He asked who made her laugh like he did. He teased that the dressmaker couldn't possibly have done that. Katie said that Ridge had a subtle sense of humor.\n\n\nBill responded that the string on Katie's finger as a substitute for an engagement ring had been pretty funny. Bill asked Katie to take him back and let him move back in because it would make everyone -- including Will -- happy.\n\n\nBill added that daycare would be good for Will. He would be with other kids and his parents on-site at his future empire. Katie laughed and said that it would be exciting to work with Bill and Liam again.\n\n\nBill wished he could make room for Caroline at Spencer, but Katie believed Caroline had an incredible future in design. Bill scoffed that he didn't want it to be with Ridge. Katie told Bill he couldn't control everything.\n\n\nBill promised to take care of all Katie's wishes at Spencer. He asked what was preventing her from allowing him to move back into the house. Katie looked serious. She reminded him that he had let her down, and Bill admitted that he hadn't understood or handled her depression well.\n\n\n\"You chose Brooke,\" Katie said tearfully. Bill promised to make it up to her. Katie wanted to get back together, but she was worried. Bill caressed her cheek, and Katie tearfully grabbed Bills hand. He kissed her hand.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam, Ivy, and Caroline discussed Rick's volatile behavior. Liam worried that Rick had lost it. Caroline said Rick had never been that bad before. Liam asked about Caroline's relationship with Ridge, and Caroline said she had nothing to apologize for, considering what Rick had done. \"Caroline, I'm not judging you,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam added that he wanted to gauge how closely Rick needed to be watched. Ivy maintained that Rick was hurt and still loved Caroline. Rick said that was no excuse for Rick to dehumanize people. \"He won't get away with doing this to either of you,\" Liam said.\n\n\nIvy hugged Liam. \"Eric made a big mistake,\" Liam said about making Rick CEO. Liam wondered if they could contact Eric, but Ivy said Eric and her father were unreachable. Caroline noted that no one could fire Rick for a year.\n\n\nCaroline pointed out that Rick had fooled everyone into believing that she and Rick would be running the company together -- that was what Eric had wanted. Caroline lamented that Rick was the boss, and they had to accept it.\n\n\nIvy suggested that Caroline leave the office and get some rest because she had to be emotionally exhausted. Ivy hugged Caroline and sent her home. Caroline thanked Liam and hugged him. She left.\n\n\nLiam told Ivy he was looking forward to seeing her later. He promised a surprise for Ivy. \"Do I smell a plan?\" Ivy asked. He said he loved her, and he had meant it in Amsterdam as well. They kissed, and Liam left.\n\n\nAlone in his office at Forrester, Rick poured a big glass of booze and flashed back to his youth when he'd complained to someone that Ridge had hurt his mother. He took another sip of booze and looked woozy. Rick opened his briefcase and pulled out a carefully wrapped gun. He looked obsessed. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Still with that eerie laugh, Rick picks himself up off the floor and glares at Liam. He says Liam really does not want to take him on. Liam points out that Caroline is his cousin and Ivy his girlfriend and Rick can not talk to them like that without going through him first. Rick growls that he is the head of this company and he can talk to his employees anyway he wants to. Liam does not even work here so he has no say in this. Caroline says Rick was riding them and Ivy adds that Rick brought up Ridge and he started accusing Caroline all over again. Rick points to her and says it never stopped. Just ask Caroline; she is not exactly blameless. Liam asks about his roommate ..so he's not blameless either. Ivy tells him that Rick threatened to fire her and then did to Caroline. Liam says he has a habit of that lately. And he is being so hypercritical since he is sleeping with Maya every night. He knows he is in pain but that is no excuse for being a bully. Rick fights back with what Caroline did and everybody is in her corner and nobody cares about him. Liam advises him to back it up and stop acting like a little child. Rick just lashes out more and tells Ivy and Caroline they are on notice and he wants them all out of his office. Liam, Caroline and Ivy go into Ridge's office where they discuss the situation. Liam says they need to let Eric know as he would not approve of this. Caroline says he is unreachable. She and Ivy both need their jobs so they will have to figure out a way to deal with all of this.

She is shocked that he is admitting to his wrongs. He muses because of Katie and her influence he has learned to live as a better man. He knows he can do better than that uptight dressmaker with the red string. All she has to say is she will wear another real ring. She agrees to take it one day at a time and is looking forward to working with him and Liam. She reminds him that he picked Brooke and she is not over that. He says he knows he did not appreciate Katie at that time but she was ill so he takes full responsibility for their breakup. But if she will let him move back home he thinks they can be happy with Will all living under one roof. He promises that she can trust him this time. He wipes the tears from her face and kisses her hand. Rick pours himself a drink and remembers back to when he was younger and him saying he will not let Ridge hurt his mother this way again. And now it is with Caroline. He goes to his briefcase and pulls out the gun he found in Stephanie's drawer. He has such hate and disgust and anger in his eyes.",
