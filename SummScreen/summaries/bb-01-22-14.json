Outside the freight elevator, floors up from where Liam was stuck, Maya waited for the elevator and couldn't understand why it was stuck. Oliver joined her and explained that the freight elevator was always slow when the traditional elevator was out of service.\n\n\nOliver and Maya discussed a recent photo shoot. Oliver showed Maya some of the shots on his phone. \"The camera loves you,\" Oliver gushed. Oliver said that he liked working with her. He praised her eyes and her attitude. Oliver said that Maya's warmth came across in her photos. \"You brighten up a room,\" he said.\n\n\nOliver said that he had worked with many models, but Maya was something special. He and Maya talked about how well things worked between them in the studio. Oliver kissed her. Maya warned him not to do that. Oliver said he felt something, but Maya reminded him that she was engaged to Carter. Oliver acknowledged that he had been out of line.\n\n\nOliver and Maya's conversation turned back to the elevator. Maya gave up and took the stairs. Oliver went to the fuse box to see what was wrong. He noticed the flipped switch and fixed it. The freight elevator started again, and Liam was grateful that it had restarted. He arrived on the first floor and raced out to his car.\n\n\nOutside on the Forrester rooftop, Wyatt shared his news of the new trailer with other Forester employees. They all looked over the side of the building and admired Wyatt's purchase. Quinn interrupted and pressured Wyatt to hurry and start his vacation because Liam and Hope had plans to meet. Wyatt said Liam didn't threaten him. Quinn insisted that Wyatt had to prevent Liam from dissuading Hope from going on the trip.\n\n\nWyatt said that he trusted Hope, but Quinn pointed out that Hope had not told Wyatt about meeting with Liam. Wyatt shrugged and suggested that Hope and Liam had probably already met. Quinn said that she knew Liam had not left the building. She lied that Liam had a meeting with Rick. \n\n\nQuinn ordered Wyatt to leave. Wyatt countered that his mother had to stop micromanaging his life. Quinn tried to defend herself. She claimed that she wanted to be the best parent she could be. She always wanted to make up for the time that Wyatt had grown up without a dad.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that he trusted Hope, and that was what he wanted in a relationship. Quinn agreed that trust was important, but she warned Wyatt not to underestimate Liam's influence on Hope. Wyatt agreed. Quinn hugged him, and Wyatt said that he and Hope would be off the grid for a while. Wyatt left. Quinn smiled.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Hope entered and remembered good times. She sat on the couch and looked at framed photos of Liam and Hope in happier times. She looked out the window and recalled the wedding that almost occurred until Steffy interrupted.\n\n\nWyatt arrived. Wyatt persuaded Hope to leave with him, but Hope insisted that she had to give Liam a few more minutes. Later, Wyatt said they had waited long enough. Hope agreed. She said they had planned to totally unplug. Hope threw her cell phone in the ocean, and they left for their trip in the silver bullet. In the meantime, Liam called Hope's phone after she threw it into the ocean.\n\n\nToday's episode included the song, \"Home\" by B&B's makeup artist Jackie Brubaker.\n\n\n",

    "imdb": "\nTrapped with seemingly no way out, Liam makes a desperate attempt to contact Hope before she leaves with Wyatt.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "On the Sky Lounge, Wyatt is still looking at his Airstream below when Oliver walks up and asks what's so fascinating. Wyatt shows him his baby. He says he just bought it and he's taking Hope on a little trip. Things are getting better all the time. Oliver says persistence must be paying off. Wyatt laughs yes and all without Liam .work, the press and even well meaning parents. He and Hope need this time alone to make it to that next commitment. Oliver wishes him well on his road trip. Hope lets herself into Liam's house but finds no Liam. She sits on the couch and flips through a magazine. She smiles at a picture of the two of them. She opens a little box and takes out a knight in shining armor and lays it aside the picture. Maya is waiting for the freight elevator since the main one has an out of order sign on it. Oliver walks by and tells her that he has something to show her ..some beautiful photos of her in exquisite gowns. She tells him he is a very talented photographer. He says he's just there to shoot, she's the attraction. The camera loves her and she's the easiest subject he's ever had. Quinn comes out and chastises Wyatt for still being there. She had told him to hi-tail it to Liam's to pick up Hope before Liam got home. He says he is waiting for the final vehicle check. He says she looks flushed. She says she is okay. But he needs to go as Hope has agreed to meet Liam. Wyatt doesn't think he is threatened. He tells Quinn that he and Hope are in a great place. She is with him now. Quinn says now is not the time to get overconfident. Liam knows how to push Hope's buttons ..not that he's going to be pushing any. Wyatt says Liam is probably already at home by now. Quinn says no, she happens to know he's still in the building, he got distracted. Wyatt needs to get his butt over to Liam's and pick up his girlfriend and get on the road. This is no time to get complacent. Hope and Liam break up all the time but they also always get back together. He's asking her if she is implying that Hope it not trustworthy. She says all she is implying is that Liam and Hope still have a connection and Liam knows that and he will use that. So don't give him time to change Hope's mind. Liam has been stuck in an elevator for five minutes and is pounding on the walls and punching all the buttons and rattling the cage and hollering to anyone that can hear him, but no rescue. Then he remembers his cell and grabs it only to find no service. He's frustrated and butts his head against the wall. Oliver and Maya sit and wait for the elevator. He tells her that it is good to have her back. She's special .something about her eyes and her attitude. He says he has photographed a lot of models and 95% of them are aloof ..not exactly cold but not warm either. She is warm. She lights up a room. All she has to do is smile. She's flattered and says thanks. Hope looks around Liam's place and remembers their first time making love and other happy moments. Still she is getting frustrated waiting. Liam also is frustrated as he continues to rattle and pull on the cages all to no avail. Wyatt tells his mother to cool it and stop micromanaging. She does that a lot. She says okay but it is part of her charm. She says she made up her mind early on that was the way it had to be. She had to make up for it by raising him in the absence of a father. He tells her that she was enough. All the other kids were crazy about her. She says she knows she is a little pushy but it's just because she wants the best for him and all life has to offer. And that is what is happening at Forrester and pretty soon he won't even need her. He can write his ticket to anywhere. She confesses that he has found something that even she has not experienced. He's found a partner in life in Hope. Yes she has baggage with Liam and she doesn't want Wyatt to underestimate him. She knows Wyatt can stand up to Liam in every category except history. They have a history and he can not take that for granted. This trip can tip everything in his favor but he can not give Liam the chance to change Hope's mind. He needs to tell those guys he can not wait any longer. Get in that thing of his and go get Hope and hit the road. Wyatt says okay, perfect timing, looks like the trailer is ready. They'll be off the grid for a while so don't expect to hear much. She gives him a big hug and says she will manage so go have a good time. She gives a sigh of relief. Oliver says one good thing about having to wait so long for the elevator is it gave them time to get to know each other outside of just the shoots. She tells him that she usually gets nervous just before a shoot but she feels so at ease and in his good hands that all is all right. Oliver surprises her by leaning in and giving her a kiss. She enjoys it. She says she likes him a lot but she is engaged to Carter. He says he knows but he felt something. She says it is what she chose. She leaves and Oliver goes to the fuse box and flips the lever. At this point Lima feels like a caged animal at the height of exhaustion. But he's elated when the lights come on and he realizes someone is out there to help. Wyatt shows up at Liam's and lets himself in. He surprises Hope and says he knows he is not who she was expecting. She wonders how he knew she was there. He grins that he has his ways. And she must know why Liam asked her to come. He is going to try to persuade her not to go away with Wyatt. She admits that is probably true. Wyatt says what they do is none of Liam's business so they should just go. She doesn't owe it to Liam to listen to him badger her about Wyatt. She says she doesn't feel obligated but she did promise Liam so she thinks she should give it just a few more minutes. Wyatt tells her she has spent far too much of her life waiting on Liam. She holds her cell and tells Wyatt that he said totally unplugged. He says yes, that's the plan. She says she is due an upgrade anyway. She takes her cell and pitches it as far as she can into the water. Liam is rushing out of FC and calling Hope. Quinn realizes that he is not getting her. Wyatt rushes Hope to the truck, opens the door for her and says it's party time!",
