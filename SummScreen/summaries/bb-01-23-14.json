    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn encountered Charlie and again urged him to keep his silence. Charlie, however, felt bad because he'd helped Wyatt perpetrate the farce. Charlie noted that Wyatt had gotten Hope, but Liam had nothing. Charlie said it was a crime, not just a publicity prank, and as an officer of the law, he just couldn't live with keeping it quiet.  \"You will!\" Quinn declared.\n\n\nJust then, Pam strolled back to her desk, and Charlie abruptly stormed off. Pam wondered what was wrong with him, and Quinn assumed he was just overworked. Pam was feeling a little anxious about whatever seemed to be bothering Charlie, but Quinn advised Pam to leave it alone.\n\n\nPam said she liked to get things out in the open, but that might be why she was low on the totem pole at Forrester. Quinn exclaimed that Pam was the executive assistant to important people, but Pam replied that she didn't think of herself that way.\n\n\nQuinn offered to take Pam to lunch, but Pam said she had her bologna sandwich. Quinn decided that Pam was too important not to take a break, and Quinn offered to treat Pam.\n\n\nAt the outdoor caf\u00e9 later, Pam said that Quinn didn't have to do the fancy lunch. Quinn conveyed that she didn't get out very often and added that, just between them, she didn't have a lot of friends. Quinn confided that the people at Forrester weren't her type. \"They're all a bit stuck-up, if you know what I mean,\" Quinn said, and Pam replied that she did know.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that she'd been right in her first impressions of Pam. Quinn felt that Pam was straightforward and easy to be with, and Quinn really wanted to be Pam's friend. Flattered, Pam gasped, and Quinn toasted to friendship.\n\n\nQuinn thanked Pam for having lunch with her. Quinn usually ate alone, and she guessed she'd made a few mistakes with people. Pam said she'd done a few things in the past, but she was a different person. The women agreed that people deserved second chances.\n\n\nPam was curious to know if Quinn had ever done anything really bad. Quinn decided to confide something in Pam -- since they were friends. \"It's about my son...\" Quinn began saying.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam rushed in to find Hope, but Caroline was there instead. Caroline said she'd just seen Hope with Wyatt on the highway in \"that ridiculous trailer of his.\" Though Caroline claimed to be neutral about the Hope situation between her cousins, she advised that if Liam wanted Hope's love, then he should let Hope go.\n\n\nLiam told Caroline about his suspicions that Quinn had trapped him in the freight elevator. Caroline asked if Liam thought Wyatt knew about his mother's idiosyncrasies, and Liam stated that he thought Wyatt was covering for Quinn. Caroline asked if Liam might be jealous, but he insisted that no one knew what Quinn might do next.\n\n\nCaroline asked what Quinn could possibly do. Liam replied that the woman had flown to Paris to ruin his wedding, and he was concerned about a cornered Quinn's next move. He was certain that he and Hope weren't finished, and he was worried about how Quinn would react once she realized that. Liam insisted that he had to protect Hope.\n\n\nOn a roadside, Hope perched on a rock overlooking the ocean, and Wyatt approached after checking the tires on the bullet trailer that he had attached to the back of a pickup truck. They decided to take pictures, and Hope pulled him in for a kiss. The pair drove on and found another beachside location that was more suitable to set up the trailer.\n\n\nA song played as Hope and Wyatt played catch football, frolicked, and made out on the beach. Wyatt took Hope into the trailer for the first time, and she exclaimed that it was so him. He was glad she liked it because it would be their cozy home for a while. He wanted it to be the \"good old days\" for them to look back on and said maybe they'd never go back home.\n\n\nHope figured his mom would have something to say about that. Wyatt grew quiet and said he needed to talk to her about his mother. He hadn't really discussed Quinn with anyone else because no one else had mattered enough in his life. He admitted that Quinn was pretty wrapped up in her son; however, he was hopeful that Hope would get used to that, because Quinn really liked her.\n\n\nWyatt said he didn't want Hope to be shocked or surprised if Quinn got a little overprotective at times.  \"Like sending me private videos or getting Steffy to fly back to L.A.,\" Hope murmured. Wyatt was sorry for his mother's actions, and he guessed that Quinn's people skills were the reason that their business hadn't taken off until the Forrester deal.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that once, Quinn had sold some gems that hadn't been what she'd claimed them to be. Hope was shocked and asked if he'd known about it. Wyatt said they'd barely been surviving, so he hadn't stopped Quinn. He claimed that he'd never done anything like that since he'd met Hope, but he wanted her to know who he'd been and who he'd become, thanks to her.\n\n\nHope asked if there was anything else Wyatt had to tell her, and Wyatt grew worried that his honesty had messed up things. She replied that honesty could never do that. She decided that she wouldn't fault him for his parents if he wouldn't fault her for hers. He called it a deal and kissed her.\n\n\nWyatt handed Hope a big gift box and said it was one of many surprises for her. He asked her not to open it until he was gone. Hope asked where he was going, and he said to set something up.\n\n\nLater, Hope had changed into the white flowing skirt and half bustier that Wyatt had given her. She found him on the beach, pitching a teepee. She was impressed by his craftsmanship and said she hadn't expected it. Wyatt told her that she was as beautiful as anything out there, and they kissed. \n\n\n",

Wyatt and Hope embark on their camping trip up the scenic California coast as they get to know each other on a deeper level. Trying not to take sides, Caroline hints to Liam that it may be time for him to let Hope go. Quinn has an ulterior motive when she asks Pam to join her for lunch.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn notices Charlie alone looking at some papers. She tries to compliment him by saying he's doing a good job. The Forrester's picked a good man. She tells him he needs to forget what happened at the boutique. He has nothing to be ashamed of. He spews except for the fact he is keeping the dirty little secret of her son. Now Wyatt has Hope and Liam has nothing. And he helped her son pull that off. Quinn tells him that he did Forrester a big favor that paid a huge dividend. Charlie argues that was no publicity stunt. That was a crime and two men are in jail because of it. He says he is an officer of the law and he can't live with this. She gets in his face and demands that he will. Pam walks up and Charlie is gruff with even her and leaves. Liam rushes home thinking he will find Hope there. He only finds Caroline who is making herself at home. She says she saw Wyatt and Hope in that ridiculous trailer along PCH. She tells Liam that she is not taking sides but in her vast field of knowledge about such things if he wants to win Hope over he has to let her go. Wyatt parks the truck and makes sure it is safe while Hope sits on a huge boulder by the water. Wyatt takes some selfies including some of them kissing. They drive a little further and find a spot to permanently park. Wyatt hops out and opens the door for her. She puts a block of wood under the tires to maintain it and Wyatt puts stakes in the ground to set up their site. One of them grabs the football and they start their frolic in the sand. She jumps in his arms and he carries her piggyback. Soon they are not worried about the football; they kiss. Quinn butters Pam up by saying just leave Charlie alone for a bit; he's probably just overworked. She tells Pam that she is too with all these executives she has to please around here. She deserves a break so she is inviting her out to lunch, girlfriend, and lunch is on her. Pam says that sounds better than her baloney sandwich so okay. Liam tells Caroline that he knows Quinn's footprint by now. There is nothing she won't do including bringing Steffy back from Paris and now locking him in the elevator. Caroline asks if he thinks Wyatt is aware of his mother's insanity and he says yes of course he is. He's covering for her. Caroline thinks he might be just a teeny bit jealous. He says this is so far past jealousy. He's worried about Hope's safety. With as any tricks as Quinn has pulled there is no telling what she might do. Maybe he's being melodramatic but he knows he and Hope are not finished and he thinks Quinn knows that too. He loves her too much so he has to protect her. Wyatt has Hope close her eyes while he guides her into the trailer \"Rock and Roll\". He shows her the fridge, the stove, the bed and she is wild with glee and says it is so him. She says she loves it. He's happy as this will be Home Sweet Home for a little while. While on that subject he says he has never opened up much about his mom but since Hope is the only one that matters, he'd like to say more. She's a woman who is pretty wrapped up in her son. But she loves Hope because he does. He just doesn't want Hope to get nervous if Quinn gets a little ..overprotective. He tells her he is so sorry that Quinn sent her the Liam video he sent Steffy or brought Steffy back from Paris. He even says the reason their company never really took off is because of her people skills. Hope wants to know what he means. He explains by saying his mother sold some gems one time that weren't exactly what she claimed they were. Hope asks if Wyatt was aware of it. He says he had no part in it but he didn't stop it either. They were just barely getting by. He's never done anything like that since meeting Hope and he wants her to know who he is. There is the Wyatt then and the Wyatt now, two different people. And the difference is her. She asks if there is anything else he wants to tell her. He says no and he hopes he has not ruined his chances by telling her that. She says no, honesty never messes up anything with her. They both have some very interesting parents so if he doesn't fault her for hers she won't fault him for his. He says deal! He gives her a big box and says not to open it up until he is ready. At lunch, Quinn confides in Pam that she doesn't have many friends and not even at FC as they are sort of stuck up. She really likes Pam and wants to call her a friend. She makes a toast to friendship. They eat their lunch, drink a little more wine and start confessing some of their really bad times; things they did that were kind of nasty. Quinn says she does not like to talk about it but since they are friends and she knows she can trust Pam, it's about her son. Hope comes out of the trailer looking for Wyatt. She has on this gorgeous billowy white see thru two piece gown. She sees him in the distance setting up a lean-to tent. She thanks him for this; it's so au natural. They kiss.",
