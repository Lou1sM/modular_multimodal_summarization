Bill assumed Liam was expecting Steffy and asked if she were running late.\n\n\nFrustrated, Liam said Steffy was running late, and Liam was running out of patience with people interfering in his life. \"If only Ridge had -- \" Liam started to say but shut himself up. Bill asked what Ridge should have done. Liam disregarded the question as he wrung his hands, saying Steffy had gone running at Wyatt's beck and call.\n\n\n\"They are married,\" Bill replied. Liam said he knew and had heard enough of it from Quinn, Eric, and Wyatt. Liam wanted the divorce to be done and the stupid tattoo to be off Steffy's finger. Sick of Steffy catering to Wyatt, Liam asserted that he'd told her to end things with Wyatt and get back there. \"And I meant it,\" Liam emphasized.\n\n\nBill liked seeing his son fired up and determined. Bill asked if Steffy was on board with Liam's desires. Liam replied that she'd said she was, and Wyatt just had to get along without her.\n\n\nBill took the conversation back to Ridge and pressed Liam to say what Ridge should have done. Liam stated that it was stupid, but Bill asked him to go on. Bill was surprised when Liam said Ridge and Quinn had taken a trip alone. \"No referee? Were they in a fighting cage?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nLiam explained that Ridge had been determined to get Quinn out of Eric's life. Bill asked how. Liam replied that it didn't matter; it hadn't worked, and Quinn was there to stay. Bill was sure Quinn would work hard to keep her crazy under control. \"But you know who's gonna screw up? Forrester,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nLater, Liam asked how long it took to tell someone it was over. Bill replied that Liam knew how it \"is with those two.\" Liam said that Bill meant \"how it isn't.\" Bill stated that it took some time, and Wyatt and Steffy \"do care\" about each other. \"So I've heard,\" Liam quipped.\n\n\nBill advised Liam not to lose faith. Bill said he'd been tracking Brooke for a long time, and she'd gotten engaged to Ridge. Bill said he wasn't losing faith. Liam asked when Brooke would be back. Bill figured she'd be in Italy as long as Hope needed her.\n\n\nLiam asked if the wedding would be when Brooke got back. \"Fat chance,\" Bill replied. Liam wondered if Bill had something cooking. Bill replied that he didn't have to. In his view, Ridge would self-destruct as he always did.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Steffy guessed that Wyatt had asked her there to reminisce. Wyatt told her that she was wrong, but doing so wasn't such a bad idea. Flashbacks played of their time together at the beach, in the house, and in Monte Carlo. Wyatt said that, no matter what happened, the memories couldn't be taken away from them.\n\n\nWyatt acknowledged that his part in Steffy's life was over. Steffy knew he didn't want to hear that. Agreeing, he said he'd never regret their wedding day. Steffy told Wyatt not to go there, and whatever he wanted or hoped for, she couldn't give it to him.\n\n\nSomeone knocked on the door. Wyatt said he'd invited someone to join them. Steffy was surprised to see Carter, who entered with an envelope in hand. Carter gleaned that Wyatt hadn't told Steffy and asked if they were sure it was what they both wanted. Steffy asked what was happening, and Carter handed Wyatt the envelope.\n\n\nWyatt opened the envelope and handed the contents to Steffy. It was legal paperwork. As Steffy flipped through it, Carter decided that his job was done, and he left. \"The divorce...it's finalized,\" Steffy said, reading over it. Wyatt stated that it was signed, sealed, and delivered.\n\n\nStammering, Steffy conveyed that it hadn't been why she'd thought Wyatt had asked her there. Wyatt replied that he wished Carter had been there to renew Wyatt and Steffy's wedding vows, but it wasn't what Steffy wanted. Steffy asked, \"Why now?\" Wyatt replied that it had been getting kind of old, and Eric, Quinn, and Wyatt pressuring Steffy had been a cheap shot.\n\n\nSteffy said she hadn't seen it that way. Wyatt replied that Liam had, and Liam was right if one saw it from Liam's point of view. \"Don't tell him I said that,\" Wyatt added. Wyatt said Eric and Quinn had tried to help out, but Wyatt didn't want Steffy to be with him under pressure. He wanted Steffy to be with him because she wanted to -- if she wanted to. He stated that it wasn't the case, so \"voila.\"\n\n\nSteffy hugged Wyatt and didn't know what to say. Wyatt didn't want a thanks. He said to consider it an act of love or insanity.\n\n\nAnother knock sounded on the door, and Wyatt said there was one more thing to take care of. He opened the door for the tattoo removal doctor, and Steffy asked what he was doing there. Wyatt said there was one last treatment, and then \"this\" was gone. \"And then our marriage is officially over,\" Wyatt stated.\n\n\nWyatt watched as Steffy winched and tried to keep her composure during the laser treatment. When it was over, the doctor said to keep it bandaged for a while. Guessing that the papers and the removal had done the trick, Wyatt asked Steffy how it felt to be a free woman.\n\n\nIn the design office, Ridge flashed back on kissing Quinn. Pam entered, announcing the arrival of \"da boss.\" Eric was with her and said he was \"in the house.\"\n\n\nLooking over Ridge's shoulder, Eric gazed at a design. Eric thought it was beautiful and asked whom they had to thank for the inspiration. Pam assumed that it had to be love and asked when the wedding date was. She decided that maybe Ridge shouldn't get married because the design was the stuff of passion, not love. Eric pretended to hear the phones ringing, and Pam exited.\n\n\n Eric told Ridge that he'd gotten Quinn's side of the story about the trip, and he wanted to hear Ridge's. Eric remarked that the trip had had a big impact on Quinn, and Ridge said it had on him, too. Eric remarked that he'd waited a long time for Ridge to see Quinn as Eric did.\n\n\nEric hadn't expected Ridge to change his feelings in a weekend, but Ridge's words at the symposium had been generous. Eric appreciated it and asked what had caused Ridge to say what he'd said about Quinn. Ridge replied that it was tough to know. Eric replied that he was glad Quinn and Ridge were getting closer.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Quinn was upset as she recalled kissing Ridge. Ivy entered and upon immediately noticing a disturbance with Quinn, Ivy asked what was going on. Quinn behaved as if it was work stress, and Ivy added that Ridge was heaping hate on Quinn.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was alone, hunched over his drawing table. He intently stared into his memories of finding Quinn at the outdoor shower, putting ice on her ankle, and rubbing his hand up her leg in the steam room.\n\n\nQuinn was across the hall, alone and thinking of the same things. She seemed as if she might hyperventilate. Ivy entered as it was happening and asked what was going on with Quinn.\n\n\nA heartbeat echoed in Quinn's ears, and Ivy's voice sounded distant, even though Ivy was right behind her. Ivy grabbed Quinn's shoulders, and Quinn heard Ivy more clearly as Ivy asked if Quinn was okay. Quinn said she loved Eric so much, and she'd screwed things up so much.\n\n\nIvy replied that Quinn hadn't screwed anything up. Quinn murmured that she knew, and she couldn't. Ivy determined that Quinn was burning up and had a fever. Quinn insisted that she was fine and just needed to be alone with her thoughts. Ivy looked worried as Quinn strode out of the office.\n\n\nBack across the hall, Ridge was hot, too, and cooling his face and neck with a glass water bottle. He repeatedly said \"no\" and charged out the door.\n\n\nIn the basement, Quinn moved with quickened breaths through cramped rows of clothes. She stopped by a ladder to calm her beating heart, and Ridge emerged through a rack of clothes and stood right behind her. Quinn turned around. Their eyes met, and she gulped.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Steffy becomes confused when Carter arrives at the Beach House. Wyatt presents divorce papers to Steffy which the lawyer had drawn up. Steffy is touched that Wyatt is giving up on their marriage despite his obvious feelings for her. To underline that he is willing to let Steffy go, both he and Steffy then undergo skin laser treatment to remove their wedding band tattoos. Meanwhile, a frustrated Liam shares with Bill the ultimatum that he issued to Steffy. At Forrester Creations, Pam is curious as to why Ridge and Brooke have not set a wedding date yet. Ridge is unsure of how to answer when Eric questions him about his and Quinn's recent trip to San Francisco. Across the hall, Ivy notices that Quinn seems preoccupied. This assessment is correct as Quinn has a difficult time keeping her mind off of Ridge, yet she feels guilty about being emotionally unfaithful to Eric.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy sips on her wine and tells Wyatt she knows why she is here; he wanted to reminisce. He says good idea but that is not the main reason. He says they had a great life and no matter what happens they cannot take that away from them. Steffy listens but then says do not do this. She cannot give him what he wants. Legal eagle, Carter drops by and says he has some papers. Liam is shaken when Bill just walks in and asks if Steffy is late. Liam says yes, he is so sick of these people .if only Ridge .

Eric dispenses of Pam and laments to Ridge that he has heard Quinn's side of the story, now he'd like to hear his. He knows the trip wasn't all that he expected. He has waited a long time for Ridge to see Quinn like he does. But he does not expect that in one day. He appreciates all he did to get closer to her. He asked what brought that on and Ridge cannot give him a good answer. Bill tells Liam that he likes seeing him all fired up and determined. Liam says it is fine with him if Eric wants to be lead around by the nose by Quinn, even her with Wyatt, but not Steffy. Wyatt pulls out the papers and hands them to Steffy. Carter wishes them luck and says his job is done. She is shocked that their divorce is finalized, signed, sealed and delivered. He says he wishes they were renewing their wedding vows but he knew that was not what she wanted.

Another gentleman comes in and Wyatt tells her she has one more treatment with her ring finger before their marriage is over. Liam fills Bill in with Ridge and Quinn being in S. F. without a referee. The idea was to get her out of their lives for good but it did not work. Quinn thinks back on the times with Ridge, in the outdoor shower when he saw her, helping her with her sprained ankle and touching it in the steam room and then the kiss in S.F. The technician tells Steffy the finger will need to be bandaged a little longer but the tattoo has been removed. Bill tells Liam do not lose faith. Give it a little more time like he is giving Brooke. Quinn is shaken but tells Ivy she just needs to be alone right now. Ridge is pretty warm himself and leaves his office.
