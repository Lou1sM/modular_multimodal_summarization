He tempts Arthur by telling him if he sold Harrison's he would have more time and money to devote to his true passion, cars.  At first Arthur isn't interested, but he starts to reconsider once he discovers how much Nick is willing to pay.  Nick pressures him to make a decision fast; telling him his offer won't last for long.  Arthur promises to give him an answer within two days.  After Arthur leaves the plane, Nick calls his lawyer and instructs him to draw up the papers for the sale; he is confident that it will go through.  He then gazes at a picture of Taylor, Thorne and Aly that was in his briefcase.\n\n\nAt Forrester Originals, Bridget stops by to see Thorne and check on how things are going with Ally.  Although Thorne is frustrated that everything is up in the air about the wedding, he tells Bridget he is hopeful that Aly will come around.  Then Thorne tells her about Ridge's theory that Nick is interested in Taylor.  Bridget just thinks Nick is grateful to Taylor for helping him with his past. Before they can discuss it further, Thorne gets a call.  While he is on the phone Bridget begins to wonder if Ridge may have a point, and rushes out of the office to go speak with Taylor.\n\n\nAt Taylor's, Phoebe continues to grille Taylor about all the time she is spending with Nick.  Taylor assures her daughter that nothing is going on between them.  Phoebe believes her Mom, but just doesn't understand why she is spending so much time with Nick if he is no longer her patient.  Taylor explains that Nick is her friend and she doesn't care if the Forrester's like it or not.  While they are still talking, Nick stops by, with Taylor's sunglasses that she forgot and a wedding gift.   After Phoebe leaves, Nick gives Taylor her gift and she is surprised to see that it is a framed picture of her, Thorne and Ally.  He explains that even though he doesn't think she and Thorne should get married, he still supports her decision.  He adds that he will always be there for her, if she ever needs him.  Touched by his words, Taylor gives him a hug.  As they are embracing Bridget walks in and is shocked by their closeness.  She confronts them, asking how long this has been going on.  Taylor and Nick attempt to convince her that she is over reacting, but Bridget is on to them.  Bridget lashes out at Taylor saying she can't believe she would do this to Thorne after all he has forgiven her for.  Bridget remembers how everyone used to always look up to Taylor as a model of virtue.  Disgusted, Bridget asks Taylor, what the Hell happened to her.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the Forresters', Jackie spies on Eric and Pam from the balcony.  She overhears Pam unsuccessfully attempting to get Eric to makeup with Stephanie.  After they leave the room, Jackie sneaks in, thinking to herself that Pam is no match for her.  Once she gets into Eric's bedroom, Jackie removes her clothes, gets into a bubble bath and sips champagne, eagerly waiting for her prey.   When Eric walks into the bathroom, he is surprised to find Jackie soaking in his tub.  She offers him a glass of champagne and toasts to his new company.  Jackie tells him even though they are rivals in business, they can still be friendly outside the office.  When she invites him to join her in the tub, Eric politely refuses, saying he is still a married man.  He tells her he has to do some work.  Not taking no for an answer, Jackie continues to throw herself at him.  As he walks out, she tells him she will be waiting for him.  Later, Pam walks in on her and is appalled by Jackie's nerve.  Pam tells Jackie her sister was right, she is a whore.  Proving she is no pushover, Pam forces Jackie to get out of the tub and leave. \n\n\n",
