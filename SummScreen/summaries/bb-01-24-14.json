    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach, Wyatt and Hope kissed. Hope was flattered that Wyatt had made the setup for her, and Wyatt said that, with help from Mother Nature, it was just another day in paradise. She was happy that she'd agreed to the trip, and he stated that it was just the beginning.\n\n\nWyatt and Hope cuddled under their makeshift tent, and Hope asked what was next. Wyatt replied that there was no agenda, and they'd do whatever they wanted whenever they wanted. They strolled down the beach and saw dolphins in the ocean. Wyatt hoped she didn't feel bummed out about being disconnected from the world, but Hope said that everything she needed was right there.\n\n\nA song played as the sun set. Wyatt and Hope danced on the beach. At night, they made a fire, roasted marshmallows, and kissed on a pallet. Hope relaxed in Wyatt's arms, and he said he'd dreamed of finding a place of peace, but a person, not a place, had given him peace and satisfaction. He said that her eyes reflected everything good in the world, and the closer they got, the more he felt it.\n\n\nA song played as Hope and Wyatt kissed. He pulled the tent's flap down, and they began to have sex inside the tent.\n\n\nAt lunch with Quinn, Pam said that she was a really good listener if Quinn needed to get something off her chest. Quinn stated that she'd been all alone when she'd had Wyatt. Quinn hadn't had any guidance in parenting, and he'd become her reason for existence. She admitted that it probably wasn't always easy for Wyatt to have her as a mother.\n\n\nQuinn felt the line between parenting and friendship was hard to define, and Pam said that Quinn had gone overboard with the Hope thing. Quinn claimed that she'd had been terrified of losing Wyatt, but after she'd seen how good Hope was for him, Quinn's excitement had carried her away.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to show Pam some other places that afternoon, and Pam figured that it was okay, because Donna would cover for her at work. Quinn remarked that she and Pam were very different, but it made for a good friendship. Raising her glass, Quinn toasted to new friendships.\n\n\nA song about best friends played as scenes of Pam and Quinn talking, shopping, and getting manicures played. Quinn pretended to enjoy herself but rolled her eyes whenever Pam wasn't looking.\n\n\nWhen the chatting Pam and Quinn returned to Forrester, an irritated Charlie was standing by Pam's desk. He asked where Pam had been all afternoon and why Pam was with \"her.\" Pam chuckled as she explained what she'd done with Quinn that afternoon, and Quinn remarked that she and Pam were friends. Charlie ordered Pam to stay away from Quinn and Wyatt, who were both trouble.\n\n\nThe shocked Pam asked what had gotten into Charlie. Charlie said he'd been hiding something from her about Wyatt. Quinn cut in and reminded Pam that Quinn had said that she and Wyatt could get carried away at times. Quinn said that Wyatt had done something, and she wanted Pam to hear her out.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Ridge arrived with a cell phone Katie had left at his house. Katie said she was taking a mental health day, and he asked if their talk earlier hadn't helped her. She replied that it had made her go home and pull out books to read, but she guessed that it wasn't his usual effect on women.\n\n\nKatie felt that she had a lot of work to do on herself, and Ridge had been very helpful to her. \"And here you are again,\" she added. Ridge asked if that bothered her. She wasn't bothered, but she asked if people would miss him at the office. He stated that they'd call him if they needed him. Katie recalled that she'd encountered Ridge at Brooke's door earlier, but he said his talk with Brooke could wait.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Rick told Brooke about Hope's impromptu trip. Brooke said that Hope had just gotten back from Hawaii, and he replied that she'd ended things with Liam there. Rick figured that the new trip would take things to the next level for Hope and Wyatt. Brooke said Hope took that type of thing seriously, but Rick stated that Wyatt would be protective of Hope's feelings.\n\n\nThe conversation shifted to Ridge, and Brooke stated that Ridge needed time. Rick said Ridge had been in Paris for months and months. Brooke replied that Ridge had returned for her. She pulled out the ring Ridge had given her in Italy, and Rick was surprised that she hadn't given it back. She stated that Ridge hadn't asked for it back.\n\n\nBrooke felt that when Ridge had been gone, she'd given him the time and space that he'd needed; however, he'd returned, and she just couldn't wait any longer.\n\n\nBrooke called Ridge, who told her that it wasn't a good time because he was with Katie. Brooke asked if they were at Katie's office, and he replied that they were at Katie's house. Brooke said it was good that Ridge was supporting Katie, but what Brooke wanted couldn't wait. Brooke stated that taking more time wasn't really the answer for them. Ridge agreed to stop by Brooke's house later.\n\n\nBack at Katie's house, Ridge ended his call, and Katie guessed he'd been speaking with Brooke. Ridge conveyed that Brooke wanted to see him, and he'd stop by her house later. Katie decided that Ridge should go at that moment because Brooke needed him.\n\n\nRidge said that Brooke wanted an answer, but he didn't know what to say to her. Katie figured that he might feel different after seeing Brooke. Katie stated that Ridge was a good guy, and she understood what Brooke saw in him. Kate expressed that, after all she'd been through with Bill, it was nice for her to be around a decent man.\n\n\nTo Ridge and Katie's surprise, Brooke whizzed in through the front door. She said she hadn't been able to wait to talk to Ridge. Katie remarked that Ridge had been on his way to Brooke's house, but Brooke said it was probably good for Katie to hear what Brooke had to say to Ridge.\n\n\nBrooke relayed that Ridge had said he'd needed time, but he'd built a wall between them. Brooke was ready for the wall to crumble. In Brooke's hand was her engagement ring. She showed it to Ridge and said that they could put their mistakes behind them and move forward. She told him that they could make a decision to move forward, and all he had to do was put the ring on her finger and agree to marry her. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Convinced that Pam is her new best friend, Quinn reveals the secret about Wyatt\u2019s part in the jewelry heist. Rick and Brooke differ in their opinions regarding Hope jumping so quickly into a relationship with Wyatt. Katie is pleasantly surprised by a dinner invitation she receives from a handsome gentleman. Amidst the backdrop of the Pacific Ocean, Hope and Wyatt bond while discussing the unexpected direction that their lives have recently taken.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hope tells Wyatt that she is so glad she said yes to this trip. He is glad too as their adventure is just beginning. He pulls her closer and kisses her. Pam and Quinn continue with their lunch. The waiter pours more wine. Pam tells Quinn if there is anything she'd like to get off her chest, people tell her that she's a really good listener. Quinn says it's not easy for her. She was really young when she had Wyatt and she had no one to teach her how to be a parent. He became her whole reason for living and they have accomplished a lot, but it hasn't always been easy having her as a mother. It's a fine line between is she being supportive or smothering him. She admits she was scared she might lose Wyatt when he became interested in Hope but Hope is so nice that then Quinn really got carried away with wanting them together. They drink more wine and Quinn convinces Pam that if she doesn't have to go right back to work there are a few more places she'd like to take her. She'd really like to have her as a friend and she offers a toast to that. They go shopping and Pam has the time of her life trying on clothes, jewels, scarves, fur wraps and polishing it off with a mani/pedi. Hope and Wyatt cuddle on the sand and she asks what is next. He says that is the beauty. They have no itinerary, no schedule, no maps or agenda. He says it's just the two of them and they can do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it. They walk on the beach and see some dolphins swimming just offshore. Wyatt says this is supposed to be freedom for her but he also doesn't want her to feel too disconnected. She says no, she loves it. Everything she needs is right here. Rick explains to his mother that Hope has been through a lot so he told her it would be okay for her to get away with Wyatt. She let go of Liam in Hawaii but this trip may mean she is ready to take it to the next level with Wyatt. And from everything he has seen, he doesn't seem like the type to play around with her feelings. He's very protective. Ridge shows up at Katie's and says she left her phone at his house and her secretary said she was working from home today. She invites him in and even shows him a pile of books on her coffee table that she drug out and was reading. She says that is probably not the effect he usually has on women. Brooke opens her purse and brings out her engagement ring and shows Rick. She says it is the ring that Ridge gave her when he proposed in Italy. He did not ask for it back and she kept it. When Rick shakes his head, she says Ridge left and she let him go. He stayed away and she did not push him. Now he's back and she is here. He says he needs a little more time, but she can't wait any longer. Ridge tells Katie that nobody has been more loyal to her family than she has. She's strong and it's a beautiful thing to see. He answers his phone and it's Brooke saying she needs to see him. He muses that now is not a good time; he's with Katie. Brooke thinks that is good that he is with her as she needs someone to talk to but this really can't wait. And time is not the answer for them. Ridge says he will stop by later. Katie tells Ridge to go to Brooke now; she needs him. She can see why Brooke has loved him all these years. He's a good guy and decent and after all she has been through with Bill, it's good to be around a man who still treats women with respect and kindness. Brooke walks in and says she just couldn't wait. Katie stammers that Ridge was just about to leave to go see her. Brooke says ok, but she just had to come and it's okay if Katie hears this too. Ridge looks uncomfortable but Brooke continues. She knows he asked for more time, but she feels he has put up this wall and she thinks it is time that it came down. She brings out the ring and reminds him of when he gave it to her in the olive groves of Italy. She says they can do this. They just need to take those mistakes and put them behind them and move forward. They don't have to wait; just do it. Just take this ring and put it on her finger and just say that he will marry her. Charlie is cross with Pam when she and Quinn come back from their long lunch. He also doesn't like the fact that Pam was with her! He does not want them to be good friends. In fact, he tells Pam to definitely stay away from Quinn; she's trouble and so is Wyatt. Quinn closes the door and tells them that Wyatt is not trouble. Pam doesn't know why he is saying these things. Charlie says he has been hiding something from her, but he can't do it any longer. Quinn breaks in and asks Pam to please listen to her. She asks her to remember at lunch when they were talking about Wyatt and getting carried away. Well, Wyatt did something. It wasn't malicious, but it was wrong. Now he and Hope are so happy, so she is begging Pam not to listen to Charlie but to hear her out first. Wyatt and Hope walk a little, dance a little on the beach then sit and roast marshmallows over the fire and exchange them with each other. And kiss some more. He tells her all of his life he has wanted to get out and find his own peace and solitude, something that changes him. But now he realizes it isn't a place that changes you but a person. He vows that he has found all his peace and satisfaction right there in her eyes. Her eyes tell the truth and all is good in the world. The closer he gets, the more he feels it. He kisses her on the lips, then her shoulders and her neck, her tummy and her leg. He pulls the flap to the tent closed. She takes off his shirt, he kisses her more. She arches her back as he lays her down and they both smother each other with kisses.",
