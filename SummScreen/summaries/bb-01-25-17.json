They celebrated that Steffy's marriage to Wyatt was over. Liam rejoiced that there was literally nothing to stop them. \"Finally,\" Steffy said.\n\n\n\nLiam had questions about what had happened, and he said that he'd worried when he had been unable to get ahold of Steffy. He figured Wyatt had begged her to return to him, but Steffy said he had been sweet and had called Carter and the tattoo removal doctor. They had reminisced about their marriage while they'd had their tattoos removed. Liam understood that it had to have been hard for Wyatt. Steffy agreed.\n\n\n\nSteffy said that Wyatt had been sweet and funny. He understood that it wouldn't help his cause to pressure her any longer. Liam and Steffy agreed they felt for Wyatt. Liam said it had been clear that one of them was going to get hurt. Steffy confessed that she would always care about Wyatt. \"I love my brother, too,\" Liam said. He added that Wyatt had earned his respect. \"I'm gonna have to thank him for that,\" Liam said.\n\n\n\nSteffy said she couldn't wait to stay in bed all day with Liam and fall asleep in his arms. \"I'm home. I'm all yours,\" she said. Liam teased that she kept saying that. Steffy motioned to the bedroom, and they headed there. \"Welcome home,\" Liam said. They undressed each other and made love.\n\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Liam discussed that they would never sleep alone again -- unless they were away on business. Liam joked that he would just accompany his sexy CEO wherever she went. Steffy laughed that he had become more tolerant. She told him she liked that they had their little disagreements.\n\n\n\nSteffy felt awful about what she had put Liam through. She lamented that she should have argued with Eric about his demands on her personal time, and she never should have moved out. \"I should have fought for us like you fought for me,\" she said. Liam said he had felt her slipping away. She said she would never leave him again. They had loved each other \"for so long.\" \"And now, here we are,\" she said. For the rest of their lives, they agreed.\n\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Wyatt told Eric and Quinn that he had set Steffy free. He had also found a way to move on and had started to get rid of his wedding band tattoo. Quinn blamed herself, but Wyatt said it wasn't her fault. He respected the partnership that Quinn and Eric had -- it was an inspiration. He knew he wouldn't have that with Steffy.\n\n\n\nWyatt thanked Eric for his support. He said goodbye to Quinn and Eric. Wyatt said it was time for him to leave, and he had learned from Eric and Quinn what a real committed relationship looked like. They hugged Wyatt, and he left.\n\n\n\nEric told Quinn that Wyatt would be fine. Quinn agreed, and she was proud of her son. She thanked Eric for accepting both of them into his family and supporting them. She said she had learned from him, and she had a proposal to bring peace to the family. Quinn said they had been too hard on Ridge. She said that taking the CEO position away from him and giving it to Steffy had been harsh.\n\n\n\n\"I'm shocked you would even bring it up,\" Eric said. He reminded Quinn that Ridge had betrayed him, and he would never forget that. She understood, but she added that Ridge was a sensitive guy who had built a layer of protection around himself.\n\n\n\nEric said it had been very perceptive of Quinn. She added that she understood Ridge had been trying to protect Eric because he'd thought his father was in danger. \"That makes him a good son,\" she said. She wanted to move past their disagreements as a company and a family. Eric said it was a lofty goal.\n\n\n\nQuinn agreed, and she proposed that Ridge and Steffy share the CEO position. Eric couldn't believe she had suggested it. Quinn said she wanted to reunite Ridge and Eric because Ridge clearly loved Eric. She wanted peace in the family. \"Think about it,\" she said. Eric and Quinn hugged.\n\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Charlie and Pam discussed meringue peaks, and Pam ran in to a meeting with Ridge, Nicole, Rick, and Thomas. Nicole praised Ridge's designs, and they all noted that Ridge had incorporated jewelry into his designs. Ridge reminded them that Quinn was a part of the company, and her jewelry was also. Pam said she did make nice jewelry.\n\n\n\nRick and Thomas questioned how they were going to get rid of Quinn, but Ridge said she wouldn't be a problem anymore. He felt they needed to accept her. Pam questioned if Ridge and Quinn were friends, but Ridge said she had changed the dynamics of the company. Most importantly, she made Eric happy. She drew out the best in Eric, and they all had to appreciate that. Ridge wanted to find some peace. Rick and Thomas looked at each other.\n\n\n\nLater at Forrester, Ridge sat by himself working. He flashed back to his kiss with Quinn, and he rubbed his head.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Wyatt updates Quinn and Eric that his divorce is finalized; he loves Steffy but cannot force her to feel the same. He thanks Quinn and Eric for being his stellar example of a solid relationship. Later, Quinn stuns Eric that she thinks that they have been too harsh on Ridge and that he and Steffy should be Co-CEOs of the company. At Forrester Creations, Ridge also sports a completely new perspective by sharing nothing but praises about Quinn's latest jewelry designs. Rick, Thomas, Nicole, Pam and Charlie hardly believe their ears. When questioned about his sudden change in attitude towards Quinn, Ridge credits the trip to San Francisco for making him realize that Quinn is a great asset to the company.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells the group that they have tried everything to get rid of Quinn but she has agreed not to make trouble around here so they may as well accept her. They are not friends but he will accept her. Though they hate to, they do acknowledge that her jewelry accentuates his new designs beautifully. Ridge says she even brings out the best in his father so he will take a page from him and learn to mellow out too. The reunion has begun; Liam brings Steffy home and they both say the divorce is final and there is nothing to stand in their way now. He can't believe it is true, that she is not married to Wyatt anymore. She tells him Wyatt was quiet nice and made it all easy. He says he loves his brother but after earlier today he was not expecting this. He will have to thank him and he wishes he could be happy too. Wyatt tells Eric and Quinn that it was hard to let Steffy go but she did not love him as much as Liam so there was no reason for him to hold onto her. He has been grateful to live here but it is time to go now. Quinn says go on with his life and have a good one. He hopes it will be as good and trusting as their own. Quinn thanks Eric for all he has done and then adds perhaps they have been too harsh on Ridge by giving the CEO position to Steffy; perhaps that was too hasty. One thing she learned in S.F. is beyond all that bluster he is a very sensitive guy. He has hurt and betrayed Eric but he felt that rejection in return too. She says she has learned to accept Ridge and now she hopes the family can too. Eric asks how and she says perhaps a win/win situation with making peace in the family by bringing him and Ridge closer together. Just think about bringing Ridge in too as CEO. Liam waltzes Steffy around the floor and welcomes her home taking off her clothes and guiding her to the bed. She says this is nice but she still feels awful all the things she put him through. He says it was hard as he felt her slowly slipping away. She assures him she is never going to slip away from him again.",
