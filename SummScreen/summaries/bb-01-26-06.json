Eric tells her that they are doing this for Felicia's sake.\n\n\nIn another room, Felicia and Stephanie are together, while Felicia's doctor, checks her over.  She tells her doctor that she has been experiencing some pain, but she doesn't want to take anymore morphine or any other drugs.  She wants to be crystal clear at her parents wedding tonight.  Felicia tells her mother that she doesn't believe that her Dad will go back to Jackie; something wonderful will come out of this.\n\n\nJackie shows her engagement ring to Nick.  She is thrilled and, under the circumstances, doesn't mind waiting to be married.  Nick asks her what she is talking about and she tells him that she and Eric will wed later, after he marries Stephanie tonight.  Nick is shocked!  Nick, trying to protect his mother, tells her that Eric is not going to do that to her again.  \n\n\nFelicia offers her thanks to her doctor, for helping her get through all that she has had to contend with.  After he leaves, Stephanie questions Felicia about her pain.  She brushes it off and tells her mother, that she thinks after tonight, and when she is gone, that you and Dad are just going to run done and get this marriage thing undone.  Felicia tells her that it isn't going to happen.  \n\n\nFelicia greets Kristen with the rest of her brothers.  They are there to support Kristen and to be with Felicia also.  Felicia asks Kristen to help her get ready for the ceremony.  She especially needs help with her hair.  \n\n\nJackie tries to make Nick understand that she is okay with this, because it is being done for Felicia.  Besides, Eric doesn't want to say \"no\" to his daughter's request.  \n\n\nNick paid a visit to Eric.  He wanted him to call off the wedding, which Eric had no intentions of doing.  Eric tells Nick that he understands how he feels, but when he has a daughter of his own, he will understand how much something like this means.  \n\n\nNick then paid a visit to Felicia.  When he enters, he finds her on the floor and helps her up.  Felicia, wanting the night to be perfect, asks him about her hair, and when he tells her that it is cockeyed, whereupon Felicia breaks down to Nick.  She asks Nick to help her get ready, and he brings over a walker, hoping to steady her.  She refuses to use it, because she doesn't want to appear as a cripple.  Felicia asks him not to let anyone know what just happened and he agrees.\n\n\nAt the main house, the judge is prepared to start the wedding.  She is the last person to arrive and does so on Nick's arms.  He whispers to her to enjoy the evening and leaves.  Eric quietly thanks Nick for not saying anything.\n\n\n",
