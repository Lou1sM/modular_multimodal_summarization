    "tvmega_recap": "Nick spills coffee on his shirt and is changing when his secretary comes in, spies his St. Christopher medal, and remarks how pretty it is. It reminds him of Brooke who gave it to him and him saying that he will never take it off. Ridge and Brooke canoodle in his office and he confides that he overheard Rick and her talking last night. He knows that Rick still doesn't trust him and probably would rather that she be still with Nick. He ponders if he will have to prove himself all over again, the way he did with Brooke. Rick wastes no time in dropping in on Nick and accusing him of plotting his family's downfall. But admits that he would have done the very same thing Nick did. And he hands him a list of international employees that might be helpful to Nick. He vows he loves his mother just as much as Nick loves his and he's afraid it is only a matter of time before Ridge breaks her heart again and she and Stephanie will be going toe to toe. The gang at the new Forrester are excited about sketches and designs for the new line showing soon. Rick meets Phoebe who he barely recognizes since she has grown up. In speaking of Nick behind his back, Rick warns them not to underestimate him. That the more you challenge him, the more determined he is to beat you. Eric just wants to forget Nick and concentrate on his showing in two weeks. The Forrester's are coming back with a vengeance! Ridge states the only thing that could make it better is a big old wedding and an extended honeymoon. Nick gets the affirmative he wants from Harrison and buys his boutiques even though it was more money than he originally offered and Storm is worried that he has over-extended himself. Even Jackie is worried that he is building this on a house of cards, losing his perspective. Two weeks, Nick surmises, then the Forrester's will be crushed and destroyed.",
