    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Katie arrived at Eric's behest with a newspaper. He couldn't find where the paperboy had thrown his and had asked to borrow hers. Noticing a suitcase, she asked if he was going someplace. Flipping through the paper, Eric said it was a quick trip to Genoa City. He found what he wanted in the paper and groaned because what he'd heard was actually true. Apparently, Sally Spectra's old warehouse was scheduled for demolition.\n\n\nTo Eric, life had been interesting when Sally had been popping out from behind curtains. Eric flashed back on times with Sally, including the Queen Mary showing. Eric told Katie that it had been fun to be Sally's friend -- and her enemy. Katie asked what had happened to Sally and if she was \"still with us.\" Eric said Sally would live forever. The last he'd heard, hot cabana boys were tending to Sally on a tropical island.\n\n\nKatie wondered what Sally would think of Quinn and if the women would be friends. Eric said Sally's biggest asset was recognizing talent. It was something the women shared, and Eric revealed to Katie that Quinn had suggested -- despite her differences with Ridge -- that Eric promote Ridge back to the executive level of the company.\n\n\nEric explained that Steffy and Ridge would share the CEO position. Katie asked how it would work. Eric assumed the pair would work it out however they wanted -- unless Steffy balked at the idea. Katie thought Quinn would more likely suggest that Ridge be buried alive. Laughing, Eric said Katie had been skeptical about his idea to send the two on a trip, but Eric believed the trip had helped Ridge and Quinn realize they could work together.\n\n\nKatie said Eric could recycle her paper because she'd already read it. Eric stated that he'd use any excuse to get her to visit. She called him sweet and guessed he had to strategize. She knew Ridge had hurt Eric, but Ridge was still his son. Eric said the family had been slow to forgive Quinn for her misdeeds. He asked if he really wanted to do the same to them. Katie wished him safe travels, kissed his cheek, and left.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Thomas was surprised when Steffy ripped a check out of the checkbook and handed it to him. It was for rent at his loft. She assumed he paid Ridge rent, and she thought she'd pay, since she'd been there the previous month. Thomas said it was three times too much, and she asked how she was supposed to know.\n\n\nThomas quipped that asking would be a good start -- unless Steffy was just doing it to show off her CEO buying power or to remind him that he'd been passed over the last time promotions had been handed out. Steffy asked what his sudden problem with her was. Thomas relayed that he had an issue with being passed over and asked if his name had even been mentioned at promotion time. She replied that he hadn't been there.\n\n\nThomas sarcastically said he'd been off making a family with the broken one that their father had given him. He quipped that maybe he should have married Quinn's child so she'd fight to get a nameplate and CEO seat for him. Steffy said that their grandfather had offered her the position, so whether Thomas believed it or not, she'd earned it.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Thomas preferred that Quinn be CEO, because it would have happened if Steffy had declined. Thomas disagreed, saying that Eric would have offered it to Ridge, Rick, or Thorne. Steffy asserted that she'd asked about that before accepting. She reasoned that Thorne had a life outside of \"this building.\" As for Rick, he was running International and had a baby.\n\n\nThomas wondered why their father hadn't gotten the job. In his view, Ridge was more experienced, and despite Steffy's gazillion followers, Ridge was higher profile than any of them. Steffy didn't disagree but said the choice had been up to Eric. She said that time healed all wounds, but she didn't know about the betrayal between Ridge and Eric.\n\n\nThomas asked if Ridge betraying Eric was about Ridge refusing to suck up to Quinn or about Ridge not buying the \"whole brand-new me look.\" Steffy told Thomas to tell it to Eric and see where it got Thomas. Thomas was in sardonic awe of Steffy becoming quite the politician. Steffy stated that Quinn was a fact of life, and if recognizing Eric's commitment to Quinn made Steffy a traitor, it was fine with her because she was thinking about the family and its legacy.\n\n\nSteffy informed Thomas that she wasn't just keeping the company on an even keel. She was showing \"so much more\" growth when compared to the competitors. Thomas asked if that made \"all this\" okay. Steffy told Thomas to make up his mind -- either he was saying that she'd gotten the job because she was an opportunist or complaining that the job should have been his.\n\n\nThomas figured that Steffy would deride him for his statement, but he wanted to know why the position hadn't been first offered to Ridge's firstborn. \"Granddad seemed to give dad the -- the option, and uh, why not me?\" Thomas asked. Steffy replied that, first off, their father wasn't the same as his father, and the men were very different people.\n\n\nThomas noted that Quinn wanted her son to be the heir apparent, if only by marriage. Steffy acknowledged that Quinn had played a part in Steffy getting the position, but Steffy had kept it on her own. She cited that they were finally in a drama-free work environment, and they'd gotten Christmas bonuses. She said no one had a problem with her leadership but Thomas.\n\n\nThomas said he didn't want to interrupt Steffy from patting herself on the back, but she'd only been running the company for a month. Steffy asked if he was saying he could have done just as well. Thomas confirmed that he thought that. Steffy said he was wrong. She stated that the reason was that he wasn't there. Being in and out was a reoccurring theme with him. She concluded that designers could be temperamental, but CEO's couldn't. Thomas wordlessly exited.\n\n\nIn the design office, Quinn arrived as Ridge ended a call with Brooke. He said he'd be lying if he told Quinn that Brooke had sent greetings. Quinn asked how the wedding planning was going. Ridge stated that wedding planning was overrated, but Brooke would be back soon. Quinn informed Ridge that she'd done something and hoped he wouldn't be angry about it.\n\n\nQuinn guessed Ridge knew about Wyatt and Steffy's finalized divorce. \"The dreaded FL-190,\" Ridge said. Quinn joked that Ridge probably had a wall papered with them. She admitted that she was upset about it because she'd liked them together. It had spurred her zeal to keep them together. It had led her to urge Eric to offer Steffy the CEO position.\n\n\nRidge stated that Quinn had finally admitted it. Quinn didn't think she'd kept it a secret, but she believed that Steffy was capable and excelling. The problem was that Quinn felt she'd inadvertently shortchanged more experienced leadership. She informed Ridge that she'd asked Eric to consider having Ridge share CEO responsibilities with Steffy.\n\n\nRidge was surprised that Quinn had asked Eric to do it. Quinn replied that Eric had given her the \"I'm thinking about it\" face. Ridge asked why she'd pitch the black sheep of the family and noted that she didn't even like him. Shrugging, Quinn said she minded him a lot less those days.\n\n\nQuinn loved her husband and was leery of Eric returning to the daily grind at Forrester. Even though Steffy was a powerhouse, she was young, and Quinn believed the clientele would be more confident if a seasoned hand were at the wheel. Ridge reasoned that Eric and Quinn could travel, knowing that the business was in capable hands.\n\n\nQuinn stated that it was her family, too. She wanted good things for all of them. She'd once thought that Ridge was the most conceited man in the world, but she'd realized that he was only the second or third most. Ridge said it was sweet coming from the Wicked Witch of the West. Quinn smiled, and Ridge remarked that she had a nice smile.\n\n\nRidge was surprised by how Quinn was taking Wyatt and Steffy's divorce. \"Oh, I know, right? I should be burning down the hall of records,\" Quinn joked. She revealed that Ridge comparing her to his mother had made her decide that she didn't want Wyatt remembering her as an overbearing mother. She guessed she had Ridge to thank for the revelation.\n\n\nNicole arrived with a necklace prototype that Ivy had told Nicole to guard with her life. Quinn accepted the box, and Nicole left. Ridge asked for a look, and Quinn opened the box. \"A proper look,\" he clarified, lifting the necklace from the box. Ridge draped it around Quinn's neck, and she smiled, watching him in the mirror as he stood behind her, straightening the necklace.\n\n\nRidge was stroking Quinn's shoulders, too, as they both looked at the necklace through the mirror. He said the jewelry was perfectly balanced. She remarked that the stones shouldn't go together. He stated that she'd known they would. Agreeing, she said it was the mismatch and the antagonism. Stroking the jewels, Ridge said the stones were misfits but fit perfectly.\n\n\nAs Ridge removed the necklace, Quinn warned him to be careful. He dismissively said he knew how to treat a lady. Caught off guard, Quinn couldn't recall if she'd been called a lady before. She added that she had, however, been called derogatory names for a woman. \"By me,\" Ridge said. \"By you,\" she echoed.\n\n\nQuinn changed the subject to Eric going to Genoa City that night, if the weather held up. She remarked that the doctor had finally cleared Eric to fly. She knew that Eric was lamenting the loss of his closeness with Ridge. She advised Ridge to go to Eric because the two might be able to say things to each other that they hadn't been able to before.\n\n\nRidge thanked Quinn for going to bat for him. As Quinn left, he handed her the necklace box that she'd seemed to forget. Their hands touched, and they exchanged glances before she exited.\n\n\nSometime later, Quinn returned to the vacant office. Looking at the necklace, she thought of how Ridge had said the misfit stones fit perfectly together.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Eric realized that he wasn't alone when, while placing something on his suitcase in the foyer, he heard Ridge say that Genoa City was cold that time of year. Ridge asked what the trip entailed. Eric didn't really know. Lauren Fenmore had called, and cross-promotions had been a topic of conversation. Ridge stated that the doctor had approved Eric to fly, and Lauren had always been a pull for Eric.\n\n\nEric offered to have a sit-down with Ridge once Eric was back. Ridge said he'd like that, and they hadn't done so in a while. Eric stated that he might have been too harsh on Ridge. Ridge replied that he'd given Eric reasons to be, and Eric agreed. Ridge said he hadn't been grabbing for power. He'd been trying to protect Eric and the family. Eric didn't like being estranged from Ridge.\n\n\nRidge said he'd gotten obnoxious in trying to save Eric from himself. Ridge blamed it on Stephanie's side of the family, but Eric decided he couldn't blame Stephanie for everything. Eric revealed that when he returned, he wanted to find a more appropriate position for Ridge on the leadership team. Ridge said it was a conversation he'd like to have. Eric told him to thank Quinn for it. Ridge said that there was something Eric should know.\n\n\nRidge stated that he loved and respected Eric more than anyone in the world. He told Eric to have a safe trip. Eric left, and Ridge stared at Quinn's portrait on the wall. He rolled his eyes at his thoughts, and he sighed in frustration.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Eric reads in the newspaper about the old Spectra building being demolished which prompts him to take a stroll down memory lane and to reflect on his long and complex relationship with the great Sally Spectra. Katie arrives and is very surprised when she learns about Quinn and Ridge's sudden friendship. Meanwhile, Quinn informs Ridge about her proposition to Eric. Ridge is touched by Quinn's gesture. Later, Ridge pays his father a cordial visit just before Eric leaves on a short trip to Genoa City while Quinn flashes back to a tender moment with Ridge. As Steffy gushes about her new position as CEO of Forrester Creations, she soon finds out that Thomas feels offended that he was not even considered for the job. Steffy informs her brother that she is of the opinion that she has earned her position.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Clearly things are not all that great with Thomas as he makes a snarky remark to Steffy about him being passed over for CEO. He wonders if his name was even mentioned when it was handed out. Steffy says she earned the position as her grandfather gave it to her. And if it had not been her, then it would be Quinn. The Foresters came before them and they will after them. Katie stops by to return something to Eric and he tells her the old district where Sally used to work is being razed. The last he heard of Sally she was lolling around, sipping rum out of her coconut attended to by hot and cold cabana boys. Quinn speaks with Ridge and says she hopes she did not overstep but she went to Eric last night and wants to offer the company more experience by naming him a Co- CEO. He wonders why she would do that. She says she minds him a lot less these days. Eric's health is improving but she is afraid of him coming back to work so she would like another seasoned hand at the wheel. She wants them all to get along. She used to think he was the most conceited man in the world. Now maybe that is only the second or third. She mentions Wyatt. She does not want him to remember her as the mother who was overbearing so she is willing to be better too. Nicole brings in a tray of Quinn's jewelry and Ridge wants to properly place one around her neck to take a better look. He says the stones are misfits but they complement each other nicely. Quinn confides in Ridge that the doctor gave Eric permission to fly now and he is making a one night flight to Genoa City. Their hands touch and linger when he hands back her jewelry tray. He goes to see Eric and asks what this trip is about. He says Lauren Fenmore wants him to come. When he comes back he'd like to take some time to sit down and talk. He feels like he may have been a little harsh on Ridge. He does not like them being estranged, distant and disappointed. He'd like to re-assess his position in the company. He can thank Quinn for that. Ridge says more than anyone else in this world he loves and respects Eric so have a safe trip. He then stares at the portrait of Quinn above the fireplace.",
