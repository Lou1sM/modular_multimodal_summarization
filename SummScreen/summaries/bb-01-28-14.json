Wyatt wondered if Hope was happy. Hope said she was very happy and wanted more of everything. Wyatt promised to deliver, and he agreed that he had never been happier.\n\n\nHope recalled that she hadn't been sure about Wyatt in the beginning. She said that he had kissed her in Liam's house. Wyatt admitted that he had been extremely jealous of Liam. Hope was happy that Wyatt had been honest. She said she was happy and proud to be with Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt told Hope that she was insanely sexy, and he suggested that they didn't have to go anywhere. He said they could return to the trailer, but Hope objected. She said they were on a road trip. \"Let's hit the road,\" Hope said.\n\n\nLater, outside the trailer, Wyatt looked at a bracelet. Wyatt called to Hope. Inside the trailer, Hope saw Wyatt's sword necklace sitting on a table. She picked it up and carried it outside. Wyatt put his necklace back on. He suggested they should have at least one adventure a month. They giggled.\n\n\nWyatt added that he didn't want to return to Los Angeles because he liked having Hope all to himself. He said they were away from all the drama. There were no ex-boyfriends or mothers -- nothing but sand, surf, and open road.  Wyatt said that in honor of their stay in Emerald Bay, he had made green cocktails. They toasted and kissed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Pam and Charlie discussed that Quinn had tried to win Pam over so that Pam would persuade Charlie to hide the truth about Wyatt stealing the diamond. Pam told Charlie that she had pretended to be Quinn's best friend. Pam insisted they had to go see Liam and tell him the truth.\n\n\nIn another Forrester office, Caroline worked with models, and Carter, Rick, and Ridge watched. Ridge offered a suggestion on one of the dresses, and he added that it maintained Caroline's edgy and youthful design but added some Forrester couture. One of the models called Ridge a genius. Caroline liked the idea, but Rick disagreed.\n\n\nCaroline interrupted and said that Ridge's recommendation was a good one. The models and Caroline left, and Carter noted that the models had been enamored with Ridge. Rick and Ridge argued, and Carter took it as a cue to exit, but Ridge said he needed to talk to Carter later.\n\n\nRick quizzed Ridge about his feelings for Brooke. Ridge admitted that he had rejected Brooke's marriage proposal. Rick wondered what had happened because Ridge had always forgiven Brooke before for things she had done. \"Is there someone else?\" Rick asked.\n\n\nRidge said that he was reluctant to commit to any woman, and he had a hard time dealing with what Brooke had done to Katie. Rick worried that Ridge was hurting his mother, but Ridge said he needed time.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam thought about happier times with Hope. Pam and Charlie interrupted, and Charlie confessed that Quinn had persuaded Charlie to be quiet about the surveillance video. Charlie admitted to Liam that Quinn had threatened Charlie. Charlie had copied the video onto his phone, and he showed it to Liam. Liam watched the video that revealed Wyatt had stolen the diamond.\n\n\nPam said that she would have told Liam the truth, but she had just found out. Liam said he was happy to have proof. He planned to send it to Hope. Liam called Caroline to see if she had overheard where Wyatt and Hope had gone. Caroline shared that Wyatt and Hope had gone south on the Pacific Coast Highway and had mentioned a surfing safari. Liam checked out sites online on his computer, and he surmised that Wyatt and Hope might have gone to Emerald Bay.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Brooke thanked Katie for her support and her encouragement of Ridge to marry Brooke. Katie suggested that Brooke had to be patient. Brooke admitted that she had been embarrassed that Ridge had rejected her offer. Brooke wondered why Ridge had refused to reunite with her. Katie said that Ridge couldn't accept what Brooke and Bill had done.\n\n\nBrooke admitted that her relationship with Bill had been the worst mistake of her life. Brooke wondered if Ridge had met someone else, but Katie doubted it.\n\n\nBrooke said she worried about Katie, who lived all alone in a big house. Katie said she was fine, and she added that Katie and Bill would not reunite. Brooke noted that Katie had been very loyal to Bill, and he had been Katie's true love. Brooke lamented her own history of falling in love so many times.\n\n\nBrooke noted that Katie had a poetry book, and Brooke remembered that Katie had loved poetry in her youth. Katie said she had always enjoyed it and had rediscovered it. Brooke advised Katie to enjoy it because it made her feel good. \"Never let it go,\" Brooke suggested. Katie held her poetry book and looked thoughtful. At Forrester, Ridge looked at a similar book of poetry. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope tells Wyatt that she doesn't want to take anything back; she wants more of it all. He says he is the happiest he has ever been, all because of her. He admits he wasn't very nice to Liam when they met. He had no excuse but there is a reason. He was so jealous he could not see straight. Liam had her and he wanted her, that's all he's got. She says he has redeemed himself. She's proud to be with him. Pam tells Charlie that it just fries her cookie when someone assumes she is an airhead. She loved how Quinn was fawning all over her at lunch and wanting to be her BFF. She saw right through her little scheme. Quinn bet on the wrong pony this time. They are going to go see Liam. Brooke drops in on Katie and thanks her for supporting her when she asked Ridge to marry her. He's very disillusioned and needs more time to absolve what happened with Bill. Katie says they always wind up back together so it will happen. But this does not mean she will get back with Bill; too much damage done. She says she is not looking for a man to fill the spaces. She is enjoying her independent life. Brooke notices the poetry books and says that is good for the soul. She needs to hang on to that and embrace it. Ridge makes a few changes on the models and Rick takes offense that this is not Ridge's line. And Rick does not want HFTF to look couture. They even get into words over the way Ridge is rejecting Brooke. Ridge says he is having a hard time over what happened with Bill. Rick points out that Ridge has always forgiven her before. It's as if there is something else he is not saying. Liam is still trying to track Hope down when Charlie and Pam come to his office. Pam tells Liam to go easy on Charlie, but Liam was right, Wyatt stole the diamond. Charlie admits that he lied about the footage not showing anything as Quinn had threatened him that he would lose his job and Hope would be very unhappy. Charlie says he is sorry; all of this is his fault. Liam says no, he knew all along Wyatt was involved. Now he needs to get this information to Hope. He calls Caroline who did actually see Hope and Wyatt leave. All she knows and tells Liam is they went South on PCH, something about a Surfing Safari. Wyatt tells Hope that he doesn't want to go back. He likes her here all to himself with no ex boyfriend or mothers, just the road. It doesn't get better than this.",
