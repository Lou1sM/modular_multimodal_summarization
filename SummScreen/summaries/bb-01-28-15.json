Liam said there was a buzz in the building that everyone had welcomed her back.\n\n\nLiam noted that he didn't want anything awkward between them because he had been named president and she had been named vice president. Liam respected that Katie had at one time been CEO. Katie said that she was happy for Liam.\n\n\nLiam proudly announced that Bill had reinstated some of Katie's initiatives, and he added that he hoped Bill and Katie would work things out on a personal level as well. Liam teased that Katie could do a lot better than Bill, but she had made Bill a better person. Katie did not want to get her hopes up about a future with Bill. Liam said he felt Bill had been humbled.\n\n\nKatie said she would stay open to whatever headed her way. She changed the subject to Liam and Ivy. Katie wondered if Liam and Ivy had taken their relationship to the next level, and Liam laughed. He said that he had been very lucky to meet Ivy. He complimented Ivy's personality and her beauty and said he had a future with Ivy.\n\n\nKatie admitted that she had been a fan of Liam and Hope, but she recognized that Hope had left for Italy, and Liam reminded her that Hope was still married to his brother. \"I'm glad you're moving on,\" Katie said.\n\n\nLiam returned the conversation to Katie and Bill. Katie dished that Bill could be very charming when he wanted something. \"I have to be grateful to Brooke for stepping away and giving us the space to rediscover each other,\" Katie said. She hoped she and Bill could become a family again with Will.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Deacon offered to grab breakfast for them, but Quinn said she was too busy. Deacon tried to romance Quinn, but she was distracted. Deacon asked what was wrong. Quinn answered that she was worried about Brooke's return.\n\n\nDeacon teased that Quinn was jealous. Quinn scoffed, but he had clearly hit a nerve. Deacon reminded Quinn that he was not with Brooke, but Quinn noted that he and Brooke shared a very sordid past. Quinn quizzed Deacon about his past with Brooke.\n\n\nDeacon tried to minimize his relationship as an affair that had resulted in the birth of Hope. Quinn reminded Deacon that he had been married to Brooke's daughter when he'd had a hot and heavy affair with Brooke.\n\n\nQuinn called Brooke a glamorous, successful sex symbol, \"if you like blondes,\" she said. Quinn added that Brooke had been at the center of many scandals. Deacon agreed, but he added that he was with Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn announced that there was big news at Spencer with Liam as president and Katie as vice president. Quinn noted that if Bill returned to Katie, it left Brooke without a man.\n\n\nDeacon wondered why Quinn was worried about Brooke. He wondered if she was insecure. Quinn scoffed, but Deacon knew she was concerned. Deacon promised that he wouldn't leave her. He called her adorable, and Quinn told Deacon to stop being so confident, or she would throw something at him.\n\n\nQuinn reminded Deacon that not so long before, she had thought Bill would return to her and Deacon would end up with Brooke. \"Baby, I'm not interested in Brooke,\" Deacon said. He promised to share his life with Quinn. Quinn caressed Deacon's face, and they kissed.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, she recalled romantic moments with Bill on a balloon ride, in Europe, on a boat ride, in his helicopter, riding through Abu Dhabi in a convertible, and their wedding. She smiled as she flashed back through all the memories.\n\n\nBrooke remembered when she had told Katie that she was leaving Los Angeles to give Bill and Katie a chance to be together. She flashed back to Katie's skepticism because Katie was in love with Ridge. Brooke had reminded Katie that Will would have the chance for his parents to be together. \"I want Ridge,\" Katie had said. Brooke remembered that she had promised to take herself out of the equation and give Bill and Katie one more chance.\n\n\nBrooke looked thoughtful as she remembered her last visit with Katie, but her flashbacks were interrupted when her doorbell rang. She opened the door to Bill. Brooke wondered how Bill had heard she'd returned. Bill confessed that he'd been keeping tabs on her.\n\n\n\"Seeing you like this -- I can't tell you how it makes me feel,\" Bill said. He confessed that it did something to him seeing her pretty blonde hair and her beautiful green eyes. Bill noted that he had texted, called, and emailed while she'd been gone, but she had never responded.\n\n\nBrooke halfheartedly apologized and said that she'd been really immersed in her work, and she'd dealt with Hope. Brooke admitted that she didn't think Hope had fully dealt with the loss of her child, and she didn't know if Hope and Wyatt would be able to save their marriage.\n\n\nBill said he'd been glad to learn that Brooke had returned, and he had looked forward to seeing her again because he wanted to tell her how he felt. \"You walked out on me,\" Bill said bitterly.\n\n\nBrooke said she didn't know what to say. \"Did you ever think about us?\" Bill wondered. He asked if she had recalled how much they'd felt for each other and how much he had loved her.\n\n\nBill said he had been blind. \"Everyone warned me about you, and look where it got me. You turned your back on us. I am done fighting for you. What I want is my family and to spend the rest of my life with your sister,\" he said. Brooke looked calm.\n\n\nBill admitted that he had hurt Katie terribly, but he would make it up to her. Brooke was happy for Bill. She said that she had known she frustrated him, but it had all worked out in the end.\n\n\nBrooke said that she had become a better person, and Bill would be there for his son. \"You and your family have a new beginning,\" Brooke said. She added that they would lock their memories away forever. Bill nodded and left. Brooke tearfully watched him leave. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke is at home reflecting back on happier times with Bill when he shows up at the door. She wonders how he knew she was back. He muses that he has been keeping tabs on her. It has been too long but he has been waiting for her return. She says she is sorry that she intended to let everyone know. Katie goes to the office and Liam welcomes her back and says the whole building is abuzz with her return. She's happy that he is President and her VP, she would not have it any other way. He earned it. He says Bill practically begged her to come back and Bill begs no one. She agrees and says he is even reinstalling some of her initiatives like childcare and will move on from there. He thinks it is great that they will see more of Will around here, a nice happy family. And he does put his stamp of approval of them being a family again. She's back at work for Spencer, she's getting back with Bill. Things are looking up around here. Katie smiles but says she does not want to get her hopes up; she does not want anyone to get their hopes up. Deacon tries to convince a morose Quinn to go out for breakfast. She is not in the mood although he thought she was hungry, perhaps hungry for something else and that will suit him too. He says he is always down for another round. Then she says she has lost her appetite for sure. He says he knows her so well so what's up with her, what gives. She finally says Brooke. She is back in town and she is just wondering how all of this will play out with her and whoever. Deacon finds it amusing that Quinn seems to be jealous. He assures her that he is not with Brooke. He's with Quinn. She says she knows but he does have a child with Brooke and a very sordid past from what she knows. He admits they hooked up, things got hot and heavy, Brooke got pregnant, had Hope and that was the end. Quinn says she will not let him do that, wrap it up in a pretty little package and put a bow on it. She knows Brooke is legendary and some people may call her a sex symbol if you like blondes and she has been known to be in the center of many a scandal. Deacon says yes she has been known to follow her heart. Quinn continues that she had a child, his precious Hope, with her son-in-law and then got involved with her sister's husband. He says in Brooke's defense she did leave town trying to give Bill and Katie a chance and it looks like that is coming true. Deacon asks Quinn if she is not sure she is a little insecure now that Brooke is back in town. After all, he is her man now and he knows she would not like her to make any moves on him. He thinks it is adorable that she is jealous. She threatens to throw something at his head. She says Katie is with Bill or trying to get back with him so that leaves Brooke with no man. He tells her to stop that right now. He is not interested in Brooke nor her with him, that was in the past and he's all about the future. He assures her that he is all about the person he is sharing a life with right now. Liam jokes with Katie that she could do much better than Bill but she is so good for him. He doesn't fire as many people now, he doesn't scream and he doesn't call Liam at four in the morning asking why he's not at the office yet. He tells her since Brooke left, his dad has been single for the first times in years and he thinks it has humbled him. Katie admits that she likes the way they are connecting now. It feels good. She does not know what is gonna happen but she will try to stay open to whatever comes her way. She asks about him and Ivy and if they have taken it to the next level. He admits they have and she has her own toothbrush at his house. She cajoles next thing she will have drawer space and even a closet. He said he got lucky. She says she thinks Ivy is cool. She was a fan of Hope's but she is in Italy. Liam adds and still married to his brother. She admits it is time for him to move on. Brooke explains to Bill that she was immersed in her work and then Hope came. She's not sure she and Wyatt can work this out and be together. Bill says he is glad she is back. He has been looking forward to this moment. She left him; she walked out on him. She says she was only trying to do the right thing. Bill says he does not need her apology. He's glad she did not contact him and left him alone with his memories. Everybody tried to warn him how Brooke was. He did not want to believe it and look where it got him. They had it all but she turned her back on him. She says she had to. He argues no she didn't, but he's done fighting for her. He doesn't want that anymore. He wants his family and to spend the rest of his life with her sister. He knows before he made a lot of mistakes with Katie. He hurt her terribly and he regrets that but he is going to do everything in his power to win her back and reunite their family. Brooke says good, that is all she ever wanted. She says she knows his frustration with her and perhaps she could have handled this better. But it all worked out in the end. She's a better person for this. She had to take herself out of the equation. It wasn't right to come between him, Katie and his child. She is not unburdening herself, but it is a new beginning. And all the memories he asked about that they shared will be locked away forever.",
