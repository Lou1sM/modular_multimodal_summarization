    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Pam, Charlie and Liam tried to figure out where Wyatt and Hope had gone. Charlie and Liam figured it was Emerald Bay because Quinn's focus for her new collection was emeralds, and Liam remembered that Wyatt had warned that Liam would be \"green with envy\" when he heard where Wyatt and Hope had gone.\n\n\nLiam headed out the door, and Charlie and Pam wished him luck with Hope. After Liam left, Charlie wished he had told Liam about Wyatt earlier. Pam said that Wyatt should have known better than to try such a stunt. Pam claimed that Hope would be disgusted with Wyatt's actions, and Pam anticipated that Liam and Hope would get back together.\n\n\nCharlie guessed that Wyatt would be seeing more colors than emerald. Charlie believed that Liam would show Wyatt some black and blue.\n\n\nIn his car, Liam angrily counted down the miles on his way to Emerald Bay. Liam called Hope, but her phone went to voicemail.\n\n\nAt the trailer at Emerald Bay, Wyatt and Hope sat outside near the beach, drinking emerald cocktails. Hope nuzzled with Wyatt and told him that he had proven himself to her in all the ways that really counted.\n\n\nWyatt said that the trip had a theme with Emerald Bay and emerald cocktails. They toasted and kissed.  Wyatt and Hope discussed how much fun they'd had together. Wyatt said he had a surprise for her. He asked her to close her eyes. He opened the jewelry box with the emerald bracelet he had looked at the previous day.  Hope opened her eyes, saw the jewelry box, and put on the emerald bracelet.\n\n\nHope tied the emerald cocktails, Emerald Bay, and emerald jewelry all together. Hope teased that it was good to have a jeweler as a boyfriend. Wyatt noted that they were officially a couple. Hope smiled, and they made out. Suddenly, Liam showed up and interrupted.  \"Game over, Wyatt. Rock and roll,\" Liam ordered. Wyatt looked angry, and Hope was surprised.\n\n\nAt Liam's place, Brooke stopped in to see Bill, who was shirtless and sweaty after he had worked out. Brooke asked him to put on a shirt. Bill teased that Brooke was afraid she couldn't control herself.\n\n\nBrooke ignored him and asked about the last time Bill had seen Katie. Bill wondered if something had happened. Brooke shared that she had seen Katie, and Katie had generously encouraged Ridge to get back together with Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke urged Bill to see Katie. Bill quizzed Brooke about Ridge, and Brooke had to admit that Ridge had not accepted her marriage proposal. Bill scoffed that Ridge was not interested. \"Ridge and I are fine,\" Brooke seethed.\n\n\nBrooke urged Bill to get his marriage back on track with his wife, Katie. Bill maintained that Katie had stopped being his wife a long time before. Bill admitted that he and Katie shared a son and a lifelong bond, but Bill's feelings toward Katie had not changed. \"I want you -- not your sister,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill wondered how long Brooke intended to wait around for Ridge when he had already refused her proposal. Bill wondered if Ridge had been interested in someone else. Brooke looked skeptical. Bill suggested that while Ridge had been in Paris, he could have had several relationships. Bill noted that Ridge had always been known as a ladies' man and could have had a fling or two -- or something more serious.\n\n\n\"Maybe he feels guilty for being unfaithful to you,\" Bill said.\n\n\n\"That's beneath you, Bill,\" Brooke said. Brooke left. Bill called Justin and asked him to find out what Ridge had done while he had been in France. Bill predicted that Ridge had been involved with someone or a string of someones. Bill ordered Justin to get everything he could on Ridge.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt asks Hope if she noticed \u0096 emerald drinks, Emerald Bay. She got it. Charlie says call him wacky but he thinks Emerald Bay may be their destination as emeralds is the focus of Quinn's latest collection. Liam says it is all making sense now. Brooke drops in at Liam's to see Bill. He feels a lecture coming on. She asks when did he see Katie last. He's not sure what she is getting at. She tells him she was just there this afternoon when she asked Ridge to marry her. Bill finds that funny. But he's not getting back with Katie and he's not giving up on Brooke either. He tells her just be glad that the hypocrite turned her down. He has one set of standards for himself and another whole less forgiving set for Brooke. She's too good for him and deserves better. Kick that loser to the curb and don't look back. He might be interested in something else anyway. He's certainly not a saint and he might have a whole other life in Paris that Brooke knows nothing about. She says she has complete faith in Ridge so she doesn't have to ask him anything. Afterwards Bill calls Justin and tells him to dig up what he can on Ridge Forrester ASAP. He has a lot riding on this. He wants to know everything he did in Paris. Liam is high-tailing it out of town on PCH and clearly he has mud in his eyes. Charlie tells Pam that the security footage is on it's way to Liam. Pam tells Charlie not to feel guilty about this. It's all on Wyatt and Morticia. This ain't gonna fly with Hope as she values honesty above all else. Charlie says Liam is so gonna bust Wyatt and show Hope the real Wyatt. And he hopes Liam introduces Wyatt to two more colors \u0096 black and blue. They look at the display of emeralds that Quinn is working with. Pam says Wyatt used Charlie and when Liam is done with him she has a few choice words for Wyatt as well. Wyatt has another surprise for Hope. He gives her a lovely emerald bracelet. She loves it. He says they just took a big step in their relationship .she says Emerald bracelet, Emerald Bay, Diamondhead .she is beginning to see a trend here. It might be really good having a jeweler as a boyfriend. Wyatt says he guesses they are now officially a couple. She gives him a kiss. Liam darkens the door to the trailer and tells Wyatt game over.",
