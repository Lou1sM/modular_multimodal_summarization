After the ceremony, the kids see how much fun Eric and Stephanie are having dancing.\n\n\nHector stops in to see Taylor while she is moving out of her office at Forrester.  She tells him since her marriage is over with Ridge she thinks it is better for her not to be working there anymore.  She tells him Ridge only married her to please his mother.  She reminisces about when she went to St. Thomas years ago trying to escape Ridge and how he followed her there, proposed to her, and swept her off her feet.

Taylor tells Hector how deep down she always felt like Ridge and her were not right for each other.
