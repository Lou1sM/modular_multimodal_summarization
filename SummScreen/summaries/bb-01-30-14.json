Pam scoffed and exclaimed that Wyatt was the problem. \"He is not the hero!\" Pam yelled.\n\n\nRick asked what Pam's problem was with Wyatt, and Pam replied that Wyatt had hoodwinked them. She asked if Rick wanted to know about the scam of the century, and she showed Rick the video of Wyatt stealing the diamond.\n\n\nRick began to fume as he realized that Wyatt had orchestrated the whole robbery. Pam stated that there was a fox in the henhouse, and any respected farmer would get rid of the fox. \"And that fox is on a beach somewhere with my sister,\" Rick replied.\n\n\nAt Emerald Bay, Hope asked how Liam had found her and Wyatt, and Wyatt asked Liam to leave. Liam said he'd be going, and Hope would, too, after she heard what he had to say. Wyatt said that he wasn't going to let Liam have another minute alone with Hope, but Liam quipped that he wanted Wyatt to be there for every second of it.\n\n\nLiam stated that there was something Hope needed to know about Wyatt and a certain jewelry heist. Wyatt decided that he and Hope were going for a walk, but Liam stated that he had a video to show Hope from the boutique surveillance camera the day of the robbery. Wyatt exclaimed that it was insane, and Liam agreed that it had been insane.\n\n\nLiam showed Hope the video and asked her to watch the mirror in it. Hope watched but became confused. Liam played it for her a second time in slow motion. She asked Wyatt what was going on. \"What does it look like? He stole your diamond,\" Liam declared.\n\n\nHope asked if Liam was telling her that the thieves hadn't been real. Wyatt claimed that they had been -- guns and all. \"But they didn't steal the diamond, did they?\" Liam asked. Liam accused Wyatt of faking the diamond heist for publicity when a couple of bad guys had just happened to arrive. Liam figured the thieves had made Wyatt's job easier because Wyatt had been able to make them the culprits.\n\n\nHope asked Wyatt to tell her that it hadn't happened.  Wyatt looked away, and Hope exclaimed that two people were in jail for something they didn't do. Wyatt replied that the men were actual jewel thieves, but Hope exclaimed that they weren't guilty of a crime at the boutique. Wyatt asked Liam to give Wyatt and Hope a minute, but Liam replied that Wyatt's time was up.\n\n\nHope pleaded with Liam for time with Wyatt, and Liam quietly walked to the opposite side of the trailer. There Liam received a phone call from Rick, who asked if Liam was with Hope. Liam guessed Rick had heard about Wyatt, and agreeing, Rick asked to speak to Hope. Liam said Hope was with Wyatt, and Liam suspected that she was breaking up with Wyatt. \"At least I hope she is,\" Liam added.\n\n\nBack on the other side of the trailer, Hope asked Wyatt how he could have done it. She said he'd made a mockery out of everything she stood for in one stupid move, and all the publicity they'd gotten had been based upon a lie. Wyatt told her not to blow it out of portion, but she asked if he still hadn't figured out who she was after all that time.\n\n\nHope wondered if her life was a big joke to Wyatt, and she grew tearful as she said that she'd believed in him. \"I started to believe in us!\" she exclaimed. Hope couldn't believe that she'd stuck her neck out for him and his mother. \"I gave myself to you, and you gave me a lie!\" Hope yelled.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Ridge was eating with Brooke but thinking about Katie. Brooke apologized for putting him on the spot at Katie's house the other day. Ridge said he loved Brooke's impulsiveness, but Brooke said it had all been good until she'd crossed the line with her sister's husband.\n\n\nRidge explained that he wasn't judging Brooke because they'd both made mistakes. Brooke asked when he'd get over her mistakes. Ridge stated that her actions had changed his perspective on things. She said it felt as if they had just met, and Ridge figured it was the year they'd spent apart.\n\n\nBrooke asked what Ridge had done with all that time, and Ridge asked if she were writing a book. She remarked that he seemed different. He said it hadn't been the time away; it had been the bombshells that had been thrown at him. \"It's not like we haven't dealt with this before, right?\" he said.\n\n\nJust then, Ridge and Brooke spotted Katie and Caroline entering the restaurant. Brooke asked if Ridge wanted to invite the ladies over, but he declined.  Brooke said it was good because she wanted alone time with Ridge. Brooke and Ridge agreed that Katie had a lot of loyalty and integrity. Brooke added that Katie wanted her family together. \"And so do I,\" Brooke added.\n\n\nBrooke said Katie was starting to forgive her, and Ridge could, too. Ridge remarked that it wasn't that simple, but she replied that in the past, they'd been able to get through things. Ridge asked if that was supposed to be their legacy, and Brooke asked him if they'd lost what they'd had.\n\n\nBrooke said that being with Ridge at the table reminded her of the past. \"Makeup dinners,\" Ridge replied, and she recalled that most of the dinners had ended up in the bedroom. Ridge replied that he'd never been able to resist her. Brooke stated that, even though he needed space, it was important to move things along a bit. \"We could try again,\" she uttered.\n\n\nRidge noted that the bedroom had always been sacred for them. Brooke replied that it could be again, but Ridge disagreed because of Bill. She acknowledged that it was harder for Ridge than she'd thought it would be. \"Yeah, it is,\" he replied and sneaked a look at Katie.\n\n\nAt Caroline and Katie's table, Caroline noted that Brooke and Ridge were across the room and asked if Katie wanted to go somewhere else. \"Of course not,\" Katie awkwardly replied.\n\n\nKatie changed the subject to Caroline and Rick, but Caroline was sure Katie didn't want to hear about marital bliss. Katie responded that she was happy for Caroline, and Caroline expressed that she feared that it would be over once Rick saw her without makeup. Katie responded that it wouldn't happen with the right guy, and she sneaked a look at Ridge.\n\n\nCaroline cooed about working with Ridge earlier that day. She said he was very talented and not hard on the eyes. She thought Brooke had been lucky to have him all those years. Katie stated that everyone said Brooke and Ridge belonged together. Caroline exclaimed that they were legendary, and she couldn't imagine anyone with Ridge but Brooke.\n\n\nCaroline remarked that people were saying that Ridge was different, and she wondered if Katie agreed with that. Katie said she'd seen a different side of him, and then she frowned, watching Brooke play footsie with Ridge beneath the table across the room.\n\n\nCaroline asked if Katie was okay, and Katie refocused on her meal. Caroline guessed that Katie was deep in thought about work, but Katie said that she'd had other things on her mind.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Justin and Bill discussed putting detectives on the hunt for information about Ridge in Paris. Justin said that Ridge had maintained a low profile overseas, but Bill was sure they'd find something. Bill declared that once they did find something, Brooke would be his again.\n\n\nJustin warned that Brooke might hold Bill's fact-finding mission against him, but Bill doubted that. Bill felt that Brooke only wanted Ridge because she was pushing Bill toward Katie. Justin asked if Bill was over Katie. Bill replied that he'd never be completely over her, but he loved Brooke and wanted Brooke as his wife.\n\n\nJustin hoped it worked for his sake and Bill's. Bill acknowledged that things had to be hard for Justin at Spencer. Justin said he'd been totally marginalized. Bill told Justin to hang in there, and if they could expose Ridge, things would get better.\n\n\nJustin scanned the French tabloids but found nothing. Bill told Justin to keep at it. After a while, Justin did uncover something. Bill returned to the room, and Justin showed off his find. \"Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?\" Bill asked, staring at the computer in shock. \n\n\n",
