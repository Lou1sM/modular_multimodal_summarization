In  an effort to appear more family oriented, Ridge decides to change into a more \"paternal\" shirt before Rick arrives.  When  Phoebe gets  there Ridge is relieved, hoping she will make a good buffer between him and Rick. Before they get a chance to talk, Rick comes in kinda drunk with a bloody nose. Brooke questions him, and he sarcastically replies that he was just at a \"lecture\" at a biker bar.  Later while they are having dinner, Rick explains that he got into a fight with a guy  about politics. Ridge steers the conversation back to business by reminding Rick to keep in touch with all their former European employees so they can hire them back when the time is right. Rick informs Ridge that it's too late for that since most of them  couldn't afford to wait around and now they work for Nick. With the mention of Nick's name, Ridge remembers Hope telling him that Nick stopped by earlier.  He asks Brooke what they talked about.  Rick angrily steps in, telling Ridge to butt out because he thinks there is probably some unfinished business between his mother and Nick. Then Rick boldly asks his mother why she  and Nick split up.  Refusing to tell him the reason, Ridge only offers that it was Nick's fault. Brooke attempts to get them to settle down, but Rick will have no part of  it and storms out.  Phoebe goes  after Rick, to try to calm him down. When they are alone, Ridge tells Brooke that he thinks they should tell Rick that Nick cheated on her  with  Bridget.  However,  Brooke adamantly disagrees, stating she and Bridget  deserve a little peace. Ridge understands how she feels  and promises to keep quite and wait  patiently until Rick is ready to get to know him again. \n\n\nOutside of Brooke's, Rick apologizes to Phoebe for being such an ass.  Phoebe  admits she doesn't know what went wrong with Nick and Brooke's marriage, but she believes Brooke loves Ridge now. Rick isn't convinced of his mother's feelings.  Trying to lighten the mood, Phoebe jokes that he should stop picking on Ridge and find a new way to make everyone miserable. Later things take a romantic turn when  Rick and Phoebe lay down on the ground and stare up at the stars.  Rick points out the big dipper, saying how different  it  looks from America.  When  Phoebe fails to see the dipper part, Rick  moves his head really close to hers  and points it out.  Phoebe doesn't understand what the big fuss is over it.  They laugh and flirtatiously begin making their own constellations calling one group of stars the \"Big Zipper\" and another the \"Big Stripper.\" \n\n\nMeanwhile, back in Brooke's house, Ridge tries to get  Brooke to come to bed, and she promises to come as soon  as she cleans up. Ridge asks her where Phoebe is and she tells him she is still out with Rick.  Curious, Brooke goes onto the deck to see what they are up to.  She smiles when she sees them  lying on the ground staring up at the stars, not realizing that it could be the beginning of something not so innocent. \n\n\nAt the Forresters', after dinner Pam and Eric get cozy by the fire.
