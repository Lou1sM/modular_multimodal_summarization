    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Eric, Quinn, and Ridge met to discuss Eric's trip to Genoa City to invest in Fenmore's. Eric said it had gone well, and Lauren couldn't wait to meet Quinn. Quinn beamed.\n\n\n\nRidge wondered what Eric had decided about the CEO position. Eric agreed Ridge should be co-CEO with Steffy. \"My wife is always thinking of ideas,\" Eric said. Quinn added that it was important to put all of their mistakes, misunderstandings, and tensions behind them. Ridge wondered if Eric was going to make him an offer. Quinn smiled. Eric agreed.\n\n\n\n\"I want to make something clear. Steffy was well respected and brought a whole new energy to the position,\" Eric said. He added that it would be tempered by Ridge's experience.\n\n\n\nEric and Quinn agreed they had all learned forgiveness. \"I never meant to hurt you,\" Ridge said to Eric. They embraced. Eric said that Steffy and Ridge would be an unbeatable combination. Eric said he would talk to Steffy, but Ridge offered to do that. After Ridge left, Quinn wondered how Steffy would react to the news.\n\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Nicole admired Steffy's engagement ring and noted that Liam had great taste. Steffy said it felt good to have his ring on her finger. She was grateful that she and Liam had finally connected.\n\n\n\nNicole said Steffy deserved to be happy. She'd had a huge impact on culture and fashion, and she was engaged to the man she was meant to be with. Steffy noted that she would have never guessed a year before that she would have been engaged to Liam and in the CEO position. Steffy lamented that she had almost messed things up with her grandfather.\n\n\n\nSteffy was thankful that Eric had put his faith in her. Nicole thought everyone was happy for her. Steffy frowned and said that her brother had issues. Nicole said she knew how hard Steffy worked.\n\n\n\nLater, in Steffy's office, Ridge entered and said that he had been with Eric and Quinn, and they wanted to make some changes at Forrester. He wanted to discuss them with Steffy. He explained that Quinn had suggested to Eric that he share the CEO position with Steffy.\n\n\n\nSteffy did not look happy. She wondered if Eric was giving Ridge her job. Ridge quickly explained that they would share the position. She was not being demoted. He looked forward to getting the family back together and leading the company into the future.\n\n\n\nSteffy looked uneasy. Ridge reminded her that he had been running Forrester since before she had been born. Their talents and reputations complemented each other. Ridge was grateful that Eric had forgiven him and trusted him again. \"Working with you -- that makes me really happy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I'd be honored to share my title with you,\" Steffy said. She discussed all the stories she had heard about how Ridge and Eric had inspired each other. \"Of course I want that,\" she said. She admitted that the position had been a huge challenge, but she was ready. Ridge agreed she was a natural-born leader.\n\n\n\nSteffy wondered when the company would make an official announcement. Ridge said he didn't know, but he had a phone call to make first. Steffy understood it would be to Thomas.\n\n\n\nSteffy teased her dad that she wanted the desk in the office. Ridge agreed. Steffy reminded Ridge that she had not been happy that Ridge had been passed over before. She looked forward to them sharing a vision and respect for each other. Ridge reminded her that he was incredibly proud of her and grateful. They embraced.\n\n\n\nAt an outdoor bar, Zende and Thomas discussed that things had changed at Forrester. Zende said he planned to change his future. He had been away and was convinced he wanted a future with Nicole. He vowed to make things right with her. Zende asked about Douglas and Caroline, and Thomas said he had spent a lot of time in New York with them. He lamented that while he had been gone, Steffy had been appointed CEO.\n\n\n\nThomas suggested they should make their own plans. He advised Zende that he was a great photographer, but he could do more with life. Zende said he wasn't shutting any doors. Thomas explained that Forrester was going to be divided with two factions -- one supported Steffy, and the other didn't. \"We are both Forresters, but for whatever reason, she is the heir apparent,\" Thomas said bitterly.\n\n\n\nThomas was angry that Steffy had developed a big social influence that would die down in a year. He, on the other hand, had proven himself countless times as a designer. Thomas shook his head. He paid the bill, and Zende left.\n\n\n\n\"Cheer up,\" a female bar patron said. She added that Thomas looked like a model and should be lighting up a room. She suggested they have a drink together. Thomas thanked her but declined. The patron teased that he was too depressed to have a drink with a pretty girl.\n\n\n\nThomas acknowledged that she was trying to be nice. He agreed she was refreshing, but it wasn't going to change his mood. \"What's got you down?\" she asked. She guessed it was money, but Thomas said it was the family business. She thought it was one or the other, but he said business was family. She understood and said she knew about that.\n\n\n\nThe woman asked what business he was in. He said fashion, and she asked where he worked. Thomas replied that he was a designer for Forrester, and the woman was impressed. Thomas' phone rang. It was Ridge, and he needed to see Thomas immediately. Thomas said he had to leave. He asked the woman's name, and she said it was Sally. He asked her last name, but she said it was unimportant.\n\n\n\nThomas said he appreciated Sally's time, and he left. Sally asked the bartender to close out her bill. He asked her name. \"Sally Spectra,\" she answered.\n\n\n\nIn Nicole's office at Forrester, Zende shot photos of Nicole and said he was capturing a hot young executive. Nicole said she wasn't an executive yet. She'd thought Zende was still out of town. He said he couldn't stay away because he missed her too much. He announced that he had messed up and always regretted hurting her.\n\n\n\nNicole begged Zende to stop apologizing. He said he still loved her. He knew she didn't want to hear it and that she felt they were only words, but he wanted to fight for their relationship.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "At Il Giardino, Zende confides in Thomas that while he was away he realized that he wants his future to be with Nicole. Thomas admits that he has been doing some soul searching too; and voices his unhappiness about Steffy being chosen as CEO. When Zende leaves, Thomas continues to share his woes with a spunky red-headed stranger at the bar who introduces herself as Sally Spectra. Eric fills Quinn and Ridge in on his trip to Genoa City. He then wants to discuss what he and Ridge touched on before: the CEO chair at the company. Ridge happily accepts Eric's offer; especially because the Forrester patriarch is extremely content with Steffy's performance and wants Ridge to form a tight team with his daughter. Later, Eric thanks Quinn for making him believe in the power of forgiveness as mending fences with Ridge is exactly what he needed. Zende finds Nicole and admits how wrong he was and vows to continue to fight for her. Ridge is nervous to break the news of his promotion to Steffy. Surprisingly, Steffy is more than happy to share the executive duties with her father as she considers it a great learning experience.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Zende and Thomas talk over lunch about their lives. Thomas was with Caroline and Douglas and sorting out his personal life. Zende is still concerned with his future with Nicole. He vows to do what is right with Nicole. Thomas says he was not even considered for the CEO position so now it is those who are with Steffy and those who are not. So Zende should look out for himself and his own future. Zende tells Thomas to hang in there and not feel so unappreciated. It will all work out. Ridge tells his dad that it sounds like his trip to Genoa City was a success. Eric says yes and the flight home gave him time to think what he wants to do now with the CEO chair for the future. Quinn says it is time to put their past aside and move forward with the company. Eric says he is very pleased with Steffy's performance with the company but he also is very pleased with Ridge for staying when he was passed over. He praises Quinn for showing him the way to forgiveness. Eric says he was disrespected and betrayed but he chooses not to think that way now. It is time to move on. He loved it when they ran the company together and he hopes it will be that way again with Steffy and Ridge running it. Ridge says he cannot be grateful enough and he'd like to tell Steffy himself. Eric says he owes it all to Quinn; Ridge catches her eye and smiles. Ridge makes it to Steffy's office and lays it on her that Eric wants him to be co-CEO with her. Of course it catches her by surprise. He assures her quickly that she is not being demoted and he is not brought in to help her because she cannot do the job, but Eric wants them both to be the future of this company and Quinn helped him see that. They can do this. They can take it to new heights. He agrees with Eric, he thinks they can complement each other. And working with her like he did with his dad will make him very happy. Zende sneaks up and takes pictures of Nicole saying she is the hottest new executive. A total female stranger walks up and tells Thomas she would like to change his mood. She wonders if it is money worries. He says no, it is family business and nothing she can say now will change his mood. Zende tells Nicole that he knows he messed up and he will always regret hurting her. He still loves her and maybe that is not what she wants to hear, but it won't go away. He will not give up on her. He is fighting for them and if he has to prove it he will. Ridge wants to hear Steffy's thoughts. If she thinks she cannot accept this he can make the phone call. After careful thought she says she would be honored. She holds out her hands and says she cannot wait to start. He says before the announcement there is one phone call to Thomas first. He calls and tells Thomas he needs to see him at the office the first chance he has. the young woman is surprised to hear his name is Forrester and parts with saying they probably will meet again. She tells the waiter that her name is Sally ..Sally Spectra. Ridge tells Steffy that he is grateful they get to do this together and they hug.",
