    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's house, Steffy was surprised that Liam wanted to take over her family's business. Liam said that, with all the changes Rick had made, she'd barely recognize Forrester. He wanted to return it to some semblance of what it had been when Stephanie and Eric had run it.\n\n\nSteffy didn't know what they could do about Rick, who had irrevocable control for one year. Liam said that he and Steffy could do anything together, but if they allowed things to keep going Rick's way, there would be no company at the end of a year. Liam asked her to sell her shares to him and convince Thomas to do the same thing.\n\n\nSteffy asked why it was important to Liam. Liam didn't want to see Ivy and Caroline suffer, and he wanted to protect Forrester's brand before Rick destroyed it. Steffy was leery of selling to Spencer. Liam noted that Spencer already had a stake in Forrester. He said that she could still be involved in the business upon Eric's retirement and hinted that she could return home to run it with him.\n\n\nSteffy assert that Thomas wouldn't sell. Liam hoped that she could sway her brother. Steffy agreed that things needed to change, but \"I'm never gonna sell my shares.\"\n\n\nSteffy figured that she had to do something, starting with her father hooking up with a woman her own age. Liam encouraged her to go to Forrester and see what Rick had done to it, as long as she promised to think about his proposal.\n\n\nLiam went to the kitchen for drinks, and as he returned, Steffy was looking at a picture of Liam and Ivy kissing on the boat in Amsterdam. Steffy joked about him traveling the world with her cousin and asked what it was with him and brunette Forresters. Liam guessed he had a type. She warned him not to take Ivy to Aspen, which belonged to Steffy and Liam.\n\n\nLiam revealed that there were many places he associated with Steffy -- Aspen, the cliff house, and the beach. A flashback of Steffy and Liam in various places around the world played. He said that, even though she lived halfway around the world, he was happy that there were still places that caused him to think about her and the happy memories of what they'd once been.\n\n\nSteffy uttered that things could have been very different. Liam said things hadn't turned out as they'd planned, but they couldn't live with regret, either. Steffy agreed and began to say, \"But, Liam, I will always...\" She paused and stated that her feelings for him would never change.\n\n\nLiam hugged Steffy. Ivy strode into the house and stiffened. She noted that Steffy was there and asked what was going on.\n\n\nIn the Forrester CEO's office, Maya said that Eric had tried Brooke's plan, but it wouldn't work from either Brooke or Eric. Brooke stated that she and Eric knew what was going on, even if Maya didn't choose to acknowledge it. Rick said he appreciated Brooke's concern, but they'd all moved on.\n\n\nRick claimed that it wasn't about sticking it to Caroline, and he'd never had the kind of support that Maya offered him. Brooke said the relationship was temporary. Maya asked if Brooke thought Maya wasn't good enough because wasn't a Spencer or didn't grow up with privilege. Brooke stated that the problem wasn't Maya; it was how quickly Rick had moved on with her.\n\n\nRick assured Brooke that there was nothing of concern, but Brooke said he'd shot off a gun. Rick insisted that he hadn't shot anywhere near Ridge or Caroline. Rick quipped that Brooke might have done the same thing if she'd seen the two making out.\n\n\nThe kissing had repulsed Rick, but not because he still cared. Rick claimed that he'd moved on after discovering that Caroline was a liar no better than Amber. As it stood, he and Caroline had signed the divorce papers, he was with Maya, and Caroline had apparently moved on with Ridge. It was sickening to Rick, but he believed it might be for the best.\n\n\nBrooke and Caroline exited, and Maya thanked Rick for saying what he'd said in front of Brooke and Caroline. The declaration had removed any doubt. Rick vowed to keep declaring it to anyone else who needed to hear it. He claimed that Maya was the woman he wanted to spend his life with.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Brooke told Caroline that Brooke had tried. Caroline was resigned to believe that things were for the best. Brooke asked if Caroline actually expected to have a relationship with Ridge. Brooke understood the attraction better than anyone, but she warned that many women had experienced the chemistry and attraction to Ridge long before Caroline had.\n\n\nCaroline didn't doubt it, but she said it was more than just chemistry. \"My dear Caroline,\" the placating Brooke said. Brooke explained that Ridge was dynamic and flirtatious. Many women wanted to be with Ridge. \"But if you think it's going to be something more...\" Brooke added.\n\n\n\"It is,\" Caroline confidently responded. Brooke advised Caroline to be realistic, because she wasn't going to have a relationship with Ridge.\n\n\nBrooke claimed to not want Caroline to get hurt, but Caroline stated that she'd already been hurt -- by Brooke's son. Brooke corrected that Caroline's actions had hurt her. Caroline asserted that she'd kissed another man, but Rick had done the betraying. Caroline noted that Brooke hadn't been there to see what Caroline and Ridge had been through together.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that she didn't need to see it. She'd been through it countless times with women who thought that they had some cosmic connection with Ridge, women who thought that -- Brooke stopped speaking, and Caroline asked what Brooke had been about to say.\n\n\n\"That they can replace me,\" Brooke stated. Caroline chuckled and asked if Brooke was serious. \"Caroline, if I wanted Ridge back, I would have him -- just like that!\" Brooke stated, snapping her fingers.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie was playing with Will when Bill entered, announcing, \"Honey, I'm home!\" He'd arrived to visit Will and remarked that Brooke was back in town. Katie murmured that she should see Brooke. Bill agreed and relayed that he'd done it already.\n\n\nKatie apprehensively asked how it had gone. Bill replied that he'd explained to Brooke that there was one woman he wanted to spend his life with, and he was hoping Katie wanted that, too.\n\n\nKatie put Will in his room and returned with a stuffed horse that Will wanted her give to Bill. Bill asked if she liked having Bill around as much as Will did. She liked it, but a lot had happened. Bill thought it made their bond stronger. He said Brooke had known that he'd needed time away from her to get clarity about what he really wanted, and what he wanted was Katie and their family.\n\n\nKatie believed Bill was sincere -- in that moment. Bill stated that he wanted her and their family that day, the next day, and forever. He asked her to say she wanted it, too. Katie missed their marriage, but she didn't know how to go back. Bill said that they wouldn't go back. Instead, they'd move forward.\n\n\nBill believed that they'd needed their time apart to appreciate and understand each other. Bill said she was his perfect partner, who'd challenged, supported, and corrected him when needed. Katie had given him a child, and he was tired of being a part-time parent.\n\n\nKatie hated it, too, \"But if you just want me because -- \"\n\n\nBill shut Katie up with a passionate kiss. He said that Katie being Will's mother was just part of the picture. He'd never met anyone more stubborn than he, and she inspired him to be the man that she believed him to be. He didn't want to waste a moment in putting their family together.\n\n\nFrom his pocket, Bill pulled out a ring and said he loved Katie. \"Say you'll marry me,\" he asked the tearful Katie. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke shocks everyone in the room when she demands that Rick forgive Caroline so that they may piece their marriage back together. Bill tells Katie about his visit with Brooke and makes his intentions regarding the direction of his future very clear. The bond between Liam and Steffy resurfaces as they discuss the possibility of her assisting him with his plan against Rick. Maya confronts Brooke about the hostility that she is feeling from her.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tells Steffy that she won't even recognize FC anymore. He wants to take it back to it's roots, to a place she can be proud of. Liam says they can wait the year but there will be no company to come back to. They can pool their resources now and erase what Rick has done and get it back to its original place with her family. Brooke asks Rick to tell Caroline that he wants her back. Maya speaks out and tells her that Eric tried this and it did not work with him and it will not work with her either. Rick tells his mother that he appreciates her concern but he has moved on. It is not with Caroline. Bill walks in on Katie and Will and says he is home .maybe if he says that enough it will come true. He tells her Brooke is home so she should go see her like he did. She asks how that went. He says good, they said what needed to be said. He told her there was only one woman he wanted to spend his life with and he hopes that she does too. He says moving forward could make their bond even stronger. He needed time away from Brooke and now he knows what he wants \u0096 Katie and his family. Ivy helps Aly with some of her details for her shoe line but warns her that the way Rick feels about her now that might not be a good thing. She might want to stay away from Ivy. Maya says she is only a model and not a Spencer or from a family of privilege but there is nothing wrong with her. Brooke says no, nothing wrong but Rick moved on way too soon and now is brandishing guns. Rick says that Caroline is just another liar like Amber. He says the divorce papers have been signed and he has moved on and Caroline is with Ridge so she has moved on too. As sickening as it is, perhaps it is for the best. Steffy doesn't like the idea with Spencer. Liam tells her she can keep her job at International or come back and help him run the company. He needs her to make this work. She needs to join forces with him. She says she will never sell her shares, neither will Thomas but she will try to figure something out. Liam tells her to go talk to her dad, because if they work together there is nothing they can't do. Katie tells Bill that she believes he means it, today and this moment. He says always and he hopes she wants it too. Steffy looks at pix of Liam at his place and jokes that he gets around with the brunette Forrester's .Amsterdam and Paris. She just hopes it won't be Aspen too as that was their place. He says so many places reminds him of her. Things did not turn out for them as planned. She says her feelings for him will never change. They hug as Ivy walks through the door. She asks if she is interrupting anything. Maya thanks Rick for what he said and says it reaffirms that he really wants her in his life. He assures her that is so. Brooke tells Caroline that she tried but looks like Rick is not gonna come around. Maybe Rick is right, everybody is better off. She realizes the attraction for Caroline to Ridge, but just remember many other women have had the same feelings and it never pans out. Brooke tells her to be realistic. She is not going to have a relationship with Ridge. She can see how she could get swept up with this and Ridge. She is not the first or the last. Brooke says she has seen it countless times that other women have this cosmic connection and think they can replace Brooke. She snaps her fingers and says if she wanted Ridge she could have him back just like that. Bill tells Katie to tell him that she wants this as much as he does. Katie says yes she misses their life together, who they were together but she does not know how they go back to that. He says they don't. They will be more prepared this time and fully understand each other. He says she is his perfect partner as she encourages him when he needs it but pushes him when he needs that too. And yes he has Liam and Wyatt but he did not raise them. Now she has gifted him with Will and he does not want to be a part time dad. She says she hates that too. He grabs her and kisses her. Then says he wants her because she is Will's mother but that is only a small part of it. He loves her because she is the smartest person in the room, is sexy and she excites him and is the most stubborn person that he knows besides himself. And most importantly she inspires him to be the man she wants him to be. He tells her they should not waste another moment. He pulls out a box and shows her a huge ring and asks her to marry him.",
