    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the old Spectra building, C.J. said it wasn't too late to call the wrecking crew. Sally contended that they'd make the \"old broad\" shine again. He replied that he was the original Sally's son, and he hadn't been able to make it work. \"That's for sure,\" his aunt quipped.\n\n\nSally reminded C.J. that he'd given her six months. C.J. asserted that once the time was up, the \"old broad\" had a date with the wrecking ball. Shirley told her granddaughter that they might need a year at the least. C.J. said he'd call his guy right then if they were saying they couldn't handle it. Sally ordered him to put the phone away because they were preserving those weathered walls and saving the Spectra legacy.\n\n\nC.J. asked Sally to return to earth, where she needed capital, designers, and equipment. Sally claimed they were ready to hire the best of the best. \"But cheap. Very cheap,\" she added. C.J. quipped that he could see she'd thought it through.\n\n\nShirley suggested an ad in the paper, asking for interns for a hot new design house. Sally praised \"Grams\" for the suggestion and decided to plaster social media. C.J. reminded Sally that she had to pay people. Sally claimed to have money saved up in the bank. \"You do have some money saved from the bakery, right?\" she asked Shirley.\n\n\nSally struggled to recall the name of Sally's tailor then said Saul's name. She said they needed a Saul. Shirley took off to find out if any of Sally's original contact numbers were still around and viable. C.J. told Sally that she had no cash or business plan. Sally said they had passion and imagination. She asked him to be useful and take a picture of her at her new desk.\n\n\nC.J. remarked that it was awkward to say Sally's name. \"Sally Spectra,\" he said. Sally replied that it was her name and advised him not to wear it out. She'd always idolized his mother, who'd been the reason Sally had gotten into fashion. There just weren't many fashion opportunities back home for her.\n\n\nC.J. asserted that idolizing and dreaming were one thing, but doing it without Sally was risky. His said his mother was one of a kind. Sally wanted to hear more about the Great Sally Spectra. C.J. said there was nothing like hanging out with his mom. Her energy was infectious, and if she trusted a person, that was it. The person had a friend for life.\n\n\nA song with the lyrics, \"we are forever bold,\" played over a montage of Sally's exciting fashion moments on the runway, in the office, and on location with Saul, Clark, and Darla nearby. Afterward, Sally the second stated that Sally had said that she was Sally's last hope, and she wouldn't let Sally down.\n\n\n In the design office at Forrester, Ridge and Brooke were entangled in each other's arms, holding and stroking each other. They'd missed each other. Brooke said Hope was great and asked how things were around home and, specifically, what was going on with Ridge and Quinn. \"Me and Quinn? What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Ridge that he'd had a plan to get rid of Quinn. Ridge replied that they'd taken steps in the right direction, and Brooke was looking at the new co-CEO of Forrester. Ecstatic, Brooke guessed that Eric had changed his mind. Ridge replied that it had been Quinn's idea, and Brooke rendered a puzzled stare.\n\n\nBrooke couldn't believe Quinn would do it because Quinn and Ridge hated each other. Ridge guessed that Quinn wanted to stay in Eric's good graces. Ridge was excited to run the company with his daughter and to have his fianc\u00e9e back in his arms.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Nicole, Zende, and Thomas waited at Pam's desk for a meeting in the CEO's office. Zende shared that he'd enjoyed being with his parents, but he'd returned early because the distance had made him realize what he'd been missing at home.\n\n\nRick and Maya arrived for the meeting. Maya wondered if Eric had said what it was about. \"No, but I have a pretty good idea,\" the morose Thomas responded. Rick hoped Eric had regained his senses and would offer Rick the CEO position.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Eric and Quinn checked with Steffy before a meeting to make sure Steffy was okay with the new arrangement. Steffy was excited to work with her father but wanted to know why Quinn would make a gesture like that toward Ridge. It was odd and unbelievable to Steffy that Quinn would do anything nice for Ridge. Quinn said that she'd done it for Eric and in the spirit of family unity and commitment.\n\n\nLater, everyone had gathered around the table in the CEO's office for the meeting. Zende noted that Eric was doing well and had designed a beautiful fall collection. Eric attributed it to his wife. He'd enjoyed working from home while knowing the place was being well managed. Thomas rolled his eyes at his grinning sister.\n\n\nEric noted that they hadn't had real conflict in a long time, and the major problems they'd had in the past could be attributed to Sally Spectra. \"I think I've read about her. Big hair?\" Maya said. Pam had heard all about Sally from Stephanie and said that Sally had stolen all their designs. Chuckling, Eric said it had happened year after year, and he and Ridge had been ripped off many times.\n\n\nZende asked how Sally had been able to get away with it, and Brooke answered that Sally had had spies. Rick remarked that Sally would create knockoffs thread for thread. Eric stated that it was much lower quality and at a lower price point. Brooke chimed in about how Sally would try to get the drop on Forrester by having her showings first. Eric said Sally was charming but a shark.\n\n\nAs the conversation continued, Eric conveyed that Sally was no longer in the business and was on an island somewhere, enjoying herself. He'd only mentioned her because they hadn't had conflict in a long while, and the company had been flourishing due to Steffy's leadership.\n\n\nRick's ears perked up when Eric said he was making leadership changes, and Steffy had agreed to share her position with someone as talented as she was. Rick grinned as Eric began to introduce his son as the new co-CEO. \"Ridge Forrester,\" Eric said.\n\n\nRick scoffed. He called it ridiculous. Eric replied that it wasn't, and it was the way it would be. Eric asked Rick to remember his value as vice president and head of International. Rick quipped that he knew his value, and it was why he should have a shot. Thomas argued that at least Rick had a shot. Thomas, on the other hand, hadn't even been considered.\n\n\nEric reminded Thomas of his talent as a designer. Thomas was one of the hottest up-and-coming designers in the industry. Zende asked Steffy for her feelings. Grinning, she said her father was the creative. She'd handle PR and business. To her, it was a nice balance.\n\n\nRick asked about Quinn. Eric said that she'd remain president. Rick scoffed. \"Of course, team Quinn. Hoo! Hoo!\" Rick retorted.\n\n\n\"That's enough,\" Eric replied. To him, the team was a no-brainer. No one had had more influence over Forrester than Ridge, and Eric said it was even more than Eric. Eric conveyed that it had been Quinn's idea. Rick and Maya were surprised, and Rick remarked that they all knew Quinn couldn't stand Ridge. Quinn replied that her opinion had changed.\n\n\nEric hailed each person in the room for their importance and contribution to Forrester. Ridge thanked Eric for the job, Quinn for suggesting it, and Steffy for agreeing to it. Eric expected great things. Ridge said they'd do Eric proud. As Ridge and Eric hugged, Brooke cut her eyes at Quinn, who was smiling at Ridge and Eric's embrace.\n\n\nAfter the meeting, Brooke and Ridge strode straight across the hall to the design office and closed the door behind them. Rick, Maya, Zende, Thomas, and Nicole poured into the hallway, and as Pam closed the door behind her desk, she asked them all why they were so gloomy. It was good news to Pam, but Maya asked what was so good about it.\n\n\nPam stated that the family was pulling together. Steffy had done well, and Ridge was back where he belonged. Thomas said he could speak for Rick in asking when one of them would get a turn. Rick added that they also wanted to know why Quinn was supporting Ridge.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Eric told Quinn that it hadn't gone too terribly -- except for Rick and Thomas' feelings of alienation. Quinn said they knew he loved them and hopefully knew he'd done what was best. Eric was always amazed by Quinn's supportiveness. He remembered how much she'd worried about letting him down. He said it could never happen.\n\n\nIn the design office, Ridge threw Brooke up against the door and locked it so they could feverishly make out. Brooke squealed, saying they couldn't do it there. He replied that they'd done it there all the time in the past. Ridge let her go, saying he needed to be a grownup because of his position. Straightening her clothes, Brooke said she didn't understand Quinn's support of Ridge, who'd been the one leading the charge against Quinn.\n\n\nRidge figured that Quinn just wanted to get on his good side. Brooke deduced that he was saying Quinn had changed, but to Brooke, that didn't sound like Quinn. Ridge suggested that Wyatt's divorce had led Quinn to give up. Brooke believed that there was more to it.\n\n\nRidge flashed to kissing Quinn in the hotel. Brooke snapped him out of it by asking if there was anything that had happened while she'd been gone. Hugging her, Ridge replied, \"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Brooke returns from her trip to Europe and is stunned to find out that, instead of her ouster from Forrester Creations and their lives, Quinn made Ridge Co-CEO of the company. Ridge attempts to distract Brooke with a kiss when she asks why Quinn would want this. Steffy assures her grandfather that she is excited about working with her father, but also questions Quinn's motive. Quinn stammers that she did this for Eric to bring the family together. Thomas, Rick, Maya, Zende, Nicole and Pam then assemble in the boardroom where Eric announces Ridge's triumphant return as head of the company. As Ridge makes a speech about gratitude, Brooke watches Ridge and Quinn exchange eye contact. Both Rick and Thomas then express their discontent loudly. At the Spectra Fashions building, Sally is triumphant when a still doubtful C.J. agrees to give her six months to revive the company. Sally and Shirley immediately want to start hiring aspiring talent - which comes cheap. C.J. talks about Sally's energy and spirit and flashes back to his mother through the years at work. Sally vows to make her namesake proud.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke comes home and hugs Ridge and first thing she wants to know is how he is and is Quinn out of their lives. He tells her about him being named co-CEO. All's well that ends well. All are waiting outside in the hallway and Thomas says he has a feeling he knows what it is all about. Pam tells them to back up; she cannot let them in until Eric says so. CJ tells Sally that she has six months to show a profit or dig her own grave, then it is the wrecking ball. He had an offer and the only reason he is doing this is because she is family. She says Spectra's are not quitters. She will put it all on social media and get the designers and help they need. They need Saul. Shirley says she will go look for some of Sally's old contacts. Sally Jr. says all they need is passion and some imagination. She asks CJ to take a picture at her desk. The group welcomes Eric back to the office and he congratulates Steffy for a good job. Curiously Sally's name comes up with big hair and big personality, the rival fashion house. Sally would stop at nothing to make a knockoff. But Spectra folded years ago and now they are tearing down the building. They haven't had those conflicts in a long, long time. But now he wants to make a few changes. He has talked to Steffy and she has agreed to accept his son and her father, Ridge, as co-CEO. All are shocked with Quinn and Ridge locking eyes. Rick is the first to speak up and says this is crazy. Eric says no and this is the way it is going to be. Rick says he should have been picked but Eric says no, it was Quinn's suggestion that it be Ridge and he is on board. He tells Nicole, Zende and Maya that they are all important parts of this team and he feels honored to have them and for Brooke too. He cannot wait to see what happens in the future. Ridge hugs his dad. Sally tells CJ that she has idolized her aunt since she was little. That was the reason that she got into fashion. Now she wants to hear all about her from CJ. All he says is music to her ears. A grand dame, a living legend. She will not let her down. Pam asks why is everyone so gloomy; this should be good news. Now Ridge is back where he belongs. Thomas says when is it going to be his turn. Eric tells Quinn that she surprises him every day. She could never let him down. Ridge practically ravages Brooke in his office but Brooke tries to cool him down. He says okay he is now co-CEO so guess he needs to start acting like it. She thinks there is more to it than Quinn just changing and being on his side now. Did something happen while she was away. He says no.",
