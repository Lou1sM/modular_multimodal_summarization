She replied that Ridge seemed to be meeting a friend. \"Ridge never showed me any affection. No hugs, no kisses, no nothing,\" Bill replied.\n\n\n\"Ridge doesn't like you. European men are different,\" Brooke contended. Bill cited that Ridge wasn't European and hadn't seen any women in Paris because \"he was seeing a man.\"\n\n\nBrooke stated that Bill couldn't actually believe that Ridge had been in an affair with a man. Bill reasoned that people changed, and he pointed out that his sister, who'd once dated Thorne, had clearly stopped repressing her true feelings over the course of time.\n\n\nBrooke said the pictures proved the narrow-minded way Bill saw the world. Bill displayed photos from the previous June's Gay Pride celebration and noted the Gay Pride flag Ridge was holding. Brooke recognized the man beside Ridge in the photo as Fabrice, a designer that Ridge had once mentored.\n\n\nBrooke recalled that Fabrice had transferred to Forrester International after falling in love with Laurant, a Frenchman. According to her, the men had since broken up, and Ridge had taken Fabrice in because he hadn't wanted Fabrice to be alone. \"Mm-hmm,\" Bill cynically replied.\n\n\nBill showed Brooke a picture of the men reading poetry, but Brooke insisted that she'd know if Ridge was interested in men that way. She reasoned that she and Ridge had gay friends, but Ridge wasn't gay. Bill asked why, then, Ridge wasn't with her.\n\n\nBrooke wanted Bill to leave, but Bill asked how close Brooke had gotten to sleeping with Ridge. She refused to discuss it with Bill, who continued to wonder why Ridge hadn't closed the deal with her.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, R.J. and Ridge visited Katie and Will. Ridge had just picked R.J. up from the station. The four of them played in the living room, and R.J. explained that, at age nine, he was no longer ticklish. Ridge tested it by tickling R.J.\n\n\nKatie admitted that she'd been concerned about R.J. moving abroad at a young age. Ridge thought it had been good for R.J. and revealed that a friend, Fabrice, had lived with Ridge and R.J. while going through a bad breakup. Fabrice had helped R.J. learn French and do homework, and Fabrice had showed Ridge and R.J. parts of Paris that Ridge hadn't known existed.\n\n\nKatie took Will upstairs, and R.J. stated that he knew he was in trouble. Ridge guessed the statement had something to do with the text message he'd gotten. R.J. admitted that his classes hadn't been canceled for a teacher's conference; he just missed being at home. R.J. hadn't wanted to say anything about his feelings because attending school in Ojai had been his idea.\n\n\nRidge told his son that people could have ideas that didn't work out. R.J. asked if he could return home, and Ridge said they'd talk to his mother about it. Ridge figured that they needed to let the school know that R.J. hadn't been kidnapped, and the child guessed he'd be grounded. Ridge replied that it was worse than that -- his son would have to hear a lecture from him.\n\n\nRidge said there was just one secret to success, and it was being honest. All relationships depended upon it, and if a person pretended to be someone else, no one could know or love the real person inside. The father and son made a deal to be honest, and they hugged.\n\n\nKatie returned with Will and asked Ridge to drop them off at the park. Ridge asked if he and R.J. could go to the park, too. Katie replied that it sounded great. Son of Levi's song \"And the Wheels of Change\" played as, later, Ridge, Katie, Will, and R.J. picnicked in the park.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam moped inside and saw Caroline on his deck. She entered through the sliding glass door, and he asked what she was doing there. At first, she claimed he'd given her an open invitation. At Liam's expectant stare, she said that Bill thought Liam spent too much time alone. Liam still didn't believe her, and she admitted that she liked to go there to escape from work.\n\n\nLiam filled Caroline in on what had happened at Emerald Bay. He'd taken his car home, but he didn't know how Wyatt would get home because Hope had taken Wyatt's truck. Caroline figured Hope had been sick of the men arguing, but Liam stated that Hope might be sick of Wyatt's manipulations.\n\n\nCaroline claimed that people always lied, and usually, it was for someone else's benefit. Liam stared in disbelief; however, she insisted that her mother had never told the whole truth about their family. She cited that their neighbors had believed that Dani had been the nanny. Liam didn't want to judge, but for himself, he couldn't live like that. He didn't think Hope could, either.\n\n\nLiam called Hope but got her voicemail. Caroline said Hope was fed up with both men. Liam replied that all he'd done was be truthful, but Caroline said it wasn't the quickest way to a woman's heart. Caroline predicted that Hope would forgive Wyatt because he adored her and no one else.\n\n\nLiam guessed that support wasn't in Caroline's arsenal. Caroline didn't see the point of saying things she didn't mean; however, she was sorry he was hurting. He replied that he was angry. Caroline pointed out that Hope had been overnight in a trailer with Liam's half-brother, but Liam stated that Hope wouldn't jump into anything without a commitment.\n\n\nCaroline felt that getting in the trailer represented a form of commitment, and as a \"practical person,\" she hoped that Hope would forgive Wyatt. Liam got upset; however, Caroline said that Quinn's design sense was spectacular, and Wyatt kept Quinn focused. Liam told \"Miss Practical\" to find another plan because he couldn't see Hope letting Wyatt remain at Forrester.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Hope blazed in, and Rick noted that she was upset after her vacation. Hope couldn't help but think the \"vacation\" had been staged like the robbery, and she wondered what she was putting out there that made people feel like lying to her. Rick hugged his sister.\n\n\nHope relayed that the police had strong cases against the thieves for the three other heists they'd pulled. She was upset because she didn't want it made known in court that the heist from Forrester had been a hoax. Rick said it would sink their reputation and people's faith in HFTF.\n\n\nHope stated that it was clearly Wyatt pocketing the diamond on the video footage, and she meekly guessed that they could terminate the jewelry contract for criminal malfeasance. Rick wondered if Wyatt had given any consideration to what it could do to the company. Hope thought Wyatt probably had, but to Rick, it was obvious that Wyatt hadn't.\n\n\nRick said that Charlie's security firm could have been ruined by it, and Forrester would have been on the hook for a hundred-million-dollar diamond. She doubted Wyatt would have let it happen. \"What was he going to do, Hope? Hide it under his pillow and suddenly, miraculously, make it appear out of his rear end?\" Rick argued.\n\n\nHope was sure Wyatt would have devised something, but Rick demanded to know why she was defending Wyatt. \"I don't know!\" she yelled, and just then, Wyatt entered the room.\n\n\nRick lit into Wyatt, saying that Wyatt disgusted him, and he asked if Wyatt knew what his recklessness could have done to Forrester. Wyatt claimed he'd researched Forrester and knew the crazy things it had done for publicity in the past.\n\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no. You shut your mouth right now!\" Rick raged. Rick stated that Wyatt didn't run the company, and decisions for it had been strategically made by family members, one of which Wyatt was not. Rick asserted that they'd never put themselves in legal jeopardy or perpetrate fraud.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that he'd been selfish but said he'd wanted to look good for Hope. Wyatt claimed that love made people do crazy things. He'd thought it would be like crime-solving on television, and he hadn't stopped to think he'd be hurting Hope as much as he had.\n\n\nThe three determined that not many people knew about what Wyatt had done, and Hope doubted Liam would ruin her reputation by outing it. Rick declared that he was terminating the Fullers' contract, but Wyatt murmured that Rick wasn't the one who'd hired them. \"Excuse me?\" Rick asked.\n\n\nRick asserted that he was the president, and he called the shots. Wyatt asked if it was what Hope wanted. He knew he deserved it; however, he said Hope had hand-picked them, and they'd been good for Forrester. He claimed he'd tried to be good for her in other ways -- unless that was over, too.\n\n\nRick told Hope that he'd never pulled rank on her line before. He asked what it would be and if they would cut Wyatt and Quinn loose or not. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Bill hopes that the dirt that he had dug up on Ridge will change Brooke\u2019s mind about continuing to pursue him. Rick leaves it up to Hope to decide what to do about Wyatt\u2019s future at Forrester Creations and in her life. Sparks fly between Ridge and Katie as they spend time together during a play date with their sons. Caroline gives Liam a piece of painful advice.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill keeps showing more pictures of Ridge to Brooke. She asks what is she supposed to see. He keeps pointing out a certain man in the picture that Ridge is hugging. This is the reason he did not mention another woman while in Paris. He was living with a man. Brooke scoffs as she recognizes the man; a protege of Ridge's who had lost his wife. Ridge did not want him to be alone and offered him a place in the Paris office and to stay at his place. She says they both have gay friends, but that does not mean that Ridge is gay. Liam comes home and finds Caroline there. He's a little grumpy and wants to know what she is doing there. She reminds him that he said she could drop by any time. She asks how he got home. He said he had his car. He doesn't know how Wyatt got back as Hope took his truck. Hope is talking to Rick and finds out that Pam knows too. She is the one who showed Rick the footage. She says the robbers really are up on other charges so they will serve jail time, but she doesn't want it to come out that Wyatt's thwarted efforts was a hoax. Rick says yes it would sink their reputation. He wonders what Wyatt was thinking or if he even cared. Charlie's security company would have been ruined and they would have been liable for a $100 million diamond. Hope says she is sure Wyatt had a plan but she did not ask for details. She says he is not sure why she is defending him. Wyatt walks in. Katie and Ridge sit on the floor at Katie's playing with Will and RJ; all seem to be enjoying themselves. Later Ridge tells RJ that he thinks it is time to go back to school. RH says he knows he is going to be grounded as it was not true that the teachers had a conference today. He just missed being at home and would like to come back there. Ridge says he will have to speak to his mother about that. But besides that he will have to listen to a lecture by Ridge. All relationships in life are based on honesty and he must learn to live by that. He gives RJ a big hug and asks if he'd like to go with him and Katie to the park. Liam keeps trying to call Hope but it keeps going to voice mail. Caroline scoffs that it looks like Hope is not talking to either him or Wyatt. Liam says he didn't do anything, he just told the truth. Caroline says yes but that is not always the quickest way to a woman's heart. Wyatt walks in ready to face the firing squad. Rick says that he disgusts him. He wants to know if Wyatt has any idea how his recklessness could have harmed this company. Wyatt says he researched Forrester before he signed all those contracts and he knows all the crazy things that Rick himself did for publicity .Rick tells him to shut his mouth right now. Wyatt does not run this company members of the family do which he is not part of. And they would never put it in legal jeopardy. Wyatt says he knows now that it was selfish. He just wanted to look good for Hope. He admits love makes you do crazy things. He did not stop to take the time to realize he would be committing a crime or even hurting Hope that much. But he knows now. Bill tells Brooke that if Ridge is not gay, then what's the story. He has not sealed the deal with Brooke either and apparently she has been all over him to do so. Caroline tells Liam that she is sorry he is hurting. He says more, just angry. She says his brother took away his true love in a trailer and it was long enough, overnight. He says Hope is not the kind of girl who is gonna jump into a relationship without a commitment. She says jumping into a trailer does bear some resemblance to a commitment. He tells her she better come up with a Plan B as he can not see Hope running Forrester and keeping Quinn and Wyatt on. Rick asks who else knows about this. Hope says Charlie, Pam and Liam. Wyatt adds and his mother after the fact. Hope tells Rick that Liam will not take this to the press or the police as he is more concerned with her reputation than she is. Rick tells Wyatt that he is terminating his contract and his mother is next in. They will get the word through Legal. Wyatt looks to Hope and asks if this is what she wants. He is not asking if he deserves this. He knows the answer to that, but if it is what she wants. Does she want them gone as Hope hand picked them. They have both been good for the company and he's tried to be good to her in other ways. Or perhaps that is over now too. Rick asks Hope what is it going to be. He has never pulled rank on her before with her line. So it's up to her, if they pull Quinn and Wyatt or not.",
