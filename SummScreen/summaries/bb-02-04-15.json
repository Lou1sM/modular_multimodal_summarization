    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Bill was on the phone asking someone how much liquid capital the company could pull together in a hurry. After he hung up, he told Liam that they could buy Forrester as long as they had Steffy's shares.\n\n\nLiam and Bill agreed they would need more than Bill and Steffy's shares. Bill added that anything Spencer did would not be received well by Brooke because Bill had ended things officially with Brooke and planned to marry Katie.\n\n\nLiam wondered if Bill had been overconfident because Katie had to agree to marry him. Bill confidently announced that he had already put a ring on Katie's finger. Liam guessed that it was a bigger diamond than last time. Bill nodded. \"Congratulations, Pop,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam asked if Quinn was aware of Bill's engagement. Bill said he didn't know or care, but Liam reminded his dad that Quinn had wanted desperately to return to Bill. Bill noted that Quinn had a criminal as her personal partner in crime.\n\n\nLiam asked about Brooke, and Bill said Brooke had given him her blessing. Bill sighed and said Brooke had given him an advanced education in himself. Liam wondered who Brooke would latch onto next. Bill guessed that she would \"wander into all to familiar territory again.\" Bill shook his head.\n\n\nLiam noted that they had to get Ridge on board to make a takeover of Forrester work. Liam added that Bill's method of dealing with Ridge had been ejecting him from an aircraft. Bill agreed. Liam said that they had to remember that Ridge was a major stakeholder at Forrester, and Steffy would not agree to anything that would oust her father.\n\n\nBill recommended that they not tell anyone what they had planned. Liam wondered about Ivy, Steffy, and Katie, but Bill refused. Bill worried that Liam's quest to take over Forrester was driven by Hope. Liam looked skeptical.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy advised Caroline that she had moved too fast with Rick. Caroline had a hard time taking Steffy seriously because Caroline reminded Steffy that she knew Steffy's history with Bill and Rick.\n\n\nSteffy asked what Caroline had been doing with Ridge. Caroline admitted that she had fallen for Ridge and knew him in a different way than anyone else. Steffy scoffed. Caroline said that Steffy could ridicule the closeness they had developed as designers, but Steffy had not been in the room. \"Logic can't always explain it,\" she said.\n\n\nSteffy accused Caroline of behaving like Rick's mother. Caroline was insulted. \"Be careful, Steffy,\" Caroline advised. She remembered Steffy's past. Caroline wondered why Steffy had returned, and Caroline warned Steffy. \"I hope you're not here to jerk my cousin around,\" she said.\n\n\nSteffy countered that Liam had already contacted her. Steffy maintained that she and Liam had remained friends. Steffy suggested that Caroline should be a friend to her father and nothing more because \"anything else is nauseating.\" Steffy said that her father's reputation would never recover.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke stood outside Ridge's office. She recalled that she had told Caroline that she could get Ridge back \"just like that.\" She remembered snapping her fingers. Brooke smiled and confidently entered Ridge's office. Brooke announced that she was sure Ridge was unhappy with her.  Ridge replied that the feeling had been a \"state of affairs I have survived repeatedly,\" he said.\n\n\nBrooke proposed a truce. She announced that Katie and Bill were engaged again. Ridge wondered if that was what Katie had wanted all along. Brooke professed that Katie had wanted her family back together again. \"It's only natural,\" Brooke said. \"Gravity is natural,\" Ridge countered. He added that Katie had given up.\n\n\nBrooke changed the subject. She asked if Ridge and Caroline had spent time together with R.J. while Brooke had been in Milan. Ridge reminded Brooke that R.J. knew Caroline, but they had not spent time together with R.J.\n\n\nBrooke was glad because she didn't want their son to be confused. Ridge scoffed. Brooke maintained that Ridge and Caroline were not going to be together. Ridge asked how she knew that.\n\n\nBrooke confidently maintained that Caroline and Rick had not yet reconciled, but she knew her son needed more of a challenge than Maya could offer. She expected Caroline and Rick to remain together. Brooke said that Ridge belonged with someone more age appropriate. Brooke suggested they should have dinner together with R.J. soon. Ridge said he would like that. Brooke smiled.\n\n\nAt Quinn's house, Quinn and Deacon discussed that Quinn had been on edge. Deacon noticed that someone was at the door. He opened the door to Wyatt. Quinn and Deacon welcomed Wyatt home from Italy.\n\n\nWyatt showed his disdain for Deacon and wondered why his mother continued to live with Deacon. Quinn defended Deacon and said he had taken care of her. Wyatt said that Deacon had been a freeloader, but Quinn begged Wyatt to leave Deacon alone.\n\n\nQuinn wondered if Hope had returned, and Wyatt said that Hope had not and if she had, she would never show up anywhere near Quinn. Quinn wondered if Hope had blamed Quinn for losing the baby. Wyatt said that Hope blamed Quinn for plenty but not for losing the baby. \"How innocent do you feel about it, Mom?\" Wyatt demanded to know.\n\n\nQuinn admitted that she should have listened to Wyatt and stayed away from Hope. If she had, maybe Hope wouldn't have turned her back on Wyatt. Quinn, Wyatt, and Deacon discussed that they had all made mistakes. Wyatt shared that Hope blamed him for her miscarriage. He added that his marriage would be over because Hope had only stayed with him because of the baby.\n\n\nDeacon tried to get Quinn and Wyatt to see that the miscarriage had been no one's fault. Deacon said they had to learn how to get along and move forward. Wyatt said he felt that he should just be selfish. Wyatt confessed that he felt he had been chewed up and spit out by the Forrester family. He planned to support Ivy's line and keep his head down. \"And you didn't even have to tell me, Mom,\" he said. Wyatt left. Quinn was disappointed.\n\n\nSteffy entered Ridge's office and hugged her dad. Ridge teased that he'd heard Steffy and Thomas had visited Los Angeles without seeing him. Ridge wondered if she planned on moving back. Steffy said she wanted to talk to him about Caroline. Steffy wondered what had happened that he had nearly married Katie Logan then ended up with Caroline.\n\n\nSteffy teased that women had fallen in love with Ridge all the time, but she couldn't believe that Caroline had fallen for him. \"She and Rick have the emotions of 8-year-olds,\" Steffy said. She added that they would be back together in no time.\n\n\nRidge wondered what Steffy wanted. Steffy reminded her dad that he had been married to Caroline's aunt long before Caroline had been born. Steffy said it wasn't technically incest, but it was enough to turn stomachs.  \"This needs to end now,\" Steffy demanded. Ridge glared at Steffy.\n\n\nIn Caroline's office, Caroline recalled Ridge showing her designs, and she had added her own touches. They had kissed, and she smiled at the memory. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam updates Bill on the plan against Rick and discusses the possible ramifications and collateral damage if their idea is successful. Caroline finds herself in an awkward situation when Steffy puts her foot down regarding her relationship with Ridge. Wyatt returns home from Italy after making a last-ditch effort to save his marriage. His homecoming is bittersweet for Quinn as he blames her for him coming home empty-handed. Brooke makes her feelings very clear to Ridge regarding his association with Caroline.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill talks gruffly on the phone. He doesn't care about all the particulars, just wants to know when can he get his hands on all the liquid assets. He assures Liam they can have the takeover if they have Steffy's shares this afternoon. Liam reminds him that he is not sure Steffy will sell but she has gone to see Ridge so maybe she will get a good look at how things are at FC now and will want to sell. Bill says even with her shares that is not enough to have controlling interest but Liam adds others will follow her lead and then they will. Bill says they need damage control. Brooke will not like that her son is being dethroned at the same time her daughter is gone ..and although he hates to say it he flatters himself that she will not like seeing Bill as a married man. Liam is happy that Bill has proposed to Katie but it is not official until he gives her a ring. Bill guffaws that he did and it wasn't a shoe string around her finger either. Quinn is moping around and questions Deacon why there is never any food in the frij .can't he buy groceries every now and then Mr. Take Out. He placates by saying he will go get some and when he opens the door there is Wyatt about to knock. He's hesitant but comes in and Quinn is happy to see him, even offers him a quick bowl of soup she had just made herself. Of course she asks if Hope is with him. He is angry and mumbles no, this would be the last place she would want to come. Steffy lets Caroline know that she is a typical New Yorker whatever that means and by no means does she like her with her father. That is simply unacceptable. Brooke looks in on Ridge and remembers what she just told Caroline that she could have Ridge any time she wanted him. Ridge is used to Brooke trying to undo Rick's damage wherever he goes. Instead she asks him about him and Caroline. Ridge is disappointed that Katie is back with Bill. Brooke asks if RJ was ever with Ridge when he saw Caroline. She really doesn't want to confuse him. One thing she knows is that Caroline and Ridge will not be together. Ridge asks if this visit has a purpose as he has lost track. Brooke says against her best efforts she has not been able to get Caroline and Rick back together. She does not know if there is anything left between them but she knows Maya is not challenging enough. She does believe that Caroline would be more appropriate. Ridge laughs when Brooke says she gets along with everyone. Ridge is not sure his own mother would agree to that but may turn over in her grave. Brooke says she would like to change a few things and suggests she fix dinner one night for him and RJ; Ridge agrees. Quinn tells Wyatt that she fears for saying anything that will make him angrier. She knows now she should have listened to Wyatt and stayed away from Hope. She thinks Wyatt probably put too high a value on Hope and Quinn too high on Wyatt. Now Hope has turned her back on him and is blaming him for the miscarriage. She blames Quinn too but not for that. Deacon tries to say something but Wyatt does not want to her his opinion. Deacon merely says Hope did want Quinn to stay away but that did not cause her to fall. Awful things happen to people but they need to learn to forgive each other and move on. Liam tells Bill that he knows he does not like associating with Ridge so they need to be careful and not have Steffy think they are going to sideline her father. Ridge and Steffy reunite and hug. He asks her if she is moving back. He realizes she sneaks into town sometimes without telling anyone. He knows that she and her brother are clearly mad at him. She says yes because of Katie Logan but she wants to talk about Caroline. This can not go forward. Rick and Caroline are acting like eight year olds right now but will be back together in six weeks. She points out that Ridge was married to Caroline's aunt before she was even born ..so even if it is not exactly incest it is enough to make your stomach turn and it has to end right now! Wyatt points out that they all tried to make something work that wasn't meant to be. Hope stayed with him because of the baby not for him. Quinn does not feel he should have any regrets though. Deacon won't let them be so hard on themselves. And Quinn admits none of this is Deacon's fault and without him she would not have been able to get through this. Wyatt bemoans that he feels like he has been chewed up and spit out by all in the Forrester family. But he does not have to be liked. He will just do his job and support Ivy's line. Liam asks Bill if he can discuss this with anyone with the last name of Forrester. Bill says absolutely not, not even Ivy .or Steffy so do not romanticize about anything right now. He says he is not even going to tell Katie. Some people believe you don't keep secrets in a marriage but he is not one of them. Bill just wonders if Liam's sudden desire to take over FC has anything to do with Hope. He lost the girl but he could keep the line that bears her name.",
