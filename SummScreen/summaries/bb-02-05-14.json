Donna interrupted and asked what had made Katie so happy. Katie said the day had been like a break in the weather. Katie said she had spent the day away from the office. Donna worried that Katie had gone back to Bill.\n\n\nKatie assured Donna that Bill was not in her life. Donna wondered if Katie had met a new guy. Katie smiled. Donna and Katie discussed that it had been a long time since Katie had been happy and enjoyed time away from the office. Donna happily offered her babysitting services -- overnight if necessary.  Later, Katie flashed back to her day with Ridge, and she smiled.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Pam walked in on Quinn, and Quinn accused Pam of causing trouble for Wyatt. Pam insisted that Hope deserved to know the truth about what Wyatt had done.  Wyatt entered, and Pam left. \n\n\nQuinn quizzed Wyatt about Hope. Quinn insisted that Wyatt had to tell Hope that it had all been a publicity stunt, and she kept telling Wyatt how to salvage his relationship with Hope. Quinn insisted that she and Wyatt had to find Hope and prevent her from spending time with Liam.\n\n\nWyatt warned his mother to stop interfering. Wyatt related that Hope had given him one more chance. Quinn worried about Liam's hold on Hope. Wyatt told Quinn to back off. Wyatt said that he needed to worry about his relationship with Hope -- not Liam. Wyatt advised Quinn to stop trying to fix things.\n\n\nWyatt said that his trip with Hope had been a big step forward in their relationship until Liam had shown up and told Hope the truth about the diamond heist. Wyatt refused to take anything for granted. Quinn worried about Liam's interference. Wyatt gave Quinn a final warning to stay out of his affairs. Wyatt left, and Quinn made a call.  \"I have a job for you,\" she said on the phone, \"his name is Liam Spencer.\"\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Hope entered, and Liam asked if Hope was okay. Liam said that Wyatt and Quinn had fooled everyone. Hope said that she had talked to Rick about Wyatt. Hope looked distant, and Liam asked why Hope still had Wyatt's necklace on.\n\n\nLiam worried that Wyatt didn't respect Hope. Hope said that Wyatt had made a mistake, and she had forgiven him.  Liam was stunned. Liam noted that Wyatt and Quinn had performed criminal acts -- specifically fraud. Hope begged Liam not to tell anyone because it would ruin Forrester's image. Liam promised to keep it a secret.\n\n\nLiam couldn't believe that Hope was going to forgive Wyatt.  Liam was hurt, and he realized that Hope had no plans to fire Wyatt and Quinn. Hope apologized to Liam. She added that she and Wyatt were not living together, but she did plan to stay in a relationship with Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam was shocked, and he warned Hope not to trust Wyatt. Hope said that she wanted to try to work things out with Wyatt. Hope insisted that Wyatt had changed since he had been with her. Liam was visibly hurt, and Hope said that she hadn't meant to hurt Liam. She felt staying with Wyatt was the right thing to do. \"Okay,\" Liam said, \"tell me why you're doing this.\"\n\n\nHope tearfully said that she felt she could trust Wyatt. She said she had to leave, and Liam grabbed her hands. He begged her to stay, but Hope gently pulled her hands away. She said that she and Wyatt were in a relationship, and they were going to try to work things out.\n\n\nLiam insisted that Wyatt would drag Hope into another scandal. Liam wondered if Hope was still worried about Steffy. Hope was quiet. She said she felt committed to Wyatt. Liam emotionally turned away. Hope hugged Liam, and tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam eagerly awaits word from Hope about whether or not she is ending her relationship with Wyatt. Quinn confronts Pam about breaking her promise of keeping Wyatt\u2019s secret between the two of them. Katie debates whether or not to confide in Donna her growing feelings towards Ridge. Wyatt sets boundaries with Quinn about her meddling in his personal life.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is smiling and thinking back on her and Ridge's reciting sonnets at the park. Donna walks in and says if housework makes her this happy she can come over to her place anytime. Quinn tells Pam that she thought she was her friend. Pam chuckles that Quinn tried to buy her loyalty with a manicure and crumb cake. And what Wyatt did was not just a little prank, but dangerous and destructive. Wyatt comes in and this is the first he's seen his mother since returning from the road trip. She asks if he has seen Hope and he says he just did. Pam chastises him a bit and then tells him what he did was wrong and both Liam and Hope deserved the truth. Quinn is relieved to hear that Rick would have fired them but he left it up to Hope and she is giving them another chance. He tells his mom only one more chance. This could have been the end for them as Hope is furious. To hear Liam tell it they were out to con the whole world and drag Hope down with them. It was dishonest. Quinn says Liam intends to get Hope back. They must go find her. Wyatt says no more. He was trying to impress Hope and Quinn was running interference on Liam but it almost backfired. They screwed up and he almost lost her and he is not going to be put in that position again. He tells her from now on they are going to be model citizens. And if she can't control herself to do that, then he says he means it, no more trying to fix things. Hope gave him one more chance and he's not going to blow this. He's grateful for that chance. She says okay, so it's like he's on probation. But she does not want him to let up on Liam or move his and Hope's relationship backward. Wyatt says he's not, the trip actually moved it forward. But he has no time to think about Liam. He has to focus on Hope, nothing else. Hope is his future and she has not given up on them. So he does not need Quinn playing Mother Lion anymore. She needs to hear that. Hope lets herself into Liam's and surprises him. He asks if she is all right. She says yeah she just came back from the beach and went to see her brother. He says Wyatt had them all fooled but at least it's over now. Then he notices her necklace and wonders why she has it back on. Slowly she says Wyatt made a mistake and he was just trying to help. Liam is astonished that she forgave him as Wyatt jeopardized everything she cared about - her line and her reputation.. She says they are going to try and work through this. Liam says Wyatt doesn't deserve another chance. What Wyatt did was criminal, it was fraud. If this gets out FC would be implicated and so would Hope. She wants to be sure that Liam is not going to say anything. He says of course not; he knows how much her reputation means to her. She says she did not come here to talk about Wyatt or his mom. Liam continues \u0096 she can't stay with him. Hope says they are not living together; she is staying with her mom. But they are not breaking up. He shakes his head and says okay but give him a reason that she can not walk away right now. She tries to make Liam see that Wyatt is a changed man since he is with her. He's not ever going to do anything like this again. She apologies and says she did not come here to hurt him. She just thought it was the right thing to do to tell him in person after all they have been through. He says again that Hope can not trust Wyatt. He gave her a necklace and took her in a road trip, but she does not know him. She brushes a few tears from her eyes and says they have talked it over and she believes she can trust him. They are dating. They are in a relationship and you have to try and work it out. She really thinks they can. Liam says but if it's integrity, you either have it or you don't. He wonders what will happen if Wyatt and his mom drag her into another scandal. She says she won't let that happen. He doesn't know how long she can keep her guard up. She says she feels committed to Wyatt. She thanks Liam for always sticking up for her. She gives him a hug. Quinn picks up the phone and calls someone and says she has a job for him .the name is Liam Spencer.",
