He took her back to her house, telling her he hadn't taken her to the hospital because he had known she had been drinking.  Taylor said drinking had not been what had caused her accident. She explained that she had become so upset after getting a call from Ridge that she had lost control of her car.  \n\n\n\n\nHector knew Taylor was going through a rough time but warned her not to rely on alcohol as a crutch.  She assured him she would not let it get out of hand.  Hector told her she needed to focus on something else besides the end of her marriage and encouraged her to start working at a shelter he knew about.  Taylor let Hector know she appreciated him being there for her during such a scary period of her life.  \n\n\n\n\nHector attempted to spend the night with Taylor, but she felt it was too soon.  He kissed her on the cheek and told her she was the most amazing woman he had ever met. He said that since she was free from Ridge, nothing could stop her from doing great things. He hoped one day they would be doing great things together.\n\n\nBrushing her hair in her bedroom, Brooke remembered how Ridge had said he would never let her down again and how he still believed in their love.  Her eyes began to water, but she did not have any hope for them ever being together again.\n\n\nIn Thorne's office, Ridge was thinking about Brooke when Thorne walked in.  Immediately, Ridge began bragging about how his trip to Europe had boosted sales.  He managed to belittle Thorne's job performance at the same time.  Ridge said he had lost Taylor because he had been in Europe, covering Thorne's butt. Thorne denied Ridge's accusation and said Ridge had not lost Taylor; he had walked out on her for Brooke and was only upset because he did not have either of them.  \n\n\n\n\nThorne grew insecure and went on the defensive with Ridge stating again that Ridge had led a charmed life and had always been the favorite son, while Thorne had been the underdog. Thorne said he no longer felt like a loser because he had a loving wife and child to go home to, while Ridge had nothing.  Ridge tried to blame everything on Stephanie again, but Thorne refused to listen to that \"lame\" excuse and said Ridge had no one to blame for his miserable life except himself.  Ridge angrily left Thorne's office.\n\n\nBack in his office, Ridge gave Brooke a call, finding out R.J. was sick.  Ridge insisted on picking up the prescription and taking it over.  After the baby was asleep, Ridge complimented Brooke on how good she was with R.J.  He told her she could call him anytime she needed him.  Brooke told him she was glad that he had stopped to help with R.J., but that did not mean that she wanted him back.  \n\n\n\n\nRidge said he knew the difference between a mother needing help and a woman letting him back into her life.  Brooke said she was wrong to be so hard on him because romantic love did not last except in novels.  Ridge disagreed and said their love would last forever. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Thorne gives Ridge what-for over his attitude towards his life lately, but Ridge doesn't want to listen to anything his little brother has to say. Later, he swings by the pharmacy to pick up medication for an ailing R.J., and uses the opportunity to again try to convince Brooke that she needs to take him back. Hector is there to save Taylor after her car goes off the road, and luckily she isn't seriously injured. He encourages her to find something to fill her life with that will let her forget about Ridge.\r\n",
