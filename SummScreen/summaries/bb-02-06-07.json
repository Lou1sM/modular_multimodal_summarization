    "imdb": "\nOnly Brooke makes a drama of Ridge's phrase to 'kill' Rick if he touches Phoebe. Stefanie is only pleased she's apparently over Shane, but worries why Hope visits Nick, even if she won't model for him. Rick is conferring with Nick, who already plans his East coast retail take-over, Harvey's chain. Ridge and Brooke can't agree how to handle their adolescent kids' possibly budding affair, which isn't even happening.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Yvette begs off answering Stephanie as her plane is waiting. She wishes the Forrester's the very best. Stephanie leaves with the thought that the fashion business is a cut-throat business and she is surprised Nick hasn't learned that yet. Nick and Jackie plan their future strategy. Phoebe tells Rick that she won't stand to be treated \u0091that way'. He can be an irritant like a big brother would be, only he isn't her brother. He's left stunned. Brooke thanks him, but Rick repeats what Ridge told him, if he ever crossed the line about his daughter, he would kill him. She fills him in on Shane McGrath, but assures him Ridge has no right threatening Rick. In fact, she encourages Rick to spend more time with Phoebe in getting to know each other. Stephanie tells Ridge about Yvette and she feels something is not quite right. Brooke questions Ridge about his statement to Rick and he proudly admits he said it and meant it. He knows guys and thinks their relationship, whatever it is, will be trouble. He will NOT support a relationship between the two and he prefers they not live under the same roof. No more duets or star-gazing, is that understood? Brooke will not accept threats and ultimatums, not with her family. Rick is only venting his frustration. And she will not tell him what happened between Nick and Bridget. Does Ridge understand that? Rick drops in on Nick and is grateful for some new things that Nick has implemented with the International group.",
