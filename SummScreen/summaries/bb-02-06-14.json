He said he could be adaptable after they'd done so many things his way, and that night, they'd have a romantic evening at home.\n\n\nWyatt considered the evening to be his chance to apologize for what he'd done, and he assured Hope that he'd never keep anything from her again. As they had wine, Hope told Wyatt that she'd seen Liam to let him know that she was in a relationship with Wyatt and wanted to work things out with him. She said she was with Wyatt because it felt good, and he made her happy.\n\n\nHope relayed that because she knew Wyatt, his diamond theft had made bizarre sense to her, and though it hadn't been a deal breaker, she cautioned him not to do anything like it ever again. She insisted that she couldn't be with a man who did those types of things, no matter how sexy he was. \"You think I'm sexy?\" Wyatt asked, and he and Hope kissed.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that he'd been scared when he'd thought he'd lost Hope, but he promised to be on his best behavior from then on. Hope replied that his mother was a factor, too, but Wyatt insisted that he'd talked to his mother, and she wouldn't be a problem. Hope was uncertain that Quinn would listen; however, he said that Quinn was done, and there would be no more tricks or manipulations.\n\n\nWyatt remarked that he liked \"this clean slate stuff\" because it gave him a chance to curb his impulses. Hope stated that she liked his impulsiveness, but he had been born from a questionable gene pool that pulled him toward the dark side.\n\n\nWyatt felt that it gave him reason to try to be better. He conveyed that he had a lot at stake and someone to live up to. He'd gone through life with no ties and nothing to lose, but he'd since realized how empty he'd been until Hope.  He never wanted to be that person again, and he also never wanted to hurt Hope on a whim. Hope replied that it was all behind them.\n\n\nWyatt felt that Hope's belief in him gave him reason to live. Hope smiled, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Quinn met with Aly. Quinn complimented Aly's shoes, and Aly asked why Quinn had wanted to see her. Quinn replied that Liam needed Aly.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to catch up before talking about Liam and asked how Aly was doing at Forrester. Quinn noted that Aly wanted her own shoe line and asked if Aly had pitched it to Eric. Aly said that she was nowhere near ready, but Eric seemed to be on board with the idea. Quinn offered to put a good word in for Aly with Eric, and Quinn also offered to be there whenever Aly needed her.\n\n\nAly appreciated the offer but said Quinn hadn't called her there for motivational advice. Quinn stated that Liam was having a hard time because Hope was with Wyatt, and Liam needed a friend to support him. Aly stated that Liam already knew she was a friend and would be there for him. Quinn said that she didn't think Liam knew that Aly was interested in him.\n\n\nAly became bashful, but Quinn said that Aly and Liam would make a good match. Quinn was sure Liam would get over Hope, and something might develop for Aly. Aly thought that Quinn was clearly looking out for Wyatt. Quinn, however, said that she wasn't suggesting anything inappropriate, but she wouldn't be surprised if things went somewhere with Liam and Aly.\n\n\nAly shook her head shyly, but Quinn urged Aly to see how beautiful she was. Quinn just thought Aly should enhance what she had. Aly wondered if Quinn thought there could be a chance for Aly and Liam, and Quinn affirmed that she did think it.\n\n\nGetting an idea, Quinn called Spencer Publications and pretended to Adele that Aly was supposed to meet Liam for dinner. \"At Bikini?\" Adele replied. Quinn thanked Adele, and after the call, Quinn excitedly told Aly that she'd go to Bikini after Quinn helped Aly get ready. Aly asked if Quinn was a good or bad witch. \"I'm versatile,\" Quinn replied as she led Aly down to hair and makeup.\n\n\nAt the Bikini Bar, Oliver sat with Donovan when Liam arrived. Oliver guessed that Liam was gloomy because of Hope. Liam stated that just when he thought he knew what Hope would do, she did the opposite. Liam explained that Wyatt had done something bad, but Hope had bought Wyatt's \"I did it for you; I did it for love\" sob story.\n\n\nDonovan took off for a date, and Liam pitied himself for being alone with Oliver. Oliver stated that he'd been told that he was good company. Liam asked who'd said that. Oliver decided not to reveal who'd said it because he didn't want to jinx the new relationship.\n\n\nOliver asked if Liam was ready to move on from Hope, but Liam said that Hope was the only woman alive for him. Though Liam admitted he was a little jealous, he was insistent that nothing good could come of Hope being around the Fullers. Oliver asked if the Fullers were really that bad.\n\n\nLiam asserted that the Fullers had already proven it, and he prattled off all the things that Wyatt and Quinn had done to Liam and his relationship with Hope. Oliver understood why Liam was concerned but doubted that the Fullers would let Liam mess up the good thing they had going. Oliver said Liam would look as if he was picking on Wyatt if Liam wasn't careful about how he approached it.\n\n\nLiam felt that Hope was too sensible to fall for Wyatt's ploys, but because Wyatt had made himself a student of all things Hope, she couldn't see Wyatt for who he really was. Oliver was sure Wyatt was presenting a front to Hope.\n\n\nLiam wished he could stop the Fullers, but Oliver said that Hope was a woman who made her own choices. Oliver advised Liam to let things run their course. Liam insisted that Wyatt and Quinn were dangerous, and he had to get Hope away from them.\n\n\nOliver cautioned Liam to think before he acted and try to catch Wyatt off guard. Liam agreed that doing so would be the only way to show Hope the truth about Wyatt.\n\n\nOliver left Liam to pay the bar tab, and as Liam paid, he noticed a woman with long, slender legs enter the bar. He was amazed to see that it was Aly, and she smiled at him.\n\n\nLiam asked if Aly was having dinner there that night. Aly replied that she was there for a quick bite. He offered to sit with her -- unless she was meeting someone. She informed him that she wasn't, but he didn't have to hang out with her. Liam grabbed a table and asked if she was trying to get rid of him. She replied that she'd never do that. \"Good, because you are already making me feel better,\" Liam replied, and Aly blushed. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Tired of his constant interference, Quinn creates a diversion to lure Liam\u2019s attention away from Wyatt and Hope. Wyatt plans a romantic evening for Hope to sincerely apologize for not being completely forthcoming with her about the jewelry heist. Aly is the recipient of a glamorous makeover, but unaware of the purpose for it. Oliver gives Liam advice regarding Hope.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt prepares his beach house for Hope's arrival. He makes sure the fire is going, the candles lit, flowers arranged and their table set. She comes in and he greets her. He is glad she likes and says he is showing her that he can be adaptable. They were unplugged living in the trailer so he thought tonight would just be a romantic evening in his home. He gives her a pink rose and they kiss. He says it is just a small token of affection and an apology for taking the diamond. It was a stupid prank from the start and then he should have told her and he will never keep anything from her again. Oliver chats with Donovan, a surfing instructor, at Bikini Bar and they tease each other about being around beautiful models all day. Liam walks in and Ollie invites him to come and have a brew, from the looks he has Hope on his mind. Liam says they have no idea how bad he needs a drink. Just when he thinks he knows Hope she goes and does the opposite. He tells them that he found out something that he thought would send her running in the opposite direction but somehow Wyatt talked her out of it. And she bought it and they are probably together right now. Rachel brings in a few papers for Quinn and tells her there is someone to see her. It's Aly. Quinn immediately compliments her shoes. And she will even be happy to put in a good word with Eric if Aly would like to work on her own brand of shoes. A little shy, Aly asks Quinn what does she want. Quinn says Liam needs her. Quinn says Hope is with Wyatt now and she happens to know Liam is going through a very hard time and he could use a friend to support him. Aly says she already is his friend. Quinn wants to be blunt. She knows Aly is nuts about Liam and she doesn't have to be embarrassed about that. They make a cute match. She says she is never wrong about these things. And one day Hope ad Liam will be over and it will sink in and Liam will move on. Aly could be there when that happens. Aly tells her no offense but she knows Quinn is all about Wyatt getting what he wants. Quinn says yes but she did not mean romantically for Liam, but just be there. And if anything happened in the future that would be her call ..and she wishes her luck and says she would not be surprised. Quinn asks her if she's looked in the mirror lately \u0096 that flaming red hair and gorgeous big blue eyes. She just needs to enhance it a bit. She arranges to find where Liam is and then tells Aly they will go to makeup and wardrobe and do some magic. Aly wonders if she is a good witch or a bad witch. Quinn remarks that she is versatile so come on, this is gonna be fun. Liam and Ollie continue to commiserate. Ollie asks if Liam is looking for company. Is that why he came in here tonight. Liam says no; hope is still the only woman alive for him. It's excruciating that she is with Wyatt, not just because of the jealousy thing with brothers and all. He really thinks the Fullers are bad people and nothing good can come of it. Hope tells Wyatt that she saw Liam earlier tonight. He asks how did that go. Hope says it was a little painful and she's really not even comfortable talking about him now. But she did tell him they they are in a relationship and that means forgiveness and working things out and that is exactly what they are going to do. She confesses the reason she is here is because it feels so good. This time with him, he makes her feel very happy. He says that was his goal all along. She says even when he explained about taking the diamond, it made sense in a bizarre way but he has to know that he can never do anything like that again because she can not be with a man who would lie and scam his way into things no matter how sexy he is. He almost blushes when he realizes she thinks he is sexy. She says yes she does and pulls him into a kiss. Ollie tells Liam to be careful. He can't go barreling in making accusations. It will only make it look like he is picking on Wyatt. Wyatt must be saying all the right things. Liam says if he only knew. Wyatt has been a student of Hope ever since he met her and Hope is too trusting. Wyatt is gonna hurt her. Ollie reminds him that Hope is a grown woman and can make her own choices so he'd let it just take it's natural course of events. Liam says he is afraid he can't let it get to that point. He has to get Hope away from both of the Fullers. Wyatt tells Hope it was a scary moment when he almost lost her. But it will never happen again as he is going to be on his best behavior. Hope says it is his mother too; she takes things a little far. Wyatt says he is aware and has told her so ..model citizens from here on out, no more interfering. Hope says she realizes Quinn can be a little OCD when it comes to Wyatt and he's accepted that. Wyatt says she won't be a problem anymore, no more manipulations or tricks. Oliver leaves and Liam is about to leave too when he spots a totally hot Aly walking in. He goes over and tells her that she looks beautiful. He finds out she came here to eat so he invites himself too as he has not eaten. He selects them a table. She tells him that she knows he is going through a hard time so he does not have to do this. He assures her he is feeling better already. Wyatt and Hope cuddle on the couch and kiss. He says he kind of likes this cleaning the slate. It gives him a chance to prove he can curb these natural tendencies to be reckless. She says she likes his spontaneity and his impulsiveness most of the time. He says he just wants to be the kind of guy that deserves a woman liked her. She says he is but he does come from a questionable gene pool calling him to the dark side. She says Bill and Quinn, but he says that is just DNA and he can rise above that. That gives him a reason that he has never had before, but now there is something ..someone at stake to live up to. Before he had nothing to lose and he never realized until now how empty that was. He doesn't want to be that guy anymore. She says she is rooting for him and that is all behind them now. She leans in for another kiss and they hold each other tightly.",
