    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke demanded to know what was going on with Ridge and Quinn and what Quinn wanted to keep from Brooke. Ridge agreed that he and Quinn were keeping something from Brooke, and it had started out as a surprise. He said that a bride needed a dress and jewelry, and Quinn and Ridge had planned to surprise Brooke for the wedding.\n\n\n\"Okay...\" Brooke slowly said. She said it again quickly, as if deciding to accept the answer she'd gotten. She was sorry she'd ruined the surprise and emphasized that the situation was just weird. Quinn suggested Brooke pretend she hadn't heard anything. Brooke said she'd try.\n\n\nBrooke left, and Quinn said it had been close. Agreeing, Ridge replied that he didn't like doing what he'd just done, so Quinn had to stop being paranoid and guilty about \"everything.\" Quinn was trying. She mentioned all the instances of flirting. She said it had been going on for too long and wondered what was wrong with her. Ridge said to stop beating herself up.\n\n\nRidge concluded that nothing had changed. Quinn was married to Eric, and Ridge was going to marry Brooke. Quinn stated that it wouldn't happen again, and Ridge agreed. \"I just -- \" Quinn said. Ridge interjected that she just needed to pull herself together, and the kiss had merely been a moment in time. Quinn agreed that was all it had been. \"Right, Ridge?\" she asked.\n\n\nQuinn was worried because she'd never had so much to lose or live up to. She didn't want to give Eric reason to doubt her, but she had. Ridge said no one knew, and Quinn should take it easy. She thought she needed to sort it out so she could be better or stronger. Ridge suggested she forget about it like he had. She claimed not to think about it, either, except in an abstract way as she vied to understand her own behavior.\n\n\nRidge asked why Quinn would analyze something that meant nothing to either of them \"unless...\" Quinn quickly stated that it had meant nothing to either of them. Ridge concluded that it was good and changed the subject to people calling to congratulate him on his new position.\n\n\nRidge felt that he had Quinn to thank for it. Quinn said she didn't need thanks. She said she was happy to be a part of healing the amazing family that she'd somehow stumbled into. As she spoke, Quinn cupped her forehead, looked down, and sighed. Ridge asked if she was okay. She claimed she was and said she and Eric were very happy. She didn't want to screw it up.\n\n\nQuinn felt that she always screwed things up because she was a bad person and her own worst enemy. Ridge noted that she was revving herself up again. Quinn was terrified that she'd let Eric down. She didn't believe she deserved the good things in her life, so she feared she'd be compelled to destroy them. \"Or you could just live your life,\" Ridge reasoned.\n\n\nRidge said Quinn could just go home to Eric and make him happy, and as it had turned out, she was good at it. Ridge told her that she was the best person she could be, which was all anyone could do. He asked her to let go of the silly, self-fulfilling prophecy that everything she touched would fall apart. \"You -- you are -- you're fine. Everything's gonna be fine,\" Ridge stated.\n\n\nQuinn was awed by Ridge's supportive, gentle, and concerned demeanor. She said his encouragement and friendship meant a lot to her -- if that was what it was. She reasoned that he might just be feeling sorry for her, but she'd take support where she could get it. Ridge replied that he didn't feel sorry for her, and she didn't need his support. In Ridge's view, she only needed to believe in and trust herself, and it would be enough.\n\n\nQuinn smiled and said Ridge's words were nice. Ridge noted that her smile was nice, but her shaking hands were a dead giveaway. Taking her hands, he told her to take a breath. He promised that things would be okay. Ridge hugged Quinn, and she relaxed in his arms.\n\n\nIn Brooke's kitchen, Rick happily made himself a sandwich, but his grin faded when he saw Bill walk in and ask what was for lunch. Rick exclaimed that Bill couldn't just walk in at will. \"Sure, I can. I always do,\" Bill responded. Rick said that Brooke was marrying Ridge. Bill quipped that it was a joke that would unfortunately be on Brooke, but he'd piece her back together.\n\n\nAs Rick ate his sandwich, Bill cut his in half and said he'd heard Brooke was back from Italy. He was there to welcome her home. \"This is not your home!\" Rick replied. Bill said it would be, and Rick had better get used to Bill's presence, because Bill would be there for the long haul. Bill sat down to eat, and Rick sarcastically told Bill to be Rick's guest and \"pop a squat.\"\n\n\nRick conveyed that Bill knew how Rick felt about him -- and for good reason. \"Oh, that Maya stuff?\" Bill replied. Bill claimed that had been business, but \"this -- this is family.\" Rick quickly corrected that they weren't family. \"But I will be -- bro,\" Bill responded, placing his hand over Rick's wrist. Rick snatched his wrist away.\n\n\nBill knew Rick wasn't happy about Brooke marrying Ridge -- or about being passed over as CEO again. Rick didn't want to discuss it with Bill. Bill decided to stay on topic and asked Rick if he wanted what was best for his mother. Rick murmured that he did. \"Well, you're looking at him,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nOver beers with Bill, Rick asked how many times Bill had tried to marry Brooke, but it hadn't happened due to Ridge. Bill replied that it had been twice. \"Doesn't that tell you something, Bill?\" Rick asked. Bill felt that he was being tested, and it was new to him.\n\n\nBrooke arrived in the middle of Bill's sentence, and surprised, she asked how Bill had known she was back. Bill claimed he'd felt an ever-so-slight change in the rotation of the earth on its axis, and Brooke grinned.\n\n\nLater, Rick had gone, and Brooke was folding a dishcloth beside the cleaned-off kitchen island. Bill asked how Hope was. Brooke said Hope had changed and was more mature and grounded. Bill stated that it happened to the best of them.\n\n\nBill remarked upon the CEO change at Forrester. Brooke said Ridge deserved it, and Bill replied that the team had been Quinn's idea. He asked if that made sense to Brooke. \"No,\" Brooke flatly replied. Bill thought about what Ridge had said about postponing the wedding until Quinn was out of their lives. \"Doesn't it seem like the opposite is happening? I think Ridge and Quinn are slipping in bed together,\" Bill stated.\n\n\nBrooke scoffed. She mirthlessly chuckled, but her expression indicated that the idea was anything but laughable to her.\n\n\nTraveling looked good on Brooke, according to Bill, but he wanted her to promise that she wouldn't do it again until it was with him. Brooke said he knew she couldn't promise it because she was marrying Ridge. Bill concluded that he'd be there for her when the poser broke her heart, and Bill wouldn't even be mad. Brooke said it was generous of him.\n\n\nBill stated that Brooke was worth it. She was special, and her smile lit up his world. Bill said that Ridge took her for granted, and she'd someday realize that Bill never would. Brooke disclosed that she'd never doubted his feelings for her. He told her that they were real, and after she returned to him, she'd wonder what had taken her so long. Brooke grinned at him.\n\n\nAt Il Gardino, Thomas said the license couldn't be right. He asked if Sally was really Sally Spectra. Sally said that it was her name and not to wear it out. He stated her name again in amazement, and she replied that he was wearing it out. Thomas figured that island life had either been really good to her, \"or...\"\n\n\n\"Macy's my cousin, married to -- \" Sally started to say. Thomas filled in his uncle Thorne's name. Sally said it had ended tragically -- like most entanglements with the Spectras and Forresters. She suggested that they keep their distance because she was sure the last thing Thomas wanted was to associate himself with a Spectra.\n\n\nSally attempted to pay for her drink, but the bartender comped it. Thomas didn't know why he and Sally should avoid each other. She said it was history, and the families were like oil and water. Her family wasn't worthy and lacked Steffy's social media luster. They also lacked Thomas' pedigree and good breeding. The Spectras were scrappers who didn't mind breaking a dirty nail. The families were apples and oranges, and she said, \"Never the twain shall meet.\" She didn't know what a \"twain\" was, but she bet Thomas did.\n\n\nThomas had no idea, and Sally was surprised to hear a Forrester admit to not knowing something. He quipped that he could surprise her quite a bit. She said he was an easy read, and he bade her to read on. Sally concluded that Thomas was conceited, was convinced that he was God's gift to the world, thought women should fall before him, and had never worked a hard day in his life. Thomas had heard it all before but told her to go on.\n\n\nSally was sure the struggle in Beverly Hills was real, as was having to rely on the Forrester family name and good looks to walk through any door Thomas wanted. Thomas asked her to back up to the part about his good looks. Sally admitted that he didn't offend her eyes, but she asserted that he wasn't her type. \"So don't get your hopes up, bucko,\" she told him.\n\n\nSally decided that everyone would know something soon enough, so she'd go on and give Thomas the scoop. Thomas asked what she was talking about. She announced that they'd be rivals because she was reviving Spectra Fashions. \"Seriously?\" he said. To Sally, he sounded skeptical. He asked if she had logistics, infrastructure, or a designer.\n\n\n\"Of course, it's me,\" Sally replied, tugging at the leopard print lapels on her jacket. \"These? May I?\" Thomas asked, grabbing crumpled papers off the bar. He reviewed some rudimentary sketches then asked if she'd done them herself. Sally defensively noted that he was looking at her designs as if they hurt his feelings.\n\n\nThomas replied that they were just different. Sally concluded that he thought they stunk. Thomas smelled the papers and then asked if he'd said that. The sentiment had been in his tone, according to Sally, who said he'd spoken as if her designs could never compare to the Forrester magic. Thomas asked if she was really making a go of Spectra.\n\n\nChest puffed out, Sally proclaimed that she was, and the fashion industry would take notice. She suggested that he buckle up because Forrester had met its rematch. \"With these designs?\" Thomas asked. She glowered at him.\n\n\n\"Good luck,\" Thomas said. Sally snatched her papers away and marched out of the restaurant. Thomas took a swing of her abandoned wine, grimaced, and then smiled to himself.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Thomas is surprised to run into Sally once more at Il Giardino and learns that not only is she carrying the Spectra name, but also wants to follow her namesake's big shoes in the fashion world. After a quick look at some of her design work, he seems not convinced that she will be able to. Quinn and Ridge are put on the spot when Brooke confronts them about what secret they have been hiding from her. Ridge covers by lying that Quinn is creating a piece of jewelry just for their wedding. Alone with Ridge, Quinn later asserts him that Eric means the world to her and that by no means she wants to risk her marriage. Ridge embraces her. Rick grouses when Bill barges into Brooke's house unannounced. Bill assures Rick that he and Brooke will reunite sooner or later given Ridge's track record of breaking her heart.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke wants to know what Quinn is hiding and what is going on between her and Ridge. Rick grouses at Bill that he cannot just come walking into their kitchen any time he wants to. His mom is marrying Ridge so no need for Bill to come around. Bill says Ridge will let her down. He sits and has a sandwich. Rick tells him okay but they are not family. Bill says Rick cannot be happy that Ridge once again is going to be part of his family. Ridge will never stay with her so Bill is as good as it will get. Ridge tells Brooke that this was supposed to be a surprise she is going to have a wedding dress and that needs jewelry, so enter Quinn in what Brooke overheard. Thomas runs into Sally again at the restaurant and finds out she is Sally .Spectra. She says as fabulous as he is it is probably best that she stay away from him, the Forrester's and Spectra's are not known as best buds. They are like oil and water and never the twain shall meet. She sizes him up as someone that women fall over his feet and he's never had to work a day in his life. She tells him he is not her type so don't get his hopes up. But she does tell him they will be rivals, she is taking on Spectra Fashion House again and says she will be the designer. Quinn tells Ridge that was too close so they need to stop feeling guilty about everything. She says she loves Eric so what is wrong with them. He says nothing has changed. She is still with Eric and he is going to marry Brooke so she needs to pull herself together. It was one kiss, a moment out of time and it will not happen again. She laments that maybe she needs to find why she is thinking of it at all. She is just happy to be part of this amazing happy family .Eric and she are so happy and she does not want to screw that up. Rick reminds Bill that he tried to marry Brooke twice and it came down to Ridge, that should tell Bill something. Bill says he has patience. Brooke comes home and finds them and wonders how he knew she was home. When it comes to her, he has radar. They discuss Ridge being CEO now over at Forrester. Seems what Ridge told her before she left is not going to happen. Quinn will not be out of his life, she will be more in it. Thomas looks at Sally's designs and he says they are different. She thinks he thinks they stink like they could never compare to his. She says a new day is coming and the sun is shining, he will have a re-match. He wishes her luck. Bill tells Brooke that she is worth it. Ridge will take her for granted and be gone and Bill won't even be mad. She will come back to him and say what took her so long. Quinn tells Ridge that she has made so many mistakes, she is her own worst enemy. She is so terrified that she will let Eric down and she seems to want to destroy it before that happens. He tells her she needs to let this prophecy go, it's silly. She says he has been very understanding, concerned and even gentle. His encouragement and friendship means a lot to her .if that is what it is. Maybe he just feels sorry for her. He takes her hands, tells her to take a breath and that everything will be okay. He hugs her and she responds.",
