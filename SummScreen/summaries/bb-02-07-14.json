    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Hope and Wyatt made out, and Hope said that he was making the most of his second chance. Wyatt replied that the rest of his life was about making sure she didn't regret giving it.\n\n\nHope liked sharing adventures with Wyatt and asked if he were ready for another trip. A flashback of Hope and Wyatt having sex in the beach tent played on the screen. Hope said that they had a lot to live up to, but he assured her that the trips would get better and better.\n\n\nA song played as a montage of the road trip moved across the screen. Wyatt expressed his happiness to Hope. He said they'd faced the worst, and they were still there. Hope believed it was because she trusted that he'd never do anything like the heist stunt again. He claimed that the new him would never make that kind of mistake. Wyatt promised fun and adventure, and the two began to make out.\n\n\n \n\"Please Keep Melting Me,\" a song by Emily Jayes, played as Hope and Wyatt kissed their way to the bedroom and began to have sex. Wyatt didn't know what he'd done right to have wound up at Big Bear to kiss her awake, but he claimed he'd known that they'd wind up \"here.\"\n\n\nAt the Bikini Bar, the famished Liam ate his food and wondered what Aly thought of him for drowning his sorrows in a bar. Aly stated that there would be no drowning on her watch, and he could consider her a life raft.\n\n\nLiam noted that he'd never seen Aly's going-out look before, and he asked whom she had a crush on.  Aly looked surprised, and Liam assumed she had a crush on a waiter. He offered to kick the guy under the table to help him notice her, but she doubted that the guy in question would notice. Liam insisted that the guy would notice her beauty.\n\n\nLiam switched to drinking water, and Aly told him that he didn't have to do that on her account. He said it was the best thing because, with one more beer, he'd be going on and on about Hope. The conversation shifted to Aly's life.  She explained that Eric was filling in as a father figure. Aly offered to pass a message to Steffy through Thorne, who saw Steffy every day.\n\n\nLiam said that his marriage to Steffy had been precious, but that chapter in his life had closed. He wanted to be with Hope, and he still believed it was possible.\n\n\nAly revealed that she hadn't liked seeing Hope date two men; however, Aly had never expected Hope to choose Wyatt. Liam sensed that Hope felt she had to choose Wyatt because of how far she'd let that relationship go, and Hope probably felt that she was supposed to make it work with Wyatt. Liam said he wouldn't let it stop him because he loved Hope.\n\n\nLiam was sure Hope would see that Wyatt was a \"self-centered jerk,\" and Liam was willing to wait for Hope. Aly warned him not to confuse dislike with a genuinely bad person. Liam asserted that he'd proven that Wyatt was bad, and Liam added that Quinn was even worse.\n\n\nAly agreed that Quinn was intense, and Liam said that Quinn was always working it for her baby boy. Liam claimed that he'd be married had it not been for Quinn, but he and Hope hadn't failed yet. Aly wondered if Hope knew how lucky she was.\n\n\nA text message to Liam interrupted the meal. Katie had scheduled an executive meeting to discuss him. He found that odd and decided that he had to find out what was happening. He thanked Aly for listening and took off.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie and Will were excited when Ridge and R.J. returned for a visit. R.J. joked that Katie had worn Ridge out earlier that afternoon, and Ridge claimed that that there had been a lot of fun and poetry reading. Katie flashed back on the day, and Ridge added that it had been well spent.\n\n\nThe foursome built a fort in the living room, and Ridge suggested that they take their boys to a soccer game. Katie thanked Ridge for spending time with her and Will. She said it was the simple things that reminded her that life wasn't about money and control.\n\n\nR.J. read to Will in the fort, and Katie took care of some quick business. Afterward, Ridge noted that it was cool that she'd wound up running Spencer. Ridge had always thought she'd been driven. The surprised Katie stated that she was used to her family and others thinking otherwise. She figured that her older sisters still believed she was watching and wishing for the lives they'd been leading.\n\n\nRidge stated that Katie had become a woman and a mother, running a company. It was strange to him that he'd known her for so long but felt as if he'd just met her.\n\n\nAs Ridge helped Katie clean up, he received a message that Brooke was home. He decided to drop R.J. off at home. After R.J. went to the car, Ridge asked if Katie wanted to talk about it. She thought he meant soccer game tickets, but he said he knew that she was feeling something. He admitted that he was feeling it, too. To him, she deserved to be admired, appreciated, and desired.\n\n\nRidge pulled Katie in and tempted her to kiss him. Just then, Liam stepped in through the cracked-open front door and caught of glimpse of what was happening. Liam rushed off unseen, and Katie asked Ridge what they were doing. Suddenly, she grew upset and said she couldn't do it to her sister. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam confides in a smitten Aly. Ridge and Katie\u2019s mutual admiration for each other blossoms as they recount how far they have both com following their failed relationships. Wyatt makes a sincere promise to Hope that he will never again break her trust. Hope is torn between her head and her heart on whether to trust Wyatt again.",
    "tvmega_recap": "On the couch, Wyatt and Hope cuddle and kiss. She jokes that someone is making the most of his second chance. He says he'd better. He's going to spend the rest of his life making sure she doesn't regret giving it. He holds her hand and looks at the emerald bracelet and thanks her for putting it back on. He reminds her just how much fun they had at Emerald Bay. She asks if he is ready for another trip. She likes adventures with him. She'd had fun until that last part. She doesn't expect a trip like that every time. That would be a lot to live up to. They remember their lovemaking in the tent on the beach. Wyatt says it will only get better and better. Aly tells Liam that he didn't have to switch to water on her account. He ways yes he did. If he had kept on he would be droning on and on and boring her to death about Hope. She says she is a good listener. She also says if he wants to pass a message along, her dad sees Steffy every day. He thanks her but says no. That marriage was a precious time in his life and he's always going to love her but that chapter is closed in his life. He admits he still wants to be with Hope and he thinks that is still possible. Hope catches Wyatt looking off into the distance with a satisfied look on his face. He says he is just happy. Talk about facing the worst and they did and are still here. She says that is because she trusts him and knows he won't do something like that again. He says he won't. She changed him. The man he is today would never make that mistake again. They are moving on ..more fun ..more adventures. Liam tells Aly that he had no idea he was this hungry. She's glad she ran into him then, making him eat. He admits she probably saved him from a typically embarrassing moment at the bar. Hope chose Wyatt and here Aly finds Liam drowning his sorrows at a bar. She tells him that drowning is not allowed on her watch. He can consider her his own personal flotation device. Liam tells her that she looks amazing. He's never seen her in her \"I'm going out tonight look.\" She wonders if he is worried about her self esteem getting all dressed up for one. He quips that he figures it is one of the waiters here and she can give him a good swift kick under the table and he'll butt out. She thanks him but says doubt he will even notice. Liam says looking like that yes he will. Ridge and RJ show up at Katie's at her request. She says she indeed is not tired of them. She enjoys their time together. RJ says she wore his dad out and he had to take a nap. Ridge says it was all that soccer and poetry reading. They both enjoy crawling around on the floor after Will. Katie says he is good at making forts. Ridge tells her there is more to him than making pretty dresses. And he even suggests to RJ that once the season starts they can take Aunt Katie to a soccer or hockey game. She says they are talking her language now. She has to excuse herself to make a memo for the office. Later she thanks him for being there and taking her to the park. She says mostly it's her family. They don't expect her to grow up, always the youngest. They must think she is weak and needs protection. Ridge says he always thought she was a bit shy but not weak. She is smart and watched her own sisters, saw them make mistakes and learned from them and now making her own decisions. He's not surprised that now she is running a company and he feels like he has known her all her life but just now getting to really know her. Aly tells Liam that she never really liked the fact that Hope was seeing both Liam and Wyatt. It seemed dishonest. But this is even worse now that she has picked Wyatt. Liam says he knows but he thinks there is a tiny part of Hope that feels like she has to because of how far she allowed the relationship to go. She probably feels like she has to make it work with him. He says it's okay. It's clearly not stopping him. A lot of guys would have given up by now and gone and found someone else. But he says he just can't. He loves her. They have been through so many obstacles. This is just one more. Hope won't admit it just yet but Wyatt is a jerk. She's not doing anything about it yet but she has seen a glimpse so Liam says he will just wait. Wyatt and Hope are kissing and wrapped up in each other's arms, backing their way into another part of the house, ripping off clothes as they go. He picks her up and she jumps straddle into his arms as they head to the bed. Aly says it's one thing not to like someone but another to think they are genuinely bad. Liam says maybe but Wyatt is bad. He's proven it and Quinn is even worse. Aly looks guilty when Liam says she will do anything for her baby boy. He says he would be married right now if it weren't for Quinn. But it doesn't matter, she really is only delaying the inevitable. He and Hope haven't failed yet. Liam gets a text and tells Aly that he is sorry to cut this short. But there is a meeting called by Katie about him so he'd better go see what this is about. Wyatt and Hope make beautiful love. He kisses her face, her lips, her neck, her shoulders, her arms and her legs. She can't get enough. He tells her that he doesn't know what he did right up in Big Bear that day. He just remembers looking into those eyes after kissing her awake that day and knowing what was ahead .and now they are here. Katie comes back from putting Will down and finds RJ and Ridge cleaning up. RJ says they mess up, they clean up. Ridge sends him on out to the car so he can talk schedules with Katie. But then he grabs hold of her arm and says they need to talk about it. He knows she is feeling something and he is too. And she deserves to be admired and appreciated and desired. He moves closer and she leans in almost Liam almost walks in on them but ducks back out. Katie backs away and puts her hand across her mouth and says OMG, they can't do this. She cannot do this to her sister.",
