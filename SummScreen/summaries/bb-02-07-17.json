    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill tried to convince her that she still had time to marry him and not Ridge. Bill insisted that Ridge would do something to disappoint her because he always did. Brooke argued that Ridge was her choice. She confessed that her trip to Italy to visit Hope had also been to get away and clear her head to figure out what she wanted out of life and for her future. Bill was hanging on her every word.\n\n\n\"You're not married to Forrester yet,\" Bill said. Brooke argued that she wasn't having doubts, but she added, \"I'll never forget what we shared, Bill.\" She said that some of her times with Bill were among the best moments of her life.\n\n\nBrooke said she had followed her heart in the past and hurt people. She intended to get it right, and the self-analysis had helped her decide what she wanted as her commitment for the rest of her life. Bill grabbed her hand and said he understood. He recalled that one day she had planned to marry him and then had decided to marry Ridge. He called it an emotional roller coaster. Brooke agreed it had been a roller coaster.\n\n\nBill refused to give up on him and Brooke. He regretted that he had left her at the altar when Ridge had shown up at what should have been their wedding -- \"the worst mistake of my life,\" Bill said. He lamented that he had allowed his ego and pride to get in the way. \"I love you, Brooke. I'll never stop loving you,\" he said. Brooke was teary eyed. Bill wanted her to return to him.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, in Steffy's office, Pam and Steffy discussed that a news release looked fine. Thomas entered and asked about the release. Pam said it was the official announcement about Ridge and Steffy as co-CEOs.\n\n\nThomas was not happy. Steffy said she needed to discuss the wedding with him. He asked if she had set a date. She said they had not, but she and Liam wanted him to be in the wedding party. Thomas said, \"Whatever.\" Steffy was surprised he wasn't happy for them.\n\n\nThomas was happy for Liam and Steffy, but he was not happy that the co-CEO situation had transpired and left him out in the cold. Steffy was offended, but Thomas stood his ground. He maintained that Quinn had appointed Steffy to the top spot because Quinn had been trying to get Steffy back together with Wyatt.\n\n\nThomas also didn't understand why Quinn had suddenly changed her mind to make Ridge co-CEO after hating him, but Thomas did understand that Ridge had a proven track record. Steffy was offended that Thomas was basically saying she was not qualified.\n\n\nThomas looked angry. He said his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 had more design while hers was all business. Steffy reminded him that she had gotten the company back from Bill Spencer. She added that her strong social media presence had moved the company in a new direction.\n\n\nThomas argued that it was intangible and could blow over in months. He countered that it was design that made Forrester so successful and was the backbone of fashion.\n\n\nSteffy encouraged Thomas to keep designing, but Thomas saw that as a dead end road. He said he might start his own company. \"Sally Specta's great niece is doing it,\" he said. Steffy snickered that Sally had been kooky.\n\n\nPam entered and said they had to see a video press release with Sally Spectra's great-niece reviving the old company and the building. \"Only one reporter showed up,\" Pam said.\n\n\nOn the television, Pam, Thomas, and Steffy watched young Sally Spectra claim that she had saved the company from the wrecking ball. \"Spectra Fashions is back in downtown L.A.,\" Sally said. Sally claimed she would be true to her great-aunt's fashion roots and wanted to unveil the original logo, but the sign fell and ripped. The reporter tried to help her. Pam and Steffy laughed, but Thomas gave her credit for trying. Pam left, and Steffy and Thomas continued to argue.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that she had paid her dues and had worked her way up from the bottom. \"I don't design pretty dresses,\" she said. Thomas angrily interrupted and said that he had been unfairly passed over and that Steffy didn't get it. He walked out and slammed the door.\n\n\nIn Ivy's office, Liam stopped by while he was waiting to see Steffy, who was in a meeting. Ivy noted that the CEO was always in meetings. Ivy congratulated Liam and said she wanted to hear everything. Liam said that he and his bride wanted a special wedding.\n\n\nIvy suggested Australia because there was nowhere more beautiful, and it was summer in Australia -- the weather was perfect. Liam was intrigued. Liam added that Ridge and Brooke were also getting married. She suggested the Sydney Harbor Bridge because the iconic bridge merged Brooke and Ridge's names.\n\n\nLiam worried that his dad was going to be there and would not be happy to watch Brooke marry Ridge because he was still holding out hope that Brooke would marry him instead of Ridge. Liam maintained that Bill would not give up. \"Don't bet against him,\" Liam said.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Put off by Thomas' sudden chilly attitude towards her, Steffy confronts her brother about his feelings regarding her being appointed CEO. Pam interrupts and shows them Sally Spectra's impromptu press conference on TV. Despite only one reporter covering the relaunch of Spectra Fashion and the event far from being a success, Sally keeps up a bold face. Liam talks to Ivy about marrying Steffy. Ivy then suggests to Liam to marry in her home country Australia - and even better in a double ceremony with Ridge and Brooke. To underline that she is no longer harboring any bad feelings, Ivy volunteers to plan the nuptials. As Bill confesses to Brooke about how much he missed her while she was away, she reveals that one of the reasons why she went to Italy was that she wanted to be sure that she is committing to the right man. Brooke gets misty eyes when Bill implores her to come back to him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells Brooke that Ridge will disillusion her again as always and once again she will be his. Eventually she tells him why she really went to Italy. It was to see Hope, but she also wanted to get away and clear her head and decide what she really wanted in life. In the past she has always followed her heart and she wants to make sure this commitment is something she wants for the rest of her life. Holding her hand he tells her that he would like to spare her all that disappointment. Thomas doesn't seem too enthused when Steffy tells him she wants him to be in the wedding party \u0096 yeah whatever. She realizes it is still the co-CEO thing that he does not like being passed over and now he is holding it against her. She feels that he thinks she is not qualified all by herself, she needs her dad looking out and working with her. Thomas says he is not trying to over blow his importance, but the company was founded on designers and he thinks they need to stick with that and not all the social media. Liam tells Ivy this will be the wedding of the century, no the millennium. Ivy says she knows she is biased but she would like to offer Australia as his wedding site. He's intrigued. But he nixes the idea of Brooke and Ridge marrying there too as Bill will be there and that would be a gut punch to him. Steffy tells Thomas he needs to take a breath and not say something he will regret later. He is an important part of this company, a great designer and she is counting on him. He offers he just might need to find another job, start a house of his own. He even throws in that he met Sally Spectra earlier today and she is back in town and ready to start up Spectra again. Pam rushes in and interrupts and shows them a quick glance of a press conference Sally is holding right now \u0096 big news as she only had one reporter show up. But she is brash and sassy and tells them that singlehandedly she stopped the wrecking ball and will be bringing another panache fashion house to town to compete with that other one. She attempts to display the large logo outside the building only to be foiled while Steffy laughs and Thomas seems amused ..maybe a little sympathetic. Steffy says looks like the apple did not fall far from that tree. She and Thomas continue their argument. He thinks it is unfair that she was offered the job that he worked his whole life for and it just lands in her lap. He leaves abruptly before she can say more. Brooke tells Bill that she understands why he feels the way he does. He says he still blames Ridge but he holds himself responsible too and he never should have left her at the altar. That was a mistake, the worst one of his life. His ego and pride ended up in overdrive and he lost her, but he is not going to lose her for the rest of his life. That is not his ego talking, but his heart. So just say yes. Come back to him.",
