They recall some childhood pranks while they sit on a garden bench together laughing.  Brooke spots them from her balcony, and sports a disapproving look.\n\n\nAt Caf\u00e9 Russe, Nick meets Storm at the bar, and the two discuss a meeting with the elusive distributor, Harvey Golden. Storm has done some checking on Golden, his company and aliases, and isn't sure who he really is, but plans to set up a meeting for Nick. Storm gives Nick a folder of information on Golden, and quickly leaves -- barely greeting Brooke as she enters the bar. Brooke and Nick amiably discuss old times including a time on the island when he tried to teach her something about constellations. She says she will never forget that night, and discusses Rick and Phoebe's similar star-gazing at home. She shares that Ridge is worried about the Rick-Phoebe relationship, but she thinks he's wrong to worry. Nick offers that Rick is a stand-up guy while Ridge is not a man's man \u2013 he's a woman's man.

Eric offers her a car and driver as Ann further negotiates for a new wardrobe and a possible stint as a Forrester model. Eric smiles agreeing to all the terms while Stephanie appears miffed. Later and alone in the den, Pam makes Eric a martini and tearfully thanks him for giving her a life she never even dreamed of.

Later she admits she only went out with Shane to see if Rick cared. They open their hearts as to how they feel about each other. He thinks of her to a certain point and then no further. She's funny and beautiful, she has an inferiority complex, thinks people are smarter and more accomplished than her he's faking it too. He puts his arms around her and gives her a hug, a moment not unnoticed by Brooke. Eric defends Pam, that she is a member of the family and deserves this.
