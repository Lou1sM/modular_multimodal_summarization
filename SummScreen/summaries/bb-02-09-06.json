Felicia reminded Bridget that Dominick was her son.  Felicia took the baby out of the room so that Nick and Bridget could be alone together.  Bridget told Nick that maybe she was not supposed to be anyone's mother.  Nick told her never to say that.  She screamed, \"I just wanted our baby girl, and I can't have her.\"\n\n\nSally received a phone call at the office as Dante and Ridge talked about business.  Sally called Ridge over and told him that there was a problem at the hospital.  She didn't know the details. It was about the baby.\n\n\nBridget started to tell Nick what had happened as the baby had prepared to be born.  She told him that her doctor had had a special group of people there, working on the baby as soon as she had been born. They had tried to save the baby, and then the room had been \"so quiet.\"  She told him that the baby had looked like she had been waiting a lifetime to see them and then just hadn't been able to wait any longer.  \n\n\n\n\nThe doctor walked in, and they told her that they would handle things for the baby.  They would have a private ceremony.  Nick asked to see his baby.  The doctor took him to see his daughter.  \n\n\nOutside Bridget's room, Thorne took little Dominick to the nursery, and Brooke and Eric went in to see Bridget.  Bridget tearfully told her parents that her child was gone.\n\n\nThe doctor and Nick entered the room to see his daughter.  He told the doctor that his daughter was a person, and she had a name.  The doctor sympathetically told Nick that his daughter had had everything but time.  Nick opened the body bag and looked at the little child lying inside.  He sobbed over the baby's body.  Nick told his daughter that she would always be his little girl.\n\n\nJackie, Felicia, Thorne, and Massimo waited outside Bridget's hospital room.  Inside,  Eric and Brooke were with their daughter.  Ridge arrived and saw them waiting.  When he walked up to them, he told them that he'd had a daughter, and she was beautiful, just like her mother.  \n\n\nBridget told her parents that her baby had been a child to her.  Thorne and Ridge entered the room, and Ridge told her that, no matter what, she \"did good.\"  Bridget told Ridge that she loved her little girl \"so very much.\"\n\n\nDante arrived at the hospital and went up to Felicia and Jackie.  Felicia told him what had happened.  Jackie went to the car to wait for Massimo, and Dante turned to Felicia to find out about Bridget's state of mind and how she was physically.  Felicia told him that the baby had just arrived too soon.\n\n\nIn Bridget's room, with everyone there, Nick thanked everyone for being there.  They all agreed that there was nowhere else they would want to be at a time like that.  Eric told Nick that they were all family.  Bridget asked Nick if he had gotten to see his daughter.  He told her that he had, and she was glad.  \n\n\n\n\nBridget told Nick that she felt like part of her was gone.  Bridget lamented that they would never see her again.  Bridget was told that everyone had given a part of themselves to her daughter and a piece of their heart, and she would never be gone as long as they were all together. \n\n\n",
