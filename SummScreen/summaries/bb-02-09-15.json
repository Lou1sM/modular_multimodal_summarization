    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Liam's office, Liam said that he and Steffy would always care about each other. \"Did you just hear what I said? I said I still love you!\" Steffy declared. She refused to sell her family out for Liam's plan unless she and Liam were in it together. \"We will be -- just not like that,\" Liam replied. \n\n\nSteffy muttered that she'd told herself not to \"do this.\" Liam stated that he didn't want things to be hard for Steffy. She said they wouldn't be hard -- because she wasn't going to do it.\n\n\nLiam claimed that he couldn't imagine running Forrester without Steffy. He felt she deserved to finally have control. \"What? If I sell my stock to Spencer? No!\" she exclaimed, wiping away tears. He said the sale was just the beginning. She'd run Forrester, and he'd be by her side, supporting her. \n\n\nLiam said it wasn't just about Ivy. Forrester was falling apart at the seams, and someone needed to stitch it back together. He insisted that the tough and smart Steffy was the leader they needed. She'd never allowed anyone to intimidate her, not even Bill. Liam said she inspired people, and she was a fighter. He implored her to agree and become \"the most badass CEO\" the industry had ever seen.\n\n\nSteffy didn't doubt she could do it; her problem was seeing Liam each day. Liam said Ivy shouldn't preclude Steffy from taking the job. Steffy stated that she and Liam had been about to have a family and a future. She wanted to run Forrester more than anything, but she couldn't do it with Liam. \n\n\n\"You really didn't know this?\" Steffy asked. Liam said she'd never let on. She conveyed that his life had gone on, and she'd allowed him to believe hers had, too. \"Maybe now it can,\" she concluded. Liam said he'd never forget what they'd shared, and the memories were just as important to him.\n\n\nA flashback of their times together played. Liam said it was good to remember. Steffy agreed but still couldn't help Liam. She stated that Ridge could become CEO once Rick's contract expired. Liam thought a year was a long time, but Steffy believed it would go faster than he thought. \n\n\nSteffy apologized for unloading on Liam and decided to leave. Liam hugged her, and after she left, he seemed to wonder what he'd do next. Outside his door, Steffy sobbed. \n\n\nAt Ridge's place, Caroline kissed Ridge and asked if the beautiful painting was how he saw her. He said it was how he wanted her to see herself. She asked him to show her more. Caroline reclaimed her seat by the fire, and as Ridge posed her again, he stroked her face and neck. \n\n\nCaroline cupped Ridge's hand in hers and froze when she saw the emerald wedding ring on her finger. Ridge and Caroline exchanged glances, and she slid the ring off her finger. \"It's time,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge resumed painting, and the sketch became alive with gray, white, and black hues, which together created a fully textured black and white portrait of Caroline, barely peeking over her shoulder at her long, alabaster backside. Caroline said the work was beautiful, but she was confused.\n\n\n\"When you said you wanted to paint me, I thought you wanted to paint me,\" Caroline uttered. The limp sheet around her naked body fell to the floor. Sensual music played. Ridge dipped his brush into the black paint and stroked it over her shoulders and collarbone. They kissed, and by the fireplace, they slinked down to the floor. With their fingers, they smeared paint lines on each other. The lines blurred as Ridge pressed down upon her and kissed her. \n\n\nLater, Ridge sat in front of the sofa with Caroline in his arms. Wrapped in a sheet, her back rested on his naked thigh. She said that, if moving on felt like that, then she should have done it sooner. Ridge decided that he wanted to paint her again. He wanted to paint her, draw her, and sculpt her. Before, Ridge had only wanted to create beauty, but from that time forward, he wanted to appreciate it. \n\n\nAt the mansion, Aly wondered how to get Rick's attention on her shoe line. Oliver offered to wear a pair of size twelve designs to get Rick's attention.\n\n\nIvy arrived, but as she headed upstairs, Aly warned that Rick and Maya were up there. Ivy joined the couple in the living room and began sewing studs on a shirt. Aly and Oliver were shocked to see Ivy sewing. Ivy said Maya wanted studs on a shirt she'd planned to wear the next day. All the seamstresses at Forrester had gone home for the night, so Rick had asked Ivy to be a \"team player\" and help. \n\n\nIn the bedroom, Rick and Maya made out and joked about their sex sessions running the other Forresters out of the house. Rick received a call from Eric, and only Rick's side of the conversation played on-screen. Rick told Eric that things were fine. \"The gun? Oh, that was dumb,\" Rick said. Rick claimed that everything was better, and there was no reason for Eric to rush back to Los Angeles. \n\n\nAfter the call, Maya mentioned that she could go for some ice cream. Rick buzzed the living room, and Aly answered. Aly remarked that she was working on her shoe designs. Rick said he'd actually been considering her line but couldn't think on an empty stomach. He frowned and rolled his eyes at Maya, indicating that a he couldn't care less about the line, and the two laughed.\n\n\nAly was confused by the laughter, and in a straight voice, Rick said he was hungry but too comfortable with Maya to leave to get some ice cream. \"You want me to bring you some ice cream?\" Aly flatly asked. Rick said it would be a great idea, and he wanted three scoops and two spoons. He clicked off the line, and he and Maya resumed their laughter. \n\n\nLater, Aly arrived, carrying the ice cream on a bed tray. She almost shrank from the room when she saw Rick and Maya huddled together beneath a crumpled bed sheet. The two beckoned Aly into the room. When she set down the tray, she hugged the shoe design she'd had tucked beneath her arm. \n\n\nAly displayed the sketch, but Rick absently thanked her as he and Maya fed each other ice cream. He claimed he'd look at it after the dessert because he didn't want the ice cream to melt. Aly slapped the sketch down on the bed and strode out. Maya and Rick chuckled. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Following Liam\u2019s reaction to her confession, Steffy instructs Liam that there is only one way that she will go along with his plan against Rick. Rick and Maya play puppet master with Aly, giving her false hope of greenlighting her proposed collection. Ivy becomes fed up with the poor treatment that she and Ivy have been receiving at home from Rick and Maya. Ridge assists Caroline in moving on from her marriage in a very romantic and artistic manner.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam says good God what they have been through so they will always love each other. Steffy says she is IN love with him. She can not be in this unless they are in this together. He says they will but not like that. She says she will not be part of it. She will not sell our her family just so he can play hero for his new girlfriend. Aly shows Oliver her shoe designs. He quips to let her make him a pair in size 12 and that will get Rick's attention. Ivy starts to go upstairs and Aly stops her by saying Maya and Rick are upstairs so probably needs some privacy. Eric calls and Rick lies to him and says everything is fine and he has everything under control. Rick and Maya both laugh when Rick calls down and cons Aly into bringing them some ice cream. They laugh at her again when Rick makes Aly come into the room with them in bed to hand them the ice cream. Then Rick dismisses her when she wants to show him the shoe sketch saying he will do it later. She wants to hurl. Caroline tells Ridge to show her more when he says how beautiful she is. They clasp hands and she looks down at her wedding ring and takes if off and says it is time. Liam tells Steffy that he came to her because he can not imagine him running FC without her. They argue. He says she will run the company but he will be there to support her. He reminds her that FC is falling apart at the seams and someone needs to get in there and stitch it back together. She can inspire them with her attitude, her energy and talent. And she's a fighter so just please say yes. They can make it happen. She will be the most bad-ass this industry has ever seen. She says she wants that more than anything but she can not do that after the future they had planned and now he has moved on not only from Hope but is with Ivy now. Yet her love has not stopped. Caroline tells Ridge that she likes the sketch of her but she thought he wanted to paint her. She drops her towel. He takes his brush and some of his fingers and dips them in the paint and does make bold lines over her neck and upper torso. He kisses her. Then he lays her on the couch and she finger-paints his neck and chest. He says all his life he wanted to paint beauty and now he just wants to appreciate it. He says she is fantastical. Liam muses to Steffy that all those memories are just as important to him and he will not forget them. It's good to remember. She says yes but that is not why he called her. And for her it seemed like all of this happened yesterday. He is glad she was honest with him. They hug and she wishes him good luck. She walks out and silently cries.",
