Liam flashed back to seeing Ridge and Katie together. Katie explained that she needed to build a team of people she could trust at Spencer, and she felt that Liam would be better-suited as the vice president of the company.\n\n\nLiam's eyes bulged in shock. Katie felt that Liam deserved the position, and she was sure Bill would agree. Liam was honored by the offer and noted that Katie had proven her leadership abilities. She appreciated his loyalty, and he expressed excitement about the new job.\n\n\nLiam admitted that he'd thought he'd been about to get fired, and that had led him to go to Katie's house the previous night. \"You did?\" Katie nervously asked. He added that he hadn't wanted to interrupt her and Ridge because it had appeared that something had been going on. Katie couldn't imagine what things had looked like, but she assured him that she and Ridge were just friends.\n\n\nLiam asked if Brooke knew, but Katie insisted that there was nothing to know. She asked Liam not to say anything to anyone. He promised not to say anything and remarked that he hadn't known that she and Ridge were such close friends. Liam smirked as Katie explained that she and Ridge were friends who just got together with their kids occasionally.\n\n\nAs Liam stared knowingly at her, Katie explained that Ridge had a child with her sister, and she had one with Liam's father. Liam thought she had real feelings for Ridge. Liam said he could be wrong, but he'd picked up on a vibe. \"And it seemed like something was about to go down,\" he added.\n\n\nKatie admitted that she cared about Ridge. She said that was as far as it went, and she'd be beyond hypocritical to let it go further. Katie decided to send Ridge a text message to make sure that he was on the same page with her. Liam said that she deserved to be happy, and he saw nothing wrong with Katie being with Ridge. Katie insisted that it wasn't who she was. \"I'm not Brooke!\" she asserted.\n\n\nKatie relayed that it had been a long time since she'd relaxed and had fun, but she'd gotten caught up in a fantasy. She insisted that it wasn't real, and it could never happen for her and Ridge.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick, Brooke, Ridge, Maya, and Carter were having a meeting. They wondered where Hope was, which sparked a discussion about Hope moving on from Liam to Wyatt. Rick said that sometimes relationships just ran their course, and Brooke and Ridge exchanged looks.\n\n\nRick wondered when everyone would get a wedding invitation from Maya and Carter. Carter stated that Maya was the holdup. Maya claimed that wedding planning was intimidating, and everyone joked about Brooke being an expert at it.\n\n\nMaya decided that she needed to meet Oliver about some proofs, and she flashed back to Oliver kissing her. Ridge told Maya that he'd make it easier for her by volunteering the Forrester estate as the wedding location. Carter asked Maya what they were waiting for. Maya stated that it was a wonderful idea, and they would discuss it after her meeting.\n\n\nMaya left, and Carter explained to Ridge that she was probably overwhelmed by the wedding venue offer because she wasn't accustomed to people being nice to her. Ridge replied that they'd change that. Carter and Rick left the office, and Brooke looked at Ridge expectantly.\n\n\n\"All that wedding talk...\" Brooke said, and Ridge wondered how he had known Brooke would say that.  Brooke said she couldn't help but think about their wedding. \"Which one?\" Ridge wondered. \"All of them,\" Brooke uttered, but she was especially thinking of the one that hadn't happened yet.\n\n\nRidge changed the topic to R.J., who wanted to go to school in Los Angeles. Brooke said it would happen eventually; she just thought they needed to work some things out first. Brooke wanted R.J. to return home once both of his parents were living under the same roof.\n\n\nJust then, Ridge received a message on his phone, and he told Brooke that he had to deal with something. With a kiss, Brooke replied that she'd be waiting, and he took off.\n\n\nRick returned to the office and asked Brooke what was going on with her and Ridge. Rick recalled that Ridge had been eager to reunite with Brooke when he'd returned. Brooke said a lot had happened in the previous year, and Ridge hadn't expected the situation with Bill. She felt that she had to earn Ridge's trust and respect again, but she was sure that he'd return home. She insisted that she'd always be the love of Ridge's life.\n\n\nIn the studio, Oliver was with Brandon, a guy who volunteered with Pam at the animal shelter. Holding some newly adopted puppies, Brandon explained that Pam volunteered at the shelter in the name of Tiny. Maya arrived, and Brandon left with the puppies.\n\n\nOliver was excited to show Maya some photos, and he thought that she was gorgeous in them. As he stared amorously at her, she told him that the kiss had been a mistake, and they couldn't do it again. He apologetically said that he hadn't meant to make her feel awkward. She claimed that she hadn't felt that way, but she was in love with Carter and didn't want to let him down.\n\n\nOliver reasoned that it had been just a kiss, and they'd felt something within the moment. He gave her permission to blame it on him for initiating it and said she shouldn't feel guilty. \"But I do,\" she replied. Oliver figured it was because she was an amazing woman.\n\n\nMaya shuddered, grabbed her phone, and sent Carter a message to meet her in the steam room. Oliver was staring at their campaign pictures and noted that they made a great team. He felt that, no matter what, their work had to continue. Smiling, Maya agreed.\n\n\nLater, Maya arrived in the steam room, and Carter said it had better be his fianc\u00e9e entering. They kissed, and he stated that he hadn't been able to remember the last time they'd met in there. He was glad she'd invited him. Carter relayed that he liked meeting her in the steam room, and he also liked the idea of marrying her. Maya claimed to feel the same way.\n\n\nCarter thought it was amazing that Ridge had offered to let them get married at the estate and wondered what her answer to it was. Maya claimed that they had their whole lives to talk, but she couldn't talk and kiss at the same time. Ryan Shaw's song, \"Morning, Noon, and Night,\" played as Maya and Carter made out in the steam room.\n\n\nLater at Katie's house, Katie was alone when Ridge arrived. Katie relayed that Liam had seen her and Ridge together the other night and had asked if anything was going on between them. Ridge asked what she'd said to Liam. Katie stated that she'd said nothing was happening except her and Ridge finding a connection with each other through their pain.\n\n\nKatie insisted that it was nothing more. \"So you don't want me to care about you?\" Ridge asked. Katie explained that Liam wouldn't tell anyone what he'd seen. Ridge said they hadn't done anything wrong, but she replied that they could have. Katie refused to do to her sister what her sister had done to her, and he asked what Katie wanted of him.\n\n\nKatie said she'd enjoyed spending time with Ridge, and she thanked him for being nice to her. Katie didn't want to feel like she was keeping a secret. Her feelings for Ridge frightened her, and she said she couldn't see him anymore. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Maya is put on the spot when confronted by Carter, and their friends, about setting a date for their pending nuptials. Thinking that he is going to be fired for witnessing a moment between Katie and Ridge, Liam is pleasantly surprised when quite the opposite happens. When confronted by Liam about her feelings for Ridge, a flustered Katie denies it. Brooke remains optimistic that she and Ridge will soon reunite.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam is shocked when Katie tells him in Bill's diminished role she is making him VP of Spencer Publications. He's beyond honored and grateful but it came unexpectedly. He thinks Katie has done a good job and the company is back on track. But he says he did come over last night when he got her memo and it looked like something was going on with her and Ridge so he didn't interrupt. She explains it was all innocent. They'd been to the park earlier and Ridge and RJ are both good with Will, so they have gotten close. Liam says it looked a little more than that and he was just surprised to see her alone with Ridge. He wonders if Brooke knows. Katie says there is nothing for her to know. She is not going to lie; she likes Ridge a lot. It's been a long time since she's had this much fun but it's not real. She is friends, just friends with Ridge. And she knows Ridge will be back with Brooke soon. So she's be a super hypocrite to think of anything more. Liam says he doesn't see it that way, two different circumstances. At Forrester, Brooke informs the group that Hope probably won't be in today. She was out late with Wyatt last night. Ridge thought she was still with Liam. Rick says that is the way relationships go, on today, gone tomorrow as he glances at Maya. All question Carter and Maya when they are gonna set their date. Carter turns to Maya and says he is asking that same question so it's up to Maya. She stammers that she needs to go see Oliver and will be back to him later. Ridge even offers the Forrester Mansion for the event. Oliver shows her the latest photo shoot and tells her that she looks amazing. She tells him that she has to say something. It's about the kiss. It shouldn't have happened and it won't again. Oliver says okay but it was just one kiss, it felt right at the moment and if she wants to blame anyone she can blame him. She says she should have stopped it so she blames herself as well. She says she loves her fiance and she doesn't intend to let him down. She hopes this won't keep her and Oliver from working together. He agrees. She gets a text from Carter to join her in the steam room. She says they should do this more often. Rick asks Brooke about Ridge. She says she has no doubt that he will come back and they will be a family again. He just needs to get over her and Bill and she will gain his trust and respect again. Ridge goes to see Katie at her request. She tells him about Liam seeing them last night. She admits that she really has enjoyed his company. He understands her more than anyone else but they can't continue like this. He asks her to spell it out; what does she want of him. She says she won't do to her sister what Brooke did to her. She and Ridge must stop seeing each other. This is the end.",
