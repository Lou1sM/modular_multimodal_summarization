    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Ridge's studio, he awakened in bed alone, and Caroline was gone. She entered with coffee. He smiled, relieved. \"Good morning,\" she said. \"It is now,\" Ridge said, and he kissed her. Ridge held Caroline in his arms, and he said he remembered every breath, every kiss, every touch, every stroke of the brush from the previous evening. He noted that she still had paint on her. She laughed.\n\n\nRidge asked what she'd thought of the painting he'd done of her. Caroline said it was good. Ridge said he'd had trouble because his subject had kept moving. He kissed her again, nuzzled her neck, and made her laugh. He kissed her sensuously.\n\n\nAt Brooke's place, Donna advised Brooke that she might rethink being alone in her big house. Brooke confidently said she wouldn't be alone because Ridge would be moving back in. Donna was surprised. Donna noted that Ridge had been a hot item with Caroline, but Brooke said she would get Ridge back before the day ended.\n\n\nDonna reminded Brooke of Caroline, but Brooke maintained that she would teach Caroline a lesson. Brooke called Ridge at his studio and said she needed to see him. Ridge was still with Caroline, who was getting ready for work. Ridge tried to beg off, but Brooke cooed that it was important, and she needed see him at her house. Ridge agreed, and he hung up. He told Caroline that he would see her soon. Ridge kissed Caroline, and they left.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Donna waited for Brooke, who had gone upstairs. Brooke returned wearing a swimsuit and coverup. Donna was impressed that Brooke had an agenda, and she left. Ridge showed up, and Brooke told him she'd hoped he didn't have any plans because she had plans for him. \"You're gonna have so much fun here, you're never gonna want to leave,\" she said. Ridge smiled.\n\n\n\"Why did you want to see me?\" Ridge asked. Brooke said that she wanted everyone to get along, She wanted Ridge and Rick to get along, but Ridge said that wasn't going to happen. Brooke maintained that if she and Ridge got along, they could create a united team at Forrester.\n\n\nRidge argued that he had no problems with Brooke -- only Rick. Ridge pointed out that he and Brooke had learned to coexist. \"Where is all this coming from?\" he asked suspiciously. He wondered if her need to see him had more to do with her desire to keep him away from Caroline. Brooke maintained that she and Ridge had a history, memories, and a beautiful son. \"Somehow, we got off track,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nRidge interrupted and said they had both moved on. Brooke started to diss Caroline, and Ridge reminded her that he had tried to save her from marrying Bill and had ended up falling out of a helicopter. \"Bill was a mistake,\" Brooke said. Brooke reminded Ridge that Bill had returned to Katie, and Ridge remarked that he'd thought Katie was smarter than that.\n\n\nBrooke flirted, and she added that if Bill and Katie could reunite, so could Ridge and Brooke because they'd always found their way back to each other. Ridge shook his head, but Brooke wondered if she had to spell it out that she had feelings for Ridge. She wanted him to spend the day with her by the pool, where they could relax. \"I'm ready to move on with my life and with you,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nAt Spencer Publications, Bill and Liam discussed their takeover plan for Forrester. They wanted to get rid of Rick and get control of the company. Bill said that Wyatt had to get his job back for any plan to work.\n\n\nBill wondered if Liam had any idea if Steffy was on board. Liam worried that Steffy would not go against her father, and Steffy didn't want any part of running the company with Liam because she still had feelings for him. Bill called Ridge Captain Couture. He said the entire situation infuriated him. He worried about Caroline in a romance with Ridge. Bill called Ridge a predator, and Liam advised the relationship had not cooled off.\n\n\nBill sighed and said that Forrester had become a disaster with Rick at the helm. He added that Rick acted like \"a little dictator, a Napoleon wannabe.\"\n\n\nBill was infuriated that Rick had treated Spencer women so poorly. They agreed that Wyatt had to be their inside man. They hoped he was able to get his job back.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Wyatt knocked on Rick's door, but Rick admonished him for returning. \"I don't have time for quitters,\" Rick said. Wyatt apologized and promised to do a better job. Rick reminded Wyatt how disrespectful he had been. Wyatt continued to apologize and begged to return to Forrester.\n\n\nRick told Wyatt to get on his knees and beg. Wyatt was in shock, and Rick laughed heartily. \"I'm not that sadistic,\" Rick said. Rick wanted to know why he should rehire Wyatt, and Wyatt defended his career. He reminded Rick that he'd been \"damned good at PR, and I think it's the best for this company,\" Wyatt said. Rick agreed, but he warned Wyatt to never cross him again.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Caroline showed, up and Liam welcomed her. She said she wanted to avoid the drama and Rick's power trip. She said she thought Rick had shrunk her parking space. Liam reminded her that her divorce would be final soon. He asked about Caroline and Ridge. She smiled and said they were officially a couple.\n\n\nLiam wondered if it was a good idea for her to hook up with her ex-mother-in-law's ex. Caroline insisted that he stop. She teased that he wouldn't he invited to the wedding. Liam was in shock. \"I'm kidding,\" she said. Liam said he didn't want Caroline to get hurt. Caroline appreciated the concern and wondered if she should be worried about Brooke.\n\n\nWyatt entered, and Caroline wondered if he had run to the office because he was sweating. Liam and Wyatt noted that they had a private meeting. Caroline got the hint that she was uninvited. She told them to have fun. After she left, Liam asked if Wyatt had gotten his job back. Wyatt confessed he was in, but he'd nearly had to \"lick Rick's loafers\" to make it happen. Liam and Wyatt high-fived over their plan to take down Rick. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge wakes up alone the next morning and finds Caroline bringing him coffee and a kiss in bed. Donna asks Brooke if she is missing something. The last she heard Ridge was with Caroline and yet Brooke is saying this big old house won't be that big before long. She is getting Ridge back today. Bill says he just hopes Wyatt can talk Rick into giving his job back, they need him on the inside. Wyatt goes to see Rick who is very dismissive. He tells Wyatt that he does not work there any more and he has no time for quitters. Wyatt says he was not thinking the other day and he really needs to stay here. He is coming to him man to man to ask for another chance. Rick says no, he should not have respected him. Then Rick asks how badly does he want this job he can prove it by getting down on his knees and begging. Brooke says she would hardly call this relationship with Caroline and Ridge a relationship, more like a fling. And yes she would like to show her a thing or two. Brooke comes down in a sexy pool outfit and Donna says WOW, it's obvious she is not going to work. Brooke says it is for tall, dark and handsome. She calls Ridge and says it is not urgent but it is important and she'd like to see him at the house right away. He tells Caroline he doesn't think this will take long. Bill says even if Wyatt comes through there is still Ridge. He does not think there is any way Steffy will go behind her father's back. They discuss Steffy being CEO and running the show but she does not want to do this with Liam involved. And what is Caroline thinking getting all fluttery by Forrester. Bill says it is weird that both Katie and Caroline were sucked in by Ridge. Bill says no one is going to fire at a Spencer woman and get away with it so their target is still Rick. Wyatt repeats it \u0096 Rick wants him on his knees and beg for his job. Rick chuckles and says he is not that sadistic and he was only kidding. Wyatt says every word he said the other day was true and Rick is CEO so he had every right to call him out on it. He even over-reacted and lost his cool and he is sorry. He will now prove to him his loyalty and he gives him his word please give him another shot. Ridge takes notice of what Brooke is wearing as she invites him in and says they don't have to be in any hurry as she knows he has nothing planned today and he will have so much fun he won't want to leave. Rick asks if he lets Wyatt back in, what will he get out of it. Wyatt says he has a lot of contacts all over the world with his PR, but if he wants him to be in janitorial or shipping that will be fine. He will never disrespect Rick again. Rick says he can not have his employees against him, but he is re- hired. But if he is ever subordinate with him again he will be cleaning every bathroom in this place. Caroline stops in and sees Liam. He asks about Ridge and she says it is very good, they are officially a couple. Brooke tells Ridge just to hear her out about this whole Rick and Maya mess and him and Caroline. Ridge says he does not need another lecture. She states that they all just need to function as a team and it could start with her and Ridge. This thing with Caroline is just an infatuation and it won't last. Brooke says she and Ridge will find themselves back together. She proposes they go down by the pool and relax. Liam questions Caroline if she thinks being with Ridge is a good thing. He lists a long list of things why not like being married previously to her aunt, a long history with Brooke and then hooked up with Katie. She gets it that he is not a fan. Liam says he comes with baggage. She says she is a big girl and she won't be hurt. She's curious but she is not concerned except that Ridge is over at Brooke's now. Brooke says this is not about Caroline; somehow they got off track and that should not have happened. He had feelings for her and she is ready to move on with her life so he can stay today as long as he likes. Wyatt drops back in on Liam and Caroline seems suspicious but she leaves. Wyatt says Rick did not make it easy but he is in. He wanted to knock him out of his CEO office but as long as he behaves they are back in business. He says Rick looked so smug that he can't wait to see his face when they bring him down.",
