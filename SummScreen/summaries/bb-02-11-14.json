Hope made excuses and raved about how wonderful and romantic Wyatt had been. Hope professed that Wyatt was unlike any other man that she had met.\n\n\nBrooke was amazed, but she added that she wanted Hope to be happy. Hope asked her mother about Ridge. Brooke answered that she had hope that Ridge would return to her soon. Brooke admitted that Bill continued to pursue her. Brooke promised she would never return to Bill. \n\n\nBrooke insisted that Ridge was the only man for her. Hope acknowledged that Brooke and Ridge had always been in love. Hope asked if Brooke had loved Bill. Brooke said it had been different from what she had felt for Ridge.\n\n\nHope wondered if her Aunt Katie was glad that Ridge had returned. Brooke hoped that Katie and Bill would patch things up, and she anticipated that Ridge would soon return to her. Brooke exited to prepare for a press conference.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, a shirtless Bill had been working out on the deck, and Quinn showed up looking for Wyatt. Quinn noted that Wyatt was generous with his house, allowing Bill to hang out there.  Bill reminded Quinn that Bill had purchased the house for Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn advised Bill that Wyatt and Hope were officially a couple. Quinn wanted Bill to convince Liam to leave Wyatt and Hope alone. Bill was skeptical. Quinn asked Bill about Brooke. Bill confessed that Brooke felt guilty about what Brooke and Bill's relationship had done to Katie.\n\n\nBill was convinced it was only a matter of time before Brooke returned to Bill. Quinn mentioned Ridge, and Bill believed Brooke was meant to be with Bill. \"Not the most loyal bitch in the kennel, is she?\" Quinn asked.\n\n\n\"All class aren't you?\" Bill responded. Quinn wondered what Bill had seen in Brooke. He responded that Brooke was unpredictable and sensual. Quinn wondered if Katie had feelings for Bill, and Bill admitted that he didn't think Katie cared anymore. Quinn surmised that Katie would always care about Bill. Like Quinn, Katie had given birth to Bill's son, and she would always see some of Bill in her son. Quinn felt the same way about Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn moved closer to Bill. She caressed the sword necklace she had given him years before. They bantered about what had happened the last time she had touched his necklace -- she had stabbed him. She grabbed him and kissed him. Afterward, she cooed that she had wanted to see if it felt the same.  Bill asked if it did, and Quinn looked thoughtful.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie and Ridge discussed how much fun it had been doing things together with the kids. Katie said she had loved every minute of feeling like a family. She hadn't felt that in a long time. Ridge agreed he also hadn't felt that way in a long time. Katie insisted that the kids would always be family, but Katie said that she and Ridge had to stop.\n\n\nKatie and Ridge talked about how long they had known each other, but Ridge pointed out that he felt like he had just met Katie.  Katie confessed that she had always admired Ridge. Katie said she had feelings for him, and Ridge acknowledged that he felt the same.\n\n\nRidge put his arms around her, but Katie said she didn't want to turn into Brooke. Katie begged Ridge to return to Brooke because his son deserved to have both parents. Katie added that Ridge had always been the symbol of Forrester strength. \"Marry Brooke and put your family back together,\" she said. \n\n\nRidge stepped in close to Katie and looked at her. Katie tearfully looked at Ridge, and he walked away.  Later, Katie recalled good times with Ridge.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge found Brooke dressed in a stunning white dress, and he told her she was beautiful. He told her that he had spent a lot of time trying to figure out what he had needed and wanted. He said he knew what it was -- her. Ridge asked Brooke to marry him. Brooke looked relieved.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Bill and Quinn briefly set aside their animosity for each other to discuss personal and family matters. Knowing that Liam is onto their growing feelings for each other, Katie and Ridge agree not to act on their emotions. Katie urges Ridge to reunite with Brooke and to put their broken family back together.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie tells Ridge that he must know this between them must stop. They both admit they have feelings and their times with the kids have been great, they are like a unit. She says she has loved every minute and it would be so easy to continue but they can't. She does not want to end up doing something she will regret and end up being her sister. She says she has not been happy for a long time and she thought to herself at the park the other day that this life should be hers. He tells her there is nothing for her to feel sorry about. They've both been hurt and reached out to each other. Katie tells him be has always made his way back to Brooke and that is where he should be now. She tells him to go home, forgive Brooke and make a family for their little boy with both parents. Hope and Brooke catch up on the last few days and Hope confides she and Wyatt are officially a couple now. Brooke is happy for her especially when Hope tells her about the jewel heist but that Wyatt only did it to impress her. He realizes how stupid it was now and won't do anything like that again. Brooke asks about Liam. Hope says part of her will always love him but she's with Wyatt now. Then she asks about Ridge, and Brooke admits he is slowly coming around and she expects him back home any time. Bill is only a distant past although he is still pursuing her. Ridge is the only man she wants in her life. They had a very deep connection and she can't imagine her being in love with anybody else like she was with Ridge. She felt something different with Bill. Bill is working out at Wyatt's when Quinn shows up. She is about to leave when she realizes Bill does not know about Hope and Wyatt yet, so she stays to fill him in. She takes a good look up and down his sweaty body. She says his sons are very generous with their homes. He quips they ought to since he bought the houses for them. She informs him that Hope and Wyatt are now an official item and Wyatt could use his father's support. Bill says it sounds like it's Liam that could use his support. Quinn says yes Bill could make sure that Liam knows that Hope is no longer available. And at the very least she'd like to be sure that Bill isn't going to interfere in Wyatt's love life. She manages to turn the conversation around to women in general and Brooke in particular. She asks why Brooke. Bill sings her praises and says they have a real connection. She quips that she is not exactly the most loyal bitch in the kennel. And now she is holding out. Bill says she does not want to hurt her sister. And plus now she has Forrester whispering in her ear. She's no worse than the rest of them. He asks Quinn if she has ever done anything she ever regretted. You can't let guilt rule your life or you will be miserable. He wants Brooke in his life. In leaving she tells him that she might loathe him but she does admire him as well. She touches his sword necklace and says she remembers when she gave that to him. And in return he gave her the most precious gift of her son. He says they do share some traits. But she better be careful with that sword. He gets a little nervous when she fondles his sword. She kisses him then says she wanted to be sure that was the same too. Ridge shows up at Brooke's office and tells her she might be a little late to her meeting. He's been doing a lot of thinking. He says he knows where he wants to go but he's been going at it all wrong. Now he knows what he wants and needs. It's always Brooke. He asks her if she will marry him.",
