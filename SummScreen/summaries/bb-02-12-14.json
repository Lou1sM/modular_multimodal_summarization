Quinn said she had been very young and innocent when she and Bill had been together. Quinn had wanted to recall what they'd had all those years before. She admitted she had enjoyed the kiss.\n\n\nBill and Quinn discussed that their personal lives were not stable. Quinn guessed that Bill was unhappy -- a sexy, virile man going without sex for weeks.

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Brooke that he wants this, he wants it for RJ and he knows she wants it too. He tells her to put her ring back on her finger and marry him; be his wife. A tear rolls down her cheek and she hardly knows what to say. Liam thanks Katie for making it official and giving him the plaque; he's the new VP. And imagine he had come over to her house thinking he was being fired. She wishes he had never seen that moment between her and Ridge. But assures him that because he is Bill's son does not mean he has a target on his back. She does not believe Bill set out to intentionally hurt her. Liam seems to be okaying her relationship with Ridge. Katie says it can't be. She'd be the biggest hypocrite alive if she allowed the same thing to happen to her and Ridge. She says she put a stop to it. In fact she practically insisted that he propose to Brooke. Liam doesn't understand if she clearly has feelings for Ridge too. Katie says Ridge will end up going back to Brooke. He always does. He guesses that she is doing this so RJ will have both of his parents at home. But maybe Ridge wants something different now than he had with Brooke. Bill asks Quinn what was the kiss about. She doesn't like him yet she kissed him. She said earlier it was to see if it was the way she remembered. She says she is glad she ran into him here and glad about the kiss too. He says if she is coming on to him, then she'll be disappointed. He's not pining for Brooke; he conquers. She says even if he is not the only game in town. Bill says he doesn't worry about Forrester at all. Quinn says too bad there isn't another Ridge Forrester around; he'd be ideal for Katie. Bill changes the subject and asks how are things going between Quinn and Eric. She says it is not that way with him. He's handsome and charming ..and Bill adds loaded. She says but she doesn't think anyone could compete with his dead wife. She likes to think of herself as driven not calculating which Bill seems to imply. And here Bill is, a sexy virile man going weeks without ..no wonder he is working so hard with all that pent up testosterone needing to be released. He says smugly that he likes to keep in shape. She wonders what these Logan women have, that they are all obsessed with them. His sons have it too. Then there is Eric if you like the slutty honey type like Donna. But Katie she is different. She seems so kind and moral. She seems more like Ridge's type than Bill's. Bill wonders why Quinn is suddenly so interested in his personal life. She says she is just more amused why the all powerful Bill Spencer isn't so powerful anymore. He's lost his company and Brooke has kicked him to the curb and Katie has custody of his son. He's batting 0 for 3. He says he is going to change all of that. He is not defined by that but his response to it. He mentions just wait with Valentine's Day coming up. She says okay but he has competition. He declares that Forrester is no competition. He's just a little fly buzzing around. He is the past, Bill is the future. She asks about Katie. Bill says she will eventually find someone who is worthy of her. Quinn says like Ridge. Bill says anyone but Ridge. Alone Katie thinks back on her times with Ridge, playing in the park and him reciting poetry to her. Brooke tells Ridge that she doesn't want to be left again so she needs to know if they marry that it will be forever. She can only accept the proposal if it is forever. Bill asks Quinn isn't there someplace she needs to be. She retorts not if he needs to confide. He says he does not confide ..and if he did, hers would be the last ear he would bend. Ridge tells Brooke that he came home to make a home with her again. He still remembers the first time he saw her in his mother's house when she was catering a party. He wants to make this work and yes it can be forever. Brooke finally says yes and they kiss although Ridge cuts it short. Brooke is excited and Ridge says he knows a little boy who is going to be too. They should go up to school and tell him first. Brooke suggests they wait until after they are married and surprise him when he comes home.",
