To Quinn, the loft was better with Deacon there. He guessed it was because she had a playmate. \"A soul mate,\" Quinn corrected.\n\n\n\"Pause that and rewind it,\" Quinn decided. She hadn't meant the term in a sappy way. She'd meant that Deacon got her, she got him, and neither wanted to change the other. She didn't want him to get freaked out, but he said she didn't scare him. \"Yes, I do,\" Quinn quipped.\n\n\nThe couple drank wine and toasted to Quinn's peace of mind. She doubted she'd have it unless she could fix things with Wyatt. Deacon advised her not to push. He believed Wyatt would \"come around.\" Deacon hadn't heard from Hope, which concerned him. Quinn repeated his advice to her about her son. Deacon and Quinn toasted to having each other's backs.\n\n\nDeacon still couldn't stop worrying about Hope. Quinn claimed that if anyone understood it, she did. He asked if she minded him taking off. He wanted to see if Brooke had anything else she could tell him. \"If that's what you need to do,\" Quinn replied.\n\n\nDeacon left, and Quinn opened her tablet to study pictures of Brooke and Brooke's Bedroom.\n\n\nIn the Forrester CEO office, Pam informed Rick that a woman was there to see him. He said Pam had to be a better gatekeeper than to allow random visitors. \"I pulled rank,\" Steffy responded, sashaying into the office. Rick had heard that Steffy was in town and wondered if she'd stay. Steffy said that after seeing Rick on top, anything was possible.\n\n\nSteffy noted that Rick had worked hard for the position, but she wondered if it was worth what it had cost him. Rick was satisfied with how it had worked out. Steffy relayed that people had been talking. He stated that he didn't care what people had to say. Steffy sniped that she'd heard that.\n\n\nRick suggested that Steffy schedule a lunch date with Maya, who could use some friends. Steffy sardonically hoped Maya found some friends. \"You could score some brownie points,\" Rick hinted.\n\n\n\"With you?\" Steffy incredulously asked. \"Oh, look at you -- feeling yourself -- all confident and self-assured. That's really cute,\" Steffy concluded. Guessing it had to be the CEO's chair, she hopped into it and said a person could get used to sitting there.\n\n\nSteffy noted that Eric had given Rick irrevocable control for only one year. Rick said it was a year to prove himself, not that he needed it after proving himself time and again in the past. Steffy asked why Maya's picture was on Steffy's grandmother's wall, but Rick said that, for the time being, it was his wall. \"Your company, your house, your model,\" Steffy stated.\n\n\nRick figured Steffy had to know about Caroline and Ridge and wondered how Steffy felt about it. \"It's one more thing around here I don't approve of,\" Steffy asserted.  Rick sensed he was on her disapproval list. She quipped that he made unpopular choices, but he said he ran things as he saw fit.\n\n\n\"For now,\" Steffy replied. Rick asked what she was getting at. She remarked that he wasn't the only one with ambition, and she might want to be CEO someday. He replied that she'd have to rip it from his cold, dead hands. She didn't mind it, and he welcomed her to try.\n\n\nRick figured out why Steffy was in town and asked if she'd seen Liam. \"You know he has a girlfriend now,\" Rick added in a leading tone. She asked what his point was. He said that if she didn't want to talk, he had work to do. She told him not to get too comfortable because she liked the chair.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke drank a clear liquid and stared at pictures of her family. She called Rick at Forrester. When Pam answered, Brooke expressed surprise that Rick was keeping Pam there so late. Pam said it was more like holding the employees hostage.\n\n\nPam said that Rick was in a meeting. Brooke didn't want to interrupt it with her call. \"Good, because he would have yelled at me,\" Pam relayed and ended the call with Brooke.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was surprised when Deacon arrived on her doorstep. She wasn't thrilled about it or prepared for company, but she let him in. Brooke made him a drink, but after hearing his concerns for Hope, Brooke echoed Quinn's advice to him. He noted that Brooke seemed anxious to get rid of him and asked if she was okay. Brooke revealed that being home was strange.\n\n\nBrooke had been in a tiny apartment in Milan, and she'd been preoccupied with getting business on track and with Hope. Upon returning home, Brooke had noticed that the men in her life had moved on to other women, and Brooke was in her big, beautiful house...alone.\n\n\nIn Liam's office, Ivy and Liam kissed. She wasn't thrilled that he'd be working late again. She wanted to know if it had anything to do with Steffy because it had seemed as if something had been going on when Ivy had seen Liam with Steffy. He hinted that he was doing something big regarding Rick's grip on Forrester. Ivy didn't know what could be done about Rick for the next twelve months.\n\n\n\"Hostile takeover of Forrester Creations,\" Liam revealed. He calculated that with Steffy, Thomas, and Bill's shares, Liam would have forty-two and a half percent ownership of Forrester. He hoped Ridge would lend a portion of his twenty percent. Liam thought he had a chance because Ridge abhorred Rick and might want to appease Steffy's anger regarding Caroline.\n\n\nIvy disliked the idea of taking her uncle's company away from him. Liam asked if riding it out with Rick for a year was better. She didn't, but she also didn't trust Bill to run the business. Liam assured her that Bill wouldn't be involved. Instead, Steffy and Liam would run things, leaving the business in family hands. \"Knowing that, do I have your support?\" he asked.\n\n\nIvy wanted to support Liam, but she didn't want to go against her family. Ivy considered Steffy to be a \"great designer\" with her own lines, and Ivy trusted Liam. Liam didn't want to pit Ivy against her family and added that it might be a nonstarter because Steffy wasn't agreeing to it.\n\n\nLiam explained his history with Steffy and that Steffy had started her life over in Paris. \"Or so I thought...Turns out she's not entirely over it,\" he revealed. Ivy gleaned that Steffy was still in love with him and asked if he was over it. \"Of course,\" Liam replied. He wanted to find a way to get Steffy out of personal mode and into business mode.\n\n\nIvy left, and Liam flashed back on Steffy admitting her feelings for him.\n\n\nAt Forrester later, Ivy rushed in after receiving a message that Rick wanted to see her. Pam stated that Rick was upset that Ivy hadn't been at his beck and call. Ivy replied that it was after hours. \"Not until Lord and Master says it is,\" Pam replied.\n\n\nRick emerged from his office and ordered Ivy to be in there in ten minutes with the revisions he'd asked for. As he boarded the elevator, Ivy entered the CEO's office, where Steffy still was. Ivy said it was a weird coincidence to see Steffy after Liam had just told Ivy about the plan to take over Forrester. Ivy urged Steffy to join forces with Liam, because Rick had to go. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke continues to drink. Deacon wants to go do something and Quinn asks what are her choices. Anything out that door and it's cold. She says it is so much nicer with her man here. He says she may scare others but she does not scare him. They drink to peace of mind. She muses that Wyatt is right. He blames her for all that has happened to him and he is right. Deacon says but he is her son and he will eventually come around. Deacon admits he has not heard from Hope despite texting her. Quinn says her too, she is going to take his advice and stay clear until Hope decides to be in touch. Meantime they have each other's backs. Pam tells Rick that she needs to announce someone. He says he is too busy and she needs to be a better gatekeeper. Steffy barges past and says she pulled rank. She sits in his chair and says a person could get used to sitting there. He asks if she is in town for long. She is not sure, depends. He wants her to meet and go to lunch with Maya. She could use some friends. Ivy tells Liam that she thinks she may have walked in on something the other night with him and Steffy. He says she is right and it is a game changer. He discusses the hostile takeover of FC .and his hopes of combining the shares to give them enough. Ivy doesn't like it since it is Eric's company and it's always been about family. He finally gets her to say she will give him her support. Maybe two heads like his and Steffy will be better than one. Liam says he is over Steffy but she does not seem to be. He says his challenge is to get her out of the personal mode into a business one. Brooke calls Rick's office but Pam tells her that he is busy at the moment so she dare not interrupt. Brooke goes back to her drink. Rick explains to Steffy that he has one year to prove himself and he has done that before so this will be no different. He asks how does she feel about her old man romancing Rick's wife. Of course she mentions the age difference and how disgusting it is. She conveys to him that some day she might like to be CEO. He says she will have to rip it out of his hands. She tells him not to get too comfortable as she kind of likes that chair. Rick calls Ivy back into the office after hours and then snaps at her that he wants to see her designs ASAP. She sees Steffy and says she just saw Liam and she wants Steffy to join forces with him. Deacon asks Quinn if she minds that he goes and sees Brooke. Maybe she can shed more light on Hope's future. Brooke invites Deacon in but says she was not exactly expecting anyone. He notices the glass by the booze and realizes she has been drinking. He asks about Hope and why should he not jump on the next plane and go see her. Brooke suggests he just back off and wait on Hope. She talks a bit about being back and all her relationships with men \u0096 they have moved on with their lives and here she is in her house all alone. He approaches her.",
