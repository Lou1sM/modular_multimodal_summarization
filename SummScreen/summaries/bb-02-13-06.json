He brings up the night he and Felicia shared together in Nice, implying that Dominick may be his son.  Felicia says there is no way Dante could be Dominick's father because they used a condom.  Dante reminds her that they only used a condom the first time they had sex that night. He asks her if the baby was premature.  Felicia does not know if the baby was premature since she did not have a doctor, she just had a midwife. She continues to reject the possibility that Dante is Dominick's father. Felicia tells Dante her life purpose is to find a family to take care of her son and she has found that with Nick and Bridget. She doesn't want Dante to interfere with this arrangement and she ask him to leave\n\n\nMeanwhile at the beach house, Bridget tells Taylor how wonderful Nick has been to her and she does not know how she would live without him.

She tells Bridget they should both focus on the positive.  Even though Taylor has lost her marriage, she still has her children, and Bridget still has Nick.

Taylor is surprised to hear this, but she tells Bridget to have faith and things will work out.

He says he is a single guy and he does not want a child, but he would like to know if he is the father.  The baby begins to cry and Felicia picks him up.  Dante asks Felicia when she last made love with Nick.  Felicia doesn't answer and continues to deny the possibility that Dante could be father.  Dante says he wants a test to prove it.  While they are arguing, Nick stops by to pick up Dominick.  He can tell that he has walked in on something, but Felicia tries to cover it up.  When Nick is leaving with the baby, Dante stops him.

    "tvmega_recap": "Dante brings up a very touchy subject to Felicia. Their drunken night in Nice, in which he picked her up and they made love. She thanks him, but it was only sex, nothing more. She thought they had been very responsible and used protection and he conveyed they did......the first time. It had been an all night marathon and they weren't as careful subsequent times. She is in deep denial though and won't hear of any suggestion that he might be Dominick's father when Dante wants to do the right thing and insists on medical tests. Later Dante tries to tell Nick the truth, but Felicia manages to stop him in time. Bridget and Taylor share in their sorrow of losing the baby and Ridge. She tells Taylor she even told Nick he was free to be with her mother now, but he wanted to be with her. She's not sure her life will ever be the same or she can be a mother to Dominick. Brooke meets Nick on the boat and he explains to her that Bridget still has her insecurities where they are concerned. She reminds him that Dominick is going to be their source of joy, their \"road to recovery\". He muses it is much like her and R.J. and Forrester. But, she says she can not live always putting her needs first. R.J. has to come first now, Bridget too.",
