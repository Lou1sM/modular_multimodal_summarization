Stephanie, Ridge, Thorne, Felicia, Brooke, Bridget, Rick, Pam, and Phoebe were all involved in some capacity with the new company. As everyone gathered prior to the beginning of the fashion show, Stephanie told Eric that she was very proud of his and Ridge's talents, but particularly Eric's.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nick, Jackie, and Donna prepared to make an announcement to Eye on Fashion magazine that they had expanded Jackie M to Jackie M International. Prior to the fashion show beginning at Forrester Originals, one of the reporters heard from a source that Forrester Creations was about to make a major announcement. Consequently, the reporters left Forrester Originals to go to Forrester Creations.\n\n\nSuddenly, Stephanie and Ridge noticed that there were no reporters in attendance for the fashion show. Stephanie began to become suspicious. Stephanie and Eric telephoned their buyers, who were vague and secretive about why they were not present at the Forrester Originals fashion show. Thorne informed them that he had noticed several of their buyers' stores were closed. Thorne recalled that when he had tried to obtain answers about store closings, he'd gotten the runaround.\n\n\nThe Forresters learned that Forrester Creations was about to make a major announcement and turned on the television. Stephanie, Eric, Ridge, Thorne, Felicia, Rick, Brooke, and Phoebe were shocked to learn that Nick had purchased all of the Forresters' buyers, and the stores had become part of Jackie M.\n\n\nAfter the initial shock of what Nick had done wore off, Stephanie went to see Nick -- against Eric's strong advice not to. Stephanie asked Nick not to take her mistakes out on the rest of her family. Nick indicated that he was equally upset with Stephanie's family for enabling her behavior. Stephanie asked Nick why he would do that to Eric, especially because Jackie wanted a relationship with Eric. Nick was arrogant and told Stephanie that the entire Forrester family would have to pay for everything she had done to people over the years.\n\n\n",
