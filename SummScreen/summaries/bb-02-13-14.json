    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Eric, Donna, Hope, and Rick gathered together to hear Ridge and Brooke's big news. The couple announced that they were getting married, and everyone congratulated them. Brooke and Ridge planned to have a courthouse wedding and tell R.J. about it after it was official, but Eric told the couple that there would be no courthouse wedding.\n\n\nEric said they could keep the event small, but Ridge and Brooke would have it at his house. Donna gushed about how romantic it would be for Ridge and Brooke to marry in the same spot where they'd first laid eyes on each other.\n\n\nGiggling, Brooke said a proposal had been the last thing she'd expected, but Ridge's timing had been perfect. Ridge added that her answer had been perfect, and a \"yes\" from the right person was as beautiful as poetry. Ridge and Brooke insisted upon a simple wedding because they couldn't possibly top their past weddings. Donna and Hope said it should be the biggest wedding yet for the couple.\n\n\nEric believed that Stephanie would be happy for the couple, and the group joked about Stephanie's portrait jumping off the wall during the ceremony. Donna wondered why Katie wasn't there to hear the news, and Brooke replied that she wanted to tell Katie alone.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge later, Hope cooed about the upcoming wedding, but Rick was skeptical. He hadn't seen a ring on their mother's finger, and he remarked that Ridge had had issues with Brooke. Rick wanted to be supportive, but he wondered if Brooke had thought about once again putting her faith in a man that had let her down many times.\n\n\nHope felt that it was different because Brooke wasn't competing with any other woman, and Brooke had no other man in her life. Hope thought that all ugliness about the situation with Bill and the guilt about Katie had gone, and it was a new chapter for Ridge and Brooke.\n\n\nIn Katie's office, Liam arrived to discuss some advertisers, and Katie said they couldn't meet the advertisers' needs without knowing what they were. Liam quipped that meeting other people's needs was a big thing for Katie. Liam began discussing Katie and Ridge, but Katie said it was a moot point because Ridge was returning to Brooke. Liam said Brooke had no idea of the gift Katie had given her.\n\n\nKatie didn't want to speak any more on the topic, but Liam didn't understand why she'd pressure Ridge to be with Brooke. Katie exclaimed that Ridge had returned to town for Brooke, whom he loved. Liam claimed that he'd seen Ridge's feelings for Katie, but Katie replied that Liam wasn't helping.\n\n\nLiam stated that if Katie had a chance with Ridge, she owed it to herself to take it, and if someone made her happy, she should be with that person. Liam urged her not to wait for the circumstances to be perfect or to look good to others. \"I'm telling you, nothing feels worse than knowing you had a chance and letting it slip away,\" Liam warned before leaving.\n\n\nLater, Liam arrived in Eric's office, where Ridge was sketching. Liam told Ridge not to worry about what Liam had seen at the house, and Liam added that he didn't think Katie had meant it when she'd backed off Ridge. \"Katie doesn't play games, and my future's with Brooke,\" Ridge responded.\n\n\nRidge informed Liam that Ridge and Brooke were getting married. The shocked Liam stammered to congratulate Ridge but said he could have sworn he'd seen something between Ridge and Katie. Ridge asserted that he was focused on his marriage to Brooke. Liam asked if Ridge was sure, and Ridge insisted that he wouldn't have proposed if he weren't.\n\n\nLiam noted that Ridge had spent a lot of time with Will and Katie. Liam stated that he had a lot of respect for her, and Ridge said he had a lot of respect for her, too. Liam suspected that she felt the same way about Ridge and believed that it wasn't often that a person could make one see new things. \"Like poetry,\" Liam cited, picking up a book. Ridge asserted that he was committed to his family, and it was best that Liam take Katie's advice about letting it go.\n\n\nBack at Katie's office, Brooke arrived to give Katie some news. Katie noted that her sister was smiling. Brooke stated that she deeply regretted her mistakes and the rift she'd made between them. Brooke wanted to fix it more than anything, and she believed that very day was the day to do it.\n\n\nKatie asked what Brooke meant, and Brooke said Ridge's name. Katie guessed Ridge wanted to work things out with Brooke, but Katie gasped when Brooke relayed that he'd proposed. Brooke said she knew Katie didn't want to return to Bill, but the proposal proved that Brooke didn't want Bill, either.\n\n\nBrooke had grown to understand Katie's hesitance in forgiving Brooke because Brooke had felt the same hesitance about recommitting to Ridge. Brooke said she'd needed to know beyond any doubt that he wouldn't do what he'd done to her again. Brooke understood that Katie needed the same reassurance from Brooke, and Brooke was there to give it.\n\n\nBrooke explained that she'd marry Ridge soon, and Katie could put her doubts about Brooke and Bill to rest. Brooke wanted Katie to know that no matter what happened, Brooke would never stand between Katie and a man ever again. Brooke stated that they were sisters first. Katie tearfully uttered that she was happy for Brooke. The sisters hugged, and Katie shed tears.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Bill worked out with a punching bag. He told Wyatt that Quinn wanted him. Bill explained that she'd kissed him to see if it felt as she'd remembered, but he felt that Quinn needed to understand that it wasn't going to happen. Wyatt asked if Bill had made himself clear. Bill claimed that he had, but \"you never know with her, do you?\"\n\n\nWyatt believed that his mother was more interested in his love life than her own. Bill asked if things with Hope had gotten serious. Bill guessed that he'd picked the right son to live with because it was apparently going to get crowded at the beach house. Wyatt claimed Hope wasn't moving in yet, but due to the pace at which the relationship had been moving, Bill thought she would.\n\n\nBill assumed that Hope and Wyatt had gotten beyond their issue, and Wyatt said that Hope was giving him a chance to make up for his mistake. Bill murmured that it was good, and Wyatt was surprised that it was all Bill had to say. Bill remarked that he hadn't understood why Liam had always felt the need to prove himself to Hope. Bill hadn't known why any guy would want to put himself through it. \"But now I do,\" Bill stated.\n\n\nThe talk turned to Bill's love life, and Bill asserted that he wasn't worried about Ridge, the dressmaker. Bill felt that Ridge had what he wanted right in front of him but wouldn't pull the trigger, and after he'd cut her off for an entire year, Ridge had no right to dictate with whom Brooke spent her time.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Brooke agreed with Bill. \"She should,\" Bill quipped and added that Ridge had jerked Brooke around for a long time. Wyatt guessed the door was open for Bill. Bill said that it was true -- if he could get Brooke's mind off Katie.\n\n\nBill noted that Valentine's Day was around the corner, and he felt that Ridge couldn't compete with what Wyatt's \"daddy\" had planned.  Bill claimed it would be the best Valentine's Day that Brooke had ever had. Wyatt asked about Ridge. \"Well, he's gonna have to make some other plans,\" Bill concluded. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam attempts to encourage Katie to stop putting others first and start acting on her feelings for Ridge. Family and friends are blindsided by the latest news regarding Brooke and Ridge. Bill learns that the personal life of one of his sons\u2019 is going much better than the others\u2019. With Valentine\u2019s Day just hours away, Bill is convinced that he will be able to win back Brooke\u2019s heart.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge and Brooke call everyone together at the office and Ridge announces that he proposed. Brooke said yes and they are going to get married. They want RJ to concentrate on his studies and will tell him later. Eric insists that they can keep it small and informal but have it at the house. All but Rick seem okay with this. But he is sure that Stephanie will be looking down from her portrait at them. Rick tells Hope that he wants to be happy for his mom but he has doubts in Ridge, a man that has let her down so many times. Liam drops in on Katie and wastes no time by saying he knows she and Ridge share the same feelings for each other and she has as much right to be happy as Brooke does. Katie tells him not to pursue this and she is not going to say one more thing on this subject. She ends by saying Ridge came back for Brooke. He loves Brooke and always has and will. She says she appreciates his support ad advice but this is not helping. He tells her sitting around all day reading love poetry is no swap for the real thing. If she has a chance, then she owes it to herself to take it. He says he has learned from experience, if someone makes you happy then be with them .don't wait for it to be perfect or look good to other people, just be happy. He says nothing is worse than knowing you had your chance and let it slip away. Then he visits Ridge at his office. Nervously he brings up Katie and says he witnessed something between them and despite what Katie might be saying about Ridge needs to go back to Brooke, he doesn't believe she means that. Ridge says Katie is a good person and doesn't play games. Ridge says his future is with Brooke and he has a pretty good start already. He tells Liam that he proposed to Brooke and they are getting married. Liam is taken aback. He starts in again and Ridge interrupts him. He says he is marrying Brooke and he is just focusing on that right now. Liam still rattles on. Finally Ridge gets up and takes the book of poetry out of Liam's hands and says he is committed to his family, Brooke and RJ. He thanks him for his concern and his congratulations but he should take Katie's advice and just let this go. Katie is surprised to see Brooke in her office. Brooke says she has regretted a lot of things but she'd like to fix that and she thinks today is the day to do that. She says she is moving on and she'd like to do the same with Katie. Katie is pretty well floored when Brooke says Ridge has asked her to marry him. She vows never to come between her and her man again. Maybe she does not want Bill back, but this proves that neither does Brooke. Whatever they are, they will always be sisters. Katie hugs her and says yes, and she is happy for Brooke. Katie's tears flow. Bill is working out at Wyatt's and tells him that Quinn is after him. She is coming on to him, even kissed him to see if it was what she remembered from years ago. Wyatt thinks that is kinda crazy but not the craziest thing she has ever done. Bill says she is definitely not mellowing with age. Wyatt asks if he really wants to get into a debate on which one of his parents is crazier. Bill tells Wyatt it ain't gonna happen and Quinn needs to know that. Wyatt says then he should have made that clear to her. He also says he thinks his mom is more interesting in his relationship with Hope than starting a new one with Bill. Bill is glad his relationship is back on track with Hope, wants to know if it is serious. Looks like he picked the right son to move in with as it might get crowded in here pretty soon. Wyatt says no, Hope is not moving in just yet. Bill thinks it could be at any time. He's glad Hope forgave him for the little problem. Wyatt is expecting a lecture but Bill says no. He used to give Liam a hard time for always thinking he had to prove himself to Hope over and over. He couldn't imagine why any guy would want to put himself through that. But now he does. But he's not worried about that little old dressmaker. He came back for Brooke but it was all talk, no action. He does what he always does. He sees what he wants right in front of him but he can't pull the trigger. He basically dumped her for an entire year so he has no right to judge or say who she could see. But the good news is it is almost Valentine's Day and there is no way Forrester can compete with what Wyatt's daddy has planned. He intends to win Brooke back and Ridge ..he will have to make other plans.",
