He said he had a little time. Brooke was sad that couples were celebrating each other that night, but she was alone. She didn't want to be alone.\n\n\nBrooke offered Deacon another drink. She was sure Quinn didn't mind the smell of alcohol. Deacon figured that the cops might mind it. Brooke told him he could stay there, and she had plenty of rooms. Drinking more, Brooke proposed that Quinn join them for Valentine's stories.\n\n\nAdvising Brooke to make it her last drink, Deacon tried to take Brooke's glass. Brooke pulled it back. She asked if he knew about Bill and Katie's engagement. Deacon asked about Brooke's plan to get Ridge back, and Brooke conveyed that Ridge wanted Caroline. Brooke didn't know what was wrong with her family. Deacon told her to forget Ridge because Deacon and Brooke had a family.\n\n\nDeacon set the inebriated Brooke on her sofa and asked her if she needed some coffee. Brooke giggled, asking if he wanted her to stay up all night. He gave her water and said that they were family. Deacon stated that Brooke could call on him for help if she ever had another night like that night.\n\n\n\"My drinking buddy,\" Brooke whispered. Deacon said he was the best kind of drinking buddy because he'd tell her when to stop. She stated that she'd always had a man to return home to and share a bed with. She hadn't thought she'd needed that. She didn't want to need it, but she was lonely.\n\n\nLater, Deacon handed Brooke some aspirin to combat a possible hangover. Brooke tried to take it with her liquor, but he insisted that she use water. She agreed to take it and assured him she'd be fine at work. Being at home alone was the problem. Deacon urged her to reach out to her family members and to him, who all cared about her. He said drinking only helped in the moment.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Brooke wanted him to check on her later, but Brooke insisted she'd be fine. She urged him to go back to Quinn. Deacon hugged Brooke and left. Brooke set down the water and pills and picked up her liquor. Tears streaming down her face, she swigged it and poured more.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Quinn arrived with a heart-shaped candy box. \"Somebody shoot me,\" Wyatt murmured as he let her inside. He was sure she hadn't arrived just to deliver the candy, and he asked her what she wanted. Quinn admitted that she was worried about Brooke using her connection with Hope to seduce Deacon. Wyatt asked if Quinn trusted Deacon. Quinn claimed she did.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill was impressed that Liam was in the office, working, instead of out somewhere, buying overpriced flowers. Liam stated that the flowers were the next step -- right after he wrote his poem. \"You gotta be kidding me!\" Bill asked. Liam agreed that he was kidding.\n\n\nBill remarked that women didn't want poems. He believed they wanted diamonds, which was why Phil the Jeweler was in Bill's office with something nice for Katie. Bill wondered which brunette Forrester Liam planned to spend the evening with, Ivy or Steffy.\n\n\nLiam planned to be with Ivy, and he mentioned that he'd told her about the plan. \"Liam, are you out of your mind?\" Bill screamed. Liam said that Ivy wouldn't tell anyone, and she was the reason he was even trying to pull it off. Liam admitted that he might not be able to because of Steffy.\n\n\nBill asked if Liam had expected Steffy to just hand over her shares, and he asked Liam what the problem was with moving forward. Liam relayed that there was an emotional price to pay for working with him, and Steffy wasn't sure she could pay it. Bill concluded that Steffy still loved him. Bill asked if Liam was saying that, if Liam and Steffy were together, Steffy would sell her shares. \"Liam!\" he roared.\n\n\nLiam declared that he wasn't going there or opening up the can of worms again. He considered giving up the whole plan. \"Maybe you should give up that plant,\" Bill suggested. Realizing that Bill meant Ivy, Liam quipped, \"Oh, that's cute!\" Bill had nothing against Ivy, but the relationship didn't compare to what Liam had had with Steffy. Bill felt that if Liam and Steffy could get back to where they were as a couple -- and run Forrester -- then Liam had to do it.\n\n\nBill said Liam would be with the woman he'd been meant to be with. \"Ivy loses a boyfriend -- and a new one at that. Big deal,\" Bill stated. Bill felt that Liam would be doing Ivy a favor by saving the company, and Ivy would thank Liam later. Bill urged Liam not to give up on his plan to take over Forrester and insisted if they got control, all the Spencers would benefit.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy urged Steffy to join Liam in taking over Forrester. Steffy was surprised that Ivy was supporting the takeover. Ivy said Steffy wouldn't be surprised if she'd seen how Rick treated Ivy. Steffy asked if Ivy would still support Liam if Rick wasn't treating her badly. Ivy stated that she was just asserting how she felt, and Liam and Steffy were what the company needed.\n\n\nIt wasn't that easy for Steffy, who still needed to consider her father's desire to run Forrester. Ivy figured that Ridge was happy designing with Caroline. Steffy shot Ivy a cold look. Steffy felt that Ridge's disgusting relationship with Caroline was enough to make Steffy take the company over. Ivy asked what else could be holding Steffy back from wanting to run the company with Liam.\n\n\n\"Because I am still in love with him, is that what you mean?\" Steffy asked. Ivy respected what Steffy felt and wouldn't flaunt her relationship with Liam. Steffy stated that she hadn't visited Los Angeles for \"this.\" Steffy had arrived for a short visit, but Liam had dropped the predicament in her lap. Steffy needed time to process what it would do for her and for Ridge.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Ivy really wouldn't feel threatened by Liam and Steffy working long hours together. Ivy claimed she wouldn't. Ivy trusted Liam and his feelings for her. Steffy was impressed with Ivy's confidence but doubted Ivy understood the depth of Liam and Steffy's feelings and past. Ivy agreed she'd never know what kind of relationship Steffy had shared with Liam, but Ivy did know what she had with Liam. Ivy said it might be Steffy who didn't understand the depth of feelings.\n\n\nSteffy said if she returned, she wouldn't sit front row to Ivy and Liam or watch the man she loved go home to Ivy every day. \"If I come back, I come back to all of it,\" Steffy decided. \n\n\n",

She says she tried to convince herself that it is any other day but couples are together and out kissing and hugging and yet here she is alone. Quinn knocks on Wyatt's door and asks if she can come in. He says that depends on what she has behind her back. She brings out a huge red Valentine heart shaped box of candy. Bill tells Liam despite what women say, it is jewelry they crave and he has already had his jeweler by this morning and picked something out for Katie. He wonders Liam's plans with Ivy considering Steffy is back in town. Liam confesses he told Ivy about their plans. Bill says he is out of his mind. Steffy is surprised to hear Ivy say she is along with their plan to take over FC. Steffy says she still has her dad to consider. He might want to still run FC. Ivy says he seems happy with just designing with Caroline. Maybe there is another reason that Steffy is hesitating .and they end up discussing Liam. Wyatt enjoys the chocolates but says he has no choice in his life but to move on. And he is sure she did not stop by just to bring him some candy. Brooke tells Deacon that after all these years she did not think she would be alone. He turns down a drink since he is driving .she says he can stay here if he'd like, plenty of room. He tries to get her to make this her last drink but she grabs another. Deacon tells her that Ridge is a fool so forget him and if she wants to talk about family, they have one. Quinn tells Wyatt that she does not trust Brooke and that is where Deacon is. Wyatt reminds her that she can trust Deacon though. She admits yes that she does trust him, more than she does any other man. Deacon gets Brooke to sit down and offers her coffee or some water which he trades off for her drink. He tells her that she can always count on him. She calls him her drinking buddy, then says she has always had a man to come home to and share a bed with. She does not want to need that, but she is so lonely. She leans on his shoulder. Liam tells Bill that there is an emotional price for Steffy to pay and he is not sure she is ready for that yet. Bill guesses that she is still in love with Liam and if he were with her that she would sell them their shares. Maybe it is time to forget that \"plant\" (Ivy). He's got to do it if there is any chance. Ivy says she thinks Steffy can make a difference and she and Liam can run the company together. Steffy says she has no idea what this might do to her father. And she would think Ivy would feel threatened for them to work such long hours. Ivy says no, she would not feel threatened at all as she trusts Liam, so please come back and run FC. Steffy is impressed with Ivy's confidence but she doesn't think Ivy understands the depth of her and Liam's feelings. She says she will not work all day with Liam and then watch him go home with Ivy. If she comes back she will come back to all of it. Bill tries to convince Liam that he needs to be back with Steffy, the woman he was supposed to be with. She will thank him so do not give up on this. Get control of FC and all the Spencer's will benefit. Deacon gives Brooke some aspirin and says she will sleep better now. He tells her to get a good night's sleep and she can always call him or her sisters. The drink will only help for the moment. She gives him a hug and convinces him to go back to Quinn and have a good evening. When he leaves, she puts down the aspirin and water and goes for the booze again.",
