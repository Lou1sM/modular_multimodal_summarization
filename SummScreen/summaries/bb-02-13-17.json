    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Zende told Eric, R.J., Thomas, and Rick about his engagement. Eric was happy, and when he said there was nothing like having the right woman by one's side, Thomas flashed to kissing Sally. Everyone was surprised when Zende said the wedding was the next day. He was planning the event as a gift for Nicole, and it would be the most special day ever.\n\n\nR.J. noted that he'd helped pull off the heart in the sand, so he was Zende's guy if Zende needed help. Zende wanted to do most of it on his own, but he would keep it in mind. Thomas remarked that Zende had it bad for Nicole. Rick asked if there was anything anyone could do.\n\n\nZende did want something from Rick, who'd offered good counsel to Zende ever since Zende had moved to the city. Rick said he was always there for Zende. Zende wanted Rick to be by his side at the wedding as the best man. It would mean a lot to Zende. Rick replied that it would mean a lot to him, too. The men gleefully shook on it.\n\n\nLater, everyone had gone but Eric and Zende. Zende asked if Eric would host the wedding at the mansion. Eric said that nothing would give him more pleasure than to host it at the house. They hugged, and Zende asked for one more thing. He wanted to pull out all the stops and had devised his own \"showstopper.\"\n\n\nZende opened a door beneath the stairs and pulled out a portrait of Nicole. He said it would only be for a day -- if Eric agreed to it. Zende had gotten the portrait as a wedding gift and figured it would hang in his and Nicole's living room, continuing the Forrester tradition. Eric said it was beautiful. Zende said that Eric could decline, but if not, they'd remove it after the reception.\n\n\nEric agreed to talk to Quinn about hanging it over the fireplace for a day. He was sure it would be fine. Eric believed it would be a great day for the family. Zende wanted it to be special for Nicole and wanted nothing to ruin it.\n\n\nLater, Thomas was working in the CEO's office when R.J. strolled in, typing away on his phone. He asked if Thomas liked redheads, and Thomas asked what his brother was talking about. R.J. was referring to a girl who'd requested to follow him, and as R.J. accepted the request, Thomas asked if R.J. had lots of cuties following him online. R.J. affirmed it.\n\n\nThomas said R.J. was a true Forrester. R.J. had a question. He asked how to know, out of all the girls in the world, if the one standing before him was the one. Thomas replied that he was still trying to figure that out for himself.\n\n\nIn the design office, Maya, Vivienne, and Nicole talked about the surprise engagement. Vivienne was ecstatic, but she wanted to make sure Nicole hadn't been pressured in the moment. Nicole replied that the issue was behind her and Zende. She loved and trusted him all the way.\n\n\nVivienne wished Julius was there. Nicole said she'd talked to him earlier. Vivienne assured Nicole that he'd be there for the wedding, but Maya asked if her mother was sure there wouldn't be another golf tournament. Vivienne didn't know but said they hadn't known an engagement would happen. Vivienne cried over her baby girl getting married, and Nicole hugged her.\n\n\nNicole was grateful to Maya and called Maya her best friend. Nicole asked Maya to be the matron of honor. \"Consider me honored,\" Maya said, and they hugged. Vivienne had waited for that day, and she thought Zende was a good man. He'd made mistakes, but with Nicole keeping him in check, he'd age like fine wine.\n\n\nNicole was in disbelief that she'd be a wife, and it was crazy that it would happen the next day. Nicole got a text message from her father, who said he was supposed to foot the bill for the wedding and intended to do so. The women laughed about Julius going straight to the money. Nicole said Zende wouldn't accept Julius' money because Zende was throwing the wedding as a gift for her.\n\n\nJust then, Sasha arrived, and the atmosphere in the room darkened. Vivienne greeted Sasha as Nicole and Maya stared at Sasha. Sasha had heard the news. Nicole glanced at the ring on the hand on her hip and said she'd figured it would get around. Sasha asked to speak to Nicole alone, and Maya and Vivienne left.\n\n\nSasha apologized for what she'd done. Though it wasn't an excuse, she wanted to say she'd believed that the relationship had been over. She swore nothing else had happened between her and Zende and never would happen again. Stating that she wasn't going to lie, Sasha admitted that she'd left the door open for Zende, but he hadn't walked through it.\n\n\nSasha knew it was easier said than done, but she wanted to work on her relationship with Nicole. Sasha knew that it would be one step at a time, and she asked if the first step could be letting Sasha attend the wedding. Nicole asked why Sasha wanted to do it. Sasha said they were sisters, and Sasha wanted to put the bad things behind them and be a family. She wanted to show the family that she was in total support of the wedding and be a real sister.\n\n\nNicole wasn't ready to forgive Sasha but said that Sasha would attend the wedding. Sasha exclaimed that Nicole had no idea how happy it made her. She hugged Nicole, who stood like ice. Slowly, Nicole's hands touched Sasha's back, and Nicole's lips defrosted into a slight smile. Sasha said that the best woman had won.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Saul was worried that Sally was throwing designs at the wall to see what stuck. Sally reminded Darlita and Saul that they only had six months. Sally glanced at a design and zoned into her memory of kissing Thomas. Darlita snapped Sally out of it, and Sally said her many thoughts had frozen her brain. Darlita asked if Sally needed a hot water bottle.\n\n\nSally asked how the designs were going, and Saul, who was working on a red floral dress on a dress form by the door, said Sally expected miracles. She replied that she believed in Saul, and they would give the Forresters -- Miss Steffy in particular -- a run for their money. Darlita remarked that the Forresters had the money, not the Spectras.\n\n\nSaul stated that they had Sally, who could pull off the impossible. Sally said that the cake stunt had been good, but they had to keep their names out there. She had alerts set, and she'd been \"following\" Steffy. The only thing left was to figure out what to do.\n\n\nLooking at her laptop, Sally's eyes sparkled when she saw a post about Zende and Nicole's wedding. Sally called it a bona fide Forrester event. Saul asked what she'd do. \"What do you think? Crash the wedding!\" Sally exclaimed. Saul didn't like the idea and said she could get arrested. Sally loved the thought and wanted to set up a way to notify him of when to call police.\n\n\nSaul exclaimed that he wanted no part of the crazy scheme. Sally believed that it was just what her great aunt would do. She looked for her phone to call Grams. Saul asked if Sally really wanted to revive the rivalry between the fashion houses. She called it clickbait gold and said they had to stoke the flames to keep it alive. \"Tomorrow, Sally Spectra strikes again,\" she announced.\n\n\nAs Thomas and Sally worked in their respective offices, they kept drifting off into thoughts of each other.\n\n\n",
