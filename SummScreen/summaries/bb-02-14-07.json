Felicia felt he had to be under a lot of debt, and Ridge stated that they were, as well. Ridge suggested they sell to department stores, but Eric refused to sink so low, saying he'd rather burn all the gowns than make them accessible to the average Joe. Ridge thought his father needed to be realistic, but Brooke said if they did that, Fenmore's would drop them, and they would never be in another specialty store again.\n\n\nDespite Ridge's urging, Eric refused to consider making gowns at half cost and half quality. Ridge then told him they should sell the Forrester name while it was still worth something -- before Nick ruined it. Eric adamantly refused; instead, he thought they should open their own stores all over the world to sell their line. Rick supported his father's idea, and he and Ridge bashed heads over it. Brooke broke up the fight then left. Ridge thought Eric's idea was too risky and said he would not be a part of it.\n\n\nAt Taylor's, Taylor admired the flowers Nick had sent her and made plans to meet him for dinner. They agreed to be each other's valentines. When Phoebe walked in and noticed the roses, Taylor confessed that they were from Nick. Phoebe thought Taylor should send them back after what Nick had done to Eric and Ridge. Taylor felt bad for the Forresters, but she thought they had asked for it. Taylor sat Phoebe down and explained that since things were over with Thorne, Taylor intended to move on with her life. Later, Taylor daydreamed about being in Nick's arms as she eagerly prepared for their date.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Forrester Creations, Jackie fretted to Nick about Eric's downfall, worrying about how much he had suffered in their revenge plot. Nick maintained that the Forresters had gotten their due, and Eric had to go down with them. Jackie continued to bemoan Eric's plight. Storm said they could always slash their prices and sell to department stores. Jackie argued that Eric would never resort to that, but Nick agreed that would be their best option. Donna was impressed that Nick had been able to pull everything off so smoothly.\n\n\nLater, Brooke dropped by and confronted Nick. She told he would end his war with the Forresters if he'd ever loved her. Nick said it was not war, just a business that she'd chosen to walk away from. Getting really close to him, Brooke begged him to sell Forrester Originals at his store, and he told her he would have to think about it.\n\n\nBefore Brooke got the chance to use her feminine wiles to persuade Nick further, Taylor burst into the room. Brooke was surprised that they had plans for Valentine's Day and questioned Taylor about it. Annoyed, Taylor said it was none of Brooke's business, since Brooke was engaged to Ridge. Taylor then boldly kissed Nick in front Brooke, who demanded that they stop. Taylor lit into Brooke, telling her Nick was much too smart for her tricks, and she should just go back to her gullible Ridge, who fell for them every time.\n\n\n",
