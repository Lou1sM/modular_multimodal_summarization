Hope embarrassingly said she hadn't gotten him anything, but he said she'd gotten him \"this.\" Hope giggled as he kissed her.\n\n\nHope excitedly announced to Wyatt that Brooke was engaged to Ridge, and Wyatt saddened as he noted that Bill had been confident about winning Brooke back. Hope replied that it had just been a matter of time for Brooke and Ridge. Wyatt felt sorry for his father but concluded that he had more important things to think of on Valentine's Day.\n\n\nWyatt had made dinner reservations at Il Giardino, but he decided that cuddling on the couch felt better. Hope admitted that she'd rather stay there and order in. She thanked him for making things special, but all she wanted was to be there with him. She said he didn't have to keep making things up to her, either. She believed he was a better man, and she wanted him to believe it, too.\n\n\nWyatt ordered some Thai food, and he and Hope toasted to their first of many Valentine's Days. Hope said it should be their tradition to sometimes do nothing, and Wyatt was fine with that, as long as they did it at the beach. It meant a lot to him that they were thinking long-term. He was grateful to have her, and he loved her more each day. They wished each other a happy Valentine's Day and kissed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Rick and Ridge concluded a meeting, and Ridge thanked Rick for biting his tongue about the engagement. Rick replied that he wasn't enthusiastic about it, but he planned to support his mother. Ridge thought that was good but asked if Rick were willing to take it a step further.\n\n\nRick stated that supporting his mother sometimes meant picking up the pieces after Ridge left her. Rick said he'd believe in Brooke and Ridge's destiny for as long as Brooke needed him to, but he hoped Ridge wasn't expecting him to throw a bachelor party. Ridge replied that, traditionally, it would be one of Rick's duties -- if Rick agreed to be Ridge's best man.\n\n\nRick asked if Ridge had considered their father for the job, but Ridge replied that he wanted Rick to stand up there and help unite the family. Rick asked Ridge to say that he wouldn't hurt Brooke and that he'd mean every vow. Ridge said he was ready, and he and Brooke could make it work.\n\n\nRidge asked if Rick would stand with the bride and groom, and Rick agreed to do it. Rick wanted his mother to be happy, and he thought it would be a positive gesture for him to make. \"Thank you. And you're right; we can skip the bachelor party,\" Ridge said and left the office.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam went to Katie's office to let her know that he'd seen Ridge. Liam wondered if she knew what was happening, and Katie bitterly replied that Ridge was marrying Brooke, just as Katie had asked him to do. Liam urged Katie not to deny her feelings for Ridge. Though Katie knew that Liam meant well, she asked him to leave it alone.\n\n\nLiam continued to try to reason with Katie, but she told him to stop. \"Stop saying what you want to hear?\" Liam asked. \"Yes -- no!\" Katie responded and decided she couldn't listen to Liam any longer. Katie insisted that Ridge was with Brooke, and that was the way it was supposed to be.\n\n\nThe frustrated Katie left, and on the desk, Liam saw photos of a wedding shoot with Hope in them. Overcome with memories of their relationship, he grabbed his phone and texted a happy Valentine's Day message to Hope. Sighing, he erased it without sending.\n\n\nAt the park later, a song played, and Katie flashed back to memories of being there with Ridge. She made a pallet on her sweater and sat down to read. Nearby, Ridge was also strolling through the park. Over the wind, Ridge and Katie's voices recited verses from Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Love's Philosophy.\"\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke answered her front door and was shocked to see Bill standing there with roses. He told her that the limo was waiting, and they had dinner reservations in Santa Barbara. She glared at him, and he said he wasn't giving up. Sighing, she murmured that she had something to tell him.\n\n\nBrooke thanked Bill for the flowers. She stammered and said she knew that giving up wasn't in his vocabulary; however, she declared that it wasn't happening for them -- ever. Bill said they'd discuss it over dinner, but Brooke blurted out that she was engaged to marry Ridge.\n\n\nOutraged, Bill asked how Ridge deserved another chance with Brooke. \"How do you?\" Brooke quipped. She wanted to be with Ridge, who made her happy. \"What -- for a day?\" Bill contended. She reasoned that Katie had made Bill happy, but he asserted that he and Katie didn't want each other.\n\n\nBrooke said that Bill could have his marriage, his son, and his company back. She insisted there was no other man for Katie, and she ordered Bill to be with Katie. \"I want to be with you,\" Bill uttered. He asserted that Ridge would let her down again, and Bill didn't understand why she couldn't see Ridge for who Ridge really was.\n\n\nBill called Ridge a soft, indecisive man who ran whenever his feelings were hurt. Bill declared that there wasn't a shred of indecision within Bill, and Bill reminded Brooke that they'd shared a goal. Brooke asked him to go, but Bill asked where the papers were.\n\n\nBrooke acted as if she didn't know what Bill was talking about, and Bill clarified that he meant the papers Katie had signed to give him back the company and custody of his son. Brooke said she didn't have them, but he didn't seem to believe her. Bill told her that if she gave him the papers, they could have it all again. He declared that he loved Brooke and only Brooke. She told him to stop it. He touched her face and slowly walked out the door. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Bill has a reunion with Brooke on his mind, but, his plans for sweeping her off of her feet are left in shambles. Meanwhile, Katie is secretly pining for Ridge and fighting the urge to follow her heart. Wyatt and Hope refuse to let all of the recent negativity get in the way of celebrating their very first Valentine\u2019s Day together.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt spruces up his place, and has chocolates in hand along with roses when Hope knocks on the door. He greets her and says \"chocolates, flowers and me\" \u0096 and he kisses her. He invites her in and she pretends she doesn't know what is going on. He says it's only the most special day of the year, the one where a guy has to step up his game so no way they can pretend it's not happening. She says she did not get him anything but he says oh yes she did. He pitches the chocolates and flowers on the couch and gives her a big kiss. She says with all this romance in the air has he heard her mom's big news. She is engaged .to Ridge, not Bill if that is what he was expecting. Wyatt is surprised. He says he just saw his dad yesterday and he seemed pretty confident he was gonna win Brooke back. Wyatt says it's Valentine's Day and he has many more important things to think about. But it is going to be hard on his dad. They snuggle on the couch and Wyatt tells her he made reservations but this feels so good. He hopes he won't be the worst Valentine by suggesting they just order in. She thinks that will be a terrific idea. All she really wants to do is spend time with him. And he doesn't have to keep making things up to her. He has proved he is a better man. She believes it and he should believe it too. Katie is looking kind of gloomy when Liam pops in. He says he just saw Ridge and he wonders if Katie knows. She says about Brooke marrying Ridge, yes of course she does, just like she asked her to. Liam tells her that she knows she does not have to pretend with him. She says she isn't. Ridge has made the right choice. She tells him again that he has to forget what he saw. This is her sister's husband or soon to be. Liam says that he knows that she does not want this marriage to happen or whatever it is worth he doesn't think Ridge does either. And denying her feelings for the rest of her life, that's what is best for everyone. That's only going to cause more harm. Katie says she knows Liam means well, but he has to leave this alone. She is not her sister. He says he is sorry. He likes her, he respects her and he doesn't want to see her settling. She says she is not. And she also can not stay and listen to any more of this. She grabs her things and leaves. Ridge is finishing up a meeting with Rick and asks him to stay a spell as he has one other thing to ask him. He thanks him for not giving him grief over being engaged to his mother. Now he wonders if he will go one step further and give them his full support. Rick says he will always be there to support his mother whether Ridge is there or not. And he will always believe in their destiny as long as she lives with Ridge. But he will not be throwing him a bachelor party. Ridge says that is ok if he will agree to be his best man. Rick has doubts but Ridge says he means every vow and he thinks this time it will work. Rick says he wants his mother to be happy and he thinks this will be a positive way to show her so yes he will be Ridge's best man. They shake hands and Ridge says he is right; they can skip the bachelor party. Brooke rushes to the door to find Bill with a huge arm full of roses and wishing her Happy Valentine's Day. He comes in and tries to whisk her upstairs to change and get ready as he has reservations in Santa Barbara. It's Valentine's Day and surely she doesn't want to spend it alone. She says she has something to tell him. First she thanks him for the flowers, then says she knows no is not in his vocabulary but he has to try. What he is doing is not happening ever. She blurts out that she is engaged; she and Ridge are getting married. He's livid, he doesn't think Ridge deserves another chance. Brooke tells him she cares for him but there is no going back. Ridge makes her happy. And she thinks Katie can be happy too with Bill. He can have everything back \u0096 Katie, his marriage, his company, his son. She orders him to just go be with Katie. He puts his hand on her face and says she can not go back to Ridge. He will only let her down again as he always does. He's soft and indecisive and he gets his little feelings hurt and he runs. Bill will not let her go; there is no indecision on his part. He has a goal, they had a goal \u0096 her, his son and the company. He asks about the papers he had drawn up for Katie to sign. Brooke says she does not have them. He asks her to think about one thing while she is marrying Ridge. Those papers gave him control of his company and custody of his son. They can have it all. He tells her he loves her but she tells him to stop it. Finally he leaves. Katie settles in the park, reading her poetry and thinking about Ridge. Meanwhile Ridge is also walking in another part of the park reciting the poetry to himself. Liam finds some modeling photos of Hope on Katie's desk and thinks back on happier times. He texts her Happy Valentine's Day. Wyatt tells Hope that he ordered the food and this will be the first of many traditions. It feels so good to be able to say that. This is their first Valentine's Day and she says the first of many. He says he loves her more and more every day and is so grateful she is in his life.",
