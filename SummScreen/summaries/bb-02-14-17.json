He and Eric hugged. \"Family is everything isn't it?\" Julius asked Eric. He greeted Quinn as the \"lady of the manor.\" Then he greeted Zende with \"soon to be the newest member of my clan.\"\n\n\nJulius noticed the portrait of Nicole above the fireplace and was wowed. He said it was the nicest gift that Zende could have given Nicole. He added that at one time, Maya's portrait had hung there. Quinn looked uncomfortable. He joked that Quinn and Eric would leave again and give the house to Zende and Nicole. \"No, no,\" Zende stuttered. Quinn said it was only for the wedding.\n\n\nEric greeted Tony and Kristen, Zende's parents. Zende welcomed his parents to the house. They all embraced. Tony said that he had known by the way that Zende had spoken about Nicole that it would lead to a wedding.\n\n\nZende's parents noted that Zende seemed nervous, and he admitted that he was anxious. They advised him to enjoy the moment. \"And every moment after that,\" Zende said. His parents said they wanted him to be happy. They all hugged.\n\n\nTony and Kristen embraced Ridge and R.J. Ridge said that Brooke couldn't make it because she hadn't been feeling well. \"She's here in spirit,\" Ridge said. They all promised to catch up later, and Tony and Kristen wanted to spend more time with Zende because he looked nervous. R.J. joked that his dad wouldn't be nervous when he married Brooke, and Ridge agreed.\n\n\nRidge and R.J. greeted Quinn and Eric. Ridge noted that Quinn had been a great hostess because she had given up her place on the wall for Nicole's portrait. \"Just for one day,\" Quinn said. R.J. and Ridge mingled with other guests.\n\n\nEric remarked to Quinn that he had detected a hint of jealousy that Nicole's portrait was above the mantel. Quinn agreed she had been ridiculous, but it was important to her. \"That is my spot -- that is the one spot in this house that belongs to me and only me,\" she said. Eric disagreed. He put her hand on his heart and said that his heart belonged to her. \"I love you,\" she said, and they embraced.\n\n\nRidge watched Quinn and Eric from across the room, and Quinn caught his eye. Thomas joined his father and advised him to stop staring at Quinn and Eric. Ridge smiled and agreed.\n\n\nZende greeted Sasha after she entered, and she looked uncomfortable. He told her to relax because Nicole had invited her, and she was the sister of the bride. \"You can't get any closer to family than that,\" he said.\n\n\nUpstairs at the Forrester mansion, Nicole prepared for her wedding, and Vivienne and Maya remarked that it was nice of Zende to arrange for them to have their hair and makeup done. They celebrated with a Champagne toast to a Valentine's Day wedding. They were all emotional, but Maya said they could have no tears because it would ruin their makeup.\n\n\nJulius showed up, and Nicole was elated. He said he wouldn't miss her wedding. Julius said she was marrying an incredible man, and he remarked that the wedding had to have cost a fortune. Nicole chastised him, and he laughed.\n\n\nJulius wondered how she had grown up so fast. He recalled holding her in one arm, and then she'd walked and talked. \"It was all downhill from there,\" Nicole joked. \"This is your day, baby -- all yours -- I want it to be the happiest day of your life,\" Julius said. They hugged. Julius left.\n\n\nLater, Steffy joined Maya, Vivienne, and Nicole. She reminded Nicole to breathe and relax because everyone was happy for her. They hugged. \"And everyone loves you. Everyone in the room loves you,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nSasha entered and told Nicole how beautiful and glowy she looked. She asked for a moment alone with her sister, and Maya, Vivienne, and Steffy left. Sasha said she wanted to wish Nicole the best, and she remarked that Zende was a very lucky man. She thanked Nicole for inviting her, and Nicole said that sisters were forever. They hugged.\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Charlie and Pam put the finishing touches on the wedding cake and told the caterers they wanted happy guests. The caterers remarked that the cake was lovely. \"I baked it myself,\" Pam said, and Charlie looked surprised. Pam admitted that Charlie had helped.\n\n\nIn the living room, Rick told Zende that Carter had arrived to perform the wedding. Carter teased Zende about getting cold feet. Steffy and Liam arrived and told Zende they loved weddings. They all discussed that it wouldn't be long before another wedding took place -- Liam and Steffy's.\n\n\nAt Spectra Fashions, Sally Spectra tried to think of a way to crash the Forrester wedding. Darlita asked to be Sally's plus one, but Saul pointed out that Sally had no invitation. Shirley entered, and she carried two large bakery boxes. \"Coffee break time,\" Shirley shouted. Sally told her they were trying to think of a way to crash the Forrester wedding. She paused and asked what was in the boxes. \"Cakes,\" Shirley said. She added that she was testing recipes. \"Cake -- that is the answer,\" Sally said, and she kissed and hugged her grandmother.\n\n\nLater at the Forrester mansion, Sally and Shirley arrived, in disguise, looking like they were caterers. Shirley carried a large box, and Pam greeted them at the front door. Pam told the women the caterers were in the kitchen, not the front foyer. She guided them to the kitchen. Sally and Shirley unboxed the cakes, and they looked awful. Shirley said she had warned her granddaughter. Sally said it didn't matter.\n\n\nSally ordered her grandmother to grab a tray of appetizers and start mingling so they could be part of the crowd. Sally wanted to see the grounds, and she wanted some photos to tie them to the Forresters. \"More eyeballs for us. I can see the headlines, now. 'Sally Spectra crashes Forrester wedding,'\" she said.\n\n\nIn the living room, Pam said she had funny feeling about the last two caterers. Charlie told her to stop worrying. On the other side of the room, Sally eyed Thomas and flashed back to their kiss.\n\n\nThomas, Liam, and Steffy discussed wedding planning, and Thomas was distracted. He flashed back to when he had kissed Sally. Liam and Steffy noticed that Thomas had been distracted, but he dismissed their observation.\n\n\nUpstairs, Nicole was alone for a few moments before Maya returned to help her into her dress. Maya told her she deserved to be happy.\n\n\nDownstairs, a quartet started the wedding march, and Nicole walked down the stairs. Julius handed her a bouquet at the bottom of the stairs and walked her over to Carter and Zende. She noticed that her painting was above the fireplace. \"Oh, my God,\" she said. Everyone laughed, and Zende smiled. Carter welcomed everyone, and the wedding started.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "It's the day of Zende and Nicole's wedding: Zende, Rick, and Eric greet Kristen and Tony who arrive from Miami and are extremely happy for their son. Eric kisses Quinn who is slightly uneasy to have her portrait in the living room being replaced by one of Nicole for the occasion. Upstairs, Nicole shares a tender moment with Maya, Vivienne and Julius. Sasha steps in and expresses her gratitude to Nicole for allowing her to be part of the festivities. In the kitchen, Pam tends to the caterers and shows Charlie the wedding cake she made. Over at Spectra Fashion, Sally announces to Shirtey, Saul and Darlita that she came up with the perfect idea to garner more publicity. Dressed as caterers, Sally and Shirley head over to the Forrester Mansion bearing another, rather sad-looking, wedding cake. Sally gushes about mingling with the Forresters and spotting Thomas. Steffy, Liam, Ridge and R.J. join the other guests and Carter who is serving as Justice of the Peace, just before the ceremony begins.",

Sasha comes in and Zende tells her to relax. She says she wanted to show her love and support for both of them. Sally and Shirley manage to sneak in the open door as part of the catering team, complete with cakes. Eric catches Quinn looking a little too long at Nicole's portrait. He says she may have him wrapped around her little finger but he thinks he can still detect a little jealousy. Ridge sees them hugging and even Thomas tells him to stop staring. Sally brings the food in and she keeps looking at Thomas and remembers their kiss. Pam is just a little suspicious of Sally and Shirley as she was not informed they would be joining the team. Sasha tells Nicole she is gorgeous and then wants a little alone time with her to wish her the best. She tells her she is truly grateful that Nicole allowed her to be here. Steffy and Liam arrive. Zende and Carter tell Maya they are ready and good to go. Nicole tells Maya that she needs just a moment. She feels so blessed. Maya says now they need to get that dress on.
