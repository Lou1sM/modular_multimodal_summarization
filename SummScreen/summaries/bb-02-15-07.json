    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Nick's office at Forrester Creations, Taylor, dressed for a romantic dinner with Nick, jousted with Brooke, asking why Brooke wasn't home with her fianc\u00e9. Brooke turned the tables and stated that she wondered if it was too soon after her relationship with Thorne for Taylor to be dating. Taylor advised Brooke that Thorne had ended their relationship, and she and Nick were getting on with their lives and celebrating Valentine's Day together. They headed out the door while Brooke whined that she wanted to continue her discussion with Nick about carrying the Forrester line in Jackie M boutiques. She asked Nick to think about it, and he promised he would as he and Taylor left for dinner.\n\n\nNick and Taylor stopped at Nick's home. Taylor guessed he wanted to change, but when they entered, candles, flowers, and a pre-set table for two greeted them. \"Too much?\" he asked Taylor jokingly. They bantered over dinner, and he told her she was fired as his psychiatrist so they could start conversing on a more personal level. She agreed, and they discussed Brooke's proposal that Forrester Originals be sold in Jackie M Boutiques. Taylor said she was surprised he would even consider it, and he replied that he would always care for Brooke.\n\n\nTaylor told Nick that she personally had no allegiance to the Forresters after Stephanie had used the information she'd overheard in Taylor's office about Jackie's past to humiliate Jackie at the Forrester Creations showing. After dinner, Taylor and Nick cozied up in front of the fire, wrapped in each other's arms. They started kissing as Nick asked Taylor if she was a passionate woman, and the conversation and the romance got more passionate while Nick's phone rang. He didn't answer it, choosing to get closer to Taylor.\n\n\nAt Brooke's home, Ridge and Rick faced off over just about everything. Rick started in on Ridge for being disloyal to the family and not supporting Eric in his dream of owning specialty boutiques. Ridge said he was a realist, but Rick countered that Ridge was responsible for many of the Forresters' problems: Taylor's drinking and tearing out Rick's mother's heart time and again. Ridge acknowledged he'd made some mistakes, but he was going to make up for them. Rick sarcastically noted that Ridge was going to do that by marrying Rick's mom again -- \"for how many times is it?\" he asked. Rick laid into Ridge for leaving his mom, and R.J. and Hope talked about how Ridge had gone back to Taylor the last time after Stephanie had faked a heart attack.\n\n\nThe door opened, and Brooke found the feuding Forresters. She told them to stop their bickering. She dropped the news that they might be able to sell Forrester Originals in Jackie M Boutiques, since Nick had said he would consider it -- much to Rick and Ridge's surprise. She sent Ridge off so she could talk to Rick privately. Her son reminded her that it was not too late to let Nick know she cared for him, but Brooke claimed she was building a life with Ridge.\n\n\nRick didn't let up, so Brooke told him that Nick had moved on, since he and Taylor were celebrating Valentine's Day together. Rick noted that it really bothered Brooke. Brooke admitted that it did because she would always care for Nick, and Rick continued to push her not to give up on a relationship with Nick, since other than his father, Nick was the only man Rick had ever approved of for his mom. Brooke said she was going to bed.\n\n\nUpstairs, dressed in her black negligee, Brooke picked up the Eye on Fashion magazine sitting on the nightstand that prominently featured Nick and Jackie on the front cover with more photos of Nick inside. She flashed back to seeing Taylor and Nick kissing in Nick's office, and she put the magazine away as a shirtless Ridge walked in. He told her that Rick was trying to break them up, but she said she wouldn't let it happen. They started in on an unforgettable Valentine's Day love fest.\n\n\nDownstairs, Rick called Nick's cell phone and left a message that he needed to talk to Nick as soon as possible -- and that it was about Brooke.\n\n\n",
