    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Big Bear, Eric arrived with firewood, and Stephanie complained that there were no steaks in the kitchen. Assuming that someone had stolen them, Eric griped about being too old to cut wood or keep the cabin up. She reminded him that it had been his idea to have the meeting at the cabin, and she refused to sell the place.\n\n\nOutside the cabin, Ridge arrived and met Brooke, who was leery of going inside because of the track record she and Stephanie had at the cabin. Ridge reasoned that Stephanie \"likes you now,\" and he ushered Brooke into the house.\n\n\nInside, Eric and Stephanie were arguing about selling her jewelry before selling that cabin. Ridge inquired about the lack of a fire in the fireplace, and Eric asked if Ridge didn't see that Eric was getting to it. Stephanie asked if Brooke and Ridge had eaten the steaks, and Ridge assumed that Thomas had probably been at the cabin with friends.\n\n\nEric quipped that \"Old Mother Hubbard\" had found the cupboards bare. Stephanie noted that there was some old wheat cereal in there, and Ridge said it had been there since he'd been a kid. He didn't get why they'd had to drive up there in the snow for the meeting.\n\n\nEric suggested that Ridge have a drink. There was plenty of booze, and there were decisions to make. He figured that they thought he was crazy for wanting to open his own retail shops, but he'd gathered them there to talk it out -- or fight it out if they had to. He asserted that they wouldn't leave until they'd made decisions about the future.\n\n\nLater, Eric, Stephanie, Ridge, and Brooke had brandy by the fireplace. Ridge informed Stephanie and Eric that, after an unofficial talk with Brooke, \"Popeye\" was considering selling Forrester Originals in the Jackie M boutiques. Upset, Stephanie asked who'd authorized Brooke to talk to Nick. Brooke claimed it had been in passing, but Stephanie asked how Brooke thought it made the Forresters look.\n\n\nEric said he was afraid he had to agree with Stephanie. Stephanie asked what he was \"afraid\" of, and Eric decided that she'd had too much to drink. Ridge asked which couple would take the loft. Laughing, Stephanie quipped that Eric couldn't make it up the stairs to the loft. Eric retorted that he wasn't the one who had a headache every Friday night. Stephanie's mouth dropped open, and she requested to talk to Eric alone.\n\n\nTurning the topic back to business, Ridge suggested that Eric go the Martha Stewart route. Brooke assumed Ridge meant that Eric should let Stephanie face prison time for what she'd done to Jackie. Stephanie was miffed that no one believed her version of the story. Ridge clarified that he'd meant selling their brand in department stores.\n\n\nStephanie suspected that Brooke was disappointed because Stephanie hadn't gone to jail. Brooke yelled that she could have had Stephanie prosecuted half a dozen times for what she'd done to Brooke in that very cabin. In an attempt to prevent an argument between the women, Ridge and Eric decided it was time to go to bed. \"Once a caterer's daughter, always a caterer's daughter,\" Stephanie said, and Eric ordered her to go to bed.\n\n\nAs Stephanie left the room, she called Brooke \"common.\" Perturbed, Brooke put on her coat and mumbled and griped about Stephanie's derision of her. Brooke left the house in a tizzy. Ridge and Eric exchanged glances, and Ridge followed Brooke out of the house.\n\n\nEric went upstairs. There, Stephanie sat with her arms folded, and he asked what the matter was with her. She was sure he was about to tell her what was wrong with her. Eric asked why she tormented Brooke. Stephanie asked why he didn't look at her the way he looked at Brooke. He replied that he did, but Stephanie just didn't notice.\n\n\nSighing, Stephanie admitted that she was afraid of their new venture. She recalled how hard it had been to start Forrester Creations from scratch. Eric touted that they had a lot more in their scratch than they'd ever had. Still leery, she wondered what they had to prove. Eric reminded her that he was supposed to be the quitter.\n\n\nStephanie suggested that they let the kids do it because it was the kids' turn. Eric asked if that meant he was supposedly washed up. She replied that he was Mr. Eric Forrester, and no one would take that away from him. He roared that \"they\" could take it from them if they started stamping the Forrester name on the soles of mass-produced house slippers.\n\n\nStephanie recalled that he'd badgered her about not being the wife he'd always wanted. She stated that she'd never get to do it if Eric started the venture. She then worried that the workload could give him a heart attack or a stroke. \"Why can't we just sit back and enjoy all this money we've made?\" she asked.\n\n\nTaking Stephanie's hand, Eric proposed that the two of them charter a yacht and kayak around the fjords of Chile. \"Me on a kayak?\" she questioned. He concluded that they'd stick with the boat. She told him that they couldn't be gone for long because the kids would need their help with whatever business they'd start.\n\n\nEric wondered if he and Stephanie were just kidding themselves about the idea of spending the rest of their lives on a deck, sipping martinis. Stephanie remarked that she'd always wanted to learn how to fly a helicopter. Chuckling, he asked why they could only relax and enjoy themselves by risking life and limb.\n\n\nEric felt it would be safer to mortgage it all to the hilt and carry on. He stated that they wouldn't have lived the lives they'd led if they'd been the retiring types. Stephanie was awfully tempted to retire. Eric was, too, but he didn't want Stephanie to become some golden girl, hobbling along beside him. She asked if he wished she was 30 years younger. \"Nah, I would just be insecure,\" he responded. She inquired about becoming 30 pounds skinnier, and he quipped that a waist was a terrible thing to mind.\n\n\nStephanie broke into laughter. Giving in, she told Eric to have his stores. He had her blessing to mortgage everything. He kissed her cheek, and she called him a pushover. Deeming her the pushover, Eric pushed her down on the bed. A pillow fight ensued, and feathers began to fly through the air. Eric ordered Stephanie to give him a kiss.\n\n\nOutside, Ridge found Brooke sitting on a ladder that had been propped against the cabin. He asked how long she planned to be out there. Brooke said she'd rather risk frostbite than be with Stephanie. Brooke asked why Ridge had even mentioned that she'd talked to Nick. Feeling that Stephanie had had a point, Ridge said Brooke should have asked someone before talking to Nick. Brooke asked why no one had asked her before they'd outed Jackie as a whore on television.\n\n\nRidge took Brooke's point, and Brooke asked why he couldn't just let Eric have what he wanted. Ridge contended that the retail plan would bankrupt them. Brooke reasoned that Eric had built his fortune; therefore, it was Eric's to risk. Ridge asked if they owed it to their children to leave their children as well off as they were. Brooke didn't think so. She felt they owed it to their children to leave them with pride and self-respect. To her, that was worth more than a fat trust fund.\n\n\nAbove Brooke and Ridge, a window opened. A half-naked Eric tossed feathers out of the window, saying that he was getting rid of evidence. \"Close that window and get your naughty ass back here,\" Stephanie ordered, and Eric closed the window.\n\n\nBrooke climbed up the ladder, and Ridge asked her what she was doing. The bed in the cabin began to creak. As Brooke stared through the window, she made several peculiar expressions. \"You don't want to see this,\" she told Ridge. At that, Ridge promptly joined her on the ladder. He glanced into the room, shook his head, and hit his forehead. \"My eyes are burning now! Thanks, Logan! Thanks a lot!\" he rasped.\n\n\nLater, Eric was alone with his brandy and writing pad in the living room. He flashed back to the evening Beth and Brooke had catered Ridge's engagement party at the mansion. Scenes played of Stephanie, Eric, and Ridge each separately meeting Brooke that night. He reflected upon working with Ridge on sketches and putting on fashion shows with his son.\n\n\nInterrupting Eric's musings, Brooke and Ridge returned to the house. He asked where they'd been in the dark. \"Trust me, we got an eyeful,\" Brooke responded. She thought it was best that she and Ridge head home, but Eric wouldn't hear of it. He had something to discuss with them, and he added that Stephanie was in a better mood. \"Oh, yeah. I'm sure she is,\" Brooke replied.\n\n\nEric lit candles on the coffee table. Stephanie entered and apologized for the brandy going to her head earlier. Brooke waved around a pillow feather, and Stephanie asked what that was about. Brooke teased that they all knew what Stephanie had done earlier, using her body to get what she'd wanted. Eric and Stephanie exchanged looks.\n\n\nDeciding to move the topic along, Stephanie announced that she'd given her blessing for Eric to open retail stores. Ridge grimaced. Though Brooke thought it was risky, she believed that they could do it. Eric said that, before he heard Ridge's view, he wanted to ask a question.\n\n\nEric asked if Ridge knew how many pieces the four of them had done together as a team. He held up a number on his pad. Amazed, Ridge read, \"Five Thousand?\" Eric considered it a huge accomplishment. They had created their art, and the world had accepted it. In Eric's mind, Ridge was the glue, and they couldn't do it without him.\n\n\n\"All right. I'm in,\" Ridge relented. Everyone cheered, and Brooke told Stephanie that it was the four of them from the beginning to the bitter end. \"Happy five thousand!\" Ridge exclaimed and hugged Eric. Brooke asked Stephanie for a hug, but Stephanie decided she'd wait until ten thousand. Brooke told Ridge that she'd see him in the bedroom, and Stephanie snapped that some things never changed.\n\n\nStephanie tensed when Brooke slipped up from behind, drew her arms around the seated Stephanie, and whispered, \"I know you love me.\" Stephanie cringed as Brooke kissed her cheek.\n\n\nBrooke left, Ridge and Eric began chatting about work, and Stephanie grinned at the camera.\n\n\n",

Stephanie later suggests to Eric that he retire, but withdraws the idea when she sees how much his career means to him. They have a fun pillow fight before making love.

He thinks they should sell the cabin. She won't, she loves it. He quips only her and the woodchucks. Ridge and Brooke join them and Eric vows they will stay until they make the decision - there is plenty of booze. Stephanie jokes about Eric not making it up the stairs so they get the bedroom, Ridge the loft. Eric shoots back that look who has a headache every Friday night. Blame it on the brandy but before long Stephanie is good- naturedly ragging on Brooke being a caterer's daughter. Ridge and Brooke go outside leaving Stephanie and Eric to discuss their golden years of sitting on deck with martinis. One thing leads to another and soon they are on the bed having a gigantic pillow fight. Outside Brooke is trying to convince Ridge that it is Eric's risk to take. And leaving their children with some self respect and dignity is more important than a big, fat trust fund. Frivolity prevails in the bedroom and creaking mattresses and laughter is heard below. Brooke climbs the ladder first and peeks in and tells Ridge he doesn't want to see this. But, oh yes he does, and now his eyes burn. Eric has wonderful memories of his younger titan days with handsome son and drop dead gorgeous wife. When Ridge and Brooke return Eric quips it's so dark outside, they can't see a thing. Ridge remarks trust him, they got an eyeful. Stephanie joins them and offers her apology that is must have been the brandy. Brooke won't let her get away with that and confesses they know what she just did - using her body to get what she wanted. Eric asks if they know how many pieces they have all done together as a team, from beginning to end? 5,000! What an accomplishment. And Ridge is the glue, they couldn't do it without him. Ridge follows everyone else's lead and says he is in. Brooke plants a big noisy kiss on Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie mugs for the camera, BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL, Episode 5,000.",
