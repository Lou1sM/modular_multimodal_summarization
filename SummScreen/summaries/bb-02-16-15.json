Katie had a thousand things to do to prepare, and asking Brooke to be the \"matron of honor\" was at the top of the list.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Wyatt implored Liam to work faster on Steffy and the plan because Wyatt had just begged the Prince of Darkness for his job back. Liam knew that it was hard to work for Rick. Wyatt asserted that Rick had shot up the place, and he asked what Steffy's holdup was. Liam deemed it complicated, and the brothers discussed what the alternatives would be if Steffy wouldn't join them.\n\n\nBill strode in and told his sons that he had big news. Bill gave Liam the next day off from work and told Wyatt to get Rick to do the same for him. Wyatt scoffed, and Liam asked what the news was. Bill stated that he and Katie were getting married the next day, and he couldn't do it without his boys.\n\n\nLiam poured the men some organic scotch, and Wyatt said it smelled like sludge that grew on a fish tank. Liam claimed it was all he had, and he toasted to Bill and Katie. Wyatt took a drink and complained that the aftertaste kept on giving. Bill thanked Liam for his toast -- even though Liam had tried to poison them with the organic booze.\n\n\nBill had two sons, but he could only have one best man. Wyatt had been through a rough time, and Bill wanted him to know that he had a home and Spencer family. Bill loved Wyatt and said he'd be honored if Wyatt would be the best man. Wyatt looked at Liam, who said it was all Wyatt. Wyatt said he'd be honored to do it. Bill said he couldn't wait to marry Katie and rebuild their life together.\n\n\nBill left, and Wyatt asked Liam if he was really cool with the best man thing. Liam was fine with it, and he wanted Wyatt to know that he was in Wyatt's corner, too. Wyatt was glad but still suffering with the funky aftertaste of the scotch. Liam decided to take Wyatt for a burger, and they left.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke awakened on the sofa next to a nearly empty bottle of vodka. She started to polish off the last swig but hid the bottle when Katie entered. Katie claimed to have been calling Brooke all morning, and Brooke lied that she'd been oversleeping due to jetlag.\n\n\nKatie announced that she and Bill were getting married the following day. Brooke congratulated Katie, but upon hugging Katie, Brooke grimaced sadly. Donna rushed into the house, anxious to know why she'd been summoned to the house so urgently.\n\n\nKatie announced that she and Bill were getting married. Donna hugged Katie and launched into planning mode. Katie said it would be a simple ceremony at the house, and Donna volunteered to help the bride get ready. Katie thanked Brooke for giving Katie and Bill the space to reunite, and Katie wondered if it was too much to ask of Brooke to have her be the matron of honor.\n\n\nBrooke didn't think she should even attend the wedding, let alone stand up for Katie. Katie said the wedding was about all of them moving forward and healing as a family. Katie needed Brooke to stand up for her and implored Brooke to do so. Brooke gave in, and when they hugged, Donna said to make room for the chopped liver.\n\n\nThe sisters hugged, and Katie left. Brooke poured herself a drink, and Donna said she couldn't believe Brooke had agreed to be matron of honor when Brooke was in love with the groom still. Brooke stated that she and Bill were history, but Donna called it recent history. Donna didn't believe Brooke could just turn her feelings for Bill off.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that she was over Bill because she chose to be over him. He'd be Brooke's brother-in-law, and Brooke couldn't have the same feelings for him. Brooke said she couldn't stare into his eyes or have that same yearning. Donna asked if the liquor had become Bill's replacement.\n\n\n\"Yes. Yes, for the time being. And I'm not interested in what you have to say about it,\" Brooke quipped and drank more.\n\n\nBack at Katie's house, Bill advised Katie that he'd asked Wyatt to be the best man. Katie said Brooke would stand up for the bride, but Brooke had seemed off and lonely. He replied that Brooke was a big girl. Katie was concerned because she hadn't remembered Brooke ever being without a man.\n\n\nBill believed there was a first time for everything, and being single wasn't a death sentence. He didn't want to talk about Brooke when he'd soon marry the love of his life. They heard Will calling for them. Katie asked if Bill was ready to jump back into it. \"With both feet,\" he replied and kissed her.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy presented some of her jewelry. She was offended when Rick said it looked cheap and as if a soccer mom had gotten it by couponing her way into a great deal. Ivy was sorry Rick didn't like them, but she'd had in mind loaning them to Katie for the wedding.\n\n\nRick said Ivy wasn't authorized to loan out Forrester jewelry. Aly began to say that Ivy had thought it was okay because Katie was Rick's aunt. Maya interjected that Rick knew his relation to Katie, but Ivy still needed permission. Ivy asked for the permission. Rick said it was fine -- if Katie didn't mind looking cheap.\n\n\nRick remarked that he wasn't going to the wedding, so Caroline was free to go with Ridge. Chuckling, Rick called it ironic that two adulterers would attend a wedding together. Aly assumed that Katie hadn't had a chance to tell Rick about the wedding. Rick said that was cute of Aly, but he'd been invited. \"Did you really think you'd be invited before us? You're really adorable, Aly,\" Maya added.\n\n\nRick stated that he wasn't going because he was too busy running a fashion house to attend Katie and Bill 2.0. Ivy asked if that was the only reason. Rick figured Ivy assumed that Caroline was the reason he wouldn't attend, but it wasn't. He said that if Ivy was busier and more focused, she wouldn't be pawning off a sweet-sixteen charm bracelet as a Forrester creation. Maya stated that a little bit of effort went a long way.\n\n\nNext, Aly modeled shoes from her line, \"The Aly's.\" As she pranced around in them, her heel broke, and she implored Rick to understand that the shoe was just a prototype of the design. Aside, Rick snickered with Maya about Aly -- the product of Darla and Thorne -- who'd fallen out of the stupid tree and had hit every branch on the way down.\n\n\nAly saw the pair laughing and smiling, and when she and Ivy exited, Aly took the smiles to mean that Rick was seriously considering her line. Ivy said not to get any hopes up until it was definite.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Maya sat on Rick's lap, and they laughed about Aly's broken shoe. Rick was amazed that everyone had been against him but had turned desperate to appease him. He remarked about Wyatt begging for his job, and Maya stated that people needed a lesson in humility and in who was the boss. \"Who says we can't have fun reminding them?\" Rick asked, and they kissed. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke wakes up disheveled on the couch beside her bottle. Bill looks at Katie in her robe and says that is a sight he will never get tired of. And tomorrow she will be Mrs. Bill Spencer again. Katie states she will ask Brooke to be her matron of honor and Bill is gonna talk to his best man. Rick puts Ivy down by saying her pieces look like something a soccer mom would buy at some outlet, they are not FC material. Then he scolds her for loaning out some pieces for Katie's wedding tomorrow. Aly says they just found out about the wedding so there was no time for Katie to get her own. He assures them he and Maya will not be going. And it has nothing to do with Caroline. Katie walks in on Brooke who quickly hides her bottle. Katie says she has some news \u0096 she and Bill are gonna get married tomorrow. With some hesitation, Brooke hugs her and says she is happy for her. Donna joins them and is also excited. Katie says it will be a very simple, lovely ceremony at the house. She thanks Brooke for giving her and Bill the chance to find each other again and although it is probably too much to ask she'd like Brooke to stand up for her as her matron of honor. Liam asks Wyatt if he is still in as they still need him on the inside of FC to get shares for the takeover. Wyatt asks if there is any other option if Steffy is the lynchpin and that doesn't happen. Bill bursts in and tells them to drop everything they are doing tomorrow as they are coming to a wedding between him and Katie. He announces that unfortunately he can only have one best man. He knows Wyatt has been sort of lost lately but he wants him to know he always has a family here. He would consider it an honor if Wyatt would be his best man. Wyatt looks at Liam and Liam gives him thumbs up, bro. Brooke is hesitant until Katie begs her, they need this as a family to mend; Brooke says yes. Aly is confident that Rick liked her shoe line if Ivy saw the smile on Rick and Maya's faces. What they didn't know is they were inwardly laughing at her. Wyatt asks Liam if he is really okay with Wyatt being the best man since their dad was his dad first. Liam says absolutely. Now they need to get out of here and get that bad scotch taste out of their mouth and get a burger. Wyatt says now he is talking his language. Bill tells Katie that the world kept turning while Brooke was gone and he does not want to spend the day talking about her in that big old house without a man. Donna tells Brooke that she can not believe she is going to be matron of honor when she is still in love with the groom. She also notices Brooke pouring more drinks. Brooke says she is over Bill and he will be her brother-in-law. She can not stare into his eyes and have that same seduction again. Donna asks if her drinking is how she will get him out of her system. Brooke says yes and she is not interested in what Donna has to say about that.",
