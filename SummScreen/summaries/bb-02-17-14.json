Surprised and pleased, Eric stated that he was proud of his sons and delighted that Ridge had the good sense to reclaim Brooke as his wife. Ridge claimed it was what he'd returned to town for -- to reunite his family and find his place in the company again.\n\n\nRidge acknowledged that he and Brooke had hit a temporary rough patch due to the Bill situation, and Rick asked if Ridge still harbored any resentment about it. Ridge wished that it had never happened and that Katie hadn't been hurt; however, he said that Brooke wasn't perfect, he loved her, and he couldn't wait to marry her.\n\n\nCarter and Maya arrived, and Ridge asked if Carter would officiate the wedding. Carter readily agreed. Ridge suggested that Carter and Maya work on their own wedding, but Maya claimed she was enjoying being engaged.\n\n\nCarter and Maya exited, and Ridge remarked that they were a lovely couple. Ridge became worried that he'd offended Rick, but Rick replied that he was happily married. Ridge stated that he was on his way to the same bliss, and the wedding couldn't happen fast enough for him.\n\n\nEric looked at a picture of Stephanie and said he missed her in times like those. Rick stated that she was always with them. Ridge quipped that he'd felt her disapproval all the way in Paris. Eric felt that Stephanie would approve of Brooke and Ridge, and Ridge was a lucky man. Ridge said he hadn't always appreciated Logan the right way. It had been a young man's mistake that he wouldn't make again.\n\n\nRidge exited, and Eric noted that something was on Rick's mind. Rick admitted that he was concerned about his mother and found it hard to believe that Ridge's deep feelings about Brooke's betrayal of Katie had just vanished. Eric reasoned that Ridge and Brooke had always been destined to be together, and Brooke would be much happier and more secure than ever with Ridge that time around.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Ridge flashed back to his reunion with Brooke that had happened shortly after he'd returned from Paris. He then thought of his time with Katie and the kids in the park.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Brooke, Pam, Donna, and Aly arrived to plan Brooke's wedding. Donna teased Pam about her relationship with Charlie, but Pam said she and Charlie were \"just friends with bakefits.\"\n\n\nAll the women cheered and hugged, excited that Brooke and Ridge were getting married. Donna assumed that Brooke and Ridge had had \"some Valentine's Day,\" but Brooke replied that they hadn't been together that day and were holding off until they got married. Brooke also explained that she and Ridge were also holding off on telling their son about the marriage until it was official.\n\n\nDonna moved on to discussing the ceremony, and Brooke imagined having something small with friends and family. Looking at Stephanie's portrait, Brooke said Stephanie was the only thing missing. Pam suggested having the wedding beneath the portrait; however, Donna suggested having it by the balcony doors -- just in case the portrait fell off the wall.\n\n\nBrooke liked the idea, but she was partial to the idea of the wedding beneath Stephanie's portrait. Pam asked who'd stand up for Brooke, and Brooke said she'd have to think about that one.\n\n\nThough Brooke wasn't sure she deserved such happiness, she was grateful.  Aly was excited about the Brooke and Ridge love affair, and Aly wanted to be in love to the point that it was torture not to be with her lover. Donna suggested that Aly dial that desire down just a bit.\n\n\nPam advised Aly to keep a little something for herself, no matter how in love she was. Pam regretted not doing that with Stephen, and it had taken a long time for her to pull herself back together after he'd left. Aly said she was a hopeless romantic, but making it in fashion was her top priority.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Thorne would attend the wedding. Aly said Thorne couldn't get away, and because she missed him, she wanted to visit him in Paris right away. Aly reasoned that she could prep for Hope there before Hope got in for the event. Brooke agreed to it and said they'd miss Aly at the wedding.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie spaced out on her meeting with Liam. Liam figured Ridge and Brooke were on Katie's mind. Liam appreciated Katie being an honorable person, but he said that if Katie and Ridge had feelings for each other, then Ridge should not be marrying Brooke.\n\n\nKatie asserted that she couldn't be stopping any weddings. \"Besides, haven't you heard? Ridge and Brooke belong together,\" she bitterly murmured. Liam stated that hearing it didn't make it true, and he had felt the connection between Katie and Ridge.\n\n\nLiam remarked that Brooke hadn't respected Katie's marriage, but Katie said she wasn't Brooke. Liam quipped that she was the \"un-Brooke,\" which was what Ridge probably needed. Katie didn't know why Liam was so adamant about it, but she insisted that Ridge and Brooke were meant to be.\n\n\nLiam contended that people had said the same about him and Hope. Katie, however, told Liam that she wouldn't be surprised if he and Hope reunited. A part of Katie wished she could be like Brooke and say \"the hell\" with everyone, but Katie refused to be the reason that R.J. wouldn't have his parents together.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Liam and Hope, and Liam said Wyatt monopolized all of Hope's time. Katie and Liam talked about being alone on Valentine's Day, and she revealed that her day had been lame because she'd just walked and read in the park. She recalled how much she'd enjoyed seeing Ridge with the kids the last time the four had been at the park, and they'd felt like a happy family.\n\n\nLiam replied that it could be Katie's family. Katie looked away, and Liam asked what had sparked her interest in poetry. Katie explained that the hobby had resurfaced from her younger years. She remarked that her and Ridge's favorite poem, \"Love's Philosophy,\" was in the book on her desk, and Liam said it was a beautiful poem. \"Yeah, it is,\" Katie sadly replied.\n\n\nLater, Katie was working alone when Brooke arrived with an important question for Katie. Brooke asked if Katie was getting closer to forgiving Brooke about Bill. Katie said she was, and Brooke became apologetic about what she'd done with Bill. Katie cut her sister off, saying she believed Brooke was sorry and wouldn't hurt Katie that way again.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that she was indeed sorry, and nothing like it would happen again. She was happy that the distance between her and Katie was dwindling and hoped that the wedding would draw their family closer. Brooke felt that love healed things, and she said it would mean everything to her if Katie would agree to stand beside her at the wedding. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Despite Brooke\u2019s persistence and honorable intentions, Katie is reluctant to grant her sister a considerable favor. Quinn joyfully uses Bill\u2019s feelings for Brooke and disdain for Ridge to get under his skin. Still unsure about Quinn\u2019s ulterior motives, Hope attempts to get more information from Wyatt about his mother. Ridge explains his history with Brooke to Maya and Carter.",
    "tvmega_recap": "A stake to the heart, but Ridge tells Eric that he chose Rick as his best man. Actually Eric is very pleased and says the family is on a roll right now. He built the company that way. He says he is proud of them both .and to Ridge he is glad he had the good sense to make Brooke his wife again. Ridge says this last one was rough. He wishes Bill had never happened, but Brooke is not perfect and he loves her anyway. He can't wait to marry her again. Eric says he thinks Stephanie would approve. She is always with them. Ridge says yes, he felt her disapproval all the way in Paris. Maya and Carter join in and Ridge asks Carter to officiate at the wedding and Carter agrees. Ridge tells Eric and Rick that he took Logan for granted. That is a young man's mistake and he will never do that again. Rick shares his doubt with Eric but Eric says Brooke is more happy than she's ever been. Ridge will make her very happy. Aly, Pam, Brooke and Donna meet at Eric's and make wedding chit chat and have a group hug. They even tease Pam about Charlie and she says they are just friends with bakefits. They discuss it but Brooke settles for marrying under Stephanie's portrait and hopes she does not come crashing down from the wall. Aly says Thorne is doing well but can't get away right now so she'd like to go visit him. Brooke thinks she should. Liam tries to give Katie a report and she is looking dazed in another direction. He asks if they can pretend that she is not distracted about Ridge and Brooke. He realizes that she does not want to inflict the same sort of pain on her sister that Brooke did to her, but if she and Ridge have feelings then he should not be marrying Brooke. And Katie is in a position to stop it and he thinks she should. She says hasn't he heard, Brooke and Ridge belong together. He says yes he has heard but that doesn't make it true. She says Ridge will never be more than her in-law and friend despite what Liam saw. She is not like Brooke and she is not going to be the reason RJ does not have both his mother and father. She asks about Hope and Liam says no, Wyatt is taking up all her time. He did not see her on Valentine's Day. Katie says he shouldn't take too much stock on that being as it is a manufactured holiday. She says she was miserable too. She walked around the park and read poetry, Liam even recognized what she was reading and said he liked it too. Brooke asks Katie to be her matron of honor. She is sorry she hurt her in the past but she feels the distance between them is getting smaller and this would help so much.",
