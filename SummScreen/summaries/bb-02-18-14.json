Brooke insisted that Katie had to accept, but Katie refused. \"I'm sorry, Brooke, but I can't.\" Katie said.\n\n\nBrooke apologized for her affair with Bill and what it had done to Katie. Brooke praised Katie because Brooke knew that Katie would never do anything like what Brooke and Bill had done. While Brooke had been talking, Katie flashed back to good times with Ridge at the park.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that Ridge was the only man that she had ever wanted. Brooke worried about why Katie would not forgive Brooke. Brooke tearfully said that they needed to recreate their bond as sisters. Brooke wanted to reunite her family with Katie at her side. \n\n\nKatie wondered why it was so important for Katie to attend the wedding. \"Do this for me; do this for all of us,\" Brooke begged. Katie relinquished, and a satisfied Brooke hugged Katie.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt, Hope, Ridge, and Pam were in a meeting. Ridge suggested that Quinn and Wyatt's work had been trend-setting. Wyatt gave most of the credit to his mother. Pam snarked that Wyatt and Quinn were ahead of the curve on many things. \n\n\nDiscussion turned to Brooke and Ridge's wedding. Wyatt remarked that Bill might reconcile with Katie after all. Ridge told Wyatt that Katie wanted nothing to do with Bill. Pam added that there was a man out there for Katie -- a great guy like Ridge.\n\n\nWyatt, Hope, and Pam left the office, and Ridge met with Maya and Carter. Ridge shared how he had first met Brooke and that he knew he had found \"the one\" when he looked into her eyes the very first time.  Ridge left, and Carter noted that Ridge and Brooke were \"one\" in the same way that Carter and Maya were one. They kissed. Carter and Maya shared how much they loved one another.\n\n\nAt Forrester's rooftop lounge, Pam grilled Hope about why Hope had reunited with Wyatt despite what they all knew about his involvement with the jewelry heist. Hope said that Wyatt wasn't dangerous, but Hope noted that Quinn could not be trusted. Pam assured Hope that Liam would never have done anything like what Wyatt had done. Hope agreed. \n\n\nWyatt, who was nearby, overheard the conversation. Wyatt added that he hoped Liam could find a good woman. Pam responded that Wyatt was exactly like his father. Pam left, and Hope and Wyatt discussed Pam and Quinn.\n\n\nWyatt understood that Pam was protective of Hope, and Hope said that Pam was family. Hope teased that Wyatt had acted like James Bond or Danny Ocean in \"palming\" a diamond. Hope suggested that Quinn was trouble. Hope intended to talk to Quinn. Wyatt defended his mother. He added that Quinn had a love/hate relationship with Bill.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Quinn walked in on a shirtless Bill, and Bill wondered why Quinn continued to show up unannounced at Wyatt's house. Quinn noticed that Bill had something bothering him. Quinn insisted it was Brooke Logan. Bill suggested that Quinn go to work to find Wyatt and leave Bill alone. Quinn noted how moody Bill had become. Quinn blamed Brooke for Bill's mood. Bill blamed Ridge.\n\n\nQuinn wondered if Bill missed having control of his company or Brooke's love. Bill confessed he missed Brooke more. Quinn responded that there was someone else special for Bill, but Bill maintained that he didn't want anyone else. He wanted Brooke. Quinn said that Brooke was about to marry Ridge. Bill looked pained.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie looked out her office window, and Ridge entered. Katie thanked Ridge for meeting with her. She told Ridge that she'd be at the wedding. Katie confessed that Brooke had made her feel terrible because Brooke had gone on and on about Katie's reputation as a good and honest person. Ridge agreed that Katie had been one of the most honest members of the entire family. \n\n\nKatie laughed, and she noted that she had attended a lot of Ridge and Brooke's weddings. \"You and Brooke are meant for each other,\" Katie said. \"This is the start of something new and exciting -- a brand new beginning.\" They hugged. Ridge looked pensive, and Katie cried.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke told Hope that Katie had refused to be her matron of honor, at first. Brooke felt something had bothered Katie. Hope said that Katie was probably jealous that Brooke had a fairy tale ending to her romance with Ridge. Hope added that Katie had no romance in her life. Brooke was convinced that it would help Katie to see that Brooke was over Bill.  Brooke felt it would be good for Katie to see Brooke marry Ridge. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Despite Brooke\u2019s persistence and honorable intentions, Katie is reluctant to grant her sister a considerable favor. Quinn joyfully uses Bill\u2019s feelings for Brooke and disdain for Ridge to get under his skin. Still unsure about Quinn\u2019s ulterior motives, Hope attempts to get more information from Wyatt about his mother. Ridge explains his history with Brooke to Maya and Carter.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is shocked that Brooke is asking her to be matron of honor. She even asks if Ridge knows about this. Brooke assures her that Ridge loves her and he will want her to be part of their special day. After an agonizing period of time and no good excuse not to, Katie reluctantly agrees. Bill turns around and finds Quinn back in Wyatt's house again just staring at him. He wonders why she is always creeping around. She says she likes to think what is going on in that dark, twisted mind of his when he's lost in thought ..or maybe just lost ..like he's been caught with his pants down. That hang-dog look on his face says it all; it's about Brooke. He says no; it's Ridge. They are getting married tomorrow. Quinn wants to know what is his plan. He says there is no damn plan. She guesses if it is not about control, then possibly could it be love. The great Bill Spencer is in love. But he can't have Brooke. She says she doesn't mean to sound trite, but there is someone else out there for him. Bill says he doesn't need anybody else; he just wants to share it with Brooke. Meanwhile all at the meeting assure Ridge they are ahead of schedule so they can clear the day for him tomorrow. Pam quips there have been several of those but Ridge says this one is especially significant. Wyatt says for Katie too as it might free up Bill to go back to her. Ridge says Katie does not want Bill; that he is sure of. He fills Maya and Carter in that the first time he met Brooke she was catering a party at his parent's house and he took one look and his life was changed forever. Brooke seems to live from her heart so it's that aura and that energy not just her beauty and sexuality. Wyatt and Hope laugh over the fact that many think his mother is crazy. Hope says she still intends to talk to her. He wishes she wouldn't, as they are all a little nutty. He states that she raised him all by herself so he thinks she deserves a free get out of jail card. And there is no one else she hates more than Bill, yet it's weird as there is no one else she loves more. At Katie's request, Ridge shows up at her office. She tells him that she will be at the wedding tomorrow. She says she did not want to at first but Brooke started in on family and loyalty and she tells Katie that Katie is the standard bearer of decency. He's glad she is going to be there to see it. She says tomorrow will be the start of a brand new beginning and she will be part of it. She gives him a big hug and says that is what she wants for him.",
