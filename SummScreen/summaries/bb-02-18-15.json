She looked at the crowd, and waved to everyone. \"Hello,\" she said awkwardly. Carter started the wedding celebration, and Brooke looked sick. Ridge looked worried, and Caroline asked if he was all right. Carter announced that Bill and Katie were about to marry, and Bill smiled. \"For good this time,\" Bill said.\n\n\nCarter announced that weddings were a time for new beginnings and fresh starts, but Bill and Katie had a relationship that didn't end. Instead, like a river, they had temporarily diverted and gone in different directions. \"Going with the flow,\" Brooke whispered, but everyone heard her.\n\n\nBill's sons, Liam and Wyatt spoke. Liam read a poem about compassion, patience, and forgiveness. \"Clothe yourselves with love,\" he said. Brooke inappropriately said, \"Cool.\"\n\n\nWyatt had found a quote about forgiveness. He thanked Katie and Bill for setting an example for all of them. He added that it had taken a lot of courage to reunite. Bill kissed Katie. Brooke played with her flowers.\n\n\nCarter read the marriage promises about sickness, health, for richer, and for poorer, and Katie said, \"I do.\" Carter read the same things for Bill. While Carter read the vows, Brooke distracted Bill by twitching her nose.\n\n\nCarter said it was time to exchange rings, and Brooke panicked. Brooke whispered to Katie that she'd forgotten the rings, but Carter said he had the rings. Katie said she didn't want to make a promise to Bill because promises could be broken. \"I'm capable of great things,\" she said. Katie added that she was capable of big mistakes, but she vowed to consistently love Bill. She called Bill her friend, her frustration, her happiness, and her hurt. \"My home, my heart,\" she added.\n\n\nKatie vowed to cherish \"who we are together and fight for it. That's what brought us to this place, smarter and stronger than we have ever been,\" she said. Bill smiled and caressed Katie's face as she spoke.\n\n\nBill placed the wedding ring on Katie's finger. \"My Katie,\" he said warmly. The ring, he added was a symbol of his love and devotion. He vowed to follow through on his promises. \"That's what you're going to get from me because that's what you deserve. And you're too smart to settle for anything less.\"\n\n\nBill reminded Katie that he wanted her, their family, and their life together. \"Nothing means more to me. I give you this ring so that you will never, ever forget that,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBrooke looked tearful as she watched. Bill kissed Katie, but Carter stopped them, and he teased that it wasn't time yet. Carter pronounced Katie husband and wife. Bill kissed Katie. Everyone clapped and stood up.\n\n\nBrooke smiled through her tears. Caroline dragged Ridge to his feet and to congratulate Bill and Katie. The group headed off to eat, drink, and celebrate. Bill and Katie kissed, and Brooke had another drink of Champagne. Ridge and Caroline hugged. Brooke grabbed two glasses of Champagne, and Katie asked if one was for her. Brooke covered. She said she'd wanted them to have their own private toast.\n\n\nKatie worried that Brooke was using the booze to numb the pain, but Brooke maintained that a girl should be allowed to party once in a while. Brooke professed that she was happy for Bill and Katie. She loved them and was glad they were together again.\n\n\nKatie wondered if Brooke had second thoughts. Brooke said she was happy. She hugged Katie, and they rejoined the party. Wyatt and Liam toasted Katie and Bill in honor of Will. Brooke shouted her support, and everyone looked uncomfortable. Music played, and Liam danced with Ivy. They smiled and laughed. Brooke was alone, and Caroline and Ridge danced and kissed.\n\n\nBrooke wanted to make another toast, and she grabbed another glass of Champagne. She toasted her beautiful sister and her husband. \"Cheers,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Deacon told Quinn that he'd missed her while she'd been in the workshop. She teased that someone had to make a living. The conversation turned to Bill and Katie's wedding. Deacon worried that Quinn might feel bad that Bill had gotten away.\n\n\nQuinn laughed. \"You must have me confused with Brooke,\" Quinn said. Deacon noted that Brooke had said the wedding didn't bother her, either, but he didn't believe Brooke or Quinn. Deacon recalled that Quinn had been sure that she wanted to be with Bill for the rest of her life at one time. Quinn said she was over it, but clearly Brooke hadn't been, and Quinn wondered if Brooke had hit on Deacon.\n\n\n\"No, she didn't,\" Deacon said. Quinn quizzed Deacon about why he'd been so worried about Brooke. He answered that she was not herself. She had wanted to do what was right for Bill and Katie.\n\n\nQuinn didn't feel sorry for Brooke, but Deacon did. He worried that Brooke had never been without a man and her family. She was teetering.\n\n\nLater, Quinn entered the room, wearing her black leather getup. Deacon was happy to see her. Quinn advised Deacon that Brooke and everyone else could take care of themselves. She promised to take care of Deacon. \"No, baby. I'm gonna take care of you,\" Deacon said. They kissed passionately. \n\n\n",

She quips someone has to pay the bills as his pretty face sure isn't. They end up talking about Bill and Katie's wedding and Brooke being alone now. Quinn wonders if she came on to Deacon. Deacon is not sure she can handle being alone right now. Quinn points out that Brooke went to Milan to give Bill and Katie a chance so it's too late for her to boo-hoo now.
