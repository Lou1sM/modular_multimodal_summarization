Rick said that he and Caroline hoped that everything would be perfect with all the plans they had made. \n\n\n\"Everything is perfect,\" Brooke said. Brooke gushed that she'd always had faith Ridge would return to her.  She thanked Rick for all the efforts he and Caroline had made to pull the wedding together in such a hurry. Rick noted that he had never seen his mother happier.\n\n\nDownstairs, wedding preparations continued, and Eric told Ridge that he was proud of him. Eric fixed Ridge's tie, and Ridge looked up at Stephanie's portrait. Ridge teased that his mother was watching while his dad dressed him. Ridge wondered how Stephanie would have reacted to the wedding. Eric left, and Ridge flashed back to poetry reading with Katie.\n\n\nCarter and Maya chatted, and Carter shared that he'd had a few ideas for the ceremony. Rick joined them, and Maya teased that Rick probably didn't want Ridge and Brooke's vows and ceremony to be better than Rick and Caroline's. Rick agreed, and he, Carter, and Maya all laughed. \n\n\nHope and Wyatt entered, and Rick coolly greeted Wyatt. Rick suggested that Hope would want to join Caroline, Donna, and Brooke upstairs. Hope asked about Katie. Rick said that he was sure Katie was on her way.\n\n\nRick went outside to meet with Ridge. Rick welcomed Ridge back into the family. Rick noted that Brooke was extremely happy to get together with Ridge again. Rick worried that Ridge and Brooke always managed to break up, and badly. Ridge promised that it wouldn't happen again.\n\n\nAt Katie's home, Katie flashed back to reciting poetry with Ridge. Liam interrupted and told her that Katie still had time to stop the wedding. Katie argued that she would not destroy Brooke's family. She refused to do what Brooke had done to her. \n\n\nLiam lamented that he had lost Hope and didn't want to see the same thing happen to Katie and Ridge. \"Ridge wants you -- stop overthinking it,\" Liam said. Katie disagreed, but Liam said there was no guarantee the marriage would last. Katie insisted that she would be a good sister and stand up for Brooke.\n\n\nLiam returned to his house, and Bill surprised him. Bill complained about Brooke's wedding. Liam agreed that he couldn't believe Ridge and Brooke were getting married. Bill considered driving to Eric's to stop the wedding, but Liam stopped him. \"If something or someone is going to stop this wedding, it can't be because of you or me,\" Liam said.\n\n\nUpstairs at the Forrester mansion, Caroline professed that she had a hot mother-in-law. Brooke teased that she was very happy that Caroline had married Rick. Hope entered and told her mother how beautiful she looked. Donna announced that she had received a text message from Katie, who was on her way. Brooke told Donna, Hope, and Caroline how much it meant that Katie would attend the wedding.\n\n\nBrooke gushed that she couldn't wait for Ridge to see her in her dress. Caroline asked if Brooke had something old, new, borrowed, and blue, and Brooke said she did. Brooke added that she had a piece of R.J.'s baby blanket sewn into her dress so he could be part of the wedding, because she and Ridge were going to surprise him after the wedding.\n\n\nKatie greeted Ridge when she arrived, and she told him that she was glad he was marrying Brooke. They discussed making sacrifices. Ridge suggested that some people made more sacrifices than others did.  Katie was happy that Ridge, Brooke, and R.J. would be a family again. Katie noted that Brooke was devoted to Ridge and R.J. \"And what will you be?\" Ridge asked. Katie insisted she'd be fine. \"I always am,\" she said.\n\n\nEric suggested that Wyatt needed to join him upstairs. Eric knocked on the door where Brooke was preparing for the wedding. Inside, Eric opened the safe that held Stephanie's extensive jewelry collection. Hope, Wyatt, Donna, and Caroline ogled the gems, and Wyatt noted that many of the pieces were one of a kind by some of the world's most famous designers. Eric removed a small brooch and handed it to Brooke. Brooke thanked him and hugged him. Eric and Wyatt left.\n\n\nKatie entered. Hope hugged Katie, and Katie complimented Brooke. \"You always made a beautiful bride -- don't cry,\" Katie said. They all giggled. Hope, Donna, and Caroline left. Katie said that she knew Brooke and Ridge would be happy. \n\n\nBrooke smiled, and Katie had tears running down her cheeks. Brooke thanked Katie. Brooke said that she had wanted Ridge to return for a long time. \"I know how much you adore him,\" Katie said. \"Cherish him,\" Katie added.\n\n\nBrooke professed that she knew how lucky she was, and she promised never to lose Ridge again. Donna interrupted to say that it was time to start. Brooke and Katie tearfully shared how much they loved each other.\n\n\nDownstairs, the wedding music started, and Ridge awaited his bride. Katie entered through the front door as the matron of honor. Katie walked to where Ridge and Brooke would take their vows. She locked eyes with Ridge. The wedding march started, and everyone turned to look at the front door. Brooke entered the front door -- a vision in white -- and everyone stood to greet her. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam reminds Katie that time is of the essence to let Ridge know that she wants to pursue a relationship with him. Katie thinks that she would be hypocritical if she were to act on her feelings for her former brother-in-law. Rick puts his past resentment towards Ridge aside for the sake of Brooke\u2019s happiness. Bill contemplates making a grand gesture towards Brooke as a means to win her back.",
    "tvmega_recap": "As Brooke is laying out her gown and her flowers on the bed, Rick walks in and says someone looks happy. He gives her a hug and says he could not be more thrilled for her when she says she is marrying the man of her dreams. She tells him he has made sure everything was perfect right down to the last detail, private and simple. She says she always had faith this day would come. Eric is adjusting Ridge's tie. Ridge looks at his mom's portrait and quips that his dad is still trying to dress him. Eric tells him that he is proud of him and he always knew that he and Brooke would end up together. How could anybody not be happy on this day? Both Ridge and Katie separately think of their times reciting poetry. Liam interrupts Katie and the first words out of his mouth is that it is not too late; she can still stop this wedding from happening. She doesn't want him to say that, although he says it is the truth. She and Ridge have feelings for each other and this wedding should not be happening. Ridge wants her, not Brooke so it is up to Katie. She tells him that he is being ridiculous as they are meant for each other. Being with Ridge would just cause Katie more pain and she would destroy a family. That is what Brooke did to her and she will not do that to her. He says she has to look out for herself and quit living in her sister's shadow. And he's only telling her this because he lost Hope temporarily and he doesn't want that to happen also to Katie. They are ideal for each other. She won't listen to any more. She says she has to think about RJ. She won't take away his family. She is going to be the good sister and go to that wedding and stand up for Brooke and support her and Ridge. Eric tells Carter that he will do fine officiating; he always does. Hope tries to reassure Wyatt's fears about his dad being all alone today. But he says any day with her is a good day. She says good answer and kisses him. Donna and Caroline give an orange juice cheer to Brooke and they all giggle when Hope joins them. Rick shakes Ridge's hand and welcomes him back into the family. They've been together a long time and he trusts that he knows what he is doing. Liam comes home and is scared silly by Bill who is walking around snacking on some snickerdoodles. Bill's in a foul mood because of Brooke's wedding. Liam wants to make sure he's not going to go do something stupid. Bill storms this is not easy for him, but no he will settle down, but that son of a bitch is marrying his woman. Liam says he knows; Bill is not the only one feeling that way. Eric finds Wyatt and invites him upstairs to see something that he thinks he will be very interested in. Wyatt is intrigued. Katie comes into the Forrester mansion and sees Ridge on the terrace and heads straight there. Ridge smiles and says hello to her. He says he is glad she is here. She says congratulations; she is glad he is marrying Brooke. She's trying to be a good sister. He says he is and Brooke has no idea how loyal she has been. Upstairs Eric opens the safe and tells the group that he has a surprise. He brings out three large trays of elegant pieces of jewelry from Stephanie's collection. Wyatt is blown away and says they are some rare, remarkable jewels from some of the most renowned designers in history. Eric picks out a gorgeous diamond broach and gives it to Brooke. He says he thinks Stephanie would have wanted her to have it and so does he. She is touched and thanks him. Katie joins the group and there are more group giggles. Katie tells Brooke that she makes a beautiful bride. They've been through a lot but they managed to come through it. She tears up when she says she knows Brooke and Ridge are gonna be so happy ad she wants that for them. Brooke says she knows how lucky she is to have another chance with Ridge and she is going to love him for the rest of her life. She thanks Katie for all she did. Bill changes his mind and tells Liam that he is homeless, no job so what else does he have to lose. He's going over there right now. Liam stops him and says if that wedding does not take place as it should it can't be because of them. Everyone takes their place. Katie walks into the foyer and both she and Ridge lock eyes and don't stop until she reaches the altar. Then Brooke follows with all eyes on her.",

The ceremony was held in the backyard of the mansion, and it was officiated by Rick and Caroline's son, Wyatt, as well as Wyatt's father, Eric.\n"
