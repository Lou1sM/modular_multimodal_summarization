    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick was worried because Eric was returning early that day. He hadn't told Eric that Rick and Maya had moved to the main house, where Maya's portrait had replaced Stephanie's. Maya was sure Eric would understand the pressure Rick had been under.\n\n\nEric arrived. Maya and Rick asked about the trip. Eric said his brother had boundless energy, but Eric had had enough of travelling. Eric thought it was important for him to be home.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Ridge kissed Caroline and announced that Eric was on his way home. Ridge was certain that Rick and Maya's days were numbered. Caroline believed that Eric could get through to Rick. Caroline and Ridge didn't believe Eric would tolerate Rick's behavior at the business, and Ridge hoped he might get to be CEO for more than five minutes.\n\n\nCaroline and Ridge discussed whether Eric would even want to return to work at Forrester. Caroline said Eric lived for Forrester and would want to be involved. Ridge wasn't so sure, but she believed that Eric would back Ridge upon seeing what a terrible job Rick was doing.\n\n\nMaya entered to announce that Rick and Eric were catching up in the other office. Caroline and Ridge informed Maya that her and Rick's king and queen ride was over. Ridge doubted Eric would support Rick, who'd been demeaning the entire staff.\n\n\nMaya said Rick had had to take a tough stance with some people. Caroline mentioned Rick's treatment of Aly and Ivy, but Maya didn't think it would make a difference. Caroline asked how dense Maya was. Maya said she believed in Rick, and Eric did, too.\n\n\nRidge asked if Maya thought Eric would be okay with her and Rick moving into Eric's home and bed. Ridge concluded that Maya hadn't believed the day would arrive, but it was there. \"Your picture's coming down. The locks are being changed, and Rick will no longer be CEO,\" Ridge predicted.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Rick asked to hear more about Eric's trip. Eric decided that they'd discuss it later. He wanted to know how things were at the company. Rick stated that running it had been rewarding but more challenging than he'd expected. Rick admitted that he'd done things and made choices that Eric might not agree with, and he didn't want to disappoint Eric.\n\n\nEric asked if Rick had something to tell him. The leery Rick stammered, not knowing how Eric would feel about what Rick had done. Rick explained that he and Maya had moved into the main house and master bedroom. He added that he'd removed Stephanie's portrait and replaced it with one of Maya. Rick explained that he hadn't gotten rid of Stephanie's portrait but had had it stored with care.\n\n\nEric asked what else. Rick said he'd lied to Ivy and Aly about remodeling the guesthouse so that he and Maya could move into the main house. He'd made up the remodeling thing and had done other things he was ashamed of. Rick hoped Eric would understand or eventually forgive him.\n\n\nEric asked if Rick thought Eric didn't know any of it -- or hadn't been keeping tabs on everything around there. Eric was angry that Rick had shot at Ridge and Caroline. Rick claimed he was sorry about it and said it would never happen again. Eric vehemently agreed that it wouldn't. Rick claimed Ridge and Caroline had destroyed Rick, but he knew the gun thing had been wrong. Rick said he deeply regretted it.\n\n\nEric asked if Rick still had feelings for Caroline. \"Not any good ones,\" Rick responded. Rick claimed to really love Maya, but he might have been too eager and might have gone too far with the portrait. \"This has been a terrible time for this company,\" Eric stated.\n\n\nEric decided to show Rick something. It was the quarterly report. Rick hadn't realized that it had already \"come out.\" Eric said that it was Rick's first report as CEO, and if Rick kept up with those numbers, Eric couldn't imagine where Rick would take the company in the future.\n\n\nEric congratulated Rick and said it was a job well done. The stunned Rick took the report and grinned. Eric was impressed with everything Rick had accomplished. Rick asked if Eric meant it. Eric said Rick had earned his position, and the sales figures had proved it. Rick had figured that profits had gone up, but he'd never expected the results on the report.\n\n\nEric said that the report should make Rick relax a bit, loosen his tie, and smile every once in a while. Eric decided that he'd put Stephanie's portrait in the guesthouse, where he would be staying. He wanted Maya and Rick to remain in the main house. Rick disagreed, saying it belonged to Eric. Eric stated that the house was too big for him, and Rick and Maya could enjoy it.\n\n\nRick didn't know what to say. Eric stated that Rick was running things well, and Rick had bounced back from Caroline and Ridge's betrayal. Rick attributed it to Maya being beside him. Eric said that Rick had a woman and a father who supported him. Eric was in awe of Rick's strength. Eric said that Rick hadn't felt Eric's fatherly love in the past, but Rick had it and Eric's loyalty \"now.\"\n\n\nEric was proud of Rick and loved him. Rick said Eric didn't know what it meant to him. Rick vowed to do right by Eric and make Eric proud. The men hugged.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam and Ivy kissed, and he tried to persuade her to stay longer. He loved it when she spent the night, and she said the planned to do it more often. Steffy called Liam as Ivy was preparing to leave for work. Steffy wanted to talk about the plan, and he asked her to meet at his house.\n\n\nAfter the call, Ivy asked if Steffy was in on the plan. Liam explained that he was meeting Steffy, but he didn't know if she'd be willing to go behind Ridge's back to execute the plan. Liam asked if Ivy would be \"home\" after work, and she stated that she'd be there as soon as she could be.\n\n\nLiam asked if Ivy was really okay with him collaborating with Steffy. Ivy asked if it would involve Steffy spelling out her intentions to be with Liam. Ivy claimed not to be worried and to feel comfortable about her relationship with Liam. They kissed, and Ivy left.\n\n\nLater, Steffy arrived in a bikini and sarong. Liam was surprised by the sensual sight, and Steffy said he knew how she loved the beach. The two caught up about Bill's wedding, and Steffy asked if Liam had taken Ivy as his date. \"You think I wouldn't?\" Liam asked.\n\n\nSteffy helped herself to a beer and expressed surprised that Bill hadn't confiscated Liam's house. Steffy missed the beach and joked that no one went swimming in Paris's river -- except Ivy. Steffy asked Liam go for a swim, but he noted that it was too cold for that. She believed the temperature would get the blood pumping.\n\n\nSteffy slipped off the sarong and revealed a bikini that was mostly thin straps straining to connect flaps of material together. She asked if Liam was scared. He scoffed. He said he'd do it, but it had better score him points about the plan. She laughed it off as if she hadn't heard him.\n\n\nLater, the wet Steffy and Liam rushed back into the house to dry themselves off. It had invigorated her, but he thought he might freeze to death. She felt that it was like old times, and Liam said he'd forgotten how fun she was. \"How could you forget?\" she asked and kissed him. \n\n\n",

Neither expected him back so soon and he has not told him they are in the house and her portrait is on the wall. Caroline senses that Ridge is in a good mood and he tells her about his dad coming back early. Perhaps he has gotten wind of things and wants to come oversee. Liam is with Ivy when Steffy calls and says she is thinking about his plan and would like to talk. He invites her over. He tells Ivy but he still can not get a read on Steffy over the phone so they will have to wait and see if she is in or out if she won't go behind Ridge's back. Eric says his trip was a real adventure. His brother is a wild man and he'd had enough and he thought it important that he be here at FC. Eric says they can talk about the trip later as now he wants to hear what has been going on around here. He knows it was a lot to juggle but always stay true to company and family. Rick says he has done some things that Eric probably would not approve of and the last thing he wants to do is disappoint him. Ivy tells Liam that she is not worried about them. She pretty well knows as Steffy spelled it out that she wants to come back and run the company and get back with Liam. So she will leave them alone to work this out. Caroline tells Ridge that his dad lives for FC so he will want to come back and run things. Maya pops in to let him know that Rick is with Eric now. Ridge thinks that is good and he tells her that her and Rick's little ride is now over. Nervously Rick tries to explain a few things that he is ashamed of and hopes his dad will forgive him. Things like moving into his bedroom and taking Stephanie's portrait down and putting up Maya's. And he told Aly and Ivy he was having the guest house remodeled and that was not true. Eric listens without a word but then adds what made Rick think that Eric wasn't keeping tabs on all of this while he was gone. Steffy shows up at Liam's and is in a rocking bikini. She dares him into a ocean swim even though it is 55 degrees. Ridge tells Maya that Rick moved into the house without his dad's permission and he slept in his bed without his permission and he has upset a lot of the employees and Eric is not going to put up with that. Rick says looking back he realizes he went too far and he hopes his dad can overlook it this time as it won't happen again. He and Caroline are over and he is in love with Maya. Eric shows him the bottom line of the sales figures. These first figures with Rick as CEO, a job well done. Steffy and Liam rush back in and towel off. She says she feels great, better than she remembered. But she says she enjoys other things more. She kisses him quickly. Ridge tells Maya that he thinks Rick and his lead model will be out of a job by the end of the day. Rick is happy that his dad is not mad at him. Eric says he can stay put as he has earned all of this. He can even stay in the main house. He is CEO now and he is doing it well. Eric will move into the guest house. He is happy for Rick with a woman that supports him. He wants him to know he may not have felt his unconditional love before but he is proud of him, loves him and he has his support now.
