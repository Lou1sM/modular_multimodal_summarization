Dante says Felicia believed Nick was the father until the DNA test proved otherwise. Dante apologizes about telling Nick this news on the day of his daughter's memorial service. Bridget walks in and senses something is wrong. Nick is afraid Dante will tell her that he is Dominick's father. However, Dante does not mention it. Instead, he tells Bridget that he was at the hospital when she lost Nicole but he did not want to interfere with the family. Bridget is touched. Dante hands Bridget and Nick a card and offers his condolences. Bridget invites Dante to the memorial service and then goes to get the baby. \n\n\nMeanwhile at the Forresters', Felicia tells Taylor and Stephanie that Dante is being selfish and not thinking about what is best for Dominick. Stephanie says at least Dante is respecting Bridget and Nick by not making an announcement at the memorial service. Everyone begins to wonder where Bridget is and Ridge says she went to Felicia's to get Nick and Dominick. Felicia is worried when she realizes Nick, Bridget and Dante are together. \n\n\nAs Stephanie walks over to get a drink Jackie approaches her and thanks her for having the service. Jackie tells Stephanie she is surprised Stephanie has managed to go an hour without calling her a slut. Stephanie replies that some things are so obvious there is no need to comment on them. \n\n\nFinally, Bridget and Nick arrive with Dominick . Felicia can see that Nick knows the truth. When Nick gets close to Felicia, he asks her to tell him Dante is lying, but she can't. \n\n\nAs the ceremony begins members of the family make offerings in honor of Nicole. Darla brings a lilac from her neighbor's garden and says every time she smells lilacs she will think of Nicole. Massimo brings a picture of a racing ship that he named Nicole. Jackie brings Rosemary which stands for remembrance because it can survive all kinds of rough conditions and still retain its' power. Ridge brings a fake pearl necklace that he used to wear in college and that Bridget used to play house with when she was little. Ridge said whenever Bridget put the necklace on she was a mother and that Bridget was dreaming of Nicole even when she was a little girl. Eric and Stephanie bring a picture of a Nicole Rose. They say they have planted this rose in their garden, to honor Nicole. \n\n\nBridget walks to the front of the room, holding Dominick and says she is overwhelmed by the family's gifts, thoughts and love. She tells them she is going to dry all the flowers and save all of the gifts so she can show them to Dominick one day and tell him about his sister. She believes Nicole is Dominick's guardian angel. She then reads a prayer for Nicole. \n\n\nAfter Bridget's finishes her prayer, she encourages Nick to speak. While Nick is holding Dominick he begins to talk about the horrible pain of losing a child and how hollow and empty it makes you feel. He begins to get more and more upset and then he hands the baby over to Brooke and leaves the room. \n\n\nFelicia follows him out and tells him she had no idea Dante was the father. She wants Nick to feel the same way about the baby as he did before. Nick says that is impossible because every time he looks at Dominick he will see another man's son. He says Dante will not let this go. Nick is worried about Bridget because she just lost a daughter and now she is going to lose a son. \n\n\nBack at Felicia's, Bridget comes by to drop Dominick off and questions Dante about all of the time he is spending with Felicia. Dante tells her he and Felicia have a history and Bridget apologizes for being nosy. Dante tells her she can ask him anything. He tells her he loves her and would never intentionally hurt her. Bridget becomes suspicious and asks him what he is trying to tell her. \n\n\n",
