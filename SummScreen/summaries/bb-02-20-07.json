    "tvmega_recap": "In pouring down rain, Phoebe persists in asking Rick for a ride home in his truck. He argues, but she ends up getting in. He then explains that it is her dad; he doesn't want to get her in trouble. She professes it will be okay, that she won't tell him. Rick gives in and starts driving even though he's due at the office. The truck becomes temperamental and needs to cool off; so does Phoebe! Stephanie asks Pam about her mom and she says they looked at condos all afternoon. Stephanie confides that she saw her with Eric the other day and no she does not think they crossed that line, but she does think she is playing on his good nature and sympathy. Pam resents Stephanie's suggestions and reminds her that she spent three decades taking care of her mother's every whim, with no help from Stephanie. Is it too much to ask for her to want something for herself and to get out of Chicago? And poor little good girl, Pam, she has to trick her husband into being the knight in shining armor. She rails she never had any life at all in Chicago and Ann always ran away any man that would have been vaguely interested in her. They will stay in Los Angeles and Stephanie will deal with that. They are family. At Forrester's, Brooke says she is sorry. Guess she didn't have as much pull with Nick that she thought she had. And the press is saying that Donna is the weak link in his operation. Ridge doesn't want to wait on Nick's input, they need to get going on this. And he'd like to send him back to Europe and get him as far away from Phoebe as he can. Eric presents Thorne, Felicia, Brooke and Ridge his plans. Rick calls and makes his apologies to Brooke about his truck, but not to tell Ridge that Phoebe is with him. He'll only go ballistic. Ridge too gets a phone call from Taylor looking for Phoebe. Brooke has to confess so they won't all be worrying. Ridge makes a big thing about Rick defying him about staying away from his daughter. And he accuses Brooke of protecting her son rather than being honest with him. Alone in the truck with nothing but time on their hands, Phoebe confesses her fears to Rick and they are drawn to each other and kiss.",
