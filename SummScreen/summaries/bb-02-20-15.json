Eric apologized for making Rick feel as if he'd never earn them. Rick didn't want Eric to make excuses for Rick's behavior. Rick realized that he'd been vindictive and had acted out blindly. Rick stated that he had to do better.\n\n\nEric was glad Rick understood it. \"Everything that you thought was yours, the job, your mother, me, Caroline. Everything was taken away from you and given to Ridge, and he could turn his back on all those things any time he wanted. Well, no more,\" Eric decided. Eric declared that it was Rick's office and Rick's job. Rick had a business acumen that Eric had never had. Eric wanted Rick to run with it.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Maya, Ridge, and Caroline exchanged retorts regarding how things would pan out for Rick and Maya. Maya believed that even if Rick lost his title, he wouldn't be penniless. Caroline asked how Maya justified her opportunism.\n\n\nMaya claimed that she hadn't been handed everything in life as Ridge and Caroline had. Learning how to want had helped her to figure out how to get what she wanted. She said that Ridge and Caroline had wound up together as effortlessly as the maid laying out their clothes. Ridge asked if Maya wanted his maid to pack things, and Maya sneered and left.\n\n\nLater, Maya entered the CEO's office and saw a grim Rick sitting on the settee. Figuring that things had gone badly, she said that Eric loved Rick, and everything could be repaired in time. Rick asked her to be honest with him and tell him how bad he'd been to Ridge, Caroline, and everyone at the office. Maya couldn't answer that because she felt she was just like him.\n\n\nMaya decided she'd take care of everything with the move, but Rick revealed that he was still in charge. Rick wasn't very proud of himself, but he stated that his father was. Maya hugged him. Rick relayed that Eric had said the mansion was their home, and the office was Rick's. Rick said he'd be a better man for her. She stated that he didn't have to be any different, but he replied that he was already different because of her.\n\n\nRick felt that Maya was his safe place, and he loved her. He assured her that he wasn't using her to send a message, and they'd have a great life together. He promised to make her dreams happen, but she said it was already done. They hugged.\n\n\nBack in Rick's old office, Eric entered. Ridge hailed the arrival of the cavalry. Ridge was sorry if Eric had cut his trip short and asked if Eric was staying. Eric said he might stay or go, and he was determined to become unpredictable in life.\n\n\nEric asked if Ridge had seen the quarterly report. Ridge hadn't and said they didn't need numbers to see how crazy Rick had been. Eric asked what Caroline and Ridge were doing together in the office. Caroline said working, and Eric asked if it had become that wherever one was, so was the other.\n\n\nRidge said to deal with one thing at a time. Ridge had a plan to gather the shareholders to deliver a vote of no confidence in Rick. Eric might have to step down so that his contract with Rick would be nullified, but it was a temporary move just to get Rick and Maya out of Eric's chair, house, and bed. Ridge asked if Eric knew that Maya had Rick had moved into the house.\n\n\nEric stated that Rick was his son and could sleep in his house and bed. Eric wanted to know the sleeping arrangements that Caroline and Ridge had. Ridge said his relationship with Caroline wasn't the problem. Eric murmured that Ridge wouldn't think so.\n\n\nCaroline relayed that she and Rick had told Eric that the marriage was done. Eric asked how Rick should feel about confronting the failure every hour and seeing Ridge and Caroline together in the dark office. Eric suggested that they not discuss bad behavior until they took care of their own. Eric decreed that Rick had Eric's full support and his old job, too.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Ivy and Wyatt worked together, but he didn't think she needed his assistance for the simple job. Ivy revealed that she'd asked him there because she knew about the plot to take over Forrester. Wyatt was surprised that Liam had told her. Ivy believed that Liam was honest and hadn't wanted to lie to her about why Steffy was getting cozy around him.\n\n\nWyatt didn't know Steffy well but had heard she drove a hard bargain. Ivy revealed that Steffy and Liam were meeting that day at Liam's house. Wyatt said it was none of his business, but the meeting might not be a good idea. He recognized a quality in Steffy that Quinn also had. \"They don't wait for an invitation. They just charge on in,\" Wyatt stated.\n\n\nIvy got upset and asked if Wyatt was telling her to distrust Liam. Wyatt said he just knew how Steffy operated. Ivy assumed Wyatt believed that Liam would toss her aside and move Steffy back into the house. Ivy said the two were probably in bed together at that moment.\n\n\nWyatt refused to take it that far. Ivy wouldn't, either, because Liam wouldn't lie to her. Ivy bagged up her things, arguing that life was simpler when one didn't lie to loved ones. Wyatt stared quizzically as Ivy concluded the meeting and stormed off.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Steffy kissed Liam. She claimed to be doing what felt natural and suggested he do the same. Removing her arms from around his neck, Liam said he'd made her a business proposition, but she kept changing the subject. She responded that she'd made him a proposition. \"You get what you want. I get what I want. Isn't that fair?\" she asked.\n\n\nSteffy guessed Liam was disappointed in her. Liam didn't know how to be disappointed by being loved, and he asked if reuniting would really have to be a contingency to the plan. Steffy indicated that he was confusing two different things, and Eric might make the company a nonissue by dealing with Rick on his own. Liam asked who Eric would put in charge if he could remove Rick.\n\n\nSteffy assumed it would be Ridge, who'd been there first. Liam noted that Ridge had also walked away from it. Steffy figured that Liam blamed for her walking away, too. Liam asked if he'd blamed or accused her, and she said she was better at understanding what he didn't say versus what he did say. He admitted that he'd suffered losses. Steffy had been one of them, and he hadn't gotten a vote in it.\n\n\nSlipping her arms around his neck again, Steffy asked if Liam remembered how good they'd been. \"When we were,\" he replied. She asked if he thought they could be again. Liam said she'd broken his heart. She claimed to have done what she'd thought was best for him.\n\n\nLiam told Steffy that she wasn't his mother, and she wasn't his doctor. He hadn't needed her to protect him or improve him. He'd needed her to love him and stay. Steffy stated that she could do each of those things. He conveyed that it was too late, and he was in love with someone else.\n\n\nLiam asked if Steffy was okay. Steffy claimed she wasn't that easily hurt; however, she believed that Liam was settling, and what he had with Ivy wasn't the same as what he'd had with Steffy. Liam believed that since then, he'd learned some things about himself. Steffy decided that he was afraid something would happen, and she'd leave again.\n\n\nLiam said it wasn't the case, but Steffy conveyed that she wouldn't because she'd learned a few things, too. She asked if he understood that she was agreeing to the plan, and they'd run Forrester together -- as lovers. He asked if they'd gotten down to nonnegotiable demands. She claimed it was the only way she saw herself doing it.\n\n\n\"And the way you look at me...\" Steffy uttered and kissed Liam. \"I can tell it's what you want, too.\" Liam said her kisses were still sweet, but he wasn't as easily led by them as he'd been before.\n\n\n\"Really...\" Steffy said and pushed Liam down onto the sofa cushions. Just then, Ivy entered the house and saw Steffy sliding on top of him. \n\n\n",

He's brought some business acumen to this job that Eric never had. This is now his job. Ivy works with Wyatt on some jewelry designs. She says she knows why he came back .the takeover of Forrester. Wyatt says Steffy can drive a hard bargain. Ivy says she knows and Liam is with her right now. Wyatt says he knows it is not his business but was it a good idea of Ivy to leave when she knew Steffy was there. Steffy keeps changing the subject and tries to kiss Liam again saying she is only doing what comes naturally to her; perhaps he should try it too. He reminds her she is taking the subject of business and trying to make it personal. So he doesn't like the contingency of her helping only if he becomes her husband again. She says she always was better at understanding what he didn't say than what he does say. Maya badmouths Caroline and Ridge and she is not worried about Rick coming out of Eric's office penniless. Ridge asks if she wants his maid to get a hotel room for the night. She points out that she did not grow up with a sports car or a walk-in closet, but she did all right and she has her dignity. She makes a dig at Caroline that Ridge has neckties that is older than she is. Maya asks Rick if he is okay. He seems down and says there is a lot to repair. How bad has he been to everyone. She muses that he is no worse than she is. She will take care of everything and get movers to box everything up and move out. Rick says he may not be so proud of himself but his dad is. Eric meets Ridge who says the Calvary is here. Ridge says he expects some changes around here will be made. He knows nothing about the quarterly figures but that doesn't matter. All that matters is that Rick leaves. Eric's tone suggests that is not going to happen. Rick tells Maya that not only is he still CEO but they can stay in the house while Eric insists on going to the guest house and will take Stephanie's portrait there. Ivy thanks Wyatt for his advice but says she can not lie to the people she loves so she doesn't want to talk about this any more. Liam tells Steffy that she broke his heart before so he can not trust her again. She says it is not too late and she can do better this time. He says no because he is in love with someone else. Eric tells Ridge that Rick is his son and he is welcome to sleep in his bed .including Maya. He tells Ridge and Caroline not to talk about bad behavior until they examine their own .being in each other's arms all the time right in front of Rick. Rick tells Maya that she is his safe place and he has never had that before. He loves her and she is not a symbol or message that he is trying to send. He will make all her dreams come true. Steffy tells Liam that she is not that easy to hurt so where is her little cousin. Is he willing to settle. He says Steffy is a force to be reckoned with. She says she is saying yes to his demands to boot Rick out and Ridge in but he has to be her lover. She kisses him again. He says they are still as sweet as they used to be but he's not as easily led as he used to be. She pushes him down on the couch and is on top of him when Ivy walks through the door and sees them.",
