    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy said she had wanted to talk to Brooke and Ridge about their wedding. Ivy claimed that she needed to talk to Brooke \"before you start making plans.\" She added that she knew some things they would want to hear. Ridge nervously said that Brooke was on her way out, but Brooke said she would like to hear what Ivy had to say.\n\n\n\"What is it, Ivy?\" Brooke asked. Ivy glared at Ridge. Ivy said she had some options for them because she'd heard that they and Steffy and Liam had been considering an Australian wedding, and she wanted to offer an insider's point of view to getting married in Australia. \"Double up. It's something to consider,\" she said. Brooke thanked her. She asked to talk about it later because she had some work to do. Brooke kissed Ridge, and she left.\n\n\nRidge asked what Ivy thought she was doing. \"What do you think you're doing? You and Quinn? I saw you and Quinn outside Eric's house,\" she said. Ivy angrily told him that his father could have seen them. \"Don't you care about him?\" she asked. Ridge encouraged her to \"leave this alone.\" Ivy refused. She quizzed Ridge and wanted to know if he was toying with Quinn or trying to get back at his father by kissing Eric's father's wife.\n\n\nRidge countered that it wasn't what Ivy thought, but she fired back that she knew it wasn't the first incident. She had learned about the outdoor shower and the steam room. She accused him of having an affair with Quinn and betraying Brooke and his father.\n\n\nRidge maintained that he was committed to Brooke, and Quinn had a harmless crush on him. Ivy wondered if the feelings were mutual. \"Everyone in this building knows how I feel about her,\" Ridge said. He added that he appreciated Ivy's concern for him and his dad, but she needed to back off.\n\n\n\"There's nothing going on, and you saw a couple of people being stupid,\" Ridge said. He questioned why Ivy would want to start something after the family had finally gotten back together. \"You want to be the one that breaks that up?\" Ridge asked. Ivy was exasperated. She said she would let it go \"for now, but know that I'm watching you and Quinn.\" Ivy left, and Ridge looked relieved.\n\n\nThomas and Steffy discussed Thomas' designs in another office at Forrester. Steffy remarked that the designs looked good. \"It's a bit odd that you're in here giving me critiques instead of Dad,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nSteffy tried to make peace with Thomas, but he was angry and told her that she had no design experience. She reminded him that many Forrester CEOs had not been designers. \"It's the way things are. Get on board,\" she said.\n\n\nPam interrupted. She said the incident with Steffy pushing Sally Spectra's face into the cake at the wedding had gone viral. Thomas laughed and said it was all a publicity stunt, but it didn't make them enemies of Spectra.\n\n\nSteffy returned to the sketches. She said that some of his designs didn't pop like one of them. Thomas suggested she take another look \"when you're a little less cranky.\" Steffy countered that she was doing her job. Thomas argued that she should pull out some of their granddad's old designs. \"Why use my designs? I'm just a grunt, after all -- a hired hand,\" he said.\n\n\nSteffy maintained that Thomas was a valuable member of the team, but he said he was \"working for my little sister.\" He was upset that he had been passed over. Steffy tried to appease him, but she reminded him that it was her job as CEO to critique designs, and CEOs didn't have to have design experience. Thomas told her not to use any of his designs. \"I don't care,\" he said. He took his designs and left. Steffy looked upset.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Darlita, Saul, and Sally looked at the video in which Steffy had pushed Sally's face into the cake at the Forrester wedding. \"Shirley needs to see this,\" Darlita said. Sally reminded Darlita that Shirley had been the one shooting the video. Darlita said she looked ridiculous, but Sally enthused that the video was trending. \"It was totally worth it,\" she said.\n\n\nDiscussion turned to the fashion show scheduled for the next day. Saul reminded Sally that silk and sequins weren't free. Sally countered that they only needed to give buyers a taste -- a small sample. Saul shouted that they had no place to hold a fashion show because the showroom was a disaster area without lights or a sound system.\n\n\nSally said they would hold the show in the office, and she asked Darlita how many people had said they would attend. Darlita said they had sent out more than 100 invitations but no one planned to attend except Darlita, Shirley, and Sally. Sally glared at Saul, and he made an excuse. Sally was irritated.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill met with Eye on Fashion reporter Jarrett Maxwell to discuss the Spectra fashion show. Jarrett said no one intended to attend. Bill said he wanted Jarrett to attend. Jarrett balked that he was a respected voice and fashion reporter.\n\n\nBill said it was the new Sally Spectra, and her great-aunt had always made front page. \"Why would you want me to attend this carnival side show?\" Jarrett asked. Bill explained that he wanted the Spectra building. \"And you're going to help me get it,\" he said.\n\n\nBill explained that he had big plans for the property. He wanted to buy the building, tear it down, and make room for Spencer Tower -- he pointed to a model that he had in his office. He explained that C.J. Garrison had reneged on a deal to sell because he wanted to give his cousin a chance to revive his mother's company.\n\n\nBill ordered Jarrett to write a review that would embarrass Spectra enough to throw in the towel. Jarrett argued, but Bill ordered him to cover the event. He grabbed Jarrett's phone and sent a revised RSVP to Sally that he would attend the fashion show.\n\n\nBill encouraged Jarrett to give Spectra a scathing review. \"Sink Spectra. Don't hold back -- make it the worst review you have ever written,\" he said. Jarrett objected that Bill wanted him to be a hired gun. Bill wondered if Jarrett wanted to defy him. \"No, sir,\" Jarrett answered.\n\n\nAt Spectra, the phone rang, and Darlita discovered it was Shifty, Sally's loan contact. Sally picked up the phone and told Shifty that money would be rolling in after her fashion preview because orders would be pouring in.\n\n\nSally hung up and said they needed to rustle up some reporters. The text message that Bill had sent as Jarrett arrived, and Darlita announced that Jarrett Maxwell of Spencer Publications would attend the fashion preview. They all celebrated. Sally promised that the next time they had a preview, they would need to rent a stadium. \"Spectra is back,\" she said.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Ivy feels compelled to have an informative talk with Brooke which Ridge can witness. Ivy then swallows up her anger towards Ridge for kissing Quinn last night and instead volunteers to help the happy couple to plan a wedding in Australia. Pam walks in on Steffy and Thomas having another cool conversation as he does not take her criticism on one of his latest designs very well. Jarrett tells Bill that he was invited to Spectra Fashions' preview but no one from the press is going. Surprisingly, Bill assigns Jarrett to attend the showing - with a clear agenda: to write the worst review ever. Sally, Saul and Darlita rehash the cake incident with Steffy and the online publicity it got the company. Despite Saul's concerns that they do not have a proper collection yet, Sally is highly optimistic about the preview of their first few designs. Just as the harsh reality begins to sink in that no one from the fashion press accepted their invites, Darlita reports that \"Eye on Fashion\" just signed on for tomorrow.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Ivy that Brooke was on her way out. Ivy says but this is very important so they return to Ridge's office. Thomas is working on his designs and Steffy praises him. She says she knows he is not happy with the situation but she wishes he could get on board. Sally tells Saul and Darlita that the almost another food fight was so worth it. Shirley is home still trying to get the cake out of her uniform. Sometimes you have to forgo your dignity to get your point across. Saul tells her this office is still a disaster area. There is not enough lighting and they have no sequins or enough supplies. Darlita tells them she sent out 120 invitations and only four are going to show up. Sally says this is not good. They need press and they need it now. Jarrett stops in on Bill and wonders why he wants him to attend the Spectra fashion show. Jarrett says they have always been at the lower level so why should he put in an appearance. Bill says he wants that space and Jarrett can help him get it. He does not want the business but he wants that building. That means Sally has to fail and he knows she will not do that immediately, but the pen is mightier than the sword. Pam comes in and shows Thomas and Steffy the video Shirley took at the wedding. Ivy tells Ridge and Brooke that she thought she could give them advice if they are thinking of getting married in Australia. As she leaves Ridge catches her and he asks what is she really doing here. She turns it on him and asks what is he doing \u0096 with Quinn? He says if she really cares about her uncle Eric then she will leave this alone. He is marrying Brooke, that is the bottom line. Thomas tells Steffy that she really does not need his designs, he is only the grunt around here. Bill asks Jarrett to show him the invitation; he wants him to go to this glorious revival. Then Bill responds for Jarrett by text. It's done. Sally says this is awkward; a show with no press. Darlita answers her Smartphone and all are joyful that Jarrett will attend. Ridge tells Ivy that he is committed to Brooke; everybody knows how he feels about Quinn and this is not an affair. They were stupid but this is not something to tell Eric. She says okay but just let him know that she is going to be watching him and Quinn. Thomas says Steffy would feel the same if she was passed over by a little sister. She says she is sorry, but that is reality and she just wishes they could get along better. Saul says if Jarrett Maxwell is coming then that means something. It could put Spectra on the map. Bill tells Jarrett do not hold back. He wants the worst review he has ever given. He doesn't want to wait for them to fail on their own; do it now. Bill rants that he has looked at every location he can find and Spectra is sitting right on top of it. He doesn't care what Jarrett feels about Spectra fashions; he wants his worst review and they will be wiped off the map.",
