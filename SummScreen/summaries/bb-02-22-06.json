As Nick and Stephanie are leaving the room Stephanie tells Nick, he should tell Bridget tonight that Dante is Dominick's father. Once Felicia and Bridget are alone, Bridget thanks Felicia again for letting her bring Dominick home.  Bridget tells Felicia how much she admires her strength and Felicia says she admires Bridget's strength too.  Felicia makes Bridget promise to continue to be strong and never abandon Dominick.  Bridget reassures her telling Felicia she sees Dominick as her son and nothing will ever change that.\n\n\nMeanwhile at Felicia's, Stephanie confronts Dante and tells him to stay out of this drama, for Bridget's sake.  Dante says he cannot because he is Dominick's father and he loves Bridget.  He tells Stephanie he has been more concerned about Bridget than anyone else in her family has. Dante tells Stephanie he wants Bridget to be Dominick's mother and his wife.  He wants to save Bridget from Nick who is still in love with Brooke.

Nick does not understand why he loses every child he gets close to.  Brooke hugs him and tells him one day he will have a child of his own.  Nick says he should have left LA.  Brooke disagrees reminding him Dominick will always be a part of his life because that is what Felicia wants.  Nick says that will be Dante's decision, not Felicia's.  Nick is worried about what all of this is going to do to Bridget.  As they are talking Bridget walks in with the baby and after greeting them takes Dominick to bed.  Before Brooke leaves, she tells Nick he has to tell Bridget the truth.  \n\n\nAfter Bridget has puts Dominick to bed she tells Nick what great parents they will be to Dominick.
