Later, the two discuss kids, Nick says that he always wanted to be a parent, but it might not be in the cards. Taylor states that he would be a great dad. She believes the right woman will come along for him sometime, but he seems skeptical. He tells Taylor she's a good mom to her kids. As they continue to talk, Taylor rubs Nick's back and shoulders and assures him he will find the right woman because he's a pretty good catch, and that if she had been in Brooke's shoes, then she stops. Nick waits for her to continue, but instead of finishing, Taylor kisses him. \n\n\nAt Brooke's place,  Phoebe and her dad argue about a Rick/Phoebe relationship with Phoebe pointing out they are not related as she declares her love for Rick. She claims they will do whatever they want, and no one can stop them. Ridge says he can't let this happen, and calls Rick a \"loser,\"  someone who would take advantage of an 18-year-old girl. They continue to disagree as Brooke returns from seeing Rick off since Ridge sent him packing. She tells Ridge her son is not a loser. After Phoebe heads upstairs, Brooke says Rick will return to Europe and that will end the relationship with Phoebe, but Ridge worries Phoebe will follow him. He adds that the relationship \u2013 they are both Forresters \u2013 is inappropriate, and they must put a stop to it before the press gets a hold of it. It would destroy the family and the new Forrester Originals business. And, he claims Rick is all wrong for Phoebe. \n\n\nAt Bridget's, Rick knocks on the door and asks to stay for a few days while Bridget inquires what's up with him and Ridge. She correctly assumes he and Ridge are still arguing. Rick says his mom doesn't belong with Ridge, and wonders whatever happened with Brooke and Nick, and Bridget guiltily looks away, and tells Rick their mom loves Ridge. Suddenly, Brooke shows up to chat with Rick while Bridget goes to work at the hospital. Brooke tells Rick the relationship must stop. Phoebe calls Rick's cell phone to apologize for her dad, and Rick says not to worry, but he can't talk, and will call her later. Brooke continues, telling her son that he is driving a wedge into the family, and she won't allow that to happen. She wails that she and Ridge are so close to being together and raising RJ together. She orders Rick to stop the relationship with Phoebe for the sake of the family.\n\n\n",

Nick thinks that the right woman for him to have one with is out there. Brooke is angered when she hears Ridge referring to Rick as a loser. Ridge convinces Brooke that any closeness between Rick and Phoebe could be devastating for their family if the press caught wind of it. He pushes her to talk to Rick.

Phoebe is angry and goes to her room when Brooke (who was outside, off camera talking to Rick) tells her that Rick has left.  Ridge tells Brooke that Rick has kissed Phoebe and they continue to argue over the relationship, but Brooke agrees to try and talk Rick into backing off for the sake of the family.  Rick arrives at Bridget\u2019s and asks to stay the night telling her that Ridge kicked him out.  Bridget leaves for the hospital when Brooke arrives to talk to Rick.

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge is aghast that Phoebe thinks after one kiss that she is in love with Rick. He reminds her they are both Forrester's though she keeps repeating that they aren't blood related. He can understand why she would be intrigued, but assures her it is only a game to Rick. She declares he can fire her and try to keep her away from Rick, but it won't work. They will continue to see each other. Brooke takes offense that Ridge would call her son a loser. She's surprised when he tells her that Phoebe is in love with Rick. So he can't blame this all on Rick, she has feelings too. He states that Rick led her on and she is way in over her head. Brooke thinks it won't matter as Rick probably will end up going back to Europe. He hopes so as this sort of publicity would be disastrous. He needs her help in convincing Rick, she agrees. Nick and Taylor agree they have had significant relationships in the past and they are both ready for something new, exciting. They discuss parenthood and she assures him that he's a pretty good catch. He just needs to find the right woman. Rick explains to Bridget that Ridge kicked him out and he needs a place to crash. Brooke shows up as well to talk to him and asserts that whatever is going on between him and Phoebe, it has to stop now. If he doesn't call things off, it will drive a wedge into the family. And she and Ridge are so close to getting what they have always wanted. She pleads with him to break things off; the future of the family depends on it.",
