    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Jarrett continued to wonder why Bill was so insistent that he attend the Spectra preview and give it a bad review. Bill wanted Spectra buried because he wanted the building. He planned to tear it down and build his dream building. Bill wondered why Jarrett hadn't left yet. \"Do your job,\" he commanded. Jarrett left, and Katie entered.\n\n\nKatie wondered why Jarrett had appeared so unhappy, and Bill explained that Jarrett had work to do -- covering the new Spectra preview, but Jarrett liked the events with caviar. Katie suggested that Jarrett should head over to Forrester to get a reaction statement from Steffy -- and use an angle that played off what two young women in fashion had to say about one another. Bill didn't want to give Spectra any more publicity than necessary, but Katie said they might succeed. Bill bet against it.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley and Sally celebrated the preview day with Saul and Darlita. Sally said that Shifty the loan shark would be off their backs, but the six-month clock, which C.J. had given them to become profitable and maintain the space, was ticking. She said they would sink or swim based on Jarrett's review.\n\n\nSally predicted they would be back in business. Darlita blew up balloons to decorate the room. Shirley wondered why they didn't have the preview in the showroom, and Sally and Saul reminded her they had no lights or music.\n\n\nSally said they would keep it simple and direct in the office. \"Let the designs speak for themselves,\" she said. She wanted to make their mark on the fashion world. Two models prepared for the show.\n\n\nJarrett showed up, and Darlita greeted him but had no idea who he was. Sally stepped in and took over. She promised Jarrett it would be a show to remember. Sally introduced everyone, and Jarrett was taken with how much her grandmother looked like the original Sally Spectra. Shirley was thrilled with the compliment. \"This is for your eyes only, up close and personal,\" Sally said of the preview.\n\n\nA model wearing a red gown with a big bow strutted through the office. Another model wore an attractive green gown while Sally, Shirley, and Darlita danced to the music. Jarrett was impressed and entertained. He nodded his approval.\n\n\nSally announced the showstopper, and the model wore a striking yellow gown with a fan. Jarrett looked impressed, and he clapped. \"Put that in your review,\" Sally said. She wondered if he would give them a favorable review, and Jarrett tried not to say too much. Jarrett suggested that they overestimated his influence. He left, and Sally turned to her team and congratulated them.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy entered her office and found Thomas. He had been changing his clothes, and he said that he needed a place to change because Charlie had taken over the changing space.\n\n\nThomas made a comment about Steffy's posh office, and they started arguing. Steffy said she had liked his designs, but Thomas interrupted and said she had zero design experience. Steffy promised to take another look, but Thomas told her to \"consider them shelved.\"\n\n\nLater, Steffy said it was a big day for Thomas' favorite redhead, since it was her fashion preview day. She guessed no one would attend the Spectra preview, and she was \"sure it will be another hot mess.\"\n\n\nThomas assumed Steffy was convinced Spectra would fail, but Thomas wasn't so sure. Steffy claimed Spectra had nothing going for it. Thomas disagreed and said Sally's great-aunt had created a business. Thomas said Sally's current designs weren't bad. Steffy maintained there was no talent at Spectra, but Thomas said Sally had talent and was a lot more fun than Forrester.\n\n\nSteffy called Spectra \"thieves. \"This Sally is not that Sally,\" Thomas said. Steffy said Sally was trying to take over where her great-aunt had left off. Thomas noted it would be fun to watch.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally and Shirley lamented that they hadn't bought Champagne. They celebrated that Jarrett Maxwell had liked their designs, and the building would soon be humming with life.\n\n\nSally's phone rang, and it was Thomas. He asked how her preview had gone, and she said it couldn't have gone better. He congratulated her, and she thanked him for calling. She wondered if his sister would be angry if she knew that he had called her. Sally hung up and told her team that the headline the next day would be \"Spectra Fashions back in business.\"\n\n\nJarrett returned to Spencer and told Bill that the preview had taken place in Sally's office, not on a stage. He defended the decision and said it had been an exclusive preview, and it made sense. He said it hadn't been bad. Bill said Jarrett was a kinder man than Bill would have been.\n\n\nBill reminded Jarrett what his assignment was. \"Much to my surprise, the designs were somehow not painful,\" Jarrett said. He wanted to do a fair and honest review.\n\n\nBill said Jarrett could not be fair and honest and needed to remember who he worked for. Bill lamented that C.J. had reneged on his deal in order to give his cousin a chance to play fashion designer. \"I'm not having it. You know what your assignment is -- a career-ending review,\" he said. He demanded that Jarrett's review had to be on his desk the next day. He wanted Spectra out of business.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Bill informs a reluctant Jarrett that he must tear up Spectra Fashions' preview in order to dig their comeback into the ground. He still wants to buy the company's property to build the envisioned Spencer skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles. Katie then stops by for a short visit. Knowing how her relationship with Thomas has become strained, Steffy assures her brother that being his sister is more important to her than being his boss. As the discussion shifts to Spectra, Steffy is amused that Thomas thinks that they could have genuine shot to make it in the business. Excited by the media's attendance to their debut, the Spectra gang pulls out all the stops - on a non-existent budget - to impress their guest. Sally introduces her team and presents Jarrett with a couple of her designs in her office. Thrilled that Jarrett seems impressed, Sally already calls their showing a major success. Back at Spencer Publications, Jarrett tries to explain to Bill that Sally's designs were unusual, but actually fresh and exciting. Bill reminds his star reporter that it does not matter; the assignment for the review is to put Spectra Fashions out of business.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sally and Shirley hug; it's the big day and they can't wait. It's sink or swim based on one man's review, says Shirley. Sally adds they can surely impress him and then they are back in business. There is too much stored in the show room so they will have to have the showing right here in Sally's office, simple and direct. Even the Forrester's will take notice, especially Queen Steffy. Bill thinks Jarrett is complaining when he mentions he is the only one reviewing Spectra's showing. He always wanted an exclusive. Jarrett says yes, if it were Forrester. Bill says Spectra needs to be buried. They are squatters wasting their time in that building and he cannot wait to tear it down. First they must tear them down; so squash the Spectra dreams. Steffy can tell Thomas is still miffed at her. She says being CEO is important to her but his being her brother is more important. She changes the subject quickly and says it is another day for his favorite redhead, and she is sure it will be another hot mess. Thomas tries to defend Sally but Steffy says she cannot re-create the great memories that her aunt did years ago. Thomas says he has seen them and they aren't bad. And if they are great it might be good for a healthy competition. Steffy laments they have plenty of competition from real fashion houses and not thieves which is all they will ever be. She is just taking over where her aunt left off. Bill emphasizes again that he wants that land and wants his new building, the ragtags will have to go. Bill says Jarrett is just standing around, go and do his job. Katie tells Bill that this new version of Spectra just might succeed. He says it could, but he is willing to bet it won't. Just when they all think he is going to be a no-show Jarrett steps into Spectra. Darlita does not recognize him and offers him a pig in a blanket which he declines. Sally comes in and introduces herself and puts her arm through his and introduces him to Saul and Shirley. She asks Darlita to turn on the music while she presents the maiden voyage of the new Spectra Fashions. All eyes are on Jarrett as he views the gorgeous gowns. Then Sally taunts him to feast his eyes on this \u0096 the showstopper. He claps while trying hard not to show his enthusiasm. He assures her that her sense of style is unique in a good way. They encourage him to give a good review. He says they might be giving him too much credit for his review. He thanks them for inviting him. Back at Bill's, it is awkward, he even wants a drink. Bill says he is glad he survived it. Jarrett mutters that it really wasn't all that terrible. And about the review, he can definitely write some negative things but surprisingly her designs were not that painful; they were interesting. Bill says no, that is not fair. He better not forget who he works for. He's not having any of this; Jarrett knows what his assignment is \u0096 write a scathing career-ending review. Over at Spectra they are all jumping around celebrating and wishing they had some champagne with all of this. Thomas calls and Sally says it was quite an experience and Jarrett Maxwell was there. Thomas says he is quite influential. Bill tells Jarrett that he wants the review on his desk the first thing in the morning \u0096 they are putting Spectra out of business.",
