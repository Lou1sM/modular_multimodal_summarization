He tries to explain to her that Felicia had met someone and spent the night with him, just one night -- it happened after they had broken off and Felicia had left.  Bridget comments that Felicia asked her to accept the child, who was then your child, and she wants to do that.  She also wants to know if they are going to try to take the baby away from them.  Bridget tells Nick that Felicia wanted them to be Dominick's parents.  Nick tells her that Dante is the Father.  \"Now,\" says Bridget, \"that explains why you were acting like you were.\"  She tells him that he has lost a son also.  She understands now, what Dante had said earlier.  Bridget starts to fantasize that Dante wasn't going to take away the baby.  He cares for me.  The baby starts to cry and Nick heads for the other room to tend to him.  In the meantime, Bridget heads over to Dante's place.  Nick comes out of the room with the baby, but Bridget has all ready left.  He sits and asks Dominick what in the world they are going to do now.  Bridget arrives at Dante's place.  He has brought in all the usual items that a baby is going to need.  Bridget tells Dante that for as long as she can remember, he was always there to look out after her.  He tells her that he has always wanted what is best for her.  She is happy to hear that as she believes that Dante wants her and Nick to raise the child.  Dante stops her short by saying that's not what he meant; he meant that he wants the baby there with him.  He tells her that he wants her there with him and he wants them to raise Dominick together.  \n\n\nBrooke goes home and enters her place, not knowing that Stephanie is waiting for her.  Stephanie and Brooke talk for a few minutes until Stephanie and Brooke both realize that each of them knows about the new situation that has come up.  Stephanie tells her that she just came from Dante's.  She asks Brooke what she thinks about Bridget and Dante raising Dominick, then she could have Nick to herself.  Brooke tells her that she had all ready made it clear that she was not going to come between Nick and Bridget.  Stephanie tells her that the real deal is, that the children kept Nick and Bridget together and now that is no longer a problem.  She tells Brooke that any happiness that Nick and Bridget have had, has always been on borrowed time.  However, this might just work.  Brooke tells her that she just wants to see her with Nick now, because it will keep her from becoming involved with Ridge again.  Stephanie surprises her by saying that she doesn't think that will happen now or it all ready would have -- and besides Brooke had claimed that Nick was her true love.
