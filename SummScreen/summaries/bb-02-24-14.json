She grabbed his sword charm, and he realized that she liked drawing blood. Quinn replied that she loved every painful moment of it, and before ravaging her again, Bill said she was more disturbed that he'd remembered. He put the tiny blade against her throat, and she huffed in ecstasy.\n\n\nDownstairs, Liam groaned as he listened to the noises from upstairs. Hope arrived at the house, and Liam asked why she wasn't at the reception. Hope explained that Katie had passed out during the ceremony, and Brooke was with Katie at the hospital. Hope had decided to tell Liam about it in case he had to handle something for Katie at work.\n\n\nHope heard crashing noises and Bill's moaning. Liam quickly said that Bill wasn't feeling well. Hope asked if they should tell Bill about Katie or at least check on him; however, Liam awkwardly responded that Bill would be just fine, and they shouldn't disturb him.\n\n\nLiam switched the topic back to the wedding, and Hope explained that Carter had recited a beautiful passage before Katie had fallen down. Though no one knew whether it had been a heart attack, Hope said that Katie had been alert again rather quickly and had insisted that she hadn't needed help. Liam guessed it had been too stressful for Katie, and Hope asked why he'd say that.\n\n\nLiam decided that he had something to tell Hope. He stammered but finally said that Katie and Ridge had feelings for each other. Hope gasped, saying it was ridiculous, but Liam explained that Ridge and Katie had bonded over the Brooke and Bill incident and over poetry. Liam cited that Ridge had returned from Paris a totally different man and had been blindsided by what Brooke had done to Katie.\n\n\nLiam felt that Katie would be upset with him for telling Hope, but he couldn't keep the secret if Katie's health was involved. Hope stated that Ridge had gone to the hospital, too, and she suddenly realized that the news about Katie and Ridge could be \"coming out\" at that very moment.\n\n\nHope asked more about the poetry bonding and recalled that Carter had read a poem when Katie had gone down. Gathering her thoughts, Hope decided that she couldn't fault Katie and Ridge because circumstances had drawn them together; however, Hope didn't want to see her mother hurt. Hope gave Liam a hug and a kiss and thanked him for telling her. Grabbing her purse, she took off for the hospital to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\nBack upstairs, Quinn and Bill lay on the floor, exhausted from their activities. She claimed that it had been just as she'd remembered, and it was no wonder that Brooke had left him. Bill quipped that Quinn had been alone all those years because no man could put up with her. He claimed to be glad that he'd been drinking when he'd dated her.\n\n\nQuinn advised Bill to go wipe off the blood, but Bill said it had just been a scratch. He suggested that she get a bandage, and she laughed, noting that she'd hardly been hurt by the tiny dagger's sting on her neck.  The two got dressed, and Quinn said, \"If you find my underwear -- \"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'll burn it,\" Bill quipped. Quinn decided that she should go, and she told him to enjoy his hangover. Bill seemed to be glad to get rid of her, but he leaned in when she kissed him before exiting.\n\n\nBill went downstairs, and shirtless, he fumed on the sofa. Liam entered and asked if they were alone. He stated that Hope had been there, Brooke's wedding hadn't happened because Katie had passed out. Liam said that Katie was okay, but Ridge and Brooke weren't married.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Katie told Ridge that she was sorry, but he replied that he wasn't. Katie insisted that it wasn't in her nature to do what she'd done at the wedding.\n\n\nBrooke entered from the corridor, and Katie apologized for ruining the wedding. Brooke didn't believe that Katie had ruined it, but Brooke was glad that they'd gotten Katie to the hospital. Katie insisted that she was fine, but Brooke preferred to hold out for the doctor's assessment. Katie murmured that it might not be medical, and she could have been feeling something.\n\n\nBrooke urged Katie to describe her feelings to her doctor so that they could get to the bottom of it. \"There aren't words,\" Katie responded.\n\n\nAs Brooke persisted in questioning Katie about how she'd felt at the wedding, Hope arrived, full of concern for what had happened to Katie. Hope asked if Katie had been taking her medication, and Katie insisted that she had. Brooke stated that the medications weren't the problem, but she decided to find the doctor to see if she could get more information.\n\n\nAfter Brooke had gone, Hope asked if Katie could go home that day. Katie figured that she would, because there was nothing wrong with her. Surprised, Hope responded that Katie had fainted at Brooke's wedding, so Katie couldn't say that something wasn't seriously wrong. Katie insisted that she was okay, and knowingly, Hope replied that Katie was just fine.\n\n\nHope noted that stress had caused Katie to fall to the floor. Hope declared that nothing was wrong with Katie, but she'd stopped the wedding because she hadn't wanted Brooke to marry Ridge. Katie admitted that she'd stopped the wedding, and Hope stated that it was because Katie loved Ridge. Katie admitted that she did. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke keeps following Dr. Patrick around to find out what happened to Katie. He says he will know when he sees the blood test results. Katie tells Ridge that she is sorry it came to this. He says he is not. Bill and Quinn continue to have their freaky romp in his bedroom. She punctures him with his sword necklace and he takes it and runs it over her neck. Liam closes his eyes and comes downstairs looking like a rag doll. He opens the door to find Hope there. Distracted, but he lets her in where she slowly fills him in that she's not at the wedding as it was cancelled when Katie fainted. She keeps hearing noises upstairs along with moans and groans and is worried about Bill. Liam covers by saying his dad is not feeling well and he will check on him later. He doesn't want to disturb him now. Then he confesses that Katie and Ridge have deep feelings for each other and that is why she collapsed. He can't keep this to himself when it's her health on the line. Hope is devastated but says she can not fault Ridge or Katie. People can not help how they feel when they are together; she gets that. But she says she does not want to see her mom get hurt again. If Ridge has feelings for Katie she can not let him marry her mom. She gives Liam a hug and thanks him for telling her. She has to go find out if this is true by talking to Ridge and Katie. Quinn give Bill one last kiss and tells him to enjoy his hangover. Liam finds Bill and asks if they are alone and is he okay. Bill says more or less. Liam fills him in that there was no wedding. Brooke and Ridge are not married. Hope finds Katie and Ridge together at the hospital and questions her about fainting at the wedding. When Katie says she is fine, Hope tells her this is not about her health. She knows about the two of them and what is going on. She knows Katie is fine. She made that decision to stop the wedding so Ridge would not marry her mom. Katie finally admits yes, she stopped the wedding because she loves Ridge.",
