Ridge wondered how many performances Rick had prepared for their dad. Rick maintained that he had backed up all his promises with profits. Ridge argued that the numbers were up because of Ridge and Caroline's designs.\n\n\nRick scoffed. His phone rang, and it was Maya. She asked when he would return home. Rick promised to be there soon. Ridge overheard the conversation and wondered if Rick had slept well knowing that Eric had moved into the guesthouse.\n\n\nRick replied that Eric had made that choice, and Rick proudly claimed that he and Maya didn't do a lot of sleeping in Eric's bedroom. Ridge said he couldn't wait until the day he could knock Maya and Rick off their perch. Ridge left, and Rick shook his head.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Ivy confronted Steffy. Ivy advised that Steffy was not welcome at Liam's house. Steffy scoffed that Ivy had no idea what Steffy and Liam had shared. \"You don't know our history,\" she said.\n\n\nSteffy explained that she and Liam had been together for years. Steffy maintained that they had been lovers, had been married, and had lost a child together. Ivy recalled that Liam and Steffy had had a connection, but it was in the past. Ivy also reminded Steffy that Ivy had stood up for Steffy in the past when people had trash-talked her lingerie line. \"I defended you,\" Ivy said. Steffy nodded.\n\n\nIvy warned Steffy to back off. Steffy continued to defend her romance with Liam, and Steffy was convinced it would happen again. She reminded Ivy that she and Liam had been apart before but always find their way back to one another.\n\n\nIvy disagreed. \"You're a memory -- a part of his past,\" Ivy said. Ivy added that Steffy had left Liam after she'd lost their baby. Ivy sympathized, but she noted that Steffy had left, and there were consequences for that. \"I am the consequence,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nSteffy said she didn't want to argue with Ivy. Steffy had spent years in love with Liam, while Ivy had been with Liam for only a few months. Steffy recalled that she and Liam had struggled through breakups, interferences, and more. Then, Steffy emotionally shared that she had ridden her motorcycle when she shouldn't have, \"and I lost our baby,\" she said.\n\n\nSteffy admitted that she'd been racked with guilt and had needed to get away, but she had returned. \"I've been down this path, and you're merely a bump in the road. Nothing more,\" Steffy said. Ivy didn't back down. \"Remember, I'm a Forrester, too, and I will fight for what's mine. Learn to respect that, or you're gonna regret that,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nAt Rick and Maya's, Maya welcomed Rick home. \"I'm so proud of you,\" Maya said. Rick credited his dad, who had pulled through for him when he'd needed him most. Rick added that Ridge had confronted him about his position as CEO. Rick worried that there was a battle brewing at Forrester.\n\n\n\"Forget about Ridge. You're a leader. No one can touch you, Rick. It's your time,\" Maya crowed. \"It's our time,\" Rick answered. He wanted to celebrate, but he wanted to change first. Maya promised to get the Champagne. Rick went upstairs.\n\n\nMaya heard the doorbell, and her sister Nicole entered. \"Hey, big sister,\" Nicole said. Maya looked uncomfortable. Nicole admired the painting of Maya on the wall and asked to meet her future husband. \"Rick and I have plans. Let's make a date and do lunch,\" Maya said.\n\n\nNicole said that Maya was \"so Hollywood.\" \"Let's grab a bite,\" she said. Nicole added that she'd lost her apartment at UCLA and needed a place to stay. \"How about a room at Hotel Forrester,\" Nicole asked.\n\n\nRick entered, and Maya introduced Nicole, who said she was a student at UCLA. Rick complimented her on her achievements at school. Nicole shared that she needed a place to stay because she had to get away from her roommate, and she couldn't sleep in the library all the time. Rick told her she could crash at the house anytime, but Maya said that Nicole was fine.\n\n\nNicole was in shock. Maya hustled her off to the door and promised to call her. Nicole looked sick.\n\n\nRick wondered why Maya didn't want Nicole to stay, and Maya said she wanted some alone time with Rick. \"We're just getting started,\" Maya said. She added that they already had Ivy and Aly hanging around the house all the time. Rick said a full-time student at UCLA would hardly be hanging around.\n\n\nMaya changed the subject to celebration, and they toasted with Champagne. Maya reminded Rick that his father loved him as the number one son. \"I'm gonna prove to him that I'm the best CEO,\" Rick said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam visited Ridge and said he had talked to Steffy. \"Don't drag me into that drama,\" Ridge said. Liam confessed that he was committed to Ivy.\n\n\nLiam confided in Ridge that he was worried that Forrester would soon implode. Ridge wondered why it would bother Liam. Liam said that Rick had treated Ivy and Caroline like slaves.\n\n\nRidge agreed. Liam confessed that he hadn't liked the idea of Ridge and Caroline at first, but he'd changed his mind. He didn't want Caroline to ever be near Rick again. Ridge said he loved Caroline and missed her when he was away from her for any length of time. Liam said he had a plan to take Rick down.\n\n\nRidge was mildly interested. Liam proposed that combining the shares of Steffy, Ridge, Thomas, and Bill could give them leverage for a hostile takeover. Ridge refused to partner with Bill. \"I would be in control of his shares,\" Liam said.\n\n\nRidge was unconvinced. \"I don't trust your father,\" Ridge said. Liam said that if he controlled the shares, he would not be doing his father's bidding, and he would be a silent partner at Forrester.\n\n\nLiam worried that if they didn't stop Rick soon, everyone would leave, and Forrester would no longer be a family-owned company. Ridge agreed, but he noted that going against Rick meant he would have to betray his father. Liam sympathized, but he said they had to move fast. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "When Ivy issues her a stern warning about the blatant move that she made on Liam, Steffy refuses to back down. Ridge is torn between his disdain for Rick and his loyalty to Eric when Liam approaches him about joining on in the plan for the Spencers acquiring Forrester Creations. Nicole makes an unannounced and unwelcomed visit to Maya at the Forrester mansion looking for a place to live.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Rick that he doesn't know how, but he's going to take him down. He can't see how Rick sleeps at night with his dad shoved out in the guest house. The day will come when he and Maya are toppled off that perch they are on. Ivy tells Steffy the time has passed and she and Liam do not relate at all any more. It is now Ivy and Liam. Steffy reminds her they have a history and she will be Liam's lover if she agrees to take over FC. She tells Ivy that she saw nothing but her in a bikini because they are in Los Angeles by the beach. And her and Liam's relationship is just another bump in the road. Rick tells Maya that the fight has just begun with Ridge. Maya says it is a losing battle. She comments that Liam threw out the olive branch and Ridge stomped on it. It is their time now. He's going upstairs to change and then wants to celebrate. Suddenly Nicole shows up at the door. Nicole tells Maya that she has done well. She would like to apologize for being sort of rude last time. She relays that she has lost her apartment and wonders if Maya has an extra little room here at Hotel Forrester. Maya tells her that she will give her a call but she and Rick have plans tonight. Rick comes down and meets Nicole and is civil to her, even offering her to stay there, but Maya ushers her out and says she will call later. Liam waits for Ridge and says he is going to be blunt. He had issues with Ridge and Caroline at first but he has changed his mind now that Rick is treating Ivy so badly. He has a plan that he'd like to run past Ridge. He explains the shares they could get together and have a hostile takeover. Ridge says an immediate no; he would never partner with Liam's father. Steffy tells Ivy her few months vs Steffy's many years with Liam is huge. She tells her she lost their baby and she was racked by guilt and she ran off. Maybe Liam's heart is in a different place now but until she sees something more permanent with Liam and Ivy then all bets are off. Liam says Ridge may know his dad but Ridge doesn't know Liam that well. He does know Ridge can not work with Rick and the profits are up only because of Ridge and Caroline. FC looks good cosmetically but on the inside it is a disaster. They have to do something to stop this. Ridge still says he can not go against his own father. Steffy tells Ivy that she is Hope .02. Ivy says they have slept together and that means something to her. Steffy says this is L.A. and her town so Ivy can be the one to move on. Maya explains to Rick that things are really perfect right now and she doesn't want Nicole to come between them. He wants the celebration to continue. Maya agrees. Rick is now the #1 son and they drink to no one taking them under. Liam tells Ridge they are not betraying his father but protecting his legacy. He won't stand by and see everyone be Rick's slaves and he doesn't think Ridge will either. Ridge muses that he is tired of seeing Caroline suffer because of Rick. Liam says they can change it but right now that is the future of FC and everyone will bail out and go elsewhere leaving Eric no company at all. But if they move to save it they need to do it now.",
