Hope chastised Ridge because Brooke had been trying to prove that she was good enough for him. Hope was surprised that Katie had been secretly in love with Ridge. Hope agreed that Katie had had good intentions in stopping the wedding due to their feelings for one another, and Hope warned that Ridge could never marry Brooke if he had feelings for Katie.\n\n\nOutside Katie's room, Brooke talked to the doctor in the hallway. The doctor told Brooke that he had received the test results and would disclose them to Katie. Brooke and the doctor entered Katie's room, and the doctor told Katie that she had not had a heart attack. He said that her cardiac function was fine, and he promised to discharge her as long as she had an adult to stay with her for at least 24 hours. The doctor left.\n\n\nKatie apologized to Brooke for all the trouble. Brooke said that she and Ridge would get married after Katie had been supervised for 24 hours. Katie asked Hope to stay with her, but Hope had to go to Paris. Brooke offered to stay with Katie, but Hope said that she needed Brooke to go to France with her.\n\n\nHope insisted that Ridge could stay with Katie. Ridge offered to accompany Hope, but Hope refused. Hope added that Brooke had to go to Paris because Hope needed reinforcements. Hope persuaded her mother to leave and pack. Brooke agreed, and she kissed Ridge. Brooke cooed that it was supposed to be their wedding night.  Ridge promised to see Brooke when she returned. Brooke left.\n\n\nHope, Ridge, and Katie discussed what to do next. \"Work this out -- figure out what you are doing, and now you have time to do that,\" Hope advised.  Hope warned that she didn't want Ridge and Katie to hurt Brooke. Hope called their relationship an affair, but Ridge and Katie argued that nothing had happened. They had crossed no lines. \n\n\nHope marveled that Ridge would have married Brooke even though he had feelings for Katie. Hope added that if Brooke had known about it, she would think it was an affair no matter what had happened. Ridge said that he had planned to make Brooke happy and that Katie had planned to support it. Hope asked if a little piece of Katie would have died inside to watch Brooke and Ridge marry, and Katie agreed it would have hurt her to let Ridge go.\n\n\nRidge said that he had never meant to mislead Brooke. His vows hadn't been just words, he said. Hope said that she admired Ridge and Katie, but they had to figure out what they wanted. Hope warned that she and Brooke would be gone for only a few days. Hope left.\n\n\nRidge told Katie they had to be careful. Katie shook her head. \"You know how I feel,\" she said. \"I knew before,\" Ridge said. A couple of days alone with Ridge seemed dangerous to Katie. Ridge sat down next to Katie and put his arm around her. He asked what Katie feared. \"Myself,\" she answered.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Liam and Bill talked about how Katie's collapse might have been fate or something else. Bill wondered if Katie had done it for Bill. Liam scoffed that Katie wouldn't do that. Liam added that Bill didn't believe in fate. Bill believed he had a second chance with Brooke.\n\n\nLiam called the hospital to check on Katie, and he told Bill that Katie had been discharged. Bill said that Ridge had always cast Brooke in the role of the woman who had never been worthy of Ridge. Bill felt he had to see Brooke. Since he had been drinking, Bill decided he needed coffee and a shower before he visited Brooke. Liam didn't think it was Bill's best idea. \n\n\nBill lamented that he had lost everything -- his company, his wife, his child, and the woman he had wanted to marry. Bill decided he would seize the moment to be with Brooke. He left to take a shower.\n\n\nWhen Bill returned, he was wearing a suit -- he noted that it was the same suit he had worn in a magazine interview about the power behind the Spencer name. Bill reminded Liam that the Spencer men had to stand up for themselves. Bill advised that Hope was still interested in Liam because she had visited Liam to tell him about Brooke and Ridge's wedding. Liam disagreed. Bill warned that Liam needed to forget the old history he had with Hope by making new history.\n\n\nLiam disagreed. He felt there had been too much history, and he had put himself into a meat grinder too many times. Liam reminded Bill that Brooke would be committed to Ridge -- just as she had been before Katie's collapse had stopped the wedding. Bill said he didn't care about Ridge. He cared about Brooke. Bill left.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, the doorbell rang, and Brooke greeted Bill, who said he had heard about the failed wedding. \"I'd be lying if I said I'm sorry,\" Bill confessed. He asked about Katie. Brooke said Katie was fine. Bill promised to love Brooke the way she deserved to be loved. Brooke asked if he had been drinking.\n\n\nBill asked to take Brooke to dinner. Bill asked her to let him love her for the rest of her life. Brooke said their love had been poisoned, but Brooke cooed that Bill was special to her. \"There's no one like you,\" she said. Bill wanted to kiss Brooke and take her upstairs, but Brooke refused.\n\n\n\"He doesn't love you the way I do,\" Bill said about Ridge.\n\n\n\"I don't want him to,\" Brooke answered. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope tells Ridge and Katie that she is disillusioned right now. Ever since Ridge came back, her mom has been beating herself up trying to prove that she is good enough for him. And now she finds they are involved with each other. So at least she agrees they are right to stop the wedding. She tells Ridge hat he can not marry her mom if he has feelings for Brooke's sister. Ridge says it looks like she is saying they are guilty of something so what is it. Hope says they are having an emotional entanglement. Ridge says they have done nothing wrong. Hope says that does not make it right though. Dr. Patrick and Brooke join them and he says conclusively they have re-run some tests and Katie did not have a heart attack. Everything looks healthy. He will discharge her but to be safe only if she has an adult who can be with her and look after her for the next 24 hours. Katie suggests Hope can stay with her. She agrees until she remembers she has to go to Paris tonight for a showing and she really wanted Brooke also to go along. She suggests perhaps Ridge can look after Katie. Brooke gives Ridge a kiss and glad he is understanding about this. Alone, Katie asks Hope what is she thinking. Hope says they need to think over what they are doing and now this will give them the opportunity to do that. Katie keeps saying there is no affair. Hope says okay, love without the affair but do you think Brooke will hear if differently. Ridge says it was figured out. He was supposed to be married right now. He can not control how someone makes him feel, but he was gonna marry her mother and make her happy and Katie was going to support that. Katie agrees yes although a little piece of her would have died inside. Bill wants to go see Brooke. Liam smells his breath and says he might want to re-think that. Bill says he thinks Katie might have done this for him so that he will have a second chance with Brooke. Forrester is through with Brooke. He has cast her as the woman who is not good enough for him. So Bill thinks he needs a shower and lots and lots of coffee. Carpe diem \u0096 seize the day. That's what he is going to do right now. And he wants Liam to remember ..right now is all he has. He reminds him that Hope is still around even though she is with Wyatt. She could have phoned Liam with her news but she came in person. But you can get rid of old history by making new history. Liam says he is not like his dad. He can not keep putting himself through the meat grinder and coming out in pieces. Bill says he can not predict what Brooke will do but he only knows what he can do. At home packing, Brooke is surprised to see Bill at her door. He tells her he is not sorry the wedding is off and perhaps this is a sign. She should not be marrying Ridge. She tells him that the two of them have been many things but meant to be isn't one of them. There's been too much damage. He wants to take her to dinner. She says she can't. He wants to love her for the rest of her life. She says that would have been nice. She would have wanted that more than anything but it has been poisoned. Hope says she does not know what else to do with this information. Katie assures her that nothing has happened. And their behaviors wouldn't have been any different if her feelings didn't exist. Hope says the timing was horrendous but she doesn't think she was wrong for stopping the wedding. They can't continue down this path and pretend it's not going to hurt somebody. Ridge says she is right. They do need to take a look at this as it has all changed since this morning. Katie laments that she feels like such a hypocrite. It's dangerous and the thing she fears most is herself.",
