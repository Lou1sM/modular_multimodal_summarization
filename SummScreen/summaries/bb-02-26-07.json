However, Ridge maintained that there was nothing to worry about, since Brooke had convinced Rick to call things off. Taylor remained skeptical, arguing that Phoebe might go after Rick and try to win him back. Taylor tried to get Ridge to look at it from Phoebe's perspective as a young woman experiencing her first time of real heartbreak.\n\n\nRidge believed Taylor might be too distracted with Nick to keep an eye on their daughter. Taylor assured him she was capable of taking care of Phoebe and herself. Ridge pried into Taylor's love life, worrying that Nick was just a rebound to help her forget about the pain of losing Thorne. Taylor assured Ridge that Nick was not a rebound for her, and she added that she finally understood what Brooke had seen in him.\n\n\nAt Jackie M's, Brooke stopped by, and Nick jokingly asked if she was lost. Brooke told him that she was on her way to check out the site for Forrester's new store. Nick was impressed with the location and wondered how much the Forresters had had to borrow to secure it. Brooke admitted that she hadn't gone there to discuss business; instead she wanted to know what the holdup was on the divorce papers. Nick thought she was just using that as an excuse so she could stop by and find out about his relationship with Taylor. Brooke denied it, telling Nick she was far too busy trying to keep her life on track with Ridge to worry about him.\n\n\nNick told Brooke he knew about the Rick/Phoebe situation and that it was wrong for Ridge to make her go against her son. Brooke told him she'd had to put a stop to Rick and Phoebe's relationship after she'd found out that they had kissed. Giving Brooke a lusty look, Nick told her the attraction between Phoebe and Rick would be there whether they were together or not. He argued that Ridge had no right to stop it, but Brooke caught him in his hypocrisy when she asked him how he would feel if it were Hope in the same situation. Seeing that her question struck a nerve, Brooke apologized and hurriedly said goodbye.\n\n\nAt the new building site, Stephanie commended Eric for finding such a prime location on Rodeo Drive for their first store. Eric worried that he might have gotten in over his head, but he was glad it would be easy to sell the building if his store didn't succeed. Stephanie scolded her husband for having such a negative attitude and reminded him that it had been his idea in the first place. Stephanie advised Eric to stop second-guessing himself. She stressed to her husband that he had to be confident, strong, and determined, or the whole thing would come tumbling down on them -- and the press would eat them alive.\n\n\nWhen Brooke and Ridge arrived, Stephanie told them of Eric's sudden apprehension. Ridge suggested that if he and Brooke had their wedding at the store's grand opening, it would be a huge success. Eric and Stephanie were excited by Ridge's idea; however, Brooke wasn't thrilled about her wedding being a publicity stunt. Stephanie didn't think Brooke had ever had a qualm about making a spectacle of herself before. Ridge managed to sell Brooke on it after he promised her a private ceremony later. Excited with his victory, Ridge pulled Brooke into a passionate kiss and told her nothing could keep them from being husband and wife.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Forrester Originals, Phoebe daydreamed of her sexy kiss with Rick in the rain. As her photoshoot began, the photographer unsuccessfully tried to get Phoebe to sparkle. As soon as Rick walked in, Phoebe lit up. Rick admired Phoebe as she continued to pose. When the photoshoot ended, they sneaked back into a dressing room and kissed.\n\n\nRick told Phoebe he didn't like sneaking around but admitted that he wanted to be with her. Phoebe promised they wouldn't have to sneak once Ridge and Brooke were married. As things continued to get hot and heavy, Rick tried to put a brake on it. Hungry for more kisses, Phoebe insisted that they weren't doing anything dangerous.\n\n\n",
