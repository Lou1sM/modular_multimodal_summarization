    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Katie's, Ridge and Katie discussed their time alone. Katie said that Will was with his nanny at a play date so they were alone. Ridge said that the doctor had been mystified about what made Katie collapse. Katie wondered how Hope figured everything out. Ridge explained that Hope was protecting Brooke. \n\n\nRidge recalled that when he had first proposed to Brooke, she hadn't agreed immediately because she wanted to be sure that it was forever. Ridge said that Hope wanted Ridge to figure out what he wanted. Katie noted that Ridge was free to marry Brooke, but he felt he and Katie had to figure out what had happened between them. \"It's time we're honest with each other,\" he said. \n\n\nKatie worried that she had made a mistake when she interrupted Ridge and Brooke's wedding. Katie tried to call the Forrester jet to get the pilot to wait for Ridge to go with Brooke to Paris. Ridge took her phone away. \"We can't deny this,\" he said. He added that neither one of them had expected it. \n\n\nRidge called their connection an amazing and wonderful surprise. Ridge caressed Katie's cheek with his hand, and Katie put her hand on his. Later, Ridge brought Katie something to eat. Katie chastised herself because she had feigned illness at the wedding. \"Everything I accused her of -- that's me now,\" Katie said of Brooke. Ridge disagreed. \"You fought how you felt,\" he reminded her.  Ridge said that he was glad it was just the two of them. He kissed her on the forehead. Katie smiled at Ridge, and they looked into each other's eyes. \n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt studied pieces from Stephanie Forrester's personal collection. Quinn was smiling and appeared to be distracted. Wyatt told Quinn that he had been blown away when Eric asked him to appraise the collection. Wyatt noted that Quinn had been too quiet. \n\n\n\"I had the most fascinating encounter earlier with your father,\" Quinn said. Wyatt wondered what had happened. Quinn explained that she had learned Brooke and Ridge were getting married, and she knew that Bill would be in pain because he had lost Brooke. Quinn said that she noticed Bill was in so much pain that he was vulnerable, and she found herself feeling sorry for him but enjoying his sorrow at the same time. \n\n\nWyatt said that Quinn clearly loved and hated Bill at the same time. Quinn explained that she and Bill had a new level of understanding. Wyatt told Quinn that Katie had collapsed at the wedding, and Brooke and Ridge had never officially been married. Quinn looked thoughtful. Wyatt had to leave because he had received a text from Hope. \n\n\nAt Brooke's, Bill claimed that the failed wedding between Brooke and Ridge had been an omen. Bill grabbed Brooke and tried to kiss her, but Hope entered and interrupted. Hope wondered why Bill had arrived. Bill claimed that he was there because of the aborted wedding. Bill wanted Hope to convince Brooke to give him a second chance. Hope laughed.\n\n\nHope wondered if Bill had recovered from whatever ailment he'd had. Bill looked confused, and Hope reminded him that she had been at Liam's when Bill had been upstairs making a lot of noise. It must have been a fever, Hope said. Hope explained that Liam had said that Bill wasn't feeling well. Bill confessed that he had been drinking and was not himself, but it would never happen again. Bill said he wanted to go to Paris with Brooke, but Hope refused. Bill questioned if Ridge and Brooke would ever marry. He asked Hope what she thought, but Hope ignored him. She went upstairs to pack for the trip to Paris. \n\n\nBill wondered why Brooke would leave her fianc\u00e9 on her almost wedding day to go to Paris. Bill promised to wait for Brooke, and he insisted they were not over. Brooke did not discourage him. Bill left, and Brooke looked thoughtful. \n\n\nLater, Wyatt showed up at Hope's, and Hope broke the news that she was headed to Paris with her mom. \"Invite me,\" Wyatt said. Wyatt started speaking French, and Hope laughed at his French accent. Wyatt promised nonstop romance, but Hope said it was impossible. She was spearheading a campaign, and she would be busy on Hope for the Future the entire time. She added that she had planned to spend any free time with her mom. Brooke entered and greeted Wyatt. Wyatt said he would miss Hope. They kissed passionately, and Brooke looked uncomfortable.  \n\n\nLater on the plane, Brooke confessed to Hope that she couldn't stop thinking about Ridge. Brooke said that it should have been her wedding night. She felt married to Ridge in her heart. Hope apologized for spiriting Brooke away. Brooke said she worried about Katie. Brooke knew that Katie would be feeling guilty for interrupting the wedding, but it was crazy after all that Brooke had done to Katie. Hope advised Brooke to stop beating herself up. \"Aunt Katie isn't perfect either,\" Hope said. Brooke looked at a picture of Ridge on her phone. \n\n\nHope yawned and said she needed some sleep. Brooke encouraged her to go into the cabin to take a nap on the bed. Hope opened the door to the bedroom, and she looked at the bed. Wyatt crawled out from under the covers. Hope got onto the bed with him. Wyatt said that she hadn't told him NOT to accompany her to Paris. \"I couldn't let you go to the most romantic city in the world alone,\" he said. They made out on the bed.  \n\n\nAt Liam's, Bill had returned, and Liam wondered if Bill was alone or with Quinn ... or Brooke. Bill wondered how Liam had known about Quinn. Liam teased that the entire community of Malibu knew about it. Liam wondered if Bill had a case of temporary insanity, and Bill agreed. He told Liam to pretend that it had never happened. Liam asked about Brooke, and Bill said that Brooke and Hope were on their way to Paris without Ridge. Bill claimed there had to be more to the story. Liam left, and Bill sat down and recalled his time with Brooke in Monte Carlo.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Wyatt is oblivious to the true meaning behind Quinn\u2019s confession when she tells him about her recent interaction with Bill. Wanting to rekindle their love for each other, Bill invites himself on Brooke\u2019s trip to Paris. Ridge attempts to quell Katie\u2019s overwhelming guilt about how her feelings for him may affect Brooke. Hope gets an unexpected surprise en route to France.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Katie that he doesn't know how Hope figured this out, but she and Brooke are in Paris so this gives him and Katie time to figure all of this out. Katie tells him it is not too late; he can still marry Brooke. He says and pretend none of this they are feeling isn't happening. It's time they are honest with each other. Bill asks Brooke if maybe this is an omen. She says she does not believe in omens. Hope walks in and Bill tells her that he feels like he has been given a second chance. Hope says she thinks that might be his fever talking. She was at Liam's earlier and knows he was not feeling well. He tells her he tied one on and that won't be happening again. He sees Hope's bags and asks if she is going somewhere. Brooke tells him they are going to Paris. Bill quips so important that she would leave her fiance on their almost wedding day. She reminds him they will be married when she gets back. He says okay but he will be there waiting for her. He is convinced this is not over. Wyatt handles some of the Stephanie Forrester jewelry collection and tells his mom each piece is more exquisite than the next. Eric asked him to have it appraised. Quinn is abnormally quiet and he asks her what's up. She says she just had the most fascinating encounter with his father. She knew the wedding was today and he'd be bummed so she went to see him at Liam's. Wyatt laughs and accuses his mother of sticking it to Bill. She says no, he really was hurt and vulnerable and she found herself feeling for him ..and seeing him hurt at the same time. She wonders if that sounds sadistic ..loving and hating at the same time. She confesses they have an unpredictable relationship and even more so after today. Wyatt laughs and says she still has not told him what happened. All she will say is that they took it to a whole new level of understanding. Wyatt tells her Ridge did not marry Brooke after all. Before he can say more, Hope calls and needs to see him. At Brooke's house Wyatt sees the bags and hopes that Hope is moving in with him. She tells him of the Paris trip. He also says he needs to go, it will be romance 24/7. She says unfortunately it will be HFTF 24/7. Bill walks in on Liam and he wants to be sure Bill is alone. Bill asks if he knows about Quinn. Liam says yeah, the whole city of Malibu probably does. What was that ~ temporary insanity. Bill says he was completely ripped and hell no to any suggestion that he and Quinn are together. Liam grins when his dad says don't even think it, don't say it, it never happened. Brooke convinces Hope to go lie down and refresh. She is not tired as she is thinking of Ridge and his vows earlier today. Hope gets a big surprise and gives out a yelp when she discovers Wyatt hidden under the covers and peeking out at her. She jumps on top of him and gives him several kisses. He says he was hiding in the bathroom for so long that he probably smells like vanilla or pine. But he could not let her go to the most romantic city in the world alone. Katie tells Ridge that she is not sure what Hope is expecting. Ridge says Hope is expecting the man who marries her mom to be fully committed to her. They both agree that this is not what they were expecting when he came back from Paris. He says sometimes life has an amazing, wonderful way of surprising you. She repeats again that she has turned into Brooke and everything she accused her of .that is Katie now. He says no, she fought it, so did he. But now they do have to be honest with each other. That will be hard since it will affect a lot of people, but right now maybe they can make it just the two of them. She nods. He draws her closer and kisses her on the forehead.",

Hope encouraged Brooke to go and sleep and said she needed some sleep.  Brooke looked at a picture of Ridge on her phone and said, \"Aunt Katie isn't perfect,\" and Hope laughed at the picture of Katie on the phone and encouraged her to go sleep and get some sleep, as Brooke had been up all night with a yawn.\n"
