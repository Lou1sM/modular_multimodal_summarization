Nick does not understand why she is saying this and asks her if it is because he makes her unhappy. Bridget says that is not the problem; she is just trying to face reality. Bridget tells Nick one of the reasons she went over to talk to Dante about them keeping Dominick, was to save their marriage. Nick says they have a good marriage. Bridget says Nick's heart is not in the marriage and she knows that Nick still loves her mother. Nick tells Bridget he was never unfaithful to her and that he will never be with Brooke. He tells Bridget he loves her. Bridget begs Nick to let her go, and asks him to sleep on the boat for the night. As he is leaving, Nick tells Bridget he was not with her just because of the child. Bridget tearfully tells him she will always love him. \n\n\nMeanwhile at Brooke's, just after Ridge proposes to Brooke, Stephanie tells him to put the ring away, because Brooke doesn't want him, since she has a chance with Nick again. Stephanie says Nick and Bridget's marriage will not last now that they do not have a child holding them together. She predicts he will be right back with Brooke soon. Ridge tells his mother Brooke can prove her wrong by accepting his proposal. Brooke tells Ridge before she can accept his proposal, he must agree to a few conditions. Brooke's conditions are that she will remain living in her house, that the entire family will be welcome in her house, including Nick, and that Ridge will always place her above Stephanie and that Stephanie will have no say in their lives. Ridge agrees to her conditions and Brooke accepts his proposal. As they begin to kiss passionately, Stephanie watches on in disgust. Ridge is anxious and wants to get married in two days. Stephanie tells him he is a bigger fool than Eric is because Eric did not expect the happy ever after with Brooke; he was satisfied with just a few quickies. Ridge becomes annoyed and throws Stephanie out. Brooke warns him that Stephanie is going to cause problems for them. Ridge is glad Stephanie got to hear everything but he tells Brooke he will not hold her to everything she said. Brooke reassures Ridge that she meant everything she said to him. She tells Ridge she loves him and has loved him for longer than she can remember, then they begin to kiss. \n\n\nBack at the Beach House, Stephanie drops by to tell Bridget the news about Ridge and Brooke. Bridget is happy for them if that is what they want. Stephanie tells Bridget that is not what Brooke wants. She says Brooke knows that Nick will not stay with Bridget now that a child is not involved. According to Stephanie, Brooke is trying to close the door on Nick by marrying Ridge, just like she did before when she married Eric.
