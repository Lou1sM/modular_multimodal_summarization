    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester Boutique, which was under construction, Bridget and Felicia questioned Ridge and Brooke's plan to turn their wedding into a publicity stunt for the boutique. Ridge explained that the public was often more interested in him and Brooke than the merchandise. Phoebe asked him to make sure he told her mother about it first, and he affirmed that he would.\n\n\nRick arrived, and Ridge approached, hoping Rick got why Ridge and Brooke had had to put distance between Rick and Phoebe. Rick murmured that they had to do what they had to do.\n\n\nNearby, Bridget sensed that something was worrying her sister. Felicia explained that Dante had remained in Italy to work as an artist -- even if he was only the flavor of the month over there. When she'd declined to pack up the baby and move to Rome, Dante had threatened to sue for custody. Bridget couldn't believe Dante would let Felicia go. Tearfully, Felicia admitted that she'd always assumed that, if he ever had left her, it would be for Bridget.\n\n\nLater, Brooke told Ridge that she had to bid Rick a good night before leaving for the evening. Ridge wondered if he'd gotten too carried away with the wedding/opening thing. Brooke preferred to get married quietly, but when Ridge looked disappointed by that, she asked what woman wouldn't want a sensational wedding. Happy, Ridge kissed her.\n\n\nBrooke left, and Bridget approached Ridge. In conversation, she mentioned that he'd thrown Rick out of Brooke's house. Ridge asked if Bridget had ever been so worked up that she'd done things she wished she hadn't. She asked what he'd been worked up about. Ridge decided that it didn't matter. It was over, and he had Rick to thank for being a complete gentleman.\n\n\nIn the storeroom, Rick took inventory. Phoebe entered and swept him into a kiss. Rick told her that it was wrong, and he'd made a promise. Phoebe thought their parents had been wrong to make them promise. Rick decided that he was leaving on the count of three. He counted, but at \"three,\" he kissed Phoebe instead of going. Brooke walked in, and, devastated, she asked what Rick and Phoebe were doing.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Eric solicited opinions about the boutique's decor. Ann frowned because she didn't taste cream in her tea. Pam said it was because Stephanie and Eric took milk, not cream. \"We'll put it on the shopping list,\" Ann decided, setting down her tea without drinking it.\n\n\nStephanie quipped that the only shopping list Ann had was for a condo of her own. Stephanie was surprised to hear from Pam that Ann hadn't even gone to see the last place on the list. Ann tried to say that she could see problems with it from its brochure. Wanting to see \"this brochure,\" Stephanie marched out the front door. Head down, Ann followed Stephanie.\n\n\nAt the guesthouse, Ann pretended to be unable to find the brochure. Stephanie readily found it and noted that Ann hadn't opened the package it was in. Ann quibbled about the place, but Stephanie asserted that she'd tell the real estate agent that Ann would take it.\n\n\nAnn refused to live there. Stephanie guessed Ann had no intention of leaving the mansion. \"Eric won't let me,\" Ann replied, grinning. Stephanie warned that Eric didn't know Ann like Stephanie did. Ann was done allowing Stephanie to deny Ann her place in the family. Ann proudly said she had grandchildren and great-grandchildren who adored her. She saw no reason to give that up.\n\n\nOnto Ann, Stephanie said Ann wanted to be the head of Stephanie's family, but that position was already filled. Ann, who claimed she'd never seen Stephanie lift a finger around there, contended that Pam was more of a wife to Eric than Stephanie was. Stephanie refused to let her mother judge her. Ann asked what her daughter did except interfere with Eric's business.\n\n\n\"'Eric's business?'\" Stephanie incredulously repeated. Stephanie touted her equal responsibility for the company's success, but Ann asked if women strutted around in Stephanie's designs. Ann minimized Stephanie's contribution to the start-up money from Stephanie's father and felt that Eric didn't need his wife poking around in everything he did.\n\n\nStephanie said her husband relied upon her. Ann stated that it was for a home, meals, and a warm bed. She questioned whether Eric even got that much and warned that marital problems began in the bedroom. Stephanie snapped that Ann knew nothing about Stephanie or her marriage, and if Ann didn't find a place to live, Stephanie intended to ship her back to Chicago.\n\n\nAnn insisted that Eric wouldn't let Stephanie, but Stephanie said Eric didn't tell her what to do. Deciding that it was Eric's only flaw, Ann said, \"If he took a firmer hand with you -- if he were more like your father -- \" Ann stopped speaking, and Stephanie's ominous scowl dared Ann to open her mouth again. \"I think you'd better pack,\" Stephanie uttered and left.\n\n\nBack at the house, Eric was preoccupied, scrolling through camera photos of the boutique. Pam figured that he was worried. Eric said he suddenly wanted someone to talk him out of the venture. Pam chalked it up to jitters. She'd had them when he'd asked her to move to Los Angeles. She assured him that he was doing the right thing, even if it wasn't easy.\n\n\nLater, Eric was alone when Stephanie strode into the living room. Arms crossed, she hoped Eric hadn't been telling her mother about their marriage. Eric didn't know what his wife was talking about. Stephanie wanted her mother back in Chicago, and she'd be fine if her sister left, too. \"That's not going to happen,\" he declared, and Stephanie glared at him.\n\n\nEric decided that if Ann wasn't happy with any property, then she'd stay in the guesthouse. \"I do not want my mother here!\" Stephanie screamed. In Stephanie's view, Ann was contentious and complained just for the sake of disagreeing. \"Well...\" Eric replied knowingly.\n\n\nStephanie guessed Eric thought the same of her. Eric had thought she'd vowed to support him, but in reality, she just wanted to control everything. She didn't know what he was talking about.\n\n\nPam almost entered the room but stopped in the foyer to listen in. Eric said it was like what Stephanie had done in the bedroom the other night. Stephanie asked if he was that shallow. He challenged her to say what was shallow about sex or love. Stephanie had thought they'd had a wonderful time at Big Bear. Eric quipped that it had been like a cool shower after a long drought.\n\n\nCalling it typical of him, Stephanie said Eric had found the perfect retail space but had gotten the jitters. He complained that she'd harangued him for it and had given him the cold shoulder in bed. Eric guessed it would be the same that night, too, because he refused to waffle about Ann. He declared that Pam and Ann would stay at the mansion, even if it meant he had to sleep next to a block of ice for the rest of his life.\n\n\nLater, Eric saw Stephanie preparing to leave the house, but Pam had dinner ready. Stephanie stated that everyone else was working, and someone had to be there to make decisions. It was how the marriage worked; he built air castles, and she did the brick and mortar. She reasoned that she couldn't be a \"wifey wife\" and the foreman at the same time.\n\n\nEric said he'd never asked Stephanie to do that. Agreeing, she replied that in his passive-aggressive way, he always threw a dozen balls in the air, expecting someone else to juggle them. Because of that, she couldn't turn on a dime and become a sex kitten. \"Not even Brooke was that fast on her feet,\" Stephanie quipped and left the house.\n\n\nThrough the window of the guesthouse, Pam saw Stephanie leaving the estate. Ann guessed Eric and Stephanie had had a fight, but Pam said it didn't concern Ann. Ann revealed that Stephanie didn't want Pam there, either, because Pam showed her sister up in Eric's eyes.\n\n\n\"Oh, please,\" Pam murmured and wondered if it was best to return to Chicago. Ann doubted Pam wanted that. Ann felt that it was unfair that Stephanie hadn't had to do anything to deserve her life. Ann figured she was about to say a terrible thing. Though she was partially to blame, she had to admit that Stephanie was a \"damaged person.\"\n\n\nAnn loved Stephanie and had suffered without her, but Ann reasoned that Eric had it worse because he'd had to live with Stephanie. Ann asked if Pam agreed that Eric was a fine man. Pam did agree. Ann reasoned that he deserved better; he deserved someone like Pam.\n\n\n",

Stephanie tells her to hurry in finding a place to live, but soon realizes that Ann has no intention on moving out. Pam overhears an argument between Eric and Stephanie about their poor sex life.

As they gather at the new store, Ridge senses that Brooke isn't happy about having a public wedding but she agrees to the idea for the sake of the business. Felicia tells Bridget that Dante is staying in Italy and wants her and Dino to move there too.

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric is anxious to talk shop for his new stores and Stephanie and Ann keep steering off course in talking about her getting into a condo of her own. The smell of Pam's pot roast keeps looming in the middle. Ann throws it in Stephanie's face that Pam is more a wife to her husband than she is. Stephanie sees through Ann. She is finding fault with all the places as she has no plans to leave. She wants to set herself up as head of this household, but there is no place in this home, that place is taken. Ann doesn't think she needs to do more penance. Stephanie makes it clear she must move out soon or she will help her pack and send her back to Chicago. Felicia and Bridget can't believe Ridge wants to use his wedding as a publicity stunt. He asks Rick if he has cooled off? Rick answers that things are somewhat cooler at Malibu than at his mom's. Ridge thanks him for understanding why he and Brooke had to put distance between he and Phoebe. Felicia cries to Bridget that Dante is staying on in Rome, but it's not going to work out for her to join him. Her career and her personal life are here. Pam eavesdrops as Eric quarrels with Stephanie and ends up accusing her that their one bright spot of sex at Big Bear was simply like a long, cool shower after a long, long draught. And he's NOT waffling about anything else when all he gets is a harangue and the cold shoulder from her in bed. He declares that Pam and Ann are staying here and if he has to sleep next to a block of ice every night, then that's the way it is! She leaves for the office saying somebody has to work. He builds castles in the air and she has to be the foreman to make it work. She's not the wifey-wife type and never will be. And she can't just turn and be a sex kitten too. Not even Brooke was that quick on her feet. Ann points out to Pam that as much as she loves Stephanie, she is damaged. And the person she hurts the most is the husband who stands by her. Pam is more suited to him and he deserves someone more like her. Rick goes to the vacant storeroom for boxes and is attacked by the love-crazy maniac, Phoebe and they kiss. He tells her he made a promise, and this is so wrong. Brooke is shell-shocked when she catches them still kissing.",
