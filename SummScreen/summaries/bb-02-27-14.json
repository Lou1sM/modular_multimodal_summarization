Brooke cooed that Wyatt and Hope reminded her of herself and Ridge, who'd seized every opportunity to be together in their youth. Brooke advised Wyatt and Hope to keep it up because it was hard to remain steadfast in a world of constant distractions.\n\n\nBrooke missed Ridge already but dedicated herself to helping Hope with the event. Wyatt chuckled to himself, and Hope said it was a clue that he was up to something. He assured her that they'd make headlines due to his plan, and the key to the plan was in a nearby suitcase.\n\n\nIn Eric's office, Eric was on a conference call with Thorne and Aly, who were in Paris. Aly was excited about Hope's arrival but asked if Liam would be with Hope. Eric said Hope was with Wyatt, but Aly hoped Wyatt wouldn't be in Paris. Eric didn't think Wyatt would be there, and Aly was relieved.\n\n\nAfter the call, Pam arrived to let Eric know that Wyatt had taken off for Paris. Eric recalled that Wyatt had planned to take Stephanie's jewelry collection to Paris for an appraisal before displaying it at a future HFTF event in Paris; however, Eric hadn't been aware that Wyatt had chosen to do it so quickly. Pam snipped that Wyatt assumed a lot, but Eric replied that Wyatt had Eric's full approval.\n\n\nEric remarked that Aly didn't feel good about Wyatt. Pam became concerned when Eric noted that Aly had been a bit off on their call earlier. Pam asked if Eric thought Aly was having trouble again. Eric was worried because something about Aly's attitude toward Wyatt had alarmed Eric.\n\n\nPam said Thorne would watch over Aly. \"As always,\" Eric drearily replied. Pam asked if Aly's cousins knew what was going on with her. Eric said Thorne and Aly hadn't wanted them to. Pam, who had issues of her own, said the worst of the issues was becoming confused by one's own self.\n\n\nPam figured that Thorne would be able to see the signs and head it off. Eric said he'd seen it before where Aly was calm and quiet before a switch flipped, causing her to get confrontational, angry, and violent. Eric recalled that Aly had had incidents of rage, which had worsened after \"the bullying.\" Pam was upset about the problem, but Eric wondered if he was making more of it than he should.\n\n\nIn Paris after the call with Eric, Aly seemed frustrated that Hope was smart -- except for where Wyatt was concerned. Aly felt that Wyatt made Hope \"different,\" and he was too smooth and slick. Aly didn't like him, and she concluded that he was bad for business and for Hope.\n\n\nThorne asked how long Aly had felt that way about Wyatt. Aly seethed that to know Wyatt was to dislike him, and she spat out a string of bad things about him. Thorne reasoned that Hope might be with Wyatt because she needed a break from her intense relationship with Liam. Aly declared that Hope shouldn't be with Wyatt at all, and the best time for HFTF had been when Hope had been with Liam.\n\n\nAly recalled that back then, Hope had been inspiring to Aly. \"And now Wyatt's here, ruining everything and making a hypocrite of Hope. I wished he'd just go away!\" Aly spat out.\n\n\nLater, Brooke arrived in Thorne's office and complimented him on the job he'd been doing in Paris. Aly rushed off to find Hope, and after Aly had left, Brooke mentioned that Wyatt was there, too. Thorne became concerned, and Brooke asked what was wrong.\n\n\nThorne said he'd just learned that Aly did not like Wyatt, who she felt was a disaster for Hope and the company. Brooke said it sounded extreme, and Thorne admitted that it was what worried him.\n\n\nThorne liked having Aly in Paris, where he could keep an eye on her, and Brooke recalled that Aly had been through a lot and had anger issues over losing Darla at a young age. Thorne stated that Aly had been happy, but he'd seen darkness in her eyes when she'd talked about Wyatt. Thorne prayed that Wyatt wouldn't be the trigger to set Aly off.\n\n\nIn a nearby conference room, Hope was eager to see what Wyatt had in the suitcase. Wyatt revealed Stephanie's jewelry collection and called himself a marketing genius. He said he'd imagined what attention the jewelry would draw to Hope and her line, and he'd gotten Eric's permission to take the jewelry to Paris. Wyatt planned to pitch his marketing idea to Thorne after the appraisal.\n\n\nHope said it was a turn-on how Wyatt never stopped thinking. As she kissed him, Aly peaked in through the doorway. \"Get your hands off of her!\" Aly yelled, charging into the room. \"I said get them off now!\" she screamed at the shocked Wyatt.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Quinn entered, and Bill told her that she had to stop \"coming and going\" as she pleased. Quinn claimed that door had been unlocked, and he assured her that he'd be more vigilant. Quinn told him to lighten up because they were family, but Bill declared that she was just the mother of his child. Quinn quipped that he hadn't been so discerning in the bedroom earlier.\n\n\nBill apologized and attributed it to the evils of alcohol. Quinn wasn't sorry about it and said they couldn't take it back. \"But I can make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he retorted.\n\n\nQuinn advised Bill not to make promises he couldn't keep, and she awed at the idea of them becoming lovers again. \"No, no. That's what I'm trying to make you understand. We are not lovers. We had sex...and I shouldn't have let that happen,\" Bill asserted.\n\n\nBill explained that he was in love with Brooke, but Quinn stated that Brooke wasn't that into him. Quinn imagined that she and Bill could be the \"bizzaro couple for the ages,\" and she offered to make him dinner and unleash her inner beast on him.\n\n\nBill stated that he'd been drunk, and Quinn had been single-minded. Quinn quipped that she'd taken advantage of poor Bill, but he insisted that he wouldn't have initiated anything. To him, it had been as if she'd had an agenda. \"Which begs the question. Are you going to come to me in a couple of months and tell me you're pregnant?\" he asked.\n\n\nQuinn laughed at Bill. She told him to get over himself because there was no way she'd bring her life to a halt to have a baby with him after the kind of father he'd been to Wyatt. Bill stated that she'd never given him a chance, and she retorted that she wouldn't give it to him again, either. A child was nowhere on her list of priorities -- and certainly not having one with him.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Bill had wondered what it would be like if they'd remained together. Bill claimed that that ship had sailed, but she replied that it had been docked in the harbor mere hours earlier. He asserted that it would never happen again.\n\n\nQuinn figured that she'd blown her cover by showing that she still desired Bill on some strange level. She reasoned that she couldn't hate Bill entirely because part of him was within Wyatt. She promised not to let news of their tryst get out, but he said she'd hold it in until he \"pissed\" her off.  Quinn gave her word and asked if that was the end. He said it was, but she replied that she'd see him again.\n\n\nBill asked if Quinn had heard what he'd just said. Quinn dismissively said Brooke and the \"prom queen bimbos\" would never give him what he wanted. She stated that he was ruthless, but she could take what he gave and throw it back harder. To her, he'd never met his real match, and that scared him.\n\n\nQuinn had faith Bill would overcome his fear and look for her. She said, at that point, she might be interested, or she might not; however, he'd be wise to pursue her, the only woman who knew what he wanted and how and when to give it to him. \n\n\n",

Bill sets Quinn straight about how what happened between them the other evening will never happen again. In turn, Quinn proposes that she, Bill and Wyatt try being a family.

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt asks Hope if it is okay that he stowed away. She kisses him and says it is more than all right. He says good, they have a few minutes to spare and her mother is in the other room so Thorne, with Aly at his side, is on a conference call with Eric. She is enjoying Paris but says she will have more fun when Hope gets here. She wonders if Liam is coming with her. He says no, and Hope is not with Liam anymore. She is with Wyatt. Aly confides to Thorne that Hope knows all the right things to do except when it comes to Wyatt. He is bad for Hope. She doesn't understand why she can't see that. Being around Hope is like taking a master class except when it comes to Wyatt. He makes her different. She just wishes he weren't coming. Thorne says yes he picked up on that earlier. She says Wyatt is too slick, too smooth. She doesn't trust or like him. He is bad for HFTF, for the company and especially for Hope. Quinn walks into Liam's cliff house and Bill is quick to tell her that she can't just keep popping in like this. She tells him he's just being a grump and here they are like family. Bill grouses that she is not his family; just the mother of his son, period. She coos that he wasn't making that distinction in his bedroom yesterday. He's sorry about that; evils of alcohol. She says she is not sorry. It happened and he can't take it back. He says okay but he can make sure it doesn't happen again. She warns him not to make promises that he can't keep; who'd have thunk it; them being lovers. Bill says no, no, they are not lovers. They just had sex .,.adult consensual sex. It should not have happened but she caught him with his guard down after more than a couple of drinks. She says he better not say that she tried to take advantage of him. He was a willing participant. He says whatever but he's still in love with Brooke and that will never change. Quinn says Brooke has made it clear that she is not that into Bill so he should just lick his wounds until they heal. Come up for air and look around and he might like what he sees. She offers to make him dinner. They can sit and eat and bat it around. They can bat each other around. He could release his inner beast with her. They could be the bizarro couple of the ages. Pam needs Eric's signature and finds out that Wyatt is also on his way to Paris. He confides in Pam that Aly sounded a little off during her call. Pam wonders if she is having troubles again since she has been doing so well lately. Eric says it was just something in her voice. She made it clear that she really didn't like Wyatt. Pam says but she's with Thorne who will keep a protective eye on her. Pam wonders if any of the younger kids know anything about her problems. Eric says no, that is the way she wanted it and Thorne too. She says she understands. She's had a few issues of her own and it's very challenging. Thorne asks Aly when she started with these negative feelings toward Wyatt as he thought she liked him. She says she did at first. But getting to know him changed all of that. He's a bully. And it's disappointing when Hope choose someone that disrespectful over a genuinely good man. Thorne reminds her that maybe Hope just needed a break and this won't be permanent. Aly states again that she shouldn't be with him at all. She belongs to Liam. And now Wyatt is here ruining everything, making a hypocrite out of Hope. She wishes Wyatt would just go away. Bill tells Quinn that he does not want to hurt her but he can't let her go on thinking this is the beginning of something. It is not. He was in a bad place and just had too much to drink. He never would have initiated it, but she was almost single minded, like she had an agenda. Which begs the question, surely she is not going to come to him in a few months and say she is pregnant. She scoffs and says he needs to get over himself. She would not have her life come to a screeching halt to have another child by him, since the first time had been so good. She laughs that having a child is no where on her list of priorities and especially with him. Hope introduces her stowaway. Brooke thinks they are so cute. It reminds her of Ridge and her. It's important to keep that connection with all the distractions around. Wyatt says he couldn't let Hope go to the city of love alone. Hope accuses him of having something going on. He says he will show her later. It's all locked up now in a suitcase.",
