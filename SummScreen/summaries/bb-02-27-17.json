    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the design office, Pam and Charlotte helped Thomas and R.J. prepare for the intern interviews. R.J. made flirty comments about wanting interns like Charlotte, and Pam reminded the guys to be professional. R.J. thought Thomas had a meeting to go to.\n\n\nThomas replied that he didn't have to go to \"that\" meeting. Pam said it wasn't about business but something more important -- Steffy's wedding. Thomas sarcastically mumbled that the wedding was more important than business.\n\n\nIn separate interviews, Thomas and his team met with Tory, Piper, and Zoe, and the interviews played on-screen in a montage. Zoe wanted to take a year off to study design manufacturing abroad. Thomas was impressed with Tory's designs. Tory said he drew some inspiration from Thomas' designs but mainly from Ridge, who was amazing. Piper was strict on her available hours and wanted to know if it was a paid internship.\n\n\nAfter the process had ended, R.J. thought they had good options. Thomas replied that he was still looking for the one that stood out.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally didn't think the thievery plan with her sister would work. Coco was so honest, she'd once returned a gumball after a machine had dispensed too many. Shirley said Sally's boyfriend needed an intern. Sally balked at the notion that Thomas was her boyfriend. Shirley insisted that they at least needed a spy or a mole, and they could teach Coco along the way.\n\n\nCoco and Darlita entered. Shirley explained to Coco that things weren't looking good at Spectra and asked how she'd feel about interning at Forrester. Coco didn't think the company would hire her, and Sally readily agreed because Coco was a Spectra. Coco wanted to help the family business, and Shirley said Coco would be helping more than she knew.\n\n\nCoco was stoked when she heard that Sally's connection was the hot Thomas. Saul interjected that Sally wasn't that close to Thomas, who Saul called week-old spoiled milk. Coco agreed to give it a try if Spectra didn't need her.\n\n\nSally called Thomas, and he assumed she couldn't stop thinking of him. She pitched her sister as an intern, and he asked if the sister could be there in a quarter of an hour. After the call, Sally announced it was a go. Everyone cheered, but Sally looked a little noncommittal.\n\n\nOnce Coco and Darlita had gone, Shirley tried to convince Sally that it was just business, and it was in their DNA. Sally said that Grams was something else, and Shirley asked Saul to leave the room. After he'd gone, Shirley told Sally to lecture all she wanted, but they couldn't \"pay their nut.\" Shirley said the viable business plan hinged upon Sally's little sister.\n\n\nSally argued that stealing designs and spying was criminal. She didn't think Coco was tough like them. Instead, Coco was a sweet person. Shirley argued that they were, and always would be, knockoff artists, and Sally had better get with the program. Sally replied that she'd thought the program was going to be different.\n\n\nWhen Coco arrived in the Forrester design office later, Pam said she didn't have any more candidates on the list for the day. Thomas advised that he and R.J. would handle it, and Pam and Charlotte exited.\n\n\nThomas, R.J., and Coco introduced themselves, and R.J. flashed a blushing smile at her. Coco had done an independent study in fashion. She'd been hoping to work with Spectra, but she didn't think it would be around much longer. R.J. asked if Spectra was going out of business. Coco replied that she wasn't there to talk about her family problems, but she was sure the family would muddle through it.\n\n\nThomas asked what Coco wanted to get from the internship. Coco had studied the ins and outs of fashion, but she wanted to see it up close and in person. She was there to contribute, and if given the chance, she was sure she would exceed expectations. R.J. grinned dreamily.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Liam and Steffy excitedly waited for the family meeting they'd called to announce their wedding decision. Liam was wary of Quinn being there and groaned when Steffy reminded him to call his father about it. Liam called Bill, who asked if Brooke would be there. Liam added that Ridge would also be there. At Bill's silence, Liam assumed he should just fill Bill in later; however, after the call had ended, Bill rushed out of his office.\n\n\nLater, Eric, Quinn, Ivy, Ridge, and Brooke gathered in the office, and Steffy thanked them for making time for her and Liam, who'd called the meeting to announce their wedding destination. Steffy said that, per her cousin's excellent advice, it would happen in Australia. The date would be soon, and Liam told Eric that he had a plus one because he was married.\n\n\nWhile everyone expressed that they'd love to be there, Ivy carefully observed the looks Ridge and Quinn kept exchanging. Steffy hinted at Brooke and Ridge getting married in Australia, and Quinn shifted in her seat.\n\n\nAs Ridge and Brooke were saying they didn't want to impose on Steffy and Liam, Bill burst into the room. Liam was surprised because he hadn't thought Bill would be there. Bill exclaimed that his and Ridge's children were getting married and asked what that made him and Ridge. \"Still nothing, Bill,\" Ridge responded. Bill said it was just the way they liked it.\n\n\nEric added that Ridge and Brooke were also getting married in Australia. Bill asked Brooke if it was true. Brooke said that she and Ridge had been engaged a while, so it couldn't be a surprise to Bill. Ridge wanted things to slow down. He said he and Brooke would be happy to go on the trip to witness the wedding, but that was it. Thumbing over his shoulder, he stated that anyone who couldn't be there could stream it at his gym.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Ridge was saying he wouldn't get married at the same time. Ridge replied that he hadn't said so, but Ivy chimed in that it had sounded that way to her. Ivy also caught another exchange of looks between Ridge and Quinn. Bill stated that Liam and Steffy shouldn't share the day they'd wanted for so long. \"Liam and I want this. Don't we, babe?\" Steffy said.\n\n\nRidge didn't care where he and Brooke got married, but he wanted it to be private and for their vows to be just between them. Steffy told Ridge to just get on board. \"I don't want to be rude, but I don't enjoy everyone here,\" Ridge replied, thumbing at Bill again.\n\n\nBill stated that it was mutual. He said Ridge had let Brooke down so many times that they'd forgotten how many times. Bill wouldn't be surprised if Ridge did it again. Brooke stopped the arguing and admonished Bill for saying Ridge would let her down. Ridge never had, and she thought it was silly of Bill to even suggest it.\n\n\nRidge told Steffy that her wedding would be wonderful. \"Our weddings. I'm not letting it go,\" Steffy said. Eric decided there was a lot of planning to do. He asked Liam, Ivy, and Steffy to go with him to the design house. Quinn was puzzled when Eric wanted her to stay behind and referee. Quinn sat back down, and everyone Eric asked to go with him exited.\n\n\nBill wanted to talk to Brooke alone. Ridge said it wouldn't happen. Bill didn't care if Ridge stuck around because it was nothing he hadn't told Brooke before. Bill said Brooke was asking for heartbreak. He wished she didn't have to put herself through it again, but he'd be there when Ridge hurt her, which was what Ridge always did. Bill didn't want Brooke to suffer, but he was sure she would.\n\n\nRidge and Quinn exchanged looks. Brooke insisted that those days were in the past. She and Ridge had gone full circle. They were destined, and \"if you can't accept that...\" Brooke said.\n\n\nBill assumed Brooke would tell him not to go to his son's wedding, but Bill insisted that he would go. Brooke said that Ridge hadn't done anything to let her down. She trusted Ridge implicitly.\n\n\nRidge flashed to kissing Quinn, who was watching him.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that she and Ridge would spend the rest of their lives together. Ridge hugged her. Bill turned his back, and Ridge gazed at Quinn as he caressed Brooke.\n\n\n",

He calls Bill to warn him the families are getting together and Ridge will be there. Sally is aghast that Shirley wants to plant Coco at FC to steal their designs. Shirley says they need her.

Shirley rants that this is like a recipe for Mulligan stew and Sally needs to get with the program. Bill tells Liam this is his day; there is no sharing with Brooke and Ridge. He also tells the group that he has forgotten how many times that Ridge has let Brooke down and he knows it will happen again. Eric leaves and then Bill says he would like to talk to Brooke. He wishes she did not have to put herself thru this again with Ridge. She says those days are over. Ridge is her destiny and Bill needs to accept that.
