Though Taylor had moved to Paris, she still saw patients in Los Angeles. Eric excitedly showed her the work that Hope and Wyatt had been doing and said Stephanie's jewelry collection would be debuting in Paris.\n\n\n\"On a more predictable note,\" Taylor said, and she relayed that she'd heard about Brooke and Ridge's reunion. Eric asked if Taylor had seen Aly in Paris. Taylor sensed that something troubled Eric about Aly, and Eric explained his uneasiness about Aly's attitude toward Wyatt.\n\n\nTaylor reminded Eric that she had a bad history with Aly. Eric said he'd thought that having Aly shadow Hope would be positive for Aly, who'd had violent reactions at school. After assessing Aly's attitude about Wyatt, Eric had decided that Aly needed therapy. Though Taylor wanted to help, she doubted she was the person for the job.\n\n\nTaylor reasoned that Aly hadn't gotten over what had happened with Taylor and Darla. Eric said that it had been an accident; however, Taylor replied that she'd killed Aly's mother, which was unforgivable -- accident or not. Taylor flashed back to telling Aly that Darla had died and to Aly destroying Taylor's wedding dress when Taylor had been about to marry Thorne.\n\n\nTaylor hadn't forgiven herself for Darla's death. She suspected that Aly's troubles went even deeper than the death, and Hope and Wyatt would have their hands full with an out-of-control Aly.\n\n\nIn Thorne's office in Paris, Thorne conveyed to Brooke that Aly had wanted to be at the wedding, but he'd requested for her to be in Paris because he'd sensed something troubling within her. He said that Aly adored Hope and had really taken to the HFTF message, but Aly believed that Hope had lost her way after meeting Wyatt.\n\n\nThorne and Brooke discussed how none of the younger generation knew that Aly had problems. Thorne wanted to keep it that way, and Brooke hoped that her daughter and Wyatt would win Aly over. The skeptical Thorne conveyed that when Hope had started seeing Wyatt, Aly had viewed it as a betrayal, and she'd been devastated when Liam and Hope's wedding hadn't happened.\n\n\nIn a conference room, Aly ordered Wyatt to take his hands off Hope. Hope asked what the problem was, and Aly answered that it was Wyatt. She didn't know how Hope could let him kiss her. \"It's disgusting,\" Aly said, grimacing.\n\n\nAly stated that she'd admired Hope a great deal; however, Wyatt was ruining Hope's message. Aly asked what had happened to commitment and self-respect, and she stated that she didn't even know Hope anymore. Hope asked how long Aly had felt that way, and Aly replied that it had been since Wyatt. \"I hate it. I hate it!\" Aly shouted.\n\n\nJust then, Thorne and Brooke arrived. They were cheerful but seemed to sense the tension in the room. Thomas arrived and excitedly greeted his cousin, Aly. Thorne announced that Wyatt had a presentation to make, and Aly glared at Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt told listeners that HFTF had become the industry's darling, but they would make it the industry's addiction \"with this.\" He unveiled what he called the Stephanie Forrester Collection. Everyone was awed at the jewels -- except Aly, whose dagger-like stare penetrated Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt remarked that Stephanie's name was synonymous with elegance, and people had seen Stephanie at events in her jewels. Lifting up a pearl necklace, he said everyone had seen her wearing it on magazine covers. Wyatt asserted that the collection was a fashion artifact, and Forrester had the responsibility to show it to the world.\n\n\nWyatt suggested that they display the collection at the upcoming show in Paris. As Thorne listened, he carefully studied the expressions on his daughter's face.  Everyone agreed that Wyatt had a good idea. -- except Aly. \"How dare you make a spectacle of my grandmother!\" Aly asserted.\n\n\nAly told Wyatt that the jewels were precious heirlooms, but he wanted to make a sideshow out of them. Thorne and Thomas tried to explain to Aly that it would honor Stephanie, but Aly called it a publicity stunt in line with \"that stupid blue diamond.\"\n\n\nAly wanted HFTF to get back on track with its message. Wyatt said that the sales were off the charts, but Aly told everyone to notice that it was all about money for Wyatt. \"We don't need money,\" Aly contended; instead, they needed to stay true to what Hope represented.\n\n\nBrooke agreed that HFTF message had been good, but she added that it had caused problems. Aly claimed that it hadn't done that for her and Hope's admirers. Aly said she was online every day, reminding people of what HFTF stood for, and they couldn't let the Fullers pollute the message.\n\n\nHope explained that the message had been good but problematic, and the line was no longer about the message. Aly yelled that it should be, because the message had been the best part.\n\n\nLater, the meeting had concluded, and alone with Wyatt, Hope told him that he'd done well. Wyatt murmured that one person didn't think so, and Hope apologized for Aly's unexpected outburst. Wyatt assumed that Aly would eventually \"come around -- or not.\" As the two began kissing, Aly cracked the door open and glared into the room.\n\n\nHope exited to search for her mother, and Aly returned to the room. Wyatt looked up when the door closed. In a measured tone, Aly said that kids had made fun of her in school; they'd called her nerdy and self-absorbed. Wyatt replied that she wasn't self-absorbed. \"No, you are,\" Aly asserted.\n\n\nAly accused Wyatt of destroying Hope, the line, and even the Forrester family by turning her grandmother's legacy into a circus act. Wyatt began to speak; however, she cut him off, saying that he could do what he wanted regarding the Fullers, but he'd respect the Forresters and their company.\n\n\nAly said that Hope couldn't see how bad Wyatt was for her, but Aly could. Aly felt that Hope should have married Liam, but instead, Hope had compromised everything she'd believed in. \"I have to save her -- from you!\" Aly declared.\n\n\nLater, Hope found Thorne and Brooke to discuss what had happened with Wyatt and Aly. Brooke and Thorne explained that Aly really looked up to Hope and had really absorbed Hope's message. The uncertain Hope murmured, \"But to go off on Wyatt like that...\"\n\n\nBrooke was sure Aly would get used to Wyatt, and Hope remarked that it was possible because he could charm the skin off a snake. Thorne smiled, but his concern was evident on his face.\n\n\nBack in the conference room, Wyatt advised Aly to calm down. Furious, Aly accused Wyatt of using jewelry that didn't belong to him to entice Hope away from Liam, the sweetest man anyone could want. Wyatt ordered her to slow down, but she said there was nothing to him but his greed.\n\n\nPointing her finger in his face, Aly called Wyatt \"Big Shot, Mr. Popular.\" To her, he loved turning heads and trending without giving a darn about Hope or the collection. Wyatt asked if Aly was finished. Aly vowed to see to it that Wyatt wouldn't have Hope bedazzled for much longer.\n\n\nAly claimed that she hadn't been the most popular girl in school, but she knew Wyatt's type. He was like the ones who'd hung out with the jocks and dumb cheer girls. \"I know exactly who you are,\" she seethed. Wyatt said it hadn't been like that for him. He wanted to get along with Aly, and he suggested that she try to see the benefits of his campaign.\n\n\nWyatt stated that Stephanie wouldn't mind the campaign, and Aly swooped into his personal space and shouted that he hadn't known her grandmother. Wyatt told Aly that they were on the same team, but she insisted that he'd never touch Hope again. Wyatt quipped that it was too late for that because he and Hope were members of the mile-high club.\n\n\n\"How dare you!\" Aly shrieked and backhanded Wyatt. Aly ordered him to pack up his jewels and mother and return to the slimy place they'd emerged from. \"You are officially fired from Forrester Creations, and you will not go near Hope again. Have I made myself perfectly clear?\" she asked. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Hope and Wyatt are shocked by Aly\u2019s candidness when she gives her opinion about their relationship. Wyatt pitches a new HFTF jewelry line to the creative team at Forrester International. Aly attempts to convince Hope that Wyatt and Quinn are having a negative impact on the image of Forrester Creations. Old wounds are re-opened when Eric gets a surprise visit from a former friend and lover.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt kisses Hope. Aly is peeking behind the door and bursts in and shouts at Wyatt to take his hands off of Hope right now. It catches them so by surprise that they don't know if she is serious or what. Thorne confides in Brooke that Aly thinks Wyatt is bad for Hope and the company. Aly wanted to be at Brooke's wedding but he sensed something was wrong then. That's why he flew her to Paris and put her to work with the HFTF collection which she loves. She has her whole room with promo material all over the wall and Hope's quotes on her bulletin board. She admires Hope and her message. She lives by it and it has helped her through some tough situations. But with Wyatt she sees Hope as losing her way. Thorne says it is not Wyatt's fault. He doesn't even know Aly has a problem. Neither does Hope or the younger kids and he'd like to keep it that way. Brooke says she has to hope that Hope and Wyatt will win Aly over. Thorne wants to agree but he says when Aly is in that spiral, there is not much anyone can do. She idolizes Hope but that is part of the problem. Hope was perfect in her eyes. But when she started seeing Wyatt she felt betrayed. He tells Brooke that he is glad she is here. He needs all the support he can get. He hates to see her like this. It is ripping him apart. Eric is surprised to see Taylor walk into his office, They hug. She says all is fine and with Thorne in Paris the entire company has been energized. Eric tells her about Hope and Wyatt being in Paris now with Stephanie's jewelry. She brings up the obvious that Ridge is back now with Brooke. She is okay with that if it is what both want. He asks if she saw Aly before she left. She says no and asks how she is. Eric says okay until she heard Wyatt's name and that set her off. She obviously doesn't like him but the way she said it with that tone in her voice scared him. She was very aggressive and very, very negative. And he's worried about her. Taylor says Eric knows her history with Aly and she's always had concerns for her. Hope asks Aly what's the problem. Aly sneers that Wyatt is the problem. He's wrong for her, all wrong. Wyatt thinks she is joking. Aly says no and she can't believe Hope would let him touch or kiss her. It's disgusting. Hope tries to calm her down and find out what's bothering her. Aly goes on a tirade \u0096 HFTF, her message. She is ruining it. Wyatt is ruining it. Wyatt gets it \u0096 she is not joking. Aly continues that she admired Hope so much, her commitment, her self-respect but she doesn't recognize her anymore. And it all started when he came into her life. She hates it. Thorne and Thomas walk in and Thorne asks what is going on. Hope tells Aly that she is sorry if she upset her. Thorne says Wyatt has a presentation to make so Brooke joins in. Wyatt says they are trending all over the world. HFTF is the industry darling and now they are going to make it the industry addiction with this \u0096 the Stephanie Forrester collection. Wyatt points out many pieces when people will remember that Stephanie wore at openings and galas. She was the matriarch of the family. The blue HFTF diamond was a smashing success and this will keep the momentum going. Everyone agrees it will be a great promotion ..well everyone but Aly. She lashes out at Wyatt that how dare he make a spectacle of her grandmother. These are family heirlooms, not a circus sideshow. This is so wrong. Thorne tries to tell her this is an incredible collection that will honor her grandmother. Aly says HFTF has a message and it's not this publicity stunt like the stupid diamond one. They have to get HFTF back on track. She says with Wyatt it's all about money. They don't need money. They need to stay true to the principles and values. Brooke adds that the message was wonderful but it was problematic. Aly says not for her. She's on line every day with Hope's fans. She can not let Wyatt and his mother pollute that message. Hope reminds her the line is not so much the message anymore. Aly says it should be. Taylor tells Eric that she wishes she could reach out and help Aly out but she's not the one to do that. It was an inexcusable accident but she did cause her mother's death. And she will never forget how she cut up her dress on her wedding day. And the loss of her mother is not the worst of the problem. If she is spiraling downward, then Hope and Wyatt will have their hands full. Hope tells Wyatt that he did good and she is sorry for the way Aly went off on him. Hopefully Aly will come around. Aly peeks in the door just as Wyatt and Hope kiss. She excuses herself to go see her mother. Aly makes her presence known by slamming the door. Wyatt is packing some of the jewelry away. She says kids at school used to tease her that she was nerdy and self-absorbed. But it is Wyatt that is self-absorbed. She says he is destroying Hope and this family and she can't let that happen. He tries to reason with her but she cuts him off. She puts her finger in his face and says he can do what he wants with the Fullers but when it comes to her family he will respect them. Wyatt wants to know what did he ever do to Aly or where this is coming from. She continues that Hope is caught up in something. She can't see it but Aly can. She tells Wyatt that he is bad for Hope. She should have just married Liam but she didn't. She became a hypocrite and compromised everything. Aly says she has to save Hope from him. And she is going to and put a stop to all of this. Hope asks Brooke to tell her more about Aly. Thorne says he will take care of it. Brooke says Aly will come around as far as Wyatt; how could she not. Hope says yeah that guy could charm the skin off a snake. Wyatt tells Aly that he doesn't know where the anger is coming from but she needs to calm down. She mentions that he enticed her away from Liam .the nicest, sweetest, funniest man anyone could ever want. He tells her again that she needs to slow down. Instead she gets more in his face and calls him greedy and Mr. Popular, Mr. Big Shot. He may have Hope dazzled but not for much longer. She's gonna see to that. She says she may not have been the most popular girl in school but she knows his type .hanging around the lockers with all the jocks and the dumb cheer girls. He says it was not like that for him and he'd really like to get along her with her. He says the promotion is going to be good for the line and the company and he thinks Stephanie would not have minded either. He says again they are both in this together, like a family. She rants no they are not, not even close. They are not part of anything ad he will never touch Hope again. He better hear that. He hesitates for a moment and then says it is a little late since they are both a member of the mile-high club. She clobbers him across the mouth and tells him how dare he. With his jaw turned, she grabs a fistful of jewels. On her way out she tells him to pack up his jewels. Then take his mother and go back to his slimy home because he is done here. He is officially fired from FC and will not go near Hope again. She hopes she has made herself perfectly clear.",
