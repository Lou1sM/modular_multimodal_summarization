He said it would all be over when Rick returned to Europe. Before Brooke could explain, Stephanie led in Jarrett, the reporter from Eye on Fashion. He wanted an exclusive advance interview before the proposed Rodeo Drive wedding.\n\n\nAs Ridge droned on about the plans, Jarrett finally interrupted and questioned Brooke, Ridge, and Stephanie about Rick and Phoebe's relationship, since he'd seen their photo from the coffee shop duet on the Internet. They all denied anything was going on, and Stephanie threatened Jarrett that the kids were off-limits, or Jarrett would never see another exclusive. After Jarrett left, Ridge and Brooke argued about Rick's understanding of the importance of his actions.\n\n\nAt Bridget's beach house, Rick was packing, and Bridget teased that he hadn't worn out his welcome yet. He filled her in on the fact that he and Phoebe couldn't stay away from each other. As Brooke entered, Bridget warned Rick that it would be a big problem to Ridge and Brooke. Brooke told Rick she hadn't had a chance to break the news to Ridge about Rick and Phoebe. As they talked, Stephanie walked in, accusing them all of lying about Rick's relationship with Phoebe.\n\n\nBrooke, Rick, and Bridget told Stephanie it was none of her business, but she told them all that the family had bet the farm on the new business venture, and the bad publicity with the Internet photo could blow the whole thing. Stephanie continued telling Brooke she had supported Brooke's marriage to Ridge, but she thought it was a mistake, since Brooke was lying to cover for Rick. Stephanie also told them that she wanted to protect Phoebe -- a vulnerable 18-year-old girl who had been through a lot that year. Brooke and Rick said Rick would never do anything to hurt Phoebe. Stephanie appealed to Bridget, who said everything got worse when Stephanie got involved. Arguing escalated, with Rick and Bridget defending their mom to Stephanie, who warned them all she'd make sure Ridge knew about the cover-up.\n\n\nOnboard the powerless Shady Marlin, adrift in the bay, Nick and Taylor cuddled, with Nick telling Taylor it was the first time he had made love on the Marlin while drifting at sea and that he has a deal with the Marlin that it would restart with a replacement fuse, so there was no need to worry about the power outage. Taylor told Nick she felt everything was going to be fine, and she wondered if they could sail around the world and be explorers. They dreamily snuggled in each other's arms, falling asleep.\n\n\nNick awakened to the sound of a tanker approaching as waves began to toss the Marlin around. He woke Taylor, telling her they had to get off the boat, but it capsized before they could get out. Searchlights illuminated the sea, which was strewn with debris that had once been the Marlin. Nick surfaced, desperately looking for Taylor but not finding her. He repeatedly dove underwater and finally found an unconscious Taylor. He pulled her to safety aboard a floating chunk of the Marlin, where he began mouth-to-mouth.\n\n\n",

Ridge knows Rick will be back in Paris soon with all the wild ladies he can handle, but it's his sweet little girl, his hopeless romantic that he's worried about. Before Brooke can say more, Stephanie interrupts with Jarrett to get his exclusive. And he lets slip that word is that Phoebe and Rick were in perfect harmony the other night at Insomnia. Stephanie sets him straight, they want him to concentrate on the fashion business and not the young kids otherwise he may not be privy to his exclusives in the future. Later Stephanie tells Brooke that teenagers having crushes on others is one thing, but her son is a grown man and this is absolutely inappropriate. Ridge advises her that it's all taken care of. Brooke even chimes in that Rick knows the importance of this launch, while Stephanie reminds her that Jarrett also knows the importance of a sex scandal. Ridge reemphasizes to Brooke that he knows they have made mistakes, but he values the sanctity of marriage and this time he wants to get it right. Brooke reveals to Rick that she wants to tell Ridge but she wasn't able to tell him just yet. The press already knows. Stephanie is close behind and walks into the beach house and asserts her opinion that none of them have handled this well and she knows that Rick has no intention of backing off. Straightforward to Brooke, she says she has supported her and Ridge getting married again, but if she is lying when she says this is all taken care of, then all bets are off. And to Rick, is his mother telling her the truth? Has he called it off with Phoebe or not? From his silence, she knows the answer. She laments to Brooke that she is making a mistake, a BIG mistake, especially when Ridge finds out.
