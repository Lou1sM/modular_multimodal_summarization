    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Sally, Shirley, Saul, and Darlita discussed that there was a leak in he building. Darlita wanted to call a plumber, but Shirley advised that C.J. owned the building and had to fix it. Sally learned that the printer had no ink, and Shifty had called about loan repayment. Saul wondered how Sally would repay the loan or pay her employees if she had no orders.\n\n\nCoco entered, and Shirley wanted to send her on her way for her first day at Forrester with advice on how to be a Spectra spy. Coco insisted she wasn't going to be a spy and steal designs. Shirley said she would be borrowing the designs -- not stealing. Then Spectra team would tweak them enough to not get sued. Sally explained that they would use different, cheaper fabric and then take the designs to market. Coco shook her head.\n\n\nSally agreed and sent Coco off on her first day at Forrester. Coco said she didn't want to be the reason Spectra failed, but Sally called it nonsense. After Coco left, Sally said she shouldn't risk Coco's future in fashion by turning her into a spy  -- and she didn't want to repay Thomas' kindness by stealing from him. Shirley didn't have a problem with stealing.\n\n\nC.J. showed up about the leak and said he didn't want to pour more money into a building he wanted to sell. Sally told everyone to get back to work, but C.J. and Darlita scoffed that there wasn't any work. C.J. shook his head and reminded Sally that the one review she'd had was horrible.\n\n\n\"How do you think you can make any of these designs and make them sell?\" C.J. asked. Shirley and Sally said they were going to make a comeback. C.J. countered that they were wasting time. Shirley maintained that they had a plan. \"Just like your mama, we're not gonna go down without a fight,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Maya, Rick, Thomas, and R.J. discussed that R.J. and Thomas had interviewed interns, and R.J. was in charge of them. Rick noted that it was a big job. He added that it included building tours and ensuring that the interns were comfortable and felt that Forrester was a friendly place.\n\n\nRick asked for the list of new interns and saw the name Spectra on the list. Thomas said Coco Spectra was a good fit. \"Not happening,\" Rick said. R.J. and Thomas exchanged a glance. Rick advised them that he didn't want a Spectra working there.\n\n\nZende and Nicole entered and interrupted the meeting. Everyone welcomed them back from their honeymoon. They looked at honeymoon photos, and Rick joked that it was too bad they hadn't gotten a professional to take the photos. Rick added that they had influenced Steffy and Liam to finally set a date and venue. Rick added that he would need them to help out while Steffy and Liam were gone on their honeymoon. Zende and Nicole said they were ready to get to work.\n\n\nThe discussion returned to hiring Coco Spectra as an intern. Rick looked at her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and said it was normal, but he was not at all happy about the food fights he had seen on social media. Thomas said that even Steffy had said Coco was harmless. R.J. complained that they had already told her she had the job. He wondered how they could tell her she didn't. Nicole advised that they ask Carter before they made a decision.\n\n\nCoco entered, and Thomas and R.J. welcomed her. They introduced her to everyone. Rick worried aloud that her family had a history of stealing designs from Forrester. Thomas and R.J. defended her, but she spoke for herself. She said it had been a pleasure meeting all of them, and she would be honored to work there, but she understood the family history.\n\n\nCoco reminded all of them that she had not been responsible for what her family had done in past decades. Rick appreciated her honesty. Coco understood that whatever Spectra had done in the past was something her Aunt Sally had done, and she understood it might have compromised Forrester business. \"But I never will. Get to know me. You'll see me and never question my loyalty,\" she said. She added that it was true she was a Spectra, but when she was at their company, she was a Forrester.\n\n\nRick asked Coco to step outside for a minute. She stepped outside the office, and R.J. accompanied her. Inside, the crew discussed what to do. Thomas reminded Rick and Maya that Coco posed little threat. Everyone doubted that Sally Spectra could return to business. Her reviews had been horrible, and all she did was knockoffs. Rick insisted he wanted what was best for Forrester.\n\n\nOutside the office, R.J. told Coco he had been impressed with how she'd stood up to Rick. She said she understood that the Spectra name included a lot of baggage. Thomas opened the door and asked Coco to return to the office. Rick seemed gruff, but he said he wanted to trust her. He said they had the highest level of security. Maya added that it was the most important thing -- to protect Forrester designs. Coco understood.\n\n\nRick added that if anyone ever let the competition have a glimpse of their designs, they would be dismissed. \"That's why I'd have to let you go, you understand?\" he asked. Coco nodded.\n\n\n\"Good. Then remember that if I ever have to let you go. You are worth taking a chance, so don't mess it up,\" Rick said with a laugh. Coco promised she would not mess up. She had known there would be some hesitation because she was a Spectra. She promised to be loyal. \"Thank you for believing in me -- all of you,\" she said. She shook hands with everyone and smiled at R.J.\n\n\nAt Spectra, C.J. quizzed Sally and Shirley about their ideas to succeed. He asked if they had some crazy scheme because there was always a crazy scheme. Sally begged for a few more days. C.J. scoffed that they would never accomplish anything, but Shirley said the plan was already in place. C.J. shook his head and left.\n\n\nSally told her grandmother they would have to get Coco on board as a spy. \"We have to do it. It doesn't matter how loyal she thinks she has to be to them. She has to be loyal to us. We're family. She needs to rob them blind,\" Sally said. Shirley agreed.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Shirley continues to press for Coco to steal designs from her new work place whereas Sally is hesitant to betray her crush Thomas.

    "tvmega_recap": "Rick wants RJ to reassure him that he is ready for this. Being with interns is more than just babysitting them. Rick bucks when he sees one of the interns is a Spectra ..no that is not happening. Thomas says she seems real and he will stand up for her. Nicole and Zende return from their honeymoon and show everyone their pictures. Shirley asks Coco how was her first day as a Forrester intern and as a Spectra spy. She replies she is sorry they are doing badly but she does not feel right stealing. Sally says they really only borrow the design, change the fabric and make it their own. They will not fail. Sally tells the others that she is not going to let her sister go out on the limb and try to save them. Sally tells everyone to get busy and go back to work, they have a collection to make. CJ tells her she can stop; he saw the review by Maxwell. Spectra Fashions is not going to make a comeback so she needs to accept that. Thomas tells Rick they already gave Coco the job so Rick looks again and says her resume looks good enough so they will give her a chance. In walks Coco, and RJ introduces her to everyone. Rick is still skeptical and asks if they should trust her. Sally tells Mr. Doom and Gloom they are not going to accept defeat. He tells them do not waste any more time on this, the name will hold them back. Shirley says Spectra's do not go down without a fight. Coco tells Rick that he is right that her family has a history but whatever damage they caused has nothing to do with her. She is a honest person and they will never question her loyalty. If they will just give her a chance she will be forever grateful. Rick says they need a moment to think this over. He tells Thomas that he has heard enough and he just wants what is best for FC. RJ finds Coco and says he trusts her and if she keeps the job he hopes she will not let them down. Nicole tells Zende there is a honesty about Coco even though she brings baggage. CJ asks Shirley what the scheme is now as sooner or later he will hear about it. Shirley says they have the right person at the right time and the right place, she is already in. RJ tells Coco is it obvious that she can handle herself. She was grilled by Rick and did not flinch a bit. Rick tells her that he could not help but be skeptical and if the press gets one glimpse of a knockout then it will be months down the drain for them and he will have to let her go. But he is giving her one chance now so do not screw it up. She thanks all of them for believing in her. Sally says Coco is on the inside and despite her working there, she is going to have to rob them blind as she is a Spectra.",
