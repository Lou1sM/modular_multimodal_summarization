    "tvmega_recap": "Rick doesn't want to answer Stephanie's question. She states to Brooke that she's going to marry Ridge. And she told him that nothing was going on between Rick and Phoebe. But she's sneaking around behind his back playing Cupid and she thinks he deserves to know. Brooke snaps that she resents Stephanie barging into her daughter's home while she is having a private conversation with her son and daughter and throwing around her accusations. Stephanie exclaims that she is concerned about the family and about a scandal. Furthermore, Brooke says she can go right back to Ridge and tell him the wedding is off because she is not going to sign up for a lifetime of this and having her children under surveillance. Stephanie reports fine, she is only trying to protect the family from a cloud of scandal and new business venture. What is Brooke protecting? Nick accompanies Taylor on the gurney into the hospital where the doctors say she has hypothermia, but he did a good job of getting her there and clearing out her lungs, the condition could have been worse. Ridge summons Phoebe into his office and reveals to her his displeasure of seeing her and Rick's picture plastered on the Internet. Nick calls Bridget about Taylor and the entire room hears her concerns. Rick wants to go be with Phoebe. Brooke advises against this, but he won't take no for an answer or let Ridge dictate what he does. Nick is very attentive and quips that there will be no more ships for Taylor. It's one thing to move the entire Earth with the Pacific Ocean. Stephanie hovers as she tells Taylor that Ridge is on his way. And she advises Taylor not to throw herself away over a bum like Nick. Taylor laments that she is sorry that Nick lost The Marlin. He looks at it as losing one lady and gaining another. Rick tells Phoebe that Stephanie is watching them like a hawk. And that his mom hasn't had time to talk to Ridge about this, but she's okay with them as long as they keep it quiet and don't say anything to anyone. Ridge tells his mother to leave Brooke alone and stop accusing everyone. If she can't do that, then don't come to the wedding or to their house and they won't go to hers. Slightly jealous, Brooke watches Nick with Taylor. She jokes that it's so not cool to sleep with a woman and then not stay the night. He tells her he thinks he is falling for her and he never thought he'd hear those words. Stephanie accuses Brooke of helping Rick and Phoebe, that's her cross to bear that she sees Brooke for what she is and nobody else does. There's potential harm and Brooke has slept through her family and she is not going to sit and watch her son do the same.",
