    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke lay on the floor, groaning. \"It's one thing to slap me, but to waste my vodka?\" Brooke said, gesturing to her spilled drink. Quinn ordered Brooke to stay away from Deacon, and Brooke asked if Deacon was in her house.\n\n\nBrooke said she was no threat to Quinn but wouldn't stay away from Deacon because of Hope. Quinn noted that Hope was grown and living in another country. Quinn guessed that, because no other man would have Brooke, Brooke would go after the man she'd shunned for years. Quinn asked if Brooke thought she could take him from Quinn. Brooke replied that she didn't think it, but Quinn did.\n\n\nQuinn apologized. She didn't know what had gotten into her. She tried to help Brooke up, but Brooke screamed not to touch her. Quinn said she shouldn't have slapped Brooke and offered to clean up the drink. Brooke got up and called Quinn a psycho for slapping Brooke to the ground. Quinn noted that Brooke hadn't been steady on her feet to start with.\n\n\nQuinn welcomed Brooke to get drunk and pass out, as long as it wasn't around Deacon. Quinn claimed she'd only cared for two men in her life, Bill and Deacon, but Deacon actually wanted to be with her. She wouldn't let Brooke take him away. \"I don't desire Deacon,\" Brooke replied. However, Brooke added that he was a good friend and listener, so Brooke would hang out with him if she wanted to.\n\n\nBrooke ordered Quinn to go and locked the door behind Quinn. Brooke poured another drink and hugged her bottle. In her dark house, Brooke grabbed a family photo. She stared at it as she puttered over to the couch and plopped down. She sobbed and drank more.\n\n\nAt the loft, Wyatt thought Deacon should be going to Brooke's house, where Quinn had undoubtedly been headed. Deacon wasn't concerned. He figured Brooke was passed out in bed and wouldn't even hear Quinn knocking. Deacon felt he'd made a good decision in taking Brooke home. \"As long as you didn't make any bad decisions while you were over there,\" Wyatt quipped.\n\n\nWyatt was skeptical about what had gone on at Brooke's house that had led to Brooke being in a bikini. Deacon insisted that nothing had happened. Wyatt claimed to know Deacon's history with Brooke and what could happen if she was knocking back drinks. Wyatt said Quinn hadn't cared about another man that way since his father, and he warned Deacon not to hurt her.\n\n\nLater, Deacon was alone and thinking of what had transpired with Brooke that day. Quinn arrived and claimed she'd been running errands. As he fixed her a plate, she asked if he'd leave her for \"her.\" He said he wouldn't leave Quinn for anyone, and he loved and respected her. He added that he'd told her that he hadn't wanted to hide anything from her.\n\n\nDeacon noted that Quinn hadn't answered his calls or messages. He figured she'd gone to Brooke's house and asked what had happened. Quinn admitted to going there, and he asked if Brooke had been asleep or still drinking. Quinn carefully replied that she might have knocked some sense into Brooke about drinking. \"Thanks -- I think,\" Deacon replied.\n\n\nQuinn insisted that she'd had to go over there and say something because Brooke didn't get drunk and invite a man to a swim party for no reason. Deacon said Brooke was lonely. Quinn argued that with family and other available men around, Brooke didn't know loneliness, and Brooke could find any other man in town to tuck her in besides Deacon. Deacon hugged Quinn.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Steffy found her father and began discussing the takeover plan. Ridge was concerned about Bill's involvement, and he needed to talk to Carter about the legal aspects of it. Ridge was open to the deal, but he didn't want to get Steffy's hopes up about things. He wanted Rick out of the office but couldn't make a decision just to fix Steffy's love life.\n\n\nSteffy claimed not to be asking that, but Ridge replied that she was. She said she was asking him to fix the company, and the rest would fall into place. Ridge took off to talk more with Liam about the deal.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Ivy and Liam made out, and Ivy quipped that she wasn't even wearing a bikini. She said that hearing him defend their relationship earlier had meant a lot to her, but another shot with Steffy must have been tempting. Liam said it had been, but not in the way Ivy thought.\n\n\nLiam said there were a lot of questions surrounding what could have been for him and Steffy. If he hadn't had Ivy, he might have gotten caught up in it. Ivy hated that their relationship stood between him and the Forrester shares. He said they had to hope Steffy changed her mind. Ivy stated that he needed Steffy and Ridge's shares to make it happen.\n\n\nIvy decided to leave to get more work done. Liam explained that it wasn't her fault if the takeover didn't work. She wished Steffy could rise above her feelings to do what was best for everyone.\n\n\nLater, Ivy arrived in the Forrester CEO's office in time to hear Steffy ending a call with a hint that she might move to Los Angeles. Ivy said Steffy should make the move because the company needed her. Steffy quipped that a lot would have to change for her to make the move, and if Liam wanted to take over Forrester, being with Steffy was part of the package.\n\n\nIvy stated that Liam wouldn't go back to his past relationship. She said she and Liam had discussed Steffy kissing him, and the honesty had been a bonding experience. Steffy wasn't buying it. To her, Ivy seemed confident on the outside, but Ivy was scared that her couple of months with Liam didn't compare to Steffy's history. Steffy revealed that Ridge had gone to see Liam, and if the men struck a deal, Ivy's little bonding experience wouldn't add up to much.\n\n\nBack at the cliff house, Ridge arrived to Liam stating that he \"knew you\" couldn't stay away. Ridge asked if Liam had been expecting Ivy or Steffy and warned that Liam's answer could affect why Ridge was there. Liam guessed it was about his offer. Ridge called it Steffy's offer. Ridge had thought about it, and to him, it made sense to get rid of Rick and give Steffy the life she wanted.\n\n\nRidge said that Steffy had never been happier than when she'd been with Liam, but Ridge asked why Liam wasn't jumping on the offer. Ridge was close to making the deal but insisted that Ridge and Steffy would run the business. Liam was fine as long as Ivy and Caroline weren't miserable at work. Liam was pumped about it, and he knew he could make it happen. Ridge said that it couldn't happen without Steffy's twenty-five percent stock ownership.\n\n\nLiam asked if Ridge was playing matchmaker. Ridge quipped that Liam's personal life wasn't Ridge's concern; however, Ridge needed something to benefit Steffy, and he was doing what he felt any other father would do. He wanted her to be comfortable and happy. Either Liam could provide that, or Ridge would endure the year with Rick.\n\n\nRidge said after a year, Eric would see that Rick couldn't run anything and would ship Rick off somewhere like to the basement or to Elba.  Ridge didn't want to wait a year, so he told Liam to make a move if Liam still had feelings for Steffy. Ridge said Liam could have his family back, but Ivy couldn't be in the picture. Ridge asked Liam to think about it and left.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "After the slap and with Brooke on the floor, Quinn tells her to stay away from Deacon. Brooke gnashes that it was one thing to slap her but another whole thing about knocking her vodka out of her hand. Wyatt thinks he and Deacon should head over to Brooke's as he is sure that is where Quinn went. Steffy tells Ridge she is only considering this takeover if Liam is part of the bargain. Liam is kissing Ivy and she quips that she is not even wearing a bikini. He says she just has that power over him. She muses that she knew he was committed to her but hearing him tell Steffy that meant a lot to her. He says there are a lot of what if's with Steffy and this proposal is tempting but he has Ivy and he wouldn't have it any other way. She just wishes being with her is not going to keep him from getting the shares he wants to make this takeover happen. Ridge tells Steffy that Rick will have a whole year to run FC and he is not sure he can stomach that. Bill can not have anything to do with this and they all need to be protected. He does not want her to get her hopes but says he might be open to it. Ridge says she and her brother are too far away and he'd like her to come back. She says everything has to fall in place for that to happen. He wants to go and talk to Liam and see just where his head is. Wyatt tells Deacon that his mother hears what she wants to hear. Deacon tells him that nothing happened at Brooke's, but Wyatt is not so sure about that. His states that his mother has not cared about another man since Bill and she is taking a big risk by allowing him in her life so do not cross her. Brooke says she is not trying to take Deacon away from Quinn but obviously Quinn believes that. Quinn finally says she does not know what got into her and tries to help Brooke up but Brooke yells at her not to touch her. She orders her out of her house and to never come back again. Quinn goes home and asks Deacon if he would ever leave her for her. Deacon says Brooke, of course not. He loves Quinn and would not leave her for anyone. Brooke pours another drink of vodka and cries. Ivy overhears Steffy tell someone on the phone that she might move back to L.A. You never can tell but if she does being with Liam is part of the package. Ridge goes to see Liam and says he is there because of Steffy's offer. It will give Steffy back the life she wanted. Is Liam going to jump on this? Quinn tells Deacon that she knows he thinks she is over-reacting and that Brooke is innocent but she had to knock some sense into her. She can put on her bathing suit and take any man to bed she wants but not Deacon. Ivy tells Steffy that Liam will not be coming back to her. Steffy says she would not be so sure. Her dad is with Liam as they speak and if they come to an agreement then Liam will be back with her and Ivy's little two months bonding won't mean a thing compared to what they have. Ridge tells Liam that he does not want to wait a year but he can with no help from Liam. But if he has some feelings for Steffy without Ivy being in the picture then this could all work so Liam needs to seriously think about it.",
