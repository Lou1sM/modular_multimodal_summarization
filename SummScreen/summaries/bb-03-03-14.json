    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Katie's house, Ridge received a call from Brooke, who was missing him while she was in Paris. She said that, since Wyatt had wound up being there, Hope and he could handle things on their own. Brooke planned to get home as soon as possible so that she and Ridge could start their life together.\n\n\nThe call ended, but Ridge received another one from Hope. Hope pressed him for an answer about him and Katie and forbade him to marry Brooke until he knew that Brooke was the one.\n\n\nKatie, who'd heard the end of the call, stated that Ridge would be married if she hadn't faked fainting at the wedding. She felt wrong about what they were doing and decided that it would be better if he left the house. Ridge didn't want to leave, but he didn't want to hurt Brooke, either. He hadn't wanted any of it to happen the way it had, but he said they had to deal with it.\n\n\nKatie decided that she needed some air, and Ridge asked if he could join her. She said she'd like that, but even though they had a lot to talk about, she didn't know what to say. Ridge didn't, either.\n\n\nWhile walking through the park with Ridge later, Katie expressed her guilt over what she'd pulled at the wedding. She called her actions underhanded; however, Ridge said it was done, and she should stop beating herself up about it. Katie didn't like feeling guilty and ashamed. Ridge felt the same feelings, but he told her that she knew it was about a lot more than those feelings.\n\n\nKatie changed the subject to how much Will loved to spend time with Ridge. Ridge assumed that Bill was a good father. She replied that Bill was a good father, but he wasn't patient. Katie didn't want to talk about Bill, who was in love with Brooke, and Ridge asked if Katie wanted Bill back. Katie didn't, but she also didn't want to cause her sister the same pain she'd endured.\n\n\nRidge asked what Katie did want, and frustrated, Katie walked off.  Ridge caught up to her, and she said she couldn't think about what she wanted. She suspected that people in the park thought that she and Ridge were a couple, which was something that she and Ridge never could be. He asked why that was, and she yelled that it wasn't real or right.\n\n\nRidge told Katie to forget the circumstances and just say how she felt. Katie refused to let herself think of being with him, and she told Ridge to give her one good reason that she was there with him instead of Brooke. \"Because I love you, Katie,\" he responded.\n\n\nAt the Forrester International office, Aly and Brooke worked, and Aly noted that Brooke missed Ridge. Brooke replied that it was hard, and she didn't want to be away from him \"now\" that she had him back. Brooke asked how things were for Aly in Paris and if Aly had met any friends. Aly indicated that things were going well, but she really didn't get along with people her age.\n\n\nBrooke frowned, and Aly changed the subject to what had happened at the wedding. Brooke said that during a poem recitation, Katie had passed out. After Brooke explained that Katie had wound up being okay, Aly guessed that Katie felt awful about ruining the ceremony. Brooke hoped that wasn't the case because, to her, it wasn't Katie's fault that they'd had to postpone the wedding.\n\n\nBrooke changed the topic to Aly's treatment of Wyatt. Though Brooke admired Aly's intelligence and tenacity, she thought Aly had been too harsh with him. Aly said she wasn't a fan of his, and she implored Brooke to see that the Fullers couldn't be trusted. Brooke said the Fullers and Forresters were in business together, and Wyatt really liked Hope.\n\n\nAly questioned Wyatt's feelings for Hope based upon what Wyatt had said to her about Hope. Brooke asked what that was, and Aly asked if Hope and Wyatt had really done anything on the plane. Brooke said that Wyatt and Hope were adults, but Aly asserted that it went against what Hope stood for. Brooke felt that it wasn't their business to judge.\n\n\nAly didn't want to hear anything more about it, and she decided to take a press packet to Hope, who needed it that night. Brooke gave Aly a keycard for Hope's hotel suite so that Aly could leave the packet inside in case Hope was out with Wyatt. Before Aly left, Brooke thanked her for being concerned about Hope. Brooke stated that Hope was a grown woman, though, and could take care of herself.\n\n\nAfter Aly had gone, Brooke looked at a picture of Ridge and recalled the day he'd returned to her after being away in Paris.  She grinned to herself.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Wyatt arrived in Hope's suite and complimented her silk robe. Hope said that she would have packed something sexier if she'd known he'd be there. Wyatt hoped he wasn't intruding on the girls' trip, but Hope said she was glad that he was there. She was glad that Brooke was, too.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Aly, and Wyatt reluctantly revealed that Aly had spoken to him again after the meeting. He said that Aly had dictated to him what he'd do in regards to Hope, and Aly had also tried to fire him. \"Right after she slapped me,\" Wyatt added, and Hope was stunned.\n\n\nHope said that Aly had crossed a lot of lines, and Wyatt called Aly crazy, aggressive, and territorial. Hope didn't think that was like Aly, who'd usually been sweet and quiet. He conveyed that Hope was lucky that Aly was fond of Hope -- \"or rather borderline obsessed;\" however, Aly had serious problems with him.\n\n\nHope wanted to attribute it to immaturity or the staunchness of Aly's beliefs.  Wyatt remarked that Aly was a \"shadow girl,\" always there and lurking. He added that Aly had called him \"Mr. Popular,\" and he didn't even feel that he was all that popular.\n\n\nHope joked about it, and she and Wyatt decided to stop letting their worry about Aly overtake the evening.  The two discussed going out for the evening, but as they passionately made out, they elected to stay in.\n\n\nLater, Aly arrived outside the suite and knocked on the door. Hope didn't answer, so Aly let herself in and heard Hope giggling in the bedroom. Aly opened the bedroom door and shrieked upon seeing Hope and Wyatt having sex on the bed. \"Stop! Oh, my God! Stop!\" Aly screamed. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke is anxious to leave Paris and return home to Ridge. Knowing that her mother\u2019s return to Los Angeles is rapidly approaching, Hope calls Ridge and Katie to tell them to hurry up and find out what is going on between them. Meanwhile, Katie and Ridge take another trip to the park where Ridge admits his true feelings of love to her. Wyatt tells a surprised Hope about his strange encounter with Aly. They begin to make love as Aly arrives to deliver work materials. Aly becomes alarmed to find Hope and Wyatt having sex.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge talks on the phone to Brooke and then Hope separately. Brooke tells him she is anxious to come back from Paris and marry him. Hope wants to make sure that he and Katie are using this time to decide how they feel. She will not let him marry her mother if he has divided feelings. Katie tells Ridge that they should not be doing this. He should be married to Brooke by now. He says it is happening though, and he doesn't want to be with Brooke. She says she needs some air and he asks if he might join her. She'd like that. They take a walk in their favorite spot, the park. Hope apologizes to Wyatt for having to go through that presentation that everyone loved except Aly and how she was so against it. He's not sure he should tell her but finally does. Aly came back later and really let him have it complete with a slap. It's clear she has some major anger management issues and is borderline obsessed over Hope. She's taking this Shadowgirl thing to a whole new level. Brooke politely tells Aly that she likes and respects her, but she thinks she went a little overboard in the meeting. Aly claims she does not like Wyatt. She begs Brooke to please make sure Hope doesn't get too involved with him. He and his mom are definitely wrong for FC. She starts to bring up what Wyatt told her about the mile high club, Brooke interrupts and says Hope is an adult now. This is none of their business. She can take care of herself. Aly needs to drop something off to Hope that she will need. Brooke gives her Hope's room keycard if Hope is out of the room. Wyatt convinces Hope to skip dinner out and just stay in their room instead. They are in the bedroom with clothes askew about to make love. Aly knocks on the door but when she gets no answer, she lets herself in. She leaves the envelope but then hears Hope giggle several times. Aly opens the bedroom door and screams for Wyatt to stop doing that. Katie tells Ridge they have to stop this. She wants one good reason why they should continue. He tells her he has one good reason. He loves her.",
