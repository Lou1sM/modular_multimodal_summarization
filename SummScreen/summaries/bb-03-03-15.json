Steffy confided that Liam understood that if she gave him her shares, it meant they would be running the company together as a couple -- just as her grandparents had -- because husband and wife teams had been the most successful in running the company.\n\n\nSteffy's phone rang, and it was Liam. He told her that he wanted to see her at his place. Steffy looked confident, and Ivy looked worried.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya admired her new necklace in the mirror, and Rick surprised her when he caught her checking out her reflection. She thanked him again for the gift. Rick said it had all been due to his father's support. Rick said it had been one of the best days of his life. He reminded Maya that the necklace had been very expensive.\n\n\nMaya said she was very proud of Rick because he had made amends and proved he was a team player in the earlier meeting at Forrester. \"I hope I was convincing,\" Rick said. Maya asked if he'd meant what he had said.\n\n\nRick professed that he had made the announcements at work in a calculated way. He added that he had been working on his interpersonal communication skills. Maya gushed that it was what made him a good CEO. Rick added that he was going to remain CEO.\n\n\nAly entered, and she had numerous bags. She reminded Rick and Maya that they had agreed to review her shoe line. Rick feigned that he remembered. Rick told Aly that it would be best if he had a martini and Maya had a glass of Champagne.\n\n\nAly agreed, and she paused, but then she realized that Rick expected her to get the drinks. Aly begrudgingly left to prepare the drinks, and Maya playfully swatted Rick for treating Aly like a servant.\n\n\nAly delivered the drinks. She pulled out a pair of shoes and started to discuss them, but Rick interrupted and grilled her about how many times she had shaken the martini. He chastised her because she had done it too many times, and Thorne should have instructed her in the art of martini making.\n\n\nAly apologized, and Rick said the shoes looked more like a discount line, but then he said he wanted to see them on. Aly suggested that Maya model them because she knew that Rick would like them on Maya. Maya declined because she had been on her feet all day. Rick suggested that Aly massage Maya's feet so she could model the shoes.\n\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Aly asked in shock. Maya said it was unnecessary, but Rick insisted. Aly massaged Maya's feet, and Maya looked embarrassed. Maya told Aly that she'd done enough. Maya looked impatiently at Rick.\n\n\nAt the Forrester offices, Ivy and Wyatt reviewed the jewelry line. Wyatt noted that Rick had approved an opal bracelet -- a surprise. Ivy agreed, but she seemed distracted. She said that Rick had been critical, but it had been approved.\n\n\nWyatt noted that Ivy seemed distant, and he asked what was wrong. Ivy explained that in order to take control of Forrester, Liam had to get back together with Steffy. \"He could have this entire company and his ex-wife,\" Ivy lamented.\n\n\nWyatt said he didn't believe that Liam would choose Steffy. Ivy reminded him about Liam and Steffy's history, but Wyatt reminded Ivy that Steffy was Liam's past, and he wanted to look toward the future. \"He started this project to protect you and Caroline -- the Spencer women -- that's how he referred to you,\" Wyatt said. Ivy left to visit Liam.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Steffy entered and said that her father had understood her conditions. Steffy wondered if Liam had agreed. \"Is that why you called me? Are you ready to take over Forrester Creations?\" Steffy cooed.\n\n\nSteffy reminded Liam that she'd left before because she couldn't handle it -- the loss of the baby. She had practically handed Liam over to Hope, but Hope hadn't appreciated what she had. Liam argued that Wyatt's mother had been a crazy interference, and Steffy understood that it hadn't been entirely Hope's fault.\n\n\nSteffy said she understood Liam had feelings for Ivy, but they couldn't compare with the feelings Liam had shared with Steffy. She wanted to pick up where they had left off. \"Ivy is very important,\" Liam said. Steffy interrupted that Forrester could be theirs if they did it together.\n\n\nLiam professed that the idea of running Forrester with her would feel good. Liam gushed that he had deeply loved Steffy. \"You know how much you mean to me,\" he said. He added that she was one of the smartest people he had ever met. He enjoyed the thought of working with her, living with her, and touching her again. He warmly touched her face. \"We would make it work this time,\" he said, \"but Ivy.\"\n\n\nLiam said he was committed to Ivy. Steffy was saddened. \"She better appreciate you. I don't blame you for giving that kangaroo a shot,\" Steffy said.\n\n\n\"What happens now?\" Liam asked. Steffy said she would return to Paris and watch from there. She'd watch the company from afar and see what happened. \"And wait. For now,\" Steffy said. Liam and Steffy hugged. \"Be happy,\" she told Liam. They hugged again, and Steffy left. Outside, Steffy paused and cried.\n\n\nLater, Ivy arrived at Liam's. Liam welcomed her, and she wondered if Steffy was still there. Liam teased that Steffy was gone and had not been hiding in her bikini. Ivy confessed that she had seen Steffy at Forrester, and Steffy had been very confident that she and Liam would reunite and run Forrester together.\n\n\nLiam stopped Ivy and told her that he had really wanted to take over Forrester but not at that cost. He had no plans to agree to Steffy's conditions. They hugged. Ivy was relieved. Liam was surprised that Ivy had been worried. \"We talked about this,\" he said.\n\n\nIvy agreed they had discussed it, but Steffy had been confident, and it had all made sense that Liam and Steffy would revisit their history. She marveled that Liam could have had it all. She wondered who could push Steffy aside. \"A man in love with someone else,\" Liam said. Ivy smiled.\n\n\n\"What I've discovered about myself is that I love my beauty with an accent,\" Liam teased. He added that he had wanted control of Forrester Creations for Caroline and Ivy. He didn't want to have it all if he didn't have Ivy.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy entered Wyatt's office, and Wyatt wondered what had happened with Liam. Steffy begrudgingly confessed that Liam had chosen to stay with Ivy. \"For now,\" Steffy said with a smirk.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Ivy that her dad is talking to Liam right now. And she is not turning over her stocks in FC unless Liam is part of the deal. He calls and says he saw Ridge and now needs to talk to her at his place. She agrees. Aly comes into the house and wants to talk her shoe line but Rick blows it off that he needs his martini first and for her to fix it and champagne for Maya. When she does that he even criticizes that she shook it too much and made it watery. Ivy is concerned and tells Wyatt that Liam is with Steffy right now. Steffy asks Liam if he is ready to take over FC with her. She hopes that is why he called her. She waxes poetic about her hitting her head on the bathtub and fell in love with him and then they were married. She only left him when she lost their child; he would be better off with her away but it wasn't. Hope Logan did not appreciate what she had with him. But she felt like Hope would come to her senses and she had no right to fight for him. She practically handed him to her and then Hope left him. She confesses if he were with Hope right now and happy she would back off. But with Ivy she sees no problem staking her claim against someone he has known about 5 minutes. It can not be compared to what they shared and they can have that back. Every time he tries to object she shushes him and says this can all be theirs. Wyatt tells Ivy do not count herself out even tho Liam has history with Steffy. He started this to help Ivy work better at FC without Rick's tactics. Liam tells Steffy that it would feel so good to be with her again and he thinks they could make it work and for the company too, but there is Ivy and he is committed to her. Steffy says Ivy better appreciate what she has. Liam says he loves Steffy but Steffy adds that he loves Ivy more at the moment and she would expect no less. She says she will go back to Paris and watch from afar what Rick is doing at FC and him and Ivy. They hug. She tells him to be happy. She takes a deep breath and cries as she leaves. Aly shows Rick and Maya her line but he is not impressed and calls them discount. But he's willing to give it a try if she massages Maya's feet and lets the lead model walk in them. Ivy goes back to Liam's and asks if all is okay. He says he really wants to take over FC but he will have to find another way. He can not give up on them and accept Steffy's offer. Rick takes great joy in watching and giving orders to Aly to massage Maya's feet. Steffy stops in and tells Wyatt that she is leaving. Wyatt says he works close with Ivy and she has confided in him, so he is glad Liam is staying with her. Ivy tells Liam that she could not have blamed him as he and Steffy do have history and were married and were going to have a family together. He says there is no having it all if he does not have her. He quips that he prefers his women with an accent. He makes her feel comfortable with his kiss.",
