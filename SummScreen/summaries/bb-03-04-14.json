Thorne asked for Brooke's opinion of Wyatt, and Brooke said that she liked Wyatt. Thorne asked about Liam, and Brooke replied that Hope and Wyatt's relationship had become too complicated.\n\n\nBrooke and Thorne discussed that since Wyatt had accompanied Hope to Paris, Brooke should return home and marry Ridge as she had planned. \"Again,\" Thorne teased. Thorne asked about Katie, and Brooke said that Katie had had a doctor check her out. Brooke added that Ridge had stayed in Los Angeles to take care of Katie.\n\n\nThorne told Brooke that Hope clearly hadn't needed any help in Paris. Thorne told Brooke to call the private Forrester jet and the pilot -- and Ridge. Brooke claimed they could stop off at the courthouse on their way to a honeymoon. She giggled that it didn't sound very romantic, but she couldn't wait to marry Ridge.\n\n\nAt Hope's hotel suite in Paris, Aly delivered papers for Hope and discovered that Hope was in bed with Wyatt. Aly shouted at both Hope and Wyatt. Aly shrieked that Wyatt had to keep his hands off of Hope. Wyatt and Aly shouted at each other. Hope tried to calm everyone, but Hope insisted that Aly had to step out of the bedroom.\n\n\nHope and Aly conversed outside the bedroom. Hope insisted that she and Wyatt were in love. Aly said that Wyatt was a liar and a thief. Aly continued to badmouth Wyatt and said that Wyatt had ruined Hope's image and the image of the line along with Hope's message.\n\n\nAly expected Hope to be an example for young women. Aly said that Hope had changed because of Wyatt. Aly reminded Hope that Quinn and Wyatt had ruined Hope's wedding and that Hope would have been married to Liam if Quinn hadn't been so conniving.

Hope said she was in a committed relationship, but Aly wouldn't let up on her disgust with Hope and Wyatt. Hope advised Aly to leave.\n\n\nOutside the suite, Aly recalled her first meeting with Hope and Wyatt where Wyatt had kissed Hope. Aly looked thoughtful. She pulled up a photo of Wyatt on her phone and used an app to set his head on fire. She smiled wickedly.\n\n\nInside the suite, Hope returned to Wyatt in the bedroom. Hope explained that she couldn't believe how upset Aly had been. Hope and Wyatt started to make out and fell back on the bed.\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, Ridge and Katie went for a walk in a park and discussed that they were glad they had time alone to figure out what to do about their feelings for one another.

Later, Ridge and Katie agreed they were in love. Ridge passionately kissed Katie. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Aly freaks out at the site of Wyatt and Hope in bed. Hope has to take Aly into the other room to calm her down. Aly takes her frustrations out on Hope. She believes that Wyatt is changing Hope and the message for her line. Hope tries to tell Aly that Wyatt makes her happy. At the park, Katie and Ridge hear music coming from an amphitheater and ask the musicians there to play a song for them. Their feelings for one another are apparent as they dance to the music. Katie finally admits her feelings for Ridge.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge sits with Katie in the park and says she asked him for one good reason. He meant it \u0096 he loves her. No one wants anybody to be hurt but Hope got Brooke out of town so they have time to work on it. Brooke tells Thorne that Aly was a little agitated over her concern for Hope. Thorne says as long as she is under control and she's not as negative as she was at the meeting. Is she still against Wyatt? Brooke says she explained that Hope is an adult and her choices are her own, not their business. She tells Thorne that she gave Aly the hotel key card and she is going to drop off a press package to Hope and leave. But Aly bursts into Hope's room and yells at her and Wyatt. She keeps telling him to get off of Hope and get out of here right now. Liam would never treat her like this. Hope tells her to calm down; everyone is all right. She puts her robe on and tries to quiet Aly by steering her into the living room and let Wyatt stay in the bedroom. Aly is agitated and keeps saying she can not believe this; Wyatt was in her bed. Hope says he is in her room because he was invited. He is her boyfriend now. Aly says Wyatt wants everyone to know. He does not respect Hope. Hope tells Aly that she has no idea where this is coming from, but she can not barge in here and start screaming. It's inappropriate. Aly says she is trying to help Hope. Hope tells her that she doesn't need to; everything is fine. And if she has problems with Wyatt then she needs to get over it. Aly is shocked and asks if this is how she wants people to see her now like all the other internet celebrities half naked, raunchy and vulgar. She has to think about how this looks. She's supposed to be an example. She believes in her message. She started a HFTF club in her school. People called her a nerd, but she thought it was important. Now it seems it doesn't matter to Hope anymore. Hope says yes it does matter but the focus on the line has changed some. Aly says it is Hope that had changed and all because of Wyatt. He and his mother are not trustworthy; they will do whatever they can to get what they want. They ruined Liam's life and they will ruin Hope's too. They don't care what they have to do or how low they have to stoop. Wyatt has put his clothes on and is listening on the other side of the door slightly ajar. Hope tells Aly that she knows she wants to protect her image. And she knows Aly has gotten closer to Liam so she may want Hope with him. Aly says or just alone, but anybody but Wyatt. He is no good for her. He's a liar. Hope wants her to take that back. Aly says he is a liar and if Hope denies it then she is a liar too. She says Hope does not deceive people. She lifts them up and inspires them. She told them to wait for a ring and be sure you are in a committed relationship. Hope explains that she still believes that. Her values have not changed and she is not promoting promiscuity. She tells Aly that Aly told her she was bullied in high school and that must have hurt and she is sorry. But that is sort of how Hope is feeling with Aly standing there and saying all those things against her and Wyatt. Aly shouts that Wyatt is the bully, not her. Hope says Wyatt is the man she has chosen to be with. Aly says only because his mother tricked her. Hope says no; she is with Wyatt because she loves him. They are not engaged but it is serious. Aly refuses to see. She says Hope loves Liam; she always has and they would be married right now if not for Quinn. She doesn't see why Hope can not see that. Hope says they did not manipulate her. She was the one who decided she was not ready for marriage. She and Wyatt are dating. They are enjoying their time together; that's it. Aly continues that Wyatt is mean. He's disrespectful to Liam and a smart aleck to Aly. She doesn't like him. Hope tells her that she is sorry she feels that way. She hopes in time once Aly knows Wyatt that she will change her opinion of him. In the meantime she thinks Aly should leave. Thorne asks about Katie and Brooke says she is fine. No more fainting spells. And one more minute that day and Brooke would have been married. So that was disappointing. She has spoken to Ridge and he wants her to come home. And while Hope keeps saying she wants her here in Paris she can not find out one good reason why. Thorne tells her that Wyatt seems to have everything under control over promotions so Brooke can just go home and plan another wedding. He'll explain to Hope. Outside Hope's room, Aly gets her phone with app and pulls up Wyatt's pictures, hits a button and his head is in flames ..her with a smirking look on her face. Wyatt asks Hope is she is alone. She says yes, Aly left. He reminds her where they were before interrupted. They kiss and he backs her to the bed. Ridge and Katie listen to some musicians in the park and even dance a little. They sit on a bench and Ridge kisses her.",
