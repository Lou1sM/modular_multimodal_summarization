    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's, she flashed back to when Quinn had visited her the previous day. Brooke remembered that Quinn had warned her to stay away from Deacon and then slapped her. Brooke remembered falling to the floor.\n\n\nA knock at the door interrupted Brooke's flashback, and she discovered that Deacon was at the door. \"You're back?\" Brooke asked. Deacon said they needed to discuss what had happened the previous day when Deacon had found a very drunk Brooke at the restaurant and driven her home. \"We need to talk about what happened,\" Deacon said. Brooke scowled.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Brooke remembered what had happened, and Brooke replied that she didn't black out when she drank. \"I remember you kissed me,\" Brooke confessed. Deacon remembered that they'd kissed each other, but Brooke maintained that he had caught her by surprise.\n\n\nDeacon said they remembered the day differently. \"You dazzle me. You always have,\" he said. He added that Brooke represented the ideal woman to him, but he realized they could never recapture their shining moments. \"I found Quinn, and I'm committed to her,\" Deacon admitted.\n\n\nDeacon said that Brooke would always have a piece of his heart. Brooke acknowledged that Deacon wanted her to understand that he loved Quinn. Brooke advised him to have the conversation with Quinn because Quinn had been insecure. Brooke didn't stop there.\n\n\n\"You've hooked up with a whack job,\" Brooke said. Brooke related the entire encounter with Quinn for Deacon. She advised Deacon that Quinn packed quite a punch and had knocked her to the floor but later apologized. Deacon looked sick and shook his head. Brooke advised Deacon to be careful because Quinn was crazy. Deacon silently left.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Wyatt arrived and wondered why Quinn had summoned him. \"What did you do now, Mom? Let's hear it,\" he said. Quinn stammered but finally confessed that she'd gone to Brooke's and \"set her straight. I slapped her,\" Quinn admitted.\n\n\n\"You what?\" Wyatt exclaimed. Quinn tried to defend herself -- that she was upset because Brooke had been \"parading around in her bathing suit and busting out her moves. Brooke is a man predator,\" Quinn dished.\n\n\nQuinn maintained that Brooke had wanted Deacon in her bed. Wyatt mocked Quinn's concern for \"protecting poor defenseless Deacon.\" Quinn blamed Brooke for stealing Bill, and she worried that Brooke would steal Deacon, as well.\n\n\nWyatt shouted at Quinn that a slap went too far and that it would damage her relationship with Deacon when Brooke told him about it. Wyatt warned that Brooke would be only too happy to tell Deacon. Wyatt reminded his mother that Brooke hated Quinn and blamed her for ruining Hope's life.\n\n\nQuinn defended herself and said that she had apologized to Brooke for the incident. \"You better hope your boyfriend sees it that way,\" Wyatt said. Wyatt shook his head and left.\n\n\nAt Liam's, he awakened next to Ivy and smiled. Ivy awakened, and Liam said that she was beautiful awake or asleep. Ivy smiled, and they kissed. She said she'd never been the kind of person to stay in bed all day, but she could easily see herself \"burrowing\" all day with him.\n\n\nLiam laughed and said they should hide away for the day or at least until someone needed them. Ivy said she'd be happy with a few hours away from work. Liam agreed, and he noted that things had a way of working out.\n\n\nIvy acknowledged that a lot of other women wanted Liam, and Ivy was grateful that Liam had chosen her because he could have had everything with Steffy. \"Everything feels like nothing if it means losing you,\" he said.\n\n\nIvy questioned why Steffy would basically blackmail him to join in the takeover. Liam maintained it was classic Steffy. He said Steffy needed time to adjust to the new reality. He added that the Forrester takeover would happen, but he wasn't going to lose Ivy over it. Ivy kissed Liam passionately. Later, Liam returned with breakfast in bed. Ivy was grateful, and Liam fed her strawberries.\n\n\nAt Ridge's loft, Steffy visited Ridge. She told him that she loved Liam. \"If I could change one thing about our recent history, I'd have never left,\" she said. Ridge consoled her and said that he understood she'd needed time alone to heal. Steffy admitted that she had learned that she'd risked losing what was important. \"The world doesn't stop\" because she'd needed a break.\n\n\nSteffy said she didn't want to work on the takeover because she wouldn't torture herself watching Liam fall deeper in love with Ivy. \"I get it,\" Ridge said. Ridge hugged her. Steffy walked around the apartment and noted that the place \"had a nice vibe.\" She looked at the paintings Ridge had done. \"Caroline, I'm assuming. Nude?\" Steffy said in a disapproving voice.\n\n\nRidge teased that Caroline was \"artfully draped.\" Steffy maintained that Ridge was experiencing a midlife crisis or infatuation. Ridge disagreed and said it was much more than that. Steffy said it was inappropriate.\n\n\nRidge refused to defend himself. He said that Caroline was a grown woman who could make grownup decisions -- just like Steffy. He said he was sorry his relationship made her uncomfortable, but Caroline made him happy.\n\n\nCaroline entered. Caroline noticed Steffy and said she could return later, but Ridge invited her in. Steffy greeted her in derogatory tone. Ridge hugged Caroline, and Steffy rolled her eyes. \"A united front,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nCaroline acknowledged that Steffy had \"reservations\" about her dad and Caroline's relationship. Caroline assured Steffy that it was \"not just some casual thing.\"\n\n\nSteffy countered that Caroline had married -- and was still married to -- Rick. Caroline said that Rick had ended their marriage. Ridge interrupted that they were not going to argue about their relationship. Steffy anticipated that her opinion would matter, but Ridge said that his happiness should matter, and Caroline made him happy. \"I see. Okay, then. I want you to be happy,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nSteffy said she had a plane to catch. She kissed her dad goodbye and said, \"Caroline,\" in a demeaning tone. \"Safe travels,\" Caroline responded. After Steffy had left, Caroline joked, \"That went well.\" \"We'll see,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Deacon returned after he'd been to Brooke's. \"What the hell is the matter with you?\" Deacon asked. Quinn blasted Brooke for tattling and exaggerating what had happened, but Deacon angrily told Quinn that she had a disconnect.\n\n\nDeacon worried that she had been violent and gone beyond limits. He told her she was crazy, beautiful, intelligent, and sexy. \"Baby, you don't have to be insecure like this and decking people,\" he said.\n\n\nDeacon added that Brooke and Hope were important to him, and Quinn kept irritating them. \"I screwed up yet again,\" Quinn admitted. She encouraged Deacon to head out the door and never return. Quinn looked away. She looked back and noticed that Deacon had remained. \"Why are you still here?\" she asked. Deacon pulled a box from his pocket and held out a diamond ring. \"You're nuts. You drive me nuts. God help me, I want to marry you,\" Deacon said.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Fresh from her conversation with Liam, Steffy pays a visit to Ridge to inform him about what she has planned for her future. Quinn regretfully confesses to Wyatt about the unfortunate run-in that she had with Brooke. Wyatt suggests that Quinn tell Deacon about the encounter before Brooke does. While Brooke and Deacon differ over who kissed whom, she informs him about the side of Quinn that he is not familiar with. Liam has disappointing news for Ivy.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke opens the door to Deacon. He says they need to talk about what happened. He asks if she remembers the kiss. She says yes, she does not black out when she drinks. She knows he kissed her and she did not pull away because it happened so quickly and with no notice. Deacon tells Brooke that she will always have a little piece of his heart but he's with Quinn now. He is committed to her. Brooke says he really needs to be telling this to Quinn as she seems a little insecure right now. She tells him about the slap. She warns Deacon that he better think long and hard before he gets in too deep with Quinn and her craziness. Wyatt goes to Quinn's at her request. She says she needed him as she needed to talk to someone who knows how she is wired. Pointblank he asks what did she do now. He's appalled when she admits she slapped Brooke. She rants that she was upset. Deacon had driven Brooke home and before you know it she was parading around in her bathing suit, yet she did not want a swim party. Everybody knows she is a man predator and she wanted him in her bed. He quips then she must have been defending poor helpless Deacon's honor. She fires back that Brooke already stole Bill away from her and she was not going to let her do the same with Deacon. She admits the slap went a little too far and she is only afraid what will happen when Deacon finds out. Wyatt says she won't have to tell him as Brooke will be only too happy to do that. Quinn bellows at Wyatt to stop yelling at her. She knows she has some anger control problems but she is working on that. And this was only one incident. Wyatt says good; he only hopes her boyfriend sees it that way. Liam and Ivy lay in bed. He wakes her with a kiss and she says she likes waking up with him. Steffy stops by Ridge's loft and he says she can not go back to Paris as she just got there. She muses that if there was anything about their recent history with Liam she never would have left, but it's ancient history now. The world doesn't stop when you need time out and she lost something important. She tells Ridge there is not going to be a takeover now so there is no reason for her to stay in L.A. She is not going to sit around and watch Liam fall deeper in love with Ivy. She did that once before and that won't happen again. She changes the subject and asks what is he doing. Is Caroline a mid-life crisis or infatuation. He tries to explain that it is much more than that. Steffy tells him it is inappropriate as Caroline is her age. He counters that Caroline is a grown woman and just like Steffy she makes grown up decisions. He says he is sorry that his relationship upsets her but there is nothing he can do about that. At that moment Caroline lets herself in. she is civil; Steffy is frosty. Ridge tells her that he is not going to defend his relationship and neither is Caroline. He would hope that Steffy wanted her dad to be happy and she finally admits that she does. She gives him a quick semi hug and leaves. Deacon goes home and asks Quinn what the hell did she do. Quinn says sounds like Brooke wasted no time in ratting her out. Deacon barks that for heaven's sake, she barged in Brooke's house and knocked her to the ground. She is lucky that Brooke didn't call the police and have her arrested for assault. He wants to know when the craziness between her ears and being normal kicks in. Quinn defends by saying Brooke thinks she can have anything she wants and she wanted her to know that he was off limits. He states again that she is beautiful and talented and sexy as hell. And he is living with her so all of this is unnecessary. She doesn't have to be this insecure to go around decking people. Hope and her mother are very important to him and they do not deserve Quinn wrecking havoc in their lives. She hollers back that he is right. She is a terrible person, a nutcase and he should just get out right now. He can save himself future embarrassment by leaving now and never coming back. But when she looks around he has a ring box in his hand. He says she is nuts and she drives him nuts but he wants to marry her.",
