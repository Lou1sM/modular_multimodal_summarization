Worried, Dante went into Felicia's bedroom and saw her lying in bed. She wanted to talk to Dante about Dominick's future. Felicia begged him one last time to let Nick and Bridget raise Dominick. Dante refused.\n\n\nDante told Felicia that Bridget had left Nick because she knew Nick would always love Brooke more than her. Felicia was surprised to hear that because she'd thought Brooke and Ridge were getting married. Dante told her Nick was going to stop the wedding. Dante said it did not matter who Brooke chose -- all that really mattered was that Bridget was determined to be a mother to Dominick.\n\n\nFelicia showed Dante papers that she'd had drawn up making him and Bridget the legal guardians of Dominick. Dante thanked her and reassured her that he intended to give Dominick a wonderful life. He hoped that one day he and Bridget would be living together, raising Dominick. He promised her he would always love Dominick and care for him. Felicia thanked him and passed out.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Brooke's, everyone was anxious to find out what was going on upstairs with Brooke and her men. Massimo attempted to go upstairs to find out, but Jackie stopped him.\n\n\nUpstairs in one of Brooke's guestrooms, Stephanie told Bridget she had done the right thing, and Eric tried to comfort his daughter. Bridget said she knew she had done the right thing because Nick could never love her the way she deserved to be loved.\n\n\nUpstairs in Brooke's bedroom, Brooke said she could not believe what was happening. She'd thought everything was settled with Nick and Bridget, and Nick had promised her he would stay with Bridget. Nick reminded Brooke it had been Bridget's decision to end things. Nick told Ridge he should go downstairs and tell everyone the wedding was off. Ridge refused, saying Brooke would never have gone through with the wedding if she had not wanted to marry him.\n\n\nDownstairs, Sally commented that Forrester weddings never disappointed and asked if anyone wanted to wager on who would be Brooke's next groom. While everyone was discussing that, Bridget walked down and informed them that the wedding was off. Massimo was irate. Bridget told him it was not Nick's fault; she had decided to end her marriage. Bridget said Nick's heart was with Brooke, and that was what he was telling her upstairs. Massimo did not want to believe her and rushed upstairs to stop Nick.\n\n\nBack in Brooke's bedroom, Brooke told Nick that Ridge was truly sorry for all the pain he had caused her. Ridge told Nick that Brooke was the woman he was meant to spend his life with. Nick demanded to know where all of Ridge's love for Brooke had been when he'd walked out on her. Nick said Brooke and the kids deserved to be in a family with stability, where the rug would not be pulled out from under them on a whim. Ridge asked where all Nick's ideals on commitment had been when he'd been with Bridget.\n\n\nWhile Nick and Ridge continued to argue, Massimo barged in, telling Nick to \"get the hell out.\" He did not understand how Nick could do that to his brother. Nick told him to stay out of it. Nick said he'd married Bridget because of a child, and he was not going to let Brooke make the same mistake. Massimo was disgusted by the situation and said it was incest for brothers, fathers, and sons to all be fighting for the same woman. Massimo was determined to not let the Marone name be disgraced like the Forrester name had been.\n\n\nWhile Massimo argued with Nick, Stephanie managed to get Brooke alone in another bedroom. She told Brooke they were on the same side. She said Ridge was Brooke's second choice, and everyone knew it. Stephanie said it would never work with Ridge; he would just continue to disappoint her. She told Brooke to get over her obsession with the Forrester men and follow her heart, which would lead her to Nick.\n\n\nAs Stephanie continued trying to convince Brooke to be with Nick, Ridge and Nick walked in. Ridge told Stephanie to leave if she could not support his relationship with Brooke. Ridge did not care if Stephanie or Nick supported the relationship, all he cared about was how Brooke felt. Ridge asked Brooke if she wanted a life with him. When Brooke hesitated, Stephanie told her to put everyone out of their misery by choosing one of them.\n\n\n",
