    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Katie's house, Ridge arrived -- even though Katie had advised him not to be there that morning. Ridge thought that he should be the one to talk to Brooke, but Katie replied that she was a big girl. He insisted that it was about a decision he'd made, but Katie said she'd made it, too.\n\n\nKatie stated that love didn't make sense, and it didn't have to. She figured that if anyone understood that, it would be Brooke. Katie admitted that she was afraid to confess that she'd done the same thing that she'd accused Brooke of. Ridge said Katie wasn't guilty; their feelings had just changed.\n\n\nKatie told Ridge that she'd stopped the wedding, and Ridge replied that he was glad. Katie feared that it would be a disaster, but he figure that it had to be done. He hugged her and left.\n\n\nOn the jet ride home from Paris, Brooke rested on a bed and dreamed that Ridge was beside her. She said to him that she'd be home soon.\n\n\nElsewhere on the jet, Wyatt was relieved that Aly was sitting in the pilot's jump seat instead of in the main cabin with him and Hope. The worried Hope revealed to Wyatt what Katie had done at Brooke's wedding. Wyatt didn't know what kind of person would deliberately do that to her sister.\n\n\nHope tried to defend Katie, who normally wasn't that kind of person. Hope said the last thing she'd expected was for Katie to fall in love with Ridge. Wyatt was shocked to hear the revelation and wondered what had happened to Ridge's commitment to Brooke.\n\n\nHope said it had been that way all her life. Ridge had tried to maintain his commitment to Brooke but also his commitment to Taylor and her children. \"And then he'd be gone,\" Hope said.\n\n\nHope explained that Ridge would marry Taylor for a year or two, but he'd return to Brooke. Because Hope hadn't wanted her mother to go through that again, Hope had taken Brooke to Paris to give Katie and Ridge time to figure out what they wanted. Hope had expected Ridge and Katie to \"come to their senses,\" but they'd decided to be together.\n\n\nHope believed she should have stayed out of it, and she wondered if it would have been better for Brooke to have had Ridge for a week than not at all.\n\n\nLater, Brooke entered the cabin from the other compartment. The jet had begun its descent, and she was eager to contact the county clerk's office to get her wedding scheduled. She asked if Hope and Wyatt wanted to witness the vows, but they said they didn't know what their days would hold.\n\n\nBrooke agreed, remarking that Katie wanted to see her right away. Hope asked if Brooke knew why that was. Brooke didn't know, but it made her feel sisterly again. She guessed Katie was making breakfast for her. Grinning, Brooke decided that the county clerk could wait a few hours.\n\n\nLater at Forrester, Ridge was ripping up designs in the CEO's office. Hope entered. She'd figured that Ridge would be at Katie's, but he said Katie had wanted to see Brooke alone. Hope thought that was convenient for him because he could avoid the brunt of the pain he was causing.\n\n\nHope asked why Ridge couldn't go back in time and remember his love for Brooke. He wondered if Hope knew how it felt to want something for so long that she'd forgotten why she'd even wanted it. He asked her to imagine that the thing had finally arrived; however, something had shifted, and she no longer wanted it. Saddened, Hope revealed that she'd known the feeling.\n\n\nHope noted that Katie had said that Ridge and Katie were in love, but Hope asked how they could know that so soon. Ridge said he'd known Katie a long time, but Hope questioned how well he knew Katie, whom he hadn't even been around for the past year.\n\n\nHope stated that Katie hadn't been the innocent person that she'd made herself out to be in the Brooke and Bill saga, and none of it would have happened if it hadn't been for Taylor's vendetta against Brooke. Hope said Katie and Bill would still be together, and they hadn't been \"so horribly matched.\"\n\n\nRidge called Bill a terrible person, but Hope asked how Ridge's actions differed from Bill's. Ridge was curious to hear what he'd done to be like Bill. Hope said Ridge was trading in his wife for his wife's sister. Ridge declared that Brooke wasn't his wife, and he hadn't had an affair behind Brooke's back. Hope cynically guessed that Ridge had been bad, but \"not as bad\" as Brooke and Bill.\n\n\nHope noted that Ridge had agonized over whether he could love Brooke after what she'd done to her sister, but he was condoning Katie's actions, which were exactly the same. Hope figured that he saw it as different because Katie had placed Ridge back into the triangle scenario he was accustomed to.\n\n\nRidge denied it. He said he was trying to be a better man, but all Hope saw was a clown trying to figure out what a better man was. He felt that Stephanie wouldn't have approved of Brooke and Bill's actions, and she would have seen a better man in her son. Ridge asked Hope not to talk about Katie, who'd relentlessly tried to put him and Brooke together until it had gone beyond her control.\n\n\nBack at Katie's house, a perky Brooke arrived. She wanted to know what the doctors had said about Katie's condition. Katie said they needed to talk about that. Brooke asked if Ridge had stayed with Katie, but Katie swore that Ridge had never spent a night in that house. Brooke was upset that Ridge hadn't watched Katie as promised, but Katie stated that he'd been by every day.\n\n\nKatie said that Ridge had known something that no one else had -- that there had been nothing wrong with her at the wedding. Brooke replied that she'd known that, and everyone was grateful for it. Katie revealed that what Brooke thought had happened hadn't really happened.\n\n\nBrooke asked Katie to stop feeling guilty about what had happened at the wedding. Brooke wanted them to just be happy and honest with each other. Brooke had something to ask Katie and stated that Katie could decline the request. Brooke needed a witness for a courthouse wedding, and she asked if Katie would help Brooke and Ridge finish what they'd started.\n\n\nKatie sighed, and Brooke assured Katie that someday a man would enter her life and love her. Katie asked what Brooke would say if that had already happened. Brooke became ecstatic and asked if the man was Bill. Katie declared that it wasn't and added that it was a man she would trust. Brooke said she wanted Katie to be happy, and Brooke asked if she knew him.\n\n\nKatie stated that Brooke did. Katie said that she and Brooke had been through a lot, and she'd never wanted to hurt Brooke. Brooke apologized for hurting Katie, and Katie said she believed Brooke was sorry. Brooke asked who the lucky man was, and Katie repeated that she loved Brooke.\n\n\nKatie conveyed that she'd feared she'd never be able to let a man love her or see her for who she was. She hoped that Brooke would understand and one day be happy for Katie. Brooke insisted that she would be and asked who the man was. \"It's Ridge. I'm in love with Ridge,\" Katie replied. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "On the way home from Paris, Hope confides in Wyatt that she purposely left Katie and Ridge home alone to figure out their feelings. On the plane, Brooke asks Wyatt and Hope to be her wedding witnesses. Katie prepares herself to tell Brooke that she and Ridge are in love. At the Forrester office, Hope confronts Ridge about leaving his family and Brooke the way Bill did with Katie. Brooke arrives at Katie\u2019s house thinking they will be having breakfast.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge uses his key and lets himself in at Katie's. He tells her the key works. She tells him yes but she thought he was going to stay away today since Brooke was coming and she wanted to talk to her first. She doesn't know yet what she will say to her. He insists that he still wishes he could talk to Brooke first. Katie says no, she is a big girl and she will not hide behind him. She says Brooke may never understand it but love doesn't have to make sense. And if anyone understands that, it would be Brooke. Brooke is napping on the plane and thinking of Ridge and telling him that she is hurrying home as fast as she can. Hope checks in on her. She comes back and tells Wyatt that she thinks she might have done a terrible thing. She starts by saying that Katie did not faint at her mom's wedding. She actually stopped the wedding because she is in love with Ridge. She swears Wyatt to secrecy. He says of course as no one would believe him anyway. She says she could not see her mom get hurt by Ridge again so she arranged for her to go to Paris with them. This would give Katie and Ridge time to sort out their feelings. She thought they would come to their senses but found out last night that they do want a future together. Wyatt says that is not her fault. She says she knows but she wonders if maybe it would have been best for her to stay out of it and let Brooke have him for a week rather than nothing at all. She is going to be heartbroken. When Brooke joins them in the cabin they tell her Aly is in the cockpit with the pilot. It's better this way. Brooke wants to start making plans, forget the big wedding, just go to the courthouse and fill out a few papers, get a witness and be married. She asks if they would like to be her witnesses and they both make a quick excuse of why they can't commit right now. Brooke says okay, one thing at a time. First Katie wants to talk to her and that feels good to get things back on track. Ridge starts to leave and wants to be sure Katie doesn't want him there with Brooke. Katie says no as it would be like Brooke in a strait jacket. She is never the same with Ridge around. She admits to Ridge that she is scared. She is about to tell her sister that she is guilty of things she has accused Brooke of. He says she is not guilty of anything and all they have to do is admit their feelings have changed. Even at the end of the day and it is a disaster, it just has to be done. Back at the office, Hope walks in. She says it works out well for Ridge as he won't get the brunt of the shock and pain this will cause Brooke. She wants to know what happened. He says he has played it around in his mind and he doesn't know what happened. He tries to make an analogy. He asks Hope if she has ever wanted something so badly and for so long that you don't remember ever not wanting it. And finally that day is there and it's yours but something inside you has changed, it's shifted. And that thing you have wanted for so long, you just don't want it anymore. Hope reflects and admits that yes she has felt that too. But she is still amazed that this happened so fast so how does Ridge know for sure that he loves Katie. And she does tell him that as much as she loves her Aunt Katie, she is not the innocent victim that she is making herself out to be. And if it weren't for Taylor's vendetta against Brooke, Bill and Katie would still be together and it wasn't that bad a match. She can agree that Bill can be a terrible person but he hasn't done any worse now that what Ridge is doing. He asks just how he is like Bill Spenser. Hope says he is trading in his wife for a sister. What Bill and Brooke did, he can not look at her the same way anymore. Hope surmises that to mean that what they both did was bad, but what her mom did was worse. And yet Katie is doing almost the exact same thing and it's Ridge in the middle of two women again. Maybe that is more acceptable to his ethics. He says all he knows was that he stayed away a year to try and be a better man. But he came back and now to her he is just a clown trying to figure out what a better man would do. He relied on his mom the same way that Hope does. But he can not ask her what she thinks anymore. But he thinks she would have had words for Bill and Brooke and she would have thought he was the better man and said enough is enough. Ridge asks Hope to not talk about Katie. She really did try to get Ridge and Brooke back together until she couldn't any more. That's just life. It's like driving a car with the steering wheel ripped from your hands and all you can do is sit back and hope no one is hurt too badly. Brooke visits Katie and wants to hear everything the doctor has told her. Katie says she is fine. Ridge did not even have to stay with her that first 24 hours that he promised he would, but he did come by every day. Ridge also knew something that she and Dr. Patrick didn't know. There was nothing wrong with her. Brooke tells her not to feel guilty about the wedding. She is just glad they can now talk openly and honestly about everything. And she knows someday a man will come along and Katie will fall head over heels. Brooke is stunned when Katie says that has already happened. Brooke is filled with glee and starts questioning Katie as to who it is. She wants to hear everything. Katie starts slowly and says at the end of the day they are sisters and she would never want to hurt her. She loves her and she hopes someday she will understand. She says it is Ridge. She is in love with Ridge. That does not compute with Brooke.",
