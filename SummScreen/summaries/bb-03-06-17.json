    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Sally couldn't find one good word online about her business after Jarrett's article had blasted them. Saul wished they'd held off on the preview, but she said time was the enemy unless there was a miracle. Shirley said she spelled miracle \"C-O-C-O.\"\n\n\nSally wasn't thrilled about poaching designs and returning to being a knockoff shop. Saul had heard Coco clearly, and stealing designs wasn't who Coco was. Sally argued that it wasn't who any of them were, but Shifty would knock on the door soon. Saul said they couldn't make Coco steal. Shirley asked if Sally wanted to disappoint her great aunt before it even started.\n\n\nSally didn't know if they had a choice after Jarrett's review, and she refused to use her little sister if Coco was adamant about not stealing. Shirley replied that there was \"using,\" and there was being used without knowing it. Saul guessed it had to do with a job Shirley had had him do.\n\n\nShirley beamed that Saul happened to be a techie. Saul replied that she'd told him that what she'd had him do had been for security. \"Job security,\" Shirley replied, and Sally asked what was going on. Shirley explained that they could plant devices on Coco without her knowing it, and Coco would be their unwitting spy. Sally clearly didn't like taking such an action, but she admitted that it might work. The three stacked their hands in the center of their circle of agreement.\n\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Steffy entered and groaned about how many times she had to tell her brother that it wasn't a locker room. As Thomas pulled on a shirt, he advised her to knock. Steffy began talking about her destination wedding and asked if he'd go to Australia.\n\n\nThomas asked if Steffy wanted him to go. Steffy wanted her brother to be a part of it and implored him to go. He figured that someone had to stay back and run the company. She claimed Rick would do it, and Thomas asked if Rick would be designing, too. Thomas figured they should hire an inexperienced team off the streets to run the company in their stead.\n\n\nSteffy gleaned that Thomas' attitude had to do with the tension between them. She asked him to go to the wedding again, and he said he'd think about it. He asked who'd attend the event. Steffy remarked that Ivy would be there. Ivy had been helping Steffy out a lot, and they'd gotten closer, according to Steffy. Steffy said Brooke and Ridge would elope there, too.\n\n\nThomas replied that it was good to know. Apologizing, Steffy told him to act surprised when the pair announced it. He figured Eric would go with Quinn, who was the reason Steffy had her position. Steffy rolled her eyes, and Thomas asked about Bill. She replied that Liam's father would go, of course. When Thomas asked about Liam's brother, Steffy replied that Wyatt wouldn't be there, for obvious reasons. She said that was it, and Thomas repeated that he'd let her know his decision about it.\n\n\nSteffy was glad not to have to worry about Sally Spectra crashing the wedding to pull a publicity stunt. Steffy figured that Sally should have been more focused on designing. Steffy grinned, reveling in the memory of Jarret's review, but Thomas hopped to Sally's defense. Steffy asked if Sally would close the business. He figured it would happen if Spectra defaulted on their loans. He said a developer was waiting for it to fold so the developer could move in on the building.\n\n\nThomas told Steffy that Sally had a little sister named Coco. Steffy couldn't care less about the info, but he asked if that would change if he said Coco was the new Forrester intern. Steffy got upset, but he insisted that Coco was smart and sharp. Steffy believed Coco was one in a long line of thieves, but Thomas said that type of thing was long in the past.\n\n\nThomas believed in Coco, but Steffy believed Coco would funnel designs to the enemy. Thomas said Spectra was on life support, and Rick had already grilled Coco. Thomas added that someone else was also impressed with Coco -- R.J. Steffy mirthlessly replied that it was great.\n\n\nThomas started to say something about Spectras being born without silver spoons, but Steffy interjected that it was more like plastic spoons. Thomas continued that it didn't mean they lacked talent, and he believed Coco had potential. Steffy didn't like the risk. He claimed it was the past. \"Besides, I made the decision,\" he said.\n\n\nSteffy said Thomas had done it to appease Coco's sister. Thomas figured that Steffy's issue was that he'd decided without Steffy's approval. Steffy told him not to go there. It wasn't about his judgment. She said she, not he, was the one Sally Spectra chose to harass. Steffy told him that Coco could stay, but any fallout would be on Thomas' head.\n\n\nIn the backstage area, R.J. ended Coco's tour of the building. He'd shown her everything but the stream room because he liked to keep his tours G-rated. He let her know they had to do some sorting of a big shipment. Coco was up for it and to learn as much as she could. He asked what she'd learned. She replied that one should avoid the steam room, \"and how nice the Forresters are.\" The two grinned at each other.\n\n\nR.J. got to work out front, and Coco sorted items behind some clothes racks. Brooke and Ridge arrived after a late breakfast. They reminded R.J. that Steffy was getting married in Australia. R.J wished he could go, but he didn't want to miss school during midterms. He added that he was also in charge of interns. Brooke announced that Ridge and she would elope in Australia, too.\n\n\nR.J. was ecstatic. He hugged them, and Coco grinned behind the clothes rack as she listened. R.J. was proud of his father for reuniting the family and asked what the plan was. Ridge and Brooke explained that they'd do something private, away from the others. \"So no one can derail it,\" R.J. deduced. Brooke didn't want R.J. to feel cheated by the elopement. R.J. wasn't upset. \"I got midterms and taking care of everyone,\" he said.\n\n\nCoco sneezed, and Ridge asked who was there. R.J. invited Coco into the open for introductions. Ridge extended his hand but retracted it when he heard the name Coco Spectra. Coco revealed that she was Sally's sister, and Ridge asked if it was the same Sally who'd crashed Nicole's wedding and had smeared cake all over Steffy for press time.\n\n\nR.J. asked Ridge told hold on, but Ridge told him to hold on. Ridge wanted to know how the internship had happened without his approval. R.J. indicated that Thomas and Rick had signed off on it. Ridge believed they should have known better and told Coco to get her stuff because she had to leave.\n\n\nR.J. said Ridge was overreacting and told Brooke to back R.J. up. Brooke, however, understood Ridge's concerns due to the history. R.J. claimed it was in the past, but Ridge cited Sally's actions against Steffy. Coco apologized for her sister and said Sally just wanted Spectra to be a success. Ridge asserted that Sally wanted publicity at his daughter's expense. R.J. argued that Steffy had given as good as she'd gotten and noted that Sally had wound up facedown in a cake.\n\n\nCoco acknowledged that her sister got carried away at times, but she wasn't her sister and vowed to never betray Forrester. Coco just wanted to work there and learn. Ridge couldn't let Coco work there. He said Coco's great aunt had been a thief, and he had no reason to believe the new generation would be any different. R.J. balked at his father's decision, but Coco told R.J. that Ridge was just doing what he thought was best.\n\n\nCoco left to clear her locker, and the argument about her continued in her absence. R.J. didn't know what was wrong with extending a hand in friendship. Brooke called Thomas and Rick's choice na\u00efve, and Ridge asserted that if R.J. had lived through what Ridge had, then R.J. wouldn't even be asking his question. Brooke said Ridge would help R.J. find another intern. \"One with a different last name,\" Ridge added.\n\n\nDown in shipping and receiving later, R.J. caught up to Coco to apologize for his father. On the landing above, Ridge stopped and observed the conversation. Coco understood Ridge's decision. R.J. hated to see her go but believed she'd have a good future. The two bade each other farewell.\n\n\nBehind R.J., a forklift stacked with boxes rolled closer to him. Coco turned to wave, and she cried out R.J.'s name to warn him of the danger.\n\n\nOn-screen, memorable moments of seasons ten, eleven, and twelve of The Bold and the Beautiful played, Eric proposed to Sally, and C.J. and Rick began a teenaged rivalry. Amber slept with Usher.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy catches Thomas with his bod showing while putting on his shirt. She chides that this is not the place.

Brooke and Ridge hunt down RJ in the stock room and tells him while in Australia that she and his dad are going to elope. Reason for a group hug. This is what RJ always wanted and why he came home this time. He knows Bill Spencer is going to be there and Brooke says yes but that is why they will be doing theirs separately so no one can interrupt them. Coco makes herself known so RJ introduces them. When he hears the name Spectra he tells Coco that he is sorry but she has to leave even though RJ tells him that Thomas and Rick signed off on this. Sally still bucks Shirley with her suggestion that Coco help them spy. Shirley says there is using and then completely different in being used when you do not even realize it. Sally replies that she knows it is the 15th round and they are going to have the knockout punch very soon but if Coco is adamant in not stealing then she is not going along with it. Shirley explains that there is a way that Coco can steal and spy for them without even knowing it. Saul says and he helped but he was told it was for security. Shirley says it is \u0096 their security in the business. Sally mulls it over and finally says it just might work. Shirley puts her hand out first, then Saul on top and finally Sally as they form a pact. Coco tells Ridge that yes Sally is her sister but she would never betray FC. Ridge answers that the original Sally stole from them so how do they know this generation will be any different. Steffy finally says that okay, Coco can stay but if anything goes wrong it is on Thomas's. RJ catches Coco as she leaves and says he did not know his dad would re-act like this. He hates to see her go and he does believe in her. She says that means a lot. As he turns around she screams out his name as an overloaded forklift heads straight to him.",
