Nick assures her that Phoebe is fine and jokingly tells her the next time Stephanie comes over he plans to put duck tape over her mouth.  Attempting to get Taylor to relax, Nick spoon feeds her some soup.  Despite his attentiveness, Taylor remains insecure about his feelings.  Nick tells her that whether Brooke and Ridge stay together or not will have no effect on him.  He goes on to tell her how happy she makes him and how much he loves being with her.  Things heat up and they make love. Afterwards he tells her Brooke is his past and warns her that Stephanie will probably be pushing Ridge on her next.  Taylor tells Nick that doesn't matter since he is the only man for her.  Still obsessing on the subject, Taylor states that she can't believe Ridge and Brooke would end things at this late date.  Bored with the topic, Nick shuts Taylor up with a kiss.\n\n\nAt Big Bear, Brooke orders Ridge to let go of Rick.  Stephanie agrees, telling Ridge he should direct all of his anger toward Brooke since she has been lying to him the whole time.  Ridge questions Brooke and she admits that she knew the truth but argues that Rick isn't a threat to Phoebe.  Ridge is appalled by Brooke's betrayal.  Brooke says she tried to tell him earlier but things got too crazy once he decided to  turn their wedding into a hug press event.  Ridge angrily tells her she had no right to do it and Brooke counters that he had no right to threaten her son's life.  Stephanie butts in and tells Brooke to stop blaming other people for her lack of judgment.  Brooke argues that Ridge can't expect Rick and Phoebe to turn their feelings off just because he says so. Ridge sadly replies that he wished she had as much respect for his feelings as she does for the children's.  Exasperated, Brooke drags Rick into another room so she can have a moment alone with her son.  Once they are alone, Rick apologizes to his mother and explains that he had no idea Stephanie was spying on them or he never would have set up a secret meeting at the cabin.  Rick adds that he thinks Stephanie's main objective now is to split up Brooke and Ridge.  Brooke tells Rick she isn't worried about Stephanie, she is more concerned about his situation with Phoebe spiraling out of control and causing something really awful to happen.  Brooke pressures her son to be mature and end things with Phoebe before it's too late.\n\n\nBack in the den at Big Bear,  Stephanie warns her son  that  a marriage of  lies will never  work.  Phoebe apologizes to her Dad for sneaking around behind his back.  Ridge accepts her apology and admits he could have handled the situation better.  When Brooke and Rick come back in, Brooke tells everyone that Rick and Phoebe need to talk alone.  Despite Stephanie's protests, Brooke manages to get everyone to leave.  Once they are alone again, Phoebe tells Rick that she is relieved that everything is out in the open.  Sensing that Rick is in a strange mood, Phoebe asks him what is wrong and wanders what his mother said to him.  Fearing that Brooke tried to guilt trip him into breaking up with her, Phoebe tells Rick that Ridge and Brooke would never  break up because of their relationship.  She pleads with Rick not to worry about what people think, telling him all that matters is that she loves him. Relenting, Rick gives her a kiss, but looks very troubled afterwards.\n\n\nMeanwhile in the car, Brooke and Ridge argue and Ridge threatens to turn the car around and head back to Big Bear.  Brooke makes him pull over then she lays into him for being so violent with Rick.  She orders him to never  lay a hand on her son again.  Ridge promises he won't, but worries about what kind of future they have if Brooke feels she has no other choice but to lie to him.\n\n\n",
