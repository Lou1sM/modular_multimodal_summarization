    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Hope and Ridge discussed how Brooke would take the news from Katie. Hope doubted that Brooke would even believe Katie, but Ridge said he'd also talk to Brooke. Hope was sure he'd get his chance. He stated that he'd had every reason to believe it would work with Brooke that time around, but Hope added that there was a big reason that it hadn't.\n\n\nThough Hope believed that Ridge loved her mother, she felt that it was no longer enough. To her, it was better that he and Katie revealed their feelings. Ridge grew antsy and decided to take off for Katie's house so that Katie wouldn't have to face Brooke alone.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Quinn was excited that her son was back from Paris and that Thorne had liked Wyatt's ideas. Wyatt said he and Hope had been able to bond on the trip, and they were closer than ever. He was astounded that Hope trusted him and had confided in him.\n\n\nQuinn was curious to know what Hope had confided in Wyatt about. Wyatt stammered, but at Quinn's pressing, he revealed that it had been about Brooke. He said the point wasn't what Hope had confided, but that she'd leaned on him. Quinn asked how the rest of the trip had been, and he said that it had gone well -- except that Thorne's daughter was a little \"different.\"\n\n\nWyatt explained that Aly expected Hope to be the voice of chastity and to be vigilantly committed to Liam. Wyatt said Hope hadn't let it bother her, and Quinn stated that Hope was lucky to have him. Remarking that Hope had a lot on her plate, he decided to find her and help her unwind.\n\n\nQuinn asked if she could help and noted that he was never too old for his mother's help. Wyatt said, in that situation, he actually was. As he went to the door, he assured her that he could handle his relationship with Hope. Wyatt passed Pam, who was entering the office as he was leaving.\n\n\nQuinn said Pam was just who she wanted to see. Quinn announced that she wanted to send Hope some flowers. Pam asked if Quinn expected Pam to order them. Quinn said Pam could put it on Quinn's or Eric's expense accounts. \"He's not going to mind, knowing they are from me,\" she said.\n\n\nPam took care of the flower order and returned to Quinn to ask what Wyatt was pulling with the jewelry belonging to Pam's sister. Pam wondered if he planned on swiping Stephanie's jewels while they were on display. \"Look, Pam, why don't we just try --\" Quinn started to say.\n\n\nPam interrupted Quinn to say that they weren't doing anything. Pam called Quinn a fake and a phony who was cozying up to Eric. Irritated, Quinn asked if Pam missed Chicago and suggested that it was a better place for Pam to be. Pam quipped that she was \"a California girl now.\"\n\n\nQuinn retorted that if Pam left, she'd miss \"Upchuck,\" her boyfriend. Pam warned Quinn to be nice to Pam, who at any time could go to the authorities with a certain tape that she had. As the two women bantered with each other, Aly hid behind a clothes rack in the corridor to observe them.\n\n\nPam declared that Wyatt's actions had been immoral and illegal, but she hadn't exposed him because he still worked with Forrester -- and because Hope cared about him for some reason. Pam promised that the moment those things were no longer true, she'd see to it that Wyatt went to jail.\n\n\nLater, Pam was alone in the office when Aly entered. She said she'd seen Pam and Quinn talking, but she hadn't heard what the two had been saying. Aly freely stated that she had issues with Quinn and Wyatt, and she asked if Pam did, too. Pam shrugged, and Aly conveyed that her instincts said the two were no good. Pam told Aly to trust her instincts, and Aly asked what Pam knew about the Fullers.\n\n\nIn the steam room, Hope met Wyatt as he'd requested through a text message. He was sure she was stressed out about her mother and Ridge. As she kissed Wyatt, Hope asked that they not talk about it. Wyatt massaged her shoulders, and she said she'd really needed the time with him.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Brooke was confused when she heard that Katie was in love with Ridge. \"Ridge?\" Brooke asked, and her confusion erupted into incredulous laughter. Katie asked why Brooke was laughing, and Brooke said that it was cute. Brooke wanted to tell Ridge, but Katie said he knew.\n\n\nBrooke assumed that it had been pretty awkward for Katie when she'd revealed it to Ridge. Brooke knew that a lot of women had crushes on Ridge, but she'd never assumed that Katie would. Brooke figured that he'd let her sister down easy. Unfazed by the crush, Brooke said that Katie didn't need to be embarrassed because it was understandable. Brooke claimed to know how one felt when Ridge acted as her knight in shining armor. Katie stated that it was more than that.\n\n\nBrooke claimed to understand how Ridge and Katie would bond as they'd commiserated over the hurt that Brooke had caused them. Katie replied that it was more complicated than that. Brooke, however, was convinced that Ridge's gallantry had made Katie swoon. Brooke relayed that she wasn't bothered by the feelings Katie had developed, and Katie was the last person she'd feel insecure about.\n\n\nBrooke hugged Katie, who looked offended as she peered over Brooke's shoulder. Katie became upset that Brooke would laugh at the thought of Katie being a threat. Brooke said it wasn't an insult, but Katie guessed Brooke felt that Ridge could be with no woman after her.\n\n\nBrooke asked Katie to calm down before she fainted again. Katie revealed that she hadn't fainted at the wedding, and when she'd collapsed, it had been a lie. \"What are you talking about? You ruined my wedding,\" Brooke said.\n\n\n\"I know,\" Katie replied. Confused, Brooke asked if Katie actually thought that Ridge would return Katie's feelings. Katie asserted that Ridge actually did have feelings for her. Sighing, Brooke explained that it wasn't a romance novel or any of Katie's poetry. \"He told me!\" Katie yelled.\n\n\nBrooke told her sister that Ridge was practically Brooke's husband, and they had a child together. Katie cited that Brooke and Ridge were not married. Brooke almost said something but decided to leave before she said something regrettable.\n\n\nBrooke offered to pick up the conversation later, but Katie insisted that Brooke didn't understand. Brooke explained that Ridge only felt compassion and warmth for Katie. Katie agreed that it had been that way at first, but she added that she and Ridge had spent a lot of time with each other. Brooke yelled that he'd been being nice. \"Oh, my God! How na\u00efve can you be?\" Brooke asked.\n\n\nJust then, Ridge arrived, and Brooke was relieved to see him. Brooke told him that they should go because Katie wasn't feeling well. Katie announced that she was feeling fine. \"I told her, but she doesn't want to accept it,\" Katie said, and the appalled Brooke stared at Ridge.\n\n\nBrooke told Katie not to embarrass herself, but Katie advised Brooke not to leave until she understood. Turning to Ridge, Brooke assumed he knew about the little crush that Katie had. He nodded. Brooke said it was sweet, but nonsense. Ridge suggested that he and Brooke leave so that they could talk about it, and Brooke agreed to go with him.\n\n\nTurning to Katie, Brooke said she wouldn't hold it against her sister. Brooke felt that Katie needed time alone to realize that Ridge was Brooke's husband, and Brooke and he were starting a life together. Katie asserted that Ridge wasn't Brooke's husband and hadn't been for a long time.\n\n\nKatie said things had changed, and Katie and Ridge had changed. While Brooke had seemed to stay in the same place, Katie and Ridge had gained better expectations from their lives and from love. Brooke turned to Ridge and said Katie needed to hear from him that what Katie had going on in her head was wrong. When Ridge said nothing, Brooke implored him to tell Katie. \n\n\n",

Unable to take his mind off of Katie and Brooke, Ridge leaves the office to go see what is happening with the two women in his life. When Ridge arrives, Brooke assumes that Katie\u2019s admission is a crush but that he could not possibly reciprocate her feelings. Aly watches as Pam and Quinn have a conversation about Hope and Wyatt in Rick\u2019s office. Quinn tries to get under Pam\u2019s skin.

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke cannot contain herself and almost laughs at Katie. In fact later, after they waltz around the May Pole for twenty minutes, she does laugh at Katie when Katie admits that she loves Ridge. Brooke giggles but tells Katie that she can understand and she does not feel threatened by that. Katie has a crush on Ridge. Lots of women do. Again like pulling teeth, Katie slowly gets it out that it is not just a crush. She loves Ridge and he knows it. Brooke says that is cute and says she is sure Ridge was kind and let her down easy. Ridge tries to call but then tells Hope this may take a while. Hope says she knows. Her mom is not going to accept this easily, but he'll get his chance. She understands why Katie wanted to talk to him first. She also knows that Ridge still cares for her mother. But if he has feelings for Katie he can not just cover that up. He thanks Hope for giving them this time. He knows it was not easy on her. She says no, but it was the right thing to do for all three. Quinn greets Wyatt back with a hug. He said he just had to go to Paris with Hope. He answers all of Quinn's questions about having a magnificent time there and that he and Hope are closer than ever. They have a deep connection. She trusts him and confides in him. She leans on him in time of family crisis. Quinn quips it is a good thing he has the shoulders for it. She gets him to say that 99% of the trip was flawless, but that 1%.....Thorne's daughter is different. She's got this idea in her head that Hope has to be like a nun or something. That she's the voice of chastity or something and needs to be committed to Liam no matter what. Hope has a lot on her plate right now so he's gonna go find her and held her unwind. Quinn asks if he needs help. You're never too old to ask for your mother's help sometimes. He says trust him, this one he has covered. Quinn catches Pam and orders her to send some flowers to Hope. She can either charge it to Quinn's account at the office or to Eric's. He won't mind. Pam lets her know that she is not exactly thrilled that they are putting Stephanie's personal jewelry on display .and wonders if Wyatt is planning swiping those too in another heist. Quinn tries to unruffle her feathers but Pam says no they aren't going to be friends. She's not interested. Quinn is a fake and a phony. She knows Quinn cozied up to her and then to Eric all to further her advancement. Quinn asks if Pam misses Chicago as that might be a better place for her now. Pam says no, she is a California girl. Quinn says oh that's right, she would miss her boyfriend, UpChuck. Pam calls her weirdo and says she better be nice to her as she could walk up anytime to the authorities with a certain little tape she has. She says the only thing stopping her right now is that Wyatt still works there and for some reason Hope seems to like him. But the minute that isn't true, she'll see to it that Wyatt is in jail so fast. Wyatt joins Hope in the steam room as per his text. With all she is going through he thought she might need something to relax. They kiss and she says they don't need to talk about her mom or Aunt Katie. They kiss more and he gives her a back massage which she loves. Brooke tells Katie that she is not laughing at her or even considering that Katie is not competition for Ridge. Katie says yeah because he has been with Brooke and no other woman would be enough for him. Brooke tells Katie to calm down. She doesn't want her fainting again. And this is not one of her romantic novels or her poetry. Ridge would not return her feelings. They are together and practically married. She says she is going to leave before either say something they will regret. Katie says Brooke really doesn't understand. Brooke says she does. Katie has a crush on Ridge but he just has warmth, compassion and friendliness, that's all. Katie says yes at first but they have spent a lot of time together. Ridge can't wait any longer. He tells Hope that he's going over there. Katie should not be going through this alone. Aly sneaks around and almost scares Pam. They confide that neither of them trusts the Fullers. They are no good and they need to keep an eye on them. Trust your instincts. Ridge walks in just as Brooke tells Katie how naive can she be. She tells Ridge they need to go because Katie is not feeling well. Katie tells Ridge that she is fine. She told Brooke but she won't accept it. Brooke tells Ridge that she thinks it is sweet. She tells Katie that she will not hold this against her but she needs time to think this through. Ridge is her friend but Brooke's husband. Katie stands tall and says he has not been Brooke's husband in a long time and things change. At least she has; perhaps Brooke stays in the same place. But she and Ridge have learned they have different expectations for what they want in their lives and how they want to be loved. Brooke turns to Ridge and says that Katie needs to hear this from him. Just tell her how ridiculous all of this is. Whatever she has going on in her head is wrong; so just tell her.",
