Ridge had insisted earlier that Coco couldn't work at Forrester because she was a Spectra. Coco and R.J. said their goodbyes, and Coco headed for the door, but she noticed a forklift loaded with boxes behind R.J. It was headed directly at him.\n\n\nCoco screamed at R.J. to move and then dived at him to push him out of the way. Ridge turned and saw Coco save his son. The forklift missed them, but they had been thrown into a wall of boxes. After Coco pulled R.J. to safety, they stared at each other in shock. Ridge rescued them both and thanked Coco for saving R.J.\n\n\nLater in Ridge's office, Ridge and R.J. doted on Coco. She had cut her head when she'd saved R.J. Ridge encouraged her to apply pressure to it. He quizzed her to make sure she hadn't suffered a concussion. Brooke entered and expressed concern. She said she'd heard that R.J. had been in an accident.\n\n\nRidge explained that a worker had lost control of a forklift that had been headed for R.J., but Coco had pushed him out of the way in the nick of time. \"We can never thank you enough,\" Brooke said. R.J. advised his parents that Coco was a good person. He encouraged his father to reconsider his decision that she couldn't work there. \"I shouldn't have judged you by your last name,\" Ridge admitted. However, he still insisted that she couldn't work there.\n\n\nR.J. was angry and reminded his dad that he could be dead. Brooke also defended Coco. R.J. and Brooke insisted that they could not remove her because of her name. R.J. said the families had to put their feud to rest. Brooke added that Coco had proven her loyalty.\n\n\nRidge caved in to the pressure. He told Coco that she could stay. She thanked him, Brooke, and R.J., and then Coco and R.J. left. Brooke reminded Ridge that Coco had risked her life to save R.J. \"Thank you, Ridge, for letting her stay,\" Brooke said. Ridge replied that it would be his good deed for the year.\n\n\nRidge said he didn't like the idea of having a Spectra there. Brooke told him to be more trusting. Ridge said he had a strange feeling about her working there. Brooke argued that Coco was a good girl. She sat on Ridge's lap and told him he was too suspicious. \"I always have a reason,\" he said.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Saul and Sally discussed that they needed to find a way to get Coco to spy for them. They discussed that Shirley had suggested a camera, and Sally scoffed. Saul said it wasn't far-fetched. He had already purchased the camera at Shirley's suggestion. Sally wanted to see it. Saul showed her the miniscule camera and said they could put it in Coco's sunglasses or a brooch. Sally scoffed again that she wasn't going to be wearing sunglasses indoors, and brooches weren't fashionable for teenagers.\n\n\nSaul suggested a necklace, and Sally agreed. She selected one that Coco had admired earlier. Sally agreed it could work. Saul installed the camera and told Sally that the tiny camera could record for hours, and they could watch it live. Sally realized they could see all the fabrics and designs without anyone knowing. Sally tried on the necklace and matching earrings and said it could work.\n\n\nSaul admired Sally and fantasized about her calling his name. Sally snapped him out of his reverie. \"Are you listening to me?\" she asked. Saul stammered that he was listening. He told her that he had found some old pictures after he had cleaned out desks. He said that his grandfather had had a thing for her great-aunt.\n\n\nSaul and Sally smiled, and Saul said that his grandfather had proposed to her great-aunt. Sally was surprised, and a flashback showed Saul proposing to Sally. \"I really do care about you. You are my oldest and dearest friend,\" Sally had said to Saul. \"I want you to be my wife. Take and wear this ring,\" Saul had said.\n\n\nSaul and Sally talked about family, and Sally explained that her grandmother had raised her and Coco because her parents hadn't been around much. Saul asked about her parents. Sally explained that they had been \"carnies\" and had been in shows all over California and Nevada. She said it got worse because her parents had gotten into being scammers with card games and \"some sketchy stuff on the side.\"\n\n\nSally recalled that her parents had done almost anything to make extra money, and they'd started dealing in more than cards. \"Grams always says Spectras are survivors. But we're swindlers -- a long line of swindlers and con artists,\" Sally said.\n\n\nSally added that eventually her parents had been unable to care for their kids. Shirley had taken them in, or they would have been in the system. \"She worked hard at the bakery and scratched and clawed for every buck,\" Sally said.\n\n\nSally lamented that she would be making knockoffs, but Saul said there was nothing wrong with knockoffs. Sally disagreed. She said Coco didn't deserve to be dragged into that business. Then she reasoned that Coco was \"destined to become one of us.\"\n\n\nSally said Coco had grown up with very little trust of others. Saul pointed out that Coco was their only chance to hold off the loan sharks. They had to pay the bills. \"It means I'll be deceiving my sister. Lying to her face,\" Sally said. Saul reasoned that starting a business meant one had to do some things one didn't want to in order to survive.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, R.J. and Coco chatted, and Coco explained that she had fantasized about working there for years. She admired a row of gowns. She and R.J. laughed that they couldn't have predicted a \"near-death experience.\" R.J. promised there was never a dull moment at Forrester. Coco said there was no place she'd rather be. She thanked him for going to bat for her with his dad.\n\n\nR.J. confessed that from the first time he had seen Coco, he'd had a feeling he was supposed to meet her. \"You saved my life,\" he said. Coco said that anyone would have done exactly the same thing. They kissed.\n\n\n",
