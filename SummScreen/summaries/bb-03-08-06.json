He told Massimo how Felicia had been the life of the party up until the very end when she had gotten the family to send her off with a Champagne toast. Massimo knew Ridge was grieving, and he felt Ridge needed to be with Brooke and R.J. He wanted to take Ridge over to Brooke's house. Ridge agreed, and they headed over to see her.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Chuck's, Hector arrived and found Taylor getting drunk. Hector was surprised that Taylor would want to hang out at such a seedy joint. He thought she was drowning her sorrows because she was upset about Ridge's wedding. Taylor told him that was not why she was drinking. She was drinking because Felicia had died, and she was drinking a toast to Felicia.\n\n\nHector was sad to hear Felicia was dead and wanted to take Taylor home. He told her he would stay with her. Taylor refused. She was concerned about Ridge. Hector said Ridge had Brooke to lean on, since they were married. Taylor told him Nick had stopped the wedding. Hector could not understand why Nick would do such a thing.\n\n\nTaylor thought Brooke was probably having second thoughts about marrying Ridge, since Nick was free. Hector was afraid Taylor was thinking about reconciling with Ridge. He told her she should have too much pride to go after Ridge. Taylor said she did not care about self-respect or pride; she just wanted her husband back.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Nick called to tell her that Felicia was dead. He told her that Felicia's death had made him realize how short life was. Brooke agreed that tragedy made people realize how precious time was. Nick said he needed to see her. Brooke wanted to see him, too, but told him Bridget needed her more right then. Brooke heard a car in the driveway and thought it was Bridget. Nick told her he loved her, and she told him she loved him.\n\n\nBrooke was anxious to see Bridget and got off the phone before Nick could ask her a very important question. Brooke was surprised when Ridge walked into her bedroom. She hugged him and told him how sorry she was. She asked him how she could help. Ridge told her just being with her made things a lot better. They kissed, and Ridge went to take a shower.\n\n\nDownstairs at Brooke's, Nick walked in and found Massimo pacing back and forth. He asked what Massimo was doing there. Massimo said he'd taken Ridge home because Ridge needed to be with Brooke that night. He said Nick had already disrupted their wedding, and he did not want Nick to interfere with their honeymoon.\n\n\nNick told Massimo that he and Brooke loved each other, and they were not going to deny it anymore or let anyone keep them apart. Massimo asked Nick why Brooke was upstairs in the bedroom with Ridge if she was so committed to him. Nick got upset. Massimo tried to stop him from going upstairs, but Nick was determined see Brooke.\n\n\nBack in Brooke's bedroom, Ridge emerged from the shower and started trying to seduce her. Brooke halfheartedly attempted to fight off his advances. She said she knew he had to have questions about Nick. Ridge said he did not want to talk about that. He just wanted to lose himself in her and deal with everything else later. They started kissing passionately.\n\n\nRidge told Brooke he loved her, and Brooke told him she loved him. Brooke told him making love wouldn't take away his pain. However, Ridge thought it was worth a try. When Nick got upstairs and pushed Brooke's door open, he was devastated to see Brooke and Ridge kissing and caressing each other in bed.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Massimo offers Ridge his support over Felicia's death, but furthers his own agenda by pushing Ridge to return to Brooke to seek comfort. Brooke breaks off a call with Nick to find Ridge at her door, looking for solace. Brooke comforts Ridge in his grief over losing his sister, but when Ridge wants to go further she tries to put him off, telling him it's been an emotional day. The two fall back on the bed together, Ridge wearing only a towel, and Brooke's robe falling off one shoulder. Hector comes into Chuck's Bar to find Taylor downing wine. Hector's curious about her choice of watering holes, and she tells him she can't face the people in the other places she used to go. She tells him that she is grieving for Felicia. Hector tries to get Taylor to slow down on the drinking, but she continues to order, telling Hector that she wants Ridge back. Nick has shown up at Brooke's home to see her and finds Massimo cleaning up the remnants of the wedding. Nick cannot believe Massimo when he tells him that Ridge is upstairs with Brooke and heads up only to see Brooke on top of Ridge in bed.\r\n",
