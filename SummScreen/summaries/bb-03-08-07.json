Jackie talks about Brooke and Hope and how happy they made him. Nick tells his mom that that's over, but Brooke and Ridge may be over too since they are experiencing some tension over the Rick and Phoebe relationship, so there may not be a wedding after all. Jackie says there might still be hope for them, but Nick tells her Brooke is gone, and he doesn't want her back. Taylor comes in and overhears, and an embarrassed Jackie tries to make light of it. Jackie says good night, and Taylor tells Nick she needs to go home because she has a feeling Phoebe needs her, but Nick wants her to stay. She assures him everything is fine. She just needs to be home for Phoebe. As they embrace, Taylor is disconcerted as she looks over his shoulder to see the picture of Hope on his laptop. \n\n\nAt Brooke's, Ridge and Brooke discuss the Rick and Phoebe situation agreeing that they each have different parenting styles, but  Ridge admits he is still upset about her hiding that Rick and Phoebe were seeing each other. He feels Rick is too worldly for Phoebe since he has been married, divorced and lived in Europe. He feels Phoebe needs someone her own age.  Brooke assures him Rick will be ending things with Phoebe for the family. She also tells Ridge he must accept her son and love him - maybe not the relationship between him and Phoebe, but Rick as a person. She adds that she can't have a dysfunctional family, and she needs to resolve this now before she goes to Australia to help open the new store.  \n\n\nAt Big Bear, Rick and Phoebe continue to cuddle, kiss and hug as they discuss their feelings. Rick tells Phoebe he loves her, but they can't do anything about it right now for the family's sake. He assures her that they'll be fine, but for now, they need to put on the brakes. He adds that no matter what, he will never let her go. Phoebe says she wants him to love her now, but he tells her she deserves better than a few hidden moments at the cabin. He wants their time together to be special - very special. He leaves to return home, and Phoebe says she will follow in her car in a few minutes. As Rick leaves, he calls Brooke on his cell phone to tell her that he and Phoebe know how it has to be. Meanwhile, as Phoebe packs up to leave inside the cabin, she tells herself that her father is wrong. \"I don't care what you say, Dad.\" \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Phoebe pressures Rick to make love to her; it's not wrong and it's unfair for their parents to dictate to them. He puts on the brakes and she begs him not to. He tells her he loves her and he wants her special moment to be as perfect as she is. Despite more pressuring, he tells her they must leave the cabin, but he won't let anything happen to them. Nick enjoys the CD that Hope sent over and Jackie realizes he misses her terribly. She's delighted to hear that the Ridge/Brooke wedding might not take place. He nixes any plans she has of getting him back with Brooke. Suddenly she is embarrassed when Taylor comes downstairs and even more so when Taylor hints that she knows Jackie has fond feelings for Brooke and believes she is the one who can make her son happy. Brooke has words with Ridge, but doesn't believe this situation is as big a deal as he does. She tells him if he loves her, then he must love her son. They don't have to agree, but he must accept him. Rick explains that sneaking around was wrong and also sent Ridge the wrong message, that he didn't respect her. When she has doubts of their parents accepting this, he vows no matter what, he will never ever let her go. Nick tells Taylor to forget what his mother said, she really wasn't trying to start trouble. Ridge says it comes down to a difference in parenting styles, but he doesn't want that to interfere with their relationship. Rick calls Brooke and tells her they are fine, but it's over. Ridge is grateful that Brooke managed to get him to call it off. Thinking out loud, Phoebe vows that no matter what her dad says, she and Rick are NOT over.",
