    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, after R.J. had kissed Coco, they giggled and flirted. She thanked him for an amazing day, and he thanked her for saving his life. Coco left.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Ridge met with Thomas, Rick, Maya, and Nicole. They discussed that Steffy and Liam planned to marry in Australia, and he and Brooke had similar plans. However, they were eloping there in a secret spot.\n\n\nRidge, Thomas, Rick, Maya, and Nicole discussed Coco, the new intern, and Ridge refocused the meeting to security and how important it was for the company to protect designs that they would present in an impromptu fashion show in Australia. Ridge stressed that he wanted no security lapses.\n\n\nR.J. joined the meeting in Ridge's office. Everyone expressed their concern for R.J. and the close call he'd had with the forklift. Ridge reminded them that they had to stay focused on Australia and security.\n\n\nLater, in his office, Thomas worked on sketches, and R.J. entered. He and Thomas discussed that Ridge seemed paranoid about security. \"When's the last time anyone stole anything from us?\" R.J. asked.\n\n\nThomas answered that he remembered the days when Spectra had stolen designs. He defended their father. \"He's got a history with the Spectras,\" Thomas said. R.J. defended Coco and said she wanted to contribute -- it wasn't her fault that her last name was Spectra.\n\n\nThomas marveled that R.J. had changed their father's mind and persuaded him to allow Coco to stay at the company. Thomas admired R.J.'s negotiating skills. R.J. said it was because he was the youngest. Thomas laughed and said he was spoiled. R.J. laughed and agreed. He also confessed that he had kissed Coco. Thomas was surprised and teased that they should tell their dad.\n\n\nLater, R.J. visited his dad's office. He thanked Ridge for allowing Coco to stay at the company. Ridge smiled and acknowledged that R.J. appeared to have a crush on her. R.J. didn't want his dad to lecture him. Ridge agreed. He warmly grabbed R.J.'s shoulders. \"Be careful, son. She's a Spectra,\" Ridge advised.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Saul and Sally clued Shirley in on how he had installed video cameras in a necklace and in matching earrings as well. The jewelry cameras would enable them to watch anything Coco saw in real time when she was wearing them. Shirley was impressed and added that she was glad Sally was on board.\n\n\nSally lamented that they had to use Coco at all, but Saul pointed out that Coco was their only chance to hold off the loan sharks. Darlita and Coco entered, and Coco shared the details of her first day at Forrester.\n\n\nCoco said it had been great, but she noted that it had started off rocky when she'd met Ridge and Brooke. She said Brooke had been kind, but Ridge hadn't wanted her there and had asked if she was Sally's sister. Ridge had told her that Sally was a stalker.\n\n\nCoco said she'd told the Forresters she'd never do anything dishonest. \"He fired me,\" Coco said. Shirley was shocked. Coco shared that Ridge and R.J. had escorted her out to the back door, where R.J. had apologized for his father. She said she'd headed for the door, but she'd turned back and seen that a runaway forklift had been headed directly for R.J. Coco said she'd pushed him out of the way and saved him.\n\n\nSaul, Sally, Darlita, and Shirley were happy for Coco, but Coco said Ridge had still fired her. Shirley asked if the day had had a happy ending, and Coco said it had. She said R.J. had defended her and stood up for her. Eventually, he'd persuaded his father to allow her to stay.\n\n\n\"My heart can't take much more,\" Shirley said. \"There's more,\" Coco said. She explained that when she'd been alone with R. J., he had kissed her. Darlita said she couldn't stand it -- such a romantic story. Darlita left.\n\n\n\"Working it just like your Great-Aunt Sally,\" Shirley said. Coco's phone rang, and she left to talk to R. J. He wanted to make sure Coco was all right. He thanked her for an awesome day, and they agreed they couldn't wait to see each other the next day. \"Stay away from runaway forklifts,\" Coco advised.\n\n\nInside the office, Sally said she couldn't use the necklace. She didn't want to involve Coco. Shirley argued that she was willing to fight \"until they drag us out of here.\" Sally maintained it was cruel to use Coco.\n\n\nSaul justified that it was necessary. Sally was unhappy about it. Shirley reminded her that Coco had seen many thousand-dollar dresses, and if Spectra designed a look-alike and sold it at a fraction of the price, they were helping other women.\n\n\nSally snarked that Shirley made them sound saint-like. Shirley countered that Sally seemed to think it would be better to go belly up. Shirley wondered what Sally's great-aunt would think when she had asked Sally to resurrect the company. \"We can do this,\" Saul said. Sally shook her head and said they were hurting Thomas too. \"Thomas is good and honest,\" she said.\n\n\nShirley said Coco would save Spectra. Sally said Coco had a chance to make it at Forrester, but Shirley and Saul argued that Thomas and R.J. were not from the same world as the Spectras. \"You need someone you can depend on,\" Saul said. Shirley teased that that would be someone with a tape measure around his neck, referring to Saul.\n\n\nCoco returned. Sally gave Coco the necklace and earrings. Coco thanked her. Sally told her to show the necklace to Darlita. Thomas called Sally and said that his brother and her sister had had a crazy day. \"He and Coco really hit it off. She's a great girl and going to make her mark over here. I look forward to seeing you again,\" Thomas said. Sally agreed. They hung up, and Shirley and Saul noted that Thomas was a rich boy with a pedigree. \"He can afford to share it with us,\" Shirley said.\n\n\nOutside the office, Coco and Darlita talked about the necklace and Darlita's dress. Darlita told Coco she would look hot wearing her new jewelry to Forrester. In the office, Saul, Shirley, and Sally watched the video of Coco talking to Darlita -- thanks to the camera installed in the necklace. \"It works!\" Saul said. Shirley added that they were Spectras. \"It's what we do. Once a knockoff shop, always a knockoff shop,\" she said.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "R.J. and Coco share a sweet kiss on the news that she is allowed to continue her internship.

Coco arrives back at the Spectra Fashion and tells the gang all about her first day on the job at Forrester Creations and the charming R.J. Forrester. Sally becomes skeptical of their plan after seeing how happy her sister is. Shirley and Saul pressure Sally into believing this plan is their only option. Sally hesitantly gives Coco the camera-adapted jewelry. Then, Thomas calls who informs Sally that he wants to see her again soon.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Coco can't believe what just happened; that RJ kissed her. He thanks her for saving his life. Ridge tells people in his office they know that Steffy and Liam are getting married in Australia; now he wants to tell them that he and Brooke are doing the same. They are eloping but it is not just fun and games. There is a photo shoot outside the Sydney Opera House. He wants one thing understood. He does not want this small collection to be compromised in any way. Shirley holds up the pendant and Saul says the gizmo is already placed inside and it will record everything. Shirley is ecstatic; sounds like they have thought of everything. This is their legacy and her great aunt Sally put it in her hands to guard and protect. But they cannot save it unless they make a sizeable profit and this is the way to do it. Coco has to come through for them. Coco returns and Shirley grills her about her first day. She explains how she met Ridge and he fired her because of her last name. But then something unbelievable happened. She saved RJ's life. Shirley lights up; that has to count for something. Coco says yes, RJ stepped up for her and Ridge finally said she could stay. Thomas tells RJ even though he may think Ridge is paranoid that does not mean he is wrong. Their designs have been stolen before. So RJ is in charge of the security of the interns. RJ shares with Thomas that he kissed Coco; pretty sure he is the first Forrester to kiss a Spectra. Thomas just smiles. RJ thanks Ridge for accepting Coco. Ridge says he did it for RJ. RJ says again that she is totally amazing and completely trustworthy. Ridge tells him to be careful, she is a Spectra, so do not get too interested in her. Sally tells Saul and Shirley that she cannot do this. Shirley reminds her they have just gone ten rounds and now she wants to throw in the towel. Personally for her she is going to fight until they drag them out of here. Sally says it is horrible and cruel to send Coco over there without her knowing what she is doing. Saul says it is necessary if they are to succeed. Shirley says again the clock is ticking and it is one minute to midnight. And her sister is doing the world a favor all those fancy shmancy $1000 dresses that average people cannot afford. They are giving them options as look-a-likes at a fraction of the price. They have every reason to hold their heads up high. Sally says it is still stealing. Shirley retorts that Coco will not be better off if they all go belly up. Shirley chides her isn't that great if Sally throws in the towel before she has even tried. That would really make her great aunt Sally happy. Saul tells her this is genius really. Coco will wear the earrings and that pendant and they are back in business. Thomas calls Sally and says RJ and Coco hit it off and he thinks she will make a great intern. In speaking with Coco, Sally says she is not looking for a guy. Bashful Saul says she would not have to look far just a guy that speaks her language and Shirley adds and one who always wears a tape measure around his neck. Saul says no, he just wants Sally to know the Spectra's and the Forrester's do not bleed the same blood so it will do Sally no good to set her eyes on Thomas. It will not end well. Coco comes back in and Saul hands Sally the necklace. She presents it to Coco for doing so good on her first day at FC. She thanks them and goes to try it and the earrings on. The others watch her on the laptop as the necklace picks up everything Coco looks at. Shirley gloats that this is going to work like a charm.",
