Stephanie continues to badmouth Brooke and is adamant that the wedding will not happen, but Ridge tells her that he doesn\u2019t want her interfering with him and Brooke.  Felicia changes the focus of the subject and the Forresters talk about pursuing a new fragrance line; everyone likes the idea and is ready for the challenge.  Meanwhile, Rick is busy in his office when he receives a phone call from a \u201cmystery woman.\u201d  He is too distracted to recognize the voice on the phone, and then is met with a surprise visit from Ashley Abbott (the mystery woman).  Rick remembers her from Paris and is stunned to see her.  At the same time, Brooke and Phoebe are arguing about Phoebe\u2019s relationship with Ridge.

    "tvmega_recap": "A mystery lady calls and leaves several messages for Rick. She is in L.A. and is anxious to see him, but does not leave her name. Phoebe continues to want to get touchy-feely in the office and Rick warns her they deserve a real relationship and that means being adults and not sneaking around. She pouts that she hates this, but if he can wait, so can she. Eric, Stephanie, Bridget and Felicia are excited about the upcoming launch. Only Stephanie can throw in a monkey wrench when she tells the girls about Phoebe and Rick being up at Big Bear and Ridge going ballistic because they had Brooke's blessing. Felicia is open-minded but draws the line at relatives hooking up. And they sure don't need a scandal right now. Eric agrees, but it's Rick he is worried about, getting involved with someone as young as Phoebe. Ridge sets them straight that it is all over between the lovebirds. Brooke corners Phoebe and tries to explain this is best for the family. Phoebe whines that Brooke sold her out and is only concerned about getting a wedding ring on her own finger. And Brooke isn't even married to her dad yet and he is having his own way. This is more like a dictatorship than a partnership. Ridge says that he and Brooke have resolved this and are on the same page again. Continue to watch out for the kids, but he thinks they finally got the message and they would never dare cross that line now. The family must come together and support each other, otherwise there will be a dear price to pay, and he doesn't just mean financially. Brooke further advises Phoebe that Rick has lived a full life, she hasn't. She needs to then come back to Rick. When Phoebe is doubtful, Brooke adds that there is no one else in his life, trust her! Good things are worth waiting for. Later she gloats to Stephanie that she is going to be Mrs. Ridge Forrester again but Stephanie snaps back that wedding on Rodeo Drive is far from a done deal. Phoebe tries to avoid her dad but he corners her and remarks that he is happy it is over and wishes things weren't strained between them. In time he hopes she will come to understand. She laments she will wait for Rick as long as she has to. But, if it doesn't work out, she may never forgive Ridge. This is his fault. Rick is finally caught by his mystery woman \u0096 Ashley Abbot and she is thrilled to see him and he pretends also.",
