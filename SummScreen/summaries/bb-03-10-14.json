    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester steam room, Wyatt and Hope made out, but to Wyatt's dismay, Hope told him that they needed to get to a meeting. Wyatt flashed back to the trailer trip that he and Hope had taken.\n\n\nElsewhere in the building, Aly followed Pam into the CEO's office and closed the door behind them. Aly had sensed that Pam was leery of the Fullers, and Aly relayed that she didn't like the pair either. Aly didn't think the selfish money-grubbers should be around, contaminating Hope. Pam reasoned that Hope loved Quinn's jewelry and was also dating Wyatt.\n\n\nAly thought that the Fullers had infiltrated Hope's life, and something needed to be done about it. Aly promised that if Pam gave her the ammunition to take the Fullers down, Aly would run with it.\n\n\nJust then, the giggling Hope entered with Wyatt, and the pair immediately noticed Pam and Aly's serious looks. Hope asked what was going on and if Aly wanted to talk about anything. Aly bit out that it wouldn't make a difference because Hope wouldn't listen and because Wyatt wouldn't let Hope hear. Wyatt quipped that Aly should say it once more with feeling.\n\n\nPam quelled the argument just as Quinn and Eric walked through the door. Quinn asked Pam to make her a cup of coffee. \"Quinn, meet Pot,\" Pam said, gesturing to a decanter. When Quinn poured her own coffee, Pam said she'd like a cup, too. Quinn figured that Pam had to be kidding, but Pam asked if it would kill Quinn, who was standing right by the decanter. Quinn decided to do it -- since she was such a nice person.\n\n\nCaroline and Rick arrived for the meeting, and Eric told everyone that Ridge and Brooke couldn't be there because they were taking care of something important and personal. Wyatt launched into his idea to display the Stephanie Forrester Collection of jewelry, which he was sure would make brooches hip again. Caroline offered to fast-track some designs to match the pieces that Hope would wear.\n\n\nAly immediately voiced her concerns about Wyatt's idea. Aly explained that Stephanie's collection was personal and private, but all Wyatt cared about was marketing and buzz. Aly doubted that he cared about the emotional value of the pieces, and she thought it was undignified and disrespectful to put them on display. Pam spoke up to agree with Aly.\n\n\nAly proffered that Wyatt just wanted to get his name out there and to impress Hope. Wyatt, however, said he couldn't care less about personal publicity. Aly told him that Forrester was a family-run company with established values to uphold, and she wondered if Stephanie would want people gawking at her jewelry. Wyatt insisted the pieces were artwork, and art needed to be shared.\n\n\nWyatt felt that showing the collection would only add to Forrester's reputation and allow people to see and admire the style, elegance, and grace that were synonymous with the Forrester name. Aly quipped that he didn't know her family well enough to speak to those things, and Pam added that she had real concerns about the idea, too.\n\n\nPam agreed with Aly that Stephanie would be mortified, and Pam added that Stephanie's jewelry was also irreplaceable. Because there had already been an attempted heist, Pam was worried that people would think they were an easy target to try again. Wyatt said that he couldn't predict what jewel thieves thought, but he'd do all within his power to keep the collection safe.\n\n\n\"Didn't you do that last time? And look what happened. And also -- safe from whom, Wyatt?\" Pam questioned. Aly cited that it was an awful, but unsurprising, idea from a man who was bad for the company. Aly accused Wyatt of turning an inspirational line into the publicity stunt of the month. Aly said that if he really cared about Forrester, he'd take his mother back to their warehouse and leave Forrester alone.\n\n\nHope stood to defend Wyatt. Though Hope understood Aly's concerns, she didn't like Aly's attitude. Hope emphasized that Wyatt had gotten them more success than they'd ever had, and he was an integral part of the team. Hope wished that Aly would accept that Wyatt wasn't going anywhere. Aly noted that she was a member of the team and the family, and she had a right to her opinion.\n\n\nHope accepted that, and Eric asked what else Wyatt had to say. Wyatt said he and Aly had stated their cases, but it was Eric's decision because the company and collection belonged to him.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Brooke demanded that Ridge set Katie straight, but Ridge revealed that Katie was telling the truth. Brooke suspected that it was a bad joke, and Katie was having a little fun at her sister's expense. Katie uttered that it wasn't a joke.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Ridge and Katie were sleeping together. Ridge said they weren't, and Katie added that they hadn't wanted to hurt Brooke. Brooke called it crazy and asked if it was because of Bill. Katie claimed that she wasn't vindictive like that, but Brooke cited that Katie was doing the same thing that she'd berated Brooke for.\n\n\nRidge stated that his relationship with Katie was nothing like Brooke and Bill's. Brooke yelled that Ridge was breaking up their family and running off with her sister; however, there was no way she'd allow it. Brooke reminded Ridge that they had a son, and R.J. wanted his parents together, not his father and his aunt. Brooke figured it had to be some kind of ultimate revenge of Katie's.\n\n\nFrustrated, Katie shouted that it had nothing to do with revenge, and she'd fought her feelings for as long as possible because she hadn't wanted to steal Brooke's husband or become like Brooke. Brooke asserted that Katie had gone after Ridge, but Ridge said the relationship had just happened. Brooke snipped that it sounded absurd. \"That I would have feelings for your sister?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"Yes!\" Brooke exclaimed. Ridge, however, said that it wasn't, and he felt lucky to have Katie in his life. Brooke asked what had happened to the life that she and Ridge had been putting back together. To Brooke, something was seriously wrong with Ridge imagining a romance with Katie.\n\n\nKatie bit out that Brooke felt that way because she thought no man would want Katie after being with Brooke. Ridge said it was hard, but Brooke had to accept it. \"I'm never going to accept this. Never!\" Brooke exclaimed.\n\n\nBrooke asked how Ridge could be in love with her sister. Ridge didn't know, but he said it had just happened after he and Katie had started opening up to each other. \"So I'm losing you...to my sister...\" Brooke quietly replied, and tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n\nBrooke said that her baby sister was the one with morals and principles. \"Everything I'm not, right?\" she asked. Ridge relayed that he and Brooke had once been everything to each other, but people changed. Brooke refused to believe that he didn't love her. He replied that he did and always would, but he wasn't that man anymore.\n\n\nRidge didn't want to be wildly addicted to someone and always afraid of what would happen next. Brooke asked if Ridge thought the answer was Katie, with whom the only common ground he had was disappointment in Brooke. Brooke implored him not to give up the family and all they'd built. She felt that he was just paying her back for the pain she'd caused him, and he'd chosen a good way of doing it.\n\n\nBrooke asked to talk to Katie alone, but Ridge said it wouldn't change anything. Ridge left, and Katie told Brooke to say what she needed to say. \"I am not letting you get away with this,\" Brooke seethed. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke has a difficult time assimilating the news that Ridge and Katie have given her. Aly turns to Pam for information on Wyatt and Quinn. At a Forrester Creations meeting, Wyatt pitches a unique jewelry line collection to the team. Everyone but Aly seems to like Wyatt\u2019s concept. Wyatt vehemently defends himself, and his mother\u2019s art, to Aly. Everyone looks to Eric to decide whether or not to proceed with the line.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hope and Wyatt are enjoying themselves in the steam room. He's kissing her on the lips, on the neck, on the legs, forearms until she keeps telling him they have to go to a meeting ..the last thing on his mind. Finally he lets her up as he thinks back on their HOTT trip. Brooke tells Ridge that she has no idea what is wrong with her sister for her to think that she has a future with him. He really needs to set her straight. She turns to Katie and says Ridge is not leaving her for Katie. Katie obviously has a crush on him but he's not going to leave her so he needs to tell Katie that. He says he is sorry but Katie is telling the truth. Brooke is shocked and says okay this is a bad joke at her expense and maybe she deserves it. They can have a little laugh and then move on. Katie tells her it is not a joke. So Brooke says okay then they are having an affair and sleeping together. Katie says no, they did not want to hurt Brooke. Brooke guesses this must be a way to get back at Bill. Brooke says she has apologized a thousand times but now Katie is doing the exact same thing. Ridge says no this is different. It is nothing like with her and Bill. Brooke says he is breaking up their family and running off with her sister. She will not allow that. Katie says this has nothing to do with revenge. She tells Brooke that she fought this for so long as she did not want to do the same thing that Brooke did. Ridge says nobody went after nobody. It just happened. And he's very happy to have Katie in his life. He knows it is a shock but Brooke is gonna have to accept it. Brooke keeps saying it is crazy. Katie says she would say that as no man would want Katie after being with Brooke. Brooke says no, she will never accept this ever. Aly tells Pam that Wyatt and Quinn are bad news and she thinks that Pam knows that too. She says she saw her with Quinn just now and noticed her body language. She has also seen how she is around Wyatt. She is suspicious and she has a right to be. They are sneaky and it's all about money and ambition. They should not be around here contaminating Hope. Pam reminds her that Hope loves Quinn's jewelry and she's in a relationship now with Wyatt. Aly tells her that she doesn't have to be involved. Just give Aly the ammunition and she'll run with it. Wyatt and Hope walk in and Hope asks if they are intruding. Aly is curt and says it doesn't matter. Hope won't hear it as he won't let her hear. Pam tries to break it up by saying the others will be here soon for the meeting. Quinn and Eric join in and Eric says Caroline and Rick are on the way. When Quinn can't get Pam to get her a cup of coffee, she ends up pouring one for her and Pam and gives it to her .since she is such a nice person. Eric tells them that Ridge and Brooke won't be here today. They had some personal business. Wyatt gives a little mini presentation about Stephanie's jewelry and says they need to follow up the diamond with more buzz worthy success .stunning, elegant and classy. Eric says Stephanie would have loved that. Wyatt says he would love to display them at the Boutique and then take the collection around the world like a famous art exhibit. Everyone thinks it is a terrific idea except Aly. She speaks up and says it is a terrible idea. Eric asks her to explain. She says her grandmother's collection is not a sideshow. It's private and personal. Wyatt is all about buzz and sales figures. She thinks it is disgraceful and undignified to put them on display. Pam speaks up and says she agrees. Aly continues that Wyatt just wants to get his name out there so people can gush what a hero he is. Wyatt says these are works of art and art should be shared. Pam says that she thinks Stephanie would be mortified but besides that they have already had one attempted heist so who's to say now they won't really be an easy target. Aly continues that she is not surprised that Wyatt would want to do this and turn it into the publicity stunt of the month. But he if he really cares for Hope, he will take his mother and go back to their little warehouse and leave all of them alone. Brooke says she can not even wrap her head around this. Katie says they tried to pretend that it wasn't happening. Brooke cries so she is now losing Ridge to her sister. Hope tries to calm Aly down and says she knows where she is coming from. She knows she is trying to protect the family, but she does not like her attitude. She points out that Wyatt has come up with a concept that will help the line. And they are in a relationship so he's going nowhere and Aly needs to accept that. Aly says she is part of this team and the family too so she has a right to her opinion. Eric tells her duly noted. Wyatt says they have all stated their opinion but ultimately the decision is up to Eric. Brooke repeats her baby sister \u0096 the one with morals and values and principals .everything that Brooke isn't. Ridge says people change. Brooke states that she refuses to believe that he doesn't love her. Ridge says he does love her. He will always love her. And he doesn't regret one moment with her but he's not that man anymore. He doesn't want to be wildly addicted to someone and wonder what is going to happen next. Brooke begs Ridge not to do this, not to break up their family. She knows she hurt them and now he is getting back at her. She wants to speak with Katie alone. Ridge tells her that won't change anything.",
