He entered, and Wyatt explained that he had to talk to someone. Brooke worried about Hope, but Wyatt said she was fine.\n\n\nWyatt added that he had divorce papers. He needed to move on with his life. Wyatt worried about being alone. Brooke said she understood.\n\n\nBrooke offered Wyatt a drink. Wyatt wondered if Brooke had really forbidden his mother to marry Deacon. Brooke said she had, and she would do it again. Brooke worried that Quinn was not good for Deacon, and Brooke said that Deacon was Hope's dad. They had a bond. Wyatt understood that Brooke was protective of Deacon.\n\n\nWyatt asked if something had been bothering Brooke. She lamented that she was alone again. Wyatt noted that she understood his predicament of moving on. Brooke agreed. Wyatt offered to keep her company when she was down because he was a fun guy. She giggled, and she poured them both more drinks. Brooke insisted that they stop discussing sad things. She wanted to sing, dance, and laugh.\n\n\nBrooke stumbled, and Wyatt suggested that she'd had enough to drink. Brooke teased that Wyatt was supposed to be fun, but he was a Debbie Downer. Wyatt encouraged her to take it easy and stop drinking. Brooke said she was home and not going out. There was no reason to stop partying. Wyatt said goodnight, and he left. He gave Brooke a disapproving look. Brooke looked sad.\n\n\nBrooke turned and poured herself another drink. She turned around, stumbled, and cracked her head on the coffee table. She was out cold.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Quinn advised Deacon that Brooke needed to stay away from Deacon, and Deacon needed to stop worrying about Brooke. Quinn hissed that Brooke had forbidden them to get married. Quinn said that was a pretty nervy statement from Brooke -- an ex-lover. Quinn wondered why Deacon had been so worried about Brooke.\n\n\nDeacon admitted that Brooke had suddenly become a drinker. Deacon said that Brooke had never been a heavy drinker, but she had been hitting the booze pretty hard recently. Quinn scoffed that Brooke would be fine as soon as she snared another man.\n\n\nDeacon maintained that he had a good reason to worry about Brooke because he'd had his own problems with alcohol. He knew the symptoms. He admitted that he was an alcoholic. Quinn was surprised.\n\n\nDeacon said he'd been in Alcoholics Anonymous before, and he planned to return. Deacon added that he needed to be clean in order to make it work with Quinn. Surprised, Quinn promised to be supportive. They hugged.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Ivy, Aly, and Nicole hung out in the kitchen. Ivy and Aly asked about Nicole's plans. Nicole shared that she was a student at UCLA, and she majored in computer science. Aly and Ivy said they needed an IT person around the house.\n\n\nAly and Ivy marveled that Nicole would want to stay at the mansion rather than at school -- in the middle of college life at its best. They offered to help her find housing. Nicole wondered if they wanted to get rid of her -- especially since she had Aly's room. Aly and Ivy covered, but Nicole said she understood.\n\n\nNicole added that she wanted to hang around awhile and get to know her sister again. They had spent little time together as youngsters, and after Maya had left home, they'd had little contact.\n\n\nIvy and Aly wondered if Nicole had something against Maya. Nicole denied it, but she added that Rick had invited her to stay at the house -- not Maya.\n\n\nNicole quizzed Aly and Ivy about why Rick would have fallen for Maya when he'd been married to Caroline Spencer -- quite a change in women, Nicole noted. Nicole wondered if Aly and Ivy believed that Rick loved Maya.\n\n\nIvy and Aly said Rick seemed vengeful toward Caroline, but they added that Rick and Caroline had hurt each other, and Maya and Rick had been together before. Nicole thanked Aly and Ivy for the information. She went to bed. Ivy wondered what Aly thought about Nicole. They agreed she seemed nice, but they remembered that Maya had started out as a friend to them.\n\n\nUpstairs at the Forrester mansion, Rick and Maya cuddled. Maya thanked Rick for being so generous to her. Rick wondered why Maya had been against allowing Nicole to stay with them. Maya said that she'd left her family behind years before and had never looked back. Maya gushed that she loved the closeness of Rick's big family. It was everything she had ever wanted. The Forresters worked together, lived together, and had plenty of drama, but they cared about each other on a deeper level.\n\n\nMaya wondered what had made Rick choose Maya over all the women he could have been with. Rick gushed that Maya had been honest with him. He noted that she had integrity. Maya said that she often lacked confidence. She worried that the Forresters and others didn't respect her. Rick argued that people were in awe of Maya -- her beauty, her grace, and her intelligence. Maya and Rick kissed.\n\n\nRick wondered if there was a reason Maya didn't want Nicole to stay with them. Maya hesitated then said that she would try to mend her relationship with Nicole. Maya thanked Rick for being so good to her. Maya got up to take a shower.\n\n\nLater, while Maya had been in the shower, Nicole knocked on the door to Rick and Maya's room. Rick answered and asked if everything had been all right. Nicole agreed, and she thanked Rick for his hospitality. Rick told Nicole that she was family.\n\n\nNicole had wanted to say goodnight to Maya, but Rick said Maya was in the shower. Nicole asked why Rick had decided to be with Maya. Rick was surprised, but Nicole explained that it had appeared that Caroline Spencer had it all. Rick said Caroline had done something very offensive to him, and they would be getting a divorce.\n\n\nRick added that he loved Maya's honesty and integrity. There were no secrets with Maya, he said. Nicole thanked Rick, and she left. Rick closed the door, and Nicole peeked around the corner at the closed door. She said aloud that Maya had a big secret that she doubted Rick or anyone knew.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "While settling into her new residence, Nicole presses Ivy and Aly for information about Maya and Rick\u2019s relationship. When Quinn questions his continued association with Brooke, Deacon asks her to be more understanding about their affiliation. Wyatt updates Brooke on the current state of his and Hope\u2019s marriage. Brooke is blunt with her opinion to Wyatt regarding her feelings towards Quinn and Deacon getting married. Maya questions Rick about their future together.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick admits to Maya that she didn't seem to be jumping up and down with her sister staying here. She says she can be a little generous too since Rick has been to her. Nicole thanks Aly and Ivy for showing her around. She has one question if Rick is really in love with her sister. She's been gone from home for a long time so she barely knows her now but she is happy to be in this fabulous house with her now. Maya tells Rick that it would make her feel good to do something good for Nicole now as they were not close growing up. She missed that big old close family. Quinn asks Deacon why he keeps going over to Brooke's. He says she has been going through some tough changes and wants to be sure she is handling it okay. She's been drinking enough to cause him concern. Quinn snarks that Brooke will get over it when she snags another man. Deacon says he is an alcoholic but he is under control and he intends to stay clean and give this marriage the best shot he has. He's better when he is clean and tomorrow he is starting to go to his first AA meeting in a while. Brooke pours herself a drink but Wyatt shows up before she starts drinking. He shows her the divorce papers and says he is ending his and Hope's marriage. She gives him a hug. He says he lost Hope that very day that she lost the baby and now he has to move on. She says she realizes that it is hard to do that when you are adrift. When she starts to drink she asks him to join in and he asks if she is okay. He even offers to be her best bud if she needs to get out sometimes; he can be fun. Brooke tells Wyatt that Deacon is Hope's father and she sure as hell is not going to let him marry his mother. The girls tell Nicole that Rick says he is in love with Maya but maybe Nicole will pick up on this the more she is around. Aly says Nicole seems nice but then so did Maya when they first met her. Maya doesn't want Rick to ever be ashamed of her or her past. She leaves to take a shower. Nicole is lurking in the hallway and hears her leave. She knocks on Rick's door and says she actually wanted to say goodnight to Maya. When she finds out she is in the shower, she thanks him again for taking her in and then asks why did he pick her sister? He quickly explains that his wife did something egregious that he could not accept and Maya was there for him and the only one who was honest. Nicole thinks to herself \u0096 Maya, honest. She has something so big that Rick could never imagine it. Brooke does not want to talk about divorce or Quinn or anything like that. She just wants to have fun, maybe dance. She bobbles a little and Wyatt tries to get her to sit her drink down and just go on to bed. She calls him a Debby Downer. When he gets nowhere with Brooke he leaves. She continues to drink, is unsteady on her feet, trips and hits her head on the table and falls unconscious to floor.",
