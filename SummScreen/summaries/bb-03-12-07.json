Brooke told Ridge she couldn't leave Los Angeles on her business trip until he promised to cool it with Rick and Phoebe. Ridge promised that he would stay calm as long as Rick stayed away from his daughter. Not satisfied with that, Brooke warned Ridge that if he ever laid a hand on Rick again, he would lose her forever. Jackie eavesdropped outside and got an idea after hearing Brooke's ultimatum. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in Rick's office, Ashley dropped in and asked Rick one more time if he was sure he was okay with her working there.
