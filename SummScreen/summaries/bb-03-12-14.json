Hope looked toward the door, and Aly stepped away from the door.\n\n\nAfter Wyatt left, Hope sat alone, and Liam arrived. Hope smiled when Liam entered. Liam and Hope discussed that Brooke had gone straight to Katie's after the plane had landed when Hope, Wyatt, and Brooke had returned from Paris. Liam asked if Hope had heard anything, but Hope hadn't heard if Ridge and Katie had told Brooke about their relationship. Hope and Liam agreed they were happy to be able to talk about things -- especially something so awkward.\n\n\nLiam asked if Hope had moved in with Wyatt. Hope said they were taking it slowly and not living together. Liam teased that Hope and Wyatt had been to Hawaii, Paris, and off making headlines.\n\n\nLiam advised that Wyatt had been very fortunate in all the risky things he had done. Liam noted that Hope had enjoyed all the attention, but Liam warned that Wyatt would run out of luck and eventually get caught. Liam insisted that Hope deserved someone better than Wyatt. Hope noted that Liam had started to sound like Aly. Hope was proud of everything that she and Wyatt had accomplished.\n\n\nLiam professed that Wyatt would never understand Hope the way that Liam had. Liam showed Hope a tribute he had published to her in his magazine Eye on Fashion. Aly had been eavesdropping. Liam advised that Hope had saved her line -- not Wyatt.\n\n\nIn the main hall at Forrester, Quinn talked to Charlie and Pam. Quinn noted that Charlie had been watching her. Quinn crowed that since Wyatt had been serious about Hope, their careers at Forrester were very secure. Quinn left.\n\n\nCharlie and Pam agreed that Quinn had made a mistake in messing with Charlie and Quinn. Aly overheard Pam and Charlie. Later, Aly cornered Charlie and shared that Pam had told her what Wyatt had done.\n\n\nCharlie fell for the bait, and he shared the story of how Wyatt had stolen the diamond. Aly shouted that Wyatt was a criminal and should be punished. Charlie agreed that Wyatt had been trouble. Aly left to confront Hope.\n\n\nLater, Pam returned, and Charlie chastised Pam for telling Aly about Wyatt, but Pam was confused. In Wyatt's office, Quinn said that Charlie had irritated her and treated her like a criminal. Quinn became obsessed with Wyatt's happiness, and she claimed that no one would interfere with Wyatt and Hope's relationship.\n\n\nWyatt noted that they needed to make sure the showing of Stephanie's jewelry had integrity and class -- it could not be a publicity stunt. Quinn agreed. Wyatt felt they could win over the entire family with the event.\n\n\nWyatt worried about Aly's opinion. Wyatt said that he needed to promote the event as Hope carrying on Stephanie's example of grace and class. Quinn worried more about Aly.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was alone, and Liam entered. They argued about who belonged with Hope. Liam noted that Wyatt and Quinn hadn't achieved their success honestly. Liam told Wyatt how lucky Wyatt had been to have a second chance after the stunt he had pulled with the diamond.\n\n\nLiam said that Wyatt would eventually get caught. Wyatt argued that he had Hope and a job at Forrester, and he was never going to lose either one. \n\n\nIn Hope's office, Aly entered and angrily chastised Hope for letting Wyatt get away with stealing the diamond. Aly prepared to call the police, but Hope refused. Hope warned Aly not to say a word to anyone. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Aly tricks Charlie into telling her the truth about the diamond heist. Not realizing what he\u2019s done, Charlie believes that Pam told Aly something that they promised they would never tell. Wyatt attempts to convince Quinn that if this new collection is displayed right, they will win over all of their current office adversaries. Quinn shares that she\u2019s worried that Aly will be their downfall. Aly is surprised by Hope\u2019s reaction when she reveals a secret about Wyatt.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt and Hope are locked in a kiss in her office while Aly is lurking with the door ajar. He mentions locking the door but Hope blows that off. They share a few more kisses but she tells him he will be late for his meeting. He doesn't want to go but finally does. Charlie and Pam have their heads huddled talking about Aly when Quinn walks up and Pam tells Charlie diva alert. Quinn tells Charlie that she can see him watching her. He says it is his job. She offers that he is supposed to keep criminals out of the building not his eyes on trusted employees. Pam quips then it is too bad Charlie wasn't here the day she and Wyatt turned up at FC. Quinn says if they knew what was good for them they would keep their opinions to themselves. Aly is lurking and waits until Quinn leaves and Pam is called away from her desk. Aly approaches Charlie and casually mentions things would be better if she did not have to run into Quinn and Wyatt every time she turned around. Pam must confide in him; she's like to know what he knows about Wyatt. Pam told her everything. Charlie is surprised that Pam told Aly. Aly says it's because she got so worked up at the meeting the new campaign of Wyatt's, how he has changed Hope. He's destroying her reputation. Can Charlie imagine if people knew just how bad Wyatt really is. Charlie says yes, it is the charming ones you really have to look out for. You get comfortable and then let your guard down. He did not know he was going to have to look out for the guy that brought the diamond into Forrester. Aly rants \u0096 stupid diamond, that's when everything changed, Hope's line, her message. All that mattered to Wyatt was more publicity. Charlie smarts that yeah that is all that matters. Doesn't matter what happened to him when Wyatt's precious diamond goes missing for a couple of hours. Doesn't matter that Charlie was standing there by an empty display case looking like an idiot .Charlie's reputation and career toast while Wyatt slipped that hot rock in his pocket. Aly says no, Wyatt can not get away with this. Wyatt needs to learn that actions have consequences. Charlie agrees but Wyatt got all the consequences he wanted by landing HFTF right on the front page. Aly says but it was a lie, the thieves were arrested and made Wyatt look like a hero. They agree that Wyatt didn't want Hope to know or she'd recognize him for the con artist that he is. Aly says not only is Wyatt selfish and corrupt but he's a criminal and criminals deserve to be punished for the bad things they do. Wyatt tells Quinn that something has got her all worked up. He asks if Aly is throwing more shade. Quinn says it is Pam and her bumbling boyfriend. They are acting like the Fullers are here to take the petty cash when in actuality the company has made big profits since they have been here. Wyatt says she better not say that or Aly will just add it to all the other stuff she holds against them. Quinn tells him that she doesn't want him to waste one more minute worrying about that. The line is great; his idea was great, he and Hope are perfectly happy and nobody is going to interfere with any of that. He tells her he wants this promotion to be flawless. Hope is depending on him and he wants to show her that he can do this the right way. This is the Stephanie Forrester collection. It can't feel like a publicity stunt. Quinn says he is putting too much pressure on himself just thinking what Aly said in the meeting. But Eric knew Stephanie better than anyone and he thinks it is a great idea. Wyatt claims this has to be powerful. It has to have integrity and substance, no stunts. There are three people in the building gunning for them and he hopes they can win them over. She says she hopes so too but that Aly is trouble. He says she knows firsthand what kind of damage she can do. Quinn says she is like a high school girl with a crush. He says but her last name is Forrester and social media could make it news, the kind they don't want. Wyatt says he promised Hope no controversy. He doesn't think Aly knows anything. Quinn points out that Aly has been snooping around like a bad junior detective and if she gets a hint at anything she will not let it go. She reminds him that he almost lost his relationship with Hope over the diamond and she does not want to see that happen again. Liam surprises Hope when he stops by. He says he saw Wyatt leave so he thought he might have a few minutes alone with her. He'd heard she was back in town. She says yes and she was going to call him. He asks about her mom and if Hope is sorry that he told her. She says no, not at all. She is glad they can talk and be honest with each other even when it is hard to talk about. He says he is glad she feels that way as he has a few things to say about Wyatt. She says they are not living together. They are taking it slow. He says he is sorry. He'd just as soon she get this over as soon as possible. He says Mexico, Hawaii, Paris that is all fun but sooner or later she is going to want somebody who can give her more than headlines and diamonds \u0091cause everything Wyatt does is for effect and that has served him well but his luck will run out eventually. He tells her that Wyatt is not who she thinks he is and he does not deserve her. Hope says she is happy and she wishes he could be happy for her. He is beginning to sound like Aly. Liam is delighted to know Aly shares his views on Wyatt. Hope says she is sorry that Aly is disappointed in her but she is very proud of what she and Wyatt have accomplished. Aly is just caught in the past. She's upset that Hope is dating Wyatt and not with Liam. Liam laughs that he can't blame her; he's a little irked about that himself. He says but what really gets him is that Wyatt doesn't get her like he does. He brings out the new edition to Eye On Fashion looking at the new generation of style makers. Hope is surprised and impressed that it is a tribute to her. She knows Liam wrote that and she touches him on the face as thanks. He says everybody loves a good comeback story. Wyatt did not save her collection and neither did the diamond. Hope did by her choices that brought it back better than ever. Aly is lurking again and hears him say that Hope doesn't give herself enough credit but that is okay as he is going to be here to make sure she does. Liam leaves Hope's office and goes to see Wyatt in \"the big man's office\". Wyatt says they just finished a meeting and Liam may be subtle but he doesn't mind if he spoke with Hope. Liam says right as he's not the jealous type. Wyatt says not over Liam he is not. Liam retorts that right now Hope thinks Wyatt is some sort of savior pulling her line back from the brink. Wyatt says more than that, he pulled her back from Liam. She could have been married to him by now. He says he is very grateful to be part of this company and Hope in his life. Liam says he ought to be it's turned out just the way he and his mother hoped it would. And it would be one thing if he came about it honestly, but karma is a funny thing. Wyatt says that is too bad as he does not believe in karma. Liam says he does not trust Wyatt and apparently he is not the only one who feels that way .Wyatt's mask is slipping and it's only a matter of time before his lack of integrity catches up with him. Charlie tells Pam that they need to talk. They had agreed not to keep secrets so how could she let Aly in on their secret. Aly charges into Hope's office and says she was right about Wyatt and everything. Hope says they talked about this and Eric was very clear. And she know Aly doesn't like it but what she and Wyatt do is their business. Aly blurts out that Wyatt is a thief and responsible for the diamond heist. They can not let him get away with this. It was a crime and he lied to the police and the insurance company. Hope should be the one to tell them or else they may think she was involved. She starts to call the police and Hope tells her to put down the phone. She is not going to tell anyone. She is not going to say a word.",
