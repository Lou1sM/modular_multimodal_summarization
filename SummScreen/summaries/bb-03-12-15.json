    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Alcoholics' Anonymous meeting, Deacon tried to duck out, but the leader urged him to stay and listen to newcomer, Brooke, who was about to tell her story.\n\n\nBrooke explained that alcohol had never been a problem for her, but her drinking had increased that year. She'd thought that if she wasn't already an alcoholic at her age then she never would be. Brooke stated that she wasn't diagnosing herself; she was merely feeling lost.\n\n\nOthers shared their stories, and Deacon finally spoke. He explained that some might pass out for a day, but he'd passed out for years of his life. He'd been a mean drunk, unfit for his daughter. He'd gotten sober through meetings, and he'd become a better person despite himself.\n\n\nDeacon shared that he'd met a woman more desperate and needy than himself, and he'd actually been able to help her. He was excited to marry her, but he'd begun drinking again. He feared that he'd revert his old ways and poison everything good in his life.\n\n\nLater, the leader concluded the meeting by reminding everyone to keep the confidentiality of everyone else in the room. As people left, Deacon approached Brooke. He couldn't believe they'd wound up in the same meeting but was happy she wasn't letting her life go down the toilet.\n\n\nDeacon asked Brooke not to drink that day, and he said he wouldn't, either. Brooke repeated the step one mantra, but he said to take it seriously. He offered to let her call him if she wanted to drink and said he'd call her if he was on the edge. She didn't know why he'd do that and said she didn't know what she was doing. He joked that it was nice to have a friend with low expectations of him.\n\n\nAt Quinn's loft, Wyatt arrived with an envelope. Thinking it was a prenuptial agreement, Quinn refused to look at it. He said it wasn't, but he needed her to keep it in the safe for him. She wanted to know if it would self-destruct. She asked if it was his will or something for her to read in case he died. Frustrated, Wyatt wished she'd do what he asked without question.\n\n\nQuinn looked chastised, and Wyatt conveyed that the envelope contained his divorce papers. Quinn thought it was cowardly of Hope to have a lawyer drop the papers on him. Wyatt said the divorce had been his idea. He'd decided to stop kidding himself and to stop blaming and punishing Quinn.\n\n\nWyatt knew his mother was seriously off-center and that she'd say or do anything to get what she wanted. He said he and Quinn weren't admitting that he was the same way. Quinn told him not to say that, but he insisted that he was his mother.\n\n\nWyatt hadn't understood why the world wouldn't give him the one thing he'd wanted, so he'd chased Hope. He'd begged her, he'd flattered her, he'd tricked her, he'd stretched the truth, and he'd lied to her. \"And she loved me. Just not the same way that I loved her,\" he stated.\n\n\nWyatt had known that Hope hadn't chosen to stay with him for him, but he hadn't cared. Finally, it had dawned on him that he was his mother's son.\n\n\nQuinn asked if he'd tell Liam about it. Wyatt figured it was public record, and Liam would probably find out from Brooke. Wyatt had felt he'd needed to inform Brooke but murmured that it had probably been a mistake. Quinn almost started in on Brooke, but he said it hadn't been like that. He recalled that Brooke had been lonely, and it had been kind of sad.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Rick considered putting another desk in his office for Maya because she seemed to make everything run right for him. She said she didn't need an incentive like that to stay beside him. He informed her that his divorce would be finalized.\n\n\nMaya offered him whatever moral support he needed, but he said that her waiting at home was all the support he needed. Maya offered to make dinner for the special occasion. She was relieved to no longer be the other woman. Rick thanked her for her patience, and she thanked him for being the best thing to ever happen to her.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Nicole hacked into the home sound system. Her music blared through the house, and she began dancing. She found a letter on the mantel from Maya, who requested that Nicole remove her clothes from the dryer and make her bed because the housekeeper wouldn't do it for her. In the postscript, Maya said a little consideration was all she wanted. Nicole threw the letter into the fireplace, used a remote to turn on the flames, and continued dancing.\n\n\nLater, Maya arrived and shouted for Nicole to turn off the music. When Maya asked why the fireplace was on, Nicole claimed to be cold and noted that Maya was home early. Maya announced that it was a special day because Rick's divorce \"came through.\" Maya was planning a special celebration. \"So it's a great night for you to reconnect with your UCLA friends -- there,\" Maya decided.\n\n\nNicole remarked that two families could live there without Maya even knowing, so Nicole could stay out of the way without a problem. Maya asked if Nicole would really fight Maya on it. Nicole said she wasn't fighting, and life was compromise. Nicole commented that Rick liked her and didn't always want her out of the way. She said he might want her at the celebration and added that she was family.\n\n\nMaya felt that she'd made a perfectly reasonable request; however, she wasn't asking Nicole, she was telling Nicole to be somewhere else. \"And I'm telling you that I'm not going to be swept under the rug just because you're ashamed of me,\" Nicole asserted.\n\n\nMaya didn't know why she'd be ashamed of Nicole, who Maya hardly knew. \"And you're more educated,\" Maya added with a nervous laugh. Nicole proposed that they agree that she had just as much right to be there as Maya. Maya said it wasn't true. Maya stated that it was her home, but Nicole was a guest until she found somewhere else to stay. Nicole said she'd found the place.\n\n\nMaya disagreed, and Nicole suggested they ask Rick. Maya said Nicole had taken advantage of Rick's generosity long enough, and Maya offered to front Nicole's rent and deposit once they found her a new place to stay. Nicole refused to go anywhere, and Maya warned that it was a fight that Nicole wouldn't win. \"Wanna bet? I'm not leaving, and you know why,\" Nicole replied.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Carter entered and told Ridge that Caroline had messaged Carter to ask him to sit in on a divorce ratification meeting with Rick and Kris, Rick's attorney. Ridge relayed that Caroline was visiting her mothers in New York and had heard that the divorce would be final. Carter asked if she was okay, and Ridge said she was anxious to put Rick behind her.\n\n\nRick called the office to ask Caroline to join him in his meeting. Carter answered and said he'd sit in for Caroline. After the call, Ridge thanked Carter for looking out for Caroline.\n\n\nCarter crossed the hall to meet Kris and Rick. Kris doled out copies of the first divorce filing. Kris explained that there were some additions earmarked on the document, but the only area of concern was financial. Kris said Caroline's lawyer had reaffirmed that she didn't want spousal support. Rick didn't, either, so aside from the six-month waiting period, they were done.\n\n\n\"Well, done was what we wanted to be,\" Rick responded.\n\n\nKris exited, and Carter asked if Rick had any regrets. Rick was sorry he'd hurt Caroline. Surprised by the statement, Carter said no one had died, and though Caroline had been in pieces, she'd swept them all up. \"I just -- You know, if it hadn't been -- \" Rick started to say but cut himself off.\n\n\nCarter said there was still time, but Rick declined. Rick had loved Caroline, and it had broken his heart to lose her. \"But this is for the best,\" Rick concluded. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt comes over to Quinn's. He asks if Deacon is there and she says no. She sees the manila envelope and asks if he has more papers for her. He reminds her that he had the restraining offer withdrawn. She tells him that he can put that right in the shredder if it is prenup papers. She will never ask Deacon to sign one. Rick tells Maya that his divorce papers will be final. She tells him that she will be waiting for him at home and his divorce is his business. But at least now she won't be the other woman anymore. Ridge explains to Carter that Caroline is out of town with her mothers and her papers came today. He thinks she will be okay with that. Brooke gives a quick story of her suddenly drinking and how lost she feels. The counselor asks for more volunteers and Deacon stands. He tells his story that he has screwed up all of his life but he is going straight now and does not want to drink and mess it up again now that he is on the straight and narrow and actually helping other people. Wyatt tells Quinn not to ask questions, just put the papers in her safe as he does not want to see them. They are his divorce papers. He really wanted to wave them in her face and show her what her craziness did to him. He says but he understands now. He did the same thing. He chased Hope and he could not understand why the world would not hand her to him, the one thing he wanted so badly. He knew when Hope stayed with him that it wasn't for him. But at least she was close. Now he understands. He is his mother's son. Nicole is jiving to loud music in the living room and finds a note from Maya that tells her in certain terms to clean up after herself and make her bed as the housekeeper won't. Nicole just makes a frown and throws the note into the fireplace. Maya comes home and asks Nicole to turn off the music. She explains that this is a special day with Rick's divorce becoming final and she is going to fix a special supper. And this would be a good night for Nicole to hook back up with her UCLA friends at their place. Nicole counters back that Rick likes her and is not always trying to get rid of her so maybe she will stay. She is not going to go just because Maya is ashamed of her. Maya says she is not just asking, she is telling Nicole to go away tonight. Nicole says she has as much right to be here as Maya does. Maya says no, this is her home and Nicole is a guest here and she will take her apartment hunting tomorrow, even paying her first month. This is a fight she can not win. Nicole says she is not leaving and Maya knows why. Rick tells Carter that the only regret that he has is that he hurt Caroline so badly. Carter says there is still time. Rick says no, he did love her but this is for the best.",
