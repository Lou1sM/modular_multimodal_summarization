    "tvmega_recap": "Phoebe glances at the wedding invitation of Ridge and Brooke. She tells her dad if she can't see Rick, she doesn't feel like seeing her other friends. She understands Ridge's feelings, but she feels like Brooke has done a 180. Donna and Jackie lament the situation of the Forrester's not caring for Phoebe's feelings, but just their own, how this will look. They know Brooke and Nick were really happy and if Brooke and Ridge were to split up, they could be again. Stephanie spies them and even gloats that Jackie's precious Nicky may get Brooke back, how about that? They spy Phoebe in Insomnia and she doesn't look happy. If they could arrange for Rick and Phoebe to get together and Ridge find out about it, he would go crazy and Brooke in Australia, well .it could drive them apart for good. While dining separately, Rick sees Ashley and joins her. She asks if he's having dinner or making her his sale's pitch? He takes her hand as they reminisce about their special night in Paris and how exciting it was. She does find it ironic that he's now interested in a \u0091younger' woman. He assures her his issue with Ridge is a non-issue, it won't affect their business. Donna joins Phoebe and plays confidant, she is on her side. She plants the seeds in her head that if she really loves him, how can she let him go? She may not get another shot at true love. Sometimes in life you have to break the rules or end up being alone, like Donna.",
