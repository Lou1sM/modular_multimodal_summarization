    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Donna arrived, and Brooke told her sister that Katie and Ridge had become a couple. \"Who told you this?\" Donna incredulously asked. Brooke replied that Katie and Ridge had. Donna was perplexed as Brooke explained that Katie had faked fainting to stop the wedding.\n\n\nBrooke declared that there was no way that Brooke would hand Ridge over to Katie. Donna figured that Katie wasn't being herself, and there had to be an explanation. \"Maybe she needs to go back on her meds,\" Donna suggested. Brooke agreed and said it was mind-boggling.\n\n\nDonna hoped that Ridge and Katie wouldn't move in together. Brooke replied that it would be a disaster, and Donna added that everyone knew that Ridge and Brooke were supposed to end up together. Brooke said that Katie should know it, too, and if Katie didn't, she'd find out very soon.\n\n\nDonna guessed Brooke was relieved that her son didn't know about the wedding. Brooke couldn't believe that Ridge and Katie hadn't considered R.J. Just then, R.J. rushed in with a soccer trophy he'd won. He showed Brooke a picture of himself in his uniform and said he couldn't wait to show his father.\n\n\nR.J. went upstairs, and Brooke and Donna speculated about whether Katie was trying to pay Brooke back for what Brooke had done with Bill. Though Donna felt that the situations were similar, she said that Ridge bore some responsibility, too. Brooke believed that Ridge had been different and doing a lot of soul-searching since his return, and Katie was taking advantage of that.\n\n\nBrooke said Katie had painted her as superficial because she didn't read poetry with him like Katie did. Donna was astounded when Brooke revealed that Katie and Ridge had been connecting with the same poem Carter had read at the wedding, but Donna then recalled that Brooke had read poetry to Katie when they'd been kids.\n\n\nBrooke hated to call Katie a hypocrite and to be at odds with her sister. Though Brooke wanted Katie to be happy, Brooke declared that there was no way that she'd let Katie take the love of her life.\n\n\nIn the Forrester corridor, Charlie said that they had agreed to keep the diamond secret between them, but Pam had told Aly. Pam stated that she hadn't told Aly anything. Pam explained that Aly hated Wyatt and had used Charlie to get information. Feeling bad about the situation, Charlie said that he and Pam might not like Wyatt, but Charlie wasn't sure that they wanted Wyatt to go to jail.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office with Liam, Wyatt bragged that he was bulletproof, and there was nothing anyone -- including Liam -- could do to damage his relationships with Forrester and Hope. Liam advised Wyatt to keep being himself, and Liam was sure it would all catch up to Wyatt eventually.\n\n\nWyatt advised Liam to give it up, and Liam said no one was as two-faced as Wyatt -- except Quinn, who was entering the room at that moment. Quinn asked what Liam was doing there, and he said he was there about a feature on Hope. Quinn asked if he planned to do another Steffy tribute, too, and he quipped that he'd love to write about a mother-son duo gone bad.\n\n\nWyatt told Liam to stop clinging to what was no longer his and accept the fact that Wyatt and Quinn were there to stay. Liam declined to do that. He figured there were a lot of intelligent people working at Forrester, and Wyatt had already caused more problems than he was worth.\n\n\nLiam advised Wyatt not to delude himself into thinking he could fool everyone for much longer. Wyatt pretended to be terrified and asked his \"mommy\" for a hug. Quinn made a show of hugging and consoling Wyatt. Liam told Wyatt that he should be scared because the number of people onto Wyatt's games was growing and growing.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Hope told Aly that she couldn't let Aly call the police. Aly realized that Hope had known about Wyatt's misdeeds all along, and she couldn't believe that Hope was okay with it. Hope asserted that she wasn't okay with it; however, it was in the past, and they couldn't tell the police.\n\n\nHope said that Wyatt had done it for her, and it had been just a stupid publicity stunt. Hope stated that it was bigger than Wyatt, and they couldn't tell anyone because the stakes were too high. Aly figured that Wyatt had some kind of hold over Hope and that Hope had lost her way.\n\n\nAly insisted that she could help Hope, but Hope said she understood why Wyatt had done it. Aly felt that Wyatt had brainwashed Hope; however, Hope said that people made mistakes, and she'd forgiven Wyatt, who would never do anything like it again. Aly didn't buy it. She felt that Wyatt would do and say anything to get what he wanted. \"He's a criminal, Hope! A criminal!\" Aly asserted.\n\n\nAly felt that Wyatt needed to go to jail, but Hope pleaded with Aly to keep it a secret because it would be the end of Forrester and the HFTF line. Aly claimed that line had ended the moment Hope had taken up with Wyatt, the bully. Hope said it wasn't true, but Aly insisted that Wyatt needed to be stopped.\n\n\nHope asked Aly not to raise her voice to Hope, but Aly yelled that she couldn't believe Hope let that man put his hands on her. Aly said he only cared about money and sex. Aly didn't believe that Wyatt respected Hope like Liam did, but Hope said that Wyatt was wonderful to her. Hope claimed she'd never be with someone who mistreated her.\n\n\nAly replied that Wyatt was beneath Hope; however, Hope stated that it was her life, and Aly needed to stop worrying about it. Aly asserted that Hope should have married the honorable and decent man, but instead, she'd allowed Wyatt to desecrate her image. Aly insisted that Wyatt needed to go to prison. In a disquieted voice, Hope asked what was really going on with Aly.\n\n\nAly insisted that someone had to do something, but Hope conveyed that it wasn't Aly's place to get involved. Aly declared that if Hope wouldn't stop Wyatt, Aly would. Aly rushed out of the office, and Hope frantically called Wyatt to tell him that they had a huge problem.\n\n\nQuinn was listening as Hope informed Wyatt that Aly knew everything, and Wyatt asked Hope how \"the hell\" Aly had found out about the diamond. \"Little brat!\" Quinn exclaimed, marching out of the office.\n\n\nWyatt hurried across the hall to find out from Hope where Aly had gone. Hope didn't know, but she said Aly intended to talk to the police. Wyatt wondered how Aly had found out about it, and he mentioned that Liam had just been in his face, talking all kinds of \"crap\" to him. Hope was certain Liam hadn't told Aly, but she wondered what they were going to do.\n\n\nHope exclaimed that Aly wanted Wyatt in jail, but Wyatt was sure it wouldn't happen. He thanked Hope for trying to defend him to Aly, but he said that Aly wasn't \"right in the head.\" Hope wished that Aly would deal with Hope about the issues Aly had with Hope instead of taking them out on Wyatt. Wyatt felt that he was an easy target, and Hope said Aly didn't know the real him.\n\n\nHope thought that she and Wyatt should be prepared for the worst. Wyatt stated that if it got out, he'd take full responsibility. Hope didn't want to abandon him, but he assured her that he'd be fine. She said Aly could be with the police at that moment, and Hope wondered what could stop Aly.\n\n\nOutside, Aly was hurrying out of the building, and Quinn was hot on her heels. Quinn yelled for Aly to wait, but Aly shouted over her shoulder that she knew what Quinn's son had done. As Quinn told Aly to keep her voice down, Aly continued down the walkway bridge that extended over the street below. Aly yelled that Wyatt had stolen the diamond and pulled a fake heist.\n\n\nSnatching Aly's arm, Quinn whipped Aly around to face her. Quinn tried to explain that outing Wyatt would hurt the Forresters and their business. Aly insisted that she was doing the world a favor, and Wyatt Fuller would pay for his crimes. \"The hell he will,\" Quinn bit out in a determined voice.\n\n\nAly asserted that it was over; Quinn would go back to her warehouse and Wyatt to prison. Unafraid of Quinn, Aly said there was nothing Quinn could do to stop her. Quinn grabbed Aly and said to think carefully about it, but Aly dubbed Quinn a bully, just like Wyatt. Quinn told Aly not to do it because it would only end one way. Aly scoffed. \"Come on, little girl. Bring it on!\" Quinn raged.\n\n\nAly tried to push by Quinn, but Quinn grabbed her and shoved her backside over the railing of the walkway. With icy eyes, Quinn kept pushing Aly backward, and the top of Aly's torso hung over the railing as cars drove below her. \n\n\n",

    "imdb": "\nThings quickly go from bad to worse when Quinn confronts Aly on the Forrester Bridge.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Donna can hardly believe what Brooke is saying. Ridge and Katie spent some time together and now they are a couple in love. Brooke starts back when Katie fainted at her wedding. But there is no way she is going to give up and hand Ridge over to Katie. Hope holds the phone away from Aly so she can't call the police. She keeps repeating that Wyatt stole the diamond and the jewelry heist was a fake. Hope says she can not let her do that. Aly wonders why she is not more surprised. Now she knows that Hope already knew and was okay with it. Hope sighs and says she did not find out until after the fact. And she was not okay with it but it is in the past. Aly can not tell her father or Eric, can not call the police. She can not tell anybody. Aly contends they can not just let Wyatt get away with this. Hope confesses to her that it was a stupid publicity stunt but Wyatt did it for Hope, for her line. Aly still can't see why she is defending Wyatt. Hope says this is bigger than Wyatt. The stakes are too high if this leaks out. Aly says Wyatt has some sort of hold on Hope. She's lost her way but she can help Hope. He's brainwashed Hope and he is the reason she has neglected her values. Her message used to mean so much to Hope and it still does to Aly. But Hope threw it all away for a boy. Hope says Wyatt did something wrong. People do make mistakes but she forgave him and she knows he will never do anything like that again. Aly doesn't buy it and says Wyatt will do anything to get what he wants. He's a criminal. He needs to go to jail. Hope tells her if this gets out it will be catastrophic for the company, the end of HFTF. Aly fires back that HFTF ended the day that Wyatt came into her life. She has let him change her. Hope says no, she is still the same person but people change. She has just grown up. Aly says Wyatt has turned her into something she is not. He needs to be stopped. Hope tells Aly not to raise her voice to her like that. Aly continues her rant. She does not see how Hope can let that guy put his filthy hands all over her. All Wyatt cares about is money and sex and it's disgusting. He does not treat her with the respect that Liam does. Hope says Wyatt has been nothing but wonderful to her and she would never be with someone who mistreated her. It is her life, not Aly's, and Aly needs to stop worrying about her. Aly clinches both fists and says Hope should have married Liam, an honest, honorable man. Instead she chose Wyatt, the manipulator who desecrates and pollutes her message and image. Well no more, Wyatt has got to go to prison. Pam wants to know what Charlie is talking about. She did not tell Aly any secrets. Uh oh, he knows he must have slipped. Wyatt tells Liam that he is bullet-proof. There is nothing Liam can do to tarnish his reputation with FC or Hope for that matter. Liam says no, he will manage that all on his own. Wyatt says he knows Liam has wanted him gone for a long time now, but guess what \u0096 he is still here and better than ever. Liam warns him that just keep that arrogant, cocky appearance and watch his world crumble around him. It's all just a matter of time before it all catches up with him. Wyatt tells Liam to give it up, bro. It's over for him. Liam tells Wyatt he is so two faced. Nobody plays both sides quite like he does. Quinn walks in and immediately asks Liam why he is here again. He should have a job. Liam says he does and tells them about his tribute to Hope. Then says here is the story he'd like to break \u0096 the twisted tale of a mother/son duo gone bad. Wyatt chuckles. Liam continues that they are on the fast track to self-destruction and he can't wait to see them crash and burn. Quinn tells Liam that his behavior is so unbecoming. His dad would be embarrassed. Wyatt says Liam needs to let this go .stop clinging to the past. Hope is with him now. Liam says Wyatt and his mom have deluded themselves if they think they will be here much longer. Wyatt pretends that he is really terrified and asks his mommy for a hug. Liam says they really ought to be terrified as he is not the only ones onto them now and the list is growing and growing and growing. Charlie tells Pammie stupid him. He gave information to Aly without knowing it. He though she already knew about Wyatt. She seemed so innocent and yet she pulled the wool right over his eyes. No telling what she may do now. He knows they are not a big fan of Wyatt's but not sure they really want him to go to prison. Hope tells Aly it is not Aly's call and she has severely stepped over boundaries. Aly says somebody has to do something and if Hope is not, then she will. She bolts and Hope tries to catch her. But then turns back and calls Wyatt. She panics and says Aly just left and she knows about the jewelry heist. Wyatt repeats it and Quinn overhears and she runs out to find Aly. RJ rushes home to show Brooke his MVP soccer trophy and he can't wait to show his dad. Aly charges out of the building across the Forrester building bridge as Quinn catches up to her. She grabs her arm to stop her as both woman face each other. Quinn tells her she does not want to go to the police as it will hurt the company's reputation. Aly gnashes her teeth and says she is only exposing Wyatt for the liar he is. He is not a hero; he's nothing but a cheap criminal. Everybody will know now. Wyatt Fuller will pay for his crimes. Quinn clinches her teeth and says, \"the hell he will.\" Wyatt thanks Hope for trying to defend him to Aly but that isn't enough. Aly has some serious issues. She is not quite right in the head. Hope says maybe they should be prepared for the worst. Wyatt says this is all on him. He did this and he will take full responsibility for it and they will be fine. She is not to worry. Aly sneers at Quinn that Quinn can go back to her warehouse and Wyatt is going to prison. Quinn tells her if she knows anything at all about her, she knows she will do anything to protect her son. Inches from her face, Aly tells Quinn that she is not afraid of her. She is going to the police and there is nothing Quinn can do to stop her. Quinn jerks her around and says Aly does not want to do this. It can only end one way. Aly taunts her. Quinn tells her bring it on little girl. Aly tries to get past; Quinn blocks her and pushes her against the railing. Aly looks down backward with fear in her eyes.",
