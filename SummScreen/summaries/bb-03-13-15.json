Carter said he had to ask if Rick really wanted to go through with it. Carter offered to listen, but Rick acted as if all he wanted to do was conduct business.\n\n\nCarter understood why Rick was burying himself in work. Carter said it wasn't easy to end a relationship, and Carter couldn't imagine what it was like to end a marriage. Rick didn't want to debate about it and noted that Caroline hadn't even showed up for the divorce meeting.\n\n\nCarter said Caroline was in New York and hadn't expected the court to sign off that day. He suggested that Rick call her, but as he poured some drinks, Rick decided that marriage should end as it began -- with a toast. \"To Caroline and me. May we find more happiness apart than when we were together,\" Rick said and gulped his drink.\n\n\nRick stated that he didn't regret the marriage. Carter didn't think Caroline did, either. He asked if Rick had ever thought of how things had gotten that way. He figured it was a stupid question, but Rick said it wasn't. \"We both made mistakes,\" Rick quietly stated.\n\n\nCarter asked how things would be when Caroline was back in the office. Rick said they'd find a way to work together, and with the divorce out of the way, it might be easier. Carter, who'd presided over the wedding, had never imagined anything getting in the way of the couple's love and connection. He asked if Rick was really willing to throw it all away.\n\n\nRick stated that it had worked out as it had been meant to. Carter guessed it was easy for Rick, who'd been through a divorce before. Rick said that marriage wasn't easy, but he still believed marriage was possible with the right person; however, he hadn't been that person for Caroline or else she wouldn't have betrayed him.\n\n\nRick said he'd learned about relationships through watching his mother, who'd believed each time that a relationship would be different. With Maya, Rick didn't have to believe; he just knew.\n\n\nAlone in his office later, Rick sat down with his copy of the divorce papers. He flashed back over his love affair with Caroline.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Eric called a meeting with the staff to discuss Rick's quarterly report. Ridge noted that the entire staff got credit for the numbers, not just Rick. Eric stated that Rick got the credit because he was the leader and made the tough decisions that kept the business running at a profit.\n\n\nIvy couldn't argue with the numbers, just Rick's bedside manner. Eric agreed that Rick could improve upon it. Pam said Rick was making \"sort of\" an effort. Aly added that Rick seemed to be entertaining her shoe line. Eric acknowledged that everyone had problems with Rick, but the numbers had shown his worth as CEO. Eric hadn't wanted to see it at first, but he'd decided that Rick's relationship with Maya had made all the difference.\n\n\nThe subject turned to a big photo shoot that day. Oliver was surprised that Maya wasn't back in the building yet. Eric assumed she was staying away out of respect for Rick's divorce meeting, and Eric asked everyone else to give Rick space, too. Eric hadn't wanted a divorce for his son, but in his view, things had turned out really well with Maya and Rick. He expected the pair to do a great job.\n\n\nEric left, and Ivy asked if anyone else felt like gagging. She wondered if the reports meant that Rick would be in charge forever. Pam thought it should be Ridge. Ridge stated that Eric had a problem with Ridge, and no matter how Rick lied and acted out, Eric would trust Rick more.\n\n\nOliver left to prepare for the \"queen's\" photo shoot, and Ivy and Aly poked fun at Maya's uppity behavior. Ridge said Maya was untouchable, and it wouldn't change anytime soon.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Maya claimed not to know what Nicole was talking about. Maya said she'd stopped by the house to prepare before a photo shoot, and when she returned again, Nicole had better be gone. Nicole guessed their parents were right about Maya. In the rare times that her parents had spoken of Maya, Nicole had defended Maya. \"But if this is how you treat people...\" Nicole added.\n\n\nMaya asked what was so offensive about her wanting to celebrate Rick's divorce alone with him. She advised Nicole to crash on a friend's couch, and she and Nicole would apartment hunt in the morning, because living there was no longer an option for Nicole. Nicole said Maya had better make it an option because Nicole was starting to like the fancy house on the hill.\n\n\nMaya said Nicole knew the stay would be temporary and offered cash for a hotel. Nicole didn't want to be bought off. Maya said she was trying to help her sister. \"By kicking me out?\" Nicole asked. Maya said Nicole should be on campus, hanging out with her friends. Maya was sure Nicole didn't want to deal with Maya's curfews or rules.\n\n\nNicole didn't see why Maya had to set any. Maya said she understood why Nicole had traveled so far to go to school away from home, and it was time for Nicole to spread her wings. Nicole informed Maya that Nicole wasn't going anywhere. Maya asserted that it was her house, and she decided who lived there. Nicole corrected that it was Rick's house, and she was Rick's guest.\n\n\nMaya said Rick wouldn't let Nicole remain against Maya's wishes. Nicole reasoned that Rick wanted the sisters to get along and asked Maya to give it a chance. Maya wanted Nicole to see that Maya had just started her life with Rick, and it was too soon for Maya to have complications. Nicole hardly saw herself as a complication and noted that Aly and Ivy also stayed at the house.\n\n\nMaya claimed she was making arrangements for Aly and Ivy to stay somewhere else, too, that night, and Maya was sure the cousins would move out eventually. Nicole said she'd probably move out eventually, too, but she wondered why she couldn't enjoy how the other half lived for a while.\n\n\nNicole thought it was a compliment that she wanted to be like Maya, soar to the top, and live in Beverly Hills. Nicole told Maya to think of where she'd been. Maya didn't like to think of her past life and said there was a reason she'd left it. Nicole guessed that she was a reminder of it, but she advised Maya to get used to it because Maya's little sister was there to stay.\n\n\nMaya claimed not to be running from the past. Instead, she'd grown into the person she should be. She'd never thought she'd have the life she was leading, and she was grateful to Rick for what he'd given her. \"Just not grateful enough to share,\" Nicole concluded.\n\n\nMaya felt Nicole should have gratitude for staying there briefly and for Maya's willingness to help Nicole settle somewhere else. Nicole claimed to be beyond grateful, but she felt Maya could be more welcoming, \"considering.\" Maya said she owed Nicole nothing, and Nicole's attitude was wearing thin.\n\n\nNicole asserted that Maya was the hostile one. She figured that Maya was afraid of what Nicole might say in front of Rick. Nicole claimed she'd be more interested in keeping quiet if Maya opened her home and showed more respect. Maya said there was nothing to keep quiet about, and Rick already knew she'd been to jail. \"You know that's not what I'm talking about,\" Nicole replied.\n\n\nNicole didn't want to hear any more complaints about her attitude or any more talk of moving. Nicole said she knew Maya's secret, the secret Maya prayed Rick would never find out. Maya claimed not to know what Nicole was talking about, and she told Nicole to leave before one of them said something they'd regret.\n\n\nNicole warned Maya not to throw everything she'd worked for away by treating Nicole like garbage. Nicole said Rick didn't know Maya like Nicole did, and she contemplated telling Rick about the real Maya. Maya yelled that Nicole could never tell anyone what Nicole knew.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells the group that with Maya as his partner Rick's leadership has proved worthy. The profits are up despite it being a team effort with him as CEO. He admits that Rick can do better with his bedside manner and will work on that. Maya emphasizes again that she needs to go to a photo shoot but she expects Nicole to be gone when she returns. She can spend the night on the dorm couch for one night and they will go apartment hunting tomorrow. Nicole smiles and says no need, she is beginning to like this place, high on the hill and she is not leaving. It is starting to feel like home. Maya tells her it is time that she spread her wings and she will help her. Eric tells them that Rick's divorce came through today so they should all give him some respect. Rick tells Carter that he was not the one who ended things but this is for the best and he is not changing his mind. He pours himself and Carter a drink and makes a toast ..may they find more happiness apart than together. He doesn't regret their marriage but they both made mistakes to get here. Carter says he married them and he can not believe Rick is going to throw that all away. Rick muses that he still believes in marriage with the right person but that was not Caroline. He drags in his mother again and watching her time and time again bow to Ridge and that will not happen with Maya. He believes in her. Maya tells Nicole this is her house and she decides who gets to live or stay here. She wants to be closer to Nicole but that won't happen if they are constantly at each other's throats. Nicole says she is not a complication and she won't be in the way. Ivy and Aly have boyfriends and may move out eventually so in time so may she but not now. She just moved in. She tells Maya she might as well get used to it; little sister is here to stay. Oliver says he is all for the company to be doing so well but he can't be the only one to want Rick to go forward. Ridge says no matter what Rick does to act out his dad still trusts him more. And it does not look like it will change anytime soon. Maya tells Nicole that she is doing her best. They have reconnected and Nicole has moved in and she could be more grateful. Nicole says she would like more than grateful, how about more welcoming? Maya says Rick already knows about her jail time and that is in the past and does not bother him. Nicole reminds her that her secret is much more than that, so better wise up and accept Nicole living there as she does not intend to go anywhere. Rick sits and ponders over the papers and his life so far with Caroline when they met and married. Maya tells Nicole there is no secrets and Nicole needs to leave before they both say something they will regret. Nicole says she knows how hard Maya has worked to get all of this but that doesn't give her the right to treat Nicole like garbage. She knows the secret that Rick does not know because he does not know the real Maya. With fire and tears in her eyes Maya demands that Nicole say nothing to anyone.",
