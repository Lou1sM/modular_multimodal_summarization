Though she was disappointed, Taylor left so Nick could spend some quality time with his favorite little girl. Hope told him that Brooke was in Australia, and Nick showed her where that was on the globe. Jackie happily watched as the two bonded. \n\n\nWhen Nick and Jackie were alone, Nick scolded her for showing up unannounced with Hope. He admitted that being around Hope made him realize how much he missed her. Jackie didn't understand why Nick was getting involved with Taylor when he would be so much happier with Brooke. She believed the Phoebe/Rick situation could split Brooke and Ridge up for good and urged Nick to pursue Brooke. Tired of the drama, Nick told his mother once more to leave it alone.\n\n\nAt the Caf\u00e9 Russe, Rick and Ashley reminisced about Rick serenading her. He told her he was not getting to sing as much as he liked anymore because he had to focus on business. Trying to convince her to work at Forrester, Rick went on about how she and Abby needed a fresh start and assured her that she would be greatly appreciated by the company. Persuaded by his charm, Ashley accepted the offer, and they shared a toast. \n\n\nToo tired to drink much, Ashley said she would prefer a cappuccino, and Rick suggested the perfect place to get one. Getting a little flirty, Ashley told Rick he was a very persuasive man, and she couldn't seem to say no to him that night.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Insomnia, Donna advised Phoebe to hold on to Rick at all costs. Phoebe worried about going against her father's wishes and causing problems in his relationship with Brooke. Donna thought Phoebe was smart enough to take care of herself and should not allow Ridge to control her love life. Donna went on to ask her if she was willing to wait months or maybe even years for Ridge to change his mind. \n\n\nWhen Phoebe said she could wait, Donna pointed out that Rick might not be able to. She then added that if Brooke and Ridge's relationship were strong enough, nothing would mess it up. Continuing with her persuasive tactics, Donna said Phoebe and Rick deserved to be happy just as much as Brooke and Ridge did. Donna warned Phoebe that if she didn't fight for that love, she would regret it for the rest of her life. Phoebe admitted how much she hated not being able to show Rick how she felt. \n\n\nBefore Donna and Phoebe could talk further, Ashley and Rick walked in. Once they got to the table, a jealous Phoebe whined to Rick about not being able to get in touch with him all night and said she knew why. Rick smoothly explained that he and Ashley had been having a business dinner, and he'd had his phone off. Sensing the tension, Ashley and Donna quickly excused themselves, leaving Phoebe and Rick alone. \n\n\nPhoebe told Rick that she didn't want to allow Ridge and Brooke to dictate their lives anymore. Ashley and Donna observed from afar as the two lovebirds embraced and kissed. Donna excitedly called Jackie and reported that Rick and Phoebe were together and definitely in love. Donna predicted that Ridge would go berserk on Rick when he found out and would end up losing Brooke forever. \n\n\n",
