She teased that it wouldn't be a good idea for the bride and groom to miss the flight to their own wedding.\n\n\nAfter Steffy and Liam were packed, Bill showed up and asked it they were ready to go. Liam thanked him for attending the wedding with them. \"My Spencer senses are tingling,\" Liam teased. He noted that Bill was not wearing his Spencer necklace. Bill said he had decided to give it a rest. Liam was surprised.\n\n\nAt Eric's house, he and Quinn also prepared for the trip to Australia. Quinn marveled at how much her life had changed. She was attending Steffy's wedding as Eric's wife -- an accepted member of the family. She was amazed at how things had turned out.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Ridge and Brooke met with R.J., and they were worried that he was not making the trip to Australia with them. R.J. said that as long as they returned to Los Angeles as Mr. and Mrs., he was fine with staying behind.\n\n\nBrooke teased that R.J. wanted to spend more time with Coco. R.J. laughed and said he realized there was \"no fun while you're gone.\" Katie entered and asked R.J. to help Donna with Will while Katie was in Australia at Brooke and Ridge's wedding. R.J. agreed as long as Katie ensured that Brooke and Ridge got married. Katie promised she would do her best.\n\n\n\"Nothing is going to stand in our way this time,\" Brooke cooed. R.J. teased that his parents were \"all grown up and ready to settle down. Especially you, Dad.\" Ridge nuzzled and kissed Brooke's neck.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally discussed bolts of expensive fabric with Darlita, and Thomas entered and interrupted. Darlita drooled over Thomas, and she left. Thomas told Sally that he was heading to his sister's wedding in Australia.\n\n\nThomas teased that he would have taken Sally as his date if he could have. Sally remarked that it was a glorious destination wedding, but he would really have to want to stick to Steffy if he'd invited her. Thomas said he thought they'd have a lot of fun together.\n\n\nSally teased that they would really \"set the barbie on fire.\" \"What if I showed up?\" Sally asked. \"I hope you do,\" Thomas said. He left.\n\n\nLater, Darlita told Shirley and Saul that \"dreamy Thomas Forrester\" had been there. Shirley was interested, but she was distracted because of the high-end fabric that Sally had purchased. Shirley asked Darlita for the invoice and told Sally she would have to sell it. Saul said they would never get full price for fabric.\n\n\nShirley warned that when they made knockoffs, they had to cut costs everywhere. Saul worried that Thomas had visited because he was suspicious. Sally calmed both Shirley and Thomas. She explained that Thomas was headed to his sister's wedding in Australia. \"If I were in Sydney, I would be going -- invited as Thomas' date,\" Sally boasted.\n\n\nShirley, Saul, Darlita, and Sally imagined the look on Steffy's face if Sally showed up. Saul said it obviously had not been a serious invitation. Shirley countered that they had to get Sally to Sydney. Saul argued that Sally couldn't go to the wedding.\n\n\nSally reminded everyone that she couldn't afford a bus pass, let alone a plane ticket. \"Think of the publicity. I like this guy,\" Shirley said. She added that if they had pictures of Sally as Thomas' girlfriend at Steffy's wedding and posted them to their website, they'd have millions of hits.\n\n\nShirley ordered Darlita to book Sally a flight. They had to find the money. Saul continued to argue that Sally couldn't keep up with a guy like Thomas. Sally was offended. \"Book me a flight,\" she said. She added that it had to be the cheapest and fastest flight to Australia.\n\n\nLater, Darlita had found Sally a flight that left later that evening. Sally had never heard of the discount airline before, but she agreed to go. Saul worried that it would be a disaster, but Shirley said no one would accuse Thomas' girlfriend of anything. Sally said she planned to behave like a lady and would be honored to be Thomas' date. They booked the flight.\n\n\nAt the airport, Steffy, Liam, Ivy, Thomas, Bill, Katie, Eric, and Quinn gathered in the airplane. A flight attendant welcomed them aboard and offered Champagne. Steffy and Liam thanked everyone for making the trip with them. They all clapped.\n\n\nEric and Quinn kissed and discussed that Quinn never had to worry about the family again. Brooke and Ridge discussed getting married, and Brooke asked Ridge to get her another pillow for the flight.\n\n\nKatie spied on Ridge and Quinn when he walked past her to get a pillow. Bill stopped to greet Katie then he visited Brooke. He hoped she had a good flight, he said.\n\n\nIvy and Thomas discussed the itinerary in Australia, and Ivy offered to organize a surfboard outing for Thomas. He agreed. Ivy told Thomas that she was surprised he hadn't been accompanied by a date. He smiled. He flashed back to kissing Sally.\n\n\nSteffy told Liam that she was amazed that Liam's dad had decided to attend. She added that it all seemed to be going well. Bill asked Katie about Will, and she said that he was \"happy as a clam, spoiled by Aunt Donna.\" Katie was happy to see Bill. \"I'm glad to be here for Liam and Steffy,\" Bill said. Katie noticed that Bill's sword necklace was missing. He said he had removed it.\n\n\nEric and Quinn told Ridge and Brooke they were headed to the lounge, but Brooke was ready to get some sleep. Eric wondered if Brooke and Ridge had practiced their vows. Brooke promised they would have no difficulty putting their feelings into words. Ridge and Brooke kissed, and Quinn looked on.\n\n\nKatie watched Quinn's reaction to Brooke and Ridge kissing. Ridge eyed Quinn as she walked away. Bill told Katie that he had been convinced Ridge would do something to ruin the wedding. Katie hoped he didn't do anything to mess up, and Bill said she clearly had her doubts.\n\n\nEric and Quinn cuddled and discussed how blessed the family had been. Quinn flashed back to kissing Ridge. She quickly caressed Eric, and they expressed their love for each other. They kissed and hugged.\n\n\n",
