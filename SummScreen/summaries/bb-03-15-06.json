Stephanie objects, telling him she wants no funerals or obituaries for her daughter.  Eric tells her the whole family needs closure and to be able to say goodbye to Felicia.  Stephanie feels they already said goodbye to Felicia with their champagne toast. Eric offers to help Stephanie with all of the arrangements and asks her where Felicia's body is.  Stephanie refuses his help and tells him she wants to handle the arrangements on her own.  Eric thinks Stephanie is in denial about Felicia's death. \n\n\nMeanwhile at Brooke's, Nick calls her and tells her he forgives her for her \"comforting\" bedside manner with Ridge.  He makes a joke of his whole indiscretion with Taylor, by telling Brooke that she knows he prefers blondes.  Nick playfully tells \nBrooke that he is not trying to pressure her, but there are many blondes in LA.  \nBrooke laughs and tells him she will remember that.  When she gets off the phone with Nick, Taylor drops by to grovel.  Taylor tells Brooke nothing happened between her and Nick and there is no reason for Ridge to find out about it.  Brooke does not understand why Taylor is so worried since she is no longer married to Ridge.  Taylor said she is worried it will just make Ridge and Nick's relationship more strained, and it will upset her children.  Brooke tells her she should have been more concerned about all that before she got all liquored up and fell in the bed with Nick.  Brooke asks Taylor what is wrong with her, first Hector and now Nick.  Taylor replies she has not been the same since Ridge dumped her for Brooke.  She tells Brooke she does not blame her for Ridge's decision and that Brooke should not blame Nick for this ridiculous misunderstanding.  Taylor wants Brooke to know how much Nick loves her and that she should not give up on him.    Brooke tells Taylor the only reason she is concerned about this situation is because she wants Ridge back. Taylor denies that is the reason; she says she knows what a big sacrifice Brooke made giving up Nick for Bridget.  Brooke tells her she does not want Bridget to ever know that Taylor and Nick were in bed together.   Brooke says she is not going to tell anyone about it because she does not want Bridget to get hurt again.  Brooke thinks Bridget would be devastated, after making such a huge sacrifice, to learn Nick had jumped into bed with Taylor.  Taylor thinks Brooke is making a wise decision Brooke warns Taylor she better be careful with her drinking or she's going to end up in a situation that she can't talk her way out of so easily.\n\n\nBack at the Forresters', Eric is staring at a picture of Felicia when Jackie walks in.  \nJackie offers her condolences and tells him that Felicia was an incredible woman.  She asks him how he is doing and he tells her he is worried about Stephanie because she is avoiding the family and keeping to herself. He tells her Stephanie refuses to accept any help with the arrangements and does not even want to have a funeral because she does not think that is what Felicia would have wanted.  Jackie is shocked. Eric thinks Stephanie wants to pretend like Felicia is not dead. He says Stephanie will not even tell him what funeral home Felicia is in.  Jackie says Stephanie is obviously just grief stricken.  Eric says Stephanie blames the whole family for letting Felicia die.  \nJackie tells him he did everything he could for his daughter.  Jackie says Felicia was ready to go Stephanie was just not ready to let her.\n\n\nMeanwhile at the Marlin, Taylor comes by to see Nick and apologize for all the trouble \nshe caused.  Taylor tells him Brooke still loves him and he should not give up on her.  \nAs she is leaving, Nick stops her and tells her its not all her fault, he screwed up too.  \nHe says he should have gone home instead of staying at the bar and drinking.  She says it is understandable, because he was in a lot of pain.  Taylor tells Nick she felt a bond with him because they were both going through the same kind of pain.  Taylor opens up to Nick, telling him that last night was not the first night since Ridge left her that she had too much to drink.  She says her dad had a drinking problem after her mom died, and she realizes the tragedies drinking can cause a family.  Taylor confesses she is scared she is getting too dependent on alcohol.  Nick embraces her as she begins to cry. She tells Nick the only time she hasn't felt pain since Ridge left her were a few moments last night when she was in Nick's arms.\n\n\nAcross town in a mysterious office, Stephanie confers with a man about Felicia.  She tells him she is getting pressure from her husband to have a funeral. Stephanie says she cannot bear telling her grandson one day that she just let his mother die.  The man assures Stephanie, that Felicia is in very good hands and is resting peacefully.  Stephanie tells him she wants to see her daughter.   He takes her to a hospital room where an unconscious Felicia is lying in the bed.  Stephanie asks the man when he will be beginning the procedure and he says as soon as the paper work is done. She tells him \nFelicia has so much to live for.  He tells her he hopes a liver transplant will give Felicia more time, but first they have to get the cancer under control with more chemo.  Stephanie asks him to give her some time alone with Felicia.  After he leaves, she sits down by Felicia's bed, and tells her she is safe and that she was brought here because they detected her pulse in the ambulance. Stephanie tells Felicia if this procedure works, it will buy her time to live and be a mother.\n\n\n",

Eric tells Stephanie that they must arrange a funeral for Felicia, but Stephanie refuses to discuss it. Jackie later visits Eric and she agrees that Stephanie's behavior is strange. Stephanie visits with a doctor and talks to him about Felicia. Stephanie later sits by Felicia's side, as she is connected up to machines and is still alive.\r\n",

He tells her he understands her loss, but she has to accept she's gone now. She says to hell she does. Nick calls Brooke and tells her she can have all the time and space she needs but remember that he loves her. Taylor pays Brooke a visit which Brooke views as damage control. Taylor doesn't want her to say anything to make things worse between the two brothers, Nick and Ridge, and the children. Brooke sees it as Taylor wanting her to pick Nick so that will leave Ridge for Taylor. She will do this for Bridget, to protect her memory of Nick, but not for Taylor or anybody else. Taylor then pays Nick another visit and apologizes for any trouble she caused. No grudges, he accepts her apology. He's to blame too; misery does love company. She even confesses her dependency on alcohol and he hugs her in comfort. Jackie shows up at Eric's and comforts him about Felicia. He confides about Stephanie. It's like if she doesn't acknowledge Felicia's death, it never happened. Stephanie meets with a mysterious stranger and then he shows her in to a comatose Felicia, hooked up to tubes.
