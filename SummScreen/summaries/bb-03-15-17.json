They vowed their third wedding would be the final time. They discussed their hope that everyone enjoyed the trip. Steffy was glad they were all together as a family, but she wished they had invited more people. Liam agreed, and he promised they would make sure everyone was included when they brought back pictures.\n\n\nSteffy was glad that Sally Spectra wouldn't be there. Liam wondered why Sally would show up -- \"to shove your face in another cake?\" Steffy worried that Thomas liked her. \"She's a total headache,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nNearby, Ridge and Brooke canoodled and cooed that she would soon be Mrs. Forrester. Brooke said that R.J. had sent a message to watch out for the kangaroos. They laughed about it and about him being so thrilled his parents were getting married again.\n\n\nAcross the seating aisle, Katie and Bill discussed what to get for Will as a souvenir. Bill said they should buy a stuffed koala bear. Katie laughed that Bill should buy him a real one. They agreed that they got along better since they had been divorced. \"Marriage, who needs it? Tell the same thing to your sister,\" Bill said. Katie realized it wasn't easy for Bill to be there. Bill worried that Brooke was going to marry Ridge, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. Katie looked pensive.\n\n\nThomas and Steffy discussed that she owed a lot to Ivy for planning the trip. Steffy said that even Liam was in the dark about the exact location of their wedding. Thomas took a selfie, and Steffy wanted to be in it, but Thomas declined. She said he would get more likes on social media with her in it, but he said he had sent it to someone, and Steffy guessed she knew who it was. Steffy was miffed, but Thomas said it hadn't sent.\n\n\nEric and Quinn remarked that they had enjoyed the trip. Quinn was thrilled to be a part of the Forrester family wedding trip. Eric decided to talk to Brooke, and he asked Ridge to trade seats with him for a few minutes. He told Brooke how thrilled he was about their wedding. \"Ridge finally realized there's no one better for him,\" Eric said. He added that he'd always been her biggest fan. They discussed that Eric felt he could finally trust Ridge again.\n\n\nRidge visited with Quinn, and she said he looked refreshed. Ridge said he was. Quinn said it was fun to have all of them together. She was thrilled to be a part of the wedding trip. Katie spied on them.\n\n\nQuinn remarked that Ridge would soon be a married man. She wondered if they had selected a spot for their elopement. Ridge said they would do what was best for them. She thanked him for making her feel like a part of the family.\n\n\nQuinn walked away from Ridge, and he followed. So did Katie. Quinn told him that she had always wanted to be part of a real family and didn't want to lose Eric. Ridge agreed and said he would make sure of it. They smiled at each other and grabbed hands. Katie watched.\n\n\nOn the runway in Los Angeles, Sally sat in the center seat in a row of seats on the airplane, and she was trapped between seatmates Kieran and Matt \"from the great state of Kansas,\" Matt said. They were the same travelers who had been on a plane with Quinn in 2016. Sally offered to scoot over to another seat, but Matt and Kieran told her that Kieran had to have a window seat, and Matt needed the aisle seat. They claimed they had made a lot of friends with their seating arrangements.\n\n\nThe couple rearranged everything to accommodate their bags under the seats in front of them. They begged Sally to use the room under the seat in front of her. They wondered what Sally did for a living, and she explained that she was a clothing designer. Sally discovered there was no Wi-Fi on the plane, so she asked the flight attendant for a bloody Mary.\n\n\nMatt and Kieran said they didn't drink. Matt explained that he had been a partier and had quit drinking when they'd gotten married. He said he loved a six-pack.\n\n\nMatt said it was time for a snack. He pulled out a bacon burger and offered to share with Sally, but she declined. Kieran agreed to a bite, and Matt sneezed all over them. He said Kieran had been sick for a week with a very contagious virus. Sally explained that she was on her way to surprise a man she'd met. Matt and Kieran said it was romantic.\n\n\nIn Australia, Ivy guided the Forresters and Spencers around some scenic areas that included the opera house. She hinted that Steffy and Liam would be getting married nearby. Liam and Steffy kissed in front of the opera house, and Eric called it stunning architecture.\n\n\nIvy promised to take the Forrester and Spencer clans to the beach and botanical gardens so Ridge and Brooke could check out the view. Katie said she needed to speak to Brooke. Katie pulled Brooke aside and said that she had seen Ridge and Quinn together and holding hands on the plane.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Katie that she and Ridge had struggled for 30 years to be together, and there was no way Ridge would jeopardize it for Quinn. Katie insisted that Brooke had to speak to him. Brooke looked at Ridge in the distance, and he was talking to Quinn.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "The Forrester and Spectras enjoy their luxurious travels to Australia. Steffy and Liam look forward to their wedding whereas Katie sympathizes with ex-husband Bill as he watches Brooke canoodling with Ridge. When Ridge and Quinn sneak off in a more private area of the cabin Katie has a watchful eye on them as she still suspects them having an affair. Thomas begins to miss Sally already and decides to send her a selfie which, to his surprise, does not come through - Meanwhile, Sally boards her flight to Sydney and soon finds out that the journey will come completely no-thrills. Regular Discount Airways passengers Matt and Kieran Cannistra from Kansas, with whom Quinn was traveling to Monte Carlo last year, are Sally's strenuous seat mates on this lengthy flight. After landing, Ivy leads the bride, groom and the rest of the wedding party to the Sydney Opera House to give them a first impression of their traveling destination. As everyone gushes at the sight of the spectacular building Katie takes Brooke to the side to inform her sister that Ridge and Quinn continue to act strangely.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody on the flight enjoys the delicious food. Katie realizes Bill is keeping her company but does not enjoy his direct view of the lovebirds, Brooke and Ridge. Eric tells Quinn that he loves that smile and she replies she has a lot to smile about . .being part of a Forrester wedding party trip. Over on another flight Sally has managed a seat on Discount Airlines and is suddenly surrounded by a couple where one has to have the aisle seat and the other window so poor Sally is caught squished in between. She wants to change seats but the attendant reminds them they need to be quickly seated so there is no time. They seem to spend most of their time fighting and scampering for a bag of peanuts and the guy shakes hands with Sally with his sweaty palms. Later he takes the cold neck brace pillow from around his neck and puts it on Sally. He's ready for a snack, a bison bacon sandwich and he foists a bite upon Sally and then the missus on the other side wants one too, puts on her throw and snuggles up to Sally saying she is cold. As Ridge leaves, Eric takes his seat with Brooke and they marvel that there will be two weddings. He says he could not be more pleased as Ridge has looked the world over and finally decided there is no one better for him than her. Ridge ends up having to sit with Quinn and she is grateful to be along for the ride. She tells him his life is about to change as he is about to become a married man. He says he just wants to keep is simple so he is sorry she is not invited. She is just glad that he accepted her. It is an honor and a privilege. Katie strains her neck to see what she can see and overhear. She watches as both Quinn and Ridge leave their seats and go further into the cabin. Quinn tells Ridge that she never wants to lose his father. They grasp all four of their hands and he asks if she is sure. Steffy says she is glad Sally Spectra isn't here. Liam says why should she be ..just to shove her face in another piece of cake is a bit of a stretch. The seat mates from hell continue their annoyance and Sally is about ready to barf when the fellow gets a case of the sniffles and starts sneezing all over Sally. Finally the Forrester group land in Sydney led by Ivy who shows them around. Katie finally manages to drag Brooke away and says she needs to talk to her. This is too important and cannot wait. She tells Brooke that on the plane Ridge and Quinn were holding hands and it was intimate. She keeps saying she is not crazy and Brooke needs to talk to Ridge and get to the bottom of this. Brooke assures her she is just wrong. They flew half way around the world to say their vows and there is no way he would jeopardize that for her! Katie begs her one more time to talk to Ridge before it is too late.",
