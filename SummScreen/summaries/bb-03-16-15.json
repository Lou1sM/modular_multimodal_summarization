Maya asserted that Nicole knew nothing and told her to get out. Nicole figured that Rick would wonder why she was gone. Maya said Nicole had nerve to be in Maya's house, making accusations. Nicole didn't see the problem -- if the secret wasn't true.\n\n\nAt Forrester, the photo shoot commenced at the sky lounge. Oliver was almost ready for the next setup, but Maya wasn't there yet. Rick said it wasn't like Maya, but he'd text-messaged her twice.\n\n\nJust as everyone was beginning to get anxious about Maya's absence, Maya rushed in and apologized for being late. Aly asked where Maya had been, and Maya murmured to Rick that she'd had to deal with something. Wardrobe and makeup converged on Maya, turning her into a diva in a black angled web-like gown. Rick tried to figure out why she was nervous, but Oliver started the shoot.\n\n\n\"Stop Being a Good Girl\" played as Maya modeled. She got into the groove of the photo shoot and relaxed, but once Maya saw Nicole standing behind Rick, Maya's smiles faded. Oliver called for a break in the shoot, and Rick greeted Nicole.\n\n\nNicole approached Maya to talk about how glamorous and fun the shoot was. A tight-lipped Maya suggested Nicole leave and return another day for a fashion show or at a time when Maya's lateness hadn't made a shoot rushed.\n\n\nRick urged Nicole to stick around, and Oliver resumed the shoot. All of Maya's modeling magic faded, and Oliver asked what was bothering her. Rick asked why the shoot was lagging, and Maya decided she was tired. Rick called it a day, saying he thought they had what they needed.\n\n\nAs the employees reviewed the pictures, Nicole hoped she hadn't been in the way. Rick said she was family and was welcome anytime. Carter, Oliver, and Aly took off, and Maya reminded Rick of a phone interview he had to conduct.\n\n\nOnce Maya was alone with her sister, Maya complained about Nicole being there. Maya felt it was bad enough that Nicole had infiltrated Maya's home, but Forrester was Maya's livelihood. Nicole said modeling was a prestigious job, and she could use some work, too. Maya stated that they weren't hiring interns. Nicole didn't want to intern. She wanted to model. \"Make it happen,\" Nicole said, smiling.\n\n\nThe suggestion disconcerted Maya, but Nicole said she had the same genes as Maya. Maya stated that Nicole was into computer programming. Striking a pose, Nicole claimed that putting on expensive clothes and smiling for the camera wasn't rocket science. Maya declared that she didn't want Nicole working there or living in Maya's house.\n\n\nNicole asked if Maya was sure she wanted to talk to Nicole that way. Nicole decided to let Maya get back to her thing but asked what was for dinner. \"You cannot be serious,\" Maya snipped. Nicole noted that Rick had invited her into his home, and Nicole wasn't afraid to use Maya's secret. Maya was outraged that her sister would try to blackmail and control her.\n\n\nJust then, Rick arrived and asked what was going on.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Aly, Oliver, and Carter pondered what was going on with Maya and Nicole. Oliver and Aly suspected that Nicole's visit had overwhelmed Maya, but Carter didn't think hosting family should be that big of a deal. Oliver sensed that something was going on that they didn't know about.\n\n\nAt Ridge's loft, Katie arrived and noted that he'd finally gotten the loft he'd always wanted. He said it was away from work distractions, and Katie assumed he meant Rick and Maya. Katie was shocked to peek beneath a tarp and discover Caroline's sultry portrait beneath it.\n\n\nKatie guessed that Caroline was inspiring more than fashion in Ridge. Katie also assumed that Caroline appreciated Ridge's support through the divorce. Ridge acted surprised to know that there was a six-month waiting period for a divorce. Ridge said Caroline hadn't planned on getting a divorce, but she had given her marriage a shot with all her heart.\n\n\nKatie suddenly decided that she shouldn't just be showing up there because she could be interrupting Ridge and his muse. Ridge said they knew each other, but Katie figured they were redefining who they were. Ridge asked how Bill was treating her, and Katie said she liked it. Ridge remarked that Aspen had been an interesting honeymoon destination.\n\n\nKatie admitted that she'd been telling people she and Bill had chosen it to be close to Will, but in truth, she'd wanted to reclaim Aspen, which had been a huge part of Brooke and Bill's relationship. Katie had wanted to reclaim it for Bill and Katie, and she felt she'd done it. She said she didn't cringe at the city's name anymore\n\n\nRidge was glad to hear that Katie was happy. Katie was glad he finally had his place to create. Ridge said she'd always given him what he'd wanted, and it hadn't been that he'd needed a space away from her to create. Katie said it was a place he could share with his muse.\n\n\nRidge guessed they were each happy, and Katie wished Brooke was, too. Katie was there to discuss her concerns about Brooke, who seemed off to Katie. Ridge asked what Donna thought. Donna hadn't given much feedback to Katie. Brooke had visited Donna and Will but had seemed aloof. Katie didn't like to think of Brooke being alone, but Ridge stated that Brooke was never alone.\n\n\nKatie agreed, and she was anxious to know how Brooke was dealing with it. Katie asked if Ridge had talked to Brooke. Ridge hadn't seen Brooke or talked to her. Katie was headed to Brooke's house next, but she planned to pick up Bill first. Ridge asked if that was a good idea.\n\n\nKatie didn't know if it was or not, but she was trying to not to appear as if she was checking up on her sister. Ridge stated that she was doing exactly that. Katie said she wanted to be there for Brooke, who didn't do well by herself. He called Brooke a big girl who was lucky to have her sister. Katie said that Caroline was lucky to have Ridge. With a hug, Katie left, and Ridge glanced at Caroline's portrait. \n\n\n",
