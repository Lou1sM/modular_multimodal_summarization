    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Katie's house, Donna and Katie were discussing Ridge .The upset Donna asked if Katie knew who Ridge was. \"Ridge of the Brooke and Ridge show,\" Katie stated. Donna asked if Katie felt bad. Katie said she had, but Brooke's condescending attitude made Katie feel less bad every day.\n\n\nDonna guessed that Katie was still mad at Brooke. Katie said she'd forgive Donna for saying that, and what Katie had with Ridge was the real thing. Donna asked if Katie was really ready to fight her big sister, Brooke, for the man Brooke had loved her entire life.\n\n\nDonna wished that Katie would back off because there could be no happy ending to it. Katie guessed that Donna meant there'd be no happy ending for Katie because Brooke always got what she wanted. Donna continued to try to reason with Katie, but Katie insisted that she was in love with Ridge. Katie was sure Donna was wondering how Katie even thought she could compete against Brooke.\n\n\nDonna had no doubt that Katie could compete but said competing wasn't the issue. Donna understood how Ridge and Katie could have bonded, but Donna told Katie that she had to answer one question truthfully. \"Does he really no longer love Brooke?\" Donna asked. Donna wondered if Ridge was really to let go of his history, family, and the Forrester successes that he'd shared with Brooke.\n\n\nKatie felt that one meeting with Brooke wouldn't be a game-changer. Donna emphasized that Ridge had committed himself to Brooke about a hundred times. Katie wouldn't hear it, and she said that the guy who'd left there hadn't been thinking about Brooke. \"I mean, we were so close...\" Katie hinted.\n\n\nDonna asked Katie to say that she hadn't made love to Ridge. Katie said they hadn't, but it was where things were headed. Katie believed she inspired Ridge, and they shared a vision of the future. Katie didn't know if she could give him what Brooke had; however, she could give him herself, and he seemed to want just that.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke told Ridge that they'd been down that road before. Ridge felt that she was making it sound like he was going through a phase. Brooke didn't discount his feelings for Katie, but she was sure Katie would find a wonderful man one day -- it just wouldn't be Ridge.\n\n\nBrooke believed that Katie wouldn't get what she wanted, and Ridge wouldn't even be happy with Katie. \"Not when you're son is longing for you and not when you are longing for me,\" Brooke concluded. She conveyed that she missed him, the feel of his skin, and his touch.\n\n\nRidge said there wouldn't be another woman like Brooke, and Brooke added that there wouldn't be another couple like them. She couldn't wait for R.J. to get home to see Ridge there, but Ridge replied that it wouldn't happen.  Ridge planned to be there for R.J., but he wouldn't live in the house.\n\n\nBrooke stated that R.J. depended upon her and Ridge, and they wouldn't let him down. She told Ridge to speak to Katie if he needed to, and Brooke and R.J. would be there when Ridge returned. \"I don't want to do this anymore,\" Ridge uttered.  He said he'd raise the child with her, but \"this\" doesn't work for him anymore. Brooke insisted that they'd make it work for their son and for each other.\n\n\nRidge said he respected Brooke enough to tell her the truth, but she didn't want to hear it. Brooke reasoned that they hadn't even spent time together since he'd been back from Paris. Brooke felt that her sister was a good person, but Katie couldn't give him what he wanted.\n\n\nRidge said Katie gave him honesty and a life without complication, and he wanted those things. Brooke claimed that she could give him that and much more, and she insisted that he not give up on them. \"I have given up. It's done,\" he uttered. \"My heart is with Katie now.\"\n\n\nBrooke asked how Ridge could say that, but Ridge replied that he was going home to Katie. Brooke grabbed Ridge's arm as he turned, and she said \"this\" was where he belonged. Ridge said that it wasn't anymore, and he was sorry. He hugged Brooke as she cried.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric let Pam explain what had happened during the attempted jewel heist. He was livid that no one had told him about it. Quinn said they'd been trying to protect him.\n\n\n\"Protect me?\" Eric roared. He conveyed that Forrester had been around for a long time before any of them had set foot in that room with him, and he'd headed it for nearly fifty years. \"And now you decided you're going to isolate me from it? I should have been told!\" he yelled.\n\n\nEric ordered his staff to never do something like that again, and he asked why he hadn't been told. Aly stated that Quinn and Wyatt had kept it a secret. Hope added that they'd wanted to protect the company from any damage, but Aly said that damage had been done the moment Hope had compromised her principles to protect Wyatt.\n\n\nEric asked Wyatt to speak up about what had happened. Admitting that Aly was correct about him taking the diamond, Wyatt stated that he'd thought doing so would help the line. Hope said he'd wanted to pocket it for just a little while to create buzz. Wyatt confessed that it had been dumb and wrong, but Pam murmured that it was a little late for that sentiment.\n\n\nWyatt swore he wasn't that guy any longer. He started to say that he was ashamed, but then he decided that he wasn't ashamed. He claimed he'd done it for the line, Hope, and the company. In his heart, he'd known it would get publicity, and it had gotten more than he'd imagined. He accepted responsibility for it, and he was ready to take whatever Eric would throw at him.\n\n\nThe fuming Eric demanded to know what Wyatt had been thinking. Wyatt explained that as he and his mother had grown their business, they'd had to scratch, claw, and \"maybe con a little,\" but they'd never hurt anyone.  He said it was his explanation for his \"own stupidity,\" and he insisted upon taking full responsibility if Eric wanted to go to the police.\n\n\nEric was angry that Wyatt had jeopardized the business, but Quinn claimed that it had been \"no harm, no foul.\" Carter reckoned that the robbers had committed attempted armed robbery, and Hope claimed that had been way worse than Wyatt's actions. Aly didn't know how Hope could defend Wyatt, who'd destroyed Hope's message and values. Aly asked how Hope could not care about it.\n\n\nHope claimed that she did care, but she knew how to be tolerant and make exceptions.  Aly believed there was no tolerance for the criminal who'd stolen Hope from Liam. Aly felt that the solution was to have Quinn and Wyatt arrested, but Wyatt said his mother hadn't done anything. Eric yelled that if Wyatt had pulled something like that at Bill's company, Bill would have thrown Wyatt beneath the bus and walked away.\n\n\nRick asked if he could handle it, and Eric rasped that it was a good idea. Rick called Wyatt's actions an embarrassment, and he said the publicity they'd gotten hadn't even been legitimate. Rick added that he had to question whether Wyatt was even right for Hope.\n\n\nHope asserted that her relationship with Wyatt wasn't the issue, but Pam disagreed. Quinn stated that Wyatt had done it to help the business, but Aly insisted that Forrester wasn't a money machine. Aly called it a family business and said the Fullers were not family.\n\n\nRick told to Aly to stop, and he asked Wyatt to see the conflict he'd caused. Wyatt claimed to see it, and he admitted that part of him had wanted to impress Hope with the act. He also claimed that a greater part of him had wanted to spotlight HFTF. Wyatt was ready to face the police, but Rick decided that they wouldn't call the police. Aly was outraged that Rick would let Wyatt off the hook.\n\n\nRick asserted that he was letting \"us\" off the hook. Rick didn't want Wyatt's actions to get out because everything that they'd worked for would be lost. Aly yelled that they couldn't let Wyatt get away with it, but Rick stated that he'd made his decision. Eric decided to adjourn the meeting; however, the outraged Aly shrieked that Wyatt was evil, and she implored Pam to say something.\n\n\nAly declared that Hope was letting Wyatt control her. The exasperated Hope offered to talk about it in Rick's office, but Aly didn't want to talk to Hope anymore. \"I don't want to shadow you, either!\" Aly decided. Aly quit her job and told Wyatt that she abhorred \"Mr. Popular.\" \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Ridge this is very doable. They have done it before. They have a family; their son wants him here at home. They have always managed to get through everything before and they will again. She is not discounting his feelings for Katie as she is a wonderful person and she will find a wonderful man but it just won't be Ridge. Mistakes have been made and mistakes will be corrected. He will not be happy with Katie as long as his son is longing for him and Ridge is longing for Brooke. She comes closer and says she misses him .the touch of his skin, his touch she knows he misses her too. Donna confronts Katie who says she fell in love, that's what happened. Donna says everybody has fallen in love with Ridge at some point but that doesn't mean he's for her. Katie says she knows it is the Brooke and Ridge Show but Brooke's condescending attitude has made it bother her a little less each day. Donna tells her that Brooke is with Ridge right now. She wants him back so Katie will have to fight her sister who has loved this man most of her adult life. She needs to back away as there will be no happy ending for Katie. Katie says again that she is in love with Ridge and wants a future with him, so Donna can quit trying to burst her bubble. Aly almost takes over the meeting and does the most squawking saying a crime was committed and it wasn't those two men in jail. It was Wyatt so let him have his day in court. Eric questions Pam and she readily says yes Wyatt took the diamond and then slipped it in the thieves's bag. Rick and Hope both admit they also knew. Eric is incensed that nobody told him. He yells at them that he was running this company long before any of them were around and now they want to isolate him from it. He should have been told. Aly says it was Quinn and Wyatt. They did not want it to get out. Hope agrees it would have been bad for the line. Aly charges the line was already ruined the minute she chose to protect Wyatt over her message of integrity. Eric wants to hear from Wyatt, why he did this. He admits he took the diamond. He thought it would help the line. Hope adds in that he only wanted to keep it a little while until it got people talking. He says he knows it was dumb and he's not that guy anymore. But he knew it would get publicity and it did. But it did put the company in jeopardy so he is ready to take whatever they throw at him. He explains that he and his mom had to scratch and claw their way, maybe conned a little, just to pay the bills. He realizes that is no excuse but that's his only explanation for his own stupidity. If Eric wants to go to the cops, Wyatt says he will take full responsibility as Hope nor his mom or Rick had anything to do with this. He's Eric's guy. He will do whatever he wants. There are more outbursts from Aly who wants both Wyatt and Quinn arrested. Rick speaks up and says there will be no arrests. Aly is outraged that he is letting Wyatt off the hook. Rick says he is letting all of them off the hook and this is why he didn't want to let this out in the first place. Aly lashes out at all of them and says this is wrong. She won't let Eric adjourn the meeting. She tells Hope that she doesn't want to talk to her; she doesn't want to shadow her anymore. She quits. Then she looks at Wyatt and gnashes her teeth at him ad tells him that she hates him, Mr. Popular. Brooke tells Ridge that she can't wait til RJ comes home and sees him here. Ridge says he is not going to see him here. It's not going to happen. Brooke says her son wants him here and she is not going to let him down. He says he can't do this anymore, all the complications and issues. She says no issues; it will be a drama free zone. He laughs. She doesn't believe he means it when he says he is going to Katie and won't be coming back. He respects Brooke and that is why he is telling her the truth right now but she doesn't want to hear it. Katie gives him honesty and a life without complications and that is what he wants. She cries that she can give him that and so much more. He is not going to give up on them. He says he has given up. It's done; his heart is with Katie now. She tries to stop him when he wants to leave; this is where he belongs. He says he is sorry but no it isn't anymore.",
