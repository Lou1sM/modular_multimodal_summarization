    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill and Katie had stopped by to see Brooke. They were lovey dovey, and Brooke looked unhappy. Bill asked if anything had happened while they'd been gone on their honeymoon. Brooke had no news, but Bill said he'd heard that Deacon and Quinn planned to get married. Brooke admitted that she had tried to talk Deacon out of marrying Quinn. Brooke joked that not everyone listened to her advice as well as Katie and Bill had. They all laughed.\n\n\nBrooke asked about the honeymoon. Bill said that he had wanted to take Katie off on his yacht, but Katie wanted to go to Aspen. Katie and Brooke exchanged a long look. Both of them had memories with Bill in Aspen. \"Good choice,\" Brooke said.\n\n\n\"Aspen was so beautiful. I know this is hard for you,\" Katie said. Bill remained quiet. Katie wondered if Brooke had been all right. Brooke admitted that she was not where she'd thought she would be \"at this point in my life,\" she said.\n\n\nBrooke told Katie that she was thrilled Katie was so happy. \"Will has his family back together,\" Brooke gushed. Brooke and Katie embraced. \"I wish you both a very successful and happy life together,\" Brooke said to Katie and Bill.\n\n\nLater, Katie and Bill left, and tears started to flow after Brooke closed the door. Brooke was distraught, and she walked over to her bar and picked up a bottle of vodka. She walked away from it and picked up her phone.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Quinn told Deacon that she had wanted to share their wedding news. Quinn wanted to tell Bill. Deacon smirked, and Quinn laughed. They kissed and embraced. Quinn prepared food in the kitchen, and Deacon's phone rang. It was Brooke.\n\n\n\"I really want a drink,\" Brooke said. Deacon wanted to know what had happened. Brooke cried that she needed him. Deacon told her not to reach for the bottle. \"I'll be right over,\" he said.\n\n\nDeacon explained to Quinn that he needed to help a friend in a jam. Quinn understood. Deacon wanted to explain about his Alcohol Anonymous friend, and Quinn said she knew it was supposed to be confidential. She referred to his friend as a \"he,\" and Deacon did not correct her. \"My fianc\u00e9 steps up when someone's in trouble,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Maya and Nicole had been arguing, and Rick entered and overheard them. Nicole maintained it was \"sister stuff.\" Rick seemed concerned, but he had to leave and begged the sisters to patch things up.\n\n\nAfter Rick left, Maya commanded Nicole to stop threatening her. Maya left to visit Carter. \"I need your help,\" she told Carter. Carter laughed and wondered if there was trouble in paradise already. Maya begged Carter to do a background check on Nicole.\n\n\nCarter was surprised that Maya mistrusted her sister. Maya ranted that her sister had moved in with Maya and Rick. Nicole had been causing trouble and was going to ruin everything Maya had tried to build. Carter told Maya to calm down. He promised to help her.\n\n\nMaya shared that Nicole was a student at UCLA in computer science and had recently transferred from another school. \"Anything you can get on her, I need to know today,\" Maya demanded. Carter agreed.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Pam delivered some documents for Rick, and he angrily said he was tired of trying to brainstorm for every department including marketing. Nicole entered and interrupted. Pam left.\n\n\nNicole told Rick that he deserved to know what was going on between Nicole and Maya. There had been a lot of tension, Nicole said. They had been apart for a long time and didn't know each other very well.\n\n\nRick claimed that Maya wanted to reconnect with Nicole, and he offered to help. Nicole marveled at Rick's trust in Maya. Rick gushed that they never kept anything from each other. He added that Maya had been the only woman he'd ever really trusted. He praised her honesty.\n\n\nMaya entered and interrupted. Maya wondered why Nicole had bothered Rick, and Nicole said she had stopped to see Rick on her way out. Nicole and Rick discussed that they had been talking about how much Rick appreciated Maya's honesty because Caroline had kept secrets. \"Maya's never done that,\" Rick said proudly. Maya smiled, and Nicole nodded.\n\n\nRick got a call for a meeting, and he told the sisters it was an excellent opportunity for them to work things out while they were all living together. \"Whatever is going on, I know you two can work it out,\" he said. He left.\n\n\nMaya accused Nicole of creating problems, and Nicole inferred that Rick was mistaken about Maya's honesty because Maya had secrets. Maya said they would discuss it at home. Pam overhead the conversation, and Nicole left. Pam peeked into the office and noticed Maya pacing.\n\n\nIn Carter's office, he was on the phone with someone at UCLA, and he asked about a transfer student named Nicole Avant. He wondered what had happened. Carter seemed surprised, and he hung up. Maya received a text message from Carter that he had some news for her.\n\n\nMaya entered Carter's office, and Carter shared that Nicole had been taking computer science extension courses and had not lived on campus. He added that she'd quit school. Maya looked satisfied and said Nicole had enjoyed her last night at the Forrester estate.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, she had a glass of vodka poured, and Deacon entered. Brooke tearfully said the house felt too empty. She reached for the glass. Deacon begged her not to take a drink and to tell him what had happened. She didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\nDeacon advised her not to take the drink, but she argued that one little glass wouldn't hurt and would make her feel better. \"I don't want to feel like this anymore,\" she said. Deacon understood. \"I'm here to help you. You don't have to face it alone,\" Deacon said.\n\n\nLater, in Rick's office, Pam told Rick that Maya and Nicole seemed to dislike one another. Rick noted that Pam and Stephanie had had similar feelings toward one another at one time, and living together had improved their relationship. He anticipated that the same thing would happen for Maya and Nicole. Pam was not as confident.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Nicole had made herself a sandwich and paged through magazines on the couch. Maya entered. Maya advised Nicole that she'd felt guilty they had not stayed in touch. She'd been excited to see her little sister again. She'd been proud that Nicole was attending UCLA.\n\n\nMaya said she'd also learned Nicole had been lying and had not been attending UCLA and had no roommate problems. Nicole turned the tables and said it was nearly impossible to get into the computer science department because people from all over the world were in the program.\n\n\nNicole maintained that she had wanted a little guidance and love from her sister. Nicole reminded Maya that their parents had been hard on Maya -- which was why Maya had left. Nicole said their parents had not been any easier on her. Nicole had hoped the sisters could be reunited, but Maya clearly intended to turn her back on Nicole again.\n\n\n\"Look where we are,\" Nicole said. She motioned around the incredible Forrester mansion, and Nicole threatened, \"If I tell your secret it will all come crumbling down.\"\n\n\nMaya said there was nothing she was ashamed of, but Nicole said she could take it all away with \"one word.\" Maya looked nervous.\n\n\n",
