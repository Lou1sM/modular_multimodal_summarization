Rick joked that Katie had broken the Logan tradition of serial spouses. Katie joked that she would divorce Bill every five years or so and remarry him.\n\n\nRick suggested that Katie might never have as many weddings as his mother. Katie asked if Rick had seen Brooke lately. Rick said his mother had been furious that he had broken off his marriage with Caroline. \"She doesn't like Maya, and her sister is living with us now,\" Rick said.\n\n\nKatie advised Rick to talk to his family more often, but Rick said he'd talked to Maya. Katie scoffed that Maya reflected back everything that Rick wanted to hear. Katie suggested that Rick see his mother.\n\n\nRick said his mother had encouraged Rick to save his marriage to Caroline. Katie noted that the divorce had been finalized. Rick agreed that he had a sense of closure. \"Caroline can't understand once that trust is gone, it's gone for good,\" Rick philosophized. He maintained that he would rather be alone than be married and in love with a liar. Katie told Rick his logic was flawed because people lied.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Wyatt entered and watched Quinn page through bridal magazines. She teased that she might wear black or gray, and she might ask Ridge to design it. Wyatt discouraged her from rushing the dress or the wedding. He was concerned about Deacon. Wyatt joked that perhaps Deacon had been out looking for jobs. Quinn said Deacon had been helping a friend in need, and it was all Wyatt needed to know.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke refused to put the glass of vodka down. Deacon advised her that it would not block out the loneliness. He reminded her of their pact. He promised to stay as long as she needed him.\n\n\nBrooke maintained that one drink wasn't the end of the world. Deacon reminded her that she'd felt the need to go to an A.A. meeting and tell her story. \"I need this,\" Brooke said about the vodka.\n\n\nDeacon disagreed. He knew she was strong, and that she would be there for him if he needed her. \"I know if I fall off the wagon, you'll be there to catch me,\" Deacon said.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want to talk about what had made her turn to the bottle, but she finally shared that Katie and Bill had stopped by after their honeymoon. Deacon congratulated her for her selflessness. She had given up a romance with Bill so her sister could be happy. Brooke cried.\n\n\nDeacon looked at all the liquor in Brooke's living room. He got a trash can and got rid of everything. \"Get all of this stuff out of here. All of it. It's too much of a temptation,\" he said. Deacon threw all the liquor out while Brooke watched. Brooke looked nervous, and she thanked Deacon.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya told Nicole she had nothing to be ashamed of and had nothing to hide. Nicole insisted that Maya had to be honest with her.\n\n\nMaya turned the tables and said that Nicole had been lying all along -- playing on Rick and Maya's sympathies -- pretending to be a college student in need of a place to stay.\n\n\nMaya told Nicole that she was not taking advantage of Rick or his wealth. Maya explained that when she'd first met Rick, she'd thought he was a waiter. He had pretended to be a waiter, and when Maya had found out who he was, she'd run away. \"It was too late. I'd fallen for him,\" Maya said.\n\n\nMaya added that she'd never thought Rick would accept her because she hadn't accepted herself. Nicole was touched, but she worried that Maya wanted to kick her out. Maya warned that she would not be blackmailed. \"Tell me this secret you think you have, or get out,\" Maya commanded.\n\n\nNicole maintained that she had wanted to get closer to her sister for years. \"By threatening me?\" Maya asked. Nicole said she'd been just as determined as Maya to make a difference, and she reminded Maya that computer science was \"not some chump major.\"\n\n\nNicole said she'd had to drop out, and she needed her family. \"Family is supposed to help each other,\" Nicole said. Nicole dug deeper into what Rick thought of Maya. \"Who am I to judge? But Rick thinks that portrait -- he's so proud of the woman you claim to be,\" Nicole said.\n\n\nMaya scoffed that Nicole had tried to intimidate her. Nicole insisted that Maya be honest. She recalled the few times Maya had visited for Nicole's birthday and had been an outcast. Nicole recalled that their parents had forbidden her to contact Maya, but Nicole had sent letters, emails, and more.\n\n\nNicole cried that Maya had never responded. Nicole said she hadn't been able to imagine why her family would have shunned Maya. After she'd been older, Nicole had done some research and stumbled across some information. \"Since you left, you're living a whole 'nother lifestyle ... you're not my sister. Not Maya. You're Myron, my brother,\" Nicole said. \n\n\n",

    "imdb": "Maya is certain that her sister is just issuing empty threats and claims that she is not hiding any secret.

    "tvmega_recap": "Nicole tells Maya that if she isn't ashamed of anything then she can tell her the truth. Maya is defensive and says why should she when Nicole has not been truthful. She told them she was a college student and played on Rick's sympathy for a place to stay. She says Nicole is her little sister and she'd like them to be close but not if she is going to be controlling and threatening. Maya tells her it is time to go but Nicole says she is not going anywhere until she knows the truth. Katie stops in to see Rick and says she is worried about Brooke and asks when Rick has last seen or talked to her. Rick replies that he is giving her a cooling off period since coming back from Milan. She was not happy that he broke up with Caroline and she is not thrilled about Maya. Wyatt walks into the loft and finds Quinn flipping through a bridal magazine. She jokes these are nothing like her. Perhaps she will choose black. Wyatt just wants her to slack of a bit and not be in a big hurry to marry. She still has plenty of time. She knows he still has concerns about Deacon. Meanwhile Deacon is trying to talk Brooke out of having another drink. She doesn't want to talk; she just wants to block it all out. He says he will stay as long as she needs him to. Brooke says one drink is not the end of the world but Deacon says it can be. One can simply lead to another. She says she is not an alcoholic but he reminds her that she went to an AA meeting so do not let this beat her. They made a pact that they will lean on each other should she fall off the ladder, so they can do this together. Wyatt asks Quinn where Mr. Trustworthy is right now and she explains he is out helping a friend and she is so proud of him. She says she does not keep Deacon on a lease and that is all Wyatt needs to know. He wonders who this person is but Quinn doesn't seem concerned. She appreciates his concern but thinks this friend is the lucky one. Deacon tells Brooke that he knows Brooke stepped aside so Bill and Katie could get back together and she should be proud of that. He grabs a large trash can and starts to pick up about ten bottles of booze and pours the contents out and makes sure that is all. Nicole says she does not want to cause problems but she won't let Maya just throw her out of her house. Maya says no more games. Nicole can not go blabbing to Rick when there is no secret. So spill it or leave. Nicole says she wrote and tried to stay in touch with Maya but she was never there and the parents dismissed her too. She always wondered why but now she thinks she knows. She stumbled across something that might be the answer. Nicole has done her research; her parents kept it hidden. Maya is not really Maya at all, but Myron, her brother!",
