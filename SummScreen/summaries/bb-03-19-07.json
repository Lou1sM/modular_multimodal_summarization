Nick grabs Taylor close to him and tells her she has nothing to worry about.  Things start to get hot and heavy until they get interrupted by a call reminding Nick of his important lunch appointment.  Before Taylor leaves Nick jokes that they should send their ex's a thank you note because they wouldn't be together if Ridge and Brooke hadn't dumped both of them. \n\n\nAt Forrester Originals, in Eric's office Phoebe and Rick work on the guest list for the wedding as Ridge nervously watches on.

After he leaves, Phoebe complains to Rick about their situation and fears that he will lose interest in her if things don't improve soon.  Rick tries to assure her that she has nothing to worry about and that he is still crazy about her.  Unconvinced, Phoebe doesn't think time is on their side or that distance will bring them closer. She recalls how crazy her parents used to be about each other's, but points out that now they don't even seem to remember that time.  Phoebe tells Rick she wants what they have to get stronger. Then she begins unbuttoning his shirt arguing that she can protect her own innocence and everyone else needs to stay out of it. Once she gets his shirt off she tells him how sexy he is and playfully convinces him to let her cut his hair. A little nervous, Rick agrees but asks her to hide the scissors if Ridge walks in. \n\n\nMeanwhile at Nick's, Donna and Jackie plot on how to split Ridge and Brooke up.  Jackie wants to make sure Ridge catches Phoebe and Rick in a compromising position, however Donna wants to keep her hands clean and just let nature take its course.

When he is alone with his mother Nick scolds her for trying to sabotage his relationship with Taylor.  Jackie maintains that he would drop Taylor like a hot potato if Brooke were free.  Nick denies that he would and tells Jackie he is not interested in sharing Brooke with Ridge any longer.  Jackie believes he won't have to share her if they break up this time.\n\n\nBack at Forrester Originals, in Ridge's office, Taylor walks in looking for Phoebe because they have lunch plans.
