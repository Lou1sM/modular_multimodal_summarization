Brooke caught a glimpse of the portrait of Stephanie in the living room.\n\n\nBrooke spoke to the portrait. Brooke noted that she needed Stephanie, and she needed Stephanie to slap some sense into her. Brooke added that Stephanie had always been good at that.\n\n\nBrooke admitted that Stephanie would be disappointed in her. Brooke said that if Stephanie had been alive, Stephanie would have glared at Brooke with her beady eyes and clenched jaw. Brooke teetered around the living room and drank vodka straight from the bottle. Brooke wished Stephanie had been around to prevent Brooke from getting involved with Bill.\n\n\nBrooke told Stephanie's portrait that Ridge had dumped her for Katie. Brooke lamented that she had let Stephanie down. \"I couldn't do it. I couldn't be the Forrester matriach that you wanted me to be. I failed. I let you down,\" Brooke said. She took another gulp from the vodka bottle.\n\n\nBrooke poured herself a glass of vodka and carried the glass and bottle to the couch, where she tearfully collapsed. Brooke told Stephanie's portrait that Stephanie had seen the good in Brooke at the end. \"You cared about me,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nBrooke flashed back to emotional times with Stephanie on the roller coaster, during volunteer work at homeless shelters, and when Stephanie had died in Brooke's arms.\n\n\nBrooke cried that Ridge and Katie were together. \"You're not here to help me fight. I miss you,\" Brooke cried. She poured another glass of vodka. She thanked Stephanie for accepting Brooke into the Forrester family.\n\n\nBrooke stood up with a glass of vodka and the bottle. She stumbled across the living room and dropped them both. Brooke flashed back to some of Stephanie's advice: \"Take this family forward. Get on with life with Ridge or not. You and I made a decision to do good for other people. Be a better woman than I was,\" Stephanie had said.\n\n\nBrooke recalled that she had promised Stephanie she would be a better woman. Brooke confessed that she couldn't do it. \"You were right from the beginning. I was the slut from the valley,\" Brooke said. She reached for the portrait of Stephanie. Brooke's vision blurred and then she passed out on the rug.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Bill barged into Rick's office and informed Rick that Ridge had dumped Rick's mother. Bill shared the news that Ridge had decided he was in love with Katie, and Katie had faked fainting in order to stop the wedding. Rick was angry at Katie and Ridge.\n\n\nBill informed Rick that he had visited Brooke, and Brooke had been very drunk. Rick said that was unlike Brooke.\n\n\nRick said that he had known Ridge would let his mother down again. Rick said he had tried for years to persuade Brooke to let Ridge go. \"He always wants what he just gave up,\" Bill said about Ridge.\n\n\nBill said that Brooke was broken-hearted because Ridge and Katie had betrayed her. Bill promised to work with Rick to make Brooke see that Ridge was no good for her. Bill said that he had tried to stay with Brooke, but she had kicked him out. Rick tried to call his mother, but there was no answer.\n\n\nRick begged Bill to give Brooke some time. Bill claimed he had never seen Brooke so low, and he was worried about her.\n\n\nAt Katie's house in Katie's bedroom, Katie and Ridge basked in the afterglow of lovemaking. Katie could hardly believe they were together. She wondered what would happen next. Ridge said they couldn't control the future, and they couldn't relive the past. He anticipated a lot of fun in their future and no expectations.\n\n\nKatie wondered if they could proceed with no worries, no fears, and no regrets. \"I think we can try,\" Ridge said. They kissed and made love again. Later, Katie said that it had been an amazing night, and it felt so good that she didn't want it to end. Ridge promised to help her with that. \"It isn't over,\" he said. He kissed her passionately and caressed her as they rolled amid the sheets. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke slowly lets herself into Eric's house, calling out his and Aly's name to see if they are there. She pours herself a drink and approaches Stephanie's portrait on the wall. She slurs her words. She tells Stephanie that she left too soon. Maybe she could have slapped some sense into her. Brooke admits that she was always scared of her with her beady eyes and her clenched jaw but Stephanie was always right. She wishes Stephanie had been around when she got involved with Bill. She would have stopped her some how. But she couldn't do it. She could not be the Forrester matriarch. She sighs that she is sorry that she let her down and disappointed her. Maybe Stephanie would have wanted Ridge with Katie because she is so good. But she knows that Stephanie cared for Brooke too at the end because she finally saw the good in her. She finally accepted her and now poof it is gone. Now Ridge and Katie are here and Stephanie is not here to help her fight. While drinking more, she cries how she misses Stephanie. Bill charges into Rick's office. Rick tells him that Caroline is not there if he is looking for him. Bill assures him that he is looking for Rick. Rick replies then he must be here for his investment. Bill scoffs \u0096 what for his peanut shares in this dress factory. Bill says they have something much more important to talk about, his mother and what he knows about that. Rick says he knows nothing so is it the same thing \u0096 Ridge is leaving her. Bingo says Bill and it's not what Rick might think that she has done something unforgivable. Ridge thinks he is in love with Katie. Rick tries to call, but the phone is off. He says he should have been there with her. Bill tells him to please stop by tomorrow and check up on Brooke. And bring his favorite hangover cure; she is gonna need it. Rick says she usually doesn't drink that much. Bill says but Ridge has never left her for her sister before. He says she was knocking back a few with no indication she was going to stop anytime soon. Rick assures him Ridge is not going to do this to his mother again. He wishes he had just stayed in Paris. Bill says yes instead of using her sister to guilt her. Ridge and Katie are both hypocrites. They have hurt Brooke. He knows Rick has been a good son over the years and tried his best but now he has Bill and they are going to make sure Brooke finally gives up on Ridge. He wants to be there for Brooke, but she keeps pushing him away. It scares him. Rick can't be sure that she will go back to Bill, but he knows he is 100% there for her which is more than Ridge. After making love and cuddling, Katie tells Ridge this is so crazy. She feels like he has been hiding in plain sight. He says he is not the same man then he was in Paris and that is a good thing. And he's learned a lot about himself. He admits he can not control the future and he can't live in the past. But the future can be fun if you have no expectations and just let things happen. And all he cares about right now is this moment with her and does not care what happens next. She wonders if they can not worry or look for expectations. He says they can try. She says she does not want this to end but what if it looks differently in the morning. She's not too good to living in the moment but maybe that is something she can learn. Brooke flashes back to when Stephanie was dying in her arms and telling her that she needs her to take this family forward .some place where it is filled with happiness and love. And she does not want her to waste one moment of her life whether that be with Ridge or not. They made a decision to do good for other people and she is expecting her to do that and be a better woman than Stephanie was. Brooke cries that she was not able to do that but Stephanie was right from the beginning. Brooke was the slut from the valley. She stumbles and falls on the stone floor below with the bottle and drink beside her.",
