She tells Felicia she is a fighter and she has a small chance of survival if she has Chemo, radiation and a liver transplant.  Stephanie believes she is following Felicia's wishes by keeping her alive. Stephanie tells Felicia how much Dominick needs her.  She confesses none of the family knows Felicia is still alive.  Stephanie is afraid they would try to stop her if they knew. She tells Felicia that they will fight this battle alone and if they win, she will get to bring Felicia back home.  Felicia's doctor walks in and tells Stephanie it is a long shot but they will do everything that they can.  He tells her it could give Felicia a few months or as little as a few weeks.  Stephanie asks him to tell Felicia the best-case scenario. The doctor walks over to Felicia's bed and tells her he hopes the chemo will eradicate the cancer and her body will accept the new liver.\n\n\nMeanwhile at The Shady Marlin, Nick awkwardly breaks away from his embrace with Taylor, and tells  her he is glad he helped her get through the pain.  Taylor sees how uncomfortable Nick is and stresses that she is not trying to cause more trouble for him, or make a move on him. She just wants to thank him for his support.  Taylor thinks their main connection was that they were both looking for an escape from their pain.  She tells Nick he would have been better off with a session with a therapist rather than a drinking binge with one.  He jokes with her saying a drink with a shrink is like therapy.  He thinks Taylor is being too hard on herself since neither of them really did anything wrong.  Taylor tells him Brooke does not think it was so innocent, but she is not going to say anything because she does not want Bridget to find out.  Taylor tells Nick she hopes things work out for him whether it is with Brooke or someone else.  Nick admits that he did not like Taylor when he first met her because of all the talk about her being a saint and above reproach.  Taylor says she was never a saint and she definitely is not a saint in anyone's eyes anymore.  Nick thinks she is being too hard on herself and tells her if she ever needs a friend he will be there for her.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Bridget is pining away over Nick when Dante stops by with Dominick.  Dante tells her now that Felicia is gone Dominick will need her more than ever. Bridget is concerned about allowing herself to get too close to Dominick.  She is afraid she will lose Dominick when Dante begins to date someone special or if he decides to move back to Italy.  Dante reassures her this will not happen, because he does not want any other woman and he wants to always live near Bridget.  Dante understands why she is so cautious after everything she has been through.  Dante tells Bridget that it does not have to be a package deal. Dante is determined to help her keep her promise to Felicia and reassures her that she will always be Dominick's mother in his eyes.\n\n\n",
