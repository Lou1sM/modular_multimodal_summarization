    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Jarrett he has been with him a long time so it is only natural that he would be the one to announce Douglas to the world. They set up for a photo shoot.

She wonders if he is seeing someone for him to come up with this decision all of a sudden. Maya tells Rick that Zende and Nicole seemed so happy. She can't help but think this can be fixed and they will get back together. Rick says anything can be fixed.

Julius pops in and sees Sasha first who is only too glad to spill the beans that she is seeing Zende now, not Nicole. Julius says he told her to stay away from Zende but she could not wait to get her hooks into him. This must be payback. She says she is not going back to Chicago or anywhere.

He tells her go ahead and do it but stop threatening him. Nicole is sick and turns from Zende. She tells him do not blame this on her pregnancy; it was his choice.
