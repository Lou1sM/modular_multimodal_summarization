After the call, Rick looked into the darkened living room and was shocked to see his mother sprawled out on the sofa with an empty bottle of alcohol beside her on the coffee table.\n\n\nRick awakened Brooke, and as she groggily sat up, Brooke guessed she'd fallen asleep at some point after arriving there by cab. She realized that she'd been drinking. Rick replied that Bill had told him about Ridge and Katie. Rick had wanted to talk to his mother the previous night, but when he'd seen her lights out at her house, he'd assumed that she'd been asleep.\n\n\nBrooke was glad that Rick, and not Eric or Aly, had found her like that. Rick said they would have understood. \"I don't,\" Brooke meekly responded. Rick was sure Ridge and Katie had done it to get payback. Though Brooke wanted to believe that, she couldn't fathom that the two consciously wanted to hurt her. Rick was fed up with Ridge, who Rick had watched lead his mother on for years.\n\n\nBrooke asked Rick not to go after Ridge for what had happened, but Rick said that Ridge treated her like garbage. Brooke thought Ridge was right to do so in light of what she'd done to her sister.  She said it was no surprise that, at her sister's lowest point, Brooke had slipped in and lived up to her reputation.\n\n\nRick asked Brooke not to beat herself up, but Brooke murmured that she hadn't lived up to Stephanie's expectations. \"I'm sorry,\" she tearfully told Stephanie's portrait.\n\n\nIn Aly's room, Aly cut out paper hearts and pinned a photo of Liam and Hope to a wall encumbered with Hope memorabilia. Scattered on the bed and desk were hundreds of photographs from Hope's line. To Aly's surprise, Thorne entered. The two hugged, and Aly quickly figured out that Eric had gotten Thorne to visit. \"You're worried about me, aren't you?\" Aly cynically asked.\n\n\nThorne had heard that Aly had lost it, but Aly said her mother had told her that she needed to take a stand. He replied that Darla wasn't there anymore, but Aly insisted that her mother still talked to her. Aly told her father that Darla had told Aly to put an end to what was happening at Forrester.\n\nThorne asked what Darla had told Aly to do. The determined Aly stated that she had to get rid of Wyatt, the filth, and protect Hope. Thorne said it wasn't Aly's job, but she insisted that it was.\n\n\nAly showed Thorne a locket he'd given her when she'd been a little girl. It had Darla's picture inside, and Aly said he'd told her that her mother would always be in her heart. Aly stated that she always listened to her mother. \"She's in Heaven. She knows what she's talking about,\" Aly reasoned.\n\n\nThorne said he also liked to think of Darla as a saint, but he didn't think she'd be opposed to Hope and Wyatt.  Aly concluded that Thorne hadn't known Darla very well.\n\n\nThorne tried to remind Aly of her doctor's advice, but Aly interrupted, recalling that, on the day he'd been about to marry \"her,\" Darla had also steered Aly correctly. As he prefaced his next statement, Thorne said Taylor's name, and Aly told him not to say \"her\" name. Aly didn't want to talk about \"her.\"\n\n\nAly insisted that her mother had been a selfless saint who'd had the values that Hope had once promoted. Aly felt that she and her mother \"are\" full of so much love for the Forresters, and her mother wanted her to keep Hope out of trouble. Aly asserted that it was exactly what she'd do.\n\n\nAt the boutique, Eric arrived straight from the airport to see how the installation was going. Quinn greeted him and said it was an honor to work with his wife's jewelry. Eric mentioned that they had a meeting to get to. He wondered what Wyatt had on the agenda. Quinn didn't know, but she assumed that it had to be something positive for Hope.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Hope and Wyatt languished in bed even though Hope said there was a meeting that they had to attend. Wyatt stared at Hope and told her how hot she was. He wanted to get her out there, looking like that, in magazines and on billboards. \"In my lingerie?\" she asked, giggling. Wyatt stated that some things were just good business sense.\n\n\nOver coffee, Wyatt talked about his research into Brooke's Bedroom, but Hope thought it would be weird to put her body on display. She said she wasn't her mother, and she didn't even know if they had time for a lingerie line. Wyatt was sure that if she took over the bedroom line, jaws would drop.\n\n\nHope offered to consider it, but she said she'd started HFTF because it had been embarrassing to her that the kids at school had seen her mother half-naked. HFTF had given a different message, and she wasn't sure how it would reflect on her if she became a lingerie model. He thought it'd show her different sides, and women would love to wear HFTF during the day and Hope's Bedroom at night.\n\n\nWyatt imagined the profits would be like they'd been when Brooke's Bedroom had rolled out. Hope said it had been Forrester's heyday, with Brooke modeling and Ridge designing. Wyatt fancied himself as the young Ridge, and Hope as the young Brooke.\n\n\nWyatt didn't know how Hope could turn down the proposition. Wyatt theorized that Hope's clientele had grown right along with her. Hope said she'd become more comfortable with her sexuality, and a lot of it had to do with Wyatt. He'd opened her up to a new intimacy and life, and he'd helped her see her mother differently.\n\n\nHope no longer found Brooke's sensual side intimidating. Hope was surprised to admit that she understood why her mother had worn lingerie, and Hope kind of wanted to do it, too. Hope said that it was business, she had nothing to hide, and she wasn't ashamed of herself.\n\n\nWyatt was glad to hear Hope say that because he \"sort of, kind of\" had an agenda for the meeting that day. He claimed that he had a launch idea. Kissing him, Hope said he was the worst for not getting her permission, but it was a good thing that he knew her so well. He replied that it was a good thing that \"the office puritan\" had quit, which would make it easier to launch the campaign.\n\n\nAt the office later, Wyatt was on the phone with Oliver, who Wyatt thanked for setting something up so quickly. After the call, Aly entered, and the life drained from Wyatt's face. He said that he'd thought she'd quit. Surprised he believed that, Aly stated that she said things she didn't always mean, but she was a Forrester, which meant she belonged there.\n\n\nAly claimed that she could quit every day if she wanted to and still show up for work the next day. She noted that he couldn't do that because he was a Fuller. \"Full of something, and it stinks,\" she quipped.  Wyatt said he was setting up for a meeting, and she replied that she was there to attend it. He warned her against it, and she assumed he was up to something else.\n\n\nAly warned Wyatt that, though he'd conned Rick and Eric, she was still watching, and if Wyatt did one more thing to disgrace the family or Hope, he'd be gone. Wyatt claimed to understand her desire to protect Hope, but he said not everything Aly thought was a disgrace truly was. He added that Rick and Eric made the decisions, not Aly.\n\n\nWyatt warned Aly not to attend the meeting, but Aly insisted upon remaining. She stared him down and then walked over to the conference table. \"I am Hope's shadow. And I will protect her,\" Aly said to herself. \n\n\n",

Thorne returns from Paris and becomes concerned when Aly confides in him that she is speaking to her dead mother, Darla. Thorne cautiously attempts to convince Aly to become more accepting of Wyatt and Hope. While in bed, Wyatt pitches Hope his idea for the newest HFTF line and tells her that he is going to present it to the team.",
    "tvmega_recap": "With Eric in San Francisco, Rick lets himself into the house to pick up some sketches and finds Brooke sprawled out on the couch. With a bottle nearby, it is clear that she has been drinking big time. He manages to revive her and to ascertain that she took a cab over. She doesn't remember much after that except she had been drinking and then must have fell asleep. Hope giggles when Wyatt wakes her up with a kiss. Despite the sunlight out, he tries to convince her it is night and they do not have to go into the office. Then he tries to convince her to spread out a bit and open her own lingerie line. It takes some talking but he finally gets her to say yes and he's already got a launch meeting set up. And he's just glad that the office puritan has quit. It will make this go so much easier. Aly is in her room cutting out hundreds of paper dolls of Hope for collages for the wall. Thorne surprises her when he knocks on the door and comes in. She had not realized he was coming from Paris. Then she realizes that Eric called him and they are worried about her. He admits Eric called him and said Aly had sort of lost it yesterday. She says she was taking a stand. He says she needs to ease up and trust that Rick and Eric know what they are doing. She is upset when she mentions her mom and he thinks she is imagining things. She says her mom talks to her a lot and she said she knows right from wrong and she needs to put an end to what is happening at FC. Thorne asks exactly what does her mom want her to do. Aly replies to get rid of the filth \u0096 Wyatt and his mother and what they bring to FC and their family. She argues with her dad that it is her job to protect Hope. Thorne says he knows Aly thinks her mother was a saint and that's the way he remembers her too, a very good person. But he doesn't think she would be opposed to Wyatt and Hope's relationship. Aly sneers that he must not have known her mother that well after all. But she always listens to her advice. She will not allow Thorne to say the word Taylor. But she goes on again about how good Darla was and wants her to be by Hope's side to keep her out of trouble. Thorne clinches his lips when she says that is exactly what she intends to do. Eric returns from his trip and stops by the Boutique to see Quinn and assures her that he missed her and she is doing well with the Stephanie jewelry collection. He'll see her at the meeting tonight. Rick tells Brooke that Bill told him about Ridge and Katie. He can not believe Ridge promised this time would be different and now it is with her sister. Wyatt talks to Oliver on the phone and thanks him for setting up a photo shoot. Aly walks in and he's surprised to see her since she just quit yesterday. She says she is a Forrester and belongs here, he doesn't. And she can quit every day if she wants too and still show up for work. She says Fuller \u0096 full of something that stinks. She says he may have conned her grandpa and Rick but she is still watching him and she will be at this meeting tonight. Wyatt says that is not a good idea. She won't like it. He knows she wants to be protective of Hope but something she might think is a disgrace might be good for the company; that should be up to Eric and Rick, not her. He tells her she should turn around and leave. She says she is staying. To herself, she utters that she is Hope's shadow and she will protect her. Brooke tells Rick to please not talk about Ridge like that. They have been at odds for so long ..she doesn't think she can handle any more of it. She blame herself and what she did to her own sister when she was ill with PPD. She just lived up to her reputation so that was no surprise. Rick tells her to stop beating up on herself. She looks at Stephanie's portrait again and says she is sorry. She was supposed to be the Forrester matriarch, but she just couldn't do it.",
