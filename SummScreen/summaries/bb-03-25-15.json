Rick gushed to Nicole that what he loved most about Maya was her self-acceptance. Maya knew herself, and she didn't apologize for it, Rick said. Maya smiled.\n\n\nNicole listened intently. Maya inquired about Rick's day, and they discussed Ivy. Rick said Ivy had been difficult, and Maya agreed. Rick said he didn't like Ivy's attitude. Nicole wondered what the problem was because she liked Ivy.\n\n\nRick explained that Ivy was his cousin, but she dated Liam, who was Caroline's cousin. Nicole guessed that Ivy supported Caroline. Rick said Ivy had accused Maya of being a gold-digger and pretending to be something she wasn't. \"The irony was that Caroline was the one keeping secrets,\" Rick said.\n\n\nRick explained that Maya had been totally up-front with him. Nicole noted that Maya would never take advantage of him. Nicole offered to talk to Ivy and smooth things over. Rick agreed it might be a good idea, but Maya refused. Maya didn't want anyone interfering in a personal issue. Maya said that if Ivy had done something wrong at Forrester, Rick should fire her, but they had no reason to discuss a personal issue with Ivy.\n\n\nNicole argued that she would be happy to try. Maya adamantly refused and asked Nicole to leave the room so she could have some time alone with Rick. After Nicole left, Maya looked uncomfortable, and Rick wondered what was wrong. \"Rick, there is something I need to tell you,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Ridge's place, Bill visited Ridge. Bill eyed the painting of Caroline and teased that Ridge had to have liked becoming an artist in Europe. Ridge agreed. Ridge asked what Bill wanted, and Bill talked about Ridge's designing abilities.\n\n\nRidge wondered if Bill had been concerned about him. Bill said that he was concerned about Forrester because he owned part of it. Bill said the Forresters had a thing for paintings. Rick had a giant portrait of Maya in the Forrester mansion, and Ridge had one of Bill's niece.\n\n\nBill stared disapprovingly at the portrait of Caroline. Ridge said Caroline was beautiful and had offered to pose for it. \"It's my niece. It's disgusting,\" Bill said. Ridge promised to share Bill's review of the painting with Caroline.\n\n\nBill wanted to know if Ridge had thought about the takeover. Ridge said it couldn't happen without Steffy. Ridge handed Bill a beer, and Bill worried that the company might not last long if Rick remained at the helm. Ridge said he felt things would turn around.\n\n\nBill countered that Ridge and Rick had daddy issues, and daddy had apparently chosen Rick over Ridge. Ridge said that Rick would fall soon enough. Bill said Liam had been interested in the takeover because of the way Rick treated Ivy. Ridge noted that Liam was preoccupied with Ivy.\n\n\nBill asked how much it would cost to take over, and Ridge said Forrester wasn't for sale. Bill disagreed. Bill wondered what, if anything, Ridge and Caroline had in common. Ridge told Bill to remember that Caroline had been fresh off a divorce. Bill noted that the six-month waiting period was a good thing because people changed their minds. Ridge said that Rick had lost his mind.\n\n\nRidge reminded Bill that Rick was out of the picture because he was with Maya. Bill worried that the company needed leadership, but it had done extremely well because of Ridge and Caroline's designs. Ridge predicted that Rick would eventually go off the deep end. He added that Maya had a lot to do with it, and her sister was in town. \"You never knew what you're going to get with Maya Avant,\" Bill said.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Ivy entered and said it was nice to be away from Forrester and Rick. Liam said that Rick didn't know what he'd been talking about when he'd insulted Ivy's work. Liam promised a special evening to take Ivy's mind off Rick. \"Rick who?\" asked Ivy playfully.\n\n\nLiam handed Ivy a glass of wine, and they discussed that Ivy could work from Liam's house, but Ivy teased that Liam would never do well with the clutter she would have. Ivy encouraged Liam to tell her more about the surprise evening he'd planned for her. \"Is it a Ferrari? Because I've always wanted one,\" Ivy joked.\n\n\nIvy lamented that she and Rick had been cousins and on friendly terms at one time, but when Rick had lost Caroline to Ridge, Rick had taken it out on everyone. Later, Liam cooked Ivy dinner, and they fed each other dessert. Ivy thanked Liam for a great evening, and Liam joked that Ivy could always kiss up to Maya to get on Rick's good side.\n\n\nIvy shared that Rick and Maya had treated Aly and Ivy horribly at the Forrester house. Liam wondered if Rick and Maya were really in love. Ivy thought they were. Ivy had originally thought Rick was on the rebound after Caroline, but it seemed that Rick and Maya had been sticking together like glue. Ivy added that with Nicole living at the Forrester house, it was a different dynamic because Nicole seemed to annoy Maya.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Rick wondered what was wrong that Maya was so serious. He suggested that it was something with her sister, and she could share anything she wanted with him. Maya said it was serious, and she added that she wasn't perfect. Rick noted that no one was perfect, Maya said she'd never regretted anything she'd done.\n\n\nRick praised Maya because she had always been honest. Rick wondered if they were talking about something specific. Maya said that everything she had done to become the woman sitting in front of him had been worth it. Rick noted that she had become a different person since she'd left her family, and he added that nothing that had happened could be as bad as she was making it seem.\n\n\nMaya maintained that it was very personal. Rick had hoped that Maya and Nicole could be close again, but he understood how difficult it was because he had siblings he couldn't stand, and they had complicated relationships.\n\n\nRick worried that Nicole didn't appreciate Maya, and he apologized because he had invited Nicole to live there. Rick said that if Nicole didn't appreciate Maya, they should find her another place to live. Nicole entered and overheard the conversation. Nicole confronted Maya and asked if that was what Maya wanted. Maya looked nervous.\n\n\nAt Ridge's place, Bill had gone, and Ridge sketched some designs. He looked at his painting of Caroline and flashed back to their first drawings together. He recalled guiding her hand to create Forrester designs, and he remembered how their romance had blossomed. He flashed back to a series of kisses and making love with Caroline, ending with the evening they had painted each other. He smiled at the memories.\n\n\n",

The visit takes an even more uncomfortable turn when Bill sees the nude portrait that Ridge painted of Caroline. Nicole gets more insight into Maya\u2019s personal and business life while observing her interaction with Rick.

    "tvmega_recap": "With Nicole is glaring at Maya, Rick sips his martini and tells Nicole that he will tell her what he loves about her sister. Besides being loyal and honest she is so self accepting and does not care what others think about her. Maya looks uncomfortable. Ridge thinks he must be dreaming when he opens his door to find Bill. And the first thing Bill does is notice the nude portrait of Caroline and shows his disdain. Bill assumes he is having a midlife crisis and going Bohemian being so artistic. Bill says Ridge's infatuation is disgusting and it is just some sick imagination. Eventually they get around to the real reason Bill is here to discuss Liam's hostile takeover of FC. Ridge says he does not think it will happen without Steffy as they don't have enough stock. He knows his dad will give him the job back when Rick's year of terror is over. Bill scoffs if there is a company left then. Ridge isn't eager to get in bed with Bill just yet. Ridge says he will talk again with Liam but he thinks he is otherwise occupied. Bill asks Ridge how much for the painting who replies that it is not for sale. Bill says everything is for sale and he would like this out of here and free of Ridge. Ridge reminds him that Caroline is a free agent now, but Bill says she still could change her mind in the six month's waiting period. She deserves to be in a healthy relationship. Alone Ridge thinks back of his times with Caroline....working with her, holding her hand and guiding it.....smelling her hair and painting her and kissing her. Ivy walks into Liam's house still grousing a little of how Rick is always complaining about her work. Liam tells her that he has a special evening planned to take her mind off of all of that. They kiss and then he hands her a glass of wine. He also tells her just to start spending as little time as she can at work. He halfheartedly tells her that she can set up her shop there at his home, clutter and all. The doorbell rings and Liam thinks his surprise is here. Ivy tells him he is a great cook and he replies yeah he is good wit the phone for takeout. She makes a toast and says she hopes tomorrow is just as bad so it can end this way too. Liam laughs and says she could always kiss up to Maya. Nicole tells Rick that Maya really lucked out. He says not really. He's never known anyone like her and she is everything she appears to be. Maya is uncomfortable and tries to change the subject by asking about his day at the office. He says all is okay except he had to talk to Ivy about her work and he does not like her attitude toward Maya. Nicole is surprised to her this. She says Ivy seems just fine to her. Maya says that she too does not like the way Ivy treats Rick. Rick adds that Ivy thinks Maya is a gold digger and pretending to be something she is not. But it was Caroline who kept secrets and everyone knows that Maya is real upfront. Nicole suggests that perhaps she could talk to Ivy but Maya nixes that right away. In fact she would like to speak with Rick alone and asks Nicole to give them a few minutes. Rick realizes it has something to do with Nicole and wants Maya to tell him. She has been there for him and he wants to be there for her. Maya starts off that she is not perfect. Rick says none of them are. They have all done things they regret. Maya remarks that she does not regret anything that she did. She regrets nothing to end up being the woman she is now sitting in front of him. He assures her he would not want it any other way either so this must be about Nicole. Maya has always been honest with him so she can tell him what it is about. He understands having a sibling that you can't stand. Maya says she love that he wants them to bond. He thinks he has his answer and asks if she would feel better if they got Nicole a place closer to UCLA. Nicole walks back in and asks Maya if she is going to answer Rick. He trusts and respects her. Does Maya want Nicole to leave?",
