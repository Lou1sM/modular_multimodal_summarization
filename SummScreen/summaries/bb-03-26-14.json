    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt finished his pitch for a Hope for the Future lingerie line. He had presented it to Maya, Carter, Rick, Eric, Caroline, Aly, Quinn, and Hope. Eric pointed out that Aly had a point in her argument that the HFTF line should not have Hope parading around in lingerie. Eric encouraged Aly to share her vision. Aly asked Hope if modeling lingerie was worth dumping her previous values.\n\n\nQuinn argued that Wyatt would not have pitched the line if he'd thought it would be disrespectful. Caroline noted that HFTF had evolved. Wyatt and Rick agreed that it would sell. Aly countered that \"sex sells,\" but Hope had fought hard to convince girls like Aly to wait and be sophisticated. \"My God, Hope, what has happened to you?\" Aly asked.\n\n\nAly asked to speak to Hope alone, and Hope agreed. Alone in Hope's office, Aly apologized to Hope for the way she had reacted previously. Aly begged Hope to remember what she had originally stood for when she had started Hope for the Future. \"I was young, Aly,\" Hope said.\n\n\nAly agreed, but she reminded Hope that Hope had a vision for young women. \"The thing is, people grow up,\" Hope countered. Hope tried to convince Aly that she had matured, and so had her values. Aly argued that seeing a billboard with a half-naked Hope on it sent a message, but what message, Aly asked.  \"A hot night in bed?\" Aly asked.\n\n\nAly got through to Hope and reminded her that letting young women think that seduction was good was not a responsible message. \"Like it or not, they are listening. Just ask what advice you are giving when you are modeling lingerie,\" Aly said.\n\n\nHope tried to justify her new attitude. She reminded Aly that she had slipped a few times. Aly agreed that Hope was human and that was what appealed to young women. Aly added that it was never easy to be true to oneself no matter who a person was.\n\n\nAly encouraged Hope to show young women that Hope respected herself and believed in her life lesson. Aly said there were plenty of celebrities who relied on sex to sell products. Aly wanted Hope to be a crusader for a responsible lifestyle, self-respect, and a responsible line of clothing. \"That is what Hope for the Future is all about. You have to live it, Hope,\" Aly advised.\n\n\nAly worried that a lingerie line could hurt Hope and the HFTF line. Hope looked thoughtful. Hope told Aly that she had a lot to think about because Aly had a point, but Hope reminded Aly that it was Hope's decision -- and not Aly's -- which direction the line took.\n\n\nWaiting outside the meeting room, Quinn mumbled that Aly was just a teenager and needed to be reined in. Wyatt said that Aly had an axe to grind. Carter reminded Quinn that Aly was a teenager who happened to be a Forrester. Carter added that a meeting with Aly would help Hope resolve any doubt she might have about the line.\n\n\nIn the reception area at Forester, Pam and Liam discussed what they felt Hope would do about the lingerie line. Liam was convinced that Hope would never give up her values. Wyatt interrupted and asked why Liam was there. Liam answered that he was there to witness Wyatt's demise.\n\n\nWyatt arrogantly told Liam that Hope was on board for his idea. Liam disagreed and said that Wyatt didn't know Hope very well if he thought that Hope would be happy with the campaign. Wyatt said that Liam was wrong. Hope loved the idea. Liam said that Hope might love the idea temporarily, but she would eventually hate it and hate herself for doing it.\n\n\nPam rejoined Wyatt and Liam. Liam said that Hope had fallen for Wyatt's charm. Wyatt argued that Hope was no longer the high school girl that Liam had remembered. She was all grown up. Liam said that Hope would be true to herself, and Aly would help realize what she needed. Wyatt countered that Aly was out of control. Pam reminded Wyatt that Aly was a Forrester.\n\n\nHope and Aly left Hope's office and returned to the meeting room, and the group reconvened. Eric and Rick encouraged Hope to wrap up the meeting because they all had work to do. Hope agreed with Wyatt that the popularity of the HFTF line was at its height, but she understood the customer base that had built the line was younger women.\n\n\nHope wondered if they could target adult women with a lingerie campaign but stay true to her message with younger women, Hope didn't know if they could do both. \"It's my name, my face, and my reputation...I have to do what's right for me. This isn't right for me. It might change, but right now, we shouldn't do it,\" Hope said. Aly smiled broadly. Wyatt and Quinn were distraught. Liam listened from the doorway. The meeting concluded, and everyone left.\n\n\nAlone in Wyatt's office, Wyatt and Quinn badmouthed Aly and all the Forresters for tiptoeing around her -- a teenager. Aly stood in the doorway and warned that Quinn and Wyatt would not get their way at Forrester. Quinn threatened that Aly didn't know who she was messing with. Aly countered that she could shove Aly and Wyatt right out the door if she wanted to. \"You two make me crazy. I hate you,\" Aly said.\n\n\nAly reminded Wyatt and Quinn that she and her family stood for respect. Aly said that her mother had advised her to stand up for what was right. Aly shared that Stephanie had called Darla Forrester \"the most respected woman.\" Quinn scoffed, and Aly went on a rant. \n\n\n\"You are a witch, a wicked, conniving witch. I can smell the evil. You reek of it. I will not let you poison Hope,\" Aly warned. Wyatt and Quinn were shocked by Aly's angry threats.\n\n\nIn Hope's office, Liam waited for Hope. \"What are you doing here?\" Hope asked. Liam said that he'd overheard the final minutes of the meeting. He was proud that she had stood up for her values. Liam wondered why Hope had wavered and thought about a lingerie line when it was so unlike her. Hope admitted that she had been excited and caught up in the idea.\n\n\nLiam said that he had been lucky to be part of her life. He worried that she would take off to Paris again, and Hope mentioned that it was where Steffy was. Hope asked Liam if he and Steffy had been in touch. Liam said he did not remain in contact with Steffy. \n\n\nLiam reminded Hope that Hope had always been the one he loved -- always. He said she was still the woman he loved, and he kissed her passionately. Quinn watched and listened from the doorway. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Rick, Eric, Caroline, Quinn, Carter and Maya discuss the possible ramifications of changing the message of HFTF. Hope puts her foot down with Aly and tells her that the decision about the line is hers, not Aly\u2019s, to make. While Aly and Hope discuss the situation, Liam and Wyatt argue about which way Hope will go and who knows her better. Later, Quinn watches as Liam surprises Hope with an unexpected gesture of his love.",
    "imdb": "\nAll eyes are on Hope as she is forced to make an important business decision.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt is still conducting the meeting while everyone gives their views about a possible launch of After Dark. Aly is the loudest and tells Hope that sex sells and that is exactly what she would be doing \u0096 selling sex. Hope Logan fought so hard for her message for young girls like Aly to be responsible and wait. And now Hope is going to be modeling lingerie. She can't imagine what has happened to Hope. Pam and Liam are outside the door trying their best to hear a peep from inside. Liam says Aly is the voice of reason and she has never lost control around him. Pam says that is because she adores Liam, but hates Wyatt. Liam agrees that is another reason for him to like her. Wyatt is pushing Hope too far this time and maybe it is a good thing, maybe she will see the light as she has too much integrity for that. Aly wants to talk to Hope alone but Eric tries to say they are all in a meeting together. Hope speaks up and says it is okay. She will give her a couple of minutes. When Wyatt walks out he catches Liam and Pam talking. She excuses herself. Wyatt asks why Liam is there. He scoffs he is there to watch Wyatt's demise. He says Wyatt doesn't have a clue who Hope is. She is not going to be a lingerie model. Wyatt thinks Liam doesn't believe in Hope, but she's on board with this. Liam says if they do this, Hope will hate herself and Wyatt even more. Wyatt says that is why Hope is with him now. He encourages her and Liam only holds her back. Liam admits that Wyatt does feed her a large dose of charm but eventually she is going to gag. Wyatt says Liam doesn't know Hope at all. She is not that sweet high school girl that he knew. She grew up right after she left him. Hope tells Aly she gets a couple of minutes but please do not use them to slam Wyatt or it will be less. Aly basically goes over all the things she has said before. She asks Hope to think when she launched her line why she called it Hope For The Future. She had a vision and it caught on and changed the world. Hope says yes but she grew up and her values have not changed, but they have matured. Aly points out what a crusader Hope was and how she taught her generation to respect themselves and what will happen if they don't. She says Hope's whole life is a lesson and they need that. Hope says she is no angel. Aly says they don't want an angel. They simply want someone who will slip and fall, but picks herself back up and corrects them. Hope taught them to invest in themselves and not just give it away. She tells Hope she has to live her message and not cheapen herself or it will cheapen the message. She tells Hope to take back her world and respect herself. She can not do that parading around in her underwear. Hope says Aly has given her a lot to think about. She has been listening but the decision is hers, not Aly's. Back in the meeting room, Eric tells Hope it is her call if she has made a decision. Hope starts by saying she agrees with Wyatt she thinks this will sell but she also has heard what Aly said and it comes down to she needs to do what is right for her. And right now following in the footsteps of her mother isn't what she wants to do. It might change she says looking at Wyatt, but right now she is saying no. Of course both Quinn and Wyatt are very disappointed. Quinn tells him that Aly has got to be stopped. Wyatt is surprised that Aly got to Hope that way. Quinn says Aly wants Quinn gone and she wants Wyatt gone too but they can not let that happen. Aly walks in with a smug look on her face and says but it is happening. She tells Quinn that she does not know who she is messing with but finally the voice of reason prevails. She says she hates being angry but they make her crazy. Wyatt whispers a good choice of words. Aly tells him that she hates him, but that's okay because they took her advice .or rather her mother's advise. Quinn rolls her eyes when she hears Aly say that and that Darla was the most respected woman in the family. She steps up to Quinn and calls her a wicked, evil, conniving witch. She knows they exist. She even lurches forward more and smells Quinn up and down. She says they both reek of evil but she will not let them poison Hope. Hope asks Liam what he is doing here. She mentions Steffy and he says ah yes the lightening rod that kept them from marrying. But he's not in touch with her. If he wanted to be with Steffy he'd be with Steffy. He says he knows she is still skeptical but his point of view has not changed. He still loves Hope the same as he always did. But he knows she is trying to make it with Wyatt and there is nothing he can do about that. He knows she had nothing to do with this lingerie line but hopes she is okay with that. She agrees that she got overly excited about it until Aly brought up some points she had not thought of. Quinn cracks the door to hear the rest. Liam says Hope has a code and it defines her. He was lucky enough to be there for some of that but it never changed who she really was. And he can't imagine anyone else wanting to change that either. He says today showed him something .the woman he loved is still the woman he loves ..and he is so damn proud of her. He quickly gives her a kiss. She stands there frozen and allows the kiss but does not return it. It's awkward for both at the end and they say nothing.",
