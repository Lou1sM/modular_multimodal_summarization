    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's house, Bill was filling Liam in about Ridge and Katie, and Liam guessed the new relationship was the reason that Katie hadn't been at the office. Bill was frustrated because Brooke hadn't seen that no one stood between them any longer. Liam asked about Quinn, and Bill quipped, \"What about her?\"\n\nBill declared that he'd made a mistake with Quinn, but it wouldn't happen again. Liam told his father to pray that Quinn felt the same way. Bill didn't give \"a damn\" about Quinn's feelings. To Bill, Quinn had been just a distraction. All Bill wanted was his company, his son, and a life with Brooke.\n\n\nBill believed that he and Brooke had had potential, and they'd been just getting started. Liam said it had been that way until Brooke had decided to marry Ridge. Bill felt that Brooke had just wanted the kids to grow up with their families, but he and Brooke could take care of the kids together.\n\nBill called Brooke a smart, sexy, and fearless woman in need of a man who could appreciate her. He vowed that, after the evening was over, Brooke would know that he was that man. Liam guessed he shouldn't wait up, and Bill advised his son to look for a new roommate.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Hope and Rick arrived, and Rick expressed his worry about Brooke, who Ridge had left for Katie. Rick explained that he'd found Brooke at Eric's house that morning, where she'd been drunk and talking to Stephanie.\n\n\nBrooke entered, and Hope said she was sorry about what had happened. Hope was concerned that Rick had seen Brooke talking to the portrait. Pretending to be fine, Brooke said talking to Stephanie always reminded Brooke to be strong and to not let issues derail her. Hope reminded Brooke that she could lean on her children, but Brooke said it was supposed to be the other way around.\n\n\nBrooke was sorry that Bill had gone to Rick with the issue, but Rick replied that he wasn't. Rick said that Bill had been concerned and had wanted someone to be there for Brooke. Surprised and impressed by Bill's behavior, Rick concluded that Bill really cared about Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke said that no one needed to worry about her because, unlike in the past, she wouldn't do anything regrettable just because Ridge had left her. Brooke relayed that Bill thought the development should free her to be with him; however, the experience had taught her that acting upon desires came at her children's expense, and she couldn't let that happen.\n\n\nBrooke planned to be different and put her kids first. She recalled that Stephanie had always been able to do that with Eric. Brooke had wanted to do it with Ridge, but his priorities had changed. \"Mine haven't,\" Brooke concluded, and her children hugged her.\n\n\nHope and Rick left, and Brooke recalled Rick saying that Bill cared for her. She flashed back to her times with Bill, but a slamming door pulled her out of her muse. Bill had entered the house. He told her not to ask him to leave because he wouldn't do it.\n\n\nBrooke told Bill that they'd already talked about it, but Bill said she didn't have to spend a night alone. Bill explained that Ridge and Katie were starting a life together, just like Bill and Brooke had tried to do for months. However, the difference was that Katie and Ridge didn't feel guilty about it.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want to talk about it, but Bill insisted upon doing so. He said she'd sent him away because of Katie, but Katie wasn't hurt anymore. Brooke had become the one hurt, and Ridge had hurt her. Brooke asserted that Bill was acting like something had changed just because she wasn't the one. \"Not for him,\" Bill added.\n\n\nBill reminded Brooke that they'd wanted a life together and to make sure that Katie and the kids would be okay. \"Well, they are okay, and we can be, too,\" he stated. Bill implored Brooke to let go of her idealized version of Ridge, because she and Ridge had both changed.\n\n\nBill didn't think Brooke needed her \"familiar choice\" anymore. He said it was familiar only because Brooke knew Ridge always chose someone else over her.  \"It's time to move on,\" Bill told her.\n\n\nIn Rick's office at Forrester, Wyatt entered while Quinn was remembering her liaison with Bill. She said she and Wyatt didn't have to discuss the situation if he couldn't handle it. Wyatt relayed that Bill was enthralled with Brooke. \"Oh, your father and his hobbies,\" Quinn replied. Quinn knew that Bill had said Brooke was the only woman for him, but Quinn also knew that Bill wasn't the only man for Brooke.\n\n\nWyatt warned Quinn not to get her hopes up, but Quinn said she wasn't a schoolgirl with a crush. Wyatt assumed that she was still attracted to Bill. Quinn, however, saw \"attraction\" as tame. She felt that what she and Bill had was visceral and raw. Wyatt said someone could get hurt, but Quinn thought people got hurt due to being unrealistic.\n\n\nQuinn said she knew Bill, what motivated him, and what he needed.  She didn't believe in daydreaming; she simply acted upon her desires. Wyatt stated that he was only trying to figure out what his mother wanted. Quinn claimed to only want three things in life. She wanted her son's happiness, a successful business, and a companion for herself.\n\n\nThus far in her life, Quinn hadn't met a man that excited her as much as Bill. Quinn called Brooke whiny and needy, but Wyatt stated that Quinn was talking about his future mother-in-law. Quinn felt that she could appreciate Bill in a way that Brooke couldn't. Quinn figured that Brooke felt ashamed and expected Bill to feel just as bad, but Bill's mind didn't work that way.\n\n\nQuinn was sure that Bill would get fed up and move on once Brooke rejected him again. When it happened, Quinn planned to be there to show him that one woman in his life truly understood him.\n\n\nLater, the office was vacant when Hope entered. Wyatt slipped in and kissed her. She guessed that meant they were okay. Wyatt claimed he wasn't upset that he'd be the only guy to see her in lingerie. Hope stated that Aly had been overbearing, but Aly had made valid points. Hope was hoping that Aly, who'd succeeded in being heard, would back off a bit.\n\n\nWyatt highly doubted that. He said that shadows were hard to shake. Hope naughtily said that Aly wasn't there at the moment. He contemplated locking the door to be safe, and the two kissed.\n\n\nBack at Liam's house, Liam opened the door to leave, and Quinn whizzed by him as she entered. He stopped her in mid-stride to find out what she was doing there. She said she was looking for Bill. Liam noted that Bill wasn't there, and Liam was on his way out. Quinn was willing to wait, but Liam said Bill wouldn't be back that night.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Bill was with Brooke, and Liam suggested that Quinn return the next day. Quinn wanted to know if Brooke and Bill had gotten back together. From Liam's expression, she guessed that it hadn't happened, but Bill wanted it to. Liam insisted that Quinn leave a message or return the next day.\n\n\nQuinn gave in and left. Liam locked the front door and left, too. Moments later, Quinn slipped back in through the back patio door. She said to herself that Bill would back that night, and she'd be there when he arrived. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "At Rick's request, Hope shows up at Brooke's house. He's worried about thier mom. He says Ridge left her for Katie. She'll say she is okay, but she's really not. Rick tells Hope that he found her at Eric's where she had spent the night and she was talking to Stephanie. Brooke walks in and wants to know what is going on. Hope gives her a hug and says she is so sorry. She understands she was talking to Stephanie. Brooke says yes it helps her remember how strong she was. She would never let something like this derail her and Brooke isn't either. At Liam's, Bill fills Liam in on Katie and Ridge. But Brooke is furious about it and doesn't realize what a gift it is. Now they don't have to feel guilty any more. Nothing is standing between them. Liam asks what about Quinn. Bill assures him that Quinn is not a factor in this. Liam says ok but then Bill goes and knocks boots with her. Bill says okay, he made one mistake and now he has to go hear about it from his son. But he tells the little worrywart, it isn't going to happen again. Liam says he better pray that is the way Quinn feels about it. Bill says he doesn't care how Quinn feels about it. Bill pours himself a stiff drink and says his only concern now is Brooke. Quinn Fuller is nothing more than a scratch. Quinn is remembering her romp with Bill that included some pretty rough sex. Wyatt walks in and is concerned about her look. She says it is not about Aly, but Bill. Wyatt isn't sure he wants any details. He doesn't want to know about her relationships but it sure beats her being curious about his. He reminds her that Bill is still out for Brooke. She chuckles about Bill and his \"hobbies\". He's very competitive and he won't give up on Brooke. He likes the chase. But even if Brooke is the only woman for him, he is not the only man for Brooke. Wyatt tells her that he doesn't want her to get her hopes up when it concerns Bill. She assures him that she gave up her schoolgirl crush on him a long time ago. The attraction is tame. What they have is visceral, and raw. Wyatt says it sounds dangerous. Quinn says people get hurt all the time in relationships because they expect too much or make promises they can't keep. She says she knows Bill; what motivates him and what he needs. And if he thinks he needs Brooke, he is sadly mistaken. She says she does not believe in daydreams; she acts on her desires. Wyatt says then it looks like she and Bill have that in common. She says yeah and with genes like that no wonder he ended up with Hope. He says he only is trying to figure out what she wants. She says three things \u0096 him to be happy, their business to be a success and a companion for her. So far she has not met a man who excites her as much as Bill. They may be more alike than Wyatt thinks. Bill tells Liam that he is not asking for the moon. He just wants his company back, to have his son and share it with the woman he loves \u0096 Brooke. Ridge does not deserve her. He came home for her but now he's with Katie. He's garbage and she needs to be done with him now. Liam says he knows it is frustrating to just sit and tell him to wait. Bill says he is not going to wait. Liam says no that is the mistake he made, but just try to think what Brooke needs right now. Bill says she needs to realize she is free and there is not a single reason she can not be with Bill. She needs to know that she can be more than just a good mom. She's a smart, sexy, dynamic, woman and not afraid to put herself out there. She needs a man who can handle that and appreciate her and that clearly isn't Ridge. He says tonight Brooke is going to realize that man is him. Liam scoffs then he isn't going to wait up. Bill says he better start looking for a new roommate. Brooke says she is sorry that Bill came to Rick about this. Rick says he's not. He knows Bill cares deeply for her and was worried. He was impressed with that side of Bill. Brooke says well Bill doesn't have to worry about her anymore and neither do they. In the past when Ridge left, she often did things she would regret. That isn't going to happen anymore. She sees what payback is and now she knows this sounds hard to believe but she is putting her children first. Rick and Hope give her a group hug. Quinn tells Wyatt that Brooke has never been right for Bill. He doesn't want to be anyone's white knight. She knows how bad he can be. She has seen the worst of him but she can appreciate how far he has come since then but Brooke can't. She's ashamed of her involvement with Bill and she expects him to be also. Brooke will reject him again and he will move on. Wyatt asks then what. She says she will be there to show Bill there is one woman in his life who truly understands him. Bill appears in Brooke's doorway and tells her not to ask him to leave as he won't. Wyatt finds Hope and slips up and gives her a big kiss. She says that must mean they are okay. She explains that she really liked his idea at the presentation. He says he will never complain if he is the only one to see her in lingerie unless Aly convinces her to wear long flannels. He might have a problem with that. She says she knows Aly was a little overbearing but she did have a point. She made it so maybe now she will back off a little. He says he doubts it. That's the problem with shadows; they are a little hard to shake. Hope says she is not there now and gives him a big kiss. Liam is on his way out when Quinn slips in. When she finds that Bill is not there, she tells Liam that she will wait. He'd rather she go since he is leaving. If it's really important she can leave a message. She says this has to be in person. She leaves and he locks the door and also leaves. She doubles around and comes in the back sliding door. She passes the mantle and turns down Liam and Hope's picture and says Bill will be home tonight and she will be right there waiting for him. Bill tells Brooke that he is not leaving until she hears him out. She does not have to wake up alone tomorrow and neither does he. She says they have been over this before. He says yes but now Ridge is with Katie, the very thing they tried to do for months. The only difference is they are not feeling guilty about it. Brooke doesn't want to talk about this, but he stops her from walking out. He says before she did not want to hurt Katie, but Katie is not hurting, Brooke is. The man who left her a dozen times has now left her again. And the plans they made in Monte Carlo are still there. RJ and little Will are okay and they can be too. But she has to let go of this idealized Ridge as he came back from Paris a different person. Brooke does not need him as a security blanket any more. She has got to let him go as he will leave her and hurt her again. It's time to move on.",
