    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke stated that Bill didn't understand her history with Ridge. Bill believed that he understood it perfectly. To Bill, Ridge treated her like garbage, just as her father, who'd floated in and out of her life, had. Bill reasoned that it was why Brooke was so messed up and thought Ridge was her destiny. The upset Brooke insisted that her history with her father had nothing to do with it.\n\n\nBill asserted that it had everything to do with it, but Brooke didn't need Ridge anymore because Bill was there for her. Bill didn't intend on going anywhere; he was holding out for her. Brooke told him not to do that, but he asked her to let him spend the night, so they could work things out.\n\n\nBill was sure that he and Brooke were close to having what they wanted, and Katie being with Ridge left nothing to hold Brooke and Bill back. Bill had been biding his time until he found the chance to strike and take back his life. He believed that everything was within his grasp, but it started with Brooke.\n\n\nThe first thing Bill wanted to do after getting his company back was to go to Monte Carlo and relive the kiss on the Stella Maris II. Brooke declared that she wasn't flying anywhere with him. Bill said he wasn't accustomed to begging, but he was willing to do it for her.  She claimed that she wasn't ready. Bill said that she always asked him to leave, but he implored her to ask him to stay that time.\n\n\nBill wanted to recommit to and restart his life with Brooke. He was prepared to move back in with her or get a new house for R.J.'s sake. Brooke said that Bill was moving too fast and jumping to conclusions. Bill didn't know why they were denying themselves affection. He wasn't good with doing it, and being without it made him do things. \"What kind of things?\" Brooke asked.\n\n\nBill stated that he was a man with needs and desires, but they hadn't been met.  His life had been on hold, but one word from Brooke would make it right again. Bill kissed her, and she kissed him back. Suddenly, Brooke pulled away and told him to go. He wordlessly left the house.\n\n\nLater, Rick arrived to see Brooke, and she told him that Bill had been there. Rick was glad that Brooke was done with drinking, but he asked why she was so determined not to take Bill back. Rick stated that Ridge and Brooke had tried things over and over, but they hadn't ever made it work.\n\n\nRick felt that Bill had proven his feelings, and in Rick's view, it would be wise for Brooke to stop pushing Bill away. Brooke said Rick and Bill might be right, and she took off to visit Bill.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Quinn heard the front door open. She went downstairs, where Liam stood with his back to her. Silently, she crept back up the stairs. Liam grabbed a drink, and upon noticing that the sliding door to the deck was slightly ajar, he pulled it closed and frowned.\n\n\nAfter a while, Bill arrived home in the mood for scotch. Liam guessed that his father hadn't gotten through to Brooke. Bill said that Brooke was just being stubborn, but he had no intention of giving up. Gesturing to his drink, Bill decided to go upstairs to cuddle up with his \"girlfriend here.\"\n\n\nIn his bedroom, Bill placed his ring on the dresser. Quinn appeared with a tasseled whip in her hand. She guessed that he'd had a rough night, but she promised that it was about to get rougher.\n\n\nBill said he appreciated Quinn's interest in him, but she had no idea of the night he'd had. Quinn ripped Bill's shirt open, and Bill called her insane. \"Just the way you like it,\" she quipped. Bill shoved Quinn away and ordered her to get out. Quinn eyes flickered with lust and determination. She slapped the whip against her thigh and charged back at him.\n\n\nBill pushed Quinn against the wall and said he wasn't in the mood for her games. Quinn wasn't interested in how he felt about it. \"This is what I want!\" she declared. Bill called her twisted, and she pulled him in for a kiss. Bill kissed her back, but then he tore himself away and told her that he wasn't drunk like he had been the last time they'd been together.\n\n\nQuinn was fine with taking Bill sober, but Bill insisted that it wouldn't happen. She replied that he didn't have a choice. Bill called her crazy, and she thanked him for saying so. He bit out that it hadn't been a compliment, but as she pulled off his shirt, she said that crazy in the bedroom was always a compliment. Bill slammed her down onto the bed and climbed on top of her.\n\n\nDownstairs, Liam saw items in the living room rattling as if he were in an earthquake. \"Oh, no! Quinn!\" Liam realized.  Moments later, Brooke arrived to see Bill, but Liam stated that it wasn't a good time. Brooke figured that Bill might be upset with her, and she asked if Bill was upstairs. Liam doubted that it was a good idea to go up there at the moment.\n\n\nBack upstairs, Bill was in the middle of taming Quinn when Liam knocked on the door and announced that Brooke was there. Bill shoved Quinn into a closet and implored her to keep quiet. Brooke decided that she was going into the room, and when she entered, she saw what a wreck it was.\n\n\n\"What is this?\" Brooke asked, and the conspicuous Bill replied that it was his bedroom. Liam decided that he was going downstairs, and Brooke asked Bill what was going on.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Wyatt and Hope kissed. They made dinner plans for the evening, and Hope became anxious to call her mother. She was worried about Brooke, and Wyatt revealed that he was also worried about his mother, who had feelings for his father.\n\n\nSurprised, Hope said Quinn might get her feelings hurt, because Bill was intent on being with Brooke. Wyatt was worried about how Quinn behaved whenever she got too emotionally involved.\n\n\nWyatt decided to change the subject. He figured that Hope owed him a private lingerie showing, and he was ready to have it right there at the office. Wyatt had Hope check behind a dressing screen for her outfit, and with a giggle, she instructed him to lock the door.\n\n\nHope modeled a purple teddy, and the impressed Wyatt said she would have made a great lingerie model. Hope thought some things were best kept between them, and Wyatt swept her up, placed her on the sofa, and began to make out with her. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill and Brooke continue to talk about Ridge. She says she just can not let him go. Bill says he knows their history and that is why he can cut through the B.S. He says Ridge treats her like garbage and she thinks that is what love is. He says she does not need Ridge anymore as she has Bill. He's going nowhere and holding out just for her. He invites her to go upstairs and they can work this out. He wants to spend the night. He points out that Katie is with Ridge now, so there is nothing in their way in being together. The wait is over and they don't have to feel guilty about being together. They can raise their children and he can get his company back. He'll talk to his sister and figure something out. He says the first thing they are gonna do is fly to Monte Carlo and hop on his yacht and relive their first kiss there. She says she is not flying to Monte Carlo with him. He says he knows she wants to and he is not a man to beg but he will for her. He says she always asks him to leave but not tonight. He is ready to move in or get another place with her, whatever she wants and thinks is best for RJ. She tells him to slow down; he's going way too fast. He reminds her she needs affection and attention and so does he. Without it, it makes him do things .he has needs and desires and none of them are being met. Personally and professionally everything has been put on hold but one word from her could make it right again. She says she is sorry but he will have to go. Hope tells Wyatt they are both done for the day and a movie and dinner out tonight sounds good. First she wants to call her mom. She's worried about her. Wyatt says they have that in common now. He also is concerned about his mother and her love life. He knows he maybe ought not to be saying anything, but she sort of has the hots for his dad. Hope says she hates to say this but maybe his mother better not get her hopes up as Bill is still pretty intent on being with her mom. Wyatt says he knows and his mom gets too emotionally involved so maybe they should talk about something besides their parents. They are old enough to make their own decisions. But there is something Hope can do for him. She owes him. Then he explains that he was so looking forward to her barely clothed sexy body on the billboards and magazines. She says he will see her in her lingerie but just not along side the rest of the world. He's ready to get to his own private showing. He even came prepared and asks her to look behind the screen. Ooh, la la, she likes and tells him to lock the door. She comes out first in a lovely, skimpy little grape colored garter belt, teddy. Rick finds Brooke in a mood sitting on her stairs. She tells him it's been a rough day but she has not been drinking. She does not need another hangover like she just had. And it's not over Ridge, this time Bill. He comforts her by saying that Katie is with Ridge now. She is not going back to Bill. He knows he has had his issues with Bill in the past, but he does have his point. She has tried over and over with Ridge and they have yet to make it work. Bill has proven his feelings, and he's committed to her. So maybe she should stop pushing him away. She jumps up and says she loves him but has to go .she is going to see Bill. Bill returns to Liam's and doesn't want to talk about it, rejected. And no he does not want a beer, make it scotch. He says the night should have ended differently and he should not be sitting here with Liam. But he's not giving up. He says now he's going upstairs and take a cold shower and cuddle up with his girlfriend (drink) here and go to bed. Liam says okay, he'll be there in the morning if Bill wants to talk. As he walks into his room, it's not long before Quinn appears in her black leather cat suit swinging a small purse size whip. She asks if he had a rough night as it is about to get even rougher. She sidles up to him and tells him to take off his shirt. He says he appreciates her interest but she has no idea what he has been through tonight. She asks how many times is he gonna let Brooke turn him down. He says she is insane and that is none of her business. He tells her to get out, but she comes closer and says just the way he likes it. The next moment Liam is hearing lamps and things falling to the floor as Bill and Quinn take turns throwing each other on the bed. He wants to know how she got in and does Liam know. She grins that with all the noise they are making, he sure knows now. As they smack around on each other, he says he is not in the mood for her games. She says she is not playing with anything. She does not care about his moods. Forget the buttons, she rips the shirt off and starts for the belt. He tells her that she is twisted. She replies that is why it is so special. He says okay, it happened once but he was drunk; he's sober now. She says good, this time can be sober. As she kisses him he says this is not going to happen again. She looks down at him in that area and says she really doesn't see that he has a choice. He pushes her down on the bed again and tells her she is crazy. She thinks crazy in the bedroom is always a compliment. Liam is surprised to open the door and find Brooke there. She'd like to come in and see Bill. Reluctantly Liam lets her in. He says Bill is upstairs but he wouldn't go up if it were him. It's not really a good time. Quinn is asking Bill if he wants a turn. He says he doesn't need permission. Liam knocks on Bill's door. Bill hollers it is not a good time. Liam tells him that Brooke is here. There is some muffled sounds and scrambling about as Bill shoves Quinn and her play toys and puts her in the closet. She can still hear though. Brooke walks in and sees the room and bed asunder and asks what is going on. Liam says he will leave the two of them alone.",
