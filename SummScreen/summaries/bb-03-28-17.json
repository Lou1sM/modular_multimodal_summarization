    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Nicole, Zende, Rick, and Maya discussed the buzz that the Australia preview had gotten. Steffy's wedding preparation photos were also trending, and Nicole asked if Rick had seen the numbers. Rick replied that Nicole headed social media so that he didn't have to monitor it. He hoped she was ready because, though one Forrester wedding was down, there was still one more to go.\n\n\nZende and Nicole discussed their evening plans. Zende had made reservations for a romantic night for two, but he offered to make it for four if Rick and Maya didn't have plans. Rick and Maya said their plans included diapers. Rick joked about how there were so many newlyweds rubbing his and Maya's faces in their carefree lives.\n\n\nMaya listed the newly wedded couples, but Rick paused when she mentioned Ridge and Brooke, who actually weren't yet married. Maya assumed Rick was worried about his mother making a mistake. Worried that Ridge would make the mistake, Rick said that, somehow, some way, Ridge always let Brooke down.\n\n\nZende and Nicole tried to reassure Rick about Ridge and Brooke's resilience as a couple. Maya said that if any couple could overcome anything, it was Brooke and Ridge.\n\n\nIn Eric's room, Eric implored the sobbing Brooke to tell him what was going on, but Brooke said she couldn't even believe it was real. He asked her to tell him the issue. She uttered that it was Ridge; she'd been walking on the beach, and she'd seen something.\n\n\nJust then, Quinn and Ridge arrived. Ridge ordered Brooke to stop saying whatever she was saying. Eric asked what was going on and if Brooke and Ridge still planned to get married. Ridge responded that everything was fine, but he and Brooke needed to talk something through. Brooke asked Ridge how, and Eric insisted that he needed to know what was happening.\n\n\n\"Yes, Eric needs to know,\" Brooke said. Ridge, however, wanted to go to his and Brooke's room to talk. He asked her to please hear him out. Ridge held the door open for Brooke, and the two left. Eric asked Quinn if she knew \"what the hell\" was going on there.\n\n\nQuinn wasn't sure. Eric asked if she'd seen anything or if she'd run into Ridge and Brooke on the beach. Quinn stammered and decided that the couple just needed time. Recalling the way Brooke had just acted, Eric didn't know if time would help. He had gleaned that whatever it was had to be bad, and he wondered if another woman was involved.\n\n\nQuinn asked why Eric would think such a thing. Eric didn't have a reason except that it was easy to assume with Ridge. Quinn asserted that Ridge was committed to Brooke. \"Until he's not,\" Eric responded. Eric knew firsthand how Ridge behaved when a woman looked at him, even if the woman was Eric's wife.\n\n\nEric said Quinn knew about what had happened during his marriage to Brooke. Eric didn't think Ridge meant to hurt the people he loved, and Eric hoped his intuition was wrong. He told Quinn that she could tell him if Ridge was cheating. Eric wanted to know if she'd seen another woman with Ridge or if she'd seen the couple fighting.\n\n\nQuinn said she hadn't. She'd run into Ridge and talked with him on the beach alone. She said she'd later encountered Brooke. Eric asked if Brooke had been upset. Quinn replied that, by that point, Brooke had been upset, so whatever the issue was had already occurred. Quinn claimed that she'd heard in Brooke's voice how Brooke felt about Ridge. Quinn was sure they'd get married because a relationship like that couldn't be thrown away.\n\n\nEric noted that Quinn seemed to care about Ridge, and her effort with Ridge meant a lot to Eric. Eric's phone rang with a call from Rick. Eric told Quinn it could take a while if Rick was calling about business. Quinn said it was fine, and she left the room as Eric answered the phone.\n\n\nEric was cheery with Rick, who joked about Steffy's wedding stunt. Rick said that Nicole was wondering if there were updates about Ridge and Brooke's wedding that Nicole could tease their followers with. Eric thought it was good to hold off on posting about the couple, who seemed to be going through something.\n\n\nEric said not to worry about it because Ridge had said the couple was getting married. Rick asked how his mother felt, but Eric said he believed the couple would be fine. Eric stated that if Ridge and Brooke couldn't make it, then no couple could.\n\n\nIn Brooke and Ridge's room, Brooke told Ridge to start talking. Ridge asked what he could say. Brooke replied that he could start with saying she hadn't seen what she'd seen. To her, Ridge had no respect or boundaries. She said that he'd not only kissed another woman, but it had been Quinn, his father's wife.\n\n\nRidge tried to remark upon what Brooke had seen, but Brooke didn't want him to deny it or twist it around. Ridge said he wasn't denying that he'd kissed Quinn. Brooke asked if he wanted Quinn, a woman he'd despised. He claimed to still despise Quinn and said he and Quinn had only been flirting, which had begun when he'd tried to protect Eric.\n\n\nBrooke replied that it was bull, but Ridge insisted that he'd wanted Quinn gone. Brooke decided that Ridge wanted Quinn in his bed. He replied that he didn't want that. Brooke wanted to know how he could do it to her again, and she said she'd thought he'd been committed. He replied that he wanted to spend his life with her. Brooke figured he wanted her on the sidelines while he hooked women just to prove that he could.\n\n\nBrooke believed that the more inappropriate the woman, the better. It wasn't normal to Brooke, who believed that Ridge had some deep-seated anger or problem with her, Eric, and other women. Ridge's behavior wasn't acceptable, and Brooke no longer wanted to be a part of it. She thought that Ridge was in the same place he'd between thirty years back, but she wasn't. She and R.J. deserved something better than Ridge.\n\n\nRidge stammered that he'd been reckless and had taken a walk on the wild side. Brooke told him that he wasn't twenty years old and didn't have oats to sew. He'd already been there and done that; however, it was never enough, and she was never enough. Ridge replied that if he knew how to explain the stupid things he'd done in his life, they wouldn't be there right then. He'd lost his way and had made a wrong turn. He'd been driven by desire.\n\n\nBrooke frowned, upset that Ridge desired Quinn. Ridge said he didn't desire Quinn. He said it might be the chase that he desired, and Brooke should understand it because it was a part of her, too. He figured it was why they were attracted to each other. Brooke replied that she didn't find him kissing Quinn attractive. To her, it was disgusting.\n\n\nRidge didn't deny what he'd done. He said he'd betrayed Brooke and Eric and had been unable to sidestep temptation. Brooke asked if she was supposed to accept it. Ridge said it wouldn't happen again with Quinn or anyone else. He implored Brooke not to pull away from him. Brooke said she couldn't. Ridge replied that she had to do it.\n\n\nRidge told Brooke that she could smack him or around or take a bat to his car as long as she didn't walk away from him when they were so close to having their family back. Ridge said it was also for R.J. Ridge knew that he wanted to marry Brooke the next day, and he asked her to say she wanted the same.\n\n\nBrooke replied that she wanted to marry the man Ridge had been that morning, \"the man I pretend you are.\" Ridge replied that she knew who he was. Brooke agreed, saying that he was the man who hurt her again and again and reeled her in with false promises. Ridge asked her to trust in them and get married to him.\n\n\nBrooke didn't how they could look into each other's eyes and say vows. Ridge said he could do it the same way that he was looking at Brooke in that very moment and asking her to forgive him. He said he couldn't live his life without her. Brooke asserted that they were not getting married, and he asked if she didn't want to put their family back together.\n\n\nA knock sounded on the door, and Brooke answered. It was Quinn. Quinn stammered as she tried to explain to Brooke that there was nothing going on with Quinn and Ridge. Quinn exclaimed that she and Ridge hated each other. Brooke thought it was funny how passionate hate could be. Quinn insisted that she only had passion for her husband.\n\n\nQuinn didn't know if Brooke and Ridge would break up or follow their destiny together. Quinn's only concern was for Eric. Brooke believed Eric deserved to know what his wife had been up to. Quinn swore she wouldn't kiss Ridge or any other man ever again. Quinn said she and Ridge had been foolish, but they each knew who they wanted. Quinn insisted that there was no reason to break Eric's heart, and she implored Brooke not to tell Eric or anyone what had happened.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Rick, Maya, Nicole and Zende await news from Australia on the second scheduled Forrester wedding. In Sydney, Eric urges an emotional Brooke to tell him what is making her so upset when Ridge and Quinn arrive. They ask for a conversation in private with their respective partners. Quinn dodges Eric's questions, while Ridge makes an attempt to reason with Brooke. He claims that it was a harmless flirtation which does not go well with Brooke. She is still disgusted and reminds her fianc\u00e9 that he was kissing his father's wife. More importantly this proves to her that Ridge has not changed and that their relationship will never be stable as there is always another woman involved. Quinn enters when Eric gets a call from Rick. She issues a desperate plea to Brooke not to tell Eric and harm her marriage.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric asks Brooke what is making her so upset. She cries it is horrible. She cannot believe this is happening or real. She finally says this is not easy for her to say but it is something he needs to now. He wants to know if Ridge hurt her. She says yes she saw something. Quinn and Ridge walk in and say they need to talk to Eric. Actually Ridge wants to talk to Brooke alone first, leaving Quinn and Eric. Eric asks what in the hell is going on here. He states that she was on the beach for a long time so she could have run into Brooke and Ridge. She says yes but she thinks they need more time. Eric shares that this seems to be very bad and he wonders if another woman is involved. In their room Brooke says Ridge better start talking. How could he .does he have no respect or boundaries? Not only was it another woman but his father's wife! Nicole tells Rick and Maya that FC is definitely benefiting from Steffy's pix in Sydney. Nicole and Zende have plans but Rick and Maya say they will pass as they have a reservation with diapers tonight. Quinn tells Eric that Ridge is committed to Brooke. He says yes until not. When another woman looks at him, it doesn't matter who it is, it could be Quinn, his own wife. He doesn't mean to, but Ridge hurts the people he loves. Brooke tells Ridge do not try to deny it, she saw him kissing Quinn. He says he still despises her, it was only flirting. He started this out because he wanted Quinn gone. Brooke argues back that there is something wrong with him and his women. It is not normal and she does not want to be part of it anymore. He is in the same place he was in thirty years ago but she is not. She and RJ deserve something better than Ridge. Quinn tells Eric she is sure whatever is going on between Ridge and Brooke that they will work it out. A relationship like this cannot be thrown away. Ridge tells Brooke that he was careless and took a walk on the wild side. She quips that he cannot be sowing his wild oats right now. He says maybe he is still trying to prove himself and she does too and maybe that is why they love each other so much. Temptation was standing right in front of him but he is not in love with Quinn and it will not happen again. She cries she cannot do this. He says yes she can. She can stay and fight or take a baseball bat to his car but do not throw this away. They have worked too hard to get to this place. He says he knows what he wants. He wants to get married tomorrow and needs her to say she wants that too. Eric says he hopes Quinn is right and this is not enough to break Ridge and Brooke apart. Rick calls so interrupts their conversation and he tells her to go on as this may take a while. He tells Rick that he thinks all will be okay with Ridge and Brooke but they are talking things out right now. Brooke says she wanted to marry the man Ridge was this morning but now he reeled her in and did not mean it. She says she could not possibly look him in the eyes and say those vows. He says he is looking in them right now and asking her to forgive him and they can start over tomorrow. She says NO. They are not getting married. Quinn is listening at the door and finally knocks. Brooke lets her in and Quinn says they are together and she is with Eric so nothing has changed. There is only one person in this world that she is passionate about and that is Eric. She vows she will never kiss another man again. They were not thinking but they are now. There is no reason to break Eric's heart. He loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her so please do not tell him or anyone.",
