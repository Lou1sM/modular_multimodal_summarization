Outside her room, Stephanie tells Eric that she had to alter the papers needed to get the procedure done.  He becomes lovingly irate, then asks how many times he has married her.  Stephanie replies three times.  Eric wants to know why he keeps marrying this lunatic.  The doctor comes out of the room and tells them that Felicia is regaining consciousness, of sorts.  The doctor explains to Eric what is going on while Stephanie goes in to see her daughter.  Felicia feels Stephanie's presence in the room and opens her eyes.

He finds her on the sofa, having had too much to drink again.  He tells her that he understood that she wasn't going to do that anymore, and she tells him that she changed her mind.  She defies him, by pouring herself another glass of wine.   Nick tells Taylor that she is no alcoholic; she is just a wannabe one, so that people will feel sorry for her.  He tells her that if that is what she wants to be, then she needs to drink like one, and pours her something more potent.  \n\n\nBrooke calls Ridge obnoxious.  She tells him that what he is trying to do now is way too late.  Ridge tells her that she doesn't have to settle for second best.

He tells her that it has always been the real deal between the two of them, ever since they first met.  He calls Nick an \"insecurity\" judgment on her part.  He thinks that Nick represents all the times that he screwed up because he was the one that always did the right thing.  Brooke lashes out at Ridge.  She says that she will never be with a man who could walk away from her and the children.  She won't let him, or any man, do what her Father did to her.

    "tvmega_recap": "Mr. and Mrs. Forrester seem to have come to a comfortable understanding about keeping Felicia alive, and Eric give Stephanie all the credit. Nick finds Taylor passed out on her sofa at home from drinking. Tough love, he offers her bourbon and to even get loaded with her. She's not an alcoholic, just a wannabee, wallowing in pity because she lost her husband. She doesn't appreciate his attitude. Brooke and Ridge continue their harangue about his being her one and only and not settling for Nick as her second choice man. He even states all the reasons for Brooke's insecurities and why she chose Nick over him.
