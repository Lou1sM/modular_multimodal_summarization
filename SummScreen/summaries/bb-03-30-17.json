    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Maya, Rick, Nicole, Zende, and R.J. were in a meeting. Rick relayed that Ridge wanted them to screen new runway models, and Rick asked R.J. to update them on the interns. Zende had heard Coco was working in the cutting room and wondered if it was wise to let a Spectra work in that area. Rick replied that he'd been thinking the same thing.\n\n\nR.J. claimed that Coco wasn't shady. Maya stated that they didn't know Coco very well. R.J. claimed that he did know Coco and was getting to know her better each day. Zende thought it was wise to keep all Spectras away from anything related to design. R.J. noted that the designs were all over the building, and Coco was an in-house runner. He insisted that Coco could be trusted, and he urged them to give her a chance.\n\n\nLater, R.J. had gone, and Thomas arrived. Nicole and Zende greeted Thomas and mentioned that they'd loved his \"snaps.\" Rick and Maya weren't thrilled to see Thomas, and Rick asked Thomas how he could invite Sally Spectra on the trip. Thomas admitted that he hadn't expected Sally to make the trip, but Maya was sure he was glad Sally had.\n\n\nSally had impressed Thomas by flying to Australia. Rick called it a bit much. Zende and Nicole reminded them of Sally's restaurant and wedding food fights with Steffy, which Sally had posted online. Thomas replied that if they had checked Sally's accounts, they'd know that she hadn't posted anything inappropriate -- anything \"that had been her fault anyway,\" he added.\n\n\nThe others were puzzled by the statement, and Thomas explained that Sally had wound up going off the pier by accident when Steffy had tried to escort Sally out of the reception. He stated that they'd all had a good laugh about it, and anything that Sally's great aunt had done in the past would remain in the past. Zende said that they still had Coco. Thomas called her harmless, but Zende felt they needed to keep their eyes open.\n\n\nLater, Zende and Nicole had gone, but Maya, Nicole, and Rick were still debating with Thomas the merits of minimizing Coco's exposure to their designs. Thomas insisted that Sally being related to someone who'd stolen from them in the past didn't mean Sally would also do it.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley routed a call from the loan officer to voicemail. Shirley hoped that Coco would get something soon, but Saul replied that Coco hadn't been wearing the necklace with the camera in it. Shirley declared that she'd make Coco wear it that day.\n\n\nCoco stopped by the Spectra office on her way to Forrester. Shirley complimented Coco's outfit but said it was missing something. Shirley suggested Coco wear the necklace Sally had given her, but Coco said she was saving it for a special occasion. Shirley reasoned that each time Coco went to Forrester, it was a special occasion.\n\n\nShirley put the necklace on Coco, but Coco wasn't sure it matched her outfit. Shirley disagreed, and Saul said it was perfect to wear to Forrester. Coco decided to wear it, and as she left, she asked Shirley to tell Sally that she couldn't wait to hear about the trip.\n\n\nLater, Sally arrived, and Saul gave her a long and awkward hug to welcome her back. He wanted to know about the trip, but all Shirley wanted to know was if Sally had gotten the pictures they needed. Sally revealed that she'd gotten a few, but she was reluctant to use them because she'd gone to the wedding as Thomas' guest.\n\n\nShirley asked Sally not to go soft on them because they had to get Spectra off the ground and get \"Shifty\" off Shirley's phone. Sally, who'd had a good time with Thomas, was rethinking the whole idea of design theft. Shirley feigned pity for Sally because Sally's conscience was getting to her. Shirley asserted that it was too bad because \"Operation Coco\" started that day.\n\n\nSally wasn't thrilled to hear that Coco had the necklace on. Shirley insisted that it had been the plan all along. Sally replied that it had been before she'd gotten to know the Forresters. Shirley suggested they invite the Forresters over for ramen noodles. Sally didn't think it was fair to rip off the Forresters, who, with the exception of Steffy, were being nice to her and Coco.\n\n\nShirley warned Sally to remember her background and said Sally couldn't hang with the Forresters, who only saw Sally as the flavor of the month. Shirley noted that her sister had never earned the Forresters' respect, no mattered how hard she'd tried. Sally disagreed and indicated that Eric had said it had happened.\n\n\nSally asserted that she wasn't a criminal, but Shirley contended that they were just doing a little poaching. Shirley believed that everyone cheated a little in the fashion business. Shirley stated that her sister hadn't gone to jail, and they wouldn't, either. Shirley told Sally that the whole crew was counting on her, and Shirley wouldn't let Sally back out.\n\n\nSally asked for one more day to devise a plan. She was willing to try \"anything but this.\" Shirley asked if Sally would design another collection to get panned by Jarrett. Shirley told Sally not to fight it because they had to be true to themselves and borrow from the Forresters.\n\n\nSaul set up the laptop to monitor Coco's necklace cam and let the ladies know it was ready. As they watched Coco on the screen with R.J., Sally got a call from Thomas, who was checking on her after her flight. She thanked him for inviting her on the trip. He said she'd been the best part of the trip. Sally decided that she had to get back to reality and thanked him for checking in.\n\n\nBackstage at Forrester, Coco apologized for being late and handed R.J. a confidential package. He complimented her necklace and dated it to the early twentieth century style period. Holding up the package, R.J. asked if Coco wanted to see his dad's designs. He was supposed to put them in the vault, but he wanted to show them to her first.\n\n\nCoco didn't think it was a good idea because of who she was. She didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea because people didn't trust her as it was. R.J. extended his trust. He said she worked there, and she was legit.\n\n\nBehind some clothes racks, Zende paused to observe Coco and R.J.\n\n\nR.J. told Coco to forget their last names. Coco asked if she really didn't bother him. R.J. asked how he could think of anything else when she had eyes like that. The demure Coco said he was full of it. R.J. lavished compliments on her and noted that her reflexes had saved him from the forklift. To him, it wasn't fair that she was judged on her name. Coco touched his shoulder, which surprised the watchful Zende, and she thanked R.J.\n\n\nZende left and went to the design office. Nicole was working in there, and Zende told her that he thought R.J. had taken a liking to Coco. Zende hoped Coco wouldn't use it to her advantage. Zende asked if Nicole found it strange that they were suddenly surrounded by Spectras. Nicole replied that she did think Sally's flight to Australia was odd.\n\n\nZende remarked that Spectra was dead broke, according to rumors, and Sally couldn't design a dress to save her life. Zende wondered why Sally was still trying to get Spectra off the ground. Nicole figured they were spending a lot of money to operate. Zende wondered how they paid the bills and if everyone was just working for free over there. He remarked that desperate people did desperate things. He planned to keep an eye on Coco and Sally because he didn't want them messing with his family or the company.\n\n\nBack at Spectra, Saul and Shirley watched the laptop. On the screen, R.J. showed Coco a black couture gown design. Shirley squealed in excitement, but across the room, Sally did not look happy about it. Shirley said they'd done it, and they would get C.J. and Shifter off their backs. Sally started to say something, but Shirley didn't want to hear any hemming or hawing. She declared that it was \"now or never.\"\n\n\nSally contemplated things as she watched R.J. stack a purple gown design on top of the other one he'd just shown Coco.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Rick, Zende, Maya, Nicole and R.J. anxiously await wedding news from Sydney. Thomas enters and is grilled about inviting Sally Spectra on to his trip to Australia. Zende thinks that, with both Thomas and R.J. being smitten with one of their enemies, they all should be more careful as the backstory of the Forresters and Spectras is anything but rosy. Freshly equipped with a necklace from her aunt Shirley, Coco walks around Forrester Creations as an unwilling spy. Despite the family's constant harping that she cannot be trusted, R.J. thinks that they are wrong and proudly presents Coco with the latest stroke of genius of his father. Over at Spectra Fashion, Shirley and Saul keep a watchful eye thanks to the secret camera in Coco's necklace and manage to get a perfect look on Ridge's design. Sally, who refuses to publish the photos she took at Steffy's wedding, opposes to stealing from the Forresters. Shirley reminds her niece that the creditors are already breathing down their necks and urges Sally to forget about her fling with Thomas.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Saul is worried. He tells Shirley that Coco is not wearing the necklace so she will not be spying for them today. They tell Coco that Sally will be back today and something is missing from her outfit. She needs some accessories, maybe the necklace that Sally gave her. Coco says she is saving that for a special occasion. Shirley claims anytime she steps into a room it is a special occasion. So they put it on her; its perfect. Rick tells RJ they need to keep an eye on Coco and not just let her roam the building .especially keeping their designs away from her and they are all over the building. RJ says give her a chance; she can be trusted. Thomas returns and they all greet him. He says the photo shooting went well and all had a great time. Thomas says the past is the past and all the pranks are harmless. Rick says still they cannot have a Spectra wandering around their building. Thomas says Sally and now Coco would not steal their designs. Sally also returns and Shirley and Saul welcome her back. Shirley says she went down there on a mission so she must have some pictures. Being a gracious guest is one thing but think about her dreams of being Spectra again. Sally says Thomas was a class act and she cannot do this by stealing from them. Shirley says it is too late; Operation Coco starts today. Coco finds RJ backstage and he admires her necklace up close. She tells him her sister gave it to her; she's the best. He asks if she would like to see some of his dad's designs since she is here. She says maybe he shouldn't because of her name. She would not want people to get the wrong idea. He says she works here so it is all right. Sally says she likes to push the button and stir the pot but she is not a criminal. Shirley says again that Coco is their in. They have no choice and all are counting on Sally to come through. Shirley will not let her back down on this. Zende tells Nicole that he spied RJ and Coco backstage. He just hopes she is not using him to her advantage. He also says Sally flew to Australia and he knows she could not design if her life depended on it. There is no cash, no prospects and yet she is still in that building. They seem to be desperate. Sally tells Shirley she needs one more day to come up with something. They say no, Coco has the necklace on and she is with RJ right now. This might be good. Thomas calls right at that moment. He wants to check in on Sally after the flight. She thanks him again for inviting her. He says it was the best part of the whole trip. Finally RJ opens the package and shows Coco a large design of a Forrester original. Shirley says this is their future and how they will survive. Sally walks back in and say no, no, they will not do this. Shirley says it is now or never to make her Aunt Sally proud. Sally looks at the captured photos and mulls it over.",
