    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Bill's bedroom, Quinn was hiding in the closet as Brooke asked Bill if someone had broken in. Putting on his shirt, Bill claimed that he'd just been upset and had broken some things. He wanted to go downstairs to talk, but assuming that Liam was still home, Brooke said she and Bill needed privacy.\n\n\nBrooke hadn't liked the way she and Bill had left things, and she didn't want to be cold to him anymore. Bill figured that she'd been that way because of how everyone talked about them. Bill had been hearing negative things about himself all his life, but he didn't care. \"Loving me makes you -- you, and I can't get enough of it,\" he told Brooke, and in the closet, Quinn grimaced.\n\n\nBrooke recalled that she'd wanted to spend the rest of her life with Bill. She could picture them raising their children, but trading husbands with her sister was weird and wrong to her. She wouldn't say she didn't love Bill, but she wasn't ready to be with him after losing her life and family with Ridge.\n\n\nBill offered to continue to wait for her as he'd already done for months. He wanted her to stop calling herself a failure, and he didn't think that she'd lost Ridge. \"You outgrew him,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nAs Quinn fought her impatience in the closet, Brooke asked Bill if he'd ever thought it was too late for them. \"No, never,\" Bill replied, stroking her face.  Brooke wondered if it would be better to start over with someone new, and she figured there were thousands of women out there.\n\n\nBill didn't want anyone else, and he didn't know why Brooke wouldn't let go of a man who thought he was too good for her. Brooke said she knew what a good person Bill was, but she felt that she needed to be a good person, too. She needed a little time, and she asked if Bill could give it to her.\n\n\nBill agreed to do so, and he kissed Brooke. Brooke said she wouldn't have been able to sleep unless she'd had that talk with him. She decided to go home, and Bill walked her downstairs.\n\n\nWhen Bill returned to his room, Quinn was lying on the bed. She said she had needed to get out of her clothes, but Bill replied that she wouldn't do it there. Quinn said she'd been a pretty \"stand-up guy\" for him earlier, and Bill asked why she hadn't ruined things for him when Brooke had been there.\n\n\nQuinn guessed Bill would have loved to see Quinn and Brooke fight over him; however, Quinn didn't want to steal him from Brooke, and she wasn't sure Brooke wanted him, either. Bill stated that Brooke didn't need to know about what had gone on between him and Quinn. He felt that the freak session shouldn't have happened in the first place.\n\n\nQuinn claimed not to want her reputation dragged back into the sewer by Bill. Bill was glad because, in his view, it hadn't meant anything anyway. She said he had nothing to worry about from her.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Aly took selfies in Rick's office. Liam arrived, and she explained that she was working on her Forrester directory entry. Aly needed a photo and a title, but she didn't think \"Shadow\" was a good option. Eric had told her that she could make up another one, and Liam suggested that she call herself an HFTF intern. Aly thought it was genius.\n\n\nAly offered to try to figure out where Hope was, but Liam didn't want Aly to disturb the \"dynamic duo\" on his account. He was there because he'd just wanted to get out of the house. Aly offered to have dinner with Liam after she'd taken her photos in the studio with Oliver.\n\n\nLiam took a few pictures of Aly with her phone but asked for a rain check on dinner. He had a strong suspicion that his father would need him later that night. Liam advised Aly to make sure any guy asking her out was worth it, and she shyly replied that she'd never had a boyfriend before.\n\n\nSurprised, Liam said it was easy to do. He stated that it was like learning the words to a song she already knew. Aly's eyes softened, and Liam bade her farewell.  She smiled after he left.\n\n\nIn the studio, Oliver conducted a photo shoot with Maya. The air was awkward between them because of their past kiss. Maya said that it had been a one-time thing, and she was glad that they could still be friends. Oliver couldn't get why she wasn't married yet, and she asked why he was single. He told her not to ask if she didn't want to know. \"Maybe I do want to know...friend,\" Maya replied.\n\n\nOliver delved into his history, and Maya was surprised to learn that he'd had a relationship with Hope. He was sad to say it had ended poorly. Oliver was glad that things had worked out well for him with the Forresters, but he understood that one could only get so far without being in the Forrester family. He wondered how things would be if things had gone differently with him and Hope.\n\n\nLater, Oliver was alone when Aly hurried in, apologizing for being late. She said a friend had visited her, making her late, and she didn't have too many friends. Oliver found that hard to believe, but she replied that people thought she was too opinionated. Oliver told her that she had nothing to worry about because her last name was Forrester.\n\n\nAly was worried about what she'd worn, and she felt self-conscious before the camera. Oliver quickly put her at ease, and she realized that she kind of liked the photo session.\n\n\nAly remarked that the ladies in the sewing room had a pool going to determine if Oliver would have a date for the spring showing. Oliver advised her to bet on him being solo because the chances of him getting a date were slim. Aly said she didn't believe that, and smiling at Aly, Oliver realized that his luck might change.\n\n\nAfter the session had ended, Aly decided not to keep Oliver any later, but Oliver said that he had no one to go home to, either. He wanted her to look at her photos, but she replied that she didn't like having her picture taken. Oliver stated that he'd thought they'd had fun. Aly corrected that she'd meant that she wasn't good at taking pictures.\n\n\nOliver said that Aly didn't have to be good at taking pictures. Instead, he had to be good at it, and she was lucky that he happened to be the best. He invited Aly to see the pictures, but she didn't like to look at pictures of herself. Oliver thought that was a normal reaction, and he asked her to pick a favorite photo for the directory. She preferred that he pick it, so he selected one.\n\n\nAly wasn't excited by the picture, so Oliver suggested that they look through more photos. Aly asked him not to. She said that the women in her family, like Steffy and Hope, were gorgeous. Aly didn't believe that any picture would change the fact that she was average. Oliver wondered in what universe she'd be average. Aly didn't even know why they were discussing it because looks didn't matter.\n\n\n\"Especially when you don't see them, Ms. F. But I see you,\" Oliver replied. Aly bade Oliver a good night. At the door before exiting, she smiled and thanked him. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke asks Bill what happened to his room. He explains that it really doesn't matter. He came home from seeing her, all upset He puts his shirt back on and says they can go downstairs and talk. She says they can talk but not downstairs as they need privacy. He looks toward the closet and says their last private conversation didn't go so well. She says she did not want to leave things like that. She tells him that she does not want to be this cold, aloof person that keeps telling him to go away. Listening from her closet post, Quinn is bored to death. Bill tells Brooke that because of Katie that is all she knows how to do. But people will talk from the cradle to the grave and he's been listening to it all his life. But loving him makes her who she is and he can't get enough of it. Aly is taking selfies as she needs a photo for the Forrester directory. Liam comes in. He is not looking for Hope; says the car just drove itself. She doesn't have to look for the dynamic duo. He just wanted to get out of the house. She calls him a genius when he helps her with her title instead of just shadow. She says she can go get her photos taken and then they could have dinner if he wants. He asks for a rain check. He says he feels his dad is going to need some propping up tonight. And he advises her than when one of those love struck puppies asks her out that he really appreciates and respects her. She blurts out that she's never had a boyfriend before. He's surprised but says it's really easy. It's like learning the words to a song you already know. Brooke tells Bill that it wasn't all bad or wrong. They loved each other. They wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. He says there is no expiration date on that so she can hold on to that. She says she can imagine them raising Will and RJ but what she can't get past is trading husbands with her sister. That is just wrong and too weird. He agrees it is taboo but haven't they already paid that price. He wants to wait as he has for months even though she told him there was nothing to wait for. He tells her she is not a failure. She did not lose Ridge; she outgrew him. Maya goes through a photo shoot of glam poses for Oliver. She tries to act normal despite their one kiss between them. She says she is glad it meant nothing more and they can still be friends. Somehow they get off on the subject and he tells her that he once had a thing for Hope. He thought he had found it but it ended badly. He can't help but think how things would be if they'd gone a little differently. He owes a lot to the Forresters but his life changed the day he dropped out of being a potential Forrester. It all depends on your last name around here and those married to it. He assures her though that he is not dissatisfied. Oliver shoots Aly's pictures although she is a little apprehensive. He thinks she is a natural and manages to bring out the best in her. She says he is the talk of the office if he is single or available. Maybe they will find out at the Spring showing. He says maybe things will look up for him by then. Later he wants to show Aly the pictures. She hates looking at pictures of herself. She points out that all the women in her family are gorgeous. There is Steffy and Hope and she is just average. He says on what universe. Bill tells Brooke that he does not want to start over. There is no one else for him but her. She says she needs more time. She vows to be a better person, a better mother and do something that she is proud of. He says he can give her the time; he kisses her. He comes back to find Quinn laid out on his bed. He commends her for being quiet and not giving him away. She says she does not want to steal him away from Brooke so what would be the point if she and Brooke got into it fighting on the floor and pulling hair out. She says he is so shallow and arrogant but she does like him a little more now that he's had his heart broken a little thanks to Brooke. Bill says Brooke does not need to know about his. She thinks he means the whip. He says no, the two of them. There is no \"you and me\". This little freak session where she jumped his bones never should have happened in the first place. She asks really does he think she wants anyone else to know about this. He threw her reputation in the sewer once before and she's not about to let that happen again. He says good as this meant nothing anyway. Quinn says he has nothing to worry about from her.",
