Brooke said that Deacon was with Quinn, but if he hadn't been, it might have been their chance. Brooke clearly stated that there could be nothing between them as long as Quinn was in the picture.\n\n\nBrooke told Deacon that he was very important and very special to her. She admitted that she had thought about what they'd once shared. Deacon looked hopeful, and Brooke smiled. They hugged, and Deacon left.\n\n\nOutside Brooke's house, unseen by Deacon and Brooke, Katie had arrived and she'd watched Brooke and Deacon embrace. After Deacon had gone, Katie called out to Brooke. \"What's going on?\" Katie asked. Brooke smiled and said that Deacon often stopped by and checked in on her, \"He's been there for me,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nKatie reminded Brooke that Deacon was engaged to Quinn. Brooke acknowledged that she was not romantically involved with Deacon. Katie pressured Brooke for more information. Brooke finally admitted that Deacon had helped her with her drinking problem because he understood.\n\n\nKatie said she would have helped Brooke, but she'd thought Brooke had had it under control. Brooke lamented that it had started with a few glasses of wine and had escalated to a lot of vodka, and she'd spent a lot of time alone in a big empty house. Brooke quickly noted that she wasn't jealous of Katie, but she was unhappy.\n\n\n\"I'm not happy, and I want to be, and I'm gonna fix this. Deacon understands,\" Brooke declared. Katie looked skeptical. She advised that Brooke could have turned to anyone but Deacon. Brooke professed that Deacon was incredibly sensitive and helped her to stay away from drinking. He had helped her to realize she didn't need to drink.\n\n\nBrooke said she'd been attending A.A. meetings, and that was where she'd seen Deacon. Katie warned that if Deacon was struggling, he might not be the best person to help her. Brooke disagreed and claimed they had a pact that they would help each other if they wanted to drink. She repeatedly stated that Deacon had been generous, kind, and amazing. \"Really -- Deacon has been incredible,\" Brooke gushed.\n\n\nKatie worried. \"Are you developing feelings for him?\" Katie asked. She quizzed Brooke about an attraction and falling for him again. Brooke professed that Deacon was a gentleman. Katie reiterated that Deacon was engaged to Quinn.\n\n\nBrooke said she understood, and she wanted to get her life back under control. She planned to do that with the help of Forrester and Deacon. She told Katie she was on her way to Forrester Creations to get back to work. Katie was pleased that Brooke was returning to work, but she was puzzled about Deacon.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn reveled in returning to her old job. She sat in her office at her old desk and put her feet up on it. Wyatt joined her, and Quinn told him how happy she was to return. \"I'm back,\" she crowed. Wyatt agreed that Rick had given her another chance, but Wyatt added that everyone at Forrester would be looking over her shoulder. Quinn acknowledged that she had to prove herself, but she added that she reported to Rick and no one else. She appreciated the opportunity. Wyatt congratulated her and left for a meeting.\n\n\nDeacon entered Forrester and saw the door ajar to Quinn's old office. He saw her sitting at the desk with her feet up. He suddenly recalled Brooke's words that he might have a chance with Brooke. He entered the office and wondered what Quinn was doing there and how she had gotten past security.\n\n\nQuinn told him that Rick had invited her back to Forrester and given her old job back to her. She called Deacon her good luck charm. Quinn explained that her customers had missed her. Deacon congratulated her, and they hugged.\n\n\nQuinn sniffed something. \"What's that? Why do you smell like perfume?\" Quinn asked. Deacon looked guilty. She quizzed him about the scent. \"Your friend from A.A. is a woman,\" Quinn noted. She added that his friend had very good taste in perfume.\n\n\nDeacon apologized for not telling her the truth, but Quinn interrupted. She said she had known it all had to be secret. She hoped the woman was grateful for all of Deacon's help.\n\n\nQuinn gushed about how Deacon had helped her. She remembered that she'd been on the roof, ready to jump, with Bill egging her on. She recalled all the pain she'd caused, but Deacon had saved her.\n\n\nQuinn marveled that she had become a new woman with Deacon's help. She had renewed her relationship with her son and worked toward earning his forgiveness. She was glad to have a man who loved and supported her. She noted that Deacon had been improving himself for the sake of their relationship. \"Just do not ever come home smelling like perfume again,\" she said. Quinn hugged Deacon.\n\n\nBrooke entered. \"What are you doing here?\" Brooke asked. \"Your son rehired me,\" Quinn crowed. Brooke doubted her and said Rick would never do that, and it had to have been a mistake.\n\n\nQuinn grew angry and said that anything that was good for her was unacceptable to Brooke. Quinn accused Brooke of undermining and sabotaging her happiness. Quinn got closer to Brooke and smelled Brooke's perfume. Quinn turned angrily on Deacon. \"Your friend from A.A. is Brooke,\" Quinn accused. Brooke and Deacon looked guilty.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam and Ivy discussed Rick's latest schemes at Forrester. Ivy said that Quinn had returned to work at Rick's invitation. Liam was amazed because he said Rick knew that Quinn was crazy. Ivy said Quinn wanted everyone to believe she had been transformed, thanks to her engagement to Deacon.\n\n\nLiam shook his head, but Ivy said there had been requests for Quinn's designs. Liam looked skeptical, but Ivy acknowledged that Ivy and Quinn had very different styles. Ivy didn't want to defend Quinn, but she had to admit that Quinn was an incredible artist.\n\n\nIvy and Liam agreed that Quinn was volatile. They worried about what might happen if something didn't go her way. \"Quinn Fuller is dangerous,\" Liam announced. Ivy nodded, but she added that Quinn's actions had had one unintentional positive outcome because she and Liam had ended up together. Liam and Ivy kissed. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Deacon tells Brooke that he is right. Brooke says he is with Quinn so other than that it could happen. He is very special to her and the many times they shared. But there are other things to think about. And he should go. He does but as she gives him a hug, Katie sees it. She calls out to Brooke and asks what is going on. Quinn tells Wyatt that Rick is not going to give her a free ride. Rick will be watching over her but at least she does not have to suck up to Ivy. Liam says no; Rick has made a lot of questionable decisions but this one makes no sense. Quinn has not changed that much. Her picture still should have an X on it. He says another zero on the bottom line is too much a risk. Ivy says Quinn seemed very happy so perhaps Deacon has had a change on her. Liam says no matter what she says, Quinn Fuller is dangerous. Brooke tells Katie she is going to the office. Deacon just came by as he has been there for her .with her drinking. She explains that it started with one drink and then two and then .alone and the house empty and she was not happy. Deacon helped fix that. He understands her. She did not want to bother Katie. Katie said she should have; anybody but Deacon. Deacon goes to FC to see Quinn. She calls him her good luck charm. He's flabbergasted that she has been asked back at FC and wants to celebrate right now. She smells perfume on him and asks about it. She says he smells like a bouquet of flowers. She guesses that the one from AA must be a woman with good taste. He says yes and he will tell her more if she wants. She says no. She is not the jealous type and she hopes the lady is grateful that she has Deacon on her side. Brooke tells Katie that Deacon is part of the AA program and he can come over any time to remind her that she does not need a drink. He understands what she is going through. In fact he got rid of all the bottles she had on hand. He is a lifeline, so generous and kind and amazing. Katie asks if she is starting to have feelings for him. Brooke says it is an intense attraction. He is a gentleman, kind and supportive. No lines have been crossed. And as long as he is with Quinn nothing can happen between then. She has it under control. And now she is going back to work and stay positive. Liam tells Ivy that she will always have to grovel to Quinn now. Ivy says not everything she has done has ended in disaster. They were together because of Quinn. Quinn tells Deacon that if she were his friend she would want to be helped by him. He has pulled her back from the edge of disaster and now she is back with her son at FC making jewelry again. And when she goes home tonight she will not be alone. She will have this wonderful man. She knows the good he can do and would never stop him form doing that just do not come home smelling like perfume again. Brooke walks in and does not believe Quinn is working there again and threatens to go find out from Rick. Quinn chastises her and says she has a right to a second chance. Then Quinn smells her perfume and guesses it is Brooke who is the AA patron that Deacon is helping.",
