Sally still wasn't sure about the plan and didn't like using her sister. Saul replied that he didn't, either, but they were desperate. \"Who's desperate?\" Thomas asked from the doorway.\n\n\nThe Spectra gang claimed that Saul was desperate while searching a dating website. Shirley said Thomas should give Saul pointers, but Saul said he didn't need any. Thomas had always wanted to see how one of those dating sites worked, but Sally slammed shut the laptop, saying that Saul was shy.\n\n\nThomas offered for him and Sally to go on a double-date with Saul and whomever he found on the site. Sally sat on the laptop, which was right in front of Saul as he sat at the desk, and she said it was a good idea. Thomas looked perplexed by her sitting on the laptop.\n\n\nSally guessed that Thomas was there because he couldn't get enough of her. She slid off the desk, saying that she was free for lunch, and he was buying. Thomas left the office with Sally.\n\n\nSaul stated that Thomas was all wrong for Sally. To Saul's surprise, Shirley agreed. Shirley said that the closer Sally got to Thomas, the harder it would be for Sally to poach designs. Saul didn't know how they'd get Sally to see that \"Mr. Pecs\" was all wrong for her.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Sally noted that she and Thomas were back in the place that they'd met. Thomas admired Sally for braving the wrath of his sister and family to be with him in Australia. He called her fearless, and she told him to keep going. Thomas joked that she'd had enough compliments for the day.\n\n\nTaking Sally's hand, Thomas concluded that she was one of a kind, and he hoped that Sydney would be just the beginning for them. Sally called the two families a volatile mix. He said he didn't know everything about her, but he'd have fun finding out. Thomas was surprised that they hadn't wound up sharing a room in Sydney and asked what was holding Sally back. In reply, Sally leaned in and kissed him.\n\n\nIn the design office at Forrester, R.J. and Coco worked. He wanted to know more about her. She said that being a Spectra was pretty much all there was. R.J. said she wasn't her great-aunt, who was the Spectra R.J. knew about. Coco conveyed that she'd been raised by her grams because her parents had left the picture early. It was why she was so excited for R.J. about his family reuniting.\n\n\nR.J. opened up about his father, who wasn't the typical father. He said Ridge had been a ladies' man back in the day, but by then, Ridge should be married to R.J.'s mother and totally committed to her and to the family. Coco wondered if being Ridge's namesake made R.J. a player, too. R.J. joked that she should ask around about it. He said that he was glad that his father was chilling out with all the scandal and drama from the past.\n\n\nAs R.J. and Coco worked, he asked what she was thinking. She said that R.J. was a good kisser. She guessed that she had to not be, or else he would have tried it again. She'd barely gotten the words out of her mouth before he swooped in and kissed her.\n\n\nBackstage, Ridge messaged Brooke to find out where she was and what he should tell R.J. Katie arrived. Brooke hadn't told Katie why the wedding had been called off, but Katie believed she knew the answer -- Quinn. Katie had suspected it all along and asked what he was going to tell R.J. Distracted by his phone, Ridge replied that he didn't know.\n\n\nKatie snatched the phone and asked what had happened when Brooke had looked for him on the beach in Australia. Katie guessed he and Quinn had found a romantic spot to make love. Ridge said not to be ridiculous. He yelled that he'd kissed Quinn, and that was it. Katie repeated that he'd kissed his father's wife the day before he was supposed to marry Katie's sister.\n\n\nRidge got his phone back and sent off a message as Katie said she'd had her suspicions, and Brooke hadn't wanted to believe it. Ridge replied that all he'd done had been to kiss Quinn. He said it wasn't a big deal. Katie contended that he'd betrayed his father and R.J., who believed his family would be back together again. Ridge said he would put the family back together, and he would fix it. Katie asked how he'd contain it.\n\n\nKatie believed Eric would find out about it and wondered if Eric had been right not to trust Ridge a short time back. Ridge stated that nothing had changed, and he would fix the family. Katie asked how Ridge could be attracted to a nutcase. Ridge didn't know what had happened, but he planned to make it up to Brooke.\n\n\nRidge suggested that Katie talk to Brooke. Katie was shocked that he expected her to plead his case. Ridge said he needed someone to tell Brooke how sorry he was. Katie didn't think he was sorry. She said he'd known Quinn was unobtainable, so he'd had to go for it. Ridge said he'd thought Katie was his friend, and he didn't need analyzing at that moment.\n\n\nKatie said Ridge needed a good shrink to tell him why he'd want a woman who'd cheat on her husband with her husband's son. Katie asked if Ridge would repay Eric and Brooke for their love by locking lips with a psycho. Katie guessed that Ridge's ego needed constant feeding, and he'd had to see if his charm still worked. Katie congratulated Ridge on proving that he could still bring women to their knees and asked if it made him feel good about himself.\n\n\nThough Katie and Brooke had been through a lot, Katie believed that Brooke deserved better. Ridge stated that he wouldn't give up, and he'd win Brooke back. Katie said that Brooke wasn't a doormat, and Katie asked what Ridge thought Bill would do when he found out.\n\n\nRidge didn't think Brooke would go back to Bill. Katie asked if Ridge had really ended his \"destiny\" with Brooke by throwing it away on a cheap thrill. Ridge admitted that he'd screwed up. He didn't know why, and he didn't even like \"the woman.\" Katie said he sounded ridiculous because he'd risked his family over Quinn.\n\n\nRidge didn't think he should have left Brooke alone in Australia. Katie replied that Brooke might not be alone because Bill hadn't returned to Los Angeles yet. Ridge said that Bill had better stay away from Brooke. Katie replied that Ridge couldn't do anything about it, and if Bill and Brooke were meant to be together, they would be.\n\n\nIn Australia, Brooke touched empty clothes racks in her closet. She flashed back on the incidences she'd seen between Quinn and Ridge, the times Katie had warned about Quinn and Ridge, and seeing Quinn and Ridge kiss. Brooke sobbed and rushed out of her hotel room.\n\n\nBrooke wandered around outside the opera house. She sent a call from Ridge to voicemail.\n\n\nBill sat outside the opera house. On a call with Justin, Bill said he didn't know when he'd be home. He wasn't ready to get on a plane yet. After the call, Bill flashed back to times he'd had with Brooke. He headed up some stairs and spotted Brooke standing on the far side of the opera house.\n\n\nBill strode over to Brooke. She touched his face, and he touched hers. They hugged, and Bill looked relieved.\n\n\n",
