It hurt Donna that Eric questioned her loyalty, because he'd always been her priority. Hope reasoned that Stephanie might be back, but Eric was married to Donna. Donna kept telling herself that; however, Eric was at the wedding with Stephanie, who'd use the event to her full advantage.\n\n\nHope griped that Steffy was doing the same, and Donna imagined Stephanie complaining about Ridge and Eric being stuck with the Logans. Hope disliked seeing Donna so filled with doom and gloom. Donna realized that the pull of the past was strong, and she fretted that every moment that Eric spent with Stephanie made it worse.\n\n\nAt Whip and Taylor's wedding, everyone gasped as Ridge strode down the aisle and stated that he couldn't live with himself if he didn't speak up. Ridge said that he loved Taylor, their children, and the life that they'd shared in that home. He felt that Phoebe was smiling down on her exceptional mother. Ridge realized that Whip loved Taylor the way she deserved to be loved, and Ridge saw happiness in her face once again. He couldn't let the day proceed without letting Taylor know that. Ridge kissed Taylor's cheek and shook Whip's hand.\n\n\nThe wedding continued with Aggie reciting \"Love is a Challenge.\" Next, Stephanie read an Emily Dickinson poem about hope. The whole time, Eric couldn't take his eyes off Stephanie. The minister instructed Taylor and Whip to make their declarations of consent. Taylor hesitated, and the minister asked if she would indeed marry that man. \"Taylor?\" Whip prompted.\n\n\n\"I will! I mean, I do!\" Taylor exclaimed. The couple then committed personal vows to each other. Whip said that Taylor had completed him, and he wanted to give her the world. He wished they'd have endless days of sunshine, but he knew they'd face challenges. He vowed to give her what she needed and to be more than she expected.\n\n\nTaylor said that Whip had given her the greatest gift that she'd ever had: certainty, the foundation of a strong marriage. She loved that he made her laugh. She vowed to never lose the joy he'd given her, because their love had grown out of laughter. It would last until death parted them.\n\n\nWhip and Taylor exchanged their rings, and the minister pronounced them man and wife. The guests cheered as the newlyweds shared a lingering kiss.\n\n\nDuring the reception, Oliver warned Aggie about blatantly ogling Nick. Taylor told Ridge that it wasn't nice to scare the bride on her wedding day. Ridge said he'd been compelled to let the newlyweds know that they had his full support. Stephanie received a phone call, and when she answered it near the terrace, she was surprised to hear Donna on the line.\n\n\nStephanie asked if Donna were checking up on Eric. Donna said that she was calling about the living arrangements. Stephanie agreed that it was a tense situation, but Eric would be offended if she declined. \"Yes, well, I'll be offended if you say yes,\" Donna retorted. Donna thought it was embarrassing for Stephanie to live somewhere that she wasn't wanted. \"Do us both a favor and not walk through that door tonight,\" Donna advised and clicked off the line.\n\n\nOliver captured everyone's attention to make a toast. He said that even in their childhood, Whip had fashioned goals. Oliver's goal had been to be nothing like Whip-ever. Though Oliver had never wanted to be like Whip, Oliver envied Whip that day. Oliver said that Whip had been bound to get it right eventually. Everyone toasted the newlyweds.\n\n\nSteffy uttered to Oliver that it was her turn, and then they could have some fun. In her toast, Steffy took credit for the union, since she'd pushed Taylor into online dating. Steffy said love happened when one least expected and sometimes with a person that one least expected.\n\n\nNext, Whip thanked everyone for the support-especially Ridge, who'd surprisingly hopped on board. Whip reflected on being nervous when he'd met Taylor at Insomnia that night. He admitted that he'd wanted to run, but he couldn't bear to see her stood up. She'd had him before they'd even said \"hello,\" and he'd known that she was the one. He called Taylor the love of his life, and he thanked her for making him the happiest man on earth. Whip kissed his wife and told his guests, \"Go home now.\" Everyone laughed as Whip and Taylor continued kissing. \n\n\n",
    "yt": "\n\nBrooke confronts Whip about why he and Sandy are hiding that they are related and why they are both suddenly involved with Bridget\u2019s life.  Sandy learns more discouraging information about her case.   She is besieged with fear, sadness and anger when she revisits the evidence in her case.  Bridget asks Stephanie if she will accept an important position within her and Nick\u2019s family.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge stands up and says he can't let this happen. He has to speak up or he can't live with himself. He tells Taylor and the entire room that he loves her and he is remembering all the memories here in this house. He feels Phoebe is here looking down on them. He knows Whip loves her and he hopes they will have new memories. He could not continue without saying that to her. Aggie reads a poem followed by an Emily Dickinson one read by Stephanie. There is a pregnant pause when the minister asked Taylor to say \"I do\". Taylor and Whip have no prepared vows as they want to speak from the heart. Afterwards, they are pronounced man and wife. They kiss as the guests applaud. Donna cries to Hope that she feels Stephanie everywhere, here at the office and at home. She feels like she is being pushed out. She is afraid that Stephanie will milk this wedding for all it's worth. Hope feels the same about Steffy. Donna can't help thinking about it. She can see all the stupid drinking of martinis and dancing between Stephanie and Eric. Taylor tells Ridge that it wasn't funny that he tried to scare her on her wedding day. He says that was not his intention; he just wanted to let her and Whip know they had his blessing. As best man, Oliver makes a toast. During the wedding, Donna calls Stephanie and tells her they need to talk more about the living arrangements. She needs to do them a favor and not walk through that door tonight. Steffy makes a toast and says she takes responsibility for this match as she turned her mom on to online dating. Whip thanks them and says from that very first date he knew Taylor was the one \u0096 the love of his life and he wants to thank her for making him the luckiest man in the world. He quips now they can all go home.",
