    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie and Ridge awakened in bed, and Katie told Ridge she was happy. Ridge said their relationship was \"the best thing I never saw coming.\" Katie agreed. \"Funny how things work out,\" she said. Katie offered to make breakfast, but Ridge said he had to get to the meeting he had called at Forrester.\n\n\nKatie kissed him, and Ridge said he didn't want to leave, but he had to go. Katie was glad they were together. \"Get used to it. I'm exactly where I want to be,\" Ridge said. Katie reminded him that Brooke would never give up. Ridge assured her that Brooke was in his past. He was confident she would learn to accept it.\n\n\nLater, Donna stopped in to see Katie. Donna noted that Katie positively glowed with happiness. Katie said that Ridge had changed everything. Katie confided that Ridge supported and respected her, and it felt good. Katie added that the house, which she'd felt was too big and lonely without Bill, seemed warmer and full of life. Donna hugged Katie, but Donna added that it was odd to see Katie with Ridge. \"I never wanted to be happy at Brooke's expense,\" Katie confessed.\n\n\nKatie and Donna worried about R.J., but Donna added R.J. had already comforted Brooke when he'd found out his parents would no longer live together. Donna promised that they would all get through the awkwardness eventually.\n\n\nKatie asked about Brooke. Donna worried that Brooke had been cynical and spent a lot of time alone. Katie countered that everyone had to be alone sometime. Katie apologized for her candor, but she added that Brooke had often been defined by hopping from one relationship to another.\n\n\nTalk turned to business, and Katie warned that Ridge planned to be very involved at Forrester. Donna was sure that Eric would be glad. Katie noted that a lot of people would be unhappy, but Ridge had a clear vision of what he wanted at Forrester.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric and Brooke met, and Eric was worried about Brooke. Eric wondered what Ridge had been thinking because he had originally returned home to be with Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke said that things hadn't worked out. She said she understood that she had to stop defining herself through the man she was with. She admitted she wasn't even sure who she was anymore because it had been so long since she had been without a man. She claimed she could get along without a man.\n\n\nEric gushed that Brooke was beautiful inside and out -- one of the most wonderful human beings he had ever known. Eric added that Ridge's decision made no sense.\n\n\nBrooke acknowledged that Ridge had made his decision. Eric asked about Bill, but Brooke insisted she needed some time alone. Brooke decided to redirect her energy to her kids and back into Forrester business. Eric agreed it would be good to have her back. He had to run to a meeting, and Brooke volunteered to sit in. \"I'm gonna change, Eric. You'll see,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Hope and Rick discussed that Brooke had seemed depressed, but Hope noted that Brooke had gone out the previous night. Hope and Rick agreed they were worried, but Hope added, \"Brooke Logan bends, but she does not break.\"\n\n\nCaroline and Carter arrived for a meeting that Ridge had called with everyone. Rick quizzed Carter about the meeting because Rick knew that Carter had been Ridge's right-hand man. Carter deflected the question and said that Ridge would arrive soon.\n\n\nIn the Forrester photo studio, Oliver opened an email from Ridge that shared Ridge's distaste for all of the HFTF photographs. Maya entered, and Oliver was worried. Maya assured Oliver that it wouldn't be a problem, but Oliver wasn't so sure.\n\n\nRidge arrived at Forrester in a good mood. \"Hello, beautiful,\" he greeted Pam. Ridge asked if everyone had shown how important Pam was to the business. Pam asked for a raise, and Ridge said it had already been handled. He added that he wanted Oliver at the meeting. Pam said she would tell Oliver.\n\n\nIn the meeting, Rick, Hope, Brooke, Eric, Carter, and Caroline told Ridge about the success of the Hope for the Future line. Rick added that HFTF had done well at the Rodeo Drive boutique, and he shared that Wyatt's latest idea about the Stephanie Forrrester jewelry display had been a major success.\n\n\nRick added that the couture line had also been doing well. Ridge interrupted and asked why the company had a split personality. Ridge displayed two ads side by side on the office screen -- couture on one side and HFTF on the other.\n\n\nRidge said that Hope's line appeared to be from a different design house altogether. Hope balked, but Ridge insisted that the new campaign for Hope For the Future needed a new photographer -- \"Oliver's not cutting it,\" Ridge said. He added that he wanted a more European look that complimented the couture line, and he was shutting down the Los Angeles photo studio immediately.\n\n\nOliver entered. Ridge compared the photos on the screen for Oliver, and he said the two campaigns did not work well together. Carter explained there were creative differences. \"You're firing me?\" Oliver snapped at Ridge. \"Yes,\" Ridge said. Oliver left, visibly furious.\n\n\nBrooke, Hope, Caroline, and Rick argued with Ridge that Oliver was like a member of the family, but Ridge insisted it was business. Rick stood up and shouted that Ridge was not CEO and had no decision-making power. \"That's the other reason I called this meeting,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nCaroline defended Rick and his business decisions. She maintained that the company had been profitable. Hope agreed. Brooke pointed out that Ridge had left the Los Angeles office and wanted nothing to do with it or anyone when he had chosen to stay in Paris.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that Ridge had no right to dismantle a team that had worked to restore the HFTF and couture lines to profitability. \"This team has proven themselves more than once,\" Brooke said. She added that Rick had earned his right to be president. She claimed that nothing needed fixing, and Ridge's assessment of everything was wrong.\n\n\nBrooke warned that Ridge's coup would not work. Ridge claimed that his decisions were purely motivated by business. \"It has nothing to do with you,\" he said to Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke scoffed, She addressed Eric and noted that there could only be one president. \"Is it Ridge or our son? Brooke asked as she scowled.\n\n\nOliver returned to the studio and told Maya that he'd been fired. He surmised that Ridge was going to steamroll his way back into control. Maya was shocked that Ridge had fired Oliver. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Katie and Ridge bask in their newfound love. At a Forrester Creations meeting, Ridge takes charge and fires an integral player on the team. Tension rises amongst the group when he subsequently tells Rick that this tenure as President needs to end now. Brooke turns to Eric for his support of Rick.",
    "tvmega_recap": "In bed, both Katie and Ridge lay in each other's arms and profess how happy they are and how things worked out. He wishes he had not called that meeting now. He'd rather stay in bed all day. Katie knows that Brooke won't give up so easy. He says she will as she is his past and he's exactly where he wants to be. Eric tells Brooke that he is happy she came in today. He was beginning to worry about her. She ways destiny works both ways and she needed to learn from this in how to define herself without a man. He tells her she is a beautiful, unique Brooke, beautiful inside and out ..one of the most wonderful human beings he has ever known. She says she does not need a man in her life. She will have more energy now for her kids like RJ was very disappointed when this happened. Eric says he doesn't get Ridge what he thinks he can not get with Brooke. He understands that he was upset with the thing with Bill but to just slam the door on their marriage is so unforgiving. Brooke says she will learn to move on with her life and value herself more. She wants to get more involved with work and be a valuable part of Forrester again. She says she hears there is a meeting and she'd like to sit in. Eric says of course. She says she is gonna change; he'll see. Donna waltzes right up to Katie's bedroom and Katie tells her that she is so happy with Ridge. He has changed everything. This house was way too big and now it is filled with laughter and fun. Donna is happy for her but says it is still a little weird that it is with Ridge. Katie says she loves her sister very much but choices were made that have changed their lives forever. Things are different now and they will all have to adjust. Rick tells Hope that Brooke told him that she was going through a dark spot right now but they'd keep an eye on her and be there if she needs them. Caroline and Carter come in and asks Rick if he knows why Ridge called this meeting \u0096 just said management. Oliver finds out online that Ridge doesn't like any of the HFTF shots. Ridge arrives at the office all chipper and even hands out a compliment and gives Pam a raise. He tells her to call Oliver into this meeting. Rick is speaking when Ridge gets there. He says sales are up for HFTF, the Stephanie collection is going well especially in their Rodeo Drive Boutique, their crown jewel and he tells Hope that is all due to Wyatt. Ridge wants to compare the couture line with HFTF. He wants to keep it but not make it so confusing that it has it's own separate label. He shows them graphics and compares the richness and depth that Couture has that Hope doesn't. He wants a new ad campaign and a new photographer \u0096 Oliver has got to go. The Paris studio is much better and he is closing down the photo department here immediately. They are all shocked. Right on cue, Oliver walks in and in short order Ridge points out the difference in the graphics from Paris and tells Oliver that he is fired for creative differences. Oliver says it is his company and his call and he will pack his stuff and be out of here at end of day. Rick stands up first and says Ridge is incredible to do this without consulting them first. Hope points out that Oliver has been here for years. Brooke thinks he ought to reconsider. Rick snaps that he is President of this company. Ridge says only another reason why he called this meeting. Oliver grouses to Maya that he was fired. Ridge is taking over this company and if they don't know it by now, they will. Ridge tells Rick that his tenure as President has not gone unnoticed. He should be very proud but he's going to lead Forrester into the future. They all chime in that things have gone well even without Ridge. Brooke says he can not dismantle this team. They have earned their rights here. He is not going to steamroll her children. His assessment is wrong and nothing needs fixing. She is not going to stand here and watch him tear down everything they built. And that little coup that he is planning won't fly as Rick took over when Ridge wanted nothing to do with the L.A. office and he earned it by merit. She will not let him take this away from Rick. Ridge says believe it or not, but this has nothing to do with Brooke. Brooke turns to Eric and says there can only be one President so who is it going to be \u0096 Ridge or their son.",
