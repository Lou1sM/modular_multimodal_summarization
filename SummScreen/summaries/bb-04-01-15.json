    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Deacon admitted to Quinn that Brooke was indeed his friend from A.A. Deacon apologized for not telling Quinn the truth, but he reminded Quinn that he and Brooke shared a child together. Deacon didn't want Quinn to get upset with Brooke. Quinn scowled at Deacon, and Brooke glared at Quinn.\n\n\nDeacon explained that he had gone to the same A.A. meeting that Brooke had attended, and he'd overheard Brooke telling her story. \"I could hear the desperation in her voice, and we made a pact to be there for each other in the dark times,\" he said.\n\n\nDeacon worried that Quinn would go ballistic if she heard that it was Brooke who was his A.A. friend. \"Please, can we move past here,\" Deacon begged Quinn. \"I can't believe you,\" Quinn shouted, but she softened. She wished Deacon had told her the truth, but she understood that he'd had to save Brooke from herself. Quinn smiled and assured Brooke and Deacon that it would all be fine.\n\n\nQuinn advised Deacon that she never wanted secrets between them again. Quinn turned to Brooke and told her they would be seeing much more of one another at Forrester. Quinn received a text message to attend a human resources meeting, and she left.\n\n\nAfter Quinn had gone, Brooke warned Deacon not to trust Quinn, and she marveled that Rick had rehired her. Deacon confessed that seeing Quinn at her best had convinced him that he had made the right choice in deciding to marry her.\n\n\nDeacon tried to persuade Brooke not to cut him out of her life. He promised to be there for her, and he added that she would always be his unattainable woman, but he and Quinn were good for each other. He promised to always care for Brooke, but Brooke wondered why Deacon couldn't see that Quinn would never change.\n\n\nDeacon argued that Quinn had changed, and Rick had seen it. Deacon maintained that she was talented. Brooke argued that Quinn had nearly killed Ridge. Deacon said that Bill was the one who had nearly killed Ridge. Deacon's phone rang, and he had to leave. He and Brooke embraced.\n\n\nQuinn watched, unseen, from the doorway. Brooke and Deacon agreed they would always care for one another. Deacon left, and Quinn hid so that he wouldn't see her. After Deacon was out of sight, Quinn entered the office and confronted Brooke. \"You pathetic lush. This is a new low even for you. Who the hell do you think you are?\" Quinn asked. Brooke looked surprised.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill played with Will, and Katie joined them. She had some paperwork for Bill, but Bill said she was the vice president. She didn't need him to look at it. She countered that she wasn't looking for approval. They agreed she wanted to suck up to the boss. Bill got Will to say, \"suck up,\" and they all laughed.\n\n\nBill and Katie discussed that Liam -- the company president -- needed to do some sucking up, but Bill said it had been a bad day for Liam and Ivy. Katie wondered what Rick had done. Bill explained that Rick had rehired Quinn Fuller. Katie was surprised, but Bill added that Forrester customers apparently were clamoring for both Quinn and Ivy's jewelry. Katie told Bill that she had been worried about Brooke because Brooke had been involved with someone.\n\n\nBill was furious because he thought it was Ridge, and that meant Ridge was two-timing his niece. Katie said it was not Ridge, but it was someone who was almost a family member -- and he had supported Brooke. Katie confessed it was Deacon Sharpe.\n\n\nBill was surprised that Brooke would be involved with a dishonest ex-con. Bill wanted to intervene, but Katie said they needed to stay out of it. He agreed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Maya looked at a picture of Rick and flashed back to when she and Nicole had had their discussion about how Maya had been Myron. \"You're my brother,\" Nicole had said. Nicole had wondered about the operations and procedures that Maya had undergone. \"Why couldn't you just wear the clothes?\" Nicole had asked. Maya had argued that she had always been female.\n\n\nMaya had reminded Nicole that she could never tell Rick or anyone the truth about Maya. \"You take care of me, and I'll take care of you,\" Nicole had said. Rick entered and interrupted Maya's thoughts. He asked if she'd heard that he'd rehired Quinn Fuller. Maya was surprised.\n\n\nRick asked how things had gone with Nicole. Maya didn't seem positive, but Rick had anticipated that Nicole and Maya had been working on their relationship. Nicole showed up and chatted with Rick. He was looking forward to getting to know her better.\n\n\nRick encouraged Maya to take Nicole along for a tour of Forrester and to a fitting and to introduce her to everyone because he expected them to see more of Nicole at Forrester. Maya stammered that she would just make it a quick fitting or cancel it. Rick said Nicole could hang out with him. Maya did not want to leave Nicole alone with Rick, but he insisted. Rick said he wanted to learn all about Maya from her sister. Maya looked nervous, but she left.\n\n\nAfter Maya had gone, Rick discussed his family with Nicole then told her about Amber and Caroline -- women who had both lied to him. \"What I have with Maya -- what you see is what you get,\" he said. Nicole understood that honesty was really important to Rick, but she added that Maya had not always been open and honest. Outside the office, Maya overheard Nicole. Maya burst in and told Nicole she had said enough. Both Rick and Nicole were surprised by Maya's behavior.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Quinn becomes irate when she realizes that Deacon\u2019s friend from their twelve-step meetings is Brooke. Afraid that Nicole might reveal her secret, Maya makes every effort to try and keep her sister from spending any time alone with Rick. Bill interrogates Katie about why she has been so concerned about Brooke lately. Quinn proves to Deacon that she is a changed person while remaining calm about his friendship with Brooke.",
    "tvmega_recap": "When she confronts Brooke, Quinn realizes she is wearing the same perfume she smelt on Deacon. She asks Deacon if Brooke is his friend from AA. Deacon admits she is and he could not just leave her in her hour of need. He went to the meeting alone and had no idea Brooke would be there. He realized her story was worse than he originally thought it was and they made a pact to help each other in times of need. He hopes Quinn can get over this as Brooke is doing good now and has not had another drink since that meeting. She says she can not believe him. She has been telling him and everyone else at FC that she is a different Quinn, a more likeable Quinn and she could not be prouder of Deacon. He is trying to be a good man and improve himself and he reached out to help a friend. She doesn't want there to be secrets between them though and she wishes he had told her it was Brooke. She gets a phone call and has to go attend to some paperwork concerning her being back at work. She says she knows she will be seeing a lot more of Brooke and she will not disappoint. Deacon has to believe that Quinn is right and she is different now. Brooke says if she is it is because she with Deacon now. She reminds him the last time Quinn was at FC it almost cost Ridge his life. Deacon reminds her that it was Bill that threw him into the Gulf. Brooke is still shocked that Deacon will marry Quinn. He repeats they are good for each other and Brooke will always be that untamable Logan woman. They hug and Deacon leaves and closes the door. Bill plays with Will at the office and tells Katie that she is VP and does not have to run everything past him. It is the President that needs to suck up if he wants to keep his job. He is driving Ivy back to FC where there is plenty of drama today as they have hired Quinn back. Rick said the public was demanding Quinn's work but he knows it is really just to stick it to Ivy. And that is not right and one more reason to take the company out of Rick's hands. Maya has a lot on her mind with thinking of her conversation with Nicole about being Myron. Rick comes in and tells her that he re-hired Quinn. Nicole walks in and gushes about wanting a tour of the place and especially to see a photo shoot. Rick encourages Maya to do that for her sister. And to be sure and introduce her to everyone as they will be seeing a lot more of Nicole. Maya forgets that she has a fitting downstairs. Nicole seems okay to stay and talk to Rick. Maya doesn't want that and says Rick is too busy for that. She invites Nicole to come to the fitting and they can start the tour there. Katie leaves a text for Brooke and confides to Bill that she is worried about her. She tried to stop by and see her and she is worried who she is spending her time with. Bill thinks it is Ridge but Katie says even worse. Bill can not believe Brooke would turn to a convict and a loser and one coupled with Quinn and that will set her over the edge again. Rick tells Maya that he was looking forward to spending a little more time with Nicole and maybe he'd find out a few things he did not know about Maya. Maya suddenly says she can reschedule the fitting it does not have to be today. Even Nicole says she will not tell Rick anything that he doesn't want to know. Maya leaves long enough to leave Rick with Nicole and he fills her in on some of his past history, about his sister, Bridget, and how honesty is so important to him and why his past relationships with Amber and Caroline did not work out. They could not be less alike except that they kept things from him. But with Maya, she tells the truth and holds nothing back. Nicole smiles at that and says it was not always that way. Maya charges in and tells Nicole that is enough, say no more. With Deacon having left, Quinn slips into Brooke's office and she calls Brooke a pathetic lush. She says this is a new low even for Brooke, and who in the hell does she thinks she is?",
