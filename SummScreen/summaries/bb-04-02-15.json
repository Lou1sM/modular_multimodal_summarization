Wyatt sensed that Carter didn't want to work on it. \"Frankly, I don't,\" Carter snipped. In his view, rehiring Quinn was one of Rick's many mistakes.\n\n\nWyatt agreed that Rick had mistakes but said Quinn wasn't one of them. Wyatt said Quinn was grateful to be back, and it was better than her being holed up at the loft alone with Deacon. Wyatt didn't trust Deacon, and it scared Wyatt to think of what would happen if Deacon slipped out of Quinn's orbit.\n\n\nDeacon arrived, looking for Quinn. Wyatt told Deacon to go home. Deacon wanted to take her out to celebrate, but Carter quipped that Deacon should wait for her first paycheck. Wyatt was frustrated because Quinn had a hard road ahead of her and needed support. Deacon said Quinn would rise to the occasion, but Wyatt wondered if Deacon would spend his free time with Brooke.\n\n\nDeacon asserted that it wouldn't happen that way, and he and Quinn were engaged. Wyatt thought Deacon's words sounded ridiculous. Wyatt took no stock in the progress Quinn had made due to Deacon and believed that one mistake would send her careening into oblivion.\n\n\nDeacon claimed to be committed to Quinn. Wyatt said Deacon had better be, because Quinn was wearing Deacon's ring. Wyatt didn't know what it meant to Deacon but knew what it meant to Quinn. Wyatt warned Deacon not to rip Quinn off, \"or I'll rip you a new one.\"\n\n\nDeacon left, and Carter said Wyatt was right to be tough on Deacon. Carter said Wyatt had better keep an eye out because if Deacon strayed, \"all hell would break loose.\"\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Brooke ordered Quinn to stay away from her, but Quinn demanded that Brooke stay away from Deacon. Brooke called it impossible because she and Deacon were parents together. Quinn said Brooke had pushed Quinn to her limits, and Brooke knew what that meant.\n\n\nBrooke was outraged that Quinn would threaten her after Rick had just rehired Quinn. Quinn claimed it wasn't a threat, but Brooke, who knew the signs, suspected that a slap was on its way. \"Oh, no. That was last week's approach. How about strangulation?\" Brooke quipped.\n\n\nQuinn claimed to empathize with Brooke, who was alone for the first time and was hitting the bottle. Quinn was sure it wasn't public knowledge and that Brooke wanted to keep it that way. Quinn stated that Brooke needed support, \"but not from Deacon.\"\n\n\nBrooke claimed that she and Deacon had been friends for years, but Quinn said Brooke had made him miserable. Brooke contended that she'd given him a daughter, but Quinn said it had been a mistake. Quinn asserted that Brooke had treated Deacon like garbage; however, he was good enough for Quinn and would be her husband.\n\n\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it,\" Brooke murmured. Quinn didn't know why Brooke cared. She said Brooke didn't want Deacon, and he didn't want Brooke.\n\n\nJust then, Deacon entered. He asked what was happening. Quinn got a call, requesting her to finalize her paperwork. Before leaving, she said that it was good that Brooke was dealing with her problem, but it was best that Brooke call someone else for help in fighting her demons.\n\n\nQuinn left, and Deacon guessed that the women had gotten into it. He said it was too much to expect Quinn to accept Brooke as his sobriety partner. Brooke refused to let Quinn interfere with Brooke's progress. He didn't want to either, but he also didn't want to set Quinn off. Refusing to live like that, Brooke stated that if Quinn wanted to explode, \"let her explode.\"\n\n\nBrooke didn't know how Deacon could even think of marrying someone like that. Deacon thought it was just a setback for Quinn, and he and Brooke understood those. Brooke exclaimed that it was more than a setback. He offered to talk to Quinn, but Brooke said it wouldn't settle that fact that she was Quinn's problem. Brooke worried about him being alone with Quinn.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Brooke was worried that Quinn would smother him with a pillow. Chuckling, he said Quinn wasn't that person anymore. Brooke replied that no one knew what would make Quinn snap. He reasoned that Brooke did bring out the worst in Quinn. \"So does Hope, Liam, Ridge,\" Brooke added. She asked what Quinn would do next.\n\n\nBrooke claimed to want to understand why Deacon would propose marriage to Quinn. Deacon conveyed that Quinn had been good to him and for him. He'd been drifting after Brooke had left. Brooke asked why he hadn't drifted to someone more beautiful and sane than Quinn.\n\n\nDeacon replied that Brooke was the only beautiful, sane woman he knew. Brooke insisted that Quinn was dangerous, and while others had survived Quinn, Deacon was living in harm's way.\n\n\nWyatt slipped into the doorway in time to hear Deacon say he couldn't stop thinking about what Brooke had said about them. Brooke told him not to think about it, but he couldn't help but think that if he wasn't engaged to Quinn, then he and Brooke could have a shot.\n\n\n\"I knew it!\" Wyatt declared, entering the room. \"I've been right all along.\"\n\n\nAt Quinn's warehouse, Quinn, dressed in her welding uniform, pounded a slender stick of metal.\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick asked Maya not to overreact to Nicole giving Rick perspective. Nicole hinted that everyone had their secrets, but Rick said he and Maya didn't. Nicole asked if he'd told Maya everything about him. Rick chuckled, saying he hadn't told Maya every minute detail.\n\n\nNicole said it was probably the same with Maya, who hadn't told Rick everything. Rick figured that Nicole knew some secrets. \"A few,\" Nicole teased. A good-humored Rick asked to hear them. Maya told Rick that it wasn't fun for her, but he claimed that they were just teasing.\n\n\nNicole said she'd thought of something she'd learned about Maya that had been disturbing. Maya grew defensive. Nicole revealed that Maya had made a promise to the young Nicole that Maya hadn't kept. Maya had promised to be in Nicole's life and share everything with Nicole. Nicole had waited for it to happen, but it never had. Nicole claimed it was okay because they were together \"now.\"\n\n\nNicole said they could share the big \"change\" in Maya's life. \"Are you ready to share it now, Maya?\" Nicole asked.\n\n\nRick got a call and left. Maya asked what Nicole was trying to pull. Nicole remarked that she'd never said she wouldn't ever tell Rick. Maya assumed Nicole would hold it over Maya's head. Nicole said there was nothing to be ashamed of. Maya claimed not to be ashamed, and in her view, choosing not to disclose her transition didn't mean she was lying to Rick or anyone else.\n\n\nNicole asked if Rick had the right to know. Maya said that if he proposed, she'd tell him, and she obviously couldn't biologically give him a child. Nicole claimed that she'd meant what she'd said earlier about the past. Maya asserted that she'd been going through a challenging time, but Nicole noted that it had been a hard time for her, too.\n\n\nNicole said Maya had known that Nicole couldn't relate to their parents, and back then, Maya had been all that Nicole had had. Maya asked what kind of support Nicole wanted. Nicole said that if Maya had to ask, then Maya wasn't being a sister; she was being selfish.\n\n\nNicole said Maya owned \"the place\" and was the matriarch; if Maya made a demand, it happened. Nicole reasoned that Maya could make things happen for Nicole. To Maya, it sounded like blackmail. Nicole said they were sisters. \"You support me; I support you,\" Nicole replied and left.\n\n\nCarter entered while Maya was deep in thought. Carter had seen Nicole in the hallway and guessed that Maya and Nicole had argued about Nicole lying about school. Maya revealed that she didn't trust Nicole. Carter reasoned that the little sister might have wanted to impress Maya after discovering Maya's new lifestyle. Maya replied that it was much more than that.\n\n\nCarter thought it was sibling rivalry from a failed little sister. Maya screamed that she'd said it was more than that. She quickly apologized. Carter grew serious and reminded Maya that she could talk to him. He asked what was going on. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Maya goes on the defensive when Nicole hints to Rick that her sister is not being totally forthright about herself. Wyatt continues to face opposition from his coworkers regarding Quinn being rehired at Forrester Creations. Brooke fears for her life as Quinn claims to be pushed to her limit and angrily makes a threat to stay away from Deacon. Not wanting to jeopardize his relationship with Quinn, Deacon tells Brooke that he can no longer be her support system.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Quinn to stay away from her. Quinn says she has pushed her to her limit and it is she that needs to stay away from Deacon. She knows what can happen. Brooke scoffs yes a slap in the face. Quinn says no that was last week. Brooke wonders if maybe strangulation is more her speed this week. Quinn tells her that she knows where Brooke is coming from. Wyatt wants to talk to Carter about his mom's contract. Carter says he turned it over to someone else as he thinks it is wrong. Carter says Quinn is good so he is right about that part, but he's heard the stories about her. Deacon shows up and asks if they know where Quinn is. He would like to take her out to celebrate. Wyatt tells him to go home. No one around here is going to throw her a welcome home party. He admits that his mother is doing better but one little mistake by Deacon could send her over the edge. He'd like to know that he and Brooke are continents away from each other. He better be committed to his mother and he knows what that means. So Deacon better not rip her off or he will rip him a new one. Maya jumps on Nicole for starting to tell Rick something private about her. Rick says he thinks Maya is perfect and they don't keep secrets so Nicole is free to say what she wants. Nicole is evasive but says she knows Maya has not told him everything. She did not keep her secret to Nicole. She was little when Maya left but when she came back to visit she promised they would stay in touch and then she didn't. But that is okay as they are now. Quinn tells Brooke that Deacon does not want her so she should bow out. Deacon comes in and asks what is going on. Quinn says she is just about ready to go sign her contract and she just stopped by to say hello to Brooke. She leaves and tells Deacon that she will see him at home. Carter tells Wyatt that he was pretty rough on Deacon and he is the key to Quinn bring happy or not. He better keep his eye on him. Brooke tells Deacon that she is not going to enable Quinn's insanity and she can not believe he is considering marrying someone like that. Rick has to go attend to business and Maya jumps Nicole again about saying nothing about the transgender woman. She says if Rick proposes and wants children obviously she will have to tell him. She tells Nicole that she is asking for help, sounding an awful lot like blackmail. Nicole says call it what she will. It is that simple. If Maya helps her, she will help Maya keep her secret. Quinn is in the workshop making and sharpening a brand new knife/dagger. Carter catches Maya in deep thought about being Myron. He tells her that he just saw Nicole and she seems pretty intense and worried about lying about being enrolled at UCLA. Maya says she does not trust Nicole and does not want to talk about her. Carter says it is classic sister rivalry and she should ease up. Maya lashes out that it is more than that. Carter says she can tell him anything. Brooke tells Deacon that there may be reasons for her to want to go back to the bottle but Quinn will not be that reason. She is only worrying about him with that woman and what could make her snap again. Deacon keeps saying that Quinn is good to him and for him. She thinks he can find someone else besides that lunatic. She feels he is living in harm's way. On the other side of the partly open door Wyatt overhears their conversation with Deacon saying how good he and Brooke could be good together too. Wyatt comes in and says aha, he knew it. This has been going on all along.",
