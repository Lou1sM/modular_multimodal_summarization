    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Eric's office, the staff continued to bicker about who would lead Forrester. Eric declared that everyone would work together without acrimony. He said that before him was a business decision about whether to absorb HFTF into couture and strengthen the brand identification or to leave HFTF as it was.\n\n\nRidge insisted that HFTF had caused Forrester to lose its identity. He implored Eric to agree, and Rick asked if Eric really did agree with it. Eric concluded that he didn't agree with it, and he didn't agree with closing the photo studio in favor of the one in Paris. Eric decided that Oliver wouldn't go anywhere.\n\n\nHope asked who'd be president, and Eric decreed that Rick would continue with his job. Eric stated that Ridge had vacated his position, and Ridge needed to work his way back up again. Ridge didn't know what he'd work his way up from because he didn't have a position anymore.\n\n\n\"You do now. I'm making you co-vice president -- with Brooke,\" Eric replied. Ridge looked at Brooke, and she rendered a surprised but satisfied grin. Hope, Caroline, and Carter left the room, and the brooding Ridge quipped that he should get Thorne's old job as head of shipping, since Thorne was in Paris.  Eric told Ridge not to behave that way because it wasn't a demotion.\n\n\nLoosening his tie, Ridge asked what he should call Eric's shortsighted decision in the face of potential problems for the company. Rick said they didn't need Ridge to ride in on his white horse to save them from themselves, and Brooke remarked that Rick's leadership had made the company more successful. Ridge assumed that she was insinuating that it was more successful than when he'd run it.\n\n\nBrooke said that Rick's team had done something that Forrester hadn't done for a very long time. Ridge asserted that he knew they needed to reach out to the next generation, but HFTF had taken on a life of its own. Angry, Rick said Ridge's problem was that HFTF had succeeded more in Rick's tenure than in Ridge's, and Ridge wanted to tear down their progress.\n\n\nRidge asked for Brooke's opinion. Brooke said that Eric thought the best thing was for Rick to be president, and as co-vice president, she'd support Rick. Rick decided that the company would stay its course, and Ridge questioned Rick's unwillingness to do what was right in front of him. Brooke replied that not only was the statement an insult to Rick, but it insulted her and Eric, as well.\n\n\nRick felt that insults were in line with Ridge's treatment of Brooke. Ridge stated that Rick wasn't a designer, and he didn't have Ridge's experience. Ridge predicted that, even though Rick had a good team, it couldn't cover his inadequacies forever, and one day, \"Daddy\" wouldn't be able to defend Rick.\n\n\nBrooke retorted that \"Daddy\" didn't have to defend Rick. In her view, Rick wasn't a designer, but he was a good person who ran the company well and who didn't run when things got tough. Brooke said it told what kind of man Rick was, and it was more important than the ability to sketch a gown.\n\n\nRidge shuffled Brooke to the side and said he still didn't think Rick should be president, but if \"Mommy and Daddy's\" decision made Rick feel secure, then Rick should enjoy it while it lasted.\n\n\nIn the corridor later, Caroline and Carter discussed the surprising turn of events at the meeting. They noted the startled reactions Brooke and Ridge had given to Eric's decision. Caroline felt redeemed because Eric hadn't allowed Ridge to throw out her husband, but she wished Ridge had tried to work with Rick. She said that even Carter had to agree that firing Oliver had been too much.\n\n\nRearing to back up Rick if needed, Caroline tried to eavesdrop with a cup to the door of the CEO's office to hear what was happening. Carter asked if she'd pummel Ridge with her pearls. She said she wouldn't, but she'd lend them to Oliver for the job. Carter tried to dissuade her from listening in on the private conversation, and she wondered how much he'd known about Ridge's plans.\n\n\nAt the door, Caroline thought she'd overheard Ridge still pushing for the Paris photo studio, and Carter wondered if Eric would reverse his reversal of Ridge's decision. Caroline doubted that would happen after Hope had already gone to tell Oliver that he still had a job.\n\n\nLater, Rick and Eric entered Rick's office and wondered whether they should have left Brooke and Ridge alone together. Eric was proud of Rick's leadership, and Rick was grateful for his father's faith in him. They hugged, and Rick noted that Brooke had been about to punch Ridge in the nose as she'd defended Rick. Chuckling, Eric said Brooke would make a great vice president.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Brooke flashed back to the day she'd seen rose petals in her fountain and Ridge at the top of her steps. She remembered trying to get forgiveness for being with Bill and the last wedding to Ridge that had never happened.\n\n\nRidge asked if Brooke was proud of herself or had enjoyed seeing him humiliated earlier. Brooke stated that he'd overstepped, and management had pushed back. He cited that she'd led the charge to somehow get Eric to throw his support behind Rick. Brooke stated that Eric had asked why she'd been so hostile toward Ridge, and so she'd explained it.\n\n\nAssuming that Brooke had told Eric about Katie, Ridge stated that it had been his story to tell. \"But you didn't tell it, did you?\" Brooke asked and concluded that Ridge hadn't because he'd known that Eric wouldn't approve. Ridge said he knew that Brooke was hurting. She shot back that he was \"damn right,\" and she was hurting for their son, who Ridge had let down to be with her little sister.\n\n\nBrooke warned Ridge to watch out, because he'd soon see why Katie had only been with one man. At that point, he'd realize that reading poetry wasn't enough. Ridge guessed Brooke thought that would be when he'd want to return to her. In that moment, Brooke realized that she didn't even want him to do that, not after the way he'd attacked Hope and Rick earlier.\n\n\nAll Brooke wanted at that point was for her children to be protected and to have a place at the company. She asserted that Rick had rebuilt the business after Ridge had left, and while Rick had unified everyone, Ridge was a divisive force.  \"You don't deserve to be the president of this company. And you won't be...not as long as I'm here,\" she declared.\n\n\nIn the studio, Oliver packed his things. Aly looked at an award with his name on it. About the award, he said it was ironic to him that, just a few weeks earlier, Spencer had dubbed him the young photographer to watch, but Forrester had canned him. Oliver was confident that he'd find another job. She replied that Ridge shouldn't have fired Oliver; she never would have done that.\n\n\nAly didn't think Oliver should give up. She said it wasn't over, and they shouldn't pack up the studio because Eric could decide something else. Oliver declared that Ridge was a Forrester, and if a Forrester wanted Oliver gone, then Oliver was history.\n\n\nOliver stared at his badge and recalled the way Ridge had fired him. Oliver asked Aly to turn the badge in for him, but she refused to allow Oliver to be fired. She headed for the door, but he said he didn't want her to plead for his job. Aly didn't plan on pleading; she intended to tell her uncle how boneheaded he'd been to let Oliver go.\n\n\n\"I agree,\" Hope said as she entered the studio. Aly told Hope that someone needed to talk sense into \"that man.\" Hope assured Aly that someone already had, and Eric had reversed Ridge's decision. \"You are no longer fired. Welcome back!\" Hope exclaimed.\n\n\n \nOliver was stunned by the news. Aly thought he deserved an apology and a raise, but he replied that he didn't want to capitalize on the issue. He thought it was enough that people had stood up for him, and he said he couldn't thank Hope and Aly enough. Oliver said that if Ridge took over again, Oliver's butt would be back on the line. Hope figured that fear applied to everyone, but Oliver didn't have to worry because the team had Oliver's back.\n\n\nHope left, but Oliver was still worried that the company could decide Ridge's way at any point in the future. Aly was certain that Brooke wouldn't let Oliver go anywhere -- unless he wanted to. Oliver didn't want to. He loved the place, and to him, the Forresters were an amazing family.\n\n\nOliver assured Aly that he couldn't let himself be blindsided again, and Aly vowed not to let it happen to him again. She offered to let him know the moment she heard anything about his position. Oliver thanked her and called her an amazing person. Aly grinned in response. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge, Rick, Brooke, Hope, Caroline and Carter await Eric\u2019s decision about Rick and Ridge. Eric makes a surprise decision and creates a new team to work together, namely Brooke and Ridge. Ridge is unrelenting in his opinion that HFTF is costing Forrester Creations more than money which causes Brooke to go off on him. Ridge backs down, but threatens Rick one more time that he won\u2019t be president for long. Later, Ridge confides in Brooke that he is upset that she told Eric about he and Katie. Brooke makes a startling declaration to Ridge about his future, both personally and professionally.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric makes Ridge co-VP with Brooke. Rick will remain as President and Oliver will keep his job. Aly tries to get Oliver to put his stuff back as Eric may completely change all of this around. He says no one keeps a job all their life so he will get another. Just as Aly is about to charge upstairs and plead his case, Hope walks in and says somebody else already has. Eric reversed his decision so Oliver stays. He thanks them for their support. Ridge doesn't like these new circumstances and he and Rick continue to bicker. Rick accuses Ridge of retaliation just because the HFTF line flourished and put FC back on the map while he was gone and it happened under Rick's leadership. Brooke assures Ridge she will work with him but she will always support her son so he better understand that. She tells Ridge that Rick is not a designer but he's a good company leader and he doesn't run away when things get tough. Ridge tells Rick that he still doesn't think he should be president but if that will make his dad and Brooke happy, so be it .enjoy it while it lasts. Aly asks Oliver how it feels with so many people in his corner. He loves this place. Forrester is an amazing family. But he does not want to be blindsided again like this. He says she is a real sweetheart. Eric tells Rick that he makes him proud. Rick says no son could ask for more. Brooke tells Ridge she lost her way without him. That is no excuse but she has her priorities back in order. She will see to it that he is never President while she is there. He will not push Rick and Hope out of this company. She did not like seeing him humiliated but he pushed and management pushed back.",
