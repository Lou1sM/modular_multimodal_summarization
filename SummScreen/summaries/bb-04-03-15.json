Caroline had gotten her divorce papers, and Karen had called Katie to see if Rick was okay. \"Karen doesn't hate me?\" Rick asked. Katie said Karen just wanted the best for the former couple, and it was better that they'd parted before having kids.\n\n\nRick asked for Karen's opinion of how Caroline was dealing with it. Katie remarked that being with Karen and Dani was good for Caroline. Katie was glad to see he was taking care of himself. She asked if he was okay working with Caroline.\n\n\nRick believed that Caroline was talented, and working together wouldn't be awkward forever. He didn't want to be enemies with Caroline. He reasoned that he and Caroline had been friends before they'd gotten together, and in many ways, they could still make a great team.\n\n\nKatie asked if being a team was really possible. Rick said marriages failed all the time around Forrester, but he and Caroline might be better suited as a business team. Rick decided to look beyond Caroline being with Ridge. \"Because, let's be realistic, how long is that gonna last?\" Rick asked. He joked that eventually, every smart woman left Ridge.\n\n\nKatie said that moving on seemed to be getting easier for Rick. Rick recalled that there had been a lot of pain. Caroline had kept secrets, even though she'd known he couldn't tolerate that.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Brooke and Deacon tried to tell Wyatt that he'd misunderstood them, but Wyatt repeated exactly what Deacon had said about having another chance with Brooke. Deacon and Brooke tried to make it seem as if they'd been talking about the past, but Wyatt didn't buy it.\n\n\nWyatt had heard Deacon say that he could be with Brooke if he wasn't engaged to Quinn. Deacon claimed that he wouldn't have proposed to Quinn if any part of him had wanted to be with someone else. Wyatt accused Deacon of always having a thing for Brooke, and Wyatt said the mere fact that Brooke and Deacon were taking about it meant he and Quinn shouldn't be engaged.\n\n\nWyatt left, and Deacon wondered if Wyatt would go to Quinn. Brooke figured it was exactly where Wyatt was headed. Deacon started to take off, but Brooke asked if he was sure.\n\n\nDeacon said he'd always care about the unobtainable Brooke, but he couldn't chase her anymore. Something about him and Quinn worked. Brooke believed he was making a big mistake. She hoped he realized that one day, but she hoped it wasn't the day Quinn went at him with a sword.\n\n\nAt Quinn's warehouse, sparks flew as Quinn worked. When she took off her goggles, she polished her newly made dagger. Wyatt arrived and guessed that the dagger was a letter opener. Quinn said she'd seen a cheap one on Rick's desk, so she'd made him a new one as an appreciation gift.\n\n\nQuinn noticed that Wyatt looked disturbed. Wyatt conveyed that he'd overheard something while he'd happened by Rick's old office. Wyatt stammered as he explained that he'd heard Deacon and Brooke talking, and Quinn needed to hear it from Wyatt before too much time elapsed.\n\n\nWyatt conveyed that Brooke had said there could be a chance for her and Deacon if Deacon wasn't engaged to Quinn. Wyatt revealed that Deacon was going nuts thinking about it. \"Oh, I see,\" Quinn uttered as she squeezed the letter opener. Her hand began to bleed.\n\n\n\"Oh, my God, your hand!\" Wyatt exclaimed. Quinn pretended that it was just a hazard of the job and wrapped her hand with a cloth. Wyatt said that Brooke and Deacon had denied that anything was happening with them. Quinn remarked that the two had been spending a lot of time together, and Brooke was such a delicate, little flower. Quinn decided that she had to explain things to Brooke.\n\n\nWyatt asserted that he hadn't told his mother for her to talk to Brooke. He said she didn't need to say a word to Brooke. Instead, Quinn needed to give Deacon back his ring back and tell him to figure out what he wanted. \"I appreciate you telling me,\" Quinn replied, cleaning the letter opener.\n\n\nLater, Quinn sneaked into Forrester and found Brooke still working in Rick's old office. Brooke was startled when Quinn appeared in the room. Quinn said she'd told Brooke to stay away from Deacon. Brooke replied that she didn't know what Wyatt had said. Quinn stated that Brooke should have listened. Brooke gasped as Quinn stabbed her with the letter opener.\n\n\nIn the studio, Nicole arrived as Oliver was setting up a group of models to audition. She implored him to let her join the group. Oliver advised her to get permission from Maya or Rick.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Carter tried to get Maya to open up to him. He said that, even though they hadn't worked out, he still wanted her to be happy, and he wouldn't judge whatever she had to say.\n\n\nNicole entered. Maya said it was a bad time. Nicole didn't mind talking in front of Carter and asked if Maya did. Carter reminded Maya that he was there for her, and he left.\n\n\nBack in the studio, Carter arrived at the time Oliver called for a break in his photo session. The men discussed the models, and Oliver remarked that he'd had the weirdest interaction with Nicole. Carter was surprised to hear that Nicole wanted to be a model. Oliver wondered why a full-time student would want to add modeling to her schedule.\n\n\nCarter asked Oliver to keep a secret and revealed that Nicole had lied about being in school. Oliver remarked that it explained why she was at Forrester and the mansion all the time. Oliver asked if Carter knew that Nicole had taken Aly's room. \"Even though Maya doesn't want her around,\" Carter stated. Oliver said that something was going on with the sisters.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Maya told Nicole that she had to stop making Maya feel as if Nicole would tell anyone at any time. Nicole said she could stop it, and Maya could do something for Nicole.\n\n\nNicole wanted to be one of the models Oliver was screening. Maya claimed she had no control over it, but Nicole stated that Maya was the first lady of Forrester and could get Nicole in. Maya said she couldn't snap her fingers and make Nicole a model. Nicole reasoned that Maya could get the audition, and Nicole would do the work from there.\n\n\nMaya asked about Nicole's desire to work with computers. \"Are you saying no to me? Because I don't think you want to do that,\" Nicole quipped. Maya claimed to want the best for her sister, which meant questioning a decision to walk away from computer programming and into modeling -- a very tough industry. Nicole asked why Maya would make it tougher when all she had to do was have Rick send out a memo to get it done.\n\n\nMaya told Nicole that she couldn't expect to waltz in and have a career unfold for her. Nicole figured that if Maya could do it, Nicole could do it. Maya glared at Nicole, who ordered Maya to be the big sister she should have been years earlier.\n\n\nMaya didn't understand why Nicole was fixated on modeling and wouldn't let Maya help her in other ways. Nicole asked why Maya couldn't help in the way Nicole wanted. Nicole wanted to be a part of Maya's lifestyle and noted that the homeless Maya had started in a coffee shop and had become a famous model, living in the Forrester mansion.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Carter opened the door to the CEO's office. He heard arguing and listened in. Maya asserted that if Nicole wanted to be in Maya's life, threatening wasn't the way to get there. Maya claimed to know how it worked, and she said if she gave Nicole what she wanted, it would be something else the next day. Maya decided that Nicole was cut off and done.\n\n\nMaya demanded that Nicole respect Maya and Maya's privacy. Maya said Nicole would do it because Maya was her sister, not because Nicole was getting something out of it. \"But you're not,\" Nicole quipped. Nicole started to say something about Rick, but Maya cut in, saying she'd tell him eventually. Nicole doubted that Maya would do it because she was too ashamed.\n\n\nMaya said she wasn't ashamed of who she was, but Nicole retorted that Maya was ashamed of who she'd been -- \"Myron, my brother.\" Carter looked shocked as Nicole asked Maya why she didn't just tell everyone that she'd been born a man. Maya yelled that it was her private business.\n\n\nCarter slipped away from the door when he saw Nicole headed for it. Nicole stormed out of the room, and Carter pushed the office door back open. Maya looked at him, and her expression darkened as he stared back at her. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt walks on into the room and says he knew it. He just heard Deacon say that he and Brooke had another shot if he was not engaged to his mother. Does that sound like a guy who wants to get married? Oliver gives the potential models a pep talk and then Nicole joins in and wants to submit herself for the job. Oliver tells her that he is pretty swamped today so she will have to run this past Maya or even Rick. Carter is worried. He knows something is bothering Maya and assures her that she can tell him. Deacon tells Wyatt that he has nothing to worry about. He is in love with his mother. Brooke speaks up and says yes at one time Deacon thought he had a chance with Brooke but then she went to Milan and Deacon fell for Quinn so that was the end of it. Katie tracks Rick down while he is working out. She scoffs that he is newly divorced so he should be going out and getting fat. Nicole interrupts Carter and Maya with Carter saying they are in the middle of something. Nicole smirks that she doesn't mind talking in front of Carter if Maya doesn't. Wyatt tells Deacon that the fact they are even talking about it means he should not be marrying his mother. He has never gotten over Brooke and he just admitted it to her. Deacon says he would not have even proposed if he still had feelings for Brooke. With Carter gone, Maya tells Nicole that she does not appreciate this, Nicole thinking she can come talk to her any time when she is busy. Nicole proceeds that Maya can do her a sisterly favor by making sure she can get on that runway today as a model .again helping each other. Quinn sharpens her dagger just as Wyatt walks in. She calls it a letter opener for Rick to replace the plastic one on his desk. Wyatt says it looks more like a .then he ends up telling Quinn that he walked by Rick's office and saw Brooke and Deacon. Brooke had said that there could be a chance for them if he were not engaged to Quinn. He heard Deacon say this bothered him. Quinn thinks about it and accidentally cuts her hand when squeezing it too tightly. Wyatt says they denied it but the first thing she needs to do is not talk to Brooke but give Deacon's ring back and give him what he wants. Deacon goes back to Brooke and says as unlikely as it seems he is going to remain with Quinn, and Brooke will always be the unobtainable Brooke Logan. Maya tells Nicole that she can not snap her fingers and make her a model. Nicole says Maya surely is not saying no as she would not want to do that. Oliver tells Carter that something is going on between Nicole and Maya that he doesn't like. Aly even had to give up her room at Eric's because of Maya giving it to Nicole and yet they can't stand to be in the same room together. Carter confides in Oliver that Nicole does not go to UCLA after all so that is why she is hanging around Forrester now. Katie tells Rick that it seems to be getting easier for him to move on. He admits that Caroline lied to him and kept secrets the one thing that he can not tolerate, but she can't stay with Ridge forever and he is sure in time they can still work together at FC. Nicole tells Maya that she was gone for years and now she wants to be a big sister so start acting like it. She wants a part of this life so give her a chance. They are bantering back and forth when Carter is outside the door and about to walk in and hears the harping. Maya ends by saying she will tell Rick eventually. Nicole says she needs to tell Rick right now that she is Myron, her brother, not Maya. Carter walks in with shock written all over his face. Brooke is working alone in her office and turns around suddenly to find Quinn lunging at her.",
