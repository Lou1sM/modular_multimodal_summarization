Eric showed them his phone pictures of Steffy and Liam's wedding reception. Maya noted how happy Eric looked in a photo with Quinn and said he'd looked that way since the day he'd gotten married.\n\n\nRick admitted that he'd told his wife that he'd been wrong about Quinn. Rick said that Eric believed in people when others didn't, and Quinn was a lucky lady. Eric replied that he was the lucky one. Maya knew what it felt like to be an outcast, but Eric had always made her feel welcome. She said he'd done the same with Quinn when others had feared Quinn would let him down. Eric stated that Quinn wouldn't let him down.\n\n\nEric was continuously amazed that he'd found a woman that he could love and trust the way he did at that stage of his life. Maya and Rick hoped it was the same for Brooke and Ridge, who should be married by then. Eric notified Rick and Maya that the wedding hadn't happened.\n\n\nDismayed, Rick recalled that Eric had said something about a problem when the men had talked by phone. Eric relayed that an upset Brooke had gone to him at the hotel, but Ridge had taken her away before she'd been able to say anything. Rick divulged that the couple hadn't returned together. Eric replied that Brooke might be back in town by then.\n\n\nRick believed that Ridge had done something, but Eric asked his son not to jump to conclusions. Maya asked if R.J. knew. Eric didn't know but advised against mentioning it to R.J. Taking out his phone, Eric decided that he was ready to get to the bottom of things.\n\n\nLater, Eric had gone, but Rick was still puzzled by what had gone on in Australia. Maya reminded him that Eric had warned against jumping to conclusions. \"No, no. They need to get their act together,\" Rick declared.\n\n\nRick expressed that Ridge and Brooke needed to take a page out of Quinn and Eric's marital playbook and remarked upon how everyone had once hated Quinn. Maya believed everyone had accepted Quinn except Katie. Rick and Maya noted how quickly Eric and Quinn had gotten together, and Rick decided that Eric and Quinn needed to give Ridge and Brooke a lesson about trust and honesty. \"Without all the drama,\" Maya added.\n\n\nIn the design office, Brooke arrived with Katie, who disclosed that it hadn't taken much for Ridge to reveal why he and Brooke hadn't gotten married. Brooke replied that Katie had been right, and Brooke had found him kissing his father's wife. Katie was sure Brooke was back to tell Eric.\n\n\nBrooke told Katie about the promise she'd made to keep quiet as long as Ridge and Quinn stayed away from each other. Katie responded that Brooke couldn't be serious, and Eric deserved to know. Brooke said she was thinking of Eric and the family, and she added that Katie knew what it would do to Eric. Katie felt that it was better for Eric to know sooner rather than later and announced that, if Brooke wouldn't tell him, Katie would.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that it wasn't Katie's place to tell Eric. Katie refused to let Quinn make a fool out of her dear friend. Brooke replied that it would destroy Eric, and the thing between Quinn and Ridge wouldn't continue. Katie asked why she and Brooke should believe any promises Quinn and Ridge had made.\n\n\nBrooke declared that she'd made her decision, and Katie would respect it. Katie questioned why Brooke would protect Ridge and Quinn. Brooke raged that she wasn't protecting them; she wanted to strangle them, but she needed to protect Eric, who'd had a serious medical condition. Katie contended that Eric had recovered and was capable of handling the truth.\n\n\nKatie posited that Eric would be upset with her and Brooke for keeping it from him, and Katie exclaimed that he was married to a psychopath. Brooke asked what Katie would call Ridge. Katie concluded that Ridge was stupid, which he had been for most of his life, and he had no self-control with women. Brooke replied that Quinn and Ridge knew Brooke was watching, and Brooke, not Katie, would go to Eric if anything else happened.\n\n\nKatie stated that Quinn and Ridge worked together,\tand if they couldn't keep their hands off of each other the day before Ridge's wedding, Katie didn't know what made Brooke think they could behind closed doors. The decision wasn't like Brooke, in Katie's view. Katie said Brooke was being played for a fool, and there was only one reason Brooke would allow it. \"You're going to forgive him,\" Katie concluded.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that no one was forgiving anyone. Katie asked if Brooke was sure. Brooke told her sister to just stop because it was a lot for Brooke to handle at the moment. Katie said that Brooke was right and apologized. Brooke conveyed that Ridge had said it had been nothing, but what she'd seen hadn't been a simple kiss on the cheek.\n\n\nKatie stated that it had been going on for a while. Brooke said Ridge had tried to explain it. Katie added that he'd tried to explain it to her, too. Brooke asked how he could do it -- and with his father's wife. Katie claimed that she'd never trusted Quinn. Brooke replied that Eric did. The thought of Eric's trust in Quinn scared Katie.\n\n\nBrooke received a text message that Eric wanted to talk and find out what had happened. Katie urged Brooke to tell him, but Brooke refused. Insisting that she had everything under control, Brooke advised Katie to leave it alone. Katie believed that her friend deserved the truth, and she didn't know how to face Eric while knowing what she knew. Brooke admonished Katie not to say one word.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge and Quinn discussed that he hadn't heard from Brooke. Quinn blamed herself, but Ridge said he shouldn't have kissed her. She wondered if they could really trust Brooke not to tell Eric and said they had to make sure Brooke didn't tell anyone. Ridge revealed that he'd told Katie the previous day about the kiss.\n\n\nQuinn grew upset, but Ridge contended that he'd had to tell Katie because she'd jumped to a worse conclusion. Quinn said Katie had been on a witch hunt, but \"now\" she had proof. Ridge relayed that Katie had talked to Brooke about it, and Quinn asked what Katie had said. He replied that it didn't matter because Brooke had agreed to remain silent about it.\n\n\nQuinn reasoned that it didn't mean Katie would. Quinn stated that Katie hated Quinn, and Quinn was sure that Katie would go straight to Eric with it. Ridge and Quinn received messages from Eric that he wanted to meet and talk about the wedding that had never happened. Quinn was alarmed by Eric including her in it. Ridge assumed Eric wanted his wife's perspective.\n\n\nBrooke arrived, and Ridge tried to talk to her before Eric got there. Brooke said not to bother, but he insisted that it wasn't worth throwing away what they had. Quinn said it had been a silly infatuation. Brooke quipped that she could only imagine what Quinn would do if Quinn's fianc\u00e9 had had a silly infatuation. Quinn asserted that Ridge loved Brooke, not Quinn.\n\n\nEric entered. He took Quinn's hand and said Brooke and Ridge knew what Eric, the head of the family, was concerned about. Ridge replied that there was nothing to be concerned about. Eric assumed Ridge's response meant that the couple had made up and would get married. Brooke replied that it wasn't so, and Eric asked to know what was going on.\n\n\nEric noted that Ridge and Brooke had been acting like newlyweds already while on the trip. Turning to Quinn, Eric asked if she'd been aware of anything. Quinn stammered, and Eric began questioning her about Ridge mentioning having second thoughts. Ridge asserted that he was right there in the room and could hear Eric. Ridge contended that it wasn't a family matter, and it was just between Brooke and him.\n\n\nEric begged to differ because it would affect R.J., and Eric was in disbelief that the couple would give up so easily. Ridge replied that it wasn't easy. Eric said Ridge was the one who always advised talking it out and had asked to do so when Eric had started seeing Quinn. Ridge recalled that Eric had said to stay out of it. Eric replied that he'd heard Ridge out then Eric had expressed how much it meant to have the love that he had with Quinn.\n\n\nEric believed that Brooke and Ridge should have the same kind of thing between them. Eric noted that they didn't. He wanted to help them and added that Quinn did, too. Brooke became visibly upset, and Eric implored her to open up to him. He noted that she was just as upset as she'd been in his hotel room. He was sure she'd been the one to call off the wedding, and he wanted to know why. Eric decided that no one was leaving the room until he knew why Brooke wouldn't marry his son.\n\n\n",

Katie is taken aback that Brooke intends to keep the ugly truth from Eric as long as Ridge and Quinn keep it civil between them from now on.
