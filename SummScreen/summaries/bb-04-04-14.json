Aly said Ridge had to go through her before firing Oliver again.\n\n\nMaya took off to meet Carter, and Oliver invited Aly to get some coffee with him. She stammered that she couldn't because she had a goldfish to feed on schedule. Oliver said having coffee wouldn't take all night. Smiling, Aly agreed to go with him.\n\n\nAt the Bikini Bar later, Maya had drinks with Carter and warned him to be careful about befriending Ridge. She said that Rick was the president, and he didn't like Ridge. Chuckling, Carter replied that he had it covered. Carter felt bad for Ridge because the company meant a lot to Ridge, and Eric had shut him down. Carter predicted that Ridge would be running the company eventually.\n\n\nCarter noticed Oliver arrive with Aly and asked Maya if they were dating. Maya quizzically watched the pair and said they were just friends as far as Maya knew. Carter said she was staring, but she claimed that she was just intrigued because Aly was a little young for Oliver. Carter guessed that meant the pair was dating. \"No!\" Maya exclaimed. \"I don't know,\" she concluded, pursing her lips.\n\n\nAt Oliver and Aly's table, Aly confessed that she didn't like coffee. Oliver replied that it didn't matter what she drank; he just appreciated her company. He placed his hand over hers, and as she smiled, he thanked her for sticking up for him. Aly called Ridge a bully and said that Oliver wouldn't believe the stories she had about how Ridge had treated her father and others.\n\n\nOliver had observed that Ridge could be harsh with many people, like Rick and Hope. Aly bit out that Ridge needed to respect Hope's line more. Oliver had garnered that Aly really valued HFTF's message. Aly was surprised when he said that he did, too, and Hope's message needed to be heard.\n\n\nOliver went to the bar to get their drinks. When he brought back a hot tea for Aly, he accidentally spilled it on her hand.  Maya watched from her table as Oliver pressed his lips to Aly's hand and asked if it felt better. Aly's eyes fluttered, and she became flushed with feelings.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Ridge handed Rick some sketches and said there would be more on the way. Ridge also acknowledged that he had a meeting on his calendar with Caroline. As Ridge started to leave, Rick asked if Ridge had anything else to say. Ridge seemed to not know what Rick was talking about, and Rick asked if he'd get an apology for Ridge throwing a fit and trying to take Rick's job.\n\n\nJust then, Katie arrived to see how the meeting had gone. Grinning, Rick said the meeting had gone well, and Ridge finally understood his boundaries. Ridge stroked Katie's arm, and grimacing at them, Rick hastily decided to go.\n\n\nRick left, and Ridge bitterly said that Daddy had given Rick his way -- as always. Ridge explained that Brooke had Eric wrapped around her finger and had taken Eric aside to convince him of her view. Ridge revealed that Eric had announced that he and Brooke would be co-vice presidents.\n\n\nKatie scoffed, noting that Ridge, who'd been the CEO and president in the past, had been relegated to share a desk with Brooke like Pam and Donna did. Katie called it Brooke's dream scenario, but Ridge said it wouldn't last for long. He intended to talk to his father again because he'd put in too many years to just give the company to Rick.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Brooke thanked Eric for allowing Rick to continue with the presidency. Eric had hated to disappoint Ridge, who'd accomplished a great deal at Forrester; however, Rick had been doing well in his position, and Eric hadn't wanted to just take it from Rick. Eric predicted that Ridge would accept it once he figured out that he was better off working closely with Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke wondered what Eric was planning. To her, working closely together meant spending late hours with Ridge, and she asked if Eric was trying to play matchmaker. Eric guessed that Brooke wanted him to mind his own business, but he conveyed that he'd made the decisions he'd made precisely because he was minding his own business.\n\n\nEric declared that Ridge and Brooke were the future of the company. Brooke corrected him, saying that Rick and Caroline were. Eric said that Rick and Caroline would eventually lead the company, but in the meantime, they needed to ask themselves who they wanted to be in the media as the face and leaders of the company. In the past, Eric and Stephanie had been the couple at the helm, but because Stephanie was gone, Eric felt that Ridge and Brooke should be at the forefront.\n\n\nBrooke said not everything that should happen did happen. She intended to work side by side with Ridge and make Eric proud, but she didn't think Eric should hold his breath for more. She was glad to know that she didn't need Ridge in order to be happy, and she could grow as a person without a man.\n\n\nLater, Eric was working alone when Ridge strode in and told Eric to take it back. Eric took off his glasses and asked what he should take back. Ridge told his father to draft a memo or do whatever he needed to do, but Rick couldn't be president. \"It has to be me,\" Ridge declared.\n\n\nRidge asked why his father had chosen his brother. Eric said it had been Rick's experience. Ridge scoffed, guessing Eric did whatever Brooke wanted. Smiling, Eric assured Ridge that it had been Eric's decision. Ridge declared that it was his legacy. \"You left,\" Eric replied.\n\n\nRidge growled in frustration. He said he'd been training to take over from Eric from the moment he'd picked up a pencil. Eric readily agreed and said it was exactly the point. To Eric, Ridge was the best designer in the world, but Rick was the president. Ridge called it ridiculous. Eric yelled that Ridge had been gone a year, and he couldn't expect to return and have things as they'd been.\n\n\n\"Especially now -- with your personal life the way it is,\" Eric grumbled. Eric wondered what would happen when people learned that Ridge Forrester was shacking up with Bill Spencer's wife. Eric asserted that Ridge didn't want to get in the middle of \"that.\" Ridge believed he was already in the middle of it, and he was in love with Katie.\n\n\nEric exclaimed that Katie was Brooke's sister. \"So what? I don't understand -- \" Ridge started to say, but Eric cut Ridge off. \"I don't understand! You want to take this company into the future, do it with Brooke,\" Eric decreed.\n\n\nRidge explained that he'd found something special with Katie, and his personal life didn't matter at work. Eric replied that it was a public relations nightmare. Ridge said they'd weathered scandals before, mostly Eric's, but Eric relayed that children were involved. Eric questioned whether Ridge wanted to put R.J. and Will through that just to punish Brooke. Ridge claimed he wasn't punishing her, but Eric believed that was exactly what Ridge was doing.\n\n\n\"You spent all these months in Europe, trying to decide whether to forgive her or not. You know what happens when you're gone like that, pouting someplace? Life goes on. Now get over it. Just get over it,\" Eric demanded. Eric told Ridge to get over the jealousy and do what was right.\n\n\nRidge asked if denying his feelings was right. \"Oh, Ridge, grow up,\" Eric quipped. Eric asked if he really wanted Eric to replace Rick with Ridge, who'd run off with Bill's Spencer's wife and left the path open for Bill to get with Brooke. To Eric, a \"fool like that\" wasn't good enough to run the company.\n\n\nEric ordered Ridge to end it with Katie. Ridge sarcastically assumed that if he did that, \"then\" Eric would give Ridge Rick's job. \"No. No, I'll give you mine. You want to run this company, get your ass to Brooke, where you belong,\" Eric concluded. Ridge asked if he'd heard Eric correctly. Eric replied that Forrester would be Ridge's once Ridge went back to his family and Brooke.\n\n\nBack in Rick's office, Rick told Brooke that she was his favorite co-vice president. Laughing, Brooke requested that Rick be patient with Ridge. She figured Ridge would hate working under Rick but would get used to it. Rick had been nervous about the outcome of the meeting, and it felt good to him to know that Eric had faith in him.\n\n\nRick got called away to work on something, and as Brooke sat down to work, Katie entered to say that she'd heard congratulations were in order about Brooke's new position. Brooke thanked Katie, who then asked if Brooke had gotten it through old-fashioned flirting. \"What?\" Brooke asked in disgust.\n\n\nKatie had surmised that, unable to accept that Ridge could want Katie, Brooke had worked her magic on Eric, and suddenly everyone's favorite fashion couple was together again as co-vice presidents. Katie was sure Brooke had already put the reserved sign on the steam room door, but Katie wasn't going to let Brooke get away with it.\n\n\nBrooke said that the job had been Eric's idea, not hers. The disbelieving Katie reasoned that if it had all been Eric's idea, then Brooke could have turned it down. Yelling, Brooke asked what Katie wanted Brooke to do.  Brooke assumed it was to stay at home and cry her eyes out. Brooke said she wouldn't do that. She'd go to work, and she'd protect her children instead.\n\n\nBrooke believed her children needed her after Ridge had pushed them around and had fired Oliver. Katie said Ridge had the right to fire Oliver, but Brooke replied that Ridge had to check with Rick first. Brooke had no problem with Ridge being there, but he had to know that she'd be there, making sure that he played fair.\n\n\nKatie guessed that she was Taylor in the situation, and as Taylor, Katie was supposed to watch things happen, knowing they should be stopped because nothing was innocent with Brooke. Brooke declared that it was just a job. Katie asked who Brooke was kidding and said that in a month, Brooke would be giggling and standing around in her lingerie.\n\n\nKatie, who claimed to have watched the way Brooke had operated for years, asked if stealing Katie's husband from her could be enough. Katie asked Brooke to enjoy the fruits of her labor and be happy with Bill. Katie declared that Ridge loved Katie, and not even Brooke could interfere with that. \n\n\n",

Katie arrives unexpectedly and learns of Ridge and Brooke\u2019s shared position. Katie accuses Brooke of manipulating the situation to get what she wants: Ridge. Maya and Carter go on a date and see Aly an Oliver. Aly is excited for her first date. Carter tells Maya he feels that Ridge is in the right. Maya becomes unsettled when she witnesses an intimate moment between Oliver and Aly. Eric gives Ridge his unabashed opinion on his relationships with Brooke and Katie.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick wonders if Ridge is going to apologize for his hissy fit. No, that is not going to happen. Katie comes in and hugs Ridge. She thought she'd find out how his meeting went. Rick speaks up and says Ridge now realizes his boundaries. He'll leave it up to Ridge to fill her in. Ridge tells her that once again little Rickie got his way with Daddy. Eric welcomes Brooke as VP and says he knows she will be a good one. She wonders if Eric is up to something; some matchmaking even by putting her and Ridge together to work such long hours so closely. She appreciates him still believing in her and Ridge after all these year. He says that in the near future he expects her and Ridge to lead the company, after that it will be Rick and Caroline. She says that she and Ridge can work together very well with no personal feelings in the way. Oliver surprises Aly by asking her out for coffee. She hesitates but finally agrees. He takes her to the Bikini Bar where Carter and Maya are already there and are more than curious. Aly confesses she doesn't even drink coffee. Oliver doesn't mind, whatever she wants to drink. He takes her hand and says thanks for her support today. It meant so much to him. She tells him she knows today was not his finest day but she could tell him stories about Ridge over the years. Oliver spills hot tea on her hands and then puts ice on it to ease the pain. Then he kisses the hurt and notices her eyes fluttering. Ridge goes to see Eric and says he must change things. He can not leave it with Rick as President. He does not understand how Eric could pick Rick over him. Eric points out that Ridge has been gone over a year and should not expect things to fall back in place the way he wants it. Then there is the problem with Katie .how that will look to the public. If Ridge wants to run the company, then do it with Brooke. Katie wastes no time in finding Brooke alone and asking how she did it. Was it just plain old flirting as always. She flirts with Eric and gets him to name her co-VP with Ridge. She bet she has hug out the reserved sign on the steam room door already. Katie declares that she is no idiot and that won't work. Ridge tells Eric that he has found something with Katie and he knows Eric doesn't approve but it is not a publicity scandal. Eric says it is, he just wants Ridge to grow up. He wants him to end it with Katie. A man who would run off with her, his wife's sister, is not good enough to run this company. Brooke tells Katie that she is not going to turn the job down now. She is protecting her children. If Ridge wants to accept the job and work there too, fine, but he has to know she will be watching him. It's just a job. Katie tells her that she has watched her operate like this for years and they will be working and suddenly her clothes will fall off. Eric tells Ridge that if he will leave Katie, he will step down and Ridge can be CEO. Go back to his son, go back to Brooke.",

The couple will also work on a book together, but they'll have to wait until after the book is published. The duo will also be working on a movie together, which will be the first time the two have worked together.\n"
