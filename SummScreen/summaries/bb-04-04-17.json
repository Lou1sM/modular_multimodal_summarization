    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Eric had told Brooke he didn't want to be interrogating her about her failed wedding while Ridge and Quinn looked on. Eric recalled that everyone had been happy when Steffy and Liam had been married in front of the opera house in Australia. After the reception, he had assumed that she and Ridge would get married. \"That was the plan, right?\" he asked.\n\n\nEric wanted to hear from Brooke why she had changed her mind about getting married. Eric had figured that she and Ridge would work things out and had just postponed everything. Eric asked Brooke, Quinn, and Ridge to explain what had happened. \"Brooke, you wouldn't have done this without a good reason. It was especially important to R.J. He hasn't been told?\" Eric asked.\n\n\nRidge explained that they had to \"work through some stuff.\" Eric countered that he had to ask, \"Is there another woman?\" Quinn looked guilty. Eric didn't notice, and he begged Ridge and Brooke to work things out and tell R.J. before he heard it from someone else.\n\n\nBrooke asked Eric to stop his inquiry because she didn't want anyone else to be hurt. Eric promised to stop. He had a meeting to attend but didn't want to leave Brooke if she needed him. Brooke encouraged him to leave, and he kissed Quinn before he left.\n\n\nAfter Eric left, Quinn thanked Brooke, but Brooke angrily said she hadn't done it for Quinn. As long as Quinn and Ridge promised to stay away from each other, she wouldn't let it affect Eric.\n\n\nRidge noted that more people knew about it. He told them that Katie had confronted him. Brooke informed him that she had already told Katie to keep quiet. Quinn thanked her again, but Brooke was angry and reminded Quinn that she could have broken Eric's heart and ruined the company. However, no matter what happened, nothing would affect Quinn. Brooke warned that if there was even a hint of betrayal, she would tell Eric. Brooke told Quinn to leave. Quinn exited.\n\n\nRidge noted that they had to deal with the problem. Brooke was livid. \"I will never understand what you did on the eve of our wedding with Quinn -- Eric's wife. How could you?\" she asked.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Ridge that she had returned to him only because he had promised that she was the only woman for him. Yet he had betrayed her. Brooke chastised Ridge because Eric loved him and respected him even when they were at odds. She mentioned that Ridge was Massimo's son, but Eric had loved him like his own. She was in disbelief that Ridge could be so self-destructive.\n\n\nBrooke added that Eric had supported him and treated him like gold. He had also trusted Quinn and looked for the good in her. \"And this is what you do -- seduce his wife?\" Brooke asked.\n\n\nRidge admitted he had been a fool. Brooke replied that she hoped Quinn had been worth it. She removed her rings and set them on the table. Ridge stammered that he didn't know how to make things right. He didn't know what to say, and he agreed that he had made a huge mistake. He begged her to stay with him because she had always been the better part of him.\n\n\nBrooke wiped away tears. Ridge admitted that when he made mistakes, they were big. \"I don't even know why. It's senseless. I don't even like the woman,\" he said.\n\n\nRidge lamented that he was losing the woman he'd loved his entire life. He said it wasn't about hurting her. It was about him being foolish. He hoped that someday they would look back on that time as how she'd preserved their relationship.\n\n\nRidge promised that he had meant what he'd said when he'd proposed that they were destined to be together. He grabbed the ring and held it up to Brooke. He got down on one knee. \"Marry me,\" he said. He didn't care where. \"Together, we can face anything. I can't do this alone,\" he said. Ridge said he loved her and always had. He held out the ring and asked her again to marry him. Brooke cried.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Maya and Rick discussed that Liam and Steffy had married, but Ridge and Brooke had called it all off. Rick wondered what had happened. Pam and Charlie interrupted and asked why the wedding hadn't happened.\n\n\nPam asked if Rick knew anything, but he said his dad was trying to figure it out. Pam wondered if there had been any clues that Rick had noticed. Rick said his mother would have told him if something had gone wrong. Pam said it could have all been due to a giant misunderstanding. Rick and Maya left.\n\n\nCharlie insisted to Pam that there had been no misunderstanding. He recalled that she had wanted him to forget about what he had seen when Ridge and Quinn had been at the mansion. He was confident that Quinn and Ridge had something going on, and someone had found out.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Quinn entered and called out to Eric, but Katie answered. She told Quinn that she had been hungry, and the housekeeper had prepared a snack for her, but she needed tea. Quinn ordered Katie out of her home and reminded Katie that she was not welcome there without an invitation.\n\n\nKatie answered that she had made herself at home because she had learned all about what Quinn had done. \"Getting involved with your husband's son,\" Katie said. She said Quinn had really messed up.\n\n\nQuinn told Katie to keep her voice down, but Katie announced that Eric was not at home. Quinn looked furious. Katie wondered how Quinn had been so stupid because she knew Quinn was far from stupid.\n\n\nKatie chastised Quinn because Eric had unshakeable faith in her. Quinn said that it had only been a couple kisses. Katie laughed. \"A few kisses with your husband's son?\" she asked. Katie reminded Quinn that Eric would never accept it and would kick her and her portrait to the curb.\n\n\n\"One word from me, and your whole life is done,\" Katie said. She ordered Quinn to get her some tea. Quinn turned and walked toward the kitchen. Katie sneered at Quinn and then at her portrait.\n\n\n",

Rick tells Charlie and Pam that the wedding did not happen between Ridge and Brooke. They are all meeting upstairs right now and Eric is trying to get to the bottom of this. Eric tells Brooke if there is anything that he and Quinn can do they would like to help. Ridge says they are trying to work through this. Eric says he has to ask, is there another woman? Eric laments to Brooke that he is sorry if he is hurting her by asking all these questions. He sees they need to talk so he will back off for now. He tells Brooke that she is too strong for this to derail her. Quinn thanks Brooke for not saying anything to Eric. Ridge adds that Katie knows as she came to see him once back home. Brooke says again that she has promised and she meant it that she will say nothing to Eric as long as their little relationship is over. If not, then she will go straight to Eric. Brooke berates Ridge that he did this on the eve of their wedding but the worst part it is his dad's wife! He just keeps saying he messed up and they just need to talk about it now. She says Eric loves him, raised him, treated him like gold and now Ridge treats him like this. He seduced his wife. She is so tempted but she knows it would hurt Eric and his love for Ridge. He threw all his rights away when he put his arms around Quinn. She hopes she is worth it. Rick says something must have happened in Sydney as he saw no reservations in Brooke before the trip. Charlie tells Pam right away the something wrong is Quinn. That is why the wedding did not happen. When Quinn comes home she finds Katie draped on her couch and tells her to get out of her house now. Katie says no, she was hungry so she came over to see what her neighbors might have and she loves these little cookies. She would not think of leaving now. Eric has no clue. She has the best man in the world and she got redemption, now this, Eric's unshakable faith in Quinn. But his generosity, his love, his goodness was not enough. Leopards do not change their spots. Quinn says she can color it anyway she wants but nothing was going on but a few kisses. Katie says okay but Eric is not going to be cool even with that. He will kick her and her portrait to the curb. She has the audacity to ask Quinn to make some mint tea for her cookies. She will wait until Eric comes home. Brooke takes the rings and lays them in front of Ridge. He says they tried but they always end up here. He admits this has been his biggest mistake and he doesn't even know why. There was no plan.

And he knows now it is about her and in her heart there is room for her to forgive him one more time. He states again that he would like them to get married.
