    "tvmega_recap": "Adam says he is just very confused, he is not sure it is memories. Eve says she is his wife, she wants to help and protect him but he must tell her what he is thinking. She is aggravated by his obsession of who he is and where they were married. She feels like suddenly she is not enough for him. He can not believe she does not want him to be normal again. She rants that she is starting to feel used. She has spent much of her life taking care of him and now he is suspicious of her. Nothing is going to make them happier than they are right now. He says he has not seen that look in her eyes before. He is feeling like he does not know the real Eve. Brooke lets herself in and catches Katie again with a Vodka bottle although she has not had a drink yet. Brooke asks her just how long can she keep this up without telling Bill. He is not stupid. She laments that Bill is her husband and it's her business, not Brooke's. Bill walks in and Brooke says she wanted to hear about the wedding and Katie was filling her in. Adam tells Eve that he feels he is on the verge of discovering something right here. She says they can compromise. She is going to go finish packing and they can go away and discuss this further. He goes back to his composite photo but can not quite make out who it is. Wyatt takes Steffy to the bedroom where he has strewn rose petals all over the bed. They make love. Katie manages to dismiss Bill from their talk and then tells Brooke that she is not an alcoholic and everything is under control. If she tells Bill it will only worry him. Eve apologizes to Adam and says she just wants to be with him. Nothing is more important than putting their lives back together and they can not do it here; it is too cramped. They need to forget the past and think of their future. She loves him, pure and simple. She tells him about Oregon where they can camp, fish in the stream and she knows he will love it. He doesn't seem convinced. He goes back to his composite and remembers the bride walking toward him on the mountain.",
