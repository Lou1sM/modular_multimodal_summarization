Nicole was confident that she'd have it soon. Oliver wasn't so sure Maya would let Nicole into Maya's territory. Nicole said she helped Maya to be her authentic self, Maya helped Nicole, and everyone stayed happy.\n\n\nAt Quinn's warehouse, Quinn daydreamed of stabbing Brooke. Wyatt snapped Quinn out of it. He was alarmed to see her retreat to a dark place in her mind. Quinn claimed that nothing was on her mind. Wyatt figured he'd just given her some shocking news; however, she said there was nothing shocking about it, and Deacon had been \"gaga\" over Brooke for years.\n\n\nWyatt asked if it had been a mistake to tell Quinn. Quinn claimed it hadn't been, and she appreciated him looking out for her. He asked what she planned to do. Quinn said she'd talk to Deacon, get to the bottom of his feelings for Brooke, and take it from there. Wyatt asked if he should be worried.\n\n\nDeacon arrived and guessed that Wyatt couldn't trust Deacon to handle his own business. Wyatt stated that he didn't trust Deacon at all, and if he saw Deacon aiming heartbreak at Quinn, he'd tell her.\n\n\nDeacon respected Wyatt for that, and Deacon began to explain things to Quinn. Quinn interrupted because she felt it didn't require a long-winded explanation. She merely wanted to know if something was rekindling between Deacon and Brooke. \"Yes or no?\" she asked.\n\n\nDeacon asked Wyatt to leave, but Wyatt refused. Quinn said it was okay, and Wyatt left. Quinn said she'd trusted and committed herself to Deacon, as he'd wanted. He claimed it was true, and she asked if Brooke had become a problem. He began to speak about his feeling for Brooke, but Quinn asserted that she didn't plan to be anyone's second choice.\n\n\nQuinn said her question hadn't been difficult. She asked if he had feelings for Brooke or not. Deacon said he loved Quinn, but she noted that it wasn't an answer. She guessed it was no surprise because he'd been helping Brooke, who hated Quinn and forbade him from marrying Quinn.\n\n\nDeacon said Brooke would have a place in his life, but not Quinn's place. Deacon said Brooke wasn't the one he couldn't wait to return home to or the one he wanted to marry. He asked why he and Quinn hadn't done it yet. He wanted to pick a date and stop waiting.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Brooke arrived while Rick was talking to Katie. Rick said he'd been just about to tell Katie that he planned to work out his differences with Caroline. \"We've talked a little, and we've made some progress since she's been in New York,\" Rick added.\n\n\nKatie took off, and Rick noted that he hadn't seen much of Brooke at work. Brooke replied that he didn't need his mother over his shoulder. He conveyed that Brooke's opinions mattered to him, so Brooke decided to render an opinion on the decision he'd made to rehire Quinn.\n\n\n\"You know that she's absolutely insane,\" Brooke said. Rick claimed the consumers didn't care if Quinn was wacky -- they just missed her jewelry. Brooke said Ivy's line was doing just fine. Rick replied that Ivy was good but lacked Quinn's flair and experience. \"So we just overlook the fact that Quinn is completely out of her mind,\" Brooke assumed.\n\n\n\"Nobody's perfect,\" Rick reasoned. Rick said Quinn seemed to be more settled because of Deacon. Brooke warned that Quinn was as volatile and unpredictable as ever. Rick said he had Wyatt to run interference, but Brooke said rehiring Quinn was like inviting trouble to take a front-row seat.\n\n\nRick promised to keep an eye on Quinn, but he felt Brooke also had a problem regarding Caroline. Brooke stated that she didn't trust Caroline, either, after how things had gone, and but Rick had become very forgiving. Rick denied it, saying he'd held on to his pain like a badge of honor. Brooke guessed that things were better because he had the truthful Maya.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Maya asked Carter how long he'd been there. \"You were born a boy?\" the disconcerted Carter asked. He asked if her name was Myron. Maya replied that her name was Maya. Carter guessed it was a big joke then. She said it wasn't, and he told her it was crazy. \"We've been involved. I would have known!\" he asserted.\n\n\nMaya asked Carter to hear her out with an open mind. She said she'd never identified as a boy, but her mother had said she'd grow out of it. Her father had wanted a boy, \"and by God, he got one.\"\n\n\nMaya hadn't known what had made her different, but a childhood friend named Valerie had offered to play dolls with Myron. Maya felt that Valerie's innocence had allowed Valerie to see the real Myron, and it had allowed Maya to be herself without being ashamed. Maya had realized that at the core of her being, she was a woman, and she'd needed her outside to reflect it.\n\n\nCarter assumed that Maya had had surgery. Maya said it had been when she'd been with Jesse, who'd seen her through it. Carter mentioned the daughter. Maya said it had been Jesse's daughter, but Maya had been her mother in every sense of the word.\n\n\n\"You kept this from me the whole time...\" Carter uttered. He grabbed the conference table chairs and slammed them against each other. \"We were sleeping together! It didn't occur to you that you should have told me that?\" he screamed.\n\n\nMaya admitted that she should have told Carter, but she didn't think in terms of explaining that she was a woman. \"It's who I am,\" she stated. Carter called it bull. He said they'd been getting married, she'd been a whole other person, and their relationship had been a lie. He asked if he would have stayed with her. \"Who the hell knows? I never got to decide. How is that fair?\" he asked.\n\n\nMaya repeated that she should have told Carter, and Carter asked if Rick knew. Maya said that she planned to tell Rick, but until she did, she needed Carter to promise not to tell anyone. Maya claimed that she hadn't said anything before because of situations like the one she and Carter were in. She stated that he had no idea how it was to explain what she'd gone through to become her true self to someone who'd never questioned himself.\n\n\nCarter declared that the truth was that Maya claimed not to be ashamed of who she was, but she hid it. Maya claimed that it had been a mistake. She'd been afraid that Carter wouldn't love her if he'd known, but she'd learned from it. \"Not if you're repeating it,\" Carter stated.\n\n\nMaya promised she'd tell Rick if he proposed to her. \"I proposed to you!\" Carter bellowed. He declared that Rick deserved to know who she was. Maya claimed that it wasn't Carter's news to tell, and it was Maya's life. Carter added that it was Rick's life, too, just like it had been Carter's life.\n\n\nCarter stated that Rick had a right to know what he was into and who he was with. Maya asserted that she was the same woman Rick had always known. Carter told Maya to keep telling herself that, but they all knew how Rick felt about secrets. \"And they don't come bigger than this,\" he added. He yelled that she'd played him for a fool, and he wouldn't let her do the same to Rick.\n\n\nJust then, Rick entered and asked what was going on. Carter said he'd been just about to look for Rick. Maya asked Carter not to do it. Carter said he was single and had no children. His first loyalty was to Forrester and acting in the best interest of the company and CEO. Carter said that when the truth got out, and it would, he didn't want to be in some kind of \"you should have told me\" mess.\n\n\nRick asked what truth Carter was talking about. Carter stated that he and Rick had a lot in common, and Rick wouldn't believe what it was. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Carter is listening at the door when he hears Maya say this is her private business and she is proud of who she is. But Nicole counters that maybe but not who she was \u0096 Myron. Carter comes back when Nicole leaves and confronts Maya who knows he must have heard. Wyatt startles Quinn when she comes out of her daydream that she stabbed Brooke and told her look what she had forced her to do. Wyatt knows that look on her face means she is in some bad place. He feels like it is the calm before the storm since he just told her some pretty shocking news about Deacon. He had gone nuts and said he could have another chance with Brooke if it weren't for Quinn. He does not trust him. She says he may be right and they will find out soon. She says she won't do anything stupid. She is just going to stay here and ask Deacon about it, if he still has feelings for Brooke. Brooke finds Katie and Rick at the Skytop roof and she joins them. Rick says he is making progress with Caroline and trying to work things out with their working relationship. He tells her that her opinions are important to him and he'd like to see her around more. She brings up Quinn and why Rick re-hired her. Carter tells Maya this is crazy. They were involved and he would have known if she had been born a boy. She asks him to listen with an open mind. She never felt like a boy. She always liked pretty dresses and dolls but her dad wanted a boy so by God she was a boy. But in the core of her being she was a woman .and later she had surgery when she was with Jesse. The baby girl was his bio daughter but she was the mother in every sense of the word. Carter is livid that they slept together and she never told him. She admits she should have told him. He says their whole relationship was a lie and would have continued if they had not broken up. And now what about Rick ..does he know. She begs him to promise not to say anything to anyone. Brooke tells Rick that he can not re-hire Quinn never mind that she is completely out of her mind and dangerous. She is still unpredictable and volatile. Rick says she is changed and that is why Wyatt is still here to keep an eye on her. Deacon comes in and tries to defend himself to Wyatt. He tells his mother to call him if she needs him. Quinn says she trusted Deacon. She committed herself to him so is Brooke now going to be a problem? She says she is not interested in being second choice \u0096 either his or anyone else's. Deacon says he is trying to keep this honest and above board but it is not easy. She says he still has not given her an answer of how he feels about Brooke. He is there all the time and helps her and she even forbids them from getting married. He says she is the mother of his daughter and he will always care for her but she is not the one he wants to confide in and come home to. So Quinn needs to find her calendar and pick a date right now. Nicole states to Oliver that her sister will be happy for her to join in being a model and both of them will be happy then so it's just a matter of time. Rick tells Brooke that he holds on to his pain but it was the lies by Caroline he could not accept. But they can continue as friends now. She says he is mighty forgiving. Maya tells Carter that one of the reasons she never told him was this right now, people not understanding of what she went through to be who she is now. She learned from that and she will tell Rick when and if he proposes. Carter says he proposed and she did not tell him. She says it is not Carter's right to tell Rick. She is still the same woman he has always known. Carter says Maya played him for a fool and she will not do the same to Rick. And she knows how seriously Rick holds for people to tell him the truth. Rick walks in and hears the loud voices and wants to know what is going on. Carter snarls at him that he is single and the only loyalty he has is to FC. He was coming to find Rick and tell him something important he thinks he needs to know. Rick doesn't know the entire truth. Fear is on Maya's face as Carter tells Rick that they have a lot in common and he will never believe what it is.",
