    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy talked to Nicole, Zende, Ivy, Thomas, and R.J. about her wedding. Steffy and Thomas were sorry for R.J. that Ridge and Brooke hadn't gotten married as they'd planned. R.J. said nothing had changed about them being a family.\n\n\nStanding before an easel, Steffy showed off Ridge's newest design. It would be the showstopper for their next fashion showing. Steffy decided that the sketch had to stay locked in the vault unless it was needed by the cutters.\n\n\nR.J. volunteered to take it to lock up, but Zende suggested that they have Charlie do it. R.J. said he was headed that way anyway. Zende stated that R.J. had a lot of responsibility around there, and it meant that R.J. had to be a lot more careful with his work and his friends.\n\n\nThe meeting ended, and R.J., Zende, and Nicole left the office. Ivy still couldn't believe that Thomas didn't think having Sally at the wedding would cause problems. Thomas said it hadn't, but Steffy contended that Sally's mere presence created problems. He replied that Sally hadn't taken any pictures, she'd respected Steffy's wishes, and Sally had even offered to leave.\n\n\nSteffy asserted that Sally hadn't been invited. Thomas agreed that he'd pushed it, but he said he hadn't done it to upset Steffy. He admitted that he liked Sally. Steffy knew that he did and that he wouldn't have taken Sally to Steffy's wedding if he didn't care for Sally.\n\n\nIvy left, and Steffy continued to express her concerns about where things were headed with Thomas and Sally. Steffy insisted that Thomas be careful, just as Zende had advised R.J. to do. Thomas assumed it was because Sally was a Spectra. Steffy insisted that Sally was guilty by name and association, and Steffy didn't want history to repeat itself.\n\n\nSteffy and Thomas were happy that they could discuss things, even if they didn't agree. She was glad he'd gone to her wedding. Thomas was glad, too, and believed that she and Liam would be happy together. Steffy agreed, but Thomas said it was actually the part where she was supposed to say that he'd be really happy when he found his special person someday. Steffy stated that any woman would be lucky to date him, but he deserved better than Sally.\n\n\nLater, Nicole found her preoccupied husband setting up for a photo shoot in the backstage area. Zende was concerned about R.J.'s crush on Coco Spectra and stated that it wasn't the only Spectra crush they had to worry about. Zende said that Sally had been at his cousin's wedding -- and he hadn't even been there. Zende was in disbelief that Sally had flown there just because Thomas had wanted her to be his date.\n\n\nNicole guessed eagerness ran in the Spectra family. Zende was familiar with how the Spectras had taken advantage of the Forresters in the past, and he didn't want it to happen to R.J. Nicole understood Zende's concerns. Zende decided that he agreed with Steffy, who'd said it wasn't a bad idea to be extra careful at work -- especially with so many Spectras in the mix.\n\n\nNicole had spent time with Coco, and Coco had seemed all right to Nicole. Zende said earning trust took time, and Coco hadn't been there long enough yet. Nicole liked how protective Zende was of his family; however, she suggested that he let the co-CEOs keep an eye on the Spectras. Kissing him, she stated that she and her husband had other things to do.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Coco arrived before going to work at Forrester. Sally was working hard on her own designs and refused to let one bad review get her down. Before Coco left, Shirley gave Coco a new brooch for her outfit. Coco pinned it in the center of her shirt. She blushed and giggled as she remarked upon how much she was learning at Forrester with R.J.\n\n\nAfter Coco had gone, Sally said Coco had a crush. Saul and Shirley decided that the sisters thought about Forrester men too much. Shirley didn't know why Sally thought the two families were compatible. Sally retorted that she didn't know why the Spectras thought they could steal from that family.\n\n\nLater, Shirley and Sally were alone in the office as Sally worked on a sketch. The two debated about whether Sally's budding relationship with Thomas would end in disaster, as did every other relationship in Sally's life. Saul arrived with some sketch boards printed with images of the designs they'd lifted from Coco's jewelry camera. Shirley told Sally that Sally's designs were good, but they couldn't compare to \"these.\"\n\n\nSally was impressed by the elegant and refined sketches and asked where Saul and Shirley had gotten them. Shirley said Sally knew where; they were Forrester, but soon to be Spectra, designs. Shirley reminded Sally that they'd had a plan before Sally had gone to Australia. Sally guessed that Coco's new brooch had a camera in it, too.\n\n\nSaul and Shirley explained that they had front row seats to everything at Forrester, and Shirley remarked that they needed to spruce Spectra up a bit because Forrester had stained-glass windows. Shirley said Coco had no idea that she was saving Spectra, and Shirley beckoned Sally to take a look at the live footage on the laptop.\n\n\nIn the design office at Forrester, Coco was working when R.J. arrived. She was sad to hear from him that his parents hadn't gotten married. He believed that his parents loved each other, but they wouldn't tell him what had happened. Coco asked if he was okay. R.J. replied that he was better with Coco there.\n\n\nR.J. mentioned he was on his way to the vault, and Coco guessed he had something important. R.J. stated that it was his father's newest design and possibly a showstopper. He didn't think he should show it to Coco. She advised him not to. R.J. stated that she was there to learn, and he trusted her. He flipped open the sketchpad that had been under his arm and displayed the gown for Coco.\n\n\nBack at Spectra, Sally, Saul, and Shirley were impressed with the design. Saul called it groundbreaking. Shirley replied that it was all theirs. She sent a picture of it to Saul's computer and instructed him to turn it into Spectra's next masterpiece. Saul left, and Sally began to skulk. Shirley warned Sally not to go soft on them at that point.\n\n\nBack in the design office, Coco and R.J. discussed how well he was handling the news about his parents. R.J. didn't know how he could remain sad about it when good things were happening in his life. He was glad he'd met Coco. Coco felt the same way. The two kissed.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley stared dreamily at the laptop screen, but Sally, upon seeing the romantic exchange between R.J. and Coco, refused to keep using Coco or to steal from Forrester. Shirley sensed it was because of Thomas, but Sally replied that it was her aversion to going to prison.\n\n\nShirley remarked that her sister had made knockoffs for years, and all they'd had to do in Shirley's mind was tweak and deny. She said they were giving beauty and elegance to the working stiffs, just as Sally Senior had done, and they'd do it before someone else beat them to it.\n\n\nSally was willing to let someone else beat them to it, and she added that the someone else could take the rap for it, too. Shirley asserted that Coco and Sally were living in a dream world; it would all blow up for the sisters, and Shirley wanted to make a few bucks before it did.\n\n\nSally replied that she'd wanted to rebuild their legacy. Shirley asked if Sally thought the Beverly Hills elitist Forresters respected the Spectras. Citing Brooke's humble beginnings as a caterer, Sally said Shirley was wrong about the Forresters. Sally doubted Thomas would speak to her again if he found out that she'd done such a thing.\n\n\nShirley regretted sending Sally to Australia because Sally had returned a lovesick puppy. Shirley had raised Coco and Sally to be tougher. Shirley had made an investment in Sally and had traveled to the golden city to cash in. Shirley wouldn't be dumped for Mr. Muscles.\n\n\nSaul interrupted the argument when he entered to show the ladies a design board with Ridge's showstopper on it and a board with an altered design. Saul presented the design in pink and turquoise. Shirley thought they were glorious and believed the collection would save their butts. Sally stated that people would know they were knockoffs.\n\n\n\"Not if we show them first,\" Shirley contended. She said Sally would have a ton of men in her life, but just one grandmother. Shirley felt that she was looking out for Sally, and if they didn't do it, every single one of them would go down with the ship. She asked if it was what Sally wanted. In Sally's silence, Shirley declared that she wouldn't let it happen, and Sally's feelings for Thomas wouldn't stop them. She ordered Sally to buckle up because they were taking that ride all the way to the bank.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Shirley pins a brooch, in which Saul has fitted another secret camera, on Coco as she leaves for work. When Saul reveals the first two knock-offs for the new collection, Shirley pressures Sally to get real and end her pie-in-the-sky romance with Thomas Forrester as business must come first. Thomas defends his decision to bring Sally Spectra as his date when Steffy and Ivy update Zende and Nicole on the romantic wedding in Sydney. R.J. remarks that it is too bad it did not work out for his parents. Later in the photo studio, Zende tells Nicole that he is worried that both R.J. and Thomas are canoodling with the enemy just as they prepare for the big fashion show - considering that the old Spectra Fashion never shied away from stealing Forrester designs - Unaware that Coco is an unknowing spy, R.J. invites her to see the latest and highly confidential design: Ridge's showstopper.

    "tvmega_recap": "Sally tells Shirley that she does not need a break. She needs to keep working on this design. Shirley looks at Coco and tells her she needs a serious piece of jewelry in the hallowed halls of FC. She gives her a flashy brooch and tells her to run along but pay as much attention to her work as that young man over there. Sally does not understand why Shirley thinks Spectra's and Forrester's cannot get along. Zende laments to Nicole that RJ is not the only one with a Spectra on his mind. Sally went all the way to Australia to be with Thomas. He does not want them to be hurt if they are taking advantage of the situation. It seems like a very big coincidence and they can't be too careful. Steffy tells Thomas, RJ, Zende and Nicole that her dad is throwing himself back into work and shows them his latest design. She wants no one else to know about it. Thomas tells Steffy that Sally posed no problem. She did not post any pictures from the wedding. He may have pushed the button but he did not invite her to cause problems. He really likes her. She tells him they cannot be too careful. Shirley tells Sally that she should be setting an example for her sister. Thomas is a Forrester and she is a Spectra, a disaster. And she explains that Sally's designs are okay but they do not compete with these \u0096 showing her some of the Forrester designs ..genuine originals, soon to be transformed into Spectra Designs. Coco has a front row seat to all the action. If Sally wants to get back to the Spectra roots that is what they are doing. RJ runs into Coco while he is holding the new Ridge designs and he says he is on the way to the vault but he trusts her and he proudly shows them to her. Thanks to Coco's brooch Shirley and crew see it all on the laptop and she says no one is the wiser, not even her sister. So she does not want Sally to have that sour face and pull out on her now. Nicole tells Zende that he is protective of his family and she loves that about him, but she likes Coco and thinks it is all right. RJ tells Coco that he is disappointed in his mom and dad but he will be okay. He gives her a quick kiss. On the laptop Sally sees it too and asks Shirley it off. Steffy tells Thomas that he is one terrific guy and she wants him to be as happy as she is, but she just thinks that he deserves better than Sally Spectra. Sally tells Shirley that it sounds like she thinks she is doing something good for giving to the working class. Thomas will never speak to her again when he finds out about this and she is sure in the end he will. Saul comes in and shows them the Ridge designs with a few of his changes. Shirley says these are great and will be a big hit especially when they can get theirs out first. They will all go down with the ship unless they do this. She tells Sally to buckle up. They will ride this all the way to the bank.",
