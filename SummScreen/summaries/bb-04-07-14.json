    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Bikini Bar, Carter and Maya watched Oliver kiss Aly's burned hand. Her heart seemed to be fluttering as she told him that it was all better, and the ice had been nice. Oliver noticed that Aly looked a little pale. She said she was fine, but she suddenly decided that she needed to go.\n\n\nAt Maya's table, Carter decided that he needed to go by the office. As soon as Carter kissed Maya goodbye, Maya strode over to Oliver's table to find out what was up with him kissing the hand of Aly, the Forrester. Oliver said that Aly was a nice girl. \"A nice Forrester girl,\" Maya emphasized.\n\n\nMaya and Oliver discussed how unique Aly was, and he said that she was innocent like Hope. Maya added that Aly was like Hope -- with issues. Maya assessed that Aly and Oliver were both pretty vulnerable and wondered what his intentions were. Oliver was surprised by the question, and Maya asked if he liked Aly. Oliver countered by asking if Maya was jealous. Maya giggled.\n\n\nMaya warned Oliver to be careful. She said that he was an attractive guy, but he shouldn't use it. \"Don't hurt her,\" Maya added and left.  Oliver spotted Aly's sunglasses on the table, and he smiled.\n\n\nIn Aly's room, Aly giggled to herself and touched her hand to her face. A vision of her mother's head appeared and hovered near the ceiling. Aly told the vision that Oliver had kissed her hand, and no other guy had done that. The Darla vision believed that Oliver really liked Aly.\n\n\nAly said she'd had to get out of the bar, and Oliver probably thought she was very weird. \"The others? The kids at school? The bullies?\" the Darla vision asked. Aly asserted that Oliver wasn't like them; he'd kissed her hand, and that had to mean something.\n\n\nAs Aly stroked her hand, someone knocked on her door. She answered it to find Oliver on the other side. He said the maid had let him in, and she'd left her sunglasses at the bar. Aly stated that he could have taken them to the office, but Oliver replied that he'd wanted to see if Aly was okay after the way she'd rushed out of the restaurant earlier.\n\n\nAly claimed to be fine, and she invited Oliver into her room. \"Wow,\" he said, looking at the Hope fan memorabilia on the wall. Aly admitted that she was a fan, and Hope's message had helped her through some tough times in high school.\n\n\nAly recalled that Oliver had believed in it, too, and Oliver showed Aly the \"hope\" Chinese symbol tattooed on his ankle. Oliver guessed it was weird, but Aly called it beautiful.\n\n\nAly murmured that she hadn't had a guy in her room before -- except her father. Oliver said he liked the d\u00e9cor. It showed that she was loyal and committed. Aly joked that some people thought she should be committed. Oliver disagreed. He said that he owed her, and she was a really good person.\n\n\nAly bashfully said that Oliver didn't owe her, but Oliver replied that she'd been there for him when no one else had. Oliver said she'd gotten his job back, but she corrected that Brooke and Eric had done that. Oliver believed that Aly had been a part of it, and he told her not to sell herself short. In his view, she'd bought him time, but Ridge always got what he wanted.\n\n\nAly assumed Oliver thought Ridge would try again. Oliver was sure Ridge would find some excuse to get rid of Oliver. Aly declared that she wouldn't let that happen. Oliver smiled, asking from where she got her \"take no prisoners thing.\" Aly replied that she was a Forrester, but he said she wasn't like any of them, whose egos were their strong suits.\n\n\nOliver noted that Aly stood up for her beliefs, even if they weren't popular. Aly grew quiet, and he asked if she didn't like him to talk about her that way. Aly claimed she wasn't used to it, but he told her to get used to it because she was incredible.\n\n\nOliver noted the impact that Aly had made upon Hope by telling Hope what she'd needed to hear. Aly was glad that Hope had listened because Hope shouldn't have been modeling underwear. Oliver stated that the Forresters needed Aly, and she was good for them. \"Good for me, too,\" he added.\n\n\nAly thanked Oliver for collecting her sunglasses for her. Oliver realized that she wasn't good at taking compliments. Aly started to murmur that she wasn't used to them, but he finished the sentence for her. Aly awkwardly said that she guessed she'd see him the following day. Oliver swooped in and kissed her. Aly looked amazed, and Oliver did it again.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge figured that Brooke had really done a number on Eric. Eric replied that Brooke didn't know anything about it, and he was doing it for Ridge's own good. Eric felt that Ridge was angry and taking his feelings out on Brooke. Ridge said that his feelings for Katie had nothing to do with Brooke. Eric believed that Ridge's feelings were a direct result of Brooke's affair with Bill.\n\n\nEric declared that Ridge had loved Brooke for his whole life, and Eric wasn't about to believe that it was no longer true. Ridge laid out his choices: he could be co-vice-president with Brooke forever, or he could leave Katie, be with Brooke, and \"and all this -- this chair -- is mine.\"\n\n\nEric asked if there was really any choice. Ridge declared that he loved Katie, and he wouldn't leave her. \"Not even for all of this,\" Ridge added and walked out the door.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Katie said that Brooke could have turned down her new position out of respect for Katie and her new relationship with Ridge. Brooke countered that Katie could have turned down Ridge out of Katie's respect for Brooke and Brooke's family. Katie claimed that she'd tried it, and it hadn't worked because Ridge didn't want Brooke anymore.\n\n\nKatie figured that was probably hard for Brooke to believe, and Brooke agreed that it was. Katie said she was sorry, but Brooke told her not to be because it wasn't over. Katie insisted that she and Ridge were in love. Brooke guessed Katie had arrived there to remind Brooke of that.\n\n\nKatie insisted that Brooke had somehow gotten Eric to make the decision to have co-vice-presidents. Brooke said that Katie hadn't been at the meeting; therefore, Katie had no idea how much Brooke and Ridge were not on the same page. \"About whom he's spending his life with?\" Katie asked.\n\n\n\"About anything!\" Brooke asserted. She said that Ridge had tried to demote her son, he'd marginalized Hope, and he'd fired Oliver. Brooke had fought Ridge on those things, and she was determined to keep fighting him. \"I'm not flirting with Ridge! I'm fighting him!\" Brooke exclaimed.\n\n\nBrooke claimed that Bill and Ridge weren't on her radar, but what was happening at the company was. Katie said that Ridge knew what he was doing, but Brooke disagreed, citing that he was shoving Hope to the sidelines. Katie asked what the problem was if Eric hadn't agreed with it.\n\n\nBrooke stated that Katie knew Ridge, and he always got what he wanted. Disbelieving that Brooke was there for her children, Katie said that she hated seeing Brooke that way. Brooke looked confused, and Katie told Brooke to accept that Ridge was with Katie. Katie knew Brooke wouldn't be able to accept it, but Katie said it was done and over. Katie strode out of the office.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was in the CEO's office with Eric, who wanted her and Ridge to work together and work out their differences. Brooke said she wasn't there to work out her differences, but Eric insisted that it was exactly what she'd do. They agreed that Ridge could be as stubborn as a mule, and Eric revealed that he'd made Ridge an offer that he couldn't refuse. \"And he'd refused it,\" Eric added.\n\n\nBrooke asked what the offer had been, and Eric said he'd offered Ridge the CEO's position. She wondered why Ridge would turn it down, and Eric replied that the stipulation had been a reunion with her. Brooke's mouth dropped open. She couldn't believe Eric had put Ridge ahead of Rick for the seat.\n\n\nEric insisted that the future of the company was Brooke and Ridge, and Eric wanted them back together. Brooke stated that Ridge didn't want that, but Eric was sure that Ridge would see the light. Eric felt that Katie was wonderful, but she wasn't the woman for Ridge. Eric believed that Ridge knew that deep down.\n\n\nLater, Ridge arrived in Katie's bedroom. It was lit with candles, and she strode out in her lingerie to greet him. They remarked that their talks with Eric and Brooke hadn't gone well, and as Katie massaged and undressed Ridge, she said she'd like to believe that Ridge's new position had been all Eric's idea. Ridge figured that the motive was the same, so there was no difference.\n\nKatie guessed that the motive was a reunion of Brooke and Ridge. She asked how Ridge would handle it. He said he'd man up and deal with it. Kissing him, Katie stated that Eric would \"come around.\" Ridge explained that Eric had offered the CEO position to Ridge if Ridge would get back with Brooke.\n\n\nKatie smoldered in anger and said Eric's offer was \"just awesome.\" Katie guessed that it was everything Ridge wanted. Ridge replied that he had everything he wanted. Ridge loved Katie, but she might have to support him if he lost his job. She laughed, and he promised that he wouldn't leave her.\n\n\nKatie said it had been a good opportunity, but Ridge called it a bribe. To him, the bribe hadn't been good enough because he had Katie, and that was all he wanted. They kissed and made out on the bed. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge is shocked when Eric makes him an offer to have his job as CEO. When Eric lays out the stipulations attached to the deal, Ridge is forced to make a decision. Katie and Brooke discuss the circumstances that they find themselves in and neither is willing to back down. Maya becomes suspicious of Oliver\u2019s intentions when she witnesses him out with Aly.. Aly rushes out of the Bikini Bar after her encounter with Oliver. Once at home in her bedroom, Aly discusses Oliver with Darla. Ridge and Katie continue to bask in their new found love.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge repeats the words back to Eric. If he leaves Katie and goes back to Brooke then Eric will step aside and Ridge will be CEO. Ridge thinks Brooke must have really done a number on Eric. Eric assures him that Brooke knows nothing about this. Eric is doing this for Ridge and his family. He knows he is with Katie as a direct result of Brooke being with Bill Spencer. He has to get over that. He's not sure Ridge has much of a choice when he recaps it. Katie grills Brooke. Brooke says she is not trying to come between her and Ridge. She is simply going to be co-VP with him. But this is not over. Katie could have let Ridge go out of respect for her and her family. Katie says as painful as it might be, Ridge does not want Brooke. They are in love and committed to each other. Brooke says she does not have to be reminded of that. This decision was Eric's and she can't tell Katie enough how she and Ridge are not on the same page. He tried to demote both Rick and Hope and fired Oliver, all of which she fought him on and will continue to do so. She is not flirting with Ridge; she is fighting him. Maya stares at Oliver as he kisses Aly's burned hand. She's a little flustered but says she is better and it was nice. Then she abruptly jumps up and says she has to go, even without drinking her tea. Carter needs to go back to the office. Maya makes a beeline to Oliver's table. He mentions it being a close call with the Ridge bomb falling on him. She asks what is up with him being with Aly. He says she's kind of cute but shy. Maya points out yes but a Forrester. He says he is a nice guy so that has nothing to do with anything. She says she wonders about his intentions. She has never met a person more idealistic than Aly, pretty innocent and vulnerable. He laughs and says he had not thought of any intentions. Maya reminds him that he did kiss her hand and it seemed to mean a lot to Aly. She tells Oliver that he is an attractive guy so don't use that, don't hurt Aly. He sees Aly's sunglasses she left on the table and starts thinking. Aly arrives back in her room, still all aglow in what just happened. She pats her flushed face with water and picks up a pix of her mother. Darla speaks to her and says Oliver is a nice guy. He kissed her hand so he must like her. He is not like the other bullies at school. Ridge tells Eric that he fights a tough battle but he's not sure he sees this as being the best thing for Ridge and his family. Eric tells him if he wants to be CEO then act like a CEO. The press can not get wind of him and Katie. Ridge says he is not going to hide Katie. They will just deal with it. Eric says not as CEO. Ridge counters okay but he loves Katie and he is not going to leave her, not for all of this. He leaves a stunned Eric. Brooke tells Katie that neither Bill nor Ridge are on her radar; only her children and working for the company are. Katie says she can tell her that she is here for her children, but they know the truth. She is here for Ridge. She knows Brooke will never accept that he is with her now, but she better as it is over for them. Oliver knocks on Aly's door. She's surprised when he says the maid let him in and said she was upstairs. She left her glasses behind at Bikini. She asks if he wants to come in. All it takes is one quick look around and he says WOW. She says yeah she is a fan, of Hope and her message. It got her through some troubled times during high school. He admits he believed it too and shows her his ankle with Hope in Chinese symbol. She thinks that is beautiful. He says he likes her room. It shows she is loyal. He likes her. She's a really good person. And not to sell herself short. She was there for him when he got fired when no one else was. It bought him some time. Course in the end Ridge will probably do it again. She sits on her bed and he follows. He says photographers are a dime a dozen so his portfolio doesn't mean all that much. He likes Aly's take no prisoners attitude. She may be a Forrester but she is not like them. Ego is one of their strong suits. He tells her she is good for the Forrester's and for him too. He realizes she is not good at receiving compliments. He leans in and kisses her, then again and she responds. Eric tells Brooke that he made Ridge an offer that he couldn't refuse, but he did refuse it. The one stipulation was he get back with Brooke. So she will be working with Ridge as co-VP. They've done it before and can again. Brooke doesn't like that Eric was going to put Ridge ahead of Rick. He says the future is Ridge and Brooke. He wants them back together. He will come to his senses in time. Katie is wonderful but she is not the woman for Ridge and deep down he knows that too. Ridge goes home to find Katie in a sexy teddy and candles all lit in the bedroom. He reveals that Eric offered him the CEO position today but only if he went back to Brooke. Katie says that must be awesome, everything Ridge wants. He says no, he has everything he wants right here. He loves her and with no job she may have to support him. He says it was not a great opportunity; it was a bribe, a good one but not good enough. They kiss and then fall back on the bed.",
