Maya angrily told Carter to stop, but Carter maintained that Rick had a right to know who Maya was.\n\n\nRidge entered and interrupted the tense situation. Carter said that Maya had been living a lie. Rick called Carter jealous and said Carter was \"still pining away for Maya.\"\n\n\n\"Why else would you be so angry?\" Rick asked. Rick suggested that Carter should try to find a woman like Maya -- \"as unique and special as Maya,\" Rick said. Rick told Carter to leave and apologized to Maya that Carter had been so insulting. Maya left the office and paused outside the door, so upset that she strained to catch her breath.\n\n\nInside the office, Ridge and Rick discussed the latest line that Ridge and Caroline had designed. \"It's fresh,\" Ridge said. He explained that they had plans to go big with billboards and more. Ridge worried that Rick had not been listening. Rick admitted that Carter had been irritating him.\n\n\nRick explained that Carter had implied that Rick didn't know anything about Maya and that Maya had been conning him. Rick planned to spend the rest of his life with Maya. He was convinced that Carter and everyone were jealous of his relationship with Maya. Rick planned to confront Carter, and he left.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie, Bill, and Liam met. They discussed that Caroline had told Liam that Rick had seemed to have a change of attitude. \"She said he was being nice, even cordial,\" Liam shared. Bill and Katie scoffed and agreed that none of them should trust Rick.\n\n\nBill wondered if Rick had second thoughts about his divorce. Bill was convinced that Rick might have finally realized he'd made a mistake in leaving Caroline for Maya. Katie disagreed. She said Rick had to have forgotten Maya's gold-digging days. Katie figured it would take something major to break Rick and Maya up.\n\n\nBill insisted that Rick would leave Maya if anything went wrong, but Liam argued that Caroline was perfectly happy with Ridge. The conversation turned to Brooke, and Katie shared that Brooke had a drinking problem and had turned to Deacon, whom Bill referred to as \"Mugshot.\"\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke warned Wyatt that he should not have told his mother about the conversation he'd overheard between Brooke and Deacon. Wyatt maintained that his mother had a right to know the truth. \"You overreacted,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nWyatt reminded Brooke that she and Deacon had discussed that if Deacon had not been engaged, then Brooke and Deacon might have had a second chance. Brooke responded that it had all been hypothetical, and Deacon had maintained that Quinn was good for him, and he loved her.\n\n\nBrooke added that Quinn was dangerous, and no one could control her -- not even Deacon. \"He's going to honor his commitment to your mother,\" Brooke said. Wyatt disagreed. \"I believe he's still in love with you,\" Wyatt said. Brooke said she didn't want to see Deacon with Quinn because Quinn was unstable.\n\n\nAt Quinn's place, Deacon begged Quinn not to call off their wedding because of \"a throwaway remark\" he'd made. \"I want to be with you,\" he said. Quinn was furious. She said she'd believed that he wanted to be her husband, but she didn't want him if he was \"the slightest bit in love with Brooke.\" Deacon nodded that he'd understood.\n\n\n\"My son heard you daydreaming about a life with Brooke,\" Quinn accused. Deacon defended himself that he would always care about Brooke on some level, but he wanted to spend his life with Quinn.\n\n\nDeacon begged Quinn to pick a wedding date and marry him. Quinn was frustrated, and she put on her coat. She said she had to leave and clear her head. She left, and Deacon worried.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt showed up, and Deacon accused him of giving Quinn another reason to hate Brooke. Wyatt looked apprehensive, and Deacon worried about what Quinn would do next.\n\n\nOutside Brooke's house, Quinn lingered at the front door and fantasized about stabbing Brooke. Brooke opened the door and promised that if Quinn laid a hand on her, she would call the police. Quinn accused Brooke of leading Deacon on and trying to break them up. Quinn warned that Brooke should never have messed with her. \"Do I look scared to you?\" Brooke countered. Quinn smirked. \"Trust me, you will be. You'll be very scared,\" Quinn threatened.\n\n\nQuinn added that there was no way she would allow Brooke to interfere in her engagement. \"We'll see,\" Brooke said. Quinn reasoned that she had been interested in only two men in her entire life -- Bill and Deacon. \"I take my relationships very seriously,\" she said. She added that Brooke had had countless marriages, affairs, and children. \"Deacon is taken. Find yourself a new A.A. partner,\" she warned. \"Or what?\" Brooke dared.\n\n\nIn Carter's office, he flashed back to happy times with Maya. He remembered kissing her. He recalled that he'd asked her to marry him. He had slipped a ring on her finger. He remembered making love to Maya. Maya walked in.\n\n\n\"How dare you,\" Maya shouted. Carter maintained that nothing could save her, and Rick had a right to know. Maya maintained that she'd had to deal with \"enough crap\" in her life. She begged Carter to have some compassion and empathy, but he reminded her that she'd had no problem lying to him about her former life as a man.\n\n\n\"I am a woman. You will not say one word to Rick. I won't let that happen,\" Maya boomed. Maya promised to tell Rick in her own time. \"We are devoted to each other. He will love me no matter what,\" Maya said. Carter pressured Maya to tell Rick immediately.\n\n\n\"You're too scared to do it,\" Carter said. Maya ordered Carter to leave her alone. \"Stop pressuring me. I will not be bullied,\" Maya countered. She promised to tell Rick after he proposed, but Carter was unwilling to keep the information from Rick.\n\n\n\"You really think Rick will forgive you?\" Carter asked. Carter reminded Maya that her secret would have an impact on the company and its customers around the world. It would be a scandal no matter what.\n\n\nMaya maintained that a very powerful LGBT community would support her and praise Forrester, but Carter said she was taking a big risk. Maya angrily warned that Carter would be fired if he opened his mouth, but Carter guaranteed that Maya would be the one who was out of Forrester.\n\n\nRick stormed in and demanded to know what Carter had been talking about. \"Whatever the hell this is, it's time to get it out in the open. Tell me,\" Rick ordered Carter. Carter looked at Maya, and Maya glared at him.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Carter tells Rick that he won't believe this. Maya tries to stop him and Carter says if she doesn't tell him he will. He needs to know. Brooke pours Wyatt a lemonade and he says he could not live with himself if he had not told his mother about Deacon. He still does not trust him. He owes his mother the truth if he is still in love with Brooke. Quinn tells Deacon that she thinks Deacon is panicking. He declares what he said to Brooke meant nothing. She says okay then now is the time for him to be a big boy and say it to her face how he really feels about old Quinn. There is no way in hell that she is going to marry him if there is the slightest doubt he still loves Brooke. Bill tells Katie that maybe Rick is having second thoughts about Caroline and she wants him back over Ridge. Maya breaks up a shouting match between Rick and Carter with Carter saying he will not shut up. Rick has the right to know this. Ridge hears and comes in. No Rick will not hear this. He wants Carter out and accuses him of still pining away for Maya. Rick tells Carter to get out and find his own woman. He won't find one like Maya but he is free to look. He apologizes to Maya for her having to put up with that. Wyatt tells Brooke that he is not trying to start something here. Brooke tells him that his mother is highly unstable and Deacon should not be marrying her. Deacon pleads his case to Quinn and says what he feels for Brooke is not even close to what he has with Quinn. He begs her to pick a date and let them do this. Instead she leaves. Maya flies into Carter's office and says she will not let him talk to Rick. It is not his business. She is a woman even though her body said she was once a man. She's lived with this crap all her life and she will not put up with it from Carter. Bill tells Liam and Katie that Caroline will be fine, it is Brooke they should be worried about. She is hitting the bottle and has turned to Deacon. And that is the last person she should be messing with. Deacon visits Wyatt and says he just had to put his nose in it and now Quinn may do something they will all regret. Quinn recalls her daydream about stabbing Brooke in the tummy. Then she knocks on Brooke's door and tells her she should have known by now not to mess with her. Brooke is not scared but Quinn says she ought to be. Maya tells Carter that she will not be bullied. She will tell Rick when she is ready and that is when he proposes. Carter offers that she has not told him for all these months so he does not believe she will now. Ridge realizes Rick is not listening to him at all and says he has no time for this. Rick rants that he is really mad at Carter and for saying that he knows Maya better than Rick does. Quinn tells Brooke that she is engaged to Deacon and they are going to be married and there is nothing Brooke can do to stop that. She takes her relationships seriously. Deacon is taken. She can find herself another new AA partner, understood? Rick asks why Ridge even cares. None of them like Maya but Carter is jealous and on some sort of tirade. He is going to set him straight right now. Carter tells Maya that she is naive. All have been duped. Rick will not risk losing his country club rights and prestige around the world for Maya's secret. She tells him if he tells Rick that she will have him fired. Carter says go ahead as when he tells Rick, she will have no power. Rick charges in and tells them to stop. He wants to hear it all right now, whatever it is.",
