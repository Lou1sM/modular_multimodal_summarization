Katie said that time alone with him was the best part of the day. Ridge and Katie toasted with glasses of wine. Katie couldn't imagine things getting any better. \"You ain't seen nothing yet,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nKatie was miffed that Eric had pushed Ridge and Brooke to work together as a result of Brooke's manipulations. Katie worried that Eric disliked Katie, but Ridge said that his father had used them as a bargaining chip. Ridge warned that the media would soon zero in on them as well. Katie claimed she could handle anything as long as she had Ridge. \"I got scandal chops,\" Katie said.\n\n\nKatie advised that Brooke would try anything to get back together with Ridge. Ridge professed that he didn't care because he belonged to Katie. \"Do with me what you wish,\" he said. Katie playfully went after Ridge, and more lovemaking ensued.\n\n\nLater, Katie and Ridge talked about being strong in stressful times. Ridge said he didn't doubt Katie for a minute.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill barged into Brooke's bedroom and declared he wanted her back. He brushed her hair, and Brooke dished on her day at Forrester Creations. Brooke told Bill that Ridge had made a play for the presidency at Forrester. Brooke shared that Ridge had fired Oliver and insulted her kids and their work. Brooke added that Eric had reinstated Oliver and made another announcement. Brooke said that Eric had appointed Ridge and Brooke as co-vice presidents.\n\n\nBill angrily denounced the decision and ranted about how he had accommodated Brooke when she had needed it. He had given her space and backed off when she had wanted to marry Ridge. He had watched while Ridge had kicked Brooke to the curb again. Bill couldn't imagine why Brooke would want to work with Ridge again.\n\n\nBill questioned if Ridge and Brooke would be meeting in the steam room. Bill refused to accept the arrangement. \"I'm not putting up with this crap any longer,\" Bill said. Brooke calmed him down and said that she needed to remain at Forrester to protect her children. Bill wondered if that was an excuse to be around Ridge.\n\n\nBill said he wasn't getting anything he needed from Brooke. Brooke insisted that she had never lied about loving Bill. Bill taunted her to act like it. \"I do love you,\" she said. Bill encouraged Brooke to take a shot at life with him. He was tired of waiting. Bill threatened he would never return if she didn't act immediately.\n\n\n\"I want you,\" Brooke said, \"Now.\" She and Bill kissed passionately and fell into bed. After lovemaking, Brooke promised she would never back out on him again. Brooke promised she would tell the whole world about their relationship. Brooke called Katie to inform her that she and Bill were a couple -- permanently.\n\n\nKatie wondered what Brooke wanted Katie to say. \"Congratulations, I figured you'd end up together,\" Katie said. Brooke hung up and smiled. She cuddled with Bill and looked like she had a plan.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Ridge couldn't believe Brooke had returned to Bill. Ridge didn't want Bill around RJ. Katie promised they'd get through it together. Katie claimed that Bill was not a monster when it involved kids. Ridge looked pensive.\n\n\nIn Aly's bedroom at the Forrester mansion, Aly seemed stressed after Oliver had kissed her. Aly called Oliver's kisses breathtaking. Aly admitted that Oliver had been her first real kiss. \"First kiss, and you chose me...I'm honored, Miss F,\" Oliver said. Oliver advised that Aly had a lot of catching up to do, and he kissed her again.\n\n\nOliver told Aly that she was a breath of fresh air compared to all the models he worked with. Pam interrupted the kissing when she knocked on Aly's door. Aly persuaded Oliver to hide in the closet. Aly opened the door and found Pam in a medieval costume. \n\n\nPam said they had to hurry to Medieval Night. Aly looked surprised and said she had forgotten. Pam headed toward Aly's closet to help her find something to wear. Aly stopped Pam and said she would meet her downstairs.\n\n\nAfter Pam left, Aly invited Oliver to return another time. They said they liked each other. Oliver kissed her goodbye, and Aly was elated. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Oliver and Aly talk about HFTF and each other. When Aly reveals to Oliver that this was her first kiss, he kisses her again. Aly makes Oliver hide in her closet when Pam knocks on her bedroom door. Determined to win Brooke back, Bill barges into her bedroom and tells her that there is nothing standing in their way of being together. Ridge insists to Katie that his commitment is to her and that she should not worry about him and Brooke being co-vice presidents of Forrester Creations. Brooke and Bill passionately reunite.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie and Ridge lounge in bed. She says she doesn't want things to change and she knows the force is gathering. He says let them; it won't affect them. And sometimes change is good. Ridge pours them some wine. He tells Katie that now that everyone in the family knows and his dad used him as a bargaining chip it will be just a matter of time before the press comes down on them too. He just wants her to be prepared. She says maybe they should hibernate the rest of the year. She definitely doesn't like the fact that he will be working with Brooke but Eric probably figures putting them together will eventually get them back together as he wants. She's surprised as she always thought Eric liked her. Katie says Brooke will get lonely; she always does. Ridge says that won't affect anything. It doesn't matter what Brooke wants. What he wants is right here. Brooke is getting ready for bed. She is brushing her hair when Bill comes flying through her door. He says he wants her back. And she might as well not say no as he is not going anywhere. He ends up brushing her hair and she loves it. He says he will brush it 100 times every night. She fills him in on the day. He's okay with everything until she tells him that she and Ridge will be co-VP's. She doesn't know why he is flipping out over this. He reminds her how patient he has been while he waited for her to marry Ridge again and then get kicked to the curb, only to end up with her sister. He can't imagine why she'd even want to be in the same room with him much less in a cozy little office. He wonders if the steam room is next. He declares he is not putting up with this crap any longer. She tries to calm him down. She says Forrester is the only place she can be now. She has a vested interest there plus her children that she needs to protect from Ridge. He's trying to barrel in there and sweep them out. Bill says she does not have to be there to police Ridge. Her children are grown and can take care of themselves. He declares that he is losing patience with her. He is not getting anything he needs from her and he is not putting up with it anymore. Bill tells Brooke that she said she loved him .she admits she does, but .he says then act like it. Show it, she wanted to find herself, take him along for the ride. They can discover themselves together out in the open as a couple. There is no Katie to protect; no hurt feelings from Ridge. He says he is standing there right now in front of her. And if she tells him to go she better make damn sure that is what she wants as he is not coming back. She looks at him long and hard and says no, that is not what she wants. She wants him. He hungrily kisses her and she says now. They fall into bed. Aly stares into Oliver's eyes. He says maybe he should not have done that. She thinks he regrets kissing her already. He says no; it's just that she looked a little freaked out. She jumps up and says no, but fans herself and babbles that she just needs a minute to catch her breath. Oliver realizes this is her first kiss. She finally admits he is her first. He moves closer and says she has a lot of catching up to do; and kisses her again. He tells her it is an honor that she chose him for her first kiss. He calls her Ms. F. He says she is like a breath of fresh air. He works with so many models that are been there, done that, jaded. He kisses her again but they are interrupted by Pam at the door wanting to come in. Aly directs Oliver to the closet to hide and stay quiet. Pam is dressed in her medieval wench costume and says they need to go now. They have turkey legs to eat and jousting to do. Aly makes an excuse before Pam opens her closet. She says she knows what she will wear and she will meet her downstairs in just a jiff. She apologies to Oliver for the interruption. He says it's her house and he came uninvited. She says he is always welcome. Then she says forget that. She doesn't want to come off as cheap. He says she couldn't even if she tried. He says he likes her. She is a terrific kisser and he does want to see her again. He'd better leave now before Pam gets back. He kisses her one more time and says he will be thinking of her. After they are spent, Brooke tells Bill that she is not going to back out on him. She is ready to tell the whole world. She picks up her phone and calls Katie. She says she is not calling to rub her nose in it, but she'd better tell her before someone else does. She and Bill are together now. .permanently. There are no more secrets. Katie is with Ridge and she is with Bill and that is the way it is. Katie says awesome; she is not surprised. She relays it to Ridge. He can't believe Brooke would do his again. She knows how he feels about Bill being with RJ. Katie says Bill does have his issues but he is not a monster. They will get through this.",
