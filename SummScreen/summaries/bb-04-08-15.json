    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Carter, Maya, and Rick had a tense discussion. \"You think you know something. Get it off your chest,\" Rick demanded of Carter. Carter looked at Maya and remained silent. \"You don't know a damned thing,\" Rick said. \"You're wrong, Rick. You don't know Maya as well as you think you do,\" Carter said quietly. Rick accused Carter of being a jealous ex.\n\n\nRick said that he and Maya had been through more than most couples had ever been through. \"Rick, I'm still learning things about Maya. In time, so will you,\" Carter said. Maya looked tearful.\n\n\nRick insisted that he wanted to know what was going on. Maya said it was nothing, and Carter reluctantly agreed. Rick warned Carter to be respectful to Maya because it could affect his job security.\n\n\nRick left for a conference call, and Maya said she would see Rick at home. Maya asked Carter why he hadn't told Rick the truth about Maya's transition from a man to woman. \"He needs to hear it from you,\" Carter said.\n\n\nMaya promised she would tell Rick when he proposed. Carter maintained that a ring on her finger wouldn't change anything. Maya made up excuses for not sharing the news with Rick. She said he was still worried about his divorce, and he had people threatening his job.\n\n\nCarter maintained that Rick had a right to know what he was getting into. \"It doesn't just affect you,\" Carter said. Carter encouraged her to be honest with Rick so he didn't feel tricked. Maya understood that was the way Carter felt. \"This is who I am -- the woman you see standing in front of you,\" she said tearfully. Carter walked out, and Maya looked concerned.\n\n\nIn the studio at Forrester, Oliver, Ivy, and Ridge discussed upcoming photo shoots. Ridge asked why Oliver needed a photo of him, and Oliver replied that they needed it for an article that was about to hit the Internet. Ridge posed for portraits, and Ivy told Oliver there was no rush on shots of her jewelry.\n\n\nNicole entered and instructed Oliver to shoot her next. Ivy and Ridge looked surprised. Oliver said he had not received an approval from Maya. Nicole maintained that she wanted to be a model. \"My sister's gonna pull some strings for me,\" Nicole said.\n\n\nRidge encouraged Oliver to shoot audition photos of Nicole. Oliver and Ridge offered her tips, and Ivy pulled Ridge aside to ask why he'd been helping Nicole. Ridge said that he hoped Nicole would be the undoing of Rick and Maya.\n\n\nRidge explained that modeling was always about the design -- not the model. Oliver and Ridge pointed out that every person had a good side, and they helped Nicole see hers. Later, Ivy pointed out the Internet article about Ridge and Caroline -- the new design team at Forrester -- was up on the Web. Ridge smirked. Ivy told him they could all be glad the article had been about Ridge and Caroline rather than about Queen Maya and her sister the model. Ridge smiled. Ivy left.\n\n\nRidge flashed back to his romantic evening with Caroline. The phone rang, and it was Caroline. He told her he'd been thinking of her all day and missed her. \"I have been thinking about you all day,\" she said. She promised to return to him as soon as she could. They exchanged \"I love yous,\" and Caroline teased that he'd better not be painting without her. They hung up.\n\n\nNicole entered an office and called out to Maya, but she found Carter. Nicole shared that she'd had her first modeling session. Carter wondered if Maya had set it up. Nicole admitted that she had not, but Ridge had encouraged her. Carter noted that Maya had wanted Nicole to focus on computer science.\n\n\nNicole wondered how Carter had known about her earlier conversation with Maya. Carter told her he had overheard her entire conversation, especially the part about how Nicole had threatened to tell everyone Maya's secret -- that Maya had been born as Nicole's brother, not her sister.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya returned home to Rick, and Rick suggested pizza and a Kings game. Maya admitted that she was not a fan of hockey. Rick acknowledged that Carter had been correct in that Rick did not know a lot about Maya.\n\n\nMaya looked surprised. She promised to watch hockey after everything Rick had done for her. They discussed that they had known very little about one another when they'd first met, and Maya had thought Rick was a homeless waiter. Rick gushed about how wonderful Maya had been for him. He said she meant everything, and he admired her honesty and integrity. They hugged, and tears streamed down Maya's cheeks.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke warned Quinn not to threaten her. Brooke added that she would not pursue Deacon, but she didn't believe that Deacon and Quinn were a good match. Nothing would convince her otherwise. Quinn said that she didn't care what Brooke thought. She just wanted Brooke to stay out of her life. Quinn left, and Brooke looked relieved.\n\n\nLater, Brooke and Rick talked on the phone, and Rick told her that Forrester needed her. She promised to see him in the morning. Brooke looked at her computer and saw the article about Ridge and Caroline.\n\n\nAt Quinn's place, Deacon told Wyatt that it had been a mistake to rile Quinn up. Wyatt said he had told his mother the truth about what he'd overheard between Deacon and Brooke. Deacon worried that Quinn would confront Brooke. Deacon told Wyatt that he was going to marry Wyatt's mother. Wyatt left.\n\n\nDeacon played with tools in Quinn's workshop, and Quinn entered. Quinn admitted that she had gone to see Brooke. Quinn shared that she had tried to get through to Brooke, and Quinn advised Deacon that he was done being Brooke's A.A. partner.\n\n\n\"Is that what you need to hear from me?\" Deacon asked. He promised to do whatever she wanted because he was committed to their relationship and potential marriage. Quinn agreed they would work on their relationship.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick tells Carter that he doesn't think he knows a damn thing about Maya. But if he does, spit it out and then leave. Maya asks why is he doing this to them. They just want to be happy. Rick thinks Carter is jealous but Carter denies that. Rick says he knows Maya better than most couples know each other. Carter stops short of telling what he knows but tells Rick that he better get the full story from Maya. Rick informs Carter that this is not helping his job security. And he knows he can trust Maya and she has been loyal to him and that is all that matters. And he demands that Carter give Maya the proper respect that she deserves. Rick needs to take a phone call so he leaves Maya and Carter alone. Oliver tells Ridge that he needs to take some pictures for the new structure of the company and Ivy will be next. That suits her fine so she can stay away from Maya and Rick. But they all wonder when Nicole waltzes in and wants her chance at a photo shoot. Ridge sees a chance and gives Nicole the okay for Oliver to do that. She is green as a gourd and doesn't even know that she, like all models, has a good side. Deacon tells Wyatt that he went about this the wrong way by telling Quinn about Brooke. Wyatt defends himself by saying he was only looking out for his mother. They both hope that Quinn won't go after Brooke now. Brooke tells Quinn that she doesn't know why she is here. She does not need a man in her life right now. She just wants to focus on her family and sobriety. But she does tell Quinn that she doesn't think her marrying Deacon is a good idea and nothing Quinn can say will change how she feels. Quinn says Brooke's opinion means nothing to her but just stay the hell out of her life. Carter tells Maya not to thank him just yet because he did not tell Rick today. Maya says she doesn't think he will. And she will tell him herself when Rick proposes. But with his divorce and all the dissention here in the office he may not ever propose. Carter says he knows that Maya thinks this is her life and hers to tell but if she is going to then she better do it soon. Quinn comes back home and try as he might Deacon can not get her in a good mood and she plays standoffish with him. She does say she is surprised that Brooke has not called him yet to say that Quinn had been by. She informs Deacon that Brooke will no longer be his AA partner. Deacon does not want to talk about that but about them. He guesses that Quinn told Brooke to back off so that must mean she is not finished with him yet. And Brooke will not interfere. Brooke talks to Rick on the phone and tells him that she will be at work in the morning if he really wants her there. Nicole walks into Rick's office to tell Maya something but only finds Carter there. He tells her that he was there earlier when he heard Nicole tell Maya that she was dying to tell Maya's secret and would tell everyone. He closes the door and says they are the only two people there that know that Maya used to be a Myron. Maya is worried but at home she tells Rick that nothing is wrong and she will agree to pizza and a Kings game. Quinn tells Deacon to stop trying to use his charms on her. He says he will if she stops acting like an idiot. He will argue all night with her if he has to. He reminds her he could be with Brooke right now but he is with Quinn, the one he wants to be with and spend a lifetime with. She does not say no. Ridge gets a phone call from Caroline in New York just as he is thinking about her and painting her picture. She says she has been thinking about him all day .and he better not be painting without her. They both say they miss each other and love one another. Rick is happy that Maya will watch a hockey game with him. He brings up when they first met and she thought he was a waiter. He says that he spent his whole life looking for the right woman but he was let down so many times before he met her. She has been so great for him and he does not want her to ever feel ashamed of anything. She is a woman of integrity and that means everything to him. They hug but Maya silently cries.",
