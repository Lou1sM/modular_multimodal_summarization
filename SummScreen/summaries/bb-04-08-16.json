    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn screams at Wyatt to be smart about this. All he has to do is walk away and not look back. He can have his life with Steffy and she with Liam. He tells her that she needs to be locked up. Steffy would leave him the minute she found out about Liam. Suddenly Liam remembers who he is and Steffy was his bride in the picture, not Quinn. Wyatt demands the key to open the lock but Quinn keeps berating him to just leave. Wyatt kicks in the door and on the other side is Liam who rushes toward him. Wyatt says he knows he has no idea what is happening but he needs to go with him right away. Liam smiles and says yes, he will go, he knows he is his brother. He says he is remembering more and more. He looks at Quinn and says she is insane. Frantically she rails that Adam was the best part of Liam and no man has ever talked to her like that. She did not plan on this or know what to do. He said she acted like they were married but he had no idea how far she would go. She robbed him of his life with his family. She rants until he tells her to stop pretending she loves him. She was only manipulating him. He said she tried to convince him that she was his Eve but he also knew that his Eve was somewhere out there and now he is going home to his Steffy. Bill tells Steffy none of this sounds plausible. Liam is somewhere and they need to find him. She agrees. It does not seem possible that the old Liam would leave his family, his job and her. But this new Liam might that was so bitter about everything. Quinn still tries to twist things around that Steffy was there once but that is behind him. She begs Wyatt to convince Liam to forgive her and get him to remember how he felt as Adam. She needs to get him away from this place. Liam says yes she is going away; she is going to prison. With Quinn still yammering they can start over, Wyatt and Liam manage to grab her and throw her into a closet and put a padlock on it. All the while she is screaming to let her out. Wyatt calls Bill who is surprised that he has found Liam and they are on their way to the cliff house. Bill says he is there already and so is Steffy. She will be happy to see him. At his home, Wyatt points Liam down the path to the beach where he will find Steffy. He says they were all worried about him but Steffy most of all. He needs to go see her. Steffy sits and waits until Liam comes into view. He sees her first and runs toward her. She senses his presence and gets up and runs as fast as she can toward him. She jumps into his arms and they hug.",
