    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's, Liam searched for information on Quinn Fuller on the Internet when Hope interrupted. Hope worried that Bill had spent the previous night with Brooke. Liam said he was surprised. Liam almost slipped and told Hope that Brooke had almost walked in on Quinn and Bill at Liam's house, but he stopped himself. Hope said she didn't want to live in the same place with Bill, but she didn't want to let R.J. fend for himself. Liam said she should move in with him.\n\n\nLiam went to the kitchen to make tea for Hope, and Hope noticed that Liam had been searching for dirt on Quinn on his laptop. Liam returned, and Hope asked about his search for Quinn's arrest record. Liam said he didn't trust her, but he admitted that his search hadn't turned up anything. He added that he was not being a poor sport or sore loser because of Wyatt. Liam said he was trying to look out for Hope from afar.\n\n\nLiam and Hope figured that Bill would move in with Brooke. Liam believed that Wyatt would want Hope to move in with him. Hope said she wasn't moving in with Wyatt. Hope advised that her relationship with Wyatt had nothing to do with Liam, but Liam disagreed. Liam pointed out that Wyatt and his mother had staged a reunion for Liam with Steffy in order to disrupt Hope and Liam's last wedding.\n\n\nLiam added that he had discovered that Quinn and Wyatt had been criminals, but Liam had tried to be respectful to Hope's wishes, and he had remained quiet. \"I think that you read that as I'm not trying hard enough,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam used his dad as an example. \"He never gave up on Brooke,\" Liam said, and he noted that his dad had been relentless in his pursuit and had been successful. Liam said that he would not be the nice guy who finished last. Liam kissed Hope, and Hope reminded Liam that he had resented it when Wyatt had kissed her when she had been with Liam. Liam countered that they had been engaged and committed to one another.\n\n\nHope shared that she would never forget what they had meant to each other. She said their choices had taken them in different directions. Liam said Hope had made choices that had taken her away from him, based on bad information. Liam said he'd chosen her, and that was what kept him going. He had faith they would be together someday.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke and Bill made love in her bedroom, and afterward, Bill made stallion noises, and they laughed. \"That's right, girl, the stallion is back,\" Bill said.\n\n\nLater, Brooke delivered coffee to Bill in bed, and she teased that she didn't want him to spill coffee on her Egyptian sheets. Bill joked they could live in Egypt as long as they kept a base in Los Angeles for when he regained control of his company. They seriously discussed their future living arrangements, and Bill suggested they could live anywhere in the world -- anywhere Brooke wanted to live.\n\n\nBrooke wanted Bill to move into her home. They kissed. Bill said he wanted to be anywhere Brooke was because the best things in life began with Brooke. Brooke kissed him.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Ridge and Katie had coffee, and she noted that he had been up in the night. Ridge said he had checked on Will. Ridge admitted that Brooke had upset him with her late-night call. Ridge said he knew that she had made the call in order to upset him. \n\n\nKatie worried that Brooke had power over Ridge, but he said that Katie had a greater power over him than Brooke ever had. He kissed her. Ridge angrily said that he didn't want Bill around R.J. Katie suggested that Ridge and R.J. move into her home. \"I'm kind of crazy in love with you,\" Katie said. They kissed.\n\n\nLater, Katie arrived at Brooke's house and asked if Brooke had been drunk when she had called the previous night. They argued about who had stolen whose husband. Brooke dished that Katie had been hurt, depressed, and sick and had made Brooke feel guilty for a year. But a year later, Katie had stolen Ridge the exact same way.\n\n\n\"You can't ever believe that you were wrong,\" Brooke said, \"just like Ridge.\" Brooke wondered what would happen when Ridge and Katie had their first argument. Katie laughed and predicted that Brooke would throw herself at Ridge in a hurry.\n\n\nKatie added that Brooke and Bill were very much alike as cheaters. Katie wondered who would stray first -- Brooke or Bill. \"If you have everything you want, why are you so angry?\" Brooke countered.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Bill barged in on Ridge while Ridge was pinning a dress on a mannequin. \"I am in your debt for the guilt trip you had put Brooke through,\" Bill said. Bill badmouthed Katie and said that Ridge had traded Brooke for Katie, \"a model that had some assembly required.\"\n\n\nRidge reminded Bill that he was talking about the mother of Bill's son. Ridge ignored Bill's insults and reminded Bill that they had no deal or swap. Bill told Ridge to enjoy his life with Katie because it was exactly what he deserved.\n\n\nRidge snarked that if Ridge had decided to return to Brooke the previous night, Brooke would have kicked Bill out of bed \"so fast, that cute little sword would still be spinning.\"\n\n\nBill warned that if Ridge ever displeased Katie, she would be gone like a shot. Bill noted that Katie was smarter than any three people he knew, but she had her quirks. Bill warned Ridge that Katie had lectured on drinking, cigars, and gambling.\n\n\nBill countered that no one knew Katie the way that Bill did. She had been his wife, ex-wife, and mother to his son. \"It makes no difference. Somehow, she will always be my Katie,\" Bill said.\n\n\n\"You make my skin crawl,\" Ridge said. Bill advised Ridge to proceed with caution because the third Logan sister had downfalls. \"There's a sucker born every minute,\" Bill said of Ridge. Ridge shook his head. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam is in his pajamas at his house carousing on the internet looking up Quinn/Fuller from 1960 to present. Hope drops by without calling first. He invites her in. She says she heard some voices at her moms and wonders if Liam knows if his dad spent the night here or not. Liam says no, he did not spend the night here. Hope says then she has a sinking feeling she knows where he did. Now who is going to hold Brooke accountable. It certainly can't be RJ as he is too young. And Rick will only care that it is not Ridge. Liam says he is surprised and he thought the last time Brooke was here that it would be over with Bill. Bill and Brooke have just finished making love again and they kiss and Bill whinnies ..the stallion is back. Over at Katie's, she finds Ridge already up with a cup of coffee. He says he knows Brooke came over last night to upset him. And it makes everything else she had said since he got back, a lie. And he doesn't want to speak ill of Bill, but he doesn't want him around his son. Katie suggests that maybe he and RJ should move in with her. That would make her very happy. Brooke brings Bill coffe in bed though he is hinting at breakfast. He tells her they can live anyplace she wants if he gets his company back. She says she likes her house a lot so she'd like to stay there. He says anyplace she is, he will be too. This is a brand new day. It's like being in coach and being upgraded to first class. Or being on a ladder and have fell off and now he's on the first rung back up to the top. All the best things in life begin with her. While Liam is getting Hope some tea, she sees the screen with Quinn's name. She asks him about it. He says he was just googling. Quinn is always putting him through a rat's maze so he would repay the favor. But it seems in the social media and newspaper articles that her name is only tied to Wyatt. He closes the laptop and says he wants her to know that he is not being a poor sport. He can't love her up close so this is just his way of loving her from afar. He wonders where she will live if Bill moves in with Brooke. Hope says she is not moving in with Wyatt although he will ask. She says her relationship with Wyatt has nothing to do with Liam. He says what he thinks is that when he is respectable and tries to give her more space that maybe she thinks he is not trying hard enough. Then there is his dad who is so pushy and never backs off and he always gets what he wants. He tells her that he is not going to be the nice guy who finishes last. He leans over and kisses her. She pulls away and tells him that he resented that when Wyatt did that. He reminds her they were engaged and they were committed .which makes him wonder if Wyatt has proposed to her. She tells Liam for him to please do not think she has forgotten everything they said or meant to each other. She hasn't, but the choices they made took them in different directions. Calmly he says he thinks the choices she made were either under pressure or on bad information. As for him, as long as he truly had the choice, he chose her. There is no declaration of love that he could not make again today. And that is what keeps him going and drives him. And she made promises too and he has faith that they will come true some day. Katie waltzes into Brooke's bedroom and says the new housekeeper let her in. Brooke says she hopes she did not wake either Katie or Ridge when she called last night. Katie knows it was payback. She wants things to be civil. No more bullying or calling in the middle of the night to gloat. Brooke tells Katie to look at herself standing here so superior and self assured after making her feel guilty for a whole year. She mocks Katie by saying the rest of them can be damned for eternity for one mistake but poor sweet Katie just has to say she was hurt or depressed or sick and she gets always with it. Her and Ridge are alike. They can't believe they are ever wrong. But some day they will have an argument. Katie says and she knows Brooke will be waiting for that. Talk about two peas in a pod, she wonders who will stray first \u0096 her or Bill. Brooke says so much for keeping it civil but if Katie has everything she wants, then she should not be so angry. Bill walks into Ridge's office at work while he is pinning fabric on a mannequin. Bill quips that he should have thought of that .disassemble Katie in the morning and stitch her back together at bedtime. Ridge says he hopes Bill is not under the impression that they have some sort of swap here. Bill says no, he's actually in Ridge's debt. All that guilt tripping Ridge did on Brooke, Bill thought he was doomed to be runner-up but Ridge snubbed his nose at the prize and now he is going for the some assembly acquired model so enjoy the life with Katie. It is exactly what Ridge deserves. Ridge tells Bill that Brooke doesn't love him. She just hates being alone. And he just happened to be the guy on one knee groveling. Ridge says if he had called that he was coming over, she would have kicked him out of bed so fast that cute little necklace would still be spinning. Bill says Ridge will love Katie unless he likes scotch or gambling or cigars or any sport more dangerous than ping pong. And once you displease the lady, boom she is gone like a shot. Ridge tells him that he makes his skin crawl. That is the mother of his child that he is talking about. Bill says he knows but no one knows Katie like he does and she will always be his Katie. He created her. Ridge should be grateful as Bill is going to give him the operating manual, Proceed With Caution. And he hears he likes poems. So here's one. Roses are red, violets are blue, Katie was mine and now she belongs to you. And it's the third Logan sister which only proves what he has been saying all along, there is indeed a sucker born every minute.",
