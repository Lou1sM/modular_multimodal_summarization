    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Rick and Maya kissed and discussed how he was dreading a meeting he had with Ridge that morning. Quinn barged in with the gatekeeper, Pam, on her heels. Quinn insisted upon giving Rick a gift for rehiring her. Rick opened the gift and saw the dagger-like letter opener. Stabbing the air with it, Rick said it might be handy, since he'd retired Stephanie's gun.\n\n\nRidge arrived and soured upon seeing Quinn. She ducked out, but Rick told Ridge to accept Quinn's presence. Ridge asked if he should accept it like he had to accept Rick's notes on the sketches. Brooke arrived and asked how many times Ridge had to be told not to use that tone with the CEO.\n\n\nRidge asked if Brooke had been added to the meeting. Brooke said it wasn't the point; his treatment of Rick was. Ridge asked if he couldn't disagree with Brooke's son. Maya quipped that Ridge disagreed about everything, but Pam called the statement unfair. Brooke felt that Ridge was being unfair. Ridge said he was just stating the obvious, and Ricky would agree.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that her son's name was Rick, and Ridge asked what the difference was. Brooke refused to allow Ridge to create more dissension within the group, but Ridge said Rick didn't need help creating dissension. Rick claimed that he'd acknowledged his shortcomings and was adjusting.\n\n\nMaya added that Rick and the staff were getting along, and Brooke said it was because the staff understood what Rick was doing. Ridge decided that he didn't have time for the motherly lioness routine, and he stalked out of the office. Pam left, too, and Rick thanked his mother, adding that he \"now\" had two women fighting for him.\n\n\nAcross the hall, Ridge griped to Pam that Maya was annoying, and Rick's mother was propping Rick up. Ridge received text messages with more design changes from Rick. Pam asserted that none of it would be happening if Stephanie were alive, and Stephanie would be the one firing shots. Ridge wondered when Eric would wake up.\n\n\nPam figured that Rick had snowed Eric with the \"poor me\" routine. Ridge guessed Rick had everyone snowed. Ridge was tired. Pam urged Ridge to remember that he was a fighter and his mother's son, and he couldn't let \"them\" win. Ridge refused to change his design. Glad, Pam noted that Ridge was the designer, not the number-crunching Rick.\n\n\nRidge said Rick had an insatiable desire for power. Pam figured that Rick had gotten it from Brooke, who wouldn't be the co-vice president if it hadn't been for Brooke's self-interests. Ridge stated that Brooke was good at what she did but had lost all perspective about Rick.\n\n\nPam believed that Ridge should be CEO. In her view, everyone wanted it, and it would happen. She added that it was what Stephanie would have wanted. Ridge uttered that he missed Stephanie, too, and he and Pam hugged.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Rick told Brooke that Ridge hadn't responded to Rick's messages. Rick joked about Ridge's refusal to take orders from the \"little runt.\" Brooke believed that things had to change and asked if Caroline was against Rick, too. Rick didn't think it was as bad with Caroline, but he felt that he could use reinforcements. Rick asked Brooke to return to work full-time.\n\n\nBrooke doubted that Rick needed her, but Rick reasoned that he could accomplish more without having to deal with a disgruntled designer. Rick stated that Brooke had always been a force in the company, and he wanted to count on her to have his back at a crucial time. He asked if he could count on her, and Brooke pledged to be there for her wonderful son.\n\n\nRick called someone to put out a memo that Brooke was back and kicking butt. Maya figured Ridge was complaining in his office about Brooke putting him in his place. Brooke refused to let Ridge push Rick around and felt that she and Ridge owed Rick for the way they'd treated Rick in his childhood.\n\n\nRick stated that Brooke didn't owe him anything. He was glad she was doing better and admitted that he'd started to worry about her. Brooke admitted that she hadn't liked the out-of-control direction of her life, but things were looking up. For the first time in her life, she wasn't thinking about a man. She was thinking of her children, mainly Rick. She apologized for the way she'd reacted to Rick and Maya, but after seeing how Maya treated Rick, Brooke was thrilled for them.\n\n\nBrooke left, and Maya and Rick joked about how Ridge would feel about Brooke's return. Rick was glad to have Brooke's support, but it didn't overshadow Maya's support. He knew there were things they didn't know about each other, but he felt those things would make them stronger. Rick loved Maya for the woman she was.\n\n\nLater, Brooke looked into an office and saw Ridge working. She entered and said, \"I worry about you.\" Ridge thought that was funny. Brooke didn't see why. Ridge said he couldn't take Rick seriously, and he likened Rick's control to a dog driving a car. She asked if Ridge knew how offensive he was. Ridge guessed he knew why she was there -- to prop up her son.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Ridge thought his behavior was unimpeachable and asked where he got off treating Maya as he did. Ridge retorted that Brooke was late to the party and hadn't seen how Maya operated. Brooke claimed to have seen how Maya loved Rick. Ridge guessed the prison system had worked, and Maya was rehabilitated.\n\n\nBrooke hadn't remembered Ridge being so arrogant and insensitive. Surprised, he said he'd been that way all his life. What Ridge didn't remember was Brooke being critical of him -- except where Rick was concerned. \"When did you start drinking the Maya juice?\" Ridge asked. Brooke claimed that Maya defended Rick while Ridge and Caroline tried to rip Rick apart.\n\n\nRidge corrected that he, not Caroline, was ripping on Rick. \"You really gonna defend that girl to me?\" Brooke asked. Ridge proclaimed that they'd finally gotten down to what Brooke wanted to talk about. Brooke asked if \"it\" was his midlife crisis, but Ridge quipped that it felt like his midlife salvation. Ridge believed he knew why Brooke was there, but he couldn't give her what she wanted.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Ivy fretted over a necklace, which was a departure from anything she'd ever done. Ivy felt pressure because of Quinn's return. Wyatt said Rick would like the necklace. Ivy stated that Quinn did good work. There was a time that Ivy would have loved to work with Quinn, but Ivy feared that if the collaboration didn't work, Quinn would throw Ivy under the bus to save herself.\n\n\n\"Talking smack about me already?\" Quinn asked as she approached and grinned. Quinn expressed that she was excited to work with the talented Ivy, and Quinn believed they could do great things at Forrester -- if Ivy could get beyond the bridge fiasco. Ivy asked what would happen if she couldn't do it. Quinn replied that they'd have a problem that Rick would need to know about.\n\n\nThe women got down to work. Quinn liked Ivy's necklace and offered to present it to Rick. Wyatt became alarmed, believing Quinn wanted to take credit for the work. Quinn said she was offering because Ivy was having problems with Rick. Ivy said she thought Quinn was actually trying to help.\n\n\nCarter arrived to notify the women that Rick had increased their budget, as long as they made every dollar count. Ivy quipped that it was in tandem with Rick's many other directives. Quinn asked what Ivy meant, and Ivy went on and on about how they were supposed to think of Maya and Maya's femininity while designing. Carter grimaced.\n\n\nQuinn suspected that Ivy didn't like Maya very much. Ivy stated that Forrester had changed since Quinn had been gone, and everything was about Maya. Noting that Carter had almost married Maya, Quinn was sure he had some tidbits to tell them about his former fianc\u00e9e. Wyatt said that Rick believed Maya was an open book, but Quinn stated that men in love believed anything.\n\n\n\"What about women in love?\" Wyatt asked. Quinn asserted that they were talking about Maya, and Quinn wondered if Carter knew something about Maya that they didn't. Carter told them that they needed to go over some projections, and as for Maya not being who she seemed, \"who is?\" \n\n\n",

Ridge barges in and Rick asks if he has a problem. Ridge says yes he does as long as Rick is behind that desk. Brooke shows up for work and chastises Ridge for speaking in that tone to the CEO of this company. Ivy gives Wyatt a compliment but not so much for her working with his mother. She is a little intimated. Quinn walks up and hears her talking smack already before they even start. Quinn says she is really excited about working with Ivy and she wishes she would get past that crazy part as she is a new woman now. Wyatt tells her to prove it and Ivy wants to see that in writing. Ridge continues to badger Ricky boy and Brooke keeps defending him as being better to the staff. Ridge has no time for this and leaves. Rick thanks Brooke for coming to his defense and says that makes two women on his side. Pam tells Ridge there is no way any of this would be happening if Stephanie were here. She would not let Rick run roughshod over those she loves. She begs Ridge to hang in there; he is his mother's son. Ridge says he is not changing anything on his designs. They are fine the way they are. And Brooke is okay even though she is siding with her son. Pam tells Ridge not to lose faith as he will be CEO himself once this is over. Rick says it might not be Ridge but something is working against him but he and Maya are trying to work past that. Brooke says he does not need her; he is working just fine on his own. He is still hoping he can count on her and she says yes full time if that is what he needs. He calls in a statement to the press and says Brooke is already kicking butt. She laughs and says everything is under control and she is even looking forward to the next man she will have in her life .and she is very happy for him and Maya. Pam comes in and Rick says his mother is back full time so run tell Ridge. He is sure he will be as thrilled as she obviously is. Brooke looks in on Ridge and says she is worried about him. She says he raised that boy off and on for years and now he is so offensive. Ridge asks if that is why she is here, to prop up Rick. Wyatt and Quinn and Ivy sit around and discuss Maya as Rick keeps saying to design pieces that play up to her femininity and beauty. Quinn suggests that Carter was engaged to her so he could probably shed some light on her. Carter shrugs it by saying no one is exactly what they seem to be. Ridge asks Brooke when she started drinking the Maya juice. He figures she wants something from Ridge but he can't give it. Rick tells Maya that it is good to have his mother back and on his side. He knows he and Maya are still discovering new things about each other but she knows how much he values honesty and she will always be honest with him.",
