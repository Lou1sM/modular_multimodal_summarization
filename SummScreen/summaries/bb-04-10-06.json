Nick tells her it is not her fault.  He refuses to let his father tell him how to live his life or who he can love. Just as Nick and Brooke are kissing, Jackie calls and tells him she has been arrested. \n\n\nMeanwhile in Nick's office at Marone, Ridge is so disgusted when he finds pictures of Nick and Brooke dressed as pirates that he knocks them off Nick's desk.  Massimo barges in and asks him what he is doing.  Ridge tells Massimo he cannot stand to be constantly reminded how his dirty stinking punk of a brother is trying to steal his family.  Massimo tells Ridge he has to get a grip.  Ridge wants to teach Nick a lesson. Massimo demands that Ridge stay out of it saying he has the situation under control.  Ridge tells Massimo he does not want him fighting his battles.  Massimo says his plan will keep the bad blood between Ridge and Nick  from escalating any further. Massimo understands how Ridge feels because he has been betrayed too by Jackie and Deacon. Massimo says a man does not come between a father and son, but Jackie and Nick do not seem to understand this.  Ridge gets angrier when Jackie's name comes up and blames her for encouraging Nick to go after Brooke and the kids. Massimo promises Ridge again that Nick will not be a problem. Ridge is curious about Massimo's mysterious plan.      \n\n\nAt the police station, Jackie is brought to interrogation room in handcuffs.  She tells them they have made a terrible mistake. Jackie says she knows her rights and she wants to make a phone call.  After she calls Nick she waits nervously, still not knowing what she has been charged with.  When Nick arrives, he gets the agents to remove Jackie's handcuffs.  The agent informs her that she is being charged with tax fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering.  He tells her if convicted she will face a 25 year prison sentence.  Nick wants to bail his mother out.  The agent tells them she probably will not be able to get bail, but if she does, the minimum bail will be 1 million dollars.  Nick tells his mother he will go to Massimo and get everything cleared up. After Nick has left Brooke stays with Jackie and watches helplessly while his mother is searched, finger printed and booked into prison.  Afterwards Brooke attempts to comfort Jackie by telling her Nick and Massimo will get her released.  Jackie is then taken to her holding cell.  Once she is in her empty cell the agent tells her to enjoy her privacy because she will not have it if she gets put into a federal prison.\n\n\nBack at Marone, Nick is surprised to find pictures of Brooke and him all over the floor of his office.  Massimo sneaks up on him and explains that his office looks like this because Ridge is very angry with him.  Nick brushes it off and tells Massimo he needs his help because Jackie has been arrested.  Massimo asks Nick why he should listen to him now when Nick refused to listen to what he had to say earlier.  Nick says he knows Massimo has friends at the FBI who can straighten this out.  Massimo continues to lecture Nick on why he should let Brooke be with Ridge.  Nick begins to wonder if Massimo is responsible for Jackie's arrest.\n\n\n",

Massimo promises Ridge that things will turn around for Nick and Brooke soon. Nick is telling Brooke that Massimo can't come between them just as Jackie calls begging for his help. Jackie is told she has been arrested for tax evasion, fraud and money laundering. The FBI book her and throw her in a cell, informing her that the chances of bail will be slim. Nick and Brooke rush to her side as Nick promises to get Massimo's help in clearing Jackie. Nick goes to Massimo but he refuses to listen and instead starts in on Nick about seeing Brooke. Nick suspects that Massimo has set Jackie up as a way to blackmail him away from Brooke.\r\n",
