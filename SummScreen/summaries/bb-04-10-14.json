    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the cliff house, Hope didn't respond to Liam declaring that he wouldn't give up on her. He laughed it off and noted that she seemed distracted. He wondered if something had happened between her and Wyatt. She hesitated, and Liam asked if he were being too hopeful.\n\n\nBill breezed through the front door, saying that there was nothing wrong with being hopeful. Bill was there to grab a few things, and Liam asked if his father was moving back in with Brooke. Hope mentioned that she'd seen Bill's car at Brooke's house the previous night, and Liam gleefully hugged and congratulated his father. Bill asked if Hope was there to share Bill's good news with Liam -- or if something else was going on that Bill should know about.\n\n\nHope seemed somber, and she changed the subject to her mother. Bill assumed that Brooke was sharing her good news with Donna. Hope asked about Katie, and Bill replied that it was the first call Brooke had made. Hope guessed that Brooke actually wanted Katie to know how happy Brooke was.\n\n\nBill corrected that he and Brooke were happy, which they had always been until outside forces like Katie's anger, Ridge's whining, and Hope's judgment had gotten in their way. \"But I don't have to explain that to the two of you, do I?\" he knowingly asked.\n\n\nBill said that though Brooke had fought her feelings for him, she'd never denied them, and his feelings for her had never wavered. He knew he wasn't Hope's favorite person, but he hoped that standing by Brooke counted for something. Hope quietly stated that it did. Smiling, Bill said it wasn't congratulations, but he'd take it.\n\n\nHope decided to take off, and Liam walked her out and onto the porch, where she apologized for not being more positive. Hope said that while she'd agreed with Bill that standing by a person meant something, doing so didn't always change things. \"But it means a lot,\" she added.\n\n\nLiam returned inside and noted to Bill that Hope hadn't been acting like herself. Agreeing, Bill replied that Hope hadn't exactly been throwing confetti. Liam was sure that if Bill continued to make Brooke happy then Hope would be happy for Brooke and Bill.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Quinn being in Bill's room when Brooke had shown up the other night. Bill murmured that he'd shoved Quinn into the closet to hide her from Brooke. Liam wondered what Bill had been thinking to discuss his relationship with Brooke while Quinn had been in the room.\n\n\nBill said that Quinn could have blown the whole thing for him, but she hadn't. Liam was certain that if Quinn had kept quiet, it was due to her own agenda. Liam advised his father to be honest with Brooke about Quinn, and Bill asked why he'd do that. Liam said that Ridge had lied about his feelings for Katie, and Liam was sure that Brooke had trust issues stemming from it.\n\n\nBill argued that Quinn had been hiding in his room, and he hadn't even known that she'd been there. To Bill, it hadn't been the same as what Ridge had done. Liam explained that Quinn had dirt on Bill. Bill insisted that Quinn wouldn't out him, and Liam was making a problem out of nothing.\n\n\nLiam advised Bill not be alone when Bill told Quinn about Bill and Brooke. Picking up the phone to call Quinn, Bill replied that he wouldn't be because Liam would also be there.\n\n\n \nIn Rick's office, Quinn and Wyatt worked, and Quinn guessed Wyatt was thinking of Hope. Wyatt said Quinn could mark his happiness off her list of things she wanted in the world. She replied that two out of three things wasn't bad, and she might have underestimated Bill's desire for Brooke.\n\n\nQuinn said that Wyatt had warned her about Bill and Brooke, and Bill wasn't ready to let go. Wyatt remarked that letting go wasn't her style either. Quinn replied that unlike Bill, she had other things on her mind -- like running her company, making jewelry, and being there for her son.\n\n\nQuinn claimed she was too busy to pine for Bill. She hadn't gotten where she was by wasting her time, and she didn't need a man to be excited about her life. Wyatt asked if his mother wanted to share her life with someone. Quinn readily replied that she was sharing it with him, but he stated that he meant someone other than her son. Quinn reasoned that Bill would just get in her way, and she'd never fawn all over Bill the way Katie and Brooke did.\n\n\nQuinn received a phone call from Bill, who asked her to meet him at the cliff house. After the call, Wyatt wondered if she'd underestimated Bill's feelings for her. As Quinn took off to meet Bill, she said she'd stick with not getting her hopes up.\n\n\nAfter Quinn had left, Hope arrived. Wyatt asked if Hope had passed his mother in the corridor, and Hope absently stated that she hadn't seen Quinn.\n\n\nBack at the cliff house, Bill put all of his bags on the sofa and told Liam that he was wrong about Quinn, who worked for Brooke's son. Bill figured that Quinn wouldn't do anything to jeopardize the business relationship at Forrester. Liam replied that they were discussing the woman who'd stabbed Bill in the neck with his sword necklace, hacked Liam's email, and sabotaged Liam's wedding.\n\n\nQuinn waltzed into the house and said she hadn't known Liam would be there. Liam quipped that he lived there. Quinn offered to talk to Bill in the bedroom, and Liam took that as his cue to retreat to his own bedroom. Quinn saw Bill's bags and assumed that Liam was taking a trip. Bill replied that the bags were his, and he'd wanted Quinn to hear it from him that he'd reconciled with Brooke.\n\n\nBill announced that he was moving back in with Brooke, and Quinn guessed that Brooke sharing the vice presidency at Forrester with Ridge had spurred Bill's impatience. He replied that he hadn't asked Quinn there for her opinion; he'd just wanted to inform her of what was happening. He'd also wanted to remind her of their deal for her to keep quiet about what had happened between them.\n\n\nLiam exited his bedroom and announced that he was headed to work. Bill replied that Liam had said he'd hang around, and Liam asked if Bill really needed that. Bill decided that he didn't, and as he left, Liam stated that he'd check on his father later.\n\n\nThe moment Liam was out the door, Quinn suspected that Bill had wanted Liam there because Bill had thought she'd behave like a jilted lover. She said that she was a mature woman and a business owner. While Quinn wasn't thrilled that she could no longer have fun with Bill, she had no plans to reveal to Brooke what Quinn and Bill had done.\n\n\nBill thanked Quinn, but she said he could do better than that. She wanted two things in return for the big favor she was doing for him. First, she wanted one last kiss. She kissed him, and he endured it until she was done. She said that Brooke never had to know about Quinn and Bill if he granted Quinn the second thing she wanted.\n\n\nOut on the porch, Liam searched for his keys. He saw a receipt in the bushes and recalled that something that had fallen out of Hope's purse earlier. He read the receipt, and his face darkened.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, Wyatt wanted to get out of the office because Hope looked like she could use the surprise that he had in store for her. \"Not really, no,\" Hope responded. He said the trailer was packed up, and they could leave right then. Hope seemed unenthused.\n\n\nWyatt noted that Hope was overwhelmed and tried to sell her on the idea of getting away. Hope said that there was something else happening. She reminded him that she'd wanted to take things slowly in their relationship, and she hadn't even wanted to move in with him. \"But now I'm late,\" she said.\n\n\nWyatt asked what Hope was late for, and Hope repeated that she was late. \"Oh...\" he knowingly responded. Hope told him that she thought she might be pregnant. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam can tell that Hope is distracted. But at least she did not say to get lost buddy. She says she would never call him buddy. He says that is hopeful. Bill walks in and says hopeful is good. He will just grab a few things and be on his way. Liam asks if he is moving back in with Brooke as Hope saw his car in the driveway last night. Bill says yes and Brooke is probably looking for Donna and Hope right now to tell them the news. Katie was the first one she called to tell. They had let too much stuff get in their way, but he knows he does not have to tell Liam and Hope that. Hope tells Liam later that she meant what she said to his dad about someone being there for you; it helps. Bill tells Liam that he knows they were talking about Wyatt when he walked in. He hopes there is no problem there. Liam says no; it's just that Hope wasn't much like herself. She hasn't talked to Brooke yet but if Brooke is happy then Hope will be happy. Bill wants to make sure that he did not tell Hope about his uninvited guest. Liam says hell no, but he thought that was over. Bill says it is now, but he had to shove her in the closet when Brooke was here. Quinn could have come out and blown the whole thing, but she didn't, so maybe he was wrong about her. Liam says no, there was a reason she did not but it wasn't to help Bill. And it doesn't matter that nothing happened this time. Now Quinn has dirt on Bill. And if she threatens to tell Brooke, Bill is out of luck. Quinn and Wyatt are looking over the jewelry. He suspects she is thinking of how good it would look on his girlfriend, so let her enjoy it too. He comments that would be one thing off of her list of the three \u0096 happy son, successful business and companion for herself. She says two out of three ain't bad, but she might have underestimated his dad's interest in Brooke. Bill's not ready to let go. She shrugs it off and says her life is full with other things and she is not the kind to get lonely. Wyatt knows Bill will always have a special place in her heart. She says not having a man in her life doesn't diminish anything. Bill might. Look how Brooke and Katie fawned over him. They catered to his every whim. That isn't her, never will be. Bill tells Liam that Quinn is not the one making a big deal out of this; just Liam. He wants it to stop. Brooke went home Quinn went home; all is good. Liam says okay but do him a favor. Do not be alone with Quinn when he tells her. Bill quips that Liam will be there. He's going to call her right now to come over. Bill tells Liam that Quinn won't say anything. She works for Brooke's son at FC so she will not jeopardize that situation. Liam says yes but they are talking about a woman who stabbed him in the neck with his own pendant, hacked into his e-mail and sabotaged his wedding. Bill realizes that but for now he is grateful. Quinn walks in, says she did not know Liam would be here. He says he lives there. Bill asks Liam for a minute to talk to Quinn. She quips they could go upstairs and talk in his bedroom. Liam turns green and says he's got to go. Quinn sees Bill's bags and asks if Liam is hopefully going out of town. Bill says they are his bags and not for the gym. He wanted to tell her first. He and Brooke got together last night and he is moving back in with her. She brings her happy face and says the last time she heard Brooke needed more time. Now that she is sharing co-VP with Ridge, could that have brought this on. Bill says he did not invite her here for her opinion. He just wanted her to know. And to remind her of what she said the other night that she wouldn't say anything to anyone what happened between them. Quinn says please, she is not some jilted lover. She is not happy that he and Brooke are getting back together because it's been a long time since she's had the kind of fun they had lately ..but she is not going to tell Brooke. She says she is doing a really big favor by keeping his secret and she wants two things. She kisses him and says their last kiss. Then he can add that to the long list not to tell Brooke if he will grant her the second wish. Wyatt tells Hope that he has a great idea. They need to get out of here. He had a surprise for her later but it looks like she could use it right now. He says the RV is in the parking lot, it' stocked so they can just go someplace. This will be good for her to get out of the stress of work and Ridge. She agrees she has been under a strain. But she adds there is something else. She treads lightly saying she doesn't want him to misunderstand. She really likes being with him and how close they have become. But she has said it a lot that she did not want to move too fast. She did not want to move in with him or make a big commitment. She wanted to take things slow. Now she is late. She thinks she might be pregnant.",
