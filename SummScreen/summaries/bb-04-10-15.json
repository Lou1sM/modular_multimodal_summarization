    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke felt that Ridge had a big ego, but Ridge was sure Brooke was mad at the world because he wasn't fighting for her. He said his heart just wasn't in it. Brooke laughed, stating that she could have Ridge back \"just like that\" and that she believed he was only with Caroline to irk Rick.\n\n\nRidge stated that he and Brooke had already had the discussion years earlier, but it had been about another Caroline who Brooke had also insisted hadn't been right for him. Brooke said she'd never disparaged Caroline senior, but Caroline junior lacked a conscience. He reasoned that he'd wanted the relationship, so his conscience might be the one lacking.\n\n\nBrooke wished Ridge had said that twenty-five years earlier. Ridge asked if she was saying she regretted being with him. Brooke didn't; however, she wished they'd made better choices because it would have made their family stronger, and she wouldn't feel so alone.\n\n\nRidge didn't want Brooke to see their past as a failure. Brooke asked what was important to him at that time in his life. For her, it was her children, especially Rick. She felt the need to be there for Rick and to protect him. Assuming the protection was from him, Ridge said he didn't think about Rick unless Rick made him do so. She asked if Ridge thought of R.J.\n\n\nRidge asked what Brooke meant. Brooke said she didn't encourage their son to visit from school because she didn't want him to lose respect for his father. She had been waiting for Ridge to introduce Caroline properly to their son but no longer believed it would happen. Brooke predicted that soon, Ridge would tire of Caroline, and he'd move on with his life.\n\n\nRidge claimed that he and Brooke had been practically kids when they'd fallen in love. They'd shared the best of times and worst of times, but they'd seemed to find ways to forgive each other and move on. Brooke suspected that he'd need her soon, but he didn't know it yet.\n\n\nBrooke wondered what Caroline and Ridge talked about. She asked if they discussed his youth and life before smart phones. She wondered if they'd discussed having children or how Caroline wouldn't have his children because he already had two families. Brooke believed Ridge would see that Caroline wasn't schooled enough for him, and he'd have to let go. Brooke believed it would be a sacrifice for Ridge, but it would be much better for Caroline in the long run.\n\n\nBrooke asked what was keeping Caroline in New York. Ridge seemed to struggle to explain why Caroline was away. He said they collaborated on designs via email. Caroline was spending time with her mothers, and Dani was publishing a book.\n\n\nBrooke decided to go but said she'd run interference with Rick if Ridge wanted it. Ridge quipped that it would be a new thing for her. Ridge decided that Brooke was right; he and Caroline didn't know everything about each other, and they might not have children together. Ridge conveyed that Caroline knew the Ridge he was that day, not the Ridge of twenty-five years past. He added that people did their best work when left alone, and he asked Brooke to try it for old time's sake.\n\n\nIn the studio, Aly grimaced with embarrassment, watching Nicole bounce and dance instead of posing for Oliver's camera. Oliver cut off the music and said modeling and dancing were different. Carter entered to see why he'd heard loud music in the hallway. Oliver and Aly started to explain what Rick and Maya had told them to do, but seeing Nicole, Carter said it had become clear to him.\n\n\nOliver resumed the music, and Nicole continued to dance before the camera. She wondered if her photos would be in magazines and was disappointed when Oliver said they were just test shots. He added that she might get to be a fit model or do online work, but Nicole frowned. She tripped and worried that she'd ripped her dress. Oliver asked her to change into a new outfit.\n\n\nAly stated that they had work to do, and Carter murmured that it paid to have Maya's support. Everyone reviewed Nicole's photos and rendered skeptical looks when Nicole cooed about how well she'd done. Aly and Oliver left, and Carter asked Nicole to get out of the modeling clothes because they weren't hers. Nicole snapped that she wasn't a thief, but he quipped that she was sure squeezing Maya.\n\n\nNicole claimed to be trying to get Maya to treat Nicole like family. Carter stated that, to Nicole, it meant living in a mansion and placing herself ahead of experienced models. Nicole said most sisters got along normally, but Maya wanted to run away from hers. Nicole asked what she'd done to deserve it.\n\n\nCarter replied that Maya was scared, but Nicole disagreed. Nicole said Maya felt that Rick would understand it in time. Nicole doubted Maya believed it and asked if Carter did. Carter didn't know what Rick would do, but Carter felt that Maya had lied to him. Carter had wanted to tell Rick, who deserved to know, but Carter hadn't been able to after looking into Maya's eyes.\n\n\nCarter guessed there was a reason Maya hadn't divulged the information to him when they'd been together. He said he might not have made things easier for her, and he might have pushed her while she'd been rebounding from Rick. Nicole stated that Maya had been more wrong than Carter, and Maya had done the same with Nicole.\n\n\nNicole said she'd been little, and she'd thought Maya hadn't wanted anything to do with her. Carter reasoned that sometimes, while trying to survive, people forgot how to love others. \"Wouldn't you agree?\" he asked.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Maya and Rick kissed. Maya had driven Nicole to Forrester that morning, and it had interrupted Maya's normal routine. Maya claimed it was okay, and she could do her regimes at any time. Oliver called Rick to discuss Nicole's shoot, and Maya slipped off to take some pills from a bottle that had been tucked away in her purse.\n\n\nLater, Rick was frustrated that Ridge hadn't made the design changes Rick had asked for. Maya complimented Ridge's work on the neckline, and Rick asked if he should let Ridge challenge Rick's authority. Maya said that Ridge needed his little rebellions and suggested that Rick agree to a mock-up design to see how the design looked.\n\n\nRick got a phone call and snapped at the person on the other end. After the call, he apologized for the interruptions. Maya apologized for telling him how to handle Ridge. Rick said she didn't need to do that. He wanted to hear everything she had to say without her holding anything back, including hearing about her hopes, fears, and dreams. She agreed not to hold things back.\n\n\nMaya asked for Brooke's birth date and clothing size. She wanted to do something nice for Brooke, who'd been beautiful and accepting. Rick said Brooke knew what Maya meant to and did for Rick. Maya conveyed that she'd never thought she'd be that happy. Rick kissed her. Her purse tumbled to the floor, exposing the pill bottle.\n\n\nMaya remarked that she was happy that things were improving between Caroline and Rick. Rick recalled how he hadn't been able to eat, sleep, or read a report after he'd learned about Ridge and Caroline. Rick didn't want Maya to pity him. He figured Caroline had kept things from him because she'd believed that her husband had been a wounded bird.\n\n\nMaya said that if she ever had a husband, she'd want him to know all of her and everything about her. Rick said the husband would know what a lucky man he was. He told her he loved her.\n\n\nMaya decided to take off, but she couldn't find her purse. Rick spotted it on the floor and picked it up. He also picked up the pill bottle and was surprised that the prescription was for conjugated estrogen. He asked why Maya needed to take it.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Ridge that ego is a terrible monster. He knows she is here because she hates being alone. She is mad at him and at Caroline because he is not pining away for Brooke and she can not stand it. She states that is laughable as she could have Ridge if she wanted him just like that \u0096 she snaps her fingers as she is famous for doing so often. Ridge says they have had this conversation before with the Aunt Caroline. Brooke says they have had some great times and she does not regret any of them. She just wishes their family could be stronger now and she would not be so alone. She does not think Ridge takes Caroline seriously. He will move on with his life someday. And that is one reason she does not encourage RJ to come home to see his father and see him in that relationship and be disillusioned. Nicole is energetic and models but Oliver has to tell her to slow it down some. Modeling is different than just dancing around. Carter walks in and says no need to explain, he knows Maya and Rick okayed this. Carter snarls that it sure pays to have Maya behind you these days. Nicole takes a break when a dress rips a bit. Aly says she sure isn't shy before the camera. Nicole is delighted to see the results and thanks Oliver and Aly for being so sweet. Carter tells Nicole she will have to get out of those clothes as they do not belong to her. She snaps back that she is not a thief. Rick tells Maya that he wants to hear all her hopes and fears and never hold anything back. She promises she won't. Ridge says they were not much more than children when they fell in love. They had the best of times but the worst of times. They always found a way to forgive each other and move on. She says she suspects they will find that again. She thinks it will be a huge sacrifice for Ridge to let Caroline go, but sooner or later he will find things about her that he does not like. She may be greedy or needy or not give him children if he even wants more children since he has two families already. Maya tells Rick that his mother was so sweet and accepting of her today and she'd like to do something, buy her something to thank her. She knocks over her purse as she sits on the desk. A pill bottle falls out. Carter blasts to Nicole that Maya lied to him and now she is lying to Rick and he deserves to know. But perhaps he pushed as he knew she was on the rebound from Rick the first time. Brooke tells Ridge that she is back at work full time at Rick's instance. She wonders what is keeping Caroline in New York for so long. She tells him to say hi to her when he hears from her. He makes it clear that neither he nor Caroline know each other's favorites. But that is better than remembering twenty five years ago. They work best when left alone so maybe Brooke can do that right now. Rick tells Maya not to feel sorry for him. She thinks maybe that is how Caroline felt. He says he loves Maya and what a lucky man he is. As Maya is leaving, Rick reaches down and picks up the pill bottle and asks what she is doing with estrogen pills.",
