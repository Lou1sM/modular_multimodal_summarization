Judging by his behavior, he also can see that Mass hasn't let go of the Deacon affair. Mass tells him he had nothing to do with Jacqueline's arrest and he will have nothing to do with her release, unless Dominick changes his tone. He starts spouting about dynasty's and empires and legacy, which are destroyed not from the outside but from within. He tells Dominick he must respect his brother's life. Nick vows he will not leave Brooke. And he will not be blackmailed. And if he doesn't help him get his mother out of jail, Mass will only have one son to carry on his precious Marone legacy. Ridge, Thorne and Darla and Kimberly look into the living room and comment on how creepy it is; almost like a shrine. They really need to talk to their mother about accepting it and letting Felicia go. Felicia is escorted home though Eric wonders if maybe she shouldn't have stayed at the clinic. She won't hear of it; she wants to be with her family. Eric brings up Jacqueline, but Stephanie says this is not the time nor place for that or for him to explain about the marriage proposal. Jacqueline paces back and forth in her cell thinking about these trumped up charges. Felicia hands her mother a pair of scissors and tells her to cut off her hair, all of it. And Dr. Ramirez is delighted that she wants to donate her hair to the sick children going through chemo. Stephanie tries to prepare the others about Felicia, but it's still a shock when she is wheeled into the room. They all rush to accept her home.",
