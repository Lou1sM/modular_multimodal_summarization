    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, a flashback had the voice of the original Sally Spectra on the microphone rallying her team. Saul, grandson of the original Saul, was cleaning the microphone. Sally entered and was despondent, but Saul tried to cheer her by telling her that he had remembered his grandfather's tales about how the original Sally had used the microphone to pump up the team in tough times. \"I fixed it for you,\" Saul said. Sally half-heartedly thanked him.\n\n\nLater, Coco greeted Sally and Saul. She had heard about the upcoming fashion show at Spectra. She congratulated Sally for refusing to give up on her dreams, even after Jarrett's review.\n\n\nShirley entered and said everything was in working order in the showroom. A sketch of a dress was visible on a nearby desk, and Coco asked to see it, but Saul snatched it away before Coco could get a look at it. Coco said she understood. \"It's because I am working at Forrester,\" she said. Sally confirmed that Darlita had sent out all the invitations, and Shirley asked Darlita to check on RSVPs.\n\n\nCoco was sure the company would bounce back. Shirley agreed and reminded Coco to get the brooch back because it was an important family piece. Coco nodded and left.\n\n\nA model entered in a stunning red gown, and Saul said the design needed some finishing touches. Sally couldn't believe the workmanship. A piece of material fell off, and Saul reiterated that it needed finishing touches. Shirley reminded him that it was not Forrester quality and didn't have the Forrester price tag either.\n\n\nSally was amazed at the gorgeous gown and asked to see the design. Saul handed her the design, and she could see Thomas Forrester's initials on it. Sally shook her head that they were stealing directly from Thomas -- not even from his grandfather or father. It was Thomas' design. Shirley warned Sally to get Thomas out of her head. Sally admitted she had fallen in love with Thomas. Shirley advised her to stop caring about him. Sally countered that Coco would never speak to them again because of how they had used her.\n\n\nShirley disagreed and said that Coco would be angry but would get over it. The company was more important. \"You're Sally Spectra -- this is our one chance,\" she said. She encouraged Sally not to back down. \"We are doing this,\" Shirley said.\n\n\nSally wondered if they could delay it -- postpone the fashion show until after Forrester had their show. Shirley argued that the idea was to beat them to the punch. The original Sally Spectra had always tried to beat the Forresters by a week. Sally felt guilty about bootlegging Thomas' designs.\n\n\nShirley reminded Sally that her boyfriend was a baby daddy to a socialite, and that was the way things happened. \"Sally, you need to come down off that high horse and realize who you are,\" Shirley said.\n\n\nShirley reminded Sally that she was unsophisticated and poor and would never be part of Thomas' world. \"Thank God you didn't sleep with him,\" Shirley said. Sally looked away sadly. Shirley apologized but said somebody \"had to tell it to you straight.\" Thomas would soon return to his socialite baby mama, and that was where he belonged. \"You need to face it and put it in the past. Forget about Thomas Forrester,\" Shirley said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Thomas discussed that Thomas had been distracted by Sally. Steffy suggested that Thomas meet some other women. Thomas said he had been serious about Sally, but he said it was over. \"She broke it off with me,\" he said. He added that she had been blindsided when she'd found out about Douglas and Caroline. Steffy thought he would have told her, but Thomas said he had not. \"So she broke up with you because you have a kid? Classy,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nRidge entered and said the designs Thomas had delivered were the most exciting he had seen in years. They beat Ridge's and Eric's. He pointed to three of his favorite designs, all Thomas Forrester originals.\n\n\nThomas thanked Ridge, and Ridge said he was sorry things hadn't worked out with Sally. However, Ridge was proud of Thomas. He said the new line was the greatest line ever. \"Wow, Dad, that's a really big compliment,\" Thomas said. Ridge said he was sincere. The company had weathered a storm. \"Wait 'til the world gets a load of this,\" he said.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill and Wyatt discussed that Bill was giving Brooke some space, but he knew they would get back together. In the meantime, he had a business to run and an expansion project. Jarrett interrupted, and Bill told him he was nuts to interrupt. Jarret was insistent. \"Wyatt, if you don't mind,\" Jarrett said. Jarrett explained that he had received a very classy invitation that would be of interest to Bill. It was a fashion show invitation. He handed it to Bill, and Bill admitted it was impressive.\n\n\nJarrett said it was from Spectra, and he reminded Bill that Bill had written a review that had completely trashed \"that poor girl and her company.\" Wyatt was amazed that Bill had written it. Jarrett agreed that he had refused.\n\n\nBill countered that he wanted the building. Jarrett and Wyatt joked that Bill wanted mirrors because he liked mirrors. \"I do,\" Bill admitted. Jarrett said he wanted to let Bill know that Spectra had gotten the attention of the fashion world, and Jarrett would not be the only writer in attendance. \"I am here to tell you I will be writing an honest review,\" Jarrett said.\n\n\nBill scoffed that Jarrett had been \"puffing out your chest.\" Jarrett countered that other writers would notice Sally's talent. He expected a full crowd at the showing. Bill chastised Jarrett for undermining his efforts to build a monument of high-end car dealers, bowling alleys, and a food market.\n\n\nBill insisted that Jarrett had to write a scathing review because he wanted Sally to close up so C.J. could sell him \"that pile of rubble.\"\n\n\nBill reminded Jarrett that he worked for Spencer Publications, and Bill owned Jarrett Maxwell, the building, and everything in it. Jarrett left.\n\n\nWyatt pulled up information on Sally on his tablet. He said Sally was hot. Bill was happy that Wyatt had noticed and might be getting over Steffy. Bill added that Sally had been at the wedding as Thomas' date. She had seemed genuine.\n\n\nBill wondered how Sally was getting money because her loan shark wasn't giving her any more money. \"Sally Spectra designs can't compete with the Forresters,\" Bill announced.\n\n\nBill advised Wyatt to stay away from Sally Spectra because he planned to send her packing. Wyatt wondered if she was capable of the kind of espionage the Spectras had used in the old days. Bill doubted that anyone could mess with Forrester security. \"Not many people could pull that off,\" he said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Thomas recalled spending time with Sally in Australia. He flashed back to jumping in the water with her and kissing her. He also recalled her words when she had dumped him.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally also flashed back to kissing Thomas. She shook it off and grabbed the newly fixed microphone. \"Attention, please. All hands on deck. Grams, Saul, Darlita -- get in here,\" she said. The entire team and some additional workers crowded into her office. She reminded everyone that she had promised her Great-Aunt Sally that she would resurrect Spectra and \"that's exactly what we are going to do.\"\n\n\nSally promised the \"best damned fashion show.\" She wanted everyone to give it their all. The show had to sizzle. \"Mark my words -- this ragtag pirate ship is heading straight for the stars,\" she said.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Bill is furious to learn that Spectra Fashions is having another fashion show and that reporter Jarrett refuses to write a scathing review that will ruin their company. Bill then updates Wyatt, who does some research on wannabe fashion diva Sally, on his big plans to build one of Los Angeles' most stunning skyscrapers. Steffy is relieved while Thomas is crushed that Sally ended their romance before it properly took off. Ridge presents his newest designs to Steffy and Thomas not realizing that Spectra is replicating the same designs for their fashion show after getting more than a glimpse of it the day prior. Saul and Darlita do their best to prevent Coco from seeing their new collection, knowing that she would realize that they are stolen designs from Forrester Creations. Sally is miserable about dumping Thomas. Drilled by her grandmother Shirley to make business her priority, Sally later swears her troops in on the fashion show which will decide about the company's fate.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Thomas that he is one of the most eligible bachelors and he needs to get over Sally and move on. He informs her that he has. Sally broke up with him. In front of Wyatt, Jarrett tells Bill this time he will write an honest review for Sally. Bill rants that he better remember who signs his paychecks. He wants that location and not to turn it into another bowling alley. So he has two choices, write a scathing piece or get into the unemployment line. Spectra Fashions is a joke. The loan sharks should be stepping in now. Not on their best day can they compete with the Forrester's. Ridge tells Thomas he appreciates his efforts for this fashion showing despite his involvement in the past with Sally. Saul is quick to grab a picture of a design out of the way before Coco sees it. Shirley tells her to be sure and get the brooch back as it is a favorite family piece. Saul shows Sally some gowns they will have ready for the preview. They do not have the quality that Forrester has but Shirley reminds them it does not have the price tag either. Sally sees the Forrester logo on the sketch design and says she cannot betray Thomas this way. Shirley retorts that this is their one shot so grab that bull by the horns right now. Bill tells Jarrett to cry him a river, Mr. Principle, go back to his cubicle and call his mommy. He tells Wyatt that he is glad he is over Steffy but do not look Sally's way. She won't be around that long. She is just a red-headed wannabee, that's all. Shirley says timing is everything. That is why they are showing their fashions this week before the Forrester's do. She tells Sally she is a very pretty girl from the boondocks but she will never be part of Thomas's world so climb down from that high horse. Somebody has to tell it to her straight. Thomas will go back to his baby momma, so forget him. But Sally can't. Bill confides to Wyatt that perhaps Sally will do better but he thinks she is setting herself up for another failure. Unless she is ripping off designs from FC and they are pretty tight around the office so he doesn't see how that could happen. Sally calls all the crew together and says they can shout it from the rooftop that their fashion show will show all what they can do ..these designs are HOT. Spectra Fashions is born again! Shirley says she is so proud of her. But all Sally can think of is Thomas.",
