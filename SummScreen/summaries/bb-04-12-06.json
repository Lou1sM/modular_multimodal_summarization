Brooke does not understand why Massimo would not help Jackie.  Nick explains that Massimo does not like him being with Brooke and he does not like what Jackie did to him in the past.  He tells Brooke that he thinks Massimo set Jackie up.  Brooke is incredulous.  Nick tells her Massimo is using the situation as leverage.  Nick explains that Massimo tried to make a deal with him.  He tells Brooke that Massimo will get Jackie out of jail if he ends his relationship with her.  Brooke angrily replies that she will not let Massimo come between them.  Nick kisses her and says it will not happen.  While they are kissing passionately, the phone rings and it's the attorney informing him that Jackie's hearing is set for tomorrow.  Brooke asks how Jackie is doing.  Nick says the attorney did not know because he was not allowed in to see Jackie.  Nick does not understand why.  Brooke assures him that they will get Jackie out of jail without Massimo's help.  Nick feels helpless and cannot stand the thought of his mother spending the night in jail. Brooke tells Nick he has always been her rock and now she wants to be his.  She says she loves him and will stand by him.  They kiss.\n\n\nMeanwhile at the Forresters', the family gathers around Felicia.  Ridge still cannot believe she is alive. Now he finally understands why Stephanie tried to keep the family from having a memorial service.  Felicia jokes that she wishes she could have been at her memorial. Thorne leads the family in a toast to Felicia.   While everyone is toasting, Bridget arrives with Dominick and Dante.   Felicia asks for Dominick and Bridget places him in her arms.  Felicia's doctor, Christian tells her it is time for her to go back to the guesthouse and get some rest.  Felicia agrees to leave as long as she can take Dominick with her.  Dante tells her he will go get Dino's stuff out of the car.  Felicia looks puzzled.  Dante informs her that Dominick's nickname is Dino.  Felicia says Dino is a great name for a dinosaur or a lounge singer partial to martinis. Everyone laughs except Bridget and Dante.  Felicia unconvincingly assures them that she thinks Dino is a cute name.  Everyone tells Felicia how glad they are that she is alive.  Ridge says Dominick is especially happy because he has his mommy back.  Bridget looks concerned.\n\n\nAt the guesthouse, Christian sets Felicia's room up with hospital equipment as she lies in the bed holding Dominick.  Felicia tells the doctor, Bridget and Dante- that the love you get from a child is the best medicine.  Christian tells her it is going to take a lot more than love to get her health back. Felicia assures him she will do what every it takes.  Christian tells her she will have a nurse to help.  Felicia adds flirtatiously that she will also have a very dedicated doctor out on the couch.  Bridget tells Felicia she will be visiting often.  Felicia says she and Dominick will enjoy seeing her.  Dante looks worried.  As Christian checks Felicia's vitals, Bridget clings to Dominick.  Dante notices that Felicia already has a crib set up.  Felicia asks to hold the baby again and Bridget reluctantly gives him back.  Felicia tells Dominick there is no way she could die because that would have meant saying bye to him.  After Bridget and Dante have left Felicia's room, Christian tells her it was very hard for Bridget to leave the baby.  Felicia realizes letting go of Dominick; it is going to be hard for her sister. Outside of the guesthouse, Dante attempts to cheer Bridget up.  She bravely dries her eyes and tells him she will be ok.  She is thrilled that Felicia is alive it is just hard for her to lose Dominick since she has grown so close to him.  She sadly watches through the window as Felicia and Dominick bond. \n\n\nBack at the Forresters', Stephanie tries to explain why she kept quiet about Felicia.  She tells them Felicia's chances for survival were so slim she did not want to put the family through it again.  Everyone understands.  Kristen wonders where Eric is. Stephanie says he is visiting Jackie at the Federal Courthouse.  She explains that Jackie was arrested for money laundering and tax fraud.  Ridge is surprised to hear the news but thinks Eric's place is with the family.  Stephanie thinks Eric feels a sense of obligation to Jackie since he has asked her to marry him. The family is shocked to learn that Eric is engaged to Jackie. Stephanie tells them Eric only married her to grant Felicia's dying wish. Everyone wonders what Eric will do now that Felicia is alive. \n\n\nAt the Federal Courthouse, Eric comes to visit a distraught Jackie.  He tells her he came as soon as he could. She thinks he came to get his engagement ring.  Eric says he came because he wanted to help.  Jackie runs into his arms crying and thanking him.  Eric tells her he understands if she is upset with him.  Jackie says she is just having an unlucky week and begs him not to apologize again about Felicia being alive.  She cannot believe that he would think she is not happy that Felicia is alive.  She is just upset that he does not really love her.  Eric says that he does love her.  She does not believe him and thinks he loves Stephanie.  Eric does not deny his feelings for his wife.  Jackie says it does not matter anyway since she could be spending the next 25 years in jail.  Eric promises Jackie that he will stand by her and get her out of jail.  He tells her he will not let this arrest sully her reputation and that he has his P.R. people working on damage control.  She thanks him and falls into his arms crying.  After Eric leaves, Jackie is taken back to her cell where Massimo is waiting for her.  She is relieved to see him until she realizes he may not be there to help.  He tells her she let him down in the past when he needed her support.  Jackie does not understand what he is talking about.  He explains that he is very disappointed that she supports Nick and Brooke's relationship.  Jackie thinks this is the wrong time to be discussing Nick's love life.  Massimo gives Jackie an ultimatum.  He says he will help Jackie only if she can convince Nick to dump Brooke.  He leaves saying he will give her a night to think it over.\n\n \n\n\n",

She confesses to Dante that she's afraid. She needs Dino almost as much as Felicia does. Eric visits Jackie in her jail cell and she is resentful but very grateful he came. However, she realizes he is with Stephanie because he loves her. He vows he will not let this sully her reputation, personally or professionally.

She greets him as an ally, so glad he's there so he can help her, she's innocent. Doesn't take her long to figure his angle. He wanted something from Nick which wasn't forthcoming, so she must suffer for something she didn't do. It's as simple as that, he wants something from her and she wants something from him.
