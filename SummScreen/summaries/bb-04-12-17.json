Saul presented a few details to her attention, and he hoped Sally was pleased. He was very excited because after the fashion show, they would be in the money. Sally told Saul that she needed to get some air, and she left.\n\n\nIn the office, Shirley coached Darlita on how to plan the seating arrangements for the fashion show. Saul lamented to Shirley that they were on the brink of success, yet Sally was very unhappy. Saul said that Sally was broken up about losing Thomas. Shirley stated that it had been a preventable problem, and it was Sally's own fault. Shirley stated that when someone whined about a preventable problem and people said, \"Bless your heart,\" then that person just went on about their business.\n\n\nSaul said that Sally hadn't been whining -- she was just sad. He knew that Coco would be, as well, when Thomas' little brother figured out how Spectra had gotten their designs and Coco discovered that Spectra had stolen Forrester's designs.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Thomas made a few adjustments to his latest creation. He recalled his time in Australia with Sally and the wonderful time they'd spent together. Steffy arrived and admired Thomas' work. She admitted that he was an excellent designer. Steffy realized that Thomas was still down about his breakup with Sally and offered to get him a latte.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Thomas told R.J. that Sally had broken things off with him. R.J. wanted to know if Sally had given him any reason. Thomas admitted that Sally's reason had been the usual -- that they were from two different worlds. R.J. suggested that perhaps Sally had been having a bad day. Thomas explained that Sally was volatile, and things were bigger and better or bigger and worse. Thomas confessed that he'd reached out to Sally, but she hadn't returned his calls. Thomas told R.J. that he wasn't going to leave it that way. Thomas showed R.J. the gift he had for Sally.\n\n\nIn the design office, Maya told Coco she was surprised that Spectra had planned a fashion show. Coco admitted that it had surprised her as well. Coco confessed that she hadn't seen any of the designs. Maya found that strange, but Nicole guessed that if was probably because Coco worked at Forrester Creations, and it would have put Coco into a difficult position. After Coco left, Nicole assured Maya that Coco was a good person, but Maya still thought it strange the Coco hadn't been privy to Spectra's designs. Nicole assured Maya that Coco wasn't an evil mastermind.\n\n\nR.J. and Coco worked on the plans for the Forrester fashion show. Coco told R.J. that people were still unsure about her. R.J. reassured her that he'd always have her back. He then mentioned that Sally had broken up with Thomas. Coco was surprised because she hadn't known about the breakup. Coco was concerned what that meant for the Forresters and Spectra. R.J. and Coco kissed. Coco told R.J. that he was going to get her fired. R.J. reiterated that he'd always take care of her.\n\n\nAt Giardino's, Sally saw Steffy seated at a table and approached her. Steffy looked over at the dessert table and saw a cake. Sally assured her it was going to be a low carb conversation. Sally wanted to apologize, and Steffy offered to treat Sally to lunch. Steffy asked if Sally intended to throw food at Steffy. Sally chortled and promised she wouldn't.\n\n\nSally said she wasn't there for a photo op, but to apologize because Sally knew she'd gotten under Steffy's skin. Steffy agreed that Sally had, but smiled and mentioned how she'd put Sally's face in a cake. Sally admitted that Steffy had more class and sophistication than Sally ever would.\n\n\nSteffy admitted that it hadn't been her first food fight. Sally was surprised and asked who had won the first one. Steffy revealed it had been the dry cleaners. Sally stated she knew Steffy hated her for attending Steffy's wedding. Steffy admitted it had been as much Thomas' fault as Sally's. Steffy stated that there had always been sibling rivalry, and they always wanted to one up each other. Sally said that Thomas adored Steffy. Steffy mentioned that Thomas was head over heels about Sally.\n\n\nSally said that Thomas didn't really know her. Steffy knew that Sally had broken it off with Thomas, and he'd never know why. Sally admitted she wasn't like Steffy and that in Sydney, she'd forgotten everything. She'd felt like an aristocrat on the lawn of the Opera House then with the Champagne, the views, and the witty conversation. Everything the Forresters did involved maintaining quality. Sally admitted that coming back to earth had been a really long fall for her.\n\n\nSteffy said it had been a celebration. They'd been on a different continent, and they'd all had to come back down to earth. Steffy wondered if that was the reason Sally had ended it with Thomas -- it didn't make sense to her. Sally said it would soon enough. Sally needed to leave, and Steffy understood how crazy things got the day before a show. Steffy asked if Sally felt good about the show. Sally admitted that they had put everything they had into it. Steffy wished her luck and said they'd do great.\n\n\nSally asked why Steffy wasn't ready for Sally to fail. Steffy admitted that she wasn't mad at Sally, and they weren't after the same market share. A win for a fashion house was a win for all of them. Sally asked if Steffy's parents had taught her that or if she was self-taught.\n\n\nSally explained that she had always believed that manners were about all the right words -- please, thank you, I beg your pardon -- but Steffy had shown her that they had to be heartfelt, natural, and real. Sally wished they could have been friends. Steffy noted that stranger things had happened. Sally admitted it had been nice chatting with Steffy. She asked Steffy to always remember that about her and left.\n\n\nLater, Saul was on the phone, demanding that the dresses be in the Spectra office in the morning. Thomas arrived, and Saul panicked when he saw Shirley was about to enter with the knockoff designs on a rack. Saul hustled Thomas into Sally's office and yelled that Thomas had no business being there because Sally didn't want anything to do with him. Saul stated very bluntly that Sally deserved someone permanent and better than Thomas. Thomas smirked and asked if Sally needed a skinny dude with a tape measure around his neck, who had a crush on his boss.\n\n\nBefore Thomas left, he asked Saul to give Sally his gift. As Thomas left Sally's office, he saw a rack of dresses that had been covered. When he tried to peek, Shirley stopped him. Thomas smiled and left.\n\n\nIn Sally's office, Saul ripped open Thomas' love note and read it. He then opened the gift and found a replica of the Sydney Opera House. In anger, Saul threw it into the trash. Shirley entered the office and noted that Saul appeared guilt-ridden. He claimed to be a terrible person. Shirley felt that Sally needed to get her head together and stated that it was either Spectra Fashions or Thomas.\n\n\nIn the meantime, as Thomas exited the building, he and Sally bumped into each other. Sally asked why he was at Spectra when things between them were over. Sally claimed they'd never had a chance. Sally told him that he'd find out the type of person she was very soon. Thomas said he loved her, and he kissed her. At first, Sally returned the kiss, but she suddenly broke away and told Thomas to leave her alone. After Thomas left, Sally tore off the Spectra sign and threw it on the ground in a fit of anger.\n\n\n",

Saul laments to Shirley that Sally seems so sad, and Coco will be too when she realizes they stole Forrester designs. Maya and Nicole have a difference of opinion as to whether Coco can be trusted.

    "tvmega_recap": "At Spectra, everyone is backstage setting things up for the fashion show. Sally is disrupted in her thoughts about Thomas. She needs to go get some air. Shirley asks Saul what is the matter. He replies that here they are on the brink of success yet Sally is so sad. And it will be worse when her little sister figures out how they got the designs. Maya gives Coco her brooch back and says it suits Coco but thanks for the loan of it for the day. Sally ends up at the outdoor restaurant where Steffy is having coffee and calls her Princess. She wants to apologize. She knows she got under her skin at her wedding. Steffy says they are even, she pushed her face into the cake earlier. And Australia was as much Thomas's fault as hers. And now Sally has broken it off with him and he will never know why. Sally says she finally came back down to earth. Steffy wishes her luck on the show tomorrow. Maya tells Nicole that she is going to be like Nicole. She is going to be nicer to Coco. Sometimes it really is what it is, people are nice just for being nice so she shouldn't be so suspicious. Thomas shows up at Spectra and Saul blocks him at the door and says he is not welcome here. Before Shirley comes in, Saul pulls Thomas out of the room so he does not see the gowns. Saul is blunt but says Sally is not interested in him. She's interested in something real. Thomas says to tell her that he stopped by and wishes her well tomorrow. When he is gone, Saul tears open the gift he left and reads the card. Thomas says he really needs to talk to her so please call. He loves her. Saul has second thoughts after he throws it all in the trash. Sally runs into Thomas as he is leaving. He kisses her and says he has never met anyone like her. But she pulls away and says she cannot do this; just go.",
