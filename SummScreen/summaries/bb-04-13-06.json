Ridge walks in and spots Brooke and Nick together and starts to walk over to them when Massimo calls him away.  Massimo tells Ridge that he needs to leave before he causes a scene.  Ridge warns him that he better get the matter settled between Brooke and Nick or he will take matters into his own hands.\n\n\nJackie is brought in and Massimo quietly asks her if she has made up her mind to help break up Nick and Brooke.  Massimo reminds her that Ridge has set his sights on Brooke, because she belongs with him, and not Nick.  Jackie looks at Massimo and says, \"NEVER,\" and walks away from him.  The hearing is in the judges chambers, although still under the law, and the hearing proceeds.  The charges against Jackie are read aloud.  The DA accesses that the information was obtained off of Jackie's personal computer.  Massimo speaks up, and alleges that he will pay whatever bail is necessary for her.  The DA asserts that she is a flight risk, and demands that bail should be denied.  At that point, things get out of hand in the chambers.  Massimo tells the judge to set bail as high as he wants, he won't let his son's Mother remain in jail for another night.  The DA then, offers more evidence as far as why she should not receive bail.  Jackie M, owned by Jackie, has boutiques in other countries, places where she has bisited before.  She has access to them and to leaving the country on business trips.  The DA brings up the fact that she was given ownership of the boutiques when she and Massimo divorced, so no matter what good intentions he has, he doesn't know what she has done behind his back, now that she is sole owner of the boutiques.  The Judge allowed Massimo to speak on behalf of Jackie but now he has to answer questions from the DA.  It is brought out that she, was having an affair, behind Massimo's back, while he was an invalid.  The man flaunted the fact before Massimo while he was incapacitated.  The DA thinks that due to all these factors, she can't be trusted and that she should be held in federal custody until the completion of the trial.  Jackie stands up and begs the Judge not to return her to her cell.\n\n\nFelicia thanks Christian for everything that he has done.  He tells her that she is the best patient that he has ever had.  She is grateful for every single moment that she has with her son.  Christian brings up the subject of Bridget.  He comments that she has become equally as attached to \"Dino\" as Felicia would have wanted.  Felicia tells Christian about Bridget and the loss of her baby, Nicole, and how she was supposed to raise her child until this miracle happened.  This being said, the phone rings and it is Bridget calling to see about coming over.  After the phone call, Felicia tells Christian that her \"mohawk\" was fun, but since her hair is still going to fall out, she tells Christian to do away with the remainder of it.  She hands him a pair of clippers and lets him remove the rest, as she sits quietly crying while he does so.  When he is done, he tells her that she looks beautiful.  He leans down and the two of them kiss.  She comments that he has quite a bedside manner.  Bridget and Dante arrive.  They engage in small talk about \"Dino\" and Bridget says that there will have to be more visits between Felicia and her son.  At that point, Felicia questions the word \"visits\" as she expects her son to live with her from now on.\n\n\n",

Eric comes to the court to support Jackie. As the bail hearing commences Jackie meets her lawyer but he doesn't seem too possitive about her release.

    "yt": "\n\nJackie\u2019s hearing begins and she is denied bail. The prosecutor asks Massimo some questions that lead to Massimo divulging Jackie\u2019s affair with Deacon.  The prosecutor makes the case that Jackie broke a promise to Massimo and that makes her a flight risk.  Jackie makes a final plea to post bail.  Bridget tells Dante she doesn\u2019t want to lose Dino. Dante then tells her that he has a surprise for her.  Dante wants to take Bridget on a European trip to meet his family.

    "tvmega_recap": "Nick paces the halls outside of Jackie's bail hearing. Brooke tells him everything will be all right and Jackie will be released today. First thing Ridge sees when he gets off the elevator is Brooke and Nick huddled chest to chest. He tells Massimo he thought he was going to do something about THAT. He declares he is. Obviously not fast enough for Ridge. Mass rebukes him that Jacqueline has brought enough shame to the family; he's not going to have brother against brother fighting at the courthouse. He dismisses Ridge to leave it to him; he'll call him soon. Ridge declares either this gets settled soon or he'll handle it his way. Jackie is led in and Massimo manages to talk to her as they both spy the lovebirds being not that discreet in public. He warns her this must stop. And she proposes he is treating Brooke like she is a piece of property. And she vows that she will never stand between her son and Brooke. Bridget tells Dante she hopes people don't think she is being uncaring or insensitive, but she misses Dino so much. Dante says that Felicia chose them to be the parents and that is exactly what they are going to do. Felicia flirts with her Doctor Ramirez and he tells her she is the best patient he has ever had. He tells her he is pretty good with razors himself and he'd be happy to be her stylist if she needs more assistance. Jackie meets her attorney, Mr. McCoy, first time in court which is held in the Judge's chambers. Charges are read of which Jackie claims all are false. Mass comes forward with the grand gesture that because she is the mother of his son he'd like to post bail, no matter how high it is. The prosecutor calls her a flight risk and asks that bail be denied. Everyone starts talking at once and chaos ensues. Felicia lets the Doc shear her head and he tells her she looks beautiful. They share a sweet kiss. Massimo demands again that the court set bail as high as they want and he will be responsible for it, but he will not stand by one more night and watch Jackie spend the night in jail. Bridget and Dante come to take Dino home and they're stunned when Felicia announces this is where he's living now. Mass seems to pull his attention aside when Jackie's sordid past with criminal, Deacon Sharpe, is mentioned at the hearing. Jackie resorts to standing and begging the court not to deny her bail; she won't go anywhere.",
