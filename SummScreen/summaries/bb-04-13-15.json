    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick read the pill bottle. It had Maya's name on it. He asked why she was taking conjugated estrogen. Rick assumed the drug was for older women with bone or menopausal issues. Taking the pills, she said it was complicated. Rick implored her to tell him if she was sick.\n\n\nMaya told Rick that she needed estrogen because \"it helps regulate me.\" Embarrassed, Rick decided to mind his own business and stop snooping. Maya said he'd been concerned and sweet. She just hadn't known how much a man wanted to know \"about all that.\"\n\n\nRick relayed that he was with the woman he wanted to share his life with, and the medication had scared him. Maya said she should have explained right away, but she didn't think about the pills, which were a part of her daily routine. He felt bad for grilling her, but she claimed to just melt when her sexy CEO gave her the third degree. They kissed, and Maya smiled.\n\n\nRick was glad to see Maya's smile again. It helped get him through the day. Again, he said the pills had made him believe that something was wrong. Her smile faded, and he asked what was wrong.\n\n\nMaya noted that Rick had talked about finding the woman he wanted to be with and asked where he saw the relationship going. She seemed to want to cry as she said there was a lot to discuss about where they stood. She wasn't asking for a proposal but wanted to know his view of their future.\n\n\nRick said he'd been taking things moment by moment. Maya had been, too, but she felt that they needed to discuss things if they planned to move forward. Rick realized she was a woman and didn't think about things the way men did.\n\n\nRick figured it might be that he was going through a divorce or had failed at his other marriage. He wasn't worried about where he and Maya would end up because he knew that he loved her and wanted to be with her. Maya didn't want to pressure him, but she knew there were things they needed to talk about. She said it couldn't happen unless she knew they were going to last.\n\n\nRick asked if Maya thought they wouldn't last. Maya believed they would, and he said that she could share whatever it was. Maya wanted to trust and be in the moment. She cut herself off, and Rick asked what it was. She didn't respond, and he asked if she was keeping something from him.\n\n\nIn the studio, Nicole and Carter reviewed her pictures. She'd never thought modeling would be so much fun. Carter advised her to give it time. She asked what he meant by that, and he cautiously explained that it took practice and time. Nicole said it was a good she had a sister who'd teach her.\n\n\nCarter deduced that Nicole felt Maya owed Nicole something. Nicole asserted that Maya had left Nicole in a household with bitter and embarrassed parents who'd been determined not to make the same mistakes with her that they'd made with Maya.\n\n\nNicole had waited for Maya to rescue her, but Maya had never arrived. Nicole said Maya owed her, and they were finally getting a chance at sisterhood. \"As long as you keep her secret,\" Carter added. Nicole claimed not to want to tell Maya's secret and said the road to sisterhood had been strange for her and Maya. Carter advised Nicole not to ruin it.\n\n\nNicole figured Rick would know once he proposed. Carter asked if she knew about him and Maya. \"You dated?\" Nicole asked. He revealed that they'd been engaged, and Maya hadn't said a word.\n\n\nLater, Nicole remarked that it was an interesting story, and she couldn't believe Maya had led Carter on that way. Carter replied that he didn't think it had been malicious. Nicole figured that Maya had been seriously hung up on Rick to not enjoy a rebound with Carter. Carter said people couldn't help who they loved. He'd thought Maya had been the one, though.\n\n\nCarter decided that it hadn't been meant to be, and it was a good thing, too. He admitted that he had huge issues, and he hated that he'd been in the dark; however, his problem wasn't Maya's transition. It was that, after their breakup, he'd seen new, unlikable sides of Maya.\n\n\nA small part of Carter admired Maya for going after what she wanted with Rick. Carter didn't want her to get hurt. Nicole gleaned that Carter thought Rick would leave Maya if Rick knew. Carter thought it was a possible. Nicole asked if Carter would leave. \"I don't know. Maybe,\" he mumbled. Carter stated that it was a big thing to process from a male perspective.\n\n\nNicole said Rick would be shocked, but it didn't have to change things. She figured that might have been something to talk about if Maya hadn't had surgery before meeting Rick, but the transition had already occurred. Carter said Maya might not have needed to say anything from day one, but he asked Nicole to look at how far Maya had taken it with Rick and with him.\n\n\nCarter stated that Rick didn't like lies and had a history of lashing out. Carter didn't think Rick had been told a lie as big before. Nicole stated that, to Maya, it wasn't a lie. Nicole guessed that Maya was holding off to see if Rick was serious enough about her to propose. Carter said that, proposal or not, it had to be weighing on Maya. He asked if it wasn't easier just to tell the truth.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Ivy was second-guessing herself in light of Rick's decision to put her in competition with Quinn. Liam urged Ivy to be confident and not view it as a competition. Wyatt listened in from the cracked doorway as Liam encouraged Ivy. Liam reminded her that, no matter what, she was the Forrester, and he'd be there to remind her that she \"kicks ass\" at work.\n\n\nWyatt entered and joined the conversation. Liam joked that he was there to make sure Ivy wasn't slacking, and Ivy murmured that she couldn't afford to slack. Wyatt told her that she didn't have to feel threatened by Quinn because there was room enough for both designers. Liam asserted that rehiring Quinn was just another reason that Rick shouldn't be CEO.\n\n\nAs Wyatt disagreed, Quinn arrived. She asked if Liam was there to see her. Frowning, Liam assured her that he wasn't. .She said she'd assumed that his magazine might want to do a feature on her return, and if they ever did want that, she was available for a quote. Liam asked if she was just as shocked as sane people were about her rehire.\n\n\nQuinn guessed Liam had earned the right to belittle her -- if that made him feel better. She said she'd been shocked, but no business should put all its jewelry eggs in one basket. She declared that she'd changed, and she no longer recognized the woman who'd gone after Ivy and Liam in the past. Ivy said she wanted a good working environment, but the situation was awkward. \"Oh, honey, I'm not going to shove you off of anything again. I promise,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nLiam wondered how long the new Quinn would last. \"Forever!\" Quinn exclaimed, and Liam asked if it was a side effect of Deacon. Quinn said Wyatt wouldn't stand by her if he didn't believe in her. She reasoned that Wyatt and Forrester had given her a chance and asked if Ivy and Liam would, too.\n\n\nLiam said that Quinn was asking for a lot, and though he couldn't speak for Ivy, he'd already given Quinn second, third, and fourth chances. He was done. He hoped Quinn was genuine for everyone else's sakes, but when it boiled down to real change, Liam didn't believe she had it in her. Quinn accepted Liam's feelings but said she really did mean what she'd said. Liam wondered if Quinn would mean it the next day, and Quinn replied that she'd prove it with her actions.\n\n\nQuinn remarked that she'd done something right because Ivy and Liam were still together. Liam told Quinn not to take credit for him and Ivy. Wyatt asked Liam to see how hard Quinn was trying. Liam asked what Wyatt wanted, because Liam couldn't forgive Quinn and didn't know how Wyatt could.\n\n\nWyatt said he could do it because Quinn was his mother, and though Quinn had messed up a lot of things for people, she was really trying to make amends. Wyatt felt that they needed to be adults about it because Ivy couldn't learn to work with Quinn if Liam was constantly brooding about what Quinn had done to them. Wyatt asserted that they all had to move beyond the past. Quinn looked hopefully at Liam and Ivy.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick holds the bottle and asks Maya why is she taking estrogen. She frowns while he continues that he thought that was just for older women who had female problems. She takes the bottle from him and says it is sort of complicated. She stammers and finally says it helps regulate her. He understands and she says she appreciates him. Nicole loves her pictures, but Carter says she needs a little more practice. She brags that luckily she has a big sister that can help her. He snarls that she is depending too much on Maya's help. Nicole feels Maya owes her for all those times she said she would return to her and then didn't. Carter tells Nicole that he and Maya were engaged and she never told him about her transgendering. He doubts she will tell Rick either. Nicole says that is an interesting story and she can't believe Maya did that. She can tell Carter really cared for her and he says yes he thought he was the one but it wasn't meant to be. He is not pining after Maya although he is hurt and angry why Maya did not tell him. He is sort of proud that she went after what she wanted and he does not want her to get hurt. Liam tells Ivy that she is the Forrester and not Quinn so she needs to rise above that and he will always be there for her. Wyatt overhears this. He goes on in and asks Liam what he is doing here. Liam says just to check up on Ivy and she denies that she is threatened by working with Quinn. Quinn comes in and hopes Liam is going to do a piece of her coming back to FC. She says she has changed and is not the same woman she used to be. She doesn't even recognize that woman any more. Wyatt says if Ivy can forget the past and they work together this will improve everyone. Liam is skeptical. Quinn says not only Rick forgave her but so did Wyatt so she is hoping Ivy can too. Liam says he can not speak for Ivy but Quinn is asking a lot of her. She reels people in and continues to do the same. She has nothing else in her. Carter says this is a lot to process. Carter says Maya did not have to tell Rick the truth on their first date but look how far Maya let it go and to himself even when they were engaged. Rick says he couldn't help but jump to the worst case scenario. Maya apologizes and says she should have told him right away. He is so sweet. She is happy to be questioned by her big strong CEO, and assures him that nothing is wrong. He still feels like there is. She says she does not want to push but she would like to know where they stand or where they are going. She is not asking for a proposal but she would like to know what Rick sees in their future. Quinn tells Liam that she wishes he would believe her so she will just have to prove it by her actions. Wyatt tells them that his mother has messed up a lot of things, even for him, and he is being cautiously optimistic. Liam says he may have to forgive her because he is her son but that doesn't include him automatically. Wyatt says Ivy and Quinn must work together but she can not do that if Liam is always in Ivy's ear. They have to move on. Carter tells Nicole that proposal or not Maya has to tell Rick. Rick says he is only taking this moment to moment and enjoying it. Maya says so is she but if they are to move forward there are things to talk about. Rick retorts that maybe it is because she is a woman and he has been hurt before and going thru a divorce right now. She says she knows but there are things that she needs to share with him if they are going to last. He says that is fine but he wonders if there is something she is keeping from him.",
