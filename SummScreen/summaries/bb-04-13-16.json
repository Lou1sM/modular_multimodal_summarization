Steffy charges home and tells Wyatt that she hates all of this and Quinn needs to go to prison. He says he would like to do that himself. He is trying to piece all of this together. He tells her about the surveillance footage in the parking lot. Everything Quinn told him when confronted she lied and he knows that now.

Maya tells Zende that of all the people in L.A. he had to hook up with Sasha, but Zende needs to know how much this is hurting Nicole. He says he did not plan on this, it just sort of happened. Sasha tells Nicole that all of this hurts her too but this is the way it went down and now Zende is in love with her. Nicole shouts that he hardly knows Sasha.

Nicole goes straight to Zende and asks if this is true \u0096 he is in love with Sasha. How could he do this so quickly? He denies it but Nicole says she did say that and she can not imagine why she would make that up. He says they did make love and he was trying to be a gentleman and be respectful but he did not tell Sasha that. He wanted to be with Nicole more than anything but he could not get over the fact that she was having his uncle's kid. She realizes it was unfair of her, but she cannot get over that he moved on to Sasha. He says he will never stop loving Nicole. Steffy repeats again that what Quinn did was insane and she wants her to be in jail tomorrow. Wyatt said yes Quinn had a part in it but they love each other and are married now so keeping it from Liam would be wrong. He meant his vows to her and he hopes she did too. They should not fall apart over this. They have all been victims of his mother before. Liam needs to know the truth and their own marriage will remain strong. He wants her to promise that.",
