C.J. replied that it wasn't all up to him. His mother had said that if the fashion house was a success, it would stay in the family; however, if it wasn't, they'd shut down and sell the whole thing to Bill. C.J. said it all depended upon the outcome of the Spectra showing that day.\n\n\nLater, Jarrett arrived, wondering if he'd just seen C.J. boarding the elevator. Agreeing, Bill replied that he'd changed his mind about the property, which meant that Jarrett wasn't off the hook for the Spectra showing. Wyatt asked about the possibility that Jarrett would like the collection. \"He won't. Will he?\" Bill asked Jarrett.\n\n\nBill was surprised that Sally was committing professional suicide that day and remarked that anyone else would have folded after Jarrett's first review. Wyatt reasoned that Bill had to give her credit for her chutzpah. Bill stated that chutzpah didn't pay the bills, and the days of successful Spectra fashion shows had passed.\n\n\nBill handed Jarrett a purchase agreement. He wanted Jarrett to give it to C.J. the moment the show was over. Jarrett conveyed that he wouldn't be the only press there, and there had been a lot of buzz about the event. Bill didn't care how many word slingers would be there, and he ordered Jarrett to get the agreement signed.\n\n\nWyatt looked up from his laptop to watch Jarrett leave. Wyatt's gaze fell back down to his screen, and Watt grinned at the picture of Sally from a fashion article.\n\n\nAt Forrester, R.J. asked Thomas what Sally had said the other day. Thomas relayed that Sally wanted them to go their separate ways before they began to dislike each other. \"As if she could do anything to make me dislike her,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nIn the Spectra showroom, the Champagne flowed. People hustled to get ready for the showing. On stage, Sally convened a meeting to give everyone a pep talk. When Shirley saw Coco walk in the room, Shirley hastily sent everyone back to work and signaled for Sally to deal with Coco. Saul expressed to Darlita that Coco couldn't see the gowns before they hit the runway.\n\n\nCoco beamed to Sally that the showroom was just like the one at Forrester. Sally asked why Coco wasn't at Forrester. Coco said she hadn't wanted to miss Spectra's big day. She offered to help backstage, but the Spectra gang convinced her that there was plenty to do up front.\n\n\nCoco received a call from R.J., who wanted to attend the event. She was sure it was fine, but when she put the phone to her chest and asked Sally for permission, Sally said it was a bad idea. Saul, Darlita, and Shirley echoed the sentiment, and Shirley said, \"Let me speak to him.\"\n\n\nCoco declined and got back on the phone to let R.J. know that her family wasn't \"on board.\" Taken aback that her family didn't want him there, R.J. wished her the best. After the call ended, Sally told Coco that it was for the best, and Coco would understand it soon enough.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, R.J. and Thomas were perplexed about why the Spectras didn't want R.J. to attend the showing. R.J. stated that it wasn't as if the designs were top secret, and the whole world would see them that day.\n\n\nLater, R.J. revealed that he'd sent Coco a corsage. He hoped it wasn't lame to do so. Thomas replied that it was definitely lame, but Coco would find it sweet. R.J. was sorry about how things had turned out for Sally and Thomas. Thomas admitted that he hadn't expected it after Australia, but he'd gotten it wrong.\n\n\nBackstage, Shirley glanced at some gowns on a rack and flashed back to her sister striding out on the runway before a Spectra show. Saul snapped Shirley out of it as he expressed his concern about keeping Coco away from the backstage area where the designs were.\n\n\nShirley went to the showroom to have a word with Coco. Shirley knew that Coco was confused about the reason R.J. couldn't attend the showing. Shirley said the internship had been good for Coco, but rubbing elbows with the hoity-toity people wouldn't last forever. \"It's going to come to an end, and you need to face that,\" Shirley advised.\n\n\nCoco said that the internship meant everything to her. Shirley responded that Coco wasn't one of the one percenters. Instead, Coco was a Spectra, and Spectras scratched and clawed their way to the top. As Shirley said people like the Forresters got hurt by it, Coco asserted that she didn't want any part of being a Spectra if it meant doing things she wasn't proud of.\n\n\nShirley replied that Coco would always be one of them. Shirley ordered Coco to embrace it and never apologize for it, no matter what happened.\n\n\nIn Sally's office, C.J. arrived and expressed concern to Sally about how extravagant the showroom seemed to be. Sally replied that one had to spend money to make it. He asserted that she didn't have money and was in debt already. C.J. stated that he loved her; however, if the show wasn't on point and a huge success, Spectra Fashions would close its doors that day for good.\n\n\nAfter C.J. left, Sally flashed back to a moment in Australia with Thomas. Shirley arrived, cooing about the place filling up. Shirley said they'd outfoxed the Forresters. Sally replied that they'd stolen designs. Shirley summed it up as robbing the rich to give to the poor. Sally stated that they weren't giving away anything. Instead, they were charging for knockoffs.\n\n\nNoting that she'd hurt Thomas and that her sister's world was about to fall apart, Sally concluded that the people she loved were paying the price for the deceit. She wondered what the purpose was in throwing away the rare honor Sally and Coco had to get to know the Forresters. Shirley replied that they were reviving their business and a family name that was also one to be proud of. \"Not like this,\" Sally contended.\n\n\nShirley said it had been exactly like that. In her view, no one had handed her sister anything, and her sister had worked hard to afford a lavish retirement. Shirley said no one had handed her sister anything, and her sister had outsmarted the Forresters.\n\n\nSally questioned whether stealing designs was outsmarting the Forresters and said it served them right if they went to jail. Shirley asserted that no one would go to jail, and Sally and Coco would have been dumped by the \"Forrester dudes\" either way. Shirley advised Sally to own the runway and prove that independent women didn't need men or high-and-mighty Forresters.\n\n\nSally said that Shirley kept characterizing the Forresters that way, but the Forresters were good people. Shirley thought Sally needed to be rallying the troops instead of being mushy. She reminded Sally that the buyers were the judge and jury that would decide the Spectra future.\n\n\nSally asked for a minute alone. Shirley marched out of the office. Sally glanced at pictures in her phone. One was of herself and Thomas, and the other was of herself with Coco. Sally strode out of the office, gazed at Sally's recycle poster, and headed for the showroom.\n\n\nBack in the showroom, Jarrett was surprised to encounter a pre-show mingling atmosphere just like he had many times before at Forrester. Shirley greeted him, saying that she had a special seat for him up front. Shirley said she could double-guarantee that he'd see a whole new collection from Sally Spectra that day.\n\n\nBackstage, Sally saw Coco approaching the entrance and rolled a black curtain up to block Coco's view of the models getting ready. Coco had located Sally to say that Coco was proud of Sally, and Coco believed that Aunt Sally would also be. Coco was impressed that Sally hadn't given up after the bad review, and Coco stated that the whole world would see Sally's true talent.\n\n\nSally started to speak, but Coco began going on about how Sally had been there for Coco. Sally had been a parent and sister at once, and Coco was thankful for it. Sally didn't feel she deserved it because she wasn't the sister Coco thought she was.\n\n\nA man approached with a delivery for Coco. Coco read the accompanying card, which said that Coco and Sally had proven R.J.'s family wrong about them. R.J. wished for an awesome fashion show. Coco found a corsage in the accompanying box. She said the Forresters hadn't thought she and Sally could be trusted, but they'd proven that they could be.\n\n\nCoco revealed that she'd started to think of R.J. as a boyfriend. The relationship wasn't official, but she cared for him just like Sally did for Thomas. Coco believed it could still work out for her sister and Thomas. Sally asserted that it couldn't, and it had become impossible.\n\n\nShirley approached to ask Coco to smoosh Jarrett. Coco hugged Sally, expressed love for her sister, and took off. Sally wiped away tears and gazed out at the gathering guests.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Wyatt grins as Bill makes C.J. Garrison a new, much bigger offer in order to get his hands on the Spectra building. C.J. reiterates that it all depends on the company's success as he gave Sally a promise. Jarrett warns Bill that buzz on the street is that the fashion show might become a big hit as a long list of buyers and fashion press has signed up to attend. Later, C.J. confronts Sally about the downright extravagant showroom, and warns his relative that if this show is no success, he will sell the premises. Shirley enthuses to Sally in the office that they outfoxed the Forresters. Sally is bitter about producing knock-offs instead of making a name for themselves with her own designs - and in the crossfire hurting Thomas and Coco. Saul and Darlita jump in to keep Coco from moving into the backstage area and discover the design theft. At Forrester Creations, R.J. tells Thomas that he sent Coco a gift to wish her luck. Thomas is still sad that Sally ended things with him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "There is plenty of hustle and bustle around Spectra. Sally calls the troops around and she wants them all to be nice to everybody who attend the fashion show. Bill tells Wyatt that today is the day \u0096 Spectra's last stand and then the property will be his. He tells CJ that Sally is going to be a flop and he will be doing Spectra a big favor. CJ says it depends on the show, of course, but if it is that bad he will accept a check from Bill and close the whole thing down. Jarrett comes in and makes mention that he just saw CJ leave the building. Bill says the misfits will fall today and the building will be his. Now Jarrett should rush off to this grand event. RJ calls Coco and wants to come over and see the showing with her. But Shirley and Saul say that would be a bad idea. CJ visits Sally and says this is a big risk. She is losing money. Spectra Fashions closes its doors today if this is another bad showing. RJ doesn't understand why he cannot be there for Coco. It is not like the designs are a big secret. The rest of the world will see them soon. Shirley tells Coco that she is glad she got the day off to be here today for Sally's showing. She is spending a lot of time with those hoity-toity people but if it all comes to an end Coco needs to be ready to accept that. Shirley tells her no matter how much time she spends cozying up to the Forrester's she will always be a Spectra and never ever apologize for that. They scratch and fight their way to the top and sometimes they do things they wish they didn't have to do. Jarrett tells Bill that he knows it is not reasonable but it is just possible Spectra will not tank today. Bill tells him to just get the agreement signed that RJ left. Shirley tells Sally they are about to change history. Do not think about the knockoffs .. taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Sally laments she does not like it. That is the reason she had to break up with Thomas. She says it is a privilege to be welcomed into the Forrester world but she and Coco were and now today that will all end. They might even end up in jail and it will be their fault. Shirley keeps calling them high and mighty but they are good people. Shirley says the audience will be the judge and jury so get out there and let them decide. Bill lays his hands lovingly on his Spencer tower prototype. He can smell it already. Shirley welcomes Jarrett and says she guarantees him he will see a whole new showing today. Coco tells Sally that she is really proud of her. The whole world will see her success today. Sally has to do a double dance to keep Coco from seeing the gowns before they are shown. Coco opens a gift from RJ. It's an orchid corsage and card wishing them well.
