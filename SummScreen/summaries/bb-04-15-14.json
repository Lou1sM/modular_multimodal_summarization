Liam called Hope to tell her he was driving. \"What are you doing?\" she screamed. Liam said they needed to talk.\n\n\nWyatt walked out of Forrester and helplessly watched the trailer head off the Forrester property. Wyatt chased after it. Hope called Wyatt and told him that Liam had kidnapped her. Wyatt was furious and said that he planned to call the police, but Hope told him to calm down. She said that Liam needed to talk, and she would call Wyatt later. Wyatt promised to pick up Hope, no matter where Liam had taken her.\n\n\nLiam pulled the trailer into his driveway at home. Liam opened the trailer door and sat down with Hope. Liam admitted that he had been extreme. Hope reminded Liam that he had stolen Wyatt's truck, and Wyatt had been worried sick. Liam said that they needed time together. \"Want to come inside -- we have a lot to figure out,\" Liam suggested. Hope agreed.\n\n\nHope called Wyatt and advised him that she was at Liam's house. Wyatt promised to drive up and rescue her, but Hope advised him to stay away. She told him that Liam had locked the gate, but Wyatt furiously said that nothing could stop him from getting Hope away from Liam. \n\n\nHope repeated that she wanted Wyatt to stay away from Liam's house. \"I don't like what Liam did, but he needs this time. And honestly, so do I,\" she confessed. Hope begged Wyatt to understand. Wyatt agreed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt sat in a daze, and Quinn entered. Quinn told Wyatt that she had ordered amethyst from Brazil for some new pieces. Quinn wanted to get Wyatt's opinion on a few things before Wyatt and Hope took off on a trip.\n\n\nWyatt told his mother that Liam had stolen Wyatt's truck and kidnapped Hope. Wyatt confessed that he was worried. Quinn said it was bizarre behavior, even for Liam. Wyatt agreed, but he admitted that Liam was not a psychopath. Quinn shouted that Wyatt had to get out to Liam's house immediately, even though Hope had asked Wyatt to stay away.\n\n\nInside at Liam's house, Liam confessed to Hope that he had freaked out. \"Can you blame me,\" he asked. Liam reminded Hope that things would have changed permanently if she had been pregnant with Wyatt's child. \"I almost lost you today. We almost lost each other forever. I hope that scared you as much as it scared me,\" Liam said.\n\n\nHope admitted she had been scared. She tearfully agreed that the thought of losing Liam forever was something she couldn't do, but she couldn't imagine losing Wyatt either. \"I know how you feel,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam told Hope that he knew she didn't love Wyatt the way they had loved each other. He told her that she was home. \"Look at the memories here. We should be married now. We should be planning a future,\" Liam said. Hope tearfully looked at Liam. \"This is your home, and you belong with me. Come home to me,\" Liam said. Hope and Liam kissed passionately.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke and Katie sparred over Katie's conversation with Eric. Brooke advised Katie that it had been Eric's decision to make Brooke and Ridge co-vice presidents.\n\n\nKatie doubted that Brooke was telling the truth, but Brooke assured Katie that Eric had always seen Brooke and Ridge as the future of Forrester. Brooke accused Katie of being insecure. Katie asked Brooke if Eric knew that Brooke and Bill had been sharing a bed.\n\n\nBrooke warned that Forrester was a place of business, and Brooke's romance should have no impact on her work. Katie scoffed that Brooke had suddenly taken a renewed interest in Forrester after having little to do with the company for a long time. Brooke said she had to protect her interest in the company and that of her children.\n\n\nKatie reminded Brooke that Taylor had said the exact same things when Taylor had started working at Forrester. Brooke said that Taylor had been a psychiatrist, while Brooke had been a chemist who had created BeLief, and she had helped with the Men's Line and with Brooke's Bedroom -- one of the most successful lines at Forrester.\n\n\nBrooke refused to defend herself to Katie. \"Who are you, Katie?\" Brooke asked. \"Not your shy wallflower sister,\" Katie responded. Brooke recalled that she didn't recognize Ridge anymore, and she felt the same about Katie.\n\n\nBrooke surmised that Katie had been waiting her whole life to get the best of Brooke. Katie looked determined. Brooke accused Katie of looking for payback. Katie snarked that she didn't need payback. Katie professed that she was happy with Ridge.\n\n\nKatie reminded Brooke that Katie was a mother and a CEO, running a company. Brooke noted that Katie had manipulated Bill out of his position and stolen his company.\n\n\nKatie accused Brooke of having selective memory because Brooke had conveniently forgotten what Bill had done when he had tricked Katie into signing the company over to him. \"You and Ridge are so hypocritical,\" Brooke said. Brooke added that she and Bill had made mistakes. Brooke said that everyone should be forgiven.\n\n\nKatie said that she had supported Brooke through all of her sordid relationships, but Katie was done. \"I stopped defending you and started defending myself,\" she said. Katie looked confident. \"Enjoy my husband,\" Katie said, \"you're two of a kind.\"\n\n\nBrooke looked pensive, but Brooke recalled that Katie had married Bill. \"He's not the same man I married. I haven't seen that man in a long time,\" Katie said. Katie added that she and Ridge wanted a life with less drama.\n\n\nAt lunch at an outdoor cafe, Bill flashed back to a conversation he'd had with Katie -- when he had told her that she and Karen had stolen his business from him. Bill remembered Katie's confidence and her response that she had learned from the best. Justin interrupted and promised good news.\n\n\nJustin reported that the Spencer quarterlies had been flat, at best. Justin believed the board would reinstate Bill because the company couldn't continue on that same path. Bill professed that he would soon have his company back. Justin was glad because Ridge had seemed totally at home in Katie's office. Bill looked determined. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Wyatt desperately chases after Liam and Hope. Liam drives Hope to the cliff house and begs her for a chance to talk. Katie and Brooke continue to fight about their relationships with Ridge and Bill. Justin shares bad news about Spencer Publications with Bill. Bill becomes determined to get his company back and gain custody of Will. Hope and Liam share a passionate kiss.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Looking over his shoulder, Liam speeds off in the trailer with a confused Hope. Wyatt comes back out to find a missing trailer and sees it take off with Hope waving from the back window. He waves his arms and hollers for Liam to stop. Liam tells her on the cell that he just wants to talk to her. He says he knows this is a little extreme but if she had been pregnant with Wyatt's child that would have been the end of it for them. She tells him this is between her and Wyatt and has nothing to do with Liam. He says he doesn't agree. This was a huge wake-up call to him and he hopes to her too. Wyatt calls too to see if Hope is okay. She says yes; Liam just wanted to talk to her. She is unsure just where he is taking her. Wyatt wants to call the police but she convinces him not to. Wyatt says but he took his truck and kidnapped her. Hope says she can handle Liam. Wyatt says okay but he can't just stay here and do nothing. He has his cell so Hope can call him at any time and he will pick her up. Justin meets Bill for lunch. Bill says cut to the chase and just give him the latest quarterly numbers. Justin tells him no one is panicking yet but they are losing ground steadily. Bill rants there was mutiny but he needs to take back control of his ship. Karen won't return his calls but he will deal with her. And with Katie calling the shots, he can't see his son. He should have equal custody and Spencer company too. Katie is a little distracted these days but surely she did not think he would give up. So this will work in his favor when he is ready to pounce. Justin says no one wants him back more than he does, but taking over now will be dicey now that he is living with Brooke. And it will put her in the middle of him and her sister. Brooke walks into Eric's office and tells Katie that she wasted no time coming and laying the law down to Eric. Katie says that Eric is pushing Ridge at her and she is not going to stand by and watch it happen. Brooke maintains it was Eric's idea and she can not help it if he thinks she and Ridge are the future of FC. Katie says that Eric doesn't understand her relationship with Ridge otherwise he would not have made this proposal. But Ridge leaving her and taking the CEO position is not going to happen. Eric will see in time how happy they are and that Brooke is now back with Bill and in his bed. Brooks tells her that Eric has his agenda and she has hers. She is not going to stand around and watch her children be squeezed out of the company. Katie reminds her that Taylor tried that too and Brooke was all over her. Brooke recites that Taylor is a psychiatrist and Brooke is a chemist, the one who discovered Belief, the men's line, Brooke's Bedroom line .the fact that she is standing here defending herself is ridiculous. She doesn't even know who Katie is anymore. Katie smirks that she sure isn't that shy wallflower little sister anymore. She is sorry that is hard for Brooke to deal with. Brooke says she would like to think that Katie is sorry for other things but she sees now this is what she has always wanted to happen all her life. Katie knows Brooke still thinks this is some sort of payback. Brooke says it is more complicated than that even to the point of her and Karen manipulating Bill out of his company. Katie says Brooke has selective memory so don't forget those papers that Bill got her to sign. Brooke was so mad at Bill for lying to the both of them. How quickly she forgets. Brooke says she and Ridge are so hypocritical and holding Brooke to such high standards as if she is the only one who makes mistakes. Katie scoffs if that is what she is calling all her scandals and indiscretions .mistakes she should be forgiven for. Katie says and she always did until she found herself in another sordid entanglement and came after Katie and her marriage. Then she stopped defending Brooke and started defending herself. She always knew that Brooke's lifestyle would someday catch up with her. It finally has so enjoy Bill, enjoy Katie's husband because they both are two of a kind. He is not the man she married. She hasn't seen that man in a long long time but she is sure Brooke sees him differently. She and Ridge want something different, more drama free, simple. They want to raise their children and be there for each other as a couple. Perhaps someday Brooke will want that too and she hopes it won't be too late. Quinn is dismayed and shocked when she finds Wyatt distracted and he tells her that Liam took his truck along with Hope. He says he has no idea where they are going and it's driving him crazy. Quinn says this is bizarre even for Liam. Wyatt says he has just been waiting around for Wyatt to screw up. Quinn says but he hasn't. Hope is madly in love with him and she will realizes that when he rescues her from Liam. Wyatt tells her that Liam is not some psychopath that Hope needs to be rescued from. He just wants to talk about something. Quinn doesn't know why he had to make such a big production of it. Hope sees that Liam has taken her to his house. He says he took the back roads so Wyatt could not follow him. She reminds him that he couldn't as Liam took his truck. Liam says oh yeah, he did do that. He asks if she has had any contact with Wyatt. She says yes, and he is going out of his mind. Liam says he can understand how he feels. He is sorry it had to be this way but they need to go inside and figure something out. She calls Wyatt and tells him that she is at Liam's. He says he is on his way. She says no as Liam has locked the gates. Wyatt says it will take more than a locked gate to keep him out. Hope tells Wyatt that she doesn't like what Liam did but he's really upset. She thinks he really needs this time and so does she. She hopes Wyatt can understand and do this for her. He says it is taking everything in him to stay in control. Quinn tells him this is not good; Wyatt needs to go there. In a panic mode, Liam tells Hope that she was almost pregnant with Wyatt's child. He almost lost her. They almost lost each other. He hopes that scared her as much as it did him. She says of course it scared her. She can't be pregnant right now .especially the thought of losing him .the thought of closing that door, but she can't imagine losing Wyatt either. Liam says he knows how she feels but she could give it a try. Just look around at the memories. She can't love him the way she did Liam. They should be married right now and planning their future. But that's a future they can't have if she had his child. He pleads that he is her home. This is her home and she belongs with him, \"come home to me\". He kisses her.",
