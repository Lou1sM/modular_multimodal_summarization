    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's office at Forrester, Maya and Nicole discussed how important it was to keep Maya's secret because if it leaked out, it could ruin Forrester, and Rick could lose his job. \"No one else can know,\" Maya said.\n\n\nNicole promised to keep Maya's secret. Outside the office, Wyatt had overheard the conversation. He didn't know the secret, but he smiled at his discovery and that it was so important that Rick could lose his job. Wyatt left unnoticed.\n\n\nInside the office, Nicole said she felt like she and Maya were really sisters. She was grateful that her modeling career had kicked off, and she would never tell anyone that Maya was a transgender woman.\n\n\nCarter entered, and Nicole worried about Carter keeping Maya's secret. Carter admitted he was uncomfortable with keeping the secret from Rick. Maya maintained that she would tell Rick when she was ready.\n\n\n\"It's my life,\" Maya announced. Rick entered and asked what had happened. Carter looked away. Carter explained that he and Maya had had a disagreement. Pam entered and reminded Rick that he had a meeting with Quinn, and she added that Carter also had a meeting with Quinn.\n\n\nPam told Rick that she couldn't believe he had rehired Quinn. Rick defended his decision and advised that if anyone was unhappy, they could leave. \"I'm allowed to have an opinion, and you're going to be sorry you let her back in,\" Pam said.\n\n\nCarter and Pam left, and Nicole and Maya shared that they were both fans of old movies while Rick listened. Maya said there were a lot of DVDs at the house, and she loved the comedies. They agreed to watch a movie and make popcorn together. Nicole left, and Rick praised Maya for repairing her relationship with Nicole.\n\n\nMaya agreed she really liked her sister, and she saw a lot of herself in Nicole -- someone who had been fighting for a better life. She and Rick smiled, and Maya said she was happy because she had the best man, and he was all hers.\n\n\nRick asked about Carter, and Maya explained that it was awkward between them and always would be. \"It is inevitable,\" she said. Rick agreed that Maya had almost married Carter, and Rick would be just as awkward if he had been in Carter's shoes.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie was on the phone with a client, and Bill and Liam overheard her conversation. \"Hey, that's my husband you're talking about,\" Katie said on the phone. Katie hung up, and Bill and Liam surprised her.\n\n\nBill said that he had been impressed with the hot, efficient ball of hyper energy he had witnessed. \"I may need to cool you down,\" Bill said. Liam begged his dad to save the innuendos for private time, but Bill countered that he never picked on Liam for panting all over Ivy. Liam shook his head and smiled.\n\n\nBill countered that Katie was his hot wife, but Katie agreed that Bill's conversation had been inappropriate for the office. She teased that she would have to call HR. Liam cheered her on. Talk turned to Rick and how he had rehired Quinn.\n\n\nBill and Liam worried about how Rick had treated Ivy and the other employees. They added that Ivy had literally worried about Quinn sticking a knife in her back. Katie looked pensive. Bill lamented that Little Ricky had made a lot of decisions the Forrester family would regret.\n\n\nWyatt burst into the office. Katie, Bill, and Liam stopped mid-conversation. \"I might have something on Rick,\" Wyatt said. He explained that he was not sure what it was, but he'd overheard Maya and her sister talking about some \"epic secret that could send shockwaves through the entire company,\" and Rick could be out as CEO -- if the secret got out.\n\n\nBill and Liam hoped it would help with their takeover. Katie suggested they take a step back. Wyatt said he knew where to start: with Nicole. Wyatt left, and Liam followed him. Katie was conflicted because Rick was her nephew, and no matter what they did to anyone at Forrester, it would affect Brooke.\n\n\nBill noted that there would always be collateral damage. Katie said it was \"the height of irony that Bill was going after someone for being a tyrant.\" Bill defended himself and reminded her that he was the CEO of multinational company -- not a dress factory.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Quinn and Deacon cuddled and discussed that Quinn had sent out Evites for their wedding. Quinn worried that no one would show up, but she and Deacon agreed they didn't care. \"This will be my first wedding,\" Quinn said. \"And hopefully your last,\" Deacon added.\n\n\nQuinn hoped that people would notice that she had changed. Deacon said Quinn often put on a brave face, but he realized how much it meant to her to be accepted. Brooke entered and gave Quinn and Deacon disapproving looks.\n\n\nQuinn said she was waiting for a meeting with Rick. Brooke said she had received Quinn's Evite. \"Are you coming?\" Quinn asked. Brooke looked skeptical. Brooke declined to attend and advised Deacon to bail.\n\n\nQuinn pressed on. She maintained that she wanted to invite the mother of her groom's child, and Quinn hoped that Hope would attend also. \"Don't count on it,\" Brooke advised. Quinn hoped that Rick would attend out of professional courtesy. Brooke scoffed.\n\n\nQuinn said it would be nice to have both Wyatt and Hope at the wedding, but Brooke reiterated that Hope would not attend, and neither would anyone else. Quinn maintained that she had changed. Brooke reminded Quinn that she had been horrible to everyone in the family.\n\n\n\"Disapprove if you want, but you will not interfere with our wedding,\" Quinn ordered. She added that Brooke had had more men in her life than anyone could keep track of, but Quinn had loved only two men: Bill and Deacon. She planned to celebrate that Deacon supported and loved her.\n\n\nQuinn begged Brooke to get along with her for their family's sake, but Brooke ignored her.\n\n\nCarter entered, and Quinn asked if he had received her Evite. Carter stammered that he had, but he seemed to be looking for an excuse not to attend. Quinn said they'd wanted him to perform the wedding ceremony. They offered to pay him, and they promised it wouldn't take much time. Carter reluctantly agreed. Quinn hugged him. Carter left, and Quinn had to leave. She announced to Brooke that she didn't care what Brooke did. Quinn left.\n\n\nBrooke told Deacon that he was making a mistake. She added that she had been lost, and he and A. A. had helped her. \"Now you're lost,\" she said. Brooke insisted that Deacon had to be crazy to go through with a wedding to Quinn. \"I won't accept that. I'll never accept that,\" she said. Brooke maintained that she cared about Deacon. \"I am not going to let you marry Quinn,\" she said.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Nicole scanned the crowd, looking for someone. Wyatt noticed her and asked if he could help. Nicole said she was looking for Oliver because she wanted to see the photos from her shoot.\n\n\nWyatt was surprised that Nicole was a model. She replied that her sister had helped set things up for her. \"Maya has a lot of influence,\" she said. Wyatt agreed, and he said it was mind-blowing how far Maya had progressed -- from an \"ex-con to queen of the manor.\"\n\n\nNicole agreed. She asked if Wyatt liked Maya, and he responded that some people saw her as a manipulative gold-digger. He admired that she had seen what she'd wanted and gotten it.\n\n\nNicole said she lived at the Forrester estate with Maya and Rick. Wyatt asked if they were all getting along, and Nicole admitted that \"it had been bumpy at first. I had to do a lot of negotiating,\" she said. Wyatt said he wanted to get to know Nicole better. Nicole agreed. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "With Wyatt listening behind a partially opened door, Maya tells Nicole they have a bigger stake in this than their agenda. If this secret gets out it could really hurt Rick and FC. Nicole agrees that she is not the one who would want to cause that. Bill tells Liam that he likes his little ball of hyper energy that Katie has become at the office. She teases him and says as much as she is flattered Liam is right. This is inappropriate conversation for the office. Bill says okay, what they need to do is get on with FC and focus on the takeover and all be on the same page. He can't believe that Rick rolled out the red carpet for loony Quinn. Liam says if it helps their cause then Quinn can do her worst. Quinn sits on a couch with Deacon and explains that she sent out e-vites to everyone they know. Maybe they will not come but some will as she has changed and some will take notice. She says she got him, he got her, no one else matters. Brooke comes in and says she did not realize they were here. Quinn says she is there for a meeting with Rick. She inquires if Brooke got her e-vite. Brooke says yes but do not expect her to attend, she does not support this marriage. And she would not expect Hope to either even if her daddy is Deacon. And she tells Deacon that he still has time to bail. Quinn reminds her that she is standing right there and that is so disrespectful and they do not need that kind of negativity. And if that is what she is bringing then she can just stay home or feel free to adjust her attitude and change her mind. Nicole tells Maya that she never wanted to blow her out of the water. She just wanted to be treated like family and now Maya has. They are really sisters and she has this fabulous house and a budding modeling career. There is no way she would want to jeopardize that. She will keep her transgender story a secret. Carter knocks but comes on in and agrees this could be a public relations firestorm. He just thinks Rick needs to know the truth. They look like deer in the headlights when Rick comes in and asks what is going on. The energy seems off in here. Maya quickly says that she and Carter just had another disagreement but all is fine. Pam comes in and reminds Rick that he has a meeting with that viper Quinn. Rick says that door swings both ways and anyone who wants to can just leave. Rick tells Nicole that he ought to cut Carter some slack. He came in here after losing the most incredible woman in the world and if it were him he doubt he would handle it as well. Quinn calls Carter into her office and while it catches him off guard and his first tendency is to say no, he agrees to marry her and Deacon. Nicole and Maya end up talking old movies and making popcorn and Rick takes credit for being right and getting the sisters together. Liam tells Bill that it gets more and more intolerable every day at FC and he wishes they could move now. Wyatt rushes in and says he may have something on Rick. He is not sure what it is as he had to leave but he did hear Maya and Nicole discussing some epic secret. They said it would send shockwaves throughout the company and Rick could be out as CEO. Liam tells Wyatt that if this secret is that explosive then they must have it. But Katie speaks up and says they need to slow down. Perhaps there is another way to get what they want out of Rick. Liam says no, he would just take it out on Ivy and Caroline. They have to surprise Rick and that means Wyatt the only one with the inside track. Bill tells Wyatt to use it. Wyatt bolts out and says he knows exactly where to start. Katie tells Bill that she is quiet because she is Rick's aunt and is conflicted. This will affect Brooke and she does not want to cause her more problems. And Katie thinks it ironic that Bill is going after someone for being a tyrant. Bill scoffs that he has been more than warm and fuzzy since he got his Katie back. She replies that yes he has been downright squishy. Back at FC, Wyatt catches up with Nicole and introduces himself. She says she is just starting out but her sister, Maya, is helping her. It blows her mind every time she thinks how far she has come and what she had to overcome. Wyatt says yeah, from ex-con to Queen of the manor, quite a climb. Some people may see her as manipulative and a gold-digger but he sees a woman who knew what she wanted and went after it and got it. Nicole agrees things were a little bumpy at first and they had some adjusting to do but all is fine now. Wyatt says he finds her very interesting and would like to know her better. Quinn tells Deacon that they have Carter now so maybe others will come around. She tries one more time even a glutton for punishment to convince Brooke to come to the wedding. When she goes to her meeting she tells Deacon to keep working on the guest list. Brooke tells Deacon that Quinn was right. They will always share time with each other for their daughter and because of AA when she was lost. Now he is the one who is lost. She will always be in his corner and she cares for him, but she is not going to accept this. She will not let him marry Quinn.",
