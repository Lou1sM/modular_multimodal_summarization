They kissed again, but Hope pulled away.\n\n\nHope reminded Liam that he had stolen Wyatt's truck to talk to her. \"What is this supposed to accomplish?\" Hope asked. She wondered if Liam had intended to talk some sense into her. Liam laughed and said that he did. \"Enough. There has to be a line. I'm dating Wyatt. I'm in a relationship with Wyatt,\" Hope said. Liam countered, \"You're not ready to marry him, and you're sure as hell not ready to have his kids.\"\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt confided in Quinn that he felt Liam had stolen his truck and his girlfriend. Quinn advised Wyatt to hurry to Liam's house. Wyatt and Quinn drove to Liam's house, and Quinn insisted she wanted to get her hands on Liam. Wyatt advised his mother to stay out of his confrontation with Liam and remain in the car after she dropped Wyatt off. Quinn warned Wyatt not to underestimate Liam's bond with Hope.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Hope recalled good times in Italy with Liam. \"This is your home, it's our home. Come back to me,\" Liam said. He reminded Hope that her pregnancy scare had scared him to his core. \"We would have lost each other forever,\" Liam said.\n\n\nHope admitted she had been scared. She tearfully agreed that she was not ready to give up on Liam, but she was taking things really slowly with Wyatt. Liam countered that she had to think about what marriage and children with Wyatt would have meant to Hope. \"We would be married right now if it weren't for Wyatt and Quinn,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam reminded Hope to focus on the good and how they made each other laugh. Liam recalled how they had met when Liam was a computer geek that Hope had reunited with his dad. \"Don't close the book on us when we have so much more story to tell,\" Liam said. \n\n\nLiam tried to kiss Hope again, but Wyatt barged in and told Liam to get his hands off Hope. Wyatt called Liam pathetic and insisted that Hope had to leave with him. \"I'm sorry, Liam,\" Hope said. Hope left with Wyatt.\n\n\nLater, Quinn barged into Liam's house and pushed Liam. Quinn threatened Liam never to pull something like his recent stunt where he had stolen Wyatt's truck. \"Wyatt will never end up with Hope. Never,\" Liam said. Quinn prepared to slap Liam, but he angrily stopped her.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Donna entered Brooke's office, and Brooke shared that she and Bill had reunited and were living together. Brooke added that Katie and Ridge were together as well. Brooke said that Katie had been on a major power trip. Donna noted that Brooke and Katie had to work things out. Brooke left.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Justin, Karen, Katie, and Katie's assistant met about the company's quarterly report. Karen was displeased with the numbers and said they had flattened out. \"What are we going to do about it?\" Karen asked. Katie replied that the company was in transition. Justin suggested that the company had gone from profit to loss. Karen said that the numbers were unacceptable, but Katie countered that the numbers would improve after two more quarters in projections.\n\n\nJustin worried that the company had to lower expectations. Katie said the company had been shortsighted under Bill's presidency. Katie added that morale around Spencer had been low when Bill had been in charge. Katie advised that the company would be back on track earnings-wise. Karen smiled. Karen agreed with Katie.\n\n\nThe meeting concluded, and Karen met alone with Katie. They discussed that Bill was again with Brooke, and Katie had united with Ridge. Karen noted that Katie seemed happy. Karen wished she could be closer to Bill, but they had a lot to work on. Katie said that Karen's support meant everything to her. Katie had to leave for a meeting.\n\n\nLater, Brooke called Karen and requested a luncheon meeting but asked Karen not to tell anyone about it. Brooke and Karen met at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Brooke complained that Katie's power had become a problem. Karen said that she hadn't seen power as a problem. Karen had seen two sisters butting heads. \n\n\n\"From what I hear, you're both in love,\" Karen said. Brooke wanted to talk about Bill and his company. Karen listened but warned that Bill had gotten what he had deserved.\n\n\nBrooke pressured Karen to admit that Katie had not done as well as Bill had as company president. Karen acknowledged there had been hiccups in Katie's administration. Brooke advised Karen to fire Katie and rehire Bill as CEO.\n\n\n",

    "imdb": "\nQuinn lets Liam know exactly how she feels about his interference with Hope and Wyatt.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn encourages Wyatt to take a stand and do something about Liam having kidnapped Hope. Wyatt says Liam is desperate to which Quinn replies yes and desperate people can be dangerous. Wyatt says Hope knows what she wants and it isn't Liam. He says let's go. Quinn grouses on the way and says Liam needs to be put in his place. Wyatt tells her it won't be by her; that he will handle Liam. She just needs to drop him off and stay out of it. She tells him do not engage in a conversation with Liam. He is not like them. Meanwhile Liam is trying to convince Hope that they are at a crossroads but have a second chance to get it right. And if they don't take it he is freaking out that they won't get another. He suddenly kisses her until she breaks away and says he is crazy; he just stole Wyatt's truck and trailer. Liam says he knows he is acting like an insane person but she was almost pregnant and that would have been the end of them and he could not let that happen. She doesn't know what this is supposed to accomplish. He says he needed to talk to her alone. Kind of talk some sense into her. She reminds him that she is dating Wyatt. She is in a relationship with him. Liam agrees but says if she is not ready to marry Wyatt then she sure as heck doesn't want to have his baby. While he is out of the room, she picks up his jacket and thinks back on Italy. Liam walks in and says this is her home; come back to him. He reveals this pregnancy thing scared him to the core and he knows it had to scare her too. She admits it did. He says he would have lost her forever. She says she is not so that did not happen. He asks her to look around and see the memories; they belong here. She admits it is special and he's special and honestly she is not ready to give up on all of this. But she reminds him again that she is dating Wyatt. She likes that they are taking things slowly. He's patient and doesn't pressure her. Liam says okay but she was almost pregnant and if there is anything that puts pressure on it would be that. It would have meant marriage, children, the mother-in-law who lies. They would be married right now except for that woman. Hope says she doesn't want to talk about her. He says okay, then just focus on him and all the fun they used to have. Remember that fun computer Geek, Liam Cooper. Donna drops in on Brooke and asks if the rumors she has heard are true .Brooke is back with Bill. Brooke says Ridge made his choice so now so has she. Ridge is with Katie and she has become very power hungry. They discuss Karen having 50%, Bill 49% and Katie 1%, so she and Karen have controlling interest as long as they are a team. That isn't likely to change as she is on the outs with her brother. Katie has a meeting with Justin and Karen who is in town. Whether they want to call it a situation or the problem, Karen realizes they have flattened out and this is unacceptable and they need to do something about it. Katie says they will get the earnings back up; they can hold her to that. Katie tells Karen that she is sure Justin is sharing all of her shortcomings with Bill. He's lucky he still has a job. Karen says she doesn't know what she is going to do about her brother either. He was so supportive when she came out and she hoped they could have a good brother/sister relationship, but now he is stubborn as a mule. She mentions that Katie looks much happier than the last time she was there. Katie says it is because she is in love. Karen says if she is happy then she is happy. Katie has a scheduled meeting so Karen has to go. She gets a phone call from Brooke wanting her to meet her for lunch and don't tell anyone. Hope tells Liam that this wasn't a very good idea. He did not have to hi-jack a truck to see her. Liam says he will remember that next time. He says here's the thing. This has taught him how easy it is to lose each other and he could not live with that. He loves her too damn much and this is his one shot to put all the little pieces back together. He grabs her by the face with both hands and is about to kiss her when Wyatt comes barging in and tells him to get his hands off of Hope. He tells Hope let's go and asks Liam for the keys to his truck. Liam throws him the keys and says the truck needs an overhaul. Wyatt says Liam is pathetic; kidnapping Hope just to get time with her alone the only way he knew she'd come. Liam says maybe he ought to ask Hope if she wants to go or stay. He says she doesn't have to go. This is her home and always will be. Hope looks at him and tells Liam that she is sorry. She picks up her purse and leaves with Wyatt opening the door for her. Karen joins Brooke for lunch. Brooke tells her she wants to talk to her about her brother and Brooke's sister. Karen says she was just with Katie so what is the problem. She repeats to her what she told Donna .that Katie is on a power trip. Karen says all she sees is they are butting heads over the men in their lives and they both ought to be deliriously happy. Brooke asks Karen if she is happy with Katie's running SP. Karen admits there have been a few hiccups. Brooke says she loves her sister and she is going to continue to work on that relationship, but she doesn't think she should be running SP. And if Karen doesn't want to, then give it to Bill. Hire him back as CEO and let him do what he does best and fire Katie. Quinn comes charging through the back patio doors, and double pushes Liam in the chest and tells him to never pull something like this again. He points his finger at her and says Wyatt will never end up with Hope. Does she understand that, never! She raises her arm again but he blocks it. If looks could kill.",
