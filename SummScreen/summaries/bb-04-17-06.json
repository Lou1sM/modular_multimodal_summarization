    "imdb": "\nMassimo denies framing Jacqueline and fails to reconcile Brooke with Ridge, who now gets dad's blessing for his own plan. Bridget realizes Stefanie foresaw that she would bond with baby Dominick 'Dino', and feels disfavored just for being Brooke's daughter when she's asked to allow Felicia quality time with him and refuses in tears. Nick wonders why Forrester employee Megan Conley was also sneaking in his mother's boutiques chain HQ and keeps looking for proof.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nick literally catches Megan in the dark in his mother's office at the Boutique. It has been closed since his mother's arrest, so naturally he is suspicious and needs questions answered. She is shocked to learn that Jackie's bail has been denied. Then does some tall talking of how she was only trying to fill in and help to make it easier when Jackie did return. As he looks through some of his mother's files, Nick offers a thank you to Megan, as one of Brooke's best friends. Stephanie is elated at Felicia's good test results. Christian gives his star patient his best care. Stephanie has a rather poignant heart to heart with Bridget about letting go a little of Dominick and let Felicia mother him for as long as she's able. Bridget sees it a little more black and white than that \u0096 taking sides \u0096 Brooke and her daughter vs Stephanie and her daughter. Brooke continues her talk with Massimo and informs him that Nick will never speak to him again if he had his mother framed. He assures her he is not that cold-hearted. Ridge interrupts which delights Mass. He wants the two of them to stand there and work this out; he knows they love each other. He preaches to Brooke just don't bring Dominick into this. She listens but then tells Ridge that she has made her decision. Her future is with Nick and she implores him to please accept that. He tells Massimo there is something he can do. He already has. He wants to borrow the Marone jet, to go to Paris. He has a plan to win Brooke back. Massimo is more than happy to do his part. He gets a phone call and he's able to put them off until he can get back with them. Ridge appreciates him dropping everything else to help him with his problems. Nick tells Brooke that his mother is not a criminal and he's doing all he can to help her. She's not surprised to hear that Megan is helping as well. Megan pops into Mass's office, but with Ridge there she covers that she was bringing some papers for him to sign. She returns later and calls Massimo by his first name and says they need to talk. She can not do this any anymore.",
