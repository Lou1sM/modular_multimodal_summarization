    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam told Quinn that she'd get out, or he'd throw her out. He knew why she was there, but he asserted that nothing would make him give up on Hope. Quinn told Liam that Hope didn't need a whiny little boy. Quinn felt that Bill had spoiled Liam and that Liam should be grateful for what he had instead of trying to hold on to what wasn't his.\n\n\nQuinn was frustrated because Liam thought the worst of her and Wyatt, but she insisted that they weren't evil. She said she and Wyatt weren't squeaky clean, but they'd had to claw, hustle, and scratch to get to the top. Quinn wouldn't apologize for it or let Liam judge her and Wyatt for it, either.\n\n\nQuinn told Liam that he'd gone too far, but Liam scoffed at Quinn for lecturing him about that topic. He said that Hope was just an ambition to Quinn, a connection to one of the most prestigious companies in the world. Quinn corrected that Forrester worked with her because she made an exceptional product. She said that she and Wyatt had gotten acceptance from everyone -- except Liam.\n\n\nQuinn revealed that she'd wanted Wyatt and Liam to have a relationship; however, she knew that it wasn't always possible and that sometimes circumstances made things difficult. Liam replied that some circumstances made it impossible, and he and Wyatt would never get along because they were nothing alike -- and that was why, in the end, Hope would choose Liam.\n\n\nQuinn quipped that Hope had already turned Liam down. Liam said that decency and goodness would win out in the end, and he didn't have to do anything to lure Hope back -- except just be himself. Liam suggested that Quinn and Wyatt be themselves, and then they'd see whom Hope would choose. Quinn said it was already obvious that the man for Hope was Wyatt.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Hope seemed to still be preoccupied with the pregnancy scare. Wyatt, preoccupied with what had just happened with Liam, said Hope wasn't pregnant and never had been. Wyatt complained that Liam didn't even know how to tow a camper, and Liam could have hurt Hope. Wyatt thought Liam was the crazy one, not Wyatt and Quinn.\n\n\nHope wished everyone could get along, and she wasn't just talking about Liam and Wyatt. She noted that their families were a mess. She said that when she had a baby, she wanted to give it a nurturing family, and as she'd taken the pregnancy test, she'd realized that all the tension between the families wasn't healthy. Wyatt thought it sounded like a message for Liam, not Wyatt.\n\n\nHope said that Liam had never done anything like \"that,\" but Wyatt insisted that Liam had been dogging them ever since they'd gotten together. Wyatt remarked that he'd never run so quickly in his life. Hope guessed that he'd really loved his truck. He replied that since their first meeting, he'd learned what he had to lose, and so he'd run as quickly as he could to get to her. He stated that he'd always be by her side no matter what they had to go through.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie was swamped with work and too busy to take a lunch with Donna. Donna said that Katie was dealing with everything -- except Brooke. Katie claimed that she didn't have time to put up with Brooke's vendetta. Donna informed Katie that Brooke and Bill were living together. Katie knew it, but she wanted to be left out of it. Katie asserted that all she and Bill shared together was a son.\n\n\nWhile the sisters talked, some of the staff entered to discuss a commission statement. Katie said she wanted to run it by legal before they used it in the \"dailies.\" After the staff had left, Donna asked what \"that\" had been about. Katie said she was being cautious, something Bill had never done as CEO.\n\n\nDonna tried to reason with Katie about Brooke. Katie claimed not to know who Brooke was anymore, but Donna replied that Brooke had said the same about Katie. Katie claimed to want to have a normal conversation with Brooke, but Brooke's words dripped with contempt.\n\nDonna recalled that Katie had asked Eric to demote Brooke and asked if Brooke had a right to be angry about that. Katie suggested that they make a list to decide who got to be angrier. Donna didn't understand why the in-love Katie would be angry.\n\n\nKatie affirmed that it was true that she was in love, and she refused to apologize for it. Katie guessed that Donna was upset that Katie had gone to Eric. Donna was, and she didn't understand what there was to worry about if Brooke was with Bill. Katie seethed that Brooke got to chance to have her cake and eat it, too, by being with Bill at home and with Ridge at work.\n\n\nDonna said Katie was reading too much into it. Katie recalled that she'd been \"reading too much into it\" when she'd questioned Brooke's feelings for Bill. Katie didn't want to put Donna in the middle of things, but she asked Donna to reveal whenever she heard that Brooke was up to something.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill and Justin boxed together on the terrace until Justin said he had to get back to work. Bill was jealous, and Justin said Bill had better find a way to get his job back before Spencer got into worse shape.\n\n\nBill complained about Katie's style of CEO. He noted that gossip sites had popped up everywhere, and he asked why Spencer hadn't covered Forrester's last showing. Justin urged Bill to set up a meeting with his sister while she was in town. Bill said Karen was ignoring him. \"Let me tell you something. Eventually, she's gonna pay for that,\" Bill added.\n\n\nJustin said Karen should hear Bill's ideas. Bill declared that Karen wouldn't hear even one idea from him until he got his job back. Justin told Bill to find his mojo so that their next workout could be at the Spencer gym.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Karen said that Brooke wanted Karen to fire Katie. Brooke replied that she wanted what was best for both families and for Spencer Publications. Brooke knew that it sounded harsh, but she wanted to make her case as to why Katie shouldn't be running Karen's family business.\n\n\nBrooke noted that Karen hadn't been answering Bill's calls. Karen replied that it was because Bill wanted his job back. Brooke suggested that Karen give it to him because he was the best person for it. Brooke added that Karen knew he'd find a way to get to be in charge with or without Karen's help.\n\n\nKaren stepped away from the table, and Brooke called Bill to invite him to Il Giardino. Bill said he'd already been there that day, but Brooke said, \"Please...\" and Bill agreed to return there.\n\n\nKaren returned, and Brooke recalled that Karen had unseated Bill to punish him for being with Brooke. Karen said she'd lost trust in his judgment. Brooke asked Karen to see what the choice had done to the company and if Karen could trust Katie's judgment, since Katie had become involved with Ridge.\n\n\nKaren cited that Katie had done good things and that the employees liked her. Brooke suggested that Katie head human resources, but Karen doubted Katie would remain if Karen gave Katie's job to Bill.  Brooke said it was because Spencer wasn't Katie's passion in life; however, it was Bill's passion.\n\n\nBrooke believed it took fire and intensity to run a business, but Katie just wanted to prove that she was right and that everyone else was wrong. Brooke asked if Karen really wanted that in a CEO.\n\n\nJust then, Bill arrived at the table, and looking at Brooke and his sister, he doubted that they'd just happened to run into each other. Karen and Bill told each other than Brooke had invited them to lunch, and as the siblings snipped at each other, Brooke asked them to just enjoy some time together. Karen tried to leave, but Brooke asked her to hear Bill out.\n\n\nBill asked Karen what had happened and why she'd turned on him. He knew that they'd had their problems, but he had supported her, been there for her and her family, and  made her money. He said that, in return, she'd taken the company, which was akin to kidnapping his child.\n\n\nBill felt that Karen had taught him the lesson she'd intended to teach, and he'd been wrong in his past treatment of Karen and Katie. He said he couldn't take that back, but he could learn from it.\n\n\nBrooke, who'd gotten close to Caroline senior upon her death, stated that family had meant everything to Caroline. Brooke was sure that Caroline would want her siblings to work together. Karen asked about the turmoil between Brooke and Katie.\n\n\nBrooke replied that Spencer Publications was Bill and Karen's family business, not Katie's. Bill asked if Brooke had called Karen and Bill together to convince Karen to reinstate him as the CEO, and Brooke replied that she had. Bill and Brooke smiled at each other. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam and Quinn quarrel about Wyatt and Hope. Brooke attempts to woo Karen into firing Katie and hiring back Bill. Wyatt tells Hope that he cannot stand the thought of losing her while Liam tells Quinn that he is the better man for Hope and that one day she will realize that. Katie pulls Donna into the middle of her fight with Brooke.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tells Quinn to get out or he will throw her out. She is just there to do damage control for her son to get Liam to back off. That is not going to happen. He emphasizes there is nothing she can do or say that will get him to give up on Hope; nothing! Quinn tells him that Hope doesn't need him to protect her. She needs a man and doesn't need some whiney little boy who throws temper tantrums every time he doesn't get what he wants. His father gave him a position in the company and just spoiled him. He should be grateful for what he does have and not hold onto what isn't his. She knows he thinks the worst of her and Wyatt. But she declares they are not evil. They may not be squeaky clean but when you have worked for so long and hard then it is not easy to be. They had to fight and claw and hustle their way to the top and she is not going to apologize for that and she's not going to let him judge her for that either. He went too far today. He scoffs that she is the last person who should be lecturing him about going too far. Quinn says do not compare the two. If she has made any mistakes at all it is because she has let her passion and ambition get the better of her. He tried to get Hope alone so he could beg her to get back to him. He says she is right ..all Hope is to her is ambition, a connection to one of the most prestigious companies in the world. She points out that FC works with them because they have an exceptional product. She and Wyatt have earned their respect .everyone except for Liam .which is a shame as she was hoping he could get along with Wyatt as brothers. Hope tells Wyatt that Liam is out of control. Wyatt agrees. That is exactly how he would describe it too \u0096 kidnapping her, stealing his camper but it is okay now as they are back in the office safe and sound. Hope adds and not pregnant and she could have been. And she realizes that Liam over-reacted. Wyatt adds and Liam calls him and his mom crazy. They don't know if Liam ever towed and RV before. He had no idea what he was doing and could have hurt Hope. Donna drops in on Katie who tells her she can not have lunch today. She has a million things to do. Donna says and the most important is to deal with Brooke. Katie says sorry, she has a business to run and can not think about Brooke and her vendetta. And that is what it is to get back together with Bill and then call her in the middle of the night to brag about it. She is surprised Brooke did not put her on the speaker phone so Ridge could hear it all too. So just leave her out of it. She and Bill have a son and that is all that they share. Every time she thinks the next time will be different. They will be able to have an understanding and have a normal conversation. But every time she is with Brooke every word out of her mouth drips with contempt. She's not that little kid anymore so Brooke doesn't get to talk to her that way. So why don't they make a list and see who gets to be angrier. She is in love with Ridge and she is not going to apologize to Brooke or anyone. Karen is shocked that Brooke wants her to fire her sister. Brooke says she wants what is best for both families and Spencer Publications. It sounds harsh, but she's not being vindictive. Katie just should not be running the family business. Karen should give Bill back his job and he will take charge. She only put Katie in charge to punish Bill for being involved with Brooke. Karen says she could not trust his judgment anymore. Katie has done a good job and the employees love her and she doubts she will stay on if she gives Bill her job. Brooke argues that SP is not Katie's passion, but it is Bill's and always has been. Justin tells Bill during a workout that the company numbers don't look good. He better hurry back to the job or there will be nothing to come back to. Justin says Karen is back in town. He needs to set up a meeting with her. Find his mojo and their next meeting will be at the Spencer Gym. Brooke calls Bill and asks how quickly can he get cleaned up and meet her at Il Giardino. He laughs and says he just had lunch there with Justin but he will meet her. Karen inquires and Brooke says it's just a project she is working on. Hope tells Wyatt that it would be great if everybody could get along. Wyatt says it would be awesome if Liam accepted their relationship but he doesn't see that happening. She says it isn't just about them and the pregnancy test. It's her mom and Katie, Rick and Ridge, even his mom; the families are a mess. When she does have a baby she wants to bring it into a family that is nurturing and supportive. While she was waiting for the test results it became very clear that all this tension and fighting isn't healthy for any of them. Wyatt says he hears her but it's more like a message for Liam, not him. He followed them to Hawaii, even down PCH to Emerald Bay. He's been dogging them ever since they got together. This time Wyatt says he was doing the chasing and he's never ran so fast in his life. Even faster than when he was in the forest and met her. Then she was just some girl he met in the forest ..beautiful, magical and devious. But he didn't know her or what he would lose if he let her get away. And now he does. It doesn't matter how fast he has to run, what kind of surprise he has to deal with or changes they have to make .he will always be there right beside her. Liam tells Quinn that he will tell her the reason he and Wyatt will never get along and it's not because he is jealous or judgmental like she says. It is because he and Wyatt are nothing alike. And in the end that is why Hope will pick him. Quinn points out that he begged her to come back and she didn't. Liam says that is only a matter of time. He has a philosophy that decency and honesty win out in the end; people tend to gravitate towards what's good. At least he tries. He doesn't have to do anything to lure Hope back; just has to be himself. She and Wyatt can be themselves and see in the end who's the most obvious Hope should be with. Quinn says it already is; it's her son. Katie tells Donna that she is upset with her because she spoke with Eric but there is nothing to worry about. He gave her the opportunity to have her cake and eat it too. Now she can have her claws in two men; live with Bill and work with Ridge. Donna thinks she is reading way too much into this. Katie says no after everything that happened. Remember the last time when she read too much into it is when she accused Brooke for having feelings for Bill and she denied it. She doesn't want to put Donna in the middle but if she knows things she needs to let Katie know. Bill walks up and asks Brooke and Karen what is going on. Brooke says he wanted to talk to Karen and she seemed reluctant to get on the phone. Brooke says they can talk business later; they should just relax and catch up. Karen starts to get up and leave and says this is not a very good idea. Brooke begs her to stay. Bill asks why did Karen turn on him.",
