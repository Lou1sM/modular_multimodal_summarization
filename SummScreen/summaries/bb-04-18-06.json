He worries to hear she ran into Nick while snooping in Jackie's boutique as she explains that she had to check to make sure no one would find what he had her install earlier on Jackie's computer. Megan asks him why he's doing this to Jackie and wonders if he's ever told her the truth about any of this.

When Brooke and Nick meet with Jackie, Nick assumes his father \"got to the judge\" because he allowed the story about Deacon to influence his decision about her bail. Jackie finally tells them that Massimo has offered to solve her problem if she drives a wedge between them. Asking them not to tell Massimo, Jackie warns Nick about going head-to-head with Massimo. Nick does just that and warns him to get his mother out of jail or else he'll start revealing some Marone secrets, spitting as he gives his father until the morning to act. Ridge slips into Brooke's place and makes a call to check on his surprise coming from Paris. Brooke is outraged again to find Ridge waiting for her at her home.

    "tvmega_recap": "Megan has temporarily angered Massimo for coming back to his office while Ridge was there. It becomes further apparent that they are more than just casual acquaintances or her just doing dirty work for him. He gives her an expensive necklace and puts it around her neck. She wishes they didn't have to hide their relationship. Nick and Brooke visit Jackie in jail and she warns them that Mass isn't that overt. He will find their weakness and work on it. He can do things that other people can't. They can wait him out, but they can not go head to head with him and win. Nick visits his father; barely missing Megan. Nick asks if he has anything to tell him about his mother? There is no deal, so he will have to work his methods on him. He says he used to be proud to call himself Massimo's son, but he doesn't feel that way any more. Mass tells him that his mother lost any rights to loyalty with him with that other man (Deacon) and he doesn't want Nick to go through the same thing with Brooke and Ridge. He doesn't want to see him go through that same pain. Nick states that it is sad to see what he really is \u0096 work, honor and family .he spits on the floor and tells him he has until morning! Brooke comes home to find Ridge ensconced there; having sent the kids away with Catherine. She's not happy that Ridge has yet again overstepped his bounds. Still, he makes his case again. She doesn't say that she loves Nick's face, his eyes, his hands, how he kisses her. She only keeps mentioning how dependable and trustworthy he is. He could be a security guard or a German Shepherd based on that. He states she is trying to fill a void, and it's not going to happen. The doorbell rings and Brooke tells him if this is Nick, she wants Ridge to leave. She opens the door and is shocked to see who is standing there. It's her dad ..or is it Bobby Ewing or Memorex?",
