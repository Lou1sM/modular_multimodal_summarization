    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Justin arrived early for an appointment with Katie. Katie had gotten an email from Justin earlier, and she hadn't understood what he'd been implying in it. Justin felt that he hadn't been coy. He wanted to do the best job he could for her, but it was difficult to do so with restricted access. Katie hadn't allowed him into her inner circle, and that had caused him problems.\n\n\nKatie decided that there was no problem because she was satisfied with Justin's work. Justin claimed that he could do much more. \"For me or for Bill?\" Katie asked. Katie told Justin not to pretend that his loyalty wasn't to Bill. Justin saw nothing wrong with sharing information with Bill, who, as a major shareholder in the business, deserved to be in the game.\n\n\nKatie didn't think that Justin should speak to her about what Bill deserved. Justin said that Bill had been ousted from his company, and not being there was killing him. \"Have a heart. I know yours is borrowed, but you can still use it,\" Justin quipped. The offended Katie scoffed at his audacity to speak to her that way. She said he was lucky to have a job, and he shouldn't push it.\n\n\nJustin noted that he and Katie had been friends, and he was her nephew's father. He asked if they could get over the animosity. Katie called it a character flaw of hers to be loyal to people who were not loyal to her. She was certain that Justin was no more than Bill's right hand. Katie asserted that she'd be insane to give Justin more responsibility after he'd drawn up those papers for Bill.\n\n\nJustin felt that it had been worth a shot at Bill's last chance to get the company back. Katie asked what would happen if there was another shot, and she advised Justin to look elsewhere for career growth, because after what Justin and Bill had done, she'd never trust Justin.\n\n\nJustin asked if Katie could forgive him for just helping a friend. Katie declared that he'd tried to con her. Justin said it had been about getting Bill what he'd deserved. \"My job? My son? No. Signing those papers was the worst mistake I've ever made. Thank God Brooke destroyed them,\" she stated.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Brooke reasoned that Karen and Bill's father had wanted his children to work together. Brooke said that Bill had worked in Los Angeles while Karen had worked in New York. It was no longer like that, but Karen could fix it by removing Katie and giving Bill back his job.\n\n\nKaren had thought that Bill and Brooke were just a fling, but Brooke going to bat for Bill made Karen realize that Brooke cared for him. Brooke was determined to fight for what she thought was right. Brooke felt that Bill had fought for her, and she was willing to fight for him. She said that the first step in making things right with Bill had been to reunite with him. The second step was getting his job back.\n\n\nBrooke conveyed that divorce could be hard with the splitting of custody and assets. Katie already had one percent of the business, and Brooke asked why Katie also needed his job. Brooke believed that Karen had had the right intentions and had been trying to support Katie, but Brooke wondered if it had been fair to Bill.\n\n\nBill chimed in to say that the time had arrived for Karen to support him -- the same as he'd done for her. He reminded Karen of how accepting he'd been when she'd been petrified of \"coming out\" to him. Karen appreciated it but didn't see what it had to do with business. He questioned why, if Karen really felt that personal feelings shouldn't affect business, he was sitting there and not in his office.\n\n\nBill asked if Karen could support him the same way he'd supported her. Karen relayed that she supported Brooke and Bill's relationship and appreciated Bill's acceptance. Karen was glad she'd been wrong in thinking Bill would react to her homosexuality the same way their father had. She didn't want to be wrong in choosing a leader for the company. Bill asked if she'd made it, and Karen said she had.\n\n\nKaren decided that she was going to stay with Katie. Brooke's mouth dropped open, but Karen stated that her decision was final and that there was nothing more Brooke could do about it. \"Are you sure about that?\" Brooke pointedly asked. Karen apologized and hoped Bill wouldn't hold it against her.\n\n\nBill snarled but said nothing, and Karen exited the restaurant. Bill thanked Brooke and quipped that Karen hadn't bothered to pay the bill with the money he'd made her. \"Typical,\" he grumbled.\n\n\nBill took off to pay for the lunch. Brooke flashed back to Bill showing her the papers that he'd tricked Katie into signing and about telling Katie that she'd replaced the documents with the Aspen leaves. Brooke then recalled Bill asking if she'd shredded or burned the papers.\n\n\nBrooke quietly reached into her purse and pulled out the papers that Katie had signed.\n\n\nIn the studio, Maya and Carter were discussing her worry about Oliver and Aly. As Oliver entered, full of worry that Ridge wouldn't like the newest photo shoot. Oliver was determined to impress Ridge before Ridge fired him for real.\n\n\nBefore taking off, Carter stated that the pictures were great. Maya remarked that Ridge couldn't do anything to Oliver with so many people in his corner. Oliver stated that anything could happen as long as he wasn't a Forrester or Logan. He added that Maya was lucky to be engaged to Carter, whose brother was a Forrester and a Logan. \"You're set for life. Wish I could say the same,\" he said.\n\n\nMaya secretly started recording the conversation with her cell phone and turned the topic to Aly. Oliver relayed that Aly was a nice girl, and he enjoyed hanging out with her. Maya added that Aly being a Forrester was just a happy coincidence. Oliver said he needed to hold on to his job, and he was willing to date the redhead at Forrester if it would help.\n\n\nOliver switched the subject to reshooting a dress because the pictures of it seemed too wholesome. Maya replied that \"wholesome\" wasn't far off target for HFTF, whose audience was girls like Aly. He replied that girls like Aly were innocent, but they still wanted to be kissed. He wanted to portray that in the photos and really show the Forresters what he could do for them.\n\n\nMaya assumed that Oliver wasn't just talking about behind the camera. Oliver replied that the Forresters were extraordinary, and if he could be a part of it, then he'd put up with Aly. He said Aly was nice enough and pretty enough. Maya warned that it would end badly if he was just using Aly. Oliver stated that Maya knew him, and he wasn't looking to hurt anyone. He said that if he benefited from Aly liking to hang out with him, \"then what's the harm?\"\n\n\nLater, Carter returned and noted that Maya was in a pensive move. He asked if Oliver had said anything. Maya told Carter to close the door and hear for himself.\n\n\nCarter listened to a clip from the recording but said it was taken out of context. Maya asked him to stop being a lawyer, and she played more clips. \"Put up with her?'\" Maya repeated from the recording. She declared that the recording was proof that Oliver was using Aly.\n\n\nIn her room, Aly smiled and wrote in her journal. She flashed back to kissing Oliver. The Darla vision appeared, and Aly excitedly discussed the kiss with Oliver. The vision said that Oliver really liked Aly. Aly wished Darla could meet Oliver, and Aly was nervous about having a guy liking her. Aly hoped that Darla would be watching over the couple. Darla said that Oliver saw how special Aly was, and with a guy like that, Aly didn't need Darla's help.\n\n\nLater, Oliver arrived at the Forrester mansion, but no one answered the front door. He wandered through the gardens until he discovered Aly by the pool. He drank in the sight of her long legs as she lounged in a chair. When he got her attention, she skipped over to him. Embarrassed to be hardly dressed in her one-piece swimsuit, Aly wanted to change her clothes.\n\n\nOliver told Aly that she was beautiful and shouldn't change a thing. He decided that she'd be more comfortable if he took off his shirt. Aly stammered and tried not to stare at him as she asked why he was there. She was sure it wasn't for a swim, because he lived by the ocean.\n\n\nOliver said that Aly wasn't located at the ocean, and he also needed her help with a project. Oliver wanted to change up some of the ways that he shot photographs. Aly was willing to help but reminded him that he was safe because her grandfather had put his foot down.\n\n\nOliver stared at Aly. He apologized and said he couldn't help it. Aly confided that she felt like a girl who, after finally being approached by the hottest guy in school, had no idea of what to say. Chuckling, Oliver noted that she wasn't a kid anymore. \"You're a woman now,\" he uttered, nearing her. Batting her eyes, she replied that no one had ever called her that. Oliver kissed her. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "At lunch Brooke continues to try and convince Karen that SP is her family business ..hers and Bill's. She knows they haven't always gotten along but their father wanted them to be a team, her out of NY and Bill out of L.A. But it is not like that now. Bill has been shoved aside and Katie is now CEO. That is not how it should be. But Karen can fix that ..remove Katie and give Bill his job back. Karen says she thought this thing with Bill was just a fling but now he sees that Brooke really cares for Bill .the fact that she is willing to fight so hard for him even though it will hurt her own sister. Brooke says he does not want to hurt her sister but putting Bill back as CEO is the right thing to do. She will fight for Bill because he fought for her and he was right. He never gave up. He's committed and they are going to be together. That is the first step; the second one is to get his job back. She adds that divorce is hard ..assets get split, custody arrangements but a job is a bit different. Katie has 1% of the company, she doesn't need Bill's job too. Bill says it is time for Karen to support him. She was petrified to come out to him afraid he would not accept her but he did. She says she really appreciates that but it has nothing to do with business. He says all the more reason if their personal life doesn't affect business then he should be back in his office and not here. Maya and Carter kiss but she is distracted. He says she is not there. She can't stop thinking about Aly. Carter adds ..and Oliver, she thinks he is playing her. She says yeah, the boss's granddaughter .job security, hello. She's not worrying, just observing. Carter leaves; Oliver walks in and tells Maya that he is not sure Ridge will like his latest shoot. The man tried to fire him already so he needs to impress him on this. Justin has a meeting with Katie. She says she got his e-mail but wasn't sure what he was implying. He says he wasn't being coy; he'd like to do the best job he can for her but he doesn't have full access. She's not allowing him into the inner circle and it's causing problems. She tells him not to worry, she does not have a problem with his work. He replies that he can do so much more. She asks for her or for Bill? Because they all know his loyalty is to Bill so do not try to deny that. Justin says Bill is a shareholder so he deserves to be part of the action. He was ousted from the company and it is killing him. \"Have a heart .I know yours is borrowed, but you can still use it.\" She's taken aback but tells him how dare he speak to her that way. He says he is sorry and wishes they could get along. They used to be friends and he is the father of her nephew. They need to get over this animosity. She says he is lucky to have a job here; he shouldn't push it. Aly flops on her bed, all bubbly and almost giddy. Her ghostmom speaks to her and says she likes to see that smile. Aly says Oliver kissed her again and it wasn't just on the hand. Darla says he really likes her and she wishes she could meet him. Aly would like that too and wants her to look over her. She's a little nervous having a guy interested in her. She says Oliver understands her and even why HFTF means so much to her. Darla says she will be with her every step of the way though she really doesn't need her. Oliver knows how special she is. Oliver wonders if Maya is trying to warn him about Aly again. She's cute, a nice girl and he likes hanging out with her. Behind her back, Maya turns on her Iphone and records the conversation. Maya says and Aly's family connections are just a happy coincidence. Oliver admits he needs to hold onto his job and if dating the red-headed Forrester for a bit will do it he is willing to do that. He says he'd like to re-shoot the sequence in the black dress .it's just a little bit too wholesome. He thinks there is a fine line. Girls like Aly have a certain innocence to them, but they still want to be kissed. He wants to bring that out in the photos. He wants to work harder to show this family what he can do. Maya comments that he's not just talking about behind the camera either. Oliver replies that the Forrester's are extraordinary people. If he could be part of it, yeah he would put up with Aly. She's nice enough and pretty enough. Maya warns him that if he is just using Aly it will end up badly. He says he is a good guy. He's not looking to hurt anybody. They like hanging out together so no harm. He says if your name is Logan or Forrester you have it made. She's lucky to have Carter. She says he is not a Forrester. Oliver says but his brother is and he's a Logan too so Maya is set for life. He wishes he could say the same about himself. Katie tells Justin yes they used to be family. He was married to her sister and he's the father of her son. And nobody will deny his value to the company. And it's her character flaw. She is loyal to those even when they are not loyal to her. But they all know he is Bill's right hand man and nothing more. She would be insane to give him more after he drew up the papers for Bill like his little puppet. So if Justin is looking for career growth, he better look elsewhere. She will never trust him or Bill again. Karen tells Bill and Brooke that no matter what she decides that she wants them to know she respects their relationship. Brooke is good for her brother. And she is grateful to Bill for his acceptance after years of her father making her feel ashamed of who she was. She thought Bill would do the same so she is glad she was wrong. But she doesn't want to be wrong about the company. She needs to make the right decision. Carter is back and Maya tells him to close the door. He can hear for himself why she is worried about Oliver. He thinks it is taken out of context but she asks him to listen to all of it \u0096 putting up with Aly. He is using her. This is proof. Oliver knocks on the front door at Eric's but no one answers. He goes around back and finds Aly by the pool in her bathing suit. She's happy to see him but embarrassed by what she is wearing and wants to go change. He calls her Miss F and says do not change a thing. She is beautiful the way she is. He says he knows what she needs and he came prepared. He lives at the beach but she is not there so he came here to swim. He's got this little project he is working on and perhaps she can assist. He wants to step up his game and be more creative in the way he is shooting. He comments what a great place this is. He'd get lost just finding the bathroom. He apologizes for staring but she is so beautiful. She grins that she feels like the nerdy kid who is finally talked to by the hot guy at school and she doesn't have the slightest idea what to say. He tells her she is not a kid anymore; she is a woman now. She says no one has ever called her that. He moves closer and kisses her. Justin asks Katie why she can't forgive him. He was only trying to help a friend. She says he conned her with the papers. Her job, her son .no signing those papers was the worst mistake she ever made. Thank God Brooke destroyed those papers. Karen says she has heard everything they have had to say. They are right. She needs to be thinking not only for the company but what is right for the families. She tells Bill she is sorry but she is going to stay with Katie. She really thinks it is the best choice for everyone. Brooke is aghast how she can do this. Karen says Brooke has made her case but her decision is final and there is nothing more she can do about it. She apologies to Bill and says this is the way it has to be. When she leaves, Bill thanks Brooke for what she tried to do. Brooke says she was so sure, but it didn't work. Bill says he will pay the bill. Typical of Karen that she couldn't reach into her pocket and spend some of the money that he made for her. Brooke thinks back briefly to the envelope with the dead leaves where the papers had been. She pulls the papers out of her purse and looks at them.",
