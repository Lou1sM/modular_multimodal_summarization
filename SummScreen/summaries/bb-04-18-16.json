    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge walks away from Dr. Wolin still thinking what he just said that he knew there was no way his son could be his. And he'd better come up with the cash or he will blow his horn. Brakes screech and Ridge looks back and the doctor is on the pavement hit by a truck. At the office Thomas continues to question Caroline of what is bothering her if she says it is not about Douglas. He tells her that she can tell him anything. Katie snarls at Brooke and says she thought she asked her not to tell Bill. Bill tells Katie do not blame Brooke as he would have found out about her drinking eventually. Katie says she is not sick and she did stop drinking but apparently that counted for nothing. She finally says okay if they want to hear the words, she is drinking and the reason she is drinking is the two of them ganging up on her. Bill says they are not and Brooke adds that she knows how hard it is as she still has moments when she is tempted. Katie turns on her and says drinking was never Brooke's real problem; it has always been men and one man in particular, the forbidden fruit, husband of her own sister. She knows if she had taken one more minute Brooke would have been in his arms. She has never got over him. But she knows she cannot be too obvious; she has to have a little compassion for her sis, Katie the pathetic lush. That way when the marriage does fall apart she won't feel so guilty when she is there for Bill probably in something silky and see through. Bill has had enough and he barks at her that is enough. Katie says it sure is and she has had enough of them trying to pretend nothing is happening when clearly it is. She tells Bill do not dare defend Brooke when it is obvious what she is doing. And now Brooke is hovering so Katie will never get better that way. And she can never get those words out of her head that Brooke is still in love with her husband. Brooke says this is getting nowhere and she will go. Katie cries for Bill not to put her in rehab, they can work this out together. He says they have tried but she needs some therapy. He wants his old Katie back. Somehow Brooke didn't really leave after all and she says she wants that too. Katie turns on her again and says Brooke is the problem. She would not be where she is now except for Brooke. Ridge comes in as Thomas is showing Caroline a design that he hopes his dad will consider for the next showstopper. He notices Ridge looks a little tense and asks if the meeting he had was rough. Ridge nods yeah and says he needs to spend some time with his wife and will look at Thomas's design later. Katie tells Brooke she can save her words of concern. She is not an alcoholic. And Brooke can apologize over and over because that is what she does \u0096 does something terrible, gets caught and then apologizes for it. And then everyone is supposed to go back and pretend it did not happen or rip their lives apart. Bill is stern again and tells her nothing has happened that cannot be fixed ..her problem with alcohol and her relationship with her sister. He loves her and is committed to their marriage and she should not doubt that. Katie says she does not want to talk about this in front of Brooke and that she needs to go. Brooke says okay and Bill walks her to the door. Ridge tells Caroline that Dr. Wolin tried to blackmail him and he must have been drinking and walked out into the street and got hit and now he is dead. She asks and he says he had nothing to do with it. And he took his secret with him and no one else knows so their secret is safe. Douglas is their son and Thomas never has to know. Bill walks back in the kitchen just as Katie lifts the bottle to her mouth. He tries to get it. She says after what just happened she needed something to take the edge off. He asks her nicely twice to give him the bottle and she won't put it down. Finally he grabs it and slams it into the sink breaking it. He says this is not about Brooke anymore; Katie has a problem with drinking. Katie says she has a problem all right but it's name is Brooke. She disrespected and disgraced her and she has every reason to be paranoid. Bill tells her that she needs to see her therapist. Katie says she does not need to have a therapist tell her it is inappropriate for Brooke to pop up unannounced to spend some time with Bill. He tells her that is not the way it was and can they just stick to the main issue \u0096 the drinking. Katie ignores that and asks Bill to hold her, all she needs is him .she cannot live without him.",
