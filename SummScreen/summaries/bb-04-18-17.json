Thomas admitted that Steffy had been right about Sally Spectra. Steffy agreed the Spectras had never changed.\n\n\nRidge lamented that Spectra had stolen one of their dad's favorites -- and Spectra had only changed the color. Brooke wondered how it had happened. Ridge agreed they'd had advanced security, but they had a Spectra working in the building as well. The Forresters blamed Coco almost immediately.\n\n\nRick worried that they had practically handed their designs over to Sally. Steffy asked if Thomas had any information. Thomas said he had shown up at Spectra at the end of the fashion show and recognized all the designs. He'd left, but he admitted that Sally had followed him and apologized.\n\n\nSteffy was surprised, and Thomas shared that Sally had wanted to make it on her own, but Jarrett had given her such a terrible review the first time she'd had a showing that she'd been desperate. Sally knew it didn't justify what she had done, and it was no excuse, but she was sorry.\n\n\nMaya made fun of Sally. \"Boo-hoo,\" Maya said. She suggested they contact Carter to see if he could do something to stop them from selling the designs and sabotaging the upcoming Forrester fashion show. Brooke noted that Eric and Stephanie had been unsuccessful in pressing charges years earlier because Spectra had tweaked the designs just enough to get away with it. Ridge refused to let them get away with it.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally was sorrowful that she had stolen from Thomas and his family. Shirley told her to suck it up because orders were pouring in. All they had done would pay off, and they would be able to pay off Shifty and start fresh as a viable business.\n\n\nSally said she would give it all up to have what she'd had with Thomas, but it was over. Sally lamented that Thomas had told her he loved her, and he'd said he would have helped her if she'd needed it. He'd had faith in her and her designs.\n\n\nSally wished she had never listened to Shirley. Shirley countered that Thomas would have dumped Sally anyway. It was just over sooner than she'd thought it would be. Sally was angry and wondered where Coco had gone. Shirley admitted that she had told Coco what they had done with the cameras. Sally was despondent. Shirley told her to cheer up because she had been the spark and the passion that would resurrect Spectra.\n\n\nSally said she was thinking of finding another way to spin it. Shirley told her to stop -- the orders were rolling in, and everyone knew the designs were copies, but she would not allow Sally to pull the plug over a fling with Thomas.\n\n\nSally said she could say it was all a publicity stunt as a tribute to the old days when Spectra had copied the Forresters. If she didn't fill the orders, she could make it work and keep Thomas happy.\n\n\nSally wanted to make and sell her own designs like she'd always dreamed of doing and survive on her own skills and success. Shirley disagreed. \"We did what was necessary. This is how the world works,\" Shirley said.\n\n\nSally said she made Spectra a dirty word. Shirley argued that it was a proud name that stood for hustle and moxie. She reminded Sally that they were not swordfish but rather bottom feeders.\n\n\nSally angrily told Shirley they were thieves, and they had ruined any possibility for Coco or Sally to rise above dishonesty. Saul interrupted and told Sally and Shirley that orders were pouring in and people loved the designs. Sally said she didn't want to know. Shirley told her to get with the program. Sally asked Shirley to leave. Sally stood alone in her office and shook her head.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Coco told R.J. that she was sorry. She had been set up. Her grandmother and sister had installed cameras in her jewelry, and that was how they'd had access to the Forrester designs. She felt awful.\n\n\nCoco apologized and left, but R.J. asked her to stay. He said he believed her and felt horrible that her sister and grandmother had treated her like that. He asked if they had said anything about using her to steal the designs after the show. Coco said Sally had run off to talk to Thomas, and her grandmother had acted like it was no big deal.\n\n\nR.J. hugged Coco and said he would tell his family. Ridge, Brooke, Thomas, Rick, Maya, and Steffy entered and chastised Coco for what she had done. R.J. and Coco tried to explain, but the Forresters were furious and told her to leave.\n\n\nR.J. tried to argue Coco's case, but she told him his family would never trust her again. She didn't blame them. Ridge insisted she leave. Thomas sympathized with R.J. but said their father was right. It was best for Coco to leave.\n\n\nCoco left, and R.J. followed her to the elevator. She slipped off the corsage he had given her. R.J. objected, but Coco turned away. She looked back and said she would never forget him. Ridge watched from down the hall.\n\n\n",

    "imdb": "An emergency meeting is held at Forrester Creations where the family discusses the situation and being robbed blind by the Spectras. Coco returns to the scene of her crime and faces R.J. who accuses her of misusing his trust by helping her family with their shady business. Coco admits that she was an unwilling spy as the jewelry Shirley gave her was equipped with a hidden camera. She is relieved to find out that R.J. fully believes her explanation that she had no idea of her role in all of this. As Ridge, Brooke, Steffy, Thomas, Rick and Maya furiously storm into the office, it is obvious that they are not as inclined in giving their intern the benefit of a doubt. In spite of the numerous orders that Saul is receiving, Sally regrets having listened to Shirley's advice that stealing the designs was their only option. Shirley tells Sally to get real and accept the fact that as an underdog one has to play dirty at times to get a chance to make it is in this life. Sally is still not convinced that all this was worth betraying her own ambitions as well as losing Coco and Thomas.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy calls the troops together and says they never should have let a Spectra in their building. Thomas says she is right about Sally too. RJ tells Coco that now he knows why he was not welcome at the showing but he does not know how she could do this. Shirley tells Sally that she needs help; the orders are pouring in and she cannot keep up. The showing was a success and Sally needs to focus on that. Forget Thomas, men come and go. When Sally says she does not care about the success Shirley tells her the cash will be flowing in and she will not have to worry about her future. Steffy rants on Thomas again and says it was his fault for bringing Sally aboard. Thomas admits that was a mistake but it was not Sally's intent to come to L.A. and steal from them. She got desperate. Shirley and Sally have it out. Sally says she is not going to give Thomas up, her first love and he loves her too. They stole the designs pure and simple so they have to pay now. She can just quit and not fill the orders. Shirley tells her she is out of her ever loving gourd. Ridge rants that he doesn't know what they will do on such short notice but they can try to press charges but that won't get them a new show in time. Brooke says Spectra has done this before and it is pretty much impossible to make a charge stick. Technically they did not steal; Spectra just got a picture of the gown and tweaked the fabric and color and made it their own. RJ believes Coco when she tells him that she was duped too as the necklace and brooch she wore showed them everything at FC. Saul explains to Sally that officially they are a hit and wasn't that the whole point whether she was fully on board or not in the first place. She says she wanted to make it on her own according to her own visions. Shirley says everyone else is happy now that they can feed their families so she needs to be onboard too. Steffy says she is not mad at Thomas but it is very frustrating. Thomas says he was a fool and made it so easy for Sally. As they discuss it, Ridge comes up with it must have been Coco, their inside plant, to get her hands on the designs. He and Steffy charge off to find her. He finds her and RJ kissing and calls her a thief and retorts that they are going to press charges. RJ says he does not know the entire story and asks him to wait and hear it. Sally berates her grandmother and says they were supposed to be better than this and now they are doing dirty work and she has betrayed the man she loves. Shirley says she is sorry her girls are going to hurt for a while but they are bottom feeders and they might as well get used to that. Sally says she needs to find Coco. Ridge still claims they let Coco in and she stole from them. She is a thief and they cannot trust her. RJ says Coco is as much a victim as they are. Rick says he will be happy to have security escort her out of here. Coco tells RJ she is so sorry. She leaves the building on her own with RJ right behind and tells her to wait. It does not have to be this way. He says once they know the truth she will be okay. She says he cannot keep defending her as it will drive a wedge between them. She says bye. She cries on the way down the elevator.",
