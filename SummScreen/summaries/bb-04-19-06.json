Ridge understands it is difficult for Brooke to see her father and confront her issues of abandonment.  Brooke reminds Ridge that her father betrayed her many times.  Brooke's father, Stephen interrupts, trying to explain why he came, but Brooke refuses to listen to what he has to say and orders him out of her house.  Ridge intervenes and tries to get Brooke to listen to her father.  Ridge explains that he would not have brought him here if he did not think it was important for their future.  Brooke says she does not need to listen to her father she already knows what he did to her and her family.  She remembers how hard it was on the family after he left them. As tears form in her eyes, she glares at Stephan Logan and accuses him of taking her childhood away when he walked out on them.  Ridge fears Brooke will never be able to forgive him for walking out on her until she deals with her abandonment issues.   He tells Brooke he has been in contact with her father for months but kept it secret because that is what Stephen wanted. Stephen explains that he knew Brooke did not want to have anything to do with him, but he needed to know how she was doing.  Brooke demands that he leave, but Ridge convinces him to stay while he tries once more to convince Brooke to listen.  Ridge tells her Stephen is a changed man and has come to help.  Brooke is doubtful. Stephen admits he is ashamed of the things he has done in the past, but says he is getting his life back together.  He tells Brooke he wants is to repair some of the damage he caused and help Brooke live the life she was meant to live with Ridge.  Stephen stresses to Brooke that he was the one who abandoned her, not Ridge.  Stephen is convinced that Ridge is the only man for Brooke and warns her not to let fear stop her from being happy.  He begs her to take Ridge back. Brooke looks upset and confused.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Nick barges into Stephanie's office and demands to know if she is responsible for his mother's arrest.  Stephanie denies having anything to do with it.\nNick thinks she did it in order to keep Eric and Jackie apart.  Stephanie tells him putting someone in jail is  \"not her style\" and if Eric wants a divorce, all he has to do is ask for it.  Nick is not convinced and thinks she and Massimo worked together.  Stephanie says she had nothing to do with Jackie's arrest and does not think Massimo did either.  Nick believes her but still thinks Massimo is responsible.  Stephanie thinks it will be hard to prove.  Nick says once he does there will be Hell to pay.  Stephanie defends Massimo saying he is just trying to protect Nick because he thinks he knows what is best for him.  Stephanie tells him nothing would make her happier than for he and Brooke to run away together, the farther the better.\n\n\nMeanwhile at Marone, Massimo calls Megan.  Megan is concerned that Jackie is being held in prison until her trial.  Massimo reassures her that their plan is starting to work and as soon as Ridge gets Brooke back Jackie will be released from prison.  Massimo thinks the timing for Ridge's plan is perfect with Nick so distracted with Jackie's situation. Megan wonders what Ridge's plan is.  Massimo tells her he does not know but he is convinced that Ridge will win Brooke back by the end of the night\n. \n\nAt the Federal Building, Nick visits Jackie and tells her he has given Massimo 12 hours to come clean on his involvement with her arrest.  Jackie appreciates Nick's determination but thinks it will be hard to prove Massimo was involved.  She warns him to be careful and not underestimate what Massimo is capable of.  Nick assures her that Massimo is the one who should be worried. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Nick drops by to see Stephanie and accuses her of working with Massimo to have Jackie arrested. Stephanie informs him that it has nothing to do with her. Stephanie adds that she would like Nick to be with Brooke and take her far away. Nick visits Jackie and tells her that she will be out of jail by the following morning, or else Massimo will have a war on his hands. Jackie fears for Nick. Megan calls Massimo to vent more guilt, but Massimo thinks now is the time for Ridge to strike in getting Brooke back. Brooke is furious with Ridge for bringing Stephen back to L.A. Stephen apologises to Brooke for lying to her in Paris, but realises that she still has issues with him leaving the family when she was a child. Stephen apologises and tells Brooke he wants to make up for all the hurt in the past, he also adds that she shouldn't use his mistakes to punish Ridge.\r\n",
    "yt": "\n\nBrooke is furious with Ridge for surprising her with a visit from her father. Brooke makes it pretty clear to both of them that she wants nothing to do with either of the two men. Stephen pleads with Brooke to hate him, but please just let Ridge in her life. Massimo convinces Megan to continue with their scheme and he will thank her properly in time. Nick informs Jackie that he is working on getting her out of prison hopefully by the following day.",
    "imdb": "\nStephanie denies Nick's allegation that she's in league with Massimo, and doubts if he is behind Jacqueline's arrest. Ridge explains he invited Brooke's dad Stephen so she could make peace with him and forget the bad example overshadowing their own bond, which takes quite some pleading from both men.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke turns her back on her father standing at the door. She lashes out at Ridge and doesn't want any explanation from her father that Ridge begs her to hear. She orders her father out. Ridge intercedes and begs her to hear him out. She cries that he is a coward who walked out on his wife and children and that man took her childhood away. Ridge adds just like he did. And Brooke had thought she had dealth with all these abandonment issues years ago, but she hadn't. That is why he'd called Stephen. Stephen makes his case that he was terribly wrong and never felt like he measured up. They would be better off without him. He claims he won't ask for her forgiveness now as he knows he has caused too much pain for that, but he does want her to be happy. Don't let fear keep her from that. Don't hurt her relationship with Ridge. Ridge tells her again that he wants to be that man. And he feels he has done everything he can to make it right. But, if there is more, then tell him. Stephen champions Ridge's cause too; he sees how much they love each other. Hate him, turn her back on him, but don't turn her back on Ridge for her dad's sins. Ridge is the ONLY man for her, so forgive him. Nick bursts into Stephanie's office at Forrester and accuses her of going over the top this time and demands to know if she had anything to do with his mother being arrested. Stephanie admits she does not like his mother, but she denies any involvement and even scoffs at his conspiracy theory against his father. Mass calls Megan and tells her that Jacqueline will not be scarred from spending a few days in jail. This will give Ridge time to secure his place with Brooke. Nick visits his mother in jail again and she tells him she appreciates his efforts. But, if his father did do these things, he would have covered his tracks and not appreciate anybody snooping around. Nick vows he doesn't care. She reminds him not to underestimate Mass or what he is capable of. Alone is his solitude, Mass thinks aloud that one son is distracted. The time for Ridge to work on Brooke is NOW.",
