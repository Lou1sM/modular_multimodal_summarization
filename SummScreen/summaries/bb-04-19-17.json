    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Bill flashed back to when he had given his sword necklace to Brooke, and he fondly recalled embracing Brooke at the opera house in Australia after she had decided not to marry Ridge.\n\n\nJarrett and Wyatt entered and said they had news. Bill assumed the Spectra fashion show had been an epic fail. Jarrett shared that buyers and reporters had been amazed at the quality of the show, but the Spectras had clearly ripped off the Forresters.\n\n\nBill was amazed that the Spectras had jumped on Forrester designs again and beaten them to the runway. Wyatt wondered what would happen when buyers found out the designs were Forrester knockoffs. Bill and Jarrett explained that no one cared because the quality and prices were attractive. Bill was frustrated. \"My skyscraper, dammit!\" Bill screamed.\n\n\nWyatt wanted Bill to calm down, but Bill was really angry that his dream was on hold. He refused to allow it to happen. Wyatt wondered if Thomas had something to do with the Spectras stealing designs from Forrester. Bill said Thomas was involved with Sally, but he would never have sold out his own family. \"She duped him,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill added that Sally had sold her soul and the relationship with Thomas so that Spectra could come out on top. \"This will turn around and bite them on the ass,\" Bill said of Spectra. He insisted Spencer would move ahead with their plans to take the building. \"That building will be bulldozed as planned,\" he said.\n\n\nBill threatened Wyatt and Jarrett that Spectra would not stop his dream. He wanted a crew on scene at Spectra to take down the building in the morning. He added that Wyatt had better not argue with him, and Jarrett had better give Spectra the scathing review Bill expected. Wyatt and Jarrett left.\n\n\nLater, Brooke showed up, and Bill was glad to see her. He said he had given her space, and Brooke said she appreciated it. Bill said that he had known Forrester would let her down. He guessed it had to be something pretty bad for her to cancel her wedding the night before it was scheduled. Brooke agreed. Bill asked if she wanted to discuss it, and she said she didn't.\n\n\nBill guessed that Ridge had begged for forgiveness. \"Don't tell me you forgave him,\" Bill said. Brooke said she had not. Bill wondered what Brooke wanted to discuss. \"I have something for you,\" she said, and she presented his sword necklace and put it around his neck.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Bill that when he had given it to her, he had told her it had guided him and given him strength. She thanked him because it had done the same for her.\n\n\nBrooke said she wanted to return the necklace to Bill because it had given her strength and returned her to him. She said she planned to take control of her life. She called the necklace a symbol of love and honesty and respect. \"And everything that you've shown me,\" she said. She promised to never take him for granted, and she called him her stallion. Bill made his horse noises, and they kissed and smiled.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke, Thomas, Steffy, and R.J. discussed what had happened, and Brooke noted that it had happened frequently with the original Sally Spectra.\n\n\nSteffy was angry, and Brooke said it didn't matter what they did. Ridge and Rick were meeting with Carter to see if something could be done, but in the meantime, they had to have a plan.\n\n\nSteffy said they had to scrap the designs and start over. Discussion turned to how they had to go back to the drawing board. Steffy and Brooke agreed they could give no credibility to Spectra. Thomas pointed out that it would be costly to start over, but Steffy said they had no choice. She refused to allow Spectra to get away with stealing a collection.\n\n\nBrooke and Steffy ordered R.J. and Thomas to have absolutely no contact with Sally or Coco. Thomas said there was no chance of that. Steffy acknowledged to R.J. that Coco had probably not been involved, and she understood that Sally had used Coco. R.J. defended Coco, but Steffy said there was nothing they could do, and he had to stay away from her and Spectra.\n\n\nThomas and R.J. met in another office, and R.J. professed that Coco had had nothing to do with stealing designs. Thomas said he wanted to believe Coco, but it didn't matter. No one would agree to allow her to stay on as an intern. R.J. objected, but Thomas said it was over for Sally and Coco. \"Move on, R.J. Let it go. It's what you need to do,\" Thomas advised, and he left.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally met with her sister, and Coco wondered how Sally could use her own sister as a spy, especially after Coco had made it clear that she had refused to be a spy. \"I thought you were being nice and giving me a gift with the jewelry,\" Coco said.\n\n\nCoco angrily accused Sally of never caring. \"I never thought my own sister would betray me,\" she said. Sally insisted that Coco had not been involved, and R.J. would understand. She had to tell him. Sally promised to tell him the truth.\n\n\nCoco said she had already told R.J. the truth. \"He believed me,\" Coco said. But she added that his family had thrown her out and never wanted to see her again. \"We had amazing opportunities,\" Coco said. Sally argued that it would have never lasted because they were Spectras. She parroted her grandmother's opinion that the Foresters would never have real feelings for the Spectras.\n\n\nCoco disagreed. \"You ruined it for both of us,\" Coco said. Sally confided that she had felt like a failure because their grandmother would not let up on how Thomas would leave her and she would never be good enough for him. Sally lamented losing him and stealing from him. \"The thing I regret the most is hurting you and ruining your dream,\" Sally said. \"You ruined both our dreams,\" Coco replied, and she left.\n\n\nSteffy showed up at Spectra and entered Sally's office. \"I just wanted to stop by and say thank you,\" Steffy said. She explained that Thomas and everyone would finally see Sally for who she really was. Sally said her sister, Coco, hadn't known anything about the plan to steal designs. She begged Steffy not to punish her. Steffy scoffed.\n\n\nSteffy told Sally that she had made a huge mistake. Thomas had really liked Sally, and the entire family had liked her. \"You had a place in his heart,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nSteffy wondered what had happened to Sally's desire to be a respected designer. \"Why would you resort to stealing?\" she asked. Sally explained that Spencer had given her the terrible review, and she had been desperate. Sally said that Steffy lived in a platinum world and wouldn't understand. However, Sally, her grandmother, and Coco had needed to scrounge for everything they achieved after her parents left.\n\n\nSteffy argued that Sally could have done things differently because, after her stunt, she had ruined any chance she had of being respected. Sally admitted she had thrown it all away, but she couldn't go back and make it right. \"All I can say is I'm sorry, and I'm disappointed in everyone, including myself,\" she said.\n\n\nSally added that on the plus side, Spectra was alive again, and she owed it all to Steffy and her family. She hoped someday she would have the approval of the Forresters and could at least be friends with Thomas. She hoped he would forgive her one day.\n\n\nSally hoped she could be friends with Steffy one day, too, just like their namesakes had been friends. Steffy glared at Sally. \"You're just trash. Don't come anywhere near my company or my family,\" Steffy said coldly. She also warned Sally to communicate the message to her little sister and her grandmother. Steffy turned and left.\n\n\n",

Bill's mood lightens up considerably when Brooke pays him a visit. His smile becomes even brighter when Brooke mentions that she wants to give him back his sword necklace because she has made her decision. Brooke declares her love to Bill and kisses him. Steffy rails into Thomas for ignoring her warnings regarding Sally. Steffy insists that R.J. and Thomas cut off all ties with Coco and Sally. Coco confronts Sally about being used as a mole after having made herself clear that she did not want to be a part of any scheme. Sally tearfully justifies her actions to her sister.

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill is looking at himself in the mirror in his office and thinking about when he took his sword necklace off and gave it to Brooke. Wyatt and Jarrett walk in and catch him and Wyatt asks if this is what he does all day. Bill quips that he has nothing better to look at. Wyatt says that Jarrett has good news. Jarrett tells Bill that Spectra Fashions ripped off FC. At a round table discussion Brooke tells the group that this is not good. RJ says Coco did not know about this. Steffy says all the Spectra's ruined their showing. Brooke says Carter is looking into what they can do about it. Steffy speaks up again that she warned all of them about Sally but they did not listen. Thomas says he trusted Sally but it was a massive mistake. Coco comes back to Spectra and confronts Sally. Sally replies that she will tell all at FC that Coco had nothing to do with this but Coco says it is too late. They never want to see her again. And Sally even broke up with Thomas because she betrayed him by stealing and could not look him in the eye. They had two amazing Forrester guys and Sally messed that up. RJ believes her but the others in charge do not. Sally says she made a bad decision and now is so sorry. Grams was pushing her and she never felt good enough. But the thing she regrets the most is hurting Coco and ruining her dreams. Bill is amazed that Spectra got to FC again. Jarrett says the public does not care that they are knockoffs as long as they get an elegant gown at affordable prices. Spectra Fashions is not going anywhere. Bill grouses at him that he has the gift of stating the obvious and there goes his new skyscraper, dammit. Brooke says they will have to wait and see what the lawyers say. Steffy is sure they will have to scrap their whole collection. Even though RJ says they made changes so they are not identical, Steffy says they are enough it would be a big risk. She thinks they have to cut their losses and go back to the drawing board. They are not going to let Spectra get away with this. Sally tells Coco that she is sorry so just let her please explain. Coco laments to her that she told her she did not want to be a spy but she used her anyway with the hidden camera inside the necklace and brooch. She thought she was just being nice with those gifts but she only cares about herself. Maybe she is naive but she never thought her own sister would betray her like this. Bill tells Wyatt that Thomas, the junior dressmaker, would not steal from his family. It had to be Sally that duped them. This is going to be more than stabbing someone in the back. It is going to come back and bite her in the ass. He orders Jarrett to go ahead and write his scathing report, minimize all of Spectra's accomplishments and then Wyatt can go ahead with their wrecking plans ..do not dare cancel that. Steffy tells them one thing is for certain, they cannot have contact with either Coco or Sally. Thomas says no problem, but RJ does not understand why Coco is being punished. She is just as much a victim as they are. Steffy says she will not let Sally get away with this. No one messes with her family. Thomas tells RJ that no matter how much he pleads or begs, Coco's time here is done. Thomas says that he wants to give Coco the benefit of the doubt but he has cut Sally from his life and RJ needs to do the same with Coco. Steffy marches into Spectra and looks around at the empty offices until she spies Sally sitting behind her desk. Steffy says she just wanted to stop by and say thank you for the disgusting stunt she pulled and now her brother sees her for who she really is. Then she gloats - big success, wow! But if she is banking on this being a thorn in Forrester's side, ain't gonna happen not with her in charge. Sally gets right to the point and says Coco did not know of any of this and is just as upset as Steffy is. So go easy on the kid and not punish her. Steffy says Sally made a huge mistake but it won't hurt Coco any more as she is no longer welcome at FC. Sally tries to explain that Steffy would not understand since she came from a platinum world with that world at her feet. Things come easy for her but not for the Spectra's. They have had to scrounge and scrape for everything they have. She says she tried to stay legit but when things get tough you do what you have to do. Spencer Publications ruined any chance she had of being legit with a bad review of her first showing. She cannot go back now and the only thing she can do is say she is sorry. She knows she has disappointed Steffy, Thomas, Coco and most of all her own self. She says with grit and determination that Spectra has been reborn and she owes it all to Steffy's family. And Steffy's approval means everything to her and one day she will earn that. And maybe someday Thomas will forgive her and they can at least be friends, she would like that. Steffy fires back that Sally is not her friend and she does not want Sally anywhere near her or her family. She is trash and any association she had with her family is officially over. Brooke shows up at Bill's. He says he does not know what happened but he does know that Forrester lived up to his history and they are no longer together. The night before her wedding it must have been pretty bad. She doesn't want to tell him the details only that she did not forgive him. Bill is pleased and asks then why is she here. She pulls out his necklace and places it around his neck. She reminds him that his strength comes from the necklace so she is giving it back to him. She's taking control of her life and will never take him for granted for all the things he taught her. He puffs up his chest and whinnies like a stallion. He says it is a thoughtful gift and he loves it. She puts her arms around his neck and says she loves him ..and they kiss.",
