    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke checks with her doctor by phone to make sure the sedative she is thinking of taking isn't too much. Nick rushes in and finds her still very shaky from her visit with her dad. And he's sure that Ridge has his own agenda. If Ridge makes another man look worse than he, it only bolsters himself in Brooke's eyes. Brooke tells Nick that she asked her father to go back to Paris. He hopes that was the right thing to do. He knows that Ridge and his old man are working in cahoots to keep them apart, and they must not know that just isn't possible. He tells her he has to go wrestle a bull and she sends him off to do that. Sally gets a little testy with Megan over office duties. Stephanie sees this and questions Megan about her future with Forrester and if there is someone new in her life, something more important than a career at Forrester? Megan confides there is, something she just wants to keep to herself for now. Ridge and Stephen return and just let themselves into Brooke's house. Stephen is reluctant since Brooke had asked him to leave. Ridge says she is planning a future with Nick, so it can't get any worse. Ridge goes to find Brooke, leaving Stephen alone downstairs when Hope wanders down and they meet. He tells her he is her grandpa from Paris and he's sorry he's been so busy, he hasn't taken the time to come see her. He wants to make up for that. Brooke overhears some warm, fuzzy spots that he relates to Hope, how she is like her mother. She dismisses Stephen and insists that he go back to Paris. She's glad he met Hope because it's never going to happen again. Nick bolts into his father's office and chastises him again for choosing one son over the other and he wants his pop to get his mother out of jail. He begins to trash the office of busts, pictures, all for show ..and then he takes off his Marone ring and slams it on the table, saying the Marone Dynasty is garbage to him. Mass loses control and slaps him. Nick's parting words is that he gave Mass a chance to save himself, and he didn't take it remember that! Misty-eyed, Mass picks up the ring as Nick leaves. Ridge helps his cause by telling Brooke he thought she needed to get past her past and talk to her dad. That is the reason they came back. She states he's not helping her but himself. She orders her dad and Ridge to leave. She has the future she wants with Nick. Stephen sees how futile it is and tells Ridge right now Brooke doesn't need him. She really needs him to leave. He goes, but comes back and gives her one big hug, both shedding tears.",
