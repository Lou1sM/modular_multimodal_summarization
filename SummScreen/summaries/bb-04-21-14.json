    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's office, Wyatt was still disconcerted about the pregnancy scare, but Quinn said an unplanned pregnancy could be the start of something wonderful. She added that some girls never recovered from it, but she'd been lucky to have money and a passion to make beautiful things. Quinn stated that Wyatt was the most beautiful thing she'd ever made.\n\n\nWyatt had been terrified to hear about a pregnancy and then disappointed to hear that it wasn't true. He said it was something he'd had no idea he could want so much, \"but now I do.\"\n\n\nQuinn asked if he and Hope had been on the same page about what would happen if Hope had been pregnant. Wyatt skeptically replied that he thought so. Quinn asked if he'd proposed to Hope. Wyatt became defensive and said one didn't ask that question without being sure of the answer.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to do detective work to find out how Hope felt, but Wyatt was adamant that they wouldn't do that. Quinn then revealed that she'd visited Liam's beach house, and she \"may have\" physically assaulted him. Wyatt asked why in the world his mother would do that.\n\n\nJust then, Liam entered, saying he'd like the answer to that, too. Quinn said he'd deserved it for kidnapping Hope, and Liam asked if Wyatt was okay with Quinn assaulting Liam on Wyatt's behalf. Wyatt told Quinn that he'd do the assaulting from then on.\n\n\nQuinn wondered why Liam was there in a place where he had no friends, and Liam asked why she liked breaking into his house. Liam and Quinn bickered with each other until Wyatt decided to give his mother a break by speaking to Liam alone. Quinn reluctantly exited.\n\n\nWyatt said that Liam was free to look for Hope, who hadn't taken kindly to being kidnapped. Liam retorted that she'd liked the thought of being tied to Wyatt for life even less. Wyatt claimed that it wasn't what she'd said, but Liam quipped that Wyatt only heard what he wanted to hear.\n\n\nLiam said that Wyatt thought the stories in his head were true and that Liam was a clown who no one could love. \"Well, guess what, Wyatt? Hope does, and you just scared her into remembering that,\" Liam asserted. Wyatt preferred to believe that Hope was just too nice to Liam, but Liam decided that Wyatt was just scared and whistling in the dark.\n\n\nLiam insisted that Hope didn't want to lose him, and she'd find what it would take to not lose him. Wyatt called Liam year-old gum that was stuck to Hope's shoe and said she'd given up on trying to scrape him off. Wyatt asked if Liam planned to issue a list of demands to Hope. Liam revealed that he had just one demand -- equal time with Hope.\n\n\nWyatt scoffed, asking if Liam thought Wyatt was seriously going to share Hope. Liam asked if Wyatt really thought it was up to him. Liam declared that Wyatt had tried to take as much as he could take, but it had turned out to be too much.\n\n\nIn the Forrester CEO office, Hope sought out her mother to reveal that she'd been a little freaked out earlier. Brooke put away the papers with Katie's signature on them, and Hope stated that she'd thought she'd been pregnant. Hope told her mother that she was sure that it had been a false alarm, and she'd never thought something like that could happen to her.\n\n\nBrooke said that Hope had to be very careful about contraception unless she was absolutely sure that she wanted to be a parent. Hope knew that and said it had gotten her to thinking.\n\n\nHope told Brooke about what had happened with the camper, and Brooke was upset because it sounded dangerous. Hope stated that Liam had been responding to another kind of danger. \"Mom, I could have lost him for good,\" Hope said. Though Hope wasn't committed to Liam or even ready for a big commitment, Hope also wasn't ready to think of a future without Liam in it.\n\n\nBrooke asked how Wyatt had responded to the false pregnancy. Hope replied that he'd said the right things. Hope felt that a baby didn't fit what she and Wyatt were together, and to have one, they'd have to change. Hope said they had adventures, and Brooke replied that a baby was a big adventure.\n\n\nHope admitted that she did want a baby, but not right then. Brooke observed that Hope was happy and carefree in the unpredictable love with Wyatt, and with Liam, she was careful and cautious. Hope figured that a lot of it had been her, and if she'd been more open about life, Liam might not have turned to Steffy. \"Or maybe that wouldn't have made any difference at all,\" Hope reasoned.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Quinn was checking messages at Pam's desk when she overheard Hope in the CEO's office, telling Brooke that Hope had to do things differently and that all \"three of us\" did. Hope had to accept facts and feelings, like that she loved Wyatt. Brooke asked if Hope was really in love with Wyatt, and Hope said she didn't know the distinction anymore.\n\n\nTo Hope, Wyatt was sexy and impulsive in good and bad ways, and she'd had some of the most romantic moments of her life with him. However, there was always an element of fantasy with Wyatt, due to being on adventures away from everyone, and Hope questioned if it was actually real.\n\n\nQuinn grimaced outside the door as Hope said that a possible pregnancy had been very real. When Hope thought of marriage and children, she thought about Liam, and it was how Liam thought of her, too. Hope didn't know what do to, but she doubted Liam would put up with it much longer. She didn't think she could ask him to, either. Brooke asked if Hope thought she'd break up with Wyatt.\n\n\nIn the studio, Carter didn't necessarily think that Oliver had \"come off well\" in the recording, but Carter didn't think Maya had, either, for recording it. Maya asked if it was okay with Carter that Oliver was taking advantage of a na\u00efve, young girl, but Carter asked what advantage Oliver was taking.\n\n\nMaya said that the Forrester's wealth was obviously the main attraction. Carter said that what was obvious to him was that Oliver was willing to let Maya think so. Carter suspected that Oliver was doing that because he was attracted to Maya.\n\n\nCarter couldn't blame Oliver for being attracted to Maya, and Carter reasoned that a man couldn't let a woman that he was attracted to know that he thought any other woman in the world might also be attractive. Maya didn't believe it, and Carter asked how she'd feel if he said he worked out in the sky lounge just to watch Madison do yoga.\n\n\nMaya frowned as if she was hurt, and Carter said no man of intelligence would risk making a woman feel what he'd just made Maya feel. Carter claimed that it was chivalry, and it had been all that Oliver was doing when Maya had recording him talking about Aly. Carter said that when a man was attracted to a woman, everything that the man said had to be filtered through that lens.\n\n\nBy the Forrester's pool, Oliver wanted to know where he could change clothes for their underwater shoot, but he said that he'd go if it felt weird to Aly to be alone with him. Aly welcomed him to stay and change in the pool house. Oliver remarked upon how wonderful the estate was, but she was embarrassed by her blessings because other people had so little.\n\n\nOliver didn't think she should feel that way because Eric had worked for everything that the Forresters had. Oliver said that Aly was beautiful and at home there. Aly shied away from the compliment, and he guessed that she didn't want him to say such things. Aly replied that he could say whatever he really meant.\n\n\nOliver showed Aly how to work his camera, but Aly frowned at the picture he took of them. \"Oh, come on,\" he said and quickly kissed her. Oliver asked if she was ready to take a swim.\n\n\nA song played as Aly and Oliver swam around the pool, taking video and photos of themselves playing underwater. They kissed beneath the water, and when they surfaced, they kissed again.\n\n\nAfterward, Oliver and Aly rested on the pool steps, and he exclaimed that he was going to \"kill\" the cruise and swimwear shoot. He doubted that Forrester had ever done anything like an underwater shoot before, and Ridge had to become impressed. Aly insisted that Ridge wasn't going to fire Oliver. He kissed her again, and they stared at each other. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "In her office, Brooke looks over the papers Bill had Katie sign. But she stuffs them in her purse when Hope walks in. Hope confides in her mother that for a short while she thought she might be pregnant. Brooke says she has to be very careful about contraception unless she is very sure she is ready to be a parent. Hope says she knows and that has really got her to thinking. Wyatt tells his mother the same thing. It was a scare but Hope is not pregnant. He admits he is having a little trouble figuring out how he feels about it. Quinn says an unplanned pregnancy doesn't have to be the end of the world. It could be the beginning of something wonderful. She says she was lucky. She had a little bit of money and a driving passion to make beautiful things ..and he certainly was the most beautiful thing she ever made. He admits he was terrified when Hope thought she was pregnant but then disappointed when she figured out she wasn't. He didn't know he'd want it so much as he does. She asks if he proposed or if they thought what would happen if she were pregnant. He says no Hope knows how he feels. Quinn says but a woman likes to hear it. He opines that you don't ask that question unless you are very sure the answer is going to be yes. She asks if he would like her to talk to Hope. He says no emphatically. She keeps pushing that she would not mention a baby but just have a casual conversation with Hope about other people's babies. Again he keeps telling her no and no means just that \u0096 no. She says then there is something she needs to tell him. She went to the beach the other day and ended up at Liam's. Wyatt says please don't tell him there is a body to dispose of. She says don't get dramatic. No, but she did physically assault him .not with a shovel but with her hands when she pushed him. Wyatt asks why just as Liam opens a closed door and says he'd like to hear the answer to that too. He asks Wyatt if he is okay with that with Quinn coming to his house and assaulting him on Wyatt's behalf for kidnapping Hope. Wyatt turns to his mother and says if there is any more physical assaulting to be done she can leave it to him. Maya and Carter listen to her secret recording of Oliver and she is sure he is just using Aly to keep his job at FC. Meanwhile Oliver kisses Aly and asks if he can change in the pool house so they can do some underwater shooting. She's a little nervous but tells him to stay when he says if she is afraid for them to be there alone that he will go. Brooke is not happy to hear about the kidnapping of Hope. Hope begs her not to make this into too much as Liam really was worried about the pregnancy. And she realizes she can lose him and she's not ready for that either. Wyatt said all the right things but she is not sure what she would have done if the tests came back positive. It just wouldn't have fit in with the way she and Wyatt are with so much fun and adventure. They'd have to change. She does want a baby in the future but just not right now. She thinks she was probably just too uptight when she was with Liam. Brooke admits she is much more carefree now, with Liam she was more cautious and careful. He's been steadfast and loyal now but it's up to her to decide if it is too late. Quinn asks Liam why is he here. He doesn't work at FC, has no friends there so why is he there. Wyatt asks his mother for a few minutes also with Liam. She doesn't want to leave. He says she is though. Wyatt tells Liam that he is not going to apologize for Quinn. Liam says of course not, that would be tacky since she does all of his dirty work. Wyatt tells him to feel free to go find Hope and grovel as she did not like being kidnapped. Liam says and she also did not like the idea of being tied to Wyatt for a lifetime either. Wyatt offers that Hope does have a sentimental attachment to Liam and she just doesn't want to hurt him. She's too soft hearted to just cut him off. Liam says all this time he just thought Wyatt was pushy but now he sees that he is scared. He has no doubt that Hope doesn't want to lose him and she is about to find out soon what it is going to take not to lose him. Wyatt says Liam is like year old gum stuck to the bottom of a shoe. Hope is trying to scrape him off. Liam says he'll see. He doesn't have a long list of demands; just one but it is non-negotiable \u0096 equal time. Wyatt scoffs, like he really is gonna share her. Liam says it is not up to Wyatt. He says Wyatt took about all he could take and it proved to be too much. Oliver and Aly enjoy their underwater shoot and continue kissing. Quinn stops at the desk to glance through the phone messages and overhears Hope and Brooke talking so she leans in closer to the door. She hears Hope say some changes will have to be made. There are feelings she has to accept. She loves Wyatt but there is always the element of fantasy when they are away from everything and everyone and she has to ask if that is real. And when she thinks about marriage and children, she thinks about Liam and he is thinking that way too. She doesn't know what she is going to do but she doesn't think Liam will put up with it much longer or that she can ask him too.",
