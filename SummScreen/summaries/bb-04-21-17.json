    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the kitchen at the mansion, Ridge agreed with Quinn that whatever they'd had between them was over. Quinn wished he could be happy, too, and Ridge replied that he would be once he got Brooke back. Quinn felt guilty that she had her marriage, but Brooke and Ridge didn't have theirs. Ridge said he and Brooke would end up together. He had to believe it. Quinn touched his shoulder and said she'd believe in it, too.\n\n\nIn the living room, Katie began to feel as if she were in a horror movie because people kept disappearing on the way to the kitchen. Eric joked that it was \"Nightmare on Willow Lane, Part Two: Stephanie's Revenge.\" When Katie offered to go to the kitchen and call off the honey search, he said they weren't supposed to split up, according to horror movie rules. Besides, he knew how much the Logan girls liked honey, he added.\n\n\nKatie exclaimed that they'd finally returned when she saw Quinn and Ridge enter the living room. Quinn and Ridge told Eric and Katie about the honey mishap that had waylaid them. While the others had tea, Ridge put on his jacket to leave. Katie told Eric that his wife was hiding something and asked Quinn if she'd tell him what it was.\n\n\nAmid the curious looks in the room, Katie revealed that Quinn had offered her a job at Forrester. Ridge was surprised to hear it. Quinn said she hadn't been keeping it from any of them. She just hadn't had the chance to discuss it with Eric yet. Quinn wouldn't call it a job offer. It had been more like Quinn just talking out loud. Eric loved the idea and asked what Quinn had in mind.\n\n\nQuinn said she hadn't talked to Eric about it yet because she wanted to make sure that wherever Katie would land would be a good fit. Eric wanted to talk about it more later but announced that he and Ridge needed to get to the office. Quinn was surprised Eric wanted to go back to the office that night. Eric explained that he and Ridge had to make a new collection in record time, and he looked forward to discussing Katie's job offer more.\n\n\nAs Eric exited the house, Ridge stated that he'd be right behind his father. The moment the door closed, Ridge asked Katie and Quinn what was going on. Quinn readily announced that Katie was blackmailing her. Katie called it a lie. She said Quinn had been the one to bring up the job offer, probably to keep Katie quiet; however, it wasn't blackmail.\n\n\nRidge asked why Katie would go along with it. Katie didn't know why she wouldn't and cited that she'd been the CEO before. He asked if that was what she was looking for -- to be CEO again. Katie suggested PR or marketing. She was sure they'd find something. He asked why she was doing it. Katie replied that she'd been meaning to go back to work.\n\n\nNoting that there were plenty of places to work, Ridge asked if Katie was trying to keep an eye on him and Quinn in hopes that they'd betray Eric. Katie asked why she'd hope for that. Ridge asserted that there was nothing going on between Quinn and him, and Katie knew it. Katie asked what the point of it had been and if he'd been satisfying his ego.\n\n\nRidge acknowledged that some of it had been about that. \"Some?\" Katie questioned. Ridge replied that the very questioning and threatening attitude Katie had just exhibited was the reason he didn't want her at Forrester. Katie replied that she wasn't threatening them, and then she asked how she was threatening them.\n\n\nRidge reminded Katie that they'd once cared for each other and had been engaged. He asked what she was doing. Katie claimed to still care about him and to be just accepting what Quinn had called an olive branch. The rest was in his imagination. Quinn asserted that Ridge was not imagining the blackmail. Katie exclaimed that it wasn't blackmail.\n\n\nKatie said that Quinn could see it as an insurance policy. If Quinn kept Katie happy, Katie would keep Quinn's dirty little secret. Quinn stated that she didn't need an insurance policy and threatened to tell Eric herself that very night. Katie goaded Quinn, saying to do it as soon as Eric walked back in the door. Ridge decided that no one was telling anyone anything.\n\n\nRidge agreed to find Katie something at Forrester, but first, Katie had to accept that there was nothing between Quinn and Ridge. Katie asked why Ridge wasn't either fighting for Brooke or with Brooke at that moment. Ridge replied that Brooke wasn't ready. Katie said the Ridge she knew was neither patient nor without a woman.\n\n\nRidge declared that Brooke was the only woman in his life. He hoped that Brooke knew that he was the only man for her. He understood that Bill was trying to creep back into Brooke's life, but Ridge refused to give up on Brooke. Katie hoped it was true. She didn't want to see Eric hurt.\n\n\nRidge asked for time alone with Katie. Quinn agreed, saying she'd see one or both of them at the office the next morning.\n\n\nOnce Quinn had gone, Ridge asked Katie why she was doing it. Katie claimed she wasn't doing anything, and Ridge was the one who'd kissed his father's wife. Ridge pointed out that it was in the past, and he was paying the price for it. Though Brooke wasn't answering Ridge's calls or messages, he believed that they could put their family back together.\n\n\nKatie asked about Quinn. He replied that he wasn't interested in Quinn. There was just one woman in Ridge's life; it was Brooke, and he vowed to get her back.\n\n\nIn Bill's candlelit kitchen, Bill entered, and Brooke exclaimed that she wasn't ready. She wanted five more minutes. Taking her into his arms, he said they'd waited long enough.\n\n\nBecause she'd just put their dinner in the oven, Brooke served appetizers with Bill's favorite single malt scotch. She also had sushi and the finest caviar. She said she was grateful to be back with Bill, who'd never given up. He asked how he could ever give up, and she said she'd just been conditioned to feel and expect it. \"Not by me,\" Bill replied.\n\n\nAs a flashback of times the couple had together played, Bill said that after all they'd been through, and even though he'd accepted that she'd marry Ridge, there had never been a possibility that he'd give up on them. Brooke stated that Bill had been there for her when Ridge had let her down, just as Bill had promised. Bill replied that it was because his promises meant something.\n\n\nBrooke conveyed that she was back where she belonged, and so was the sword necklace. Bill asked if she knew what it meant to him that she'd returned to him and had been the one to put the necklace back on him. The two expressed their love for each other and kissed.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of dinner, Bill thanked Brooke. She tried to get him to eat seconds, but he said he couldn't wait any longer. Brooke told him that he'd have to, and Bill balked, warning her not to delay him with things like doing the dishes. She wanted him to count to a hundred while she went upstairs. He agreed to count to fifty. \"Slowly,\" Brooke instructed.\n\n\nBrooke said to trust her, and it would be worth it. As she left, Bill counted, \"One...two...three, four!\"\n\n\nAfter counting to forty slowly, Bill entered his bedroom with his hands over his eyes and asked if Brooke was ready. From the bathroom, she announced that she was. Bill uncovered his eyes and saw a money symbol made of hundred dollar bills on the bed. Brooke exited the bathroom in a teddy made of paper dollar bills. On the dollar bills was printed Bill Spencer's face.\n\n\nBill said that Brooke had combined his favorite things into one hot, sexy package. Brooke asked if he was ready to cash in. \"Oh, yeah,\" he uttered, and they kissed. Brooke stopped Bill because there was still a gift for her to give him. He said that she was his gift.\n\n\nBrooke walked over to an object with a cloth over it. She whipped off the cloth and revealed a statue of a rearing horse. Brooke said the life she wanted was in her stallion's corral. She wanted to spend the rest of her days rewarding him for his loyalty to her. She asked what Bill thought, and Bill neighed. Brooke said she wanted to spend the rest of her days as his wife. Bill asked if she meant \"filly.\" She said, \"Yeah, that, too.\"\n\n\nBrooke opened a box, revealing the sword ring inside. She wanted to see it back on her finger and asked Bill if he'd marry her. Bill replied that there was nothing he wanted more. He placed the ring on her finger and said he'd be honored to be her husband. They expressed love for each other and kissed.\n\n\n",
