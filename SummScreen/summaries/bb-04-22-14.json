    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke and Hope discussed that Hope had experienced a pregnancy scare, and Hope had realized that she wasn't ready to lose Liam or Wyatt forever. Hope recalled that when Steffy had been pregnant, Hope had felt she had lost Liam forever.\n\n\nBrooke asked Hope what she wanted to do. \"Honestly, Mom, I have no idea,\" Hope answered. Rick interrupted and mentioned that he had seen Quinn outside the office, and Quinn had looked unhappy. Rick asked about Liam kidnapping Hope, and Hope told him to forget about it.\n\n\nHope thanked her mother for listening, and Hope left. Rick asked Brooke about Ridge. Rick was happy that he had not seen Ridge since Ridge's recent attempts to take over the presidency at Forrester.\n\n\nRick added that he'd heard Katie was angry about Eric's decision to name Ridge and Brooke co-vice presidents. Brooke said that Katie had demanded that Eric change his mind about Brooke and Ridge. Rick said it had been unlike Katie, but Brooke disagreed. Brooke reminded Rick that Katie had been on a power trip after she'd taken over at Bill's company.\n\n\nBrooke added that she might be able to return Bill's company to him. But Rick noted that hurting Katie again could be the end of their relationship. Brooke said that Katie had stolen Ridge, and Brooke had stolen Bill.\n\n\nRick noted that Bill had cared for Brooke in ways that Ridge never had, and Rick understood that Brooke and Bill had a special bond. Brooke maintained that someone had to stop Katie. \"It can't go on like this. It has to end,\" Brooke said. Brooke looked toward her purse where she had the legal papers that Katie had signed. The papers gave Bill equal custody of Will and returned his company to him. Bill and Katie thought the papers had been destroyed.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Wyatt and Liam argued about Hope. Liam noted that the pregnancy scare had been an eyeopener for Hope. \"Hope is your past, and you're only fooling yourself,\" Wyatt told Liam.  Liam disagreed, and he left.\n\n\nLiam stopped at Pam's desk, where Pam was playing with a puppy from a shelter where she volunteered. Pam and Liam took turns holding the puppy named Joy. Liam said that he'd planned to write a piece for his magazine on shelter dogs, and Liam offered to join Pam at the shelter. Pam thanked him. \n\n\nPam added that she knew Hope would be in the photo studio after her meeting. Pam said that she would always be on Liam's side. Liam thanked her and left.\n\n\nIn the studio, Hope picked up photos and proof sheets. Liam entered. He said he liked to believe that she had been at home, packing to move in with him. Hope reminded Liam that he'd stolen a truck and kidnapped her. Liam joked that the next time he'd be more careful, but he thought she'd liked the spontaneity. Hope advised there would not be a next time.\n\n\nLiam countered that they had almost lost each other forever. Liam encouraged Hope to walk away from Wyatt because he knew that Hope did not see herself raising a family and spending her future with Wyatt. \"We know who you really see yourself with -- it's me,\" Liam said. Hope looked thoughtful but said nothing.\n\n\nHope said that she needed Liam to back off, but Liam refused. He said he would no longer wait on the sidelines while she was with Wyatt. \"I can't do this anymore. I want equal time. Consider dating us both,\" Liam said.\n\n\nHope refused. She said that her mom had dated Thorne and Ridge, and it was not something she wanted for her own life. Liam said he planned to make dinner for Hope the following evening, and if she didn't show up, he would move on forever. \"Tomorrow night can be a new beginning for us, or it can be the end,\" he said. Hope looked confused.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Oliver and Aly made out at the pool. Oliver said that he felt lucky to be at the mansion with her. Oliver and Aly went to Aly's room to review the underwater photos they had taken. Oliver said he respected Aly and her values. Aly was self-conscious when she saw her photos. Oliver told her she looked fantastic.\n\n\nOliver and Aly discussed Aly's mother, and Aly said that she had been four years old when her mother had died. Aly added that Taylor had been drinking and driving when she'd hit Aly's mom. Aly said that she never had closure. \n\n\nAly explained that Taylor had almost become her stepmom. Aly said she had torn up Taylor's wedding gown. Aly believed that Taylor had targeted her father while he had been grieving. \"She was taking advantage,\" Aly said.\n\n\nOliver sympathized and told Aly that she could talk to him about her mom and anything. \"I'm just happy to be here for you,\" Oliver said. Aly said Oliver made her feel like a woman, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn Wyatt's office at Forrester, Quinn freaked out that she had overheard Hope tell her mother that Liam's stunt of kidnapping Hope had worked. Hope was rethinking her relationship with Wyatt. Quinn worried that Wyatt would lose Hope, and they would lose their position at Forrester.\n\n\nWyatt told Quinn to stop her rant, but she advised him not to think his relationship with Hope was safe. Wyatt told his mother to stay out of his relationship. \"Stop worrying,\" he said. Both Wyatt and Quinn looked worried. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Quinn eavesdrops on Hope and Brooke\u2019s private conversation. Later, she attempts to tell Wyatt that he has reason to worry. Brooke confided in Rick about trying to help Bill get his company back from Katie. Oliver is moved when Aly shares her feelings about losing her mom and a special memory that Darla left for her daughter. Liam offers Hope a \"challenge\u201d in regards to her relationship with both him and Wyatt.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn listens at the door while Brooke and Hope discuss what just happened. She got scared of losing Liam in her life, but is she ready to move on with Wyatt. Quinn looks very concerned when Hope says she has no idea what she wants to do. Wyatt tells Liam those are fighting words. Nothing about an almost pregnancy changes things and Liam is only fooling himself if he thinks it does. Ollie kisses Aly several times by the pool. He calls the place ginorous and he is feeling pretty lucky himself thanks to Miss F. He takes her back to her room so they can be alone. She says they were alone in the pool, but he says her granddad could have come out .he meant really alone. He kisses her again. He says the more time he spends in her room, the more he likes it. And he is not talking about the decor; he believes in the message of HFTF too. They look at the underwater photo shoot and he says she looks fantastic. Liam comes out from seeing Wyatt and is amused that Pam is playing with a puppy \u0096 Joy. She has Joy say hello to Liam. He determines that she helps out at the animal shelter and he'd like to write a piece on it and will take her up on her offer for Liam to come by the shelter anytime. Pam says Hope will be at a photo shoot next. Hope continues but Rick bursts in to ask what is this he is hearing about her being kidnapped. She says she is fine and leaves him with Brooke who fills him in. He says he just saw Quinn around the corner and she did not look too happy. Quinn storms back to her office and tells Wyatt that he is losing Hope. That little stunt that Liam pulled by taking her to his place ..it's working. She just heard Hope talking to her mother. When he tells her that relationship is in the past now, she tells him do not dare become complacent ..not when anything that means anything to him could be slipping away. She says Hope is not as sure of their relationship as Wyatt seems to believe. All of this has stirred something up in Hope and it could upset her and their business arrangement with FC. Wyatt scoffs that she is over re- acting and holding their success in the company in the balance. She sternly warns him that she did not like Hope in the beginning but now she sees that she makes him happy and can give him something she never can. She does not want him to lose that. He says he isn't going to lose Hope. Quinn warns that he might feel differently if he heard what Hope told her mother about Liam. There is a long history there. He is Liam Spencer and Wyatt would be a Spencer too if he could. He says yes he supposes but why is she bringing it up now ..and what does it have to do with him and Hope. He warns her to jut let him handle this. He tries to convince her that if she involved and does her \"stuff\" that he really could lose Hope. He has faith in himself and Hope so Quinn should just chill. Rick asks Brooke about Ridge sightings. He doesn't want to turn his back too long without knowing where he is. She says she is keeping an eye on him. It's Katie she is worried about but she has the power to change it. She looks toward her purse and the papers. She tells him about meeting Karen but she still wouldn't re-instate Bill. But Brooke says she has proof that things aren't like what Karen and Katie think they are. It is undisputable but she is not sure she should use it as it might ruin her relationship with Katie forever. She took Katie's husband and Katie took hers but should she take her job too. Yet someone needs to stop her. It can't go on like this; it has to end. Liam finds Hope in the photo room. He grins that he keeps pretending that she is home packing to move in with him. She says they have already had that discussion. He isn't sure they finished before a certain someone interrupted them. She says yes a certain someone that he stole a pickup and trailer from. He days duly noted and next time she says there will be no next time. He said he did that because he had the scare of his life and had to do something. And that is the reason he is here now. They almost lost each other and they can not ignore that. She says she isn't. But she can not give him what he wants if it means walking away from Wyatt. He tells her she should before Wyatt and his mother .Hope won't hear any more. This has nothing to do with Quinn. He says okay then she needs to ask herself the question. Who does she want to spend the rest of her life with and have a family with. It's not Wyatt, it is him. Ollie finds a VHS tape in Aly's room as he is looking about. She says her mother made it for her on her 4th birthday to show how special she was. She's watched it a gazillion times. Ollie sympathizes that it must have been tough losing her mom so young. She says yes and the way she lost her was even rougher. Taylor was driving the car ..drinking and driving and never should have been behind the wheel that night. And she did not even get to go to the funeral as her dad couldn't tell her that she was gone. She never got to say goodbye. Maybe that is why she still talks to her now. Ollie doesn't think she is weird. They look through a photo album and she tells him that Taylor almost became her step-mother but thank God Thorne didn't marry her. She was four, Thorne was grieving and Taylor took advantage. Ollie holds her and says he can not take the place of her mother but she can talk to him about it or anything. He kisses her and she says no one makes her feel like a woman like he does. Hope tells Liam that she gets why he is pressing her but right now he just needs to back off. He wants answers that she truly can not give him. He says then give him something else instead. He opines that he can not just sit on the sidelines and watch her and Wyatt. He wants to be part of her life again and he's not talking about friendly chance encounters. He means spending time with her alone and dating. He knows Wyatt is not going to step aside. And it kills him to say this but ..would she consider dating both of them. She is not sure he is serious. In anguish she says her mother did that by dating two brothers, Ridge and Thorne and that is not what she wants for her life. He laughs not for him either but if she can not give up Wyatt, then just give him equal time. Here's what he will do. He will make dinner tomorrow night at his place. He will open the wine and set two place settings. He will expect her there but if she doesn't come, then he has to move on. So tomorrow night is the beginning or the end but it is up to Hope.",
