    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya and Rick discussed that Nicole had not called about being late for dinner. Rick teased that people Nicole's age never called anyone anymore. Maya agreed and noted that she had just received a text message from Nicole that she was going to be a jewelry model for Wyatt and would be home later. \"Heart, heart, heart,\" Maya read and laughed.\n\n\nRick noted that Wyatt was probably trying to suck up, and he was all for it. Maya said that Liam and Ivy had been strange during their visit. Maya wondered if Spencer might have planned a big expos\u00e9 on Forrester, but Rick said he had nothing to hide.\n\n\nAly entered and delivered crab legs that Rick had wanted. She told him that she had cracked all the shells for him so he wouldn't have to deal with the mess. Rick was disappointed. He had wanted to crack the shells.\n\n\nAly apologized and prepared to return to the kitchen, but Rick told her to leave the crab legs. He ordered Aly to make him a turkey burger, and he was very specific about what he wanted on it. Rick also asked Aly about the additions to her shoe line. Aly excitedly said she had images for him on her computer. Aly returned to the kitchen, and Maya playfully chastised Rick for his treatment of Aly.\n\n\nCarter showed up, and Rick invited him to share in some the snacks Aly had made. Carter marveled that Aly cooked for them. Maya offered Carter some wine or tea, but Carter declined. Carter delivered some files on a flash drive. Rick thanked him and left to upload the files in another room.\n\n\nWhile Maya and Carter were alone, Carter encouraged Maya to tell Rick the truth. \"Don't do to Rick what you did to me,\" Carter said. \"You really loved me. I'm sorry I hurt you,\" Maya confessed. She added that Carter had helped her, and she had treated him badly. She added that when a question of marriage and children arose, she would tell Rick the truth. \"Unless Nicole tells him first,\" Carter said.\n\n\nRick returned and thanked Carter. Rick said he wanted to clear the air about Carter's feelings for Maya. Carter admitted it had been awkward between them. Carter said he'd never understood Maya, but he wished them both the best. Maya thanked Rick and Carter, and Carter left.\n\n\nRick said he didn't trust Carter because he had been Ridge's buddy, but Rick added that he did trust Nicole.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam and Ivy sneaked into Rick's office in the dark. Liam wanted to turn on the lights, but Ivy was afraid someone would see them. They used their flashlights to look through drawers.\n\n\nLiam suggested that whatever they were looking for had to be in a locked drawer. Ivy said locks wouldn't stop her. All she needed was a paper clip. Liam teased that she hadn't needed a key to his house -- she could have broken in.\n\n\nIvy used a paper clip and unlocked a drawer that included ginseng, and Ivy said he had to have used it to become more virile. Then, Liam found a sexy picture of Donna. Ivy noted Donna had a great body, but she wondered why Rick would have such a picture of his aunt. Liam said it had to have been Eric's stuff.\n\n\nLiam and Ivy agreed it would have been a lot easier if they had known what they were looking for. They noted that Rick was too smart to leave a paper trail, and they hoped Wyatt was able to get some information from Nicole.\n\n\nLiam and Ivy wondered if Rick had fudged the Forrester numbers, and Ivy said they should look for a double set of books. They looked around the office, and Ivy found a safe behind a painting. They tried everyone's birthdays they could think of as combinations but had no luck. Ivy suggested that Liam could hack into Rick's files to see if he had been messing with the numbers. Liam agreed.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Wyatt and Nicole chatted, and Nicole made some more margaritas. Wyatt admitted that he was still technically married. Nicole said she was curious about his wife. Wyatt dished that he and Hope had not been married long. They would have been starting a family.\n\n\nWyatt said Nicole was the first woman he had taken home since his marriage had fallen apart. He thanked Nicole because she'd even gotten a laugh out of him. \"I feel comfortable talking to you. Sharing my innermost secrets. I hope you feel the same way about me too,\" he said. Nicole said she did.\n\n\n\"I have told you all my deep, dark secrets. Now it's your turn,\" Wyatt said. Nicole wondered why Wyatt was so curious about Maya and Rick. Wyatt explained that he wanted to get ahead at Forrester. \"I need to know everything about him, and I got the feeling you can help me,\" Wyatt said. Nicole shook her head and smiled.\n\n\nWyatt told Nicole about how Rick had wanted him to get down on his knees and beg for his job after Wyatt's marriage to Rick's sister had fallen apart. Rick had been kidding, but Wyatt said Rick treated people terribly.\n\n\nWyatt begged Nicole to tell him something about Rick. Nicole excused herself, and went into another room. Wyatt's phone rang, and Liam asked if Wyatt had made any progress. Wyatt said he and Nicole were getting along and having margaritas. Wyatt admitted that he liked Nicole. He hung up.\n\n\nNicole returned and said she'd had a good time, and she had called a car because it was late. Wyatt said he didn't want her to leave. He kissed her. \"Stay,\" he said.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt cajoles Nicole that he is right. She is uncomfortable talking about Rick and Maya because there is something major going on there. He says she can tell him anything. Instead she grabs the blender and wants to make more margaritas. He mentions that he was serious as he wants them to be totally honest, no secrets. He gets that Maya is living with Rick so they may both be asking Nicole to deny anything but she can trust him. Maya tells Rick it was a little inconsiderate of Nicole not to call and say she would not be home for dinner. Then she realizes she does have a message with Nicole telling her she is the new jewelry model. They discuss Liam but Rick says he has nothing to hide so Liam can ask questions all he wants. Liam and Ivy sneak into a darkened Rick's office and look all over the place to find something incriminating. Ivy does find a locked drawer that she manages to open with a paperclip but finds only some leftover items from Eric's days. They even find a safe behind the horse picture but can not crack the safe. Ivy says it would be helpful if they knew what they were looking for. Liam says it could be a second set of books but he doubts it is criminal, just something embarrassing or a disgrace as Rick is more interested in his image than anything else. And Maya said this was a secret that could oust him at FC. Aly brings some cracked crab to Rick who rejects it since cracking crabs is a venture within itself. He tells her to leave it as Maya may want it but he will take a turkey burger and proceeds to tell her just how he wants it right down to two pickle halves. Aly trots off to do her duty and Maya frowns at Rick and says he is bad, but they both get a big laugh out of it. Carter drops by to give Rick some proposals. Rick invites him to eat if he hasn't already. Carter accepts but wonders why Aly is cooking for him. Rick says they have a cook but Aly likes to do nice things for him. Rick has to crunch some numbers so tells Aly he will look at her shoe line proposals tomorrow and get back with her. Nicole wonders why Wyatt is so curious about Maya and Rick. He says Rick is his boss and in order to get ahead in business he would like to know all he can about him. He thinks Nicole can help him with that. Rick leaves Carter and Maya alone while he looks over the papers. Maya tells Carter that she knows this is awkward and she lost herself when she met him. She should not have treated him that way as he deserved better. He tells her what she is doing now is crazy. She does not believe that. This only pertains to her and Rick and she will tell him when the time is right. Wyatt still continues to question Nicole and she wants to hear more about him and Hope. Wyatt says Nicole is the first woman that he has brought here to his place since his marriage fell apart. He has not laughed much lately. He tells her he is not the type of guy that wears his emotions on his sleeve but he finds it easy to talk to her and he hopes she feels that way too. He goes a little further by saying Rick can be a bit of a tyrant and even wanted Wyatt to get down on his hands and knees and beg for his job back. He does not want him running FC and feels he must have some deep dark secret. She is in the other room when Liam calls Wyatt. Wyatt whispers but says he can not talk freely right now. Liam says he and Ivy have struck out too at FC. Nicole comes back out and says she did not realize it was so late. She just called a car and needs to go home. Wyatt is disappointed and says he wants her to stay and finish their conversation. He kisses her.",
