Brooke said that Aly was a beautiful girl and needed to learn to take a compliment. Aly replied that she was working on it.\n\n\nThe meeting adjourned, and Caroline remained behind to get Aly to reveal why she seemed to be bursting at the seams. Observing Aly's flushed features, Caroline guessed that it was about a guy. Aly admitted that there was someone, but she swore Caroline to secrecy about it.\n\n\nAly beamed that she'd had her first kiss, and Caroline asked if Aly had a boyfriend. Aly thought so. She described him as a little older and attractive, but she didn't want anyone else to know because he worked at Forrester. Caroline was surprised to hear that, and Aly revealed that it was Oliver.\n\n\nAly was unsure of herself because guys never found her attractive. Caroline replied that it wasn't possible because Aly was stunning. Grinning, Aly said that Oliver made her feel pretty and desirable. Aly asked if Caroline thought Aly was reading too much into it. Caroline believed that was up to Aly, who then decided that she knew Oliver liked her.\n\n\nCaroline was happy for Aly but wanted to offer advice from painful experience. Carole advised Aly not to give everything to a guy and to hold back some love for herself. In Caroline's view, Aly was experiencing something beautiful and should enjoy it. The women hugged.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Carter assumed that Maya was still upset about Oliver and Aly. Carter reminded Maya that taping someone without their knowledge was illegal. Maya decided to go to the studio to scope out Oliver's true intentions toward Aly.\n\n\nIn the studio, when Maya entered, Oliver was reviewing the pool footage he'd taken. She observed the footage and noted that Aly had seemed to be having fun. Oliver said that Aly had been doing so after he'd loosened her up a little. Maya suspected that Oliver had been steadily easing Aly past her comfort zone, and he asked Maya what she needed to say to him.\n\n\nMaya was surprised that Oliver had nominated Aly for the bedroom line. Maya didn't see Aly as the model type, but he replied that Aly was smoking hot. Maya assumed Oliver wanted to get Aly into some lingerie, and he murmured that he could think of worse things. Concerned about the casual way Oliver talked about Aly, Maya asked him not to take advantage of Aly.\n\n\nOliver asked what he'd done to make Maya suspect that he was taking advantage. Maya noted that he talked as if dating Aly was a career move. Oliver admitted that he had wanted to be a part of Forrester for a long time, and dating Aly strengthened his position.\n\n\nOliver added that he genuinely liked Aly, who was refreshing. Maya added that Aly was inexperienced and vulnerable, and Maya asked him to remember that as he went forward. \"Of course,\" he bit out, darting his eyes away.\n\n\nMaya left, and Aly arrived. Oliver had asked her there to show her the underwater footage. She said it was great. He stated that he'd sent her a copy to remember it by. Aly grew bashful, and he asked what was on her mind. She didn't want to say at first, but at his prodding, she revealed that she couldn't stop thinking of him. He said it was just what he wanted to hear, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Maya met Carter in Rick's office to discuss her nagging doubts about Oliver. Oliver had said the right things to Maya, and though she wanted to believe him, she couldn't forget what he'd said on the tape and how disrespectful he'd been. Maya could relate to Aly's innocence and said Aly was the perfect target for a smooth guy like Oliver. Maya didn't have a good feeling about it.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Wyatt thought Liam was losing it. Hope explained that Liam had realized that if Wyatt and Hope had a baby, then Liam and she wouldn't ever reunite. Wyatt replied that he'd already thought it was that way. Hope stated that Liam was still invested. Wyatt asked if Hope was, too.\n\n\nWyatt decided to pretend he hadn't asked that question because he knew that, for some inexplicable reason, Hope had feelings for Liam. Wyatt was frustrated that Liam wouldn't leave her alone, but Hope said Liam saw it as fighting for what had been originally his. Wyatt asked what she'd do, and sighing, she said that she didn't know.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Hope would hear his take on it, and she nodded. He told her that if she kept looking back, she'd miss the future that was there before her. He suggested that she go to Liam's house and let Liam know with finality that she was committed to Wyatt. Wyatt kissed and hugged her.\n\n\nWyatt left, and Brooke arrived in the room. Hope discussed Liam's ultimatum with Brooke. Hope said that Wyatt had left it up to her to decide, and though she hadn't done that yet, something inside her opposed dating two brothers. Brooke suggested that Hope call it off with Wyatt.\n\n\nHope didn't want to do that, and she felt that Liam knew it. She said it was the reason Liam had said she could date both men. If she didn't choose to do that, Liam would be gone for good, and Hope wasn't sure she was ready for that. Brooke said that being caught between two men could be flattering, but in truth, someone would get his heart broken.\n\n\nBrooke offered to tell Liam to back off, but Hope asked her mother not to get involved. Brooke advised Hope to follow her instincts, and at the right time, they would tell her where to be.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was at the sky lounge when Quinn strode up to talk about Oliver's suggestion about Aly. Wyatt was preoccupied in thought, and Quinn coaxed him to tell her the problem. \"Liam,\" Wyatt replied and explained Liam's ultimatum for Hope to date both brothers or lose Liam. Quinn hoped that Hope had put a stop to the stupidity, but Wyatt said he didn't know what she planned to do.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to have a chat with Liam, but Wyatt ordered her to stay put. Wyatt said he could handle his own life. Quinn asked if Wyatt understood that Hope would walk into a candlelight dinner with flowers, and Liam would try to romance the pants off Hope. Quinn said that Wyatt might be okay with being left in the cold, but she wasn't. She asked if he wanted to go set Liam straight, \"or shall I?\"\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam chopped onions and looked hopefully at the door. He checked to make sure the living room was tidy and then smelled some flowers he'd bought. Again, he looked at the door. Liam flashed back to his time in Italy with Hope and looked up when he heard a knock at the door. \n\n\n",

Their conversation causes Maya to become even more determined to protect the young Forrester heiress. Liam continues to prepare dinner for Hope while she and Wyatt discuss Liam\u2019s actions and how he is still so invested in her. Wyatt wonders if Hope is invested as well.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt tells Hope that Liam must be losing it .first he steals his truck and RV and kidnaps Hope and now he is issuing ultimatums. She says well they were all sort of freaked out about Hope possibly being pregnant and Liam was affected by this. It just made him realize the finality of the situation that they'd never get back together. Wyatt says he was kind of hoping that is where things stood. He doesn't want to put her on the spot. He knows she has feelings for Liam and he doesn't need it spelled out for him. But to get back to the ultimatum he needs to be very clear .if she goes to Liam's tonight it means she is dating both of them. She says yes and if she doesn't show up, then Liam is done. She tells Wyatt that she is so sorry, the last thing she wants to do is hurt him. Wyatt says he is not hurt, but Liam needs to get a life of his own. He's constantly pushing her buttons. Hope says Liam doesn't see it that way. He's just fighting for what was originally his. He asks what is she gonna do and she doesn't know. He tells her if she keeps looking back in the past that she will miss the future. And it's right here in front of her. So go to Liam if she has to and tell him what he can do with his creepy ultimatum. And tell him once and for all that she is committed to Wyatt. Carter tells Maya that he can tell she is still bothered by Oliver and Aly. She says yes and she doesn't trust his motives especially after hearing him diss her on tape. She tells him not to go all legal on her when he reminds her it is illegal to tape someone without their knowledge. Caroline befriends Aly and asks her to spill. She'd like to know what has her bursting at the seams ..must be something major. She is all flushed and excited and sort of jittery she guesses it might be a guy. Aly admits there is something .someone a guy but Caroline can not tell anyone, even Rick. She would just die if anyone found out. Caroline says she is a good secret keeper. Aly tells her she has been kissed. Caroline realizes she means her very first kiss ..does she have a boyfriend. Aly says she thinks so. He's gorgeous and he has these eyes that just pins her to the wall. He's smart and funny and super talented and very protective. She finally comes out that it is Oliver. Maya drops in on Oliver and he is watching footage of his shoot with Aly in her pool. He says it took a while to loosen Aly up but she'd totally into it now. Maya asks if he has been doing a lot of that lately .easing Aly past her comfort zone. He chuckles that he prefers it as helping her reach her full potential. She says it is a thin line. He wonders if there is something Maya would like to say to him. She says as a matter of fact, there is. She opines that he surprised her today at the meeting by suggesting Aly as the model. Then she realized naturally that he would be the photographer. He says it is his job and Aly is super smoking. Maya says and maybe wanted to get her in some lingerie. He could think of worse things. She says when he speaks of her so casually it worries her. She asks him to please don't take advantage of her. He wonders what makes her think that he is. She says the way he talks about her like she is some means to an end. Like she is a way for him to keep his job and she doesn't want to see Aly used that way. He says it is coming across like he is being a manipulative jerk. She apologizes and says she is just worried about Aly. He says he will be totally honest. He does not hate that she is a Forrester. He likes it here. With the exception of a couple, he likes the family and he wants to be part of this for a long time. Maya interjects and being Aly's boyfriend sort of guarantees that. He admits it strengthens his position but that's not it. He really likes Aly, she is different and refreshing. Maya adds also young, inexperienced and vulnerable, so remember that when going forward. Wyatt is barely listening when Quinn goes on and on about Aly being the possible model. She finally gets him to spill. It's like a new disaster every hour. He says Liam is demanding equal time with Hope. She asks like in a debate. He ways no, Liam is insisting that Hope come over for dinner tonight which will constitute a real date and she will proceed to date both of them. Quinn says that is the most ridiculous thing she has ever heard. Please tell her that is not what Hope is going to do. Brooke asks Hope if Wyatt knows. He could not have been thrilled. Hope says all things considered he was pretty calm. He said it was her choice. But she hasn't made it yet. Something makes her recoil from dating two brothers. Brooke says that would make her like her. She could always call it off with Wyatt. Hope says that is not an option. And Liam knows that. That is partly why he is doing this. She can still see Wyatt but it gives Liam another chance as well. But if she doesn't do this then Liam will move on for good and she's not sure she is ready for that either. Caroline wants to hear more about Aly and Oliver. Aly says she doesn't know. Usually guys do not find her attractive. Caroline pooh poohs that; she is stunning. Aly says Oliver makes her feel pretty and desirable. Caroline hugs her and says good for Oliver. Look at her, her first kiss, her first boyfriend. But just a little friendly advice from painful experience. It sounds like she has fallen very hard. Just be careful and don't just hand over everything to just any guy. Always make sure there is enough love for herself. Aly thanks her for her advice and listening to her without laughing. Quinn listens but tells Wyatt that she is going to go have a talk with Liam. He stops her cold, saying do not go barreling over there fighting his battles. This is his life and he can handle it. She doesn't think he is doing that if he is just here with his thoughts while Liam is trying to romance the pants off of Hope. Wyatt says that is not going to happen. Quinn says she sees it now \u0096 candlelight, soft music, flowers, everything set up for a romantic recommitment which leaves Wyatt nowhere. Wyatt may be okay with that, but she's not, so who is it going to be, Wyatt sets Liam straight or she will. Brooke tells Hope that she knows how it feels to be torn between two fabulous men. But she has to make a choice and one will be hurt. She offers to talk to Liam and ask him to back off a little. Hope doesn't want her to be caught in the middle. Brooke says okay then she just needs to follow her instincts. When the time comes they will tell her where to be. Maya tells Carter that Oliver said all the right things. He genuinely likes Aly and she believes him. But she can't unhear what he said on the tape. Aly is so innocent and she can relate to that. She's the perfect target for a smooth older guy like Oliver. She just doesn't have a good feeling about it. Aly goes to Oliver's office and they look at the underwater shoot. She's nervous but says she can't stop thinking about him. He says that is what he likes to hear and he will show her really. He kisses her. Liam turns the soft music on, he has the fireplace going, lights a gazillion candles, rearranges the flowers several times, has a bouquet of flowers to give Hope and changes his mind about the white or red wine and puts both bottles out. He keeps looking at the clock then finally hears a knock at his door.",
