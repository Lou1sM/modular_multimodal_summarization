She asks what has he done? He asks what is wrong with her and starts looking at her like it's the first time he's really seeing her or paying attention?

She ends up hugging Felicia as they laugh about Felicia's bald head. Back at his office, Ridge rebukes himself for the latest happenings with Brooke. Brooke emerges from the shower, and takes the bottle of pills, possibly to destroy them, but Nick walks in at that moment and tells her they were right, Megan and his old man was behind everything. She practically falls into a chair and he realizes something is terribly wrong, that she is trembling. He spies the pill bottle and seizes it from her hand and asks about her father and Ridge, did they come back to her house? When he says Ridge, she is silent and it's a dead give- away.",
