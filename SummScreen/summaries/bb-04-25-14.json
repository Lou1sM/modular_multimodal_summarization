    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's office, Carter liked that Maya was protective, but he didn't seriously believe that Oliver would hurt Aly. Maya again played the recorded bit about dating the redhead and asked if it sounded like Oliver had honorable intentions. Carter noted that Aly seemed very different from the angry girl she'd been a few weeks back, so Oliver's influence had to be a change for the better.\n\n\nCarter didn't think that what Oliver had said on the recording had been cool, but it was guy talk. \"That's all,\" Carter insisted, cupping Maya's face in his hands. She agreed that Aly's demeanor had improved, and it was probably because of Oliver. Still, Maya worried that something might go wrong. Carter said it was probably Aly's first boyfriend, but loved ones would rally around Aly if she got hurt.\n\n\nMaya predicted that Aly wouldn't just act hurt. Maya recalled that they'd seen Aly when she'd been in a bad place. Carter wondered where Aly's rage emanated from. Maya stated that they didn't know Aly's full story, but there was stuff inside Aly that they didn't know about.\n\n\nIn the studio, Oliver and Aly kissed, and she asked if it was okay that she couldn't stop thinking about him. Oliver replied that he felt the same way, and they kissed again. Aly seemed disturbed by something, and he said he was there for her to talk about whatever was on her mind.\n\n\nAly murmured that she didn't like talking about herself to just anyone. Oliver reminded her that he wasn't just anyone. He assumed that Aly's sadness had to do with her mother. Aly revealed that she wanted to feel her mother's arms around her, but she couldn't because of \"that woman.\"\n\n\n\"Taylor,\" Aly seethed. Aly hated to say the name, but Taylor had been the start of everything bad in Aly's life. Oliver convinced Aly to talk about it and promised that he'd keep her confidence.\n\n\nAly explained that after her mother's death, she'd had to go to therapy. She'd only been four years old, but she'd been an angry mess. She'd stayed in therapy for years, she'd been bullied in school, and she hadn't been able to make any friends. \"They all thought I was different, and they were right,\" Aly concluded. Oliver told her that she was different, but in a good way.\n\n\nAly recalled that her father had said that to her. She stated that her father was the best -- as long as he stayed away from that woman. Aly scoffed at the notion that Taylor had been a mental health expert. Aly explained that Taylor had killed Darla while driving drunk, and then Taylor had gone after Thorne. Aly hadn't been able to allow that, and she'd torn Taylor's wedding dress to shreds.\n\n\nAly called Taylor a hypocrite who claimed to be so good. \"I hate her...\" Aly uttered. She felt like a baby, but Oliver said that Aly didn't need to stress about Taylor, who was no longer in Aly's life. Aly agreed and said her father was over Taylor, \"thank God.\"\n\n\nOliver assured Aly that he was in her corner. Knowing that felt good to Aly, who stated that only her father had supported her. She added that her mother had, too, \"until that -- \" Oliver cut in, refusing to let Aly return to thoughts of Taylor. He hugged Aly, who said that everything would be okay as long as that woman stayed away from her and her father.\n\n\nIn a candlelit setting behind a curtain, two people made love to the tune of accordion music. The couple in bed rolled over, revealing themselves to be Thorne and Taylor.\n\n\nIn the Forrester's CEO office, Quinn walked in, and Wyatt was glad to see that she was there and not at the cliff house. Quinn was anxious to know if Hope had gone there, but he didn't know. When Quinn pressed upon him how serious the evening was, the defensive Wyatt asked if he was supposed to get insecure and jealous. He felt that he had to trust Hope.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Wyatt was okay with Hope going there. Wyatt rasped that he'd told Hope not to go, and Quinn noted that Hope had gone despite that. Quinn knew that it was bothering him. He said that it did; however, Hope knew what they had, and whatever Liam offered wouldn't compare to it.\n\n\nQuinn left, and Wyatt stared at pictures from the camper trip. He recalled being with Hope in the tent on the beach and looked anxiously at the ceiling.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Liam opened the door for Hope. She smiled, and he handed her a bouquet of pink roses. Observing the romantic, candlelit room, Hope said it really looked as if he'd expected her. He replied that he'd had booze ready in case she hadn't shown up.\n\n\nHope remarked that she didn't like ultimatums, but Liam reasoned that an ultimatum would have been demanding that she leave Wyatt for Liam. Liam saw it as a choice; Hope could have him or not have him. She was surprised that he hadn't asked for something like that sooner, and he asked if she was disappointed that he hadn't. Liam felt that it was a big night for them, a new beginning.\n\n\nLiam and Hope wanted to toast, but they didn't know what to toast to. Hope asked if he really thought she wouldn't show up. \"Maybe,\" he replied. He said they'd needed it, and it had been too long. Hope joked that he hadn't had to kidnap her to get her there. Liam called it progress, and they toasted.\n\n\nThe two sat at the table, and Liam set a plate before Hope. She said it looked yummy, and he replied that she'd said the same thing in Italy. He explained that he'd bribed the recipe out of the owner of a restaurant they'd visited in Italy. He refused to tell her what the secret ingredient in it was, and he said he'd had to promise the restaurateur that they'd return someday. \"And we will,\" Liam added.\n\n\nHope tasted the meal and said it was delicious. Liam wanted her to coo that he was so talented and amazing. \"You are!\" she said, chuckling. More seriously, she repeated, \"You are.\" Liam said that she'd opened his eyes. He'd been sleepwalking, expecting her to return to him. He was glad for the close-call pregnancy because it had awakened him and given him a sense of urgency.\n\n\n\"And now, here you are. Here we are. And how I know you feel the same way I do. Tonight, we start over,\" Liam said, cupping her hand in his.\n\n\nHope admitted that she hadn't been sure that she'd actually show up until she'd been in the driveway. Liam thought it said a lot that she had arrived. It told him that she hadn't wanted to lose him. Hope quipped that she loved the Spencer confidence, but Liam said she knew what it would mean if she hadn't shown up. \"Only if I believed you!\" Hope replied.\n\n\nLiam pretended to be surprised but said she'd believed him that a no-show would mean that they were done, and a show would mean that they were dating. \"But not exclusively,\" Hope added. It didn't matter to Liam if it was exclusively, inclusively, or reclusively -- as long as he was back in the game. She admitted that she hadn't wanted to lose him, and he added that she didn't want him dating other women, either.\n\n\nHope stammered that she couldn't hold Liam to that. Liam started to whip out his phone to make a call. \"What, No! Don't! Don't! Don't! I hate it! Stop! No! I don't want you to see other women,\" Hope said. She didn't know all the answers, but she didn't want him out of her life. He said he wouldn't be, but the ground rules would be equal time and dating only to avoid more pregnancy scares.\n\n\nHope hopped from her seat to contemplate what Liam had said. She asked if he was really okay with that. Liam said he was okay with anything, as long as they had moments \"like this.\" He wanted there to be no pressure or hard sell, and she could date anyone she wanted.\n\n\nLiam wanted the future they'd almost had, but he knew that \"almost\" wasn't good enough anymore. It had taken a scare to put them together again, but being together felt really good to him. Hope giggled, and Liam kissed her. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Carter and Maya continue to talk that they hope Oliver is not going to take advantage of Aly. She's young and innocent and deserves protection. She plays the tape for him again and Carter assures her it was just guy talk, nothing else. Aly has done a 180 and it's all because of Oliver. They both agree that she is happier, but Maya can't quite get it out of her head that if something goes wrong she will be hurt. And they have seen her act out when she's in a bad place. She says her mom died tragically and she doesn't know the full story but she gets the feeling there is stuff inside of Aly that they don't know about. Hope looks around Liam's place and says he must really have known she was coming tonight. He says he was prepared for all eventualities, even booze if she didn't show up. She ways she'd never want to put him through that. But she's not a big fan of ultimatums .\"show up tonight or we're finished.\" He offers that is not an ultimatum. That would be if he said she had to leave Wyatt for him. This is just a choice. She can have him or not. She says honestly she is surprised he didn't do this sooner. He tells her it is a big night with a new beginning. Quinn comes into her office. Wyatt lets out a sigh and says thank goodness she did not go over to Liam's. She returns the favor by saying she sees he didn't either. He quips no, having one visit from Liam this week is enough for him. She asks if Hope went. Wyatt says he does not keep up with her schedule but he knows she is not in the building so he assumes she did go. Quinn says does Wyatt know what that means. He quips again probably tofu steaks and a very green salad. She doesn't know how he can be so glib when he knows Liam wants Hope back. Wyatt counters with that guess what, you don't always get what you want. Quinn says no, you have to fight for it which is exactly what Liam is doing. So what is Wyatt doing? He says one word \u0096 trusting. Quinn says you can't trust Liam. He doesn't play fair. He says he trusts Hope. Quinn says she has a soft spot for Liam. Wyatt gets agitated and asks what is he supposed to do, get all jealous and insecure. They are in love and he has to trust her. No he doesn't like that she went to Liam's. He asked her not to but she probably did anyway. He says of course it bothers him. He doesn't want to lose her. But he knows what they have and so does Hope. And whatever Liam is giving her can't compare. Liam pours the wine and looks for the perfect toast \u0096 to the first date for the rest of their lives. He doesn't want to spoil the surprise so he won't say what they are going to eat. He says it's been too long and they need this. She teases and he didn't even have to kidnap her to get her here. He says that is progress. Oliver tells Aly that he is there for her. She can talk to him about anything. She says he does not like talking about herself. He asks if it concerns her mother as he knows she thinks about her a lot. She says every day but it's not the same. She'd like to feel her arms around her like when she as little. But then one day she was gone ..all because of that woman. She says she was the start of all the bad things in Aly's life. Finally she says the name of Taylor. Reluctantly she says after her mom died when she was four years old she went into therapy for years. She was a mess. She got bullied in school, and did not make friends. He tells her she is different but in a good way. She ways her dad says that too, still does. He's the best ..if he stays away from that woman. Liam brings Hope's plate and he tells her to dig in. She can't believe he went to all the trouble of calling Italy and getting a recipe they had of grilled eggplant. He told them they'd return some day. She tells him it is delicious. He says she opened his eyes. For a while it was like he was sleepwalking expecting her to come back to him. But suddenly he realized it might be over and he couldn't just wait around any more. In a way he's glad she was almost pregnant as it gave him a mission and a sense of urgency and now here they are. And now he knows she feels the same way he does so they start over. She says until she got to his driveway she was not sure she was coming over. He says it says a lot that she did. It tells him that she did not want to lose him either. She jokes about the Spencer confidence. He says come on, she knew what it would mean if she did not show up. She says but they are not dating exclusively. He says exclusively, inclusively or reclusively, \"whatever, I am back in the game, baby.\" She laughs and says she does not want to lose him. There she has said it. But she can't hold him to not seeing other women. He jokes then he needs to make a phone call. He says as long as they are doing this, he proposes some ground rules. He says equal time obviously but just dating, no more pregnancy scares. She's surprised but he says he can be okay with anything as long as they keep having moments like this. He says no pressure, she can date whomever she wants but he knows what he wants ..that future they almost had. But almost is not good enough anymore. But they are back and it feels good. He kisses her. Aly tells Oliver that she feels like such a baby but every time she thinks about Taylor Oliver tells her not to stress over it; Taylor is not part of her life anymore. She is strong and now she has him. He gives her a big hug. Aly says okay, he is right. Her dad is over Taylor thank God and everything will be okay as long as she stays away from her dad. In Paris we see two figures in silhouette in bed making love .it's Taylor and Thorne.",
