    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge stares at picture of Brooke and obsesses about what happened the night before. While he is brooding, Taylor walks in. She has some papers she needs him to sign so their daughter can study abroad. Taylor senses that Ridge is upset. She asks him if it is about Brooke. Ridge tells her that he made a mess of things by bringing Stephen Logan in to town. Taylor thinks he should have known better. Getting into psychiatrist mode, Taylor figures out that Ridge hoped to win Brooke back by bringing Stephen in to help Brooke deal with her abandonment issues. Taylor does not understand why Ridge does not just go ahead and sleep with Brooke, since Brooke usually uses sex to solve all her problems. Ridge tells her they had sex, but it was not consensual. Taylor is shocked. Ridge explains that Brooke was on medication and he did not realize how out of it she was until after. He tells her how horrible he feels about everything and says he has to go see Brooke right away and make things right. After he leaves, Nick barges in looking for Ridge; he asks Taylor if she knows what happened between Brooke and Ridge. \n\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke is still devastated that Ridge made love to her. Nick stops by and tells her he spoke to a doctor about how her medication affected her. Brooke tells him she threw the pills away. Nick does not understand why Brooke is so upset. He wants to know what happened with Ridge and why Brooke is being so secretive. Brooke tells him it's not Ridge's fault and she does not want to talk about it. Before he can get anything out of her, Brooke's father drops by. Nick is not happy to meet him. He tells Stephen that he loves Brooke and he knows how much Stephen has hurt her in the past. Stephen admits that he has made mistakes, but says he is determined to make up for them. Brooke gently asks Nick to leave so she can talk with her father. After Nick leaves, Stephen remarks that he is very direct which is quiet a contrast from Ridge. Brooke tells him she does not want to talk about Nick or Ridge, she wants him to say what he has to say and then leave. Stephen tells her he checked into a place where they used to go camping and he would like to take her and the kids there. Brooke is annoyed that he expects her to make time for him now that he finally is making time for her. Stephen apologizes for bothering her and starts to leave. Brooke asks him to stay and begins to open up to him. She says she is not upset with him; right now, she is more concerned about Nick and Ridge. She confesses that she has never been so confused in her life. Brooke does not think her father can be objective about Nick, since he supports her relationship with Ridge. Stephen said he came back to help Brooke get back with Ridge, because Brooke always said Ridge was her destiny. Brooke tells Stephen that he has no idea how much she loves Nick or how much they have been through to be together. She admits that Ridge took advantage of her drugged condition the night before. At Brooke's request, Stephen goes to get her a glass of water. Right after he leaves, Ridge walks in apologizing to Brooke once more. Stephen comes back in the room and is furious to see Ridge touching Brooke. He warns Ridge if he does one more thing to harm \"his little girl he will make Ridge pay in ways that he can't even begin to imagine.\" \n\n\nMeanwhile at the Forresters', Felicia tells Christian she cannot believe that Bridget would consider taking Dominick to Italy without her consent. Felicia does not want to be apart from him because she does not know how much time she has left. Christian assures her that she will be around for a while. Stephanie walks in and informs Felicia that she faxed the guardianship papers to the lawyers. She promises Felicia that there is no way they will be able to take Dominick out of the country. After taking Felicia back to the guesthouse, Christian returns to see Stephanie. Stephanie tells him she thinks Bridget is being thoughtless. Christian defends Bridget, arguing how close she has become to Dominick. Stephanie says Bridget only has parental control if Felicia is dead. Christian reminds Stephanie that even though Bridget may not have any claim on Dominick, Dante does. Stephanie says her only concern is Felicia and making sure, she has her son as long as she is alive. \n\n\n",
