    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy, Ridge, and R.J. discussed that justice had to be served. They had to go after Spectra, and they needed Coco's help. R.J. was upset they wanted Coco to rat out her sister. Steffy and Ridge explained that if Coco was innocent, she would be able to tell them what she had told him about being used by her sister.\n\n\nSteffy and Ridge explained to R.J. that they needed Coco to sign an affidavit. They later explained that it was possible Sally could go to jail for up to 15 years, but that was up to a judge. R.J. balked that they would ruin Coco's sister.\n\n\nSteffy complained that Spectra had cost the company millions, and all Coco had to do was tell the truth. Ridge agreed. \"Isn't that what you want, son?\" Ridge asked. R.J. said that if Coco helped them, he wanted them to rehire her. Steffy and Ridge were noncommittal, and they suggested Coco return to Forrester to tell them her story. \"There has to be another way,\" R.J. said. Ridge disagreed. Ridge told R.J. to call Coco and get her to return to Forrester to meet with them. \"Give her a call, R.J.,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Coco entered Sally's office, and Sally was happy to see her. Coco wondered if Sally had been preparing another knockoff design. Sally said she was done with that, and her own new designs were a part of the next collection. \"A real collection,\" Sally said.\n\n\nCoco angrily told her sister that she had been applying for jobs. Sally had hoped Coco would stay in fashion. Coco mocked her sister and reminded her that Forrester had gotten rid of her for stealing, so she wouldn't be able to show her face in fashion circles. She had applied for jobs waiting, bussing tables, and dishwashing.\n\n\nSally told Coco that Spectra needed her, and their stealing days were over. \"We need you here,\" Sally said. Sally promised to make everything up to Coco.\n\n\nCoco's phone rang, and she said it was R.J. Sally noted that R.J. cared about her. Coco reminded Sally that his parents hated her. Sally advised her to answer it. Coco took R.J.'s call, and he thanked her for answering because she had ignored so many of his texts and calls. R.J. reminded her that the theft of designs hadn't been her fault.\n\n\nR.J. said his family wanted Coco to return to Forrester to meet. Coco was in disbelief. She said she was ashamed, but R.J. said they had a way for her to make up for everything. She promised to meet him at Forrester. After she'd hung up, she told Sally she was headed to Forrester, but she knew that his family would never accept her.\n\n\nCoco said it had been stupid to think it ever could have worked out with R.J. because they were Spectras -- pariahs who stole and cheated. Sally admitted that she was not proud of what she'd done. She was sorry that she had betrayed her sister.\n\n\nSally defended her decision to protect the original Sally Spectra's vision and the jobs of all the employees. She added that Shirley had gotten into her head. She realized it was no justification for deceiving her sister, but she would never do it again, and she had learned her lesson. Coco shook her head, but Sally promised to make it up to her. Coco left.\n\n\nLater, Shirley joined Sally and said that all the deception had been worth it. They would be in the black soon. Shirley warned that they had to seize the opportunity they had been given with the Forrester designs. Sally lamented what they had done to Coco. Shirley maintained that Coco was young and would get over it. Sally sighed and agreed nothing could break a family bond. Sally said she was glad Coco had been asked to meet with R.J. Shirley said the Forresters could afford to lose some money.\n\n\nAt Forrester, R.J. told his father that Coco was on her way. R.J. objected that Sally had used Coco, and Forrester was going to use her to get back at her sister. Ridge defended their intentions as honorable. He and Steffy reminded R.J. that Sally and Spectra had broken the law. Ridge advised R.J. that Lieutenant Baker had said they might have a case if they could convince Coco to turn on her sister.\n\n\nLater, Coco entered Forrester and flashed back to her first meeting with R.J. She smiled and sadly looked away until Pam entered and said that R.J. was waiting for her in the design office. Coco greeted R.J., and they discussed that she had not communicated with him since she'd left Forester because she was embarrassed. He maintained that she had been innocent. They agreed they had missed one another.\n\n\nCoco explained that she'd been convinced his family wanted nothing to do with her because her family had hurt his family. She apologized, and R.J. said he had a way that she could make it all up to his family. He wanted her to tell the truth and tell it to a judge. Coco looked away.\n\n\nCoco asked specifically what R.J. wanted. He said they needed someone to confess, and it would help them to sue for damages.\n\n\nCoco agreed, but R.J. added that they also would press charges against Sally, and she could go to prison. Coco was shocked, and R.J. explained that it could be for up to 15 years. Coco was amazed that R.J. wanted her to put her sister behind bars. \"Is that what you want? To put my own sister in prison?\" Coco asked. R.J. looked nervous.\n\n\n",
