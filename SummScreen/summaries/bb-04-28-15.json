Charlie insisted there could be no other reason for her to take estrogen.\n\n\nPam argued that Charlie was wrong. She insisted that Maya could have taken estrogen for any number of reasons, but Charlie refused to believe it. Pam added that Charlie had seen something on TV and formed and opinion that was \"dangerous and ridiculous.\"\n\n\nRick interrupted and overheard the end of the conversation. \"What's dangerous? What are you two up to?\" Rick asked. Charlie tried to cover. He told Rick that Pam had been worried about him because security work was dangerous, and it was ridiculous that it was always dangerous.\n\n\nRick told Pam and Charlie that he \"wasn't buying it.\" Rick asked why Pam and Charlie were in his office. Pam claimed she'd heard a noise and asked Charlie to investigate. Rick didn't believe them. Charlie laughed and changed his story. \"We're busted,\" Charlie said. He concocted a story that he and Pam had been looking for a little privacy, and danger was part of it. \"What is the fun if you can't get caught?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\nPam agreed. She laughed and claimed they were adrenaline junkies. \"Too much information,\" Rick said. Charlie and Pam left the office.\n\n\nOutside at Pam's desk, Charlie reiterated that he was convinced that Maya was transgender. Pam argued that he was wrong and had to stop talking about it. \"We could lose our jobs,\" Pam said. She advised Charlie that he would never work in security again if he started that rumor.\n\n\nCharlie argued that he could send an anonymous message to Wyatt, but Pam refused to allow it. She admitted that Rick had made a lot of mistakes and treated everyone badly, but Rick cared about Maya. She refused to allow Charlie to hurt Rick and Maya.\n\n\nLater at Forrester, Rick met with Wyatt regarding the new jewelry line. Wyatt said it would focus on Maya and her grace and femininity, but that meant they had to use smaller, more delicate stones that were high in quality.\n\n\nRick didn't like the stones. Wyatt defended them as the highest quality, but Rick replied that if a person couldn't see them, they weren't worth it. \"Start over. It's not Maya,\" Rick said. Rick explained that Maya was a powerful woman, unafraid to put herself out there. \"It's like you don't know her at all,\" Rick said. Wyatt looked confused.\n\n\nIn another office, Maya and Nicole chatted about Nicole's date with Wyatt. Nicole suggested that she'd changed her mind about Maya telling Rick the truth about her transgender surgery. Maya was surprised that Nicole had changed her mind. Maya insisted she would tell Rick if and when he proposed. \"I'm just not sure that's such a good idea,\" Nicole said.\n\n\nWyatt entered. He thanked Nicole for the time they'd spent together on his dad's jet. Maya noted that Wyatt had taken Nicole to San Francisco to dinner. Nicole chimed in that it had been the plan, but she'd been having too much fun up in the sky. Maya disapproved.\n\n\nMaya told Nicole that she was being a big sister to Nicole with her disapproval. Maya wondered if it was just a fling for Wyatt. Wyatt maintained that he liked Nicole and enjoyed spending time with her. He needed her positive energy in his life.\n\n\nMaya advised Nicole not to get physical with Wyatt. Maya wanted to know where the relationship was headed, and Wyatt said he didn't know, but he wanted to find out. Nicole and Wyatt smiled at each other.\n\n\nWyatt said that he and Nicole had agreed to honesty in their relationship and \"keeping it real.\" \"It is awesome,\" Nicole said. Wyatt suggested that secrets always caused problems in his experience. \"Wouldn't you agree?\" Wyatt asked Maya. Maya looked nervous.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam explained to Katie and Bill that Wyatt had discovered that Rick had no secret. It was Maya who had the secret, according to Nicole.\n\n\nLiam doubted they would find anything helpful in Maya's secret, but Bill disagreed. Bill said that Maya had obviously been hiding something that was dangerous to the company as indicated by the argument Wyatt had overheard between Nicole and Maya.\n\n\nBill maintained that he'd always thought Maya was a gold-digger. Katie suggested the secret had nothing to do with Forrester and was personal.\n\n\nLiam agreed that Wyatt thought it could have been an argument between sisters. Wyatt showed up and said he was convinced the secret Maya had was something big because he'd mentioned secrecy to Maya, and she and Nicole had looked panicked.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Maya entered Rick's office and told him that Pam and Charlie had given her a weird look when she'd entered his office. \"What's gotten into everyone?\" Maya asked.\n\n\nRick proudly showed Maya the latest sales reports, and Maya gushed that they were better than predicted. She added that his performance could mean that Eric would make him the permanent CEO.\n\n\nRick told Maya he'd meant what he'd said about her to his parents the pervious day. He attributed his success to Maya. He shared that until she had entered in his life, he had suffered a lot of deception and scandal because of his mother, Amber, and Caroline. He'd been humiliated in the past.\n\n\nMaya and Rick hugged. He appreciated Maya's honesty and promised a future with her. He wanted to marry her and have lots of kids. \"You'd be a wonderful mother,\" Rick said.\n\n\nMaya turned away in tears. Rick worried about her. Maya said she was overwhelmed with happy emotions. \"I am happier than I ever imagined I could be,\" she said.\n\n\nMaya added that before anything happened, she had to tell him something. She felt very loved, and she had faith in their relationship and what they meant to each other. She didn't want it to change. Rick promised it wouldn't. \"Maya, whatever it is, you can always tell me anything,\" Rick said.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Pam is aghast but Charlie keeps repeating if those are Maya's pill then she is a transgender. Pam thinks that is ridiculous just because Charlie saw something similar on TV. There are other reasons a woman could be taking estrogen pills. Maya tells Nicole that she is not ashamed of who she is and if and when Rick proposes she will tell him her secret. Nicole is not so sure now that is a good idea. Rick tells Wyatt that it is like he does not know Maya at all. The jewelry Wyatt is proposing has too small gems and they need to be bigger, so start over. Bill and Liam discuss Wyatt taking Nicole on the plane and they needed to be alone but it did not work the way he expected. Wyatt finds Nicole and emphasizes again they had a good time last night. Maya says she has heard and she wonders if that is all they were doing and what his intentions are. Charlie and Pam are still arguing over the pills when Rick comes in and asks why they are in his office and arguing. They are busted but talk their way out of it and consider themselves lucky to get out of there. Bill tells Liam they need information so if Nicole told Wyatt anything about Rick they need to know. Liam says it is more like something with Maya, not Rick. Wyatt tells Maya he knows this has sort of come out of left field but that is the way it is. Nicole surprises him and he needs that in his life right now. He can not know where this is going right now but he's willing to find out. Maya tells Nicole that she can not compare her relationship with Rick with Nicole's with Wyatt. Nicole says it is what it is and right now it is awesome. Wyatt tells Maya that he does not like to play games or keep secrets and they agreed to be totally honest with each other as that always leads to trouble to keep secrets. Liam says he is disappointed as he thought Nicole knew something. But Wyatt dropped it when he heard it was not about Rick but about Maya. Bill is not surprised as he was suspicious about Maya from the start so Rick probably knows what it is and they need to find it. Pam tells Charlie to drop this right now. Maya is not transgender. She will not hear any more about it. She tells Charlie they can not follow this trail as they could lose their jobs. Charlie says no one has to know it was them. Pam says it just is not right and she won't do it. Rick would never forgive them as he loves Maya so much. Maya tells Rick that Charlie gave her a funny look so what is up about that. Rick shows her the sales reports and she says if he keeps this up his father may make him CEO as a permanent arrangement. He thinks that too and says he meant what he told his family the other day that Maya is the reason behind all of it, his strength. He hates to keep bringing up his past but the scandal with his mother over and over that made him a control freak. But he learned from her that not every relationship in this world has to end like Amber and Caroline. He loves Maya and he knows that she is wondering where their future is going. And he still does see them as a couple with wedding bells and kids, lots of kids. She would make a wonderful mother. She flinches and almost cries while saying she has never felt love like this before and she has so much faith in the two of them and does not want that to change. He tells her his love will never change and whatever it is she can tell him anything. Liam tells Bill that they are not giving up but he is afraid it is not that important or what they want. Wyatt joins in and tells them he just saw Maya and Nicole and Maya in particular was very uncomfortable when he mentioned family secrets.",
