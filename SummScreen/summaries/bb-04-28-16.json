Bill walks on into Wyatt's house who asks him to please knock next time. Bill says he is not much of a knocker. And he remarks to Wyatt that is a nice piece of art on his finger.

She admits she probably made a mistake. She made a commitment to Wyatt but admits she loves Liam too. Quinn comes on in as Liam drinks. She says she was wrong to keep him away from Steffy and only to herself. She knew he would not forget Steffy even if he could not remember her. He gets angry while drinking and starts trashing the place \u0096 the candles, the flowers, the champagne, all things he did for Steffy but what was she doing .off getting a tattoo ring from Quinn's son, Wyatt. So it does not matter that he is still in love with Steffy. She is not coming back to him. Wyatt tells Bill that he is not naive, so Bill does not have to warn him about Liam. But Steffy is his wife now. Steffy says Quinn wanted her and Wyatt to be together so they will never know if it would have worked with Liam. Part of her wants to go back to Wyatt but part of her needs to go back to her ex. Every time she sees Liam she wants to help him and make it easier on him. There was something that broke down inside of him when she showed her the tattoo ring. She is afraid he will break down and do something. Liam tells Quinn that he knows exactly how all of this happened. Quinn did this to him. She says she is sorry, she only wanted to help and she is already paying for it. He says this is exactly what she wanted. She says she thought if Wyatt was happy it would all be worth it, but she is different now. None of it was an act, they were in love and it kills her to see him hurt this way. She begs if they can just get away tonight and all this unhappiness. She cares about him so much and Steffy is gone and it is all her fault but she will give her life for him, anything he wants, she just wants him to look at her like he did as Adam. Please give her another chance. She knows they can be happy. Bill tells Wyatt that the tattoo is not a commitment. It is strictly a symbol that might keep him happy for now but not forever. And his mamma is in cuckoo land and he will not stop until he finds her. Bill tells him he will look out for Quinn and Liam so Wyatt just needs to be there for Steffy wherever she is. Wyatt says he does not have to keep tabs on Steffy. But Bill insists so he calls her. She says she is at the office but she did stop and see Liam and showed him her tattoo. She will be home soon.
