Hope said she was glad that Liam recognized how much Hope needed time to figure out what she needed.\n\n\nLiam guessed that Wyatt had not been happy about the arrangement. Hope agreed. She didn't blame Wyatt because they had been exclusively dating for months. Hope said that she cared about Liam and didn't want to lose him. \"You need to decide which one of us you can really marry and which one of us you can really start a family with,\" Liam said. Hope agreed.\n\n\nLater, Liam suggested that he could purchase his own RV. \"You know that I care about you a lot, but I care about Wyatt too,\" she said. Liam suggested they could go sailing. Hope promised to make a decision and quickly. \n\n\n\"I love you both,\" Hope said. She added that she didn't want to allow circumstances to make her choices for her. She wanted to do was right for her future. \"You and me together and crazy in love,\" Liam suggested. Liam kissed Hope, and she smiled.\n\n\nAt his home, Wyatt flipped through photos of Hope on his phone. He happily recalled romantic moments with Hope. Then, he remembered how Hope had told him that she was in love with two men. Quinn entered. She worried that something had gone wrong. Wyatt admitted that Quinn had been right about Hope and Liam. \"I was too sure of myself,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nQuinn noted that Liam had issued ultimatums that had resulted in Hope returning to Liam in spite of all the failed weddings. \"Hope doesn't deserve you,\" Quinn said. Wyatt told her never to repeat that again. Wyatt said that the pregnancy scare had changed everything for Hope.\n\n\nQuinn agreed that it would have changed everything just as her own pregnancy with Wyatt had changed her life. \"Fate would have decided for her just like it did for me,\" Quinn said. \"Where does this leave us and our company?\" Quinn asked. Quinn worried that Hope was not the girl for Wyatt because it had been too easy for Liam to guilt Hope into taking him back. \n\n\nQuinn wanted Wyatt to talk to Bill. Wyatt told her to stop. Wyatt tried to make Quinn understand that he did not want her help or his father's help. Quinn worried that Bill had sided with Liam, but Wyatt refused to ask his father to rescue him. Quinn praised Wyatt as the true Spencer son. She promised that Wyatt would have the life he deserved.\n\n\nAt Brooke's place, Brooke awakened to the sound of a horse. She opened her eyes and saw that Bill had played a horse recording on his phone. Brooke wondered if the sound was her new alarm clock. \"Want to horse around, my little filly?\" Bill teased.\n\n\nBill and Brooke laughed and joked about things they did best. Brooke offered to make French toast, and Bill offered to make her breakfast in bed. Bill left the room, and Brooke pulled the papers that Katie had signed from a nearby bag. The papers included Bill's reinstatement at his company and child custody changes. Brooke eyed Katie's signature on both papers. She returned them to her bag.\n\n\nLater, Brooke and Bill discussed that Bill could not return to his company. Bill said that he planned to start his own business. \"It's practically in my DNA,\" he said. Bill noted that Katie had been firmly entrenched as CEO at Spencer and Karen had not intention of changing her mind.\n\n\nBrooke gushed that Bill had always made Brooke a priority while Ridge had always had another woman. She recalled Taylor and Caroline. Brooke said that she liked that she had always been the only one in Bill's life. Bill hugged Brooke, but he flashed back to his wild sexcapades with Quinn.\n\n\nLater, Bill was alone in Brooke's bedroom after Brooke had gone to work. Quinn entered, and Bill was incredulous that she had gotten into Brooke's home. Quinn laid into Bill about Hope's decision to date both Liam and Wyatt. Quinn complained that Wyatt's heart had been broken, and she wanted Bill to step up and offer Wyatt all the same perks that Bill had given Liam.\n\n\nBill tried to calm Quinn, but Quinn was on a rant that Bill needed to convince Liam to let go of Hope. Bill told Quinn that she was crazy. Bill reminded her that Wyatt was a tough kid who didn't need his mommy and daddy interfering in his love life. Quinn disagreed.\n\n\n\"He cannot lose her. He cannot lose the only girl he's ever loved,\" Quinn insisted. Quinn added that she was fighting for their son's happiness. Quinn threatened that if Brooke forgot something, she might return home and discover Bill and Quinn in the bedroom. Bill reminded Quinn that she had promised not to tell Brooke anything. \"Make Wyatt a Spencer,\" Quinn ordered.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Hope worked in her office, and she noted that Liam had sent her a text message and asked if she had decided yet. Hope recalled their romantic times and wedding in Italy. At the same time, Liam was at home, and he looked at pictures on his phone of when he and Hope had been in Italy.\n\n\nLater in Hope's office, Wyatt sent a text message to Hope with a picture of Wyatt and Hope in it, and Hope recalled time she'd spent with Wyatt in the RV and by a campfire. Hope looked confused. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke and Bill talk business in the bedroom. Having just reunited with Brooke, Bill contemplates how he can be reunited with his company. Brooke silently knows she can make Bill\u2019s dream come true but is still undecided about what to do. Wyatt confides in his mother about Hope\u2019s new terms for their romance. After Brooke leaves, Quinn arrives and tells Bill that Wyatt is in trouble. Hope remembers big moments in her relationship with both Wyatt and Liam.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hope stops by early at Liam's. He wanted to call her last night but restrained himself. Now he'd like to know how Wyatt took the news that she was dating both of them. He is sure that he didn't just roll over and accept this well. He knows that is what she needs. She just hopes Wyatt knows that too. And Wyatt knows there are ground rules and Liam is sure that didn't sit well with him with no sex. He kisses her and says she needs this time so she can figure out which one she can marry and start a family with. He quips maybe he will even buy his own RV, twice as big as Wyatt's. She says this is not a competition; just trying to figure out what she is going to do with her life. She tells Liam that she really cares for him, but she also cares for Wyatt too. She thinks he's hurting a lot more than he let on last night. Wyatt's looking at pix of Hope when his mother walks in and senses something is wrong and asks if it is Hope. In frustration he tells his mom that he was too complacent. He was too sure of himself to think that Liam would get inside her head. But that is exactly what he did with this whole pregnancy scare. And Quinn adds and now issuing ultimatums like the spoiled little brat that he is. Wyatt says she was right, they have a lot of history, proposals, engagements, almost weddings all which ended in Hope having her heart broken. Quinn knows he would never cause her that kind of pain. Finally she says he is beginning to think that Hope doesn't deserve him. He asks her to never say that again. He admits that Hope said she loved both he and Liam. Quinn can't believe this is the way she is going to decide which brother she wants. Wyatt says well it's true. She has to decide which of them she wants to have a kid with she has to decide on her own. If only her pregnancy test had come back positive, then the fate would be sealed. Quinn is concerned where this leaves Wyatt now or even their business if Liam should guilt Hope into coming back to him. Wyatt barks at her only one crisis at a time. She's glad he is admitting it finally that it is a crisis. He admits it is not the best case scenario. She says it is all Bill's fault. He spoiled that wimpy little wuss rotten. Wyatt says at least he is not taking sides. Quinn says as far as he knows. He might be giving his #1 son all his fatherly advice. Wyatt says he is not a kid anymore, he doesn't need for Bill to come rescue him any more than he needs Quinn to. He says yes his relationship with Hope has taken a hit but he still thinks he is the best person for her. She says of course he is. He is a true Spencer, strong willed and a fighter. She promises him that he will have the life he deserves. Brooke wakes up to a whinny sound that Bill has put on her phone .a new alarm clock. He asks if she wants to horse around bad pun. She'll settle for a kiss instead. Then he proposes that he can make breakfast in bed for her so she can stay just as she is. She pulls out the papers and looks them over. Bill tells her that it isn't fair that Katie is holding his company and his son as hostage. There are other ways to beat this and he thinks he may have to start his own company like his father did from the ground up. She says yes but can he have the same passion as he does for Spencer. It is practically in his DNA. She looks again toward the papers in her purse. Liam suggests that he and Hope could go sailing in this pretty weather. She assures him she will not drag this out. She is going to make a decision. She loves both of them and she could see herself in the future with either of them. But what she can't do is allow certain circumstances to make that decision for her. The decision is going to be right for her. He grabs her and says he knows how it is going to turn out ..she and him crazy in love. Quinn finds her way to Brooke's bedroom after she leaves for work. Bill is outraged that the maid would let her up. She says Wyatt is in trouble. Hope has let Liam back into her life. He barks this does not concern them. She says of course it does and she expects him to step up. Bill tells her to calm down. Wyatt is a tough kid. He will handle this. He does not need his mommy to fight his battles for him or his dad either. She shakes her finger at him and says no she will not be dismissed, she will be taken seriously. What if Brooke were to come back and find them together. Bill reminds her that she promised not to say anything about their previous meetings. She says he promised to, so he needs to step up and support Wyatt and Hope. He can not lose the only girl he has ever loved. Bill will not let Wyatt down.",

At Spencer, Quinn ordered Wyatt to make a \"Makerester\" at the Spencer Spencer Spencer forrester wedding in Italy, and he said he would do it if she said yes. The wedding took place in Italy in the same place as the wedding of Liam and Hope in the past, and it was held in the church where the Spencer family used to worship.\n"
