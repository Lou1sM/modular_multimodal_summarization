Inside the shelter, they met Brandon, who gave them a tour of the overcrowded and under-funded housing facilities for the cats and dogs.\n\n\nLiam expressed his desire to use his article to make people more aware of the spaying and neutering problem. Brandon asked if Hope and Liam had a pet, and Hope replied that she and Liam didn't live together. \"We just started dating,\" Liam added, smiling at Hope.\n\n\nAt Brandon's prompting, Liam conveyed that his mother had fostered dogs for a rescue organization when he'd been younger. It had been a positive experience for Liam, and Hope noted that Liam had the biggest heart of anyone she knew. Bashfully, Liam replied that he wanted to make an impact with his story. Hope said he'd do so because he was very good at opening people's eyes.\n\n\nThe three visited the medical unit that cared for over six hundred animals. Brandon left Hope and Liam with Leslie, the kennel supervisor. Leslie talked to them about the surgeries, spaying, and neutering. Liam and Hope were sad upon seeing the injured and crated animals.\n\n\nHope and Liam met Bacon, a three-legged dog on wheels whose hind leg had rotted off. They also met Daredevil, who'd been born without eyes. In the past, Daredevil had  whelped whenever he had been touched, and his new owner suspected he'd been abused. The owner said it took a lot of work to rehabilitate animals in that condition.\n\n\nNext, Hope and Liam interviewed the veterinarian who discussed the daily admissions due to fracture injuries. Hope was curious to know if the animals had been struck by cars.  The doctor said that a lot of people rescued the injured animals on the roadside, and Hope wished that people who'd hit the animals would take responsibility for their accidents.\n\n\nLiam prompted the doctor to discuss the importance of spaying and neutering. The doctor discussed how spaying and neutering prevented the rise in euthanasia, and it helped prevent some diseases like mammary cancer and prostate problems. The doctor felt that people weren't getting educated on how to care for their animals, and they wound up turning their animals in when a little bit of prevention could have kept an animal out of the shelter.\n\n\nHope and Liam petted some of the animals, and Hope thanked him for inviting her there. Liam grinned when she gave him a long hug.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill played with Will on the floor. Realizing how much his son was growing, Bill became wistful about missing time with his son. As Brooke agreed that it wasn't fair to Bill or Will, she looked into her purse to gaze at the secret papers. Bill felt it was wrong that Katie got to spend all the time with Will and run the company into the ground. Bill said there was nothing he could do.\n\n\nBrooke replied that it wasn't true, but Bill insisted that it was. He said that, even after he'd tried everything from reasoning to fighting back, Katie would not give him equal time with Will, nor would Karen give his job back. For the first time in his life, he felt completely powerless.\n\n\nBill tried to get Will to say \"Da-Da\" as they played. Bill noted that he had an hour or so left until someone arrived to take his son from him. He wondered if it would be that way for the rest of their lives. Brooke said Katie was just being stubborn but that Katie knew that he was a good father. He wished someone would tell Katie that because a couple of hours here and there weren't enough.\n\n\nBill noted that his son couldn't spend the night, and he asked when the last time was that he'd kissed the child at bedtime. Bill wanted Will to know, trust, and count on his father.  Bill wanted Will to light up at the sight of Bill, not want to punch a wall like Bill had wanted to do at the sight of his father.\n\n\nBrooke assured Bill that he'd be a better father, and she decided that she needed to go somewhere. She glanced again at the custodial agreement in her purse, and then she took off. Bill played with Will on the floor and promised Will that he would always fight for him.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Ridge and Katie kissed in her office on Katie's lunch break. They contemplated letting things get out of control in the office. Though Katie had many important things to do, she said that nothing was more important than Ridge.\n\n\nAs they kissed more, Ridge noted that Katie wasn't staring at the clock as she usually did when Will was with Bill. Katie didn't like being away from Will for even a few hours, but she felt that it was good for Will to spend time with Bill. Ridge said that Bill was lucky to have any time with the boy at all, and she replied that Bill wanted more time Will and to have his job back, too.\n\n\nRidge doubted that would happen because a capable, sexy woman was running Spencer. He admired the gentle way that Katie ran the business. Katie admitted to losing her cool at times, and he guessed she meant with Bill. She knew that Bill wanted more time with Will and to be back at the company. She didn't want Bill to think that she was punishing him.\n\n\nRidge thought Katie should always feel good, and he asked what he could do to make Katie feel good. He kissed her neck, and she said he could keep doing what he was doing.\n\n\nKatie and Ridge broke apart when Brooke entered. Brooke apologized for interrupting, but she said the receptionist was out to lunch. Ridge asked if Brooke had gotten the message from R.J. Smiling, Brooke stated that it had contained the top ten reasons that his parents should let him go to school in Los Angeles. Ridge had found it persuasive, and Brooke said they'd talk about it.\n\n\nRidge left to pick up Will, and after Ridge had gone, Brooke asserted to Katie that Ridge going to get Will was insensitive to Bill. Katie replied that Ridge was doing her a favor, so she could stay there and work. Brooke asserted that Bill should get more time with his son while Katie worked.\n\n\nBrooke asked Katie to allow Will to spend one night with his father, but Katie said it was out of the question because Will needed structure and consistency. Brooke asserted that Katie was keeping Bill from his son and the company. Katie scoffed, saying it wasn't her intention.\n\n\nKatie said Bill had created the situation, and Brooke asked if Katie even enjoyed what she was doing at Spencer. Brooke felt that everyone knew that there was just one CEO for Spencer, but Karen was adamant about keeping Katie in the position. Brooke said that she was appealing to Katie because everyone was happy but Bill, who sat at home alone all day, doing nothing.\n\n\nKatie knew that Bill lived for the company and figured that it was hard for him to be at home; however, she said that things had changed, and they all needed to make adjustments. Brooke felt it was time for Katie to make an adjustment. Katie asked what that would be.\n\n\nBrooke said that Bill had wronged Katie, but he'd made his penitence. Brooke thought she was just asking Katie to do what was fair by giving Bill equal custody and his place in the company. Brooke said that Katie knew it was the right thing to do. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam and Hope walk into the animal shelter where they agree that shelters like these do so much good. Hope says Liam's story will help spread the news. Katie and Ridge share several kisses. She says if he keeps this up she will get nothing done. But who needs food when she has these lips. And although she has plenty to do, nothing is more important than he is. He likes the sound of that. She glances at her clock and says she does not like Will being gone even for a few hours but it is good that he is spending some time with Bill. Ridge reminds her that Bill made his bed. She knows but she doesn't want him to think she is punishing him. Ridge says she is not punishing Bill so she has no reason to feel bad. She should always feel good especially when she is with him. Liam meets Brandon and introduces Hope. Brandon says Pam told him about Liam's article and he's glad to be able to help. He shows them around the facility and talks about the under-funded and overcrowded kennels. Many pets are put down each year because they can't find homes. It's obviously a serious problem and one of the main reasons is because they are not spayed or neutered. Liam says he has been an advocate since a small kid as his mother used to foster dogs for a rescue organization. Hope tells Brandon that Liam has one of the biggest hearts that she knows. Brandon shows them around and says this is brand new and houses 600 animals. Brandon is on call and takes them to meet Leslie, the kennel supervisor and asks if she will take them to the medical area. She shows them the surgery room and kennels where they stay after surgery. And they are rehabilitated. Hope and Liam meet Dr. DiSanto, the vet who explains more why neutering and spaying is so important to prevent many medical problems later as they age. Liam takes notes from all that he interviews. They meet some of the furry friends and Hope thanks Liam for bringing her here. At Brooke's Bill is playing with Will. He tells Brooke that this just reminds him how quickly time flies by and how precious it is. He has to find some way to spend more time with Will. Brooke goes to her purse ad slips out the papers. She's deep in thought and seems to have made a decision. Bill continues to grouse that Katie is not being fair. She has a company .his company to run yet he still gets scraps, two hours here, one there. Will can not even spend the night. Katie will send someone over after him in about an hour. He wants his son to get to know him and trust him and not just be an every other Sunday dad. He wants him to light up when he sees Bill and not punch a hole in the wall like he did with his own father. Brooke tells him she has some place to go, she will see him later. Brooke walks into Katie's office and interrupts a kiss. She starts off by asking Ridge if he'd gotten a text from RJ about wanting to come home to school in Los Angeles. She says they will have to discuss that. She tells Katie that she needs to speak to her alone. Ridge says he was leaving anyway. He will bring Will back to Katie in a bit. Brooke is displeased and tells Katie that is not a good idea. That is so insensitive to Bill. If Katie has to work and can't go herself, then give Bill a little more time with Will. Brooke says she realizes there is still bad blood between she and Bill, but he is going through a very difficult time right now and she is only asking Katie to be fair. Just let him spend one night. Katie says no, he had him all afternoon. That was the deal and she's not letting him spend the night. Will is a toddler and he needs structure and consistency. They are on a schedule. Brooke accuses her of keeping Will away from Bill. Katie says that is not her intention. Brooke accuses her of keeping Bill away from his company too. Katie says he did that, not her. Brooke reminds her that they are all happy. She is with Ridge, Brooke is with Bill but Bill is the only one miserable. He sits home with nothing to do all day and yet he built this company to what it is today. Katie realizes it must be hard but they've all had to make adjustments. Brooke suggests that it is time for Katie to make an adjustment too. Give Bill back his business. He's done his penance. She knows he hurt Katie, but he's paid the price and it is killing him. Give Bill equal custody of Will and give him his company back. That is what is fair. Katie knows in her heart that is the right thing to do.",
