Ridge had tried to stick it out for a year, but upon learning that Eric wanted to extend the contract beyond a year, Ridge decided that he couldn't make it.\n\n\nBrooke believed Ridge was angry with Eric for his choices and angry with Rick because Rick wasn't treating Ridge with the respect he was accustomed to. She said Ridge couldn't make life-altering decisions based upon emotions. Ridge yelled that Eric and Brooke hadn't been around to see Rick treat everyone but Maya like second-class citizens.\n\n\nRidge said he wasn't emotional. He was apathetic and had decided that he didn't want to spend his years there under those ridiculous circumstances. Eric asserted that he supported Rick but certainly didn't want to lose Ridge, who was the best in the business. Eric said it was a family business, and he didn't want his son to walk out.\n\n\nRidge didn't want to leave his birthright -- at least what had been his birthright until Eric had given it to \"Ricky.\" Ridge stated that it was Eric's prerogative to stubbornly stand by, but it was Ridge's prerogative to refuse to put up with it.\n\n\nLater, Brooke and Eric entered the studio. They couldn't believe what had just happened. Eric hadn't realized that Ridge had been so close to breaking, and Eric wished he'd done more to appease Ridge. Eric felt that losing Ridge and the designs would be a big blow to the company. \"To you,\" Brooke added. Eric said that he and Ridge got angry but always solved it without bailing on each other.\n\n\nBrooke claimed that Ridge always held his breath when he was upset, and then he'd break his toys if no one noticed. She was confident that Ridge and Rick had had a meeting in which \"Rick had treated him with disrespect as usual,\" but Ridge would get over it after he cooled down.\n\n\nEric wasn't so sure. Eric understood Ridge's view and said designs didn't fall out of the air. It took time and trial and error to create a successful collection. Eric believed Ridge was upset that his work wasn't properly appreciated, and Eric didn't think Ridge was wrong about it. Brooke became worried that Eric was removing his support for Rick.\n\n\nEric wasn't, but he had to figure out a way to set some parameters that should have been there at the beginning. He said the problem was that Rick didn't have to listen to Eric. Brooke asserted that Rick would listen, and Rick lived to please Eric. She suggested that he go through the influential Maya. Eric said he wouldn't be too proud to do so if it got down to it.\n\n\nBrooke said Maya was a presence they'd have to live with because Rick had bought Maya a ring. Brooke wished Rick would wait, but it was time that Rick became fulfilled in life. Eric believed that Maya had proven herself, even though the couple's reunion had been questionable. Brooke and Eric agreed that Rick was committed, and Brooke said the proposal could happen any day.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Maya was surprised that Rick condoned secrets. Rick said that surprises were good, but earth-shattering secrets weren't. He was sure he didn't have to worry about it with her. Maya felt lucky to have their life and never wanted it to end. He asked why she'd think it would.\n\n\nRick liked good secrets, not the bad ones that fell from the sky and decimated lives. He needed the stability Maya provided -- right down to his position at Forrester. Maya said she couldn't take credit for it, but Rick insisted that she could. In his view, her support had given him the confidence to success. \"No matter how much it bugs Ridge that I'm winning, he can't do anything to stop me,\" Rick added.\n\n\nMaya wondered why people couldn't remain in the present. She'd been struggling to stay present after Nicole had blown open the door to the past. She wanted to shut her brain off because there was nothing more than spending the moment with him. She loved sharing her life with him and couldn't wait to share more.\n\n\n\"There's more?\" Rick asked, chuckling. Maya promised that he'd know everything about her one day. She just hoped he wouldn't be disappointed. Rick said it would never happen. He decided that life couldn't be just about hard work, and they should take a time-out to celebrate away from the office.\n\n\nRick proposed that the pair go to Big Bear, and Maya asked where to sign up for that. Rick pointed to his lips. They kissed, and Rick said they'd have a private celebration. Maya asked what they were celebrating, and he stated that she'd find out.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Nicole thought of Wyatt. Carter arrived to collect his bag, and she teased him about his big muscles. He teased her about Wyatt, and she changed the subject to Maya wanting to tell Rick. Carter thought it was good because Rick had a right to know that Maya was transgender. Nicole revealed that she'd changed her mind about Maya revealing herself to Rick.\n\n\nCarter readily guessed that it was because Nicole felt she had something to lose with Wyatt. Nicole refused to apologize for finding a hot, rich guy. Carter warned that her guy could be rebounding, but Nicole, who knew her value, wasn't worried about another woman's ghost.\n\n\nNicole asked what good it was for Rick to know. \"It's not like, at the stroke of midnight, she's gonna change back or something. They are happy together!\" Nicole contended. Carter guessed Maya wouldn't tell Rick that she had been born physically male. Nicole asserted that she wouldn't let Maya do it.\n\n\nLater, Carter entered the CEO's office to asked Ridge if he and Caroline could do an international tour. Ridge said Carter could ask Caroline, but \"as of ten minutes ago, I quit.\" Carter was outraged to hear it and hoped Ridge was joking because the company needed Ridge more than ever. Ridge felt the company would do just fine, but he wouldn't hang around during Eric's extension of Rick's contract.\n\n\nCarter uttered that it was a disaster. Ridge said the good news was that the numbers were up. Ridge stated that it had never been that way in the past, and Forrester had been about family, working together, and creating things together. Ridge said he should be running the company. He'd worked his whole life for it, but it was no longer an option. Carter didn't think it had to be that way.\n\n\nRidge refused to take orders from someone who didn't know the difference between a bow and a boa. Carter asked about Caroline. Ridge said she'd do what she had to do, but it wouldn't affect him. \"This is bad,\" Carter stated. Shrugging, Ridge relayed that he couldn't bow to King Rick and Queen Maya. Ridge walked to the door, but Carter grimaced and said Ridge needed to know something. \"Something that might stop you from walking out that door,\" Carter hinted.\n\n\nRidge appreciated Carter trying to reason with him as a friend. Ridge said he'd be okay, he'd find another job, and Forrester would be fine. Carter insisted that Forrester needed to return to what it had once been. Ridge said to take it up with Eric, but Carter insisted that Ridge hear him out. Frustrated, Ridge predicted that Carter would ask that Ridge just hang in there for Rick's next mistake.\n\n\nCarter replied that it wasn't what he had to say. Carter said it wasn't about Rick; it was about Maya. Ridge rasped that Rick and Maya would get married, and Ridge didn't intend to bow to her, too. Carter hinted that the marriage wouldn't happen. Ridge asked what Carter had to say about Maya.\n\n\nCarter stated that he'd thought he'd known everything about his former fianc\u00e9e, but he'd been wrong. Carter rambled about Maya being on edge for the last month, and he'd thought it had been because Nicole had arrived. Ridge asked what the point was. \"This is hard,\" Carter said, sighing. He revealed that he'd promised not to tell, but he needed to keep Ridge from leaving.\n\n\nCarter mumbled that he still couldn't believe it. He said Forrester had invested a lot in Maya, the face of their lines. Rick had structured an entire brand around her and poised her as the future matriarch. \"If anyone knew -- \" Carter began to say. Ridge said Carter was killing him and to spit it out.\n\n\nCarter said he'd heard Maya and Nicole discussing a secret. \"Maya is a chosen name...\" Carter hinted. Chuckling, Ridge said that people in that city changed their names all the time. Ridge didn't understand the \"secret.\" Carter added that Maya's birth name was Myron. Ridge became confused. \"Maya Avant is transgender,\" Carter told Ridge.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells Ridge to dial it down a little bit. He can not act so hastily. Ridge says yes he can. He thought he could suck it up for a few months or even the year that Rick runs the company but he can't. He's out. Maya tells Rick that she is so lucky to have found him and this life. He says little secrets like keeping birthday surprises a surprise are okay but he knows he does not have to worry about any big ones with her. He needs stability and he has found that with her. He is taking no prisoners. And as much as it bugs Ridge there is no way he can stop Rick. Nicole smiles to herself when she thinks about Wyatt and their little trip in the sky. She runs into Carter and he teases her about Wyatt. Then she says Maya is thinking about telling Rick she is transgender. She used to want her to but not now, too much will be at stake. Ridge tells Brooke that he is not being emotional. They have not been here to see Rick and he has. Rick gives only Maya any leeway. Eric says this is a family business and Ridge can not just walk away. Ridge says he knows. He thought this was his birthright until Eric gave it to Rick. But it is Eric's to do with what he wants, that is his prerogative just as quitting is now Ridge's prerogative. Carter laughs that is odd that Nicole is working this fast so all he can imagine that Nicole is now looking out for her own best interests with Wyatt. She argues that there is no reason for Maya to tell Rick and upset things now. She may not be able to stop her but she sure is gonna try to convince her not to. Maya tells Rick there is nothing more important than being right there with him and sharing her life with him. One day he will know everything he needs to know about her. She just hopes she does not disappoint him. Eric is upset and tells Brooke that if they lose Ridge's designs it will be a huge blow to the company. They can not just bale on each other. She tells Eric that Ridge is not going to leave. He just needs some time to cool off. Eric is not so sure. He understands where he is coming from. He puts in a lot of hard work and he is resenting that his work is not fully appreciated. He is not pulling back his support from Rick but he needs to sit down with both of them and work this out. She tells him that Rick is going to propose so this will include Maya too. Carter brings some papers in to Ridge and is shocked when Ridge tells him to fax them to Caroline .. as of ten minutes ago he has quit. Carter thinks it is a joke .this company needs him now more than ever. This is a disaster. Ridge says the good news is that the numbers are up but it is different than the days when they all worked together. Now this is a new one and he is going to peddle his services somewhere else. What Caroline decides to do will not affect him. He can not bow to Queen Maya, he does not have it in him. Carter tells him before he leaves there is something he needs to know that might prevent him from walking out that door. Eric tells Brooke that he knows Rick wants to propose as he told him about that. They both want their son to be happy and it sounds like it will be any day now. Rick tells Maya they need a little alone time away so how does Big Bear sound just for the two of them for a celebration. Carter tells Ridge to close the door, this is private. He needs to hear him out. Carter gets adamant and says it is not about Rick, it is about Maya. Ridge says no, it is still the same. He will now have to bow to Maya if they marry. Carter says he was engaged to Maya once and this is hard, very hard and he promised he would not tell but ..Rick structured the whole line around her. Ridge tells him to not drag this out .. spit it out. Slowly Carter says Maya is a chosen name, she was not born with that name. Ridge says this is L.A., that is not a crime. Carter says but she was born with the name Myron .Maya is a transgender.",
