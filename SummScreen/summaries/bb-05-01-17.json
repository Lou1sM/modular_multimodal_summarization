    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Lieutenant Baker placed Sally Spectra under arrest. Thomas stopped the procedure and asked for a moment alone with Sally. Steffy didn't think it was a good idea, but after Thomas implored her, she and the others quietly left Sally and Thomas alone in the CEO's office.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Lt. Baker, Carter, R.J., Coco, and Steffy gathered around Pam's desk. They updated Pam on what had happened with Sally, and Pam said it let Coco off the hook for having to turn her sister in. Baker said the only thing left was to book Sally and take her downtown. R.J. believed that if they gave Thomas and Sally a moment, the two could work something out.\n\n\nCoco asked if it was really possible to do so. Steffy said Sally had committed many crimes against the Forresters. Steffy didn't want to see Sally go to prison, but Steffy believed that Sally had brought it upon herself and had to pay the price.\n\n\nR.J. and Coco went into the design office. Baker grew impatient waiting. He became happy when Pam said an intern would deliver him another hot dog with her special mustard on it. Steffy said she didn't relish sending Sally to prison, and Carter replied that Forrester didn't have to go through with it. Steffy insisted that they did or else it would be open season on Forrester for other design thieves. She asserted that Sally had crossed the legal line, and Forrester had to respond accordingly.\n\n\nIn the design office, R.J. asked how Sally had wound up confessing. Coco explained that she'd gone off on Sally, but she might have been too harsh on Sally, who'd been really stunned by Coco's feelings and the charges. Coco conveyed that Sally had said she'd take care of it, and R.J. knew the rest. Suddenly realizing that she had to tell Grams, Coco whipped out her phone.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Saul and Shirley were thrilled about the orders that kept rolling in. Saul stated that he could use some help. Shirley replied that Darlita would soon arrive. \"But you're standing right there,\" Saul meekly replied. Rolling her eyes, Shirley sat beside Saul to help him sort orders. She asked where Sally was, and Saul replied that Sally wasn't in the building.\n\n\nShirley received a phone call from Coco and told Coco that Spectra could use help with all the orders. Coco said that they might as well stop because Coco and Sally were at Forrester, where Sally had just turned herself in. Coco didn't know what would happen but believed that Sally was in big trouble. Coco said she'd keep Shirley posted and clicked off the line before Shirley could ask any questions.\n\n\nSaul grew upset when Shirley gave him the news that Sally had walked into Forrester with her big mouth and confessed everything. \"To grand larceny?\" he asked. Shirley guessed so -- if that was the crime. \"Oh, how could she! All the beautiful orders,\" Shirley said, pouting and hugging the invoices. Saul told her to forget the orders and asked what would happen to Sally.\n\n\nBack in the Forrester CEO's office, Sally told Thomas that she'd never been more sorry. Thomas quipped that it would be great if regrets happened before incidents did. She said she should have listened to her heart, and none of it had been worth the look in his eyes. She'd thought a successful relaunch had been the most important thing in the world, but she'd figured out that she'd already had something much more valuable.\n\n\nThough Sally knew what she'd done was inexcusable, she asked if Thomas would let her explain why she'd done it. Thomas said he'd love to hear it. Sally claimed she'd gotten caught up, and her family could be relentless. \"My Grams with the 'in-your-face,' and my Aunt Sally with her velvet glove,\" Sally said. She claimed that there had been a lot of pressure to get Spectra back up and running. She'd had many people counting on her, but she'd wanted to do it right.\n\n\nSally had wanted a company in her image and with her vision, but Jarrett's review had thrown her for a loop. Sally had doubted herself. Sally said Grams wouldn't let up about moving forward and returning to their old ways in order to get out of debt and pay their employees. Sally conveyed that Shirley had had the idea of getting Coco to steal the designs. \"You just went along with it,\" Thomas gleaned. Sally replied that he made it sound as if it had been easy.\n\n\nSally explained how hard it had been to think about using her sister and betraying the Forresters, who'd been so nice to her. Thomas stated that, in the end, it had been exactly what she'd done. \"Damn it, Sally. I loved you. I would have been happy to help you with anything if you had just asked,\" he said. He told her that he'd believed in her, and all she'd had to do was to reach out; however, she'd stolen from him and his family instead. He asked how she could do it.\n\n\nBack in the Forrester corridor, Steffy stood off to the side with Carter. She asked if he thought she was doing the right thing. He said that, from a business standpoint, there was no doubt.\n\n\nCoco and R.J. emerged from the design office so that Coco could speak to Steffy. Coco said that her sister was far from perfect, but Sally was a good person and had been there for Coco. Coco explained that Sally had confessed because she'd seen that it was killing Coco to have to turn Sally in. Coco knew it didn't change things, but her sister had a conscience. Coco felt that Sally knew she'd made a mistake, and Coco implored Steffy not to send Sally to prison.\n\n\nSteffy thought the way Coco felt about Sally was admirable. Steffy said she felt that way about Thomas; however, Sally had broken the law, and there were consequences. Steffy opened the door to the CEO's office, but Thomas asked for just a few more minutes. Steffy closed the door.\n\n\nTo Carter, Steffy said she wished Sally hadn't put them in that position. She recalled that she and Sally had had a moment. Carter seemed surprised to hear it. Steffy said Sally had been genuine, and Steffy had seen what Thomas had seen in Sally. Steffy didn't want \"that\" Sally to go to prison; however, \"this\" Sally, the thieving Sally, would get what she'd asked for.\n\n\nCoco approached Steffy again to ask for a different resolution. Coco suggested that Steffy sue Sally and Spectra and take the money and the building. Coco figured Spectra would go out of business, but she implored Steffy not to send Sally to prison. Steffy was silent, but her expression was full of conflict.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Sally said that whatever happened, she'd brought it upon herself. She'd sent her sister in there without her sister's consent and jeopardized her sister's career and happiness. Sally added that that was also what she'd done to Thomas and his family. Thomas understood Sally's circumstances, but he didn't understand why she hadn't gone to him for help.\n\n\nSally asserted that she'd told Thomas who she was. She was a Spectra, and lying and stealing were in her blood. She figured she had to stop thinking she was better because of her talent. She stated that Jarrett had schooled her on just how talented she really was, and she was a joke, just as he'd written. She called herself a criminal, headed to prison.\n\n\nSally promised Thomas that she'd stop production at Spectra. The company would go further into debt and have to close its doors, but she vowed she'd do what she could to make it right. She stated that they'd always have Australia. She began to cry as she recalled the wonderful things he'd said to her. She decided if someone was handed all he'd given her and managed to screw it up, then she hadn't deserved it in the first place.\n\n\nSally said that she was no good. \"So do yourself a favor. Don't walk. Run,\" She advised Thomas. Thomas told her that she couldn't order him to stay or to walk away. Sally said he'd have no choice if she was in prison -- unless he wanted to visit. She didn't know why he would. He replied that she wasn't in jail yet.\n\n\nSally claimed not to care if she went to prison. Thomas joked that it was because she'd fit in so well with the inmates. Sally claimed not to be a shrinking violet. She said she'd roll up her sleeves and get to swinging, and people would soon know not to mess with her. She stated that she was going where she belonged and would be with people who thought like her.\n\n\nSally wanted Thomas to know that she was ashamed. She said she'd thrown away what they'd had, and she should go to prison for doing that alone. She asked Thomas to get Baker because she was ready. Thomas went to the door. Sally turned around and stifled her sobs. Thomas touched her shoulder and drew her into a hug.\n\n\nBaker entered and asked if they were doing it. Steffy affirmed it and said to arrest Sally. Coco ran to Sally and hugged her. The sisters cried and said that they loved each other. When Baker pulled out his cuffs, Thomas asked if it was necessary. Baker replied that it was just until they got to the station.\n\n\nEveryone was sad as they watched Lieutenant Baker cuff Sally and walk her out of the office.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Lt. Baker informs Sally that she is under arrest for grand larceny and espionage. Before he takes her away Thomas wants to speak to her alone. She tells him that she is so sorry to put him through this. Shirley is ecstatic that more orders are pouring in. But she's worried about Sally and wonders where she is. Lt. Baker says he will take Sally downtown and book her but RJ is hoping Thomas talking to her that they will work something out. Steffy says she does not want Sally to go to prison but she brought this on herself and now has to pay the coincidences.

She claims everyone was counting on her and she wanted to do it right with her designs and her vision. But the first review made her doubt herself and Grams pushed her to go back to their original plan for knockoffs and it was her idea to use Coco with the camera. Thomas says he loved her and he would have helped her with anything if she had trusted and asked him. All she had to do was reach out; instead she stole from him and his family. Shirley tells Saul that Big Mouth just waltzed over to FC and turned herself in. Saul is besides himself. Coco tells Steffy that she understands if she does not want to hear her but there is something she would like to say. She knows what Sally did was wrong but she is not this evil, calculating person and she was caught in the middle of a big mistake. But as a sister she does not want to see her go to prison. Steffy says she understands but she does not like seeing her brother get hurt either so Sally will have to suffer the coincidences. Sally tells Thomas that he is looking at the world's biggest fool so she understands his position. She hurt her two favorite people in this world, him and Coco. But she told him who she was, a Spectra with lying and stealing in her DNA. She laments that she will stop production and tell the public no more products so she can at least do that. She says they had Australia but now he must not walk, but run as far away as he can. Coco tries again to get Steffy to reconsider and think of other damages less than prison. Sally says she will make it in prison. She is going where she belongs. She will roll up her sleeves and do what she has to do. They had a big, wonderful shot at something good but she threw it away so she deserves to go to prison, so get the ball rolling. Call the detective in. Thomas hugs her and she sheds a few tears before Lt. Baker comes in followed by a tearful Coco. Lt. Baker puts the cuffs on Sally and slowly leads her out the door.",
