Wyatt asked why he should care if Hope was spending time with Liam when Wyatt already knew that Wyatt was the one that Hope would end up with.\n\n\nWyatt pretended not to be listening as Quinn buzzed Pam to find out where Hope was. After the call, Quinn concluded that Hope was off with Liam. Wyatt murmured that equal time sucked.\n\n\nAt the shelter, Hope and Liam held hands as they toured the facility. They met councilman Parks and discussed the cultural shift in people's awareness of adoptions and animal treatment. Parks said that the euthanasia rate had been cut in half, and there were more and more adoptions; however, he expressed concern that uneducated pet owners might fail to understand how to care for their pets, and their pets would wind back up at the shelter.\n\n\nThe group talked about people getting exotic pets like rabbits for Easter or purchasing a snake without knowing how big it would get. Once the people realized they couldn't handle the pet, it wound up becoming a stray. The shelter was helping that problem by educating people through \"Forever Home,\" so that people would learn about their animals before buying or adopting them.\n\n\nNext, Liam and Hope met Brenda Barnette, the general manager of animal services. Brenda said that the dog pound had once been the place to avoid when looking for pets, but they'd garnered a reputation for rehabilitating pets for adoption. She felt that if they promoted the shelter well, people would turn there for pets, and the United States would become a no-kill nation very quickly.\n\n\nLiam and Hope went to the training area, where Brandon was training a fearful pit bull. As Brandon soothed the dog to get it to bond with him, he reminded them of the importance of spaying, neutering, and saving a life by picking a pet from the shelter.\n\n\nLater, Liam happened upon Hope cuddling a white cat. Hope cooed that she loved it, and she asked if she had to put it back in his cage. Liam replied that they didn't because the male cat had been adopted. \"He's ours,\" Liam replied, smiling, and Hope's eyes lit up with awe and joy.\n\n\nThe workers took the cat to prepare it for adoption, and Hope gleefully thanked Liam. She said that it was truly a day that she'd never forget. She grinned and hugged him. A song played as Hope flashed back on the remarkable and touching day she'd had with Liam.\n\n\nThe worker returned with Hope's \"Honey Butt,\" and as she held the cat, she said she couldn't believe that he was hers. She thanked Liam again and gratefully kissed him. Liam smiled.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie was sure Brooke wouldn't believe it, but Katie worked hard at Spencer and did a good job. Brooke responded that Katie wasn't Bill, and Katie quipped that some employees were glad for that. Brooke said that Katie, Ridge, and Brooke were all in better places, so Katie could stop punishing Bill and let him have his job back.\n\n\nBrooke wondered if Katie felt guilty that a mere one percent made Katie CEO. Katie asserted that Karen's fifty percent had made it happen, but Brooke noted that Karen obviously had issues with Bill. Brooke said Katie was a betrayed wife, and it was understandable that she'd want to torture Bill a little bit. Brooke stated that Katie had done that, and enough was enough.\n\n\nKatie refused to give up the job she loved, so Brooke asked that Katie at least give Bill more custody rights because Katie was at work most of the time. Katie refused to do it. She felt that Bill had left the marriage, which meant he couldn't have an all-access pass to Will.\n\n\nKatie decided that there was nothing Brooke could do about it, but Brooke replied that she couldn't accept that answer. Brooke didn't want to make their sibling relationship any worse; however, Brooke felt that Katie was wrong, and Brooke had to fix it if Katie wouldn't.\n\n\nKatie asserted that Karen wanted Katie in charge, but Brooke replied that Karen could only dictate that due to Katie's one percent ownership. Brooke had confirmed with Justin that as long as the ownership was equal between Bill and Karen, Bill would be CEO. Katie noted that she had her one percent, which meant that nothing would change.\n\n\nKatie decided that she had to go to meet Ridge and Will, but Brooke declared that Will would stay for the night with Brooke and Bill. Katie refused to let that happen, and Brooke said Katie had to stop punishing Bill. Katie still refused to let it happen, and Brooke stated that Katie had signed papers.\n\n\nKatie reminded Brooke that she'd destroyed the papers. \"Did I say that?\" Brooke asked, reaching into her purse. Brooke retrieved the papers and said that they were still valid. Brooke stated that the papers would return Bill as CEO and give him equal custody of Will.\n\n\nKatie grumbled that Brooke had switched the papers to make things right. \"Yes, for you. And now I need to make things right for Bill,\" Brooke concluded. Katie asked Brooke not to use the papers and said that Brooke knew what Bill had done to get Katie's signature. \"But you signed them, didn't you?\" Brooke responded. Brooke said the papers were legal, effective immediately.\n\n\nKatie decided that Bill was using Brooke, but Brooke replied that he didn't know anything about it. Brooke lectured that she'd tried to talk to Katie, and she'd tried to talk to Karen, but they hadn't listened. Brooke had to take matters into her own hands. Katie said she wouldn't let Brooke; however, Brooke responded, \"As you said: 'there's nothing you can do about it.'\"\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill was shocked when Ridge arrived to pick up Will. Bill was frustrated and guessed Katie was too busy to pick up the child herself. Ridge asked for the diaper bag, but Bill said Will wouldn't go anywhere with Ridge. Ridge thought that Katie and Bill needed to work out their problems themselves, but for the time being, Ridge was taking Katie's son out of there.\n\n\nBill muttered that he was sick of the situation and sick of waiting for his life to fall into place. Ridge replied that Bill at least had Brooke. Bill agreed, but he wanted it all. Bill raged that Katie had denied him time with his child out of spite, and she'd stolen his company. Bill asked if, man-to-man and father-to-father, Ridge felt right taking Bill's son.\n\n\nShrugging, Ridge said it was a complicated situation.  Bill decided he'd take Will to Katie once she was off work; however, Ridge insisted upon picking up the child as Katie had asked him to do. \"No, you're not,\" Brooke said, entering the house.\n\n\nRidge asked \"Logan\" not to make the situation ugly, but Brooke insisted that Will would stay there.  Bill asked what Brooke had done. Ridge's phone rang, and a distraught Katie was on the other line. Ridge listened, ended the call, and walked out of the house.\n\n\nBill seemed confused. Brooke pulled the papers from her purse, and Bill gaped as he took possession of them. He appeared emotional as he looked at the papers, his son, and Brooke. He tenderly kissed Brooke and pulled her into his arms. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Katie tells Brooke that she may not believe it but she is a good CEO. Brooke says Bill should not be apart from his company or his job. She points out that Katie is with Ridge now, a much better place, so stop punishing Bill. Just let him have his job back. Quinn tells Wyatt that she can handle this. He can go find Hope. Wyatt says that he knows she is with Liam so he doesn't care what they are doing. He's not worried as he knows he is the one she will end up with. Quinn pages Pam and tries to find out where Hope is if she is not in the building. She tells Wyatt that Hope is out gallivanting with Liam. Wyatt admits okay, equal time sucks. Hope and Liam continue to look over the animal shelter and meet up with Councilman Bernard Parks who agrees to answer some of Liam's questions for his article. He says there is a major shift in the euthanasia rate over the last few years. But if you leave here without understanding some of the medical issues, those animals will end up coming back. Hope says that is sad because a term she hears a lot and really loves if \"forever home.\" Later they meet Brenda, the manager of the Los Angeles Animal Services. She's been active in animal rescue for over 35 years. For many years the dog pound was a place you did not want to go. But after spending some time here you see that it is a place to go. They have love in all packages, big, little, young and old and they are all spayed and neutered. If they could get more people across the country when they are ready for a companion animal \u0096 go to a shelter we'd be a no-kill nation very quickly. Bill is surprised to look up and find Ridge and asks what he wants. Ridge says he is there to pick up Will for Katie. Bill makes a snarky remark that Katie is too busy to do this herself. And he refuses to let Ridge take Will. Ridge says he and Katie need to figure this out but meantime he is taking her son. Brooke tells Katie that she must feel bad that 1% made her CEO. She says no, Karen's 50% makes her CEO. Brooke says Karen has issues with Bill and she swooped in here ad took advantage. And she understands that Katie is the betrayed wife and wants to torture Bill a little bit. But he's paid the price. Enough is enough. It's time to make this right. Katie says again she loves this job and she is not going to walk away. Brooke asks if she will at least share custody of Will since Katie is working so much. Katie reminds her that Bill willingly walked away from the marriage so custody remains unchanged. And she is going to remain as CEO and there is nothing Brooke can do about that. Brooke says she can not accept that. They are sisters and she really doesn't want to do this, but what she is doing is wrong and if she doesn't fix it, Brooke will. Bill tells Ridge that he is sick of this; waiting for his life to fall in place. He wants it all, his son, his company and Brooke but Katie is denying him that and she's wrong. Katie tells Brooke that she's done her best to convince her but she has to go meet Ridge now as he is picking up Will. Brooke says no, Will is spending the night with her and Bill. She reminds Katie that she signed papers. Katie says Brooke destroyed them. Brooke says she did not ever say that. And they are still valid, returning Bill as CEO and equal custody of Will. Katie begs her not to use those papers against her. She knows what Bill did to get her to sign. Brooke says Bill is not using her as he knows nothing about this. She tried to talk to Karen and she talked to Katie just now but neither would listen. So now she has to take matters in her own hands to make it right. Bill tells Ridge that maybe \"man-to-man\" was too much to ask but Ridge is not taking Will anyplace. Ridge says his time is up and yes he is taking Will. Brooke walks in the door and says he is not. Will is staying here. Ridge gets a phone call and then abruptly leaves. Bill wonders what Brooke did. She hands him the papers and they hug. Hope falls in love with a white kitten as she holds him. Liam tells her that one has a new home; he's being adopted ..he's theirs. That brings a smile to her face and she calls the cat, Honey Butt. She thanks Liam for truly making this one of the best days yet and she kisses him.",
