    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Eric met with Ridge and asked what had happened in Australia that had ended Ridge's relationship with Brooke. Ridge looked uncomfortable. He had to answer a text message on his phone and later admitted he'd made a mistake. Eric said that Bill was in the picture again with Brooke. Ridge agreed, and he added, \"We all make mistakes.\" Ridge reminded Eric that Brooke had overlooked his mistakes in the past, and he had overlooked hers. He refused to give up on Brooke.\n\n\nEric agreed that Ridge could not give up on Brooke. He added that he had never given up on Quinn, and he said that instincts were very important. He added that he'd trusted Quinn from the very beginning. Ridge understood. \"I know how much you love her,\" Ridge said. Eric admitted that he and Quinn had had some rough patches and had broken up for a while, but he'd never been happier in his life. Ridge smiled and added that Eric was happy even though Spectra had \"stolen all our work.\"\n\n\nEric said it was important to have someone in one's life to count on. He added that having Quinn at his side made him feel that he could handle anything. Eric felt that Quinn was the wind at his back and never let him down. Eric said he was especially proud of Ridge. Ridge smiled and left.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn admitted her issues with Ridge to Ivy. She also discussed her problems with Katie working at Forrester. Ivy was amazed that Quinn had kissed Ridge. Quinn maintained it was nothing, and she had been worried because Brooke belonged with Ridge. Ivy said she could understand why Brooke felt the way she did.\n\n\nIvy told Quinn that Ridge had kissed his father's wife. It was not easy to understand. Quinn agreed, but she said it was over, and the worst of it was that Katie had been threatening her ever since. \"I am not going to live that way. I love my husband and would never betray or disappoint him ever again,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nIn another office, Katie and Brooke discussed that Brooke had ended her relationship with Ridge because of his relationship with Quinn. Brooke planned to marry Bill because she couldn't trust Ridge. Katie wondered if Brooke could trust Bill.\n\n\nBrooke scolded Katie and said that Bill had never let her down, and she worried that Katie had been blackmailing Ridge and Quinn. Brooke wondered how Katie had gone to work with Quinn at Forrester.\n\n\nKatie reminded her sister that she had run Forrester before, \"and did a damned good job.\" Katie was miffed that Quinn could have ulterior motives, but Katie couldn't. Brooke balked at Katie's reasoning.\n\n\nKatie noted that Eric had offered her a position, and she was inclined to take it because Will was in school. Brooke reminded Katie that Eric could never find out about Quinn and Ridge. \"Katie, don't undermine his marriage,\" Brooke advised. She added that Katie did not need to work side by side with Quinn. There were other jobs at Forrester that she could enjoy.\n\n\nQuinn and Ivy barged into the meeting between Katie and Brooke. Quinn professed her total commitment to Eric and said nothing would ever happen again with Ridge. Quinn noted that Brooke was wearing Bill's ring, but Ridge still wanted to have a life with her. Brooke maintained it was her business and not Quinn's. \"You need to be with Ridge,\" Quinn blurted out to Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke said that they all needed to focus on work, and Katie needed to stop threatening Quinn. Brooke added that she would not be returning to Ridge. She wanted everyone to agree that no one would tell Eric about Quinn and Ridge. Ridge entered and said they had to stop arguing and move past the issue.\n\n\n\"My dad is happier than ever, and the only people who know are right here in this room. Let's put this to rest once and for all,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nKatie smiled and said that as long as nothing happened between Ridge and Quinn, she would never say anything. Quinn maintained that she and Ridge did not have feelings for each other -- it had been a senseless mistake.\n\n\nRidge maintained that he loved his father very much, and it was important to him. He told Katie to get past her sense of justice needing to be served. Ridge, Brooke, and Quinn agreed it was not Katie's job to hold threats over their heads.\n\n\nRidge maintained that he had already lost the most important relationship to him -- with Brooke. He wondered if Katie wanted to destroy the entire family.\n\n\n\"I have paid the price. Do you want my dad to pay, too?\" Ridge asked. Katie smirked and again stated that as long as nothing else happened, she would remain silent. Everyone but Brooke and Ridge left the office.\n\n\nBrooke said she was committed to Bill. Ridge begged her not to leave him because he needed her in his life. \"I am marrying Bill and committed to Bill,\" she said. Ridge looked away but promised to fight for her. He whispered that she would always be his Logan. A tear streamed own Brooke's cheek.\n\n\nAt home, Eric sketched, and Pam delivered lunch. Pam noted that Sally had stolen his entire collection and had to be punished. \"I have Quinn, and that makes everything a lot easier to deal with,\" Eric said. Pam nodded.\n\n\nEric recalled that he hadn't felt he had anything left to give and had been prepared to retire, but Quinn had persuaded him to return to work. He had a new spark because of her, and Quinn had pulled the whole family together, he noted. He knew things would be better. Pam agreed. Eric said he had renewed his special connection to Ridge. \"No one supports my marriage more than Ridge does,\" Eric said.\n\n\n",

As the discussion shifts to Katie working side by side with Quinn, Brooke call her sister out on blackmailing Quinn and Ridge. Katie insists that the job offer was a natural development. When Ivy returns from Australia much sooner than expected, she is stunned to find out that Katie is now part of the jewelry team. Quinn admits to Ivy that Katie knows about her and Ridge kissing, but promises Eric's niece once more that she will no longer betray her husband. Eric makes another attempt to educe the real reason why he and Brooke decided to end their relationship from Ridge. Later, Pam joins Eric for coffee and remarks how impressed she is by the positive influence Quinn is having on his life.

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn tells Ivy that they did not know she was on her way back from Australia when she offered Katie the job with the jewelry. Brooke tells Katie that it is up to judge and jury if Sally goes to jail but she was hauled off. Katie notices Brooke's ring from Bill and sees they are engaged again. Brooke asks Katie if there is a chance she is blackmailing Quinn and Ridge. Quinn tells Ivy that she is just keeping an eye on Katie and she really does not want her working here. Eric tells Ridge they have been so busy with the new collection he has not asked about him and Brooke. They worked together before and it worked so it could again. Ridge says yes but she is wearing Bill's ring again. Eric cannot understand why Ridge won't tell him what happened in Australia for them to call off the wedding. Quinn fills Ivy in that Katie saw her and Ridge on the beach but he told her it meant nothing but Katie is threatening to tell Eric. That is too much power so she gave her the job to appease Eric. But she will not live that way. Ridge says he made a mistake and he needs to fix it. Everyone makes mistakes. If Brooke can forgive him then he certainly can forgive her. Eric says he and Quinn have had some ups and downs but he does not think he could make it without her. He loves her so much. She is the wind at his back and will never let him down. So if Ridge thinks he has a future with Brooke then do not shy away from that. Katie assures Brooke that she is not trying to undermine Eric's marriage. Quinn also notices Brooke's ring and reminds her that Ridge still wants a future with her. Brooke says she called that off and is now engaged to Bill. Katie tells Brooke she did not get this job from blackmail; in fact she used to run this place. And when Quinn offered her this job she took it so she could work with Brooke and even Eric. She hates what went on between Quinn and Ridge and what it did to Brooke and Ridge and what it could do to Eric. Ridge tells all in the room they are the only ones that knows the mistake he made and it will not happen again so they all need to put it to rest. No need to tell Eric anything. Eric confides in Pam that Quinn gives him focus. It wasn't that long ago that he thought he was retired and wanted out of the company but she changed all of that. Nobody has changed Ridge more than Quinn has and he is grateful. Quinn tells Katie and Brooke they cannot keep holding this over their head. Ridge agrees that this mistake is not going to tear up this entire family. He tells Ivy he appreciates her silence and wants to keep it that way. His relationship with his father is all that matters to him. Quinn agrees that she and Ridge have no feelings toward each other. Katie smirks that as long as nothing else happens between Ridge and Quinn then she won't say anything. Ridge tells Brooke that he cannot lose her. He knows she took Bill's ring because she thought she could not trust him but she can. He states he will fight for her. She will always be his Logan.",
