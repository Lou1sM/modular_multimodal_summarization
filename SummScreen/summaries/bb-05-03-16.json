    "tvmega_recap": "Julius says Sasha is a liar. She stole Nicole's boyfriend so another woman often believes another woman without finding out the facts. So why would Nicole believe Sasha over him. Maya tells Viv that she knows Sasha had a tough childhood but she actually had all the advantages that Nicole had so it wasn't that bad. Viv recounts the mother was like one big long string of hard times. At least Viv knew what she was getting with Julius and he has not surprised her once. She does not think Sasha came to Los Angeles to work but to find that life she used to have with the Avants. Zende does not understand when Sasha tells him that Julius is her father and Nicole is her sister though she never knew it until today. And no one else has ever known until today. Julius always left a little bit of room so that she could be close to Nicole and the family but after today with Nicole now hating her, that will all be gone. Julius tells Nicole that Sasha's mother is not a bad mother but she cooked up this story. He tried to show compassion. Nicole mocks him for that \u0096 yeah like he had compassion for Maya when she was growing up. She makes fun of him being so cold, and hurting her mother over and over with his ways. And this about Sasha will stab her through the heart. He has tears as he says he tried to do better but it was not easy when over and over you lose and lose. Viv tells Maya and Rick that she would never call that little room home but she needs to get back to it. Julius says the California market is in a bubble and he has not found another place for them. Julius admits to Nicole that when Myron was little Viv had told him he was too harsh with him while his own dad said he was not strong enough. Viv turned on him in private and pulled away. Since then he has never betrayed her and Nicole will not tell her. When the time comes he will be the one to tell her. Nicole is at the room alone when Viv comes in. She sees how tense Nicole is and asks if it has anything to do with her father. Sasha goes home to the Forresters and Julius is not far behind. They are alone when he says life was a dream and they are all trying to make the best of it. He dreams his dream and she dreams hers. None of them get all they want but just enough to keep them happy and not to give each other trouble. He points his finger at her and says she did not tell Nicole the entire truth. He gave her his wife to look over her and a house over her head and included her with his family and all he asked of her was for her to keep her mouth quiet but she was too selfish. She may be his daughter but she will never be his family!",
