    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Zende said he didn't relish seeing Sally go to prison. Nicole and he discussed him being human after all. As they kissed, the newlyweds remarked upon how they might have conceived the previous night. She said they'd been trying since the honeymoon. Zende didn't mind trying as much as possible.\n\n\nTalk turned to the Forrester designers trying to churn out a whole new collection within a matter of weeks. Zende said that they couldn't do it without help. He handed Nicole a sketchpad and said to take a look. Nicole was surprised to see designs inside. Zende asked her what she thought he'd been doing each night after she'd gone to bed. The designs were his contribution to the Forrester crisis. \"I mean, I knew you could draw, but...\" Nicole said.\n\n\nZende asked if Nicole liked them, and she asked if he'd shown them to anyone. Zende hadn't, but he planned on it. Being a photographer had been great for him, but what he really wanted to do was to design for the company.\n\n\nLater, Nicole was working behind the desk and explaining Zende's new career passion to Maya. Nicole said she'd just learned about it, but Zende had been sketching every night. She said he really wanted to do it and had just gone to talk to Steffy and Thomas. Maya wondered how they would react. Nicole hoped it would be well because it was important to Zende, who really wanted to make his mark as a Forrester.\n\n\nMaya hoped Zende knew that becoming a designer didn't happen overnight. Nicole remarked that it hadn't taken Thomas that long. Maya recalled that Thomas had paid his dues, and his father had mentored him. Nicole said that Ridge might do the same for his nephew. Maya thought it was possible, but at that time, the team had its hands full.\n\n\nNicole said it was why Zende thought it was the time to step up. Maya reasoned that there might not be time to train, but Nicole said he might not need training. She thought his designs were good. Maya replied that Nicole was a loyal wife. Nicole explained that Zende was an artist. He wanted to design and have a connection with the family.\n\n\nMaya hoped that Zende didn't get his hopes up too quickly. Nicole remarked that Zende wanted to be a contributing member of the Forrester family. Maya and Nicole agreed that if he wanted it nearly as badly as he'd wanted Nicole, then Thomas and Steffy would have their hands full.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Thomas showed Steffy the designs he and Eric had been up all night creating. Eric had left Thomas' place around one in the morning, but Thomas had remained up the whole night. He said designing took his mind off the whole thing with Sally. Whenever he took a break, he'd envision her in handcuffs. Thomas remarked that Sally was out on a bail, and he'd hate to see her go to prison.\n\n\nSteffy asked how the talk had gone with Sally before the arrest. Thomas relayed that Sally had a lot of regrets. He said Sally had been under her grandmother's influence, and he wished Sally had just turned to him. He let Steffy know that Spectra would stop production. Steffy didn't know what good it would do because the designs had been exposed, and some knockoffs had probably shipped out. Thomas still wished he could help Sally through \"this.\"\n\n\nIt sounded to Steffy as if Thomas had forgiven Sally. Thomas still felt betrayed but said Sally hadn't set out to screw him. Steffy said Sally had wound up doing just that, and thanks to the Spectra crew, Forrester was in crisis mode. Steffy asked how much longer until the collection was done. Thomas replied that he didn't know.\n\n\nZende entered and asked how things were going with creating a whole new line. Thomas wished they had three more designers. Zende asked how Thomas felt about having one more. He handed Thomas a sketchpad and requested that Thomas take a look. As Thomas flipped through the designs in the pad, Steffy asked who'd drawn them. \"Me,\" Zende replied.\n\n\n\"Since when?\" Steffy asked. Zende replied that he'd been doing it for a while, but it had started to pick up after the Spectra show. He said that he had more, and he really wanted to help out. \"Interesting,\" Thomas murmured. Steffy said Zende was a photographer. Zende reasoned that he was way more valuable in the design room. He said he'd taken to heart what Thomas had said about looking out for one's own future.\n\n\nZende wanted to contribute, even though he was still learning. He said it was family tradition to work hard, move up, and excel. He knew that he could do it. He asked his cousins to take another look because there was good stuff in there. Steffy gave Zende a fake smile and looked over Thomas' shoulder at the sketches.\n\n\nAfter a long period of silence, Zende asked what his cousins thought of the work. Steffy agreed with Thomas' previous assessment that the designs were interesting. Zende replied that it wasn't the word he was looking for. Thomas stated that Zende really did have some talent. Zende asked if Forrester could work with it. Thomas said that Zende knew the situation.\n\n\nZende said the situation was that Forrester was desperate after Spectra had stolen the designs. Steffy stated that they didn't have time to train a novice right then. Zende asked if they thought it was the work of a novice, and Thomas reasoned that Zende didn't have experience. Zende believed that \"this\" would give him just \"that,\" in the same way that Ridge had fast-tracked Thomas. Zende asked them to be straight and tell him if he'd ever get a real opportunity there.\n\n\nSteffy replied that there was always opportunity for growth. \"But these don't cut it,\" Zende concluded. He asked if not even one of them could be passed along to Ridge or Eric. Zende asked for pointers to modify the work, but Steffy said he was really putting them on the spot. Thomas emphasized that they were in crisis mode and needed experience.\n\n\nZende doubted that Ridge had said that to Thomas when Thomas had first wanted to design. Thomas asserted that Zende knew how hard Ridge had been on Thomas and how hard Ridge still was on Thomas. Zende wanted to get real for a moment, and he said that Forrester kids got all the breaks. Steffy stated that Zende was one of them. \"Then give me a break,\" Zende said. Thomas asked Zende to understand that the timing was bad.\n\n\nZende said he had to wonder if he'd ever get a real break there. Steffy asked why he'd say that. Zende reasoned that he wasn't really a Forrester. He said he was a Dominguez. He had hoped it didn't matter, but he was starting to think it did. Steffy told him that he was as much of a Forrester as the rest of them. Zende asked if he'd been asked to design or even considered.\n\n\nThomas replied that they hadn't known that \"Zen\" wanted to design. Zende said that he'd just told them, and he asked if he'd honestly get a shot based on his work. Zende concluded that he wasn't the same as they were because he was adopted. \"By Kristen Forrester,\" Thomas noted. Thomas insisted that Zende was family and asked where the doubts stemmed from.\n\n\nZende replied that it was just something he'd been thinking about. He'd taken a risk by asking for a chance, but they'd shut him down. Steffy and Thomas said Zende was off base. Zende concluded that he wasn't a Forrester; he was a Dominguez and proud of it.\n\n\nLater, Steffy closed the office door and wondered where all of that had originated with Zende. Thomas understood that Zende was trying to find out where he belonged. It reminded Thomas of Sally, who'd been slammed on her first preview. Steffy said Zende might need to learn the same lesson. Thomas replied that it wasn't easy, and Sally hadn't been the same.\n\n\nSteffy hoped Zende wouldn't go down the stealing road. She advised Thomas to get over the betrayer Sally, who wasn't worth the heartache. Steffy left, and Thomas immediately began flashing back on his relationship with Sally.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally thanked Saul for bailing her out. Saul said he couldn't stand the thought of her behind bars. Sally replied that she still had prison time looming over her. Sally instructed Saul, Darlita, and Shirley to stop all production because they were shutting the rathole down. Shirley asserted that no one was sending Sally to jail, and they weren't shutting down.\n\n\nSally conveyed that the Forresters would take Spectra's inventory and assets. In her view, they were out of business and had to close their doors. Saul didn't want to see Sally's dream die, and Darlita asked what would happen with the orders. Sally said the orders were bogus, and they couldn't ship anything because the cops were all over them.\n\n\nC.J. arrived and said the place looked like a locker room after a defeat. Shirley quipped that it was halftime, but Sally asserted that it was over. C.J. agreed that it was over, and it was because Sally had confessed, something his mother never would have done. Sally expressed that she had had no choice and had needed to spare Coco from turning in her own sister.\n\n\nSally instructed Saul to put everything in the warehouse, and the Forresters would figure out what to do with the stuff. C.J. said that the building would be demolished. Shirley told C.J. that he wouldn't close up on them. C.J. said they hadn't paid him any rent, which was how foreclosures happened. Darlita remarked that she'd been buying lottery tickets.\n\n\nSally asked what was owed. C.J. said it was one hundred thousand dollars. Shirley got upset, but he repeated that they hadn't been paying him. Sally said they'd had a good run, and C.J. replied that they'd lasted longer than he'd thought they would. C.J. believed they would have lasted longer if Sally had owned up to her heritage. \n\n\nSally guessed he meant being a thief. C.J. didn't think his mother would appreciate the term. He called it pirating instead. Sally said she'd learned that she wasn't like her aunt. C.J. advised Sally to take the medicine, clear out, and be done with it.\n\n\nAfter C.J. had gone, Shirley tried to convince Sally that it was time to buckle in and not bail out. Sally told Shirley to stop dreaming. Because they'd stolen, it was time to pay the piper. Sally said they'd been shamed and humiliated -- \"at least I was.\" Sally said she was facing jail and still had a nut to pay off. She asked for some time alone, and Saul, Shirley, and Darlita walked out of the office. Once she was alone, Sally's thoughts turned to Thomas.\n\n\n",

Thomas then admits that he wishes he could help Sally through her legal problems as she was under immense pressure and misguided by her grandmother upon deciding to steal their collection. Zende and Nicole discuss trying for a baby when he suddenly shares his new passion with his wife: designing. Zende shows a couple of dress sketches he has been working on lately and she encourages him to follow up on his dream. Nicole then fills Maya in on Zende's aspirations, but she warns her sister that the timing could not be in Zende's favor. Indeed, Steffy and Thomas's reaction to Zende's designs is not the one he hoped for. They acknowledge his talent, but as Forrester Creations has to come up with a new collection fast, they fear that the design team might not have the sufficient time to train a novice. Furious, Zende walks out. Knowing that there is a great chance that she will be going to jail for a lengthy period of time, Sally sadly announces to her employees that Spectra Fashions is closing its doors. C.J. reminds Sally and Shirley that the legendary building will be demolished - if they do not come up with the sufficient funds to pay the lease soon.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Zende tells Nicole that the Forrester's cannot get the collection out in time without help. He shows her some designs and she thinks they are Thomas's, He is bolstered by the fact they are good enough and they are his originals. He will show the Forrester's and he wants to design for this company. Sally tells Shirley and Saul that as of today Spectra is out of business. Shirley argues that it is not time to cut and run. Saul does not want her to lose her dream. Even CJ chimes in that perhaps there is another way as his mother will not like this. But he needs to sell the building to Bill to pay off all their expenses. They lasted longer than he thought they would. He tells Sally to take her medicine and clear out. Sally tells Saul to send everything back to the warehouse and they will figure out what to do with it. Thomas tells Steffy again that it is no excuse but Sally was under the influence of her grandmother. He would have helped her had she asked. And it does not change how he feels about her now. Nicole tells Maya that Zende wants to make his mark as a Forrester. Maya hopes he is not expecting too much. Zende shows Thomas his designs and says he wants to help. He has been doing this for awhile and he has more. He wants to be on the team. He'll be of more value with that than what he is doing now. He asks Thomas to look at them again and give him a shot. Thomas laments that he does have talent but no experience. Steffy says they are under the gun and do not have time to train a novice. Zende asks them to give him a chance. They had their father and Forrester kids always get the breaks. He was not a Forrester, he was a Dominguez. Thomas says they did not even know he wanted to be a designer. Zende says they know now. He took a risk coming here. CJ leaves and Shirley says they can get down to business now. Sally says they gave it their all and now they are paying the price. They can ride off and do whatever but she is still facing jail time and she lost her boyfriend and everything. She wants some time alone. Steffy says she cannot believe Zende believes that and feels he has to compete. She will wait for him to calm down and talk to him again. She advises Thomas that Sally is not worth the heartache. He needs to really let her go. But he cannot get over their times together. Neither can she.",
