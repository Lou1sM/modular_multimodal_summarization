She pays Ridge an unwelcome visit and demands to know if he was involved in the doctor's death. Ridge manages to convince Katie that he wasn't, yet she is more convinced than ever that the doctor was right about one thing: Ridge is not the father of Caroline's baby! Across the hall, Thomas fusses over Douglas while Caroline critiques his design. Julius attempts to compromise with Sasha, who is adamant that she won't be pushed out of town - or his life - any longer.

    "tvmega_recap": "Julius tells Sasha that is the trouble about being the truth teller. There is always more truth and it was he that took care of her and made her who she is and this is the way she repays him. She ended up with a good job and a big car and now snagged a Forrester even. She is nothing like Nicole as she will understand he was only protecting her mother. Julius tells Sasha that he will go help her pack and even drive the car. He does not trust that she will do as she says. Katie finds some footage on the internet at the scene of the accident and there is Ridge in the background. Caroline takes the baby with Thomas so she can help him with a design. This leaves Katie a chance to find Ridge alone and she wants to talk to him about the accident. She gets around to the procedure. Ridge says she does not have to know about that. That time with her is over. She says he knows he did not have that procedure. But she can help him now if he tells her the truth. She wants to know if he killed the doctor. Nicole takes her phone app and tracks down her father to the Forrester house and suspects he is looking for Sasha so she tells Viv bye and rushes off. Sasha says she would do anything that Julius wanted if she only heard one time that he loves her and appreciates her as his daughter. He cannot even see himself because he is so walled off. She should be ashamed that he is her father but she is not. Ridge asks why does Katie think he killed someone. She shows him the footage where he was on the scene. She says he lied to her. He says that is where the doctor wanted to meet. She says sooner than later others will connect him to that photograph and then start looking through the records and find a connection from the doctor to Ridge. She says she believes him when he says he did not kill anyone but the doctor was blackmailing him. This could be traced. Thomas spends more time with Douglas than he does with Caroline doing the designs. He admits to Caroline that he wants what she and his dad have. Julius tells Sasha that he did the best he could. She knows she spent more time at his house than her own. He takes her by the elbow just as Viv and Nicole come in. He speaks up and says things did not work out and she is going back home. Viv says she can understand; she would be homesick too. Nicole hugs Sasha and then tells Julius that Sasha is going nowhere; her dad can explain. She tells Viv that he will explain right now.",
