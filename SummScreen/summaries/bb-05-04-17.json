Caressing his model, Bill said to never refer to her as an it. He did have a name for her, but he wouldn't share it because it was just between him and her.\n\n\nBill vowed to get the property, but C.J. said that if Sally could produce a hundred thousand dollars, she could stay in the building. Bill asked what the odds of it were. C.J. relayed that Sally had managed to pay \"Shifty\" before she'd been arrested. Bill believed it meant that Sally was broke, and the contract would expire. Wyatt said Bill would finally get the land. Bill wondered if he should invite dignitaries to the groundbreaking ceremony or save all the limelight for himself. \"And her,\" he added, petting the model building.\n\n\nBill saw C.J. out, and Wyatt said things were happening in Bill's favor. Bill bragged that his sour review had gotten the ball rolling. Wyatt asked if Liam knew Bill had written it. Bill replied that Liam didn't. Bill didn't want Liam to know, either, because it would bend Liam's merit badge out of shape.\n\n\nJust then, Liam arrived and asked what he was missing out on. Wyatt claimed that he and Bill had been discussing Bill's impending wedding. Liam asked if Bill was sure about it and cited that Brooke had a history of bouncing back and forth. Bill got defensive, and his sons said that no one was putting Brooke down.\n\n\nBill asserted that Brooke had never stopped loving him; she'd just gotten \"lost in the past.\" It was the way she'd put it to Bill. In his view, the \"poseur\" had blown it, and the poseur and Brooke were done for good.\n\n\nLater, Liam and Wyatt were working, and Liam guessed that Bill's \"outside meeting\" was really Brooke. Wyatt said that it was, of course, and Liam asked why Bill couldn't just say it outright. Wyatt said that Liam knew Bill, who liked to keep things under wraps. Liam reasoned that it was no secret that Bill loved Brooke. \"This is true,\" Wyatt replied and exited.\n\n\nWhen Wyatt returned, he said one had to admire their dad. Liam said Wyatt wasn't required to because Bill wasn't there. Wyatt said he was serious, and he expressed that Bill never gave up. Liam agreed. Wyatt cited Bill's loyalty to Brooke, and Liam said it was nice to see their father happy again. Wyatt felt it was Brooke and Bill's time to be together, and Bill would make sure of it.\n\n\nIn the Forrester CEO's office, Brooke and Steffy discussed having to redo an entire collection due to Spectra. Brooke believed that the Forrester men would pull it off. Steffy conveyed that Zende wanted to try his hand at designing. Brooke asked if Zende was any good. Steffy thought he had talent, but things wouldn't happen overnight. Brooke was sure Zende understood that, but Steffy replied that he'd reacted unexpectedly.\n\n\nKatie entered to ask if Steffy had gotten an email that Quinn had had Katie forward to Steffy. Steffy wondered if Quinn didn't have better uses for Katie's time. Steffy also thought it was weird for Quinn, Katie, and Ivy to be working together. Katie changed the subject by asking where Ridge was. Brooke was sure he was designing in a sequestered location.\n\n\nSteffy said it gave Ridge the great excuse to avoid her questions. Katie asked what Steffy wanted to question him about. Steffy stated that Ridge wasn't giving up on Brooke, and Steffy didn't understand what had stopped the Australia wedding. She asked if Brooke cared to clue her in on it.\n\n\nLater, Brooke and Katie were alone at the conference table. Katie saw that Brooke was still wearing Bill's ring. Katie said it wasn't like she thought Brooke wouldn't be, but things seemed to change quickly around there. \"Yeah, like you coming to work for Forrester Creations,\" Brooke noted. Katie asked Brooke to say it didn't bother Brooke like it did Quinn. Brooke replied that it wouldn't bother Quinn if Katie meant what she'd said.\n\n\nKatie asked what she'd said. Brooke told her sister not to be coy. Katie said that, as long as Ridge and Quinn stayed away from each other, Katie had no reason to tell Eric. Katie added that she wouldn't tell Bill, either, and Bill would just love to hold it over Eric's head. Katie wondered, though, if Brooke was really ready to let Ridge go.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want to do \"this.\" Katie said she was just giving Brooke someone to talk to. Brooke admitted that she and Ridge had a long history and a child together, so there would be feelings there. Brooke added that Ridge wouldn't give up on her. \"And here you are again, caught between two desirable men,\" Katie stated.\n\n\nBrooke asserted that there was no way that she'd overlook what Ridge and Quinn had done. Katie added that it was especially because Brooke couldn't be sure it wouldn't happen again. Katie began to discuss Bill proposing to Brooke that time around, but Bill entered, correcting Katie that Brooke had proposed to him that time.\n\n\nKatie was surprised to hear it. Bill felt that the poseur would be, too, and asked Brooke which one of them would tell Ridge who'd proposed.\n\n\nKatie decided to get back to work, and after she exited, Bill and Brooke kissed. Bill wanted to meet at Il Giardino later to discuss their wedding plans. Brooke said they could do it right then. Bill informed her that he had a meeting, but he would like it if Ridge walked in on them making plans. He asked if Ridge would be his best man.\n\n\nBrooke giggled and said it was the last thing Ridge would do. Bill said he loved her smile and giggle. He would have waited for her forever. He said that they were one step away from fulfilling their own destiny. A flashback played of their romance, from their time in Aspen forward. Bill said he'd always be there for her, and she didn't have to question his commitment. Bill claimed to be hers for forever and a day, and he kissed her.\n\n\nIn the design office, Nicole and Zende discussed how Steffy and Thomas had reacted to his desire to become a Forrester designer. Nicole suggested that Zende talk to Eric or Ridge because Steffy wasn't a designer. Zende stated that Thomas was.\n\n\nNicole noted that Thomas hadn't said Zende didn't have talent. Zende contended that Thomas hadn't offered any insight or a helping hand. Nicole reminded Zende that everyone was focused on getting the collection out.\n\n\nZende said that Forrester was in need of designs more than ever. He'd only asked for one chance. He was looking out for the future of the family he wanted to start, but he was beginning to realize that it would always be someone else. He said he couldn't live that way and needed to know that he wasn't an afterthought to his family.\n\n\nNicole suggested that Zende talk to his mother about it. Zende wanted to do it on his own. He doubted Ridge and Eric would listen to his mother anyway. Nicole asked if Kristen had also felt overlooked. \"Probably,\" Zende replied, but he added that Kristen had never expressed that to Zende. Kristen had been all for Zende getting to know the family. Zende had expected to be accepted as a Forrester even though he was a Dominguez. \"How na\u00efve,\" he decided.\n\n\nNicole still felt it was a good idea to let Eric know how Zende felt. Zende thought that Eric would just say all the right things about being proud of his grandson. Zende said they both knew he wasn't like the Forresters, and he wondered if he'd ever be accepted by them. Nicole said he was a remarkable guy who had overcome things no one could imagine. She believed that his dreams -- their dreams -- would be made true.\n\n\nLater, Nicole and Steffy were in the office together. Steffy was discussing whether to release her wedding photos. Her followers wanted to see them, and she said releasing her wedding dress pictures might serve as a teaser for the upcoming line. She noticed that Nicole was distracted, and Nicole said she'd talked to Zende about the meeting he'd had with Steffy and Thomas.\n\n\nSteffy conveyed that Zende had surprised them, and she'd thought Zende was happy there. Steffy understood Zende's desire. She loved Nicole and Zende, who were family. Steffy thought it was great that he wanted to design, but she asked if Nicole saw that the timing was off. Steffy asked if Nicole could help Zende understand that it was nothing against him, but they just didn't have the time to train him at that moment.\n\n\nAt the bar at Il Giardino, C.J. saw Zende having a drink and introduced himself as Sally Spectra's cousin. Zende made no response. C.J. sat down, ordered whatever Zende was having, and remarked upon the drama in the fashion world. Zende said that Sally had stolen from the Forresters. C.J. replied that he just owned the building and had nothing to do with it.\n\n\nC.J. kind of understood why Sally had done it. It had been her dream, and she'd spent a ton of money upgrading the building. C.J. said he was left with a full fashion house that would have to close because he didn't have a designer to run it. Zende looked at C.J. with interest.\n\n\nZende asked how C.J. felt about closing up shop. C.J. said it wasn't what his mother wanted, but there was a hot shot who'd offered a lot of money for the property. C.J. didn't know of a way to save the place unless someone happened to want a fully functional fashion house. C.J. asked if Zende knew anyone who would and said it only needed a designer and a dream -- plus cash to pay the bills and keep the old girl afloat.\n\n\nC.J. believed there was still something to the Spectra brand. He said Zende didn't have to worry about things like that and was lucky to be a Forrester. \"Not too sure about that,\" Zende replied. C.J.'s phone chimed, and he said he had to go. C.J. left Zende to his thoughts.\n\n\n",

He feels stigmatized as a Dominguez as any born Forrester would definitely get a chance to advance within the company. Later, Steffy tries to make Nicole understand that the timing was off for Zende to receive proper training to become a designer. Katie grills Brooke about whether or not she has any lingering feelings for Ridge even though she plans to marry Bill. Meanwhile, Bill learns from C.J. about Sally likely closing Spectra Fashions after her trial, leaving the property available to be sold. Wyatt and Liam question Bill about his plans to marry Brooke since the last few attempts did not pan out. At Il Giardino, C.J. runs into Zende and they discuss the long-running rivalry of their families.

Zende tells Nicole that he wanted to prove that he could do more than take pictures. He wanted to design for them. They are in need of designers more than ever now and he was looking out for his future. He needs to know that he is not an afterthought to his family and that he can contribute. Nicole says he can talk to Eric but Zende says he does not want to count on him or his mom. She tells him he has overcome a lot already so she knows all his dreams will eventually come true. Bill confides in Wyatt that he is going to have that Spectra property one way or the other. Bill tells CJ that Sally will now be virtually broke so he can reclaim the property. When Katie and Brooke are together with Steffy she says she does not know what happened in Australia, maybe Brooke can fill her in. Bill tells Liam and Wyatt that Brooke's ring is on her finger and it will never come off again. She and Ridge are over for good. Brooke tells Katie they have had enough drama. There is no need for her to tell Eric or Bill anything. There is no need to give him something to hold over Ridge's head. Nicole is distracted and she tells Steffy her mind is on Zende. His meeting with her and Thomas did not go exactly as he planned. Steffy says she thinks it is great if he wants to design, but the timing right now is a little off. They just do not have the time to train him properly. At the outdoor restaurant Zende is having a drink when CJ walks up and introduces himself and sits down. CJ brings up the rivalry and Zende reminds him that his cousin did it again by stealing the designs. CJ says his cousin spent all she had by updating things and now she has nothing. He does not know any way to save it unless..... Zende knows someone who would want to take over an entire fashion place. Otherwise he has to turn the property over to this big shot. Brooke tells Katie that Ridge says he still loves her and will not give up and of course she has feelings for him too but not like with Bill. Bill walks in and says this time Brooke asked him to marry her not that it matters. Bill tells Brooke they have some wedding plans after his upcoming meeting. He wishes he could see the poser right now to see them so happy. He has waited on her forever and he never gave up. They are one step away from being husband and wife. He will always be there for her. She does not have to question that, forever and a day.",
