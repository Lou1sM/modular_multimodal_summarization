Wyatt replied that Hope could date a dozen guys, but she'd always end up with him.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Liam carried in Hope's new cat in a box crate, and Hope beamed that she'd probably visit the shelter every week. Liam joked that she'd go there until every animal was hers. Hope hugged and thanked Liam. She greeted the cat in a baby's voice and cuddled him.\n\n\nPam entered and met the cat. Quinn and Wyatt entered, and Hope introduced them to the newest member of her family that she'd gotten at the shelter with Liam. Hope asked if Quinn wanted to hold the cat, but Quinn claimed to be allergic. Unsurprised to hear that, Pam volunteered to take the cat on a walk. As she left, Pam murmured that they didn't want the cat catching any \"weird diseases.\"\n\n\nWyatt said animal rights was a good cause, and Liam suggested that Quinn adopt a Yorkie to soften her image. Wyatt congratulated Hope on her cat, and Liam suggested that he and Hope train it that night. Wyatt claimed that since Liam had been with Hope all day, Wyatt would get the night shift.\n\n\nLiam replied that it was technically up to Hope. His phone chimed, and he said he had to leave on a work emergency. Hope hugged him, thanked him for the day, and said she loved her kitten. After Liam had gone, Wyatt reminded the agitated Quinn that she had inventory to do.\n\n\nOnce alone with Hope, Wyatt guessed that Liam had blown her away that day. Hope admitted that she was impressed with the difficult cause Liam had taken on. Wyatt thought of a cause he could have, like forming a support group for guys who have to share their girlfriends. He expressed confidence that he knew the endgame. Hope replied that Liam believed that Liam did, too.\n\n\nHope reasoned that the half-brothers were more alike than they realized. Wyatt thought that was a blow to his ego, but Hope replied that it was high praise. He joked that it was a dilemma for Hope, but when she agreed, he stated that it really wasn't. Wyatt believed that Liam was a great guy; however, only one of them could truly make Hope happy, and only one had done so consistently.\n\n\nLater, Hope was alone, cuddling her cat. She grinned as she flashed back on the day with Liam.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill was astounded that Brooke had kept the papers. He said she'd given him back his son and his company, and he knew it couldn't have been easy for her. She agreed that it hadn't been, but Katie hadn't listened. They kissed, and she urged him to go to his office, where he belonged.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie paced around anxiously as Ridge arrived to find out why she'd changed her mind about having him pick up her son. Katie announced that Bill had equal custody and the CEO position. \"This isn't my office anymore,\" she told Ridge.\n\n\nKatie explained to Ridge what had happened with the papers that she'd thought Brooke had destroyed. Ridge was sure the idea to cash in on the papers had been Bill's, but Katie asserted that Brooke was doing it all on her own. Katie noted that things changed quickly around there.\n\n\nRidge replied that he and Katie hadn't changed, and she couldn't let \"them\" destroy what he and Katie had. Katie claimed it wouldn't happen, but she was disconcerted that Brooke had done it after behaving as if she'd been equally disgusted by Bill's methods of getting Katie's signature. Katie was upset that she'd lost full custody and no longer had control over her son's life.\n\n\nBill and Brooke arrived with Will. Bill handed the child to Katie and strode behind the CEO's desk. He said he was sorry to Katie, and he knew it couldn't be easy for her. Katie claimed that she'd talked to her attorneys and to Karen, and Katie planned to give him a battle like he wouldn't believe.\n\n\nBill had seen enough legal battles to know that Katie's would be over before it even began. He declared that he was CEO again -- as it should be. Ridge didn't think it was fair play, but Bill reasoned that Ridge hadn't been around when Katie and Karen had conned Bill out of his own company.\n\n\nBrooke interjected an apology to Katie, who Brooke hadn't really wanted to do it to. Katie started to snip back; however, Bill quelled the bickering by saying that a lot could be argued on both sides, but none of it mattered. Bill said that it had been done, he was CEO, and they needed to work out a schedule for Will. Katie claimed the boy had a schedule, but Bill said that, as of that day, it had changed.\n\n\nKatie asked if Bill would take Will with him to work because Will had play dates with the kids in the nursery. Bill replied that he wouldn't do that -- Katie would. Katie had been an executive in the company before the divorce, and Bill offered to let her continue to be one.\n\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" Ridge grumbled, but Katie stayed put to ask about the fate of her assistants. Bill replied that the company needed stability, and he'd make decisions based upon performance, not spite. Brooke told Katie that Bill wasn't a dictator, but Katie quipped that Brooke knew nothing. \"You haven't worked with him. You've only slept with him,\" Katie added.\n\n\nKatie started sobbing as she tried to explain Will's nightly schedule to Bill. Bill replied that Katie loved Will, and so did Bill. Katie told Will that he'd go to spend time with his father and Aunt Brooke, and Ridge and Katie silently left without the child.\n\n\nLiam arrived and stammered upon seeing Bill in the CEO's chair, holding Will. Bill announced that Katie's reign was over, and \"your daddy is CEO again, thanks to Brooke.\" Liam hugged Bill.\n\n\nLiam exited, and Justin arrived with Alison, who beamed about Bill being back. \"And you're a brunette. I didn't give you permission,\" Bill told Alison. She said that he had room for only one blonde in his life. Bill explained to Justin how the papers had resurfaced, and Justin was glad to have Bill back.\n\n\nBrooke explained that Bill and Karen had equal ownership again, which made Bill CEO. Alison wanted to have champagne because the Wicked Witch of the East had returned to Oz. Bill quietly said he didn't want to hear things like that. Katie was in pain, and he didn't want to take pleasure in it.\n\n\nJustin and Alison left, and Brooke asked Bill how he felt. Bill had never thought he'd be back in the place that he'd raised, nurtured, and protected. He said it had been like a child, and he'd been lost without it and Will. Bill felt that he had his life back, all because of an incredible woman. He thanked her.\n\n\nIn Liam's office, Quinn strode in to say that an animal shelter tour and a kitten weren't surprising from a pussycat like Liam. He tried to get her to leave, but she told the \"tree hugger\" not to dismiss her. Liam feigned surprise that Quinn had something against animals and trees, too.\n\n\nQuinn accused Liam of bribing Hope with a kitten, but Liam responded that Hope had rescued an animal that hadn't had much time left. He called the action responsible and compassionate. Quinn poked him with her purse, saying that he was monopolizing Hope's time, which wasn't part of the deal.\n\n\nLiam asserted that he had no deal with Quinn. He informed Quinn that Hope was a woman of principles, and he'd shared the principles long before Quinn and Wyatt had arrived. Liam said it was the type of thing he had to offer Hope, but Wyatt didn't.\n\n\nAt her house, Katie couldn't believe what had happened. She cared about the Spencer employees, and she felt she'd been making a difference. Ridge told her that she'd continue to do that, and she thanked him for being there for her. He asked what he could do to make it better.\n\n\nKatie wondered if she could actually work at Spencer after having been in charge. Ridge said she didn't have to make the choice right away, and she joked about him getting her a job at Forrester. He asked if she wanted one, but chuckling, she replied, \"Not really.\" Katie didn't know what she wanted.\n\n\nKatie wondered if she should fight it and fight for her vision at Spencer. She asked if she could put her son through it. Katie began to get upset, but Ridge said Will would be fine, and Brooke knew how to handle a toddler. Katie felt like she was once again starting over.\n\n\nRidge said that Katie was, but there was an opportunity for a new beginning. He liked the idea of beginning again with Katie and being free of the baggage. Katie said she'd lived with anger and sadness for so long that she didn't know if she could function without it. Ridge said it would be easy, and she just needed to give him a yes-or-no answer.\n\n\nKatie asked what the question was, and Ridge asked her to marry him. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Bill is ecstatic when Brooke gives him the papers giving him back his company and custody of Will that Katie had previously signed.

Ridge and Katie share a painful moment as Bill, Will and Brooke enter the CEO office and Bill reclaims his chair, clearly the king again. Having promised Wyatt that she will choose soon, Hope is still squarely in between the two Spencer brothers. Hope plays with the kitten that Liam gave her as she remembers fantastic moments that the two of them have shared. A romantic proposal of marriage is made.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill embraces Brooke and is happy to get the papers back giving him the CEO position and equal custody of Will. She tells him what are they waiting for. Go to SP and take back his office. Ridge rushes back to SP where Katie tells him that she is not CEO anymore; this is not her office. Bill will be taking over. She thought Brooke had destroyed those papers but apparently she hadn't. She was using them to make Katie see things her way. This wasn't Bill's idea; she thinks Brooke is doing this all on her own. Ridge says they haven't changed, so don't let Bill and Brooke destroy what they have. As they discuss it, Brooke and Bill walk in with Bill holding Will. Katie takes him. Bill walks around his office and tells Katie that he is sorry. He knows this is not easy for her. She vows that she will fight him on this. Katie tells Brooke to shut up when Brooke says she really didn't want to do this but Katie forced it. Katie tries to block Bill when he says they will work out a new schedule for Will. She says he has his schedule and she doesn't want to break it .the friends he plays with, his sleeping and nap time, meals. Bill says she was an executive before all of this took place and he is offering her to still be an executive here now, so Will can still come to the nursery and have his friends and schedule. But as far as her employees, he will base that on performance, not on spite. Katie glares at Brooke as she and Ridge leave. Quinn finds Wyatt working on the Rooftop. She barges in and says Hope is with Liam and he should be concerned. Wyatt grouses that she can date a dozen guys. He doesn't care because in the end she will end up with him. Back in her office, Hope gives Liam a big hug for all he did for her today. They bring Honey Butt in a box and they set him on the desk. Pam pets HB and then Wyatt and Quinn come in. The cat sneezes at Quinn. Hope tells them this is the newest addition to her family. Pam takes HB for a stroll. Wyatt somewhat thinks it is great that Liam is interested in animal rights. Liam says it is just one of his many passions. Before Liam leaves with emergency work phone call, Wyatt tells him that tonight is his turn for night shift with Hope. Liam walks in just as Bill is holding Will and already sitting back in his chair. Bill tells Liam that Katie's reign is over. His daddy is CEO again. He gives Bill a big group hug. Wyatt tells Hope that she can say it, chalk one up for Yoga Boy. Hope says she was really proud of him today. He's taken on a really great cause. Wyatt quips that maybe he should find one of those .like guys that have to share their girlfriend ..now there's a support group waiting to happen. Two incredible guys now, such a dilemma. But not really. Liam is a good guy, how could he not since he is his brother, but only one of them can make her happy and has consistently. They share a kiss. Quinn shows up at Liam's office. She says rescue shelter, buying Hope a cat, she is not surprised when it comes from a pussy cat like Liam. They end up sparring and he says he has principles and so does Hope and that is what they share, something that Wyatt doesn't. Justin and Allison congratulate Bill. She says this calls for champagne since the wicked Witch of the East has gone back to Oz. Bill warns her not to do that. Katie is in pain and they aren't going to take any pleasure in it. At home, Katie isn't sure what she wants to do. Does she fight this .how can she go back to work there after being CEO and just sit in an office. She says she has operated with anger and sadness for so long that she is not sure she can function without it. Ridge says a new beginning is good; he's looking forward to one with her. He just needs a yes or no answer \u0096 if she will marry him.",
