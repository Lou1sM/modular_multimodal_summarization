He goes back a long way to the time they got a new refrigerator and then it did not fit so it found a new spot in another room .and then the time she bought him bowling shoes instead of golf shoes. But they can look back on their mistakes and laugh. She agrees. Slowly he says because of her \u0096 Sasha is his mistake. Thomas points out to Caroline how much he has changed.

Ridge admits to Katie that he was there at the accident but he did not push the doctor into traffic. Katie says well he knew the truth. She wonders if he knew who the bio father was. Ridge tries to make it seem that even Caroline may not know that as they had a donor. She wonders why he did not tell her that in the beginning and appreciates him telling her.

They need each other. She screams at him \u0096 no! He says this has been harder than any of them ever know but know this to Viv, he did it for her. He walks out.
