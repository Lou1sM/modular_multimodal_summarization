Bill stated that it took Jarrett two minutes, forty-two-point-six seconds to go from his cubicle to Bill's doorstep. Seeing Wyatt's incredulous glare, Bill said he'd timed it before.\n\n\nBill asked if his hurry was obvious. Wyatt said Bill hadn't even been paying attention to the profit discussion earlier. Bill couldn't believe he was saying it, but he stated that he had more important things on his mind. \"Than money? Who are you right now?\" Wyatt exclaimed. Bill relayed that he was in a hurry to meet Brooke and make their wedding plans.\n\n\nLater, Jarrett had arrived and was saying that Bill wanted an article to sound like an obituary. \"I don't want it to sound like an obituary. I want it to be an obituary. 'Spectra Fashions, Rest in Peace,'\" Bill replied. Wyatt thought it was a little soon to call it just yet. Bill said that Wyatt had heard C.J. say that Spectra was folding.\n\n\nJarrett thought it was too bad that Sally had resorted to knockoffs. Bill shrugged, stating that the talent hadn't been there. Jarrett disagreed. Jarrett had seen potential, and he believed that Sally would have made something of herself if they hadn't sabotaged her. Bill said Jarrett's words made Bill question Jarrett's judgment.\n\n\nBill asked what kind of man thought it was okay to steal someone else's work. Jarrett began stammering that he wasn't saying that. \"And yet, here you are, yammering on about poor Sally and if she only had a chance,\" Bill said and mock whined. Jarrett insisted that he didn't condone the actions, and he'd been the one to call Sally out for the bootlegs.\n\n\nWyatt figured that Jarrett was saying that Sally wouldn't have stooped so low if Bill hadn't done so with the first review. Bill asked who gave a \"damn\" and said everyone won in the end. Jarrett cited that Forrester had lost a collection, and Spectra would go under. He asked who would win. Bill corrected that he'd win in the end, and it was all that mattered. \"I get my property. I get my building. And most importantly, I get my Brooke,\" the grinning Bill concluded.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt and Jarrett were alone in Bill's office. Jarrett guessed Bill would get his building. Wyatt said his father always got what his father wanted eventually. Jarrett was irked by the way Bill went about things and said Bill couldn't see that his actions had precipitated Sally's. Wyatt assured Jarrett that Bill did see, and Bill liked what he saw.\n\n\nWyatt didn't think it did any good to call Bill out on his actions. Jarrett figured that he needed to learn to keep his mouth closed. Wyatt replied that job security was a good thing, not that Jarrett had to worry about such a thing. Wyatt said Jarrett was their best reporter, and Bill knew it -- at least Wyatt hoped so. Jarrett revealed that he was seeing his therapist weekly instead of monthly, thanks to Bill. Wyatt believed Bill would be mellower once he married Brooke.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, a server was escorting Ridge to a table. Ridge spotted Brooke at a table and indicated to the server that he'd be just fine in the empty seat across from Brooke. Ridge sat down and told Brooke that she looked beautiful. He said that the only thing that would make it better was \"this.\" Ridge dropped a napkin over her left hand to cover the engagement ring on it.\n\n\nRidge wanted to start ordering, but Brooke decided she'd wait for her date. She said Ridge could order, but he should get it to go. Ridge claimed to enjoy bantering with Bill. Brooke informed Ridge that she and Bill would be discussing their wedding. Ridge asked if she'd chosen a color scheme and said black on black was his favorite.\n\n\nRidge noted that Brooke had been planning a wedding with him five minutes earlier and asked what the rush with Bill was. Brooke replied that she was ready, but Ridge warned that getting married wouldn't make her feelings for him go away. She said she'd always have feelings for him, but they didn't have to mean something.\n\n\nRidge told Brooke that she could get married and push him away for a time, but he was there and part of her. Brooke replied that he'd be there, unsatisfied and looking over her shoulder at every woman. He said it wasn't true; he'd made a mistake, but she didn't need to compound it with a bigger mistake. He insisted that she knew that they'd be together in the end.\n\n\nBrooke said that she appreciated Ridge's belief in them. Ridge said that \"BeLieF\" had been something she'd been working on for a long time. Touching his wrinkle-free clothes that had been treated with her BeLieF formula, he said, \"And look. It's good! Don't give up now.\"\n\n\nBrooke scoffed and started laughing. She wondered how Ridge could make her laugh when she didn't want to. Ridge replied that it was either laugh or cry, but they had to figure it out and work through it. He said he'd never give up on her.\n\n\n\"Beat it,\" Bill ordered as he approached the table. Ridge said that Bill had arrived on cue. Bill stated that he didn't know what Ridge had done yet, but Brooke was where she belonged. Bill asked what Ridge had done to make her finally kick him to the curb. Brooke told Bill to leave it alone, but Bill said he wouldn't until Ridge left her alone.\n\n\nRidge said he and Brooke had a history. Bill retorted that Brooke was looking to the future. \"Aren't you?\" Bill asked Brooke. She quietly looked at each man. Bill asked if Brooke needed to tell Ridge once again that it was over. Brooke asked Ridge to just go.\n\n\nWhen Ridge didn't move, Bill said Brooke had to be even clearer so that Ridge understood there was no chance of a future with her. Brooke told Ridge that he'd betrayed her for the last time, and she needed to move on. She said she was wearing Bill's ring, and they were getting married. Ridge said that if Brooke told him that there was no place in her heart for him and no future for them, then he would back off.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Carter packed his briefcase to leave for a preliminary hearing for Sally. Steffy was surprised that there already was one, and he said things moved quickly when one had Forrester connections. He asked if Thomas or Steffy wanted to go along. Steffy said she wouldn't stop Thomas if he felt the need to go, but Thomas replied that he didn't.\n\n\nLater, as Steffy and Thomas worked, Steffy's phone chimed. Thomas asked if it was Carter, but she said it was Liam. Thomas guessed it was too soon to get news. She figured that her words wouldn't help, but she had to say that Sally had brought it on herself. Steffy stated that actions had consequences. Agreeing, Thomas said that if it had been anyone else, he wouldn't have a problem watching that person rot in prison.\n\n\nSteffy said that the judge would decide, and something had to be done. Thomas agreed that the Spectras should pay, but Sally going to prison didn't feel right to him. Steffy didn't like the idea of Sally wasting away in prison but thought that a month or two of Sally in an orange jumpsuit might be entertaining. Thomas asserted that Sally shouldn't be going at all.\n\n\nThomas conveyed that he had thought that he and Sally could have a future, but she was going away to prison. Steffy replied that it was only if a judge thought Sally deserved it.\n\n\nWhile awaiting a judge in his chambers, Saul, Shirley, and Sally met with a lawyer who didn't wow them with his experience or put them at ease -- even when he said he'd brought his lucky penny, so things would go Sally's way that day.\n\n\nLater, the judge and Carter had arrived. The judge was reading paperwork as the tense Spectra gang looked on. The judge concluded that no one could confiscate the warehouse because they were renting. He noted that Sally had confessed. Sally's lawyer said she was truly remorseful. Carter responded that they needed more than an apology.\n\n\nSally's lawyer knew that actions spoke louder than words, and he said Sally had canceled all orders so that Spectra wouldn't profit off the designs. He hoped the charges could be dropped. Carter balked at the idea. The judge said that Sally had a clean record, so it was likely she'd get five years instead of the maximum. The Spectra crew became visibly upset. The judge said that, due to the nature and seriousness of her crime, he didn't think she should expect anything less.\n\n\nThe judge asked if the Forresters wanted to proceed. Carter asserted that his clients had been robbed and had lost months of hard work and revenue. He affirmed that they wanted to proceed. Shirley asked if her granddaughter would really be in prison for five years. The judge reasoned that it might be three if Sally maintained good behavior. \"I guess that's what I have coming,\" Sally concluded.\n\n\nAs the judge checked his docket, Shirley asked him to have mercy because her granddaughter couldn't go to prison. She asked if someone could speak on Sally's behalf, but he said the confession spoke volumes. The judge added that they could present witnesses at the trial, but they shouldn't waste his time with biased relatives.\n\n\nSaul hopped up and said he wasn't a relative. The judge indicated that Saul was a paid employee of Spectra. Shirley said Saul hadn't gotten much. Saul stated that there had to be someone who could testify for her. \"There is. Me,\" Thomas said as he entered.\n\n\nThe judge's interest was piqued when he learned that Thomas was a Forrester and Carter's client. Carter asked what Thomas was doing, and Thomas replied that he was doing the right thing. The judge asked if Thomas had something to say to affect the upcoming trial. Thomas said that he did, and the judge let him speak.\n\n\nThomas wanted Sally to pay for betraying Forrester personally and professionally. He told the judge that he'd heard her out about her awful lapse of judgment, and he believed that she regretted her actions. He said she'd take it back if she could and had learned her lesson, something that it took people in prison a long time to do.\n\n\nThomas believed that Spectra Fashions should pay and cease to exist, but locking up Sally wouldn't make up for what Forrester had lost. Thomas didn't see the point of putting a woman with so much potential behind bars.\n\n\nThomas thanked the judge for hearing him out. He left, but Sally stopped him in the hallway to thank him. She said he might have just kept her out of jail. Thomas told her that he'd just said what was true. She asserted that she loved him more than she'd ever loved anyone, and she kissed him.\n\n\n",

First thing he does is take a napkin and covers her engagement ring, that hideous monstrosity doesn't want to ruin his meal. She says he better make it just appetizers as she is meeting her date and they are discussing the wedding. Bill tells Jarrett he wants him to write the demise of Spectra, their own obituary. Thomas tells Steffy that he agrees that Spectra should pay for their crimes but he does not think that has to include Sally going to prison. Sally's attorney says he brought his lucky penny along and he will go with that today. Bill cannot believe Jarrett is standing up for the Spectra's when those beautiful gowns were stolen from their original fashion house. Jarrett comments that he does not condone what Sally did at all but if they had not written the original scathing review she would have made it on her own. Her gowns weren't bad. Ridge tells Brooke that he has already told her that he made a mistake but she does not have to make an even bigger one. Thomas tells Steffy that he thought he and Sally might have a future and now it looks like she is going to prison. Carter and Sally's attorney meet with a judge and he says considering this is industrial espionage Sally cannot expect less than five years. Both Saul and Shirley take a big gulp. Bill shows up and tells Ridge to beat it. He is sure there is a hem that needs some work. What he'd really like to know is what Ridge did to make Brooke finally see there was no future with him. Ridge says they have a history. Bill says yes, just that \u0096 a history. What he and Brooke have is a future, so get lost. He can say it one more time but there is zero chance for Ridge and Brooke to have a future. Brooke joins in and says she is wearing Bill's ring and they are going to get married. Ridge tells her to say there is no place in her life for him and then he will back off. The judge says he needs to check his docket but this seems simple enough and he thinks he can get a court date arranged quickly. Shirley gets up and says they can bring in character witnesses if that will help. The judge says he is not sure that will be of much help since they are all family. Thomas walks in the door and says he is not family and has something to say. Thomas laments that Sally had an awful lapse of judgment and she regrets what she did. Spectra Fashions should pay by making it non-existent. Putting Sally in prison will not bring back FC's gowns. He walks out and Sally runs after him and thanks him. He hopes it keeps her out of jail. She says she loves him more than anyone ever and plants a big kiss on him.",
