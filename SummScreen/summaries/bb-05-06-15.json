    "soap_central": "\n\nIn an office at Forrester, Brooke, Eric, and Ridge were silent after Ridge had shared the news that Maya was transgender. Brooke broke the silence. \"You'll say anything,\" she said. Eric questioned why Ridge would want to spread such stories.\n\n\nRidge replied that he had quietly shared with Rick's parents that Maya had been born a boy. Eric wondered if Ridge was certain that it was true. Ridge said that Carter had overheard Maya and Nicole discuss it, and Maya had admitted it to Carter.\n\n\nEric noted that Carter had been engaged to Maya. Eric wondered why the news had suddenly been announced, and he wondered if they were sure Rick didn't know the truth. Ridge assured Eric that Rick was unaware. \"Now, who is gonna tell him?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nBrooke was in shock and paced the room. She wondered how Maya could have kept such a secret from Rick and everyone. Eric reminded Brooke that Maya would have had to have a legal name change and a new ID. Eric believed that to Maya, it was personal and private.\n\n\nBrooke argued that Maya had withheld some very important information from Rick and the company. Eric told Brooke and Ridge that Maya was the most successful lead model they'd had at Forrester since Brooke had been the lead model. Eric added that Maya's decision had not been an easy one. An entire panel of psychiatrists and doctors had to have signed off on Maya's decision to become a female. Ridge agreed, but he pointed out that they had to protect the company and deal with the issue internally.\n\n\nRidge worried about what would happen to Rick when he found out. Ridge suggested that they ease him out of Forrester for a short time. \"Oh, my God,\" Brooke shouted. She accused Ridge of taking advantage of the situation and using it as an opportunity to oust Rick.\n\n\nRidge shook his head and suggested that the news they had about Maya was something Rick had a right to know. Ridge repeated that someone had to tell Rick. Eric insisted that it was obvious Maya should be the one to tell him. Eric and Brooke agreed it would not be up to Ridge to tell Rick \"because he would enjoy it too much,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nRidge, Eric, and Brooke agreed the news would break Rick's heart. Brooke said that Maya was the one person Rick trusted more than anyone. She added that Rick had bought Maya a ring. Brooke agreed she would be the one to tell Rick the news. \"I will do it after I visit Maya Avant,\" Brooke professed.\n\n\nIn Oliver's studio, Nicole was modeling for Oliver, and Oliver told her to slow down her movements. Maya entered, and Oliver repeated that Nicole needed to hold the positions for a few seconds. Maya stepped in and showed Nicole how to model. Maya recommended that Nicole count to five silently then change positions.\n\n\nMaya told Nicole to try it, and Oliver shot some more photos and complimented Nicole's style. Maya coached Nicole through the modeling session. Nicole teased that Maya hadn't coached her before, but Maya reminded Nicole that she and Oliver had tried to coach Nicole about 200 times, but she hadn't listened.\n\n\nOliver chimed in that it hadn't been 200 times. Nicole asked Oliver to take photos of her hands because Wyatt wanted her to be a jewelry model. Maya asked Oliver to get some rings and bracelets. After Oliver left, Maya indicated that she thought Rick was going to ask her to marry him. Maya admitted that she was terrified and had to tell Rick the truth. She shared that she had been afraid to believe that she would ever be as happy as she was.\n\n\n\"Life can be good for you and for me. Why does Rick need to know?\" Nicole asked. Maya insisted that she would tell Rick. Maya emotionally said she would be all right. She smiled.\n\n\nNicole and Maya embraced. Nicole's voice broke when she apologized for her treatment of Maya. She promised to never say anything. Maya thanked Nicole for finding her. She added that she couldn't talk to anyone the way she could talk to Nicole because she was family. \"Please just be happy. Don't worry,\" Nicole said. Maya predicted that things might change, but she would tell Rick, and he would hear it from her and no one else. Nicole left.\n\n\nMaya looked at photos of herself then she looked in the mirror and smiled. Brooke entered, and they briefly chatted about Nicole and how difficult it was to keep her focused. Brooke said that Maya had always seemed single-minded.\n\n\nMaya admitted that she had been a loner, sometimes by choice. Brooke noted that some models were exhibitionists, and others were introverts. Brooke moved closer to Maya. \"You could be staring right at them and not know the person you are looking at,\" Brooke said. She glared at Maya. \"I know,\" Brooke whispered. Maya looked unnerved.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Rick admired the ring he had purchased for Maya. Carter entered and informed Rick that he had updated the model release because it was too elaborate to understand. Carter suggested that Rick look it over.\n\n\nRick shared that he had something important to discuss. He said he knew it was awkward, but they had a lot of things in common -- mainly Maya. Rick wondered what had happened between Carter and Maya.\n\n\nCarter confessed that he believed Maya had never intended to marry him. Rick wondered if Maya was afraid of marriage. Carter didn't know if it was fear. Rick admitted that he planned to propose to Maya. Rick asked if Carter knew what kind of wedding Maya wanted. Carter said he did not know.\n\n\nRick asked if Carter felt Rick was making a mistake in marrying Maya. \"Not if you love her,\" Carter said. Finally Rick asked if Maya's ring size was a 5, and Carter laughed. He said that was what he remembered. Rick said he didn't want any surprises, but Carter suggested that Rick would be surprised. Carter left.\n\n\nLater, Ridge entered Rick's office because Rick had summoned him. Rick wanted to mend fences with Ridge, but Ridge said he didn't think it was possible. Rick said they could work on a better working relationship, and Ridge could start by apologizing to Maya. Ridge refused. Rick wanted to know what Ridge had against Maya. \"You really want to know? Because I would love to tell you,\" Ridge said.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke accuses that Ridge will say anything just to be against Rick. Eric says he can not do this .start spreading rumors about Maya. Ridge says he isn't. Maya was not born with that name. She was a male at birth. And he has it from Carter, a very good authority since he was engaged at one time to Maya. Someone will have to tell Rick. Oliver tells Nicole that she will take better pictures if she stands still, not move around so much. Maya walks in and shows her a few tricks. Nicole tries again and does better. Rick calls Carter in and asks him to close the door. He has something more important than just FC stuff. He knows they are not exactly buddies but they have a lot in common, most importantly Maya. He will get right to the point. He knows they were engaged at one time. Carter says he had his doubts about Maya ever going through with marriage. She seemed to be afraid to set a date. He wonders if Rick is preparing to propose. Rick says if they were friends would he have any advice for him. Does he think it would be a mistake if he asks Maya to marry him. Carter says no, not if he loves her. Rick thanks him for humoring him as he had no one else to ask. He is ready to take the plunge. He has no reservations about Maya but again he does not want to be surprised. Eric wants to be sure all of this is absolutely true. He says she may have changed her name but maybe not for the reason Ridge is thinking. Eric says Maya is feminine enough for legality reasons so maybe Rick will be okay with this. Brooke asks if this is the opportunity Ridge has been waiting for. He says they are not going after Maya with a pitchfork but certainly Rick may not be able to handle this and they need to be prepared for any fallout. Maya confides in Nicole that there is nothing she thinks that can not happen to her future plans. Nicole says Rick does not need to know so all her plans can come true. Maya says she will be all right; both of them will be all right. Brooke says the problem is that Maya has not told Rick although she needs to be the one to do so. Brooke muses that Rick plans to propose at Big Bear and it will hurt him no matter who tells him. His world could completely fall apart. Nicole tells Maya that she knows she is the one who came along and hurt her by all of this coming out. Maya says no, she thought she would never have family again and Nicole is gorgeous and fun and her life is so much richer and she can talk to her like no one else. They are blood and belong together and she loves her. They hug and Nicole tells her to please just be happy. Maya says Rick will propose and she may lose him but she will not lose her self respect. No one else must tell him, just her. Ridge tells Rick that he heard he wanted to see him. Rick says close the door. Here's the thing, he is about to become the happiest man on the planet so he thinks they need to work things out and get along. He'd like Ridge to apologize to Maya. Ridge says he doesn't feel like being that domestic. Rick wants to know what he holds against Maya. Ridge says he would dearly love to tell him. Brooke walks in to see Maya and starts slowly about her growing up and then suddenly becoming a model ..people who like to be seen, hold themselves apart. And sometimes you can look right at them and not know what you are looking at. Brooke walks up much closer and stares at her and says, \"I KNOW!\"",
