Katie noted how things had worked out for her because one of her worst days had turned into one of her best. Katie recalled that Ridge had proposed to her right after Brooke had used the legal papers against Katie.\n\n\nBrooke suggested that Ridge had proposed to Katie in order to get back at Brooke for giving Spencer back to Bill. Katie smiled at Brooke's arrogance. Katie laughed at Brooke thinking everything Ridge had done was about her. Brooke warned that Ridge would hurt Katie, but Katie informed Brooke that Ridge was the man of her dreams. Katie couldn't believe that Brooke thought that everything Ridge did had to do with Brooke. \n\n\nKatie explained that the red ribbon around her finger was all she needed to be assured of Ridge's commitment to her. Katie added that Bill had given her countless diamonds and even a tiara, but they meant nothing. \"How many rings do you have, Brooke?\" Katie asked. Katie noted that Brooke should be happy because she was with Bill. Brooke said that she was happy. Brooke looked teary-eyed and left.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge had called a meeting. He told everyone that Brooke had managed to get Bill back in charge at Spencer. Ridge also announced that he planned to marry Katie. Everyone was shocked. Ridge explained that it was perfect timing and a happy coincidence.\n\n\nRick wondered what Ridge was up to. Rick said that he was glad Ridge was out of his mother's life, but he worried about Katie. Ridge and Rick started to argue, but Eric told them to stop. Rick and Eric left.\n\n\nBrooke entered the office, and Ridge asked how Brooke could hurt her sister again. Brooke said that it had been the right thing to do. Ridge wondered if Brooke had given Bill his company back in order to punish Ridge for his relationship with Katie. Brooke countered that Ridge had punished Brooke by proposing to Katie.\n\n\nRidge wondered what Brooke saw in Bill other than a physical relationship. \"How do you take him seriously?\" Ridge asked. Brooke said Bill had been good enough for Katie, but Ridge reminded her that Bill had not been good enough for Katie or Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke worried that Ridge would get bored with Katie, and it would be another failed marriage that hurt Will and R.J. Ridge disagreed, and he told her that he had changed, and he loved Katie. Brooke admitted that Ridge had gotten her attention with the proposal. \"Don't marry Katie for all of our sakes,\" Brooke said. \n\n\n\"I will marry Katie,\" Ridge answered. He added that he was committed to Katie. He softened and told Brooke that a part of him would always love Brooke. \"You have captivated me most of my adult life, but we're not the same people anymore. You know that,\" he said. Ridge hugged Brooke, and she cried.\n\n\nIn Bill's office at Spencer Publications, Quinn repeated her demand that Bill give Wyatt the Spencer name and Bill's support of Wyatt's relationship with Hope. In exchange, Quinn promised to keep her sex romp with Bill a secret. Quinn said Bill needed to do it immediately. Bill was unhappy, but Quinn advised him to be prepared to do what she asked. She showed Bill a photo of them on her phone -- they were in bed, evidence of their affair.\n\n\nQuinn reminded Bill that Wyatt needed his support and that Bill had coddled Liam for too long. Quinn recalled that Liam had squandered every chance he had ever had with Hope. It was Wyatt's turn.\n\n\nOutside at Forrester, Wyatt gave Hope a bejeweled collar for her kitten. Quinn called and interrupted to tell Wyatt to meet her at Spencer because Bill was back in charge at Spencer. Hope thanked Wyatt for the gift, and they kissed. Wyatt left.\n\n\nCaroline entered Katie's house and excitedly demanded to see Katie's engagement ring, but Caroline wondered what the red ribbon on her finger signified. Caroline noted that Katie looked happy. Katie guessed that Brooke had already headed over to Forrester to convince Ridge not to marry Katie.\n\n\nWyatt arrived at Spencer Publications and congratulated Bill. Quinn exclaimed that Bill had called Wyatt for a reason. Bill told Wyatt that he had been blessed to discover that Wyatt was his son. Quinn blurted out that Bill wanted to give Wyatt the Spencer name. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Having Bill right where she wants him, Quinn urges Wyatt to arrive at Spencer Publications as fast as he can. At a Forrester meeting, Ridge arrives and tells the group about Bill being reinstated as CEO \u2026 all because of Brooke. He goes on to reveal that he and Katie are engaged. Over at Katie\u2019s house, Brooke implies that the only reason that Ridge proposed to Katie is because of Brooke. Katie is firm that Ridge\u2019s commitment to her is solid. Still skeptical, Brooke leaves and heads over to Forrester where she runs into Ridge.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke is speechless when Katie tells her that Ridge asked her to marry him and they are now engaged. It's funny how it started off as one of her worst days when Brooke gave Bill the papers giving him CEO job and custody of Will. Ridge proposed then and it became one of her best days. Brooke is speechless. Katie says she is sorry, maybe she stole Brooke's thunder. She came over here so confident after taking the company away from her and handing it back to Bill and she wanted to make sure fragile Katie was okay. Well she is more than okay, a proposal from Ridge Forester will do that. She shows off her red ribboned finger and says it is more priceless than all the diamonds Bill could buy her with his broken promises. And she won't tolerate Brooke throwing herself at Ridge at work; he is engaged now. Brooke says why would she; she is happy with Bill. Katie says she has learned from experience and she knows Bill is her second choice. Brooke tells her that surely it has crossed her mind that Ridge proposed because maybe he was getting back at Brooke for giving the company back to Bill. Katie says history is just that, the past. She is Ridge's future. So Brooke doesn't have to worry about her. Little sis is just fine with the man of her dreams. Rick is trying to have a meeting but there is no Hope or Brooke and even Ridge's mind is elsewhere. He tells them that Brooke ought to be feeling pretty good about now. Katie is out and Bill is back in as CEO. Then he has more shocking news. He asked Katie to marry him and she said yes. He tells his dad by making him and Brooke co-VP's and thinking something might develop, well that is not going to happen. Wyatt surprises Hope with a specially designed cat collar. He tells her all cats need bling and hers will be the envy of Beverly Hills. She gives him a kiss and says this is so sweet. He thinks it is the perfect gift from a perfect boyfriend. She wonders what is holding Quinn up from this meeting. Quinn tells Bill that she does not know why he is hesitating. She only wants him to do right by Wyatt. He's already acknowledged him but not legally and he can rectify that today and supporting his relationship with Hope and then Brooke never has to hear about their sexcapades. Bill says that is blackmail if he has ever heard it. She counters that it is only a nudge in the right direction. He feels like a gun is stuck to his head. She says she does not like guns figuratively or otherwise, but she has other effective ways to get what she wants. She calls Wyatt and says Bill has his job back and he wants to see Wyatt so don't keep him waiting. Bill snaps at her that he didn't agree to anything yet. She says he will. She holds up her phone which shows a pix of her in bed with Bill. She gloats that she has extra copies if he wants one for his wallet. He grouses they are not even sure Wyatt wants to be a Spencer. She says of course he does happily and legally the way his much less deserving half brother does. Bill wants to leave Liam out of this. She says he has coddled him far too long and it's time he understands that Wyatt deserves everything the Spencer name brings with it including his father's support with the woman he loves. She points out that Liam has had chance after chance and squandered every one. Now they are not going to let him ruin Wyatt's chances with Hope. She tells Bill nicely to please do this as Wyatt will be here any minute. Brooke never has to know that Quinn was hiding in the closet with a whip when Brooke was pouring her heart out to Bill. Rick tells the group that is the shortest meeting they have ever had thanks to Ridge's two bombshells. Eric says and the right time to ask Katie was today just after she lost her position as CEO. Ridge says it put a smile on her face. Rick quips that he's not so good keeping the smile on their faces though. Rick says his mom is the perfect example. And even though Bill is not perfect, his commitment to her is and she is the only woman in his life. Bill tells Quinn to put that phone away. She laughs that it's a good thing she did not make a video ..but really she means him no harm. So just do this for Wyatt; it would mean everything to him. Brooke drops by Ridge's office and says she just stopped by Katie's to try to get her to understand why she had to get the company back into Bill's hands. He asks if it has nothing to do with Katie then she must be punishing Ridge for having a relationship with Katie. And Brooke says he went to a lot of trouble to punish her by proposing to Katie. He assures her their relationship is a lot deeper than Brooke thinks. She says hers with Bill as well, it is not just physical. Ridge tells her to come on, the guy is tacky. Looks at how he dresses and puffs his chest out. She can not take him seriously. And he's not good enough for Brooke so he suggests she dump him before he hurts her like he did Katie. She says she and Katie are two different people and she is afraid Ridge will be bored with her. He says no, maybe it is him, he's changed. Brooke says she is afraid this will end badly. She thinks he will hurt Katie, RJ and Will so if he is trying to get her attention he has succeeded. But please do not marry Katie for all their sake. Ridge says he is committed to Katie and he will marry her. He calls Brooke .Logan .. and says part of him will always love her. She has captivated him most of his adult life but they are not the same people and she knows that. As she starts crying, he pulls her to him and gives her a hug. Wyatt comes into Bill's office and asks is the newly re-instated CEO here. Bill chimes that yes and he is already kicking butt and taking names. Bill walks toward him and says congratulations are in order. Wyatt isn't sure they should hug or shake hands so they do both. Quinn says that is not the reason he called him here. He has something very important to tell him that will make a huge difference to him and to Hope. Bill tells Wyatt that his mother tends to run on and on but she's right. There is something he'd like to say that he hasn't before. A year ago he did not know Wyatt existed and he was shocked. And they had some things to work through and may still have .having said that, he feels blessed to have another son. Quinn jumps in and says more deserving than his other less deserving half brother. And the reason Bill wants him to carry his name and make him a Spencer.",
