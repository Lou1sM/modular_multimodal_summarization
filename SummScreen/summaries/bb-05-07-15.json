    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's old office, Brooke told Ridge that she hadn't had the heart to broach the transgender topic with Maya the other night. Brooke and Ridge still hadn't wrapped their heads around the news about Maya. Brooke believed it was a pretty big omission on Maya's part and didn't understand how Maya could lead on Rick, who talked nonstop of her integrity.\n\n\nRidge thought the integrity talk was more about Rick's impulsiveness and need to impress people than about Maya. Ridge believed it was a disaster in the making, partly due to Maya and partly due to the way Rick would explode once he knew. Ridge wondered what would happen to the company and said they wouldn't be in that position if he'd been in charge.\n\n\nBrooke put the blame on Maya and vowed to definitely talk to Maya about it that day. Ridge didn't want it to seem as if he was defending Rick's \"little attack dog,\" and he asked if there was any way that Rick would be okay with any of it.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want to judge, but she also didn't fully understand what Maya had gone through. Brooke imagined that it had to be uncomfortable not fitting with one's born body, and she guessed it was hard to fight to become the person inside. Brooke believed Rick would have a huge problem with the fact that Maya had kept it from him. Brooke revealed to Ridge that Rick had a ring and could propose at any time.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Liam pressed Wyatt to work his magic on Nicole to find out Maya's secret. Liam shoved Wyatt's phone into Wyatt's hand, but Wyatt was hesitant to call Nicole. Wyatt felt that he had to be careful and make sure he did everything the right way. Liam suggested dinner, flowers, and candles. \"She hasn't even spent the night yet. You're worse than dad -- you know that?\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Maya cooed to Nicole that Rick would probably propose soon. Nicole advised her sister not to ruin it by telling Rick something he didn't need to know. Rick popped his head in the door and asked who needed to know what. He hoped they weren't talking about him.\n\n\nNicole covered by pretending to be discussing their father. Rick warned that parents had a way of finding things out and relayed that his mother always seemed to know his secrets even before he did.\n\n\nNicole received a call from Wyatt, who was working at home -- which meant surfing on the beach. He invited her to join him, but she said she didn't go anywhere near sharks. She offered to wear a bikini and watch, and he invited her to play volleyball. She agreed to go, but after the call, Rick said he knew he hadn't heard that Wyatt was surfing and not working.\n\n\nNicole claimed that Rick hadn't heard that and asked to borrow a bikini from Forrester. Rick and Maya chuckled knowingly, and he granted the request. Rick noted that he hadn't known that Nicole and Wyatt had gotten close. \"Getting there,\" Nicole responded, smiling.\n\n\nRick said Nicole couldn't throw any parties while he and Maya were away. Changing his mind, Rick told her to throw a big party but to make sure there was no trace of it once he and Maya got home. Rick invited Nicole to use Big Bear, too -- just not that night because he and Maya would be there.\n\n\nRick left to take care of business, and Nicole exclaimed that he was \"totally proposing\" that night. Maya grinned and said it might be so. Nicole urged Maya not to ruin it, insisting that if Maya wanted a ring and to call Rick husband someday, she'd better not say a word. Maya insisted that she would do it.\n\n\nAs the sisters debated, Maya received a message that Brooke wanted to see her. Maya wondered if Brooke knew that Rick would propose and was awed by the idea that Brooke would be her mother-in-law. \"If you keep quiet,\" Nicole quipped.\n\n\nNicole wanted Maya to delay it because Nicole had just gotten there and met Wyatt. Nicole asked what would happen to what she has with Wyatt if Rick and Maya blew up. Maya said that if Wyatt was the man Nicole thought he was, it wouldn't matter where Nicole lived or what had been on Maya's birth certificate.\n\n\nWhen Rick returned to the CEO's office, he was annoyed to find Ridge in there. \"You know what I like about you? Absolutely nothing,\" Ridge quipped. Rick didn't have time for Ridge because Rick was headed to Big Bear with Maya. Ridge said he'd thought Maya was a pool and margaritas chick.\n\n\nOffended that Ridge would call the lead model and CEO's girlfriend a chick, Rick said Ridge needed to call Maya \"Mrs. Forrester,\" because that was who she'd be one day. Rick claimed that she was honest, caring, beautiful woman who deserved Ridge's respect. \"Start giving it,\" Rick demanded.\n\n\nAt the beach house later, Nicole arrived and wondered how Wyatt could get used to life on the beach. She wore a short lacey cover-up, but quickly snapped it open and asked for his opinion of her bikini. Wyatt's gaze softened in delight. She asked if he could keep a secret and said she'd borrowed it from Forrester. Wyatt said the secret was safe with him.\n\n\nLater, Maya arrived in Rick's old office. Brooke hoped she hadn't pulled Maya away from anything. \"Rick's mother calls, I come running,\" Maya said, smiling. Brooke remembered being that way about Stephanie, so that Stephanie would know that Brooke was the right woman for Ridge. Maya felt that Brooke comparing Maya to Brooke was the best compliment of the week.\n\n\nBrooke said she hadn't understood Stephanie's fierce protection over Ridge, but becoming a mother had made her even more protective than Stephanie because Brooke had made more mistakes. Brooke needed to look at her children's partners to ensure that her children were happy and appreciated. She said Rick had been fooled before, and Amber and Caroline had lied through their teeth.\n\n\nMaya assured Brooke that things were different for Rick and Maya, and he'd finally found a woman he could trust. \"Well, that's reassuring,\" Brooke replied, pausing before adding, \"Myron.\"\n\n\nMaya murmured that she hadn't known what Brooke had heard. Brooke asserted that she'd heard that Rick was being deceived, and the honest woman of integrity in his life wasn't a woman after all. Maya declared that she was a woman, and Brooke couldn't make her feel ashamed. Brooke yelled that she wasn't out to make anyone feel ashamed, but \"this whole persona\" is a lie.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Maya really thought Rick would have gone so far if he'd known. Maya asserted that she did. She believed that Rick loved and supported her, and it had nothing to do with how she'd been born. Brooke yelled that he'd built his life around someone he didn't even know. Claiming that Rick knew her, Maya said she'd tell him the things he didn't know about her. Brooke asked if that would be while walking down the aisle, when he was too far in to get out.\n\n\nMaya claimed that wasn't what she was doing, but Brooke declared that she knew what Maya was doing. In Brooke's view, Maya had been patient and had planned it all out. Brooke knew the perfect little speech Maya would give about how it didn't matter because she was the same woman he'd fallen in love with. Brooke stated that it did matter because Maya had been dishonest just like the others.\n\n\nMaya asked how Brooke had found out and was shocked to learn that Ridge knew the secret. Brooke added that Rick would know, too, but Maya said that Rick could only hear it from her. She claimed it had been her intention all along, but Brooke said Maya should have told Rick when they'd first dated, when she'd first kissed him, when she'd moved into the house, when he'd made her lead model.\n\n\nMaya said it might be true, but it was her decision only. She claimed it wasn't as easy as Brooke made it out to be. Maya claimed that she wasn't pretending, and she'd never really been Myron. Maya asked who needed to know how she'd been born besides her doctor. Starting to cry, Maya decided that Brooke wouldn't have said the things to her the other day, but upon finding out, Brooke had decided that Maya was lower than life. Maya claimed it was why she'd had to think long and hard before deciding to allow that kind of treatment into her life.\n\n\n\"To hear you rationalizing like this, I'm sure you've thought long and hard about it,\" Brooke retorted. Maya said she wouldn't marry Rick without telling him, and if he proposed to her, she wouldn't accept unless he accepted all of her. Brooke told Maya that he was planning to. Maya said she'd suspected it, and if he did, she'd tell him. \"If?\" Brooke repeated.\n\n\nBrooke told Maya that she'd do it before Rick proposed. Brooke refused to let Maya humiliate Rick will he was down on one knee with a ring in his hand. Brooke decided that Maya would tell Rick that very day that she was transgender, or Brooke would do it.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Ridge that she did go see Maya last night but she just couldn't do it could not bring herself to ask Maya if she was transgender. She wanted a chance for Maya to explain why she is going to let Rick propose, move her into his house and let it go on this long. Brooke says she has a new resolve today and Maya will listen to her. Nicole tells Maya again there is no good reason for Rick to ever know the secret so do not tell him. He walks in just as she says that and wonders what she is talking about. They blow it off that they were talking family business. Liam tells Wyatt that he doesn't want to pressure him or anything but he needs to get a move on to get this secret out of Nicole. Wyatt admits he has done all he knows how to do. Liam hands him the phone and insists that he call. Wyatt says he is taking a big risk here and he wants it all to be right. He calls and invites Nicole to come over to the house where he is working and they can go surfing or play beach volleyball. She asks Rick and Maya if she can borrow a bikini from downstairs. Brooke tells Ridge that Rick loves Maya and she should have told him a long time ago. She can symphathize her being transgender, being born in one body and feel like she should be another. But she can not forgive her for not telling Rick since he holds such a value on honesty. Rick is happy for Nicole and says she can throw a party and invite anybody she wants while he is gone. He just wants to slip away and have a good trip. Nicole tells Maya she is certain Rick is going to propose at Big Bear and she wants nothing to ruin that. She urges Maya not to tell Rick if she ever wants him to be her husband. Maya gushes that Brooke Logan will be her mother-in-law. Nicole says yes but only if Maya keeps quiet and doesn't ruin things. Nicole also doesn't want her relationship with Wyatt to be jeopardized. Maya says it won't. It should not matter to him what is on Maya's birth certificate. After more urging from Liam, Wyatt tells him to get out of there. He knows what is at stake and he will do all he can to get this secret out of Nicole by the end of the day. Maya shows up via Brooke's text and she says Brooke can feel good that Rick has all that love and support. She thinks they are a good match ..based on love with honesty and trust. Brooke says that is reassuring but looks right into her eyes and calls her Myron. Nicole shows up at Wyatt's and he is impressed with her swimsuit and her secret is safe with him that she borrowed it. Rick finds Ridge in his office and scoffs at the idea if they had an appointment. He is too busy otherwise as he is ready to go to Big Bear. Ridge says great, he can take care of the office. Rick says as tempting as that is he thinks he can run it remotely. He tells Ridge that he can start with calling Maya Mrs. Forrester as that is who she will be someday soon. She is a beautiful, honest, caring woman who deserves Ridge's respect so start giving it. Maya says she does not know what Brooke has heard. Brooke responds that Rick has been deceived. The woman who was so honest with him is not a woman after all. Maya counters with yes she has been. She is a woman and there is nothing Brooke can say to make her ashamed. Brooke answers that she is not trying to make Maya ashamed, but she cares about her son and this whole persona is a lie. He made her his lead model and moved her into his house. Does Maya think it would have gone this far if he knew the truth. Maya says yes she does. He loves her. Brooke says yes but a person he is building his future around a person that he does not even know. Brooke says she is sure Maya has a sweet little speech and is biding her time and planning everything perfectly and waiting until there is no way out for Rick. She has been dishonest with him just like all the others. Maya is shocked to find Ridge knows. Brooke says that Rick will know soon too and all the others. Maya declares no, she will tell him. That was always her intention. Brooke points her finger at Maya and says she should have told him when she first kissed him and started dating, when he invited her into his house to stay there and when he made her the lead model. She could have told him all those times and didn't. Maya stammers it is her decision when to tell him and no one else's and it isn't as easy as Brooke makes it sound. She says she is not pretending. She is not Myron and really never was. The only person that needs to know all of this is her doctor. She knows that Brooke would not have said these things to her yesterday but now Brooke thinks she is lower than life. Brooke responds that she is sure Maya has thought long and hard about this but Rick needs to know the truth now. Maya says and she will, that has always been the plan. She will not marry Rick without telling him so Brooke can forget that right now. If Rick proposes she will not accept until he accepts her. Brooke says the word IF. No Maya is not going to wait that long. She is going to tell him before he proposes. She shouts at Maya that she will not humiliate Rick like that, down on one knee with ring in his hand. She will not treat him like that. She shakes her finger at her again and says Maya will tell him the truth today that she is transgender. If she doesn't, then Brooke will.",
