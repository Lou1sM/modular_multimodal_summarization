    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Liam and Wyatt discussed their father's upcoming wedding. Liam was surprised it hadn't taken place yet, and Wyatt relayed that Bill wanted to buy a piece of property first.\n\n\nC.J. arrived to say that he was still trying to make Bill's deal happen. Wyatt introduced C.J. to Liam and tried to ask Liam to let him talk to C.J. alone; however, the curious Liam gleaned that the deal was about the real estate for the Spencer Tower. C.J. explained that Bill had wanted the Spectra building, but C.J. had given Sally a shot first. \"But clearly it's not happening, especially since she got busted for stealing from the Forresters,\" C.J. concluded.\n\n\nWyatt asked if he could call C.J. about it later. After C.J. had gone, Liam concluded that it was a conflict of interest for Bill. \"Okay, here we go,\" Wyatt murmured. Liam elaborated that the reason Bill wanted Spectra to fail was so that Bill could get the land. Wyatt said it wasn't the only reason and reminded Liam of Bill's shares in Forrester. Liam asked when Bill had started caring about the shares. Wyatt replied that earnings were earnings.\n\n\nLiam linked the scathing review to Bill's desire for the property, but Wyatt said open space was hard to locate downtown. Liam asked if he was supposed to believe it was a coincidence. To Liam, it appeared to be an ethics issue, and at best, it was questionable. Wyatt replied that it was why Bill didn't tell Liam anything, and Wyatt told Liam to stop reading into things.\n\n\nLiam claimed it was Wyatt who was telling Liam that there was something to read into. Wyatt advised Liam to forget about it and said Wyatt and Bill could handle it.\n\n\nLater, Jarrett arrived and asked if \"Master Spencer\" had wanted to see him. Liam said he'd been talking to Wyatt and C.J., and Liam was starting to understand why Bill wanted Spectra to fail. Liam said Bill wanted to buy Spectra's building, which was a conflict of interest. Liam stated that Wyatt wouldn't talk about it. Jarrett said he felt terrible about it.\n\n\nLiam asked if the showing Jarrett had reviewed had really been that bad. A flashback of the review played as Jarrett explained that he'd been the only reporter there, and Sally had worked hard. He called the designs unruly and raw but unique. He felt that, in time, she could be a good designer. Liam asked why Jarrett hadn't written it. Jarrett replied that he had.\n\n\nOn his phone, Jarrett pulled up his real review. As Liam read it, he said it wasn't the one that Spencer had published. Jarrett stated that Bill had refused to publish it. Liam quickly figured out that Bill had written the review that had been published. Jarrett said he'd been sworn to secrecy. Liam asserted that it changed everything. Liam said it had sent Sally on a downward spiral, and though it didn't change what Spectra had done, it explained a lot.\n\n\nJarrett stated that it had ruined Sally. Liam added that it had all been because his father wanted a stupid building.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Ridge asked Brooke to say there would never be a place for him in her heart ever again. Brooke said that Bill was right. She was committed to Bill and would have a life with him. Ridge asked for a moment with Brooke, but Bill refused to give even a second. \"I win; you lose. It's as simple as that,\" Bill said.\n\n\nRidge asked if Brooke really wanted to sign up for that type of thing. Bill concluded that whatever Ridge had done, it had to be pretty bad because it had cost Ridge the best woman of Ridge's life. Ridge told Brooke that he'd never give up on her, and he exited.\n\n\nBill told Brooke that he almost felt sorry for Ridge. Bill got that Brooke empathized with Ridge, but Bill felt that she'd been a glutton for punishment for too long. He asked her to put the relationship in proper perspective. Bill stated that Ridge couldn't hurt her anymore, and from then on, it was all about her and Bill.\n\n\nAt Bill and Brooke's table later, she wondered if Ridge and Bill could ever get along -- if only for R.J.'s sake. Bill could only promise to be a good role model for R.J. Bill said he could teach R.J. to be a gentleman and how to be truly committed to a woman. Bill wanted to make a plan for the wedding, but he said there was one thing he had to take care of first. Brooke asked what it was, and he responded that it was just a matter of a property he had to get ahold of.\n\n\nDuring the meal, Bill received a call from Wyatt. He said that he'd just talked to C.J., and Sally would default on another payment, which meant the building would be Spencer's. Wyatt warned Bill that Liam had been asking a lot of questions. Wyatt hadn't known how to answer them, but he agreed with Bill that it was best to keep it all quiet, especially the part about Jarrett's review.\n\n\nAfter the call, Bill felt the irresistible urge to neigh and stomp his feet. Brooke tried to calm him down. He said it was the stallion in him, and everything was going his way. He had Brooke, and he was about to close on the building deal. She said she'd never seen him so excited. Bill exclaimed that as soon as he closed the deal, they'd get hitched.\n\n\nBrooke asked Bill to tell her about the deal. Bill asked if she could keep a secret. He revealed that he was buying the Spectra building. Brooke said that the old thing was falling down. Bill called it a piece of junk -- and the perfect spot for his tower. He went on about the mirrored building, and Brooke said he did love his mirrors.\n\n\nBill said it was for their future. He added that it was too bad that Sally had robbed Forrester and hadn't fulfilled her dream. Brooke thought it was sad and the end of an era. Bill added that it was the beginning of them, and they'd get married right after he acquired the Spectra building.\n\n\nIn the judge's chambers, the Spectra crew awaited Carter, who was on the phone in the corridor. Saul felt that Thomas should have spoken up for Sally before the charges had been filed, but Sally said she'd always be grateful to Thomas. Carter entered and informed the judge that he'd been conferring with Eric, and after Eric had heard about Thomas' support of Sally, Eric had decided to forgo legal charges and pursue only damages.\n\n\nCarter said that Spectra Fashions had to be done, which meant that all the assets would be seized, and damages would be paid. Carter asserted that Spectra Fashions could not interfere with Forrester Creations again. Sally's lawyer, Mr. Polinski, wanted to talk it over with Sally, but she immediately took the deal without consultation.\n\n\nThe judge called it a wise decision. He said he didn't expect to see her again, and she was free to go. Sally thanked Carter, but Carter said the thanks should go to Thomas.\n\n\nAt Spectra later, Darlita hugged Sally to congratulate her. Sally thanked Polinski, and Shirley asked if he'd let his work be pro bono. Polinski said he'd be in touch, and he exited.\n\n\nShirley wanted Darita to go out for a box of celebratory wine, but Sally said they couldn't afford it and had nothing. Saul reasoned that she had her freedom. Sally replied that it was all she had, and Spectra was finished. Saul said they all had each other, and it was all that mattered.\n\n\nDarlita asserted that they couldn't give up. Shirley explained to Darlita that they had no assets, and everything down to Darlita's cheese puffs would be taken. Saul wanted to find a smaller office space, but Sally said it wouldn't make a difference because she didn't have what it took to be a designer. She announced that she was leaving town, and Spectra was just a memory.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Thomas arrived in the CEO's office. Steffy guessed he'd been to Sally's hearing. Thomas admitted that he'd made a statement on Sally's behalf. Upset, Steffy said they couldn't let Sally get away with knocking off their line. Thomas agreed, saying Sally should pay damages but shouldn't go to jail. Steffy guessed that Thomas was still in love with Sally.\n\n\nCarter arrived and updated Thomas and Steffy on the decision that Eric had made about Spectra. Steffy wasn't happy about suing for damages. She said it amounted to nothing because the Spectras had nothing. Carter pointed out that without assets or capital, it was effectively the end of Spectra.\n\n\nCarter left, and Steffy hoped Sally was grateful. Thomas asked Steffy to admit that she was a little happy that Sally hadn't ended up in prison. Steffy said she took comfort in it, but it was time for Thomas to move on. He replied that he couldn't help but wonder if things would have been different if Sally hadn't caved to copying the designs. Thomas felt that Sally's grandmother and aunt were complicit. Steffy stated that he wasn't dating them, and Sally owed him more respect.\n\n\nThomas didn't believe Sally had set out to steal from them. Instead, Sally had wanted to fulfill a dream and do it the right way. However, something had steered Sally off track.\n\n\nLater, Thomas was alone when he received a call from Sally, who thanked him for standing up for her. She said that Spectra was done. There was nothing left for her, so she was leaving California. She didn't think she had a right to ask, but she wanted to see him once more before she left. He said that he wanted to see her, too. Sally stated that she wouldn't be able to thank him enough for saving her.\n\n\n",

Jarrett says he always felt badly about that. Definitely Liam wants to know more. Sally calls Thomas and says she wants to thank him for coming to her rescue. He said it was his pleasure.
