Wyatt entered, and Bill told him that he was using visualization to make his dreams come true. Bill promised that by the end of the day, Spectra would be a pile of rubble.\n\n\nWyatt questioned Bill's motives. They discussed that Sally would get no prison time because Thomas had stepped up to defend her. Wyatt wondered what Bill had against her. Bill claimed he liked her and that she was \"perfectly pleasant,\" but he wanted her to get out of his building.\n\n\nBill had discovered that she didn't have money to pay the rent. Bill explained that he would meet C.J. at Spectra later in the day in order to complete the deal. He looked forward to starting his building, and he caressed the model of his skyscraper.\n\n\nWyatt asked about the review Bill had written under Jarrett's name. Wyatt argued that it was cruel to tear Sally down under Jarrett's byline. Bill admitted he had taken over because it was how he had built his business.\n\n\nWyatt noted that Bill had destroyed Sally. Jarrett had seen promise in Sally, and Bill was \"building a skyscraper on the wreckage of someone's dreams.\" Bill was unsympathetic. He wanted to build his skyscraper.\n\n\nAt Spectra, all the employees were packing to leave. Shirley encouraged everyone to be careful as they moved items because they would relocate. Sally was discouraged. She looked around the room at posters of the original Sally Spectra. Shirley lamented that one day, they had been soaring, and the next, they were packing up and getting out.\n\n\nSally lamented that she had made the wrong choice. She couldn't pay the rent, and C.J. would soon pick up the keys. Saul noted that they had worked as a team to make some bad decisions. They all agreed that closing up was better than seeing Sally \"rotting away in some prison.\" Sally nodded and said she would be in prison if it hadn't been for Thomas.\n\n\nSally and Saul discussed that she would be leaving town. Saul wished she wouldn't leave. Saul hated the thought of her being all alone in the world somewhere. \"Just say the word, and I'm in the car,\" he said of leaving with her.\n\n\nSally thanked Saul but said she had to do it on her own and figure out what to do next. She promised she wouldn't disappear. They would all stay in touch.\n\n\nDarlita was emotional about losing daily contact with Saul, Sally, and Shirley. Saul said that Sally had promised they would all stay in touch. Sally told the gang that she had hoped to say goodbye to Thomas in person. She wondered if he would show up at the office before she left.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Thomas were in the CEO's office, and she told him that he and the entire Forrester team had done amazing work. \"Especially you,\" she said. Thomas asked why, and Steffy said that she knew he had been under a lot of pressure. She realized that Sally would have been in prison without Thomas.\n\n\nThomas insisted that it had been the right thing to do. Steffy acknowledged that in spite of everything, Thomas was still in love with Sally. Thomas noted that Sally had at one time had a real shot at being a fashion designer, but Jarrett's review had destroyed her. Steffy said it was just one review, but Thomas recalled that he had seen the hit Sally had taken as a result. He felt that if she'd had a chance, she would never have needed to steal Forrester designs, but she had been desperate. He explained that Sally had asked him to meet her before she left town, and Thomas planned to see her. Thomas left, and Liam entered.\n\n\nLiam had overheard that Sally was closing Spectra. Steffy pointed out that Sally had no choice but to leave and start over. Liam explained that Sally had been wrong, but he wondered if Steffy would be any more forgiving if she knew that Sally had been sabotaged.\n\n\nSteffy wondered what Liam meant. Liam explained that it was all the result of a real estate transaction because his dad wanted the Spectra property to develop his own building. Liam felt that Bill had pushed Sally to stealing because of the bad review that Jarrett had given her.\n\n\nSteffy said that Jarrett's review had had nothing to do with Bill, but Liam revealed that he had learned that Jarrett hadn't written the review; Bill had. Liam said that Jarrett had admitted to him that he had liked Sally's designs. His dad had insisted that he'd wanted to sink Sally because he wanted the building. Steffy gasped and said the review couldn't have been Bill's. She asked if Liam had seen the original review.\n\n\nLiam said he had learned that Jarrett had seen \"talent and hustle and potential\" in Sally's designs. He didn't want to excuse what Sally had done. But he added that his dad's manipulations had cost Sally her business, and it had cost Thomas a relationship with Sally. \"I wish you hadn't told me this,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nLiam asked Steffy if she didn't think Thomas should know. Steffy argued that Bill might have arranged the circumstances, but Sally had gotten off and had walked away from all the harm she had caused.\n\n\nLiam argued that Thomas had a right to know. Steffy disagreed. She said that Sally had targeted her and her business. Steffy wanted Sally gone and out of Thomas' life. Liam asked if Steffy could keep the truth from Thomas forever.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Thomas entered the office, and Shirley thanked him for all he had done. Shirley, Saul, and Darlita agreed. Sally and Thomas went into her office.\n\n\nSally said she was packing up and moving out. She didn't know how to thank Thomas. She had wanted to see him so she could look him in the eye and apologize. She promised to always be grateful.\n\n\nThomas asked where Sally would move. Sally said she would return home and \"work at the bakery with Grams probably.\" Thomas wanted her to stay in design. She said she had to step away from it for a while, but she'd had one last design in her. She handed it to him.\n\n\nThomas said the design was elegant, refined, and gorgeous. \"What was your inspiration?\" he asked. \"You,\" Sally answered. She explained that he had made her feel like a Forrester.\n\n\nThomas asked Sally to change her plans and stay. He wanted to give it time for forgiveness. Sally said it would be worth staying, but she couldn't forgive herself.\n\n\nSally lamented that she had squandered the biggest, brightest, and best moment of her life. She noted they had great memories from Australia. She flashed back to their time in Australia and their first meeting in the bar. She recalled that he had kissed her out of nowhere, but Thomas teased that he had been planning that for a while.\n\n\nSally told Thomas that Australia had been magical. She told him she would never forget him. She'd had a dream come true, and the best part had been with him. They kissed goodbye. \"Thomas, I'll never forget you,\" she said.\n\n\n",

    "imdb": "Bill informs Wyatt that by the end of the day that wannabe fashion diva Sally Spectra will be out of business and he will be the proud owner of the desired downtown L.A. real estate. As the Spectra employees pack up the office in preparation of the company closing, Saul tries to change Sally's mind to leave town by appealing to her out of personal and business concern. Sally thanks him, Darlita and Shirley for their unconditional support. Liam confesses to Steffy how Bill's sabotage and scheming triggered Sally to steal designs from Forrester Creations. Steffy wonders whether she can keep this important piece of information from her brother who is still madly in love with the funky red head. Having requested a visit from Thomas, Sally presents him with something to remember her by: an original design. Thomas is clearly impressed and is surprised that she ever doubted her own talent. Sally apologizes one more time before giving Thomas a goodbye kiss.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill shows Wyatt how creative he can be. He stages a mockup demolition with a bulldozer and the Lego Spectra building. Wyatt says it is weird that Thomas spoke up in Sally's behalf. Bill is not happy that she is gone, just that he gets the building. Wyatt tells him it was still cold for him to help make Sally go down. Bill says that is their secret and he needs to keep it that way. He will be planning the wedding and getting away soon. Saul explains to Sally that it is not all her fault. They were a team and this is better than her rotting away in prison, just give up the business. Shirley tells them to be careful with all that stuff. L.A. has not seen the last of Spectra Fashions. Thomas tells Steffy it is Sally's last day and he has to see her one more time. Sally tells Saul that she wants to see Thomas one last time but she is not sure he will come. Thomas tells Liam that he is going to say goodbye to Sally. Liam tells Steffy that he knows it was not right what Sally did but she was sabotaged? He fills in the blanks where his dad was concerned that he wrote the scathing review because he wanted the building, and it set Sally up to fail. Of course he knew nothing about the knockoffs or had any hand in that. Thomas does show up to see Sally. Both Shirley and Saul tell him they appreciate all that he did to keep Sally out of prison. Bill says this is the way it goes in business. If someone gets in his way it has to go. Wyatt tells him he is building this skyscraper on someone else's dreams. He crushed Sally Spectra. Bill said that is the way it is done ..knock them down and crush the life out of them. Steffy wants to know how Liam knows all of this. Liam says Wyatt was acting weird and practically rushing him out of the building so he went to the source and found Jarrett who spilled that it was Bill who wrote the Spectra review that blew them out of the water. Thomas tells Sally that he did not want to see her end up in prison. She is grateful. He asks where she is off to now. She says she will go back home to do some work but not in the fashion business. But she did do one last design and hands the sketch of a gown to Thomas who thinks it is elegant. He cannot understand why she ever doubted she could be a designer. Liam says he is not taking Sally's side but it was his own dad's manipulation that she ended up doing what she did. He asks if she can keep this from Thomas and live with herself. He would want to know. Sally tells Thomas that she asked herself that question about her talent many times. He asks her to stay in town and let them work this out. She says even if he could forgive her and all the other Forresters, too, she does not think she could forgive herself. They had fun and it was like fate when they met and it all continued in Australia, and she will never forget him. For a minute she was living her dream. She kisses him one last goodbye and says she will never forget him.",
