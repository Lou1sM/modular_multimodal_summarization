Bill explained: \"You can see through it, yet you can't.\" She smiled.\n\n\nWyatt and C.J. entered, and Emmy worried that people had gotten past her desk because she hadn't been there. \"Do you have an appointment,\" she shouted at Wyatt and C.J. \"They're okay,\" Bill said. Emmy left.\n\n\nBill discussed with C.J. that he wanted to close the deal on the Spectra building. C.J. told Bill that it wasn't that easy. He wondered what kind of orders Sally had and if Shifty had given her another loan. Bill said he understood it was delicate because it was family. Bill offered to accompany C.J. \"I'm gonna show you how it's done,\" Bill said. Before Bill left the office, he advised Wyatt not to use his phone and pretend he was Bill. \"But lunch gets here so much faster,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nAfter Bill and C.J. left, Wyatt called as \"Mr. Spencer\" to order lunch. Liam entered and asked for a veggie burger. After Wyatt had hung up, Liam quizzed him about their dad and C.J.'s destination. Wyatt replied that they were headed to Spectra. It was about to sink.\n\n\nEmmy returned and insisted that Liam take her picture with the building model. Emmy told him to send it to his dad. She laughed and left.\n\n\nLiam wanted to discuss the building with Wyatt, who said it was already a done deal. Liam chastised him for allowing Bill to ruin Sally's dream, but Wyatt maintained that thedamage had been done before he'd found out.\n\n\nLiam said he had told Steffy what had happened. \"Dad is not gonna be happy with you,\" Wyatt said. He added that he would have done the same thing that Bill had done and the same thing that Sally Spectra had done. \"A dress is a dress, and they're all for the same thing -- to be taken off,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nLiam called Wyatt cynical. Wyatt countered that he was practical. They argued about business philosophy, and Wyatt concluded that Spectra would be a pile of rubble by the end of the week.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Coco, Sally, Shirley, Saul, and Darlita remarked that they had all had fun. \"While it lasted,\" Sally added. Sally flashed back to the beginning of Spectra and her first visits with Thomas and his attendance at the fashion show. She said it was better to have loved and lost.\n\n\nThe Spectra crew discussed what they would all be doing next. Sally said she would be working at the bakery with her grandmother. C.J. entered and asked if she had the $100,000. Sally said that he knew she didn't. She had planned to be out by the end of the day. Bill followed C.J. in. Saul, Darlita, Coco, and Shirley waited outside the office.\n\n\nBill, C.J., and Sally discussed what they had to do to complete the transaction. Bill noted that neither of them had any business sense. He pulled out a check and some documents. He told Sally she had talent. \"Keep your chin up,\" he said. He wanted to rush the deal so that C.J. would hand over the building.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy was working, and Thomas entered. Steffy asked how his meeting with Sally had gone. He was elusive. He showed Steffy the design that Sally had given him and explained that it was Sally's goodbye gift.\n\n\nSteffy admitted, based on the design, that Sally clearly had talent. She wondered why Sally hadn't relied on her talent rather than stealing from Forrester. Thomas explained that it had all been because of Jarrett's review. \"How is a first-time designer supposed to come back from that?\" Thomas asked. Steffy looked away.\n\n\nThomas lamented that Sally was something special. He said it hadn't been love at first sight, but she made him feel good about himself. \"Like the man that I wanted to be. How am I supposed to find that again?\" he asked. Thomas wondered if he should follow her back to her hometown.\n\n\nSteffy tried to dissuade Thomas, but she told him that Jarrett had agreed that Sally had promise. Steffy admitted that Bill Spencer had written the review under Jarrett's byline. Steffy explained that Liam had told her about it the previous day. She said that Bill wanted the building.\n\n\n\"All of this is about a real estate deal?\" Thomas asked. Steffy noted it was all because of a shady plan that Bill had put in motion, and Sally and Forrester had gotten caught up in it.\n\n\nThomas wondered what would have happened if Jarrett's review had seen the light of day. He raced out of the room.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Thomas raced past Coco, Shirley, Saul, and Darlita. He interrupted the meeting of C.J., Sally, and Bill. \"Whatever that is, don't sign it,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nBill made fun of young love -- insinuating that Thomas was trying to save the company.\n\n\nThomas explained what Bill had done to Jarrett's review. C.J. asked if it was true, and Bill admitted it was. Thomas advised C.J. to believe in blood. \"Sally, you have so much potential, opportunity. Stay here, and I will never let you forget that again,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nSally smiled.\n\n\n",

    "imdb": "Bill presents Emmy his skyscraper model when C.J. and Wyatt arrive. C.J. confirms to Bill that Sally is due with her rent today and grimly notes that it is unlikely that she will make the payment. Although relieved to learn that Sally is leaving town, Steffy is empathetic of Thomas' broken heart and therefore tells her brother that the \"Eye on Fashion\"-review of her first collection was devised by Bill. At Spencer Publications, Liam breaks it to Wyatt that he informed Steffy of Bill's unfair tactics to drive Sally out of business. Wyatt is sure that Bill will not be happy about Liam's actions. Coco watches sadly as Sally says her goodbyes to Saul and Darlita - ready to close the doors on Spectra Fashion for good. C.J. shows up with Bill in tow to take ownership of the building. Just as Bill holds the check for the sale of the building under C.J.'s nose, Thomas storms into Sally's office and urges her to not give up on her dream just yet.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells CJ and Wyatt that Sally has to come up with the $100 Grand today or the building is his. He tells them Emmy is the only one around who will tell him the truth. He hands CJ a check and tells him to count the zeroes. Today the building will be his. He and CJ leave with only Wyatt in the office when Liam comes in. Liam tells him he knows the secret now of what his dad did. He meets Emmy and takes a selfie of her and the skyscraper mockup. Wyatt tells Liam for the record all the damage had been done before he found out about Sally. Sally takes one last look around with all the memories. She tells them she will go back and re-open the bakery. Saul is not sure her bakery can use a sugar made tailor. Thomas shows Steffy the design Sally made. Steffy agrees that she has something. Steffy keeps hearing Liam's words in her ears of why Sally failed ..it was his dad's doings. So it was not Jarrett's review after all. She confides in him what Bill made Jarrett do, writing his review for him. Coco got caught up in it accidentally and now so are they. Wyatt tells Liam that everybody is not him. Hell he probably would have done the same thing Bill did. Wyatt says he is practical not cynical and he does not have to discuss this with him anymore. The building will be Bills by the end of the day. Bill and CJ go to Spectra and he shows Sally the check and says unless she can match that and not $5 at a time then he takes over at the end of the business day. Sally says he knows she can't so he can hand it to CJ now. Thomas walks in and advises CJ not to sign that just yet. Sally is going nowhere. Steffy tells Liam that she doesn't particularly like Sally but it is not fair what Bill did. Liam says Bill is over there now taking over. Bill tells Thomas that this is not a damsel in distress. This is grown up time with a knock off artist. He must be a slow learner like his father. Thomas tells Sally the truth. Jarrett works for Spencer Publications and he wrote what Bill told him. Bill says he is not going to sit here and listen to a chip off the old blockhead. Thomas tells Sally to listen to him. Do not go; she can count on him.",
