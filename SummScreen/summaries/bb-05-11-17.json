    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley urged everyone to keep packing before Bill threw them out on the street. Coco said Thomas wouldn't let it happen. Darlita wondered if Thomas would carry Sally out of there, like a scene from a movie. Shirley said the only things getting carried out were the boxes.\n\n\nIn the office, Sally asked if Thomas was saying he wanted her to stay. The impatient Bill asked for a tissue for the sappiness. Bill said they'd waited long enough, and he ordered C.J. to sign the papers. Bill asserted that Spectra had failed, and it was time to put it out of its misery. Thomas raged that it hadn't failed; Bill had sabotaged them.\n\n\nBill mock whined and said Thomas was a typical Forrester who tried to ride in on a white horse, but it was really a donkey. Bill didn't understand the problem with him ridding C.J. of a pile of rubble and putting an end to a company that had stolen from Forrester. Thomas reasoned that Spectra wouldn't have stolen if it hadn't been for Bill's fake review.\n\n\nSally stated that Bill was right -- it was too late, she didn't have the money, and she had no future there. Thomas disagreed and asked if Sally had until the end of the day. Bill said there was no need to wait for the clock to run out. Bill grabbed C.J. and ordered him to sign the papers. Thomas asked what Sally owed. Bill quipped that it was more than she had.\n\n\nThomas demanded the number, and C.J. said it was one hundred thousand dollars. Sally said it was pointless, and Spectra was finished. Thomas whipped out his checkbook, and she asked what he was doing. \"Making an investment,\" he replied.\n\n\nThomas handed Sally a check, and she said it was for one hundred thousand dollars. Thomas replied that it was what she needed. Bill asked what it would be for the next month and the next. Bill ordered C.J. not to back out of the deal. Thomas said the check kept the Spectras in the building. \"Doing what? They don't have a collection,\" Bill noted.\n\n\nBill said that even if they did get the clown shop up and running again, no one would buy their rags. Bill felt that he was giving Garrison a chance to get out from under the pile of rags. Thomas said it was more than a building to C.J. and Sally; it was their history and legacy. Thomas conveyed that Sally had returned to rebuild it. Thomas believed that, with her talent, she could have given the brand a new face.\n\n\nBill asserted that Sally had stolen from Thomas. Thomas blamed Bill, saying she'd done it because of him. Bill asked if Thomas would bail out the one who'd screwed over Thomas and his family. Thomas claimed that Spectra had been on track until Bill had derailed them.\n\n\nC.J. took Thomas' check and handed Bill the unsigned paperwork. C.J. stated that he was sorry for Bill, but Spectra wasn't going anywhere. Bill wordlessly left.\n\n\nThe employees entered, asking what had happened. C.J. showed them the check, and Sally announced that Spectra wasn't going anywhere because Thomas had paid the rent. Everyone began hugging, and Sally rested her head on Thomas' shoulder.\n\n\nAs the Spectra team all celebrated, Sally explained what Thomas had done for them. Darlita kissed him on the check. Thomas said he couldn't let Bill take them down after what Bill had done. Shirley asked what Thomas meant, and Sally explained that Bill had written a fake review. Thomas added that Jarrett had written a decent review, but Bill had refused to publish it because he wanted the building.\n\n\nSaul thanked Thomas. Shirley said she took back every rotten thing she'd said about Thomas. She exclaimed that it was a miracle. The workers formed a conga line and danced out of the room. Sally said she couldn't thank Thomas enough, and they hugged.\n\n\nSally had believed she'd ruined everything before Thomas had saved it all. Thomas said it hadn't been just him. He revealed that Steffy had told him about the article. Sally was impressed and grateful. They discussed the hit to her confidence the review had dealt. Thomas said Bill hadn't even seen her work, but Jarrett believed in her as a designer. Thomas did, too.\n\n\nSally said she had a chance to create something that was beautiful, honest, and genuine, and it was all because Thomas believed in her. She believed that his gesture had been the most foolish or the most romantic thing she'd ever seen, and the two kissed.\n\n\nIn the lobby, Darlita led Coco, Shirley, and Saul's conga line. Everyone but Coco drank. They discussed how they should have known the review had been fake because Sally's designs hadn't been that bad. Coco couldn't believe Thomas had done what he'd done for them.\n\n\nCoco said Thomas could have let Sally believe all the horrible things from the review. Instead, Thomas had stood up for her, just like R.J. had stood up for Coco. Shirley toasted to Thomas and all he'd done for their girl. Coco wondered if Thomas and Sally would reunite.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam and Steffy were discussing Steffy wishing Liam hadn't found out about the review. Zende and Nicole arrived with one of Zende's sketches. Steffy said they could leave it with her because Ridge was in a meeting, and Thomas had gone to save Spectra.\n\n\nLiam explained that Thomas wanted to help the Spectras because there might have been extenuating circumstances surrounding the theft. Zende didn't know what more there could be to the Spectras stealing their designs. Nicole figured Thomas still had feelings for Sally.\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Liam had apparently filled Nicole and Zende in about the fake review. Zende said \"so what\" to it, because not one good review could \"save Spectra now.\" Steffy replied that Bill's role didn't get the Spectras off the hook, but it would change Thomas' feelings. She said Thomas would think Spectra had been sabotaged. Steffy looked annoyed as Liam said Bill had sabotaged them because he'd written the article to take them down.\n\n\nSteffy was really concerned because she'd thought Sally was out of Thomas' life. It made Steffy worry about the business and her brother. Zende added that they'd given the Spectras the benefit of the doubt, and the Spectras had burned them. Liam said that no one was excusing what the Spectras had done, but one couldn't ignore what Bill had done, either.\n\n\nLiam wondered how it would have gone if his magazine had given Sally a fair review. He said Sally had been striving to be a legit designer. Steffy argued that a legit designer wouldn't have used Steffy for publicity. \"Or send Coco undercover to steal our collection,\" Zende added.\n\n\nSteffy said they'd had to sue so that Spectra wouldn't get away with it, but Liam was right that Bill had had a part in it. Zende said it didn't change the ending. Steffy agreed. She said Spectra would be gone, and Bill would have his precious skyscraper.\n\n\nAfter Nicole and Zende left, Liam said Steffy couldn't control what Thomas did with the truth. Steffy knew what Sally would do with it. Steffy said Sally would vindicate herself and make Bill the bad guy, which was exactly what Thomas wanted to hear.\n\n\nLiam replied that it was Thomas' choice. Steffy wished the relationship was done and asked why her brother had to be such a superhero. Liam noted that Thomas wasn't the only do-gooder in the family. Liam was proud of Steffy for telling Thomas when being silent might have been the way to go. Liam said that what his father had done had been vindictive and selfish, and Steffy had believed that Sally and Thomas had a right to know it.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Jarrett arrived in the CEO's office at Wyatt's behest, and Wyatt found it interesting that Jarrett referred to Wyatt as sir. Wyatt asked if Jarrett was that formal with Liam. Jarrett said he and Liam spoke cordially -- and frankly. Wyatt wanted to do the same, and he asked why Jarrett had told Liam that Bill had written the review. \"Because he did,\" Jarrett responded.\n\n\nWyatt told Jarrett that Bill hadn't wanted anyone to know. Jarrett replied that Liam was a Spencer who'd asked a direct question, and Jarrett could no longer lie. Because Liam was no fan Sally's, Jarrett hadn't seen the harm in telling Liam. Wyatt stated that Liam had told Steffy. Jarrett felt the same way about Steffy's view of Spectra. \"Who then told Thomas!\" Wyatt added.\n\n\n\"Oh...\" Jarrett responded. Wyatt began to worry about how Bill would react when he found out that Jarrett had told Liam. Jarrett claimed to be relieved. As a journalist of integrity, Jarrett had never been comfortable with what Bill had done. Jarrett knew that he could lose his job over it, but he felt that the truth had needed to come out.\n\n\nLater, Bill was in his office, ranting to Wyatt about Thomas being softer than Thomas' father -- and all for a rip-off artist. Bill said he'd known he couldn't trust Jarrett to keep his mouth shut. Wyatt revealed that Jarrett had talked to Liam about the fake review. \"The Eagle Scout,\" Bill complained.\n\n\nWyatt asked if C.J. had pulled out of the deal over the review. Bill stated that the deal had been done until Thomas had whipped out his checkbook. \"A hundred large...He called it an investment,\" Bill explained. Wyatt said Bill had been about to offer C.J. two hundred times the amount. Bill responded that C.J. should have taken it because Bill would never be so generous again.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Bill was giving up. \"Never!\" Bill asserted. Bill said Thomas had only delayed the inevitable, and Bill would take great satisfaction when Spectra was a pile of rubble.\n\n\n",

    "imdb": "Thomas explains to Sally that Bill was behind the poor review she received on her first collection. He also implores C.J. to rescind his sale agreement with Bill because family ties should be more important than a quick fortune. Thomas then signs a check to assist Sally in getting her company back on its feet. After a furious Bill leaves, Sally tells a jubilant Shirley, Saul, Darlita and Coco that they have reason to celebrate: Spectra Fashions is back in business. In a private moment, Sally thanks Thomas for coming to her rescue and giving her a chance to prove herself as a designer. They kiss. Steffy and Liam fill Zende - who drops of another sketch to be judged by Ridge - and Nicole in on Bill's shady actions. Just as Wyatt confronts Jarrett for confessing to Liam, Bill returns to Spencer Publications. He declares that Thomas just delayed the inevitable; eventually the Spectra building will be his.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells them at Spectra that CJ gave Sally her chance and she failed. Thomas speaks up and says Sally did not fail. It was Bill who sabotaged it. Wyatt calls Jarrett in and says he'd like to speak frankly. He wonders why Jarrett told Liam that Bill wrote the Spectra review. Jarrett said well because he did. He could not lie anymore. Liam asked him a direct question so he answered it. He says he is a journalist and one of integrity and he was never comfortable doing what Bill made him do. So he is relieved even if it means losing his job. Shirley is beside herself while taping up all the boxes to get them out of here. This place used to be loud with laughter and energy, now it is time to turn out the lights. Thomas tells CJ that Sally has until the end of the day to stay open. He grabs his checkbook and says he is making an investment. Steffy tells Zende and Nicole that she is concerned about her brother and the business. With this new information about Bill it could change everything. Bill chides Thomas for throwing his money away on these rags. CJ takes the check and tells Bill, sorry but Spectra is still in business. Sally and Thomas return to Spectra. She tells them Spectra is alive and well thanks to Thomas. Liam tells Zende that he is not excusing what Sally did but they can not overlook what Bill did either. Steffy says Spectra will be out of business by end of day and Bill will have his precious building. Wyatt scoffs so Thomas saved the day by paying 100 large. Bill says Thomas did not save the day. He only prolonged the inevitable. The office celebrates with champagne although Shirley cannot imagine why Thomas did that. Thomas tells them that Jarrett did not write that review; it was Bill but he will have to find another skyscraper. Shirley does her happy dance and tells Thomas that she will take back every filthy thing she has ever said about him and the Forrester's. Sally hugs Thomas and tells him that she cannot thank him enough. Liam laments to Steffy that she told Thomas the truth but she cannot feel guilty over what he may do with that information. But he is not the only do- gooder in the family. He knows she feels badly too. His dad was being vindictive. Coco cannot believe what Thomas did; he did not have to .just the way RJ stood up for her. Sally tells Thomas that she really thought it was over. She cannot believe Steffy told Thomas that it was Jarrett who believed in Sally but allowed Bill to write the review which blew her out of the water. She tells Thomas that either what he did today was the most foolish thing anyone has ever done or the most sweet, romantic thing they kiss.",
