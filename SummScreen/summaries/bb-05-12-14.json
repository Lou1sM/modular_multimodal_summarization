    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Oliver tried to convince Thorne that it wasn't the time to tell Aly about Thorne's involvement with Taylor. Thorne refused to keep the secret from Taylor, and Oliver asked if the relationship was really \"that\" serious. Thorne gave Oliver a look, and Oliver apologized for overstepping. Oliver said that if it wasn't that serious, then Thorne shouldn't tell Aly.\n\n\nThorne insisted that he and Taylor would tell Aly once Taylor had returned. Oliver noticed that Taylor had been gone for a while, and Oliver asked if Taylor could have run into Aly. The men exchanged knowing glances and rushed out of the office.\n\n\nIn the photo studio, Aly gripped the axe. She asked if Taylor was terrified and said it had been the same way Darla had felt when Taylor had run Darla down. Putting the axe down, Aly ordered Taylor to get out of there. Aly declared that Thorne wasn't dating Taylor and wanted nothing to do with her.\n\n\nTaylor tried to plead with Aly to listen. Taylor said that she and Thorne had wanted to talk to Aly together, but when Aly had asked a question, Taylor hadn't been able to lie. Taylor felt that Aly's anger was understandable. Aly declared that Taylor had killed Aly's mother and destroyed the life that Aly had been meant to have.\n\n\nTaylor said that Aly was better able to understand things as a grownup, and it was the perfect time to let go of the resentment. Aly declared that she didn't resent Taylor; she hated Taylor.\n\n\nJust then, Thorne and Oliver arrived. Aly ran into Thorne's arms and told him that Taylor had been saying terrible things. Aly implored him to say that Taylor was wrong. Oliver tried to let Aly and Thorne talk alone, but Thorne insisted upon hearing what had happened.\n\n\nAly began to tell Thorne about the sick things that Taylor had been saying. Thorne stated that the relationship had been something that he and Taylor hadn't expected. Aly refused to believe it. She wrenched herself away from her father and began huffing. Aly refused to hear any more, but Oliver stated that her father was trying to explain things.\n\n\nThorne reviewed all the good things that had happened for Aly and said she should be happy with her life. Aly stated that it would make her happier if she could share it with her mother. He thought her mother would be proud of her, but Aly asked if Darla would be proud of him.\n\n\nTaylor asked if Aly thought Darla would want Thorne to be happy. Thorne stated that he was happier than he'd been in a long time, and Aly guessed that meant happier than he'd been at home with her. Oliver stated that it wasn't what Thorne was saying. Aly sobbed that Thorne had known she couldn't accept it, but he'd done it anyway.\n\n\nThorne pleaded with Aly to understand that he loved her and would never hurt her. Aly said that if that were true, he'd stay there with her and forget about Taylor. Aly sobbed that she couldn't do it again, and Thorne couldn't see Taylor anymore. The tearful Thorne said, \"Okay.\" Taylor was disheartened when he hugged Aly and said, \"Anything for you, baby. Always.\"\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Donna smiled through her shock about Katie and Ridge's engagement. Katie claimed that she was happy, and she hoped that everyone else could be happy for her. Katie picked up Will, and she hugged Donna. They thought they heard the front door, and Katie said she'd told Bill to \"come on up.\" Donna asked if Bill knew, but Katie murmured that he didn't.\n\n\nDonna took Will downstairs, and Katie said she had something to tell Bill. She held up her ribboned finger and announced that Ridge had proposed to her. Finding the ribbon \"cute,\" Bill assumed that Ridge couldn't afford to pop for an engagement ring. She claimed that Bill wouldn't understand, but the ribbon meant more to her. She said that the wedding would happen soon.\n\n\nBill noted that Katie had sounded strange on the phone. He called it civil, and chuckling, Katie hoped that Bill could be civil, too, because Ridge would be Will's stepfather. She said that Ridge would be a part of Will's life, and Bill guessed that meant Ridge would be a part of Bill's life, too.\n\n\nKatie remarked that it had been a crazy day, but it was looking a lot better than it had when Brooke had shoved the papers in Katie's face. Bill had heard enough about the papers and noted that Katie had conned him out of his job and taken his son from him. Katie dismissed it, saying that they need to keep having a nice conversation.\n\n\nBill insisted that Brooke had righted a wrong. He felt that Brooke had tried to reason with Katie before using the papers. Katie stated that Brooke tried to make everyone think that Katie had had a choice, but it had actually all been up to Brooke. Bill refused to apologize for getting back what was rightfully his, and Katie replied that she wouldn't apologize, either.\n\n\nBill wondered how long Katie's satisfaction would last with a man like Ridge. \"And there it is,\" Katie quipped, rolling her eyes. Katie said she'd learned to enjoy the present, not dwell on the future. Bill thought that sounded like Forrester. Katie grinned, citing that Ridge had had a positive effect on her. \"Yeah, all that poetry,\" Bill replied, sighing.\n\n\nBill guessed that the proposal had been flowery. \"And well-timed,\" he added. Katie asked what he had to say about her engagement, but Bill didn't think speaking would do any good. Ridge wasn't the man that Bill would choose to raise his son with, and Bill wasn't sure Ridge would live up to his promise; however, Bill drew the line at Will calling Ridge \"Dad.\" Katie claimed that it was fine and added that she didn't want Will calling Brooke \"mommy,\" either.\n\n\nKatie guessed that being CEO made things easier for Bill to swallow. Bill replied that the papers had given him equal custody of their son, which meant he could build a real relationship with the child. Bill was willing to put up with Ridge in order for that to happen. Bill said that they would all be family after the wedding, so it was important to try to act like a family.\n\n\nIn Brooke's bedroom, Ridge arrived after leaving R.J.'s room. Brooke said that it was good that she and Ridge had told the boy together. Agreeing, Ridge replied that they were R.J.'s parents, and it wouldn't change just because Ridge was engaged to Katie.\n\n\nBrooke wanted all the parents to make it work for the children and remarked that being a father meant a lot to Bill. Ridge said that it was something he had to deal with. Ridge and Brooke agreed that R.J. had reacted well to the news. Ridge said that their son had taken his cue from Brooke, and if R.J. had sensed that Brooke would be upset, R.J. would have reacted differently.\n\n\nBrooke stated that she wasn't hurt; she was worried -- and not for herself. Ridge assumed that she meant the timing of the proposal. He said that there was just one reason that he'd proposed and just one reason that Katie had agreed. It was because they wanted to spend their lives together. Brooke stated that she and Bill felt the same, but he hadn't proposed.\n\n\nRidge called Bill a clown and wondered how Brooke could put her faith in a man that was only loyal to himself. Ridge said that Bill wasn't the right man for Brooke, and Bill had left the mothers of his children to fend for themselves. Brooke disagreed that it had been that way. In her view, Bill was making up for lost time, and he had wonderful relationships with his sons.\n\n\nRidge felt that Bill only cared about winning, and if Bill had cared for Brooke, he would have ripped up the papers. Ridge felt that Bill hadn't done that because he wanted Brooke to sacrifice her relationship with Katie. Brooke declared that what Katie had done had been wrong. Ridge said that Bill had gotten what he had wanted, and Brooke had paid the price. Ridge didn't want his son around someone like that or to see someone unworthy using Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that R.J. would see her happy with a man that was completely committed to her. Ridge declared that he didn't want Bill around R.J. Shocked, Brooke replied that she was sorry, but it wasn't possible. Brooke asserted that Bill was an important part of her life, and he'd be an important part of R.J.'s life, whether Ridge liked it or not.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was alone when Bill arrived. He said he'd heard about the proposal from Katie. Brooke relayed that she and Ridge had told R.J., who'd taken it better than she had. She stated that she'd learned first from Katie, who'd thrown it in Brooke's face and blamed Brooke about the papers. Brooke said Katie thought Brooke had betrayed her, and Brooke didn't think Katie would forgive it.\n\n\nBill believed Katie would. He said that Katie was too happy \"now.\" Brooke and Bill hugged.\n\n\nBack at Katie's house, Ridge arrived. Katie began to talk about Brooke and Bill, but Ridge didn't want to discuss them. She said Ridge would be surprised by Bill's reaction. Ridge replied that nothing surprised him about Bill. Katie said that Ridge had turned her miserable day into the happiest day of her life, and the two kissed. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "With mud in her eyes, Aly wields the medieval axe toward Taylor as she shrinks and says No. Oliver tells Thorne that this is bad \u0096 him and Taylor a couple especially after the way that Aly feels about Taylor. He says he can't tell Thorne how to live his life, but Aly will not be able to handle this. She still blames Taylor for her mother's death. Sometimes the truth can be devastating. He knows Thorne would never intentionally hurt Aly. Thorne says no, but he won't keep this a secret from Aly. He and Taylor have made their decision and as soon as she comes back, they will tell Aly. Oliver says she has been gone a while; maybe she ran into Aly. They both rush out. Donna hugs Katie and assures her that she is happy for her being engaged to Ridge. Katie tells Donna that Bill will be here soon. When Bill comes Katie says she has news for him. It's a good thing but she wanted him to hear it from her. She explains that Ridge proposed. She holds up her finger with the red ribbon still entwined. Bill quips that the dress business must be slow if he couldn't pop for a real ring. She says no, but she actually likes this one more. She knows Ridge is not his favorite person but she hopes they can all be civil as he will be Will's stepfather. Bill says bad enough that he has to deal with Quinn, now Forrester too. But if he is part of Will's life, he will be part of his too. Katie says things are looking up, something she thought would never happen when Brooke shoved those papers in her face. Bill grouses that enough with those papers; she conned him out of his company and his son. Brooke was only righting a wrong. She did try to reason with Katie and not use the papers but Katie would have none of it. And he is not going to apologize for getting back what is rightfully his. She says fine, she won't apologize either. What she has learned is that you can not dwell too much on what happens in the future or you can't enjoy the present. He says that sounds like Forrester. She says he has been a positive influence on her. He bets with all that poetry, bet the proposal was pretty flowery .and well timed. Ridge tells Brooke that the kids will be fine. Brooke says they will have to make sure of it. They all need to get along. Ridge says okay but for now they just need to focus on the kids. RJ seemed to take the news well and he took his cue from Brooke. A boy wants to protect his mother. If he thought she was going to be hurt, he would have reacted differently. She says she is not hurt, just worried and not for herself. He says don't be. He and Katie want to spend their lives together and that is why he proposed. She says Bill has not proposed but their feelings are just as strong. He calls Bill a clown and wonders how she can put her faith in him. He continues when Brooke says he is wrong. He tells her that if Bill cared for her he would have ripped up those papers but no he wanted her to sacrifice her relationship with Katie. He doesn't want his son around that. Brooke tells him that she is sorry he feels that way. That is not a decision for Ridge to make. Bill is an important part of her life and will be RJ's too whether he like it or not. Taylor tells Aly that she is sorry but she and Thorne wanted to tell her together. She should have waited but Aly asked her a question and she could not lie. Aly tells her to shut up. She lays the axe aside. She tells Taylor that she is lying. She killed her mother and destroyed the life she was supposed to have. Taylor tries to convince her that she will always have her father. Her relationship with Thorne will not change that. Aly rants at her that she does to have a relationship with Thorne. He would never want her. Taylor tells her now is the time to let go of all this resentment in her heart. Aly says she does not have resentment, she hates Taylor. Ollie and Thorne walk in and Aly rushes to Thorne. She says Taylor has been saying horrible things. Tell her that she is wrong. Bill tells Katie that he wishes Ridge was not going to be raising his son but he will not have him calling Ridge Dad, that is where he draws the line. She says fine as she does not want Will calling Brooke mommy either. Bill says the papers didn't just get him back his company but equal custody so if that means dealing with Forrester he will try. He says when she marries Ridge, Will and RJ will be family so it's time they act like one. Thorne tells Aly that Taylor is not lying. He knows it is a shock but it is true. Aly starts to hyperventilate and says no, it is not true. He says she is not a little girl anymore and they wanted to talk to her. Ollie tells her that her dad is trying to explain how it all happened. She says she does not want to know. Thorne tells her that she is doing so well here at Forrester. She should be happy and excited about her life. Her mother would be so proud of her, mature and grown up. She turns on her father and asks if Darla would be proud of him too. He knew she could not accept this and yet he did it anyway. He says he is happier now than he has been in a long time. He tells her that he loves her and would never hurt her. She says okay, then don't go back to Paris. Stay here with her but just forget about Taylor. She can not do this again and does not want him to see her. He hugs her and says okay, anything for her ..always.",
