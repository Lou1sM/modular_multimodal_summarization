Erica wondered why Zende hadn't called her.\n\n\nLooking at Erica's number, Zende picked up the phone and prepared to dial. Kristen and Tony walked in and remarked that Zende hadn't changed for the party. Zende said he wanted to call his friend first. Tony felt Zende could make the call after the party, but Zende wanted to invite his friend to the party as his date.\n\n\nZende clarified that it would just be a friendship date. Kristen thought Zende's friend would feel out of place at a gathering that was limited to family. Then Zende piped up that his friend was Erica, the teacher's aide his parents had already met. Tony joked that he admired Zende's interest in an older woman, but Kristen found it unsettling that Zende's friend was that much older. Zende begged Tony and Kristen to let Erica attend the party.\n\n\nErica reasoned that she was lucky to have met Amber at all, and she marveled that Rick and Amber had to have had an amazing life. Erica then fantasized that she was married to Rick, who had given Erica her favorite flowers. Erica gushed how sweet Rick had been to gift her with the flowers; Rick said he was returning the favor, since Erica had done so much for Rick and Little Eric. Erica said she enjoyed doing things for them. Rick said he enjoyed thanking Erica and sat her down on the couch, kissing her passionately.\n\n\nErica snapped out of her reverie and berated herself for thinking she could make a man like Rick Forrester happy. Erica opined that Rick deserved someone as brilliant and creative as Amber, who was totally into him, and Erica thought it was cool how two people from such different worlds could have found each other.\n\n\nDeacon emerged from behind the partition. \"Your daughter's husband?\" Stephanie asked, horrified. Brooke and Deacon both tried to convince Stephanie that Stephanie had misinterpreted what she had seen, but Stephanie wanted to know how Brooke could do such a thing to her daughter, not to mention the father of Brooke's unborn baby. Then it dawned on Stephanie that Brooke was not pregnant by Whip but by Deacon.\n\n\nBrooke denied Deacon was the baby's father, but Stephanie revealed that she had seen how Deacon and Brooke had looked at each other. Stephanie deemed Brooke a slut for sleeping with her daughter's husband. Brooke wanted Deacon to tell Stephanie she was wrong. Deacon hedged, then spat that Stephanie was going to believe whatever she wanted. What Stephanie believed was that Brooke and Deacon had been \"rutting like pigs in the mud.\"\n\n\nWhen Brooke said she loved the baby, Stephanie fumed that they were talking about Brooke's daughter, who had needed protection. Brooke yelled that she was protecting Bridget, but Stephanie thought Brooke was only protecting Bridget from the fact that Deacon had fathered Brooke's child. Brooke tearfully admitted the baby was Deacon's.\n\n\nAghast, Stephanie said she had believed that Brooke's only saving grace had been Brooke's love for her children. Stephanie railed that Bridget had been too much competition for Brooke, which Brooke called sick. Deacon tried to intervene, but Stephanie yelled for him to shut up and remarked that Bridget was more than Deacon deserved in a million lifetimes. Deacon had thrown Bridget in the gutter for the whore of Beverly Hills. Brooke slapped Stephanie, who fumed that she would kill Brooke then and there if Brooke weren't pregnant.\n\n\nDeacon ordered Stephanie out. Stephanie told Brooke that she would never forgive herself for not taking Bridget away from Brooke when Stephanie had had the chance. Brooke insisted that the situation had nothing to do with Bridget. Deacon and Brooke concurred that they'd both thought Deacon's marriage to Bridget had been over. Brooke said she'd never forgive herself for what she had done, but Stephanie found Brooke's words hollow.\n\n\nDeacon told Stephanie to put a sock in it so Stephanie could help them find a way out of the mess. Deacon begged Stephanie to understand that he and Brooke had tried to end the affair, to the point that Brooke had taken off to Paris and gotten engaged to Whip. Stephanie was shocked to learn that Whip had known that Brooke's baby was Deacon's. Deacon reported that Whip had used that information to blackmail Brooke into an engagement.\n\n\nBrooke didn't think she could marry Whip. Deacon implored Brooke not to, as it wouldn't change the situation -- or their feelings for each other. Deacon worried that, the next time, it might be Bridget who walked through the door. Stephanie thought maybe that was what Brooke and Deacon wanted. Brooke was adamant that Bridget not find out about the affair, but Deacon disagreed and felt they should break it to Bridget as gently as they could.\n\n\nStephanie became sincerely calm and asked Deacon to leave so she could talk to Brooke alone. Deacon kissed Brooke's forehead and told her he wouldn't be far. Once Deacon left, Stephanie observed that Deacon had made a convincing argument...especially if it was one Brooke had wanted to hear. Brooke reiterated that she was willing to marry Whip if it meant Bridget wouldn't learn about Brooke and Deacon. Stephanie was glad to hear that, because, Stephanie maintained, Brooke was going to marry Whip.\n\n\nDeacon paced in the office he shared with Whip. Megan arrived and wondered why Deacon hadn't left for the party. Deacon informed Megan that he didn't think there was going to be a party, because Stephanie had found out about him and Brooke.\n\n\nStephanie couldn't believe that Brooke had to be told to do the right thing and wondered if Brooke had thought about how much the truth would hurt Bridget. Brooke disclosed that she'd had nightmares about it. Brooke didn't want to lose Bridget, but Stephanie asserted that the whole family could, as Bridget had ended up in the hospital the last time Deacon had lied to her. Stephanie was distraught that Brooke was willing to throw Bridget away for a roll in the hay.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that she and Deacon were in love. Stephanie snarked that Brooke was always in love. To Stephanie, the only person whose feelings counted was Bridget. Stephanie wanted Brooke to give Deacon up. If Brooke didn't, Stephanie assumed, Deacon would just leave Brooke, anyway, and then Brooke would truly be alone because everyone in the family would reject Brooke for what she had done to Bridget.\n\n\nStephanie announced that, out of her love for Bridget, she would help Brooke, who wondered if Stephanie meant to help Brooke or punish her. Brooke cried that she had tried everything she'd known to stop the affair with Deacon and that it hadn't been easy making the sacrifice for Bridget. Stephanie was appalled that Brooke thought of herself as the victim in the situation.\n\n\nStephanie dragged Brooke over to the mirror, forcing Brooke to look at herself. Brooke had no halo, Stephanie seethed, and Brooke was no heroine. Stephanie called Brooke sleeping with her daughter's husband vile and filthy. She screamed that not only was Brooke going to marry Whip, but Brooke was going to go to the party.\n\n\nWhen Megan worried that Stephanie had caught Brooke and Deacon in bed, Deacon relayed that he and Brooke had only been kissing. Deacon didn't know if Stephanie was going to tell Bridget and said that Brooke and Stephanie were hashing that out at that very moment. Megan panicked that Deacon had left Stephanie and Brooke alone together, because Deacon had no idea what Stephanie was capable of in regard to Brooke. Megan exhorted Deacon to go back and protect Brooke from Stephanie.\n\n\nBrooke demanded to know who had given Stephanie the right to dictate Brooke's life. Stephanie retorted that Caroline, Taylor, and Macy had -- and that Macy was dead because of Brooke. Stephanie declared that she would save Brooke from herself. Brooke wept that she couldn't marry Whip. Heartfelt, Stephanie warned that any decision Brooke made for herself would affect Bridget and the baby, as well. Stephanie stood firm that Brooke needed her and Whip to get things right.\n\n\nBrooke surmised that she could just keep the baby's paternity a secret and forgo marrying Whip. Stephanie yelped that Brooke just didn't want to give Deacon up. If Brooke chose Deacon, Stephanie cautioned, Brooke would be giving up Bridget's love. Brooke said she had tried to let Deacon go, but Stephanie countered that all Brooke had done was try to get away with everything. Stephanie ordered Brooke to get ready for the party, adding that Brooke needed to give the performance of her life there. When Brooke hesitated, Stephanie asked \"Mrs. Whip Jones\" if she had understood. Brooke stared at Stephanie intently.\n\n\n",

Stephanie slaps her back, assuring Brooke that if she weren't pregnant, she'd tear her apart. They all agree that they need to protect Bridget, but Stephanie gets Brooke alone and tells Brooke that she's marrying Whip if she has to kick her butt all the way to the altar.
