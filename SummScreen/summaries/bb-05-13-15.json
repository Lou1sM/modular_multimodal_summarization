She added that it felt like they were the only two people in the world. She thanked Rick for being so indulgent of her, and Rick promised to do anything for her smile.\n\n\nMaya reminded Rick that they had discussed freezing moments in time, and she wanted to freeze moments at Big Bear because they were \"so pure and simple.\" She wished it could always be that way. Rick assured her it would be.\n\n\nRick and Maya discussed that their lives had been work-centric recently. They agreed their relationship was perfect. Maya gushed that her moments with him were perfect enough to last her a lifetime. Rick later delivered martinis and told Maya that she had changed his life. \"You've shown me what it means to be truly loved,\" he said. They toasted. Rick kissed her hand. He gushed that he wanted to be worthy of her and that he had waited his entire life for her.\n\n\n\"I want you forever,\" Rick said, and he got down on one knee. He pulled out a ring and asked Maya to marry him. Maya smiled, but she heard Brooke's voice echoing in her head, saying, \"You can't accept that proposal.\"\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke entered Ridge's office and asked him if he'd heard from Rick. Ridge wondered why he would hear from Rick, and Brooke responded that Rick might want to discuss something work related. Ridge said he had heard nothing, but he worried that Nicole had told Wyatt about Maya. Brooke angrily said that too many people knew, and Rick did not.\n\n\nBrooke wondered what had happened that Nicole would blab to Wyatt. Ridge agreed she had made a big mistake. Brooke marveled that Ridge cared. Ridge didn't want Bill Spencer sharing the news all over the world. Brooke said she needed to see what was happening. She left, and Ridge followed.\n\n\nIn Wyatt's office at Forrester, Wyatt wondered if Nicole was all right. He said she was \"jangly.\" Nicole said it sounded irritating, and she worried that telling Wyatt about Maya had been a mistake. Nicole pressured Wyatt -- she wanted to be sure he had told no one. She lamented that Carter had known.\n\n\nWyatt was amazed that Carter knew, and he stuttered that he didn't trust Carter to keep his mouth shut because Maya had cheated on Carter with Rick. Nicole said that Rick would soon find out because he was proposing to Maya that night at Big Bear.\n\n\nBrooke and Ridge entered. Brooke wondered why Nicole had told Wyatt. Ridge chimed in that Wyatt had probably already told his father. Wyatt said nothing. Nicole defended her relationship with Wyatt. She added that he knew how important it was to keep quiet. Wyatt nodded. Brooke and Ridge looked skeptical.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill sat in his chair, glaring at the picture of Maya, and Justin entered. Bill asked Justin his opinion about Maya. Justin answered that she was beautiful and flawless. Bill pointed out Maya's birth name had been Myron.\n\n\nJustin guessed that Bill was joking. \"Maya was born Myron,\" Bill repeated. He added that there was some urgency in announcing it in order to oust Rick from the Forrester CEO chair. Katie interrupted the conversation.\n\n\nKatie announced that she, Bill, and Liam had agreed that they would not exploit the news about Maya. \"It's personal business between Rick and Maya,\" Katie stated. Bill maintained that Justin needed to be in the loop. Katie reminded Bill that the news was personal. She would not allow Bill to destroy her nephew's private life. It was morally wrong.\n\n\nBill said he had never trusted Maya, and he called her a gold-digger. Bill announced they would run with the Maya story. Katie shook her head.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "At the cabin Rick tells Maya there is a whole big world out there and he wants to show it all to her. She says they really can do anything, overcoming all odds and she is counting on that. She loves it here and feels they are the only two people in the world. It feels so pure and simple and she wishes it could always be this way. He says it will. Brooke confronts Ridge and they discuss that neither have heard from Rick. She just hopes that he is in Big Bear by now and Maya has told him that she is transgender before someone else does. Ridge muses that will be difficult now that Nicole has brought Wyatt into the loop by divulging the secret to him. Brooke knows that is not good. This could get to Bill and this should not be splashed around in the media. Ridge agrees. He wants Rick to go down but not because of Bill. Brooke says Rick needs to find out from Maya not from the press hounding him and camping out on his doorstep. Wyatt asks Nicole if she is a bit jangly. She says that sounds irritating and she hates feeling this way but she wonders if it was a mistake her telling him about her sister. She knows Carter also knows but he is not going to tell. Wyatt is not so sure since Maya hurt him and this could be payback. Nicole says it won't matter long as it is going down tonight. Rick will propose. Bill calls Justin into his office and tells him to sit down before he falls down. Despite Justin thinking Bill is pulling a good joke on him, Bill proceeds to tell him that Maya was born Myron, a dude. Katie walks in on them and is displeased when she hears the subject matter and how Bill seems to be ganging up on Maya. Bill uses Justin as an excuse of being the in house lawyer and had a right to know since they were in the middle of a hostile takeover. She says they agreed that he and Liam were not going to do this. She points her finger and says this is between Rick and Maya and has nothing to do with Liam or Bill. She agrees that she has no problem with them going after Rick for something else. But this is intensely personal and she is not going to let them make a circus out of his private life. Maya tells Rick that this is all happening so rapidly and nothing is perfect but this is as close as she has ever been. This right here and right now could last a lifetime. Brooke and Ridge walk in on Nicole and Wyatt. She wants to know if it is true, that she told Wyatt and why. Nicole admits that yes she did and the fact that he is Bill's son has nothing to do with them as they see each other. Ridge says she is being naive. Nicole says she and Wyatt are honest with each other. They trust each other and he won't say anything. Brooke hopes Nicole is right as Bill is a ruthless business man who will do whatever to get his results. This is personal and private with Maya and should not be used by Bill or Spencer Publications. Wyatt is quiet but seems to indicate he is on board with Brooke and won't say anything. Wisely Justin leaves Bill and Katie to their debate. She tells Bill not to play so innocent. This is about gender identity which neither of them know much about. This is not something they are going to use to oust Rick out of his job. Bill says she can not take this moral high ground and be so namby pamby. They have to do whatever it takes to get Rick out of office. It is fair game just like it is for celebrities, actors, athletes and politicians .and also Forrester spokes models. She says no, this is too personal, they can not publish this. It is Maya's story to tell. This is wrong and Bill can not talk his way out of wrong. He says again this is news and they publish news and they will run with the Maya story. Rick tells Maya that she says he has changed her life but she has changed his as well. He never wants to live without her again. No secrets, honest truth. He wants that. He wants her forever. He wants to hear that she feels the same and spend the rest of her life with him. He gets down on one knee and proposes.",
