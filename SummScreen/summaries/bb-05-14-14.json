Oliver explained that Aly wanted to forgive Taylor, but she didn't know how. Aly pointed out that Taylor had made at terrible decision to drive while drunk. Taylor admitted that it had been a horrible mistake.\n\n\nTaylor tearfully apologized and reminded Aly how she would regret it for the rest of my life. Aly asked why Taylor had driven. Taylor recalled that Phoebe had had a flat tire, and Phoebe had been scared. Taylor admitted that nothing could ever lessen her guilt. Aly cried. Taylor continued that there wasn't a day in her life that that she hadn't thought about the night she'd hit Darla.\n\n\nTaylor flashed back to the night she had hit Darla, and she recalled seeing Thorne looking at a dying Darla at the hospital. \"Tell me about what happened. Tell me about that night,\" Aly suggested.\n\n\nTaylor explained that it had been Phoebe's birthday, and they had all gathered at Thorne and Darla's, but they had driven different cars. Taylor had been at home, and Phoebe had called because she'd had a flat tire, and she had been stuck along the highway in Malibu. Phoebe had been scared, and it had been foggy and rainy that night.\n\n\nTaylor recalled that she had told Phoebe to wait for the service truck, but Taylor had known that Phoebe had been uncomfortable so Taylor had gone to get her. Aly remembered the birthday party at the beach house with her grandparents and Grandma Sally.\n\n\nPhoebe had also called Darla and reported that her tire had been flat. Darla had headed out to the highway also. Aly interjected that Darla would never have allowed Phoebe to wait for the service truck, so Darla had decided to change the tire. \"My mom wasn't about to wait for someone to change the tire,\" Aly said.\n\n\nTaylor added that she had barely been able to see in the fog, and she had known she shouldn't have been driving. Taylor painfully recalled that she had watched Darla slip into the road. \"She fell, and it happened so fast,\" Taylor said.\n\n\nTaylor admitted that she couldn't forgive herself. Taylor added that Aly's mother had been very special. Aly said her mother had been a saint. Taylor sat down and cried. Oliver pointed out that it had all been a tragic accident. Oliver reminded Aly that Thorne had recovered in order to help Aly. \"Dad was my rock,\" Aly admitted.\n\n\nAly realized that her father had been grieving, and it had been Taylor who had finally helped him recover. Oliver added that no one would have wanted her father to be so depressed. \"You helped him. You gave my father back his life,\" Aly said to Taylor. Taylor and Aly hugged, and they both wept and embraced.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Brooke welcomed Thorne back to Los Angeles. Brooke admitted that things had changed. She was with Bill, and Ridge had moved on with Katie. Brooke added that Ridge didn't want Bill to spend any time with R.J., and Thorne agreed with Ridge.\n\n\nThorne admitted that he had his own problems because he and Taylor had been seeing each other again. Brooke realized that Aly had not reacted well to Thorne and Taylor's relationship. \"Were you able to reason with her,\" Brooke asked.\n\n\nThorne explained that Aly had felt betrayed. He added that Aly felt her mother would never have approved of Taylor and neither would Aly. Thorne said he had to back away from Taylor because he could not hurt his daughter. \n\n\nBrooke sympathized with Thorne, and Thorne said he planned to give up his role at Forrester International to remain at Forrester in Los Angeles in order to stay close to Aly. Brooke suggested that he take Aly to Paris, but Thorne lamented that Taylor was in Paris, and they were in love, but Thorne needed to take care of his daughter. Brooke hugged Thorne and sympathized.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill finished planning his schedule with Jeannette, and he asked her for three hours uninterrupted. \"Done,\" she said, but Ridge entered. Bill teased that Ridge had been selling evening gowns door to door again. Bill congratulated Ridge on his engagement to Katie. Bill said that he wanted Katie to be happy.\n\n\nRidge said that he wished he could say the same to Bill, but Ridge admitted that he wanted nothing to do with Bill. Ridge didn't want Bill near R.J. or Brooke. Bill called it separation anxiety, but Ridge disagreed. Ridge added that Katie could pursue legal action to oust Bill at Spencer, but Bill said that they both knew Katie didn't want to do that.\n\n\nBill tried to tell Ridge about his relationship with Brooke, but Ridge said Bill knew nothing about Ridge or Brooke or their history. Bill said he had enjoyed the learning process. Ridge was adamant that he didn't want Bill near Brooke or R.J., but Bill said that was impossible, and Ridge needed to lighten up.\n\n\nRidge said that Katie and Brooke knew how he felt. Bill reminded Ridge that they would soon all be family. Bill added that he didn't want Ridge around Will, but Bill trusted Katie's judgment. Bill said it was just a matter of time before he and Brooke were married. Ridge glared at Bill.\n\n\nRidge said he had no trust in Brooke's judgment since she had hooked up with Bill. Bill tried to reason with Ridge, but Ridge would have none of it. Bill accused Ridge of obsessing. Bill reminded Ridge that Bill and Brooke were going to get married. \"Brooke will never again be your Logan,\" Bill said. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge and Bill verbally spar, each trying to on-up the other. Thorne turns to Brooke for advice about Aly and Taylor. Aly asks Taylor to tell her about the night her mother died. Taylor emotionally breaks down as she tells her the story.",
    "imdb": "Thorne turns to Brooke for advice about Aly and Taylor. Meanwhile, Aly asks Taylor to tell her about the night her mother died. Noting how people called her mom's death an accident, Aly states that it wasn't an accident that Taylor chose to drive drunk. Taylor sobs that it was a horrible mistake, one she'll regret for the rest of her life! Oliver then reminds Alexandria that it was Taylor who helped Thorne survive after Darla's tragic and untimely death. Ridge and Bill verbally spar. Bill accuses Ridge of trying to keep him away from Brooke by forbidding him any contact with R.J., stating that this won't work.",
    "tvmega_recap": "With Ollie by her side, Aly asks Taylor how can she can do it; how can she forgive her for killing her mother. She's not saying she can or ever will, but just how. Ollie says that Aly needs to forgive so she can move on, but she doesn't know how. Taylor tells Ollie that he is a good friend. He says he just wants Aly at peace. Aly isn't sure that is possible since again she blames Taylor for killing her mother. People call it an accident but driving while you are drunk is not an accident. Taylor agrees that it is not. She cries it was a horrible mistake. Brooke runs into Thorne and is surprised to see him back in town. She makes sure that he hears the news of her and Bill and Katie and Ridge. When it turns to children, he says he is learning first hand the hard way. She asks if his trip has anything to do with Aly. He confides that he did not come here alone. Taylor came with him. They have been seeing each other again. Aly did not know and that is why they came here to tell her. Brooke assumes that did not go well. Thorne confesses no, there is no reasoning about this. Aly felt betrayed. She even threw Darla's name into it that she would not approve and neither will Aly. So he had to back away before she completely lost it. His daughter is too fragile so he had to break it off with Taylor. Bill clears his calendar and tells his secretary not to schedule anything for three hours, but ..Ridge slips in the door. Bill is agitated at seeing him. He quips if Ridge is selling gowns door to door. He will have to pass. He will congratulate him on being engaged to Katie. He didn't exactly kick up his heels but he does want Katie to be happy, so if Ridge is it \u0096 cheers. Ridge says he appreciates that and he wishes he could say the same about Bill and Brooke. Bill says he feels some separation anxiety. Ridge says no, not on his part. Bill admits that is what he likes about Ridge .he doesn't leave home without his ego. But he's got news for Ridge that Brooke is over him by light years. He leans in and whispers to Bill that he and Brooke have something they never experienced. It's called loyalty. She knows he is not going to go running off to Paris over some freaking text message. He knows how to hold onto her. He's learning and enjoying the process. Ridge tells him to enjoy it while he can. Ridge says getting with lawyers hasn't been ruled out. It would not take long to overturn this. Bill tells him to help himself to a little espresso and think about what he is saying. He does not want to go there. That's right in his wheelhouse. He loves a good battle, especially one in which he knows he will win. And they both know Katie was not happy here. It was just something for her to focus on. Strange that it is, she is happier now. Ridge quips yes now that she is rid of Bill. Bill says she won't be if she drags him into court. Ridge says good point as she does want him out of her life. Bill says wish granted. They discuss children and how that can not be avoided that they will be in each other's lives. Ridge says there has to be as he can not have him anywhere near his son. Taylor tells Aly that she wishes she could tell her how to forgive her. She's told her many times over the years how sorry she is for her part in her mother's death. She will regret that for the rest of her life. Aly questions her more why she was not more responsible. She's a doctor and had been drinking. Taylor tries to explain that her daughter was out in Malibu and had a flat tire and called her and she just wanted to rush and help her. She should have called someone else but all she could think was her daughter was in a dangerous position and to get to her. She was not thinking clearly. Aly says no she wasn't and now her mother is dead. Can Taylor see how she can not get past that? Taylor says yes, that is why she is going back to Paris. Ollie reminds her that Thorne forgave Taylor and even wanted to marry her. Taylor says the only reason that she was able to go on was because Thorne forgave her and he was able to go on with his life with Aly. Bill tells Ridge he doesn't see how that is possible to stay away from RJ. Ridge says simple, just don't live with Brooke. He'd love for Bill to stay away from both of them. Bill says he will give Ridge a little advice .do not tell Katie about this. She will not appreciate that he doesn't want Brooke around another man. Ridge says not just any man, Bill in particular. He thinks Katie knows why. Bill says he hates to be the bearer of bad news but they will be family once he marries Brooke which is only a matter of time. Thorne even tells Brooke that he is resigning from International. He loves the job but he loves his daughter more. Aly needs him here and he's going to be there for her. He can't take Aly back to Paris as Taylor will still be there. They can't live in the same city. Taylor tells Aly if there is anything she can do before she goes back to Paris, just let her know. Aly wants to know what happened that night. Taylor gives her the entire story how Phoebe was caught out on the road in Malibu and had a flat tire. She called her and then she called Aly's house. Darla left and got to Phoebe before Taylor did. She started changing the tire herself. Darla slipped and fell back into the traffic right as Taylor was approaching and could not stop. She cries again that she is so sorry. She says she can't forgive herself so there is no way she can expect Aly to. She says her mother was special. Aly calls her a saint and says obviously she never got over it. Her dad was her rock and she doesn't think she could have gotten through all of that if he was messed up too. Oliver says her dad grieved too but he had to be strong for her and then move on. And it was Taylor who helped him. Aly was too young to help so he needed someone else. He is sure that Aly wouldn't want her dad to be sad and heartbroken the rest of his life. She admits that no, that would have been even worse. She looks at Taylor and says the woman who killed her mother gave her father back his life. Ridge tells Bill that his marrying Brooke can not happen. He won't allow him to be around his son. Bill tells him that is not his call. He is going to marry Brooke and RJ will be there. They will hang out together. He will teach him to ride motorcycles and fly a hot air balloon. He's a boy, a great boy and it will be cool. So Ridge just needs to lighten up and not be so grumpy. Go design a new dress. Maybe that will make him feel better. He doesn't want him hanging around Will either but he's choosing to trust Katie in this and Ridge should trust Brooke as well. Ridge says that his trust in Brooke went right out the window when she took up with Bill. Bill tells him to get over it and quit obsessing. Their paths are gonna cross. And Brooke is gonna be with a man who is 100% devoted to her. They are getting married... committed and no waffling. Brooke will never again be his Logan.",
