Ignoring Nick, Stephanie continued to pressure Brooke to accompany her. Brooke apologized to Nick but told him she had to go. Not trusting Stephanie's motives, Nick decided to join them.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Ridge's hospital room, Dante and Felicia broke away from their kiss and tried to understand why they felt so drawn to one another. Felicia thought it was just because it was such an emotional time for them. Just as they were about to kiss again, Bridget walked in and asked them about Ridge. They told her he was having more tests. Sensing they were uncomfortable, Bridget asked if she had interrupted something. \n\n\nFelicia covered, explaining that Dante had just been comforting her. Bridget remained clueless and began to fawn all over Dante. Dante offered to stay with her at the hospital, but Bridget insisted that he and Felicia go be with their son. Before Dante and Felicia left, Dante kissed Bridget goodbye as Felicia looked on with a guilt-ridden face.\n\n\nAt the Forrester guesthouse, Dante had put Dominick to bed and continued his flirtations with Felicia. Felicia teased him again about the fact that she could not remember the night they had spent together. Felicia did not understand why Dante was still living with Bridget after she refused to marry him. Dante explained that Bridget just needed more time, but Felicia did not buy it. She thought Bridget might never be ready to marry Dante. She wondered why Dante had kissed her if he was so devoted to Bridget. \n\n\nDante joked that Felicia had kissed him. Their flirting was momentarily stopped when the baby began to cry. They took the baby out, and while Felicia was holding him, she admitted that she was the one who had instigated the kiss. She told him it would not happen again, but Dante did not believe her. She told him he should go, but her eyes asked him to stay. \n\n\nOutside of Ridge's room, Eric questioned Christian about the MRI and was told that the test had been inconclusive. Christian was concerned that Ridge was still unconscious and wanted to perform another test on him. Just as Christian walked away, Jackie and Stephen showed up. Eric was surprised to see Stephen but greeted him with a handshake. Eric told them that Ridge's condition still had not improved. \n\n\nJackie did not think Brooke was the answer and was upset that Stephanie was interfering in her son's relationship. Eric defended Stephanie, but Jackie thought she was up to no good. Eric was annoyed that Jackie had drawn Stephen into the drama. Tired of being played for a fool, and fed up with Eric constantly sticking by Stephanie, Jackie gave him back her engagement ring. Eric told her he did not regret a moment they had shared together, and Jackie told him she felt the same way. \n\n\nWhen Eric and Jackie were hugging each other goodbye, Eric got a call from Stephanie. She told him she was on her way with Brooke. While Eric was on the phone, Jackie told Stephen that Stephanie was fooling Eric. Jackie did not believe Stephanie had had an epiphany about Brooke. Stephen agreed with her and asked if that was why she had given Eric back the ring. Jackie confessed that her relationship with Eric had been over for a long time. Stephen told her she had done the right thing. \n\n\nAt that moment, Stephanie arrived at the hospital with Brooke and Nick. They hurriedly greeted Eric. Stephen went over to Brooke and apologized for telling them where she was. Brooke assured Stephen he had done the right thing. Jackie disagreed, telling Brooke that Ridge was no longer her responsibility. \n\n\nBridget exited Ridge's room and was surprised to see her mom was already there. Stephanie pulled Brooke away from everyone, wanting her to get to Ridge as soon as possible. Jackie dragged Nick away and warned him that Stephanie was trying to tear him and Brooke apart. He told her that would not happen\n\n\nBack in Ridge's room, Brooke was sad to see Ridge looking so helpless in his hospital bed. Stephanie leaned over her son and told him she had taken Brooke to see him. She placed Ridge's hand in Brooke's and told him that it was the only place Brooke wanted to be at that moment. She told Ridge that she had made amends with Brooke. \n\n\nBrooke told Ridge she would always love him and that they would be connected forever. As tears formed in her eyes, she begged Ridge to return to her and R.J. Caressing his face, she kissed him. Miraculously, Ridge began to awaken, murmuring the name \"Logan.\" \n\n\n",
