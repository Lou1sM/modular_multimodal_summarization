    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge didn't know why Brooke and Eric were shocked that Wyatt had gone to Bill about Maya. Brooke became worried that Maya would drag Rick into the tabloids, but Ridge said he'd told Bill to keep the story private. Brooke wanted to speak to Bill herself, and Eric figured Ridge would love it if Bill hadn't listened. Ridge said that if Bill hadn't listened to Ridge, Bill had listened to Katie.\n\n\nRidge stated that Katie had made a strong stand regarding her nephew's private life. Eric doubted that it mattered because all Bill cared about was selling magazines. Brooke and Eric studied the media outlets on their phones and saw that things were quiet. They thanked Ridge for protecting Rick. Ridge was quick to say he was protecting the company, not Rick.\n\n\nRidge hoped that when Eric and Brooke stopped coddling Rick, they'd see that Rick had made the mess himself. Brooke blamed the situation on Maya, but Ridge said that it had been Rick, the dictator, who'd forced everyone to worship Maya. Ridge stated that karma was heading for Rick.\n\n\nEric rejected the idea of karma because Rick didn't deserve it. Eric didn't like Ridge calling Rick a dictator, but Ridge asserted that it was how Ridge saw Rick. Ridge said Rick had put Maya on a pedestal when he'd barely known her, and everyone had thought she had been manipulating her way into Rick's bed.\n\n\nBrooke replied that Maya loved Rick. Ridge said Rick wouldn't like that Maya had kept him in the dark. Eric reasoned that Rick might accept it if Maya revealed everything and asked for forgiveness for not doing it sooner. Ridge noted that Rick hadn't reacted that way with Caroline. Eric replied that Caroline hadn't confessed; she'd been exposed.  Ridge warned that it might not end the way that Brooke and Eric wanted it to.\n\n\nIn the living room at Big Bear, Rick handed Maya a drink and reminded her about his question. Maya said she'd answer it, but she had to tell him about her past first. Rick felt that Maya was a long way from the days when she'd run from who Rick was or whatever was in her past. He said she didn't have to run anymore.\n\n\nMaya didn't want to run anymore. She finally felt as if she belonged, and she was the woman she'd always wanted to be. She said that for a long time, her outside hadn't matched her inside, and she'd always felt that something had been off when she'd been growing up. Rick believed that every kid went through that in puberty, but Maya claimed it was deeper than that.\n\n\nMaya said her parents had been strict, inside-the-box people. To them, kids were seen but not heard, and she'd learned that no one would want to hear what she had to say anyway. Maya had spent a long time trying to please the people that couldn't accept who they'd given birth to. Rick guessed that they'd wanted Maya to be a certain way, but she'd had other ideas about her life.\n\n\nMaya agreed and said that when she'd been old enough, she'd left home to become the person Rick saw before him that day. Rick realized why it had been awkward when Nicole had showed up, causing Maya to face old memories. Maya admitted that it had been upsetting at first, but she was thankful for it, because it had prepared her for the conversation with Rick.\n\n\nMaya said she had to look at her past if she and Rick would have a future. Rick felt that they didn't need to trade childhood stories that night. He asked her to accept the proposal, and afterward, they'd have a lifetime to uncover the past. Maya insisted that she had to explain things, because, if they got married, he had to know the steps she'd taken to become his bride.\n\n\nRick insisted that he wasn't marrying the person of the past, and she wasn't obligated to explain her upbringing or who she'd been. He asserted that he wouldn't judge her upon how she'd been raised, where she'd been born, or for a lifestyle she hadn't been able to choose. Opening the ring box, he asked her to tell him what she had to, but the first word should be \"yes.\"\n\n\nRick said they could later delve into what made him Rick and what made her Maya. \"A lot more went into making me, and you need to know,\" Maya told him. She said it wouldn't be easy, but she'd answer his questions as best she could. Rick closed the ring box and agreed to listen.\n\n\nMaya decided to start with why she'd moved to Los Angeles. She'd needed help, physically and emotionally, to become the woman she knew she'd been meant to be. She agreed with Rick's sentiment that the past didn't matter, and she didn't think it should matter to her what had happened in his past with Caroline or Amber. What had happened to Rick as a baby or adolescent were just pieces that had led him to Maya, who only cared about that moment and having a life together.\n\n\nRick asked if that meant she'd marry him. Maya said she'd agree if he asked her after she finished. She believed there were certain things a husband needed to know about his wife. Rick admitted that she was starting to freak him out. Maya assured him it was positive and said they probably wouldn't be together if it hadn't happened.\n\n\nRick recalled that Maya had revealed that she'd moved to L.A. got get help. Maya said there hadn't been a doctor in her hometown to help her. He asked if she'd been sick, and she replied that she hadn't been in a traditional way. He remembered the estrogen pills and asked if they were linked. Maya replied that they were, and she needed them. \"To live?\" he asked.\n\n\nMaya explained that she'd sought a particular kind of doctor and had been taking the pills ever since. The pills helped her live the life she'd always seen for herself. She said the life she'd had before had been hurting her, and the way she'd been born hadn't been who she was. \"Like a birth defect?\" Rick asked. Maya thought of it that way sometimes, but other people didn't.\n\n\nRick shook his head in confusion. He didn't understand. \"There was no Maya Avant until after I came to L.A.,\" Maya said. He asked who she'd been. She replied that she'd been the same as she'd always been, but Forrester didn't have her original birth certificate on file. He asked why not. \"Because I had a boy's name. Myron,\" she explained. Rick asked why her parents would do that. Maya stated that it was because they'd raised her as a boy.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Justin asked if Bill wanted to think more about running the story. Bill knew it was risky, but he decided that he could handle Katie. Bill wanted everyone to know about Rick's girlfriend and told Justin to run the story.\n\n\nJustin asked what Liam, the editor, would think. Bill asserted that he made the final decisions, and he didn't feel like hearing, \"But, Dad. But, Dad,\" from Liam. Justin conveyed that it might be a good thing for Liam to talk Bill out of it and asked if Bill was worried about losing money.\n\n\nBill declared that they'd sell tons of magazines. He insisted that no one cared about transgender people in the fashion world -- except for housewives in line at the grocery store. Bill believed that Rick would also care, and when Rick learned about Maya, they'd be able to ship him off to Paris or a mental facility. \"Forrester will win. I will win. And there is no reason I shouldn't do this,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nKatie entered, asking what Bill would do. Justin left, and Katie said she'd thought they'd decided not to exploit Maya. Bill replied that it could be a huge story about a con artist who duped \"his way -- her way -- \" into Rick's bed. Katie warned Bill that he was going to land in trouble with Maya's story.\n\n\nKatie tried to text-message Liam about the story, but Bill took the phone. She insisted that Liam needed to know if Bill planned upon publishing a damaging article. Bill asked if he'd given her an indication that he'd publish anything. She said he had done so, and she asserted that Maya's past was her business. \"Don't publish,\" Katie told him.\n\n\nLater, Justin returned to ask if Katie had talked Bill out of publishing. Holding up a pad, Bill quoted, \"'Rick Forrester, Trans-ferring to Paris.'\" Bill contemplated focusing on Rick but decided that story wasn't about him. Bill showed Justin a photo of Maya's portrait, which hung in Stephanie's place of honor. Bill wanted the graphics department to touch it up. \"Forrester family matriarch once a man,\" Bill said. \"Now, that's a headline.\"\n\n\n",

Brooke and Eric thank Ridge for protecting Rick, but Ridge says that he was protecting the company, not Rick, by keeping the story out of the public eye.

    "tvmega_recap": "Rick gets Maya a drink and he wants her to continue. She says she wants to say yes but only after she tells him more about her past. Ridge tells Brooke and Eric that he went to Bill and told him to keep this quiet. Brooke also wants to talk to Bill as he might not listen to Ridge. Ridge says Katie knows and he doesn't think she will go along. Bill tells Justin that he will handle Katie. He wants the world to know about Rick's \"girlfriend\" - so run the story. And Liam doesn't have to know about this yet. They will sell a ton of magazines. No one cares if one is transgender but the housewives will care when they are in the checkout line. Rick will go down and either end up in mental hospital or at very least out of FC, either works for him. Katie walks in and knows they are up to something. Justin leaves them alone and she tells Bill that he is a smart man and he will know what sort of trouble he will be in if he publishes this story about Maya. Brooke and Eric thank Ridge for having Bill pull the story. Rick is a bully and dictator and this is karma. Eric refutes that. Maya kept Rick in the dark and Rick will not like that. Eric says maybe Rick will forgive her. Caroline was different. She was exposed and Maya has not been. Maya tells Rick that she finally knows who she is and is at home with him. She is the woman she wanted to be .and that is what she has to explain. She says this is more than typical strict parental upbringing. She felt different inside but she is proud of who she is now, not then .just trying to please her parents. When she was old enough she went to L.A. and became who she wanted to be. Now she is forced to face that past if they are to have a future so she is grateful that Nicole came to L.A. and looked her up. Rick says he has countless stories he could tell her so they do not have to have this conversation. She says yes, when they marry, if they marry then he needs to know exactly what happened. He says do not feel obligated to tell him how she grew up. He is marrying the Maya of today, not then. He is not going to judge her for a lifestyle she did not chose. He would never bale on her. She starts \u0096 she came to L.A. to act but more for herself. She knew if she moved to L.A. she could become the woman she was meant to be. Justin returns to Bill and asks if the coast is clear. Bill is working on his article and makes fun of some trans words. He tells Justin that he will not focus on Maya though, just Rick. He has a photo of Maya though, the one hanging over the mantel at Eric's ..headline \u0096 this lady, the matrix of the family now once was a man. Maya continues that she came from a small town, one where a doctor could not help her. He guesses the estrogen pills she needed to live. She says not in the way he means, but yes. She came to L.A. for a specific kind of doctor because the way she was living before was wrong. He's confused. She says there was no Maya Avant until she came to L.A. The birth certificate was not the one she had. Her name on it was Myron. She was raised as a boy.",
