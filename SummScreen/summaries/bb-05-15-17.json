    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester CEO's office, Ridge reviewed Zende's designs, which Steffy had given him. Ridge said Zende was the son of two designers, and it was about time Zende showed an interest in the profession. Ridge couldn't mentor Zende at the time because too much was going on. Steffy said she'd tried to tell Zende that. Ridge asked her to massage Zende to meet them, and he'd talk to Zende himself.\n\n\nRidge turned his attention to R.J. and Coco, who'd been waiting quietly behind Ridge and Steffy. Ridge thanked Coco for her loyalty and said that she could stay on at Forrester. Coco promised to never take her position for granted. R.J. asked if Ridge had heard about Bill's article. Ridge stated that as wrong as it had been, it didn't condone Sally's actions.\n\n\nSteffy told Coco that Forrester was glad to have her. Steffy believed that Coco had a future in the business; however, Sally didn't because of what Sally had done.\n\n\nIn the design office later, Zende was ecstatic about what Ridge had just said. Zende stated that it wasn't a designing job, but Ridge was giving Zende a shot. Nicole congratulated him and said she'd heard that Coco had regained her job. Coco stated that she was happy to be there and hadn't been so sure it would happen. Nicole prompted Zende to say that he'd been wrong to jump to conclusions about Coco. Zende did it but added that he'd never trust Sally.\n\n\n\"Don't go giving these to Sally, either,\" Zende said of his sketches. Nicole admonished him, but Coco said she could take a joke. Coco added that she'd checked her jewelry before heading to Forrester that day. Nicole stated that there wasn't a Spectra Fashions to worry about anymore, but Coco revealed that Spectra was still around, thanks to funds from Thomas.\n\n\nNicole and Zende were amazed that Thomas had forked over a hundred thousand dollars to keep Spectra in business. R.J. predicted that his father would be furious. Zende stated that it would be rightfully so, and there shouldn't be any last-minute saving after what Spectra had done. Zende said Thomas was out of his mind.\n\n\nCoco replied that Thomas wasn't crazy; he was in love. Zende didn't care what feelings Sally had for Thomas and stated that Sally should have gone to jail. R.J. said their grandfather had dropped the charges. Zende contended that their grandfather had done so under the condition that Spectra would fold. Nicole wasn't sure if they'd insisted upon it legally. She said they'd all just assumed that Spectra would be done.\n\n\n\"Thomas just walks in, hands over a ton of cash, and what? Spectra lives to see another day?\" Zende asked. Coco said she knew it didn't seem fair. R.J. remarked upon the review Bill had written, and Coco said if that had happened, then Sally had never had a fair shot to begin with. Though Coco believed that stealing was wrong, she wondered how else Sally was supposed to go legit. R.J. stated that Thomas was giving Sally the chance. Coco believed that Thomas and Sally would look back on it as the start of it all.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Steffy and Ridge worked, and Steffy remarked upon how happy Ridge had just made Zende. They began discussing Bill's review, and Steffy wondered if she should have told Thomas, who'd taken off for Spectra, anything about it.\n\n\nBill stormed in, and Ridge blurted out, \"What the hell?\" Bill said that was exactly his thought, and he asked \"what the hell\" was wrong with Ridge's son. Ridge thought Bill meant R.J., but Bill clarified that he had a problem with \"Captain Pencil Pants.\"\n\n\nSteffy told Bill that she wasn't a Sally fan, but what he'd done with the review hadn't been right. Bill said it was business, and he expected the co-CEOs to understand doing tough things to get the job done. \"Just for a building?\" she asked. Bill yelled that it was for the property, and he'd be erecting a magnificent creature on that property if \"Prince Poseur Junior\" hadn't shown up to Spectra with his big-boy checkbook in his lunchbox to help keep Spectra in business.\n\n\nRidge didn't believe it. Bill said he had no reason to lie -- \"about this.\" Bill had no patience for wannabe heroes. Steffy asked what had gone on. Bill explained that Thomas had paid off the Spectra debt, and Steffy wondered why Thomas would do such a thing. Bill told Ridge that Sally had conned Thomas once, but anyone with common sense wouldn't let it happen again -- except for Ridge's son, who'd written a check with Forrester money.\n\n\nSteffy stated that Spectra was supposed to close down. Bill replied that it was staying open due to Forrester money. As Bill ranted, Ridge said it was enough. Agreeing that it sure was enough, Bill demanded that something be done. Ridge said it would be, and he hurried out of the office.\n\n\nSteffy didn't know how to believe what had happened. Bill quipped that there wasn't a Forrester man in the world who didn't act like a puppy when falling for a girl, and it was why Thomas was throwing money at Sally. Bill vowed that he'd have that property, and he didn't care how many checks Thomas wrote. Steffy asserted that Thomas wouldn't be writing any more checks once their father was done with him.\n\n\nAt Thomas' loft, Sally said the place was bachelor living at its finest. Thomas offered to clean up a bit if she'd close her eyes, but she replied that he should see her place. She figured that a guy like Thomas, who'd made it so she could stay in town -- and who had a place in Venice Beach -- might be a keeper.\n\n\nSally and Thomas joked about him scoring points with her. She appreciated that he'd invested in her and promised that he wouldn't be disappointed. Thomas said he'd better not be, because he was also keeping up with the points she was scoring with him. Sally asked if he'd been nervous about Bill, but Thomas wasn't sorry about a guy whose physique looked like he'd \"skipped leg day\" at the gym.\n\n\nThomas and Sally made fun of Bill's brash behavior at Spectra earlier. Thomas didn't believe Bill deserved the property after what he'd done. Sally replied that she didn't know if she deserved it, either. Thomas wanted her to stop beating herself up because she'd been Bill Spencer's victim. Sally doubted the Forrester CEOs would agree.\n\n\nSally asked if Thomas had thought of what his family would think. Thomas said he hadn't at all and asked what difference it made because it was done. Sally predicted that his family would be furious, but Thomas reasoned that his family knew that impulsivity was part of his charm. He claimed that it very charming indeed. He said there had been a lot of hand-wringing over him inviting Sally to \"crash Steffy's wedding with me,\" but they'd eventually relaxed. He said she'd needed a real shot at starting a fashion house and asked how his family could be mad about it.\n\n\nSally stated that she'd stolen from the Forresters. Thomas was convinced that it was Bill who had forced Sally to the dark side. Sally promised that her poaching days were over. He believed her and believed that his family would, too.\n\n\nSally was awed by the way Thomas believed in her and looked at her. His forgiveness was more than just words, and she could feel it. Thomas said it was new for her to receive it and new for him to give it. He told her that she made it impossible not to believe in her. She replied that he made her feel the same about loving him, and they kissed.\n\n\nRidge's pounded on the front door and yelled for Thomas to open it right then. Sally panicked at Ridge's bellowing and wondered if she should hide. Thomas told her not to. Ridge rattled the door hinges with his knocking until Thomas opened the door. \"What have you done?\" Ridge asked, entering the loft. He saw Sally, pointed at her, and said, \"You, out!\"\n\n\nRidge yelled that Sally's family had taken from his and Thomas' from the start. \"And what did you do now? Give her money?\" Ridge asked. Thomas said he'd invested in Sally's company. \"You invested in this?\" Ridge asked, gesturing at Sally. \"What is wrong with you?\"\n\n\nThomas replied that nothing was wrong with him. Ridge said that they had been \"thisclose\" to getting rid of everyone in her family. Ridge asked Sally what part of \"out\" she didn't understand. He stated that no one wanted her there, but Thomas told Ridge that he didn't get to talk to Sally that way.\n\n\nRidge said it was his error and decided that Sally could stay -- until she repaid the money. Ridge declared the little romance to be over. Thomas said it wasn't, but Ridge asked if Thomas thought Ridge would let any Forrester associate with \"this criminal.\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy shows Ridge some of Zende's sketches. Ridge says he shows promise but they are too busy to oversee it now. He tells Coco that he underestimated her loyalty and she can stay on. Steffy agrees that Coco has a future in this business but not Sally after what she did. Zende tells Nicole that it wasn't a job offer but it was close enough and he will continue. Nicole tells Coco that the Forrester's will not hold it against her for her sister's actions. Zende re-states that Thomas is out of his mind. Sally was wrong and did not deserve this save. Sally laments to Thomas that just a few hours ago she had her bags packed and was ready to leave but then some handsome guy came along and rescued her. He says her that the truth is out. She only likes him for his loft so he is racking up Sally points. She reminds him that he paid the check and stood up to Bill so he has made lots of points. Bill could have really unleashed on him. They laugh at him and his chip off the old blockhead speech. Sally was clearly his victim and he deserves to lose the building space. Bill breaks into the meeting with Ridge and says there is something the matter with his son .Captain Mr. Pencil Pants. Sometimes you have to get a little rough and they just need to wait and see this magnificent creature he is going to create. If the dimwits will get out then he can take charge.

Bill says it does not matter how many checks Thomas writes. The Spectra's are going down and that building will be his. Sally reminds Thomas that his family will be furious. He says yeah but that is part of his charm. In the end they will relax after a lot of screaming. She was only pushed into the corner by the Dark Lord himself and it will never happen again. They kiss on that. Coco points out that Thomas is only showing Sally that he believes in her. And if anything happens between them now this will be the start of it all. Sally says it is not just that Thomas believes in her but the way he looks at her. She says it is impossible not to love him. They kiss again and say they can figure this out. There is a big pounding on the door. Ridge charges in and says there is something in the hell wrong with Thomas all because of this girl who stole from them. He announces this little romance is over. She's a criminal and he will not stand for it.",
