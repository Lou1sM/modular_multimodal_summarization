He gripped a gifted bottle of scotch and advised Liam that Liam needed to have his animals' rights article ready in time for Bill to read it before Bill went out of town. Bill said he was headed about as far away from \"L.A.\" as he could get.\n\n\nLiam was surprised that Bill would leave town so soon after getting back to work and reuniting with Brooke. Bill hoped that he could trust his vice president, even though Katie had appointed Liam, to hold the place down, and Bill added that Brooke was the motivation for the whole trip.\n\n\nBill didn't plan to go without Brooke. Liam asked where the couple was headed, and Bill showed Liam a website photo of scenic Dubai. Liam shouted the name of the city, but Bill shushed Liam because it was a secret. Liam said it was a once-in-a-lifetime trip and wondered what Bill was up to.\n\n\n\"Making memories,\" Bill replied. He said that Brooke had given him his life back. The trip was his way of showing Brooke what it meant to him and what she meant to him. Bill stated that he'd promised Brooke the world, and he was giving it to her.\n\n\nIn the Forrester's CEO office, Brooke and Hope discussed Hope dating Wyatt and Liam. Hope felt that she could see herself with either one of the men, each of whom was frustrated because each wanted to start a life with her. Brooke thought it was wonderful to have two great guys fight over Hope.\n\n\nBrooke advised Hope to take her time, and when Hope did make the decision, the men would be happy that she had taken the time to choose the right man. Hope didn't want to drag it out, and she feared that people would talk. Brooke reasoned that people did that, anyway, and Liam and Wyatt could handle courting Hope for a few more weeks.\n\n\nCourting sounded old-fashioned to Hope, but she decided that she deserved to be courted. Brooke replied that every woman did. Hope felt that Liam understood that she loved both men, but Wyatt was still working through it. Hope sensed that both men thought it was a challenge. Brooke reasoned that the pregnancy scare had turned out to be a good thing, and Hope's future would be wonderful no matter whom she chose.\n\n\nBill called Brooke to ask her to get to his office right away to see something. After the call, Hope guessed her lunch with Brooke was canceled. Brooke stated that Hope wasn't fond of Bill, and in reply, Hope struggled to say that if Bill made Brooke happy, then Brooke deserved it.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Quinn disdainfully brushed cat hair off Wyatt. She was at least glad it meant that Wyatt was spending time with Hope. Quinn was confident that Hope would pick Wyatt, but she told her son to make sure that Liam got custody of the cat. Wyatt poised his pen to sign some order forms, but he wasn't sure how to sign them. Quinn urged him to use his new name and be proud.\n\n\nQuinn cooed over the Spencer signature and said that Liam didn't have an edge over Wyatt in that area any longer. Wyatt remarked that he and Liam were Spencers and loved cats; it seemed like a level playing field to Wyatt, except he felt he had more charm and a more winning personality than Liam.\n\n\nQuinn and Wyatt entered Eric's office as Brooke was leaving. After Brooke had gone, Quinn guessed Brooke was rushing to see Bill. Hope called it young love, and Quinn claimed she didn't want to get in the middle of it. Quinn suggested that Hope and Wyatt go downstairs to view the new pieces, and as she shoved them out the door, Wyatt noted that she wasn't subtle with her matchmaking.\n\n\nAfter the two had gone, Quinn heard Hope's phone chime. She was almost about to call Hope's attention to the discarded phone, but instead, Quinn decided to check the messages. Liam had texted Hope to ask her to meet him in the Forrester steam room. Quinn deleted the message.\n\n\nLater, Hope and Wyatt returned for her phone, and she noted that she hadn't missed any messages. Hope decided to text-message Quinn about the pieces Hope had seen, and as Wyatt said that Quinn had an eye for matching jewelry and couples, Hope saw Liam's contact information on her phone.\n\n\nWyatt offered to take Hope to the beach, and Hope asked if they could do it after her meeting. He asked if she was slated for some Liam time, but Hope said she wasn't. It was strange to her that Liam hadn't contacted her that day. Wyatt assumed that Liam was sweating over a fashion article, and Hope was stuck with Wyatt.\n\n\nIn the steam room, the toweled Liam entered and waited for Hope. Quinn slinked up to the door and placed a barbell across it. She turned the temperature up to one hundred twenty-five degrees. Quinn upped the temperature five more degrees and walked away.\n\n\nInside, Liam became too hot. He banged on the door and shouted that someone had locked him in there. As he yelled for attention, Quinn was around the corner, snickering.\n\n\nBack at Bill's office, Bill could hardly finish his call when his eyes caught the sight of Brooke in his doorway. Brooke loved seeing him back in his element and wondered how he'd thank her for it. He asked where in the Middle East she'd ever been, and she replied nowhere. She asked what he was planning, and he replied that it would be the most romantic trip of her life.\n\n\nBrooke didn't know how they'd top Monte Carlo. Bill stated that they'd had beautiful memories, but it was time to make bigger, grander, life-changing memories. He showed her photos of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Brooke was amazed and asked what had inspired him. \"What do you think?\" he asked and pulled a ring box from his pocket.\n\n\nBill popped open the box, and Brooke uttered, \"You saved the ring!\" He replied that he'd known that she'd want it back on her finger one day. He told her that she was the only woman to accept him completely, and he hoped he was doing the same for her. She said he knew that he was. He'd planned the trip because it was time to make everything about them official.\n\n\nBill wanted to move forward with Brooke, who'd given him back his life, his son, and his company. \"All that's missing is you,\" he stated. He said it was time for them to commit to each other for the rest of their lives, and he asked her to marry him. Brooke excitedly agreed. Bill placed the ring on her ringer, kissed her hand, and then kissed her. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam sits in Bill's office as Bill opens more welcome back gifts. Bill says they are just pouring in. Bill asks if he has the animal piece ready. Liam says it will be in a few days. Bill says no, it will be today. He doesn't want to be a hard-ass about it but he's leaving town in a few days and he wants to be sure he has time to read it. Liam says he will have it. He wants to know where Bill is going. Bill says about as far away from here as he can get. Liam doesn't understand since he just got his company back and Brooke, so why would he want to leave it all now. Bill says he is not going to be gone that long and besides he has Liam as his trusted VP. He hopes he can trust him. And as far as Brooke, he would not leave town without her. She is the one motivating this trip. She knows nothing about it so Liam has to keep this secret. Liam says his lips are sealed. Bill turns his laptop around and Liam sees it is Dubai. Liam is blown away and says it is one of those once in a lifetime trips. Bill says it is making memories. Brooke gave him his life back, all of it, so this is just his way to show her what she means to him. Liam says most guys would just have bought her flowers, but this is like only old Dollar Bill can. Bill says lucky for Brooke; he is not like most guys. He promised her the world and he's giving it to her. Brooke asks Hope if she has any updates in her personal life. Hope says she is still dating both Liam and Wyatt and it is good. She needs this time. Brooke tells her there is no need to rush if she has feelings for both. Hope says she does. She could see herself with either of them. So she has to be careful and make the right decision before she moves on with her life. She knows both guys are frustrated but they are trying to hide it as they both want a life with her. She's so lucky but she doesn't want to drag this on. Brooke tells her again just to take her time and get to know both of them better and then when she is ready to make her decision and settle down, she will be glad she gave it this time. There is no timetable. Hope says but people will talk and it's not fair to Wyatt or Liam. She does not want to put them through this much longer. Brooke says the guys are fine. She is sure it's not a problem for them to court her for a few weeks. Hope likes the old fashioned sound of that. She thinks she deserves to be courted. She thinks the guys see it as a challenge. Bill calls Brooke and says he has something to show her; he'd like her to come over as quickly as she can. Hope pretends to be upset as Brooke is canceling their luncheon. Brooke apologizes and says it sounds important. Hope says she has issues with Bill but look how happy he is making her mom. As long as he treats her like the most important person in this world and makes her feel good about herself then she will be thrilled. So go and be happy. Quinn yuks when she finds cat hair on Wyatt's shirt. She says at least it is proving he is spending time with Hope. He says Liam gained points when he took Hope to the animal shelter but he is getting points too. Play time with a kitten usually drives girls crazy. Quinn makes a face at cats. She tells Wyatt that when Hope picks him in the end, and he will, just make sure Liam gets custody of the cat. She says they have new pieces to show Hope and wonders if Wyatt has signed the order forms. No, he says, but he will do that right now. He hesitates and is not sure what name to put. She tells him to be proud and use his new name. She says good job, he is a full fledged Spencer now .. Liam may have thought he had an edge, but no more. Wyatt quips that yeah they are both Spencers and both like cats so it's a level playing field. But then you add in his charm and winning personality She laughs Hope's choice will be clear. Quinn misses Brooke on her way out when she wanted to show her the pieces for the new collection. Must be off to see Bill, ah young love. She tells Wyatt she doesn't want to get in the middle of that. Maybe he should just grab Hope and take off too. They could take a cue from Brooke and go frolic too. They can start downstairs and see the new pieces. Hope says okay, they will frolic. Wyatt whispers to his mom that she is not very subtle when it comes to matchmaking. She says she knows. When they leave, Hope's phone rings. Quinn hesitates only a moment and looks at it. It's Liam asking Hope to meet him in the steam room. She deletes it. Hope and Wyatt come back to get the phone. She says she missed nothing but she feels naked without it. He hears the word naked and says they can lock the door. Well at least he tried, they settle for a kiss. Liam calls out Hope's name as he enters the steam room and decides that he is a little early. Quinn sneaks around and puts the lead bar on the door and turns up the heat to 135 degrees. She smirks when Liam gets hot and pounds on the door trying to get someone's attention. Brooke arrives at Bill's and says it is good to see him back in his element working so hard. How will he ever thank her. He asks where has she been in the Middle East as he has only the most romantic trip of her life. She thought Monte Carlo was pretty spectacular so how could he top that. They were in front of the Prince's palace and on his fabulous yacht. He shows her the laptop with Abu Dhabi and Dubai. He pulls the jewel box out of his pocket and she opens it. She's surprised that he saved the ring. He says of course as he knew the day would come when she'd want it back on her finger. He tells her that she is the only woman that has ever accepted him completely .who he is, how he thinks and he hopes he is doing the same for her. So he planned this trip to make it official .who they are and what they mean to each other. It's time for them to move forward. She has given him back his life, his company, his son. All that is missing is her. He says so let them start this adventure together. Marry him and let them commit themselves to each other for the rest of their lives. She can't say yes fast enough. He kisses her, then takes the ring and puts it on her finger and kisses it. They kiss again.",
