    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Thomas' place, Ridge wanted to talk to Thomas, and Sally wanted to leave. Thomas wanted her to stay, and Ridge insultingly asking her to leave. Sally insisted she did not want to get between Thomas and his and his father. She left.\n\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Ridge asked. He reminded Thomas that Sally had stolen from them and cost them a lot of money. Thomas countered that Bill had stolen Sally's chance at a career. \"So that makes it okay?\" Ridge asked. Thomas understood that it was not okay to steal from Forrester, but he added that Sally had learned from her mistakes.\n\n\nRidge continued to chastise Thomas for investing in Spectra and saving Sally, but Thomas fought back. He felt that Ridge would never let Thomas out of his shadow. He complained that Steffy had become the CEO when she had never designed, yet Eric and Ridge were designers and had served as CEOs.\n\n\n\"She is running our company with you. Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?\" Thomas asked. Ridge argued that Steffy had other experience, but Thomas countered that she had experience in publicity stunts and millions of social media followers.\n\n\nRidge promised that Thomas would get his chance in time. Thomas shook his head and said he had always been second or third when it came to the company. He felt he deserved to know his future with Forrester because he had plans of his own. Ridge looked surprised.\n\n\nRidge lectured Thomas about loyalty. He noted that Thomas was talented, and he demanded to know where Thomas thought that talent came from. Ridge insisted that he had taught Thomas the same way Eric had taught him. Ridge reminded Thomas that Ridge had been in the shadows for years.\n\n\nRidge added that Thomas needed to understand he had hurt the family and the company. Thomas said he felt he was the one who had been hurt -- not the company. Thomas argued that he had respect for the family and the company, but no one had shown him the same respect.\n\n\nRidge shouted that Sally had stolen from Forrester -- one of its best collections. Thomas said she would pay it back. Ridge scoffed that she would continue doing it because that was what Spectras had done for years -- since long before Thomas had been born. Ridge called Thomas a spoiled brat. \"Your relationship with Sally proves that,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nThomas reminded his father that he had been treated like Thorne, Felicia, and Kristin, who had never been given the opportunities that Steffy had. Ridge shook his head, but Thomas said that Ridge and Steffy were the favorites. \"I know what it's like to be like Thorne,\" Thomas said. Ridge accused him of sabotaging the company.\n\n\nRidge insisted that Thomas didn't exercise good judgment. Thomas reminded Ridge that Ridge had a history of poor judgment as well. He wondered if that was what had influenced Brooke to back out of their wedding. Thomas added that he loved Sally.\n\n\nRidge was furious. He suggested that Thomas needed some time away from Forrester to figure out what he wanted and to show respect for his father and his sister. \"Get back that money, get rid of Sally, and get your head on straight before you come back to Forrester,\" Ridge ordered. \"What are you saying?\" Thomas asked. Ridge fired Thomas, and then he left. Thomas looked shocked.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Charlie and Steffy discussed that Sally had stolen from the company. Charlie speculated that she deserved to lose her company, but Steffy said she was talented. She was worried about Thomas because he had defended Sally and given her the money she needed to stay in business.\n\n\nSally barged in. Charlie offered to escort her out, but Steffy said it was fine. Sally explained that she had been with Thomas and Ridge at Thomas' place. She explained that Ridge was furious. Sally insisted that she didn't want to make any more trouble for Thomas.\n\n\nSteffy said that Sally was trouble. She was using Forrester money to keep Spectra afloat, and she warned that Sally would never hurt Thomas again. Sally agreed and promised to go \"legit.\" She praised Thomas because he believed in her, loved her, and respected her. She begged Steffy for a chance to someday be friends. Steffy smirked and said they couldn't be friends until Sally got out of the fashion business and returned Thomas' check. However, Steffy knew that Sally would not comply with her terms.\n\n\nSally agreed. Steffy added that Sally had crashed her wedding and had taken advantage of everyone including Coco. Sally admitted that she had hurt her sister, but she told Steffy that not everyone was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She added that she had made some bad choices, but so had Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy noted that Sally had no class and integrity. She would never let Thomas \"fall into your clutches.\" Sally grew angry and advised Steffy not to start a war with her. \"You do not want to do that,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Brooke's place, she and Bill canoodled. \"You wrote that review?\" Brooke asked. She stated that Jarrett had clearly felt that Sally had promise. Bill was unapologetic. He discussed his skyscraper and said that he would have Brooke by his side when he built it.\n\n\nBrooke and Bill smiled and kissed. Bill added that no one would have learned the truth about the bad review if Liam hadn't told Steffy. Bill added that he was sure Ridge was furious, as well, because Thomas had cut a check for $100,000 to save Spectra. Brooke teased that Bill might be too busy for a wedding, but Bill said he was ready immediately. They kissed.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "During a late shift at the office, Steffy confides in Charlie that she is concerned that her brother being under the spell of Sally could cost the company dearly. In Venice, Sally elects to leave to not come between Thomas and Ridge. Thomas fights back against his father who accuses his son of betraying the family by supporting Sally. Thomas accuses Ridge of favoring Steffy and keeping different measures where his children are concerned. Eventually, Ridge has enough and informs Thomas that - unless he gets the money back from Spectra - he is fired. Sally pays a visit to Steffy with an apology and hope for them to become friends in the future. Steffy is not willing to call a truce just yet. Bill encourages Brooke to move forward with their lives and to stop the wait to get married.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Sally to get out. Thomas says she stays. Ridge argues that she stole from him and he is paying her to do it now. Despite Thomas's protests Sally says she will leave. She is not coming between him and his family. Ridge wants to know what is wrong with Thomas. That girl stole from them. Thomas says he knows that was not right but Bill Spencer stole her career right from under her. Some people learn from their mistakes while others don't. Thomas claims that he is in the shadow of Ridge. He designs and does all the grunt work but Steffy is the one who gets promoted. She is running the company with Ridge and Ridge does not seem to know how that makes him feel. Ridge tells Thomas that Steffy has worked very hard and she is a good CEO. Thomas says but she is not a designer. He will always be the second or third in line to run the company. He needs to know as he has his own plans. Sally walks into Steffy's office and says she needs to talk to her about her brother. She knows Steffy does not like her but she'd also like to know that she is not going to be trouble for Thomas with his dad. Whatever talent she has she will repay Thomas and never do this to him again. She needs a chance for them to all get along. Brooke is shocked when she hears that Bill wrote the review for Jarrett. He says yes that he is a sucker for the underdog. She asks if he is going to be too busy with this new building to plan their wedding. Thomas sort of put a hold on their plans with what he did. But she reminds him that Thomas is in love. He's a romantic. Bill says he calls that an idiot. And Steffy will not have patience with Sally's view of romance. And in the end he will have that building second to none just like his bride. Ridge tells Thomas this is not about his talent. It is about his selling out his family .and by the way his talent came from his family. Ridge says he worked under his own father for decades and he had respect for that. Thomas counters that Sally has done some bad things but she is changing. Ridge says it is still the same. Thomas is a spoiled brat and his feelings toward this family has not changed at all. Thomas says that Ridge keeps mentioning him betraying this family but Ridge has done the same thing. He does not see it because he is the favorite son and not Thorne. But if he is always going to come in second best then he has more places he can go. Steffy tells Sally that ever since she came to L.A. she has crashed her at every turn for publicity so she does not want her anywhere near her brother. If she wants what is best for him then get out of his way. She tells Sally that she is glad she is not in prison but do not expect anything else; they are not friends. Sally says she made a bad choice and now she is paying for it. Steffy reminds her no, Thomas is the one paying for it. He wrote her a check and kept her from going to prison. Sally retorts that she is working on herself trying to be better. Steffy says no, she is still a thief and she will not let Thomas fall into her clutches. Bill asks about RJ and how he feels about her engagement. Brooke says he really only wants her to be happy. He says good as he is not going to wait for his building; he wants to get married now. No more waiting, they have done that enough. He wants it right away. Ridge tells Thomas that he lacks one thing to be CEO, good judgment. Thomas argues that he too has made some sketchy judgment calls and that is why he is not marrying Brooke. Ridge says they have had this argument and it is over. He cannot work with him until Thomas figures this out. He would like for him to take a break from Forrester he is fired. Ridge says he means it. Thomas cannot come in here and disrespect him or Steffy so take a leave until he can straighten his life out. Sally tells Steffy that she have been in a shabby, roach infested building but she clawed her way to get above it and she is not going to give up. And she will not let Steffy come between her and Thomas. It's easy to talk about virtue when you have been born with a silver spoon in your mouth and now CEO of your own company. So do not start a war with her. She does not want to do that.",
