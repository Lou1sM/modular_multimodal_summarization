Stephanie compared Brooke's effect on Ridge's recovery to Dominick's effect on Felicia's recovery. She thought it was the same kind of miracle and kept thanking Brooke for saving Ridge's life. \n\n\nNick minimized Brooke's role in Ridge's recovery and felt the doctors deserved most of the credit. Nick told Stephanie the only reason she was kissing up to Brooke was because she blamed herself for her son's heart attack. He felt Stephanie's change of heart toward Brooke was just a desperate attempt to make it up to Ridge. Brooke questioned Stephanie's sincerity as well. \n\n\nNick and Stephanie argued about who was going to take Brooke home. Refusing to be swayed by Stephanie's pleas, Brooke insisted that her place was with Nick. She told Stephanie she loved Nick and planned to have a future with him. Stephanie argued that Brooke's \"destiny\" was with Ridge. Brooke reminded Stephanie she could have had a future with Ridge if Stephanie had not constantly interfered. Brooke and Nick went home, leaving Stephanie to sulk in the hospital. \n\n\nAfter Nick and Brooke left, Stephanie called Sally and said she wanted Sally to set up a mysterious press conference for the following day. Jackie barged in on Stephanie before she got the chance to go into details about the conference. Jackie was upset with Stephanie for dragging Brooke and Nick back into the love triangle. She said Stephanie was giving Ridge false hopes. \n\n\nStephanie argued Brooke would choose Ridge. Stephanie thought Jackie was interfering because she was upset about her breakup with Eric. Stephanie ruffled Jackie's feathers further by reminding Jackie how wrong she had been about Eric's feelings for her. \n\n\nJackie accused Stephanie of using Felicia's illness to hold on to Eric. Jackie said she would not let Stephanie pull the same trick to force Brooke to stay with Ridge. Jackie said she was tired of Stephanie using Brooke as a scapegoat, and she and Stephen intend to fight to keep Brooke and Nick together. \n\n\nStephanie scoffed at the idea of Stephen having any influence over Brooke. Jackie believed that Brooke would never choose Stephanie and Ridge again, since she knew what it was like to have a man who truly loved and supported her and a future mother-in-law that adored her. Stephanie appeared confident but, after Jackie left, realized it might not be that easy to win Brooke back.\n\n\nIn Ridge's hospital room, Jackie dropped in to visit him. She told him she and Nick were happy to know that he was getting better. Not believing a word she said, Ridge rolled his eyes and was glad to see her exit. After she left, Ridge dreamed of Brooke and woke up calling out her name. He remembered what Stephanie had said about supporting his relationship with Brooke. \n\n\nLater, Stephanie entered the room to check on Ridge. Ridge asked for Brooke, and she told him Brooke had needed to go home and check on the kids. Seeking her son's forgiveness, Stephanie once more apologized for undermining his relationship with Brooke. She told him she was determined to get Brooke back to him. Even though she did not love Brooke, Stephanie told Ridge that she finally understood how much he loved Brooke and promised to support the relationship. \n\n\nSkeptical at first, Ridge questioned his mother's sincerity. In the end, he chose to believe her. Reaching out for her hand, he finally gave her the forgiveness she so desperately had been craving. \n\n\nMeanwhile, at Brooke's, Brooke kissed Nick and admitted she was glad they had rushed back to check on Ridge. Brooke thought Stephanie was right about how crucial it was for Ridge to see her. She told Nick she knew she had made a difference in his recovery. Nick was afraid that Brooke was starting to fall for Stephanie's pitch. Nick told her that he was glad Ridge was recovering, but he did not want Brooke to be a part of Stephanie's schemes. \n\n\nBrooke wanted to believe in Stephanie's sincerity but had her doubts as well. Not willing to understand how important Stephanie's acceptance had always been to Brooke, Nick glibly said it didn't matter either way. Becoming jealous, he asked her if she wanted to be part of the Forrester family again. Brooke reassured Nick that she wanted to be with him. She told him that he was her future, and they kissed.\n\n\n",
