After a short visit, Katherine arrived and took R.J. for his regular routine of the day, giving Brooke and Ridge time to talk. Ridge asked Brooke why she was there. She told him that she loved him and always would. She was concerned about him and his health. \n\n\nRidge mentioned that he had been given a second chance, and Brooke said that he should take advantage of the opportunity and make the best of it. He changed the subject for a moment and asked Brooke if she believed everything that his mother had said to her. He told her that he was having a hard time with it and also wanted to know what her feelings were. He realized that no matter what happened, he could not have her and considered that it was all his fault. \n\n\nJackie and Nick talked at her boutique. Jackie was concerned for her son and Brooke. She knew how vulnerable Brooke was when it pertained to Stephanie. Nick offered a suggestion. She suggested that perhaps Brooke could work with her in some capacity. Jackie wondered if she would really like to do that, and as Brooke walked in the door, Nick told Jackie to ask Brooke herself. \n\n\nJackie talked about her boutiques and the opening of new ones. She would like to have more time to do that and asked if it were possible that perhaps Brooke would like to work alongside her. Brooke thanked Jackie for the offer, which Jackie told her was an open one, but turned it down as she just wasn't up for it yet. \n\n\nWhile Jackie spoke with Nick, Brooke received a cell phone call from Stephanie. Stephanie was holding a press conference because of Ridge; the public wanted to know how he was doing, and the family would like her there, attending and giving her support. At first, she said no, it wasn't really a good idea, but Eric jumped on the phone and told her that they really needed her there. She finally told him that she would attend. \n\n\nStephanie was getting ready for her press conference, but first she needed to speak with Eric and Thorne. She told them that she was thinking about taking Brooke back aboard as CEO. They look at her strangely, wondering what she was planning. She told them that she wanted to do whatever she could for her son. That included eating crow and getting Brooke back into his life. \n\n\nEric asked Stephanie how Ridge and Brooke felt about what was being offered, and she replied that they didn't know yet. Eric tried to refresh her memory by reminding her that should Brooke return, she would probably return all the things that Stephanie had hated before. Stephanie told Eric that she realized that, but she also realized that Brooke made money for the company. Stephanie said that she had been wrong. \n\n\nStephanie said she would like to have Eric and Thorne's support of her idea. They looked at each other, and Eric okayed it. Thorne said that if his dad was crazy enough to go along with it, then he would also.\n\n\n",
