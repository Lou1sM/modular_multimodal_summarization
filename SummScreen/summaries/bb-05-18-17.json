    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke took a call from Bill, who was dressed in a tuxedo at the house he said would soon be theirs. The house was decked out for the wedding, and Bill asked if Brooke was going to get ready at Katie's house. Brooke said she was still at work because \"something\" had developed. Bill told her to hurry up because he was ready to make her his bride.\n\n\nAfter the call, Ridge asked Brooke not to make her decision based upon Bill's disappointment. Ridge said that a love as intense as the one he and Brooke shared didn't just disappear. He promised that his latest screwup would be his last. Ridge planned to wait for her at her house. He hoped that she'd meet him, and they'd pledge vows to each other. Brooke walked out of the office without saying anything.\n\n\nRidge called Pam on her cell phone to let her know he'd be gone the rest of the day. Quinn entered, and he told her the same thing. She asked what was going on. Ridge said he was going to Brooke's house, and if all went well, he and Brooke would get married.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Ridge thought it would really happen. She noted that Brooke was set to marry Bill that day. Ridge recalled that Quinn had spent time with Brooke and asked what Quinn thought Brooke would do. Quinn replied that Brooke had kept turning the topic to Quinn. Ridge pressed for details, and Quinn said Brooke had asked what Quinn would do if she were in Brooke's position, caught between two men.\n\n\nRidge figured he'd won that round because Quinn couldn't stomach Bill. Quinn said Brooke had also asked how Quinn would feel about the marriage. Quinn conveyed that she'd told Brooke that it wouldn't bother her. Quinn added that she'd had to remind Brooke that whatever had been between Quinn and Ridge was over.\n\n\nRidge said he'd told Brooke the same thing, and he thought she'd actually believed him that time. Ridge didn't discount Brooke's relationship with Bill, but Ridge felt that Brooke would be with him if he hadn't screwed up. He knew that what had happened between him and Quinn could cost him Brooke, but he was still going to Brooke's house. He hoped she'd show up, and if she did, they'd start their life together.\n\n\nIn the design office later, Ivy was trying to work on something with Quinn, but Quinn got up in the middle of it and called Bill. She wanted to know if the wedding had started yet. Bill asked what it was to her and told her that she wasn't getting a wedding invitation. Quinn knew they weren't besties and said she wasn't expecting an invitation. She remarked that Bill had proven his love for Brooke time and again. \"Thanks?\" Bill quizzically replied.\n\n\nBill stated that it was true, and Ridge had done nothing but let Brooke down. Bill wondered if Quinn knew what Ridge had done in Australia. Quinn said she didn't and asked why she would. Bill figured that Eric had told her. She replied that Eric knew as much as Bill. Bill conveyed that he intended to find out what it was. Quinn advised him to focus on marrying Brooke, especially with Ridge putting on the full-court press.\n\n\nBill asked what Quinn was talking about. She revealed that Ridge had been with Brooke earlier, and Quinn believed that Ridge wasn't giving up on Brooke. Bill asked why Quinn would tell him that. Quinn claimed that Bill and Brooke had overcome a lot to be together, just like Eric and Quinn had.\n\n\nQuinn started to say that Ridge might sway Brooke with history, but Bill cut Quinn off. He said Ridge's ploys wouldn't work. Bill asked if Ridge and Brooke were together at that moment. Quinn said they weren't. Bill wasn't surprised. He insisted that Brooke knew who she wanted, and there wasn't \"a damn thing\" Ridge could do to stop the wedding.\n\n\nAfter the call, Quinn busied herself with work, but Ivy, who'd found the call hard to ignore, asked if Quinn thought Brooke might really marry Ridge. Quinn murmured that she didn't know. Ivy asked if Quinn would care if Brooke did marry Ridge. In Quinn's silence, Ivy asked why Quinn would care if the thing between Quinn and Ridge had ended -- even if it had cost Ridge a marriage with Brooke. Ivy asked if Ridge might have gotten through to Brooke.\n\n\n\"Can we not do this? We have a lot of work to do,\" Quinn replied. Ivy apologized and left to get some supplies. Quinn removed her glasses and flashed back to memories with Ridge, starting with them standing on the runway together and ending with the kiss in Australia.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Ridge arrived. As he waited, he flashed back to revealing himself to Brooke at her fountain staircase.\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Brooke rushed in, apologizing for being late. She revealed that she'd been talking with Ridge. Katie relayed that she knew Ridge wasn't giving up on Brooke. Katie asked what was going on. Brooke asserted that she was getting married, and she was glad her little sister was helping her touch up her hair and makeup.\n\n\nBrooke asked how Katie thought Brooke should wear her hair. Katie thought Brooke would be beautiful no matter what, but Katie figured that the groom would have an opinion -- unless Brooke had changed her mind about marrying Bill.\n\n\nKatie began helping Brooke with her hair and noted that Brooke still hadn't said what she'd do. Brooke replied that she was focusing on getting married. Katie asked whom Brooke would marry. Katie figured that Ridge had given Brooke another passionate plea, and Katie asked if it had changed things. Katie said that Brooke would put the wedding dress on, but the question was whether Brooke would marry Ridge or Bill.\n\n\nLater, Brooke concluded a call with Donna. Brooke relayed that Stephen was much better, and he relied on Donna, who planned to stay in Dallas longer. Katie said Donna might not want to be in the middle of things as she'd been the time Ridge had shown up when Brooke had been about to marry Bill. Brooke asserted that it wouldn't happen the same way that day.\n\n\nKatie asked if it was because Brooke would marry Bill or because Brooke had told Bill that she was marrying Ridge. Brooke didn't reply. Katie said she'd seen no evidence that anything was happening with Ridge and Quinn. Katie said Ridge loved Brooke, and Brooke loved him.\n\n\nKatie stated that R.J. had been a big part of the reason Brooke hadn't married Bill before. In Brooke's silence, Katie said that Brooke was about to put on the dress. She asked what Brooke would do. Brooke stared at the sword ring on her finger.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Wyatt, Liam, and Justin had arrived, and Liam noted that Bill was becoming a pro at throwing weddings on the fly. Wyatt and Liam made jokes about Bill's numerous wedding plans, and Bill threatened to kick them out of his will. Bill said that Brooke would get ready at Katie's house, but Brooke was still at the office. Liam and Wyatt guessed that Ridge was making a last-minute pitch, but Justin wondered if Ridge was planning to crash the wedding.\n\n\nWyatt asked when the minister would get there. Liam wondered if Bill had remembered to hire one. Bill pretended that he had forgotten but then revealed that Justin would officiate the wedding. Justin said anyone could be commissioner for a day in California with the proper paperwork.\n\n\nWyatt asked about vows, and Liam got nervous when Bill said he'd just speak from the heart. Bill told his son to listen and learn because he wasn't all talk and no follow-through like Ridge. Bill was confident that Brooke knew she could trust him to support her, and that was his vow -- to love her, support her, and stand by her side until one of them croaked.\n\n\nLiam said it was impressive. Wyatt agreed that it had sounded good until the croaking part. Justin said no one could compare or measure up to Dollar Bill. Bill added that Brooke knew it. He asserted that Ridge had had his chance and would never get another with Brooke.\n\n\nLater, the men stood around, drinking Champagne, and Wyatt said he didn't get why Quinn had called Bill. Liam guessed it was to stir up trouble. Wyatt reasoned that his mother might want Bill to have a courtesy heads-up. Justin told Bill that Bill would not go to Brooke's house to get into it with Ridge. Bill said Ridge just wanted to trot out of the old tripe about destiny, but it was bull. \"Brooke's destiny is with me,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house and at Bill's house, the front doors started to open. Ridge stared at the door and said, \"Logan?\" At the same time, Bill looked at his door and said, \"Brooke?\"\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Liam, Wyatt and Justin arrive at Bill's Bel Air home where caterers are bustling to set up the wedding. Quinn reassures Ivy that she and Ridge are over. Quinn then gives Bill a call trying to plant seeds of doubt about Brooke's commitment to him. Ridge urges Brooke to reconsider marrying Bill and to meet him later at home to start their life together. Brooke leaves to get her hair done by Katie. Katie cannot help but question her sister about which man she plans to marry when she walks down the aisle. Quinn and Ridge regretfully discuss how what happened between them could cost him a life with Brooke. Ridge hopes that he managed to get through to his \"Logan\". Did he?",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill calls his future bride and tells her he is overseeing the caterers and florists and everything is beautiful. He tells her to forget everything else and get over there to be his bride. Ridge is still there and he tells her they have a history and he knows he screwed up, but ..that was his last. He will go to her house and wait for her. He tells his secretary that he needs the rest of the day off; Steffy can handle anything. Quinn comes in and he tells her the same thing. He is going home and hopes to be married today. Quinn relays her conversation with Brooke and she reminded Brooke that whatever they had was over. Ridge says he realizes what they did could cost him Brooke but he is going to her house and hopes to change her mind. Liam and Wyatt come in and make some funnies and Bill tells Justin to write it up; they are out of his will. He tells them they can believe not only in his vows but actions, unlike Forrester who is all talk but no follow through. Ridge had his chance and he blew it. He will not get another. Katie helps Brooke get ready but wants to be sure that she is really going through with this. When she puts that dress on she could marry either Ridge or Bill. Ivy finds that Quinn is distracted. Quinn calls Bill and says she guesses the ceremony has not started yet. He wonders why she even cares as they are not besties. Bill says he does not know what happened with Ridge but he intends to find out why Brooke walked out on him. Quinn confides that Ridge is still thinking in those terms and she hopes he does not pull something. Bill tells her that Brooke knows who she wants and it is him. There is not a damn thing Ridge can do to stop it. Katie tells Brooke it is her life and she will support whatever she does. And she admits all she sees is Quinn's devotion to Eric and nothing now between her and Ridge. So it is up to Brooke who she marries \u0096 Ridge or Bill. Ivy tells Quinn that she could not help but overhear her conversation with Bill and she supposes it is possible that Brooke could change her mind. Quinn starts thinking of those sexy moments with Ridge ..kissing and in the steam room. Ridge thinks about his moments with Brooke. Wyatt doesn't get it why his mom would call Bill about Ridge's full on press of Brooke. Bill says it is a bunch of bull, all that history and destiny. Her destiny is with him. The door opens and Bill expects Brooke to walk through but no one is there.",
