    "tvmega_recap": "Prior to the press conference, Sally assures Stephanie that word of her big announcement to make Brooke CEO of Forrester, hasn't leaked to the press. When Felicia arrives she blasts Steph over her threat to have Dante deported. Felicia tells her that she and Dante will make the decisions for their son and tells Steph to back off ! Ridge is released from the hospital and is surprised when Eric tells him that Brooke will be attending the press conference. At Jackie's boutique, Nick tells Brooke that he cannot attend the press conference because of a conference call. Brooke tells him that she can handle it, and she will announce to the press her resignation from the company. When they leave Jackie makes a frantic phone call to Stephen, who is as concerned as she is about what Steph may be up to. The two decide to crash the press conference. At Marone, Nick is surprised to see Taylor, who has stopped by to accept his offer to set up counseling for his stressed employees. Nick and Taylor discuss what Stephanie may be up to with Brooke. At Forrester, Brooke is flooded with memories of her times at the company when she is interrupted by Stephanie. Brooke is reluctant to stay, but Steph tells her that it will be worth her while. When the press conference begins, Stephanie is concerned that she can't find Brooke, however she praises Brooke's contributions and spotting her in the back of the room, asks her to come on stage. Brooke is delighted by a slide show tribute (narrated by Stephanie no less !) to her career at Forrester. Jackie calls Nick from the press conference and tells him to turn it on ! As Taylor and Nick watch in disbelief, Stephanie not only asks Brooke to become CEO, but gives her 50% of the Forrester stock. Brooke is speechless as Stephanie takes her in her arms and says WELCOME TO THE FAMILY !!!",
