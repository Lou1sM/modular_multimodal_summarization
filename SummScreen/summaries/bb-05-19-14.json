    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the workout area at Forrester, the steam room temperature reached one hundred thirty-five degrees, and Liam banged on the door, screaming that he couldn't breathe. Fiddling with her necklace, Quinn listened with satisfaction. After a few moments, she frowned and unbarred the door.\n\n\nLiam stumbled out, and breathlessly, he accused Quinn of locking him in the steam room and turning up the heat. Quinn fessed up to being guilty as charged, but she said Liam had been breaking the ground rules by getting naked in the steam room. \"Do I look naked to you?\" he screamed.\n\n\nLiam figured out that Quinn had intercepted his message to Hope, and Quinn said she refused to let him get between Wyatt and Hope. Liam guessed that Quinn would do anything, even lock him in a steam room to die. Quinn called him a wuss and said Hope would wind up with Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam rasped that no woman on the planet would want a mother-in-law like Quinn or a user like Wyatt. Liam warned that if she pulled another stunt, he'd press charges. He yelled that she was wrong to think she'd intimidate him into walking away from the woman he loved.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Bill said he'd planned to propose later that evening, but Brooke had arrived looking so beautiful that he'd had to do it at that moment. Brooke stated that he'd been so loyal to her that the least she could do was to commit to him for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nBrooke found Bill to be full of surprises. The trip sounded amazing to Brooke, but she said they didn't have to go. She was content to remain at home -- as long as they were together.\n\n\nBill decided to order some champagne to toast his bride, but Brooke remembered that she had a meeting at Forrester. Bill told her to blow it off, but she said it wouldn't be good for her new position. She also wanted to announce to everyone that she was engaged before Ridge heard about it from somebody else \"That somebody being me,\" Bill responded.\n\n\nBrooke was sure Bill wanted to tell Ridge about it because of the conversation the men had had. Bill agreed, but he decided that, in the spirit of unity and harmony between the two families, he'd let Brooke do it. He thanked her for agreeing to marry him and remarked that a man was at his most vulnerable when proposing. Brooke couldn't believe he'd doubt her answer and said she'd never trusted anyone the way she trusted Bill.\n\n\nBrooke left, and Liam stormed into Bill's office, declaring that Bill's ex was certifiable. Bill was shocked to hear that Katie had locked Liam in a steam room, but Liam clarified that he'd meant Quinn. Bill asked Liam to calm down and say exactly what had happened. Liam decided that he wouldn't get into it. He didn't want to let that \"psychopath\" get into his head.\n\n\nLiam said he'd put Quinn on notice about her stunts, and Bill needed to do the same. Liam ordered Bill to tell Quinn to hand over the selfie, or else. Bill decided that he wouldn't let that \"nut job\" ruin his special day or get inside his head, either.\n\n\nLiam became curious, and Bill revealed that he'd told Brooke about the trip. Because Brooke had loved the trip idea and loved Bill for planning it, Bill had gone a step further. Liam asked what Bill had done, and Bill announced that he'd proposed. Bill said he and Brooke were engaged, and Liam hugged Bill.\n\n\nLiam was happy for Bill, who said that nothing was standing in his and Brooke's way. Liam replied that Quinn's infamous picture wouldn't either. Bill stated that he and Liam knew that Quinn was \"off the beam,\" but she was smart enough not to push Bill.\n\n\nLiam asked about Ridge, and Bill replied that, though he didn't like Ridge, the boys and Brooke and Katie's issues were more important things to concentrate on. Bill figured that if Ridge was the sensitive man that he purported to be, then Ridge would deal with it and be happy for Brooke.\n\n\nIn the Forrester's CEO's office, the staff prepared for a meeting. The group noted that Quinn and Brooke weren't present. Hope said Brooke had been called away, and Ridge asked if it had been about R.J. Hope relayed that it hadn't been. \"So what does Spencer want now?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nEveryone agreed to focus on business and fill Brooke in later, but Ridge quipped that they could if Spencer would let Brooke go. Caroline doubted Bill was holding Brooke hostage. Donna said Ridge was sweet to worry about Brooke, but Donna was sure Brooke was okay. Hope added that Brooke knew what she was doing, and Ridge asked when Hope had started singing Bill's praises.\n\n\nRick drew everyone's attention back to the meeting, and as it continued, Ridge was preoccupied. Rick asked for Ridge's input about something, but Ridge hopped up, murmuring that he needed to go. Right after Ridge had left, Quinn rushed in and took his seat. She claimed that she'd gotten distracted with another matter, but it was taken care of. Wyatt flashed a quizzical look at her.\n\n\nLater, Brooke arrived, and Caroline wondered what was different about Brooke. \"Oh, my God...\" Donna said, grabbing Brooke's left hand. Brooke announced that she and Bill were engaged. As everyone gathered around Brooke and chattered, Quinn scowled.\n\n\nCaroline snapped cell phone pictures as Brooke explained how a romantic trip plan had turned into a marriage proposal. Quinn glanced at the incriminating photo on her phone. Donna noted that Bill had used the same ring, and Wyatt asked if Quinn would congratulate the bride. \"No,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nThe onlookers appeared confused, but Quinn stated that congratulations were meant for the groom. She hoped that Brooke's wedding would be picture perfect. Donna and Maya left to get champagne, and Hope asked if it was what Brooke really wanted. Brooke said it was, and she couldn't imagine anything getting between her and the loyal Bill.\n\n\nThe meeting ended, and Wyatt and Hope went to Rick's office, where Wyatt asked how Hope felt about their parents' engagement. Hope wasn't thrilled about Bill, but she knew that he made her mother happy. Wyatt was concerned about how his own mother had taken the news.\n\n\nWyatt revealed that Quinn had always told him that Bill was the only one she'd ever cared for. Hope guessed it was a love-hate thing, and Wyatt replied that Quinn might have been feeling something for Bill again. \"Well, I guess that's all over now. I don't know, right?\" Wyatt asked Hope.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Brooke was alone when Ridge entered. He said he'd had to leave the meeting to take care of something. Brooke revealed that she'd been late because she'd gone to see Bill. Ridge quipped that when Bill called, Brooke went running. Brooke handed Ridge the notes from the meeting, and he saw the ring on her finger. He asked what it was, and Brooke revealed that she'd accepted Bill's marriage proposal.\n\n\nRidge asked if Brooke had lost her mind. He insisted that Bill wasn't the right man for her, but she said that Bill had been nothing but true and loyal. Ridge insisted that she deserved someone better. \"You can't really tell me that. You're engaged to Katie,\" Brooke replied.\n\n\nRidge asked if that was what Brooke's engagement was about, and Brooke replied that it was really crass of Ridge to think she'd accepted Bill's proposal because of Ridge's engagement. Ridge agreed but questioned whether Brooke was doing the right thing. Brooke insisted that she was.\n\n\nRidge told Brooke that it had gone far enough. He pulled her ring off her finger and declared that she wasn't marrying Bill Spencer.\n\n\nBack at Spencer, Bill roared at someone on the phone and slammed down the receiver. Quinn entered in a black trench coat after slipping passed his secretary. Bill rasped that he'd heard about his son's extensive steam, but Quinn dismissively replied that she wasn't there to discuss that.\n\n\nQuinn, who'd heard about Bill's engagement, said she wanted to give him an early wedding gift. She unlaced her coat and dropped it to the floor, revealing her black leather mini-skirt and top. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells Brooke that he had tonight planned, with champagne, candlelight and music, the whole bit but then she came in looking so beautiful .Brooke says and he's been so loyal and committed to her that the least she could do is say yes. She can't wait to see what he plans next. But they don't have to go on an extravagant trip; they could stay right here as long as they are together. He quips that when Bill Spencer says he is going to give her the world, he means it. Liam pounds on the door of the steam room and hollers for someone to let him out of there; he can't breathe. Quinn is nearby pretending not to notice. Donna passes out the balance sheets to Rick, Hope, Wyatt, Caroline and Maya at the meeting. Ridge rushes in and comments on another meeting. When he hears Eric is on a international phone call, he tells Rick he should be there too and he can handle this. Rick says actually no, he's learned the hard way not to turn his back on Ridge. Brooke had someplace else to be and Quinn is missing. Liam keeps pounding, getting hotter and hotter so finally Quinn removes the iron bar blocking the door and Liam flies out, all coughing and panting. He spots Quinn and knows it is her that locked him in. She says guilty. And he says she turned the temperature up. Guilty again. He tells her that she is insane. She says yeah and he had ground rules and getting naked in the steam room broke them. He realizes she also intercepted the text message to Hope. Quinn says she could not let him sabotage Hope and Wyatt's relationship. She calls him a little wuss and says he may have guilted Hope into dating both of them but she will end up with Wyatt. Liam shouts like hell she will. There is no woman on this planet that would accept her as a mother- in-law or her user of a son. He huffs and puffs and issues her a warning that next time he will press charges. He doesn't know if this is fun ad games to her or something more sinister but if she thinks she is going to intimidate him into walking always from the woman he loves, then she is wrong! Bill wants to have some champagne but Brooke has to decline. She says she is late for a meeting as they speak. And this way she will be able to tell everyone, including Ridge, about them being engaged. She knows after all Ridge has said to Bill that he would like to be the one to tell Ridge. Bill says damn right but in the spirit of peace and harmony between their almost families he will let her deliver the news. She says she had to say yes as there is no one that she trusts like him. Ridge makes a quick exit from the meeting and says he will be back. Wyatt is about to cover for Quinn when she comes in and apologizes for her tardiness. She says she had to attend to another matter that is taken care of but now she is raring to go. Liam flies through Bill's door and accuses his ex of being certifiable. He's talking loony-tunes crazy. She locked him in the FC steam room and turned up the heat. Bill is stunned; Katie locked him in the steam room. Liam says no; it was Quinn. Bill tells him to calm down and tell him what happened. Suddenly Liam says no; he is not going to let that psychopath inside his head. He has put her on notice of what will happen if she tries to pull that stunt again. So should Bill. He should make her hand over that selfie. Bill says he knows this is not funny but he's not going to let that nut job ruin his day. He's not going to let her inside his head. He tells Liam that he proposed to Brooke and she accepted. Liam gives Bill a big congratulatory hug. Brooke arrives at the meeting and it doesn't take long for Donna to realize she is flushed with excitement and she spots the ring. All congratulate her except Quinn. Wyatt has to goad her into saying something. She says usually you congratulate the groom and offer the bride best wishes, but since Brooke is not a bride yet she will just hope she will be happy and that her wedding will be picture perfect. Brooke tells Hope that Bill has been so wonderful and loyal, she can't imagine anything coming between them. Liam tells Bill finally some good news. He knows how much Bill loves Brooke so he's happy for them. Bill says it has been a long time coming but now nothing is standing in their way. Liam says especially Quinn and that infamous selfie. Bill says he made Wyatt a Spencer which he was going to do anyway. Quinn may be a lot off the beam but she knows better than to push Bill, but if she gets some squirrelly notion in her head then he will handle it. And this means that he and Forrester will be more involved in each other's lives. That doesn't thrill him but there are some things more important, RJ and Will not to mention Katie and Brooke. And if Mr. Sensitive is as supportive as he claims to be then he will deal with this too. Ridge comes back to the office and finds only Brooke. He asks if he missed much at the meeting and she says she just got there too. He accuses her of hearing from Spencer and rushing off again. He notices her ring. She says yes, Bill proposed and she accepted. Wyatt kisses Hope and they discuss their parents getting married. But he can't help but be worried abut his mom. It's the love/hate thing but she has said Bill is the only one she ever really cared for. He knows she was starting to feel that way again. Bill barks an order over the phone that he wants it by noon tomorrow. Quinn slips in. Bill tells her that he's already heard about Liam's extended steam room experience. She says she didn't come here for that. She says she did hear about his engagement to Brooke and thought she'd bring him an early wedding gift. She slips off her trench coat for a little something beneath. He says she has lost her mind. Ridge tells Brooke that she has lost her mind. She is making the biggest mistake of her life. She counters back that this is not a mistake. He must have known it would happen sooner or later. Ridge says Bill is not the right man for her; she deserves someone better. Brooke says again he's only been true and loyal and Ridge is now engaged to her sister. He thinks that is what this is about; her being upset over that. She says Bill is a wonderful person. He'll make a great husband and stepdad. Ridge says this has gone too far. He grabs her finger and takes off the ring and says she is not going to marry Bill Spencer.",
