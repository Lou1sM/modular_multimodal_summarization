Maya confessed that Brooke, Eric, Ridge, Carter, and Nicole all knew. Rick was shocked.\n\n\nMaya tried to explain that it had all started with Nicole, who had initially threatened her. Maya explained that Carter had found out and told Ridge -- who had told Rick's parents. Rick freaked out that so many people knew. \"How could you let this happen?\" Rick asked. He worried that he was an office joke. Rick worried that Ridge would lord it over him.\n\n\nRick worried that his mother had insisted that Maya tell Rick the truth, but Maya explained that Brooke had known Maya had planned to tell Rick that night. Maya wanted to do something to help, and she picked up her phone, but Rick told her not to look at her phone. Maya was shocked at the headlines.\n\n\nRick's phone started to beep with a multitude of text and media messages. Rick was in shock too. Maya looked concerned. She predicted it would not be as bad as it seemed, but Rick was skeptical. Rick said that he would get Carter to force Bill Spencer to remove the stories.\n\n\nRick added that half the world was asleep. The eastern US and the rest of the world might never see the stories. Rick promised to take care of it. \"I'll take care of it. I'll take care of us,\" Rick promised.\n\n\nRick called Bill Spencer and appealed to Bill to remove the articles. Rick didn't want Bill to destroy Rick's and Maya's lives. Bill scoffed and advised that Rick had mistreated everyone at Forrester. He was getting what he deserved. Bill hung up, and Rick worried.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge met with Eric and Brooke, and they looked at the online articles about Maya. They maintained it would be a nightmare in the media. The phone started ringing, and Ridge was furious that Bill Spencer was trying to humiliate them.\n\n\nBrooke claimed she would talk to Bill, but Nick entered and wondered what had happened. Nick reminded them that he had expected Ridge to keep his promise to keep the news in the family. Nicole entered and blamed Ridge for the news outbreak, but Brooke chimed in that they all knew who had spoken to the media.\n\n\nAll eyes were on Nicole, and Ridge asked if she had a guilty conscience. Nicole responded that Wyatt wouldn't have said anything. Nick responded that Wyatt had had no business hearing Maya's story.\n\n\nNick marveled that Nicole had shared Maya's story without her permission or knowledge. \"Maya didn't get a voice or a vote,\" he said.\n\n\nNick reminded Nicole that transgender women had been murdered when they had been outed. Brooke understood because she had seen it in the news, and Nick noted that it had never been a problem that would have caught the attention of anyone at Forrester because it didn't affect them.\n\n\nEric took a call from Rick, and Rick blamed Ridge for the publicity. Eric defended Ridge and added that they knew who had shared the news with Spencer. Rick maintained that he loved Maya, and Eric understood. Rick said he would force Bill to take down the stories to protect Forrester, but Eric doubted that Bill would budge.\n\n\nRick promised that he would handle it. Eric voiced his encouragement and faith in Rick. Rick vowed to rise above the scandal, humiliation, and mockery because he had done it countless times. Maya overheard Rick, and she looked disappointed.\n\n\nRick promised his father that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to keep Forrester's image untarnished. \"I swear it,\" Rick said. Eric maintained that he was worried about Rick -- not the company. Rick promised to take care of things.\n\n\nRick and Eric hung up, and Brooke asked how Rick had sounded. Nicole voiced that it was Maya she was worried about -- not Rick. Nicole worried that she had made a mistake and hurt her sister. \"I never meant to hurt her,\" Nicole said. Nick noted that it could have all been prevented. \"She'll never forgive me. I lost my sister all over again,\" Nicole said. Nick said he had an idea.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie entered Bill's office and chastised him for sharing Maya's story publicly. Bill defended himself and said that he made choices to protect his business and his family.\n\n\n\"Rick is my family,\" Katie shouted. Bill scoffed and said that Rick had made his bed and needed to have his girlfriend keep him warm in it. Bill reminded Katie of what Rick had done to his niece, but Katie fired back that Caroline could handle herself. Bill promised to run his business as he saw fit.\n\n\nBill and Katie continued to argue. Katie said that Bill needed to remember to do the right thing at times, even if it meant he would make less money. Bill scoffed, but Katie reminded him that he had held Maya up to public ridicule. Bill called Katie a hypocrite.\n\n\nBill's phone rang, and Eric had called. Bill feigned that it was good to her from him. Eric reminded Bill that an organization called GLAAD would be happy to hear the news about Maya, but they would also be vocal about the way Bill had shared the news. Bill promised to let the public decide how they liked it. Eric reminded Bill that his sister, Karen, was a huge supporter of GLAAD and one if its largest donors. Bill sighed and hung up.\n\n\nAt Big Bear, Maya worried that things were getting worse. Rick promised to call Carter and get a court order that prevented Bill Spencer from sharing the stories. Rick wanted to get out of the public eye. Maya announced that she was not ashamed. Rick looked at the Spencer articles that were headlined \"Uncanny Tranny\" and \"Mama Maya.\" \"Such an embarrassment,\" Rick shouted.\n\n\nMaya was hurt. She took her stuff and left, but Rick followed her. He advised that it was hard for him to deal with the information. He begged her not to leave. Maya drove off, and Rick followed her in his car.\n\n\nOn the back roads, Rick honked at Maya and called her repeatedly on his phone. Maya finally answered, and Rick begged her to pull over, but Maya sobbed. She pleaded with Rick to tell her that he still loved her and wanted to marry her. She didn't want him to be embarrassed by her. Maya didn't hear an answer then the line went dead. Maya cried harder because she thought Rick had rejected her, but she didn't realize that Rick's car had crashed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "All hell breaks loose as more see the bit on the internet about Maya being born a Myron. Brooke can not believe Ridge would do this. Ridge comes in and suspects Bill and Brooke then wants to go talk to Bill. Katie rails to Bill that this is her family; how could he? Nick walks back in after hearing it on his radio. Nicole comes in and admits that she told Wyatt after he told her he would not mention it to anyone. She came to town and pushed Maya to tell her secret but she did not mean to harm her in any way. They are all up in arms what to do now. Rick calls his dad and says he has run into a problem. Eric says they have all heard. Rick tells Eric that he loves Maya and they will work through this. He's going to do all in his power that FC stays intact. And swears they will get through this untarnished. Eric says he knows he will; he just wants him to be okay. Rick calls Bill and reads him the riot act and demands that he re-tract this about Maya. Bill informs him that he runs his company the way he chooses just as Rick does FC. Maya tells Rick that she spent too many years being ashamed and she is not going back there now. She needs to know that he is in her corner. Rick says he is but this is so humiliating. Katie blasts at Bill and says she loves him and she expects him to do the right thing but he is making her so mad now. Holding Maya up to public ridicule will never be right \u0096 never. Maya starts the car up and says she is leaving despite Rick chasing after her and trying to stop her. In another car on a long stretch of lonely road, Rick gets closer and Maya puts her foot to the medal. Eric calls Bill and Bill is sarcastic when he asks how he might help him at this hour. Eric says he thinks Bill has done enough. Eric tells Bill that he might ask Karen, his sister, who is one of GLAAD's biggest contributors. They might have an issue with Bill's publications spewing all of this ugliness. Nicole tells the others that Maya will never forgive her now. Rick is right on Maya's tail and calls her on the cell; she turns it off. He calls again and she answers. He tells her to turn off at the next exit and they can work this out. He asked her to marry him tonight and nothing has changed. She says a lot has changed and she desperately needs to hear him say that he still wants to marry her now. Time runs out and the call is ended. Rick's car ends up smashed against a tree and he is unconscious trapped inside.",
