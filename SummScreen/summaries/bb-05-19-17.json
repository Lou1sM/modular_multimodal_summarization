Nicole couldn't help being excited about being parents, and she said she'd loved being pregnant. Zende was sorry he'd missed a lot of the pregnancy. She believed it would be different the next time.\n\n\nNicole was anxious to get pregnant. She loved their life as it was but felt that a baby would make it better. Zende reminded her that they couldn't rush it. She replied that there was no harm in checking. She revealed that she had a pregnancy test with her and excitedly told Zende, \"This could be it!\"\n\n\nLater, Zende sat behind the desk with Lizzy. They played as Nicole entered the room. She announced that she wasn't pregnant. Zende said that it was okay, but she replied that she'd been hoping. Nicole noted how cute Zende and Lizzy were together, and she believed he'd be an amazing father. Nicole said they could have a whole house full of kids or just one. All she knew was that she wanted to get their family started.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Ridge was surprised when Quinn walked through the front door instead of Brooke. Quinn advised Ridge that Brooke wouldn't be there. Quinn had just gotten a message from Wyatt that Brooke had arrived at the wedding. Ridge exclaimed that Brooke couldn't do it, and there was still time. Quinn replied that time was up.\n\n\nRidge said he'd let R.J. down about putting their family back together. Quinn reasoned that they were still a family, and the mature R.J. would be fine. Ridge concluded that the love of his life was marrying another man because he'd had to keep playing games. He'd played games with his father's wife, and he'd lost Brooke as a result.\n\n\nRidge didn't blame Quinn. He blamed himself. He noted that Bill had always been there for Brooke, who hadn't had to question Bill's loyalty or who Bill was. Ridge didn't know himself anymore. He'd thought he was a knight in shining armor, but he'd figured out that he was an insecure man who needed every woman to love and adore him.\n\n\nRidge said Brooke had grown up, leaving him with another failed relationship. Quinn felt that Brooke just hadn't listened to him. Ridge responded that Logan had heard him; she just no longer understood him. He said that if Logan couldn't understand him, no woman could. Quinn replied that she could.\n\n\nQuinn called herself an expert as self-sabotaging. She reminded Ridge that they were alike, but her luck had changed when she'd married Eric. Ridge replied that he'd been hoping that his luck would change that day. Quinn conveyed her belief that there was a woman out there for him. She said the woman might accept his flaws and might not need him to be perfect or to be her savior.\n\n\nRidge wanted to be left alone and said Quinn should go. Quinn walked toward the door, and he sat on the couch with his head bowed. Before exiting the house, Quinn stopped by the sofa's armrest and stroked Ridge's hair. After she'd gone, Ridge glanced around sadly.\n\n\nAlone, Ridge flashed back on his times with Brooke since his return from Paris. He stared around the empty room and sighed.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Brooke arrived in a white sheath gown, and the men awaiting her complimented her on how stunning she looked. It was amazing to Wyatt how happy Brooke and Bill were. Liam didn't think they could thank Brooke enough for the joy she'd given Bill. Brooke said he'd done even more for her.\n\n\nMaya and Rick arrived. Bill said that everyone was there, and they could get started. Rick asked if they were it for guests. Brooke explained that they'd wanted to keep it small and intimate. Justin asked the bride and groom to join him in front of the fireplace. The guests took their seats, and Justin welcomed them to the wedding.\n\n\nJustin thanked Brooke for making Bill happier than Justin had ever seen. Justin also had never seen Bill more eager to close the deal. Justin asked if there were any objections to the wedding. Maya wanted to say something but assured them all that it wasn't an objection.\n\n\nStanding up, Maya advised the bride and groom to never forget what had gotten them to that point. She assumed everyone knew that marriage wasn't as perfect as the first day and said that, when there were tough times, the couple should remember how hard they'd worked to get to that point. She asked them to never stop trying to win each other's hearts.\n\n\nWyatt spoke next. He said everyone knew what the day meant, and it meant a lot to the guests, too. Wyatt said they'd watched Brooke and Bill exert determination to get to that moment, and Wyatt was happy to witness it.\n\n\nLiam stood and said he'd prepared a sonnet called \"Father.\" Bill glared at Liam, and Liam said he was kidding. Liam decided that he wouldn't talk about how long it had taken to get to that moment. \"You're here now because you're ready now,\" Liam stated. He was happy to see Brooke by his father's side. He wished them a long and happy future together.\n\n\nRick was determined to be the one to make his mother cry. He stood and said he hadn't always appreciated how courageous of an act it was for his mother to constantly follow her heart. Taking Maya's hand, Rick said he finally understood it. He thanked his mother for teaching him to follow his heart and said the couple had his blessing and support.\n\n\nAs the guests looked on, Justin prompted Brooke and Bill to exchange vows. Brooke couldn't believe they were there. She said that Bill had given her a sense of strength and courage. Touching his necklace, she said, \"A sense of stability.\" She felt that he was the guy for her, and she could count on him. She vowed to love him as fearlessly and ferociously as he loved her. \"For the rest of my life, I am yours,\" she said.\n\n\nBill stated that they weren't there because of him; they were there because of Brooke and what she meant to him. Bill couldn't imagine his life without Brooke, and she was the air that he breathed. He said he'd cherish her and take on the world with her. He vowed to love and be there for her for forever and a day.\n\n\nJustin produced the rings and asked the couple to wear them as symbols of their unending love and commitment to each other. After Bill and Brooke had put the rings on each other's fingers, Justin pronounced them husband and wife.\n\n\nJustin instructed Bill to kiss the bride. Everyone cheered as Justin presented \"Mr. and Mrs. Dollar Bill Spencer.\"\n\n\n",
