    "soap_central": "\n\nRick was woozy and heard the muffled voices of Brooke, Eric, and the doctor. They discussed how lucky Rick was to have survived the car crash. Rick opened his eyes. He was in his bedroom at the Forrester mansion, and he asked about Maya. \"Is she here?\" Rick asked in a panic.\n\n\nRick continued to quiz Eric and Brooke, who tried to calm him down. Rick maintained that he had to see Maya. He had to talk to her. She had been ahead of him on the road from Big Bear.\n\n\nThe doctor told Rick that he was lucky he hadn't sustained a head injury. The doctor suggested that Rick relax and take care of himself first. The doctor left, and Brooke insisted that Rick calm down. Rick wanted to call Maya, but Brooke reminded Rick that Maya had lied to him.\n\n\nRick argued that Maya had not been clear about some things, but there were no lies. He insisted that he still loved her, and he tried to get out of bed, but his ribs hurt. Brooke ordered Rick to stay in bed.\n\n\nBrooke said there would be no more discussion until Rick got some rest. Rick said he had offended Maya and hadn't meant to do it. He realized that what he'd said to Bill and his dad had upset her. Rick wanted a phone. Brooke refused and told Rick that Maya could wait.\n\n\nRick blamed Bill for the publicity and Ridge because Ridge had known, but Brooke and Eric said that no one had wanted to tell Rick because that had been up to Maya. Brooke reiterated that Rick needed to rethink his feelings.\n\n\nBrooke said that Maya should have told Rick before he'd made her the face of the company. Rick said he still wanted to marry Maya. Rick shook his head that everybody had been talking behind his back. Ridge and Carter had issued cryptic warnings. \"I didn't know Maya -- they kept saying,\" Rick said. Brooke and Eric told Rick to get some rest. They promised to spend the night, and they went downstairs.\n\n\nIn her old apartment Maya was in tears, and she typed a letter of resignation on a laptop computer. She recalled Rick's words about how he would handle the scandal, humiliation, and mockery because he had done it countless times before. She remembered he had called it a disaster.\n\n\nA knock on Maya's door interrupted her thoughts. Nicole entered, and Maya was glad that Nicole had found the apartment. Nicole asked why Maya was there. Maya explained that it was where she had lived before. \"This is where I live now,\" she said. Nicole sat down and hugged her sister. \"It was my fault,\" Nicole said. She explained that she had told Wyatt about Maya.\n\n\nMaya was shocked. She scolded Nicole for telling the biggest publisher in the industry and reminded her sister that Nicole had tried to dissuade Maya from telling the man she loved, but Nicole had told a perfect stranger. \"Please believe me. I didn't want to hurt you,\" Nicole cried.\n\n\nMaya said it wasn't all Nicole's fault. Maya admitted she should have handled it differently.\n\n\nNicole assumed that Rick had walked out on Maya, but Maya said that she had been the one to walk out. Maya admitted that Rick had proposed, and it had been the \"most beautiful, romantic moment\" of her life, and she'd wanted to say yes, but she hadn't been able to until she'd told Rick the truth.\n\n\nMaya shared that Rick had been shocked and disappointed that she hadn't told him sooner. \"He still loved me,\" Maya said. Nicole wondered what had gone wrong.\n\n\nMaya explained that Rick had been upset that Brooke, Eric, Carter, and Ridge had all known before she'd told Rick. Then Rick's phone had lit up with all the stories that had appeared online, and Rick had called his father, but the conversation had been about how much shame and embarrassment the news had caused at Forrester. \"I wasn't gonna sit there and listen to that,\" Maya said.\n\n\nMaya lamented that she and Rick could have handled everything, but the media fallout and press backlash had put his career, his business, and his family in a horrible situation. Maya added that she had resigned from Forrester.\n\n\nNicole was surprised. \"You can't quit,\" she said. Maya said that she had to because Rick needed someone he could trust and rely on. Nicole maintained that Forrester could endure a little bad press, but Maya disagreed. \"Rick is a good man, but this is bigger than us,\" she said.\n\n\nNicole asked what had happened to end the relationship. Maya explained that she had left the cabin and driven home in her car, and Rick had followed her. He had called her repeatedly on her cell phone, and when Maya had finally answered, she'd asked if he'd still wanted to marry her, but he'd hung up. \n\n\nMaya lamented that Rick would have accepted her if she had told him before anyone else had found out -- especially Ridge. Nicole asked if Maya had checked her phone to see if Rick had called, and Maya said she'd turned it off because she'd received so many media calls.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Pam lamented that every tabloid had news that Maya was transgender. Ridge said Bill was taking advantage of it. Pam said that Charlie had predicted that Maya was transgender, but she hadn't believed him. Ridge was surprised that Charlie had known, but Pam explained that Charlie hadn't heard it from anyone. He had just known.\n\n\nJake entered with the email Maya had sent to HR -- her resignation. He asked if he should forward it to Rick or Eric, but Ridge stepped in. \"I'll take care of it.\" Ridge said.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Brooke and Eric sat in the living room and stared at the portrait of Maya. Brooke said that Maya should have told Rick sooner. \"She let him down just like Amber and Caroline -- every other woman in Rick's life,\" Brooke said. She wondered where Maya was -- she should have been with Rick.\n\n\nEric defended Maya. He said she probably felt unwelcome, and she might not have known about Rick's accident. Brooke reiterated that she hoped Rick would take some time to rethink his feelings.\n\n\nEric and Brooke talked, and the front door opened. Ridge entered, and he overheard them, but he slipped past them, unnoticed. He headed straight upstairs to see Rick. Ridge asked Rick what he wanted to do about the press, and Rick said that Forrester did not respond to negative publicity.\n\n\nRidge said he had some other news, and he handed Maya's resignation letter to Rick. \"No, no, no, she can't do this,\" Rick exclaimed. Ridge offered to help. He said that Rick was clearly tied up with personal problems. \"Then I will take over,\" Ridge offered. Rick knew that Ridge would take advantage of the situation.\n\n\nRidge laid into Rick. He accused Rick of being arrogant when he had taken up with Maya. Ridge shouted that Rick had tried to make Maya the next Forrester matriarch and had even put her painting up in the mansion.\n\n\nRidge accused Rick of freaking out on Maya just like he had with Caroline. \"You snapped. You lost it like you always lose it,\" Ridge said. Ridge berated Rick. \"You brought this on yourself,\" Ridge said. He walked out of the room, and Rick, in severe pain, jumped out of bed and chased after Ridge.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick wakes up in bed and is desperate to find Maya. Eric thanks Scott for being near the crash and bringing him home. Rick rambles that he has to speak to Maya to explain. He can handle all the humiliation, mockery and scandal. He has been through it many times and he knows this may seem like a disaster in the short term but he swears to his dad that he will bring the company through this somehow untarnished. He keeps wanting to get out of bed and to find Maya. Eric tells him to please rest and do as the doctor says. He is lucky he did not have a head injury. Brooke too has to restrain him. Rick says he must explain, he remembers things he said to her. Brooke says she knows but Maya lied to him and kept things from him. Rick insists Maya did not lie to him so Brooke should quit saying that. Yes things took too long to tell him but he is very clear that she never lied to him even if Brooke is not clear about that. He says he still loves her and she needs to know that. Nicole finds Maya holed up in her old room. She says this is where she is living now. Pam tells Ridge the news is everywhere now, Maya is transgender. Even Charlie knew but she just thought he was joking. She gets a text from Eric that Rick was in an accident. She tells Ridge that Maya was not with him. Ridge says he knew it; Rick has totally freaked out. Maya is stunned when Nicole tells her that she told Wyatt, but he promised he would not say anything. Maya can't believe she did that when Wyatt's dad is the biggest media mogul on the planet. Nicole apologizes and says she never meant to hurt Maya nor wanted this to happen. Maya calms down and says it was not all Nicole's fault. Nicole asks if Rick proposed and Maya says yes; it was the most beautiful, romantic moment of her life. She wanted to say yes but not until she had told him everything. He was shocked and disappointed but he understood and he told her that he still loved her. She says she tried to explain but the phone kept buzzing and then Rick called Bill and his dad and the way he talked about shame and embarrassment, she would not stay and listen to that so she left. She says she can handle the fallout but Rick should not have to so that is why she left. He is better off without her. Jake hands Ridge an e-mail he should see \u0096 Maya has sent in her resignation. Several more times Rick tries to get up and leave and go find Maya. He must explain. He still loves her and accepts her as she is; he does not care about her past. He tells Brooke that he proposed. She asks if he is engaged and he says no, Maya would not accept until she told him about herself. Brooke says what Bill did was inexcusable but Maya is not blameless either. She should have told him a long time ago. Rick is enraged that most everyone but him knew about it and was talking behind his back. Brooke reminds him again to calm down. She and Eric will be downstairs if he needs anything. Nicole tells Maya that she can't quit. She made a life for herself at Forrester and she can not give that up. Maya said she wanted it and a life with Rick. They were a team and now this press and backlash. She says she tried to talk to him while they were in their cars and she gave him every opportunity to say he still loved her and wanted to get married, but he hung up. Ridge slips past Brooke and Eric in the living room and goes up to Rick's bedroom. Rick feels he is there to lord it over him that everyone knew but him. Ridge says they do need to take control of the situation and if Rick is too tied up with personal problems then he can take over. Brooke tells Eric that if Maya wanted to talk to Rick she would be here now. She is not going to judge Maya for the decision to be who she is now but she has been involved with Rick for a very long time now and should have told him before Bill publicized it. Rick trusted her but she turned out to be just like every other woman in Rick's life, Caroline and Amber .she let him down. Rick reminds Ridge that he is still CEO but Ridge counters that really as it looks right now that he is hiding under the covers. Rick says he does not have to tell Ridge anything. Ridge fires back that no he doesn't as he already knew. He knew before Rick did. But Rick always thinks he knows best and no one tells him what to do. That's just how arrogant he is .and now the portrait downstairs on the wall with the new matriarch .the woman behind the man. But Rick freaked out just like he did with Caroline and could not face it. His girlfriend told him she was transgender and he could not handle that and he snapped. He lost it just like he loses it with every woman in his life. He turns to leave and says Ricky boy brought this on himself. Rick gets up and lunges after him.",
