No longer able to stand not knowing what is going on, Nick calls off all his meetings for the day and rushes out of his office to find Brooke.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke is furious with Stephanie for ambushing her at the press conference.  Stephanie does not understand why Brooke is so upset about being offered half of the company.  Eric, Stephanie and Ridge pressure Brooke to accept the offer.  Stephanie promises to never disrespect Brooke again if she comes back to the company.   Brooke cannot believe how hard Stephanie is trying to get her to return to Forrester.  Just as Brooke is beginning to soften, Stephen and Jackie barge in and tell her not to sign anything.   Stephen lets Stephanie have it for trying to bribe his daughter into giving up her future with Nick.  Stephanie argues that is not what she is trying to do, claiming the stock agreement is totally legitimate with no stipulations. Disregarding her words, Stephen tells her that Brooke is not going to have anything to do with her company or her \"dysfunctional\" family.   At this point, Nick walks in and commends Stephen for sticking up for Brooke. Nick says the only reason Stephanie is offering Brooke half the company is to force her back with Ridge.  He assures her that this desperate attempt is not going to work and then escorts Brooke out.  Later, after everyone has left the office, Stephen sneaks back in and picks the stocks up off Stephanie's desk. \n\n\nAt Brooke's House, Nick and Brooke debate about the Forrester offer.  Brooke reminds him of how lucrative it would be.  Nick does not care about that and grabs the documents from Brooke so he can rip them up.  When Brooke realizes what he is about to do, she stops him. With tears in her eyes, she tells him he is asking her to give up her dream.  Nick realizes it is a big sacrifice, but begs her to do it for their future.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, Bridget tells Felicia and Dante she cannot believe that Stephanie has offered her mother half of the company.  Dante says that Brooke did not accept Stephanie's offer, but Felicia points out that she did not decline it either.  Bridget worries that if Brooke accepts the offer it will cause problems in her relationship with Nick.  She thinks Stephanie has orchestrated the whole thing solely to get Brooke and Ridge back together.  Bridget tells Dante she has to go talk to her Mom.  He is disappointed because they had plans.  She kisses him goodbye and promises to make it up to him. Later when Dante is working alone in his studio Felicia walks in and startles him.  She asks him about his relationship with Bridget. Felicia thinks Bridget is still hung up on Nick.  Dante says she is just worried about Stephanie putting stress on Brooke and Nick's relationship.  Felicia thinks Dante is in denial.  Not wanting to talk anymore about Bridget, Felicia becomes flirtatious.  She brings up their night together again. Looking lustily at him, Felicia tells him they should explore their feelings for their son's sake.   Dante walks over to her and kisses her passionately.  \n\n\n",
