    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke and Bill kissed, and Brooke wondered how long they'd be gone on their trip. In reply, Bill asked how long she thought it would take Ridge to get his head on straight. Brooke realized that she needed to talk to Katie but promised to meet Bill at the jet later.\n\n\nBrooke left, and Wyatt called Bill to tell him that Quinn was having a hard time with Bill's engagement to Brooke. Wyatt was hoping that Bill could talk to Quinn, but Bill said he couldn't because he was on his way out of the country to marry Brooke.\n\n\nLater on the jet, Bill took his seat behind his desk, and the pilot welcomed him back. Justin arrived and relayed that he'd done what Bill had asked. Bill said that Justin had cut it close, and Justin conveyed that R.J. had the necklace but wouldn't do anything until he heard from Bill.\n\n\nJustin gave Bill a tablet to have a video call with R.J. R.J. had gotten his package and said the necklace was cool. Bill relayed that R.J. was a member of an exclusive club. Bill claimed there were only four such necklaces in the world, and R.J. was the youngest owner of one.\n\n\nR.J. was impressed and showed that he was already wearing it. Bill said it was an expensive piece of jewelry and a sign of strength for men like them. Bill wanted R.J. to wear it with Spencer pride because they would soon be family. R.J. promised to do so, and Bill told the child that he would see R.J. as soon as Bill and Brooke returned.\n\n\nAfter the call, Justin noted that the sword meant a lot to Bill, who was sticking it to Ridge. Bill admitted that doing so was part of it. Bill also felt that he was about to be the stepfather to a great kid, and he didn't want the boy to feel left out. Bill said that Ridge had to stop having his hissy fits and accept that Brooke and Bill would be married and that R.J. would live with Bill and Brooke.\n\n\nBill informed Justin that Justin would also be taking the trip to the Middle East. Justin asked what that would be for. \"Whatever might come up,\" Bill responded.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Ridge dressed for the day. He was still upset about Brooke and Bill, and Katie tried to tell Ridge that Bill wasn't all bad. Ridge insisted that Brooke marrying Bill would signify to R.J. that everything Bill had done was acceptable but Bill's actions were not acceptable at all to Ridge.\n\n\nRidge left, and Brooke arrived. Katie said that Ridge wasn't there, and Brooke decided that it was good because she and Katie could talk alone. Katie conveyed that she knew about the engagement and asked when the big day was. Brooke replied that she and Bill were leaving town to get married.\n\n\nKatie left to check and Will, and upon her return, she wondered why Brooke was still there. Katie guessed Brooke wanted congratulations or to keep Katie from hearing about it through the press. Brooke said that she didn't expect congratulations, and she didn't know what kind of press coverage there would be in Dubai.\n\n\nBrooke said she had to meet Bill at the jet, and she hadn't wanted to get into a debate with Ridge. Brooke also didn't want to argue with Katie. Brooke just wanted Ridge and R.J. to know where she'd be. \"And what you'll be doing,\" Katie added. Brooke wished Katie could be happy for Brooke.\n\n\nKatie scoffed, and Brooke asked if Katie knew what had happened the previous day and if Ridge had calmed down yet. Katie said Ridge wasn't thrilled about Bill being a stepparent to R.J., and Ridge didn't trust Bill. Brooke replied that Brooke trusted Bill, but Katie said Ridge had an issue with that, too.\n\n\nBrooke stated that she was moving on with her life, just like Ridge was, but Katie responded that Ridge didn't see it that way. Brooke asked how Katie saw it.\n\n\nKatie conveyed that Brooke's relationship with Bill would always be hard for Katie, and Katie couldn't lie about it. Katie wanted to solve their problems, but she didn't know how. Katie considered that they might be unsolvable, or time might help them heal. Brooke uttered that she hoped it would.\n\n\nWhen Brooke left, she bumped into Ridge, who was returning because he'd left something at the house. She said she'd been there to tell Katie about the engagement and to tell Ridge and Katie about the trip. Ridge asked if Brooke was eloping, and at her silence, he guessed he was right.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want to argue about it but noted that she couldn't get married there after Ridge's behavior the previous day. Ridge noted that her family wouldn't even be involved in it. She said she and Bill needed to get away, and her sisters knew where she'd be in case of an emergency.\n\n\nBrooke tried to leave, but Ridge stopped her. She conveyed that \"this\" was the way it would be, and they had new lives. \"What about our old life?\" Ridge asked. He stated that they had a child together, and it wouldn't change. Brooke declared that she'd return from her trip as Mrs. Bill Spencer, and R.J. would live with her and Bill.\n\n\nRidge disagreed. He said Brooke knew what Bill was capable of, and she'd left Bill over what Bill had done to Katie. Ridge argued that Bill hadn't been faithful to Katie. Brooke said Bill would be the first to admit his mistakes with Katie, but Bill was devoted to and loved Brooke. \"I love you,\" Ridge stated.\n\n\nBrooke seemed confused, and Ridge said he'd always love her and want to do what was best for her. He hoped that she'd see that he wasn't the bad guy in the situation, and she'd see it before it was too late. Brooke sighed and walked away.\n\n\nLater, Ridge entered Katie's bedroom. He told Katie that he'd encountered Brooke, who believed that what had happened to Katie wouldn't happen to Brooke. Katie stated that Brooke might be right because Bill had relentlessly pursued Brooke. Ridge corrected that Brooke had rejected Bill, but Bill had refused to accept it. Katie reasoned that it could be difficult to accept things that one didn't like.\n\n\nRidge guessed that Katie was tired of talking about it. Katie wasn't. She was glad he felt that he could talk to her about it, and she'd be concerned if he didn't feel he could. She expressed worry about him being stressed out about it and having difficulty letting it go. He said his gut wouldn't let him.\n\n\nKatie felt that Brooke had to make her own choices, and Brooke had chosen Bill. Katie suggested that she and Ridge make their own choices and plan their own wedding with their family and friends. Ridge agreed that they should do that. They hugged and kissed, but Ridge still looked unresolved.\n\n\nBack on the jet, Brooke rushed aboard, apologizing for being late. Bill was in a hurry to take off, but Brooke wanted to slow down and savor every moment. She thanked him for the happiest time she'd had in a long time. Being with Bill was a new experience each day. Bill said they'd have an exotic start to their next adventure. \"Yes, the rest of our lives!\" Brooke beamed.\n\n\nBill said he wouldn't promise that there would always be camel races, and Brooke interrupted, guessing that they'd ride camels to the wedding location. Bill wouldn't give away any hints about the wedding except to say that the most beautiful thing at the ceremony would be his bride. They expressed their love for each other, and the pilot announced that they were number one for takeoff.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Liam arrived with a kiss for Hope. Liam wanted to make plans with Hope and cited that she had her house all to herself because Bill and Brooke were headed for the Middle East that day. Hope wanted to hear more about the trip, and Liam said they'd talk about it poolside at the house.\n\n\nWyatt entered, excited to hear that they were having a pool party. Liam promptly noted that Wyatt hadn't been invited. Wyatt asked who then would tell Hope the big news. Liam said he'd already done it, but Wyatt figured that Liam didn't know that Brooke and Bill were getting married on their trip. Hope and Liam were surprised to hear it. Wyatt wondered why Bill hadn't told Liam about it and guessed that Bill had entrusted Wyatt to be the one to tell Hope the news.\n\n\n\"Maybe it is a good thing that I have two boyfriends,\" Hope stated, adding that she'd have no idea of what was happening in her mother's life if it hadn't been for Liam and Wyatt. Wyatt claimed she could have gotten all the information from just him, and Liam snapped that if information was all Hope needed, then Wyatt would be perfect for Hope.\n\n\nAs the men bickered with each other, Hope murmured that when she, Liam, and Wyatt were together, she felt like the third wheel. Wyatt offered to cook for Hope, but Liam said she was busy. Hope asked how that was, and Liam said the pool time could run late. Liam suggested that they take a cue from Brooke and Bill by hopping on the jet and making it a double wedding.\n\n\nHope announced that she wouldn't be running off to get married. \"With you, she means,\" Wyatt added, but Hope clarified that she wouldn't do it with anyone. Wyatt asked for her verdict on going out of town, but Liam contended that it was his turn to take Hope on a trip.\n\n\nHope declared that she had work to do, and so did Liam. Liam claimed that he was the boss when his father was out of town, and Wyatt threatened to tell their father that Liam was slacking \"again.\" Liam noted that Bill had ditched work to take his woman halfway around the world and wouldn't loudly object to Liam doing the same.\n\n\nHope snapped her fingers to get the men's attention off each other and onto her. She told them that she didn't want to be swept off her feet. She wanted to be grounded and to think about her desires for the future. She promised she'd make a decision, and the decision would be the best thing for all of them. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Katie it's beginning to look like a better morning. He can't believe he let Bill get him that way. Everything he says sends a message and it's not all right with him to be a step dad to RJ. It's driving him crazy. Liam slips into Hope's office while she is having a hard time making a decision over fabrics/designs/colors. He kisses her. Then says his dad is out of town today and her house is going to be empty so they could make plans. Hope is not following along until Liam says she must not know but Bill is taking Brooke out of the country and they are leaving for the Middle East today. Hope is stunned. Wyatt calls his Dad who answers the phone \u0096 Spencer. Wyatt quips this is Spencer also and it means so much to have his name. He's calling about his mom as she is having a hard time with Bill being engaged now. She doesn't want him to know but Wyatt thinks he should. Maybe Bill could talk to her. Bill says not now. He's is going out of town, in fact out of the country. He and Brooke are going it be married in Dubai. Hope wants to hear more from Liam about this Dubai trip. He says good they can discuss it at the pool at her house. Wyatt walks up about that time and says great, he'd love a pool party and his trunks are in the truck. Liam says he is not invited. Wyatt says then who will tell Hope the big news. Bill and her mom are getting married. Brooke walks up to Katie's bedroom and asks if Ridge is there. Katie says he just left. Brooke says that is good; best they talk alone. Katie says she knows already that she and Bill are getting married. Brooke says yes she and Bill are leaving town today and when they get back they will be married. She says she doesn't expect a congratulations and she doesn't want to get into it with Ridge but she wanted him and RJ to know where she'd be. Katie says Ridge has a problem with Bill being RJ's step dad. As a matter of fact he has a problem with Brooke even marrying Bill. Brooke says she has moved on just as Ridge has so he will have to get used to it. Katie tells her that she can't lie about it. Her marrying Bill is always going to bother her. So much has happened and she wishes she could get past it but she doesn't know how to do that. Maybe it can't be solved or maybe time will help this heal. Brooke says she hopes it will. Bill settles in his cabin on the jet. Michael tells him the flight plans are ready and just waiting for Brooke. Justin joins him for a moment and Bills wants to make sure that he gave the necklace to the intended party. Justin says yes and told him not to do anything until he heard from Bill. Brooke leaves Katie's and runs right into Ridge. He says he forgot something and was coming back for it. She tells him she just told Katie and wanted to tell him that she is going out of town. He asks if she is skipping town with Spencer .then realizes he is right. She's running off to get married. Brooke says she has to. She certainly can't do it here after how he acted yesterday. This is her life now. This is the way it's going to be. He asks about their life. They have a child together. She says Bill made mistakes with Katie but he is a devoted father. And he loves Brooke. Ridge blurts out that he loves her too. He says he will always love her and wants to do what is best for her. He says he is not the bad guy in this and he hopes once she realizes that it won't be too late. Hope listens to Wyatt and Liam jaw at each other and says it is a good thing she has two boyfriends .that's the only way she learns about what is happening with her mother. She feels like a third wheel. Wyatt says he'd like to cook for her tonight. Liam says no, she already has plans. Hope didn't know they had plans. Liam says yeah a late pool party or they could take a tip from his Dad and hop on a jet and make it a double wedding. She laughs; Wyatt doesn't. Hope tells Liam that as flattering as that is, she won't be leaving town to get married. Wyatt quips at least not to Liam ..she says not anyone. Wyatt says okay marriage is off the table but there has not been a verdict on out of town trips yet. Liam says he thinks Wyatt has already had his quota. If Hope is going anywhere, it is going to be with him. Hope speaks up and says she has too much work to do. He does not want to be whisked off her feet just yet. She wants to stay grounded and get her head together so she can make a decision soon. And when she does, she trusts that it will be the best for all of them. Liam and Wyatt look at each other and try to put on their happy face. Justin hands Bill a tablet and he speaks with RJ and asks if he got his package. RJ says yes with the necklace that is just like Wyatt's and Liam's. Bill says yes and it is very important and it means he is a member of a very exclusive club. There are only four of these in the world and RJ is the youngest to ever get one. RH says he is already wearing it. Bill likes that. He says he wants him to wear it with pride, Spencer pride. It is not just some trinket but a very expensive piece of jewelry but more important than that it is a symbol of strength. He'll see him soon as he returns. Bill tells Justin that Ridge does not want him involved with his son. That's too bad as he and Brooke are going to be married and RJ will be living with them. So Ridge will have to accept that and quit having these little hissy fits. Bill tells Justin by the way, he is coming with them for whatever might come up. Katie is surprised to see Ridge back home. He says he ran into Brooke outside. She seems to think that what happened to Katie won't happen to her. Katie says maybe it won't. Bill pursued her pretty hard. Ridge says she rejected Bill and he didn't like it. Katie says sometimes accepting things we don't like can be pretty difficult. He thinks she is talking about them. She says no, not really. She is glad he can talk to her about it. She'd be worried if he couldn't. But she is worried about him. He says and that is not what he wants for her. Katie says it is Brooke's life and she gets to make her own choices and she wants Bill. And now they get to make their own choices and lead their own lives. Maybe they should plan their own wedding right here with family and friends. He thinks they should do that.",
