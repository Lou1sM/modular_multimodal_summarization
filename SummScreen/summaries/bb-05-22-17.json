    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Rick and Maya discussed the earlier wedding with Zende and Nicole. Rick couldn't believe he was saying it about a Spencer wedding, but it had been touching. Maya revealed that she and Rick would hitch a ride on the honeymoon flight to Paris. Rick had to deal with some clients in the aftermath of the design theft, and Maya had a photo shoot. Nicole was surprised to her they'd leave that day and asked who'd care for Lizzy.\n\n\nMaya received a call from Teresa, the nanny. A family emergency had developed, and Teresa needed to leave town for a few days. After the call, Rick and Maya wondered what to do about Lizzy. \"Hello? I'm right here,\" Nicole said.\n\n\nMaya and Rick didn't want to put such a burden on Nicole and Zende -- or on Lizzy's grandparents, either. Nicole insisted that it wasn't a problem. Maya and Rick said they'd find another nanny to help out. Nicole promised that Lizzy was in good hands, and Rick and Maya took off to meet the Spencers on the jet.\n\n\nOn Bill's jet, Bill announced that he had sparkling water for his wife. \"That would be me,\" Brooke said, taking the glass. As they canoodled, Bill said it had been a perfect day. It had started with their wedding and was ending with their honeymoon flight to Paris. Brooke revealed that she'd agreed to let Rick and Maya hitch a ride to Paris.\n\n\nBill pouted about it because it was their honeymoon flight. Brooke promised they wouldn't waste a moment of their honeymoon. She noted that Rick and Maya hadn't arrived yet, and the newlyweds kissed. Bill said he'd waited a long time to make Brooke his wife, and when she'd stepped into the archway, she'd been glowing. Brooke replied that she'd been sure. There had been not doubts, and she was his.\n\n\nA song played, and flashbacks of Bill and Brooke's relationship flickered between snippets of the couple making love in the jet's bedroom. In bed afterward, Bill said Brooke had a beautiful inner glow, and it almost made him feel as if he was a good person. Giggling, she replied that he didn't need her for that. Bill said he needed her for everything.\n\n\nBrooke wanted to stay in bed for the entire flight, but Bill reminded her that she'd invited some hitchhikers. She admitted she should have thought more about it before doing so. Bill agreed at first. He said he was teasing, and giving a ride was the least they could do for family. Bill looked forward to being in Paris alone with his bride, and the two kissed.\n\n\nLater, Bill and Brooke had changed clothes, and Bill was anxious for Rick and Maya to get there. Brooke said it was the honeymoon, and time meant nothing. Liking the sentiment, Bill said he'd be \"Chill Bill\" instead of Dollar Bill, and Brooke promised to hold him to it.\n\n\nRick and Maya arrived, and Bill declared that it was about time. Brooke gave him a look, and Bill said, \"What is time? Time means nothing.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks for letting us hitch a ride, Dad,\" Rick teased. Maya was sure the newlyweds would have preferred to be alone. Bill started to agree but decided to say that he and Brooke were happy to have the travelers. Bill revealed that he had a fully stocked bar and said, \"So, son, let me buy you a drink.\"\n\n\nAs the men went to the bar, Brooke asked Maya if Teresa was watching Lizzy. Maya explained that a family emergency had developed for Teresa, and Zende and Nicole were watching the baby. Maya planned on getting someone else to do it because she didn't want to impose on the young couple any more than she and Rick already had.\n\n\nAt some point after the jet had taken off, Rick was reading a presentation, and Maya was flipping through pictures of Lizzy on a cell phone. Brooke said that someone was missing their baby girl. Bill remarked that babies were lethal with the way they grabbed onto hearts, and when Will had been Lizzy's age, Bill had been a fool for the child. Brooke told Bill that he still was.\n\n\nRick started looking at the pictures, too, and noted that Lizzy had Maya's smile. Maya wondered if the baby missed them. Brooke assured Maya that Lizzy was in good hands. Brooke cooed over pictures of her granddaughter, and Maya said it felt weird to be without the baby. Rick was sure Zende and Nicole were taking good care of Lizzy.\n\n\nBill asked if it had been wise to let Nicole watch the kid. Maya asked why, and he replied that Nicole was the birth mother. He again asked if it had been a good idea. Maya believed it was fine and cited that Nicole loved Lizzy as her own. \"Lizzy is Nicole's own,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBrooke gave Bill a look, and Bill responded that he was just stating the obvious. To Rick and Maya, Brooke said it was just her husband's unorthodox way of showing concern. Maya believed that the concern was unwarranted. Maya insisted that Nicole loved being Lizzy's aunt, and one day soon, Nicole would make a wonderful mother.\n\n\nBack at Brooke's house, R.J. and Coco had arrived and were discussing with Zende and Nicole how R.J. felt about his mother getting married to Bill instead of Ridge. R.J. was disappointed, but he said they were still a family.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Nicole and Zende watching Lizzy while Rick and Maya were gone. Nicole realized that she'd forgotten her appointment with Dr. Caspary that day. Zende was confident that he could watch Lizzy, but Nicole said he'd wanted to design with no distractions. Coco offered her and R.J.'s help but realized she shouldn't speak for R.J. It was fine with R.J. to do it, and Zende assured Nicole that the three of them had it under control.\n\n\nWalking Nicole to the door, Zende asked if she was nervous about the fertility testing. She was, but she was sure it would be good news. She wanted to get it out of the way so that they could get back to the fun of trying. Zende wished her luck, and she left.\n\n\nEveryone sat with Lizzy on a pallet. Zende couldn't wait to have a child of his own. R.J. felt that being a father was a long way off for him. Zende remarked that he'd felt that way, too, until he'd met Nicole. Things had changed for Zende, and he wanted a family as soon as possible.\n\n\nWhile the three discussed how good Zende was with the baby, Coco said that what she was about to say probably wouldn't faze R.J., who was happily off the market; however, women liked men who were good with babies. \"Well, then, hand me that kid,\" R.J. asserted and put Lizzy on his lap. Coco believed Zende would be an amazing dad. Zende couldn't wait for Nicole to say she was pregnant. He believed that they were \"so ready.\"\n\n\nAt Dr. Caspary's office, the doctor noticed that Nicole was radiant and said marriage agreed with her. Nicole said she'd be even more so once she was pregnant. She felt that her body had been \"so happy\" then, and she wanted the whole experience again. She said Zende would be with her for every step, and that time, it would be her and Zende's baby.\n\n\nNicole revealed that her period was late. She'd taken a pregnancy test, and the negative result of it had thrown her. Nicole continued to chat about the joys of pregnancy -- after the morning sickness had passed. She recalled cradling her stomach nonstop after the first three months and said she'd loved being pregnant.\n\n\nDr. Caspary stated that it was a transformative experience and asked if it had been difficult giving up Lizzy. Nicole explained that she'd had the baby for Maya and Rick, so Lizzy had always been their child. Nicole conveyed that she'd gotten pregnant right away the last time, but it hadn't happened again, even with all of her and Zende's efforts. She'd wanted to be diligent by taking a fertility test, but she believed she and Zende could keep trying with no problem.\n\n\nDr. Caspary expressed that taking the fertility test had been wise. She asked if Nicole hadn't had a period since her last appointment, which would mean Nicole had missed a few periods. Nicole affirmed it. She believed it was because of working out and mild work stress. She added that she also had a little abdomen pain.\n\n\n\"Your pelvis,\" Dr. Caspary knowingly noted when Nicole touched the pain area on her body. Nicole asked why the doctor had said it with a particular tone. Dr. Caspary said it explained Nicole's problem. Dr. Caspary believed that Nicole had amenorrhea. It was a condition that matched the symptoms of a missing period and abdominal pain.\n\n\nNicole asked what it meant and how it occurred. Dr. Caspary stated that it could be triggered by contraceptives, menopause, medications, or prior pregnancy. Assuming that the pregnancy had made her irregular, Nicole asked how she could get back on track.\n\n\nCaspary explained that Nicole had uterine scar tissue from the pregnancy. The scarring made it difficult for an egg \"to get picked up by the fallopian tubes,\" which decreased the chance of pregnancy. The doctor believed that Nicole might have secondary infertility, and because of the scarring, Nicole might not be able to conceive again or carry a child to term.\n\n\nDr. Caspary said it happened sometimes after childbirth. \"Can't conceive...Like ever?\" Nicole asked. Immediately, Nicole asserted that it was unacceptable. She declared that she and Zende would have a baby, and that was the plan. She said she'd already had one, and she could have another and another after it.\n\n\nCaspary understood that it was a lot to absorb. Nicole called it crazy. She insisted that she was young and healthy. Nicole stated that she'd had Lizzy, and Lizzy was healthy. Nicole rejected that idea that something was wrong with her. She said that they'd treat the condition, and it wouldn't stop her and Zende from having a family. \"It can't,\" the determined Nicole concluded.\n\n\n",

The doctor understands that she has missed a few periods but Nicole is not pregnant. She explains to Nicole that she has a condition with her pelvis. As they discuss it, she tells Nicole that it is not that simple. It can come from various things like contraception or medication but she might not be able to conceive. Nicole says that is unacceptable so do not tell her that. It is crazy. She is healthy and had a perfectly healthy child the first time. She knows it will be that way again.
