Quinn figured that it wouldn't last, and Brooke would be headed for the next victim by summer's end. Quinn decided that they had to stop the wedding. Wyatt warned Quinn against doing anything because Brooke and Hope were their bosses.\n\n\nQuinn insisted that Bill was walking into a trap, but Wyatt felt that Bill could handle it. She thought Bill deserved better, and Wyatt guessed she meant herself. She claimed not to need anyone or anything. \"Except dad,\" Wyatt replied. He said she should have dropped her guard and told Bill what she'd wanted. Quinn claimed that she'd had her fun with Bill, and they'd made Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn asked why she shouldn't use the power she had to save Bill from a mistake, and Wyatt asked what power she had over Bill. \"I'm a woman, Wyatt. The list is endless,\" she quipped.\n\n\nWyatt feared that Quinn had some kind of ammunition and that she'd actually use it. Quinn continued to be evasive, and he noted that she'd pulled sketchy things in the past. She suddenly decided that she and Wyatt were late for a meeting with Ridge, and Wyatt growled in frustration.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Donna and Hope discussed Brooke and Bill's elopement. Hope wondered if Ridge knew. Just then, Ridge entered, saying that he was aware that Brooke was about to make the biggest mistake of her life. Hope and Donna didn't understand Ridge's issue with the wedding, but he said being with Katie didn't mean he had stopped caring or looking out for Brooke and his son.\n\n\nDonna reasoned that R.J. had taken the news of Ridge's engagement well, but Ridge said it was because Katie was a positive influence. In his view, Bill wasn't. Hope didn't care for Bill, either, but she couldn't deny that he'd been good to Brooke. Ridge referenced what Bill had done to Katie. Ridge insisted that Bill had almost destroyed Katie's life, and in time, he'd do the same to Brooke. He murmured that there had to be a way to stop it.\n\n\nQuinn and Wyatt entered for the meeting, and as the wedding talk continued, Ridge and Quinn were notably grumpy about it. Once Ridge had had enough of it, he asked Quinn to show him what she had for him. Taking a look at the jewelry she'd designed for couture, Ridge rasped that it was clunky and dated. Hope remarked that it was on trend, but Ridge said he wanted classic.\n\n\nQuinn apologized for being off base and offered to make more prototypes. \"Well, you're gonna have to come up with something if you want to keep working here,\" Ridge snapped. Quinn's brow rose, and her nostrils flared. Hope tried to smooth things by saying it had been an unusually stressful day.\n\n\nRidge apologized to everyone and said it was apparent that he wasn't thrilled about the wedding. Though Ridge thought that Wyatt was a \"good kid,\" Ridge felt that Bill wasn't good enough for Brooke or to be around Ridge's son. Wyatt's lips tightened, and he said he was sorry Ridge felt that way. Ridge received a video call from R.J., and everyone decided to reconvene later.\n\n\nDuring the call, Ridge readily noticed something around R.J.'s neck. R.J excitedly explained that Mr. Spencer had sent the necklace and that there were only four of the necklaces in the world. R.J. beamed about being a part of the exclusive club with Bill, Liam, and Wyatt and about wearing the charm with Spencer pride. Ridge suggested that R.J. get back to his homework. After the call, Ridge grimaced.\n\n\nBack in Rick's office, Wyatt figured it would take a hundred hours to fix the sample collection. Quinn said she could do that in a New York minute. She was more interested in Ridge's reaction to Brooke and Bill. To Quinn, Ridge seemed awfully invested in Brooke's happiness, and Quinn wondered what he'd do if he found out about her and Bill.\n\n\nWyatt advised Quinn not to go there and figured it would be her word against Bill's. \"The camera doesn't lie,\" Quinn replied and flashed her cell phone picture at Wyatt.\n\n\nOn the jet to the Middle East, Bill noted that he and Brooke would soon land in Dubai. Brooke said it was a great place to be married, and she asked if maybe Abu Dhabi would be the city for the wedding. Bill said the wedding would be a surprise, and it would be unique and befitting his princess.\n\n\nBrooke browsed through books about the destination, and Bill rambled off a list of things to do. Brooke suggested they camp in the middle of the desert, but Bill said she wouldn't want to after seeing the hotel. She saw that there was an Arabian Wildlife Animal Park and asked if they'd get married there. Bill purred like a tiger, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Brooke and Bill wore headsets as they took a helicopter ride around Dubai and were awed at the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Bill joked that it was Brooke's wedding present, and Justin had slacked off because he'd forgotten to put a bow on it for Brooke. The helicopter headed for the Atlantis Hotel, located on the crown of Palm Island.\n\n\nBrooke and Bill drove a white convertible Ferrari into the parking lot. Attendants took the car and offered the couple food and drinks. The manager promised them a memorable stay, and Brooke and Bill checked into their suite. They strolled out to the view from their balcony, and Brooke exclaimed that she loved Dubai. Bill swung her around and then stroked her cheek. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill and Brooke are on the jet and she can't wait to see what else he has planned for them. And he can not wait to get married. Donna and Hope discuss another Brooke wedding and they are missing it. Hope does understand though why they would want to elope. They wonder if Ridge knows. He walks in and says yes he knows that her mother is about to make the biggest mistake of her life. Both wonder why if he has moved on with Katie does he care that her mom is marrying Bill. He assures them he will always care for Brooke and her well being as well as his son. Donna reminds him that Brooke said RJ took the news well. Ridge says that is different. Katie is a positive influence in his son's life; Spencer is not. Hope admits that she doesn't really care for Bill either but you can't deny how loyal he is to her mother. Ridge says yes but he almost ruined Katie's life and given time he will do the same to Brooke. There has to be a way to stop this. Wyatt breaks the news to his mother that Bill is flying to Dubai to marry Brooke. Quinn says his dad sure moves fast. But to Brooke Logan, wonder if he thinks that will last. Look at her track record \u0096 Ridge, Thorne, Eric and Hope's jailbird dad, the list goes on. She is just going to end up embarrassing Wyatt's father. Wyatt wonders if she is worried about only Bill or she and his dad. Quinn scoffs that please, Brooke will have moved on by end of summer and moved on to her next victim. Bill will be humiliated. They have to stop this wedding. Wyatt says it is sort of out of their hands. There is no way to stop a wedding. He looks at her and hopes that she is not going to do something. He points out that Brooke is one of their bosses and Hope's mother. She says his father is walking into a trap. Wyatt thinks he will be fine; he's a big boy. Quinn agrees but she thinks he deserves better. Wyatt wonders if she means herself. She gloats that she is an independent woman and doesn't need anyone or anything. Wyatt says except for his dad. But if she wanted him then she should have dropped her guard and told him what she wanted. She laughs and says talking is not what she and Bill do best. He covers his ears and says he doesn't want to hear this. She says but if she has the power to stop him from making a mistake, the she probably should. She's a woman; she has powers. The list is endless. It would save Brooke the scandal of another failed marriage and his dad of his tiny broken heart. She acknowledges that it is tiny and undoubtedly cold but in there someplace. Wyatt says and it belongs to Brooke. Quinn smiles and says Brooke would like to think that but he can't be tamed. He can't be owned. Wyatt says he is being serious. It sounds like she has some ammunition and he is afraid she will use it. She says he knows her; her finger is always on the trigger. He says okay fine; just tell him if he should be worried. She cops out by saying they are late for a meeting with Ridge. Bill tells Brooke they are almost ready to land but he's still keeping his secret of where they are going to get married. But he will promise her this; it will be incredibly unique and beautiful, befitting his princess. They discuss the beautiful architecture, the turquoise water and beaches and places they can take a sunset stroll on the Gulf ..or a camel ride or go camping in the middle of the desert. He doesn't think they will want to do that. The hotel is one of the most luxurious. He points out the tallest building in the world with 163 floors. They are welcomed to Atlantis Palm. Donna tells Ridge that Bill and Brooke are going to get married and she doesn't think there is anything anyone can do about it. Ridge says she is right. So they just need to hope Brooke will come to her senses before that. Wyatt and Quinn come in with their wares. Ridge seems to be in a rush and wants to see what they have. He looks at it critically and asks if this is for the couture line; it seems a little chunky and dated. He thought they talked about elegant and polished. Hope says they are very on trend. Ridge grouses that he asked for elegance. He thinks Quinn can do better. He says he is disappointed in both of them. Quinn apologizes for being so far off base but she can make him more prototypes. He snaps that she will have to do something if she wants to continue to work here. Hope steps in and says he has given Quinn some valid points but she is sure Quinn won't mind redesigning something else. It's been a highly stressful day so maybe this is not the best time for a meeting. Ridge sighs and says she is right. It doesn't take a genius to know he isn't thrilled about this wedding. He tells Wyatt he's a good kid but his dad is not good enough for Brooke or to be around his son. Wyatt is sorry he feels that way. Ridge's tablet chimes and he says that is his son now so meeting is over. They talk a minute about school and then Ridge notices something around RJ's neck. He says is was a gift from Mr. Spencer. And now he is part of a club since there are only four in the world like this. And he's marrying his mom so they will be family. And he should wear it with pride; Spencer pride. Ridge seethes quietly and tells RJ he better get back to his studies. He loves him and will talk to him tomorrow. Wyatt tells Quinn that was interesting. Ridge didn't like her designs and now she will have to work another 100 hours to get it perfect for him. She says she is not worried about the collection. She can fix that in a New York minute, but just take a look on Ridge's face when talking about Bill and Brooke. Wyatt says news flash, they already knew that Ridge hated Bill. She says yes but for a man who has moved on he seems awfully invested in Brooke's happiness. Wyatt says they have been together for a long time so naturally he is protective. She says maybe it is more than that. Wonder what he would say if he found out about her and Bill. Wyatt tells her not to even go there. It would just be her word against Bill's and he would deny, deny, deny. She holds up her selfie and says Bill can deny all he wants but the cameras don't. Brooke says she loves Dubai!",
