Nick tells her he wants them to be able to talk about anything and ask how things are going with Dante.  He is surprised to learn Dante proposed to her, but he still cannot get his mind off Brooke.  Irritated by their conversation, Bridget tells Nick that he and Brooke are fundamentally different.  She explains that Nick is very sure of himself and rarely changes his mind, while Brooke is just the opposite.
