    "imdb": "With Liam having to decide Quinn's fate, Wyatt makes a plea to his brother to have mercy on his mother. Having been hired by Liam as a legal consultant, Justin preps Bill for what could be in store for Quinn if she is convicted. When Quinn learns that Liam put Justin on retainer, she believes that her fate has been sealed. Quinn's lawyer, Ed, explains to Liam the ramifications of pressing charges against her. Even Justin admits that legally their case is very weak as Quinn never locked Liam up at the cabin. Quinn makes a plea for Liam's feelings for her, but Liam hushes her and states that what happened between them was based on a lie. Lt. Baker then urges Liam to finally make his decision: Does he want to press charges against Quinn - or not?",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam gets a phone call from Lt. Baker saying he cannot hold Quinn forever, so Liam needs to say for the record if he is going to press charges or not. Liam says he will be over in a few minutes with his attorney. Wyatt drops by and asks Liam one more time not to press charges. Justin tells Bill that he is on board. Bill says great; then Quinn will be behind bars before the day is over. Justin tells Bill just to be prepared as anything could happen. It is a he said/she said. Bill does not believe a little game of pretend is going to stop justice. Bill says that is Justin's job to make sure justice is done even if Liam doesn't understand what is at stake. Quinn's attorney comes in and she says Liam is on his way and she does not think he will press charges, Adam wouldn't. The lawyer asks her to sit quietly and do not make any pleas, let him do the legal talking. Wyatt tells Liam that his mom won't get help in prison. She will have to harden up and he does not want that. Liam says she took his life and Wyatt's too with Steffy and he is not going to let her get away with that. Liam says Wyatt keeps making excuses. Wyatt says he did not come here to discuss Steffy. Just do what he does best and show some compassion and not press charges against his mother. Wyatt explains to Bill what he did. Quinn tells her lawyer that this might be over before he knows it. Liam has had plenty of time if he wanted to press charges, so she thinks he won't. Justin and Liam walk in. Lt. Baker wants to get started. Quinn interrupts and says she does not think they need all these people; they just need the two of them, her and Liam. She would like him to honor what they had at the cabin and not send her to prison. Liam starts to speak but when he does the attorney speaks up and says it was all consensual when they had physical relations and he was free to leave as he was not restrained. He was not forced into staying or held against his will and he did not resist any advances and in fact he made his own advances and told Eve that he loved her. There is no case here. Bill tells Wyatt that Quinn gets away with everything because no one wants to hold her accountable, but Liam will press charges and this time she is going away for a long, long time. Quinn tells Lt. Baker and her attorney that if she is released she can make this up to Liam that she is a new person. Liam asks Justin if he thinks they can win otherwise he does not want to stand before the court and let the world know what he went through. Justin is honest and says it will be a very difficult case to prove. Wyatt tells Bill that Quinn does twisted things for him out of twisted love but in the end she is his mother. He hates what she did to Liam but he cannot support Liam putting her behind bars. Liam comes back and can barely look at Quinn. He says what she did was wrong and she may think what happened was real. But he never cared about her and never will. She agrees that he is right. She never should have taken him from the parking lot that day. But she will not regret what happened after that. She became another woman and she can again. Liam tells her that she caused him the woman he really loved and yet she sent texts making Steffy think otherwise. She is still the scheming monster she always was. Lt. Baker says he gets it that Liam is angry but he will have to take this elsewhere unless he is pressing charges. If not, then he has to let Quinn go.",
