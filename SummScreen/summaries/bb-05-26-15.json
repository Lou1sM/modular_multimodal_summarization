Rick said Caroline could tell Ridge that his bid for the CEO spot wouldn't work, and Ridge wouldn't take Rick's job.\n\n\nCaroline reminded Rick that she was there to offer her support. She realized that it had to be difficult to deal with the news that Maya was transgender. Rick claimed it was \"nothing we can't overcome.\"\n\n\nCaroline wished that Maya had told Rick sooner, but Rick defended Maya. Caroline said that Maya had been manipulative. Caroline reminded Rick that he'd been furious about her kisses with Ridge. Rick told her things were different.\n\n\nRick thanked Caroline for reaching out to him. She said they had meant a lot to each other at one time. Rick encouraged Caroline not to trust Ridge.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam complained to Ivy that Bill had gone behind Liam's back to print the stories about Maya. Ivy reminded Liam that his father had always been ruthless. Liam agreed, but he wanted the company to have some sensitivity and common decency. Ivy advised him not to feel guilty, and she added that she loved him.\n\n\nIvy noted that Ridge had said that Rick's situation could mean a shift in power at Forrester. \"Rick could be on the way out,\" Ivy said. She added that Bill had said it was \"all just business.\"\n\n\nLiam lamented that he could live with it all -- as awful as Spencer had handled it -- as long as it protected Ivy and Caroline from Rick. Ivy cuddled Liam and admired his necklace. She claimed it wasn't because she had made it but rather because it meant that Liam was wearing a little part of her. Liam smiled. They discussed that the last necklace had been the past, and this one represented the future. Ivy noted that Steffy had been in Liam's past. Ivy was glad she could trust him.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge and Eric discussed Eric's dilemma about what to do with Rick as CEO. Eric refused to use Rick's pain against him. Ridge pointed out that Rick had made some poor decisions in his time as CEO.\n\n\nEric countered that Rick had many accomplishments, as well. Ridge pointed out that Rick didn't have any compassion or leadership skills. Ridge pointed out that it was not about Maya being transgender. It was about how Rick had reacted to that news and to other news. In recent months, Ridge noted that Rick had crashed his car and could have killed someone. Rick had also taken a loaded gun to the office and fired it. Ridge demanded that Eric make him CEO.\n\n\n\"I'm gonna stand with Rick,\" Eric said. Ridge was angry. He said that Eric seemed to be making decisions that were directly in opposition to what Ridge suggested. Ridge noted that it was about their past. Eric said they always seemed to return to the same point.\n\n\nEric argued that it had nothing to do with the past. He wanted Ridge to accept that Rick was the better man for the job. Ridge scoffed. Ridge insisted that Eric had to be concerned.\n\n\nRidge reiterated that it all went back to the past. Eric agreed somewhat. He pointed out that Ridge had stolen Brooke from him just as he had stolen Caroline from Rick. \"They were happy,\" Eric said. \"You expect to be rewarded for that?\" Eric asked. Ridge was silent. \"You're not quite the Forrester you think you are,\" Eric said.\n\n\nEric continued that Ridge would not be crowned for those achievements. Eric accused Ridge of wanting to take everything that Rick had left. \"Shame on you,\" Eric said.\n\n\nRidge refused to accept Eric's decision. Ridge added that it all boiled down to being a true Forrester, and Ridge was not truly Eric's son. Eric angrily stated that he was Ridge's father. \"Don't you dare suggest otherwise,\" Eric ordered.\n\n\nRidge countered that Eric insisted that he loved Ridge, but he showed him no loyalty or respect. Eric argued that Ridge was a world-famous designer, and Rick was the CEO. Eric couldn't believe that Ridge could not be content.\n\n\n\"And you got the girl. You always get the girl. Lean back and enjoy the fruits of your labors,\" Eric suggested. Ridge was angry but said nothing. Eric left. Ridge picked up the phone and said, \"I need to see you right away,\" to someone.\n\n\nLater, Steffy walked into Ridge's office after she had received his call. She smiled and asked how he'd known she was in town. Ridge teased that he always knew where she was. Steffy and Ridge discussed the news about Maya, and Ridge pointed out that Rick had handled it badly.\n\n\nSteffy noted that Rick had handled many things badly, including shooting a gun off in the building. Ridge lamented that Rick had not done enough to convince Eric to force Rick to step down as CEO.\n\n\nSteffy asked if her father was ready to be part of a hostile takeover, and Ridge agreed. He insisted it was time to fight for Forrester and oust Rick.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Rick was dressed in a suit, and he grabbed his briefcase, but Eric entered the house and stopped him. Rick greeted him and acknowledged that Ridge had probably spewed a bunch of negative comments about Rick. Eric agreed but said it was a battle Ridge could not win.\n\n\nEric added that he recalled what Rick had said about Ridge stealing Brooke and stealing Caroline. Rick agreed. Eric complimented Rick on his treatment of the situation with Maya. Eric said that Ridge could learn from Rick. \"You've done a terrific job as CEO,\" Eric said. He added that Rick had also grown as a man and had Eric's unconditional support.\n\n\nRick gushed that he would continue to improve because he wanted to be like his dad. They emotionally shared that they loved and trusted one another, and they embraced.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge questions his dad why he is hesitating. Does he need a list of things that Rick has done wrong. Eric says no he is aware of them but he is also well aware of Rick's accomplishments. Ridge does not think the bottom line is what it is all about. The company needs leadership and compassion and he wants his dad to execute the morality clause. Caroline stops in to see Rick at home. She knows he is going through a hard time and never would have believed that Maya is transgender. Liam is livid. He tells Ivy this story about Maya could have been contained. Bill knew he did not like running the story and basically just threw it in his face. Ivy says the power may be shifting and Ridge will be in and Rick on his way out. Liam is still unsure he wants to be that much like his dad but he will accept this if it means he can protect Ivy and Caroline from Rick. Ridge continues trying to talk his dad into using the morality clause but Eric refuses to do it. He is going to stick with Rick. Ridge says he will not accept that. Caroline and Rick do not want to continue to fight. She says she came there to be with him a fellow accident survivor. Rick warns her that Ridge is not to be trusted and will use her. During their banter about the CEO job Ridge asks if Eric thinks he is not qualified or is just still upset because Ridge took Brooke away from him years ago. Eric points out that Ridge has everything he wants but the CEO job; he even got the girl so he needs to be happy with that. Eric expects him to design and create. Ridge leaves and calls someone and says he must see them right away. Ivy explains that she likes Liam's necklace partly because she made it but also because it means he has a part of her with him always. And if he ever sees Steffy perhaps he can tell her the difference in then and now. Steffy walks into Rick's office to find Ridge. He tells her how Rick attacked him last night and is out of control. Rick walks downstairs and finds Eric who says he just saw Ridge. Of course Rick does not want Eric to listen to Ridge. This is only a game to Ridge, it is a matter of life and death to Rick; he needs it. After asking if Ridge is going to resign, he tells Steffy this is his legacy and he would not feel right to start another fashion house of his own. He says he and Tommy and she plus Spencer have enough stock to oust Rick and that is what they need to do. A fight is coming; they are going to take over FC. Eric and Rick hug when Rick says his dad is an aspiration and says he is proud to be Eric Forrester Jr. And Eric is not to be worried as they will hold their heads high and get through this together.",
