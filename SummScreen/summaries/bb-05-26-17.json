    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Dr. March's office, Nicole told her mother that Zende didn't know about the appointment because Nicole didn't want him to worry. Vivienne hoped they'd have good news to give him later. Dr. March arrived, and Nicole hoped Dr. March would have better news than Dr. Caspary.\n\n\nDr. March performed an ultrasound on Nicole. After reviewing the results, Dr. March informed Nicole that there were many adhesions on her uterus, and they were probably the result of the pregnancy. Vivienne asked how to fix it. Dr. March didn't know if they could. She said that parts of the uterine walls were sticking together, and it could be difficult to treat. Vivienne asked about surgery, and Dr. March said that, after removal, the fibroids could return.\n\n\nDr. March indicated that Nicole's ovaries were healthy. It meant that Nicole could try in vitro fertilization and surrogacy. Dr. March stated that Nicole probably wouldn't be able to carry a child. She wished she had better news. Vivienne thanked the doctor. Dr. March exited, and Nicole appeared devastated.\n\n\nIn the Forrester corridor, Pam and Charlie played with Lizzy, who Coco and R.J. had arrived with. Pam was ready to take the baby, but R.J. said he and Coco were babysitting for Nicole. Pam told them that Maya had asked Pam to look after the baby, and Charlie said Pam could use her Lizzy fix. Pam said she adored babies, especially since Tiny had died.\n\n\nCoco questioned who Tiny was, and R.J. said it had been a Doberman. Pam missed having someone to love on. Charlie asked about himself, and patting his cheek, Pam replied that she meant besides him.\n\n\nR.J. and Coco handed over the baby, and Coco remarked that the baby made her excited to be a mom someday. \"Excuse me, do I need to have a talk with you guys?\" Charlie asked. Coco clarified that it wouldn't be for about twenty years, and R.J. added that Zende and Nicole would have one soon.\n\n\nLater, Vivienne and Nicole arrived and saw Pam and Charlie playing with Lizzy behind the desk. Nicole asked R.J. and Coco what was happening, and they explained that Maya had asked Pam to watch Lizzy. Pam pretended that Lizzy was answering phone calls. With a stuffed lion in his hand, Charlie pretended to call and ask for a Forrester \"cat-ture\" order.\n\n\nCharlie got the idea to take Lizzy to the zoo to see real lions. Smiling curtly, Nicole quickly took Lizzy from Pam and Charlie. Vivienne looked sad as Nicole protectively hugged the baby.\n\n\nNicole and Vivienne took Lizzy into the design office. Nicole couldn't believe both doctors had said the same thing. Vivienne suggested getting another opinion. Nicole stated that the pregnancy with Lizzy had been easy and without complications. \"None that we were aware of,\" her mother added.\n\n\nNicole talked about how supportive Zende had been, and she said she might not be able to carry a child. Vivienne reasoned that Nicole already had a child. Vivienne said that Lizzy might belong to Nicole's sister, but Lizzy would always be Nicole's little girl. \"My little girl...my sweet little girl,\" Nicole responded, gazing at Lizzy.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge and Steffy deliberated his decision to fire Thomas. Steffy believed that they needed her brother, but Ridge said they had Zende. Ridge stated that Thomas was sleeping with the enemy. Steffy believed that the lengths Thomas had gone to proved how much he cared for Sally, and it sounded like something a young Ridge Forrester would do.\n\n\nRidge said he wouldn't have betrayed the company. Steffy thought it might be true, but in her view, Thomas didn't deserve firing. Ridge entertained the idea that he might have gone too far in his anger. Steffy asserted that it had gone too far, but she wouldn't let it go further. She felt that she was part of the problem because of her job as co-CEO. She decided that she was calling a meeting for the good of the family.\n\n\nAt Thomas' loft, Thomas awakened and greeted Sally, who was carrying two cups of coffee to the bed. He offered to order them some breakfast, but Sally said she had to get to work. Thomas had forgotten it was a workday and recalled that he'd been fired. She thanked him for supporting her band of misfits, but she wished he didn't have to be at odds with his family over it.\n\n\nThomas and Sally cuddled in bed, and Sally offered to call in sick to work. Thomas said she didn't have to, but she joked that it was the least she could do. Though he appreciated her willingness to mope around with him all day, he said he knew how much she wanted to get to work on Spectra. She insisted that they eventually try being sloths at least once. Thomas agreed. He added that he didn't like being at odds with his family or being fired by his father.\n\n\nLater, Thomas and Sally had dressed, and Thomas received a call. It was Steffy, who asked if he was free that day. \"I got fired, so what do you think?\" he quipped. Steffy said she'd called Eric for a meeting, and she wanted Thomas to attend to discuss that very topic. Thomas asked if their father would be there. She said Ridge would be, and Thomas said to forget it. Steffy implored him, and he finally replied, \"Fine.\"\n\n\n\n\nAfter the call, Sally said the Forresters probably wanted Thomas to return to work. Thomas murmured that they'd see about that.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Darlita thought they should send Thomas a fruit basket to thank him for what he'd done for them. Saul didn't think Thomas needed anything more in his perfect life. Shirley stated that Thomas had saved them and exposed Bill's sneaky real estate scheme. Darlita called Thomas their hero, but Saul didn't like it. Saul insisted that Thomas wasn't that great, and Thomas was using his money to move in on Sally.\n\n\nShirley told Saul to get used to Thomas being around. Saul said he didn't trust Thomas. Darlita liked the idea of having Thomas around and said Sally had one hot guy. Saul scowled.\n\n\nWhen Sally arrived, Darlita and Shirley gave her a hard time about finally showing up to work, about whether she'd worn the same clothes from previous day, and why she hadn't returned text messages from the previous night. Sally wasn't wearing the same clothes and apologized for not returning Darlita's messages. Shirley guessed Sally's hands had been too busy.\n\n\nDarlita hoped it was fun and hoped Sally hadn't gotten any sleep. Saul reminded the ladies that it was a workplace. Shirley asked how Thomas was, and Sally revealed that his father had fired him. The Spectra gang wondered what it meant for Thomas, and Saul hoped it meant that Thomas would open a shop in Paris.\n\n\nSally didn't know what was happening other than that the Forresters had invited Thomas to a meeting. Shirley wondered what would happen to the Spectra gang if the Forresters \"talked him into it.\" Sally guessed that it meant that Spectra would be finished, and so would she and Thomas. She concluded that she'd probably never see him again.\n\n\nSally believed that Thomas' family had wanted to meet with Thomas to talk him into not seeing her and removing his support from Spectra. Shirley said that they'd go under without Thomas' support. Saul replied that Thomas didn't own them, but Shirley asserted that Thomas was the reason they had jobs and a roof over their heads. \"Maybe we don't need him -- any of us,\" Saul replied, looking at Sally.\n\n\nSally said she could be wrong about what Thomas' family wanted. Saul believed that Forresters stuck with their own, and he said they shouldn't be surprised if Thomas left them high and dry. Sally stated that they'd find another way to survive. Shirley didn't know how and said Thomas was their only hope. She reminded Sally that she'd spent \"some of that dough\" on new sewing machines. Shirley asked how they'd pay it back.\n\n\nDarlita asked what would become of Sally and Thomas. Saul stated that Sally had been fine before Thomas and would be fine after him. \"You love him, don't you?\" Darlita asked. From Sally's expression, Darlita gleaned that it was true and said Sally couldn't lose Thomas.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, Eric arrived in the CEO's office. He was glad about the meeting and didn't want Ridge to ruin his relationship with Thomas. Eric believed that what Thomas had done had been wrong, but it hadn't warranted firing. Ridge stated that he'd been angry, and Eric replied that it had become a common occurrence with Ridge.\n\n\nSteffy said she'd thought Thomas' involvement with Sally had been because of Steffy and her position as CEO; however, Steffy concluded that the feelings were real between Sally and Thomas. Eric stated that one couldn't fire Thomas because he'd fallen in love with Sally Spectra. Ridge said it wasn't the reason, and Eric couldn't defend what Thomas had done.\n\n\nSteffy was anxious to get Thomas back and felt that the firing would push her brother toward Spectra even more. She was adamant about not letting it happen.\n\n\nBack in the corridor, Charlie, R.J., and Coco listened to Pam, who was sad that, according to the Internet, Lizzy couldn't eat lemon bars until age two. Thomas arrived. The others warmly greeted him, and R.J. said it wasn't the same without him. Pam let Thomas know that Ridge, Steffy, and Eric were waiting in the CEO's office.\n\n\nWhen Thomas went into the office for the meeting, he greeted Eric and Steffy. Ridge said it was good to see his son. \"You took my job, Dad. I don't know what you want me to say,\" Thomas replied. Steffy stated that Ridge had made a mistake, and they wanted Thomas back at work.\n\n\nEric felt that Sally should feel lucky that the Forresters hadn't put her in jail for what she'd done. He believed that Thomas had made a questionable decision. Glancing at Ridge, Eric added that there were a lot of those going around. Eric wanted Thomas back at work and said they needed his talent more than ever.\n\n\nSteffy agreed. She felt that the problem had gone on for far too long, and she was partially responsible because she hadn't kept her mouth shut about Bill's role in things. Steffy claimed she couldn't keep things from Thomas, and Thomas replied that he appreciated her honesty.\n\n\nSteffy admired Thomas' need to step in with Sally because of Bill, but Steffy felt there was no excuse for what Sally had done. Steffy said that the family cared about Thomas and wanted him at Forrester. Thomas asked if his father felt that way. Steffy replied that even their dad did. Eric asserted that it was where Thomas belonged. Steffy asked Thomas to say that he'd return to Forrester.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "With Vivienne by her side, Nicole pays Dr. March a visit to get a second opinion on Dr. Caspary's diagnosis. Dr. March calls the findings correct: even though Nicole's ovaries are intact, the scarring on her uterus will likely prevent her from having children under natural conditions. Vivienne soothes Nicole. Later, Nicole walks in on Pam, Charlie, R.J. and Coco fussing over Lizzie. Suddenly she takes the child as Vivienne watches on worried. As they awake, Sally is still miserable that Thomas is at odds with his family.
