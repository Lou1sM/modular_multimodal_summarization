They gushed about being in love, and Bill professed how much he loved seeing Brooke happy.\n\n\nBill said he had many surprises for Brooke, and he shared some exotic dishes with her. Brooke said that everything was heavenly. For dessert, Bill moved a dish and uncovered a black jewelry box that held an incredible piece of Arabic jewelry. \n\n\nBrooke thanked Bill for everything, and she raved about the breathtaking architecture and friendly people. Bill noted that they all paid attention to details, and he had been happy to share it with her. \"Thank you for bringing me here,\" Brooke said. Bill said it was the first stop on a lifelong journey.\n\n\nBill said he couldn't wait to put the really important piece of jewelry on her finger: a wedding ring. Brooke said she couldn't wait to become his wife. Bill and Brooke recalled romantic times together in Monte Carlo, mountain climbing, and more. Bill said he loved to see the look of wonder and delight on her face. Brooke was thankful that there were no other women waiting in the shadows. Bill said there would never be another woman for him.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn sent the email that included a picture of her with Bill in bed to Ridge. Wyatt entered and asked what Quinn had planned. Wyatt wanted to intercept any type of devious plan she had before it got out of control. Quinn coolly said she had nothing planned. She liked to study people. \n\n\nQuinn noted that she was fascinated that Ridge was so involved in Brooke's life even though he had been engaged to Katie. Quinn predicted that Brooke would dump Bill and end up back with Ridge. Wyatt warned that Bill would marry Brooke. Quinn disagreed. She advised Wyatt that she and Bill were not a traditional couple, but they belonged together. \n\n\nWyatt predicted that Quinn would get hurt. \"I can take care of myself,\" Quinn said. Wyatt advised her not to interfere in Brooke and Bill's romance. Quinn insisted that if Bill did marry Brooke, it would never last. \n\n\n\"Brooke is a romance junkie,\" Quinn said. She added that Brooke would not be enough woman for Bill. Quinn said that Brooke would never remain faithful. Wyatt said his father would never return to Quinn, but Quinn would not be deterred.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric entered Ridge's office, and they discussed Bill and Brooke's plans to marry. Ridge said he had to stop Brooke to save Brooke and his son from Bill. Eric said that Bill would not harm Brooke or R.J., but Ridge was unconvinced. \"I think you can't stand Brooke being married to anyone buy you,\" Eric said. \n\n\nRidge professed that he was with Katie, but he wanted to keep Bill Spencer away from R.J. Eric scoffed that Ridge could keep Brooke and Bill apart. Eric said that Brooke and Ridge belonged together, but they continued to marry other people. Ridge claimed there was dirt on Bill, and he intended to find it and reveal it to Brooke. Eric said Brooke wouldn't care. \n\n\nEric and Ridge embraced, and Eric left. Ridge sat down at his computer. He opened an email from Quinn and looked at the new jewelry designs. Ridge took notes on the pieces until he spotted the photo of Bill and Quinn in bed. Ridge stopped taking notes and looked surprised.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge vents to Eric about needing to get through to Brooke before the wedding. Wyatt again pleads with Quinn to stay out of Brooke and Bill\u2019s relationship. Brooke and Bill enjoy authentic Emirati cuisine at a private dinner on the beach. Bill gives Brooke a special, sparkly new gift. Ridge receives the ammunition he needs.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill and Brooke revel in their trip and all this adventure and fine dining in Dubai. He says an intimate setting is exceptional and he has a surprise for her. He explains all the dishes before they partake. He tells her that he likes her sense of wonderment and the look on her face and he likes putting it there. She finds a jewelry box under their dessert. She urges her to open it. It's a little something to commemorate their time here and would not forget. Wyatt tells Quinn that they need to talk. When that fevered brain of hers goes into overdrive the next thing they are in a big mess and he can't afford a big mess right now. He says he can see those wheels turning every time she looks at Ridge. He knows she is planning something, something devious and she needs to tell him right now so he can stop her. Quinn says she likes to observe human behavior; he knows that. And Ridge's reaction to Brooke marrying Bill is fascinating. He dumped Brooke and stayed away for a year and is now engaged to Katie yet he is still dictating her personal choices. She thinks Ridge and Bill should be getting married \u0096 two massive egos collide. She admits she does not want the marriage any more than Ridge does. Wyatt's father and her are not typical. The same things that repels them attracts them. It's kind of hard to wrap your head around it, but it happens every time they are together. And Bill should not be marrying anyone until they play that out to its natural conclusion. Marrying Brooke will be the biggest mistake of his life and she told him that. Wyatt says he is starting to worry about her. She is practical not delusional. She usually sees things very clearly except when it comes to his dad. She says she told him; they are not the norm so Wyatt can not judge them by ordinary criteria. Wyatt says she may feel that pull but it is not reciprocated and he hates to see her get hurt. She says he is sweet, but she can take care of herself. He warns her again and his dad and Brooke are getting married; may be already, so just let them be and do not interfere. She says maybe they will; maybe not. But even if Bill pulls it off, it won't last. She says she likes Brooke. She is no dumb blonde, but she is a romance junky with no staying power. And Wyatt's father is a different kind of animal and Brooke is not woman enough for him. Ridge joins Eric and Eric says he knows that look. It usually has Brooke on the other end of it. Ridge grouses that she is the most stubborn woman he knows. Eric wonders if this has anything to do with her marrying Bill Spencer. Ridge says she will not listen to him or anyone. And he declares he needs to find a way to stop this before she marries this clown. Eric says for someone engaged himself, he sure is invested in Brooke's marriage. Ridge says no, just Bill. He and Katie are solid. Eric says he doesn't want Brooke to marry Bill either but it's not his place to approve or disapprove and for Ridge either. Ridge says it is his place. His son is involved so he does have a say. Eric says he thinks Ridge just doesn't want Brooke married to anyone but him. Ridge reminds him that his son is involved, a young developing mind and he can't have him around that idiot. Brooke can find another man, a man of substance and integrity and that is not Spencer. He points out the way Bill manipulated Katie and how he's ready to do that again with Brooke and he will not let him slither his way back into his family. Eric says he is no fan of Bill's, but he doesn't think he has bad intent to Brooke or RJ. Ridge says there must be some way he can prove what a fraud Bill is. Brooke opens her present and finds a lovely large gold medallion necklace. She's speechless, a truly authentic Arabian piece. She's never seen anything like it. She thanks him as he slips it around her neck. He says he can't wait to put the most important piece of jewelry on her finger and that is her wedding ring. Wyatt warns his mother that she is setting herself up for a fall if she thinks Bill will leave Brooke now after months of pursuing her. She says she knows and it is unfortunate as she could have saved himself a lot of grief. Brooke is never going to be faithful to him; it is not in her genes. And Bill's ego is way too big to put up with the humiliation. She could have spared him the shame, humiliation and alimony. But maybe it's not too late. Eric asks Ridge if that is how the fight started. Ridge says Bill started talking about his position in his son's life and in Brooke's bed and somewhere in there everything went black and he hit him in the mouth. He realizes it was not the most mature time in his adult life and Brooke did get her ring back. But that shows Eric just how he feels. Eric says he knows how he feels. He still loves Brooke and she loves him. They may be with other people for a while, even marry them, but it's only temporary. He and Brooke belong together. Ridge says Eric is killing him. This is not about him and Brooke. This is about getting her away from Bill. Brooke keeps talking about how faithful Bill is, how patient and how he has proven he doesn't need other women, but inside he knows there is dirt on this guy. He just needs to figure out how to pin him down. Eric says maybe there is no dirt and he should just let this go. He honestly doesn't see any way he can stop this. He offers to do anything he can to help. Ridge gives him a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek and thanks him for listening. Ridge goes back to his laptop. Quinn tells Wyatt that he wants his parents back together, admit it. He says he always wondered why she had no boyfriends but now he knows she was holding out for his dad. She denies that; it's ridiculous. He says no, it's obvious she was reserving himself for Bill and she may have hated him for abandoning him but she cared for him deeply and still does. She scoffs that Hope has made a romantic out of him. She says the truth is Wyatt is the only guy she has ever loved. He says good because maybe it will dissuade her away from Bill. He is committed to Brooke and there is nothing Quinn can do to change that. Bill tells Brooke that he wants to give her the world. She says he has by chasing her around the world. She says but the greatest gift is his commitment to her. She doesn't have to worry about some woman lurking in the shadows trying to take him away. It's a new experience for her, to be secure in her man's love. Ridge opens the e-mail with Quinn's jewelry then spies the photo of her and Bill.",
