Steffy wondered why Eric continued to side with Rick, and Ridge said that Eric had inexplicably sided with Rick in many things. Rick had moved into Eric's house. Rick had treated people like garbage, and Ridge refused to take it any longer.\n\n\n\"If Dad doesn't want to do anything about it, I will,\" Ridge said. He maintained that they had to act quickly. \"It's got to be us,\" Ridge said. He added that he and Caroline would design, and Steffy would help run the company. \"We got to take Forrester back,\" Ridge said. Steffy agreed.\n\n\nRidge added that he knew Steffy had a thing for Liam, but she had to put that on hold. \"It can't interfere,\" Ridge said. Steffy agreed. She worried that Ridge had been unable to turn his back on his father previously. Ridge hated that he had to turn against his dad, but he said that would no longer be a problem. They had to save Forrester.\n\n\nRidge asked Steffy for her shares and her help. Steffy said that the first time she had returned, she'd expected to get back together with Liam, but she understood he was with Ivy. Steffy promised her loyalty to Ridge. Ridge asked if Steffy could handle it, and she agreed she could. \"Keep our eye on the end game,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Rick prepared for work, and Brooke wondered if Rick should return to the office so soon after his accident. Rick assured her he was ready. Brooke gushed that he had a strong work ethic, and Rick credited Brooke and Eric. He said he was thankful to Brooke and Eric for their support. Brooke said that she and Eric loved him and were very proud of him.\n\n\nRick noted that Eric's support for him could have gone either way. Brooke didn't know what he meant, but Rick said that Ridge had \"asked Dad to fire me so he could be CEO.\" Brooke was shocked, and she said it was inexcusable that Ridge was trying to take his job.\n\n\nRick added that Bill Spencer was at the root of all the recent problems. Rick blamed Bill for his treatment of Maya, and he added that Maya had never returned his phone calls. Rick gushed that Brooke and his dad were on his side. Rick promised not to give up on Maya.\n\n\nRick complained that Ridge had undermined every decision Rick had ever made. Rick mocked Ridge as a designer who did not understand business. \"Thank God you're still the man in charge,\" Brooke said. Rick added that he had told Eric that he blamed Ridge for breaking up their family.\n\n\n\"Ridge is devious,\" Rick added. Rick blamed Ridge as a home wrecker who had done the same thing with Caroline. \"He wrecked our future -- no remorse,\" Rick said. Brooke congratulated Rick for his business acumen. \"Eric has made it very clear he wants you in charge,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nRick admitted to Brooke that he was elated that Ridge would have to answer to Rick for the rest of his career at Forrester. Brooke didn't want Rick to stress because he was still recovering. Brooke encouraged him to take it easy. \"We're very proud of you, and we believe in you,\" Brooke said. Rick hugged his mom, and Brooke shed one single tear.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam told Ivy he couldn't think about anything but her. They teased one another, laughed, and made out. Bill and Katie entered and interrupted. Liam reminded Bill that he was still angry with Bill for exposing Maya. Bill argued, but Katie agreed it had been wrong. She worried about the image of Spencer. Bill defended himself and said he needed to shake it up.\n\n\nIvy changed the subject. \"Ridge could be the next CEO at Forrester,\" Ivy announced. Bill wondered what had happened to influence a change, and Ivy explained that Ridge was sick of Rick's treatment of everyone. Bill and Katie agreed that Rick's contract was irrevocable, but Ivy and Liam noted there was a morality clause that could push Rick out.\n\n\nBill said that Ridge would need Steffy's and Spencer's shares to take over. Liam agreed, and his phone rang. It was Ridge, who asked to meet with Liam at Forrester. Liam left for his meeting.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Ridge agreed that Rick deserved what he would be getting. Rick interrupted their meeting, and told them to get out of his office. Rick warned Ridge that their father was on Rick's side. \"No matter how many times you go crying to Dad -- it's always going to stay that way,\" Rick said. Rick reminded Ridge that he was not a Forrester. Ridge countered that Rick had shot up the office.\n\n\nRick warned that Ridge and Caroline had to approve everything through Rick. Steffy was angry. Ridge advised Rick to enjoy his desk. Ridge feigned that he would work to please Rick and their father.\n\n\nIn another office, Ridge and Steffy waited for Liam, and Steffy recalled her last trip to Los Angeles when she had made a play for Liam. She flashed back to Liam's comments that it would be wonderful to get together with Steffy again -- to be her husband and touch her again, but he was committed to Ivy. Steffy smiled at the memories. Liam entered and interrupted her thoughts. Ridge thanked Liam for meeting them, and Liam greeted Steffy. She explained that she was on board to take over Forrester without any conditions.\n\n\nRidge did have conditions. He did not want Bill anywhere near Forrester shares or decisions. Liam wondered if Ridge could turn against his father because he had been unable to do it previously. Ridge agreed he would jeopardize his relationship with his father because he had no options. Ridge pressured Liam for a decision to exclude Bill from the deal. Liam looked pensive.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Rick that he has always had a strong work ethic and she is glad his dad has been so supportive. He says he can't stay home anymore; he has to get back to work. All of this is Bill's fault for exposing Maya but he has not given up on her yet. But for the accident of him running off the road and then Ridge trying to take his position, he would still be with Maya. Brooke says she is sorry that Ridge took this opportunity to try to take Rick's job away from him. Rick says it is typical Ridge .take what he wants from anybody else no matter what they want. But this time his dad is on his side more than ever and there is nothing Ridge can do about it. Bill and Katie walk in on Liam and Ivy's frisky time. Bill wishes he had not seen that. Ivy says there is a chance that Ridge might be the next CEO. But first she would like to tell Bill that she goes on record that he should not have done what he did. He tells her jump on the bandwagon as Liam and Katie are mad at him too. In fact the whole world is. Liam says this is a case of the ends not justifying the means. Bill tells them to chill out; this is not his first rodeo. Katie reminds him that she is worried about the Spencer image and he should be too. Liam tells him about the morality clause but that Eric refuses to believe that Rick violated that. Ridge tells Steffy that he is tired of waiting for Eric to come to his senses. She agrees that he may never where Rick is concerned. Ridge says he and Caroline can design and she can help run the company. They can call the shots and put some dignity back into this company. He wants her to stay and not let Liam be a distraction to her. Rick tells Brooke that Ridge is still in the 90's and thinks his designs are the Holy Grail but he has no idea how business is run nowadays. Rick grouses all the bad things Ridge has done over the years, even taking Brooke away from Eric. She says she had some blame in that too. They hug as he says he is not forgetting Maya but he needs to get back to work and in the swing of things to keep busy. He appreciates her and Eric as they are all he has now. Steffy finally tells Ridge that she will sign on. This is what she needs. First time she had expectations but Liam is with Ivy so she can get over him and throw all her efforts into this. Ridge tells her this won't be easy but it will be worth it in the end. He calls Liam. Steffy says this time is different and they just need to keep their eye on the prize at the end. Rick comes in and is surprised to see Steffy but wishes they would not hang out in the CEO's office, his office. And it will remain as such no matter how many times Ridge goes crying to his dad. Rick even accuses him of not being a Forrester. He is a Marone and throws people away just like his bio dad did. He tells them to get out of his office and quit whining. And Ridge better check with him before continuing his artistic activities with Caroline. Bill says he wants to be there when Rick gets kicked out but Katie tells him not to get ahead of himself. Liam is surprised to see Steffy but says he is glad she is here. They explain that the talking to Eric did not work out. He is still on Team Rick and Ridge does not want to do this but he can not take it any longer. He wants to pull his resources. Steffy is in and now Liam but without Bill, he wants just Liam. He realizes he is jeopardizing his relationship with his father but he has no other options so he needs to know if Liam is in or out.",
