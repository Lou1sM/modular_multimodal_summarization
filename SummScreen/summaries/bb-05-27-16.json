Zende tells Eric and Viv that if Nicole can forgive him he would like to start where they left off. Being in the hospital when Nicole gave birth opened his eyes. Rick sees no obstacles but Zende says there is. Sasha says she is pregnant. Sasha does not like that Nicole and Maya are calling her a liar and vows she will not take the test. Maya says yes she will right now. Sasha says she does not have to do this. She already took one and it was positive. Finally she says okay as ridiculous as it is, she will do it. Nicole calls Zende and says they caught Sasha and she is taking a pregnancy test as they speak. He says he will be there in a few minutes. Rick wonders why Thomas is home and he says he is going on a trip. He does not know for how long but he is needed in China. Sasha meets up with a very pregnant woman outside the bathroom. The light bulb goes off in her head. She tells the lady to use the bathroom but just don't flush as they are doing maintenance. Rick blabs on Ridge and tells Eric that he is sending Thomas to China. Eric says that is a surprise but advises Rick to focus on his new baby and stop obsessing on Ridge. Rick returns to his baby and says she is a Forrester, not a Marone, and it is he that should be running Forrester, not Ridge. Caroline is not exactly following Ridge's reasoning of why Thomas is going to China. She wonders if there is another reason. Sasha is shocked they called Zende in on this and did not take her word. Maya asks if she took the test. Zende says they just want to know the truth. She hands him the stick. It shows nothing so she asks them to wait a few minutes. When she looks again she does see the results. Eric tells Rick that Ridge has proved his integrity and he has no intentions of replacing him. Caroline tells Ridge that she promised Thomas that he will be involved in Douglas's life. Ridge says he will, but only from a distance. He's already walking around calling Douglas his son and he cannot have that with perhaps Pam or someone else overhearing. Thomas comes in and holds Douglas one last time. He says he will miss him. Ridge does not want him holding him longer and takes him away. Caroline looks worried. Ridge says it had to be done.",
