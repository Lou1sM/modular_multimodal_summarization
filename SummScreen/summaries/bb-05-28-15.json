Katie asked how much it bothered Ivy that Steffy would become involved. Ivy was confident that Liam wouldn't agree to be with Steffy for the stock. Katie remarked that Forresters had a way of getting what they wanted. Ivy asserted that she was a Forrester, and she wanted Liam.\n\n\nIvy recalled that Steffy had thrown herself at Liam the last time she'd been in town, but Ivy and Liam were closer than ever. Ivy wasn't worried, but she didn't like someone hitting on her man. She felt that things would be fine as long as Steffy stayed in Europe.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Ridge and Steffy told Liam that Eric still supported Rick, and they needed the Spencer stock to protect the Forrester legacy. Liam asked if there were strings attached. Steffy said that his stock for her love was off the table. Ridge remarked that it was a shame for Liam and asked what Liam's answer was. Liam wondered what was in it for him.\n\n\nRidge offered Liam a position at Forrester. Ridge would be the CEO, Steffy would be the president, and Liam would be the vice-president. Liam was amazed that Ridge would trust a Spencer. Ridge said he trusted Liam. Liam asked if Steffy realized that they would work closely together. Steffy asked if he had a problem with it, but Ridge and Liam wanted to know if she did.\n\n\nSteffy touted that she, Liam, and her father wouldn't even be there if she hadn't gotten the company back from Bill Spencer. Liam didn't doubt her business prowess. She playfully accused Liam of suggesting that he was too irresistible for her to concentrate on her work. She insisted that Liam had \"what's her name,\" she'd have her work, and they'd have the company. Liam decided that he was in.\n\n\nLiam and Ridge shook hands, and Ridge said no one could know about it until they were ready to strike. Ridge was worried about how Eric would react, but Steffy said Eric had put himself in the situation. Ridge left, saying he had to talk to someone.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy joked and chatted about working together. He asked if they could handle it. \"As long as you know who the boss is,\" she quipped. Liam joked that she outranked Liam everywhere -- like the bathroom counter, the closets, and the side of the bed.\n\n\nThey laughed together, and Steffy asked if Liam thought they could do it. Liam didn't know because they'd never done anything like it before. Steffy believed they'd be fabulous, and he noted that she'd changed. It was refreshing, like a cool mountain stream. A flashback played of the two kissing in a stream. Steffy remarked that a cool mountain stream was a nice image.\n\n\nLiam said he hadn't been in Aspen in a while, and Steffy doubted he'd go anytime soon. Liam said he'd missed her, and she was surprised to hear it due to what had happened on her last visit. He recalled that she'd been a little needy, but she said jumping him on the couch didn't make her needy. She joked that it was hunger. Liam asked if anyone had satisfied the hunger.\n\n\nSteffy said that no one had satisfied her hunger, but she'd be completely about business with Liam. She asked if that disappointed him, but he thought it was a trick question.\n\n\nOutside the door, Ivy approached and listened as Steffy said that Liam's goodness had made her a better person. Liam had been the great love of Steffy's life, and he always would be.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick was on a call, asking someone to stay on getting Maya's contact information. He said Maya had to contact them because she was due a paycheck. Carter entered and guessed Rick hadn't heard from Maya. Rick said that he loved Maya and would like to know if Carter had heard from her. Carter hadn't heard from her and suggested that Rick hire someone to find her.\n\n\nRick didn't want to force himself on Maya, and he couldn't do anything if she didn't want to see him. Carter admired Rick's reaction to things. Rick said he understood Carter's reaction, but Maya had always been Rick's love, no matter her past. Carter said he'd wanted to tell Rick, but Rick was okay that Carter hadn't. Rick felt that Maya had told him in the best way.\n\n\nRick wished he'd learned about it before everyone else. Carter and Rick discussed Ridge wanting to be CEO. Rick said that his father was in his corner. Carter replied that it was huge, but Rick wondered if it was enough.\n\n\nRick couldn't believe Ridge's nerve in trying to take Rick's job. Carter asked what would happen with Ridge and the company. Rick remarked that Ridge was the designer who needed stroking and coddling, but Ridge had to learn his place because Rick couldn't stand betrayal. Claiming that he'd had to be a \"hard ass\" while taking control of the company, Rick said he'd be less abrasive going forward.\n\n\nRick was sure that Ridge would still be difficult, and Ridge had to learn that if he went against Rick, he'd be squashed every time. Carter advised that it would be better for the men to work together. Rick believed it would be just fine if Ridge would take orders, but the entitled Ridge didn't do that.\n\n\nCarter relayed that Ridge was the oldest son. \"Of Massimo Marone,\" Rick noted. Rick said that Thorne was his oldest sibling and knew his place. Rick stated that Ridge was talented but didn't have the skill set to be CEO. Carter said one caught more flies with honey, but Rick claimed to have tried honey.\n\n\nRick felt that Ridge's problem was Stephanie, who'd believed that he could do no wrong. Rick believed that Ridge couldn't stand that someone had been elevated over him or that it had been Rick, whom Ridge hated. Carter didn't think Ridge hated Rick.\n\n\nRick claimed that Ridge didn't treat him like a brother, but then Rick guessed it went both ways. Rick declared that it was a brand new day at Forrester; Ridge would accept it or be out.\n\n\nLater, Rick was alone, grinning at his success. He left Maya another message to say that Ridge had tried a takeover, but it hadn't worked because Eric had backed Rick. Rick said he had everything he ever wanted -- except what mattered most. He said he loved her and asked her to call back.\n\n\nLater, Ridge arrived in a storage room at the Forrester mansion. He slipped a cover off Stephanie's portrait. He didn't like her gathering dust and felt she shouldn't be in there at all. Ridge told the portrait that \"change was coming,\" and what she'd wanted for him was finally about to happen.\n\n\nRidge recalled that Stephanie had always been the family leader, and that was why he was visiting her. He said his father was being bullheaded and stubborn. Ridge didn't want to hurt Eric, but the company wouldn't survive if Ridge didn't take action and put Stephanie back on the wall where she belonged. Ridge wanted her there because he felt that Eric would need her more than ever after the takeover.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy says it is not easy on either of them. But Eric will not see that Rick is not the right man for the job so it is up to Liam. And there will be no stipulations, that is off the table. They need Spencer's shares. Rick and Carter are worried about Maya as he has been texting her but she has not even come for her paycheck. They doubt she has left town. But Rick will not force himself on her if she does not want to see him. He still loves her. Carter says he understands. He knows it has been a tough time for him since everyone else knew but Rick. Ivy and Katie discuss the hostile takeover and how much it might bother Ivy that Steffy is now involved. Without Steffy's stock there is no takeover. Ivy says she and Liam are great so she is not worried about Steffy as long as she stays in Paris. Ridge tells Liam that 50% is not enough so they need Liam's 15% so what is it going to take for him to get into the fold. He wants to know what they are offering, what is in it for him. Ridge says he would be CEO, Steffy would be President and Liam could be VP, they would be okay with a Spencer in the fold. No one must hear about this. He has someone to talk to. Rick tells Carter that he and Ridge will get along as long as he takes orders but he feels entitled. He was the anointed one by his mother, Stephanie, and he can not stand someone else is in a higher position than him. It's a brand new day here and he now needs to accept it or he is out. Ridge goes to a room where he uncovers his mom's portrait and says it is too dusty in here, he does not like it at all but change is coming. What she always wanted for him is about to happen. He is about to take over FC. He laments that he knows he is betraying his dad because he is being so stubborn and bullheaded. Eric will need her more than ever back on that wall where she belongs to look over everyone. Liam tells Steffy that she can do anything she wants and she knows it. They end up teasing each other about who outranks who and he says it is not one of her saving graces. She thinks they can be fabulous together. He says she has changed and he is looking forward to working with her. Rick calls Maya again and says Ridge tried to pull a coup again and it seems like he has everything he ever wanted except her. He wants her back so please call him. Liam tells Steffy that he is glad she is back. She was a little needy in the past. She says not to worry as she is going to be completely business this time and there is no one on the horizon. As Ivy approaches within hearing distance Steffy says they had some really good memories and she loves him and always will and she is not afraid to admit that. Ivy looks away.",
