    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the darkened Forrester jet, Ridge headed out of the country. He stared at Quinn's picture on his tablet and tightened his jaw. Ridge called Katie, who was doing laundry at home, to let her know he'd gone on a trip. Katie assumed he meant a business trip, but he said she probably wouldn't be happy because it wasn't business.\n\n\nRidge decided to send Katie something, and he said that once Brooke saw it, she'd call off her wedding. Katie realized that Ridge was headed to the Middle East to stop the wedding.\n\n\nKatie was shocked when she received the picture of Bill and Quinn. Exclaiming that Bill hated Quinn, Katie wondered when the picture had been taken. Ridge replied that Quinn had unintentionally sent him the contemporary photo.\n\n\nKatie asked if Quinn had \"unintentionally\" taken it, too. Sure that Quinn was playing Ridge, Katie offered to send Brooke the photo so that Brooke could decide for herself. Ridge refused because he was sure Bill would talk his way out of it. Ridge figured that Bill would call the picture a fake or say that Quinn had slipped up beside him as he'd slept.\n\n\nKatie didn't know what Bill would do, but she didn't understand why Ridge had to fly halfway around the world to show Brooke a selfie. \"Well, Brooke needs me. And she needs you, too,\" Ridge responded. He said the sisters loved each other, and he loved Brooke, too -- \"not in that way.\" He was determined to get Brooke home and certain that she'd go with him upon learning who Bill really was.\n\n\nKatie bitterly told Ridge to do what he needed to do and stop the wedding. Ridge said that he was sorry, but he couldn't allow Bill to be in R.J.'s life. Ridge said that he loved her. \"I love you, t -- \" Katie said, but Ridge had already clicked off the line.\n\n\nRidge stared at Quinn's compromising picture again. He flipped to the next photo in the gallery. It was Brooke on a horse during his first wedding to her. He smiled sadly and flashed back to that day. \"I'm coming, Logan,\" he said aloud. Ridge then flashed back to returning to Brooke after he'd been in Paris. The pilot alerted Ridge that they'd be landing, and Ridge asked that the helicopter be waiting.\n\n\nOn a beach in Abu Dhabi, Bill walked around the wedding canopy at the ceremony site, checking last-minute details. He told the coordinator that he wanted everything to be perfect.\n\n\nIn a hotel suite, the robed Brooke marveled at her ring. \"This time, I'm sure. This time will be my last,\" she uttered, smiling. Bill entered, and she said it was bad luck for him to see her before the wedding. Bill contended that his bad luck had ended the day she'd agreed to be his bride.\n\n\nBill advised Brooke that Malikah would arrive to assist Brooke. Brooke frowned. She said she wasn't used to be taken care of. Usually, it was she who \"pushed the cart up the hill\" in her relationships. With Bill, she felt as if he was there for her and caring for her as if she was the only one.\n\n\nBrooke wondered when Bill would get dressed or what she'd wear. Bill had a dress for her, but she questioned whether it was bad luck for the groom to pick out the gown. He hoped not, because it was the only gown she'd get. Malikah arrived to help Brooke prepare. Touching their foreheads together, Brooke and Bill were excited that, \"the next time we see each other...\"\n\n\nAs Malikah prepared Brooke for the ceremony, Bill checked on the event site once more before heading inside to get dressed. He returned in a blue suit and no shoes. Brooke appeared before the garden pools in her white, beaded, Arabian wedding garb.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Wyatt asked what Quinn meant by saying Ridge had left town. Though Wyatt joked that Ridge had to be running guns or drugs again, Wyatt was upset because he'd been working overtime to revamp the collection that Ridge hadn't liked. Quinn guessed that something had taken priority over it. \"He didn't happen to go to Abu Dhabi, did he?\" Wyatt asked.\n\n\nWyatt pressed to know if Quinn had shown Ridge the picture, but Quinn replied that the picture had a mind of its own. \"It refused to be hidden,\" she claimed. Wyatt wondered how Quinn could do it to their jobs and to him. He was worried that it could be the last straw with Hope. Quinn said it didn't involve Hope or Wyatt or have anything to do with them.\n\n\nQuinn insisted that Brooke didn't have the stomach, heart, or brains for a life with Bill. Wyatt thought it was for Bill to decide, but Quinn said the ball wasn't in Bill's court. Wyatt asked what person hacked into emails, trapped people in elevators, forged notes, and sent off compromising photos. Quinn replied that she did. \"You and criminals!\" Wyatt exclaimed.\n\n\nQuinn cited that she hadn't broken any laws -- unlike someone she knew. Wyatt told her that was a low blow. He didn't even think he'd marry into his own family, and he was sure that, after Hope learned what Quinn had done, Hope wouldn't want to, either. Quinn was shocked that he was ashamed of her, but he said he wouldn't have to be if she'd be \"that much\" ashamed of herself.\n\n\nJust then, Eric entered to have a word with Quinn. Quinn said that Wyatt could stay, and she had no secrets from Wyatt because he kept finding them out. Eric questioned Quinn about her relationship with Bill, and she admitted her fault in sending the picture. She said she'd been preoccupied with how Brooke would feel if she knew about Bill and Quinn, but it hadn't been Quinn's business to send the photo to Brooke.\n\n\nEric agreed that the last statement was true. He said he thought there had been acrimony between Quinn and Bill. Quinn stated that since she and Eric had broken up, she'd been lonely and had allowed herself to be Bill's second choice. Quinn hoped it didn't jeopardize her or Wyatt's jobs, and Eric said it was a private matter involving someone who didn't even work there.\n\n\nEric felt that Quinn's choices outside the building were her own. He also felt that Ridge had forgotten that he belonged with Brooke. \"Maybe this will remind him,\" Eric concluded.\n\n\nEric left, and Wyatt quipped that Quinn sure knew how to handle Eric. Wyatt noted that he and his mother hadn't discussed much about good and bad as he'd grown up. Quinn groaned but agreed that she hadn't taught him the difference between right and wrong. Instead, she'd taught him other people's \"ideas\" of it and had left it up to him to discover the value of it on his own.\n\n\nWyatt said he'd never done much of that until \"this year.\" Quinn guessed that he disapproved of her. He said that he would if he didn't understand that she was in love. Quinn became disappointed that he saw her as such a clich\u00e9. She said that others lied and cheated all the time to get what they wanted, and she asked why she shouldn't get something.\n\n\nQuinn claimed not to be asking for much. She'd just wanted a couple of hours a month, and Bill could do whatever else he wanted with his time. Though love was good for some people, a love/hate connection was perfect for Quinn. She felt that if she had a husband that she had to attend to and defer to, \"I'd have to shoot him.\" \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill checks with Aadila to be sure there is no realm of rain expected today or even sandstorms to kick up around the wedding site. She understands that he wants things to be perfect and they are trying to be sure it will be. Wyatt doesn't understand what Quinn means that Ridge is not here. He quips that if he is running drugs again like an arms dealers if he had to leave the country. Quinn says she does not believe it was a law enforcement issue, but this took priority over their re-tooling the collection he did not like. Quinn evades his question when he asks just exactly what country he's in. She says Ridge does not leave his itinerary with her. Wyatt guesses that he might just happen to be in Dubai. Quinn says Wyatt knows he was opposed to that marriage. Wyatt says yes but others were too and they are not hopping on a jet to get there to stop it. He wants to know if she showed him that picture of her and Bill. That would light a fire under him. She grins that it had a mind of it's own and it refused to be hidden. Ridge calls Katie and says he did not stop at home last night as he knew she would be unhappy. She assumes it is business and says it is fine. He says not business and he needs to send her something for her to see. It will be in an e-mail and shows Bill not to be the person that Brooke thinks he is. She says Brooke is in the Middle East; is that where he is going too. He says yes, to stop the wedding. Bill goes to Brooke's suite and she asks where he has been .although it is bad luck to see her on the wedding day. He says his bad luck is done. It ended the day she said yes. He says Malikah will be along any minute and help her with getting ready. She says she can't get used to this as she is the one who is usually pushing the cart up the hill and she never knew how hard she was working until she stopped. But with Bill it is different. She feels he is there for her, taking care of her and she is the only one. Katie gets the picture that Ridge sent and says Quinn is playing him. She'd like to send the picture to Brooke. Ridge asks her not to as Bill will only talk his way out of it. He will say it is fake or Quinn slipped in his bed while he was sleeping. Katie says maybe, maybe not but she still can not understand why he would fly half away around the world. He says Brooke needs him and she needs her sister too; she loves her. He says he loves Brooke too but not in that way. He just can't let her walk blindly into a future with that lowlife and liar. He is going to bring Brooke home. Reluctantly she says go, stop the wedding if he can and bring Brooke home. Bill hands Brooke over to Malikah and says the next time he sees Brooke, they will be .Wyatt is furious with his mother. He asks how she can do this. Brooke is going to come back and it will be off with their heads and Eric will go along with her. How could Quinn do this to him and Hope; did she even think of that being the last straw? She says no because it does not concern either him or Hope. He says it does her mother if she ruins that. Quinn says she is not ruining it, she is trying to wise her up. She says she actually likes Brooke but 100% her assets are visible to the naked eye. She does not have the stomach or heart, let alone the brains for a life with Wyatt's father. Wyatt says that is for him to decide. What kind of person breaks into e-mails, forges notes and traps people in an elevator and then sends compromising pictures to people. It's Quinn and criminals. She says no, she hasn't broken any laws, unlike him. He tells her that is low. She says no, right has been on her side each and every time. He rants that even he would not want to marry into this family, and when Hope finds out what Quinn did she won't either. She asks if he is ashamed of her. He says he wouldn't have to be if she were more ashamed herself. She says she let that go as long time ago. Eric comes in and tells Wyatt that he'd like a word with his mother. Quinn says it is okay. Wyatt can stay; she has no secrets from him as he keeps finding them out. Eric starts off with her and Bill Spencer. Quinn admits it was careless of her to send the picture to Ridge but in all honesty it was on her mind how Brooke would feel if she knew. She didn't send the pix to Brooke as that was none of her business. Eric says he thought there was bad blood between her and Spencer. She says they are not the most forgiving people but they are both passionate and since nothing developed between her and Eric, she was lonely and she allowed herself to fill the role of Bill's second choice. She hopes this does not jeopardize her or Wyatt's job here at FC. Eric says that is private business between her and someone who does not even work there. The choices she makes outside this building are hers and one thing has nothing to do with the other. He ends that maybe this will give Brooke a chance to think twice about marrying this man. She belongs with Ridge although he seems to have forgotten. Maybe this will remind him. Ridge thinks back on his and Brooke's former weddings and says he is coming, Logan! Bill excuses himself to go get ready and leaves Brooke with Malikah to help her. Wyatt tells his mother that she sure knows how to handle Eric. She says he is the source of their paycheck so that is not a bad thing. He hesitates but says they never talked much about good and bad growing up. She wonders if it has come to this, the sad story of how she neglected his moral education. He says he wished she would have neglected him just a little bit more. She admits she did not teach him the difference in right from wrong; only other people's ideas and that is all it is \u0096 ideas. If there is any refining to be done, if there is any value to be discovered in the mist then that is for Wyatt to discover on his own. He says he never did much of that until this year. And he would disapprove of Quinn if he didn't know that she was in love. She says she is so disappointed that he sees her as just a cliche. He says okay, then give him another reason she sent that selfie and it has nothing to do with the truth. She says hmmmmm, other people lie and cheat all the time to get something they want and never look back. So she should get something. And she is not asking for much; just a couple of hours a month. And Bill can do whatever he wants with his time. Love is good for most people but a love/hate connection is perfect for her. She says but if she had a husband she had to defer to or pay attention to, she'd have to shoot him. Ridge talks to his pilot and reminds him to call ahead and have a helicopter waiting. Bill waits for his bride as Brooke walks the long walk to the tent.",
