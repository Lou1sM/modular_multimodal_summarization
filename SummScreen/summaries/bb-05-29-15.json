Nicole entered and asked to talk to Rick about Maya. Rick and Eric expressed concern for Maya. Eric said Maya hadn't needed to quit the way she had.\n\n\nEric left, and Rick asked why Maya wasn't answering his calls. Nicole felt that Rick had been good to her and had given her a job. Even though, in her mind, it was all over, she needed to know why Rick had become embarrassed once everyone had learned about Maya. \"I was angry,\" he said, shrugging. Nicole said that Maya believed he was angry with Maya, but Rick indicated that it wasn't so.\n\n\nNicole wanted to know why he'd broken up with Maya if he wasn't ashamed or angry. Rick revealed that he hadn't left Maya; Maya had left him. He stated that he'd said a lot of things he wished he hadn't, but it wasn't over. Nicole indicated that Maya thought it was. He insisted it was why he needed to find Maya and asked where Maya was.\n\n\nNicole claimed that Maya had told her to stay out of it. Rick figured Nicole wanted to help, or she wouldn't be in his office. Nicole wanted to understand what had happened. Rick said he'd proposed to Maya. He felt that his PR department could squash the news stories, and he and Maya needed to focus on each other. Nicole was surprised that Rick still wanted Maya after he'd \"hung up\" on her.\n\n\nRick asked when he'd done that, and Nicole explained what Maya thought had transpired on the last phone call Rick had had with Maya. \"I didn't hang up. I got in a car accident!\" Rick exclaimed. Rick recalled everything that had happened during the car pursuit of Maya up to the point where he'd run off the road. He said Maya didn't seem to want anything to do with him.\n\n\nNicole claimed that Maya had been hurt by the embarrassment remark, but Rick said he'd been referring to what Bill Spencer had done. \"No, you weren't,\" Nicole replied. Rick exclaimed that he hadn't meant it, and he wanted and needed Maya. He implored Nicole to say where Maya was. Nicole hoped she didn't regret it, and she revealed that Maya was at her old place above Dayzee's.\n\n\nAt the apartment above Dayzee's, Maya packed clothes into a bag. Carter knocked on the door and said he knew that Maya was in there. She opened the door, and Carter said he'd known the barista had been lying. Maya didn't want anyone knowing she was there. Carter replied that if he'd figured it out, Rick would, too. She stated that she couldn't be there much longer, and she was leaving Los Angeles.\n\n\nCarter stated that the city was Maya's home, and with her face all over the Internet, she couldn't run away from \"this.\" Maya felt that she wasn't a scandal and deserved to be treated better. Guessing it was why she hadn't talked to Rick, Carter asked if she was angry with Rick. Maya wasn't. She loved Rick too much to be angry.\n\n\nLater, Maya was explaining to Carter how Rick had \"hung up\" on her, and Carter said it didn't make any sense because Rick was still trying to get in touch with her. Maya believed that Rick just wanted to explain, but she didn't need it. She figured if they could have kept it quiet, things might have been different. Carter asserted that Rick cared about Maya and really loved her.\n\n\nMaya said Rick hadn't signed up for all of it, and she'd known that someday, it could go wrong. Falling in love with a public figure had been a huge risk that she hadn't been sure she could take, but Rick had made her happy. Carter asked why she was giving up and quitting her job. She claimed Rick had been through a lot, too, and the news story would die if no one fanned the flames.\n\n\nCarter told Maya that Rick was looking for her. Maya figured it was because Rick didn't like how they'd left things; however, Rick didn't really want to marry her, and it was over. Carter asked her not to leave, but she said she couldn't stay there. He wanted to know where she'd go. She claimed not to know, but he was sure she wouldn't tell him if she did know.\n\n\nMaya refused to put herself in the position of being around people who didn't accept her. She had to go elsewhere and start over because it was too painful to be around Rick without being his wife.\n\n\nLater, Maya was alone, remembering her times with Rick. Rick was at his office, having the same memories. He reached for the phone, but grinning, he rushed out of the office.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Nicole encountered Carter. She said she'd just spoken to Rick about Maya. Carter revealed that he'd seen Maya at Dayzee's. Nicole stated that she'd told Rick where to find Maya and hoped it had been the right thing to do.\n\n\nBack at Dayzee's, Maya was in the restaurant, remembering Rick taking her order for the first time. She looked down as a waiter approached. \"Welcome to Dayzee's. What can I get you?\" she heard Rick ask. She looked up and saw him dressed just as he had been the first time they'd met.\n\n\nOutside Rick's old office, Ivy listened as Steffy said she'd gone to Paris to hide her feelings for Liam, but for the new venture to work, they had to be completely open and honest with each other. Ivy entered and asked what was going on. Steffy stated that Ridge had said not to tell anyone. \"He didn't mean Ivy,\" Liam stated. Shrugging, Steffy announced that the plan was back on.\n\n\n\"So much for keeping it quiet,\" Ridge said upon entering. Liam indicated that Ivy had known about the plan before Ridge had known. Ivy asked what had happened to the morality clause, and Ridge said Eric hadn't used it. Ivy assumed that meant the Forresters and Spencers had combined their stock.\n\n\nSteffy stated that 62 percent of the stock gave them complete control. Ridge added that Steffy was the new president, and Liam was the vice president. Ridge said they needed to move on it, and Ivy decided to leave the three to talk. Ridge put in a call to Eric and asked him to meet at the office.\n\n\nLiam assumed that everyone should leave Ridge to talk to Eric alone, but Ridge wanted everyone there so that Eric could see that it wasn't about Ridge. It was about protecting the family legacy. Steffy remarked that she missed her grandmother. Ridge was sure that Stephanie would be on their side, and though their actions might seem hostile, it was right for everyone.\n\n\nEric arrived and was happy to see Steffy. As he hugged her, he said he hadn't known she was in town. She remarked that she was back for good, and Ridge added that it was what they wanted to discuss with Eric. Eric was excited to have Steffy back in PR to handle the press, but Ridge said she wouldn't be doing that. Eric was fine with it as long as she ran her ideas by Rick, who had to approve them. \"Not with this, no,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nEric said that Ridge knew where Eric stood on things. Ridge stated that Eric supported Rick above all else, and they understood it. Eric uttered that he didn't want to fight about it anymore. Ridge didn't like being at odds, either, and he recalled that they'd once been the best team in the business. Ridge said that what Rick was doing to Eric and the company was killing Ridge.\n\n\nEric told Ridge that he had to stop it and look at the reality of the situation. Ridge said he didn't. Eric stated that Ridge had made himself clear, but there was nothing else Ridge could do. Ridge replied that it wasn't true. Ridge revealed that he had Thomas' proxy, Steffy would vote with Ridge, and so would Liam. \"I see,\" Eric stated. He noted that Liam wasn't a stockholder, though.\n\n\nLiam stated that he controlled Spencer's stocks. Ridge said he hadn't wanted it get down to what it had. Eric replied that Ridge wouldn't do it. Ridge said he'd asked Eric to terminate Rick, but Eric had refused. Liam added that Rick had mistreated Caroline and Ivy. Ridge declared that they owned 62.5 percent of the company, and they wanted to protect its future.\n\n\nEric didn't see how Ridge could do it. Ridge asserted that he was overruling Eric, and Rick's tenure as CEO had just ended. Eric rasped that he decided who ran the company. \"No, you don't decide, Dad! We decide!\" Ridge roared back. Eric said Ridge couldn't do it, but Ridge insisted that Eric was making Ridge do it. Ridge was grateful for what Eric had taught him and for the legacy.\n\n\nEric shook his head as Ridge stated that it was time for a change in leadership. \"Rick's time is over. Your time is over,\" Ridge said.\n\n\n",

Ridge tried to force him out but he's still here ..although he has still not heard from Maya. Eric is sorry, but Rick says he is not ready to give up yet. Nicole comes in and says she'd like to talk to Rick about Maya. Carter knocks on Maya's door and asks her to open up. She does open it but says she does not want anyone to know she is there, not Rick or the press. Carter says he figured out this is where she started out with Rick so it's only a matter of time before Rick will figure it out too. He notices her bags and she says she is leaving Los Angeles. He states that she can not leave, her life is here. She can not run away from this. She says she is not a scandal and she will not be treated as one. She is better than that. She is still in love with Rick so she is not mad at him. Carter says Rick still loves her and is not embarrassed and is still trying to reach her so he can not believe that Rick turned his back on her. Maya says Rick does not want to marry her so it's over. Eric leaves Rick alone so he can talk to Nicole. She says Rick was good to her and took her in so she only has one question ..if he is not embarrassed and still loves Maya why did he leave her. Rick sets her straight that it was Maya that left him. Rick wants her to fill him in on where Maya is. Then he explains that he did not hang up on Maya. He ran off the road in an accident and the phone went dead. Ridge tells Liam and Steffy that Rick will be gone for good now. Steffy says with 62 1/2% that is all they need to take over as Eric did not want to use the morality clause. Ivy wishes them good luck. Ridge calls his dad to come to the office. Carter begs Maya not to leave. She says she grew up her entire life around people who did not accept her and she can not do that again. It is too painful so she needs to start over. Rick explains to Nicole how it all happened and how he ran off the road while talking to Maya. She thinks things changed and he did not want her. Now she wants nothing to do with him. Nicole said Maya was hurt and she thinks Rick does not love her. He begs her to tell him where she is as he does still love her. Nicole finally tells him that she is in her old place above Dayzee's. Eric is thrilled to see Steffy as he did not know she was back in town. Ridge says that is the reason they are all here and what they want to talk to him about. Maya relives her initial meeting with Rick and then the recent one at the cabin. Based on new information, Rick dashes off. Carter spies Nicole and she tells him she just told Rick where Maya is. She just hopes she said the right thing. Maya sits at a table and a guy walks up and asks what can he get her? She looks up and sees Rick. Rick tells Ridge that he knows where he stands on all of this. He does not want to fight about this. Ridge says he doesn't either. They were a team once, the best in the business .the place that his mother and him started and he does not want to see it destroyed. Eric says he has made his view clear but there is nothing Ridge can do. Ridge says there is .Liam and Steffy are going to vote with him .Liam says he owns no stock but he controls the Spencer stock. They tell him they own 62 1/2% of this company and Rick's tenure just ended. Eric says no he can't do that. Ridge says his dad has left him with no choice. He is grateful for how Eric ran this company but it ends now. Rick's time is over. Eric's time is over.",
