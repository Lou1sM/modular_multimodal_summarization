    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Vivienne was sure Nicole would get through. Nicole assumed it meant she'd get used to the idea of never having her own child. Vivienne reminded Nicole that the doctor hadn't said it would never happen. Nicole recounted that two doctors had said she was scarred and infertile, and it was all because she'd brought the angel Lizzy into the world.\n\n\nIn a hotel room in Paris, Maya gleefully showed off pictures of Lizzy to the room attendant. Afterward, Maya got on her laptop to work out Lizzy's schedule so that no one would get overburdened with Lizzy's care. Rick wished his mom was available.\n\n\nMaya called Vivienne to see if she could handle Lizzy for a day to or two. When Vivienne answered, Maya explained that she and Rick might be overseas for another week because the fashion shoot had expanded. Vivienne incredulously repeated the time frame. Maya said she'd been calling around frantically to get people to help take care of Lizzy. She remarked that Pam and Coco had been lifesavers.\n\n\nVivienne conveyed that she was trying to not take it personally that Maya would turn to other women instead of her own mother. Giggling, Maya replied that it was why she was calling -- to ask her mom for help. Vivienne asked if the photo shoot was that important. To Vivienne, it seemed to be a great opportunity. \"Hand me that phone,\" Nicole said, reaching for her mother's cell phone.\n\n\nMaya sounded surprised when the voice on the line changed to her sister's. Nicole asked what it was that she was hearing about the photo shoot. Maya replied that Nicole wouldn't believe it. Cynically, Nicole said she was sure it had to be epic to keep Maya from her baby.\n\n\nMaya said being away from Lizzy was the hardest part, but Nicole would be blown away when she saw the pictures. Maya told her sister to imagine Forrester gowns at historic landmarks. She believed it would be huge for her and for Forrester.\n\n\n\"Wow,\" Nicole mirthlessly replied, adding, \"Worth every sacrifice, I'm sure.\" Maya thought it would be for the coverage, but she hoped she wasn't asking too much of Nicole. Nicole replied that it wasn't at all too much to ask to take care of Lizzy.\n\n\nMaya started giggling, and Nicole asked if what she'd said had been funny. Maya was giggling because of Rick, who was nibbling at her neck. She told him to give her a minute because she was on the phone. Nicole seemed to be getting an attitude as Maya said Nicole should see the glass of wine Rick was pouring.\n\n\n\"Well, I should get back to Lizzy. She's getting tired,\" Nicole said in a snippy tone. Maya thanked Nicole for watching the baby and started to say that she could find someone else if it ever became a hassle; however, Nicole cut Maya off, saying it never would.\n\n\nMaya asked if something was wrong because Nicole sounded stressed. Nicole claimed to be fine and said that Maya could enjoy modeling at the Eiffel Tower -- or wherever -- because Nicole had things completely under control. Maya asked if Nicole was sure. \"Do your thing, Maya. Lizzy's in good hands,\" Nicole asserted and clicked off the line.\n\n\nAfter the call, Nicole griped to Vivienne about Maya calling around to ask other people to watch Lizzy. Vivienne replied that she hadn't wanted to feel insulted, \"but...\" Nicole said it was exactly that: insulting. Vivienne explained that Maya hadn't wanted to burden them because they worked so hard. Nicole said \"this child\" wasn't a burden, at least not to Nicole.\n\n\nNicole stated that she loved Lizzy, and Vivienne replied that they all knew it. Nicole sensed that her mother was worried about her. Vivienne said it had been a difficult day. Sighing, Nicole agreed that it had been. She thought her mother felt that she was being too emotional, but Vivienne said there was no such thing as being too emotional about the news Nicole had gotten.\n\n\n\"Maybe it wouldn't be so hard if I hadn't already given...And now Maya's in Paris, taking pictures,\" Nicole stated. She asked how being some modeling star could be more important to Maya at that time. Vivienne didn't believe it was, but Nicole said it seemed like it. Nicole didn't know what was going on with her that day.\n\n\nVivienne responded that Nicole was understandably hurting. Nicole expressed that she'd never questioned the ability to have another child. She said that her father might have been right when he'd said that she shouldn't have given Lizzy away.\n\n\nIn Paris, Maya was unsettled by the call with Nicole. Maya told Rick that it was as if Nicole had tried to make Maya feel guilty for being away. Rick thought that Maya might be projecting her own guilt onto what others were saying.\n\n\nMaya hoped that Rick was right, but she was unable to shake Nicole's tone. It reminded her of when Nicole had first arrived in Los Angeles. Rick replied that Nicole had been younger, bitter, and trying to make sense of stories she'd been told. He believed things were completely different from then.\n\n\nMaya hoped she hadn't done anything. Rick said Nicole had given them a child and loved Maya. He didn't think Maya had to worry about Nicole; however, he did think they had to worry about all the hard work the room attendant had done to prepare their space for them. He thought it would be a shame to let the turndown service go to waste.\n\n\nRick assured his wife that Lizzy was okay, and everything was all right. They hugged, but Maya seemed dismayed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Thomas asked if his family wanted him back even though he was financing the enemy. Eric replied that he didn't condone it, and he had issues with what Sally had done. Steffy said they'd see in due time if it had been a wise move, but it was not the point. The point was that they wanted him back. Thomas asked if Ridge felt the same way.\n\n\nThomas assumed that his family wanted him back at the company if he ditched Sally. He asked if Ridge got that Thomas was in a relationship. Ridge didn't agree that \"relationship\" was the right word. Thomas asserted that they wanted him to choose between love and family.\n\n\nThough Ridge didn't approve of what Thomas had done, Ridge loved Thomas and wanted him to have his own life. Ridge said he hadn't handled things the right way, but Thomas belonged at Forrester. Eric said that they were all in agreement. Steffy expressed that Thomas' personal life was his business, including his investments. She didn't like him throwing money at Sally, but he should do what he felt he had to do -- as long as he was at Forrester with the family.\n\n\nRidge noted that Thomas had helped to make Forrester what it was. Steffy said she and Ridge planned to help Thomas feel appreciated. Eric asked if Thomas would return. Ridge said they could use his help, and Steffy added that it was her brother's legacy as much as it was hers. She asked Thomas not to walk away from it.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was sketching, and Steffy was worrying about why Thomas hadn't given them an answer. Ridge figured that Thomas needed to think about it and that Sally might have offered Thomas something that Forrester couldn't. Steffy said Thomas could still see Sally and still invest in the sinking company. Ridge stated that Thomas might be too upset to return. \"Too stubborn,\" Steffy quipped, and Ridge reasoned that Thomas was a Forrester after all.\n\n\nSteffy figured that they'd gotten through to her brother, who had to be taking time to stew for a while. She saw no reason for him not to return. \"Love maybe,\" Ridge said. Steffy reasoned that they'd told Thomas that he could keep seeing Sally. Steffy asserted that they were family, and they'd be there for Thomas, even when the crush was over. She stated that Thomas had to know that he had to stay at Forrester.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Saul told Sally that they didn't need that tall friend of hers, who ought to be playing basketball on a Far East team instead of being in fashion. Saul said they didn't have to rely on Thomas because Saul had designs, and he had some money.\n\n\nSaul admitted that it wasn't the Forrester type of money, but it could keep them afloat for a few weeks. Saul asked Sally to drop Thomas and partner with Saul. Saul said his grandfather had known how to save, and Saul had inherited a bit. He said he hadn't squandered it. He wanted Sally to let him invest in her, but he asked that she first give Thomas his money back.\n\n\nSally asked Saul if he was saying he had a hundred thousand dollars. \"Not exactly, but I have enough to keep the sewing machines on. And I have something else, too,\" Saul replied. She asked what it was. Saul closed his eyes and puckered his lips. He leaned slowly toward Sally. By the time he reached her face, she'd turned it, and his lips landed on her cheek.\n\n\n\"What's going on in here?\" Shirley asked, standing in the doorway of the office. Saul chuckled with embarrassment and decided to leave to order fabric. As he passed her, Shirley instructed him to keep ordering the cheap stuff, even if they did have an investor. Saul glanced at Sally. She stated that she appreciated what he'd said. With a nod, he exited.\n\n\nLater, Thomas arrived to see Sally, and she assumed that his family had told him to rip up his check and stop seeing her. Thomas said that his family wanted him to return without conditions. She thought it was great and asked what he'd told them. Thomas revealed that he hadn't told them anything because he and Sally needed to talk first.\n\n\nSally readily assumed that Thomas was returning to Forrester, and even though his family hadn't asked him to pull his investment in Spectra, he'd decided to do it anyway.\n\n\nThomas told her to calm down. As far as he was concerned, his investment stayed, and he stayed, too. \"Stay where?\" she asked. Thomas replied that they stayed there.\n\n\nThomas was tired of handouts and waiting for his turn in line. He felt that his time was then with Sally as her lead designer, investor, and partner. \"My partner?\" Sally asked. He asked how it sounded. She dubiously replied that it sounded great. He told her that they'd be the hottest design team in the city, and Sally finally realized that he was serious about what he was saying.\n\n\nThomas asserted that he was absolutely serious. He said Sally had gone to Los Angeles to put Spectra on the map, and it was happening. He picked her up and twirled her around. A dream montage of Sally and Thomas watching their own fashion show and taking credit for it on the runway played on the screen.\n\n\nThomas put Sally down. He said he was giving her the one thing that had held her back from achieving her dreams: a partner. \"You,\" Sally uttered. Thomas replied, \"Me,\" and they kissed.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Rick and Maya miss Lizzie, but also enjoy the success of their business trip. When Maya gives Vivienne a call to inform her that they will stay in Paris a while longer, Nicole gets on the line and remarks rather snappy that suddenly modeling seems more important to Maya than her baby girl. Even though, Vivienne shuts down her daughter's concerns, Nicole cannot help but wonder whether Julius was right and that she should have never given her baby up for adoption - Saul asks Sally to forget about Thomas and to consider him as a partner - in love and business - instead. Shirley dismisses the idea, yet is concerned that the Forresters might convince Thomas to drop his support for Spectra Fashion. Eric and Steffy appeal to Thomas to return to Forrester Creations. Reluctantly, Ridge also confirms that his son's personal relationship to Sally has no bearing on his work. Later, Thomas announces to Sally that he has made his decision: he wants to conquer the fashion world with Sally by his side.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric says they do not condone what Thomas did but they do want him to come back to Forrester. Steffy says he belongs here. Thomas thinks they are asking him to pick between Sally and his family and work. Sally says he is meeting with his family right now. Saul speaks up and says he has money, just enough to keep them afloat for a few weeks so just forget Forrester. She can give Thomas his money back. He closes his eyes and starts to kiss her. She anticipates it and moves her head so the kiss lands on her cheek. Shirley interrupts when she walks in. Saul leaves after Sally thanks him for what he offered to do. Viv tells Nicole that the doctor never said never; possibly she still can have a child of her own. Maya calls from Paris and talks to Viv. She reports that Rick has more business and they may have to stay for another week. Viv says she will try not to be offended that they asked Coco and RJ to watch Lizzy and not her. Maya says that is why she is calling now to see if she could help in this added time. Nicole chimes in that she is sure the time will be an added pleasure and they will handle it. Maya thanks her and says she really appreciates it. Nicole tells her not to worry as Lizzy is in good hands. Later Rick tries to assure Maya that all will be okay. Nicole tells Viv that she knows she must think she is too emotional today but Lizzy could never be a burden to her. She never questioned but what she could have another child .maybe her dad was right that she should have never given her baby away. Ridge speaks up and says Thomas belongs here; they all agree on that. He is part of this family and helped make Forrester Creations what it is. Steffy tells him that FC is as much his legacy as it is hers so do not walk away from it. Steffy tells her dad she wishes Thomas had given them an answer. Ridge says that Thomas simply needs more time and probably wants to talk to Sally first. Thomas laments to Sally that they want him back and they did not tear up the check and even told him his personal life is his business. She asks what he said to that. He says he is tired of waiting for handouts and waiting his turn in the company. His place is with her so he is not taking his money back. He wants to be her partner here at Spectra. They can be the hottest designer team in L.A. She wanted to put Spectra on the map and that is exactly what is happening. He lifts her off her feet and they hug and kiss. He says she came to L.A. for her dream and that is going to come true. He is now her partner. Steffy says there is no reason Thomas cannot come back to work since they told him he could still keep seeing Sally. She can live with that until his crush will eventually be over.",
