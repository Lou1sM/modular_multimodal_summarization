Katie thanked Eric for the opportunity to work with Quinn on the jewelry line. \"It's worked out better than I ever thought,\" Katie said. She thanked Ivy and Quinn as well. Eric was gracious and said it had been Quinn's idea, and he had to leave.\n\n\nAfter Eric had left, Katie said she'd meant every word. She added that it was thrilling, and she couldn't wait to see some of her designs in the upcoming collection. Quinn and Ivy exchanged a look. Katie continued to say that it was great to be contributing at Forrester, and she loved being back at work again. Katie complimented Quinn and Ivy's designs. Ivy joked that she had a fan in Katie.\n\n\nKatie asked if her designs were ready for production or if Ivy and Quinn felt they needed to be tweaked. Quinn said that Katie's designs had promise, but she was still new at jewelry design, and she didn't want them get ahead of themselves.\n\n\nKatie wanted to explain the ideas behind her designs, but Quinn said it wasn't necessary. Ivy and Quinn understood what she was going for. Katie balked that she wanted to see her earrings, pendant, and bracelet in the new line. Quinn said the earrings might be included, but the other pieces missed the mark.\n\n\nKatie argued, but Quinn tried to explain that Ivy and Quinn knew the style that Eric and Ridge wanted. She said they had to attract all demographics, and the newest collection had to focus on younger designs. Katie insisted that her pieces worked together. She wondered what Eric would say.\n\n\nKatie added that Quinn's criticism indicated that her designs were boring, but she preferred to think of them as elegant and refined. Katie felt that Quinn hadn't offered constructive criticism. Quinn countered that a designer had to break the rules and work with the audience they had to reach.\n\n\nKatie dissed Quinn and started to make personal comments about Quinn. Ivy said they needed to slow down, and Quinn responded that she would not tolerate Katie's veiled threats. Katie countered that they had to work together as a team, and Quinn had designed most of the collection but thrown Ivy a few bones and stonewalled Katie. She advised Quinn not to cross her. Quinn sighed, and Ivy shook her head.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Eric met with Ridge and said he was glad they were designing at home together and that Ridge lived on the property again in the guesthouse. Ridge marveled that Eric believed they could finish a new collection in record time without an extra designer -- namely Thomas, but they both agreed that Zende had been a big help.\n\n\nRidge promised to have Thomas back at Forrester by the end of the day. \"I will fix what is broken between me and my son,\" he said. Discussion turned to how Quinn might accessorize a design, and Ridge asked how things had been going with Quinn and Katie. Eric responded that it appeared to be going well, but he seemed reticent. Ridge asked what was wrong. Eric said nothing, but he looked thoughtful. He said he had to leave for a business lunch.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally and Thomas discussed their partnership, and Sally said she was surprised that he had chosen not to return to Forrester, since his family had invited him back. Thomas answered that he and Sally were partners and that their work would be amazing. \"No more knockoffs. This time next year, everyone is going to be wowed by our designs,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nSally agreed, and Thomas added it would be a \"helluva ride.\" Sally lamented that Coco would not be a part of it. Sally added that she knew Coco was happy at Forrester.\n\n\nThomas stated that he was confident that Sally and Coco would patch things up. Sally thanked him for his confidence. She was happy for her family that Thomas had saved Spectra from Bill Spencer, but she lamented that she had betrayed Coco. Thomas hugged her and promised to talk to Coco when she visited.\n\n\nSally left the office and met with Saul. He was glad that he and Sally would be partners, and Sally would no longer have to ask \"Mr. Pecs\" for money. Saul had offered her his savings, and Sally said she appreciated his offer and his faith in her.\n\n\nSally announced that Thomas had joined Spectra as head designer and as her partner. He would devote all of his time and talent to helping Spectra. Saul looked shellshocked. \"Thomas to the rescue again,\" Saul said, sulking. Sally explained that Thomas felt they could compete with Forrester. \"Thomas is totally committed to Spectra. He has a really big heart,\" Sally said.\n\n\nCoco entered Thomas' office, and he asked to speak to her about her relationship with Sally. He noted that Sally was heartbroken that Coco couldn't forgive her. Coco was amazed that Thomas had forgiven Sally. Thomas explained that it had taken some time, but he loved Sally.\n\n\nThomas said that everyone deserved second chances. He added that he was a partner in Spectra. He asked Coco to forgive Sally, and Sally entered and asked if it was possible, \"Coco, please?\" Sally asked.\n\n\nAt the Forrester guesthouse, Ridge had been working on designs, and Quinn entered and complained that Katie had freaked out on her and used veiled threats to involve Eric in his opinions of her designs. Quinn warned that she felt Katie might tell Eric about Quinn and Ridge. \"There's no telling what she's gonna say to Eric next time she sees him,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nAt the restaurant where Eric was supposed to have his luncheon meeting, Katie showed up. She walked over to Eric's table, and he invited her to join him because his business date had stood him up. He noted that it was good to see Katie out of the office because Quinn could be a bit of a tyrant when she had a deadline.\n\n\nKatie professed that she loved to work hard, but she felt that Quinn had stonewalled her designs. Katie admitted that she had only been a member of the team for a few months, but she was frustrated. Eric wondered if something else had been bothering Katie. \"Tell me. This isn't just about the collection. I really want to know,\" Eric said. Katie flashed back to all the times she had seen Eric and Quinn together. \"If you really want to know, I'll tell you exactly what's going with your wife,\" Katie said.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Katie thanks Eric for being given the chance to be part of the jewelry design team. Quinn and Ivy are concerned about Katie's sudden aspirations at designing and her urge to have her first jewelry pieces featured in the new collection. Cautiously, Quinn advises Katie that she needs more experience before her ideas will be considered. When a miffed Katie runs straight to Eric, Quinn is highly concerned for her marriage and confides in Ridge that she fears that Katie could tell Eric about their kiss. Thomas enthuses to Sally about their new partnership and predicts that Spectra Fashion will soon be a force to be reckoned with in the fashion world. Sally is thrilled, yet Thomas notices her anguish due to the estrangement from Coco. Thomas then tries to close the emotional gap between the sisters and makes an emotional appeal to Coco. Saul is heartbroken when Sally reveals to him that Thomas is her new business partner and lead designer for Spectra Fashions.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells Katie that she is glad this is all working out. But it is Quinn she needs to thank as it was her idea. Thomas tells Sally there is one very good reason for him not to go back to Forrester Creations \u0096 her. He is her partner now and in the future patrons will be lined up around the block for their designs. Sally says they should leave Coco at FC though as she is happy there but still angry at Sally for betraying her. Thomas says if Coco is going to swing by here today he will accidentally run into her and explain; maybe she will listen. Eric tells Ridge they are short one designer. Even with Zende helping they need Thomas. Ridge says he is sure by the end of the day his son will be back. Eric tells Ridge he is glad it is working out with Katie and Quinn working together and having Ridge back under the same roof as he and Quinn. Quinn listens as Katie and Ivy go on and on about Katie's designs. Quinn finally says that Katie's designs do have promise but better not get ahead of herself just yet. Katie keeps pushing and Quinn tries to explain to her .they need younger demographics. She's not too flattered to hear that only one of her pieces is going to be in the next collection. Katie wonders what Eric would say. Quinn says there is no need to bring him in on this. Her collection is too conservative and she needs to push the boundaries as it is too boring now. Katie's feathers are ruffled and she laments she knows Quinn is the one who pushes the boundaries. Katie thought they were going to work as a team but so far it is 80% for Quinn and she throws a bone to Ivy but practically ignores what Katie wants to contribute. Sally breaks it to Saul gently. Thomas is here now as her head designer and partner. Dejected, he says Thomas to the rescue again. She says there is no more stealing designs. They are going to have great ones of their own. He is totally committed to Spectra. Coco sees Thomas first at Spectra's and asks why he is here. He says he is hoping to talk to her and ask her to forgive her sister. He tells her she got a second chance at FC. He has messed up and so has Sally but she deeply regrets what she did to both of them. He forgave her and even invested into her company and now is committed to being her head designer. And he emphasizes that Sally deeply regrets what she did. He realizes Sally has always been more than a sister to her and cares for her more than anything in this world. They are special. Sally comes in and says Thomas is right. Say it is still possible, please! Quinn rushes into Ridge's guest house. She tells him about Katie's veiled threats about them. She is a live wire and no telling what she will tell Eric when she sees him. It's like blackmail. At that moment Katie has tracked Eric down at Il Giardino. She starts right away that she appreciates Quinn's designs but she feels like she is being stonewalled. Quinn is unwilling to give her any real critique. Eric wants to know if there is more going on. He really wants to know as it must be more than her designs. Katie says okay, she will tell him.",
