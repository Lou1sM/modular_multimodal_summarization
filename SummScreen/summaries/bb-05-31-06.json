They invite Stephen to stay, but he refuses, wanting them to get to celebrate alone.  When Brooke arrives, she is happily surprised.  She is thrilled that Nick accepts how important Forrester is to her and thanks him for his support.  Nick presents her with Taylor's stock telling her now she is majority stockholder in Forrester.   Brooke cannot believe it and asked him how he got the stock.  Nick explains that Stephen persuaded Taylor to sell it.  Brooke is shocked that Taylor would go against Stephanie like this.  Nick tells her that Taylor is bitter about how Stephanie publicized Ridge's love for Brooke. Nick says now that Brooke is in control she will not have to deal with the Forresters anymore.  Brooke does not understand what Nick means, since she will be working with the family everyday.  Nick tells her he wants her to fire them.  Brooke cannot believe how Nick orchestrated this situation and thinks firing them would be a very cruel and vengeful thing to do.  Nick does not trust the Forresters and he demands that Brooke get them out of the company if she wants a life with him. \n\n\nMeanwhile at Forrester, Bridget and Ridge discuss Brooke's new position at Forrester.  Bridget does not think her mother should trust Stephanie's new attitude and she tells Ridge that she cannot believe Brooke would accept Stephanie's offer and risk losing Nick.  She asks him if Brooke and Nick have broken up and he arrogantly tells her \"not yet.\"   Ridge lets her know that Nick was the one who convinced Brooke to accept the offer.  Bridget is confused and does not understand why Nick would do this.  Ridge explains that Nick backed down because he realized that the Forrester's approval was more important to Brooke than their relationship. Ridge believes that Nick was afraid, if forced, Brooke would choose the company over him. Ridge is convinced he will be able to win Brooke back, now that they are going to be working together.  He asks Bridget to support his relationship with Brooke.  Bridget refuses to believe that Nick and Brooke's relationship is in jeopardy.\n\n\nAt Taylor's, sad and alone as usual, Taylor once more attempts to drink away her sorrows.  Deciding to sober up, she pours the rest of her wine into one of her plants.  Just after she does this, Stephen drops by.  She is surprised to see him and assumes he must have a question about the stock, but Stephen tells her that is not it, he just wants to make sure she is ok.  Stephen knows that Taylor feels alone and abandoned by the Forresters.  He tells her she is not alone and that he cares about her. Taylor is surprised that he cares about her; she thought he was only interested in her stock.  Stephen explains that he cares about her, regardless of the stock and she should not view him as another Stephanie who is just using her.  He asks her what she is planning on doing with her life now that she has freed herself from Stephanie's clutches.  Taylor admits she is clueless.   He says that is because she has always given to others and never focused on herself. Taylor tells him that it is a very scary time for her and she does not know how to live her life without Ridge and his family.  Stephen thinks it is an exciting time for her full of possibilities.  He tells her to stop looking back and start looking forward.  Taylor does not know how to let go of the past.  She says she feels all alone with a bunch of wasted possibilities.  Stephen says she is not alone and that he is there for her.  He then walks toward her and kisses her, first softly but quickly becoming passionate. \n\n\n",
