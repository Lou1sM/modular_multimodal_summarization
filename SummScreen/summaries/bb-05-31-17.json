Katie confessed that she and Quinn didn't see eye to eye. Katie felt they played by different sets of rules. Eric defended Quinn as an unconventional person. He was confident that they could learn to work together, but if something else was bothering Katie, Eric wanted to know about it.\n\n\nKatie agreed. Eric thanked her for a very candid conversation. Katie understood that Quinn was a delicate subject, but she felt that she had a lot to offer to Forrester. Eric reminded Katie that she was just getting started on Quinn's team. He said he knew it was frustrating, but it was just the beginning for her.\n\n\nEric reminded Katie that everyone in the family was finally getting along. He wanted to keep it that way. Eric credited Quinn for getting the family members to work together at the company. He remembered that it hadn't been too long in the past that Ridge had tried to get rid of Quinn. Eric shared that Ridge was living in the guesthouse, and they were all getting along. Katie was surprised to hear that Ridge lived in the guesthouse.\n\n\nKatie reminded Eric that she was grateful for the job, and she hadn't realized how much she needed to be in the office rather than stuck in a big home with nothing to do. She admitted it had made her a little crazy.\n\n\nEric wondered if Katie had been dating, and Katie said she was lonely and hadn't been lucky with men. She recalled that she had fallen for Ridge and Bill, who had been powerful, good-looking, and good fathers, yet were both obsessed with her sister.\n\n\nKatie noted that there weren't many men like Eric. She really wanted someone who would stand up for her and be reliable. Eric replied that he understood. It was important to have someone who was loyal. He felt he had been blessed to meet Quinn.\n\n\nEric said he needed to return to the office. He added that Katie and Quinn might not agree on everything, but they had to communicate. Eric asked Katie if she had plans for dinner, and Eric invited her to join him, Quinn, Wyatt, and Ridge for dinner. He felt it would give Quinn and Katie a chance to calm things between them. Katie agreed.\n\n\nAt Ridge's place, Quinn gave Ridge details on how Katie was more or less blackmailing her in order to get Quinn to include Katie's designs in the upcoming show. Quinn looked around and said she shouldn't be at his place. Ridge reminded her that it was on his dad's property, so it was technically her place.\n\n\nQuinn reiterated that Katie had been making threats, and they had to do something about it. Ridge argued that Katie had promised Brooke that she would say nothing to Eric about their kisses.\n\n\nQuinn was frustrated that Katie had been blackmailing her and wanted to hurt her. Ridge reminded Quinn that Katie would not hurt his dad. Quinn insisted that Katie had become dangerous. \"You need to talk to her,\" Quinn said. Ridge refused and said that Quinn needed to just give Katie her own line. Quinn angrily said that Katie's designs weren't good enough to include, but Ridge reminded her that it didn't matter because they needed to protect Eric.\n\n\nQuinn refused to allow Katie to control her and make her feel guilty. Ridge reminded her that had only exchanged a few kisses. Quinn agreed and wondered what they had done to risk everything. \"Whatever this is between us, I'd like to take it all back,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nRidge said he and Quinn should never have gone to San Francisco and had the tequila. They sniped at each other. \"I don't even like you. I never liked you,\" Ridge said. He got close to her, and they kissed and fell back on the bed.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Thomas arranged for Coco and Sally to speak to one another. He left, and he hoped they could patch things up. Sally begged Coco for forgiveness.\n\n\nCoco was hesitant, but Sally continued to remind Coco that she had never meant to hurt Coco. Sally added that it would never happen again. She and Thomas were business partners, and he had faith in her, much like Coco had always had faith in her.\n\n\nCoco lamented that Sally had jeopardized her future and could have ruined her career permanently. Sally repeatedly apologized and said she missed her sister. Sally begged Coco to forgive her. Coco admitted she missed Sally, and Sally reminded her sister that they had supported one another their entire lives.\n\n\nCoco agreed she wanted Sally back in her life. Sally asked her never to give up on them. Sally promised she would never let Coco down again. They hugged, and Sally hoped they could put the past behind them.\n\n\nOutside the office, Saul prepared to enter, but Thomas stopped him and said that Sally and Coco were hopefully repairing their relationship. Saul balked, but Thomas warned him to leave them alone. He also chastised Saul for his role in turning Coco into a spy. Thomas advised Saul that he needed Saul's trust, and he needed Saul to be smart.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric guesses it, something is going on with Katie and Quinn. Katie says she knows Quinn is his wife and he wants to think the best of her. Eric says Katie said she had something to tell him and he wants to know. Quinn tells Ridge that Katie is waving it in her face and wants to hurt her. Katie is becoming a very dangerous threat. Sally tells Coco that she knows she has no right to ask since she did her wrong but she hopes she can find it in her heart to forgive her. All she wants now is a chance to make it up to Coco. Thomas says he will go on and let them talk. Sally stuns Coco when she says Thomas has forgiven her and wants to be her partner. Eric tells Katie they have always been candid and the whole family is now getting along. Ridge wanted to get rid of Quinn and now he is practically living under the same roof. Ridge tells Quinn to give Katie her own signature line. Eric cannot ever find out about the two of them so give Katie what she wants. Quinn laments that she was just trying to appease Katie. She didn't actually think she would take the job. But she will not let her blackmail her. She does not know how it came to this. Saul says Sally knows he is here for her. Thomas says he knows that too but he should never have expected Sally to betray her little sister. Sally tells Coco that she still has her job and she still has RJ. She just panicked and this is not totally unforgivable. She was even willing to go to jail and let everybody know this was not Coco's fault. She knows it will take time and a lot of work but please just do not give up on her. Katie tells Eric that she is so grateful that Quinn took her in. She did not know how much she really needed a job. She was just rattling around in that big old house, not even dating. Eric tells Katie that she is due to meet the most eligible guy in L.A. Katie laughs and says she needs someone who is loyal and reliable, a man who will be there no matter what. She says there are not many men in L.A. like him. Ridge tells Quinn to give Katie what she wants if that is the price it has to be. He says they kissed but it did not mean anything. She says yes but it happened more than once and for what .for some twisted desire for danger. He says he does not think about it and it is over. Thomas tells Saul to stay out of the office for now as Sally is talking to Coco and since he got the spy work going with Coco he owes her that much. Thomas claims he forced a wedge between those sisters and he had better hope they can work this out. Coco says she always felt her big sister would be there for her and she does not feel that way anymore. She turned her into a criminal. She is not sure she could ever trust her again despite what Sally says. Sally says she took something precious from her and she regrets it. She looked after her most of her life and she knows how she must have felt when Coco realized how much a part of this she became and was betrayed. But Sally will never let that happen again. Coco is not sure. Sally reminds her all they have been through. It has always been them again the world. Coco cries and says she remembers Sally always told her everything would be all right. She needs her and does not like feeling like this. Sally says they need to find a way to just move on. Just tell her she will forget this. Coco nods yes and they hug. Sally retorts that she will never let her down again. She can count on her always. Eric reminds Katie that communication is the best as he is living proof. He invites her for dinner tonight. It might heal things between her and Quinn. Ridge says they will do whatever it takes to keep this from his father. Quinn says she feels bad enough and she is not going to let Katie make her feel guilty. Before he knows it he is telling Quinn that he never liked her and she should never have gone to San Francisco or had that tequila. He kisses her and they fall back on the bed.",
