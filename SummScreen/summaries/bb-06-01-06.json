Thorne voices concern over what could be keeping Brooke. Eric wonders if she has changed her mind, but Ridge is confident that she will be there. Taylor questions Stephen about the reasons that they made love the night before. Taylor fears that he was just feeling sorry for her, but Stephen assures her that it was more than that and that it's all about new beginnings for both of them. They kiss and ignore the ringing phone, not realizing it's Stephanie. Ridge finally calls Brooke to ask her where she is. Brooke tells him that she will be there shortly.
