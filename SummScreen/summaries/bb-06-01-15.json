    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the sky lounge, Nicole was worried because she'd told Rick where to find Maya. \"If she's still there,\" Carter replied and handed Nicole an envelope with cash in it. Maya had given it to him to make sure that Nicole would be okay after Maya left Los Angeles. Nicole didn't want money; she wanted her sister. Carter stated that Maya was gone or with Rick, and if Rick couldn't get her to stay, no one could.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Eric assumed that Ridge, Liam, and Steffy had been plotting against him since Steffy's last visit. Liam tried to explain that he'd instigated the takeover because of Rick, not Eric. Eric rasped that it was about Ridge, who was brooding over Rick's success. Eric asked how Stephanie would react to Ridge's actions, and Ridge said she'd jump for joy.\n\n\nEric called it a revenge fantasy and stated that they couldn't remove him. Ridge relayed that it was about ownership, and they were revoking Eric's power to name the next CEO. \"The hell you are,\" Eric retorted. Claiming to have the loyalty of all the employees, Eric stated that everyone thought of Ridge as an egomaniac. Eric blustered that with one word from him, everyone would walk. He hoped Liam, Ridge, and Steffy could sew.\n\n\nRidge acknowledged that the employees loved Eric and that eight of ten would leave at his behest; however, Ridge asked if Eric would reward his employees by asking them to be jobless. Steffy said no one needed to leave but Rick.\n\n\nEric asserted that Rick had an iron-clad contract, but Ridge brought up the morality clause in it. Eric questioned the morality of the three he spoke to, and Steffy said she knew he'd be angry with them for a while. Eric sadly said he wished Steffy was more like her mother. Steffy thought they should have the conversation later, but Eric said any conversation with them was over.\n\n\nLiam told \"Mr. Forrester\" that everyone had tried to get Eric to see how bad things were under Rick, but Eric hadn't believed it. Eric expressed disappointment in Liam but said it was no surprise about Steffy and Ridge. Ridge said to stop it because Eric's decisions about Rick had led Eric to that moment. Steffy was fed up with the battle of male egos and asserted that no one had died there. \"I suppose you want me to clear out my office,\" Eric said.\n\n\n\"You don't have an office! You gave it to Rick!\" Ridge exclaimed. Eric declared that as long as he had breath in his body, Rick would keep it. Ridge said the experiment was over, and Eric silently left.\n\n\nAlone with Ridge, Steffy felt bad for Eric. Ridge said the hurt went back to Stephanie and the question that had always lingered in the family home. It had been the question of who Stephanie had loved most. Ridge said Stephanie had known something Ridge and Eric hadn't -- that Ridge wasn't Eric's son.\n\n\nThe secret had colored everything, and Ridge felt that he and Eric had never had a chance. Steffy asserted that if Ridge wasn't Eric's son, then she wasn't Eric's granddaughter. \"I suppose we're disowned after today,\" she uttered, and the two hugged.\n\n\nRidge grinned and told Steffy she'd be the next CEO. Steffy said it was assuming that Ridge would pass it to her. Ridge claimed he wouldn't do what his father had done by throwing a retirement party and showing up to work the next day. Ridge said it was their legacy, his that day and hers in the future. \"Finally,\" they each said.\n\n\nAt Dayzee's, Maya assumed that her baby sister had struck again. Rick said not to blame Nicole because he'd been persuasive. He noticed Maya's bag and sat down to talk to her about leaving. Maya didn't want them to be seen together. He said there wasn't much more for people to be curious about, and he asked her not to go.\n\n\nRick asked Maya to recall her reaction when she'd learned who he really was, and he asked if he could be allowed to have a reaction, too. Maya claimed it wasn't the same. She said he'd assumed that she was a woman, and she was a woman. He asked her to be patient with him and the \"hand-me-down\" ideas of how things were supposed to be that were buried in his head. He said he might not say or do the right things, but he felt the right things. \"You did -- until the whole world knew,\" she replied.\n\n\nRick claimed that what he'd say might sound bad, but he felt the same thing that \"happens\" to Maya, had happened to him. Maya relayed that once people learned she was transgender, they \"get this look.\" Rick said it had happened to him after he'd learned what Spencer had done, \"and that everybody knew, and they were thinking it, and they were talking about it. And they were talking about us and our bodies and all our most intimate moments.\"\n\n\nThe thought of it had scared Rick. He asked if she hadn't told him sooner because she hadn't wanted him to see her that way. Maya replied that it hadn't mattered, and she'd owed it to him anyway. Rick agreed that she had. Maya said that when she'd moved to Los Angeles, everyone had known the basic facts about her, and when Dayzee had left, almost no one had known. People no longer asked questions, and Maya had thought it had been a good thing.\n\n\nThe tearful Maya stated that there wasn't a rule book to tell her when to reveal things and how much to reveal. She hadn't been able to see how much she'd cut herself off from Rick by being unable to tell him about her childhood and the time she'd climbed over the railing of a bridge and talked herself down. Crying, too, Rick said he wanted to know those things and didn't like feeling cheated.\n\n\nMaya offered to keep in touch -- if Rick would like to. Rick asked why she thought he was there. He said he'd never heard her ask him a question on the phone because his car had gone off the road. Maya gasped, \"What? I thought -- \" Rick interrupted to ask if she wanted to ask him again.\n\n\nRick's phone rang, and Maya said it could be work. He decided that work could wait. Maya replied that they'd just call back. Rick answered the phone for Eric, who roared that Ridge had done it. \"Or at least he thinks he has,\" Eric seethed. Eric, who'd locked himself in the CEO's office, claimed that Ridge had found a way to get rid of Rick -- and Eric, too.\n\n\nRick said that Ridge was bluffing, but Rick would be right there. After the call, Maya said that Rick couldn't let Ridge oust him, but Rick said he and Maya weren't done talking. She told him to go because it was more than a job to him. She decided to go upstairs and wait while he took care of business first. Before leaving, Rick decided to answer the question he hadn't heard on the phone call in the car. The answer was that he loved her. Maya smiled through her tears as he walked out.\n\n\nLater, Rick, donning a suit, met with Eric and said whatever Ridge planned, it called for a formal meeting and a formal vote. Eric asked what difference it would make if they had the votes. Rick called Thomas irrelevant because his holdings weren't enough to take controlling interest. Rick wondered why Liam had been with Steffy and Ridge instead of Bill.\n\n\nConcluding that Bill and Ridge hated each other too much to work together, Rick wondered if Liam had bought Bill's stock. Eric said he hadn't asked. Rick checked sales records and saw that Bill had not sold his stock. Rick figured that Bill was biding his time because he knew Ridge wouldn't play if he was involved. Rick said they had no choice but to suck it up and negotiate with Bill to stop him from voting with Ridge.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie fielded calls from people concerned about Spencer writing the story about Maya. Ivy arrived and said that Liam might have a new office at Forrester. Bitterly, she asked Katie to guess who was back from Paris.\n\n\nLater, Bill, who'd arrived, said that Liam had to get something in writing because Ridge's decisions usually had a short shelf life. Bill also guessed Steffy had dropped her condition about Liam, and Bill was satisfied that Rick had learned that he couldn't treat Caroline like garbage. Katie told Bill to stop using Caroline to justify what he'd done to Maya. Bill called \"that head case\" a fraud but said that with him, what one saw was what one got.\n\n\nLater, Bill popped Champagne. He was alone with Liam, who he called a genius. Liam said Eric hadn't taken it well, and Liam asked how they'd handle Liam being Forrester's vice president. Bill said Katie would cover for Liam, and she liked being overworked. Bill made a toast to Liam accomplishing what the rest of them hadn't been able to.\n\n\nLiam realized he needed to talk to Ivy about Steffy, but he was glad he'd done what he'd said he would do about protecting Caroline and Ivy from Rick. Bill said winning and winning big felt good. Though Liam didn't like the Maya story, he admitted that winning did feel good.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric is getting the message, Ridge and Liam are going to take him down. He is ashamed of Ridge and his infantile fascination and jealousy of his little brother for that big old desk out there. Eric says it is some fantasy as neither of them can remove Eric. He has the loyalty of all the employees out there. One word from him and they will all walk and Ridge will have nothing to sell. Steffy says this does not have to be this big .no one has to leave. She can not stand this battle of the male egos. Eric says he guesses they want him to clean out his office. Ridge says he does not have one ..he gave it to Rick. Eric grouses that as long as he has a breath in his body Rick will keep it. Rick tells Maya this is worth fighting for if she still wants to. He says he may not always say the right things but he feels the right thing. Carter tells Nicole not to take this on. It was not her fault. It was for Maya to tell and she didn't. He gives her an envelope full of money and says Maya is leaving Los Angeles so Nicole needs to start a bank account if she does not have one. She gives the money back and says she only wants her sister. Carter tells her it is probably too late. Rick tells Maya that it makes him scared too in knowing people are talking about them and the most intimate parts of their body. She says she knows and that is why she could not tell him before now as there is no book how to tell people you are trans. She is hurt when he tells her that he did not turn her down .he ran off the road and was pretty banged up but has been trying to reach her ever since. Bill is happy to hear that Liam set things in motion. Katie tells Ivy not to worry about Steffy being back in town. Everyone knows how she operates. Katie fields questions over the phone about the transgender community. Eric calls Rick and says Ridge has made his move and wants them both to leave. He is in the CEO office and has locked the doors. Rick tells Maya that he loves her and this is not over but he needs to go be with his dad in this time of trouble. But he needs her promise that she will stay here and be there when he returns. Steffy tells Ridge that she feels bad for her granddad but he must realize this is not about him but about Rick. Ridge says this goes back way further, back to his mother. It was never discussed around the dinner table but he knew he was not Eric's son yet her favorite. Eric tells Rick what difference does it make; the other side has all the votes. They discuss Bill who would like his foot in the door. Eric asks what is he thinking. Bill breaks out the champagne for Liam doing something the rest of them couldn't. Liam says he needs to have a conversation with Ivy now that Steffy is back. Rick looks up on line and sees no certificates have been traded so they need to suck it up to Bill not to side with Ridge. Ridge tells Steffy that this is their legacy .hers tomorrow and his today finally.",
