    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Eric arrived, and Thomas was awaiting him. Eric asked why Pam's desk \"says 'out sick',\" and Thomas explained that it was because she hadn't liked the outcome of her hair appointment. Thomas noted that his father wasn't with Eric. Eric acknowledged it and said he hoped Thomas had asked Eric there to end the estrangement between them.\n\n\nEric and Thomas discussed the tension between Ridge and Thomas. Eric said competing was a thing between men, and anger and love was hard to discern between fathers and sons at times. Thomas admitted to being angry with his father. Eric asked if Thomas was angry with him, too. Thomas wasn't. He just was tired of being passed over, which was why he'd decided not to return to Forrester Creations.\n\n\nEric suggested that Thomas take a month off, travel, and not decide anything but what to have for lunch, and once Thomas was back, they could talk. Thomas said that he couldn't do it. \"Granddad, I'm so sick of myself here. I am so tired of being the disappointed one,\" Thomas stated. Thomas said he could possibly be an \"arrogant ass\" with an overinflated idea of his talent, or there might be a concerted effort by certain people at Forrester to keep him in his place.\n\n\nThomas didn't think he'd know his true potential until he began again somewhere else. Eric had a sinking feeling that he knew where that somewhere else was, and he noted Thomas' investment in Spectra. Thomas said it made sense to recoup it. Disagreeing, Eric asserted that it was the emotional investment Thomas wanted to recoup, not the financial one.\n\n\nThomas believed that he and Sally made great partners, but Eric said money muddled relationships. Thomas said Sally didn't care about his money, but Eric replied that the only people who didn't care about money were usually the ones who didn't have to earn it.\n\n\nThomas insisted that Sally wouldn't make knockoffs anymore. Eric asked how equal the partnership really was. He pointed out that Thomas took his talent and experience into it and challenged Thomas to say what Sally had to put into it. Thomas said he was there to tell Eric the decision, not to for Eric to undo it. Eric extended his hand and wished Thomas well.\n\n\nStanding to exit, Thomas guessed that he'd talk to his father another time. Eric stated that Thomas was a lot more like Ridge than Thomas thought. Thomas replied that some days he saw it, and some days, he didn't. Eric believed Steffy would think Thomas' departure was her fault. Thomas said he'd make sure to talk to his sister.\n\n\nEric noted that his children had all wanted to carve out their own paths from time to time. He wouldn't make it an issue or command that Thomas never darken the mansion door again. Eric said Thomas should go with God, test himself, and experience what he thought he was missing. Eric told Thomas to remember that \"this\" was home and would always take him in.\n\n\nIn the design office, Katie asked Ivy if she'd be at home for dinner that night because Eric had invited Katie to join them. Ivy replied that she had a date and asked if it would be just Eric, Quinn, and Katie. Katie remarked that Ridge would be there, too, because they lived under the same roof. Ivy replied that it wasn't the same roof because Ridge was in the guesthouse.\n\n\nIvy told Katie that Ivy had been paying attention, and there was no need for concern about Quinn and Ridge. Katie hoped it stayed that way. In Katie's view, Ridge was wounded over what had happened with Brooke, and while being close with his father was good, Ridge being close with his father's wife wasn't. Ivy thought Katie was being too suspicious.\n\n\nKatie replied that she was conditioned for it, and if one expected the worst, then one wouldn't be disappointed. Ivy preferred to be logical and go with what made the most sense. In her eyes, there were a thousand reasons for Ridge and Quinn not to be together, and Ivy couldn't think of one reason that they should. \"Try this on: They're both incredibly destructive, self-sabotaging people,\" Katie concluded.\n\n\nIvy decided to drop the topic and get back to work. Katie didn't think it was easy to do because Quinn had designated Katie the \"slow learner.\" Katie said she realized that she was only there because Quinn wanted to shut her up. Katie believed Quinn was making Katie pay for being there by setting Katie up to fail, and Katie had a simple way to put a stop to it. Ivy said not to be that way, but Katie asked who deserved their loyalty -- Quinn or Eric.\n\n\nIvy noted that Katie wasn't usually spiteful. Katie asked why she had to be motivated by only spite. Ivy didn't think banishment, which was what Quinn and Ridge would receive, was fair punishment for sharing a kiss or two. Katie stated that there were all kinds of ways to have an affair, and the offense was intimacy. Ivy reasoned that they didn't know if anything was still going on, but Katie countered that they didn't know that there wasn't.\n\n\nKatie claimed that secrets like it were poison, and she asked if Ivy could feel it tainting her relationship with Eric. Katie felt that her silence made her complicit. It was changing her relationship with Eric. Katie claimed that she couldn't forget what she'd seen or learned. She cared about Eric and asked if she was being a good friend by keeping him in the dark.\n\n\nKatie was about to leave, but Ivy asked Katie to promise not to make a scene. Chuckling, Katie replied that Ivy sounded like them. Ivy stated that she'd kissed the wrong man before herself. Ivy felt that Katie was mad at Quinn, not Eric, and advised Katie to let it go.\n\n\nKatie claimed she'd looked up to Eric for her whole life, and she'd gotten more support and protection from him than from her own father. At that time, Eric needed her support and protection, in Katie's view, and she asked if she should look the other way or protect him by lying. Katie relayed that lying to people for their own good caused more trouble than the truth ever did. \"Ask me how I know that,\" Katie tearfully said and exited.\n\n\nIn the Forrester guesthouse, Ridge and Quinn made out on the bed. Quinn seemed conflicted as they kissed, and she finally sat up to stop it. Upset, she began pacing, wondering what was wrong with them. She said she'd only arrived for a conversation. Ridge replied that the problem with that was she never listened.\n\n\nQuinn asked if it was a sickness, and Ridge began to talk about the way she looked at him. Cutting him off, she said she tried to never look at him. She was worried that they'd \"almost had...\" Ridge said it was fine because nothing had happened. Quinn told him that they couldn't keep calling the kisses meaningless. In her view, being in the bed \"isn't stopping. It's too late.\"\n\n\nQuinn decided she would go take a shower to \"wash this off\" before dinner. Before leaving, she sternly told Ridge, \"Never again.\"\n\n\nAt the mansion later, Quinn was rattled to see Ridge in the living room as she descended the stairs. He said he'd been invited to dinner, but she told him to make an excuse to get out of it. Ridge insisted that things were fine and exactly as they'd always been.\n\n\nDisagreeing, Quinn stated that it wasn't because they'd discovered that she couldn't be in a room alone with him. Ridge didn't think she was being realistic, but she asserted that she didn't want to lose the love of her life the way that he had.\n\n\nEric arrived, and Ridge greeted his father. He said that he and Quinn were sorting out an issue. Eric asked if it was the same one that Katie had told him about. Telling them not to be surprised, Eric stated that Katie told him everything, and he questioned why Quinn and Ridge didn't.\n\n\nRidge said Katie tended to make more of things than they were. Eric was willing to agree that her objectivity was open to question. Quinn added that Katie despised Quinn, but Eric said he'd never heard that from Katie. Ridge conveyed that Katie didn't listen and tended to threaten, which was why she'd gone to Eric.\n\n\nEric stated that neither Quinn nor Ridge was good at diplomacy, either. Ridge asked what Katie had said, and Eric wondered if Katie's designs were really that bad. He said Katie's feelings might be hurt. Ridge and Quinn seemed relieved. Ridge said he and Quinn were discussing using one of Katie's pieces. Eric asked if it could be more than one.\n\n\nQuinn replied that Katie had a lot to learn, including patience. Ridge talked over Quinn and said that they could use more than one piece, of course. He added that they were discussing a signature line, too. Eric was glad to hear it and felt that Quinn and Ridge were a great team. Eric said they could tell Katie over dinner and added that he'd invited Wyatt, too.\n\n\nEric went upstairs, and Quinn was upset about having Katie as a dinner guest. Quinn was sure that with one look at Quinn's face, Katie would know that something had changed -- because it had. Quinn wanted to make an excuse to get out of it, but Ridge said he'd go. Quinn thought he should stay, and he asked if it was because she thought he was good at Katie management. He asked why Quinn couldn't fake it for two hours.\n\n\nQuinn asserted that she'd been in Ridge's bed. \"On the bed. Very different,\" Ridge corrected as the front door opened. It was Katie. Entering, she said she was sorry, but the door had been open. She asked if Eric was there. Ridge replied that Eric had asked Katie over for dinner, and he was upstairs getting ready. Ridge said for Katie to make herself at home, and she replied that she didn't mind if she did.\n\n\nRidge and Quinn glared at each other, and Ridge decided to make a fire in the fireplace.\n\n\n",
