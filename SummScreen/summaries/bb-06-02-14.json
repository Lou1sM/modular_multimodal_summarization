Hope grimaced when Wyatt added that Quinn had \"accidentally\" sent Ridge an incriminating photo of the encounter, causing Ridge to jet off to stop the wedding.\n\n\nWyatt was apologetic, but Hope said it wasn't his fault. She wanted Ridge to get there in time because Brooke deserved the truth. Hope just wished Quinn hadn't been so sneaky about things. Wyatt reasoned that it might not even matter because Brooke and Bill hadn't been together at the time, and two unattached people spending time together wasn't that big of a deal for Ridge to rush off for.\n\n\nHope said Ridge didn't want to see her mother make a mistake. \"So my dad's a mistake?\" Wyatt asked. Wyatt and Hope agreed not to let their parents' drama interfere with them, and Hope said she wanted Quinn to dial back \"the crazy.\" Wyatt claimed it was part of Quinn's charm.\n\n\nWyatt had hated his mother's stunts while growing up, and even if he hadn't always agreed with them, he'd had to be the good son and look the other way. He reasoned that if Bill had been upfront with Brooke, things wouldn't have unfolded as they had. Despite Bill's mistake, Wyatt saw that Brooke and Bill's connection was undeniable, and Wyatt didn't want Ridge to take their chance away.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Katie and Quinn waited for Ridge to send word that he and Brooke were on the helicopter. Though Katie didn't like what Quinn had done, Katie said she wouldn't mind seeing the look on Bill's face once Ridge arrived. Katie was amazed that Bill could sleep with someone he didn't even like, and she hoped Ridge succeeded, because she wanted her sister far away from Bill.\n\n\nKatie was confounded because she'd known Bill to be many things, but not a liar. She'd fallen in love with his honesty, and she'd defended it. Katie figured that the photo might not make a difference, but Brooke deserved to know the truth. Quinn said she was happy to help, and Katie was \"welcome.\"\n\n\nKatie thought Quinn was making light of things. Though Katie wasn't sure Bill would forgive Quinn, Katie thought that Bill and Quinn would make a lovely couple. Katie decided to leave so that Quinn could pack her things. Katie was sure that Quinn couldn't think she'd have a job after \"this.\" Quinn quipped that she was still good at making jewelry, regardless of who she'd slept with.\n\n\n\"Ruthless and delusional,\" Katie said, chuckling. Katie didn't care how beautiful the jewelry was. To her, life was too short to surround oneself with evil people like Quinn. Quinn glared at Katie, who added that Brooke had a lot of say at Forrester. \"I'd start polishing up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\" Katie suggested.\n\n\nKatie guessed that Quinn hadn't thought things through but figured that Bill would employ Quinn. \"Since you're going to live happily ever after,\" Katie added and left.\n\n\nLater, Quinn went to Rick's office, where Wyatt was alone. She asked if she was still on his bad list. He said he depended upon Brooke's reaction to Quinn's calculated hookup. Quinn claimed she'd just been trying to help, but he asked if the help had been sleeping with Bill or sending Ridge on the attack.\n\n\nQuinn wondered why Bill should settle for Brooke, and Quinn asked what always happened when Brooke dove into a non-Ridge relationship. Wyatt answered that Brooke always went back to Ridge. Quinn predicted that instead of firing them, Brooke would become engaged to Ridge and ask Quinn to be the maid of honor.\n\n\nWyatt stated that Ridge was engaged to Katie, but Quinn dismissively said Ridge was off saving Brooke and didn't care about Katie. Wyatt assumed Quinn thought Bill would return to sweep her off her feet. \"I'm not a thirteen-year-old girl with a crush,\" Quinn replied. She acted as if it didn't matter if Bill did that or not, but she said she thought he would do it.\n\n\nWyatt asserted that people were getting hurt at that very moment, and Quinn was incredibly na\u00efve to think that things would end well. Quinn said she'd been trying to do the right thing for Bill, but Wyatt corrected that it had been for herself. \"One and the same,\" she insisted.\n\n\nWyatt stated that Quinn didn't know what Ridge would do once he arrived. Quinn assumed Ridge would stop the wedding. \"How? A polite conversation between two rational people?\" Wyatt yelled. She said it had needed to be done. Wyatt reasoned that Bill should have made his own decision to be honest, and forcing it had been wrong.\n\n\nQuinn said that Ridge wouldn't do anything stupid; he was just protecting the woman he loved. \"That's when men are the stupidest!\" Wyatt retorted. She claimed that her intention hadn't been for Bill to get hurt. Wyatt quipped that she shouldn't have sent a man there who hated Bill's guts, and if anything happened, it was on her.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Katie and Hope encountered each other. They went into Eric's office, where they agreed that they didn't know what to think about what Quinn had done. Katie thought that Quinn was awful, but Brooke would learn the truth. \"Yeah, because of Ridge,\" Hope reluctantly added. Katie believed that Quinn had used Ridge to do her dirty work and keep her hands clean.\n\n\nHope asked if Katie was okay with it. Katie felt that it was something that Ridge needed to do. She'd spent too much time trying to control the uncontrollable, and what she knew for sure was that Ridge loved her. She didn't want to make herself crazy by second-guessing things, and she added that it wouldn't make her unhappy if Brooke didn't marry Bill.\n\n\nKatie wanted to fix things with Brooke but didn't think she could do it if Brooke was with Bill. Katie called herself hypocritical, but she insisted that it was how she felt. She couldn't stand to look at the couple, knowing how they'd started.\n\n\nHope was sure that Bill would put up a fight. Katie said the men had already had a fight even before Ridge had seen the picture. Hope asked if they should be worried. Katie didn't want to be, but she said that with those men, they should expect the worst.\n\n\nAt the wedding site, Ridge ran under the wedding canopy and demanded that Brooke go with him back to Los Angeles. Bill couldn't believe Ridge had flown all the way out there to make a jerk of himself. Ridge guessed that she wanted to marry Bill because Bill was honest and faithful. \"Well he isn't,\" Ridge said, flashing his cell phone, which displayed Quinn's picture.\n\n\nBrooke gasped, and Bill explained that it had only happened one time. He said he'd been drunk at home, and Quinn had showed up the night that Brooke had been about to marry \"this loser.\" Bill raged that it had been nothing, and it certainly hadn't been worth \"this moron\" flying halfway around the world. Bill ordered Ridge to get out of there.\n\n\nRidge wouldn't leave, and Brooke gasped, turning her back to the men. Ridge punched Bill, grabbed Brooke's hand, and dragged her with him as he ran down the beach. Brooke called out Bill's name as Ridge pulled her along. Bill hopped up from the ground and chased after Ridge and Brooke.\n\n\nA helicopter landed on a helipad by the shore. Ridge hustled Brooke into it, and as she said it wasn't the best thing for them to do, Ridge buckled her into her seat. Bill stared at the pilot, who wore sunglasses. Bill nodded, the pilot nodded, and then Bill watched the helicopter take off.\n\n\nRidge hadn't put on his seatbelt yet as he and Brooke argued. He claimed he'd always do what was best for her, and she asked how she could know what he'd said was even true. She said they couldn't leave Bill there on the beach. Ridge insisted that Bill hadn't been loyal to anyone, including her.\n\n\nOn the beach, Bill pulled out his cell phone and called the pilot, who looked like Justin beneath the helmet and sunglasses. \"Cool him off,\" Bill said.\n\n\nRidge patted the pilot's shoulder and instructed him to head for the jet. On the pilot's arm was an embroidered Spencer logo. As Ridge looked at it, the pilot made a hard turn, bolting Ridge out of his seat.\n\n\nRidge grabbed a seatbelt strap but couldn't hold on. Brooke screamed out Ridge's name, and on the shore, Bill grinned when Ridge plummeted into the sea. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge races through the palace grounds and spies the wedding tent. He calls out for Logan. They stop just as Brooke is about to put the ring on Bill's finger. That stops the wedding. He tells Brooke that she is not going to marry Bill; she is going with him. He shoves the selfie picture in her face. Bill tries to quickly explain it was only one time and he was drunk when Quinn showed up and took advantage. Ridge punches Bill in the mouth and grabs Brooke's hand and runs across the sand. Bill gets up and chases them but they have too big a lead. The helicopter hovers overhead and lands on the launching pad. Ridge forces Brooke aboard and the pilot takes off while Bill watches. Wyatt explains to Hope that his mother is involved and Ridge is in Dubai now trying to stop the wedding. They had a little encounter when Brooke was going to marry Ridge so they were free to be together, but Brooke may not see it that way. Hope says her mother deserves to know what she is getting into. Wyatt hopes she will not hold this against him because of what his mom did. She says she would love that but his mother does need to dial it back. He agrees and says that is the way he grew up. His mom did things he did not know about or approve of but he had to look the other way and was not going to throw her under the bus. Katie tells Quinn that she is glad she can see the humor in this. She doubts Bill will ever forgive her but if he does she and Bill would make a lovely couple. She advises her to pack up her things as she won't have a job by time all of this is over. Her big sis has a lot of clout around here so she would be polishing up her resume if she were Quinn. Quinn goes to Wyatt's office and asks if she is still on his naughty list. He says that depends on when Brooke gets back and if they get fired. He says if she thinks all of this is going to end well, then she is terribly naive. Hope tells Katie that she just heard the news. Hope is not sure she is supposed to feel angry at Quinn or be grateful. Katie says she can not stop Ridge so she is going to let him help Brooke and be grateful. She is not going to lie. She won't be unhappy if Brooke doesn't marry Bill. She knows Ridge loves her so she is giving him this time to help Brooke. In time they as sisters can mend and get back together if she is not with Bill. Wyatt tells Quinn that forcing this was wrong; it was Bill's call to tell Brooke. If anything happens over there it is on Quinn. Katie thinks back on her times with Ridge and wishes he would call her. Brooke shouts at Ridge that how does she know any of this is true. Ridge tells the pilot to take off. Below Bill tells the pilot to cool him off. We see just a side view but it is Justin who takes the copter and banks a sharp right turn and Ridge falls out into the Gulf.",
