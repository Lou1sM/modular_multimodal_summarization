Ridge said he hadn't wanted to wake her because she had been sleeping peacefully.\n\n\nCaroline asked about Forrester, and he said things were wonderful, but he wanted to know about her therapy. Caroline had her ortho boots on, and she said at the rate she was going, she'd be able to \"put pressure on these bad boys soon.\" Ridge was thrilled. Caroline thanked Ridge for taking care of her. She thanked him for pampering her and being supportive. Ridge carried her over to the couch, and they snuggled and cuddled.\n\n\nCaroline said she couldn't wait to get back to the office. Ridge explained everything that had happened at Forrester. Ridge said that he would be CEO, Steffy would be president, and Liam would be vice president.\n\n\nCaroline pointed out that Ridge would be CEO and head designer -- he would be twice as busy as he had been. Ridge said Caroline would be right by his side. Ridge added that it had been an ugly takeover, and his dad had been angry.\n\n\nCaroline pointed out that Ridge had been thinking of the company and his children's legacy. Ridge agreed, but he knew his father didn't see it that way. He added that it was ironic he was working with a man he hated -- meaning Bill-- to get control of shares to take over the company from the man he loved -- Eric.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Rick told Eric that they could make a bid for Bill's shares. Eric doubted that Bill would side with them, but Rick pointed out that Bill and Ridge hated each other. Rick added that it was their only hope. Eric didn't want to let Bill into the business.\n\n\nRick argued that they would find a way to get Bill out and get revenge when the time was right. Rick explained that he'd had a long talk with Maya. He planned to get back together with her. Eric was happy for Rick. Rick left to visit Bill Spencer.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bernie the tailor measured Liam for a new suit in Bill's office, and Katie entered. Bill explained that he had ordered a new suit for Liam, since he had earned it. Bill credited Liam with taking over Forrester. Liam noted that Ridge deserved the credit.\n\n\nBill said that Forrester would soon be in much better hands, and Liam added that Caroline and Ivy would no longer report to a tyrant. Katie dished that Liam would be working with Steffy, and it bothered Ivy.\n\n\nKatie wondered how Liam was going to work so closely with Steffy without anything happening between them. Liam said it would be fine, but Katie added that Steffy hadn't given up on Liam. \"Uh-oh,\" Bill said. Liam told Bill to stop, but Katie and Bill were skeptical that Liam could work with Steffy without sparks flying.\n\n\nBill pointed out that he felt he'd been able to do the same thing with Katie, \"but look at me now,\" Bill said. Bill didn't believe Liam's feelings for Steffy would not resurface. \"Good luck with that,\" Bill said.\n\n\nLiam said he was committed to Ivy. Bill said that Liam better be committed to earning benefit for Spencer, since Bill had given Liam control of his shares. Bill wanted Liam to keep his eye on Ridge.\n\n\nLater, Rick barged into Bill's office and said that Bill had had no right to tell Maya's story. \"It was her story to tell,\" Rick said. Bill offered Rick a binky. \"Look around. I am the king of a publishing empire,\" Bill said.\n\n\nRick was angry. \"That was private. You exposed it. It was cruel and ruthless,\" Rick said. Bill mocked Rick. Bill directed Rick to return to \"Milton or Myron.\" Rick interrupted and said he had a proposal for Bill that Bill wouldn't want to turn down. Bill laughed and said he'd been offered a lot of once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Bill surmised that Rick wanted his shares.\n\n\nRick sweetened the deal and said that Bill could put anyone he wanted in charge. \"Even me?\" Bill asked. Rick agreed and said that if Bill took over, he could force Ridge to report to him. Bill smiled. \"Who would you rather team up with, us or Ridge?\" Rick asked.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Ivy discussed that Eric had backed Rick. Steffy noted he had backed the wrong son. Ivy turned the conversation to family at Forrester. Ivy wanted the business to succeed, and she wanted to get along with Steffy.\n\n\nIvy added that she'd overheard Steffy tell Liam that she would always love him. Steffy agreed she would always love Liam, and he would always love her. Ivy made it a point to tell Steffy she had been Rick's past, and Ivy was his future. Ivy said Rick had clearly moved on. \"Has he?\" Steffy said.\n\n\nLiam entered. Ivy said it was perfect timing. \"How much in love are you with her?\" Ivy asked.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge watches Caroline sleep and gently wakes her up. She said she had physical therapy and fell asleep. Rick tells Eric that he did more research last night and he found nothing to back that Ridge has control of Bill's shares. So that is their long shot, the only one they have. Katie walks in on Liam being measured for a new suit since Bill thinks he needs one with his new title. Ivy confronts Steffy about the takeover and her staying in L.A. Liam asks Katie what does she know about Steffy that they don't. She knows Steffy had a big assist in helping Ridge and she is used to getting her way. And she thinks Ivy is pretty gutsy herself so how is Liam going to feel working with Steffy and being involved with Ivy too. Liam tries to explain Steffy is not going to be a problem, none of those old feelings re-surfacing .and Bill adds sarcastically that Ivy will not be bothered by that. Ivy tells Steffy that she did not need rescuing and Rick will not go down without a fight. Eric says he knows Rick wants to remain CEO but he does not want to depend on Bill for any reason. Ivy tells Steffy that she does not have a problem with her working with Liam but she does have a problem of her making an open play for him every chance she can get. Steffy rationalizes it that she will always love Liam and he loves her too. Ivy questions her if that means even if Liam has moved on. What will it take for Steffy to realize that. Rick states he does hate Bill and he did Maya wrong, but he will overlook it for this. He and Maya still have a lot to work on but there is hope. And the last thing Ridge will expect is for them to go to Bill and that be the knockout punch but he thinks he can land it. Bill tells Liam he gave him the shares but they both are going to have to keep an eye on Ridge. Just because he can make a dress does not mean he is good CEO material. Ridge tells Caroline she is going to be his design partner, the woman in his life. Caroline says she does not want Ridge to lose his father over this .so let things settle down. Rick marches into Bill's office and chides him for taking something extremely private about Maya and publishing it. He had no right. Bill says look around and see his publishing company without his binky and he will see he had every right. Rick shuts up and says that is not the reason he came anyway. He has a proposal he thinks Bill can not turn down. Rick says he hates coming to Bill but they are both shrewd business men and he hopes his shares are still in place so if he sides with him and his father they will have 50% and Ridge can not win. And Bill could name the next President, even himself ..and Ridge would answer to him. Liam walks in on Ivy's convo with Steffy and she asks him if it is true that he is still in love with Steffy. Rick tells Bill this is his chance to team up with who he wants \u0096 he and Eric or Ridge?",
