Under the assumption that Thomas had told Eric that Thomas would return to Forrester, Steffy started to talk about valuing her brother more. Thomas interrupted to say that he wasn't returning to the business. Instead, he was partnering with Sally at Spectra.\n\n \n Steffy asked if Thomas was doing it to get back at her. Thomas replied that it was about his future. He didn't want to keep waiting for Eric to notice him. He wanted to break out and prove himself. Steffy didn't get it and said Spectra wasn't even a real fashion house. Thomas disagreed and said he was going there to help it grow and to give it what he needed -- legitimacy and respect.\n\n \n Steffy was on the verge of tears. Thomas said the bright side was that Spectra wouldn't steal from Forrester again. She asked if that was supposed to make her feel better. She'd thought he'd be back, but instead, he was turning his back on the company. \"And your family,\" she added.\n\n \n Steffy thought Thomas was in too deep with a woman who'd used him and asked what made him think it wouldn't happen again. Thomas claimed that he was driving \"this train,\" not Sally. The decision had been his, and Sally hadn't asked him to make it. To Steffy, that was even more troublesome.\n\n \n Thomas thanked Steffy for the information about Bill. Steffy wished she'd never opened her mouth. For Thomas, it had put things into context. He asserted that Sally hadn't arrived in town to steal from them. Steffy asked Thomas to be patient, but he said he'd already been patient for a long time. Steffy asked if he really loved Sally that much. He said he did, and Steffy wordlessly walked out.\n\n \n In the Forrester design office, Coco and R.J. discussed her willingness to forgive Sally. R.J. was glad to hear that the sisters were mending fences and asked what had changed Coco's view. She replied that it had been Thomas. She explained that he'd helped her to see that only her hurt feelings had stood in the way of forgiveness.\n\n \n Coco also informed R.J. about Thomas' move to Spectra. R.J. thought the news would take getting used to. She replied that Thomas was really stepping up for her sister. R.J. thought the risk proved that Thomas really cared for Sally. Coco replied that it went both ways. R.J. understood Thomas and said there was something intoxicating about Spectra women. R.J. and Coco kissed.\n\n \n At Spectra, Darlita and Shirley were overjoyed to hear the developments about Thomas from Sally. Shirley felt that they'd be legitimized beyond their wildest dreams. Saul mirthlessly murmured that it was great. Darlita noted that Thomas really had a thing for Sally, and Shirley asked what would happen to them if Thomas and Sally fell out of favor with each other.\n\n \n Saul quickly validated the point and asked where they'd be if Thomas got bored. Sally said she wasn't afraid of taking the chance, and if it didn't work out, then it just didn't. Sally bragged that Thomas had also influenced Coco to forgive Sally. Grinning, Sally said Thomas had given her back the one person who meant everything to her -- her little sister.\n\n \n Later, Sally was alone when Steffy charged into the office and asserted that Sally had stolen from Forrester again. \"Oh, so you know,\" Sally replied. She guessed that Steffy wasn't thrilled about her brother's relationship or partnership with Sally.\n\n \n Steffy said Sally would never be competition for Forrester, who was on a different level. In Steffy's view, all Sally did was lie and steal, and she was taking Thomas down with her. Sally said that, whether or not Steffy believed it, Sally had learned a hard lesson, and Steffy didn't have to worry about Sally cheating the Foresters again.\n\n \n In Steffy's view, Sally was still doing it by cheating the Forresters of Thomas and by cheating Thomas of a brilliant future and healthy relationship with his family. Sally disagreed that she'd done so. Because Thomas had helped her, Sally wanted to help him. She claimed to love Thomas and asserted that he loved her, regardless of what \"Princess\" Steffy thought of it.\n\n \n Sally explained that she hadn't manipulated Thomas into joining her. In fact, she and Thomas hadn't even discussed it beforehand. Steffy asked if it had occurred to Sally to turn Thomas down. Sally didn't know why she would. In her view, it was a great move. Thomas could call all his own shots at Spectra. Sally asked if Steffy could say the same about him at Forrester.\n\n \n Steffy blinked in response. Sally said she could ask why Steffy was trying to hold Thomas back. Sally chose to, instead, thank Steffy for telling Thomas what Bill had done. Steffy contended that she wouldn't have done it if she'd known it would lead to Thomas working at Spectra.\n\n \n Sally claimed Steffy only felt that way because she hadn't gotten to know Sally, and to know Sally was to love her. \"Or at least like me just a little bit, which I think you do,\" Sally added. Sally posited that, beneath Steffy's superiority, Steffy was intrigued by the woman from the wrong side of the tracks. Sally even believed she and Steffy would be besties one day.\n\n \n \"Besties? You've lost your damn mind,\" Steffy replied. Sally thought they should give it a shot and go out for a burger, caviar, or whatever it was that Forresters ate. Steffy stated that she was watching Sally, and if Sally hurt Thomas, \"you'll have to answer to me, Bestie,\" Steffy sniped, and she stomped out of the office.\n\n \n At the Forrester mansion, dinner had ended, and as Quinn poured drinks with Ridge at the living room bar, Eric, Wyatt, and Katie chatted on the sofa. Quinn whispered to Ridge that dinner had been \"hell,\" and she was mad that Katie had stayed for after-dinner drinks. Ridge wanted Quinn to calm down, but Quinn seethed about Katie always watching them.\n\n \n Ridge and Quinn took their drinks to the sofa area and joined everyone else. Eric decided he had something to tell them that affected the family. He revealed that Thomas had decided to work at Spectra. Ridge said that Thomas was a Forrester and couldn't work for the ripoff artists. Eric replied that Thomas intended to make them legit. Wyatt said Bill would want to hear about it.\n\n \n Quinn said Spectra would get the legitimacy they craved, but Ridge asked what Thomas got out of it. Eric stated that he was just relaying the information, but he didn't want to spoil the evening.\n\n \n Wyatt changed the subject to Ridge staying in the guesthouse. Ridge bit out that he couldn't stay at Brooke's. Eric was pleased to have his son and wife beneath the same roof. A flash of Quinn and Ridge rolling on the bed played on-screen. Katie gazed at Quinn, who curtly smiled.\n\n \n Later, Quinn poured a drink, and Wyatt asked if she was okay. She said she was and asked why she wouldn't be. She sat by Eric, who was discussing the decision to go ahead with Katie's designs. Surprised, Katie asked if Quinn was okay with it, and Quinn said she was. Eric thought it was wonderful for them all to work together, be together, and have dinner together.\n\n \n Wyatt said it was new to him -- all the family dinners and bonding. He thanked Eric for welcoming the Fullers and for seeing the good in his mother. Eric replied that Quinn had needed to feel safe enough to let her light shine through, and he was the beneficiary of it. Wyatt said Quinn would do anything for Eric, even if it meant being nice to Ridge.\n\n\nQuinn indicated that Wyatt was correct in saying she'd do anything for Eric, who'd transformed her life. She couldn't repay Eric, but she promised not to let him down.\n\n\nAs the evening wound down later, Eric excused himself to do a conference call with Rick about their South African buyers. Katie asked to talk to Quinn alone, and Quinn tersely agreed. The women left, and Wyatt noted to Ridge that Quinn had been acting weird. He asked if Ridge knew why. \"No,\" Ridge said and strode off.\n\n\nKatie took Quinn out on the balcony. Quinn asked if she should be nervous. Katie said she just wanted to thank Quinn for including Katie's pieces in the collection. \"In the next collection. And Eric has to approve, of course,\" Quinn responded. Katie couldn't wait to get Eric's feedback and said no one knew more about fashion, except maybe Ridge.\n\n\nQuinn guessed Ridge was what the talk was really about. Katie disagreed and said she wasn't conveying her thoughts right.  Katie was trying to express how much being at Forrester meant to her. Designing jewelry had filled a need within Katie that she hadn't known was there. Katie said that Quinn had been generous with her time, her experience, and even her criticism.\n\n \nQuinn replied that she'd been trying to be constructive. Katie appreciated Quinn giving Katie a fair shot. Quinn replied that Katie's success was Quinn's success. Giggling, Katie said it was true. They were connected, and it was why Katie wanted a productive, and even friendly, relationship. \"Katie, I don't see that happening,\" Quinn replied.\n\n\nKatie acknowledged that there had been tense moments and that Katie had said things that could be construed as threats. Katie claimed that it had just been the heat of the moment, and she had no intention of telling Eric anything. Katie believed that Ridge and Quinn were clearly staying away from each other, so the secret was safe with Katie.\n\n\nLater, Quinn was in her nightgown as she climbed into bed with Eric. He said he appreciated her trying with Katie, and he had loved seeing Wyatt. It was amazing to Eric that the house had been like a tomb, but it had transformed and was full of love. Eric started to say something about Ridge, but Quinn asked if they could just focus on each other.\n\n\nEric cuddled Quinn in bed. She said she needed him to hold her and never let her go. She needed reassurance. She just wanted to be the best wife for him. Eric asked what those feelings were about and what was going on. Quinn replied that she just loved him \"so much.\"\n\n\nAs Eric cuddled Quinn, Ridge was in the guesthouse, drinking, packing, and thinking about her.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn sidles up to Ridge while pouring drinks and says Katie is always going to be there watching them. Eric informs them that he did not want to mention it during dinner but Thomas is not coming back and will be working at Spectra. Thomas tells that to Steffy too. She is surprised and wonders if he is trying to get back at her. He says he cannot wait around for his grandfather to notice him. He wants to start a legitimate fashion house at Spectra and he's already told his grandfather. She refuses to believe him. She wants him to be patient and it will all work out.

Ridge blurts out that Thomas is a Forrester and he cannot work with that knockoff artist. Eric says it is a done deal and that's all he wants to hear about it. He's just glad he still has Quinn and Ridge now living under the same roof .well Ridge in the guest house so almost under the same roof. Shirley is ecstatic and tells Saul to perk up.
