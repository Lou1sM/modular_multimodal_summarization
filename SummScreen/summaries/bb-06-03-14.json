    "soap_central": "\n\nFlying above the beach in Abu Dhabi, Ridge and Brooke argued on the helicopter. \"He's never been loyal to anyone, and that includes you,\" Ridge said of Bill Spencer. Brooke argued that it was her wedding day. On the beach, Bill used his cell phone to speak to the pilot, who wore a Spencer jacket. \"Cool him off,\" Bill ordered.\n\n\nRidge yelled at the pilot to fly to the Forrester jet. Ridge patted the pilot's shoulder to get his attention, and Ridge noticed the Spencer logo. The pilot banked the copter into a hard turn, and Ridge fell out of the helicopter and into the water below.\n\n\n\"Oh, my God! Ridge!\" Brooke screamed. \"Man down,\" the pilot said. \"Bring her back,\" Bill ordered the pilot. The pilot returned Brooke to Bill on the beach, and Brooke was hysterical. Brooke screamed that they had to find Ridge. Bill begged her to calm down.\n\n\nBill made a show of speaking to the pilot. \"Find Ridge. Bring him back,\" Bill said. \"Yes, sir,\" the pilot said as he removed his sunglasses. It was Justin.\n\n\nIn an office at Forrester, Hope and Liam discussed what Quinn had done. Liam shared that he had known that Bill and Quinn had had a fling. He added that Bill and Quinn had been together on the day that Brooke and Ridge had been scheduled to be married, and Bill had been hammered. Liam added that there had been no relationship, just a fling.\n\n\nLiam suggested that Quinn had sent the selfie to Ridge as part of her plan -- just like she had manipulated so many other things. Hope argued that her mother had a right to know that Bill had slept with Quinn, but Brooke didn't deserve to hear it on her wedding day. Liam encouraged Hope to throw Quinn and Wyatt out of Forrester.\n\n\nIn Wyatt's office at Forrester, Wyatt chastised Quinn for what she had done. He couldn't believe that she thought anyone would want anything to do with her after she had sent the selfie of Bill and Quinn in bed to Ridge. Quinn insisted it had caused no harm. Quinn refused to allow Wyatt to lay blame on her because Katie had already done it.\n\n\nQuinn accused Wyatt of being gloomy. Wyatt insisted they could expect the worst possible outcome. Bill would be angry. Quinn had ruined Brooke's wedding. Brooke would be furious, and Ridge would be angry. Quinn disagreed. She believed Katie was glad that Quinn had saved Brooke from a marriage to Bill.\n\n\nWyatt scoffed that Brooke would hate Quinn for ruining her wedding. Wyatt added that Hope would not be happy because Quinn had made her mother so unhappy. \"Everyone is going to resent you, and I'm the one who's going to get the worst of it. You caused chaos,\" Wyatt shouted. \"Would you just relax,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nLiam and Hope entered. Liam admitted that he agreed with Wyatt. Quinn had caused chaos. Liam warned that someone would get hurt. Quinn scoffed that it had been an accident, and Liam reminded Hope that Quinn never did anything by accident. Liam accused Quinn of not caring about anyone. \"Did you plan this outcome the whole time,\" Hope asked.\n\n\nQuinn tried to explain away her selfie. She said that she had hated Bill for so long that she had taken a selfie of them together to capture the moment for her own amusement. Liam shook his head and accused Quinn of masterminding the entire scenario. \"My conscience is clear,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nLiam called Hope's attention to how convincing Quinn could be -- and how deceptive. Liam accused Wyatt of being involved, but Wyatt reminded his brother that he never would want to see their father unhappy. \"I had nothing to do with this,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nQuinn maintained that it was her fault only. But Quinn said that no matter what happened, Brooke would know everything and could make an informed decision. Liam's phone rang, and Bill told him everything that had happened. Bill added that search teams were looking for Ridge, but they had found nothing.\n\n\nLiam was shocked, and he asked his dad to provide updates. Liam shared the sad news with Quinn, Wyatt, and Hope. Everyone was speechless.\n\n\nIn the suite in Abu Dhabi, Brooke and Bill awaited word of the search for Ridge. A hotel employee joined them in their suite, and Bill barked orders to find Ridge no matter what. Bill reminded Brooke that boats, divers, and the helicopter were searching. Brooke lamented that it had all taken too long. \"Did you see how hard he hit and how far he fell?\" she asked tearfully.\n\n\nThe hotel employee responded that everyone would make every effort to \"locate the body.\" \"Do not call him the body. His name is Ridge,\" Brooke replied angrily. Bill assured Brooke that Ridge was resourceful, and someone would find him. Brooke planned to call Katie. Bill looked conflicted.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Katie called Ridge and left a message for him when his phone went into voicemail. Eric entered. He shared her worries about what had happened with the wedding.\n\n\nKatie encouraged Eric to fire Quinn after what she had done. Eric said he would wait to hear what Brooke thought about it. \"She's crazy and she's evil,\" Katie said of Quinn. Eric offered a distraction. He delivered a wedding dress to Katie. He gushed that it was a clean, elegant design -- just like the bride. \n\n\nKatie wondered if Eric was all right with Ridge's choice of Katie for a wife, since Eric had wanted Ridge to marry Brooke. Eric admitted that his children seldom did what he wanted. Eric added that he knew Ridge loved Katie, and that was good enough for him. \"What more could I wish for my son?\" Eric asked.\n\n\nKatie cried happy tears, and she hugged Eric. She gushed that the dress was gorgeous. Eric left, and Katie poured some tea.\n\n\nHope entered the office to tell Katie that she had some news from Abu Dhabi, but Katie's phone rang. It was Brooke. Brooke told Katie that Ridge had indeed interrupted the wedding with the photo of Bill and Quinn together. Brooke explained that Ridge had dragged her off into the helicopter, and Ridge had fallen out. \n\n\nKatie was in shock. \"Brooke, is Ridge okay?\" Katie screamed. Katie repeated her request, but Brooke tearfully did not respond.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke looks on terrified as a terrible \"accident\u201d occurs over the Persian Gulf. Katie leaves Ridge a voicemail when she gets a feeling that something bad has happened. Liam tries to convince Hope that Quinn and Wyatt are not good people. Brooke pleads with Bill for help. Bill calls Liam to let him know about Ridge. Brooke has one last person to tell, but struggles with the life altering news.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill gives Justin the orders \u0096 cool him off. Justin banks the helicopter sharply and with Ridge not buckled in he falls out. Brooke hollers for the chopper to turn around and get Ridge. Bill gives orders for Justin to bring Brooke back. Katie thinks of Ridge and wishes he would call. Finally she does but only gets voicemail; tells him she hopes all is okay and to hurry home. Liam and Hope discuss the situation of Ridge being in Dubai trying to stop the wedding and how it is Quinn's fault for sending the selfie. Hope says her mother deserved to know about Quinn and Bill's one nighter, ewwwww, but not to find out like this. Liam wants to know what else does Quinn have to do wrong before Hope will throw her and her son out of her life. Wyatt rails at his mother for being so careless. She calls him gloomy and that he is so focused on the worst case scenario and outcome. She's a woman and says she knows her breed and how women feel when their man gets busy with another woman. She says when Brooke finds the picture of her and Bill, there will be no wedding. She will cry and yell and then dump Bill and let Ridge bring her home. So stop with that look. All she did was give Ridge information to pass along to Brooke so she could make an informed decision on whether or not to marry Bill. He scoffs, oh yeah so she was doing Brooke a favor. But her thinking is a little skewed as no one is going to thank her, certainly not Brooke and not Bill for ruining his life. She says Bill and her ..Wyatt tells her there is no \"us\". There is Brooke and Bill and then there is Quinn. She says she did not dummy up that picture. She just shed some light on the subject and if Bill and Brooke can't get past this, she does not feel she did anything wrong. He says wow, she really does believe that. She says she doesn't need her son in judgment; she got enough of that from Katie. She is sorry he feels caught in the middle as Brooke is his girlfriend's mother, but no one is going to hold Wyatt responsible for something she did. He says again that Brooke is not going to forgive her for this. Not only did Quinn sleep with Bill but on her wedding day of all days. She is going to resent the hell out of her. And then they will be booted from the company. Quinn says no, but even if he is right, it will be just her that gets canned, not Wyatt. She tells him to relax, nobody got hurt. Liam and Hope walk in and he says he is not sure about that. The last time he checked Bill and Ridge together was pretty volatile. And this time he is agreeing with Wyatt. If either of them get hurt, especially his dad he will prosecute. Quinn scoffs for what \u0096 selfie abuse? Hope wants to know if she planned this outcome the whole time. Eric talks to Katie. They both know about the selfie and that Ridge is on his way to Dubai. Eric is worried he won't get there in time and Katie is worried what might happen if he does. The chopper lands and lets Brooke out. Bill runs to it and tells Justin to go bring Ridge back. Hope says Liam has a point. No one would take a self incriminating selfie unless they planned to use it. Quinn says she had hated that man for so long so she just wanted proof for her own amusement so she could rub it in his face later. She says no one was supposed to know about her and Bill, especially not Brooke so her conscious is clear. Liam calls her a liar, a very convincing liar. He tells Hope that is why she has to distance herself from these people; they are deceptive and conniving. Wyatt jumps in and says he had nothing to do with this. He did not take any selfies, he did not send any selfies. He is finding out his information just like everybody else and then he went straight to Hope. And he is not on board with Quinn setting up his father. She says that is true. Quinn also says none of this was Wyatt's fault. She took the picture and accidentally sent it to Ridge, so any consequences should be for her and her alone. Katie says she knows she is not part of FC but she thinks Eric should fire Quinn for what she did; she is crazy and evil. Eric says those are strong words but he will wait and see how Brooke feels when she gets back. He surprises her by showing her the wedding dress he designed for her. She's glad he is on board with her marrying Ridge since she knows he prefers Brooke. Eric says Ridge loves Katie so he can not ask for anything more than that. Bill tries to calm Brooke and says everything is being done to find Ridge. The staff says they are using everybody available to try and find the body. Brooke warns them not to refer to Ridge as a body. With Brooke changing clothes, Bill calls Liam and then Liam relays it to the others that Ridge tried to take Brooke away in a helicopter and then he fell in the Gulf and the search teams have not found him yet. Bill tells Brooke it would be best if they stayed in their rooms and let the search teams comb the area. Ridge is a resourceful guy and he will survive this ..maybe a little banged up but he will be found and they will bring him home. She wants to believe that and says she will call Katie. Quickly she tells her the events of how Ridge fell overboard. Panicked Katie asks if he is all right.",
