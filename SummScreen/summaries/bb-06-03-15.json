Rick reminded Bill that Ridge was sleeping with Bill's niece. Bill observed that Rick had to hate Ridge even more than he hated Bill to make such an offer.\n\n\nRick admitted that it was a chance for both of them to stick it to Ridge. Bill understood the deal would be that Rick remained CEO, and Bill could choose anyone he wanted as president of Forrester.\n\n\nRick agreed and noted that he was all about making money. \"Whatever is necessary in that pursuit?\" Bill asked. Rick nodded, but Bill reminded him that it meant decisions like publishing information that sells a ton of magazines.\n\n\nRick asked Bill not to get nasty. Bill said that one day, they would have a good chuckle over Rick's situation with Maya, since she was out of his life. Bill said that Rick had done a pretty good job until Maya had been a part of his life. He added that Rick had had no idea what he'd been up against, and he should be glad that Bill had put the news out in the public. \"It's a good thing you hadn't gotten married and then this all came out,\" Bill said.\n\n\n\"She's still in my life. I'm still in love with her, Bill,\" Rick said. He added that Maya was not the issue. Rick changed the subject back to the deal with Rick and Eric. \"In or out?\" Rick asked. \"I'm in either way,\" Bill reminded Rick, \"with your idiot brother or his idiot brother.\" Bill smirked.\n\n\nAt Ridge's, Caroline and Ridge snuggled, but Ridge admitted he was distracted. Caroline encouraged him to return to work, but he said he was where he wanted to be. Ridge later agreed he would return to work. He collected fruit and other items for Caroline so she didn't have to get up from her wheelchair too often. She playfully used her reacher/grabber tool to pinch his butt. \"I'm getting pretty good with this thing,\" she said with a laugh.\n\n\nRidge sat down and said he had missed her. He wondered why she hadn't told him about the accident. Caroline sighed and said there was nothing he could have done. \"Tell me about it now,\" he encouraged.\n\n\nCaroline shook slightly as she told Ridge she had been walking down the street one minute, and the next there had been a car on top of her. She admitted she had felt victimized at first. \"Why me?\" she had wondered, but she added that everything happened for a reason -- something she had not previously believed. She added that after it had happened, she'd discovered a lot of love around her. \"Especially yours,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy, Liam, and Steffy had an awkward discussion about Steffy's statement that she and Liam would always love each other. \"Do you want to set her straight\"? Ivy asked. Steffy begged Ivy to stop acting like they were all in high school.\n\n\nSteffy insisted it was an office, and they all had jobs to do. Eric interrupted, and Ivy, Steffy, and Liam were even more uncomfortable. Eric assumed that they had been discussing the proposed hostile takeover that Ridge had planned, but he warned them not to think it was a done deal.\n\n\nSteffy understood it was hard on Eric, and Eric said it was wrong. Steffy disagreed, and she said that everything Rick had done was wrong. Steffy reminded Eric that Rick had endangered people's lives inside Forrester, and he had removed Stephanie's painting in the mansion.\n\n\nEric understood Rick had made mistakes, but he added that Rick had also learned from them. Steffy was unconvinced. Liam, Eric, and Steffy received messages from Ridge that he was on his way to the office and wanted to meet regarding the takeover.\n\n\nAt Maya's former apartment above Dayzee's, Nicole and Maya discussed that Maya had changed her mind about leaving Los Angeles. Maya explained to Nicole that Rick had been in an accident. Nicole noted that things had improved between Rick and Maya, and Maya agreed. Nicole apologized that she had told Wyatt and Wyatt had told his dad -- then it had turned into a media circus.\n\n\nMaya lamented that she should have told Rick a long time before. She worried that he was a laughingstock. Nicole said that Rick could handle it, but Maya regretted that Rick had to pay a price for her silence. She added that Rick hadn't freaked out because Maya was transgender but rather because everyone had known before Rick had.\n\n\nMaya announced that Rick was fighting for his company because Ridge had planned a hostile takeover.\n\n\nNicole insisted it wouldn't matter because Rick loved her. Maya said they had a long way to go to trust one another again. She admitted that she desperately wanted to be with Rick again, but she wished she could relive the past and tell him earlier. Maya wanted Rick to fight Ridge for the company.\n\n\nIn Rick's office at Forrester, Rick met with Eric and admitted he didn't know who Bill would choose to work with. \"That bastard likes to watch me squirm,\" Rick said. Ridge, Steffy, and Liam entered. Ridge said he wanted to get an agreement in writing with as little drama as possible.\n\n\nRidge explained that Liam had been working on the plan for months. Rick scoffed in disgust. Liam explained that with stock from Ridge, Bill, Thomas, and Steffy, they would have majority interest. Ridge would be CEO, Steffy would be president, and Liam would be vice president. Ridge announced that they would still have a position for Rick.\n\n\nBill entered and announced that Rick had made an interesting proposal. Liam wondered what his father was doing there. Bill said that Rick had offered that if Bill sided with Rick and Eric, Bill would be permitted to choose the next president of Forrester Creations.\n\n\nRidge angrily turned on Rick. \"You son of ...,\" Ridge started, but Bill finished the sentence. \"Son of a Brooke,\" Bill said with a laugh. He claimed they all needed to have a better sense of humor, \"more levity and less rudeness and nastiness.\" Bill noted he had a very attractive proposal for his \"boys, Eric and Rick.\"\n\n\nBill claimed that Rick was nice to him, where Ridge \"doesn't talk me to me and quite frankly hurts my feelings.\" Bill held up his hands and said that he held \"in his little jeweled hands the very future of Forrester Creations.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill knows that Rick is desperate. His 12.5 percent of stock can keep Rick in the driver's seat. Rick thinks it is a no brainer as Bill would get to pick the President. Rick guesses that Bill despises him less than Rick does his own brother. Bill is tempted and says this will go down easier now that Maya is out of Rick's life. Rick has to tell him that he is still in her love with her and technically she is not out of his life. Rick continues to ride Bill of which side he is on. Ridge rubs Caroline's shoulders and they share some fun time. She knows he has a lot on his mind and wants him to get to work. She knows Ridge has been waiting for this a long time and all it will take is one formal vote and Ridge is in and Rick is out. Liam looks scared when Ivy asks him to explain why Steffy thinks he is still in love with her. Steffy says that is not how it happened. She simply said that she loved Liam and always would but that he had lots of love for Ivy. She does not know what will happen in future. Ivy says neither does she but there is no guessing game in their relationship now. Nicole catches Maya as she is folding clothes and Nicole thinks she is packing to leave town. But she sees what a good mood she is in and thinks she has talked to Rick. Maya says yeah they talked, she can not say they are back together but she is not mad at Nicole for telling Rick where she was. And she understands everything after hearing his side of the story. She told Rick to fight Ridge with everything he can. Rick walks into Eric's office and tells him it was not easy but he talked to Bill and Eric was right that Bill still has ownership of his shares, not Liam. He would give no answer as he likes to see Rick squirm. Eric joins in on the Liam, Steffy, Ivy convo and asks if Ivy has told them about the proposed changes around here. Liam recognizes this must be very difficult for Eric. He says Ridge has called and is on his way and this will be settled by end of day. Ridge walks in and wants to get this done right away, sign the papers. Bill is not far behind and all wonder why he is there. Gloating Bill says he was paid a nice visit by Rick and wants to tell them that Liam does not have control of his stock. So now he has a choice of whether to throw in with his sons, Rick and Eric or with Ridge who does not talk to him and constantly hurts his feelings. So smirking again he says it comes down to old Dollar Bill and his measly 12.5 percent held in his jeweled hands that holds the future of Forrester Creations.",
