Brooke tried to explain that Ridge had fallen out of the helicopter into the water and had not yet been found. Bill was nearby Brooke, and he looked guilty.\n\n\nKatie was devastated, and Hope hugged her. Katie struggled to speak, and she stammered that she knew Ridge shouldn't have gone to Abu Dhabi. \"I had a feeling,\" Katie said.\n\n\nCaroline, Rick, and Eric walked into the office, and Caroline asked about the beautiful bride-to-be but stopped short when she realized that Katie had been crying. Hope tried to explain that Ridge had fallen out of a helicopter, and no one could find him. Carter and Maya joined the group, and expressed their support and concern. \"Ridge is a survivor. He's going to be fine,\" Eric said. Eric hugged a tearful Katie.\n\n\nIn Quinn's office, Liam and Wyatt worried about what they could do to help Brooke and Katie. Quinn dared to say that Ridge was probably fine and hiding out somewhere. Liam was furious. He noted that in the worst-case scenario, Ridge was dead because of Quinn. She had pretty much sent Ridge to Abu Dhabi. Liam accused her of being responsible for the death of Ridge Forrester.\n\n\nQuinn tried to defend herself, but Liam said that Quinn had knowingly provoked Ridge. Quinn accused Liam of being insensitive and wasting precious energy on blaming her for consequences that had resulted because she'd \"accidentally sent an email.\"\n\n\n\"Who are you trying to fool?\" Liam asked. Liam accused Quinn of manipulating Bill and Ridge. Quinn maintained her innocence, and Wyatt defended his mother. \"How long before you try getting us fired again?\" Wyatt asked. Liam reminded Wyatt and Quinn that no one would be happy with Quinn -- not Brooke, Bill, Ridge, Katie, Hope, or anyone at Forrester. Wyatt started in on how he and Hope would be just fine. \"I will always be the one she comes back to,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nHope interrupted. Everyone asked about Katie, and Hope said Katie was in shock. \"This doesn't seem real,\" Hope said. Quinn tried to offer help, but Liam argued that she had done enough. Quinn warned him not to blame her for an accident that had occurred halfway around the world. \"Ridge is an adult, and he makes his own decisions,\" Quinn quipped. Hope looked angry.\n\n\nLiam noted that Quinn didn't care who she'd hurt. Wyatt warned Liam to stop, but Liam told his brother to wake up. \"She's dangerous, Wyatt,\" Liam said. Liam added that R.J. might have lost his dad. Hope agreed with Liam. \"Ridge would be safe at home if it weren't for you,\" Hope said to Quinn. Hope started to cry.\n\n\nLiam insisted that Quinn should apologize to Hope, but Quinn maintained she had accidentally sent the email. Liam noted that she had blackmailed Bill -- she had promised the picture of Quinn and Bill in bed would never see the light of day if Bill made Wyatt a Spencer. Wyatt looked surprised. Quinn tried to turn the tables on Liam, but he said there was no way anyone would ever forgive her.\n\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, Bill and Brooke discussed what could have happened to Ridge. In another room, the search team met. Bill promised Brooke that they would find Ridge. Brooke hugged Bill, and Bill looked guilty. Brooke stepped out on the balcony alone. She flashed back to when Ridge had returned from Paris and deposited rose petals into the fountain at their home. She started to cry.\n\n\nThe director of the search team met with Bill and expressed sorrow for his loss. Bill refused to accept that Ridge was lost. \"Ridge is alive, you hear me? I want updates on the minute from everyone -- in the air and on the ground. No one leaves until we find Mr. Forrester,\" Bill ordered.\n\n\nBrooke returned from the balcony, and Bill told her there was a lot of manpower on the case. Bill promised that they would find Ridge, and he and Ridge would shake hands, and they would all return to Los Angeles together. \"I pray you're right. He's the father of my child,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nThe director of the search team interrupted. \"Mr. Spencer, I must warn you. My team is transitioning from a rescue to a recovery mission,\" he said. Brooke freaked. \"Ridge is alive. I know it. I can feel it,\" she said. The search director looked skeptical.\n\n\nBrooke's phone rang -- it was Katie. Brooke said they had no news, but both sisters agreed they could feel that Ridge was alive. Katie said that she was on her way to Abu Dhabi. Eric entered and said that he had just booked a jet for both of them to fly to Abu Dhabi. Brooke and Katie hung up.\n\n\nBrooke told Bill that Katie was on her way. Bill hoped that they would have good news by the time Katie landed. Brooke left to join the search. Justin entered and met with Bill. They discussed how they had to hide their guilt in the matter. Bill said he couldn't be associated with the accident, and no one could find out that Justin had been flying the helicopter.\n\n\nJustin and Bill discussed that Ridge could not possibly have disappeared. \"Brooke can never know -- no one can ever know,\" Bill said. Justin told Bill to stop panicking. \"We are the only ones who know, and I was just following orders,\" Justin said.\n\n\nBill maintained that he'd wanted to scare Ridge -- not hurt him. Bill had wanted to teach Ridge a lesson for trying to steal his bride. \"Nobody is going to do that to me and get away with it,\" Bill said. Bill looked nervous, and Justin advised him to get it together and stop looking so guilty.\n\n\nOn the private plane that Eric had chartered, Eric and Katie took their seats. Eric asked about the book that Katie had. She responded that it was a book of poems that she and Ridge enjoyed. \"We just found each other,\" she cried. Eric promised that Ridge and Katie would have years together. \"We are going to bring him home,\" Eric said. Eric grabbed her hand. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke tells Katie the terrible news about Ridge. Liam confronts Quinn in the Ridge/Brooke/Bill scenario. The Forrester and Logan families gather around Katie to offer assistance. Wyatt defends his mother. Bill struggles with his guilt. Katie and Eric take a private jet to Abu Dhabi. A master manipulator and his pilot discuss their role in the accident and their shameful game plan.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie wants to know what happened and how. She panics when Brooke says Ridge was too close to the side of chopper and fell out of it. They have not found him yet. Liam hangs up from hearing the news and Wyatt asks how is that possible that Ridge is just gone. Quinn says she is sure he will be all right but Liam isn't so sure and he accuses Quinn of starting all of this with her selfie. She could be the cause of Ridge Forrester's death. Hope tells Katie that she is so sorry this is happening. Katie says she knew that Ridge should not have gone. Hope tries to persuade her that everything will be fine. Rick and Caroline come in and they see how upset everyone is. Hope fills them in that Ridge flew to Abu Dhabi and then her mom and Ridge got in a helicopter and Ridge fell out over the water. Liam continues to point fingers at Quinn for sending the photo knowing full well that Ridge would run off and try to stop the wedding. She says she accidentally sent a silly little picture and now he is pointing fingers at her. Liam is incensed \u0096 accidentally, she knew exactly what she was doing. If it had not been for her manipulating none of this would have happened. Wyatt says Ridge is MIA and could even be dead and all Liam can do is blame his mother. Liam says he knows she is his mother but surely he can not condone what she did and now that this has happened. Eric tells Maya and Carter that Ridge is a survivor and will not give up. Bill comforts Brooke and says they will get Ridge back. She doesn't know how anyone could survive a fall like that. He tries to convince her that people have survived much worse. And he has the Coast Guard and a team of others looking. He has called in every favor he could. They are not going to stop until they find him. Bill talks with Hassan and tells him that he wants updates every minute until they find Ridge. And to tell the search units in the air and ground not to leave until they find him. He tells Brooke that is a lot of man power and it's just a matter of time before they find Ridge. They will all go home and they will put their differences behind them and life will go on. Brooke says she prays he is right. She can not lose him. He is the father of her child and her sister's fiance. Hassan comes back and tells Bill he must tell him they are still looking but it will change soon from a rescue mission to recovery. His men are dragging for the body. Brooke gasps for him to please not say that. She says she knows he is out there somewhere alive, she can feel it. Wyatt tells Liam to have some respect. Liam rants that he has not heard his mother offer an apology. He will back off as soon as he hears one iota of responsibility. He asks her to go ahead. She asks why \u0096 for sending a photo? She tells Hope what happened is horrific and she hopes it will end with good results but she can not apologize or take responsibility for something that happened half way around the world. Hope says yes but the thing is Ridge would not have been on the helicopter if Quinn had not sent the picture. Wyatt chimes in and says he imagines if she had to do it again she would not have. Liam says his tune sure has changed with Quinn in the same room. Quinn says with all due respect Ridge is an adult and what he did was on his own. She did not encourage him to go or to stop the wedding. He made those choices all on his own. Liam looks at her and says that's it, no accountability at all. She doesn't really care who gets hurt as long as it is not her son. Everybody else is fair game. She lies and manipulates and puts people's lives in danger just to get what she wants. Wyatt tells him to knock it off but Liam continues. Wake up, man, see what his mother has done, but she will sleep just fine tonight. Katie calls Brooke to see if any more news. Both feel that Ridge is still alive. Katie says she can not just stay here. She is coming. Donna will take care of Will. Eric tells her he just booked a jet so he will go with her right now. Rick says go find Ridge; he will take care of things in the office. Justin speaks with Bill and Brooke. He says he heard abut the accident and came right away. Brooke says she can not stand this; she is going to go look for Ridge herself. Alone Bill tells Justin that he never called him and Justin was not piloting that chopper. What happened to Forrester was an accident. Katie thanks Eric for getting a jet so quickly. She shows him a book of poems that she carries with her, favorite of her and Ridge. She cries that they just found each other. She needs more time with him. Eric touches her hand and says she will have it. Ridge will show up and bring her a bouquet of desert roses. Quinn says it again. She is sorry the way things turned out but Brooke had a right to know about her and Bill before they married. Hope says yes but at what price. There has been a horrible mistake and Quinn is still standing by the fact that it was just a mistake. Liam adds that it was not a mistake; it was calculated and Quinn feels nothing now. Quinn counters that he better be careful. He is throwing around a lot of ugly accusations and slander is illegal. Liam says so is blackmail. His dad had one drunken night with her and she is milking it for all it's worth.....even blackmailing Bill into making his brother a Spencer. Bill will want nothing to do with her after this. Neither will Hope or any of the Forrester's, it's over. He says she is dangerous and he is sorry that he didn't work harder to expose her. But now she has exposed her own depravity like no one else could. She went too far. She put a man's life at stake and you can't come back from a stunt like that. Justin tells Bill that he is not going to tell anyone. He was the one flying the copter; his ass is on the line. Bill says he told Justin to cool Ridge off; not lose him forever. Did he see him land. Justin said he was busy making sure Brooke got back to Bill. Bill says Brooke can never know it was Justin flying the chopper. No one can know that. Justin says they aren't gonna tell and he left the helipad before anyone could question him. Ridge could not have known that Bill sent a helicopter to pick up him and Brooke after the wedding, so Ridge must have ordered his own and assumed Justin's chopper was for him. He tells Bill to stop looking so suspicious. He has guilt written all over his face. Bill sighs and says he did not want to hurt Ridge.....at least not much. He just wanted to teach him a lesson. He certainly did not want him killed. Nobody does what Ridge does and gets away with it. He's out there somewhere and he could not have just disappeared off the face of the earth. He has to know Forrester is alive.",
