Brooke tells Nick she wants things to work for them but she also wants things to work for Ridge's family.  She points out that Ridge and Eric are Forrester Creations and it would be morally wrong and bad business to fire them.  Brooke offers a solution.

Ridge thinks Brooke is making the right decision and says she is a good CEO because she realizes what is best for the company.
