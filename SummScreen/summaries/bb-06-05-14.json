    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the jet, Katie wanted to believe that Ridge had been strong enough to make it to shore and would be there when she and Eric arrived. \"God, I could kill Quinn,\" Katie muttered, still angry that Quinn had sent the photo while knowing all along how Ridge would react. Eric noted that Quinn always seemed to be in the middle of things, but Ridge had been looking for a smoking gun.\n\n\nKatie couldn't condone Ridge's actions, but she said that Quinn had manipulated the situation and used Ridge to stop Bill from marrying Brooke. Eric agreed with Katie's point of view. Katie said that Quinn was a horrible person, and Ridge had better be okay.\n\n\nEric was optimistic that a boat had picked up his son. Katie stated that Bill had probably seen everything from the shore. She asked if there were miracles, and Eric said her whole life had been a miracle, from her heart, to Will's birth, to Ridge being in her life. Eric said they wouldn't give up.\n\n\nKatie flashed back on her time with Ridge, and Eric guessed she had a lot of memories from her short time with his son. She said she didn't remember who she'd been before Ridge, and Eric uttered that he couldn't lose Ridge. Katie said she couldn't lose him, either; she'd been building a life with him, and he was all she'd ever wanted. Eric affirmed that she'd have that life because Ridge would be back.\n\n\nAt the Abu Dhabi hotel, Bill and Justin debated in hushed tones about Ridge's fate. Justin said he'd done as he'd been told, and because he'd been piloting, he hadn't witnessed Ridge's fall. Bill recalled that, because the helicopter hadn't been that high, he'd believed that Ridge would swim to shore. Bill guessed that a current had pulled Ridge farther out.\n\n\nBill had wanted to teach the \"little dressmaker\" a lesson, not kill him. He reasoned that a yacht could have picked Ridge up, and Ridge was probably somewhere having a party.\n\n\nBrooke entered and asked if there had been any word. Bill said there hadn't been, and she raged that she wanted to know who the pilot was, because it was all the pilot's fault. Bill sent Justin to meet the search team in the lobby, and Brooke thanked Bill for doing everything he could.\n\n\nBrooke was ready for Quinn to pay, and Bill was sure that would happen. Brooke asked how Quinn had gotten the picture in the first place. Bill explained that he'd been drunk out of his head on Ridge and Brooke's wedding day, and Quinn had been there with an agenda. He felt that he'd been a fool not to see it. The angry Bill whipped out his phone and called Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn answered the phone with concern in her voice for what was happening in Bill's location. Bill asked \"what the hell\" she'd been doing by giving Ridge that photo. She claimed that she'd done it for Bill, but Bill told her that she could do one more thing for him -- stay \"the hell\" out of his life. He declared that he wanted nothing more to do with her, even if she was Wyatt's mother.\n\n\nBill clicked off the line, and in Los Angeles, Quinn quietly put her phone down.\n\n\nLater, Brooke watched the rescue effort from her window. She said she should blame herself for what had happened. She felt she could have struggled more against Ridge and prevented the takeoff. Bill insisted that it had been Quinn, not Brooke or anyone else, who was to blame.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Quinn and Wyatt watched Liam and Hope, who were huddled together in conversation. Wyatt didn't think it looked good, and Quinn suggested he get Hope away from Liam by taking her for coffee. Scoffing, Wyatt said he'd been referring to the whole mess. Quinn was sure that Ridge would survive, and Wyatt sarcastically asked if she'd ever fallen from a helicopter.\n\n\nOn the other side of the room, Liam told Hope that she didn't need people like the Fullers in her life. Liam said Quinn had lit a match to a powder keg by giving Ridge the photo, and Liam didn't want Hope to be anywhere the next explosion.\n\n\nHope called to get word about Ridge, but there wasn't any. After the call, Quinn asked Hope how Brooke and Bill were holding up. \"How do you think, Quinn?\" Liam seethed. Quinn assumed that the couple was concerned, like she was, and Liam asked what Quinn was actually concerned about. He guessed she cared about getting Bill back at lightning speed to continue the affair.\n\n\nWyatt started to get upset with Liam's attitude, and Quinn corrected that she'd only been with Bill one time. She claimed she'd happened to be there when Bill had been vulnerable. Liam snipped that he'd happened to be there, too, and Bill had been very drunk.\n\n\nQuinn replied that all she'd done was alert Ridge to the fact that she and Bill had been together, but she hadn't been the one to throw Ridge out of a helicopter. Liam said that he and Hope disagreed about his next point, but in his view, Quinn was fully responsible.\n\n\nLater, Hope and Wyatt sat alone on the settee, and Wyatt assured Hope that he'd fought his mother on using the selfie. He wished he'd deleted it himself. Hope stated that Liam was right, and Quinn was partly responsible for the mess. Wyatt expressed confidence that nothing would happen to Ridge, but she said that something had already happened.\n\n\nHope stated that it was just a question of whether Ridge had survived. Hope called Brooke to see if there was news. Brooke was scared and wondered why it had happened. Hope urged her mother to keep praying, and Wyatt frowned sadly as the call ended.\n\n\nHope thought of how important Ridge was to many people. She hadn't been on the best terms with him, but he'd been like a father to her all her life. Her eyes tearing up, Hope began to think of Ridge's siblings and children, and she said the family would be torn apart by something \"so unnecessary.\"\n\n\nWyatt was deeply sorry for the events, but Hope said he hadn't sent the picture. He felt responsible for his mother doing it. While he was sure his mother would pay a price, he suspected that Liam was probably beating up on Quinn at that moment. Wyatt implored Hope not to let Liam use the situation to pull Wyatt and Hope apart.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Quinn told Liam that she wouldn't allow him to milk the situation or paint her as a villain. Liam guessed she was feeling guilty, but she denied feeling it in the slightest. He said that she should feel it because she'd created the situation -- just like all the others -- but that time, she might have gotten someone killed.\n\n\nQuinn accused Liam of slandering her, but Liam raged that she'd possibly sent Ridge, the pride and joy of the Forresters, to his death. Liam insisted that he wouldn't stop until everyone knew it, and he asserted that he was holding her feet to the fire.\n\n\nQuinn was confident she wouldn't be blamed. Liam asked who else there was to blame, and she pointed the finger at Bill, who'd been more than a willing participant with her. Liam suspected that once the photo bomb had exploded, Quinn had expected Bill give up on his bride and return to Quinn.\n\n\n\"It may be a bit of a project,\" Quinn murmured. Liam called Quinn a joke and said that Bill despised her as much as Liam did and as much as the entire Forrester family would. Quinn shot up from her seat to warn him, but he said she had zero power over him. Liam declared that she was done because Ridge might be dead due to her manipulation.\n\n\nQuinn claimed she'd shown Ridge something he'd needed to see, but Liam replied that Quinn had needed Ridge to see it for her benefit. Quinn claimed to have done it for herself and for Bill and asked if Liam knew Brooke's history with men.\n\n\n\"Are you freaking kidding me right now? I would take Brooke over you any day of the week, Quinn! I would take any woman over you! You are a vile, manipulative, evil bitch!\" Liam shouted.\n\n\nFrom behind Liam, Wyatt yanked Liam around to punch Liam in the face. Liam fell on the floor, and Hope rushed into the room to see what had happened. She was shocked to see Liam laid out on the floor. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill discusses the situation with Justin. He wasn't that far in the air and surely saw Ridge fall and come up again, so he has to be there. Justin says he was concentrating on the chopper and did not see that much. He had done exactly what Bill told him to do \u0096 cool Ridge off. Bill says it was not supposed to go down this way. He just wanted to teach the dressmaker a little lesson, not kill him. Maybe he swam ashore. And Brooke must not catch wind of this. If Ridge is dead, there will be a murder rap and they both will go down. But Ridge is not dead. He's probably on one of those yachts out there and having a party. Brooke asks Bill is there is any word. And she wants to find that helicopter pilot; it's all his fault. Bill tells Justin to keep looking. Go join the search team in the lobby. He wants Justin to be on point. Katie discusses it with Eric and says Ridge is not in the water; he surely swam ashore and they will find him. She says she could kill Quinn for sending that selfie as she knew what Ridge would do. Eric says Ridge was looking for a smoking gun and Quinn always seems to be in the middle of these things. He's pretty suspicious of her motivations. Katie says her motivations are obvious. She did not want Bill marrying Brooke so she used Ridge to make sure Brooke didn't. She's looking for a miracle. Eric says she has had several in her life \u0096 with her brother's heart, her baby and the way Ridge came into her life. They won't give up now. Wyatt tells Quinn that this doesn't look good; Ridge could be dead. Quinn says he will be fine; Wyatt just needs to get Hope out of here; go for coffee. Liam continues to harp on the subject that it was only a matter of time before Quinn got completely out of control. Hope says she will deal with that when she finds out more about Ridge's fate. Liam grouses that Ridge should not have been there in first place. He was a powder keg and Quinn lit the match. Those people should not be in Hope's life and he doesn't want her near them the next time something like this happens. He scoffs at Quinn for pretending to be concerned. Now his dad is a different story. Quinn just wants Bill back so they can pick back up and continue their little affair. Quinn says okay Bill was hammered but she happened to be there and it only happened one time and she sent Ridge the photo so he'd know what he was getting into. But she did not throw him out of the helicopter so that is not her fault. Liam tells her that he and Hope disagree on this, but it is entirely her fault whatever happens to Ridge. Wyatt tells Hope that he is sorry for his part in this. She says he did nothing it was all on Quinn and she did plenty. Wyatt said he came to Hope right away when he knew but he should have deleted the selfie himself. He says he loves his mother but he hopes that Hope knows he is not okay with this. He know Liam is spewing this as much as he can and holds him just as responsible as his mother. He hopes she will not let Liam use this to pull them apart. Hope calls her mother and they both agree they are not going to give up. Quinn tells Liam that he is milking this horrible tragedy and she is not going to allow it. She's not going to let him paint her as a villain, and she does not feel the slightest bit guilty. She accuses him of slandering her to Hope and her son. He says no he is not. Ridge was the pride and joy to his family and she probably sent him to his death. She did this and he is not going to stop until everybody knows. He is going to hold her feet to the fire. Brooke says Quinn has to pay for this. She wants to know how she ended up with that photo in the first place. Bill explains it was the day she was marrying Ridge. He was drinking a lot and Quinn showed up unannounced. He was wasted and out of his head. Brooke says so Quinn seduced him. And of course because he was drunk he did not know that she took the picture. Quinn calls Bill to see if there is any latest news. He chastises her for sending the picture and tells her he knows she is Wyatt's mother but he wants nothing to do with her again. Brooke takes some of the blame. Perhaps if she had fought Ridge harder and not gotten in the helicopter none of this would have happened. Bill comforts her but says it is not her fault. It was all Quinn, not anyone else. Liam calls Quinn a joke. His dad will not go anywhere near her and neither will the rest of the Forrester's. She and Wyatt will be toast. And all because she showed Ridge a picture that she thought he needed to see ..her benefit, not his. She says she did it for Bill, just look at Brooke's history with men. He says she must be freaking crazy. He would take Brooke any old day over Quinn. He would actually take any woman over Quinn as she is a vile, manipulative evil bitch! Katie reads her favorite line of poetry. She says it is silly but she almost can not remember who she was before Ridge. She can not lose him. Eric says nor he, and they will have that life. Ridge is coming back to them.",
