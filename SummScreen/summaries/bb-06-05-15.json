He refused to let anyone shame Maya and felt that no job was more important than she was. Maya was worried about what the job meant to Rick. He exclaimed that love made people do crazy things, like quit jobs and punch out magazine moguls.\n\n\nMaya wished she'd seen Rick punch Bill. Rick was sure she'd get her chance to because Bill couldn't help but say horrible things. She said they couldn't punch Bill every time he did it. \"Well....\" Rick considered, and she decided, \"Well, just until he learns.\"\n\n\nMaya said she was just beginning to understand what she meant to Rick. He replied that it was about time. She felt that she'd spent her entire life doing it alone, and it was a new experience having a man to defend her. Rick knew she'd done fine on her own but said she wasn't on her own anymore.\n\n\nRick noted that he'd seen Nick ordering coffee downstairs. Maya asked if they'd spoken to each other, and when Rick said they hadn't, she assumed it was awkward for Rick. Rick relayed that it wasn't. He just hadn't wanted to interrupt Nick. Rick said he knew people had known about Maya and her transition before he'd ever met her, and he couldn't change that.\n\n\nMaya remarked that she'd been soul-searching, wondering what it would have been like if she'd told Rick at the beginning. Rick felt that they'd both made mistakes, but they were together and moving forward. Maya said she wouldn't blame him if his job and reputation were too much to give up.\n\n\nRick said Maya had improved his reputation. He didn't care about the tabloids, which had always hounded his family. He figured that his choice proved he was accepting and loving. He asked how it could hurt him in the public eye. She asked if that meant he really accepted her and if she wouldn't lose him. He replied that he accepted her and she wouldn't lose him. They kissed.\n\n\nAt Ridge's place, Ridge arrived, and Caroline asked if everything had gone according to plan. Ridge conveyed that her uncle had tried to pull a fast one, but it hadn't worked. He said she was looking at Forrester's new CEO. Caroline squealed and hugged him. She told him to imagine her dancing with joy for him, but he said he could imagine something else.\n\n\nCaroline replied that it would happen once she was fully healed. She couldn't wait to recover and be by his side. Ridge was planning on it and said they were a team.\n\n\nCaroline realized it was time for her doctor's appointment. Ridge offered to take her, but she said she'd get a car because he had way too many important things to do. Ridge showed her the first sketch they'd made together. He said she'd helped him draw it when he hadn't been able to. He felt that it was his turn. He told her that nothing was more important than she was.\n\n\nAt Forrester Ivy, Wyatt, and Aly learned that Ridge was the new CEO. Aly rushed to the sky lounge to tell Oliver the good news. Aly was elated about it -- as long as everyone knew their place. Oliver guessed she meant Rick, but she was referring to Steffy. Aly decided to track down her cousin to thank her for making Forrester a better place for them all -- including Ivy.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Wyatt and Ivy had Champagne with Liam and Steffy. Wyatt frowned as Steffy referred to herself and Liam as the new leaders of Forrester. Ivy noted that Ridge was the new leader, but Steffy said he couldn't have done it without the supporting shares. Steffy told Liam that they had paperwork to do, and Ivy and Wyatt left the \"bigwigs\" to do their thing.\n\n\nAlone with Liam, Steffy savored the Champagne and their victory. They signed papers, and Liam exclaimed that the whole building should be grateful that Steffy had rescued them. As they laughed and chuckled with glee about what they'd accomplished, Steffy cupped Liam's face and kissed him.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy pulled back in shock, but Aly had seen the kiss from the door that had remained ajar.\n\n\nLater, Steffy was alone, daydreaming about past kisses with Liam, when Aly charged in and announced that she'd seen Steffy kissing Liam. Aly warned Steffy that Liam was loyal and committed to Ivy. Steffy didn't feel the need to explain herself to Aly. Aly declared that Steffy was not Liam's wife or girlfriend, and all Steffy did was work with Liam.\n\n\nAly concluded that Liam was committed to someone more suitable. \"Excuse me?\" Steffy said. Aly told Steffy that Ivy, not Steffy, was the kind of woman Liam should be with. Steffy claimed that she and Liam had been celebrating, but Aly responded that she knew the signs from observing Steffy's behavior when Liam had been dating Hope.\n\n\nSteffy put her finger in Aly's face and shushed Aly. Steffy said that being in Hope's fan club didn't mean Aly had to hate on Steffy, and what Steffy did or didn't do with Liam wasn't Aly's business. Aly disagreed, saying that Ivy was her friend. Aly claimed the company as her legacy, too, and she wanted to restore the company to what it had been when their grandmother had been alive.\n\n\nAly indicated that Forrester had once had values and morals. \"Oh, I get it. And I have none,\" Steffy concluded. She figured Aly had really embraced the HFTF propaganda but asserted that one celebratory kiss with Liam didn't make Steffy morally corrupt and wouldn't interfere with Forrester's image. \"Just like you won't interfere with Liam and Ivy,\" Aly asserted.\n\n\nAly told Steffy to have some respect because the couple was what Forrester should be reflecting to the world. Aly called Ivy understated and classy. Aly was sure Liam had had a lot of fun with Steffy, but Steffy had to accept that all she'd ever be for Liam was a memory.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Wyatt and Ivy discussed winning control of Forrester. Wyatt mirthlessly cheered for his brother, and Ivy scowled. Wyatt conveyed to Ivy that having Steffy in the mix presented a whole new set of problems. Ivy was confused because, earlier, Wyatt had put his money on her. He claimed that he'd been trying to make her feel better about the situation.\n\n\nIvy stated that Liam had proven his commitment to her. Wyatt reasoned that it was an easy thing to do without Steffy being around all day, every day, but Steffy was a force who knew how insanely intelligent and beautiful she was. \"Guys just don't say 'no' to that,\" Wyatt concluded.\n\n\nIvy asked if Wyatt could say it. \"Of course not. That's my point,\" Wyatt responded. Ivy said it sounded like Steffy was luring in Wyatt, not Liam, and she asked why Wyatt didn't ask Steffy out.\n\n\nLiam arrived, and awkwardness filled the air when Ivy revealed to him that she and Wyatt had just been talking about Steffy. Liam promised Ivy that she had nothing to worry about with Steffy. Ivy disagreed because Steffy had made herself extremely available and had expressed no respect for Ivy. Liam figured that it didn't matter because he was committed to Ivy.\n\n\nIvy doubted it would stop Steffy. Liam believed that Steffy needed time. Ivy asserted that Steffy needed to open her eyes and spot all the other available men around her. Liam was sure the right guy would happen along for Steffy. Ivy relayed that he might already be around.\n\n\nWyatt chuckled shyly, and Ivy said she'd encouraged him to ask Steffy out. Wyatt asked if Liam had a problem with it. \"No, why would I?\" Liam said, straining to keep a smile on his face.\n\n\n",

He says that is the way love works. She says she is starting to understand what she means to him. He tells her to get used to idiots that he has to punch out that go after her. She is not on her own anymore. No one will ever hurt her. Aly, Wyatt and Ivy come in and asks Ridge if all turned out okay and Steffy said it did. Aly rushes to Oliver and tells him Rick is out and Ridge is in so he might have to do some re-shoots. Steffy pours the champagne and says they have paperwork to do. She gushes to Liam that they did it! Ridge goes home to Caroline who is disappointed at first then elated when she hears despite Bill's interference that Ridge is the new CEO. She says he deserves it and she is happy for him. She wishes she could do an Irish jig for him. He says they are a team and he knows she is by his side. Wyatt and Ivy chat and she says she is not worried about Steffy being back. She knows Liam is committed to her. Wyatt says Steffy is a force and sometimes men can not say no to that. She turns the tables on him and asks if he could resist Steffy and would he ask her out. Steffy pours more champagne and giggles at everything Liam says as they sign papers. They both are on a high and he even allows her (as if he could stop) to kiss him as Aly walks in and sees them. Liam leaves and Aly charges in and says she saw her throwing herself at Liam. He is committed and she has no right to do this. Ivy is more suitable. Steffy says excuse her but this is not up to Aly. Liam goes straight to Ivy and says she has no reason to worry. He is committed to Ivy and eventually the right guy will come along and she will back off. Ivy tells him that they may have found the right guy right here in Wyatt. Steffy tells Aly that just because she has been a member of Hope Logan's fan club all her life does not mean she can hate on Steffy or what she does or does not do with Liam. Aly talks about morals and values that once was. Steffy says one kiss with Liam won't corrupt FC. Aly says she is sure Steffy has some great memories but that is all it will ever be for Liam. Rick tells Maya they have both made mistakes they can not change but they can move forward and things can be improved. He does not care what the tabloids say. How can he be accepting and loving and that hurt him in the public eye.",
