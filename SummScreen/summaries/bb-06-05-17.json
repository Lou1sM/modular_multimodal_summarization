    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the photo studio, Nicole babysat Lizzy and thought of giving birth to her. Nicole's thoughts turned to the prognosis from the doctors. She picked up her phone and called Maya. To her surprise, Rick answered and said Maya was at a photo shoot.\n\n\nNicole asked Rick if her sister was skipping around the Eiffel Tower. Laughing, Rick said it was Notre-Dame, and he couldn't wait to see the proofs. Nicole asked for \"the fashion model\" to return the call when she eventually got back. Nicole's tone caused Rick to ask if something was wrong. \"I don't know, Rick. You tell me. Is there something wrong with the way that I'm taking care of Lizzy?\" Nicole asked.\n\n\n\"What?\" Rick replied. To Nicole, it didn't make any sense that Maya had scheduled Pam to watch Lizzy, and deciding to speak honestly, Nicole stated that she found it insulting.\n\n\nCoco stood in the doorway and heard Nicole saying that she'd carried Lizzy before handing her over to Rick and Maya; therefore, it should be understood that Nicole would be the one to watch the baby if Rick and Maya weren't available -- especially if it would keep happening, which wasn't what Nicole had expected when she'd given Lizzy to them. \"I expected Maya to be a mother, not fit Lizzy in between her pursuits of fame,\" Nicole quipped.\n\n\nRick asked Nicole to slow down and say what she was talking about exactly. Nicole asserted that if he needed someone to watch Lizzy, he needed to go to the woman who'd given birth to her, not Pam.\n\n\nAfter the call, Coco entered. She said she'd overheard some of the call, and she wondered if Nicole was upset with her because Maya had asked her to help out with the baby. Nicole was upset at the situation, not Coco. Nicole said Maya was scheduling all these people to watch Lizzy, but Nicole was the only one who needed to be on the schedule. Nicole felt that no one loved Lizzy more.\n\n\nIn Paris later, Maya arrived back in her hotel room and was explaining to Rick that her shoot had been cut short. She figured that they'd have to make it up the next day, but she was torn. Though she was having fun, she missed Lizzy. Maya noticed Rick's strange expression and asked if he was okay. \"Your sister called. It was weird. She was upset,\" he replied.\n\n\nMaya braced herself and asked if it was something about Lizzy. Rick conveyed Nicole's feelings about asking other people to watch Lizzy. Maya started to say why she was doing it, but Rick cut her off. He knew. In a careful tone, he explained that, because she'd given birth to Lizzy, Nicole wanted to be to one they turned to.\n\n\nMaya said she got it, and it made sense. Rick didn't think Nicole's attitude made sense. It had been as if Nicole had been questioning them as parents. Maya thought he'd misunderstood. Rick didn't think he'd misunderstood Nicole saying she'd thought Maya would be a mother more consistently than just between Maya's pursuits of fame.\n\n\nHurt, Maya proclaimed that she was a working mother, like countless other mothers. Calming down, Maya said she wouldn't let it affect her, and Nicole was just stressed out. Rick agreed, saying they'd asked a lot of Nicole. Maya decided that they'd finish up their business and get home. That way, they'd be with Lizzy, and Nicole could relax.\n\n\nMaya figured she'd jumped to conclusions when she'd figured that the newly wedded Nicole wouldn't want to watch the baby. The look on Rick's face expressed that he thought it was more serious. Maya guessed that Nicole was lashing out a bit, but it was sweet that Nicole wanted to be so involved. \"She didn't sound so sweet on the phone,\" Rick uttered.\n\n\nRick thought they needed to call Nicole back. Maya thought it was better to let it simmer down and said they'd straighten it out when they got home. Rick appeared worried.\n\n\nIn the design office, Katie anxiously waited with Ivy as, across the hall, Quinn showed some of Katie's designs to Eric and Ridge. Kate said she felt as if she was in high school, waiting to know if a teacher liked her essay.\n\n\nIvy asked if the waist chains were in the review. Katie said that they weren't all included, but she'd convinced Quinn to take in the few that she thought were the best. Katie said working at Forrester had given her the jolt she'd needed after losing her way the previous year. She felt as if she'd found it there at Forrester.\n\n\nPam arrived with a stack of boxes, and as she set them down, she asked if Katie had bought out the store. Katie was excited about the fast delivery. She'd ordered hardware so they could hit the ground running if Eric approved the waist chains. Her eyes fell on Pam's hip, around which Pam wore a gun belt with a gun holstered in it. Katie asked if Pam was on security detail.\n\n\nChuckling, Pam explained that Charlie had left his gun at her desk while he'd taken a steam room break. She didn't think it should just be lying around. In the middle of talking, Pam noticed some waist chain samples on the desk. Katie talked Pam into trying one on. Pam removed the gun belt and placed it in the sitting area next to the door.\n\n\nKatie fashioned one of her favorite pieces around Pam, who seemed a little unsure about it as Katie talked about adding sparkle to the outfit. \"You have any with pearls?\" Pam asked. Pam's phone beeped, and she realized that it was her time to take care of Lizzy. Hurriedly removing the jewelry, Pam said it was different. She grabbed her phone and took off.\n\n\nIvy told Katie that Pam had seemed to like it. Katie hoped Ridge and Eric did, too.\n\n\nBack in the photo studio, Pam arrived to pick up Lizzy, and Nicole said she was about to put the baby down for a nap. Pam decided she had time to go to her desk and get her crochet bag, but Nicole said Pam could stay at her desk.\n\n\nStammering, Pam started to explain that she was scheduled, but then she asked if Nicole wanted her to call Maya. Nicole stated that she'd said not to worry about it, and she'd be taking care of Lizzy. \"Okay,\" Pam said, and she left.\n\n\nNicole let the baby play with ostrich feathers. She told Lizzy that Pam had thought she'd take Lizzy. Nicole decided that Lizzy wouldn't be passed from person to person anymore. Lizzy made noises that sounded like, \"Mama...mommie...\" Gasping and smiling, Nicole said that she was right there. \"Mama's right here, sweetie. I'm right here,\" Nicole stated.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Eric flipped through a sketch pad and gravely said, \"My, my, my. Now I see what your concerns were.\" Ridge didn't think it was that bad. Quinn stated that the designs were. Ridge stated that they just weren't Forrester, but with experience, it could be all right. Disagreeing, Eric said they had to face it -- Katie belonged in a boardroom, not a design room, and they all knew what had to happen there.\n\n\n\"You're going to fire Katie?\" the alarmed Ridge asked. Eric said he didn't want to, but it made no sense to keep her on just because she was a friend. Quinn suggested finding something else for Katie. Eric was open to it if something else opened up, but they didn't have a boardroom type position for Katie at the time. Ridge suggested that they keep Katie in jewelry and help her.\n\n\nTo Eric, it made no sense to keep Katie if they wouldn't use her work, and Katie would be better off at a company that could use her talent. Eric asked Quinn to let Katie know. Quinn was shocked that she had to do it. He said it was protocol -- unless there was a problem. Quinn claimed there wasn't, and she and Ridge exchanged worried looks.\n\n\nQuinn and Ridge expressed to Eric that Katie was really enjoying her job and would be surprised by the firing. Eric knew it was true, but he thought Katie was a rational person who'd understand that it wasn't working. He offered to step in afterward if the need arose.\n\n\n\"I'll go with you. Come on,\" Ridge said. Eric stopped Ridge because Eric didn't want Katie to feel as if they were ganging up on her. He told Quinn that it was her job, and she'd take care of it.\n\n\nQuinn left, and Eric acknowledged that Ridge seemed worried. Eric told Ridge that it didn't make sense to keep Katie in a job where she didn't belong, and it didn't benefit her for them to create a position for her that they didn't need. Eric thought it would make Katie feel useless. He said Katie didn't want pity, and they needed to let her find a position of power and purpose.\n\n\nEric believed Katie valued honesty. He didn't want to lie to her and say she had a future designing jewelry. Ridge understood Eric's view, but he was worried that something could go terribly wrong with Quinn talking to Katie alone. Eric thought Katie would be fine, but Ridge wanted to be there in case there was a problem.\n\n\nEric asked if Ridge knew something that Eric didn't. Eric knew that it was his son's urge to ride to the rescue, but Eric said Katie and Quinn might surprise Ridge.\n\n\nBack in the design office, Quinn arrived and asked to speak to Katie alone. Ivy exited, and Katie asked what Eric had said. Quinn stated that he'd taken his time in considering. Katie figured he'd deliberated which pieces to include in the collection and said some could go in the next collection. Quinn replied that it wouldn't happen, and they wouldn't use any of them.\n\n\nKatie didn't believe it because of what Eric had said the previous night. Quinn explained that it had been before he'd seen the designs. Quinn said everyone had skill sets, and Katie might be more the executive type than the design type. Katie asked if Eric was changing her position. Hanging her head, Quinn said Eric was letting Katie go.\n\n\n\"I'm fired?\" Katie asked. Quinn thought it was a harsh word and said Katie was being let go. Katie couldn't believe that Quinn was doing it. Quinn readily said it wasn't her. Katie wouldn't believe that Eric would do it and said he was her friend. Quinn claimed the friendship was why Eric thought Katie would understand that he was doing what he had to for the business.\n\n\n\"Finding the right fit for you -- \" Quinn stated. Interrupting, Katie asked if there was a fit for her at Forrester. Quinn replied that there wasn't one at that time, but Eric hadn't been specific. Katie called Quinn unbelievable. Quinn asked Katie not to take it personally and started explaining that the jewelry line wasn't big enough to justify it. Quinn thought Katie was better suited for dealing with numbers.\n\n\nKatie decided that Quinn was telling Katie that she didn't belong there, and Katie asked how Quinn dared to dictate to Katie and fire her. Katie yelled that Quinn was the one who didn't belong there. Katie asked how it kept happening and how people like Quinn kept getting what they wanted. Katie accused Quinn of lying constantly and cheating while Katie always did her best to be good and play by the rules.\n\n\n\"I lose every time! You get to be evil, committing crime after crime, but it doesn't matter! No punishment! You get rewarded!\" Katie yelled. \"You get to live in a house with a man who loves you! I ask for one thing -- one thing that's mine,\" Katie continued. Quinn desperately replied that not everyone was cut out for jewelry design. Katie said it had nothing to do with the jewelry line. It had to do with Quinn, who'd ruined everything.\n\n\nQuinn asked for a chance to see what she could do, but Katie retorted that Quinn wanted to find a meaningless job to keep Katie's mouth shut. Katie gloated about knowing Quinn's dirty secret and said she thought Quinn was smarter. Katie stated that Quinn had to know that if she manipulated Eric into firing Katie, Katie would never stay quiet.\n\n\nQuinn replied that Katie had agreed to stay quiet because it was the right thing to do for Eric. Quinn was hopeful that Katie would get another job -- maybe even at Forrester. Katie went off about never having to answer to the morally bankrupt Quinn, who thought she didn't have to answer for what she'd done. Katie started getting pushy and grabby as she said Quinn was going to pay for everything she'd done.\n\n\n\"Just stop!\" Quinn yelled, shoving Katie. Katie flew back and landed on the furniture near the door.  As Quinn caught her breath, she saw Katie rebound with a gun in her hand. Quinn yelled for Katie to put it down.\n\n\n\"Winners and losers,\" Katie said. Aiming the gun, Katie continued, \"That's the kind of world we live in. A world where women like me are alone, but people like you go home to a beautiful house, to a beautiful man who loves her. You have no idea what it's like to lose. Maybe I should change that. Maybe I should do it and get rid of you once and for all.\"\n\n \n\n",

He tells Quinn and Ridge they will have to fire Katie if they cannot use her designs and there is no place else in the company right now for her. He wants Quinn to tell her. Not even Ridge can go with her. He does not want Katie to feel ganged up on. Ridge shows his reservations but Eric stands firm that they cannot just create another position where Katie is not needed. She will know. Nicole calls Maya but she gets Rick instead since Maya is on a photo shoot. He senses something is wrong and Nicole admits it is insulting for Maya to just leave and go where she wants and asked Pam to watch Lizzy instead of her who carried her for nine months. Pam stops by to see Ivy and just happens to have Charlie's holster with gun around her hips. Seems Charlie is in the steam room on his break. Pam takes it off long enough to admire some of the jewelry. Then she gets an urgent call and has to go. Quinn goes in to talk to Katie after excusing Ivy. Gently she tells her they are not going to use her jewelry designs and they have no more room for her in any executive position so they are letting her go. Rick explains to Maya how upset Nicole is about her working and then not asking Nicole to care for Lizzy. Rick says they are asking a lot of Nicole and she is just upset. Nicole tells Pam that she can go back to her desk as she is taking care of Lizzy just fine. Ridge tells Eric that he is just afraid with Quinn going in to see Katie alone that something could go wrong. Katie blames it all on Quinn as she knows Eric would never fire her. Quinn says she need not take this personally. It was Eric's decision. Katie gets all fired up and laments that Quinn always gets what she wants. She says she does her best to play by the rules but she loses every time to evil people like Quinn. This has nothing to do with the jewelry line. Quinn just manages to ruin everything. Nicole responds to Lizzy calling out mama and says that she is being passed on from person to person but no more. Eric tells Ridge that he might be surprised how well this will go with Katie. Quinn assures Katie that she will get another job. Katie rants that she knows her dirty little secret and she will pay and she will make sure of it. They struggle and shove each other. Katie falls backward and she lands in the chair right next to the gun. She picks it up and with shaking hands aims it at Quinn while ranting maybe she should do everyone a favor once and for all.",
