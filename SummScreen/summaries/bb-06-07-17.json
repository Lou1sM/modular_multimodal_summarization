Katie closed in and had Quinn in the crosshairs of the telescope lens. \"God, I hate that woman,\" Katie said. Katie stepped away from the telescope and paced, but Ivy interrupted her.\n\n\nKatie said it wasn't a good time to visit. Ivy countered that she had wanted to check on Katie because Katie had been so upset. Katie complained that she had been fired \"by Quinn of all people. I'm so angry I could scream.\"\n\n\nKatie said that Quinn and Ridge maintained that nothing was going on between them, but Katie said they were clearly romantic. She was convinced something was going on. She had seen them embrace in Quinn's office.\n\n\nIvy defended Quinn and Ridge. Ivy said Ridge had been comforting Quinn, and Quinn had been upset because Katie had held a gun on her. Ivy tried to remind Katie that getting fired wasn't personal. It was business.\n\n\nKatie argued that it was all personal. Katie had the power to destroy Quinn. Katie shouted that Quinn was dangerous. \"I can't stand by and watch. She needs to be stopped once and for all,\" Katie said.\n\n\nIvy tried to understand and to calm Katie down, but Katie ranted that Quinn had given her a job to keep her quiet. \"She gets away with everything, and you have some bizarre loyalty to her,\" Katie shouted. Katie continued to complain about everything that Quinn had done and that she had hurt Eric.\n\n\nIvy tried again to calm Katie, but Katie grew more irritated. \"She's a horrible and despicable person. I'm tired of talking about this. Leave. Get out of my house. Go,\" Katie shouted. Ivy left.\n\n\nAt the Forrester house, Quinn was in the living room, and she poured coffee. Ridge joined her and said he had no coffee in the guesthouse. Quinn didn't want them to be together anywhere.\n\n\nRidge drank some coffee and wondered where Eric was. Quinn said he was at the office. Ridge wondered why she had not also left for the office. Quinn explained that she was in no hurry. She feared seeing Katie, but Ridge said Katie wouldn't be there. Quinn was afraid of what Katie would do.\n\n\nQuinn argued that Katie was a loose cannon, and they had no idea how dangerous she could be. Ridge encouraged her to let it go. He disagreed that Katie was dangerous. Quinn replied that Katie blamed her for everything.\n\n\nQuinn said that Katie had been watching their every move and was waiting for them to make a mistake. Ridge said nothing would happen. He left for work.\n\n\nOn a plane returning from Paris, Maya and Rick discussed that they'd had to cut their trip short. Rick acknowledged that they had accomplished a lot. Maya couldn't wait to hold Lizzy in her arms. Rick noted that their daughter had excellent care with Pam, Nicole, Coco, Zende, and the others fighting over who could babysit her. They laughed, but Maya said that Nicole had seemed stressed out. She worried that Nicole had implied Maya wasn't a responsible parent. \"Maybe something is going on with Nicole,\" Maya said. Rick said they would be landing soon.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Nicole took care of Lizzy and told Zende that the baby had eaten all her breakfast. She added that Maya had left a message that she and Rick were heading home. Zende noted that it had been enjoyable to take care of Lizzy for a few days. Julius showed up and asked to see his granddaughter. Nicole said it was time for Lizzy's nap. She added that Rick and Maya were on their way home.\n\n\nZende and Julius agreed that Nicole was a natural as a mom. Zende added that they would soon have intelligent, kind, and giving children of their own. Zende left for work.\n\n\nJulius reiterated that Nicole would have a baby of her own soon. Julius was worried that Nicole had lost faith. He wanted her to believe it would happen. He insisted that there was no way God would not reward her with a child after she had given her daughter to Rick and Maya.\n\n\nJulius admitted he had started to question everything about the surrogacy after he had seen the bond Nicole had with the baby. \"You are her mother; don't you ever forget that,\" Julius said. Julius continued to praise her as a mom.\n\n\nMaya entered and grabbed Lizzy. She praised Nicole for being the best aunt for Lizzy. Julius asked about Paris. Maya said she had canceled a photo shoot because she had missed her daughter so much. Maya cradled the baby and told Lizzy she was Maya's world, her everything. Nicole and Julius watched.\n\n\nAt Katie's, after Ivy had left, Katie returned to her telescope, but she could see no one on the veranda. She walked away from the telescope and angrily paced in her living room.\n\n\nLater, Quinn returned to the veranda and looked out over the view. She flashed back to Ridge's promise that Katie would never hurt anyone and that Katie had been angry but would never harm Quinn or anyone.\n\n\nQuinn appeared to be inside the crosshairs of the viewer on Katie's telescope. However, the picture changed to reveal a shotgun, not a telescope. A gloved hand slowly pulled the trigger, and a shot rang out.\n\n",
    "imdb": "Ivy pays Katie a visit in hopes to calm down her anger about being let go from Forrester Creations. Katie is unable to rid her mind of thoughts of hatred towards her nemesis. She quickly shows Ivy out and takes another look through her telescope to watch Quinn. Meanwhile, Ridge checks in on Quinn and realizes that she is genuinely concerned for her safety after the gun incident in the office. On the way home to L.A., Rick and Maya agree that cutting short their trip to Paris was the right decision because Nicole sounded really stressed out over the phone. Zende is touched when he watches Nicole playing with Lizzy. After Zende leaves for work, Julius comforts Nicole. Then, Maya walks into the house and is thrilled to be reunited with her daughter. Deep in thoughts, Quinn takes a deep breath on the terrace of the Forrester Mansion. Suddenly from the distance, a gunshot is fired at Quinn.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn sips coffee as she takes a stroll out of her balcony looking at the view below. Katie is looking at her through her telescope with a sour look on her face. She mutters that she hates that woman. Katie says Quinn is dangerous and needs to be stopped once and for all. Nicole tells Julius that Rick and Maya should be arriving soon and she is coming straight here to see Lizzy. Julius says she should have been keeping her the entire time instead of Coco and RJ. She carried her for nine months and he knows she gave her up but she is her mother and they bonded. No one could prepare her for that. On the plane, Maya tells Rick that she would have loved to have stayed in Paris but she just couldn't stand it another day. She wanted to see Lizzy and hold her in her arms. Zende looks at Nicole holding Lizzy and says she is going to be the best mom. She will have that baby like Lizzy running around in no time. Ridge helps himself to the coffee saying he is completely out in the guest house. He thought Quinn would be at work. She says no, she was not in that big a hurry. Ridge senses she is afraid and says Katie will not be there. She says still she is afraid of what she might do now that she fired her. Ivy drops in on Katie who is not happy to see her. She says she was just fired so she is not in a great mood. She repeats again that she hates that woman and makes a fist with her two hands like around her neck. Ridge argues with Quinn that the gun was not loaded and Katie knew that and she has promised not to do anything like that again. Quinn said for a while the job at FC placated her but now Katie just thinks she is evil and she would be better off dead. She thinks she is losing her mind. Ivy tells Katie that she knows she is upset but there are other things she can do. Katie shuts her up and says they both know why Quinn gave her that job and that was to shut her up. Ivy is being treated like crap and yet she is lapping it up. Quinn is a miserable person and does not deserve to live. She wants Ivy to just get out of her house and go. She goes back to the telescope but sees no one this time. Quinn tells Ridge that she hopes he is right but she knows Katie will be watching them and trying to catch them in another encounter. He tells her she should feel good that she does not have to work with Katie anymore. He knows Quinn is a survivor and she will survive this. Julius tells Nicole that it is lovely seeing mother and daughter. Lizzy knows she is her mother. Maya rushes in and can't wait to grab Lizzy out of Nicole's arms. Julius says is must be hard on a mother separated from their child. He's looking right at Nicole. Maya says that Rick will be home soon and them a family again. She is an angel and she loves her so much. Nicole looks guilty. Quinn walks out on the balcony. Her face is in the cross hairs of a telescope and a shot rings out.",
