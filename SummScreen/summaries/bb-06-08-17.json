    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the Forrester balcony, Quinn screamed when she heard a gunshot, and dust from the wall behind her fell around her. She looked up, saw a small hole in the wall, and ran in the house.\n\n\nRidge arrived in the foyer, asking if he'd just heard a gunshot. Quinn frantically squealed that it had been aimed at her, and someone had tried to kill her. Grabbing his arm, she begged him not to go out there.\n\n\nAfter Ridge had called the police later, he told Quinn that they were on their way. He asked if she'd seen \"him.\" Quinn said the shooter might be a \"her,\" as in Katie.\n\n\nRidge didn't believe it and said Katie wasn't a violent person. He stated that Katie didn't even own a gun. Quinn cited that Katie had pulled a gun on her the other day without needing to own it. Quinn wasn't saying that it was Katie, but Quinn wouldn't rule it out, either. Ridge asked if Quinn knew who it could be. Quinn said that, in the past, she'd be able to make him a list, but at the time, there was only one person.\n\n\nAcross the hillside, an upset Katie stared out of her window with a tear on her face.\n\n\nWhen the police arrived, the crime scene investigators collected evidence on the balcony. Ridge explained to Lieutenant Baker what had happened with the gunshot. Ridge said that the bullet had hit the wall, not Quinn, who had gone to Katie Logan's house. Ridge revealed that Quinn thought Katie had shot at Quinn. Baker asked why Quinn would think that, and Ridge explained that Quinn had fired Katie. \"And Katie may have pulled a gun on Quinn at the office,\" Ridge added.\n\n\nBaker asked if Katie had taken a gun to work. Ridge explained that it had been Charlie's unloaded gun, and Katie had been trying to get a rise out of Quinn. Ridge said the police needed to search Katie's house for guns, but Baker replied that he needed a search warrant for that. Ridge thought Quinn's belief that Katie had shot at her should be sufficient.\n\n\nClaiming to know Katie Logan, Baker said it didn't sound like her -- unless there was something more going on between Katie and Quinn.\n\n\nLater, Baker was going over Ridge's statement. Ridge said the bullet had been meant for Quinn alone. It had been a head-high shot, and Baker believed that Quinn was lucky to be alive.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie was running water in the kitchen when someone knocked on her door. Wiping her hands on a towel, Katie strode to the door and answered it. Quinn waltzed in and asked where it was. Katie asked what Quinn was referring to, and Quinn asked where the gun that Katie had tried to kill her with was. Katie said it was Charlie's gun, and she didn't know where the \"hell\" it was.\n\n\nQuinn said she'd been on the patio, and the bullet had missed her head by inches. Katie asked what bullet. Shocked, Katie asked if Quinn thought Katie had shot at her. Quinn yelled that the office hadn't been a good place because it had too many witnesses. Katie stated that she had to have really freaked Quinn out, and Quinn had lost her mind. Quinn was outraged at the idea of cold-blooded murder on her own patio and asserted that Katie had to really want her dead.\n\n\nKatie couldn't believe Quinn thought Katie had shot at her. Quinn asked if Katie had done it. Katie replied that if she had, she'd clearly missed. Quinn asked who it had been if not Katie. Katie asked if she should make a list, and Quinn asked if Katie thought it was funny. Katie quipped that it was insulting and rude.\n\n\nStating that Katie's house looked across to hers, Quinn looked at the window and saw Katie's telescope. Quinn peered into it and exclaimed that it was aimed at her patio. She asked if Katie had been spying on her. Katie said she had been because of Quinn's thing with her husband's son. Quinn asked how many times she had to say nothing was going on.\n\n\nKatie believed Quinn was lying to her. Katie declared that Quinn was right, and Katie was watching. Katie said she'd keep watching until Quinn was gone. \"Until I'm dead, you mean,\" Quinn corrected. Quinn said the police were at her house. Katie replied that she hadn't tried to kill Quinn. Kate said that Quinn could threaten her, fire her, or whatever Quinn wanted, but Katie wasn't going anywhere and would be there until it was over -- until Quinn was over.\n\n\nQuinn uttered that Katie reminded Quinn of someone, someone Quinn used to be. Katie ordered Quinn to get out.\n\n\nQuinn left, and sometime later, Katie was crying and hysterical, yelling that Quinn thought Katie was like her, but Katie was nothing like Quinn. Katie peered through her telescope for a moment. Slowly, she raised her head from it with a blank but stormy expression.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Quinn was telling Baker about the bullet whizzing by her head. She exclaimed that she'd been inches from being killed. Baker wanted to know why Quinn had gone to the house of the person she thought had shot at her. Quinn said Katie had denied it and had claimed she hadn't even heard the shot. Quinn said it hadn't been the smartest move, but no one could just take a shot at her.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'll speak to her,\" Baker murmured when Ridge asked if Baker would question Katie. Quinn was outraged that Baker was planning to merely \"speak\" to Katie, the attempted murderer on the loose. Baker stated that Katie was many things, but not a killer. Quinn asked if he needed a body and said it was what he'd have if he didn't arrest Katie.\n\n\n\"She has a telescope, Ridge!\" Quinn exclaimed. Baker replied, \"So?\" Quinn asserted that it was pointed at her patio. Baker said he'd pay Katie a visit after they analyzed the evidence and ascertained where the bullet had come from. Quinn insisted that Baker go to Katie's and find the gun, but Baker said he'd already told Ridge that the police needed a warrant. Quinn told him to hurry up and get one before Katie got rid of the weapon.\n\n\nBaker asked if Quinn thought Katie hated her enough to shoot her. Quinn didn't know and said everyone had their breaking points. Lt. Baker advised Quinn to stay put and to stop going around, accusing people.\n\n\nBaker took Ridge aside to talk. Quinn crept out to her terrace doors. As she barely peeped her head through the doorway to look around, either the rifle scope or the telescope with the crosshairs on the lens zoomed on her face.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Zende was sketching while Rick was talking about the trip. He said he and Maya had wanted to stay longer, but they hadn't been able to wait to get back to their daughter. Zende responded that he and Nicole would have kept Lizzy longer. Rick said he and Maya had thought about it, but they hadn't wanted to spend one more minute away from Lizzy.\n\n\n\"Plus, I got a call from Nicole,\" Rick stated. He relayed that it had been kind of weird, and Nicole hadn't sounded like herself. Zende revealed that there was a reason for it, and he and Nicole were going through something.\n\n\nLater, Rick asked Zende if they were sure. Zende discussed the views of Nicole's doctors, but he reasoned that he and Nicole hadn't been trying that long. Zende said he wouldn't let it deter him, and positive thinking bred positive outcomes. Rick admired the sentiment, and Zende replied that he wouldn't give up on his wife.\n\n\nRick reflected on the miracle of having a child that was part Avant and part Forrester. Zende remarked that Nicole had made it happen. Rick believed she'd make it happen for Zende, too, and in the meantime, Rick wanted to talk to his father on Zende's behalf. Zende said Rick didn't have to, and Zende and Nicole wanted to avoid medical intervention. Zende stated that Lizzy was a beautiful child, and Zende had to believe things would work out as they should.\n\n\nJust then, Carter arrived with some paperwork for Rick. Zende decided to take off and thanked Rick for the talk. Once Zende had gone, Carter said it was about Lizzy, and there was an adoption issue. Carter just needed some signatures. The original adoption papers contained some errors, mostly clerical. \"A name, a check box. That kind of stuff,\" Carter explained.\n\n\nCarter had a corrected document, and it needed new signatures on it from Rick, Maya, and Nicole. Rick asked when Carter needed it. Sensing Rick's hesitation, Carter asked if there was a problem. Rick said there shouldn't be, and he asked to see the document.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Nicole watched Maya play with Lizzy. Maya was saying she and Lizzy had missed each other, and it was a good thing Lizzy had had \"auntie\" Nicole. Maya took Lizzy upstairs for a nap. When Maya returned, she asked if Nicole had enjoyed her time with Lizzy and if Lizzy had been any trouble. Nicole said Lizzy was never trouble.\n\n\nMaya noted that Nicole had sounded stressed on their phone calls while Maya had been gone. Nicole revealed that Dr. Caspary had said that Nicole might not be able to have another child. Nicole explained that the secondary fertility could have resulted from the pregnancy. Maya tried to comfort her sister, but Nicole said she was done crying over it.\n\n\nMaya asked how Zende had handled it. Nicole said he'd been supportive, and he wouldn't let her go to a dark place. Zende believed that they'd have a child of their own. Maya reasoned that it could happen, and they hadn't been trying very long. The news had been quite a shock to Nicole, who'd never thought she wouldn't be able to get pregnant again.\n\n\nNicole had thought Zende would just look at her, and \"boom, pregnant.\" She believed that he really wanted a family, and she needed to do it for him. Maya encouraged her sister to have faith. She said that Nicole had given them Lizzy, and Nicole would give Zende a son or daughter just like Lizzy. Maya believed Nicole would have her own family someday.\n\n\nMaya understood the reason for Nicole's demeanor over the phone the other day and wished Nicole had said something. Nicole hadn't wanted to burden Maya with it during her photo shoots. Maya asserted that there had to be something they could do.\n\n\nNicole replied that her sister was sounding like Zende, who'd been positive even though it weighed on him. Nicole said family meant everything to him, and she knew what it would do to him if he knew that she'd given the only child she'd ever have to Maya and Rick.\n\n\nLater, Nicole carried Lizzy into the living room, and Maya said there was nothing like a baby to lift the spirits. She figured that Nicole and Lizzy had bonded while Maya had been away. Nicole replied that Zende and Lizzy had, too. Maya said that Lizzy was a part of Nicole, and the two would always feel connected.\n\n\n\"Literally,\" Nicole said. She felt it deeply and saw \"so much\" of herself in Lizzy. Agreeing, Maya said Lizzy smiled like Nicole. Nicole told Lizzy that she'd always be there for Lizzy, and nothing would ever change it. Maya agreed that nothing would, and taking Lizzy from Nicole, Maya said that Nicole would someday have a boy or girl of her own.\n\n\n",

Zende then explains about Nicole's diagnosis. Nicole reveals to Maya that she might not be able to carry another child of her own. A shocked Maya tells her sister to remain optimistic. Meanwhile, Carter informs Rick that there is an issue with Lizzie's adoption. There were errors on the document they filed, so Rick, Maya, and Nicole must sign a new one. Lt.

Later, Quinn barges into Katie's and accuses her of attempted murder. Katie is insulted and shouts that she is not a killer. Quinn is not convinced at all, especially after she spots the telescope with which Katie has been watching her home.",
    "tvmega_recap": "With Quinn out on the balcony, an unidentified shooter fires a gun just past her head. She runs into the house. She rants at Ridge that someone was aiming at her. He needs to go check it out. She even implies that it might not be a man; it might be Katie. Ridge says the police will be here any minute but he does not think it is Katie. Quinn says she is not saying she is but she also is not ruling her out. Lt. Baker takes notes and Ridge tells him how Katie pulled a gun on Quinn at the office and thinks this might be her now. Quinn knocks on Katie's door and wants to know where the gun is. She says she was out on her patio and that shot missed her by just a couple of inches. There were too many witnesses at the office so now she did it in private. She really wants her dead. Rick confides in Zende that Nicole called overseas and did not seem like herself. She was out of sorts. Zende says yes there is a reason as they are going through something. He tells Rick that he is not giving up on this and will keep a positive attitude. Maya tells Nicole the same thing. She sounded a little stressed when they talked over the phone. Nicole explains that she saw her doctor and she might not be able to have another child. Zende has been wonderful and refuses to accept this. But it has been a big shock to both of them. She knows how much Zende wants to have a family and now she needs to do that. Maya said she did it for her and Rick and she knows she will be able to do that for Zende. Nicole says she hopes so as Zende will be very upset if he knows the only child she could have and then gave to Maya and Rick. Katie tells Quinn that she cannot be serious if she thinks seriously that she took a shot at her. It is insulting and rude. Katie laments that she is not a killer. Then Quinn sees the telescope and looks through it and sees it is aimed right at her patio. Katie has been spying on her. Katie says yes. She has been spying on her and she is going to keep doing it. She can fire her but she is not going anywhere. She is here until it is all over and Quinn is over. Katie orders Quinn out of her house. Carter tells Rick that he has some corrections to be made on a document; mainly just technical. And it needs to be sooner than later. Maya agrees that Lizzy is so much like Nicole; even her personality and smile and someday she will have her own precious one. Katie rants while looking through the telescope that how dare Quinn come into her home and say those things .she is nothing like her. Lt. Baker questions Quinn and then wonders why Quinn went over to Katie's if she thought she was the one who shot at her. Quinn says he needs to go arrest her. He says he cannot go until he gets a warrant and then they will inspect the house to see if the bullet came from that direction. He tells Quinn to stay put and do not go around accusing people. Quinn doesn't exactly listen to him. She slips out on the balcony again, almost in the same spot as she was when the first bullet came whizzing by her head.",
