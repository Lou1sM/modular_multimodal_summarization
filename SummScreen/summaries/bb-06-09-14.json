    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's office, Quinn asked where Hope was, and Wyatt stated that Hope had gone with Liam, who Quinn had practically handed Hope over to. Quinn figured that Wyatt might as well blame her, just as everybody else was doing, and he asserted that people blamed her because things were her fault.\n\n\nQuinn yelled that she wasn't responsible for Ridge's flight to Abu Dhabi or his helicopter fall. Wyatt didn't care how she saw it, but he refused to lose Hope over it. Quinn asked what \"we'd\" do about it. \"We?\" Wyatt asked. She reasoned that since he thought it was her fault, she'd help him fix things.\n\n\nShaking his head, Wyatt tried to explain to his mother that Ridge was floating facedown in the sea, Wyatt and Quinn were bound to lose their jobs, and Hope was \"pissed\" at him for punching Liam. \"Yes, but that felt good, didn't it?\" Quinn exclaimed.\n\n\nWyatt reminded his mother that Hope had warned them not to pull any more dirty tricks. Quinn was sure that Wyatt was overreacting, and Hope would never be satisfied with Liam. \"I have a plan,\" Quinn announced, and Wyatt replied, \"Oh, no.\"\n\n\nQuinn went into the hall and searched Pam's desk until she found some keys. Quinn took the keys to Wyatt and announced they were keys to the Big Bear cabin. When Wyatt got upset, Quinn noted that Liam was getting alone time with Hope and asked if Wyatt wanted some, too.\n\n\nWyatt replied that he did, and Quinn said that the cabin was where it had all begun for Hope and Wyatt. Holding the keys out to him, she suggested that he call Hope before she did something with Liam that Wyatt and Hope would both regret. Wyatt took the keys and exited.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Hope thanked Liam for waiting and giving her time. When she kissed him, he winced, and she noted that his face was still sore. Liam said he'd be ready for round two, but she asserted that there shouldn't have been a first round. He replied that their reunion had been worth it.\n\n\nTalk turned to Ridge, and Hope expressed worry about him being missing for such a long time. Liam asked her to forget his earlier pessimism and keep the faith that Ridge had survived.\n\n\nHope felt like an idiot for not listening to Liam about Quinn. Hope asked if he realized that they'd be married had it not been for Quinn flying Steffy there on Hope's wedding day. Hope felt as if Quinn had dangled her like a puppet and was grateful that Liam had hung in there.\n\n\nLiam was ready to move on with his life with Hope, but Hope said she had to talk to Wyatt first. Liam understood because Wyatt had meant a lot to her. Hope added that she'd felt something honest with Wyatt. She'd ignored the schemes, but Quinn sending the picture to Ridge had been the last straw.\n\n\nLiam feared that Quinn had no sense of right and wrong and that something bad could happen due to the next prank. He noted that the photo scheme could result in Ridge's death, and Liam asserted that the more time someone spent around the Fullers, the more danger they were in.\n\n\nHope felt sorry for Wyatt, who had a mother like that. Liam did, too, but he felt that Wyatt had to cut ties with Quinn. Hope decided to go see Wyatt, and Liam replied that he'd be waiting.\n\n\nHope left, and later, Liam opened the front door for Quinn, who was glad that he was alone. \"Why? So no one will find the body?\" he asked. Brushing past him to get into the house, she asked where Hope was. He replied that Hope would be back, but Quinn told him not to count on that. He decided that he would count on it because he and Hope were together \"now,\" for good.\n\n\nLiam said that Hope was at the office, breaking things off with Wyatt. Liam had assumed that Quinn would be there, too, cheerleading for Wyatt. Quinn replied that her son had things well in hand \"over at the office.\" Quinn was sure that, even if Hope were upset with Quinn, Hope wouldn't leave Wyatt. Quinn stated that there would be a broken heart that night, but it wouldn't be her son's.\n\n\nOn her phone in her car, Hope told Wyatt that she was headed to the office to talk to him. Wyatt requested that she meet him at Big Bear instead. She didn't think it was a good idea, but he said that he was already there. She hesitated, but he asked if she wanted to have their talk in a sterile office. She replied that she didn't and agreed to head to the cabin.\n\n\nWhen Hope arrived at Big Bear, she saw that the living room was lit with dozens of candles. She found a frame with digital pictures of herself and Wyatt. Wyatt appeared, and she asked how he'd even gotten in there. Hope figured out that it had been his mother. Shrugging, Wyatt said that once in a while, Quinn had a good idea. \"And most of the time, she doesn't,\" Hope bit out.\n\n\nHope asked if Quinn was in the other room, but Wyatt said it wasn't about Quinn. He claimed to only condone about two percent of the things his mother \"does,\" but he couldn't let Liam trash-talk Quinn. Hope said that Quinn had crossed the line and hurt someone that Hope loved.\n\n\nWyatt responded that he and his mother were completely different people, and he hoped that Hope hadn't forgotten who he and Hope were. He stated that he'd walked around the grounds to remember how it had begun for them. He wanted to remind Hope of the beginning and to remember the footloose guy who'd found someone to prize above his freedom.\n\n\nWyatt insisted that his mother had done something stupid, but he hadn't. He refused to lose someone he loved over something he'd had nothing to do with. He asserted that he didn't want it to end that way, and he sensed that Hope didn't, either.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick, Caroline, Maya, and Carter told Aly, Oliver, Pam, and Charlie about Ridge's trip and his fall from a helicopter. The group pored over maps and theorized that Ridge could have swum ashore, or a boat could have picked him up. Rick asked why a boat hadn't contacted authorities. Rick said Thorne was headed there, and Katie, Eric, and Thorne wouldn't leave without Ridge.\n\n\nPam and Charlie didn't understand why Ridge, who was engaged to Katie, would go after Brooke, and Pam asked if Katie was okay with Ridge's actions. Oliver said that Ridge and Brooke would always be close, and Rick noted that Katie had her own issues with Brooke marrying Bill. Aly asked what had made Ridge suddenly fly halfway across the world. Pam pressed to know, too, and Rick admitted that Quinn had shown Ridge a picture of herself with Bill Spencer.\n\n\nAly didn't understand the significance of the picture, and at everyone's conspicuous glances, Aly figured out that it had been sexual. Pam got angry that the \"hyena\" had been involved, and she was sure Quinn had done it because she wanted Bill. Pam asserted that Quinn had known exactly how Ridge would react to that picture. \"That woman is the devil!\" Pam declared. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope kisses Liam and thanks him for giving her this time. He thanks her for just coming back to him. He even thinks the bloodied face was worth it. Hope says there will not be a Round Two, should not have been a Round One even. She can not believe that once again she was taken in by Quinn. She and Liam would be married right now if it weren't for her. He says that's just it, past tense. She is sorry for all the things she has put Liam through these past few months. He says he would have gone through a lot worse and it would have been worth it. She says she is so grateful that he hung in there. Liam says there is not another Hope Logan out there so it makes it sort of easy. Quinn tells Wyatt to go ahead and blame her when he says she practically handed Liam the winning ticket to Hope. She says everybody else is blaming her, but she is tired of everyone pointing fingers because she sent Ridge a photo and he flew off to Abu Dhabi and fell out of a helicopter. Wyatt says fine, whatever, but he is not going to lose Hope over this. She says if it is her fault then let her help him fix it. He says she has done enough. Ridge is probably floating face down in the water and Hope is pissed at him for decking Liam. Hope warned them no more dirty tricks. She was ready to make her decision. Quinn says never mind, she will not choose Liam. Wyatt is over re-acting and Hope loves him and will never be satisfied with Liam and that is a fact. She has a plan. Rick calls the group together and explains Ridge's accident. He had gone there to try and stop the wedding. Maya tells Aly that he is missing; they have not found him yet. Pam and Charlie agree that there are lots of boats in that area so perhaps someone picked him up. Rick says no one is giving up. Eric and Katie are already there and Thorne is on his way. Quinn sneaks into Pam's desk and lifts some keys. She takes them back to Wyatt, keys to Big Bear Cabin. He's not happy with her for lifting them. She explains that Hope is with Liam. He's getting one on one time with Hope and Wyatt isn't. So if he wants that same time, then take her to Big Bear where it all began ..the mountains, the woods and do it now. Call her before something happens with Liam that they will all regret. Wyatt takes the keys. Liam asks Hope if she is ready to get on with their lives. She says yes but she needs to talk to Wyatt first. She hopes Liam understands. He does but he says the more time anyone spends with them, the more danger they are in and she is no exception. She says she feels sorry for Wyatt with a mother like that. Liam says he does too, but Wyatt's a grown man and needs to cut his ties with her. And he thinks Hope needs to cut ties with both of them. Hope gets Wyatt's phone call while she is in her car planning on going to the office to talk to him. He says he has a request for her to meet him at Big Bear. She doesn't think that is a good idea. He says he is already there and this is better than a sterile office. So she agrees to go. Quinn shows up at Liam's. He taunts her that Hope is not there but will be back. They are back together this time for good. Hope steels herself before she goes into the cabin, fireplace and candles all aglow. She guesses that Quinn got the keys. He says every now and then Quinn has a good idea. He only condones about 2% of what she does. But she is his mother and he could not let Liam trash her that way. She says she hurt someone she loves. Wyatt understands but says that was her, not him. They are two completely different people and he hopes she will not forget who they are. He says he has already taken a walk, a few more clothes on this time. He almost felt overdressed. But he wanted to show her where it all began. He was this footloose guy who enjoyed his freedom until he met someone that meant even more. ..there was the first kiss .and nothing has changed. Yes his mother did something utterly stupid but it was his mother, not him. He knows she is upset and he is too, but he can't let her hold that against him. He will not lose the only woman he has ever loved over something that he had nothing to do with. It can't end like this and he knows she does not want it to either.",
