Ridge entered and said that he had talked to her doctor. \"He thinks it's time to put some weight on your legs,\" Ridge announced. Caroline agreed, but she asked about his first big day as CEO. He said it had been fine, but it wasn't the same. \"Cause I miss you. You're my number one priority,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nCaroline said her therapy was going well. Ridge said she was \"stronger than you think.\" He encouraged her. \"We're a team. I need you there,\" Ridge said. Caroline agreed she wanted the same thing. \"Let me help you,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nCaroline looked skeptical. She suggested that Ridge return to the office. \"Don't shut me out. Talk to me. What do your remember?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nCaroline answered that she had been walking on the sidewalk one minute, and suddenly she'd heard a really loud noise. She'd tried to get out of the way but hadn't been able to react fast enough. \"Next thing I know, there is a car on top of me. I was pinned, and I couldn't move, and I remember looking at my feet and seeing them but not being able to move them and people trying help me,\" she said tearfully.\n\n\n\"I remember being scared that I'd never walk again,\" Caroline added. Ridge told her he didn't want her to be scared anymore. \"You're going to take your first steps today,\" he said.\n\n\nCaroline appreciated his efforts, but she was unsure. She said she felt she could do nothing for herself -- not even get a cup of coffee, drive a car, or run an errand. She lamented that she had been an independent person before the accident.\n\n\n\"My life was going somewhere,\" she cried. She worried about her career and her relationship with Ridge. She felt stuck. Ridge took in a walker and encouraged her to use it. He helped her up, and he reminded her that she had helped him draw. He'd felt useless \"until you put me back together again. I want to do the same for you,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nRidge helped Caroline stand up with the walker, and she took a few steps. She smiled, and so did Ridge. She wanted to sit down, and she collapsed into his waiting arms on the couch. Ridge hugged her and kissed her. She thanked him. \"I did it,\" she said. \"You did. It was all you,\" Ridge replied.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt tried to persuade Steffy that they could have a great summer together. \"I am your boss,\" Steffy said. Wyatt reminded her they were both young and single. Wyatt refused to feel sorry for himself. Steffy wondered if he was implying that was what she was doing.\n\n\nWyatt noted that Steffy had had hopes of returning to Los Angeles and working with Liam -- and a whole lot more. Wyatt reminded her that Liam was pretty serious with Ivy.\n\n\nWyatt suggested dating, and he noticed Steffy hadn't shot him down. Steffy wondered if he was really serious. They bantered and flirted, and Steffy teased that Wyatt seemed to date \"every new face at Forrester.\" Wyatt responded that he'd deserved that because he had dated Nicole, but he refused to apologize because for a long time he'd mourned his lost relationship with Hope and hadn't done anything. Then he'd started dating.\n\n\nWyatt suggested that Steffy needed to stop mourning her relationship with Liam. He added that they had both lost relationships and babies. \"It's okay to move on and live your life,\" he said. He added that they both had been stuck and needed to stop it and move forward.\n\n\n\"You're too beautiful and too smart to be locked up,\" Wyatt said. He convinced Steffy they were unattached and could have a great summer together. He kissed her, and she seemed to melt. \"But just so you know, I won't play second string to my brother,\" he said.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Ivy and Liam argued about Steffy's continued interest in Liam. Liam maintained that Ivy didn't have to worry, but Ivy knew that Steffy was making a play for Liam every chance she got. \"She won't stop at anything to get you back,\" Ivy said. She worried that she was about to lose everything. Liam tried to console her, but she looked worried.\n\n\nBill showed up, and Liam angrily reminded him that he had almost sided with Rick. Bill explained that he'd planned to take down Rick all along. He had needed to get Rick to take a swing at him so that everyone would see he was unstable. Bill claimed he had taken one for the team.\n\n\nBill asked where Ridge was, and Liam said he'd already left. Bill scoffed. Ivy quickly left for a meeting. Bill noted that Ivy was hot, but Liam had to be tempted by Steffy. Liam shook his head.\n\n\nIn her office, Ivy met with Jake and told him she would do anything to get exposure for the new jewelry line. She asked Jake to tell marketing that she was ready for interviews, appearances, and more. Jake agreed, and he left.\n\n\nA man in a suit knocked on Ivy's office door, and he asked if she was Ivy Forrester. He announced he was from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ivy was surprised.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy asks Wyatt if he is propositioning her since she is his boss. He says just making a suggestion. He feels he should have been in that meeting today. She is not sure what he is suggesting. He says he is serious so what if he is? Ivy tells Liam that Steffy has only been here a short time and already she has kissed him twice. She is not joking; she does not like these odds. She says she does not blame him but she does not trust Steffy. He is committed to Ivy but Steffy may not stop at anything to get him back. Steffy asks if Wyatt hits on all the new faces at Forrester the way he did with Nicole. He says when his marriage ended with Hope he did not want to date anyone, but now it is time and he just wants to have fun. He is through mourning the loss with Hope and it's time for her to do so with Liam. Ivy feels like she needs someone on her side. She does not want to sound ungrateful. She loves coming to America and working at FC and she does not want to lose that. Bill walks in as Ivy and Liam hug and asks if they are working on their assets. He congratulates him on sticking it to Ridge. Bill says he is out of his mind; he would never have sided with Rick. Rick would never screw over the master. Everybody in that room had to believe what he said right up to taking a punch for the team. So they can pile on as if he is not being punished enough already. Now he wants to be talking about what is happening today. Ridge tells Caroline that he talked to her doctor and he feels it might be time to put some weight on her legs. She tells him he should not be here. He needs to be back at the office. He says he misses her there, they are a team and he needs her there. He wants to help her. Caroline tears up and is crying as she explains to Ridge how her accident happened and her wondering if she would ever walk again. He doesn't want her to be scared anymore. He says she is going to take her first steps today. Bill tells Liam that Ivy is a cute girl .smart and intelligent but is he really that committed to her with Steffy back in town. An Immigration officer visits Ivy. Wyatt tells Steffy that he didn't just lose his relationship with Hope. They lost a baby too just like her and Liam. It never goes away. But Steffy is too beautiful and too smart to be locked down because of Liam and she can learn to smile again. Neither one of them should be second choice. They are both unattached and maybe they can have just a little more fun. He kisses her. Then says so just so she knows he will not play second string to his brother. Caroline cries that she can't do anything now. She can not get dressed or get in a car to do anything and that is not her. She does not ask for help. Now she is just stuck here and she is on hold until she can get back on her feet. He says they will make it happen so let him help. He says he picked up some things today to help her. He brings in a walker. He said he was nobody when he tried to draw until she held the pencil and he wants to help her the same way. He urges her to try the walker and helps her onto it. She is shaky and struggles but slowly moves her feet with him holding her around the waist. Then he lets go and smiles as she walks a foot across the floor. She flops on the couch and thanks him as he cradles her legs on his lap. He kisses her and she holds tightly to him.",
