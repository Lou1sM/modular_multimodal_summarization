Steffy felt lucky to have Liam there because it meant she'd be able to have lunch with her brother at Il Giardino. She said it would be the four of them because Thomas had invited Sally. Liam replied that his day had gotten more interesting. Steffy said he was the only one who'd stop her from hurting Sally.\n\n\nLiam asked if Steffy thought Thomas would do well at Spectra. Steffy did. She also believed he could have done well at Forrester; however, he wouldn't get the chance. Steffy said that Thomas had good intentions, but she didn't know how much he could change things at Spectra.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Thomas presented a rack of clothes to Sally and said they were hers if she wanted them. The outfits weren't her usual style, but he wanted her to think of it as marketing. He told her that she was projecting a new image for Spectra and making a statement that she was the executive of Spectra, who had the most talked-about brand in the industry.\n\n\nHanding her one of the demure outfits, Thomas said that if Sally walked into Il Giardino, wearing it, everyone would think she was a force to be reckoned with. Sally asked if she and Thomas were going to lunch. \"With my sister,\" he added.\n\n\nThomas was hoping to improve Sally and Steffy's relationship, but Sally said Rome hadn't been built in a day. Sally took the clothes and said she'd be right back -- unless he wanted her to change there. Thomas replied that they'd never make it to the restaurant.\n\n\nLater, Sally returned in the outfit. She said it was a make-under. Thomas stated that it was still her. Sally was wearing a black and white checkered jacket with a flared skirt and black thigh-highs. Beneath the jacket was a white shirt with a scarf-like piece that draped around her neck. She wondered how \"the Princess\" would react to the outfit. Thomas didn't know, but he asked Sally to skip the tiramisu.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Steffy and Liam sat at a table. When Thomas and Sally arrived, Steffy was standoffish, but she managed to note that Sally had a new look. Sally said she was trying something different and thanked Steffy for noticing. Thomas thanked Liam and Steffy for attending lunch. Steffy said she'd take it if it was the only way she could see her brother, but she'd rather have him back where he belonged at Forrester.\n\n\nLiam chatted with Thomas about how things were going at Spectra. Thomas said it was a lot of work but fun. \"Working at Forrester wasn't?\" Steffy quipped. Thomas said he wasn't comparing the two. Sally felt that Thomas had put a new energy into Spectra. Steffy guessed it was the point and the reason that Sally had lured him into the fold. Sally said Thomas had changed her life, and Steffy replied that Sally had certainly changed his.\n\n\nLiam tried to talk about the menu, to no avail. Sally said she understood why Steffy felt the way she did, but Steffy didn't have to question Sally's feelings for Thomas. Sally was grateful for Thomas and respected him as a person, a designer, and a man. She felt that she and Spectra were lucky to have him.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Ridge and Quinn filled Eric and Wyatt in about the gunshot and Quinn's belief that Katie had done it. Eric was shocked to hear it. Quinn said Katie hated her, and Katie also hadn't taken the firing well. Wyatt asked if Katie had threatened Quinn. Ridge relayed that Katie had pointed a gun at Quinn.\n\n\nEric didn't understand it and said it didn't sound like Katie. Eric decided that he had a few questions for Katie himself. He stood quickly, and Ridge said to take it easy. Eric said he was leaving, and he asked Wyatt and Ridge to watch Quinn. Ridge wanted Eric to let the police handle it, but Eric asserted that his wife had a right to feel safe in that home. Eric planned to find out what was going on, and he strode out the door.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Lieutenant Baker arrived, and Katie said she knew why he was there. \"Oh, you heard the gunshot?\" he asked. She explained that Quinn had told her about it. Katie claimed to be very concerned because she lived nearby and had a child. She asked what would happen if he started shooting at her house next. Baker asked why Katie had said \"he.\"\n\n\nKatie supposed that it could be a woman. She asked if Baker had witnesses or clues. Baker said he had only questions. Katie figured Quinn had accused her, but she said Baker couldn't possibly believe she'd shoot at Quinn. Baker revealed that he knew about her being fired and drawing a gun on Quinn at Forrester.\n\n\nKatie said it had been a stupid impulse, and the gun had been in a nearby chair. Baker explained that the trajectory of the bullet indicated that it had been shot from the direction of Katie's house. He wanted Katie to go to the station with him to answer a few questions and take a few tests. Katie decided that was fine if it was what it took to clear her name.\n\n\nAt the police station, Baker sat behind his desk, and Katie was in the chair in front of it. He noticed that she was fidgety and nervous. He said she hadn't been arrested or charged with a crime, and they were just having a conversation. Katie added that it was just a conversation, even though Quinn had accused of her shooting at Quinn. Baker asked if Quinn was right and if Katie had tried to kill Quinn.\n\n\nIn Katie's silence, Baker said it was a simple question. Katie couldn't believe he thought she'd done it. He replied that she hadn't denied it. She said she didn't think it was something she'd have to deny, and it was ridiculous. Baker asked if she'd mind taking a gunshot residue test. Katie didn't mind and said it was why she was there.\n\n\nThe technician arrived for the testing. Baker said it wouldn't take long. Katie wrung her hands and seemed nervous. Baker asked if she'd changed her clothes. She said she hadn't, and Baker instructed the tech to also swab Katie's sleeves. Katie stated that the test wouldn't show anything. She asserted that she and Quinn didn't like each other, but she hadn't tried to shoot Quinn. Baker decided that he'd let the evidence determine it.\n\n\nLater, Baker and Katie were waiting for the test results when Baker got a call that Eric was there to see them. Baker allowed his staff to send Eric in, and Eric asked to talk to Katie alone. Katie said she had nothing to hide from the lieutenant. Eric started out by saying he admired and respected Katie, \"but the things I've been told...\"\n\n\nKatie readily said they weren't true. Eric asked if she'd pulled a gun on Quinn. Sighing, Katie replied that it had been really stupid, but she'd tried to intimidate Quinn and make her feel the way she made \"us\" feel. Eric asked if Katie had tried to kill his wife. Katie asserted that she hadn't. She said the whole thing was totally insane. Though she didn't like or trust Quinn, Katie declared that she'd never kill anyone. Katie believed someone out there had tried to kill Quinn and wanted Quinn dead, but Katie swore it hadn't been her.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Wyatt didn't know what he was missing about the thing between Quinn and Katie. Quinn said Katie had snapped when Quinn had let her go from work. Wyatt asked if the police thought the shot had originated from Katie's house and asked to see the hole.\n\n\nRidge and Wyatt went out on the balcony. Quinn retrieved binoculars from behind the sofa cushions and went to the patio door. On the threshold, she peered into them and checked out Katie's patio. Beyond the telescope, a dark-haired woman was walking around in Katie's living room. \"Katie, why aren't you at the police station?\" Quinn said to herself.\n\n\nQuinn went to Katie's house and let herself in. She called for Katie and strode over to the terrace doors. When Quinn looked through the telescope, she heard a floorboard creak. Behind her, a woman was walking toward the front door. \"Hey! Who are you?\" Quinn asked.\n\n\nThe woman halted, turned to Quinn, and said, \"Sheila.\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn explains to Eric and Wyatt that she was shot at and she thinks it might have been Katie. Eric is shocked that she would suspect Katie. Ridge says she did pull a gun on her at the office earlier. Lt. Baker goes next door and questions Katie. He says he has no answers yet but he does have questions. She says she is sure Quinn fingered her but surely he does not think that she would shoot at Quinn. She has a young son in the house and is worried that the shooter may pick her house next. Lt. Baker tells her the shot came from her direction and she did pull a gun on Quinn at the office earlier. He would like her to come to headquarters and answer a few more questions.

Thomas tells Sally that he likes her designs. They are new and improved and she is making a statement. Eric is stunned to hear that Katie would even consider pulling a gun on Quinn. He says he has some questions of his own so he'd like to find out from Lt. Baker what is going on. He asks Ridge to stay with Quinn just for a little while. At the station Lt. Baker asks Katie if Quinn is right. Does she have a right to expect that Katie shot at her? She says that is the most ridiculous thing she has ever heard. He calls in the fingerprinting expert to take a few samples. Lt. Baker asks if she has changed her clothes and she answer no. So the technician checks the sleeves of her clothes.

She says that is the only way to see her brother now is to make a date. Ridge leads Wyatt the way to show him where Quinn was standing and from what direction the gunshot came.

But she has so much respect for Thomas as a designer and as a man and she is lucky to have him in her life. Wyatt asks Ridge if Katie really could be the shooter. Lt. Baker gets a call and tells them to let Eric in. Katie is surprised but says she has nothing to hide so whatever he wants to say he can say it in front of Lt. Baker. Eric tells her that he has known her for a long time and he loves and respects her and all of this is a huge surprise. Katie admits she does not like Quinn but she would never do anything like that. She just pulled the gun in the office to scare Quinn like she does to other people. Someone is still out there gunning for Quinn.
