    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's house, Bill chattered on about Liam's love life and the fact that Steffy had returned. Liam was frustrated that Bill wouldn't leave him alone, and Liam maintained he was committed to Ivy. Bill insisted that the opportunity to reconnect with Steffy had to be appealing. \"Steffy excites you in a way no other woman can,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill wondered if Liam would be able to stand by and watch another man make a move on Steffy. Liam looked confused. Liam told Bill it was none of his business. Bill wanted Liam to admit that it was \"scaring the hell\" out of him that Steffy was back, and Liam had another chance with her. Bill wondered if Liam was going to let some other guy sweep Steffy off her feet. Steffy showed up.\n\n\n\"What am I interrupting?\" she asked. \"Well, well, well,\" Bill said. Steffy claimed to be there on official Forrester business. Steffy held up a red lingerie teddy and said she needed their opinions because she wanted to reboot the lingerie line.\n\n\nSteffy held it up against her own body, and Liam and Bill admired it. Liam said nothing, but Bill said it was \"hot as hell.\" Liam insisted that Bill leave, but Bill kept talking about how Liam needed to reconsider what they had discussed. \"Get out,\" Liam shouted.\n\n\nAfter Bill left, Steffy wondered if she had interrupted something important. Liam told her to ignore his dad. She did. She said she wanted to reboot the lingerie line. She had sketched a design and asked one of the Forrester sewers to make a prototype. Steffy asked if Liam needed her to model it before he made a decision. She insisted that she loved it, but she wanted her vice president's opinion. Liam agreed with his dad that it was hot.\n\n\nLiam added that his dad had advised him to get back together with Steffy before someone else swept her off her feet. Steffy said she had hoped to rekindle their romance, but Liam had made it clear that he was committed to Ivy. Steffy added that there was someone else in her life. Liam was speechless.\n\n\nSteffy suggested he make a move quickly because she had met someone who was interested. Liam started quizzing her about who it was. They engaged in a guessing game when Liam realized it was someone from Forrester.\n\n\n\"Charlie,\" asked Liam.\n\n\n\"Too old,\" Steffy replied.\n\n\n\"Carter? asked Liam.\n\n\n\"Too tall,\" Steffy answered.\n\n\n\"Oliver? asked Liam.\n\n\n\"Already taken,\" Steffy lamented.\n\n\nSteffy teased that the mystery man had the same last name as Liam, and he had already kissed her. Liam groaned that it was Wyatt. \"You kissed my brother?\" Liam asked. Steffy said that she and Wyatt had a lot in common. She noted that Liam seemed jealous -- odd for someone so committed to Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy said she was moving on. She was unconvinced that Ivy was the one Liam truly wanted, but she was tired of pining over him. \"I can't keep doing this, Liam,\" Steffy said.\n\n\n\"Something tells me you're not being honest with yourself,\" Steffy added. \"If you want me, I need to know. Now. Show me, Liam.\" Steffy caressed his face, and Liam looked uncomfortable.\n\n\nIn Wyatt's office, Quinn showed up and said she was there to see Ivy. She worried about Wyatt and his love life. He said it was fine. Quinn had worried about Hope, but Wyatt said they were as good as divorced. He lamented that he had blown it with Nicole, but he was glad he had dated again. \"I'm looking in another direction,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to know who the new woman in Wyatt's life was. He shared that it was Steffy, and Quinn gasped. He added that they had a lot in common, and it was time they both found some happiness and excitement. Quinn was elated. \"I just want my baby to have what I have,\" she said.\n\n\nQuinn worried about Steffy's history with Liam, but Wyatt was convinced that Liam was content with Ivy. Later, Quinn had gone, and Wyatt flashed back to his conversation with Steffy. He recalled noting that they were both unattached and that she would have a lot of fun with him. He remembered the kiss he had shared with Steffy. Wyatt smiled.\n\n\nIn an office at Forrester, Agent McAffrey explained to Ivy that she was illegally in the United States. Ivy explained that she had dual citizenship because her dad was American and her mother was Australian. McAffrey said that Ivy had never filed the proper paperwork.\n\n\n\"My dad always told me I'm a citizen of this country,\" she said. McAffrey pointed out that there were specific procedures she should have followed. He added that she was breaking the law by being in the United States.\n\n\nMcAffrey warned that he could have her deported immediately, and she would never be allowed to return to the U.S., but he would allow her to get a ticket and make plans to leave the country. He wanted to see the ticket, or he would return with a court order. \"You'll be leaving the country either way,\" he said. Ivy said she would contact a lawyer, and the agent told her she could contact anyone she wanted, but the result would be the same. He left.\n\n\nIvy immediately met with Carter. Ivy told him about the immigration office's case against her. She gave Carter the papers the immigration agent had delivered. \"You're being deported?\" Carter asked.\n\n\nCater asked about her dad, but she said he had no cell service where he was at that time. Ivy was crushed that she might have to leave her job and her boyfriend. \"How is this happening?\" Ivy asked. Carter admitted that he had no expertise in immigration law. He worried that the papers appeared to be in order, and Ivy needed to talk to her dad. Carter left.\n\n\nLater, Quinn entered and greeted Ivy. Quinn wondered why Ivy was so distraught, but Ivy said she didn't want to discuss it. Quinn said they had to discuss their jewelry designs because Ridge wanted to see them as soon as possible. Ivy argued that she couldn't deal with it. Quinn looked at Ivy's desk and picked up a stack of papers. \"You're being deported?\" Quinn asked.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill follows Liam into his cliff house, still dogging him about selecting and still saying he is committed to Ivy when Steffy is back. Bill reminds him that she still loves him. Liam gives him lip service of course and tells him to drop this. Bill tells him that he can't as Liam may have waited too late already and let someone else snag Steffy as they speak. Steffy is surprised that Wyatt says he will not play second fiddle to his brother and then he kisses her. He says they both spend too much time looking back instead of what is right in front of them. And Ivy is not going anywhere. Ivy is visited by an Immigration officer who basically tells her she only has an Australian passport and not American so she is in the states illegally. Her dad had been wrong when she wrote down dual citizenship. She thinks it is as simple as making it right but the man says it won't be that easy now after the fact. Every day she works here she is breaking the law. She will have to return to Australia to fill out the proper papers and even then she may not return to the states. He tells her to book a flight and send him proof that she is leaving the country or he will be back with a court order. She calls Carter who rushes to her and can not believe she is being deported. Ivy is worried this will mean the end of her and Liam. Quinn finds Wyatt working at his desk and she is all giddy and declares love can do that to her. She wants to see Ivy as they are design partners and despite past differences Quinn thinks Ivy has let that go and they are okay. Wyatt admits that love can do that for you, even he has let Hope go for all intents and purposes they are divorced. Quinn picks up on the hint there might be another woman on the horizon for Wyatt and begins to question him. Good naturedly Wyatt tells her she is an overly inquisitive mother and he prefers to keep his private life private. She knows it is not Hope nor Nicole and is excited when Wyatt turns around a picture on the desk of Steffy. He explains they are both ready to move on and find happiness. Quinn finds Ivy in a down mood and picks up the papers saying she will be deported. Steffy walks into Liam's house and senses tension but tells Bill and Liam this is official FC business. She takes out a sexy red lacy teddy and holds it up to herself and says she is thinking of rebooting the lingerie line .do they need to see it on? Liam screams for Bill to leave. Liam tells her that he thought she was going to have sketches first. She doesn't want to waste time and asks if it is too risque. He says no, for once he agrees with Bill. It is hot as hell. They end up on the subject that Bill still thinks Steffy is the right woman for him ..except for Ivy is in the way now. But if Liam doesn't make his move, someone else might. Steffy states that it is not Carter or Charlie but someone with Liam's same last name. He blows a gasket when he realizes it is his brother, Wyatt ..anybody but Wyatt! She explains that Wyatt kissed her. Liam hopes she slapped his face and walked away. Steffy tells Liam that she put her feelings out there more than once and was told every time that Liam was committed to Ivy so she is simply moving on. She did not get over him in Paris. She kept thinking he'd get over Ivy but he might not be honest with himself. If Liam wants her he needs to show her now.",
