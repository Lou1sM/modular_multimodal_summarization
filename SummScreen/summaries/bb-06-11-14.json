    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester cabin at Big Bear, Wyatt waited for an answer to his marriage proposal. \"Be my wife,\" he said, and he held Hope's hand and the engagement ring. She was speechless. Wyatt said he had always known the proposal would happen, and he reminded her it had all started outside the cabin. Hope laughed.\n\n\nWyatt promised that they could have it all -- marriage and a family. He wondered if she didn't like the ring. He joked that he could get her a new one. Hope giggled, and they joked about his good taste in jewelry.\n\n\n\"At least I have that going for me,\" Wyatt said. Hope said he had way more than that going for him. \"Is that a yes?\" Wyatt asked. Hope hesitated, and her phone rang. It was Brooke. \n\n\nHope and Brooke discussed that there was still no news on Ridge. Brooke said that it had all been Quinn's fault. Brooke would never forgive Quinn. Brooke promised to call Hope again after she and Bill met with the search team leader. She hung up.\n\n\nWyatt asked about Ridge, and Hope answered that Brooke hated Quinn and blamed Quinn for everything. \"But once Ridge is found,\" Wyatt said hopefully. Hope advised that Brooke would never forgive Quinn. Wyatt maintained that he was nothing like his mother. \n\n\nHope understood, but she said that she felt responsible for letting Quinn into the company. Hope blamed Quinn for sending Ridge to Abu Dhabi. \"Ridge is gone, and this is the man who stepped up to be my father when my own dad wanted nothing to do with me,\" Hope said.\n\n\nWyatt grabbed Hope's hands, but she pulled them away. \"It might be best if you and Quinn were both gone by the time my mom gets back,\" Hope advised. Wyatt begged Hope to reconsider. He refused to be the \"bad boy affair\" she'd had.\n\n\nHope admitted that they'd had fun and that he drew out a sexy side of her, \"but that's not who I am,\" she said. Wyatt argued that Hope had a powerful and sexy side, but she wanted to hide behind her sweet and innocent image. Hope said she wanted to be true to herself. \n\n\nWyatt wanted to go back and start over. Wyatt kissed Hope, and she pulled away. She advised Wyatt that she had made her decision. She left. Wyatt called her name, but Hope did not return. Wyatt blew out the candles he'd lit, and he remembered happier times with Hope in Hawaii and on road trips they had taken in the recreational vehicle. He looked lost.\n\n\nIn Oliver's office, Aly said she was stronger than ever before because of Oliver. His support had made all the difference. \"It's all you, Miss F. You've grown up,\" Oliver said. Oliver kissed Aly, and Maya peeked in from the doorway. Aly said that Liam needed to know about Quinn. Aly wanted Liam to make a move so that Hope would dump Wyatt.\n\n\nOliver called Aly a cute little matchmaker, and he kissed her before she left. Maya stormed in and warned Oliver to leave Aly alone. Oliver claimed that he really liked Aly. \"No, you're taking advantage, and we both know it,\" Maya said. She advised Oliver to back off. Oliver said he cared about Aly, and he refused to back off.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Quinn advised Liam that he was being cocky, and things would change by the end of the night because Wyatt had prepared a romantic evening for Hope. Liam reminded Quinn that everyone at Forrester hated her. Quinn insisted that Ridge wasn't dead, and even if he was, it wasn't her fault. She proclaimed her innocence because she had not forced Ridge to go to Abu Dhabi, and she had not piloted the helicopter or knocked him out of the helicopter.\n\n\nQuinn claimed the Forresters were all idiots because they had blamed her. She refused to allow everyone to make Wyatt suffer the consequences. Liam told her it was too late. \"This is the one that is gonna finally get you,\" Liam said. Quinn left, and Aly arrived at Liam's.\n\n\nLiam and Aly discussed that Hope had finally seen the light and planned to dump Wyatt. Liam asked how Aly was coping with the search for Ridge. Liam asked about Thorne, and Aly replied that Thorne was on his way to Abu Dhabi to help in the search for Ridge. Liam and Aly agreed that Ridge had to be alive. Aly left.\n\n\nLater, Hope entered, and she hugged Liam. \"I told him. It was painful,\" Hope said. Liam sympathized, and Hope explained that Wyatt had proposed at Big Bear. \"I turned him down, obviously,\" Hope said. She explained that she had a sense of relief to know that she was home where she belonged. She thanked Liam for his patience, and she looked relieved.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Caroline, Rick, Pam, and Charlie were in Rick's office, and Carter returned. They discussed that no one would want to work with Quinn. Rick told Carter to draw up documents to fire Quinn and Wyatt. Suddenly, Quinn entered and asked who they were talking about.\n\n\nRick advised that Quinn would not be at Forrester for long. Quinn fired back that he would have trouble with a legal case based on a selfie. Quinn arrogantly said that she'd handled juries well in the past, and Rick didn't stand a chance. Carter promised to draw up the papers immediately.\n\n\nQuinn's phone rang, and it was Brooke. Quinn feigned that she was sorry and had meant to call Brooke. Quinn said that it was unbelievable that Ridge had become so upset about a private moment between Bill and Quinn. \n\n\nBrooke was in disbelief that Quinn blamed Ridge for what had happened. Brooke was furious and blamed Quinn for everything. Brooke warned that she would never lose Ridge because of what Quinn had done. Brooke hung up.\n\n\nRick asked what Brooke had said. Quinn looked slightly shaken, but she said that Brooke had lashed out at the wrong person because she was emotionally distraught. Quinn was sure Brooke would get over it. Rick disagreed. \"We're taking out the trash. I want you and Wyatt gone -- as far away from Forrester as is humanly possible,\" Rick said. Quinn defiantly smiled at Rick. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt holds the ring up for Hope and asks her to marry him. She shakes her head and says she does not know what to say. He says yes will work. He gets down on his knees and says just be his wife. He's known for a long time since they met that this moment was going to come. She says the ring is really lovely ..he says at least he has good taste in jewelry. She says he has a lot more than that going for him. Quinn tells Liam just look at him, he looks so cocky and confident that just a little bit of him reminds her of his father. And that is a good thing as women love confidence and that will help him further down the line when he is looking for someone new. Liam smiles and says well Hope has told him to his face that she wants to be with him. Quinn says things change so let's see how it looks after she has spent a romantic evening with Wyatt. Liam says Hope is breaking up with him but maybe Quinn finds that romantic. She says she is not going to take the blame even if Ridge is dead and they are all idiots to even suggest it. If Ridge is dead, it's his own damn fault. And so ridiculous that she has to defend herself and more so that Wyatt has to suffer any consequences. He says she has done a lot of dirty things but this one is finally going to get her son out of their lives. Maya snoops and sees Ollie kissing Aly. She tells him that she wants to freak out because of Ridge but she's not and that is all due to Ollie and how much he has helped her with her problems. But she thinks she needs to go tell Liam to make his move now since Quinn's interference will affect Wyatt too. Ollie calls her a cute matchmaker. She says they do not need a matchmaker but Hope does need to come to her senses. As soon as she leaves Maya marches in and slams the door. Ollie gets her to spill what is wrong. She tells him that they both know that he is taking advantage of Aly so stop using that poor girl. Ollie says it is not what she thinks; he really likes Aly. He says he is not going to argue with her about this. Aly has had a tough time and now with Ridge, so he is not backing off. He says their feelings have grown and he deeply cares about Aly. Rick calls Carter in to draw up some documents. It might be premature but he's all but certain they will be firing Quinn. Caroline says maybe Quinn will just quit since everybody there hates her now. Charlie says he thinks Miss Permafrost enjoys that sort of environment. Quinn walks in and asks what they are all talking about. Wyatt says his knees are hurting and Hope tells him to get up. He says he really wants an answer first. But the phone rings and Hope has to get it. It's her mother. Brooke tells her there is no news but she warns her about Quinn's involvement. She says Quinn better pray that Ridge is alive or Brooke does not know what she will do. Hope says Ridge is alive. They have to keep believing that. Hope tells Wyatt that her mom blames his mother; she absolutely hates her. Wyatt is concerned but says Ridge could still be alive. Aly finds Liam alone and he said she just missed Quinn; she's in full panic mode because of Ridge and how this might affect Wyatt. She notices his face and realizes Wyatt did that to him. Liam says it is okay, one of the reasons that Hope is with Wyatt now ending it between the two of them. Hope tells Wyatt they have had a beautiful story until now but she feels like there is more. It might also have gotten Ridge killed. She hired Quinn and let her into the company and now Ridge is gone. And this is the man that stepped up and became her dad when her own dad wanted nothing to do with her. He takes her hand to explain but she pulls away. She tells him she thinks it might be best if he and Quinn were gone by time her mom gets back. Quinn says this little pow wow must not be too important otherwise Pam would be passing out her lemon bars. Pam says actually she is going to make a big batch as soon as she gets home. They do have a lot to celebrate. Quinn thinks that means Ridge is alive. Rick says no but Quinn is still gone. She says if it is because of the selfie she does not think he has a leg to stand on. But go ahead, he will be spending a lot of money on court fees. And she warns him that she is pretty good with the jury. Her phone rings and it is Brooke. Quinn says that she hopes Brooke is not too mad at Ridge for sharing a private moment between her and Bill. Brooke is appalled that Quinn is blaming Ridge for all of this. She says this was all Quinn's fault; she sent him here and she is not losing Ridge because of Quinn. Wyatt repeats what Hope said \u0096 she wants them out of FC. She says Quinn has crossed too many lines so using her jewelry now seems almost impossible. Wyatt says they can send Quinn back to the warehouse and he can be Hope's contact. She says that is not going to be the answer. They have to be done. She just lost track of HFTF. Her line stands for honesty and decency and she is sorry but his mother does not have a decent bone in her body. He counters with Quinn's integrity but that is not his. He knows Hope is struggling with the mistakes Wyatt has made but she has to admit he is different from his mother. She acknowledges that. She says she is very proud of Wyatt to come from a mother like that with his only influence. It makes her excited to see what he is going to do and what he can become and can accomplish. He says yes and with a gorgeous wife at his side. She says yes and maybe one day she will meet her. Before he can say more she tells him that she made a decision. She is going back to Liam. They have had a really amazing journey but this is where it ends. He asks if this is the bad boy affair in her life. She admits that he brings out something different than Liam. It's powerful and sexy but that is now who she is. He says she's wrong. That is who she is now and there is nothing wrong with that. She says maybe that is not who she wants to be. He gets it, she wants to be the sweet, innocent Hope for the rest of her life. She stepped out of her comfort zone and had fun with him. She had her freedom finally and she can not just go back. He starts to kiss her but their lips barely touch when she pulls away. She grabs her purse and leaves even with him calling after her. Quinn tells the group that Brooke has some misplaced doubts but she won't hold that against her. Ridge will be found and back here before they know it. Rick says but Quinn won't. He wants her and Wyatt to be as far away with their costume jewelry as they can be. FC was fine without them and they will be again. They are taking out the trash. Slowly Wyatt blows out the candles and sits and reflects on Hope's beauty wearing the diamond, their time in Hawaii, on a HOTT road trip to Emerald Bay and making love in the tent on the beach. Liam is waiting and is relieved when she walks into his arms. She says she told Wyatt and it was painful as he even proposed. Obviously she turned him down and she even felt relieved on the way home that she was coming home now to where she belonged to the man she is supposed to be with .no doubts in her mind, none at all. She thanks him for not losing faith in her when she lost track of that. She thinks she just needed to step away so she could see themselves clearly. She says she loves him and they kiss with her clinging to him.",
