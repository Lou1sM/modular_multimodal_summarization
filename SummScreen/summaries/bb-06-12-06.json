After the models leave, Ridge questions the sincerity of Dante's proposal to Felicia since just days before he wanted to marry Bridget.  Ridge is afraid Dante is just marrying Felicia because of Dominick and he wants to make sure Felicia is not being misled. Dante admits that his proposal to Felicia is impulsive but he assures Ridge that he wants to have a life with Felicia and his son.  Ridge is skeptical and warns Dante that if he makes this commitment to Felicia he had better honor it.\n\n\nAt Marone, Brooke talks with Bridget while she is moving into her new office.  She tells her daughter that she knows Stephen meant well by getting her the extra 2% of Forrester.  However, for Brooke it was too little too late and her father's interference only brought back painful childhood memories for her of how he abandoned her when she needed him most.  Brooke tells Bridget that she told Stephen to leave LA. Bridget thinks her mother is being harsh, but Brooke argues that she cannot trust her father and she does not want him anywhere around her. When Bridget attempts to defend him, Brooke informs her that Stephen slept with Taylor in order to get revenge on the Forresters.  Bridget cannot believe that Stephen would sink so low. Brooke tells her that Stephen claimed to have some kind of connection with Taylor, but Brooke does not buy it. Brooke adds that she cannot believe Nick and Stephen expected her to fire Stephanie, Eric and Ridge once she gained control of the company.  Bridget agrees that firing them would be ridiculous, but she does understand why Nick does not trust Ridge to be working with her mother.  Brooke says she is compromising with Nick by having her office in Marone.  Bridget thinks Brooke is underestimating her feelings for Ridge.  She warns her mother that she is encouraging Ridge, by going against what Nick wants her to do. Bridget also thinks re-launching Brooke's Bedroom Line is a bad idea.  As usual, Brooke ignores her daughter's concerns.  Bridget notices Brooke's new engagement ring and congratulates her.  She tells her mother that Dante and Felicia are getting married too.  Brooke is confused.  Bridget explains that after she refused Dante's proposal he decided to propose to Felicia.  Bridget thinks she made a mistake by refusing to marry Dante.  She tells her mother she did not appreciate what she had with Dante until she lost it.  Brooke does not think it is too late and reminds her daughter that Dante loves her, not Felicia.  Brooke encourages Bridget to tell Dante how she feels before it is too late. After Bridget leaves Ridge drops by bringing samples of The Bedroom Line, Brooke scolds him for coming to Marone.  Ridge playfully holds up a pair of panties and tells her they have work to do.  Brooke refuses to discuss panties with him.  Ridge tells her to try them on instead.  Ignoring her exasperation, Ridge places the lingerie out on the table and makes her look at it.  She admits that he has not lost his touch and he tells her she is his muse.  He then shows her the teddy showstopper that he wants her to model at the fashion show. Ever the professional, Brooke generously agrees to wear it for the good of the company.  Ridge begins to get touch feely with her until he notices her engagement ring.  He cannot believe that she is going to marry Nick.  Brooke does not want to discuss it with him.  Ridge begs her to follow her heart one more time and come back to him.  He promises he will never let her down again. \n\n\nMeanwhile at Jackie's, Stephen drops by and tells her they need to talk.  Before he gets the chance to confess, Jackie calls him out about his romp with Taylor.  Surprised to find out that she already knows about it Stephen begins to stammer.  At first, Jackie is annoyed and does not make it easy for him.  Jackie assumes that he slept with Taylor in order to get her to sign over the 2% stock.  Stephen informs her that they did not have sex until after she signed the stock over.  Jackie is oddly turned on by his rakish behavior.  She tells him sleeping with Taylor was very James Bond of him and admits she finds that alluring.  Bloating his ego further, Jackie goes on to tell him that he is a dangerously complicated man but she cannot fight her attraction toward him.  Genuinely surprised by her reaction, Stephen tells her that she might be more dangerously complicated than him. \n\n\nAt the Beach House, fearing she has lost the only man who truly loved her, a lonely Bridget paces back and forth wistfully remembering the special times she shared with Dante.
