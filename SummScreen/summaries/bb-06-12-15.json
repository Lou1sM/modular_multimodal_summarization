Ivy relayed that she'd been hiding and listening to Liam talk about breaking up with her. Quinn said Liam's superpower was saying what only sounded like what a person wanted to hear.\n\n\nQuinn believed Liam was Ivy's to lose, but Ivy didn't think she had control. Quinn suggested that Ivy would if Ivy asked Liam to marry her. Ivy refused to marry Liam for a green card. Quinn stated that Liam loved a damsel in distress, and if he'd jump into a dirty river for Ivy, he'd jump into a wedding ring.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Steffy asked if she got to sign checks. Carter wondered if she knew how many checks they cut, and she asked how else she was supposed to express her presidential powerfulness. Carter gave her a list of her contractual powers, and she asked if she could sign the vice president's underwear. Chuckling, Carter said it hadn't been that fun around Forrester in a while.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Wyatt dumped keys on the table. He said he'd knocked, but Liam had ignored it. Liam asked what Wyatt was doing kissing Steffy. Guessing they'd skip the small talk, Wyatt asked if Liam was or wasn't done with Steffy. Liam said he'd never be done with Steffy, and Wyatt asked what that even meant. Wyatt likened Liam to a dog trying to hold too many tennis balls in his mouth.\n\n\nLiam accused Wyatt of lashing out by liplocking with females that had connections to Liam. Wyatt protested that he'd never put the moves on Ivy, but Liam was being possessive over a woman who was not the woman that he claimed to be in love with.\n\n\nUpset, Liam said Steffy made her own decisions, and his opinion of it didn't matter. Wyatt told Liam that Liam had consistently said he wasn't available and was with Ivy. \"Life is change,\" Liam uttered. Liam said one never knew, and Ivy could return to Australia the next day.\n\n\nWyatt asserted that it would never happen. Liam hugged Wyatt, and Wyatt asked what Liam was doing. Liam asked if he couldn't hug his brother. He advised Wyatt to be really careful. He felt that Wyatt was raw and not good at hiding it. Liam said it would take time, but there would be someone else for him. Wyatt thanked Liam for the reminder that Liam wasn't the good guy everyone thought he was.\n\n\nLater, Ivy arrived, and Liam welcomed her home. Ivy wished it was her home. Liam asked how Ivy's day had been, and after they talked a bit, Liam admitted that Steffy had been there. He wanted Ivy to unwind before they discussed it, but she said she wouldn't relax while waiting to talk about Steffy.\n\n\nLiam told Ivy that he'd been careless emotionally in past relationships and had failed about being open and honest. He didn't want to do that with her. Ivy asked if he was breaking up with her. He said he wasn't, but there was something. He didn't know how to put the feeling into words, but Steffy was reminding him of how good he and Steffy had been together.\n\n\nLiam believed he'd been able to resist Steffy because he'd walled off his feelings, but it was difficult to hold them off like he'd once done. Ivy leapt from her seat. Liam said he wasn't going anywhere; he just didn't want to keep things from her. Ivy loved and respected him for it, and she wasn't surprised by his words. He asked her to say whatever she needed to say.\n\n\n\"I'm getting deported,\" Ivy replied. Upset, Liam asked Ivy several questions about what was happening, and she explained her mistaken dual citizenship problem. Liam asked why the immigration officers had even gone looking for her. Ivy guessed her work visa had expired. Liam didn't understand why she'd gotten a visa if she was an American citizen.\n\n\n\"My company in Australia is not a citizen, so I spoke to the consultant,\" Ivy replied. She claimed they had told her to apply for the visa, so she'd done it. Liam wanted to know if she'd talked to John or Eric. Ivy hadn't. Liam cried out that she was a Forrester and should use her resources.\n\n\nIvy complained that she wouldn't be able to get the papers before she was required to be back in Australia. She doubted she'd get another visa because she was breaking the law by being in America at that moment. Liam wanted to get a lawyer, but Ivy said Carter had already advised her to comply. Liam said that there had to be a way to undo it. Taking a cup of wine, Ivy stated that there might be.\n\n\nLiam asked for the options. Ivy stressed that she couldn't complete the procedures in the United States, and she still might not get the visa if she submitted the papers and waited in Australia. Ivy didn't want to lose all she'd accomplished, her friends, family, or the love of her life. She liked to play but the rules, but doing so was a real gamble in that instance.\n\n\nLiam asked what other option there was. Ivy said she hadn't wanted to make a decision that way, and she and Liam were still a year off from a decision, even without Steffy's reappearance. Liam didn't want to include Steffy in the conversation. Ivy asked why not if Steffy could be one of a dozen reasons that they ultimately broke up. Ivy said that she and Liam should be able to choose their future, and they could do it \"if we get married now.\"\n\n\nBack at Forrester, Steffy entered the CEO's office, and Quinn touted Wyatt's virtues. Steffy said she got it; Wyatt was a good guy. While discussing jewelry, Quinn showed Steffy a ring Wyatt had given Quinn. Steffy asked if Quinn's son seriously bought her jewelry. Quinn claimed he was generous, and he'd actually made it for her.\n\n\nWyatt entered and said he hadn't made it. Quinn pretended to remember that he hadn't made it. Wyatt stated that he'd declared his intentions to explore a relationship with Steffy. Steffy assumed he'd had a man-to-man with her father. \"Liam,\" Wyatt corrected. Quinn felt it was good for Wyatt, but Steffy snipped that it had been out of line, and Wyatt didn't talk to other people about her. Steffy told him that if he wanted to discuss what she wanted and who she wanted, \"You talk to me.\"\n\n\nSteffy slammed down a folder. Quinn said Liam had probably taken it as a courtesy, as he was so committed to Ivy. Wyatt claimed he'd done what he'd done for himself because his brother had a history of accusing him of being underhanded. He asserted that Liam couldn't say it \"this time.\"\n\n\nSteffy asked how Liam had reacted. Wyatt said Liam hadn't indicated anything one way or another in regard to Steffy. Quinn interjected that there could be wedding bells in Ivy and Liam's future.\n\n\nLater, Steffy closed the office door and turned to explain why she'd thrown Quinn out. Wyatt said no one ever needed to explain doing that. Steffy told him to never bargain for her like she was a used car. She claimed that, since the seventh grade, she hadn't been giddy over guys competing for her. Wyatt was fine with it -- even though it hadn't been about her -- and doubted Liam would have her back. \n\n\nSteffy asked why Wyatt thought that. He said it was for a reason that Liam had expressed and for one he hadn't. Steffy guessed Ivy was the reason Liam had expressed and asked for the other reason. \"The way you hurt him,\" Wyatt stated. Steffy asked if Liam had said it. Wyatt said Liam hadn't, but Wyat knew it because Hope had hurt Wyatt the same way.\n\n\nBack in Rick's old office, Quinn thanked Carter for rushing to meet her. Carter asked if she'd stabbed or assaulted anyone. She said she hadn't, and he complained that she'd said it was an emergency. Quinn clarified that I wasn't her emergency -- it was Ivy's.\n\n\nCarter stressed that one didn't mess around with Immigration. Quinn said she needed Ivy there because they were coworkers. Carter looked suspiciously at Quinn, who expressed sadness for Liam and Ivy as a couple. Carter admitted that there was a legal option. Quinn quickly added that it was marriage. She asked if Carter could marry Liam and Ivy that day -- if the couple decided to do it.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy tells Quinn don't. Whatever she is thinking do not do it. She has to face the facts that she is being deported. She does tell her that she slipped into Liam's house and overheard him and Steffy and she is still in love with him and wants him. Quinn tells her that Liam is hers to lose but she can do something about it. She can ask him to marry her. Quinn says it would solve her problems to get a green card. And Liam is just confused. He does not want Steffy. Wyatt walks on in at Liam's and said he knocked but Liam ignored him. Liam hammers at Wyatt that he kissed Steffy. Wyatt asks if he is done with her. He's like a Golden Retriever with too many tennis balls in his mouth and so possessive of an ex-wife when he has moved on with Ivy. Give Steffy a chance to move on too. He says Liam has said repeatedly that he is committed to Ivy and she is not moving back to Australia. Liam suddenly hugs Wyatt and tells him that it will take time but there will be someone else for Wyatt. Wyatt stands back but says Liam is not transparent and certainly not as good a guy as everyone things he is. Quinn gives Steffy some papers and says she is going over to see Ivy. Then she sings Wyatt's praises. Ivy goes to see Liam and he welcomes her home. She says she wishes it were. She declines wine saying if she starts she might not stop. And it is not Quinn this time. He tells her it is not a big deal but he has something to tell her about Steffy who was here earlier. He starts with that he has been careless with his emotions although he has tried to be honest. She jumps to the conclusion that he might be trying to break up with her. He assures her no, but Steffy keeps reminding him how good they are together and he keeps trying to forget it. But he is having a hard time holding them off like he used to. But he is not making any big announcements and he is not going anywhere. She tells him straight out that she is being deported. Wyatt breaks up the meeting with Steffy and Quinn. Steffy chastises him for talking about her to Liam. Out of curiosity she asks Wyatt what Liam said. Quinn jumps in and says she sees wedding bells in their very near future for Liam and Ivy. Ivy explains this is all true as an Immigration officer found her and explained she does not have dual citizenship and her work visa has expired. She was told to do that. She follows the rules and acted accordingly. Now she has to be in Australia within a week or she is breaking the rules. He tells her they will find a way; there has to be a way. She pours herself a drink after all and says there might be. Steffy throws Quinn out and Wyatt says she does not have to explain. Steffy says he had no right to talk about her. Wyatt said Liam was just being coy today. He and Ivy are inseparable. And he knows Steffy hurt him. Quinn tells Carter that she has an emergency. She did not hurt anybody this time, but Ivy needs to be here and can not go back to Australia. She and Liam belong together and they need to get married if he can marry them today. Ivy tells Liam that she can not tackle one immigration page at a time. There will not be time. He asks her what did she mean by a solution. She tells him her job is here, her family is here and the love of her life is here. She plays by the rules but that is not working. She wants them to be in charge of their future, not because of Steffy. They can do that by getting married now.",
