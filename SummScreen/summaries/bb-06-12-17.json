    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Il Giardino, Sally told Steffy that the old Sally had cost Forrester a fortune. The new Sally was learning from her mistakes and refused to make the same ones again. Steffy murmured that it was a nice speech -- if it was true. Sally stated that it wasn't a speech. Sally was determined not to make mistakes with Thomas because he meant too much to her. \"To you and to Spectra Fashions,\" Steffy added. Liam suggested they switch to a safer topic, like politics.\n\n\nThomas couldn't let Steffy's accusations go unanswered. Steffy said she hadn't been making accusations. He replied that she was implying that Sally was using him, but Steffy was wrong. He said he'd decided to invest in Spectra and design for them on his own. He was excited and having better ideas than ever because of it, because of Sally. Sally added that he was taking Spectra places that she'd never dreamed it would go.\n\n\nSteffy stated that Sally had just made Steffy's point, which was that Sally needed Thomas to keep the business afloat. Steffy felt that the jury was still out on whether there was more to it for Sally. Liam was ready to get the check, but Thomas said that Steffy might want some tiramisu.\n\n\nLiam joked about getting together again at some point and suggested barbequing at the cliff house. Steffy said they'd made it through a meal, but her guard was still up. She claimed it was up on Thomas' behalf.\n\n\nThomas appreciated Steffy's protectiveness, and he appreciated that she and Liam had accepted the lunch date. Going to Spectra instead of Forrester after lunch would be weird for him, but Thomas was carving out a new life for himself. To him, he'd not only made an investment in Spectra but also one in \"this woman right here.\"\n\n\nAt Forrester later, Liam expressed that he was proud of Steffy for the way she'd handled lunch. Steffy said she'd put her game face on and had gotten through it. Liam believed that Sally wanted to be better, and Thomas' faith in Sally was behind it. Steffy hoped her husband was right, but Steffy didn't think Spectras were capable of change.\n\n\nLiam claimed Steffy knew what loving a person could do for them. Steffy replied that she knew what loving Liam had done for her. Steffy had never been so happy. Liam stated that Thomas felt the same about Sally, and Liam asked if it meant Sally and Thomas had a good thing.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Thomas thought the lunch had gone well. He appreciated the things Sally had said about him. Sally said she'd meant the things, and she really loved him. \"I really do, too,\" Thomas replied, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Thomas wanted to show Sally something on a sketchpad. He asked that she keep an open mind. \"It is the new, improved Spectra logo,\" He said, showing the name of the business sketched in what appeared to be a variation of the Obitron font with parts of letters missing. The \"E\" in the name consisted of three horizontal bars -- the top one blue, the middle one pink, and the bottom one black like the rest of the word. Sally asked if he'd designed it.\n\n\nThomas said he had. It represented his new vision for the business. He said they were innovative with a slightly edgy, quirky take on fashion. He believed that at that same time the next year, they'd be the comeback story of all comeback stories, and they would do it together. He asked if she was with him. Sally replied that she was with him in every way.\n\n\nAt the police station, the mood was tense as Katie became upset about having to defend herself to Eric, who she claimed had known her for her whole life. Eric was frightened for Quinn and wanted to get to the bottom of it. Katie wanted to solve it, too, but she said she wasn't violent, no matter how angry she got. She asserted that someone else had pulled the trigger.\n\n\nUpset, Eric didn't like how things looked. He believed he'd made a mistake and should have fired Katie himself, \"but for you to pull a gun on Quinn?\" Katie said that it had been stupid. She regretted taking it so far, but she insisted that it was insane to think she'd actually commit such a crime. Insisting that a very dangerous person was still out there, Katie said the police were wasting time with questioning her instead of finding who'd really done it.\n\n\nEric understood the police's need to follow every lead, but he believed Katie hadn't done it. A technician entered with the gunshot residue report. The police had been unable to find gunshot residue on the spots they tested on Katie. Katie said she'd never keep a gun in the house or fire one. Lieutenant Baker suggested that Eric hire extra security until it was solved.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Quinn asked if Sheila was Will's sitter. \"Will?\" Sheila asked. Quinn elaborated that he was Katie's son. Chuckling, Sheila said she'd once been a nanny, but it had been a while back. Sheila was sure Quinn thought it was odd to find a stranger in Katie's house, but Sheila said she was an old family friend of the Logans.\n\n\nSheila stated that she didn't have to ask who she was talking to. She already knew that she was talking to Quinn Fuller, the woman lucky enough to be married to Eric Forrester. Quinn wondered how Sheila knew Eric, and Sheila asked who didn't know the legendary Eric Forrester. Sheila asked if she could tell Katie that Quinn had stopped by.\n\n\nShrugging, Quinn said it didn't matter to her what Sheila told Katie. Sheila gleaned that the two women didn't get along. Quinn stated that it was a long story, and she decided to leave. \"Well, perhaps I'll get another shot,\" Sheila replied. Startled, Quinn asked what Sheila meant.\n\n\n\"To get to know you better,\" Sheila said. \"Or not...\" she added. In the awkward silence, Quinn exited. Sheila paced around after Quinn had gone. By the terrace, Sheila peered into the telescope and saw that it was pointed at Eric's balcony.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Eric arrived home and was upset that Wyatt and Ridge had left Quinn alone there. Quinn assured Eric that she was fine and asked for an update about the investigation. Eric let Quinn know the results of the gunshot residue test, which he said meant Katie hadn't fired a gun. The information didn't put Quinn's mind at ease.\n\n\nRetrieving her binoculars from the table near the balcony door, Quinn told Eric that she'd been using them to look into Katie's house. When she'd seen someone in there, she'd assumed Katie had been hiding from the police. Quinn relayed that she'd decided to go over there, and she'd seen a woman there who'd claimed to be a friend of the Logans.\n\n\nEric made martinis for him and Quinn. Quinn said she'd really thought the shooter had been Katie. Eric had had a hard time believing it could be Katie, in spite of the earlier gun incident. He wondered if he should check on Katie, but Quinn replied that Katie's friend, Sheila, was with Katie. Eric froze with his glass almost to his lips. \"What?\" he asked.\n\n\nQuinn recalled that Eric had once been married to a woman with the same name. Eric affirmed that Sheila Carter was the ex-wife in question. Quinn noted that Eric never talked about Sheila and didn't have pictures of her around. Quinn concluded that it was as if Sheila had never existed. Eric said there was a reason for it all -- Sheila had been trouble.\n\n\nQuinn asked if it was the same kind of trouble that she was. Eric replied that Quinn was the good kind, but Sheila had been dangerous. Quinn figured he'd loved Sheila if he'd married her and asked if the family had supported the marriage. Eric explained that Sheila had been hiding her true self, and he'd never known her. He said the family hadn't approved, and Ridge had disapproved the most. \"As it turns out, for very good reason,\" Eric added.\n\n\nQuinn said there had to have been good times. Eric agreed that there had been at first. He flashed back to meeting Sheila, proposing to her, and carrying her to bed. Next, he recalled an argument when Sheila had decided she'd answer his question about what went on inside of her. She'd sobbed that she feared the world and everyone in it. Most of all, she'd feared losing Eric.\n\n\nEric stated that he didn't even know if Sheila was alive. \"But Sheila was bad. Very, very bad,\" he asserted sadly.\n\n\nBack at Katie's house, Katie arrived home. She strode through the living room and gazed through the telescope. \"Hello, Katie,\" Sheila said from the terrace. Katie shrieked. Katie asked what Sheila was doing in Katie's house. \"We all thought...\" Katie said.\n\n\n\"That I was dead,\" Sheila finished for Katie. Sheila said there were a lot of crazy stories out there concerning her whereabouts and her identity. She told Katie that they were just stories. \"I'm here in the flesh,\" she stated. Katie asserted that it didn't explain what Sheila was doing in Katie's home. Sheila noted that Katie had a son. \"What do you know about my son?\" the protective Katie asked. Sheila knew that Bill was Will's father. Katie asked what Sheila wanted from Katie.\n\n\nSheila decided that she shouldn't have taken herself to Katie's house. Katie agreed that Sheila should not have done so after all Sheila had done to Katie's loved ones. \"Where do you think I've been? I did my time,\" Sheila stated.\n\n\nSheila neared the telescope, and Katie skirted toward the fireplace to keep her distance from Sheila. Sheila noted that telescope was aimed at Eric's house. It suddenly occurred to Katie that Sheila was the one who'd fired the shot at Quinn. Sheila kept saying, \"No,\" as Katie spoke. Katie grabbed a fire poker, and Sheila told her to put it down. Katie screamed at Sheila not to get any closer. \"I said put it down,\" Sheila replied in a smoldering voice.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "At the police station, Katie continues to maintain her innocence. Eric is relieved when Lt. Baker informs them that the lab results confirmed that Katie did not fire a gun at Quinn.

    "tvmega_recap": "Katie cannot believe she is standing here trying to defend herself to Eric. He says he understands but they need to get to the bottom of this. Sally says again for the hundredth time that Steffy has every right to be skeptical and she is sorry that she stole from Forrester and that will not happen again. Thomas is irked that Steffy said Sally is taking advantage and is using him for his money to bail out Spectra. Katie says Quinn has done terrible things to so many people but she swears that she did not do this. But someone did and that person is still out there and the police should be looking for them. Quinn talks only a few minutes with Sheila and says she needs to get home. Sheila says they need to talk and get to know each other better or not. Eric tells Lt. Baker that he is convinced that Katie had nothing to do with this shooting and surely her questioning is over. Lt. Baker tells Eric and Katie that it is probably a good idea to hire additional security as that guilty person is still out there and could try again. Steffy tries to make amends and says she just does not want Thomas's heart broke again. He says he is carving out a new life for himself, not only with Spectra instead of Forrester but with this woman right here. Sheila looks through the telescope aiming at the spot where Quinn had been standing. Meanwhile Eric comes home and tells Quinn that he will not let anything happen to her. He relays that the forensics came back and there was no residue on Katie so she was not the shooter. Quinn fills Eric in that she used the binoculars and then went next door to Katie's and met a woman who said she was a friend of the Logan's. She says she just now remembers that he was married to a woman named Sheila yet she knows nothing about her and there are no pictures. Eric says for a reason; Sheila was very bad news. Katie returns home and is beyond shocked to find Sheila there. She wants to know why Sheila is there. Sheila replies in a matter of fact manner that she has a beautiful home, a great looking son by Bill Spencer .Katie interrupts and asks what is she doing there and what does she want? Liam tells Steffy that he is so proud of her. He knows how worried she is about her brother but she handled Sally well and on point. He thinks Sally wants to be better and what better way than have Thomas as her influence. She hopes he is right but she is a Spectra and they rarely change their spots. Thomas tells Sally he has something to show her and he wants her to keep an open mind. On a design pad he shows her the new improved Spectra logo .slightly quirky but always in good taste. This time next year they will be on everyone's minds. Quinn asks if Sheila is trouble like Quinn. Eric says no, she is good trouble, but Sheila Carter is bad trouble. They did have some good times and he did fall in love and asked her to marry him. But she is dangerous and he is not sure she is even alive anymore, but she is bad, very bad. Sheila tells Katie that she has done her time and all is well. Katie accuses her of being there and looking through the telescope which Sheila knows is looking right onto the Forrester balcony at Katie's. She accuses her of coming back to finish off her aim. She grabs the fireplace poker and holds Sheila off from coming any closer. Sheila tells her emphatically to put that down.",
