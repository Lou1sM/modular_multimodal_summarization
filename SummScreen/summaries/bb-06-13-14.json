    "soap_central": "\n\nStill nighttime at the cliff house, Liam was consoling Hope about Ridge's disappearance when a persistent knocking at the door jolted them out of their seats. Liam answered the door and grimaced when Quinn stormed in, exclaiming that Hope couldn't punish Wyatt for his mother's actions.\n\n\nHope responded that she'd made her decision, but Quinn insisted that she was there because Hope didn't have to worry about Quinn interfering in Wyatt's life anymore. Quinn relayed that Rick had fired her and Wyatt, and even though the contract had meant a lot to the Fullers, it didn't mean more to Wyatt than what he \"has\" with Hope. \"Had,\" Liam corrected.\n\n\nQuinn conveyed that Wyatt was hurting and had said things that no mother wanted to hear. She was willing to back off, but she implored Hope not to turn away from Wyatt. Hope reiterated that she'd made her choice. Quinn asked if Hope would be with Liam if Ridge had returned home with Brooke.\n\n\nHope asserted that Ridge hadn't returned and might not ever return. She said that her family was dreading having to tell R.J. that his father might be gone, but Quinn had the audacity to walk in and ask Hope to fix Quinn's relationship with Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn claimed she wasn't doing that and asked that Hope listen not to Quinn but to the voice in Hope's head that was telling her that Liam was just a security blanket in a family crisis. Hope said she'd get through it with Liam's support, but Quinn named the ways Wyatt had supported Hope at work. Hope said she'd always be grateful for that. She wished only good for Wyatt, but her future was with Liam.\n\n\nHope figured that security and stability sounded boring to Quinn, but they were essential to Hope. Hope said that Wyatt would someday be an uncle to her kids. Though he'd always have a place in the family, their relationship was over. Hope declared that she was back to being the woman she'd once been. She was focused on her family, in charge of her life, and in love with Liam.\n\n\nLater, Quinn had left, and Hope told Liam that she had never seen Quinn like that. Liam remarked that they'd never seen Quinn in so much trouble before. Quinn had lost the contract, the Forresters' respect, and possibly her son. Hope was amazed that Wyatt would cut his mother out of his life, but Liam theorized that it might be as good for Wyatt as it would be for Liam and Hope.\n\n\nHope stated that she wasn't second-guessing her choice, but she felt bad about hurting Wyatt. Liam knew that it hadn't been easy for her. Liam loved Hope for dealing with Wyatt compassionately, but to Liam, Quinn mistook people's sympathy and concerns for weaknesses. He said that Hope wasn't weak; she was the strongest person he knew.\n\n\nHope thought things would be strange at work due to all that had gone on. Liam said he agreed with one thing that Quinn had said -- that the crisis would end. He hoped that it would end with Ridge at home, giving Rick a hard time, and playing soccer with R.J. Liam felt that he and Hope had been through their share of hard times and reminded her that she could lean on him.\n\n\nHope expressed worry that Quinn could make the times tougher on everyone. Liam replied that they wouldn't let it affect them. Liam believed that Quinn and Wyatt had done their best to separate Liam and Hope, but he and Hope were together and stronger due to the lessons they'd learned. Liam promised that nothing would interfere with their happiness.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Caroline arrived while Wyatt was packing. Wyatt said he wanted to pack before security arrived. Caroline noted that Quinn and Wyatt's departure was due to Ridge's predicament, but she said no one had given up hope that he'd be found alive. Wyatt wanted that for Ridge's family but said it wouldn't help Wyatt's own family, thanks to his mother.\n\n\nWyatt explained that he'd spent his life, protecting his mother from her impulses, but he had to look out for himself. To him, Quinn was unable to foresee the consequences of her actions. Caroline sarcastically asked what a woman like that would see in Bill, and she noted that Wyatt wasn't like his parents. Wyatt claimed that Hope had changed him; however, his mother was his mother, and Hope had had enough of the both of them.\n\n\nWyatt explained that he'd told Quinn that someone could get hurt. He'd told her about the consequences, but enough was never enough for her. He added that when he'd told Quinn about Hope leaving him, Quinn's response had been, \"Oh, don't worry, baby. I'll fix it.\" Caroline hoped that he'd told his mother not to do that, and he replied that Quinn probably hadn't listened.\n\n\nCaroline noted that Wyatt didn't seem concerned, but he replied that he didn't possibly know how things could get worse. He believed that Hope still loved him, but she couldn't see herself making a life with him. He believed that his mother was just too much for anyone, and there was no getting Hope back while his mother was in his life.\n\n\nCaroline guessed Wyatt hadn't given up on Hope. Wyatt said it was a long shot, but he couldn't walk away defeated and return to his old life. He said there was no going back; there was just Hope.\n\n\nCaroline left, and Wyatt flashed back on his times with Hope.\n\n\nLater, Quinn sat down for a glass of whisky at the Bikini Bar and griped at the bartender when he wouldn't leave the bottle with her. A man approached, and in greeting her, he called her a lady. Quinn snipped that she was no lady, and he didn't want to sit there. The man decided to take his chances, and Quinn scowled, tossing back her drink as he sat down beside her.\n\n\nQuinn advised the man to try his pick-up lines at the other end of the bar. She'd had a trying day, and she was sure he didn't want to know about it. \"Try me,\" he replied. Quinn relayed that her life was falling apart, and she was about to lose her son, who'd been her whole life. The man asked if the son was sick, but she replied that her son had fallen in love.\n\n\nThe man snickered. Quinn dully added that her son had never been so happy, but Quinn had screwed it up. The man quipped that there were many women out there. Quinn relayed that the woman was different and had made her son want to be better. She admitted that she'd grown to love the girl.\n\n\nThe man, whose face remained out of view, said nothing, and Quinn insisted that he'd agree that the woman was special if he knew her name, a name she was sure he'd recognize. Quinn said Hope's name and noticed a reaction in the man. She guessed he did know who Hope was.\n\n\n\"Know her? Honey, I'm her daddy,\" the man responded, and Deacon's face appeared on-screen. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope stares at her iPhone but no new messages. Liam assures her that Ridge will be found and will come home. There's a sudden loud knocking at the door several times. Liam opens it and Quinn pushes past to get to Hope. She tells her that she can not punish Wyatt for what she has done. She says she cares too much about Hope to watch her do this to herself. She says coming back to Liam is a mistake. He jumps in then and says okay this is enough. She is wasting her breath. She pushes him away and says she is not talking to him. She is talking to Hope. She is making Wyatt pay for something he hasn't done. She says they don't have to worry about her. She won't be an issue. She will not be a problem in Wyatt's life anymore. FC and QAJ is finished. Hope knows how much that contract meant to them but it means nothing compared to what Hope means to Wyatt. Hope says she understands Wyatt is hurting right now. Quinn says yes. He said things tonight that a mother never wants to hear. She says she will back off if Hope will please just not turn her back on her son. Firmly, Hope says she has made her decision. Ridge is gone and they are all dreading the day they may have to tell RJ that his father is gone. And Quinn has the audacity to waltz in here and wants Hope to try and fix her relationship with her son. Quinn says no but this is all wrong. Her family is in a crisis and Liam feels like a security blanket, all warm and cuddly but crisis's can pass. Hope says she only wishes good things for Wyatt but her future is with Liam. Stability and security may seen very boring to Quinn but they are essential to Hope. She says someday when she and Liam get married they will have kids and Wyatt will be part of that as their uncle. He'll always have a place with them but their relationship is over. She is in love with Liam. Wyatt is slowly packing up all the jewelry in his office when Caroline comes in. She is sorry. He says it is as bad as it can get and he sees nothing positive in it. She says no one is giving up on Ridge yet so he could still be alive. Wyatt hopes that he is. He explains that he has spent most of his life trying to protect his mom from these impulses, but it's time he started thinking of himself. She's really not selfish, just reckless. She does whatever she wants when she wants it without seeing consequences. He says Hope changed him. He saw the value in honesty and for doing right for the right reasons. He did not grow up with that. Hope doesn't just see the best in people; she brings it out of them. But his mother is still his mother. But she knew about Ridge and Wyatt with Hope, but that didn't seem to matter. And now she wants to go to Hope and fix it. He tried to stop her but he doubts it could get any worse if she did. Wyatt tells Caroline that Hope still loves him but she does not see herself in a life with him ..at least not the one she wants. Life with his mom would be too much, for anyone, not just Hope. He says he is not defending her anymore and this has to stop. There is no getting Hope back with his mom in his life. But there is no going back or hanging his head down as if none of this ever happened. It's a long shot but there is only hope. Quinn leaves and Hope and Liam discuss how hurt she is. She's lost her job and now probably her son. But Wyatt is out of Hope's life and that is a good thing. She's the strongest person that he knows. Look how they have grown together. Quinn did say one good thing tonight. This crisis will end. She says she thinks she will go back to the office and just stay behind a closed door for a while. He promises her that there is nothing absolutely nothing that will interfere with their happiness now. Quinn goes to the Bikini Bar and plops down, asks for a whiskey and to leave the bottle. The bartender says he will give her a refill but nothing more than that. She argues that he surely doesn't think she wants to get drunk. Someone is watching all of this go down. He finally comes over and starts to sit beside the lady at the bar. She says she is no lady and he does not want to sit there. She says she can buy her own drinks, so maybe he can try his pickup lines down at the end of the bar. She quips that she's had a really bad day and he does not want to hear about it. But if he will go away she will tell him. She just got fired and she is about to lose her son too. He has been her whole life since he was born. He's not sick but he fell in love. He found the perfect woman and she has never seen him so in love until she screwed it up for him. The guy says well there are lots of other women out there. Quinn says not like this one. She even grew to love her. She had that affect on people. He might even know her if she mentioned the name ..Hope Logan. She realizes he does recognize the name. Deacon Sharpe says, \"Honey, I'm her daddy.\"",
