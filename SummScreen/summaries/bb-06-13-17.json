    "imdb": "Katie accuses Sheila of trying to shoot Quinn because she is married to Eric.

    "tvmega_recap": "Katie holds the fireplace poker and rants at Sheila not to come any closer. Sheila retorts that she is just talking to her so put the poker down. Quinn goes over it with Eric that someone wants her dead but the gunshot residue proved Katie did not do it. So someone else wants her dead. Liam tells Bill that the honeymoon was over the minute he walked back into the building. Brooke leaves and says she will leave them to work. Bill asks Wyatt and Liam what he missed. Wyatt says someone tried to shoot his mom. Bill says he loves his son but Quinn .not so much. And if Katie was cleared, then case closed. He is only concerned about Will. Pam tells Ridge that he and Quinn have come a long way. Just a while back everyone would have been in that line to shoot Quinn, but since being with Eric she has changed. But the shooter could come back. Perhaps they should put Charlie on security of her full time. Brooke drops in on Ridge and he says he would be her husband now if he had not screwed up. He fills her in that someone shot at Katie. Eric tells Quinn that Katie was hurt and angry but she is not a killer. He's lived with that kind of danger before. Sheila tells Katie that she knows nothing about a shooting so put the poker down. She did her time in prison and there is absolutely no trace of the old Sheila. The Forrester's were a big part of her past life and she would just like to make things right with them and Katie can help. Eric gets a text that Sheila is at Katie's house. He relays to Quinn now things make sense. He thinks maybe they have found the shooter. He says get Ridge up here as he does not want Quinn alone but he is going over to Katie's. Ridge agrees with Brooke that Katie would not shoot at Quinn but somebody did. He says whatever happened between him and Quinn was in the past but somebody is out for her. Sheila says that she doesn't shoot people anymore. She is not that lady from the past. And she is asking her nicely. She is trying to put her life back together and the Forrester's were a big part of it. She knows she has done terrible despicable things but she is never going to be that woman again. She loves Eric so much and just wants to make things right. Eric rushes in and Sheila lights up. Wyatt says his mom in the past has been a human wrecking ball but that was in the past. Since Eric she has been fine so he does not know who would want to hurt his mom now. Ridge rushes to Quinn and she says it has been a long day and it is not over yet. He says he is here now so nothing will happen to her. She fills him in on going over to Katie's and found this woman named Sheila Carter. Ridge says that is impossible. Quinn says no; Eric is there now. Sheila tells Eric he is so good looking and distinguished. She only wanted Katie's help. She came with good intentions and she just wants a chance with him to be accepted with his big heart. She'd like to show him she has learned her lesson and she is not that same person. He says he also has learned a lesson. The more she says she has changed the more dangerous she is. Someone fired at his wife and yet she says she is not guilty. He is not going to let her harm his family and certainly not his wife. Immediately he calls Lt. Baker and says he has the shooter, Sheila Carter.",
