He angrily tells her he does not want Ridge's face around his company.  Nick accuses her of sending Ridge mixed signals.  Brooke denies it.  Nick thinks the only reason Ridge is so excited about the Bedroom Line is because he wants to get Brooke in her underwear.  Nick is furious when Brooke tells him she is planning on modeling the lingerie in a fashion show.  Brooke reminds Nick that he encouraged her to stay at Forrester so she would not have to choose him over the company.  Trying to calm him down, she tells him that they will be married soon and gives him a big kiss.  Brooke then tells him Bridget and Dante are getting married too.  Nick is surprised; he had no idea that Bridget had such strong feelings for Dante.
