Baker said they would start with breaking and entering, but Sheila said she had not broken into Katie's house. Katie admitted that she'd left the back gate open.\n\n\nSheila addressed Eric and reminded him that he had known her better than anyone and that she would never hurt his new wife. Eric looked skeptical.\n\n\nBaker fired questions at Sheila about how long she'd been in Los Angeles. He wanted an address. Sheila turned the tables and asked if anyone had seen her with a gun. She was upset that someone had made a mistake. Eric noted that he had heard the same story from her. \"People can change, but Sheila is the exception to that,\" Eric said.\n\n\nDiscussion returned to charges against Sheila. Baker had to admit there had been no assault. Katie argued that Sheila's threatening presence and her voice were enough to scare her. Katie wanted to leave. She told Baker that she couldn't add anything and wanted to return home because she had spent enough time at the police station. Baker said she was free to leave, and Eric thanked her. She said she would do anything for Eric.\n\n\nEric returned to his seat, and Sheila told him to ask her anything. \"I don't care what anyone thinks of me but you,\" Sheila said. Baker took a phone call then excused himself.\n\n\nSheila maintained she had no reason to lie. Eric remembered that she had always said that. Flashbacks reviewed Sheila's terrifying history. She had tried to drown Stephanie and had also tried to poison her. She had threatened to kill Thomas as a baby in a discussion with Stephanie. \"I make good on my threats,\" she had warned Stephanie.\n\n\nSheila defended herself and said she'd become a different person. She had recently been involved in a program where she was asking for forgiveness from people she'd hurt. \"Even though I might not get it,\" she said.\n\n\nBaker returned. Sheila announced that there was no evidence against her. She implored Eric to remember when she had first started working at Forrester and how they had fallen in love and gotten married. She said she would never forget the details of their wedding. Eric was unmoved. He asked Baker about the restraining order he had filed years earlier and wondered if it had been temporary or permanent. He wanted it reinstated, and he wanted Sheila in prison.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill, Liam, and Wyatt discussed what had gone on while Bill had been gone on his honeymoon. He asked about a major expenditure, and Liam said he had approved helping a 22-year employee who'd needed emergency surgery.\n\n\nBill, Liam, and Wyatt discussed that Bill's dream of his skyscraper might have to be moved to a new location. Bill scoffed, but Liam told him that he'd had lunch with Sally Spectra and Thomas, and they had big plans for Spectra. He added that Thomas had deep pockets. Bill couldn't believe that Ridge had allowed Thomas to leave the Forrester business for Spectra.\n\n\nDiscussion moved to Katie and how she had originally been accused of shooting Quinn but had been cleared. Bill said no one had been hurt, and Katie felt the shooter was Sheila Carter -- one of Eric's crazy ex-wives.\n\n\nBill explained that Sheila had shown up at Katie's. He added that, years before, Sheila had terrorized any woman who had been near Eric. Liam said that he had heard stories about her.\n\n\nBill said Sheila had been accused of murder, assault, blackmail, abduction, and shooting people more than once. She had spent a lot of time in and out of prison. Wyatt worried that Sheila had shot at his mother.\n\n\nBill and Liam agreed that Sheila made Quinn look sane. Wyatt angrily maintained that his mother was the victim. Bill agreed and promised to get Justin involved. Bill received a text message from Katie that Will was with the nanny, and Sheila would not be allowed to leave the police station. Wyatt wanted to visit his mother, but Bill pointed out that she and Eric had to be exhausted after a crazy day. \"Eric is probably as rattled as your mother,\" Bill said.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Ridge sat with Quinn because Eric didn't want to leave her alone. Eric called from the police station to tell her that they had Sheila in custody. Ridge said that Sheila was dangerous. \"She shoots people,\" he said.\n\n\nRidge suggested that Quinn should relax and go upstairs. She said she needed something to calm her nerves. She considered a drink, but she said that hadn't been a good idea on previous occasions.\n\n\nRidge wondered what he could say that would make her feel better. She suggested that if she had a fortune cookie, she would want it to read that \"the one you love will always love you.\" She said, \"That would make me happier than anything else.\"\n\n\nRidge and Quinn discussed that Eric had always fallen for women who had a dangerous side. Ridge noted that Stephanie had once faked a heart attack by bribing the doctor. Discussion became more serious when Quinn confessed that she had always feared her mother would try to kill her.\n\n\nQuinn was tired of talking about herself. She wanted to hear about Ridge's day. He said that he had discovered that his son was more like him than he'd thought, but he was more willing to take risks. Ridge had also found that Steffy was running the company better than he ever could.\n\n\nRidge added that Brooke had returned, and they were very civil to one another in the \"corpse of their relationship.\" Quinn acknowledged that she was partly to blame. Quinn added that of all the people she figured would want to kill her, she never would have guessed it would be someone she didn't know. Ridge said he was glad she wasn't dead.\n\n\nRidge and Quinn received word that Sheila would not be released, but Ridge worried that Quinn didn't look relieved. She said she was worried about another danger, namely Ridge. She wanted him to leave. He agreed and said he had left sketches at the office that he would get. He said he would return to the guesthouse, but he would check on her first. Quinn thanked him for being a friend.\n\n\nAt Katie's, Katie received a text message from the nanny that Will was fine. Katie eyed her telescope and looked through it at Quinn standing on the veranda. Quinn looked around and noticed the bullet hole in the pillar behind her.\n\n\nA gloved hand appeared to be prepared to pull the trigger on a rife. Quinn was in the crosshairs. The gloved finger pulled the trigger, and the screen went black as a shot rang out.\n\n\n",
