    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the police station, Sheila insisted to Eric that she hadn't taken a shot at his wife, and the evidence would prove it. She said that spending time in jail had settled Sheila's debt to the state, but she believed she had to make things right with the people she'd hurt. Eric wasn't interested in making her feel good about the things she'd done.\n\n\nSheila said she didn't expect anyone to forgive her, but if one person could, she wanted it to be Eric. Eric quipped that if she wanted to ask for forgiveness, she shouldn't take shots at his wife first. Sheila figured that Eric would only be able to think of the bad times.\n\n\nEric replied that whatever had been good between him and Sheila didn't matter. Sheila revealed that she'd been looking for some type of acknowledgement, and it would feel good to her if he admitted that a part of him had cared for her once. \"I married you, Sheila,\" he replied.\n\n\nSheila explained that she'd been working on herself and rehabilitation because she'd remembered how he'd looked at her. She remembered the woman she'd been before it had gone so bad and been violent. Sheila claimed that she'd paid her dues. She said she'd sat in her cell and had remembered the hideous things she'd said and done. Some of those things were misdeeds that only she knew about.\n\n\nSheila believed that she was \"coming out on the other side of it\" and becoming the woman that deserved to be with him. Eric told her that he was a happily married man. Sheila corrected that she'd meant a woman capable of being loved by a man like him, and Eric's receptiveness wasn't the point.\n\n\nLieutenant Baker arrived and told Eric that the restraining order that Eric had had against Sheila was permanent. Sheila readily apologized for violating it, saying she hadn't even known it was still valid. Baker told Sheila that she was under arrest for the attempted murder of Quinn and for violating the restraining order.\n\n\nSheila swore to Eric that she'd never tried to kill his wife, and she hadn't even known that she'd been violating a restraining order. Baker began reading Sheila her rights, and she spoke over him, pleading with Eric to help her. Eric looked away, and Baker asked if she understood her rights. Staring at Eric, she told Baker that she understood.\n\n\nSheila was processed and fingerprinted. Eric watched. Sheila pleaded with him to drop the issue about the restraining order because she hadn't been near his family in years. Baker stated that the order had been made permanent for a reason. Despite Sheila's pleas, Eric asked the police to take her away.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge entered the CEO's office. Brooke was surprised to see him there and said she'd thought he'd gone home. He retrieved a sketchpad from the table and told Brooke that she wouldn't believe who'd been the one to take a shot at Quinn -- Sheila Carter. Brooke was shocked to hear it, but it made sense to her. Ridge stated that Sheila was in custody, and they didn't have to worry about her going after Quinn anymore.\n\n\nBrooke gave Ridge a knowing stare. She asked Ridge to let her know if Sheila got released. Brooke asserted that if Sheila wound up on Brooke's doorstep, Sheila would get what she deserved. Ridge didn't think Sheila was getting released after what she'd done.\n\n\nOn the Forrester balcony, Quinn stood. A bullet whizzed by her and cracked open a flowerpot on the ledge. Quinn gasped and ducked for cover as the gloved shooter continued firing. She fumbled into the living room and lay flat on the floor. Quinn crawled over to her phone on the coffee table. Her front door opened. \"Deacon! I'm glad you're here!\" Quinn exclaimed.\n\n\nThe bearded Deacon quipped that it wasn't the reception he'd been expecting. Quinn ordered him to get down on the ground, and she told him that someone was trying to kill her. \"Someone's trying to kill you how?\" Deacon asked. She said someone had been shooting at her. She tried to call the police, but Deacon saw that she was too jittery. He whipped out his own phone.\n\n\nAs Deacon made a call, he quipped that life on the hill was more dangerous than Quinn had thought. Into the phone, Deacon said they needed the police at the Forrester estate because someone was using it as target practice. Quinn helped him give the address as three-six-nine Willow Road. He said to hurry because the lady didn't like getting shot at.\n\n\nAfter the call, Quinn asked if Deacon was drunk. He said he didn't get drunk anymore -- but he did drink a little. She yelled at him to get on the ground because she didn't want him dying in her living room. Deacon didn't think he'd ever seen her so scared, and she replied that she hadn't had bullets flying by her before. Deacon said not to worry; he'd take care of her.\n\n\nLater, Quinn asked if the emergency operator had told Deacon how long it would be. Deacon assumed it would be soon. He jumped with a start, thinking he'd heard a noise. Quinn panicked, believing that the shooter could be on the property. He asked why she thought so, and she explained that the shots had started far away but had sounded closer and closer. She was grateful that the person had been a lousy shot. Deacon figured that it could be a sharpshooter, but the wind conditions had affected the aim.\n\n\nDeacon decided to have drinks, and Quinn again urged him to duck as he stood at the minibar, fixing shots. He quipped that he wasn't the one getting shot at. He said the shooter might be her husband. He added that it was always the husband.\n\n\nDeacon wanted to drink to the good old days. \"With you?\" Quinn quizzically asked. Taking a swig of one of the drinks he held, Deacon stated that Quinn had never cared about him. Deacon said she'd never wanted him; she'd wanted Forrester.\n\n\nQuinn didn't know what stories Deacon had been telling himself, but in her view, she'd kicked him to the curb long before she'd gotten together with Eric. Deacon credited her for thinking ahead because she'd never be able to con a Forrester with him at her side. She replied that what he'd said was just stupid.\n\n\nDeacon believed what was stupid had been him helping Quinn play make-believe with Liam. Deacon asked what he'd gotten for it. He yelled that he'd been pushed into the ocean. \"Why are you bringing that up now?\" Quinn asked. He yelled that he'd been left for dead because she didn't give a damn about anyone but herself. Quinn said it wasn't true.\n\n\nDeacon agreed and said she'd do anything for baby boy Wyatt. Deacon felt that he'd been treated as if he was nothing his whole life. He'd thought Quinn would be different, but she'd wanted him to disappear just like the others. Quinn understood that he was upset and how she could be partly to blame; however, she had a hard time sympathizing while her life was in danger.\n\n\nDeacon wasn't even sure he believed Quinn's little story about a shooter. It would have been plausible a few months back, but at that point, she had the Forresters' acceptance. Quinn stood behind a chair as if it was a shield. She said he'd told her that he hadn't seen her as scared as she was then.\n\n\nDeacon said that Quinn might be playing a game and asked who, besides Hope, would want to see her dead. He reasoned that Liam wanted to rid the planet of Quinn, and Bill just plain hated her guts. Deacon decided that when one thought about it, she'd done a lot of awful things to a lot of people, worst of all to Deacon, the man who'd loved and trusted her. He stated that he had more reason than anyone to want to see her dead.\n\n\nQuinn asked for Deacon's phone so she could see how long it had been since he'd called the police. Pointing a handgun at her, Deacon replied that they both knew he'd faked the call.\n\n\nQuinn said Deacon didn't want to throw his life away. Deacon quipped that he had such a wonderful life and job, and he was surrounded by loving family. She tried to say things could change, but he cut her off, asking if she was trying to say he'd get married and live happily ever after. He stated that he'd tried that, but it hadn't worked out so well.\n\n\nDeacon guessed he should let Quinn have some last words, and he promised he wouldn't miss again. Quinn begged him to think of Hope, who needed her father. Deacon said he'd thought of how Hope had tried to convince him not to marry Quinn. \"But, hey, I knew best!\" he quipped. Quinn said they hadn't been wrong. At one point, they'd been good for each other, but people sometimes grew apart. He felt that her words were especially true when one person wanted better than she already had.\n\n\nDeacon decided to drink Quinn's shot, but Quinn said he needed to sober up and get back on the program. She bargained with him, saying that if he did it, they'd never have to discuss \"this\" again. Deacon said he wouldn't say anything to anyone. He asked why he would if no one knew he was there.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie stared blankly. She strode past her telescope and stood on the threshold of the patio. She flashed back to holding on empty gun on Quinn and recalled talking about winners and losers. She remembered saying that she should get rid of Quinn once and for all.\n\n\nKatie looked through her telescope and saw Quinn in her living room, lifting her hands up. Katie saw a gun pointed at Quinn. Katie gasped and grabbed her phone.\n\n\nKatie called Ridge, who was sketching on his bed. Katie urged him to go help Quinn because someone was pointing a gun at her. Ridge tried to ask what was happening, but Katie screamed at him to hurry.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Quinn walked with her hands up toward the fireplace. Deacon stood with his back to the front door. She tried to reason with him, saying that they'd once been good together. \"You know what they say about all good things...\" Deacon said.\n\n\nQuinn screamed at Deacon not to do it. Ridge grabbed Deacon from behind, spun him around, and socked him in the face. Deacon fell by the coffee table. Ridge retrieved the gun and asked if Quinn was okay. Quinn rushed into Ridge's arms, crying and thanking him. She sobbed, asking Ridge to hold her and never let her go. Ridge uttered that he had her.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Quinn's regained confidence in her own safety is short-lived as gun shots are fired at her yet again.

    "tvmega_recap": "Out on the balcony again Quinn looks toward Katie's and suddenly she is in the crosshairs again when shots, more than one, ring out in her direction. Sheila is at the police station and says she is not guilty in this .the evidence will speak for itself. Quinn crawls around on the floor trying to reach her phone. As she picks it up the door opens and it is Deacon. She is glad to see him and says someone is trying to kill her. He says that was not exactly the reception he was expecting. He can't imagine who would be trying to kill her. But she begs him to call the police and get down; there is still a shooter out there. He says he has never seen her so scared but he will take care of her. Ridge goes to the office and sees Brooke. He says he came back for some sketches.

Just do not shoot at his wife now. Lt. Baker informs Sheila that her restraining order is still viable and she is under arrest. Sheila begs Eric to do something; she did not do this. While Quinn is still on the floor and wanting Deacon to be careful he pours himself a drink and says not to worry the sharpshooter is not after him. And he knows she does not care about him at all; she only wanted a Forrester to marry. He got pushed in the ocean for trying to help her before. She sold her soul for a shot at the good life. She says she can understand he is upset but right now her life is at stake and that is all she can worry about. He wonders who might want to see her dead ..well there is Hope and Liam and there are probably a lot more. And right at the top is him. He pulls a gun on her and says he faked that call to police. They are not coming. Sheila is booked and fingerprinted and mug shots taken. As they take her away she begs Eric again to stop this. She is a different person and has not bothered his family in years. Quinn tells Deacon to put the gun down. He could spend the rest of his life for this. He says he tried the true and narrow but it never worked. This time he is not going to miss. He wants better than he got. He continues to drink. Quinn says if he will just stop and sober up she will forget all about this and never mention it again. Katie is still looking through the telescope and sees something. She runs to the phone and calls Ridge and tells him to get to Quinn quickly; she has a gun pulled on her. Quickly Ridge slips in the door and knocks out Deacon. Quinn rushes into his arms.",
