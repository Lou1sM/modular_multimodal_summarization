Caroline wondered what had changed, because Ivy and Liam had been together for months, and they seemed committed to one another.\n\n\n\"I'm back now,\" Steffy said. She announced that she and Liam would be working together. Steffy lamented that she and Liam would still be together and married if she hadn't run off previously. Steffy knew it was complicated to explain to Ridge and Caroline, but she also knew that Liam had planned to end things with Ivy that night.\n\n\nCaroline reiterated that Liam was committed to Ivy, but Steffy noted that things could change in an instant. Steffy told Caroline that she should have never left Los Angeles, and she knew that Liam felt the same. She explained that they had a lot of history.\n\n\nSteffy recalled that she and Liam had been married, and she had been pregnant. Liam had asked her not to ride her motorcycle, but she had and had subsequently lost their baby. Caroline understood, but she reminded Steffy that Liam would never have held that against her. Steffy agreed, but she said he'd moved on with Ivy after Steffy had gone, and she didn't blame him.\n\n\nSteffy said she planned a surprise for Liam, and Caroline said it was sweet. Ridge interrupted and said that he didn't want Steffy to get her hopes up and get hurt. Steffy told Ridge to relax. She was convinced that Liam would end things with Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy took time to apologize to Ridge and Caroline. She realized that they made each other happy. Steffy said she was glad. She added that Caroline had helped Ridge draw again, and he was helping Caroline to walk again. She believed adversity had connected Ridge and Caroline. She was glad they were happy.\n\n\nLater, Steffy had gone, and Ridge and Caroline chatted. Ridge said it was nice to see Caroline and Steffy getting along. Caroline said it was a bit awkward. Ridge agreed, and he added that Steffy was stubborn.\n\n\nCaroline laughed and said, \"I wonder where she gets that from.\" Ridge laughed and asked if Caroline wanted to try the walker again. Caroline said she loved his encouragement, but she needed a rest.\n\n\nRidge said that Steffy was part right in her assessment of their relationship. \"I want to help you get better, but it's not adversity that brought us together. I fell in love with you because you are the most complete person I know,\" Ridge said. Caroline said that when Ridge said things like that, she fell in love with him all over again. She pulled on his collar to draw him close to her, and they kissed passionately.\n\n\nAt Forrester in Wyatt's office, Wyatt wondered why Quinn was happy that Ivy would marry Liam. Quinn noted that it would mean Liam was off the market, and Steffy would be eager to pursue Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt wondered what role Quinn had played in Ivy and Liam getting together. Ivy said she had given Ivy a little push to ask Liam to save her from being deported. Wyatt seemed skeptical, but she noted that she and Ivy had formed a nice working relationship.\n\n\nQuinn was hoping that Ivy would text to tell her if she had married Liam, but Wyatt doubted that Ivy would send a text to Quinn. Later, Quinn had gone, and Wyatt found a news release about Steffy. He flashed back to their kiss and smiled.\n\n\nAt Liam's place, Ivy, dressed in a beautiful white dress, said she couldn't believe they were getting married. Ivy noted that the marriage certificate was just paperwork, and they were still just dating.\n\n\nCarter asked them if they were ready. He said he didn't want to skip over anything, because everything had to be perfectly legal for Immigration to recognize the marriage. Carter added that he usually said something about the couple before the ceremony. \"Would you mind if I did that?\" Carter asked. Ivy and Liam agreed it would be nice.\n\n\nCarter said that he realized the marriage was a legal arrangement to keep Ivy in the country, but he noted that they had to have trust in each other to get married. Ivy and Liam smiled. Ivy thanked Liam.\n\n\nIvy agreed they'd still be just dating and nothing more. The marriage would be a limited partnership for a specific purpose. Carter conducted the ceremony. He spoke about their relationship, and he helped them recite their vows. Ivy went first and zipped through the vows without a hitch.\n\n\nLiam said his vows. He started off strong and equally as sincerely as Ivy had, but he stumbled and struggled. He stopped. Ivy asked him if he had a problem with marrying her. Liam noted that he knew Ivy was scared. He wanted to make her happy. \"Liam, you are helping me,\" Ivy said.\n\n\n\"We can take a break,\" Carter said. Liam declined. \"Are you sure?\" Carter asked. Liam launched into his vows without any assistance from Carter. He smiled as he finished with just a little help from Carter.\n\n\nCarter announced that Ivy and Wyatt had pledged themselves to each other. \"It is my honor to pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride,\" Carter announced.\n\n\nLiam kissed Ivy tenderly. They all signed the marriage certificate. \"It's done, Mr. and Mrs. Liam Spencer,\" Carter said. He noted that the certificate was the proof they would need, and he added that he would take a photo so they would have that as proof, as well. Carter snapped a photo of them on his camera and promised to text it to Liam and Ivy. He congratulated them. Liam and Ivy thanked him, and he left.\n\n\nLiam and Ivy hugged. Liam noted that Ivy had worked too hard to build a life in America to lose it because of some paperwork errors. She thanked him, and she said he had rescued her when she had fallen in the Seine, and he had rescued her again. They embraced. Ivy left the room to change.\n\n\nAt Steffy's, Steffy looked through photos on her phone, and she found one of her with Liam at their first wedding in Colorado. She texted it to Liam, and she added text about remembering good memories.\n\n\nLiam opened the text from Steffy on his phone while Ivy was in another room. He looked nervous. He texted that he needed to see Steffy the next day. Steffy responded that she looked forward to it. Steffy sat and smiled. She looked confident and admired the photo from their first wedding.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam looked unhappy. Ivy returned to the room. He said he'd thought she had gone to change, but she said the dress was too pretty. Liam agreed she had been a beautiful bride. \"I felt like one,\" she said. She announced that she was Mrs. Liam Spencer.\n\n\nLiam and Ivy laughed at what a whirlwind day it had been. Liam said he hadn't thought he'd be getting married when he'd gotten up that morning. Ivy was grateful Liam had married her because she didn't have a backup plan to avoid deportation.\n\n\nIvy added that she knew getting married probably hadn't helped their relationship. \"You helped me. I love you, Liam,\" Ivy said, and she kissed him. \"My husband,\" she said, and they both laughed. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy knows that Ridge feels that she should give up on Liam. Caroline realizes that Liam has been with Ivy for a good while now yet Steffy even says after tonight she thinks things will be different. She acts like this is just another little bump in the road to her getting back with Liam. When Steffy starts talking about making a surprise for Liam with all their good memories, Ridge just feels she is setting herself up for more hurt. Liam is probably talking to Ivy right now about the situation. Ivy tells Liam that everything will be all right. They are doing what they have to do for her to stay in the United States. She promises Liam that they are just dating and this is just paperwork. From all his questions, Quinn thinks Wyatt is missing the point. She assures him that she had nothing to do with this wedding other than perhaps giving Ivy a little push .not like the one in the Seine, but of reassurance. She is glad Ivy can come to her now in moments of advice or need. And she points out that if Ivy and Liam are married that leaves an opening for him and Steffy. Carter wants to keep this legal but asks if they can just skip to the I do's or perhaps they should touch upon their relationship and what makes it unique. They do not even need rings; just their intent to get married and then making their vows. Ivy thanks Liam. They follow Carter's lead. Liam is nervous and stammers a bit at times. Ivy asks if there is a problem. Carter finally pronounces them husband and wife and Liam kisses the bride. They all sign the certificate and Carter even takes a picture for more proof. Ridge thinks it is nice that Steffy and Caroline got along. At work Wyatt looks at a picture of Steffy and thinks back on their kiss. Steffy sits at her desk and looks lovingly at a picture of Liam. Ivy and Liam hug and kiss as they are now Mr. and Mrs. Liam Spencer. But Liam looks a little worried.",
