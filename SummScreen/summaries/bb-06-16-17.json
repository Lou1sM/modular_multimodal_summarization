    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the police station, Eric was amazed that Sheila was back in his life. He hadn't thought about her for years. Lieutenant Baker said the bullet could have been the end of Quinn. Thanking Baker for his help, Eric was relieved to no longer have to worry about Quinn's safety.\n\n\nBaker was sure that, with the attempted murder charge, Sheila wouldn't get out of jail anytime soon. Saying that he was headed that way, Baker offered to give Eric a ride home. Eric realized that he did feel a little distracted to drive, and he accepted the offer.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Brooke and Bill canoodled in his office, and he asked her to surprise him more. She felt that they were lucky to be so happy. Bill replied that they deserved it. She just couldn't stop thinking of Eric and Ridge and said it had to be awful dealing with Sheila Carter.\n\n\nBill said he had heard that Sheila had been loonier than Quinn. Brooke replied that he didn't know the half of it, and he decided that he might not want to. They started kissing again, but Bill got a news alert on his phone. He checked it and said one of his night crawler reporters had gotten a tip of shots fired at the Forrester estate. Shocked, Bill said he'd thought Sheila was in custody.\n\n\nBill confirmed what he'd heard about the gunshots with Wyatt, who'd heard the same thing. Brooke got upset and said they had to head over to the Forrester mansion.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn clung to Ridge, who assured her that he had her. Ridge called the police. Afterward, Deacon groaned and woke up. He sat up and asked what had happened. Quinn seethed that he'd tried to kill her, and she called him an idiot. Deacon guessed that he'd drunk too much. Ridge said to take it easy and not to try anything because the police were on the way.\n\n\nDeacon said he wasn't stupid. He just wanted to talk to Quinn alone. Quinn replied that he was stupid and would spend the rest of his life in prison. Deacon asked what she wanted from him and said he was broke. He'd tried reaching out to her, but she hadn't responded. Ridge asserted that she didn't owe Deacon anything. Deacon replied that it was easy for Ridge to say, but Quinn had dumped Deacon and broken his heart.\n\n\nQuinn said she should have known Deacon, the worthless, selfish drunk, would do something like that, and she didn't want him around her ever again. Deacon asked that they call off the cops and let him leave. He didn't want to rot in a jail cell. Quinn yelled that he should have thought of that before trying to kill her. \"You tried to kill me first! Now we're even!\" Deacon replied.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that it had been just a little shove. \"Off a cliff and into the ocean!\" Deacon responded. He said that if it hadn't been high tide, he would have been a goner. Ridge glanced incredulously at Quinn and back to Deacon, who was saying he hadn't squealed on Quinn about it because he wasn't a snitch. Deacon claimed that he'd given Quinn a second chance, and he was asking her to do the same.\n\n\nRidge said that was enough and ordered Deacon not to move. Quinn asked how Ridge had known to save her. He replied that Katie had seen that Quinn was in trouble and had called him. Just then, Katie burst through the front door, thanking God that Quinn was okay. Quinn said that if it weren't for Katie, Quinn would be dead. Katie assumed Sheila was there but was shocked to see Deacon in the living room. She asked him what he'd been thinking. Ridge said it was for money.\n\n\nDeacon said he'd been desperate, and he'd started drinking again. He said he'd messed up. Katie asked if he'd been the shooter the whole time. \"Yeah...\" Deacon quietly replied.\n\n\nEric and Baker rushed in. They'd heard about the shots on the police radio. Ridge handed Baker the gun, and Eric was shocked to see Deacon. Ridge stated that it had been Deacon, not Sheila. \"Yeah, it was me, but she did it first!\" Deacon yelled.\n\n\nEric held Quinn. Katie rolled her eyes as Deacon said, \"Yeah, she pushed me off a cliff. Your blushing bride didn't tell you that?\" Quinn called Deacon crazy. Deacon disparaged Quinn for being married to Eric and all Eric's money. Deacon claimed that he'd helped Quinn with her business, but she'd left him high and dry.\n\n\nBaker instructed his officers to cuff Deacon. Deacon hadn't wanted it to turn out that way. He'd only wanted a couple of bucks. He'd kept reaching out, but Quinn wouldn't answer his text messages. Quinn believed she'd been right to cut him off, and she called him insane. Deacon replied that it was rich, coming from her.\n\n\nKatie asked if Deacon had been on her property. Deacon asked if Katie owned that big house over there. \"Hey, are you seeing anyone these days?\" he inquired, and Katie let out a sickened gasp. She asked if he'd set her up. He replied that he'd never do that to her and asked her what type of guy she thought he was.\n\n\nBaker asked if Deacon was working with Sheila Carter. Shocked to hear the name, Deacon replied that he'd thought she was six feet under. In everyone's silence, Deacon asked, \"What? She's not?\" Baker moved forward with the arrest, but Deacon said he'd told them he was sorry.  He kept saying that he was sorry and asked for no hard feelings as the police led him out.\n\n\nThe police left with Deacon, and Eric hugged Quinn. Bill and Brooke arrived, and she asked why Deacon was leaving in a police car. Wyatt rushed in to hug his mother. Katie and Ridge explained that Deacon had been the shooter. Quinn said she didn't know how she'd ever thank Ridge. Brooke and Katie each glanced around awkwardly.\n\n\nBrooke was astounded to hear about Deacon. Quinn said he'd been hounding her for months with veiled threats. Eric asked why Quinn hadn't told him. She said she'd been ignoring Deacon, figuring he'd go away. She hadn't thought Deacon would take it so far, and if it hadn't been for Katie and Ridge, Quinn would be dead.\n\n\nEric thanked Katie and hugged her. He did the same with Ridge and called Ridge a hero. Eric was sorry he'd left Quinn. He had thought she was safe with Sheila in jail. He said he was sorry, and they hugged. Quinn stared at Ridge, and Katie and Brooke watched Quinn and Ridge.\n\n\nLater, Eric got a call from Baker, who'd processed Deacon. Baker asked what Eric wanted to do about the restraining order violation against Sheila.\n\n\nBy the fireplace, Brooke, Wyatt, Katie, and Bill talked. Bill wanted to know where Will was. Katie said he was with Nina at Donna's house. Brooke said that what Quinn had been through was awful. Bill stated that Katie had been vindicated. Katie admitted that she'd aimed Charlie's gun at Quinn. Wyatt said they'd \"kind of\" heard about it.\n\n\nBill stated that Katie had had a moment, and they'd all had them. Brooke believed the important thing was that Katie had been able to get Ridge to rescue Quinn. Katie said that Quinn owed her life to Ridge, and Brooke uttered that it would connect them forever.\n\n\nOut on the balcony with Ridge, Quinn was still in shock that she'd almost died that day. She said that when she'd needed someone more than ever, he'd risked his life to protect her. Ridge replied that he'd do it again. She had a new sense of gratitude. He replied that something good had developed from it. Quinn stated that it was because of him. \"I'm sorry, but I have to say it. I love you,\" Quinn told Ridge.\n\n\n",
