Ridge turned and looked at her. They embraced, but Ridge seemed distant. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Hi,\" Brooke said tearfully.\n\n\nIn the hotel coffee shop in Abu Dhabi, Thorne and Katie sat and discussed that they didn't know what to think or do to find Ridge. Katie said she wanted to believe that Ridge was alive. \"I would know. I would feel it if he were dead,\" Katie said. Katie vowed to believe that Ridge was alive. \"I can't imagine life without Ridge. I need more time with him. I want more time,\" she said.\n\n\nKatie wondered when they would find Ridge. Thorne lamented that there had been too much loss in his life with the losses of his mother and Darla. \"When I needed my big brother, he'd be there,\" Thorne said. Katie said that she and Ridge had been planning their wedding and raising their boys together. Thorne said that he expected Ridge to walk in the door at any minute, but Katie said it was never that simple. Katie returned to the suite because she had left her phone there to charge.\n\n\nIn the Abu Dhabi suite, Brooke raced in and told Eric that she had found Ridge. Brooke walked in with Ridge. \"My God! Ridge!\" Eric hugged Ridge, but Ridge looked confused. Eric embraced him and kissed him. \n\n\n\"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. I just want to come home,\" Ridge said. Brooke said that \"so many\" people would be happy. \"Katie's going to be ecstatic. You do want to see her,\" Brooke said. \"I think that'd be nice,\" Ridge said without emotion.\n\n\nEric hugged Ridge again. \"Stephanie -- our boy is back. He's here,\" Eric shouted into the air. Brooke explained to Eric that she had been walking along the beach and had seen Ridge, but she hadn't been sure it was Ridge because his back had been to her. Ridge looked at her attentively as she described that she had found him. Brooke said it was a miracle.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house in Los Angeles, Hope opened the door to Deacon. She wondered why he had arrived, but he asked to sit down and talk. Hope explained that Deacon had shown up at an awkward time. She explained that Ridge had fallen out of a helicopter.\n\n\nDeacon claimed that he had good instincts, and he knew that Ridge would be fine. Deacon acknowledged that Ridge had been like a father to Hope. Hope noted that her mother had done everything in her power to keep Deacon away from Hope. Deacon agreed, but he said it was the smartest thing Brooke had ever done. \n\n\nDeacon apologized for ruining Hope's wedding in Italy. Hope said that she'd had a lot of time to think about that. \"Bill Spencer had a lot to do with that,\" she said.\n\n\nHope said the only thing she could think about was Ridge. Hope explained that Ridge and Katie were engaged, and Deacon was surprised. Hope said they were really sweet together. Hope explained that she and Liam were back together. Deacon said that Hope deserved the best, and he wanted her to be happy. Hope noted that she had met another guy, but the entire situation with Ridge had made her realize that what she wanted and needed in her life was Liam.\n\n\n\"I'm really sorry for all the time that I missed with you,\" Deacon said. He promised to stick around for good. \"Not a day goes by that I don't think of you,\" he said. Deacon maintained that he wanted to build a relationship with her. \"I want the chance to be your dad,\" he said.\n\n\nBrooke called Hope. \"Ridge is alive, and I found him. He's okay,\" Brooke said excitedly. \"Yay, please give Ridge a really big hug,\" Hope said. She and Brooke hung up, and Hope hugged Deacon. Hope said it was the best news. She said she had to tell everyone, and she called the day an epic day.\n\n\nIn the Abu Dhabi suite, Brooke had a heart-to-heart talk with Ridge. \"I knew you were out there in my gut and my heart,\" Brooke said. She added that she and Ridge had been connected for many years physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They had a bond that would never go away,\n\n\n\"I will always love you no matter what,\" Brooke said. She remarked that Ridge had flown to Abu Dhabi to save her -- like he had done so many times before. \"It didn't exactly turn out the way I had planned,\" Ridge said. Brooke gushed that it had all turned out pretty well because she had worried that she had lost him. She wanted Ridge to tell her what had happened, but she hugged him first. \"I want to hold onto you and never let go,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge looked thoughtful. Katie walked in, and Brooke let go of Ridge. He looked at Katie, and she embraced him and kissed him. Tears streamed down her face, and Ridge looked confused. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Katie and Thorne prepare themselves emotionally and professionally for the possibility that Ridge will never come home. While walking along the shore of Abu Dhabi Beach, Brooke stumbles upon the answer to whether or not Ridge survived the accident. Hope spends quality time with Deacon.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke is walking the beach and suddenly in the distant she sees a figure all in white that looks just like Ridge from the back. She runs toward him and when he turns around, it is Ridge. Gasping with tears in her eyes, she runs into his arms but he doesn't say a word nor does he act like he really knows her. Hope is surprised to open her door and find Deacon there. He said he just rolled into town and it's been far too long. And he wasn't even sure she'd want to see him. He asks if Brooke is home and Hope says no and lets him in. Hope fills him in quickly on what happened to Ridge and why Brooke is away. He tries to convince her that he has a good feeling about this and Ridge will be fine. She says she hopes he is right as losing Ridge is not an option. Too many people are counting on him. Deacon says he knows that Ridge was more of a father to her than he ever was. He ruined her wedding in Italy. Hope says she has had a lot of time to think about that and it wasn't all Deacon's fault. Bill Spencer put him up to it. She hasn't forgotten but all she can think of now is Ridge. Deacon is surprised to hear about Ridge and Katie as that came out of left field. Then he asks about the man in Hope's life. She tells him it is still Liam. Deacon wants to know if he is good to her, and she replies that he is wonderful. That's all Deacon wants to hear. He says she deserves the best. He is going to stay n town this time. There is not a day that goes by that he doesn't think of her and wants to build a relationship with her. He knows he has to earn that but he wants to be her dad. Thorne and Katie have lunch and she says she just has to keep thinking that Ridge is out there alive and someone will find him. Thorne says he can't go through this again, first losing Darla and his mother and now Ridge. He knows they have had their differences but he is his big brother and always there for him. Brooke rushes into Eric's room and shows him Ridge who is behind her. Stunned, Eric grabs Ridge and gives him a big bear hug. Ridge just holds on. He finally says he is not sure what all the fuss is about. Eric wants to know everything that has happened to him and what he needs now. Ridge says just to go home. Eric says Ridge is going to go home to the best homecoming ever seen. He tells Ridge that both Thorne and Katie are here and will be so glad to see him. Ridge says that's nice. Eric looks to the sky and tells Stephanie their boy is here. Ridge wants to know how long before they can get out of here. Eric tells him he needs to take a moment and catch his breath. Ridge says he feels fine. Eric says he will go tell the search team and Brooke says she will call Hope. Of course Hope is ecstatic and even hugs Deacon. He is so happy for her. She says with him coming and now Ridge this might be the most epic day of her life. She's got to let everyone know. Deacon says he will leave her with that. He knows they have a lot of celebrating to do. Brooke tells Ridge that Hope was so happy they all are. They knew he was out there. She knew it in her gut and in her heart. They have been connected for so many years, spiritually, emotionally, physically. And that is a bond that goes on forever. She will always feel that and knows he will too. She says she will always love him and he is her best friend. They will run to the end of the earth for each other and that is what he did to come here to save her. Ridge says it didn't quite turn out the way he planned. She says he is still her hero and it turned out all right as he is standing here. She gets to look into his eyes and know RJ still has his father. She adds that she doesn't know what she would have done if she had lost him. He says he is not going anywhere. She says she wants to hear every little detail but right now she just wants to hold onto him and never let go. As she is hugging him Katie walks in.",
