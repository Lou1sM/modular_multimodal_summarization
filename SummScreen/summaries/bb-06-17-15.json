Ridge asked her what she thought of a design he was working on, and he held it up for her to see. She never looked up but said it was good. \"You're fired,\" Ridge joked.\n\n\nSteffy chastised him and said it wasn't funny. Ridge worried about Steffy's obsession with Liam. Steffy said she wanted to make memories with him for the rest of their lives. Ridge warned she might not get what she wanted. He wanted her to be happy.\n\n\nSteffy informed her father that Liam made her happy. \"How cute are we?\" Steffy asked, and she held up a photo. \"I just want to remind him how good we are together,\" she added.\n\n\nSteffy was convinced she and Liam would soon be back together. Ridge advised her not to get her hopes up. He added that sometimes things didn't work out, no matter how much a person wanted them to. He explained that he and Taylor had never been able to make it work.\n\n\nSteffy scoffed that she was completely different from her mother and dad. Ridge reminded her that Ivy had been a big part of Liam's life. \"I don't want you coming back here crying,\" he said.\n\n\nSteffy said she wanted another chance with Liam. She remembered everything -- every laugh, every look, every song. \"I want to relive it again with him over and over and over,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam drank his morning coffee, and Ivy joined him. She asked if she looked different since she was a married woman. Liam said she was still as beautiful as she had been in the bridal gown. Ivy lamented that they'd had the most boring wedding night ever because they had fallen asleep so early.\n\n\nLiam said it had been a stressful day for everyone. Ivy promised to make up for it later. She added that she would make dinner and take some of her things over if it was okay. She wanted to make sure it looked realistic. Liam agreed.\n\n\nIvy and Liam discussed that nothing had changed in their relationship. They were still dating and were married only on paper. Ivy asked Liam if he wanted to take one car to work, but he said he had some things to take care of before he headed into Forrester. Ivy said she would see him later. Liam looked pained.\n\n\nAfter Ivy left, Liam called Steffy at Forrester and asked if she could meet him at the house as soon as possible. \"I really need to talk to you,\" Liam said. Steffy promised she would be right over.\n\n\nLater at Liam's, Steffy entered in a good mood. She said she had a lot of surprises for him. She carried a large purse and a bag and teased that she wasn't moving in \"yet.\" She said she wanted to make him smile and take him for a \"little stroll down Memory Lane.\" She promised there were many more memories ahead of them. Liam looked sad.\n\n\nSteffy showed Liam photos of them on her tablet. She said she'd spent too much time alone reminiscing in Paris, and she wanted to relive their time together. She said one place stood out the most: Aspen. She called it their special place, and she pulled out a snow globe with a carriage in it. She reminded Liam that they had taken a carriage ride through Aspen. They both flashed back to the carriage ride. Liam loved it.\n\n\nSteffy pulled out a favorite food they had enjoyed in Aspen: truffle fries. Liam dug into the fries. She said they could enjoy the truffle fries and watch Bob Hope, and she handed him two DVDs. Liam and Steffy laughed.\n\n\nSteffy added that after watching movies, they would need to burn off the truffle fries, so she would plan an adventure of paragliding. She took out miniature paragliding and parasailing toys, and they played with them. They flashed back to their adventures in Aspen. They laughed and kissed. Liam put his arms around her, and he stopped.\n\n\nSteffy said she had one more memento. She opened a box with their wedding rings -- mood rings they had purchased in Aspen. Steffy said the surprise ceremony had caught them both off guard. They flashed back to the mountain wedding they'd had in Aspen.\n\n\nSteffy apologized. She lamented that they would still be married if she hadn't run off to Paris. She was sorry she'd left. She remembered they were both in a lot of pain, but she should have stayed. Liam kissed her on the cheek. \"It's okay,\" Liam said.\n\n\n\"I love you,\" Steffy said. She wanted to start over. Liam tried to interrupt her, but she kept talking about how she wanted to get back on track. Liam asked her to stop. He said something had happened the previous night. Steffy understood it was intense, and she added that if he and Ivy had been together, it had to be the last time. \"That's not it,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam assured Steffy that he was going to tell her something that was going to make her unhappy, and he didn't want her to overreact, no matter how bad it sounded. Steffy said she never overreacted. She demanded that he tell her what had happened.\n\n\nLiam stuttered and stammered. Finally he was able to spit it out: \"We got married,\" he said. Steffy laughed. She said that for a minute, it had sounded like he'd said that he and Ivy had gotten married. Liam said nothing. \"No. No way. That's ridiculous. You and Ivy? Married?\" Steffy was incredulous, and Liam looked sad.\n\n\nIn Wyatt's office, Quinn and Wyatt discussed new jewelry items for the latest Forrester line. Wyatt could tell that Quinn wasn't listening to him. Quinn admitted that she'd been distracted. \"I'm dying to find out about Liam and Ivy,\" she said.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to find out if they were married. Wyatt said he was sure that Liam had felt pressured and obligated. Quinn maintained it would be a good thing for Wyatt because Steffy would be free.\n\n\nWyatt admitted he would love it, but he did not want anyone who was hung up on Liam again -- like Hope had been. Quinn encouraged Wyatt to be prepared for Steffy to arrive knocking on his door. Wyatt left.\n\n\nQuinn checked her phone, and Ivy walked in. \"You got married!\" Quinn shouted. Ivy smiled. She admitted that she had been afraid Liam wouldn't agree to it. Quinn noted that he had, and Ivy was safe from Immigration.\n\n\nIvy thanked Quinn for the wedding dress. She said it had been a nice touch. Quinn said Ivy had probably looked stunning. Ivy said she felt married on a spiritual level, but she knew they were only married because they had to be, not because they wanted to be. Ivy worried that her marriage could end in an annulment or divorce, but Quinn was convinced that Liam loved her and would want to stay married to her.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Ridge worked on a design, and Wyatt interrupted. He told Ridge that the new collection of jewelry designs was going well. \"Have you seen Steffy around?\" Wyatt asked. Ridge put down his pencil, and he advised Wyatt that Steffy had gone to see Liam.\n\n\nRidge warned Wyatt not to think too far ahead because Steffy had hoped to make it work with Wyatt's brother. \"Steffy will keep fighting for it,\" Ridge said. Ridge asked about Nicole, and Wyatt admitted he had blown it. Ridge said Wyatt might be better off to choose someone else. He offered to have Caroline fix him up with one of her friends. Wyatt said he didn't need help, and he left.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy walks out of the kitchen thinking she has that glow about her like an old married woman. But she is embarrassed that she fell asleep so early last night. They will have to make up for it tonight. Liam reminds her again they only married to keep her in the country so nothing has really changed. She will bring some clothes over to make it look real. Ridge is designing but can't get Steffy's attention. She is knee deep in thought looking at Liam's picture and finally tells her dad that she does not want to joke about it and hopes it will last the rest of their lives. She will see Liam later today since he is not at the office. Ridge tells her that he wants her to be happy but last he looked Liam was with Ivy. Steffy thinks perhaps last night may have been a game changer. This is now their time and she wants to remember every single detail they shared before. Likewise Quinn is distracted and Wyatt can not get her attention that they need more rings to be designed. That is what customers are asking for. He is not interested in what Quinn is thinking if Liam and Ivy got married. If they did then he knows Liam feels pressured as he is not ready to get married. Quinn thinks it would be great as that would free Steffy up for Wyatt. He laments that he's been there done that before and he doesn't want another girl who is hung up on Liam. He would welcome Steffy with open arms if it was him that she really wanted. Ivy and Liam decide to take separate cars to work and he will come later. The first thing he does is to call Steffy when Ivy leaves for the office. Ivy walks into Quinn's office and Quinn knows immediately something good happened and jumps up to greet her. She wants all the details. Ivy tells her that in time she will give Liam an annulment or divorce but Quinn says no. Liam will want them to stay married so do not give up on that. It was a real legitimate wedding whether it started out that way or not. Steffy walks into Liam's house holding a bag, several in fact. He asks how she is and she says now that she is back here she is terrific. And she is not moving in so for him not to worry. She just wants to take him down memory lane of what they once shared and could have again. Wyatt goes to see Ridge and tells him that he thinks he will like Quinn's new designs. Then he asks about Steffy and Ridge says he knows they have been spending some time together but she is off to see Liam now and Wyatt should not get his hopes up with her. When she puts her mind to something she usually gets it, so he is going to stay out of this and he thinks Wyatt should do the same. Steffy drags out a slide show of pictures, then a snow globe and even some truffle fries and Bob Hope movies. She has thought of everything. She'd like to take him paragliding but settles for toy army men on a parachute and they horse around inside. She kisses him passionately and he responds. Then she pulls out two mood rings, the ones they used to get married in Aspen. She tells him that she knows if it were not for her they would still be married. So she is sorry that she left him, but she loves him and is ready to start up again. Liam tries to tell her that before she goes on he has something to tell her, and it is about Ivy. Steffy sloughs it off and says she knows it had to be difficult last night. He says yes it was and he does not want Steffy to over-react. He and Ivy got married last night. Then she laughs and says no, it sounded like he said he married Ivy last night. That can not be. Tell her that is not true.",
