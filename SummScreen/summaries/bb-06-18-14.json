Eric asked Ridge what had happened, and Ridge explained that someone had found him and taken him in. \"And now I'm here,\" Ridge said. Katie explained that they had all been very worried. \"I'm sorry,\" Ridge said. Katie told him not to apologize.\n\n\nKatie explained to Ridge that they would investigate the accident. Ridge wanted to return home. Katie asked for a few minutes alone with Ridge. Brooke and Eric walked away. Brooke and Eric agreed that Ridge didn't seem to fully understand what had happened. Eric said a doctor had been called. \n\n\nThe doctor arrived. After he'd examined Ridge, he announced that Ridge had a concussion and suffered from memory loss and confusion. Eric demanded to know what had happened. Eric questioned why no one had notified the search team or the Forresters that Ridge had been found and had been alive. The doctor explained that he only knew that a family had taken Ridge in, and it had been a doctor's family. He promised to get answers for Eric.\n\n\nEric angrily said that all the hospitals had been notified that Ridge had been missing. Eric didn't understand why no one had contacted the search team. The doctor promised to investigate. The doctor added that it was important for Ridge to avoid stress, and he added that Ridge would need care in the United States for his memory loss and confusion.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Ridge's condition could be permanent, and the doctor answered that time would tell because the brain was mysterious. Ridge said he was good. The doctor warned again against stress. \"Let's go home,\" Ridge said. The doctor left, and Brooke noted that R.J. was excited to see Ridge, who looked confused at the mention of R.J. \n\n\n\"R.J., yeah sure,\" Ridge said with no emotion. Katie, Brooke, and Eric looked worried. Katie asked to speak to Ridge alone again. Katie talked to Ridge about hitting his head. She worried that he would not remember many things, and she reiterated what the doctor had said.\n\n\n\"Is that what he said, I don't remember,\" Ridge said with a smile. \"That's not funny,\" Katie said with a smile. Katie explained that she was happy just to see him and touch him. She didn't want to stress him, but she wanted to pick up where they'd left off. Ridge was quiet. He said that he didn't want to make her sad. He wanted to return home to his son. His little boy needed his dad.\n\n\nKatie agreed with Ridge. She explained how happy they had been, and she reminded him that he had tied the red ribbon on her on her finger as a symbol of his love. She told him that it had been romantic, unexpected, and beautiful. She added that they had promised to take a leap of faith together. She wanted him to remember every moment they had shared together, how they had fallen in love, and how they'd planned to raise their children together. \"Tell me you remember, Ridge. Tell me you remember us,\" she said.\n\n\nAt an outdoor cafe, Bill and Justin discussed the helicopter accident. Justin warned Bill that Ridge might have recognized Justin before Ridge went into the water. Bill wondered how it could have happened. Justin explained that Ridge might have noticed the Spencer logo on the shoulder of his jacket. Justin flashed back to when he had landed the copter and expected that Bill and Brooke would get on board. \n\n\nJustin was surprised that Ridge and Brooke boarded and not Bill and Brooke. Justin surmised that Ridge had ordered his own helicopter to whisk Brooke away, and Ridge hadn't noticed it was Spencer helicopter when he and Brooke boarded. Bill insisted that no one could find out that Justin had dumped Ridge into the water.\n\n\nBrooke interrupted. \"Ridge is alive,\" she shouted. Brooke said Ridge had a concussion and memory loss. Bill and Justin exchanged a nervous glance. \"This is wonderful news, Brooke,\" Bill said. \"Best in a long time,\" Justin agreed.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Rick, Maya, Carter, Donna, Pam, Aly, and Oliver had gathered for a meeting that Hope had called. Maya speculated that there had to have been news about Ridge. Hope arrived with Liam and announced \"Ridge is alive! Mom found him!\" Everyone was relieved. \"Ridge is back, baby,\" Liam said.\n\n\nCarter noticed Maya glaring at Oliver, and he warned her to stop. She agreed. Hope and Liam talked about how nearly losing someone had changed all of their lives. They all chatted about how fortunate they had been to get good news.\n\n\nAly thanked Oliver for his support. Oliver promised to always be there whenever Aly needed him. Oliver admitted that he and Ridge had their differences, but they would get past them.\n\n\nRick told Pam that Ridge often had made him furious, but he didn't want to learn to live without Ridge. Pam told Rick to tell Ridge that when he returned. They hugged.\n\n\nPam later told Donna that she believed Stephanie had helped find Ridge. Donna agreed that if anyone could \"boss around the universe -- it would be Stephanie.\" Hope called everyone together again. She reminded everyone that they were family, and they would all make promises to be more aware and forgiving no matter what happened.\n\n\nHope wanted everyone to remember to appreciate family. She was glad she had another opportunity to tell Ridge how much she loved him. Hope told Liam that it had taken a tragedy for her to realize what she had with him. She reminded Liam that he had never really lost her, but Liam said he felt he had. Hope promised to never stop appreciating Liam, and she vowed to never stop telling him that she appreciated him. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Word spreads throughout Forrester Creations regarding the latest development surrounding Ridge\u2019s accident. Justin expresses his concern to Bill that their involvement in the incident with the helicopter may soon be exposed. Eric and Brooke become alarmed when they notice peculiar behavior coming from a loved one. Carter calls Maya out on her obsession with Oliver and Aly\u2019s relationship.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Amid her tears, Katie holds Ridge and says he is alive. He admits yes he is alive. He pats her back. She sighs that he has been gone like forever and for him never to do that to her again. He says he is sorry, and he won't. Katie tells him not to apologize. He's here, he's alive and well and he's beautiful. She has been so worried. Eric asks if Ridge can tell them where he has been. Slowly he says someone found him, took him in and now he is here. He is sorry he put them through this. Katie says again not to apologize. He has been in a freak accident and they will investigate it as soon as they get home as she knows he wants to get home. He says yes. Eric tells Brooke there is something a little off about Ridge. He's not really present and they perhaps should be worried. But they are going to find out. He's called a doctor and he's on the way. Aly asks Rick if they know why Hope called this emergency meeting. No one knows. Pam says the suspense is killing her and it must be about Ridge. Finally Hope comes in and says she has news. Ridge has been found alive. They all cheer that Ridge is okay. Carter tells Maya that she has to stop eyeballing Oliver. She asks if it is obvious. He says yes. She says she can't help it; alarm bells are going off. Carter says with Ridge's situation this is not the time. Justin meets with Bill and asks if there is any word. Bill says no. Justin says this is not good. Every minute that goes by his chances of survival gets worse. Bill replies that he doesn't know how in the hell this could go so wrong. He just wanted to teach Ridge a lesson, let him go for a little swim. Justin says something that he forgot to tell Bill, and he's not going to like it. Bill says great, let's hear it. Justin says just before he got word from Bill to cool Ridge off, he thinks Ridge saw him. Bill tells Justin to never protect him at his own expense. He should have told him sooner. Justin says originally he was there just to pick up Bill and Brooke. He had no idea what was happening on the ground. Ridge had his own chopper there and he had no idea this chopper wasn't his. Then Justin got the call to cool Ridge. He was surprised to see it was Ridge but he thinks he saw the SP emblem when he boarded. He might have put it all together. Bill is not happy but he says if Ridge is dead, it might be a moot point. Ridge keeps saying he is fine and wants to go home. Eric tells him they will wait and see what the doctor says. The doctor says from what he has been able to find out, Ridge hit the water pretty hard. The fall alone could have killed him, but he survived with a severe concussion. Brooke says they deserve some answers. They have been worried for days and the hospitals were on alert. The doctor says a family found him, that father was a doctor and took care of Ridge. Eric wants to know if there will be any after affects. The doctor says some memory loss and confusion. The brain can be tricky so only time will tell. Ridge should be monitored back in the states and he will be in touch with them. He tells Ridge that he has a lot of healing to do and for him not to be under any kind of stress. Ridge says that's it, they should go home now. Katie asks if she can speak with Ridge alone. She asks if he remembers them. Hope and Liam hug that Ridge is alive when it was looking like they'd never find him. She says she was really scared and what she realized during all of this that she never told Ridge enough how grateful she was to have him in her life and how much he meant to her. Liam says yes almost losing one really opens your blinders what it would be like without them. She says she is sorry if that is how Liam felt about her, but she appreciates him even more now and will never stop telling him. Aly thanks Oliver for his support and says she would have been a basket case without him. He says if she needs him, he'll be there. It's a given. Pam says thank goodness all of this hateful waiting is over. Rick says as furious as Ridge makes him, he did not want to learn to live without him. And he will tell him that now. Pam tells Donna she knows it is corny but she feels Stephanie had something to do with Ridge being found and bringing him back to them. She'd want him to experience what he is with Katie. Bill tells Justin that no one can find out he was piloting the chopper or that he dumped Ridge out. Justin says \"we\". Just then Brooke comes in and informs them the best possible news; Ridge is alive and well. He is a little fuzzy and will have some memory loss but she is sure that will pass. Katie tells Ridge that she is sorry. That is the sort of thing he has probably been asked to avoid. He will have some confusion so all she really cares about is that he is standing there before her and that she can reach out and touch him. They had so little time together but now they will have plenty of time to pick back up where they left off. Hope tells the group to gather around. She says they are all her family and when a family goes through what they have they make vows. They make promises to be more aware and be more grateful to the people that mean the most to them. But people do fight and when that happens she hopes they will remember how they feel right now. She gushes that she feels so blessed to have them in her life. And she is so happy to have another chance to tell Ridge how much she loves him and all of them. Ridge pulls away from Katie and says he has a little boy at home that needs his dad. So he just wants to get home. Katie holds up her hand with the red ribbon and says he can not possibly know how much strength that ring gave her. She remembers when he put it on her finger .how romantic and unexpected it had been. And she's going to take a leap of faith that he will remember every minute they have shared and how they fell in love and how they have planned on spending the rest of their lives together. She hopes he will remember that too.",
