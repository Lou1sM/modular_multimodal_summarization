    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the outdoor caf\u00e9 in Abu Dhabi, Bill questioned Brooke about Ridge. Brooke said that they didn't know how much Ridge remembered or how long it would take him to recover; however, upon looking at him, no one would notice any difference in him for what he'd been through.\n\n\n\"Except that blank look in his eyes,\" Bill remarked. Brooke believed that Ridge knew who everyone was, but they needed to give him a little time and patience. Bill asked how Katie was. Brooke replied that her sister was anxious for the fog to clear and to have Ridge back to himself again. Brooke was hopeful that those things were happening right at that moment.\n\n\nIn the hotel suite, Ridge seemed a little startled when Katie kissed him on the lips. She asked him to say that he remembered her and that he remembered them. Brooke and Bill arrived, and Brooke asked if everything was okay. Katie said everything was fine; she just needed to know that Ridge remembered. She asked him again if he remembered.\n\n\nBill advised Katie not to press. Staring widely, Ridge asserted that he didn't have amnesia; he just had some fuzziness on things. Thorne strode in, saying that a concussion could do that, but Ridge had a hard head. Thorne hugged Ridge tightly. Ridge pushed Thorne back quickly but then recognized his \"pesky little brother who's always been jealous\" of him.\n\n\nThorne and Ridge bantered a bit, which was music to Eric's ears. Eric asked what Ridge remembered about the helicopter. \"Helicopter?\" Ridge asked, and Bill clenched his jaw. Katie and Brooke explained to Ridge what had happened on the beach, leading up to the fall. Bill figured that everything after the fall was sketchy for Ridge, but Ridge replied that not everything was.\n\n\nRidge became disconcerted when the group continued to question him, but Eric told Ridge to take his time, and everything would return to focus eventually. Eric and Thorne left to make preparations for the flight home, and Katie said that R.J., Ridge's son with Brooke, would be happy to see Ridge. Ridge replied that he remembered his son. \"Do you remember me?\" Katie asked again.\n\n\n\"Of course I remember you, Katie. You're Brooke's sister,\" Ridge answered. Brooke reminded Katie that the doctor had said that Ridge needed to take it easy, but Bill insisted that \"Forrester\" had to remember Katie. Katie stammered that she needed to talk to Ridge alone -- again.\n\n\nBrooke led Bill into another part of the suite. She sighed, and he stroked her shoulders from behind. He asked her to tell him what she was thinking. \"Like I don't already know,\" he murmured. Brooke said that Katie needed Ridge to say he remembered their relationship, but he didn't seem to. \"And you can't help wondering what it means,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nBack in the parlor, Katie sat down with Ridge. She stroked his hair and asked him close his eyes and relax. She was sure it would all return to him. He put his head on her shoulder and closed his eyes.\n\n\nAfter a few moments, Ridge hopped up from his seat. Agitated, he said he was sorry, but he didn't remember. Katie claimed that it was okay, and they had plenty of time. She was sure he'd remember walking and dancing in the park, their children together, and their poem. She said that they'd been a wondrous and unexpected thing, because neither of them had seen it coming.\n\n\nLaughing and joking, Katie stated that Ridge was fuzzy on how things had happened, but she wanted him to know that he'd pursued her. Ridge chuckled. She said that the moment he'd tied the string on her finger, she knew they'd be together forever, and she wouldn't believe otherwise.\n\n\nHugging Ridge, Katie quoted from their poem, ending with, \"What is this sweet work worth...\" \"If thou kiss not me...\" Ridge said and deeply kissed Katie.\n\n\nAt the Bikini Bar, the bartender was surprised that Deacon had returned \"so soon.\" Deacon responded that he was meeting someone, and the bartender guessed it was the beautiful brunette from earlier. Quinn rushed in, ordered a drink, and asked if Deacon had gotten her text message. Deacon replied that he'd understood to meet her there, \"but an update?\"\n\n\nQuinn asked if Deacon had seen Hope. Deacon said he'd seen his daughter, and he also had news. He started discussing who'd pay for drinks, and Quinn ordered him to stop stringing her along about the news. He asked if she'd spank him like the bad boy he'd been before. Deacon announced the Ridge had been found, and it was apparently hard to keep a good dressmaker down.\n\n\nQuinn tried to contain her inner sense of triumph and asked if Deacon was putting her on because he needed friends in town. Deacon quipped that the only person he needed was his daughter, and that was whom he'd been with when Brooke had called to say that Ridge was okay. Smiling, Quinn said that everyone might stop persecuting her and her son.\n\n\nDeacon assumed that \"everyone\" included Hope. Quinn agreed but blamed it on the tofu-eating boyfriend who was filling Hope's head with lies. \"That is all going to change with the help of a certain someone,\" Quinn declared, grinning at Deacon.\n\n\nDeacon asserted that he wasn't in town to interfere with Hope's love life. Quinn asked if Deacon wanted Hope to be happy -- because Wyatt could do that, but Liam had only caused Hope grief. \"And yet she dumped your son for him,\" Deacon quipped. Quinn claimed that she'd messed up, not Wyatt, and Deacon would help her fix it. \"Like hell,\" he retorted and tossed back his drink.\n\n\nQuinn called Wyatt but got no answer. Deacon said she could have left a message, but she refused to miss the chance reach out to Wyatt with the news. Deacon wasn't sure the news would change things between her and Wyatt, but she said she had to try because Wyatt was her life. \"Yeah, you know, about that...\" Deacon started.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Quinn understood that no man Wyatt's age wanted a clingy mother. Quinn claimed that she hovered, not clung, and Liam had been the problem, not her. Deacon sarcastically agreed, adding that Liam had been responsible for Quinn's selfie creation and delivery to Ridge. She said the point was that Ridge's being alive would change things with Hope.\n\n\nDeacon guessed Quinn expected Hope to let Quinn and the wonderful Wyatt off the hook. Quinn declared that Wyatt was wonderful -- the kind of man any father would want for his daughter. Quinn predicted that, once things settled down, Hope would let the Fullers back into the company, and even if Quinn couldn't get back in, Hope would return to Wyatt. Deacon called it wishful thinking.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Hope, Rick, Caroline, Aly, Oliver, Pam, Carter, and Maya gathered together. Hope noted that Donna was with R.J. Liam told everyone that Eric had called Hope to say that he'd be home with Ridge the following day, and Pam exclaimed that they had a party to plan. Concerned if Ridge was in good shape, Carter asked Hope if there was anything she needed to tell them.\n\n\nHope relayed that Ridge had suffered a concussion and some memory loss. He knew his loved ones but was having difficulty remembering details. Hope believed that being around loved ones and familiar surroundings would help him heal. Aly asked if he'd still be the Ridge they knew and loved.\n\n\nHope was sure Ridge would be the same, and Liam added that the fuzziness might clear up before Ridge arrived home. Caroline and Rick added that they'd be supportive of Ridge either way.\n\n\nThe group shifted into party mode, and Hope grabbed a pen and pad to make a list of things to do. She was hopeful that Ridge being among family and friends would jog his memory.\n\n\nCaroline offered to bake cookies for her half-brother-in-law, and Maya became amazed that Caroline baked. Caroline said she was more than a pretty face. Caroline claimed to have a domestic side. Becoming tearful, Caroline said that, even if she didn't, she'd give it the old diva try for Ridge.\n\n\nAly wanted to hug Ridge and never let go. Oliver advised everyone to take Ridge's lead in case too much of a good thing wasn't good for Ridge. \"Including Caroline's cookies,\" Carter quipped.\n\n\nAside, Liam noticed that Hope hadn't stopped smiling ever since they'd learned about Ridge. She asked if Liam believed in miracles, and he said that Ridge's survival had been pretty miraculous. \"I think we're miraculous, too,\" she uttered in a cutesy voice and hugged him. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Katie is extremely worried that she will never have the fairytale life with Ridge that she had hoped for. Quinn is pleased to learn that she seems to be off the hook for at least one of her accused transgressions. The group at Forrester Creations plan for a bittersweet homecoming of those returning from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Bill anxiously awaits with anticipation to learn whether or not his involvement in Ridge\u2019s accident has been discovered.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie tells Ridge it's her, please remember her. Tell her that he remembers \"us\". Bill asks Brooke about Ridge. She says he is with Katie now. But the doctors said it is amazing that he even survived the fall. Bill wants to know how long it will be before he recovers. Brooke doesn't know but says he seems to be okay. Bill says except for that blank look in his eyes. Brooke says they just need to give him time. He does know who they are but they will have to be patient. Katie knows he is in a fog but she is hoping that will clear and he will be his old self again. Deacon returns to The Bikini and the bartender is asks him about the stunning brunette a real piece of work. Suddenly Quinn walks in and tells the bartender they will both have a Kamikaze. Deacon says he got the text to meet her here but he is not sure what she means about a status report. She asks if he has seen Hope yet. He says not only has he seen her but he's got news if she is buying. She accuses him of being a player and liking to stir the pot, so tell her before .he says before she spanks him like the bad boy he used to be. Okay, he say it's hard to keep a good dressmaker down. Ridge has been found. Liam tells the group that Eric called Hope and looks like they are going to try to bring Ridge home tomorrow. Pam says that is why they are trying to rally the troops to have a big celebration. Hope says Ridge is okay and he will remember them but he has problems remembering certain things. He will be the same Ridge they know and love but he may be a bit fuzzy on some things. Rick says they will be supportive but meantime they have a party to plan. They have banners to make and food to bake and music so they all pitch in to help. Hope tells Liam that Pam lives for this. He says he lives for that smile on her face. Ridge surviving was nothing short of a miracle and he thinks they are pretty miraculous too. Quinn asks Deacon if he is sure about Ridge. He scoffs that he would lie to her about this. She says well he might if it benefited him. This makes him her friend and not her enemy. He calls her honey and says get this straight. The only person he needs in this town is his daughter, Hope, and that is exactly where he was when she got the phone call from Brooke. He says she looks relieved. She says maybe now people will stop persecuting her .and also her son. And especially his daughter. But she is not holding that against Hope. It's that tofu-eating boyfriend of hers that is filling her head with lies. But all of that is gonna change with the help of a certain someone. Bill tells Katie that the mind is a tricky thing and she shouldn't press. She says she's not, she is only trying to help. Ridge says he does not have amnesia but he is fuzzy on a few things. Thorne quips that a severe concussions can do that but with Ridge's hard head who knows. Ridge says his pesky little brother. Thorne adds and who is always jealous of him. He got the good looks and the brain. Eric says this is music to the ears as it means things are getting back to normal. He wants to know what Ridge can tell him about the helicopter. Bill asks if things are sketchy for him. Thorne asks if anything happened that caused the pilot to bank the chopper. Eric tells him to take his time. It will all come back eventually. Thorne says they need to get him home so he and Eric will talk to the pilots and make arrangements. Ridge says he remembers RJ and he knows Katie is Brooke's sister. Deacon tells Quinn that he did not come back to town to interfere with his daughter's love life although he admits he wants to see her happy. Quinn says Wyatt makes her happy and Liam has brought her nothing but grief. Deacon is quick to point out and yet Hope dumped Wyatt for Liam. Quinn says because she messed up, not Wyatt, and she is going to fix it. And Deacon is going to help her. He says like hell he is. And she could text Wyatt and not try to cling to him. She says she does not cling, maybe hover. But that is not what ruined the relationship between her and Hope and her and Wyatt. It was Liam spilling all his venom, it's all his fault. Deacon says yeah like Quinn took the selfie that sent Ridge halfway around the world while she stood by innocently. But now that Ridge is alive that Quinn must think that will get her off the hook with Hope and wonderful Wyatt too. Quinn says yes Wyatt is wonderful and loyal and loving, a son any father would want for his daughter. Hope is going to settle down and realize she overreacted and then bring her and Wyatt back into the company. And even if she doesn't let Quinn return, she will with Wyatt and dump Liam. It's only a matter of time. Deacon says or only a matter of time on Mama Q's part. Brooke tells Bill that Katie just needs to hear that Ridge remembers their relationship. And he doesn't seem to. Ridge tells Katie that he doesn't remember. She assures him that is okay. They have all the time in the world. He will remember walking in the park and dancing to music while the children played. And their poems; she never knew he liked poetry. And neither one of them saw it coming, but she wants him to know that he pursued her. And the minute that he tied that red ribbon on her finger she knew they'd be together forever. She is not going to believe anything else. \"And the sunlight clasps the earth, the moonbeams kiss the sea: what is all this sweet work worth .if thou kiss not me?\"",

He said he was only quipped because he was the only person in town whom he needed to tell.\n"
