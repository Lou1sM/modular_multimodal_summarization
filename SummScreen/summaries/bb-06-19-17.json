    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn was leery about going onto the balcony. Ridge told her that it was okay, but she said it would take time. She expressed that she'd meant it when she'd said she loved him, and she felt guilty about Brooke and Bill being together. Ridge said to stop it. To him, all that mattered was that Quinn was safe. She replied that it was because of him.\n\n\nRidge believed that Quinn was strong and would move past everything. She assumed that \"everything means this.\" Ridge replied that it especially meant that.\n\n\nJust then, Eric arrived. He was sorry he'd been gone, but he'd had something to handle. He was glad that Ridge and Quinn were there and announced that they had a visitor. To Quinn's surprise, Sheila entered the house. Sheila greeted Ridge, noting that he looked different. She added that she was happy to be properly introduced to Quinn.\n\n\nRidge insisted upon knowing why Eric had taken Sheila into their home. Eric said that Sheila had had a hard time of it, and she'd had nothing to do with the Deacon insanity. Eric believed that Sheila was a victim, just like his wife.\n\n\nRidge asked why Sheila was there after all she'd done to their family. Eric was aware of the past, but he felt that their judgment of Sheila had cost her a day in jail. Sheila said she didn't blame anyone for it, and she didn't expect them to believe that she'd changed -- even though she had.\n\n\nSheila regretted everything she'd done, especially to Eric's family. Though she knew it wasn't much, she still wanted them to know that she was deeply sorry. Ridge quipped that she'd apologized, so she could get out.\n\n\nSheila became standoffish. She understood Ridge's concerns and told Eric that she didn't want to be a distraction. Eric replied that his family owed Sheila an apology. \"What?\" Ridge incredulously asked. Eric said that he was just trying to be decent. He offered Sheila some tea, and she accepted. He gestured for her to have a seat in the living room.\n\n\nSheila readily noticed Quinn's portrait and called it stunning. \"The new Forrester matriarch,\" Sheila said, grinning at Quinn.\n\n\nLater, Eric set down a drink for Sheila, who said it was a lovely home. She remembered it well. Ridge sniped that he bet she did. Sheila switched the subject to what had happened to Quinn earlier. Eric was glad Ridge had been there to save Quinn. Sheila believed that Quinn was lucky to have so much goodness in her life and said the woman Sheila was becoming was largely due to Eric. \"Only I could have screwed that up. He's lucky to have someone so devoted and loyal,\" Sheila stated. Quinn thought it was nice of Sheila to say.\n\n\nTo Ridge, Sheila expressed her surprise that Brooke had married Bill Spencer. Ridge said he was fine, and Sheila need not worry about him. Sheila replied that she was sure Ridge could take care of himself, much like he'd taken care of his father's wife.\n\n\nSheila decided that all was well that ended well. She said she'd just wanted to stop in to make amends. She planned to leave town, and she gave Eric a card with her information on it in case he needed to get in touch with her. Ridge told Sheila that she should keep it.\n\n\nSheila went to the bathroom, and Ridge asked Eric what he was doing. Eric asked Ridge to just do it with him. Ridge asked what they were doing. Eric replied that he knew what Sheila was capable of, and he wanted to keep her close.\n\n\nEric stated that he'd had Sheila jailed for a crime she hadn't committed. \"That remains to be seen,\" Ridge said. Eric said Sheila was trying to turn her life around, but Ridge said she was trying to get back with the family. Ridge reminded Eric that Sheila manipulated people, and Eric said he knew.\n\n\nWhen Sheila returned from the bathroom, Ridge picked up Sheila's purse and said it was time for her to go. Eric decided to walk Sheila out, and once he and Sheila had gone, Quinn asked if Ridge's actions had been necessary. Ridge insisted that they had been. He didn't want Sheila there and said Eric was playing with fire.\n\n\nOutside by the fountain, Eric apologized. Sheila said she couldn't blame Ridge. She thanked Eric for sticking up for her. Eric replied that Ridge didn't believe that Sheila had changed. Sheila affirmed that she had and asked if Eric could see it. Eric wanted to believe anyone could if they really wanted to. She said his words meant a lot to her.\n\n\nSheila was happy that Eric had found someone like Quinn to treat him as he deserved, but if Quinn didn't, Sheila stated that she \"might bust her one.\" Eric didn't think Sheila should worry because Quinn was just about the ideal wife.\n\n\nSheila decided that she could walk herself to her car. Eric told her to take care of herself. He went inside the house, and Sheila grinned at the door.\n\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Nicole flashed back on times with Lizzy. Zende arrived and noticed that something was wrong. He figured it was the baby issue, and he reassured her that they'd have a family together. Nicole sat quietly listening. He promised it would happen. Nicole hugged Zende and said she didn't know how Maya and Rick could leave Lizzy to go to Paris like that.\n\n\nCoco arrived, and Nicole wondered if Coco had time to talk. Zende decided to get back to sketching, and he exited. Coco asked what was wrong, and Nicole replied that she might not be able to have more children. Coco was surprised. Nicole explained what the doctors had said, but Coco was hopeful, saying that nothing was definite.\n\n\nNicole confided that she was becoming judgmental of herself and others, like Rick and Maya. Nicole couldn't understand how they could leave Lizzy and go to Paris. Nicole began to get upset. She couldn't stop her feelings, and she was worried that she'd made a big mistake. Trying to dismiss her thoughts, Nicole repeatedly said that Maya and Rick were good parents. Coco agreed that they were good parents. Nicole stated that she loved Lizzy, too, and Coco didn't get it.\n\n\nCoco said that Nicole was right about Rick and Maya being good parents. Coco started to say that the business trip Rick and Maya had taken didn't mean they weren't good parents. Nicole interrupted, saying she knew it, but she couldn't help it. Nicole couldn't control all her feelings. Nicole couldn't explain what it had done to her when Lizzy had called her mama.\n\n\nNicole asked if she sounded crazy. Coco thought Nicole just had a lot going on. Nicole remarked that she hadn't told anyone about her feelings except Coco, and Coco promised that nothing Nicole said would leave the room. Nicole wished there was another solution, and she feared that Lizzy was her only shot at motherhood.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick and Maya were with Lizzy. Rick explained that there was an issue with the adoption papers. He said it was a clerical error, and they simply needed to sign the papers again. Maya was ready to do it, but Rick said they also needed Nicole's signature. Maya decided to take the paperwork to Nicole. Rick asked if he could help, but Maya replied that she needed a private moment with her sister.\n\n\nLater, Rick looked at some sketches that Zende showed off. Rick thought he saw real growth, but because he was no designer, he said Zende should leave the sketches for Steffy and Ridge to review. Zende asked if Maya was around, and Rick remarked that Maya was getting some new adoption signatures from Nicole. Zende said he'd thought it had been finalized already.\n\n\nRick stated that it was just a re-signing due to clerical errors, and after Maya explained it to Nicole, they'd get Nicole to sign. Zende asked what kind of errors. Rick described them as typos, nothing relevant. Rick said they'd get Nicole to sign and be done with it.\n\n\nBack in the design office, Maya arrived, and Coco welcomed Maya back. Maya thanked Coco and asked for a few minutes alone with Nicole. Coco left, and Nicole asked what was going on. Maya casually explained that Carter had dropped off some paperwork, and they just needed a few signatures. Nicole asked what kind of paperwork, and Maya replied that it was for the adoption. Nicole stated that she thought it had been finalized a while back.\n\n\nMaya said they'd all thought so, but some clerical errors had led Carter to draw up a new set of papers. Nicole repeated that she'd thought it had been finalized. Maya replied that it was final between them, and once Nicole signed, it would be legal. \"So Lizzy's not yours?\" Nicole asked.\n\n\nMaya replied that Lizzy was Maya's. \"Maybe not legally. It's not a big deal,\" Maya decided. She showed Nicole that it was the same document with the same terms, so there was nothing to be concerned about. Maya handed Nicole a pen. Nicole gasped. \"Oh, my God. You mean that I'm her mother?\" Nicole asked.\n\n\n\"No, Nicole. I am Lizzy's mother. Just please. Please sign the papers,\" Maya said. Nicole stated that she couldn't do it. She said it could be a sign, and it had to be happening for a reason. Maya said it wasn't so. Maya asserted that she was Lizzy's mother, and Rick was the father. Maya ordered Nicole to sign the papers at that moment.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Quinn and Ridge reflect on the recent events. Before they touch the issue of their feelings for another, Eric enters and introduces his guest: Sheila. Sheila apologizes for past actions whereas Eric states regret for accusing her of being Quinn's alleged shooter. Ridge is stunned that Eric invited the ruthless and manipulative Mrs. Carter into his home and is not nearly as willing to let bygones be bygones. After Ridge confronts his father in a private moment, Eric shuts him down claiming it is better to keep Sheila close than to stir her up. Sheila then excuses herself and wishes Eric all the best in his marriage as she considers him still very dear to her heart. Despite Zende's reassurance, Nicole confides in Coco that the news that she might be unable to carry further children makes her question her decision to give up Lizzy. Rick gives Maya the new adoption papers that Carter has drawn up. When Maya presents those documents to Nicole her sister's reaction makes her worst nightmare come true.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Quinn that Deacon is in jail so she is safe now. She says yes thanks to him. And she meant it when she said she loves him. He says she is safe so that is all that matters. Nicole remembers back when little Lizzy was born and put in her arms. Zende walks in and asks if she is okay. She replies yes she is just fine. He senses she is still down and says they have only been trying a few months but it is going to happen. The doctors did not say it was impossible. He assures her everything will turn out, he promises. Rick informs Maya that it is no big deal but there is some clerical error and they need to sign more adoption papers for Lizzy. Maya says it is a sensitive time now for Nicole so she will take the papers in to her privately. Nicole conveys to Coco that she is afraid \u0096 she might not be able to have more children. She says she could not stand it when Maya and Rick took off to Paris and left Lizzy. She would never do that. Maybe she made a mistake giving the child to them. Eric comes in and is glad both Ridge and Quinn are there. He tells them they have a visitor and invites Sheila in. Sheila says hello to Ridge and says he looks different. He asks his dad why this woman is here after all she has done to this family. Eric says they were all judging Sheila by her past and she had nothing to do with what Deacon did. She says she regrets all of it and she is deeply sorry. Ridge says okay she said her peace and now she can get out. Sheila starts to leave and laments that she does not want to be a distraction. Eric says she is being treated unfairly and it is them that should be apologizing to her. He offers her a glass of tea and goes to get it.

She just wanted to come by and make amends. When she leaves the room Ridge says now she can leave. Eric says no, he wants to keep an eye on her and keep her close. Ridge says this is wrong as Sheila manipulates people. Eric reminds him that they put Sheila in jail and that was wrong. Ridge tells Quinn that he does not want Sheila here; Eric is playing with fire. Sheila thanks Eric and says his words mean a lot. He says anyone can change if they want to and he believes she has. They say goodbye outside and he tells her to take care of herself. She gives a backward sly look. When the papers are presented to Nicole she tells Maya that she thought that was finalized a long time ago. She wants Maya to explain \u0096 Lizzy is not really hers yet. Maya says she will be as soon as Nicole re-signs these papers. She is not Lizzy's mother; Maya is so please sign the papers. Nicole hears Lizzy cry and suddenly says she can't .she cannot sign the papers. Maya gets agitated and clenches her jaw and says she is the mother and Rick the father so Nicole must sign those papers right now!",
