Rick explained to Zende that there had been a problem with Lizzy's adoption papers, and they needed to get it taken care of in order to finalize the adoption. Zende looked concerned. Rick tried to convince him that it wasn't a big deal. All they needed was Nicole's signature. Zende looked even more uncomfortable. Rick noted that sometime soon, Nicole would give him the same gift of a child that she had given to Rick and Maya. Zende agreed.\n\n\nIn the hallway at Forrester, Carter was on the phone, and Julius entered. Carter paused his phone call to greet Julius, who said he was looking for Nicole. Carter said that she was with Maya -- they had to take care of signing some legal papers. Julius looked concerned. Carter paused again.\n\n\nJulius asked what legal matter had taken place that needed attention from his daughters. Carter said it was nothing to worry about. There had been some clerical errors with Lizzy's adoption, but it would be cleared up in no time. Carter excused himself and said he needed to finish his call. Julius thanked him and left.\n\n\nIn Nicole's office, Maya pressured Nicole to sign the adoption papers. Maya was impatient, and Nicole flashed back to hugging and holding Lizzy. Nicole said she didn't know what to do. Maya didn't understand Nicole's issues. Nicole said she needed more time. Maya countered that it was a formality. \"Lizzy is my daughter. Sign the papers,\" Maya demanded.\n\n\nNicole looked nervous. \"Why is there suddenly a problem? I thought it was finalized and legal,\" Nicole said. Maya explained that there had been some errors, and Nicole just needed to sign off on it. Nicole stammered that she had thought it had all been done. She continued to question why it had happened. Maya grew concerned and noted that Nicole wasn't making any sense. Maya softened and asked, \"What's going on here?\"\n\n\nNicole was visibly shaken. \"While you were in Paris, I spent all that time with Lizzy. She is the best, sweetest little girl, and I love her so much. The way that she looks at me, and the way that she feels in my arms...\"\n\n\nMaya interrupted. \"Nicole, what exactly are you saying?\" Maya asked. Maya acknowledged that Nicole had been going through a tough time, but Maya maintained it had nothing to do with Lizzy. \"Rick and I are her parents, and we have been since conception,\" Maya said.\n\n\nNicole said she understood, but she had so many feelings that she didn't know what to trust anymore. She promised that she wanted to be a good person and do the right thing. \"I'm sorry. I can't sign those papers right now,\" Nicole said.\n\n\nMaya looked horrified, but she tried to maintain a calm demeanor. She stammered that she was sorry it was so difficult, and she promised to leave the papers. However, she added that she wanted to get it taken care of and settled. \"Please don't take too long,\" Maya begged. Maya was clearly concerned as she left.\n\n\nLater, Julius entered and wanted to take Nicole to lunch. Nicole declined. She said she wasn't hungry. Julius was concerned and said he knew she was upset, and he knew it had something to do with Maya. Nicole asked why he would say that.\n\n\nJulius said he had seen Carter in the hallway. Julius said he understood there were some clerical glitches with the paperwork. Nicole said everyone had to sign off on it because it wasn't legally valid. It was just a formality. \"Is it?\" Julius asked. Nicole was shaken.\n\n\nJulius worried that his daughter didn't want to give up her own daughter. Nicole tearfully said that everyone had told her she would eventually have another baby, but she worried it would never happen. She had given the only baby she might ever have to Maya and Rick.\n\n\nNicole explained that she wanted to keep Lizzy with her all the time. She had feelings that didn't make any sense. Julius said they did make sense because Lizzy was her daughter. Maya hadn't carried her for nine months. \"Do you think it's a coincidence that this happened?\" Julius asked. He wondered if it wasn't meant to be because he recognized that bond between mother and child because he had seen it with his wife and their children.\n\n\n\"Lizzy knows you're her mother, and this is happening for a reason,\" he said. He maintained that the adoption was not as official as everyone thought it was. \"Don't sign those papers, Nicole. Don't do it!\" he said.\n\n\nZende entered Coco's office, and Coco said she was worried about Nicole. Zende said they were going through a lot. Coco hoped that everything with the possible infertility would work out, but she expressed concern because Nicole had confided in her. She didn't want to betray any trust. \"What's going on?\" Zende asked.\n\n\nCoco related that she had been really worried about Nicole's relationship with Rick and Maya's daughter. Zende understood, and he appreciated that Coco had been a good friend to Nicole. He added that the infertility issue was difficult to deal with because Nicole had always been so controlled. However, when she met with doctors, her feelings and emotions had been all over the place. He worried that she'd had to relive Lizzy's adoption because of some clerical mistakes. He promised they would all be there for Nicole and get her through it. Coco agreed.\n\n\nMaya entered Rick's office, and he was on the phone. After he'd hung up, Maya disclosed that she was upset about the adoption papers and that Nicole had refused to sign them. Rick was concerned.\n\n\nMaya explained that Nicole had been upset and said she need time to process the whole thing. Maya said she had pressured Nicole at first because Lizzy was their daughter, but she realized they couldn't put Nicole under any additional stress because she was clearly emotional. Maya said they had to be sensitive because of Nicole's situation dealing with possible infertility. Rick was angry, \"This is our legal right to our child,\" he said. He angrily said he was \"going to get those papers signed.\"\n\n\nIn Nicole's office, she looked at the legal papers, and Rick entered. He ordered her to sign them. He noted that she had \"scared the hell\" out of Maya. \"This is not a game,\" he shouted.\n\n\nRick calmed down and reminded Nicole that he and Maya had been Lizzy's parents from day one. They made her feel safe and secure. They were her world, and she was their world. He wondered if Nicole had thought about that.\n\n\nNicole reminded Rick that she had carried Lizzy for nine months and had felt her growing and kicking inside of her. Nicole worried that she might never be able to have another child. Rick tried to calm her and said he understood she was going through a lot of scary tests.\n\n\nRick noted that she and Zende might have fertility issues, but they might not. It could take time, and there were always miracles. \"No matter what the outcome, we are going to be there for you because we are all family,\" Rick said.\n\n\nNicole needed time. Rick grew more irritated. He reminded Nicole that she had to understand that he and Maya were Lizzy's parents. \"Do the right thing. Sign these papers. Don't you understand the sun sets and rises around Lizzy? Taking her away from me is never gonna happen. Not gonna happen!\" Rick shouted.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Rick reassures Zende that he will have a child with Nicole eventually. Across the hall, a stunned Maya does not quite understand why Nicole is asking for more time before signing the adoption papers. When Carter mentions to Julius that there was a glitch with Lizzy's adoption, Julius' wheels begin to turn. He encourages Nicole to embrace her inner feelings that the little girl is actually her daughter. Coco confides in Zende her concern that Nicole is emotionally distraught by her medical diagnosis. After Maya has filled Rick in on her conversation with Nicole, he runs straight to his sister-in-law to confront her. In no minced words Rick makes it clear that Lizzy is his child - and that he will not let Nicole take her away from him. Nicole is visibly shaken by the harshness of Rick's exclamation.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick explains to Zende that it is just a formality that Nicole needs to sign new papers for the adoption. He knows they have been trying to have their own child, and it may take time but Nicole will give him that child. Nicole tells Maya that she cannot sign; she needs more time. Maya does not understand. Lizzy is her daughter so just sign the papers. Nicole said she thought this was all done. But the entire time Maya was in Paris all she thought about was Lizzy and taking care of her the way she feels in her arms. Maya says they need to dial back. She knows Nicole wants her own child but this has nothing to do with this adoption. Nicole says she has so many thoughts in her head right now and she wants to do the right thing but right now she needs more time. Maya backs off and says okay she will give her that time but please do not wait too long. Julius runs into Carter at Forrester Creations while looking for Nicole. Carter says he just got there but Nicole may be in with Maya. They have some legal papers to sign. Carter tells him there is nothing to worry about .just some T's to be crossed. Coco tells Zende that she had a conversation with Nicole and she is a little worried about her with Maya's baby. Nicole now thinks giving up Lizzy may have been a mistake. Zende says he understands. Now there is some clerical error and she will be going through all of this again. But he's the rock and they will get through this. She will not go through this alone. Maya returns to Rick and has to relay to him that she does not have the papers Nicole was to sign. Nicole is going through a rough time right now; she just could not sign them now. Nicole turns down Julius's offer to go to lunch. She's not hungry. He knows there is some glitz in the adoption papers which she says is just a formality. Julius questions if it is really. He says he can see her struggling and he just wants to be there to help. Nicole admits she was happy. She was married to Zende and was an aunt to Lizzy but then the doctors told her that she may not have her own child and that changed everything. She did not like that Maya left Lizzy while in Paris. Julius says that is normal for her because she is Lizzy's mother. And now the documents are not even legal. That may have happened for a reason. There is a bond there and children do know who their mother is. Lizzy knows that Nicole is her mother. Rick says there should be no question for Nicole or for her to refuse to sign the papers. He is going to find her now and get those papers signed. Julius tells Nicole this is nature trying to make things right \u0096 do not sign those papers. Zende tells Coco that he appreciates her confiding in him and he will not tell Nicole. The last thing Nicole needs now is pressure. Rick walks in on Nicole and tells her to sign the papers. She scared the hell out of his wife. Nicole says he does not know how it felt to carry her for mine months and then to find out now she might not have another child. Rick says she still may be able to have her own child as miracles happen. But no matter what she is going through right now has zero to do with Lizzy. He loves that girl like the sun rises and shines and she is not going to take that from then. That is not going to happen!",
