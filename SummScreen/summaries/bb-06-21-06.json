Brooke refused to let him scold her about kissing Ridge, telling him that it had been a brilliant publicity stunt. Stephen felt that Ridge had taken advantage of her once again. Brooke did not want to listen to her father and asked him to leave. Not deterred, Stephen played psychologist, telling Brooke she had been searching her whole life to find someone who would make her feel safe and warned her that Ridge was not that someone. \n\n\nBrooke thought her dad's grudge with the Forresters stemmed from the fact that her mom had just married him because she could not have Eric Forrester. She told her dad she was not going to fight his battles for him. Stephen told Brooke he was not asking her to fight his battles. He just wanted her to get off the fence and not risk losing Nick. Stephen wanted Brooke to understand how insensitive she had been to Nick's feelings when she had allowed Ridge to kiss her on stage. \n\n\nBrooke thought Stephen was being a hypocrite, since he had just played musical beds with Taylor and Jackie. Stephen told Brooke she was better than he was and deserved a better life. He warned her that she would not have a better life if she stayed addicted to Ridge. Brooke argued that she was not addicted to Ridge; she just wanted to run Forrester, and it was a family company. Brooke became bitter toward her dad again, about how he had left her when she had been a little girl. Stephen told her there was no way he could have stayed when he had known her mother had wanted another man. He asked Brooke if that was how she wanted to make Nick feel. \n\n\nStephen told Brooke that he wanted so much for her because he had given her so little. He thought with Nick she had more of a chance for being happy than she'd ever had in her life, and he did not want to see her blow it. Brooke softened toward her dad when she realized the truth in what he was saying to her. He told her that he had gone there to make amends and say goodbye because he was heading back to Paris. Before he left, Brooke told him she loved him.\n\n\nIn the showroom at Forrester, Felicia anticipated her wedding and remembered how Dante had proposed to her. She feared that Dante's heart might still belong to Bridget. Darla and Thorne entered and told her she was going to make a beautiful bride. Bridget showed up with the dress and was afraid that Felicia would not like Eric's garish design; however, Felicia loved it. Felicia was up-front with Bridget and asked if Bridget had any second thoughts about giving Dante up. Felicia wanted to make sure that Dante was not having second thoughts either. \n\n\nBridget dodged Felicia's questions and denied she had any feelings for Dante. Not buying her lies, Felicia told Bridget not to treat her like an idiot and to just be honest with her. Bridget admitted that Dante had been there for her when she had lost Nick and had helped her get through one of the hardest times of her life. She acted like that was all there was to it and pretended to be very happy that Felicia was getting to marry Dante. \n\n\nStill unconvinced, Felicia said she was no charity case. Bridget told Felicia she was an amazing woman, and she did not want anything to ever get between them. They told each other how much they loved each other and hugged.\n\n\nMeanwhile in his studio at Forrester, Dante sadly dressed for his wedding as he remembered special moments he had shared with Bridget. His father arrived to check on him and kidded him about having cold feet. He told Dante that Felicia was a wonderful woman, and Dante admitted that he loved her but confided to his father that he was in love with Bridget. Dante's father was shocked. Dante explained that his love for Bridget had been the reason he had moved to Los Angeles in the first place. \n\n\nDante told his father that he had originally proposed to Bridget, but she had turned him down, but since he had gotten engaged to her sister, Bridget had realized that she loved him. Dante's father admitted that he'd had a similar experience in the past but told his son that family should always be first. He felt that Dante should be with the mother of his child. Dante could tell that his dad still thought about the love that he had lost. He told his dad he had to talk to Bridget and see if he could change her mind. \n\n\nBack in the showroom, the wedding was about to begin as Dante's friends and family gathered. Felicia, dressed like the black widow, spotted Christian and thanked him for being there. He teased her about her avant-garde wedding gown. After Felicia hugged Christian, Darla handed her the black bouquets for her and Bridget. Felicia went to find Bridget.\n \n\n\nIn Eric's office, Bridget changed into her black dress for the wedding. Once she was dressed, Dante entered and tried to convince her to be with him. Bridget was adamant about not hurting Felicia and told Dante to leave her alone. Bridget regretted telling Dante she had ever loved him. She told him that Felicia was already suspicious. \n\n\nBridget did not want anything to get between her and Felicia, and she told Dante they were over. Dante thought Felicia would be okay with it, but Bridget said Felicia really believed he loved her. Dante said Felicia was the mother of his son, but Bridget was his love and the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. As he pulled her closer, Bridget begged him to stop, unable to resist her feelings. Felicia walked in and found them kissing passionately. \n\n\n",
