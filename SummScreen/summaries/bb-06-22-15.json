Quinn grinned and sneaked off.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Ivy had something to tell Liam, but Quinn arrived, saying she just happened to be in the area. Liam found it hard to believe. He recalled that Quinn knew about everything going on with Ivy and him. Quinn quipped that ministers and wedding dresses didn't just show up from nowhere.\n\n\nQuinn was impressed with Liam for rescuing Ivy once again. Grinning, Quinn called him a rescue ranger and said it showed how much he loved Ivy. Quinn was glad to have helped by sending Carter.\n\n\nLiam received a message and told the women it was from Forrester. Ivy said he could leave to take care of it, and she'd talk to him later. Liam grimaced at the smiling Quinn, and he left.\n\n\nIvy told Quinn that she couldn't get deported. Quinn asked if Ivy was glad she'd listened to Quinn about marrying Liam. Ivy elaborated that she didn't need to be married to Liam.\n\n\nLater, Quinn asked if she had it straight that Liam had professed his love for Steffy in front of Ivy and had lost Steffy, and then he'd agreed to make his marriage with Ivy work. Ivy said that, next, Immigration had arrived to inform her that she really did have dual citizenship. Quinn assumed that she'd interrupted Ivy from telling Liam. Quinn said that telling him was the last thing Ivy should do.\n\n\nQuinn showed Ivy a stunning bracelet, and Quinn said it was Ivy's wedding present. Ivy said her marriage wasn't real, and Liam was only married to her to keep her from being deported. Quinn asked if Ivy loved him, and Ivy stated that he loved Steffy.\n\n\nQuinn asked what would happen if the agent returned and said, \"'Whoops! I made another mistake!'\" She noted that Ivy had the life she'd always wanted, and Ivy shouldn't screw it up. Quinn believed that Liam needed saving from himself. He'd been with Steffy many times; it hadn't worked out before, and it wouldn't work out again.\n\n\nQuinn pronounced that Ivy was Mrs. Liam Spencer. Ivy stated that she might be Mrs. Spencer at the moment. \"Give that back,\" Quinn interrupted and took back the bracelet. Ivy insisted that Liam had to know about the new development because he had feelings for Steffy. Quinn told Ivy that Liam had had feelings for her before Steffy had returned, and Ivy couldn't just hand him over.\n\n\nQuinn decided to hand the bracelet to Ivy. \"The next time I ask for it back, you say...?\" Smiling, Ivy replied, \"'No. It's mine.'\" Quinn believed that Ivy could have it all -- if Ivy didn't say a word to Liam.\n\n\nIn the Forrester's CEO office, Steffy blazed in, still in shock about Liam's marriage. She figured it would take years to solve, and knowing Liam, he'd try to make the marriage work. Wyatt knew Liam, too, and said that if Liam felt the way that Steffy did, Liam wouldn't have married Ivy at all. Wyatt said it was hard to hear, but Liam had fallen for someone else in Steffy's absence.\n\n\nSteffy revealed that Liam had said the marriage wasn't real, and he wanted to make it work with her; however, she refused to go down that road again. Wyatt stated that there were other avenues, and she needed to get a new map. Wyatt hugged Steffy, and from the doorway, Liam called her name.\n\n\nLiam entered and said he needed to talk to Steffy alone. Wyatt said Liam had no right, but Liam replied, \"Don't.\" Wyatt left, and Steffy asked what Liam wanted from her. Liam didn't know, and he was really confused; however, he wanted to tell her that Ivy had asked to make the marriage work.\n\n\nSteffy got upset, and Liam asserted that he'd only agreed because Steffy had walked away. Steffy insisted that she'd returned and had made it clear that she'd wanted him but wouldn't share him. He claimed that the marriage had been for show, but she responded that he'd just told her that he was going to make it work. Liam asked Steffy to say he'd made a mistake in agreeing to it.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Liam loved Ivy. Liam said nothing. \"That's what I thought,\" Steffy said. Liam insisted that he loved Steffy, and he'd spent a long time lying to himself. He claimed that it had taken the false marriage and the threat of losing Steffy to realize it. He still cared for Ivy. He didn't want to hurt Ivy, but if there was a chance, he couldn't lose Steffy again.\n\n\n\"You already did,\" Steffy responded. In her view, the marriage never should have happened in the first place if he'd really wanted her instead of Ivy. Liam claimed he didn't want to turn it around on Steffy, but the truth was that Steffy had walked out on him at a painful and difficult time for them. He'd been devastated, and he'd had to swallow all those feelings down to move on.\n\n\nSteffy called it \"mission accomplished.\" Liam said it had been accomplished until Steffy had returned. He asked how he could deny who they were together. Liam said he'd told Ivy he'd make the marriage work, but he didn't know \"what the hell\" he was doing. He believed they could fix it somehow. Steffy said that she wanted to believe him, but it was the same situation, different girl.\n\n\nSteffy said she couldn't do it, and the married Liam shouldn't even be there. Liam asked her to give him a sign. Steffy told him that he could only tear up marriage papers so many times, and she ordered him to go home to his wife. Liam walked out, and Steffy gasped, trying to control her emotions.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie and Bill discussed how he never got blindsided. Katie blindsided him with a kiss and said if he'd consulted her, no one would have punched him in the mouth at Forrester. He showed her a contract, and she cooed that he did listen to her. Bill said he valued her insight, and they kissed. \n\n\nBill got on the phone and told someone that he wanted Liam to do it. Katie asked what the call had been about, and Bill explained that he wanted Liam to do a sit-down, exclusive with Steffy about returning to Forrester. Bill wanted the interview to include wine and steak, and Katie asked if he was playing matchmaker again. Bill replied that she sounded like Wyatt, who had an interest in Steffy.\n\n\n\"Seriously? Really?\" Katie whined. Bill relayed that he'd told Wyatt that Wyatt was setting himself up for heartbreak. Bill asked Katie if she agreed that things had a way of working themselves out the second time around, but Katie insisted that Liam was committed to Ivy.\n\n\nBill and Katie called Wyatt on speakerphone. Bill offered to let his son use the jet for a date. Wyatt said he didn't have a date, but his brother had a new wife. Bill and Katie gasped in disbelief, and Wyatt explained how Liam had wound up married to Ivy due to an immigration problem. Wyatt wished that he could see the looks on Katie and Bill's faces. Wyatt ended the call so he could go back to picking up the pieces for Steffy, and Katie asked Bill, \"How's that for being blindsided?\"\n\n\nBill tried to call Liam but got no answer. \"Oh, any chance to jump into a phone booth, put on his little cap,\" Bill ranted. Katie exclaimed that it was a big step, but Bill snapped that she'd just said the couple was into each other. She corrected that she'd meant dating, not marriage. Katie called Liam impulsive. Bill stated that Liam wouldn't be married if he didn't have to be -- not with Steffy around.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, Wyatt returned to checking on Steffy. Steffy told him that Liam had said the marriage wasn't real. Steffy just wanted Liam to be happy, and it was obvious to her that he wasn't. Steffy didn't want to compete for Liam, and Wyatt said she shouldn't have to. She thanked Wyatt for getting it. She refused to share Liam with anyone -- especially not his wife.\n\n\nBack at the cliff house, Liam returned. Ivy asked if he'd seen Steffy at Forrester, and he replied that he had. He recalled that she'd been about to tell him what McCafferty had wanted earlier. Ivy looked distressed and recalled Quinn telling her to keep quiet and not screw it up.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt holds Steffy and she says do not say he is sorry. He says he is not sorry that he kissed her. Quinn spies on them. Steffy can not believe that Liam married Ivy. Wyatt says it is only a ploy to keep her in the country. Steffy says knowing how Liam is he will try to make the marriage work and that could take years. Liam asks Ivy what did the immigration officer want. Before she answers Quinn knocks on the door and says she was in neighborhood and needed Ivy's advise. She tells Liam that she is impressed with him, a regular thing, he stepped up and rescued Ivy again. And she is glad she could help in some small way with Carter. Liam gets a call from FC and has to go. Ivy tells him to go, she will see him later. Ivy confesses to Quinn that she doesn't have to be married to Liam or be deported now. Turns out she was right all along, she does have dual citizenship. Ivy says Liam needs to know the truth. Quinn says that is the last thing she needs to tell Liam. Katie kisses Bill and he laments that she should know by now that Bill does not get blindsided. Rick's reign as CEO is over. He gets a call but tells the guy he wants this piece to be given to Liam, the one with Steffy back at FC. He fills her in that he thinks Wyatt is setting himself up for a heartbreak with Steffy. Things sometimes work out better the second time around. Wyatt explains to Steffy that she has been gone and in the meantime Liam fell in love with someone else. She says she refuses to go down that road again. Wyatt says there are other avenues like himself. Liam walks in as Wyatt hugs Steffy. Liam tells her that he needs to talk to her alone so Wyatt leaves. She still can not believe it \u0096 Mr. and Mrs. William Spencer, that should have been them. Wyatt answers the phone and asks Bill to what does he owe this pleasure. Wyatt tells Bill that his other son went and got himself a wife. He had to marry Ivy to save the day and keep her from being deported. Liam is telling Steffy right now and he needs to go pick up the pieces. Katie tells Bill that looks like he did get blindsided. Ivy says she has to tell Liam. Quinn asks if she loves him. Ivy says yes. Quinn tells her this mistake could happen again. She is having the life she always wanted and married to a man she adores so all she has to do is be quiet and not screw it up. Liam has been with Steffy more times than she can count and she does not deserve another chance. Liam says this situation has got him very confused. She says he told Ivy it was for show but it really isn't. He is married and he loves her so that has to count and she will not do this again. Liam says it took the risk of losing Steffy again to make him understand his feelings for her, so he can not lose her again. She says he did, the moment he said I do. If he loved Steffy then he would not have married Ivy. He pulls the old excuse that she left town after she lost her baby on her. Yes he did that. Given the situation he doesn't know what he is doing but he thinks this is fixable and needs her to tell him that she wants it too. She wants to believe him, but she can not do this, different girl but same situation. She tells him go home to his wife so he leaves. Bill fumes and tells Katie that Liam will use any excuse to jump into a phone booth and be the hero. Quinn tells Ivy don't cave in so easily. She gives her a bracelet and Ivy gives it back. Quinn gives it back and says she can have it all, just do not say a word to Liam. Wyatt returns to find Steffy and she says the marriage is real and the sad part is that she just wants Liam happy but she does not want to share him with another woman, especially one that is his wife. Liam goes back to Ivy and says he is sorry he had to go to FC. He had to see Steffy but they did not get to finish their talk so what does she need to tell her. He won't let the officer intimidate her. She keeps hearing Quinn's words reverberating in her mind that she is not to tell Liam.",
