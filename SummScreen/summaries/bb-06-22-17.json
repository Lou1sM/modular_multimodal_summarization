    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Zende asked Nicole to think of the baby. Nicole claimed to be doing that. Zende asked if she'd considered that Rick and Maya also had a bond with Lizzy, who they'd been raising. Zende said Lizzy would always be in Nicole's life, just not as Nicole's daughter.\n\n\nZende asked Nicole to be strong and understand what she was doing. He asked her to suppose that they didn't sign the papers. He asked if they would run away with Lizzy and leave everything they'd worked for behind. Zende doubted they'd be welcomed at Forrester. He advised Nicole to think of her bond with her sister, the bond that Maya and Rick had with Lizzy, and the reason Nicole had committed to the surrogacy in the first place. He concluded that hanging onto Lizzy wasn't the way to stop the pain over the news they'd gotten about having kids.\n\n\nZende reassured Nicole that they'd have a family, but Nicole said the doctors had told her that it might not happen. \"To hell with those doctors,\" Zende responded. He reasoned that it might not happen at that time, especially with all the pressure Nicole was under. He noted that they were young newlyweds. He said it was okay not to have kids right away.\n\n\nNicole felt that she'd taken for granted and hadn't appreciated how easy it had been with Lizzy. Zende said Nicole had appreciated it, and so had Rick and Maya. \"I can't do it for us!\" Nicole declared. Zende told her to stop it and said she could. He was sure she'd heard the stories of couples who'd been told they couldn't have children, and then \"boom.\" He said maybe it happened for those couples because they stopped stressing.\n\n\nZende believed that Nicole would get pregnant when the time was right. Nicole feared the time might never be right. She asked what would happen if Lizzy was her only chance. Nicole was afraid to sign away her chance to be the mother of her biological child. She believed that she and Lizzy had a connection, and Nicole said Julius had seen the connection.\n\n\nZende asked if Nicole had talked to her father about the issue. Nicole revealed that she'd told her father about the prognosis and the adoption paperwork, but she wondered if Julius was right about the clerical error happening for a reason. Zende didn't appreciate Nicole talking to her father about it instead of her husband.\n\n\nZende didn't know where Julius was leading Nicole, but Zende believed it wasn't right. Nicole asserted that Julius understood. She said Zende didn't know what it was like hearing that she was infertile and hearing Lizzy call her mommy. \"Don't you get it?\" Nicole asked. Zende replied that he didn't know. He'd wanted badly for her first child to be his, but it hadn't been. Instead, it had been Rick's.  Zende said that they would be parents, but not to Lizzy.\n\n\nZende knew how hard it was for Nicole, but he urged her to sign the papers. Nicole said she needed time, and she needed to think. She recalled that Zende had said he'd be there for her and asked if he could understand. Zende nodded and hugged her. After Zende had gone, Nicole sat on the sofa in the dark.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Maya and Rick were disconcerted by Nicole's hesitancy to sign the papers. Rick admitted he'd been too strong with Nicole, and it was unbelievable to him that they had to remind Nicole of who the child's parents were. Maya said she thought it had been settled. Rick noted that Zende had become involved, and Rick said Zende had better convince Nicole to sign.\n\n\nTo Maya and Rick's surprise, Julius arrived. He asked if they'd been expecting someone else. Rick and Maya explained that they were waiting for Zende and Nicole to work out something. Julius replied that he'd heard about the problem with the adoption paperwork. Rick asserted that there was no reason to worry, and Nicole would sign the papers.\n\n\nJulius said that it was no wonder Nicole was upset. Rick replied that Nicole was being unreasonable. Julius defended his daughter, who had just learned that she couldn't have more children. Maya corrected the statement with the word \"might\" and said they all needed to remember it. Maya and Rick felt for Nicole, but it had nothing to do with the adoption.\n\n\nRick was sorry because he felt he'd gotten carried away with Nicole. He said Zende was with Nicole, and Nicole would sign. Rick decided to leave to inform Carter of the temporary holdup. Maya asked Rick to have Carter see to it that it couldn't happen again.\n\n\nAfter Rick left, Julius inquired about the clerical error. Maya replied that things happened. Disagreeing, Julius said that one never heard of it with all the celebrity divorces and breakups in their town. Maya replied that Julius didn't hear about it because it was an easy fix. He reasoned that it might not need fixing, and it was good to stop and think about life-changing decisions.\n\n\nMaya replied that the decision had been made a long time back. Julius stated that it had apparently become undone, and when things like that happened out of the blue, people ought to think about the reason for it. Julius asked if Maya didn't think her sister had enough to deal with. He stated that the outcome just wasn't fair after what Nicole had done for Maya and Rick.\n\n\nMaya knew that the timing was awful. Julius roared that Maya didn't have a clue. He said that if Maya understood and cared about what she was doing to Nicole, then Maya would stop doing it. \"Don't you realize how devastating this is? And you go on, and you force some legal papers in her face and demand that she sign them?\" Julius asked.\n\n\nJulius asked how Maya could live with herself while knowing she'd taken the only child her sister could ever have. Maya conveyed that she was also worried about Nicole. He stated that Nicole was yearning for her baby. Maya replied that Nicole would have the baby someday, but Julius clarified that he meant Lizzy.\n\n\nMaya asserted that Lizzy was her baby. Julius countered that Nicole had given birth to her. \"And I am her mother. Nicole was my surrogate,\" Maya insisted. Julius believed Nicole had only done it because she'd felt indebted to Maya. Shaking her head, Maya replied that they'd discussed all the issues before the procedure. Her father told her it was time to think of someone other than herself for a change. Maya asked if he wanted to tell her what he meant by that.\n\n\nJulius said Maya had the chance to do the right thing, the compassionate thing, and the moral thing. Maya warned him to watch himself. Julius stated that Maya had done well with Lizzy, who was a happy baby. Maya had gotten her chance to experience motherhood, something she'd probably never believed would happen. Julius said that Nicole had given it to Maya, and Maya could give it back to Nicole.\n\n\nMaya uttered that Lizzy was her child. Julius stated that legally and genetically, the child was Nicole's, and Maya needed to give Lizzy back to her mother.\n\n\n\"You need to stop, Julius. Maya is Lizzy's mother,\" Zende said, closing the door as he entered the room. Julius said it wasn't Zende's place. Zende disagreed, and he said Maya had every right to be a parent. Zende believed that he and Julius both knew Lizzy's place was with Maya. Julius claimed to be looking out for Nicole and his grandchild.\n\n\nZende argued that Maya and Rick had been there for Lizzy every single day of her life. Zende respected that Julius was Nicole's father, but Zende asserted that he was her husband. \"Now you need to know your boundaries,\" Zende said. Zende asserted that convincing Nicole not to sign those papers would change everything, not to mention that Zende wasn't Lizzy's father.\n\n\nJulius asked if boundaries were only set up for him. He declared that he was Nicole's father, and he was Maya's father, too. Julius noted that Zende had arrived to tell Julius how it would be, but Julius said he'd be the one to tell Zende. Julius would never stop protecting Nicole, and no act of God or husband would change it.\n\n\n\"And that's a fact. Just like it's a fact,\" Julius said, waving a finger in Maya's direction, \"that if Maya was meant to have a child and be a mother, she would have been given what's necessary for that to be possible.\" Maya quietly asked Julius, \"How dare you?\"\n\n\nIn Zende's view, Maya had given Lizzy understanding and compassion since the day Lizzy had been born. Maya murmured that it was a lot more than Julius was giving her. Zende reasoned that Rick and Maya had adopted Lizzy. They'd made an agreement with Nicole, and no matter who liked it or didn't, Nicole had agreed to it.\n\n\nZende said Mr. Avant was known as a man of his word, and Zende asked what Julius wanted Nicole to be. \"Stay out of my marriage, man,\" Zende stated. He also said to stay away from Maya. Julius quietly left. Maya thanked Zende, and the two hugged.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Thomas kissed Sally from behind as she cooled off in front of the fan. She said they might have found a way to fix their air conditioner, but Thomas didn't want to fix it. Sally giggled as he nibbled her neck. She said that type of thing probably didn't happen at Forrester. He replied that she'd be surprised by what happened over there. He said he'd meant it when he'd told her that he'd rather be at Spectra with her than any other place in the world.\n\n\nWalking around an easel with the new logo on display, Sally said she loved the new logo. Thomas replied that not everyone felt that way. Sally conveyed that Saul was just a little concerned by all the new expensive changes. Thomas wondered if Saul would feel the same way if Sally was proposing the changes. Sally admitted that Saul might be a little jealous.\n\n\nSally believed that Saul would come around. Thomas wondered if a chat with Saul would hasten things. Sally didn't think Thomas should do it that day and motioned to his shirtless physique. She told Thomas not to worry about what Shirley or Saul thought because leaving the knockoff business required change.\n\n\nSally said that with the Forrester influence and style, they would turn the battleship into a luxury liner. She believed it would be amazing, and it couldn't happen without Thomas. He asked if she minded that Coco wasn't a part of the family business. Sally reminded him that he wasn't at his family business. Though Sally wanted Coco there so Sally would have more chances to redeem herself, Sally said that Coco was happy and doing well at Forrester.\n\n\nThomas believed that Coco had forgiven Sally, and he'd also forgiven her. He stated that they'd given Spectra a new start, and it was time for Sally to forgive herself and give herself a new start, too. He noted that she kept thanking him, but he asked if she ever thought he should be thanking her. Thomas felt that she'd led him out of his comfort zone and caused him to challenge himself.\n\n\nThomas claimed that he'd been angry, aggressive, and frustrated at Forrester. He hadn't been happy there in ages, but when he'd felt the energy at Spectra, it had made him remember why he'd fallen in love with fashion. He said she'd made him remember, and it was why he'd fallen in love with her. Thomas stated that Sally made Spectra unique, she was the reason that he was there, and she'd saved him. With a kiss, he uttered, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n",

She admits to Zende that she felt a special bond while taking care of Lizzy recently and that Julius agrees with her. Zende tries to reason with his wife and reminds her that the little girl is Rick and Maya's child ever since the birth. Rick consoles Maya about Nicole's sudden hesitancy to finalize the adoption. Julius shocks Maya and Rick when he voices his opinion that fate proved him right and that Nicole should be raising Lizzy. Zende walks in on the hurtful conversation and orders Julius to stay out of his marriage.

    "tvmega_recap": "Zende tells Nicole that Lizzy will always be a part of her life and have a special connection but not as her daughter. Not to sign those papers will create a huge rift with her sister and she is not thinking about the reason she did the surrogacy in the first place. Or what it is going to do to him. Rick tells Maya that he thinks it is absurd that they have to remind Nicole that Lizzy is their daughter, but she better sign those papers. Julius walks in at this moment and is surprised to hear Rick says there is no problem. Julius tells them not so fast. Nicole just found out she cannot have more children so don't be so sure she will do as they ask. Rick says he will go find Zende and Nicole and try to reason with them. Julius says this is a life changing decision yet it was undone. It came out of the blue so perhaps they should think about that. Zende tells Nicole they will have their family. They are young and just got married so give it a little more time. People are told all the time that have been married for years that they cannot have babies and then they do. She laments that Lizzy might be her only chance. Sally tells Thomas that do not underestimate Saul and Grams. They love this company as much as she does so they need to work hard to make this work. Coco is happy over at Forrester. She is supported by RJ and his family. It would be nice if she was here but Coco is happy so that is all that counts. Thomas tells Sally to quit saying she owes more apologies to Coco. Nicole tells Zende that her father said maybe this is more than just a technical error; perhaps it happened for a reason. She doesn't get it when Zende doesn't seem to understand. He says she does not know how badly he wanted Nicole to have his child first. She says it is hard to understand but she does need more time. Julius tells Maya that she does not have a clue how hard this is for Nicole. This is selfish of her and to live with herself by tearing always the only child Nicole may ever have. Thomas says he was not happy at Forrester for years and by bailing Sally out she made him step out of his comfort zone. That is why he fell in love with her. She saved him not the other way around. Julius and Maya argue who's baby that Lizzy really is. He tells her to do the moral and compassionate thing. Nicole gave her that child and now she can give it back to Nicole legally. Zende walks in and Julius says this is not his place to have a say in this. Zende argues that Maya and Rick have been raising her for an entire year. He is her husband and yet he is not Lizzy's father. Julius says he is Nicole's father and he will never stop protecting her. So no act of God or any husband can change this. And if God had wanted Maya to have a child then he would have given her that chance. Maya looks at Julius in contempt then hugs Zende for being on her side.",
