Pam noticed a distracted look on Charlie's face, but he claimed that he was fine.\n\n\nEric had asked Katie to the office to offer her another job, but the job would be better suited to her talents. Katie asked if Eric was sure and cited that she'd overreacted about her firing. Eric was sure, and he offered her Wyatt's former job, working with Nicole in marketing.\n\n\nEric believed it was a perfect fit, but Katie asked what Quinn thought. Quinn was in agreement and added that she wouldn't be there if Katie hadn't alerted Ridge to save Quinn. Charlie quipped that it was really fortunate that they practically lived beneath the same roof.\n\n\nKatie asked if Eric wanted to run it by Steffy first. Ridge stated that it was the first he was hearing of the job offer, too. Eric asked if Ridge had an issue with it. When Ridge said he didn't, Eric expressed certainty that Steffy wouldn't either, and Eric welcomed Katie back to work.\n\n\nQuinn seemed unsettled. Eric asked if she was okay and reminded her that Deacon was in jail. Ridge quipped that Sheila should be in jail, too, and not in their family home. Quinn remarked that Sheila had expressed an unusual fondness for Eric.\n\n\nLater, Katie was alone with Quinn and Ridge. Katie decided to check in with Nicole, but Quinn wanted to talk to Katie first. Quinn expressed her gratitude to Katie for helping to save Quinn. Quinn hoped they could turn the page on Katie's preoccupation with Quinn and Ridge and move on. Katie decided that Quinn was right, and Quinn and Ridge had nothing to worry about from Katie.\n\n\nAfter Katie had gone, Ridge asked if Quinn was really okay with Katie returning to Forrester. Quinn believed it was important to Eric, who felt he'd mishandled Katie's firing. Ridge said Katie had a job that was better for her, and he believed she wouldn't cause problems anymore. Agreeing, Quinn said the chapter was finally behind them, and the secret was safe.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Wyatt was surprised to hear that Deacon had asked Bill for bail money. Bill murmured that Deacon had to have thought that history could repeat itself. Wyatt didn't get what Bill meant. Wyatt also didn't get why Deacon was even eligible for bail after attempting to kill Wyatt's mother. Bill quipped that one little bullet wouldn't hurt Quinn -- unless it was silver.\n\n\nWyatt didn't think it was funny and said his mother wasn't the same woman that Bill loved to hate. Bill replied that he didn't hate Quinn, but he also wasn't falling for her transformation act. Bill found it remarkable that Katie had saved Quinn after Quinn had fired Katie. He concluded that Quinn owed Katie big time.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was alone with Katie in Bill's office. Katie had just told him about her new job. She figured that she'd only been rehired because she'd helped saved Quinn, but Katie really wanted to make it work that time. Wyatt thanked Katie for saving his mother and guessed that Katie had his old job. Katie explained that she's started out in marketing, but it had been a while since she'd run Forrester. She was hoping that she could pick Wyatt's brain a bit.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Brooke ended a meeting with Giovanni, a client from Milan. He left, and Brooke was surprised to see Sheila approach the table. Sheila hadn't expected to see Brooke but said the encounter would give Sheila the chance she'd wanted to apologize for all she'd done to Brooke. Sheila didn't expect for all to be forgiven but noted that she'd been deeply disturbed back then.\n\n\n\"And you're not now?\" Brooke asked. Sheila had many regrets, but she wanted to focus on the good times. Being Mrs. Eric Forrester had filled Sheila with pride, but she figured she'd squandered it away.\n\n\nSheila said Eric had taken a wife who was worthy of him. Brooke fiddled with her napkin. Sheila asked if Quinn was worthy. Brooke didn't answer, and Sheila asked if Brooke didn't like Quinn. Brooke stated that she hadn't said that, but Sheila replied that it had been in Brooke's reaction.\n\n\nBrooke stood to leave and said she had to get back to Forrester. Sheila expressed how glad she was for a chance to talk to Brooke and thanked Brooke for the opportunity. Brooke left the restaurant. A woman bumped into Sheila. \"Would you watch it?\" Sheila yelled at the woman.\n\n\nSheila sat at the bar to have a martini and flashed back on times with Eric. Behind her at a table, she heard two people being seated as they had a heated discussion with the man, Charlie, making remarks about Quinn and Ridge. The woman, Pam, told him to let it go, but Charlie said that living in ostrich reality wasn't the answer, either. Charlie, who cared about Eric as much as she did, wanted to keep digging, even if he didn't turn anything else up.\n\n\nCharlie said trouble followed Quinn like tick followed tock. Pam agreed but couldn't blame Quinn for Deacon's decision to go after her. Charlie defended Deacon's motives, saying Quinn had tossed Deacon aside like an old rag doll. Pam was over it, and she told Charlie to drop his lipstick napkin obsession. Charlie said he'd tried, but he was bothered by the living arrangements at the mansion. He just wanted what was best for Eric.\n\n\nPam's phone chimed. She saw something on it and decided that she had to get back to work. She told him to go on and eat, but she reminded him that he could be doing more harm than good to Eric. Charlie stammered, and Pam repeated herself and left.\n\n\nSheila approached Charlie and said she'd overheard him talking about Eric Forrester. Charlie asked who she was. Sheila replied that he was Charlie. He asked how she knew it, and she said she couldn't help but notice his ID. Charlie quipped that she couldn't help but eavesdrop, either.\n\n\nSheila said she'd heard Charlie's concern about Eric, which made her concerned about her old friend. She asked to sit at his table, but Charlie said he was about to leave. Sheila sat down anyway and asked if his concern had to do with Eric's wife. She got the feeling that Charlie didn't care for Quinn, who Sheila had thought was a loving, loyal spouse.\n\n\nIn Charlie's silence, Sheila decided to confess that she was a sucker for a guy in uniform. Charlie asked if she was dating someone in uniform, and she replied that for years, it had been all she'd seen. \"Riddle me this: if you're so close to the Forresters, who's that blonde who just ran out on me?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\nSheila thought the woman had looked familiar. Charlie divulged that the woman was Stephanie Forrester's sister, Pamela Douglas. Pam had lived in Tinsel Town for a while, so he figured that Sheila didn't know the Forresters all that well if she didn't know Pam.\n\n\nSheila reasoned that she'd been gone a while, but she insisted that she was just as concerned about Eric as Charlie. Sheila wanted to help if something was going on with Eric or Eric's family and marriage. \"So, please...tell me, Charlie,\" Sheila said.\n\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Brooke met with Eric, and Eric informed her of the new job he'd given her sister. Brooke filled him in about the lunch with Giovanni. She said all had gone well until Sheila had shown up. Brooke had been freaked out by Sheila's odd pleasantries and gleefulness to see Brooke. Eric figured Sheila had asked for forgiveness.\n\n\nBrooke recalled that Sheila had seemed genuine. \"As genuine as Sheila can be,\" Brooke added. She stated that Sheila had also been concerned about Eric and his well-being. Brooke revealed that Sheila had even questioned Quinn as his wife.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Brooke is blindsided when she runs into her former friend turned nemesis Sheila Carter for the first time in 14 years who asks for forgiveness. Sheila is surprised by Brooke's reaction when she brings up Eric's loving wife Quinn. Eric informs Ridge, Quinn, Ivy, Pam and Charlie that Katie will return to work for Forrester Creations but this time more suited in the marketing department. Ridge and Quinn are relieved when Katie tells them that she is ready to move on and therefore closing the chapter of issuing threats about their affair. Wyatt does not find it amusing when Bill jokes about the threats that were made against Quinn's life, even though Bill reassures his son that he turned down Deacon's request to post bail. Later, Katie asks Wyatt for an introductory course on her new job in marketing. At Il Giardino, Sheila picks up on Pam's and Charlie's conversation over lunch at a nearby table. Charlie rants to Pam about his hunch that Quinn is cheating on Eric. After Pam leaves, Sheila introduces herself to Charlie eager to find out more about Eric's new wife.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sheila stuns Brooke by walking up to her table at Il Giardino. She wants to make amends. Brooke says Sheila was wrongly accused of shooting at Quinn but she has not forgotten anything in Sheila's past. Sheila picks up that Brooke doesn't exactly like Quinn. Brooke won't dignify that remark. Sheila is glad she got the chance to speak with Brooke and says she is sorry. Wyatt too is stunned that Deacon asked Bill to make bail for him. Bill says one little bullet could not kill his mom only a stake through the heart if they could find one. Wyatt says that is not funny. She is his mom and could have been killed. She is not the same woman that he always hated. He remarks that Katie saved Quinn's life after she fired her so Quinn owes Kathy big time now. Eric calls a meeting and thanks them all again for saving his wife's life. Then he tells Katie that he is not dismissing her. He would like her to work in marketing. Sheila has a drink and thinks of fond times with Eric. Pam and Charlie are seated at the next table and Sheila overhears them talking that they only want what is best for Eric. Pam does not want to hear Charlie say any more negative things about Quinn. Charlie claims that he will always keep his eyes out for Quinn. She tells him enough; this has become an obsession with him. If he wants to do what's right by Eric then just stop all of this. She has to go back to work. Sheila drops by Charlie's table and says she could not help but overhear him mention Eric Forrester. He does not know who she is. She asks if she can sit down and then does. She is concerned about Eric as they are old friends and she got the impression that he does not care for Quinn that much. Charlie says if he let Pam slip away and did not know her, then she does not know that much about the Forrester clan. She says if something is going on with Eric or with his family she would like to help so she begs him to tell her. Wyatt tells his dad that he knows his mom is not high up on his list but she is totally devoted to Eric and will not ever do anything to mess that up. Quinn thanks Katie for all she did in saving her life and hopes they can turn the page where Eric is concerned. Katie says she is right. Quinn has nothing for her to be worried about. Brooke fills Eric in about Sheila showing up. And she seemed genuinely concerned about Eric's welfare; even asking about his wife, Quinn. Katie tells Wyatt that she feels the primary reason she is back at FC is because she somewhat saved Quinn's life. Wyatt is grateful. She asks him for his help. Ridge laments to Quinn that he believes Katie, that she will not be a problem for them anymore.",
