Brooke, Liam, and Hope shared how happy they all were to get the news.\n\n\nHope added that she had news in addition to reuniting with Liam. Hope admitted that she had seen her father. Hope said that Deacon had returned because he had missed her. Brooke reminded Hope to be careful with Deacon because Deacon always had an angle. Hope said that Deacon knew he had to earn her trust.\n\n\nLiam pointed out that he and Hope would have been married if Deacon hadn't been in Italy. Hope wanted to put it behind them. She wanted a relationship with her father. \"He supports us and wants me to be happy,\" Hope said to Liam. Liam and Hope hugged, and Brooke looked on.\n\n\nAt Quinn's place, Deacon showed up, and Quinn lamented that it had been her fault that she had screwed up, and her son was paying the price. Quinn wistfully noted that Wyatt and Hope belonged together, and Deacon said that Hope had clearly made her choice -- it was Liam. Quinn insisted they had to help Hope remember that it was Wyatt she loved. \n\n\nQuinn reminded Deacon that Hope had admitted to Deacon that she had fallen in love with Wyatt. Deacon countered that Hope had decided to move on. Quinn ignored Deacon and insisted that Deacon needed to help Hope and Wyatt. \"Let's work something out,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nQuinn said that the media loved Hope and Wyatt, but Deacon laughed that Quinn had destroyed that. \"Carnage follows you wherever you go,\" he said. Quinn asked what she had to do to get him to help her. He said that he needed a place to stay, and he suggested there was plenty of room in the warehouse and apartment. Quinn agreed. \n\n\n\"If Hope has a thing for him, I'll see what I can do,\" Deacon said of Wyatt. Quinn felt that Deacon's help would be worth the price. \"I always am,\" Deacon said. \"Deal,\" Quinn said, and she shook Deacon's hand.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Wyatt sulked and found Hope's scarf in the couch cushions. He looked at photos of Hope, and he seemed wistful and sad.\n\n\nOn the Forrester rooftop, Aly hugged Oliver and told him that he had helped her hold it together during the crisis when no one had known what had happened to Ridge. Aly put her arms around Oliver's neck and hugged him. Thorne interrupted and told Aly she was needed in a meeting. Aly left. \n\n\nThorne wanted to know Oliver's intentions with Aly. Thorne remarked that Oliver had been a major part of Aly's  breakthrough, \"but you're older and more experienced,\" Thorne said.\n\n\nThorne added that Aly was at a critical stage in her life and trusted Oliver. Thorne pointedly asked Oliver about his feelings for Aly. Oliver said that he cared about Aly. Aly returned and interrupted. She realized that Thorne had sent her downstairs so that he could have some time alone with Oliver.\n\n\nThorne admitted that he knew Oliver was a good guy. Thorne said he trusted Oliver, and that wasn't easy to say. Thorne gave Aly and Oliver his blessing to see each other \"as long as you make time for your old man,\" Thorne said to Aly. Aly agreed, but she noted that he had spent most of his time in Paris. Thorne promised to stay in Los Angeles for a while.\n\n\nAfter Thorne left, Aly and Oliver discussed their relationship. Oliver admitted that he had been a little nervous when he had spoken to Thorne. Aly asked about the conversation, and Oliver noted that Thorne knew that Aly had fallen for Oliver. Aly agreed, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn Hope's office at Forrester, Deacon entered. Hope wondered how Deacon had gained entrance into the building. Deacon noted that they knew him. \"You look so grown up and so beautiful,\" Deacon said. He asked about Ridge. Hope said Ridge had been improving. \"He'll be fine,\" Deacon said.\n\n\nDeacon apologized for the wedding interference again, but Hope wanted to leave it in the past. \"Things worked out anyway. Liam and I are back together,\" Hope said happily. \"Are you sure it is what you want?\" Deacon asked.\n\n\nHope responded that it was. Wyatt called and interrupted the conversation. Wyatt asked Hope to visit him, and Hope refused. Wyatt told her that he knew she had missed him, but Hope said she no longer wanted to talk to him. She hung up. Deacon said that Wyatt was clearly not over Hope. Hope said that Wyatt would always be in her life because he was Liam's brother.\n\n\nDeacon said that Wyatt had been loyal to her, but Hope said that Wyatt's life had a lot of drama she couldn't handle. Hope said that she hoped Deacon never had to meet Quinn. \"I don't want Quinn as an in-law,\" Hope said.\n\n\nQuinn entered Liam's uninvited, and Liam told her to get out. Quinn refused and promised to be at Liam's office, in his home, and in his face until Hope and Wyatt were back together. Liam called it textbook stalker behavior \"or something more serious,\" he said.\n\n\n\"It is,\" Quinn promised. She had a new mission in life, and it was to get Wyatt and Hope back together. Liam told her she was psychotic. Quinn told Liam that he had turned everyone against her because he'd made everyone believe it was her fault that Ridge had been hurt.\n\n\n\"We would be married,\" Liam reminded Quinn -- if she had not interfered. Quinn replied that she had saved Hope from a life of monotony and mind-numbing boredom. Quinn promised to haunt Liam. \"You just made me stronger and so much more dangerous,\" she said. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke becomes anxious when she learns that Deacon is in Los Angeles and has reached out to Hope. She and Liam warn Hope about her desire to grow closer to her father. Having noticed Aly spending much more time with her new friend, Oliver, and feeling concerned about their age difference, Thorne confronts him about his intentions towards his daughter. Quinn quickly picks herself up and is back to her old tricks.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Thorne oversees Aly put her arms around Oliver's neck and tell him that he is good for her. Thorne makes sure that she is needed downstairs. He tells Oliver things would be a lot better if he knew what his intentions were. He is not going to bite his head off unless he has to. He just wants to warn him that it is frowned on for employees to consort with other employees romantically. Plus Oliver is a lot older than Aly. But Aly has come a long way this year helped largely by Oliver and he knows his daughter has fallen seriously for him. That is why they are having this chat. Aly is at a critical stage in her life so if Oliver's intentions are not true and honorable then end it right now. Oliver says he can stop now. His intentions are true. Aly interrupts before either can say more. She realizes immediately that Thorne wanted to talk to Oliver alone. Thorne tells Aly that she has stepped out of the darkness into the sunshine and that is all he wants for her to be happy. So he is going to trust Oliver and stick around a little bit. Aly questions Oliver of what he and her dad talked about. He says Thorne wanted to know his intentions .and he told him that Aly had fallen for him. She says he was right. While discussing Ridge returning, Hope tells Brooke that she has told neither her nor Liam but her father gave her a visit. She is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Brooke tells her to be careful as Deacon always has an ulterior motive. Hope says she is aware of his past history but he seems sincere. He regrets all those years of not knowing her when she grew up and he wants to earn her trust again. She really wants to have some sort of relationship with him and she has to believe that he will support her and Liam since he wants her to be happy. Deacon shows up at Quinn's per her request. She says Wyatt did not convince Hope to return to him. He was quickly run off the Forrester property. Quinn wants to help Wyatt; Deacon wants to help Hope so they should be able to work something out. Deacon tells her that he messed with his daughter's life once before, he doesn't intend to do that again. She refers to his help again and he looks around and says maybe something can be arranged. He needs a place to stay. She says she can not afford to put him up in the penthouse. He says her place will do just fine. She says okay, the warehouse has room; it's a deal. They shake on it. She quips he might be worth the price after all. Deacon comes by at the office to see Hope. She wonders how he got past security. He reassures her that he only wants the best for her and he hears she is now back with Liam. He wants to make sure she is sure. Wyatt calls Hope after he finds her scarf at his place. He wants her to come over and just hang out and exchange war stories. She tells him he is making this difficult. Deacon is still there and she quickly ends the phone call. When Deacon questions her about Wyatt, she says he is Liam's brother and will always be a part of her life, but she thinks it is better this way. When Deacon presses if Wyatt ever cheated on her or was loyal, she answers very loyal. But there was too much drama with his mother who she hopes Deacon never will be unlucky enough to run into. She wants to have children some day and Liam is strong and stable and frankly she does not want Quinn as a mother-in-law. Quinn barges through Liam's door but he's Johnny on the spot and stops her and asks what she wants. She says the usual and she is not going anywhere until she gets it. She is going to be here at his home, at the office, whatever it takes until Hope is out of his life. She says she is not going to stand down until Hope and Wyatt are back together again. Liam says that is textbook stalker behavior. She says call it what he wants but her new mission in life is to get rid of him once and for all. Hope and Wyatt will be together again. Liam calls her psychotic. After exchanging a few more barbs, she says all that he has been spreading about her will come back to haunt him. She will haunt him. And if he thinks he is scaring her, no, it only makes her stronger and more dangerous.",

The pair kissed on the rooftop, and Oliver said he was nervous about saying that he cared about Aly, but Thorne insisted that he trusted her and said he would stay in Los Angeles for a while. \"Are you sure it is what you want?\" Deacon asked Hope. \"Things in the past have worked out anyway,\" Hope said. \"He'll be fine,\" Deacon apologized for the wedding interference again, but Hope wanted to leave it. \"You look so grown up and so beautiful,\" he said to Hope, and she hung up on him.\n"
