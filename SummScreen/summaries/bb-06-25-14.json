    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's, Liam warned Quinn to get out. He was sick of her empty threats. \"It's over, Quinn.\" Liam reminded Quinn that she and Wyatt were no longer employed at Forrester. Quinn blamed Liam for poisoning Hope and everyone.\n\n\n\"Let Hope think for herself,\" Quinn demanded. Quinn insisted that Hope wanted to forgive Wyatt because Wyatt had done nothing wrong. Liam refused. \"There is no way left for you and your son to get into Hope's life,\" Liam said.\n\n\nQuinn argued that Liam had turned everyone against her. She reminded Liam that Ridge was alive and well, and Liam had tried to blame her for everything that had happened. Liam told her she was psychotic.\n\n\nQuinn said that Liam had never had to work for anything, but Wyatt had been by Hope's side at the office. Wyatt had worked toward Hope's success. Quinn made fun of Liam, who had given Hope a kitten. \"You still don't get it. She has different values than you, Quinn,\" Liam said.\n\n\nQuinn changed her tune. She begged Liam to remember that Wyatt was his brother. \"I don't believe you want to ruin his life, take away his business, and his family. Let Wyatt come back to Forrester,\" Quinn begged. She maintained that it wasn't fair that he had been punished. \n\n\nQuinn said that if Liam and Hope were happy, it shouldn't matter if Wyatt returned to work. Liam refused. He didn't trust Quinn or Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam said he only cared about his own future with Hope. Quinn looked furious. She advised Liam that the sword around his neck had been a symbol of family, and it bonded him to his father and brother. She wondered why Liam had no problem ruining Wyatt's life. \"Live by the sword, die by the sword,\" she said and she viciously stabbed Liam in the throat.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Rick met with Caroline, Aly, Oliver, Carter, Hope, and Maya. He pointed out that the couture line had slowed down because of Ridge's accident. He added that Hope for the Future had become the sole priority.\n\n\nRick knew Caroline's new collection was light and youthful. They all discussed the photo shoot with Oliver. Hope and Maya stepped away to get something to drink, and Hope commented that things had been tense lately, but she was looking forward to seeing Maya's beautiful smile in the new pictures.\n\n\nMaya wondered if something had been wrong with her work. Hope noted that Maya had been distracted. Hope asked if something had been bothering her. Maya assured Hope that the shoot would be fine.\n\n\nThe meeting resumed, and plans were made for the photo shoot. Rick said he had planned some time in the steam room. He kissed Caroline and wanted her to join him, but Caroline had a meeting. Maya watched. Maya and Oliver left for a photo shoot.\n\n\nAly, Caroline, and Hope discussed that they needed to add essential summer accessories to the line. Hope worried that it was too much after all the jewelry they had promoted. Aly asked about Wyatt, and Hope confirmed that Quinn and Wyatt were no longer with the company.\n\n\nAly worried that Wyatt and Quinn would go out of business. Hope noted that Aly had shown a different side recently. Aly agreed that she had let go of a lot of anger because she had met a guy -- Oliver -- and Caroline and Hope were surprised. \"He's such a sweet guy -- you're perfect for each other,\" Hope said. Hope praised Aly for the good energy she had shared.\n\n\nCaroline and Aly teased Hope about dating two guys, but Hope said it was over. She would always care about Wyatt, but she was committed to Liam. Aly suggested they all go on a date together, and Caroline added that she felt Hope should invite them all to the beach.\n\n\nIn the photo studio, Oliver set up while Maya modeled a dress. Maya looked unhappy, and Oliver asked what was wrong. Maya resented that Caroline had ended up with Rick. Oliver was shocked. Maya went off on how she hated that Caroline Spencer was living the life that Maya should have had.\n\n\nMaya advised Oliver to be careful with Aly. Oliver told Maya that he had already talked to Thorne, who had given them his blessing. Maya lamented that she didn't have Rick, and Oliver sternly reminded Maya that she was a Forrester spokesmodel.\n\n\nMaya flashed back to running through stores on Rodeo Drive with Rick. Oliver knew that Maya was lost in thought. Oliver advised her to take a break. Maya argued, but Oliver reminded her how lucky she was to have Carter. Maya countered that Oliver would be on the inside at Forrester because he had hooked up with Aly.\n\n\nMaya shared that she was envious of the Forrester family's wealth. She arrogantly claimed that she and Rick would never be living at the guesthouse. Oliver interrupted and asked if Maya was angry or jealous. \"I am tired of watching people like Caroline get whatever they want. I play by the rules,\" she said. \n\n\nOliver was in disbelief. Maya left. Aly entered and asked what had happened to Maya. Oliver said that Maya had been distracted.\n\n\nIn the steam room, Rick relaxed. He heard the door open, and he assumed Caroline had joined him. \"I was hoping that you'd show up,\" Rick said. It was Maya who had entered. She rubbed his neck, and he turned to discover that it was Maya. She smiled. Rick was surprised.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Maya is put on the spot when Hope points out, in front of the Forrester Creations group, that there has been a noticeable change in her behavior. Aly happily shares with Hope and Caroline that she and Oliver have been dating. Quinn makes a last-ditch effort to convince Liam to allow Wyatt to continue working at Forrester Creations. Maya confesses to Oliver a significant regret from her past.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tells Quinn this conversation is over. She has lost her employment and Wyatt and Hope are over. Ridge may be home but that doesn't absolve Quinn's doings. Quinn says it might if he would let Hope think for herself. He would not even let Hope talk to Wyatt and she wants to forgive him. Liam tells her to get this into her head. There is no way left for her and her son to get into Hope's life. Quinn doesn't know what Hope sees in him. He's been given everything \u0096 his name, his job. He hasn't had to work for one thing like Wyatt who has been by Hope's side working toward her success. Wyatt gave her a priceless diamond and Liam gave her a kitten, oh and he wrote an article about puppies. Liam says Hope is not about the dollar sign; she has a different set of values Quinn would not understand. Quinn says Wyatt doesn't have dollar signs either. He did not meet her on Rodeo Drive or in his father's high-rise; it was in the woods. She wants to know if he has thought at all how this is going to affect his brother. Liam says if Hope was concerned at all about her line, she would not have fired Wyatt. Quinn quips maybe she did it to protect Liam's fragile ego She does not believe that Hope wants to ruin Wyatt's life or that Liam really wants to either. So just let Wyatt come back to FC. Her son did nothing wrong so it's not right to punish him for something that she did. And if he and Hope are so happy then there should be no harm in them working together. Liam admits he could do that, but he's not. He's not that crazy. He doesn't want Wyatt anywhere near Hope. Quinn says his insecurities is showing. Liam says yes because he doesn't trust Wyatt or her either. And his only regret is that he did not throw her ass out sooner. So he motions for her to shoo, get on and leave. He doesn't care what she thinks. The only thing he cares about is Hope and his future with her. As they sit around in a quick meeting, Aly says it is a relief. Hope says it's like a gigantic lift off of their shoulders and Rick says now they can get back to work. The press and RJ never knew that Ridge was missing so they need to keep this low-key. For now couture is on hold and HFTF their sole priority. Rick turns to Caroline and Hope and says they need to turn up the volume. Aly chimes in that Oliver can help as he has a photo shoot today with Maya. Aly says now that Wyatt and Quinn are gone they can put the focus back on Hope's message where it belongs. Hope says Caroline's collection is showcasing that; it's light and youthful and full of movement. She thinks the photo shoot should be the same. She intimates that perhaps Maya was distracted when Ridge was missing but he's back now so unless there is something else she expects to see that trademark smile again in the photos. Maya keeps eyeballing Caroline and Rick and pays attention when Caroline says Rick has reserved the steam room for this afternoon. The girls all agree that a big hat, sunscreen and glasses are essential summer accessories. Aly asks if Wyatt and Quinn are truly gone. Hope says well they haven't left the city but they aren't at FC. She hopes they are not out of the business. Aly says she hopes not either. She's happy that Hope is with Liam, so Wyatt has his own problems now. Caroline says that is a big change in attitude. Aly smiles that her attitude has changed about a lot of things. By some prompting Aly reveals it is Oliver. Oliver sets up for the shoot but Maya keeps mouthing off about Caroline and Rick; how she is always pawing over him. She even says she is sick of watching Caroline leading her life \u0096 the Crown Princess of the Forrester dynasty. Oliver says if anyone deserves that title it is Aly. She says he needs to be careful, playing her like that in front of everyone. Oliver says he is not playing Aly. Her dad knows he is sincere and gave him his blessing. Maya says she is sorry. She knows she needs to be happy for him and all the Forrester's. They have so much \u0096 mansions, fancy cars and jets that can whisk them off to Paris any time they want. Most of all they have each other's backs and she could have had all of that. Oliver tells her not to screw this up. She is the spokesmodel for FC and that is a primo gig. Maya grouses that she could work her whole life and never be on the inside here. Just like Hope was grilling her a few minutes ago .there is only one way she and Oliver will get to the top of this company. Oliver senses that she is jealous when she keeps talking about Rick and how he opened up her life. Oliver reminds her of just what she has compared to where she came from. She knows but says she can't help but still dream about private chefs and assistants, houses all over the world, Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, the Riviera. Carter is a wonderful man but he will never be Rick. They will never be on the inside. But when Oliver gets with Aly he will be one of them. Rick is enjoying the steam room when someone else enters. He thinks it is Caroline but is surprised when he turns around from a neck massage and it is Maya. Aly offers to help Oliver when she sees Maya's shoot is over for now. Oliver wants to shoot Aly since she would make a beautiful model. She is flattered. Quinn tells Liam that he has no idea who he is fooling with. He can not shoo her away like some pest. He can not just dismiss her. He says that is just it. He doesn't have to deal with her anymore. She says it is too late for that. He doesn't like threats and she doesn't respond to bravado. She walks up close to him and says she won't let him stand in the way of her son's happiness. That necklace \u0096 symbol of family pride .his connection and bond to his father and to his brother. Yet he is willing to sabotage his life. She takes the sword and holds it in her hand and says remember her words \u0096 you live by the sword and you die by the sword. She takes it and gives Liam a poke in the neck. His eyes bulge out of his sockets.",
