She agreed to return to Forrester and make it known that she hadn't been fired for being transgender, but Rick had to be along with her.\n\n\nRidge stated that Rick had made his day by punching Bill, and there was probably a place for Rick in Paris. Rick grunted, saying he could run international from where he was. Maya insisted that she and Rick were a package deal, and Ridge said it was fine. Ridge welcomed Rick back aboard, and as the men shook on it, Rick hoped all Ridge's CEO choices would be as good as that one.\n\n\nLater, Rick and Maya were alone, and he commended the way she'd handled Ridge like an executive. Maya couldn't believe the ground support surrounding her, and Rick exclaimed that she had \"hash tags.\" She said Ridge could have asked her to just make a statement to clear up her resignation misunderstanding. Rick claimed that Forrester could never find another led model like her.\n\n\nRick was blown away that Maya had used her moment with Ridge to ask for Rick to return to Forrester. She said Rick would still be CEO if it weren't for her. He claimed that he wouldn't want to be CEO without her, and she said she didn't want to be at Forrester or anywhere without him, either.\n\n\nRick said modeling meant a lot to Maya, and Maya said it meant as much as Forrester did to him. He replied that he hadn't been thinking of his job when he'd punched Bill. \"I know. You were thinking about me,\" she replied. Rick said that Maya didn't have to do what she'd done for him. She stated that Ridge was willing to give her a second chance, and she thought Rick deserved one, too.\n\n\nRick decided that he and Maya needed to take their party upstairs. The two went upstairs and held each other on the bed. They said that they'd missed each other, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Caroline, Steffy, Wyatt, and Quinn met about jewelry. Caroline wondered where Ivy was, and Quinn guessed Ivy was somewhere around there with her husband. Caroline was shocked and asked if Liam and Ivy were married.\n\n\nWyatt explained Ivy's immigration problem to Caroline, who said that the couple would have to live together. Steffy murmured that Immigration would check up on them for years. Quinn decided to take some design notes to Ivy, and after Quinn had gone, Caroline said she was sorry to Steffy.\n\n\nWyatt interjected that Steffy had been through it before with Liam, and Steffy asserted that she wouldn't put herself through it again. Wyatt said she wouldn't have to if she found the right guy.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Liam assured Ivy that she could relax because she couldn't get deported. Quinn arrived and asked Liam to leave so that she and Ivy could work. After he'd gone, Quinn exclaimed, \"No goodbye kiss for your husband?\" Quinn urged Ivy to reel Liam in and make the marriage work. Ivy stated that her marriage shouldn't have happened, and she didn't need it to stay in the country.\n\n\nQuinn and Ivy tried to work, but Ivy couldn't concentrate because of worrying about telling Liam the truth. Ivy felt that Liam deserved to know that they hadn't had to get married. Quinn felt that, because the marriage had torpedoed any chance he'd had to be with Steffy, keeping silent was the most compassionate thing Ivy could do for Liam.\n\n\nIvy reasoned that Liam didn't love her. Quinn disagreed, but Ivy insisted that it wasn't the same way he loved Steffy. Quinn tried to convince Ivy to make her marriage work, but Ivy was convinced that the marriage had been a huge mistake.\n\n\nQuinn indicated that Liam had known what he'd been getting into by marrying Ivy, and he'd done it without even considering Steffy's feeling or the implications. Quinn believed it was the very reason Steffy had given up on him. Ivy argued that she hadn't given Liam time to think about anything.\n\n\nWyatt arrived, and Quinn sent Ivy to meet Steffy about some jewelry notes. Wyatt observed Ivy's demeanor and guessed that Liam wasn't the only one having second thoughts about marriage.\n\n\nBack in Steffy's office, Liam arrived to explain his reasons for marrying Ivy. Steffy insisted that he could have hired Ivy a lawyer or gotten Bill's help instead of getting married. Steffy asked if Liam had anything work-related to discuss. Shocked by her coldness, he asked her not to shut him out completely.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Ivy cracked the door and heard Liam declare that he loved Steffy and knew that she loved him. Ivy walked away, and Liam told Steffy he didn't want to lose her.\n\n\nSteffy asserted that Liam could kick himself all he wanted, but she was done obsessing over what might have been. Liam claimed not to be asking that of her, but she balked at his audacity to ask her for anything. He claimed that he'd meant everything he'd said to Steffy, but she asked if he'd meant his \"till death do us part\" vows to Ivy.\n\n\nLiam stated that the marriage would not be until death; it would end with Ivy's citizenship. Steffy said it could take years. \"Or it could not,\" he contended. Steffy said it was too late. She recalled that he'd said he'd talk to Ivy, and Steffy had spent hours shopping and putting together a ridiculous trip down memory lane. He claimed it hadn't been ridiculous, and he'd loved it.\n\n\nSteffy asked why Liam had let her go on like that when he'd known he'd asked her there to tell her about the wedding. He claimed he'd tried but hadn't been able to. Steffy replied that it made two of them because she couldn't do it, either.\n\n\nBack in Rick's old office, Ivy stormed in. Quinn asked if she'd seen Steffy. Ivy relayed that she'd overheard Liam expressing love for Steffy. Quinn hoped Ivy had dragged Liam out of there, but Ivy said she'd slipped away unseen. Ivy didn't want to trap anyone in a marriage.\n\n\nQuinn insisted that Ivy had been in real distress, and Ivy's feelings and devotion to Liam were real, too. Ivy declared that it wasn't who she was, and she had to tell Liam.\n\n\nLater, Ridge entered his CEO's office, where Caroline was designing. Caroline got onto him for keeping things like Liam's marriage a secret. Ridge said he had some news for her, and he informed her that Maya -- and Rick -- were headed back to Forrester. Caroline's jaw clicked. \"Great,\" she murmured.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline sketched together and discussed Maya's dedication to Rick. Ridge believed that Maya was all-in with Rick, and Ridge was impressed by Maya's loyalty to Rick. Caroline asked if Ridge thought the two would reunite. Ridge believed they would by nightfall.\n\n\nCaroline and Ridge smooched, and he apologized for cutting her party short. She said she wouldn't be there if it wasn't for him helping her recover. Ridge responded that he was being selfish because it was no fun without her there, and they kissed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt welcomes Caroline back to work. Caroline is surprised to hear that Ivy and Liam are married. Maya drives a hard bargain but tells Ridge that she will be glad to come back as his lead model at FC but she and Rick are a team and he has to accept him back too. Begrudgingly Ridge shakes Rick's hand and says he is in too, just not as CEO, that position is filled. Liam has to go when Quinn comes in and says she has work for Ivy. Quinn tries to give her advice how to treat her husband. Ivy says she has dual citizenship so she does not have to have Liam to stay in this country. They did not have to get married and she needs to tell him that. He did this to help her but if he doesn't love her like he does Steffy then it isn't enough. Rick tells Maya that she handled Ridge well. She was incredible and FC needs her. They can never find another lead model like her. He is blown away that Ridge came to see her but she stood up for Rick and got him back in too. Wyatt tells Steffy that he knows it is not the jewelry that is putting that look on her face. She says she still can not believe that Liam married Ivy. Right on cue, Liam comes in and says he needs to talk to Steffy. She asks Wyatt to give her a moment. Ridge returns and Caroline says he was gone a long time. He fills her in that Maya would only accept it as a package deal, Rick comes back too. Rick tells Maya that Ridge hates him so he could have rescinded the deal. No one is going to disrespect her. She says he made his choice and so did she. He says she did not have to do this for him. She says Ridge gave her a second chance and she thinks he deserves one too. He wants to take this upstairs. Ivy tells Quinn that her marriage was a huge mistake. She only wants Liam to be happy. He loves Steffy. Quinn tries to talk her out of this that Liam did marry her without asking too many questions so he wanted to regardless of Steffy. Wyatt comes in and Quinn dismisses Ivy to go get some work started for production. Steffy is cool towards Liam. She asks if he has some work concerns to discuss. He asks her not to shut him out. He still loves her and he knows she still loves him. Ivy is listening outside the door when Liam says he does not want to lose Steffy. She says he can kick himself as long as he wants. How dare he ask her for anything. He married Ivy for as long as they live. He says no, only long enough until she got her citizenship. She reminds him she came running over to take a trip down memory lane so why didn't he tell her the minute she came through the door but waited until he told her that he married Ivy. She says again she can not do this. Ivy returns and tells Quinn that she just overheard Liam says he loved Steffy. He does not want this marriage and she is not going to trap him. Quinn tries to convince him that her love and commitment for Liam is real and she was desperate at the time. Ivy still says she can not do this. This is not who she is. She has to tell Liam that he does not have to be married to her. Upstairs Rick and Maya continue to kiss and he guides her to the bed. They say how much they missed each other.",
