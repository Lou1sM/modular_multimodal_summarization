Rick replied that it had been a long time since then. She claimed it hadn't been that long, and she wondered if the feelings were still there.\n\n\nRick said he was married to Caroline, and Maya was engaged to Carter. Maya felt that Carter was a wonderful man, but she asked why Rick thought she kept postponing the wedding. She reasoned that Rick and Caroline didn't have children, and it wasn't too late for Maya and Rick.\n\n\nRick said he'd enjoyed his time with Maya, and Maya recalled that they'd been two people completely in love. His world had scared her at first, but she'd grown to love everything about him and the Forrester family. Seeing his family rally around Ridge had made her realize how much she missed Rick and wanted to be in the family again.\n\n\nMaya felt as if she'd let things slip away, and Caroline had fought hard without playing fair all the time. Maya stated that she regretted giving up too easily, and she wanted another chance. Rick hopped up from his seat uncomfortably, and she guessed she'd shocked Rick with her honesty.\n\n\nMaya doubted that Caroline could make Rick happy the way Maya could. Rick insisted that he was committed to Caroline, whom he couldn't see his life without. Maya asked if Rick had any feelings for her. Rick replied that he cared about Maya as a friend and a coworker.\n\n\nMaya claimed that they could be good together and take the company to levels that he'd only dreamed about. Rick figured that everyone was emotional over almost losing Ridge, and it had probably messed with Maya's head. She insisted that she meant what she was saying. Rick said Carter was a great man who loved Maya. \"And I love Caroline,\" Rick uttered and left Maya alone in the steam room.\n\n\nIn the photo studio, Oliver urged Aly to take some photos, but Aly said Maya was the model there. As the couple kissed, Hope entered, looking for Maya. Hope had heard that the last shoot hadn't gone well, and Oliver responded that Maya had taken off.\n\n\nHope growled and asked if the two had noticed that Maya had been acting strange. Aly said Maya might return and do a better job. Hope relayed that they were in a time crunch because HFTF billboards had to go up in a month, and they wouldn't make it if Maya kept storming out of photo shoots. Hope felt that Maya was off her game. Aly said that nothing was more important to Maya than working at Forrester, and Oliver seemed to hold back on speaking.\n\n\nAfter Hope had gone, Oliver thought it was cool of Aly to stick up for Maya. Aly claimed to like Maya and hoped she wouldn't get in trouble. Oliver murmured that he thought Maya already was.\n\n\nOliver turned the topic back to Aly becoming the face of HFTF, but Aly insisted that she wasn't a model. He was confident that she had it in her. She let him photograph her, and in reviewing the pictures, he noted that she sure looked like a model.\n\n\nAly replied that it was because Oliver was an amazing photographer. It had been just for fun for Aly, but she was sure she'd freak out if the pictures went public. He urged her to see that she was the HFTF message and could represent it. Unbeknownst to them, Maya listened at the door as Oliver stated that Maya wasn't working out, and Aly should take Maya's place.\n\n\nAt the jewelry warehouse, Deacon startled Quinn, who was wearing a protective suit and helmet as she welded metal. He reminded her that he lived there, and she quipped that it was only temporarily.\n\n\nQuinn said she'd gone to see Liam to convince him to back off Wyatt, but Liam was being a bad boy. She believed it took extra prodding and poking to get through to Liam, but she'd tried to be gentle.\n\n\nDeacon said he'd gone to see Hope, and Wyatt had called during the visit. Deacon thought Hope still cared for Wyatt, and Quinn said Hope was in love with Wyatt. Deacon replied that he didn't know about all that, because Hope was committed Liam. Quinn ordered Deacon to do something about that, but Deacon retorted that Hope was a grown woman.\n\n\nWith a huff, Quinn demanded that Deacon convince Hope that she was angry with Quinn, not Wyatt. Deacon responded that there was only so much that even he could do. Quinn declared that Hope and Wyatt belonged together. \"It's what Wyatt wants, and deep down, it's what Hope wants. And more importantly, it's what I want more than life itself,\" Quinn asserted.\n\n\nDeacon and Quinn said they'd wanted to be good parents. Quinn wondered what was wrong with them. Deacon felt that his list was too long, but he could tell her what was wrong with her -- she needed to loosen the leash with \"sonny boy.\" She retorted that she'd at least been around for Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn declared that one thing was standing in her way and impeding her son's joy, and it was \"the gnat,\" Liam. She griped about the do-gooder Liam, who drove her nuts. \"Short drive,\" Deacon murmured. Quinn announced that she was going to kill Liam.\n\n\nDeacon laughed, but Quinn asked why he thought she was joking. Deacon kept joking around about plotting Liam's murder, and she asked if Deacon had ever killed anyone. He asked if she had. \"Never underestimate a mother's love, the sacrifices that she's willing to make for her children, no matter the cost,\" Quinn responded.\n\n\nLater, Quinn was alone, welding and seething over her past confrontations with Liam.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Wyatt arrived after receiving a message from Liam, who wanted to talk about Quinn. Wyatt was irritated by Liam's summons to discuss Quinn, but Liam said that the unhinged woman had taken her craziness up a notch earlier that day.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that Quinn wasn't crazy, but Liam showed Wyatt the small puncture wound on his neck. Wyatt thought it was an oversized freckle, but Liam asserted that Quinn had stabbed him with his sword, the same way she'd done to Bill. \"Oh, yeah, she does that. That's her thing,\" Wyatt replied.\n\n\nLiam deemed Wyatt to be just as crazy as Quinn. Liam exclaimed that she'd warned that Liam lived by the sword, and he'd die by the sword. Liam called it a death threat, but Wyatt said Liam was overreacting. Wyatt asked what Liam wanted from him. Liam said he just wanted Wyatt to answer one question honestly. \"How dangerous is your mom, really?\" Liam asked.\n\n\nWyatt called the question ridiculous, but Liam noted that Quinn had almost gotten Ridge killed. Wyatt believed that his mother walked a thin line but wasn't a danger to anyone. Liam exclaimed that Quinn was a liability to Wyatt and everyone who Wyatt knew.\n\n\nJust then, the front door slammed shut. Hope entered and precariously asked if everything was okay. Liam showed Quinn's latest stabbing wound to Hope. Wyatt called it a poke, and Hope flashed him an incredulous look. Exasperated, Wyatt apologized for his mother once again, but Hope said he shouldn't apologize because he hadn't done anything wrong.\n\n\nWyatt agreed, adding that he was paying the price for it. He complained that he'd lost his job and Hope, and there was no greater punishment than losing Hope. Wyatt stormed out of the house.\n\n\nHope offered to kiss Liam's wound, and he readily leaned his neck forward for her. Hope decided that Quinn was out of control. Liam thought the woman needed to be locked up. Hope added that they at least knew what Quinn was capable of, and Hope was sorry she hadn't seen it sooner. They hoped that Quinn's show was over and the stabbing had been the grand finale.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was at home when he heard a knock at the door. With an attitude, he answered it and said he didn't want whatever the trespassing person was selling. Deacon told Wyatt to think twice before slamming the door in his face. Wyatt asked who he was, and Deacon said his own name. \"Yeah, that Deacon. Hope's dad. Nice to meet you, too,\" Deacon responded. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Rick gets the surprise of his life during what he thought would be a relaxing session in the steam room. Deacon becomes suspicious of Quinn\u2019s intentions when he stumbles upon her latest project. Liam turns to Wyatt for advice regarding how concerned he should be regarding Quinn\u2019s threats. Maya overhears a conversation between Oliver and Aly that gives her cause for worry.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt knocks on the door and Liam tells him to come on in. He needs to talk to him about his mother. Wyatt grumbles that he called him all the way over here for that. Liam says he always knew his charming mother was unhinged but today took it up a notch. Liam says Quinn is certifiably crazy. Wyatt asks what can he do; she is his mother. She is overbearing at times and protective but she is not crazy. That's going a little too far. Liam shows him a spot on his neck and says no, this is too far. Wyatt asks if that is a freckle or a pimple. He doesn't know what he is looking at. Liam grouses that Wyatt's lunatic mother did that. She took his necklace and stabbed him like she did Bill. He says she looked him right in the eye and said live by the sword, die by the sword. That's a death threat. Wyatt tells him to come on, man, he's overreacting now. Liam says he does not know any other way to take it. He doesn't now that much about his mom but what he does is not good. Wyatt doesn't know what Liam expects him to do. If Liam expects him to talk to her, well he's not exactly talking to her at the moment. Liam says he is not asking Wyatt to fight his battles but just let him know just how dangerous she is. Wyatt says that is ridiculous. She interferes and does go to extremes and does walk a line but she is not a danger to anyone. Liam says she is a total liability to everyone he knows. While Quinn is working away at her factory with head shield and eye goggles, Deacon slips in and gets her attention. He tells her not to stop. He knows better than to get between a woman and her blowtorch. She asks him if he always walks into a place uninvited. He says he lives here. She says crashing here only temporarily. Then she says it is a welder, not a blowtorch because it can take a lot of heat. She says she went to see Liam today to get him to back off of Wyatt, but nope, he's going to be a bad boy. Deacon asks if she gave him a hard time. She says it took a little extra poking and prodding but she tried to be gentle. Deacon says he went to see Hope again and Wyatt called while he was there. She definitely cares about him. Quinn says of course she does; she is in love with him. Deacon says maybe but she is committed to Liam. She's a grown woman so what can Deacon do to change her mind. Quinn says all he has to do is convince Hope that Quinn was the one who screwed up, not Wyatt. They belong to together. It is what Wyatt wants, even Hope too. And it means more than life itself to Quinn. She says all she ever wanted to be was a good mother. Deacon says same with him ..just a good father. So what is wrong with them? He says his list is too damn long but he can tell her that she needs to loosen that leash from sonny boy. She scoffs that at least she was around and he says point well taken. She says there is only one thing standing in her way and that is that nasty little gnat named Liam. She hates people like that, a do gooder, holier than thou. He drives her nuts. Deacon says short drive. She says she is going to kill Liam. He chuckles and she accuses him of not believing her. He gets serious and asks how she is going to do it \u0096 drive over him, poison him, or shoot him. They both ask each other that question \u0096 have they ever killed anyone. She says do not underestimate a mother's love .the sacrifices she makes for her children no matter the cost. Oliver tries to talk Aly into modeling; she has what it takes. She says he is very sweet but Maya is the model around here, not her. He says her face should be on the cover of all the magazines. And Maya is not exactly working out now so Aly should take her place. Hope walks in and asks about Maya and they tell her that she bolted. Hope thinks she has been acting a little weird lately. Rick is very surprised to turn around and see it is Maya in the steam room. She tells him it is okay. It is not like it is their first time together like this. He chuckles nervously and says that was a long time ago. She says not so much. She still remembers what they had and maybe it is still there. It's not such a crazy idea. He reminds her that he is married to Caroline and she is engaged to Carter. She admits that Carter is a wonderful man but she keeps postponing the wedding because her feelings for Rick never went away. She did not appreciate what they had at the time But she is realizing it now. She knows he is married and she has Carter but it's not too late for either of them. Rick says he did enjoy his time with Maya. She reminds him they were in love and that scared her at first, coming from two different worlds. Then she realized his strength was his family and it felt good when she saw them all rally around Ridge celebrating him coming home. That love and that loyalty and she could have been part of that. She almost had it and let it slip away. Then Caroline fought hard and wasn't always fair and she won. But she can't blame her for everything. Maya says she gave up too easily but now she wants a second chance. Caroline can not make him happy for a lifetime like she can. Rick tells her again what a great man Carter is and dying to marry Maya. He loves her and Rick loves Caroline. Hope interrupts Liam and Wyatt and wants to know what they are talking about. Liam shows her his little boo boo by Quinn. Wyatt says it was just a little poke but he will apologize for what his mother did. Hope says that is not necessary as he did nothing wrong. Wyatt says but he is paying the price. He lost his job, he lost Hope and there is no greater punishment than that. He leaves them alone where Liam plays it up big time and Hope kisses his neck making it all better. He says Quinn needs to be locked up somewhere. Hope says at least now they know what she is capable of and she is sorry she did not see it sooner. Liam says at least it is now officially over and they don't have to have her in their lives anymore. Hope says Quinn's final show is over. That was her finale. Meanwhile Quinn is still working on something in the factory. Wyatt goes home and is barely there when Deacon shows up. Wyatt does not know him and tries to blow off this salesman or whoever he is. Deacon says he thinks he will want to think twice before slamming that door in his face. He will want to talk to him once he knows who he is.",
