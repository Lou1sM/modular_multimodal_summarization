Maya seemed to be unsure of herself, and he said she had nothing to prove to anyone. He felt lucky, grateful, and in love. He wanted her with him on the journey.\n\n\nMaya and Rick kissed and undressed each other. They fell onto the bed together.\n\n\nLater, Rick and Maya were wrapped together in the sheets, and she was amazed that she'd found someone who could love someone like her. Rick replied that there was no one like her, and he considered himself a lucky guy. They playfully kissed and canoodled.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge found Caroline bearing down on furniture, limping around the room. Sensing her frustration, he reminded her that it would take a while. With a groan, she said she knew it. She thanked him for his support, and roping him into her arms, she said she'd think of how to repay him.\n\n\nCaroline sat down to sketch but wound up tapping the pencil on the table. Ridge said she could design at home but seemed to be unable to do it at work. She replied that it was different. She felt out of sorts. Ridge told her to focus on him, and he asked her to walk to him. With one shoe and one rehabilitation boot on, Caroline hobbled to him. \"Good job,\" he uttered and kissed her.\n\n\nRidge seemed to get into kissing Caroline, but she playfully pushed him away and walked to him again. He swung her around and perched her on the desk, where they kissed. He then carried her back to her drawing chair and instructed her to take it one line at a time. He placed his hand over hers to help her draw the first line, and he encouraged her that it would work out in time.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Quinn tried to convince Ivy to think before telling Liam about her dual citizenship. Ivy was tired of thinking, and she decided that she was taking honest action.\n\n\nIvy left, and Wyatt entered to discuss an inventory shortage. He noticed that his mother was riled up and asked what she'd done that time.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Liam tried to convince Steffy that his marriage was temporary. Steffy said she understood that Liam was trying to help Ivy, but in the process, he'd destroyed what he and Steffy had had. Steffy told him to accept that it wouldn't happen for them.\n\n\nIvy entered and asked to talk to Liam. Steffy told Liam to talk to his wife, and she stalked out of the room. Liam tried to apologize to Ivy; however, Ivy replied that she knew how he felt about Steffy, and if he wanted her, he could still have her. Ivy said they'd known it wouldn't be easy, but she had understood that the marriage had been just two signatures on a piece of paper.\n\n\nIvy was grateful that Liam had helped her, but his feelings for Steffy complicated things. Liam conveyed that Ivy had been there for him, and he'd stay married until she had her citizenship. He refused to leave her out to dry. Ivy stated that she didn't need rescuing, and she couldn't be deported because she was already a citizen of the country.\n\n\nLiam stated that Ivy was a citizen because of the marriage. Ivy clarified that someone had made a mistake, and she'd been a citizen all along. Liam asked who'd told her that, and she explained that an immigration agent had visited her and confirmed it. She told Liam that she loved him. She'd hoped to be his wife someday, but not the way it was -- not with his constant desire for someone else.\n\n\nLiam stated that Ivy hadn't had to tell him the truth. Ivy said she had needed to tell him, and she wasn't going to trap him in a relationship. She stated that he'd deserved to know the truth, and Carter could draw up annulment papers. Ivy turned to leave, but Liam touched her arm.\n\n\nIvy said she knew that Liam loved her, or else he wouldn't have made the sacrifice to begin with. She wanted a future with him, but she wouldn't stop him from being with Steffy. Ivy turned to go, but Liam pulled her back to him for a hug.\n\n\nLater, Ivy returned to Rick's old office, where Wyatt was still trying to figure out what Quinn was uneasy about. With one look at Ivy, Quinn assumed that Liam knew. Wyatt asked what the women were talking about. Ivy stated that she didn't have to be married to Liam, who was free to be with Steffy.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Liam found Steffy, who accused him of stalking her. Liam said it wouldn't be the first time. She told him that it needed to be his last, and there was nothing more to be said. She didn't want to hear about his undying love for her. She claimed to have returned for him, and she didn't want to have to see him and Ivy around work.\n\n\nLiam told Steffy that he'd been wrong to marry Ivy without thinking of the consequences. Steffy asserted that he was married, and she was the other woman. She refused to play that role again. He replied that she didn't have to. He revealed to Steffy that the marriage was over.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Liam would let Ivy be deported. Liam explained that there had been a mistake, and Ivy had had dual citizenship all along. He said he hadn't had to marry Ivy, and even if he had needed to, he shouldn't have because he was totally nuts about Steffy. He asked Steffy to forgive him, and she hugged him.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Maya asks Rick if he is sure this is what he wants. Most definitely he replies. Caroline thanks Ridge for taking such good care of her and helping her at work. She is going to have to think of a way to thank him. Steffy tells Liam that Immigration is going to be watching him and Ivy for weeks or months .and she knows he is trying to help her but he destroyed everything they had going in the process. She reminds him that she loves him but he is married and they have to accept that. Nothing is going to happen between them. Ivy tells Quinn that she can not do this. She does not need Liam's help. She had dual citizenship although Liam does not know this yet. She is tired of talking, it is time for honest action now. She walks in on Steffy talking to Liam and tells him she has to talk to him now. When Steffy walks away, Ivy tells Liam there is a way he and Steffy can be together. Wyatt walks in and sees his mother all snippy and riled up. Liam tells Ivy that all they did kept her from being deported. She says that was not necessary. She will always love him for saving her life and being willing to help her. He's that kind of guy willing to help others. He says he will never regret that. She knows he and Steffy have history together and he loves her. She is a part of him. He says he will not leave her until she has dual citizenship. She says that is just it; she already does and can not be deported. Caroline tells Ridge that she can design at home but it does not feel right here at the office. He stands before her just far enough away and asks her to come to him. With one boot on and without the walker she does, twice and then gives him a big hug. When they kiss she pushes him even further back and hobbles to him unassisted again. She attempts one more time to do some designing. He tells her one line at a time and he stands near to guide her. He says it will take some time but she will get it again. Rick tells Maya that he is grateful. He loves her and it is their journey. Slowly he undresses her and they lie on the bed and make love like old times. She says she could not be more in love with him than right now. He says there is no one like her. He is one lucky guy. Liam is shocked when Ivy tells her that she can not be deported. It was a huge mistake. She is legal and it means he is free. He did not have to marry her. One day she wanted to be but not like this with his constant desire to be with someone else. He realizes she did not have to tell him this but did. She says he deserved to know the truth and now he does. She can draw up annulment papers. She will not stop him from having a life with Steffy if that is what he wants. He hugs her. Wyatt tells his mom that Liam is out of the picture so what could be so bad. Ivy comes in and explains that Liam is now free to be with Steffy since he does not have to be married to her now. Liam finds Steffy on the Roof Top and she asks if he is stalking her. She doesn't want to hear anything from him. He asks if he can say something. She says no as it will only make it worse. She can not handle it every time she sees him and Ivy. He stops her from going and says this might make a difference. He says the damsel in distress needed help but she is the other woman. He tells her the marriage is over. There was a mistake and Ivy had dual citizenship and they did not have to get married. Can she ever forgive him? They hug.",
