Liam didn't know if her words were a compliment or complaint. Steffy quipped that she'd try to make due with the horrible spa situation he'd created.\n\n\nA server arrived, and when Liam ordered double dishes, Steffy hit his arm. He claimed they were supposed to indulge on a spa day, and he wanted to make her the most pampered woman in the world. As the couple ate, Steffy wondered if they should cancel the massages. Liam said she'd been looking forward to them. Steffy hinted that she had a man with strong hands already in her cabana. Liam liked where her head was and reminded her that gratuity hadn't been included.\n\n\nLater, Steffy enjoyed herself as Liam gave her a back massage. She cooed that he was born to be her masseur. Liam decided that he couldn't do his job with her bikini strap in the way. Steffy realized that her masseur had ulterior motives, and the two kissed.\n\n\nLater, still in their swimsuits, Liam and Steffy cuddled on the chaises. She thanked him for forcing them to take time out for each other. He replied that nothing was more important, and she stated that nothing ever would be.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Katie and Wyatt discussed her new job. Wyatt thought the best thing he could tell Katie was to follow Nicole's lead. Katie said she had to learn the ins and outs of social media. Katie also wanted to keep the sexy CEO in the spotlight. Stammering, Wyatt replied that it would take up a lot of her time.\n\n\nKatie was embarrassed and guessed she'd said the wrong thing. Wyatt joked that he loved talking about how sexy his ex-wife was. Katie said she'd been stupid to mention Steffy. Wyatt dismissed it as not a problem, and he gave her a few tips on how to spotlight Steffy. He said a few photos with Liam wouldn't hurt. \"You still haven't gotten over her, have you?\" Katie asked.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that he probably hadn't, but he didn't plan to dwell on it. He had other things he could focus on -- like Katie's new job. \"Important things like me!\" Katie jokingly exclaimed. She said she wanted to start off with a promotional event and asked if he had any ideas. Wyatt replied that he did, and she'd really like it. \"Two words...Spencer Summit,\" Wyatt proffered.\n\n\nWyatt said everybody who was anybody would be there, and Monte Carlo was the place to make a splash, as Eric had with his speech the previous year. Katie wanted more than a speech. Wyatt proposed that it be a fashion show, and he envisioned Forrester couture on the beach. Katie said it was the French Riviera, so they should debut something different, like a swimwear line.\n\n\nWyatt believed it could be what Forrester needed to get beyond the Spectra debacle. Katie thanked Wyatt, and he bashfully replied that he was happy to help. Katie was excited to put the idea in motion. He offered to help if she needed anything. She asked if he were sure, and he said being a bachelor meant that he had a lot of time on his hands. He welcomed the opportunity to take his mind off things. Katie said she might take him up on it.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Charlie informed Sheila that she had no reason for concern about Eric. Charlie, however, was curious about her connection to Eric and why she hadn't recognized Pam. Sheila claimed that she'd known the family a long while back. Pam hadn't been around, but Stephanie had been a good friend. \"Old drinking buddies?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\nSheila described Stephanie as the kind of friend to take a bullet for Sheila and to be the first person to help with a problem of Eric's -- especially if it involved a new wife. From what Sheila had heard, she'd deduced that Quinn was good for Eric. Sheila asked if she was wrong.\n\n\nCharlie asserted that he wasn't a gossip, and the case was confidential. Sheila figured that something serious was happening if he'd been assigned to investigate. Charlie said she'd gotten it wrong, and he'd made the statement because he was head of Forrester security. Sheila replied that she felt much better knowing that Eric had someone like Charlie protecting him.\n\n\nCharlie said he'd do anything for Eric -- except modeling. Charlie said Eric hadn't asked, so it might be still on the table. Sheila asked if modeling had been the way that Quinn and Eric had met. Charlie stated that Eric could have married anyone he'd wanted to, but instead, \"He ends up with uh -- uh --\" Sheila gleaned that Charlie didn't approve of Quinn.\n\n\nCharlie stated that he hadn't said that. Sheila asked if she needed to talk to Eric about Quinn. Charlie said that if Sheila was such a good old friend, then maybe she should.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric and Quinn kissed. Eric joked about how distracting it was to work with his wife. He loved having his family working around him. \"And your neighbor,\" Quinn added. Quinn was glad he'd found a place for Katie. Quinn thought Katie could do anything -- except design jewelry.\n\n\nEric kissed Quinn's neck, and the door opened. Ridge apologized and tried to step back out, but Eric said he was just leaving. Eric asked Quinn to message him when she was on the way home, and he'd have a martini awaiting her. She asked if Eric knew what he meant to her. He replied that he was getting the idea.\n\n\nLater, Quinn worked at the table, and Ridge drew at the sketching table. He asked how she was doing, and she remarked that she felt better without anyone shooting at her. Ridge asked what Deacon had been talking about when he'd said she'd pushed him off a cliff. She asked if he was going to listen to Deacon's crazy rantings.\n\n\nQuinn was glad that Ridge had been there for Katie's call and remarked that almost losing one's life made one look at things differently. Ridge asked how. Quinn replied that it was in every way. It made her ponder what she was doing and who she wanted to be.\n\n\nRidge asked who Quinn wanted to be. Quinn wanted to be the woman Eric thought she was. Ridge believed she was that woman. He said she was already the wife she wanted to be; she just had to believe it. Agreeing, Quinn stated that she didn't know what had gotten into them. Ridge replied that it didn't matter, it was over, and they were friends.\n\n\nQuinn revealed that she'd gotten Ridge a present. Ridge asked why, and she replied that her friend had saved her life. She indicated that it was in the desk drawer. Ridge retrieved a bottle of tequila with a bow on it. He asked if she was serious. Quinn proposed that tequila just be tequila between them -- with no bad memories attached. Ridge liked it, and he thanked her.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Eric was surprised to answer his door and see Sheila on his stoop. She said she'd told him she was leaving town, but she'd had to see him again first. He let her in, and she asked if they were alone. He said that they were and asked what was going on.\n\n\nSheila replied that she wanted to know the same thing, and she couldn't leave Los Angeles until she knew that he was okay. Eric indicated that he was fine -- better than fine. She wondered what he'd gotten himself into. Eric appreciated that she still cared. Sheila said she'd always care and have his back. Eric was important to her, and she couldn't think of someone harming him.\n\n\nSheila insisted upon knowing that Eric was all right. Eric asserted that he was happier than he'd ever been in his life. Sheila hoped Quinn understood how lucky she was and what an honor it was to be in Eric's life. Sheila said she'd had it once, and she'd wasted it. Eric was happy that Sheila was making progress and trying to make amends, but for him, that was as far as it went. He didn't think it was appropriate for her to question his marriage.\n\n\nSheila hadn't meant to make Eric uncomfortable. She claimed to be happy if he was happy.  Glad to hear it, Eric began escorting her out. By the table in the foyer, Sheila said that, if things should change and he needed someone to talk to... Eric agreed to keep it in mind.\n\n\nSheila walked out the front door, and after Eric had closed it, she strode by the water fountain. Quinn was walking through the gates and passed the guesthouse, which was across the courtyard from the front door. She asked what Sheila was doing there. Sheila replied that she'd just been visiting Eric. \"No, you don't get to do that. Not when I'm not home,\" Quinn asserted.\n\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Sheila asked. Quinn elaborated that she didn't want Eric's ex-wives visiting unannounced. Sheila asked if Quinn had given Brooke that directive. Quinn said it was just for the ex-con ex-wives. Quinn was confident that Brooke wouldn't try to poison or shoot Eric. \"Yeah, I heard all the stories about you,\" Quinn added.\n\n\nSheila said that Quinn didn't need to be intimidated by Sheila. \"Oh, I'm not,\" Quinn responded. The answer was interesting to Sheila, who said it seemed that Quinn was. Sheila admonished Quinn to be a good wife, to appreciate Eric, and to know how lucky she was. Taking Sheila's arm, Quinn stated that Sheila needed to go.\n\n\n\"Don't you touch me!\" Sheila said, pulling back. \"You do that again, and I will snap you in two.\" Sheila continued. She knocked her shoulder into Quinn's as Sheila strode toward the gates. There, she paused and glared at Quinn, who was walking toward the front door.\n\n\n",
