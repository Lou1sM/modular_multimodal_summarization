    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the photo studio, Aly doubted that anyone wanted to replace Maya as the lead model. Oliver stated that Aly was younger, and she was a Forrester who embodied the line's message. Maya, who'd been listening at the door, scowled. Getting a thought, Maya smiled deviously and strode away.\n\n\nAly was flattered by Oliver's confidence in her, but she liked to be behind the scenes. She added that she liked Maya, who looked out for her. Aly thought Maya was a good friend and didn't want to put Maya out of a job. He murmured that they wouldn't want to do that.\n\n\nCharlie and Pam arrived in medieval costumes. Pam was upset because she'd finally convinced Donna to go to \"the castle,\" but after picking out an outfit, Donna had suddenly contracted the twenty-four-hour plague. Pam offered Donna's ticket to Aly, but Aly declined.\n\n\nPam was sad, but Oliver decided that he and Aly would both go to the event. He ordered everyone to the storage room for costumes, and Aly asked if he knew what he was getting himself into. Oliver had no idea, but whatever Aly was into, he wanted to be into as well.\n\n\nLater, Aly, Oliver, Pam, and Charlie arrived at the jousting event in full costume. Others in the crowd wore paper crowns and regular clothes, and Oliver wondered why no one else was dressed up. Pam claimed that the tourists didn't do it, but \"regulars like us\" did. Pam, Charlie, and Aly hyped up the pageantry of the upcoming event, and Oliver took Aly's hand and led her inside the theater.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Rick was distracted as Caroline chatted about a meeting she'd had. She guessed that the steam room had overly relaxed him. Rick murmured that he hadn't been alone in the steam room. She asked if that had been a problem, and Rick replied that it had been indeed because the person had put her hands all over him. \"Who?\" Caroline said, fuming. \"Let me guess -- Myrna.\"\n\n\nCaroline readily guessed that Maya hadn't set a wedding date because she still had feelings for Rick. Rick asserted that he'd set Maya straight because, in his mind, he'd married the right woman. \"Obviously!\" Caroline quipped. Just then, Maya strode in and said that they needed to talk.\n\n\nCaroline declared that Maya needed to be talking to Carter, not Rick and Caroline. Maya replied that Carter knew about it and had thought she was overreacting; however, she insisted that she wasn't. Maya started talking about Oliver, and Caroline asked what Oliver had to do with Maya hitting on Rick in the steam room.\n\n\nMaya was surprised that Rick had told Caroline. Hopping from his seat, he said Caroline was his wife, and he didn't keep things from her. Caroline wanted to know if Maya had been leading Carter on and pining for Rick for all that time. Maya explained that Rick and Maya's breakup had been sudden; they hadn't processed it, and they'd each been rebounding.\n\n\n\"Hardly a rebound since he was with me first, but whatever!\" Caroline retorted. Maya said Carter was a wonderful man, but she couldn't keep wondering what if. Maya guessed that she probably shouldn't have done it, but she'd had to tell Rick about it, just in case he'd been feeling that way, too.\n\n\nRick appeared to be extremely uncomfortable as Maya told Caroline that, \"I could have been calling myself Forrester, not you.\" Maya didn't think anyone could blame her for talking to Rick before committing to Carter. Amused, Caroline decided that Maya just wanted a bigger paycheck.\n\n\nMaya declared that she wasn't the gold digger in the business, but she knew who was. Rick recalled that she'd mentioned Oliver, and Maya asserted that Oliver was using Aly. Maya claimed that Oliver had used Aly's crush on him to get job security, and Rick needed to stop it before Aly got hurt.\n\n\nCaroline figured Maya was just panicking after hitting on her boss. Maya whipped out her phone and said she had proof. She played the part of the recording on which Oliver said he was willing to date the redheaded Forrester to keep his job.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Deacon said he loved what Wyatt had done with the place in which Deacon had once lived. Wyatt asked the reason for the visit and if Hope knew Deacon was in town or at the beach house. Deacon wondered why Wyatt, who was involved with daughter, had to ask.\n\n\nWyatt mumbled that Deacon wasn't up-to-date. Deacon stated that Hope was with Liam \" -- for now.\" Deacon said he'd seen Hope and Wyatt in the papers and had thought they might have been meant to be. Wyatt asserted that Hope was a different, more relaxed person with him. He wanted her back. He believed that Hope wouldn't admit it yet, but she wanted him, too.\n\n\nWyatt thought he, not Liam, was the right guy for Hope. Though Deacon had nothing against Liam, who was likable enough, Deacon thought something had to be wrong and keeping Hope and Liam apart for so long. Wyatt felt that something had stopped working a while back, but the couple had been accustomed to trying to get married for so long that they hadn't noticed.\n\n\nWyatt said that he'd given Hope a better option, and he was glad that Deacon had visited to get to know him. Deacon replied that he didn't want to give Wyatt the wrong idea because Deacon had merely been interested in meeting the odd man out. Wyatt asked Deacon to keep an open mind, and Deacon asked Wyatt to crack open a bottle of scotch.\n\n\nOver drinks with Deacon, Wyatt explained that he wasn't with Hope because of his mother, who'd been overly involved in his life. He wanted nothing to do with his mother anymore. Deacon thought that was harsh, but Wyatt said Deacon didn't know Wyatt's mother.\n\n\nWyatt wanted to show Hope that he could separate from his mother, who wasn't the kind of person Hope respected. He said his mother had no boundaries or fears and didn't care what she had to do or who she had to cross to get what she wanted. When he'd been younger, Wyatt had appreciated having a cool mother who'd bend the rules, but he said that she went a little too far at times.\n\n\nAt the warehouse, sparks lit up the darkness as Quinn diligently worked on her newest creation. She hammered out the metal and flashed back to the things Liam had said to her face about her.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam and Hope had a candlelit dinner and wine. Hope noticed that he was cheerful for a man who'd been stabbed. Liam dismissed it as a flesh wound, but she reminded him that he had to always be mindful where Quinn was involved. He replied that he was so happy about his future with Hope that he didn't care. He felt that nothing more was standing in their way.\n\n\nLiam was glad that Quinn had stabbed him. To him, she was digging herself in deeper and showing everyone how crazy she was. Quinn's scare tactics were making him more protective of Hope and clarifying to Hope that she'd made the right decision by ridding herself of the Fullers.\n\n\nHope prepared to go home for the evening, and Liam asked her to help him with something. He grabbed a jar and said it would be for honeymoon fundraising. Liam called it a swear jar, and Hope said she wasn't aware that they were having a swearing problem. He explained that it was for the \"Q\" word and the \"W\" word. \"In that case, I'll watch myself,\" she replied and kissed him.\n\n\nHope jokingly realized that if it was for their honeymoon, then she should say the words. The two kissed again, and as the wind picked up outside, they heard a loud thump. Hope told Liam that she was glad she wasn't spending the night because the house scared her. He asked if she thought he protected her. She giggled, saying that he always did, and they kissed once more.\n\n\nLater, Liam checked the doors to his darkened home as the wind howled outside. He seemed uneasy as he headed to his room to relax in bed with his tablet. Eventually, he shut off the lights and settled beneath the covers. As soon as he closed his eyes, he heard a louder clatter. Startled, he shot straight up in the bed.\n\n\nLiam grabbed a flashlight to check around the house. In the living room, he heard another clanging sound, and he investigated the terrace door in the kitchen. Suddenly, Quinn's menacing face appeared from behind the locked glass door, startling Liam. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Wyatt and Deacon become better acquainted over a bottle of Scotch as the details regarding Hope\u2019s love life are recounted. Rick makes an honest confession to Caroline which prompts her to confront Maya about her recent actions. Oliver attempts to convince Aly that she should be the new face of the HFTF line. Mystery continues to loom over what Quinn has up her sleeve next.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick tells Caroline that he was not the only one in the steam room. She guesses Myrna so no wonder she is putting off her marriage to Carter. Maya comes in and starts chatting about Aly and Oliver. Caroline doesn't know what this has to do with her being in the steam room with Rick. Maya says she did not know that Rick would be telling her that. They had a thing once and it ended so quickly that they never got a chance to process it. Rick was on the rebound. Caroline points out Rick was with her first so Maya had no claim on him. Aly tells Oliver that she is more comfortable behind the scenes. Quinn is in her factory finishing up on some welding. Wyatt invites Deacon in and wonders if Hope knows he is in town. Deacon says he used to live in this very house; he likes what he has done with it. Deacon says Wyatt is involved with his daughter so he doesn't have to ask why he is here. Wyatt says was as in the past. But he does admit he would like to have Hope back. She is fun and relaxed when she is with him, not uptight like with Liam. He knows she also wants him back. Deacon says he doesn't know Liam but he seems like a likeable guy. But they have tried to get married for so long that something must be wrong. Wyatt says he is glad Deacon came by and he'd like to get to know him too. Deacon suggests they open up one of those bottles of scotch as he is parched. Hope and Liam kiss and she is protective of his boo-boo. He scoffs it off as just a little flesh wound and he was glad to get it if it meant showing Hope how crazy Quinn really is and that she is better off with Quinn and Wyatt out of their lives. Maya tells Rick and Caroline that she is no gold digger but she had to be sure that Rick was happy before she moved on to marry Carter. It's Oliver that she is worried about with his coming on and hanging all over Aly to move himself up in the company. Caroline says no way about Oliver. Maya came on to her boss and now she is feeling guilty. Maya plays them the phone message by Oliver. Charlie and Pam in costume convince Aly and Oliver to attend the Medieval Nights with them. Wyatt tells Deacon that he does not know his mother, but she is the cause of his not being with Hope right now. She likes to cross lines and meddles as long as she gets what she wants. But sometimes she goes a little too far. The wind is howling and there is a thunderstorm brewing. Liam comes home and locks the doors, turns all the lights out, and flops on his bed. Liam hears a loud noise and jumps up and starts searching with his flashlight. Suddenly he sees Quinn's face in the lights.",
