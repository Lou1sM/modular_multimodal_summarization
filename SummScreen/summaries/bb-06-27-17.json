In the hallway, Katie and Wyatt discussed that Kate was excited about her new opportunity to replace Wyatt at Forrester. He suggested that she needed to capitalize on the Spencer Summit.\n\n\nWyatt reminded Katie that Eric had given a speech in 2016, but he suggested they go bigger. Katie thought a fashion show with Forrester couture would be the thing to do. Wyatt agreed, and they thought the French Riviera would be perfect.\n\n\nIn another office, Rick and Maya explained to Vivienne that Julius had thwarted their effort to get Nicole to sign the adoption papers. Rick was emotional. Maya, Rick, and Vivienne discussed that Julius had not been helpful, and Zende entered and agreed they had to stop Nicole's father from interfering. \n\n\nZende admitted that Nicole had struggled with the news that infertility could be in her future, but he noted that Julius had been causing trouble in regard to Lizzy. Maya and Vivienne agreed they had to stop Julius.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Steffy and Katie met to discuss what Katie could offer the company. Steffy reminded her she had big shoes to fill in replacing Wyatt. Katie agreed, but she pitched an idea to step up their marketing and push the swimwear line in order to take customers out of the showroom and out to somewhere luxurious -- the Spencer Summit in Monte Carlo.\n\n\nSteffy and Katie agreed it would be the ideal place for a fashion show. Steffy smiled. She agreed it was a hot, sultry idea, and she promised to pitch it to her dad. \"I'm really impressed,\" Steffy confided.\n\n\nAt home, Julius and Nicole discussed that Julius felt everything had happened for a reason and it was a sign from the heavens that Nicole should not allow Maya and Rick to raise the baby she had given birth to. He reminded her that she was the baby's biological mother.\n\n\nZende, Maya, Rick, and Vivienne entered and confronted Julius. They agreed that Julius had been leading Nicole in the wrong direction. They felt it was not his place to convince her to try to replace Maya as Lizzy's mom, and it needed to stop.\n\n\nZende made a heartfelt plea to Nicole to stop trying to replace Rick and Maya as Lizzy's parents. He reminded her that he was her husband, and they would deal with whatever happened next together.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam and Wyatt discussed the opportunity that Katie had at Forrester to replace Wyatt, and Wyatt noted that he was happy for Katie. He felt she would be a real asset to Forrester.\n\n\nWyatt felt that Katie was impressive -- she'd been a single mom with a full-time career and had basically run Spencer and Forester at different times. He was confident she could accomplish things at Forrester.\n\n\nLater, Katie called Wyatt to thank him for his advice on what to do to keep Forrester in the limelight. Wyatt said he had been happy to offer the suggestions. Katie said that Steffy had loved them. She felt guilty using his ideas, but Wyatt told her he supported her.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Katie pitches the idea to present a swimwear collection at the Spencer Summit to Steffy. Steffy is intrigued by the reasoned pitch and the suggestion to return to her modeling days and present some of the pieces. Over at Spencer Publications, Wyatt tells Liam that he already knows that Katie has taken over his old job at Forrester Creations and he could not have higher expectations for her to shine in it. Later, Katie calls Wyatt to thank him. R.J. and Coco take their first selfie as a couple and share it on social media. Maya and Rick are concerned after Nicole still has not signed the adoption papers. Their concern grows when Vivienne and Zende confirm that Julius has been interfering and is probably to blame for Nicole's sudden unhealthily attachment to Lizzy. Meanwhile, Julius attempts to convince Nicole that the hitch with the documents is a sign that she should be the one to raise Lizzy.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Back in the office, Liam congratulates Katie for her new position. He leaves her alone with Steffy. Maya and Rick explain to Viv about Nicole signing the papers. Viv says she is going through a rough time and just needs more time. Maya retorts that it is Julius who is getting to her. Nicole and Julius go home and Nicole says the papers are in her bag but she has not signed them yet. Julius laments he hopes she never will. This is not an accident; it is a gift from heaven. The baby should be with its real mother. Coco and RJ take a selfie and declare it official for the social media. Liam and Wyatt discuss Katie taking over his old job. He is not jealous. He thinks she will be a real asset to FC. They both agree she deserves a medal for even putting up with their father over the years. Steffy likes Katie's ideas. Katie tells Steffy she thinks they need to catch the public's eye, so somewhere with national appeal. She suggests the Spencer Summit. Julius tells Nicole that Maya has been selfish all her life and Nicole is now paying for it. If Maya was supposed to have a child then she would have come equipped for it. Nicole is making a tremendous sacrifice for Maya and it is just wrong. Katie calls Wyatt and says she cannot thank him enough. He says it is an amazing opportunity for her and he is more than willing to help. Julius tells Nicole this is a chance to right things. That child is of her flesh and blood. She carried her for nine months and this child is hers, not Maya's. Viv walks in and says she does not want to hear those words coming out of his mouth anymore. Zende says they may not get a family the way they imagined but they will get through this. What Julius is suggesting is not fair to Maya or Lizzy. Nicole made a promise and she needs to keep it. Just sign the adoption papers and get this behind them.",
