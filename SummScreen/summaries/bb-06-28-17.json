    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester house, Zende, Maya, Rick, and Vivienne confronted Julius and Nicole. Julius maintained that Nicole was the biological mother of Lizzy and should not give up her parental rights. Vivienne, Zende, Maya, and Rick disagreed.\n\n\nJulius wanted to make his case. Zende stopped him and told Nicole to look at him, not at her father. He reminded his wife that Lizzy's parents were Maya and Rick. Julius blasted Zende for interfering, but Vivienne ordered him to stop. \"Don't bully my daughters,\" Vivienne said.\n\n\nJulius argued that no one had sided with Nicole. Everyone thought she was a terrible person because the heavens had smiled on her and she'd had a baby and wanted to be the mother she might never get to be in the future.\n\n\nLizzy started to cry, and Maya noted that Lizzy could sense tension between adults. Nicole agreed. Maya asked Rick to put Lizzy in the den for a nap for a little while. Rick walked off with his daughter. Maya turned to her sister. \"Nicole, if you need someone to tell you you're not wrong, let it be me,\" Maya said.\n\n\nMaya noted that she and Rick should never have asked Nicole to become their surrogate. She was too young. Maya admitted that deep down, she'd known that, but she had spent a lot of years fighting for herself when she'd thought no one else would. She added that she had been selfish. \"But please don't take my daughter away,\" Maya cried. Zende agreed. He reminded Nicole how happy she had been to find Maya again.\n\n\nJulius said he blamed Maya for pressuring Nicole -- someone who thought she walked on water. \"Nicole, you are not signing those papers. That baby is yours,\" he said.\n\n\nJulius looked over the adoption papers and called them garbage. Vivienne interrupted him and told her daughters that they had to resolve the issue because she didn't want them to hurt each other in ways that might never heal. Vivienne pointed out that Julius had opinions, but that was not the whole story.\n\n\nRick returned and said the entire process wasn't complicated although Julius wanted it to be. \"I am still Lizzy's father,\" he announced. Nicole countered that she hadn't known when she had given birth how it would affect her later. Julius supported her and reminded everyone that Lizzy had come from Nicole's body. Julius defined that as motherhood, but Zende disagreed. He explained that the woman he called mother had taken him in and loved him without any biological ties.\n\n\nMaya agreed. She said that motherhood was the one thing she had wanted her entire life because she wanted to parent a child in a way she hadn't been parented. She wondered if Nicole had ever wanted something so badly. Nicole noted she had wanted Zende. Maya understood.\n\n\nNicole admitted that she didn't think Maya was a bad mother. However, she had never felt so much love as she had the day she'd given birth to Lizzy.\n\n\nNicole tearfully added that she wanted to feel that love again with Zende and their own family. Maya acknowledged that Nicole was only being human. Maya promised that if Nicole went to court, she would win, because Maya would not fight her.\n\n\nJulius announced that everyone should take notice of what they were witnessing. Julius credited Maya with being a lady. Nicole and Maya professed their love for one another. Rick returned and wondered what Maya was doing. She reminded him that they had always agreed that what Nicole did was her own choice. Rick, Nicole, and Maya cried.\n\n\nNicole looked to Zende and told him he was the only one she trusted. Zende told her she was his beautiful and amazing wife, who was strong and confident. \"I am on your side, even when you don't know what you want,\" he said.\n\n\nZende told Nicole that she needed to stop worrying about having a family. \"Miracles happen, and I'm one of them,\" he said. He added that his adoptive parents had saved him from the orphanage. He felt that they might be meant to adopt. He was grateful to his parents and happy that they had made the choice to adopt. \"I do know the choice is yours, and I'm behind you in whatever you decide to do,\" he said. They held hands.\n\n\nNicole turned to Vivienne and took the adoption papers from her. She sat down with a pen. Tears streamed down Rick and Maya's faces. Nicole signed the forms.\n\n\nJulius announced that he hoped no one in the room ever had a reason to regret what had happened. Maya and Rick tearfully thanked Nicole. They all cried and embraced. Nicole apologized for hurting Maya. Maya understood. \"I'm not her mother; you are,\" Nicole said. She and Maya embraced and cried.\n\n\nAt Katie's, Wyatt entered with one of Will's favorite trucks. Katie welcomed Wyatt into the house and asked him to stay for a meal. Wyatt was grateful for a homemade meal.\n\n\nKatie asked Wyatt's opinion of the idea to have the women wear swimsuits in the Monte Carlo fashion show while male models wore full suits and served them food and drink. Wyatt liked it. He wondered if Steffy knew he had been involved in planning, and Katie said she had not told Steffy. Katie felt she needed to pay him an hourly fee. Wyatt said he had enjoyed it. He left, and Katie looked thoughtful.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Maya, Rick, Zende and Viviene interrupt Nicole's tense talk with Julius in which he implores his daughter to back out of the adoption arrangement and instead raise Lizzy herself. They are shocked when Julius exclaims that Maya is putting her sister in a terrible position just because she will not accept the biological fact that she cannot have children. Vivienne encourages Nicole to listen to more than just Julius' words. A shaken Rick steps in and points out that he is Lizzy's father. Zende reminds everyone that family is more than just a relationship by blood as he is adopted himself. Eventually, Maya makes an emotional appeal and puts her fate in Nicole's hands who then picks up the adoption papers. Upon signing the documents, Nicole admits that Lizzy has always been Rick and Maya's child. Meanwhile, Wyatt pays Katie a visit and they further brainstorm for the Forrester swimwear fashion show. Katie and Wyatt realize that they make a great team and have a lot in common.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Zende tells Nicole not to look or listen to Julius ..just look at him. Lizzy needs her yes, but just to know how Nicole gave her life. Julius says just look at Lizzy as she is the only one that matters here today. Look at her eyes. They want Nicole to claim her. And while all the rest of them have their opinions no one is speaking up for Nicole. Maya speaks to Nicole and says if she needs someone to tell her she is not wrong then let it be her. She says she is not wrong. Perhaps she was wrong in asking Nicole to do what she did. She was too young and too trusting and deep down Maya said she probably knew that. She admits she can be selfish and she had always fought for herself when no one else would. So she has messed up and she hates how this situation has become so badly mixed up but please do not take her daughter away. Zende tells Maya no one blames her for wanting her family so do not blame herself. And Nicole has always said how good it was when she came to L.A. and met Maya again and they became close. Julius says Nicole thinks Maya walks on water and to deny her this baby she gave birth to is wrong ..just plain wrong. He turns to Nicole and says she is not signing those papers. He holds the papers and says they are nothing but garbage. And no court or no signature is going to change the facts of Lizzy's birth. Maya says she is not ashamed of it nor is she trying to cover it up. Vivienne tells them they can both be right but still wound each other. Both girls say they do not want that. Zende reminds them that the woman he calls mom is not his biological mother. She did not give him life but in a way she did as he does not know how long he would have lasted in that orphanage. Her heart and soul is what he is made of and he believes that Lizzy can have that with Maya. Maya tells Nicole that the one thing she wanted all her life was to be a parent in a way that she had not been parented. Nicole cries that she does not think that Maya is a bad mother. She remembers when Lizzy was born and she has never felt such love in that moment. Maya says Nicole is not guilty of anything but being human they both are. And if she goes to court she knows Nicole would win ..because she would not fight her. With Julius saying yes tear up those papers and Vivienne saying no, Maya cries that she knows how much Nicole loves Lizzy so this is strictly her decision. Wyatt shows up at Katies's door squatted down to floor level as he brings one of Will's trucks that he found in the executive elevator. Katie profusely thanks him as Will had been having an epic meltdown over this. She invites him in and says she will even cook lunch for them. He jumps at the chance not to have to depend again on take out. They discuss business and she thanks him and says she knows she has mighty big shoes to fill. Nicole goes to Zende and says she is sorry for what she is putting him through. He tells her that she is strong and she does not have to be afraid. He's on her side even if the doctors tell her she cannot have another child. Miracles do happen or they could even adopt. Do what his own mother did for him. He will be behind her whatever she decides to do. Slowly she takes the papers and sits down to sign them with everyone looking on. Julius is the first to speak and says he hopes no one in this room will ever regret this day. Maya thanks her and both she and Rick give Nicole a big hug. Nicole says she is sorry she hurt them and Maya is Lizzy's mother and always was. She believes Zende that they will have their own child someday.",
