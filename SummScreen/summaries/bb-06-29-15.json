He wanted to celebrate, but Ivy told him that he might want to hold off because she might not be married for much longer.\n\n\nIvy informed her father that she believed Liam wanted to reunite with Steffy. Ivy explained what had happened with Immigration, and John said she'd handled herself with the honesty and grace he'd raised her to have. Ivy wished Liam wanted her and only her.\n\n\nJohn urged his daughter to stay strong and asked how she thought her parents had stayed together. Ivy said it was because they were never in the same city. John replied that it was because they hadn't given up, and even though her mother probably wanted to strangle him, he was smart enough not to let a good woman go. He believed Liam was smart, too.\n\n\nIvy said she wasn't giving up, but she couldn't be blind to the history between Liam and Steffy. John felt that his daughter was strong, intelligent, and beautiful. He believed she'd be okay either way and said that Steffy had nothing on her. Ivy hugged her father.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Steffy expressed surprise that Ivy had told Liam the truth about her dual citizenship. Liam said that Ivy had integrity and knew how he felt about Steffy. \"How, exactly?\" Steffy asked. Liam thought it was a trick question.\n\n\nLiam said he was telling Steffy that he wanted her in his life, but Steffy asked about his feelings for Ivy. He admitted that he cared about Ivy. \"That's what I thought,\" Steffy snapped.\n\n\nSteffy asked what would happen next. Liam assumed he'd get an annulment, but she said it wasn't that simple. Her problem was that he'd gotten married in the first place. Liam admitted that he'd made the wrong decision, but he said it had made him see how much he wanted to be with Steffy.\n\n\nLiam didn't want Steffy to question what they had together. Steffy said the open-endedness made her feel uneasy. He claimed to be doing the best he could to figure it out without hurting anyone. Steffy replied that he was sorting through his feelings, but he hadn't said the relationship with Ivy was over. Steffy needed to know how he felt about Ivy.\n\n\n\"I'm wondering the same thing,\" Ivy said, entering the room. Ivy didn't want Liam to feel trapped with her, and she asked if he wanted an annulment. He mumbled that it would be for the best, and Steffy said it was only fair to Liam. Ivy told Steffy not to forget that Ivy had been with Liam long before Steffy had returned, and Steffy had been very unsuccessful at trying to get him back in the past.\n\n\nSteffy claimed things were different. Ivy agreed. She said the marriage had been a huge wakeup call, and Liam wasn't ready to let Steffy go yet. Liam nervously suggested that it wasn't the time for the conversation, but Ivy said it was fine. Ivy understood that Steffy and Liam had history that Ivy couldn't compete with, but Ivy also knew what was between her and Liam and that Liam loved her.\n\n\nIvy refused to fight with Steffy and said no man was worth Ivy's dignity. Ivy was confident enough in herself to know that she deserved a man who was completely committed to her and her only. \"We both do,\" Steffy asserted, her eyes narrowing on Liam. Ivy stated that she believed in her and Liam and the future they could have, but it all depended upon him.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Pam interrupted Ridge and Caroline's makeout session to announce that Ridge had a special visitor. Ridge exclaimed with joy when Zende entered the office. Ridge hugged Kristen's son and gleefully introduced him to Caroline. Ridge was excited that Zende wanted to intern at Forrester and thought it would be fun not to tell the other applicants that Zende was a Forrester.\n\n\nZende returned to the corridor, and Ridge explained to Caroline that Tony and Kristen had adopted Zende around the time of their African honeymoon. Caroline liked that Zende had character and wasn't trying to take advantage of Ridge for a corner office. Ridge joked that Zende probably would have gotten it, too. To Caroline, it was refreshing to meet someone who didn't want favoritism.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Pam handed out lemon bars to interns awaiting their interviews. Nicole arrived, and Pam assumed Nicole wanted to find Maya. Nicole said she was there for an interview. Pam hadn't seen Nicole's name on the intern list. Nicole replied that she was hoping for a second chance to prove herself and start anew.\n\n\nZende made room for Nicole to sit beside him on a bench. Nicole wondered if Zende knew that he was in one of the top fashion houses in the world. She asked if he knew about the Forrester family, and he said he'd heard that they were good people. She asked if he knew about their business model, and he replied that he was well-versed.\n\n\nNicole was sure there was a lot Zende needed to know, and she offered to use her connections there to help him out. She claimed that Forrester had been like a second home to her over the last months, and she'd built some solid relationships. She added that Maya was her sister, and she was determined to work her way up, just as Maya had done.\n\n\nPam announced that Ridge was ready to see the interns, and Nicole assured Zende that he'd do great. Pam led everyone into the office, and when Ridge saw Nicole, he explained to her that he was about to have a meeting. Nicole handed him a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and hoped he might consider her.\n\n\nRidge gestured to the interns and listed their scholarly credentials. He ended with Zende, who had a business degree and noted there was a lot of competition. Nicole knew her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 wasn't as good as the others. She apologized for \"coming on\" too strong in the past and behaving like a big shot who owned the place. She wanted a chance to pay her dues and work her way up.\n\n\nRidge asked the interns questions about the company and their interests. When Ridge got to Zende, Zende shrugged, saying he thought he dressed pretty well. Nicole tried to help by saying Zende didn't know much about Forrester, but he'd be a great fit. Ridge agreed and added that they all would. He gave everyone internships, and the crowd cheered.\n\n\nPam took the interns on a tour, but Ridge asked Zende and Nicole to remain behind. Ridge expected Zende to work hard and hoped his mother would visit \"now\" that he was in town. Nicole was surprised that Ridge knew Zende's mother, and Ridge revealed that it was his sister.\n\n\nNicole was floored that Zende was a Forrester, and as Ridge helped Caroline out of the office, Zende revealed that he and his uncle had just wanted to have a little fun by not revealing his identity. He said that it was cool of her to have his back, and he might still need her help around there. Nicole replied that it would be her pleasure.\n\n\n",
