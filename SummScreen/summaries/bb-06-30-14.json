    "tvmega_recap": "Pam and Charlie brings Oliver and Aly to the Castle for Medieval Knights. With wind howling, thunderstorm brewing, all lights out with only his flashlight, Liam hears a loud noise and checks out the place in and out. When he returns, he falls over something and has a nasty sprain. Enough that he calls Hope and tells her that it's probably not that serious but he's going to healthcare. Quinn comes in late and is questioned by Deacon as to where she has been this late on such a horrible night. She says she let him stay here a while but it does not mean they are going to be BFFs and share all their secrets. She is happy to hear that he went to see Wyatt and gives him a favorable review. Maya plays the phone message for Rick and Caroline where Oliver says his job is in jeopardy and if he has to date a Forrester, then he's willing to do it. Rick says no way will he stand for this. Caroline is concerned why Maya even taped the convo in the first place. It's not like she is Aly's best friend. And she warns Maya that her husband is not her best friend either so leave him alone. Liam is put on the boot and crutches by his doctor. Hope shows up and he tells her he can not prove it but he thinks Quinn had something to do with this. Hope says he is objective so just tell her what happened. He explains and says he is so sure he saw Quinn's face but now he's not sure he just conjured her up or she is that fast. When he looked around, no one was there. She goes to see Quinn and while Deacon is hiding and listening, Hope asks Quinn pointblank if she was back at Liam's tonight. Quinn denies it. Maya tells Rick that it is better to err on the side of caution and Aly should hear that recording. He agrees. He will not let someone stay on his payroll just to further their career. Maya tells Rick that Oliver monopolizes Aly's time at work. Caroline says they can not throw Oliver under the bus just on Maya's word who secretly recorded this without Oliver's knowing. And as far as Maya she should move on. She is not representing Hope's line by hitting on a married man. Rick says it is best for Aly to know before she gets in any deeper. He will be careful and Oliver will never see this coming. He will be able to tell by a glance or body language, something that will tip him off. Oliver kisses Aly's hand and says he loves everything about this night."
