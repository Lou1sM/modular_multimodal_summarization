Caroline welcomed Maya back to Forrester, and Maya also welcomed Caroline back after her accident.\n\n\nMaya asked about the accident in which Caroline had been hurt, and Caroline explained that one minute she had been walking, and the next she had been under a car. She added that Ridge had helped her start walking again.\n\n\nCaroline commented on Maya's situation with Rick. Maya said that Rick knew about her past and still wanted a relationship with her. Caroline chastised Maya for keeping it from RIck for so long. Maya agreed she should not have done that. She added that when Bill Spencer had told the world about her past, she had tried to do what she'd thought was best for Rick and the company by quitting her job and staying away from Rick so he could made a decision about his personal life with her and the business.\n\n\nMaya told Caroline to call her names including Myron and Myrna. Maya said that she could take it after all she'd been through. \"Take your best shot. Go ahead and hurt me if you can,\" Maya shouted.\n\n\nCaroline admitted she was bitter. She said that Maya had not been honest, and Maya had made a big deal of a few kisses that Caroline had shared with Ridge. Maya defended herself. She said that she had not lied, and she reminded Caroline that her relationship with Ridge might have started out as a few kisses, but it was clearly more than that.\n\n\nCaroline maintained that Maya had lied and manipulated Rick. \"I think you're a hypocrite,\" Caroline said. She added that Maya's cover-up was far more intense. But it was all over.\n\n\nMaya argued that she should have told Rick sooner, but she was the woman that Rick loved. She had grown up a boy, but that was not who she was. \"Rick has only known the real me,\" Maya said.\n\n\n\"I've moved on now, and I'm happy with Ridge,\" Caroline said. She said she wanted Rick to find a woman that made him happy. \"And he found that in you because you are a beautiful and courageous woman,\" Caroline said tearfully.\n\n\nCaroline added that she had grown up with two moms, and she had been teased throughout her school years. She said she couldn't imagine what Maya's life had been like. She and Maya were both tearful. \"I admire you and respect you because you had the strength and courage to be the woman you are -- someone that Rick is proud of -- one kick-ass woman,\" Caroline said. Caroline said she liked Maya just the way she was. They tearfully hugged.\n\n\nOn the Forrester rooftop, Zende and Nicole discussed the gym that was on the roof. Zende was impressed, and Nicole was surprised that Zende hadn't seen it before. Zende explained that he hadn't been to Forrester in a long time.\n\n\nNicole wondered about Zende's mother. She assumed that it was Felicia, but Zende explained that his mom was Kristen Forrester. Nicole figured that he looked like his father. Zende showed Nicole a picture of his dad, Tony, and laughed as he admitted that he had been adopted.\n\n\nNicole wondered if Zende had ever tracked down his parents. He explained the entire story about how his parents had both died of AIDS, and he had been raised in an orphanage. He added that he was not HIV positive, but his adopted father, Tony, was. Zende flashed back to his first meeting with Kristen and Tony in Africa. They had met when Zende had found a roll of film that Kristen had dropped.\n\n\nBefore Kristen and Tony had left Africa, they had visited Zende in the orphanage, and he flashed back to their meeting with all the kids and babies in the orphanage. Zende had announced that it was his home. Kristen and Tony had been shocked. They had been distraught that he'd lived there, but they had thanked him and left.\n\n\n\"I thought I would never see them again,\" Zende said to Nicole. But they had returned to get him and adopt him. He flashed back to their invitation to live with them. \"We missed you so much. We decided you could come live with us and be our son,\" Kristen had said. Zende said he had lived with them ever since in Miami.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Aly and Ivy discussed Ivy's marriage ceremony. Aly lamented that she could have been a bridesmaid. Aly encouraged Ivy to have a second ceremony so the family could celebrate, but Ivy confessed that there was nothing to celebrate. She shared that the marriage would soon be annulled because Liam had only married Ivy to save her from being deported.\n\n\nAly acknowledged that Liam cared for Steffy, and she added that Liam had stepped up to save Ivy. Aly wondered if Liam didn't want to stay married. Ivy said that Liam had feelings for Steffy. Aly said that Liam would not choose \"Taylor's slutty daughter over you.\"\n\n\nIvy was surprised that Aly had become agitated. \"Aly, there's no need for name-calling,\" Ivy said. Aly replied that Steffy had always used her body to get what she wanted. Aly added that Liam had proven he loved Ivy when he'd married her to protect her from deportation. Aly was sure he would do the right thing again. \"He better,\" she muttered.\n\n\nIvy said she loved Liam, and she hoped he would reconsider. But she knew he and Steffy had a strong bond and a lot of history. She doubted that Liam would decide to remain with her, but she still had hope. Aly encouraged her not to give up and hand Liam over to Steffy. Ivy agreed.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy met in Steffy's office. She discussed reintroduction of the lingerie line. Steffy teased that she didn't think an \"old married man\" could handle it. Steffy continued to tease Liam about his marriage. She suggested that Carter should give him a deal on all the legal paperwork because Carter had conducted the marriage and the annulment. Liam asked Steffy not to joke about his marriage. He cared about Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy said she understood. She knew that Ivy still believed they had a future together. Liam looked confused. Steffy said she wasn't happy about it. She reminded Liam that she would not wait around for him to decide who to be with. She added that Ivy needed to become a blonde because she was accustomed to fighting over Liam with a blonde, meaning Hope, and she didn't want Liam to confuse two brunettes. She laughed and told Liam to lighten up.\n\n\nSteffy said she had a much better idea for the use of their time. She planned to get his opinion on the new lingerie line. She changed into a blue lacy and satin outfit, and Liam loved it. Steffy teased that he had to touch the fabric, and Liam said they would sell out of it in a hurry. Aly entered and ordered Steffy to take her hands off Liam. Steffy and Aly argued about who Liam belonged with, and Aly was clearly agitated. Steffy shook her head.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Nicole shows Zende around. He hasn't been in the building for a long time so it's all pretty new to him and he's impressed with the Roof Top Lounge and all. He teases her but finally says he was adopted and he's a Forrester. She is sorry to hear the back story with his parents dying of AIDS. But Tony and Kristen visited his orphanage and adopted him. Aly wishes Ivy had told her so she could have been at the wedding. Ivy tells her no big deal as the marriage is going to be annulled. Aly can not believe Liam would marry her if he had feelings for Steffy. Ivy tells Aly that Liam stepped up and kept her from being deported. Then she found out she could not be deported after all. She wanted to be married to Liam someday but not like this. She is not giving up and she will not just hand him over to Steffy. Caroline stops in to see Maya and both welcome each other back in the office. Then they get honest about being back and how it feels seeing each other. She reminds Caroline that she was kissing Ridge and covering it up. Maya says her childhood was a lie and she is a woman and this is the truth. Rick has always known her as a woman, the real \"me\". Steffy jokes with Liam about his marriage. Carter married them and now he is drawing up the annulment papers, he should get some sort of discount. Liam asks that she not joke about this. So then she starts that Ivy needs to dye her hair blonde so he could tell them apart and her vie for his attention. She repeats again that she is not going to fight Ivy for him but as long as there is an annulment that is another story. Aly tells Ivy that she is too nice but she is not. Deep down Liam is a good man and there is no way he will pick slutty Steffy over her. Steffy models some lingerie for Liam who thinks she looks hot and it will sell out immediately. Aly walks in and sees the closeness and barks at Steffy to take her hands off of Liam. She tells Liam that he should see what Steffy is doing in trying to take him away from Ivy. She harasses Steffy for parading around in her underwear although Steffy reminds her they are working and this is her lingerie line. Maya tells Caroline that Rick knows about her past and he chose her anyway, so let that be the answer. Caroline says now he does but she kept the truth from him for a long time. Maya says she left the job and the man she loved because at that time she thought it was for the best so Caroline can call her any names she wants to .take her best shot and go ahead and hurt her if she can. She tells Caroline to tell her how horrible she is. Caroline won't but she says she does know how painful that was at that time in her life. She was judged by both her and Rick and now it brings up very bitter feelings for her. She does not agree how Maya handled things. But she is happy now and she only wants Rick to be happy too and if he found that in her, then even though she thinks Maya is a hypocrite she does respect her that she has become the woman she wanted to be. She opines that Maya is one kick-ass woman and they hug.",

Aly lamented that she could have been a bridesmaid at Ivy and Liam's wedding. Liam acknowledged that Liam didn't want to stay married to Ivy because he cared about her feelings for Steffy, and she said that she didn't know if Liam wanted to stay with her or stay with Steff. The couple's wedding would be annulled because Liam had only married Ivy to save her from being deported from the U.S. for being a sex offender, and he wanted to keep her as his wife, not as a sex slave, as he had always wanted to be with her. The two were married in a ceremony that was supposed to be a celebration of their union, but Ivy said there was nothing to celebrate because there was no wedding to celebrate. The wedding was held in front of a crowd of people, and Liam and Ivy were the only ones in attendance.\n"
