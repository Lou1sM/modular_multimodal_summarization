Ivy looked sad, and Carter suggested that she could sign them in a few days if it was too much for her to handle. Ivy shook her head and said that she had promised Liam she would sign quickly.\n\n\nCarter wondered if she and Liam were still together. Ivy said they were still dating, but she knew Steffy's return could change everything. Ivy signed the papers, and Carter promised to deliver them to Liam.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office at Forrester, Aly continued to berate Steffy because Aly assumed that Steffy had stolen Liam from Ivy. Aly was obsessed. Liam tried to calm Aly, but she ranted that Liam had loved Ivy until Steffy had returned to town.\n\n\nAly announced that Steffy always tried to use her body to get what she wanted. Aly noted that resurrecting the lingerie line was just a ploy for Steffy to tease and eventually return to Liam. Steffy rolled her eyes then finally laid into Aly. Steffy wondered if Aly would rather be massaging Maya's feet and making crab for Rick.\n\n\nSteffy reminded Aly that if Steffy had not returned, Maya and Rick would have continued to mistreat family and employees. Steffy promised things would be better at Forrester because she was president. Liam agreed, and he reminded Ivy that Liam's relationship with Steffy was none of Ivy's business.\n\n\nAly was not impressed. Carter entered and interrupted with the annulment papers. He told Liam they needed to get them processed quickly. He had pulled everything together, and Ivy had already signed.\n\n\nAly begged Liam not to sign the papers and leave Ivy. Aly grabbed Liam's arm and reminded Liam that he loved Ivy. He had loved Ivy until Steffy had shown up. Liam told Aly she had to let it all go. Liam left with Carter.\n\n\nAly ranted at Steffy. She said Steffy was a slut just like her mother -- her mother who had killed Aly's mother. Steffy gently reminded Aly that it had all been a terrible accident. She thought that Aly had accepted that.\n\n\nAly said she would never accept that Taylor had killed her mother. Steffy reiterated that it had been an accident, but Aly was undeterred, and she called Taylor a lush. Steffy was shocked, but Aly continued. Aly had a wicked look in her eye and advised Steffy to return to Paris.\n\n\nSteffy tried to reason with Aly, but Aly was out of control. Steffy suggested that Aly clearly needed a distraction. Steffy suggested that Aly get to work on her shoe line, but she didn't appear to be serious.\n\n\nAly glared at Steffy and said she had to defend the family -- or what was left of it -- because so many evil people had taken over the company. She was glad that Rick and Maya were gone, but she knew she had to keep the company from falling into the wrong hands. Aly said the family tree had poisonous branches.\n\n\nAly looked up and saw Darla's head. Darla encouraged Aly to fight for the family because she was the only one who could. Darla advised Aly to get rid of Steffy. Aly nodded. Steffy noted that Aly was distracted, and Aly admitted she had been talking to her mother. Steffy looked worried, but she dismissed Aly and said they needed to stay away from each other. Aly looked at Steffy with an evil stare.\n\n\nOn the rooftop, Zende and Nicole discussed their family relationships. Nicole explained that she was Maya's sister. Nicole added that she had learned about Maya's transgender status and had not been fair to Maya when they had first reconnected. Nicole regretted that she had expected Maya to take care of her, give her a job, and more.\n\n\nNicole confessed that she had made a mistake in trusting the wrong people with the information that Maya was transgender. Zende asked who had let her down, and Maya answered that Wyatt Spencer had told his father then Bill Spencer had told the world.\n\n\nZende agreed that Bill Spencer had had no right to make Maya's decision so public. Conversation turned to Forrester Creations, and they agreed that they were both excited to be working at Forrester for the summer.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Caroline and Maya shared forgiveness for all they had done to each other in the past. They were both emotional and thankful. Maya said that no matter what happened, she was glad they'd had that moment together. Caroline agreed. They held hands, and Rick entered.\n\n\nMaya shared that she and Caroline had managed to mend fences, and Rick was glad. He teased that there had been no welcome party when he'd returned to Forrester. Caroline and Maya laughed. Rick said he was glad to be working with Forrester International again, and he thanked Maya for striking the deal that she would not return without him. They all smiled.\n\n\nIvy sat in the office after Carter left, and Wyatt entered. Wyatt had overheard that Ivy and Liam were getting their marriage annulled. Ivy shared that she had believed Liam when he'd said he was over Steffy. Ivy asked if Wyatt was over Hope, Wyatt hesitated and answered affirmatively, but he was unconvincing.\n\n\nIvy wished that Steffy would get her own boyfriend. Wyatt said that he was in the running. Ivy was surprised, and she demanded that Wyatt dish on his relationship. He said he'd kissed Steffy twice, but he said they had not dated yet. He hoped Steffy would be over Liam before they went out. Ivy was hopeful.\n\n\nWyatt said if things worked out, he could end up with Steffy, and Liam and Ivy could remain together. They both smiled, and Liam overheard their conversation as he was listening at the door.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy asks Aly if she needs some water or a sedative or something. Aly glares at her and tells her not to patronize her. What kind of woman is Steffy, parading around in her underwear in front of a man she knows is taken. Steffy says she does not have to explain herself, she and Liam were working. Aly chastises Liam for betraying Ivy when she has been so loving and trusting and been nothing but good to him. Wyatt walks in while Ivy is talking to Carter about the papers and tells Wyatt she is officially ending her marriage. Zende tells Nicole that he really likes his family not for the money and power but they are really good people. She says she only knows Rick well and pretty much the entire world knows her sister is a transgender. She hopes Zende doesn't have anything against that. She tells him she barely knew her sister at home but she is very proud of her now. Maya tells Caroline that she really blew her away by expressing herself. Caroline says she could not judge Maya as she herself has two moms. She knows the courage and strength of character it takes. Maya says coming from Caroline that means so much. Caroline also apologizes for what her Uncle Bill did to out Maya. She handled that with grace and dignity and she has been an example for everyone. Rick walks in and is happy that they are getting along so well. Maya says no matter what else happens, she will always remember this moment and how much it means to her. Ivy tells Carter that she wants to finalize this as soon as possible. She tells Wyatt the only reason they married was to keep her from being deported. He says sure, but this did not have to happen. She says she knows and trust her, she is not just handing Liam back over to Steffy. He realizes it is turning her world upside down though. She says the hard part is she believed Liam when he said that he was over Steffy. Wyatt says he believes Liam thought that too. He reminds her that she is beautiful and smart and very unique and Liam knows she is a good person so he won't give up on her so easily. Aly snarls at Steffy and asks why she came back anyway, no one needed her here. Steffy counters with that is not true. Her dad would not be CEO if not for her. And Aly would still be making crab dip and massaging Maya's feet so a little gratitude wouldn't be out of order. Then she suggests they drop all of this and change the subject. Carter brings the papers in and Aly jumps all over Liam and asks him not to sign the papers. He can not simply give up on Ivy. He loves her so do not throw her away. Caroline asks Rick if they can address the elephant in the room. There is a new reigning couple now and the staff is much happier. Can Maya and Rick be okay with that. Both agree they can. He says he thought he might never get a chance to set foot in this building again. So while he is not CEO he is happy to be at FC again and it's all because of this beautiful woman. Maya gloats there is no FC without Rick. Zende tells Nicole that he knew abut Maya as he tries to keep up with things around here. Bill Spencer was wrong and should have given her a chance to disclose herself. Nicole admits it was mainly her fault. She trusted the wrong person, Wyatt, by telling him. She looks at Zende and says something tells her this is going to be a great summer. Ivy tells Wyatt that Steffy needs her own man so she will stop sniffing around hers. Wyatt says he is willing and able and standing right here. He likes Steffy, even kissed her and she kissed him back. So if he and Ivy play their cards right maybe Steffy and Liam won't be a couple after all. Liam tells Aly that she needs to dial it back. This is between him and Ivy. Aly tells Steffy that she knows she is used to getting any man but she blew it this time. And she will not stand by and watch her take Liam away from Ivy. Steffy tells her not to even think about it. She knows she has issues but she will not let her talk to her this way. Aly snarls that yes she has issues, Steffy's mom killed her mom. She mowed her down with a car. Steffy can't believe she is bringing that up now after all these years. She reminds her it was an accident. Aly says Taylor was a lush and a slut just like Steffy, using their sexuality to get whatever they want and now dismantling good people like Ivy and Liam. Aly even suggests that Steffy go back to Paris. Steffy says they are family and they need to get along. Aly glares at her again and says Ivy is her family too but she did not cut her any slack by taking her man. Her family tree has poisonous branches members who use people even hurt and kill them and she will not let that happen again on her watch. Steffy turns her back and tells Aly to redirect her focus, maybe on her shoe line. Darla appears before Aly and tells her that she has to be the one. She could not save Darla from Steffy's drunk mom but she can save the family from Steffy now. Get rid of her! Steffy catches her and asks what is up with her. Aly says she was just talking to her mom, she's a saint. She may not be here on this earth but she is always with her. She knows Steffy thinks that is weird but it's true. Steffy tells her just stay away from her and all will be fine. Darla appears again and tells Aly to get rid of Steffy.",
