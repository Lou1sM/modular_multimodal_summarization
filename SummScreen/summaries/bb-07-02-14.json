Deacon accused Quinn of trying to hurt Liam. Quinn denied it. She maintained that she would have her revenge when Hope dumped Liam. \n\n\nQuinn called Deacon a sneaky little girl. Deacon warned Quinn not to speak to him so disrespectfully. Quinn told him to go pick up another worried mother in a bar.\n\n\nQuinn locked up some stuff in a case and packed it away. Deacon watched from a distance. He entered and told her she was out of out of beer. Quinn advised him to get a job, but Deacon reminded her that he was her lifeline to Hope. Quinn prepared to leave, but Deacon grabbed he arm and advised her to pick up some beer when she returned.\n\n\nAt Rick and Caroline's, Rick played the recording that Maya had in which Oliver had stated that he would put up with Aly if it helped him hold on to his job. Rick demanded to know if Oliver had been using Aly. Oliver said the private conversation had taken place months earlier.\n\n\nOliver added that he had fallen in love with Aly since then. Caroline was convinced, but Rick looked at Oliver sternly. Oliver admitted that the recorded conversation had taken place after Ridge had fired him, and he had been angry at the time. He'd wanted to sound like he was in control when he had been talking to Maya.\n\n\nRick wondered why Oliver had been attracted to Aly. Oliver said that Aly was intelligent and from a great family. \"This is real,\" Oliver said. Oliver said that if Rick fired him, Oliver didn't want Rick to tell Aly about the recording because it would hurt her. Rick looked at Caroline, and Caroline sympathized with Oliver.\n\n\nOliver assumed that Rick had recorded the conversation, but Caroline confided that Maya had recorded it. Caroline said that Oliver had a right to know what Maya had done. Rick vowed to keep his eye on Oliver and not play the recording for Aly. Oliver understood. Oliver left.\n\n\nLater, Rick defended Maya to Caroline for telling Rick about Oliver, but Caroline defended Oliver. Caroline said they had no right to break Aly's heart. Rick agreed.\n\n\nAt home, Aly looked up words to describe her date with Oliver before she sent a text to Oliver. She looked up delightful in a thesaurus to describe her evening. She settled on lovely because it had the word love in it.\n\n\nAly talked to Darla's ghost about how she had felt she might be in love. Darla said Oliver seemed like a nice guy. Darla suggested that Aly would know she was in love when she truly knew herself.\n\n\nAly flashed back to going swimming with Oliver and kissing him. She recalled the evening at the Medieval fest. Aly went to bed, but her cell phone rang. Oliver called, and Aly said she had been wishing that Oliver would call. Oliver told her how much she meant to him. \"Don't forget that,\" he said.\n\n\nAt the Bikini Bar, Hope entered and ordered a veggie burger to go. She called Liam, who had applied ice to his ankle. Liam admitted that his nerves were shot. Hope said she had confronted Quinn. Hope said that Quinn claimed she had not been at Liam's house. Liam said she was lying. Hope offered to stay with Liam, but he said the painkillers had kicked in. They exchanged \"I love you's\" and said goodnight.\n\n\nWyatt joined Hope at the bar. He suggested that she run away so that he could chase her. She could fall down, and he could pick her up -- just the way it had all started for them. He wanted to start all over. Hope smiled. \n\n\nWyatt said he wasn't stalking Hope. He said he had been looking for her, though. Wyatt shared that Deacon had shown up at Wyatt's house. He wanted to tell her so she wouldn't hear about it later. Hope admitted that she had been at Quinn's. Wyatt wanted to cut his apron strings with his mother.\n\n\nHope explained what had happened at Liam's and that the door had been open and Liam had seen Quinn. \"Do you want me to talk to her? You can ask me anything,\" Wyatt said. Hope agreed. Wyatt said he would never stop wishing that Hope had stayed with him. He promised to focus on his career. He said he hoped to appear on magazines \"that Liam doesn't publish.\"\n\n\n\"No matter what I accomplish, it's never going to make up for losing you,\" Wyatt said. He added that he had to figure out how to make his life about something other than Hope.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam went to bed, but he was terrified. He heard creaking and what sounded like a door opening. He walked out into the living room with a flashlight, and Quinn appeared and called him \"a whiny little bitch.\"\n\n\nQuinn promised to kill him. \"What do you want from me?\" Liam asked. Quinn insisted that Liam had to get Wyatt's job back for him, but Liam said that Quinn had burned that bridge with Hope. He said he had no control over Wyatt's job.\n\n\nQuinn seethed that Liam needed to leave Wyatt and Hope alone. She ordered him to go to Paris and stay with Steffy. Liam wondered if Quinn was going to stab him with his sword. She pushed him back on the couch and grabbed his shirt. \"I'll kill you and Hope, too, before I see Hope with you. Live by the sword, die by the sword,\" Quinn sneered. Liam looked terrified.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Suspicious about what Quinn has been up to, Deacon questions her regarding her whereabouts earlier in the evening. Head-over-heels for Oliver after their magical night together, Aly pens a love note to him. Oliver justifies his feelings for Aly when Rick and Caroline confront him about the voice recording. Wyatt assures Hope that Quinn might be manipulative, but she isn\u2019t dangerous. Liam awakens to a nightmare.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Oliver hears Rick ask if that is his voice on the recording where he said that the Forrester's are incredible people and he could be apart of it. Yeah he'd put up with Aly if she liked hanging out with him, no harm. Rick says it sounds like he is using his niece. Oliver says that was a private conversation recorded months ago and he barely knew Aly then. He didn't decide to fall in love with her but he did. Rick is not sure he is convinced. Oliver reminds him that Ridge was not a fan of his or his work. He appreciates Rick handling that but things got pretty shaky. He was angry and jealous and felt like a failure. So yes he sounded hard and cold in that conversation like a guy who didn't get hurt but hurt other people instead. But he was attracted to Aly for a lot of reasons and none of this was planned. He says he understands if Rick has to fire him but please do not use the recording to hurt Aly. It will only put her back there in that rage where she was most of her life. Rick agrees and says he has told Maya that too, but he will be watching Oliver. Wyatt asks Hope what is it that Liam is afraid of. She says his mother and her craziness. Wyatt admits that Quinn is single-minded and manipulative but not physically dangerous. He says he has been isolating himself from her until she stops leading his life but he will talk to her again. She says she has no right to expect that of him. He says she can ask him anything at all any day of his life whether he spends it with her or not. Oliver calls Aly and she says she has telepathic powers as she was hoping he would call and he did. He says they had fun tonight and he wants her to know how much she means to him ..never forget that. Meanwhile Aly is writing in her diary that tonight was like being in love. She asks her ghost mother how will she know. Darla says if it is not love she will know right away. If she thinks it is she needs to know herself. Deacon tells Quinn that apparently his daughter is no marshmallow and that little crack Quinn had made about him was not called for. She doesn't want him to see her work, saying it will jinx a work in progress. He tries to get her to admit that she was at Liam's. She asks why and he says maybe revenge. Quinn says she will get that when Hope dumps him. Deacon doesn't think that will happen anytime soon. Quinn says he should get a job and not freeload off the women in his life. He sets her straight that she is NOT a woman in his life. She says fine, go sleep on the street or better yet go pick up another worried mother in a bar. Deacon reminds her that she is out of beer. She wonders how that is her problem. He says she is the woman of the house and thought she'd like to know. She snarls that this isn't a house. This is a live/work space .but maybe he is not familiar with that middle word work. He answers that he thinks he is earning his keep while deciding if he will support a relationship between his daughter and her son. She wonders if Hope will even listen to him. Deacon says judging by her little visit which he overheard Hope trusts him more than he does Quinn right now. Quinn says that she is going out. He quips to remember to bring back the beer. He meanders around the place and spies this rather large locked tool box. He gets it out and a hammer and considers breaking the lock or at files and picking it, but resists. At The Bikini Hope orders a veggie burger to go. She calls Liam who said someone drove him home. His nerves are shot and because of the awesome pain pills he's pretty wiped out for the night. She tells him that she went to see Quinn and she said she was not outside Liam's house earlier. Liam quips that she is so trustworthy that they should believe her. She asks if he is sure he really did see Quinn. Liam says ask him again after eight hours of sleep. Hope tells him to call her if he needs anything. Wyatt walks to Hope and tells her that if she runs and she chases her and she accidentally falls and hits her head heaven forbid could they start over. He swears he is not stalking her. He says he comes here every now and then just to see who is hanging out. She says she will let him know if she feels nervous. He says actually he was hoping to see her tonight since Deacon had stopped by his house. Guess he wanted to see the other man in Hope's life, the problem man. He did not want her to hear about it later and he not have told her. He says he has been a lot of that lately, not saying what needed to be said when it was needed. She says that is funny since she just came from Quinn's. She asks if he is curious why she saw Quinn tonight. Wyatt says no, he is trying to distant himself from her. Hope tells him Liam is on crutches and how he got there. He tells her that he knows she thinks he will get over this .meet someone else, get married, have kids and have a happy home life. And maybe that is a possibility for his future but he hopes not .'cause he will never stop wishing it were her. Maybe he will just focus on his career. He's got a good business head and lot of experience for his age and he could get on magazines, hopefully ones that Liam doesn't publish. But no matter what he accomplishes, it won't make up for losing Hope. He just can't figure out what to do with his life with that one failure. Suddenly Quinn is inside the house. Liam on crutches backs away inching further and further away from her. She accuses him of running to Hope as the gnat, the spineless vertebrae that he is. She pushes him back on the couch. Liam wants to know what she wants. She says to give Wyatt his job back. Liam says he has no control over that. And with Quinn's track record, Hope won't have control either. Quinn tells him to let Wyatt and Hope be happy .go to Paris, be with Steffy, go to work in the New York offices, just leave Hope alone. He jokes what is she gonna do, kill him with a bunch of little stab wounds. She grunts that she will kill Hope too before she sees her with him. Remember .you live by the sword, you die by the sword.",
