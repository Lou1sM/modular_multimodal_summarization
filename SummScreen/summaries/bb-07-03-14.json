Wyatt was trying to do inventory and get sales together because they needed as much revenue as they could get because the Forrester contract was gone. Quinn told him not to worry about it, and she was certain that Hope would soon take him back.\n\n\nWyatt asked why Quinn would think that. He said that Liam thought Quinn had been at his house the other night. \"You weren't there, were you?\" Wyatt pointedly asked. He relayed that Hope had said Quinn had denied it, and Quinn became excited that he'd talked to Hope. Wyatt ordered Quinn back onto the subject, and Quinn replied that it had been what she'd \"told\" Hope.\n\n\nWyatt yelled that he'd told Quinn to stay away, but she'd gone there anyway. He demanded to know what she'd done to Liam. She claimed that she hadn't done anything, but Wyatt stated that Liam had a sprained ankle. Giggling, she remarked that Liam hobbling on crutches was a pathetic sight. She rejected the idea that it was her fault that the spineless wimp had tripped and fallen.\n\n\n\"Was it?\" Wyatt knowingly asked. Quinn stated that if she wanted to hurt Liam, he'd have more than a sprained ankle. She claimed that she'd gone to the cliff house merely to talk some sense into Liam. Wyatt argued that she'd done what she always did -- interfere -- and it was the reason Hope had chosen Liam. Wyatt ordered her to stay off Liam's property and out of Hope and Liam's lives.\n\n\nQuinn readily agreed to the demand, but Wyatt seemed skeptical. She claimed she'd only gone there for Wyatt, who was the man for Hope. Wyatt gave her an aggravated look and stormed out.\n\n\nDeacon entered. He said it was no wonder that Liam had fallen all over himself while trying to get away from her; her own son didn't want to be in the same room with her. She told Deacon not to make her regret letting him stay there.\n\n\nIn Quinn's view, she was doing what was best for her child, who'd lost his confidence and didn't think he could compete with Liam. Deacon quipped that she hadn't been giving Wyatt a pep talk, and Wyatt didn't want her involved. Quinn yelled that someone had to fix it, and if Wyatt wouldn't, she would. \"Or make it worse!\" Deacon yelled back.\n\n\nQuinn retorted that Deacon was the last one who should give her parental advice. Deacon said he'd learned from his mistakes, and if Quinn would get off her high horse, she could learn, too. Quinn contended that he'd abandoned his children and sold out his daughter, and he only cared about himself.\n\n\nQuinn didn't care what happened to herself. Wyatt's future and happiness were all that mattered. Deacon said if she meant it, she'd to do what Wyatt wanted and get out of Wyatt's love life.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Hope was headed out early. Bill mentioned that HFTF was the main attraction while Ridge was recovering. Brooke said Katie was taking good care of Ridge. Bill shifted uncomfortably as Brooke added that Quinn went nuts when she couldn't get what she wanted.\n\n\nHope left, and Bill and Brooke discussed that he'd given Liam the day off to heal his ankle. The topic turned to Quinn. Brooke told Bill that he hadn't cheated on her; however, he'd kept secrets, and Quinn had used that to her advantage. He replied that it hadn't worked. Brooke remarked that because Quinn was Wyatt's mother, there was no getting Quinn out of their lives.\n\n\nBill thought he'd had the whole wedding day planned perfectly, but he hadn't planned upon Ridge. Brooke said one had to expect a few surprises during an adventurous wedding. The couple flashed back on their wedding day. Bill said that they'd been moments from being married. Brooke replied that they'd get there. Bill wondered what they were waiting for.\n\n\nBill suggested going to the courthouse the next day, but Brooke wanted to plan a new wedding in town with their families in attendance. She wanted the wedding to be a glimpse of how the family could put their differences aside for a new beginning. Bill was agreeable but said it would be a tall order.\n\n\nBrooke noted that Hope was still cool to Bill, but Brooke said betrayal was a hot button for Hope. Bill noted that he hadn't betrayed Brooke. She agreed and hoped the wedding would be a chance to put blame aside. Bill asked if it would be a wedding or a group therapy session.\n\n\nBill received a call, and as he went upstairs to take it, Brooke heard a knock at the door. Surprised, she pulled it open and grimaced upon seeing a smiling Deacon on her doorstep. Her first question was what he was doing there. He said he'd wanted to let her know he was back in town.\n\n\nBrooke asked how long he'd be there and if \"Little D\" was with him. Deacon said Little D was in school and doing great. Deacon relayed that he was between jobs and staying with a friend. Brooke concluded that he didn't have a job or a place to live. He replied that he was open to new opportunities. \"I can't offer you anything, Deacon,\" Brooke quipped.\n\n\nDeacon had kind of figured that. Brooke added that she didn't want him bothering Hope, who was in a good place in her life and was happy. Deacon replied that Hope was happy with Liam. Deacon was determined to show Hope and Brooke that he wasn't the same guy. He wanted to live his life with gratitude and be in the present, which meant admitting that he'd been a real jerk in the past.\n\n\nDeacon confessed that he'd been bad news for every person he cared about. He was determined to fix his relationship with Hope, but he didn't want to do it if it upset Brooke. He knew he didn't deserve another chance, but if Brooke would let him, he'd like to try to earn it.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam stared at his patio door and shuddered as he flashed back on Quinn's previous night's visit. Hope arrived, and in a sexy voice, she offered to play nurse for a few hours before work. She asked if he was taking his medication, but he said he'd stopped to keep a clear head. Liam looked uneasy and distracted, and she asked what was wrong. He revealed that Quinn had been there the night before, and she'd threatened to kill them both.\n\n\nHope was flabbergasted by the announcement, and she didn't think the threats made any sense. She said that Wyatt believed that Quinn wasn't dangerous. Liam replied that Wyatt wasn't even talking to his mother, so he had no idea what was in Quinn's head.\n\n\nHope whipped out her phone and called Wyatt, who was at his beach house. She asked to see him immediately at Liam's house. After the call, Liam said he agreed that Wyatt should know, but Liam doubted there was anything Wyatt could do about Quinn. Hope insisted that Wyatt had to be able to do something because Quinn had to be stopped.\n\n\nLater, the unhappy Wyatt arrived. He said he'd heard that Quinn had been at the cliff house the previous night. Liam asked what his half-brother would do about it, and Wyatt responded that he'd told her to stop. Liam quipped that it wouldn't be good enough. Wyatt told Liam to dial it back because Quinn hadn't touched Liam's ankle, and Liam retorted that Quinn had done worse than that.\n\n\nHope asked if Wyatt had gotten through to Quinn, and Wyatt replied that Quinn knew what he wanted. Liam felt that Wyatt's desires weren't even Quinn's objective anymore. Liam insisted that Quinn had gone dark, and it had become about getting rid of anyone who made Wyatt unhappy.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Hope had asked him there to subject him to Liam complaining about Quinn. Liam asserted that Quinn had threatened Liam and Hope's lives, and Quinn had said that if he didn't go to Paris and back to Steffy, Quinn would kill Hope and Liam. Wyatt replied that it was insane. Liam agreed wholeheartedly, and Hope noted that Wyatt had told her that Quinn wasn't dangerous.\n\n\nWyatt declared that his mother was overbearing, not violent. After some thought, he said Quinn had never been violent before. Hope figured that Wyatt could get through to Quinn. Liam didn't want to go to the cops, but he said he would if he had to. Hope asked if Quinn was capable of murder.\n\n\nBack at Quinn's warehouse, she unlocked her wooden box and retrieved an eighteen-inch, serrated sword. She ran a cloth along the blade, nicked her finger, and sucked a blood drop off it. Her eyes glittered as she marveled at the blade. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn tells a frightened Liam to go to Paris, be with Steffy but leave Wyatt and Hope alone. He asks what is she going to do, poke him a bunch of times with his sword necklace. She grunts that she will kill Hope too before she sees her with him .live by the sword, die by the sword. Hope is about to leave for work when she is seen by Bill and Brooke. He says it is still hard to think about finding Ridge; he could have died. Hope says he is doing okay; Katie is taking good care of him. Brooke says all because of Quinn because she can't face reality. When she can't get what she wants, she goes nuts. Bill tells Brooke that he gave Liam the day off so he can ice his foot and keep it elevated. She coos that she could be persuaded to play hooky too. She says he did not technically cheat on her since she was supposed to marry Ridge that day, but he did keep it a secret and Quinn used it to her advantage. Bill says she tired but it did not work. Wyatt is going over inventory when Quinn slips in. He grouses a bit about certain new pieces not being in the catalog. She says she has been a bit preoccupied. He says she told Hope that she did not go to Liam's and he wants to make sure that is true. He says Liam went to the hospital so what did she do to him. Quinn scoffs that it is a sprained ankle. And Wyatt should have seen him hobbling around on his crutches; it was pathetic. And Liam blamed her the spineless wimp trips and falls yet it is all her fault. Wyatt says he wants a straight answer from her; as honest as she can be. She says if she wanted to hurt Liam, he'd have more than a sprained ankle. She admits she went over there to talk some sense into him, that's all. He says she did what she always does. She overstepped and interfered. That is why Hope chose Liam. So she is done, he wants her to stay off their property and out of their lives. He makes her promise never to go over there again and she does. She says she only did this for him. He's the man that Hope should be with, not Liam. Hope drops in to see Liam and he says the swelling is down some. He is not taking the pills as he wanted to keep a clear head. She says she has no meetings this morning so she could stay and play nurse. He tells her about Quinn's last visit and how she threatened to kill both of them. Hope says that Quinn is making no sense. He says because Hope is thinking logically and Quinn is way past that now. Hope says that Wyatt says that this mother is not dangerous. Liam says Wyatt is not even speaking to his mother now so he does not know all that is going on in her head. Liam says Wyatt wants to believe his mother would not do something like that but he is not willing to take that chance. Hope calls Wyatt and asks him to come over. She tells Liam that Wyatt has to do something as Quinn must be stopped. Deacon sneaks up on Quinn and says her son could not get away fast enough. She tells him not to make her regret letting him stay here. She says she and her son are going through a bad time right now but all of that will change soon. Deacon says with her help whether Wyatt wants it or not. She says he has lost his confidence. Right now he does not think he can compete with Liam. He says he did not hear her give Wyatt a little pep talk because he does not want her involved. She says somebody has to fix this and if Wyatt won't, then she will. She points out to him that he is the last person to be giving her parental advice. He says he knows he is not the Father of the Year. He admits he has made mistakes with his kids but he has learned from them and if she would get down off her high horse, maybe she could too. She scoffs that he abandoned his children and the only person he cares about is himself. She says she does not care about herself, only her son's happiness matters to her now. Wyatt joins Hope and Liam and says he just found out that his mother was here last night. But they need to dial it back a little. She did not touch Liam's ankle and he told her to stop coming over. Liam says Wyatt doesn't understand. Quinn has always been delusional but it's really dark now. He doesn't think she even cares what Wyatt wants anymore. This isn't just getting him and Hope back together but getting rid of anybody who makes him unhappy. Bill tells Brooke there is no reason they can not continue and get married, small and simple. She says she wants the entire family there and she will start working on it right away. Bill says so it is a wedding or a family therapy session. While he is out of the room, Deacon comes by, surprises Brooke. He says he is back in L. A. and wanted her to hear it from him. He says he is between jobs and is staying with a friend. Brooke says she can not offer him anything and she does not want him to be bothering Hope. She's at a good place in her life, happy and secure. Deacon says he does not expect anything. He has changed .at least his attitude. And that means owning up that he was a real jerk in the past. He's determined to fix that and not be bad news to everyone in his life who has known him. And that includes Hope but he can not do that with Brooke in the middle. He'd really like to earn that right. Wyatt can't believe they called him over just for this. He maintains that his mother is overbearing but she is not physically dangerous. Liam repeats again that Quinn said he had to give Hope up or she is coming after both of them. He doesn't want to go to the police but he will if he has to. Hope says Wyatt must speak once more to his mother. They need to know for sure if she is capable of murder. Quinn gets the locked tool box and gently takes out the large sword, polishing and cleaning it with a certain gleam in her eye.",
