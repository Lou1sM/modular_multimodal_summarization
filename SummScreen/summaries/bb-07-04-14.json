Returning to the opened front door, Brooke said she didn't want Deacon anywhere near her, but Deacon replied that it wasn't about her. It was about Hope.\n\n\nNoting that Brooke was with Bill, Deacon stated that he wouldn't get in the way. \"But come on. Spencer? I'm not judging you -- well, maybe just a little bit,\" he quipped.\n\n\nBill appeared on the overlook, and with a cobra-like stare, Bill asked Deacon what he was doing there. Bill descended the stairs, and chuckling, Deacon relayed that he wasn't trying to cause problems. Instead, he was there about his daughter, who was involved with Bill's sons.\n\n\nBill ordered Deacon to stay out of it. \"Like you have?\" Deacon snipped. Deacon insisted that he was there for his daughter and asked if Bill had a problem with that. Bill retorted that he had a problem with Deacon being anywhere near Bill, Brooke, or Hope -- or anyone else Bill cared for. Deacon declared that Hope was his daughter and that Bill should understand that parents had to protect their kids.\n\n\n\"My daughter -- \" Brooke started to say, but Deacon corrected that it was their daughter. \"Our daughter...\" Brooke restated, \"is with Liam now. She doesn't need you.\" She instructed Deacon to stay away from her and from Hope. Bill told Deacon to beat it, and Deacon quietly left.\n\n\nOnce Deacon had gone, Brooke said she wanted Deacon to care about Hope, and Brooke had seen a change in him. Bill scoffed that Deacon's change was part of the con. She asked Bill not to say that to Hope, who really wanted to believe in her father.\n\n\n\"What about what happened in Italy -- or has she just shifted all that blame to me?\" Bill asked. Brooke recalled that he'd had a part in that, and Bill responded that he regretted it and regretted becoming involved with Sharpe. Bill insisted that Deacon was a cancer and that Brooke had better cut him out for Hope's sake. Brooke stated that the man wasn't in her life, but he might be in Hope's life.\n\n\nBill insisted that Hope couldn't be objective. Brooke declared that she'd be there for Hope, but Deacon had better not hurt Hope. \"He's not going to do anything to either one of you because I'm here. I'll protect you,\" Bill asserted and hugged Brooke. Bill stated that he had to wonder where Deacon was staying and whom he'd hooked up with.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Wyatt declared that Quinn would never hurt Hope, whom Quinn adored. Liam stated that Quinn loved Hope as long as Hope was with Wyatt. Wyatt denied that his mother was that far gone, but Liam insisted that she'd become murderous. Hope believed that Wyatt was the only one who could get through to Quinn, but Wyatt refused to believe that his mother had gone so far.\n\n\nLiam suggested that Wyatt at least confront Quinn, but Wyatt didn't know how to confront her about wanting to kill his brother and the woman Wyatt loved. Wyatt asked how Liam was sure that Quinn wasn't just blowing off steam, but Hope insisted that Quinn be accountable for her threats.\n\n\nWyatt whipped out his phone and text-messaged his mother, who was polishing her sword at the warehouse. Wyatt wanted to see Quinn. She texted to ask where he was. He responded that he was with Hope and Liam. \"That pathetic little worm told Hope and my son,\" Quinn seethed to herself.\n\n\nLater, Hope and Liam were still having a hard time convincing Wyatt of the seriousness of Quinn's threats. \"I will kill Hope, too, before I see her with you,'\" Liam quoted. Wyatt stubbornly said Quinn wasn't going to do anything because she wasn't -- \"Insane? Crazy?\" Liam interjected. Liam insisted that someone in her right mind wouldn't threaten murder.\n\n\nWyatt asserted that he'd be the judge of it, and his mother would listen to him. He offered to be the one to call the police if Quinn did something else. Hope worried that it could backfire, but Wyatt huffed that Hope and Liam were making too big of a deal out of it.\n\n\nLiam asked what he and Hope were supposed to do while Wyatt was handling Quinn. Wyatt suggested that the couple dial it back and not flaunt their relationship. Liam raged that he'd already thought of that; however, Quinn wanted him out of town and her job back. Hope asserted that it was not going to happen. Liam suggested that Wyatt relay that Liam had filed a restraining order, but Wyatt asked Liam not to do that.\n\n\nLiam urged Wyatt to see that threatening Liam was one thing, but neither brother could stand for Quinn threatening Hope. Wyatt apologized for his mother, but Hope said it wasn't his fault. Frustrated, Wyatt conveyed that he'd told Quinn again and again to stay away. He promised that he'd lay down the law and that his mother wouldn't be a danger for them.\n\n\nAfter Wyatt had gone, Hope and Liam hoped that Wyatt could get through to Quinn. Outside, fireworks shot off. Liam wanted to see them or sit by the fire pit outside, but Hope insisted that he needed some rest. Liam walked her to the door and bade her goodnight.\n\n\nLater, Hope arrived at Brooke's house, and Brooke and Bill informed her that Deacon had been there to get Brooke's support for his relationship with Hope. Brooke and Bill urged Hope to at least have a healthy skepticism about Deacon. Hope responded that she'd given Deacon the forgiveness he'd asked for, just as Liam had forgiven Bill for his part in the Italy incident.\n\n\nHope wanted to believe that Deacon loved her and wanted to be in her life. She was willing to give him a chance, and she wanted Brooke to do the same thing. Hope went up to bed, and Brooke told Bill that, even though she didn't like Hope's decision, she had to trust her daughter.\n\n\nAt the warehouse, Deacon arrived as Quinn was wrapping the sword in a black cloth. He was curious about how her work was going, and she announced that she'd finished. Deacon wanted to see it, but Quinn switched the subject to his evening. He grimly remarked that he'd seen Brooke and Bill.\n\n\nDeacon began to rant about wanting to be in his daughter's life, but he quickly decided that he didn't want to talk about that. He switched the topic back to seeing what was under the black cloth. Carrying the object to its box, Quinn accused Deacon of bailing on their arrangement. He claimed to still be on the job, but Quinn decided to handle it herself.\n\n\nDeacon prodded Quinn to let him see the creation, and he quipped that it had to be a diamond-studded leash for Wyatt. Flipping back the cloth, Quinn revealed the sword. She held it parallel to her face and asked what Deacon thought. Deacon was amazed by the artistry and craftsmanship. He assumed that someone was paying her a bundle because \"this thing is killer.\"\n\n\nWith a wicked laugh, Quinn responded, \"That's the point.\" Deacon assumed that she'd made one before. \"Not this size,\" she uttered, marveling at the sword. He expressed that it was more than art, and one could do damage with it. He was curious to know whom she'd made it for, but she replied that it was confidential. He remarked that \"he\" was a lucky guy, but she asked why it had to be for a man.\n\n\nQuinn locked the sword in its box, and pulling the box off the table, she announced that she was headed out. Deacon assumed she was delivering the project somewhere, but she replied that she was keeping a promise to someone. He offered to accompany her to protect the piece. \"You don't think I can protect myself?\" she quipped. He told her to stay out of trouble, but he looked troubled as she exited.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt arrived at the warehouse. He was surprised when Deacon greeted him. Deacon relayed that he'd met Quinn before he'd met Wyatt, and Wyatt asked why Deacon hadn't revealed that. Deacon responded that he'd been to Wyatt's house to talk about Wyatt, not Quinn.\n\n\nWyatt grew uneasy when Deacon relayed that he'd met Quinn at a bar. Deacon readily stated that it wasn't what Wyatt was thinking, and she'd been nice enough to give Deacon a place to stay. Wyatt asked what Deacon thought of her, and Deacon cautiously said she was a nice lady. \"No, Deacon, really,\" Wyatt replied. Deacon stated that Quinn was a real piece of work.\n\n\nUnsurprised, Wyatt offered to have a drink with Deacon while he asked Deacon some questions. Deacon declined and expressed worry that something was going on with Quinn, who hadn't gone out alone. Wyatt asked who Quinn had been with, but Deacon clarified that it had been a \"what.\" Glancing at Wyatt's neck, Deacon realized that Quinn had replicated Wyatt's sword charm.\n\n\nDeacon explained that Quinn had made something just like Wyatt's charm; however, it hadn't been a piece of jewelry. Deacon insisted that it had been the real deal, \"sharp as hell,\" and deadly. \"And she took it with her?\" Wyatt exclaimed. Deacon relayed that she'd said something about having to keep a promise to someone. Upon hearing that, Wyatt rushed out of the warehouse.\n\n\nBack at Liam's house, Quinn appeared at Liam's sliding door and watched him go into his bedroom. Liam returned to lock the sliding door, but Quinn shoved it open and stormed inside. Upset, Liam stamped his crutches on the ground, demanding to know what she wanted.\n\n\nQuinn raged that Liam wasn't listening to her, and he'd gone to Hope and Wyatt. Liam threatened to go to the police, too; however, Quinn declared that, after that night, Hope and Wyatt would finally be free of Liam. Liam called her insane, and she asserted that he'd driven her to it. Quinn called Liam a coward who'd lied when unable to compete with Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Liam's ankle hurt, and she kicked him in his boot. Liam fell onto the floor and writhed in pain. She told him not to worry because it would all be over with soon. Quinn produced the sword, and Liam scrambled to sit up. She proclaimed that it was the Spencer sword, the very one that Liam wasn't man enough or worthy enough to wear.\n\n\nLiam stuttered as Quinn wagged the tip in his face, screaming that she'd warned him, but he hadn't listened. Poising the blade against his neck, she said, \"Live by the sword; die by the sword!\" \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt tells Liam that his mother would never hurt Hope; she adores her. Liam says that is only when she is with Wyatt. With him it is a different story. Wyatt says his mother was angry. Liam brings out the worst in her. Hope begs Wyatt to do something. He has to get her some help. Liam says only Wyatt knows what she might be capable of. Wyatt can't believe they are serious but they say he has to confront his mom to find out for sure where her head is. Wyatt keeps saying she may be acting crazy but she is not a killer. He'll be the judge of that. He will talk to her and she will listen to him. And if it comes to it that he will call the police on her himself. He still thinks they are making way too big a deal with this so he wants to handle it. Meantime dial it back a little and stay away from her and don't flaunt their relationship. He says he is sorry. He never meant to put them in this position. Hope says they know it is not his fault. As he is leaving, Wyatt says he told her over and over to leave them alone but he will lay down the law and take her to task and she will listen. She will not be a danger to them. Brooke tells Deacon that he needs to go. Deacon says he knows Brooke does not trust him, but cut him some slack. He needs to be with his daughter and he owes her that much. Brooks asks him not to do this to her again. He says this isn't all about Brooke. He gets that she is with Spencer now. Bill starts down the stairs and sees Deacon and asks what is he doing here. Deacon smarts is that any way to treat an old war buddy. Bill asks Brooke if Deacon broke in. Deacon says he is not here to start anything. He is here about his daughter who is involved with Bill's son. Bill tells him to stay out of it. Bill gruffly says he is not here for his daughter. He's working some angle so what is it, money? Deacon says again he is there to support his daughter unless Bill has a problem with that. Bill says he has a problem with Deacon being around anybody that he cares about. Brooke says their daughter is happy and secure now and she does not need Deacon in her life so stay away from her and from Brooke too. Bill says Deacon heard her so beat it, convict. Brooke tells Bill that she has seen a little change in Deacon, nothing major as he is still a con artist. Bill says the change is part of the con. She reminds him that he had a big part in the Italy scene too. He says he has regretted that and said it over and over. He regrets getting involved with Sharpe. Brooke better listen to him as Deacon is a cancer and needs to be cut out of their lives for Hope's sake. Brooke tells Bill that Deacon is not in her life, but if her daughter wants a relationship with her father, then she has to trust her. Deacon returns to Quinn's as she is working on the piece actually it is finished, she just keeps taking it out and polishing it. Deacon wants to see what she has been working on. She asks how his day was. He says he went to see Brooke. She quips that must have been uncomfortable for Brooke. He says she wants nothing to do with him, and Bill was there. Quinn says that must have been unpleasant for Deacon then. He says he is all about Hope as he is her father, but enough about that. He wants to see the piece she has been working on; they are roomies, no secrets. She says they had an arrangement and he sort of bailed on that. He reminds her he is still on the job. She says a lot of good it did as Hope and Liam are tighter than ever. It looks like she will have to handle it herself. She holds up the sword. He says damn, it's beautiful and she made it? She retorts that it is a very special assignment. He says somebody must be paying her a bundle, this thing is killer. Quinn says that's the point. And it has an edge. He asks if she is going to hang it on the wall. But it's more than art. She could do some serious damage with that. He can't get her to say who she made it for, but he's a lucky guy. He knows it's a guy as it is not the sort of thing a housewife would use in the kitchen. She wraps it up neatly and says she has to go. She's keeping a promise to someone. He tells her to stay out of trouble. Bill tells Brooke they are not going to let that loser ruin their 4th of July. They can go out and watch some fireworks or start their own indoors. Liam asks Hope if she'd like to go out and watch the fireworks. She says he is limping too much and needs to sit down and she will just go for now. He has to be exhausted so just get some sleep. Wyatt comes back to the factory and only finds Deacon. He is surprised that he already knows his mother. Deacon says they met in a bar but it's not like what he thinks. She was nice enough to give him a roof over his head for a while. Wyatt wants to know what he really thinks of her and Deacon says she is a real piece of work. Wyatt offers him a drink as he has a ton of questions for him. Deacon says he can't, but he is worried about Quinn. Something is going on and he's worried about her. She went out but not alone .not a who but a what. He points to Wyatt's necklace, it was just like that. But it was not a piece of jewelry. It's the real deal, deadly, sharp as hell. And she said she had to keep a promise to someone. Wyatt says no, and brushes past Deacon to go. Hope comes home and Brooke says Deacon had been by wanting her to support him with Hope. Hope says she knows the two of them have issues but he asked for her forgiveness and she gave it to him. She motions to Bill just like Liam forgave him for all Bill did in Italy. Deacon is her dad and she'd really like to believe him when he says he loves her and wants to be part of her life. She is giving him that chance and it would mean a lot if they would too. Liam is checking all the windows and doors and locking up when Quinn comes blustering in. Liam yells at her to get out. She says she will shortly. He wants to know what she wants. She says she asked him over and over to be gone but he hasn't listened. And now he's even gone and told Wyatt and Hope. He says she is damn right and next he is going to tell the police. She says no that she doesn't think so. It's Independence Day and after today Hope and Wyatt will be free of him at last. He's about five inches from her face and says she is insane. She says he drove her to it. He tries to control Hope and her family; he's a coward who can't compete with Wyatt so he lies and lies some more. She looks at his foot and mocks that if it hurts .then kicks him in it and he falls to a quivering mass on the floor. She tells him not to worry. It will all be over soon. She pulls out the sword and holds it in front of his face. She says this is the Spencer sword .the one that he is not manly enough or worthy to wear. As he is shivering, she holds it to his throat and says she warned him but he did not listen. Now he's going to pay the price .live by the sword, die by the sword.",
