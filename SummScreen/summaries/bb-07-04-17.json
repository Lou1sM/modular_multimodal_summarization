    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester guesthouse, Quinn and Ridge discussed that Sheila was dangerous. Quinn worried that Sheila knew something, and even if she didn't, she was going to tell Eric that she did. Quinn said that Eric couldn't hear anything about Ridge and Quinn from Sheila first.\n\n\nQuinn felt Sheila was delusional and wanted Eric back. Her first step would be to get rid of Eric's current wife. \"All I think about is what my life would be like without him,\" Quinn said of Eric. She reminded Ridge that she had been a pariah before Eric, and he believed in her. He'd given her a second chance and turned her life around. \"I have never experienced that kind of faith and unconditional love,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge balked that Sheila could know anything and insisted they hadn't done anything. But Quinn maintained that Sheila was trouble. She added that Brooke, Katie, and Ivy all knew about them. They would never have any peace in their lives, and she was tired of it. She wanted to tell Eric before someone else did. \"Eric deserves better than that. He deserves better from us. I can't lose Eric. I can't lose him the way you lost Brooke,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to tell Eric immediately. \"I want to be the woman that Eric thinks I am,\" she said. She insisted that Eric had to hear it from them. She predicted he could shut them both out of his life, but she felt he would forgive them. \"It's time we're honest with him,\" Quinn said. Ridge agreed.\n\n\nAt the Forrester house, Sheila had told Eric that she felt Ridge and Quinn were having an affair. Eric shook his head. Sheila apologized that she had to be the one to tell him that his son had again betrayed him with one of his wives.\n\n\nSheila said she was sorry that Quinn had not been loyal to Eric. Eric was angry. \"How dare you, Sheila?\" he said and glared at her. Sheila tried to apologize. Eric stopped her and told her she was hateful. Sheila insisted she had proof.\n\n\n\"Lies,\" Eric shouted. He ordered her to get out and said he never wanted to see her again. Sheila begged him to believe her. Eric again told her to get out. She insisted that she was not the only one who knew. She begged Eric to think about why Brooke had called off her wedding to Ridge at the last minute. She maintained that it was because Brooke had found out about Quinn and Ridge.\n\n\nEric ordered Sheila to stop. However, she believed Ridge and Quinn were guilty, and they hadn't told him because they didn't want to hurt him. Eric fumed that Sheila hadn't changed one bit -- she was evil and deceitful. Sheila argued that Ridge and Quinn were the people he loved most, but they had betrayed him. Eric countered that they would never do something like that. Eric told Sheila she was sick and twisted. Sheila maintained that she was telling Eric to save him from the people he thought loved him.\n\n\nEric called Sheila a psycho and ordered her to get out of the house. He pushed her toward the door, but Quinn and Ridge entered and asked what Sheila was doing there. Eric looked at Quinn and Ridge. Quinn told Sheila to get out, but Sheila said she didn't want to miss what was next.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally and Thomas discussed that they had pulled off a fashion challenge in Monte Carlo at the Spencer Summit with Spectra versus Forrester by crashing the media party that Steffy had hosted.\n\n\nThomas noted all the Fourth of July decorations in the office. Sally said it was \"Gram's fave holiday,\" and they had to head over to her place for a picnic and fireworks.  Thomas agreed they had a lot to celebrate. They kissed.\n\n\nSally and Thomas recalled that Thomas had pushed Steffy into agreeing to the fashion show showdown, but Sally said they had risked making Steffy angry. \"You got the best of the princess,\" she noted.\n\n\nThomas agreed that Steffy was clearly a little annoyed, but he believed that she was beginning to accept his choice of Spectra and Sally. Thomas reminded Sally that he could do things like that to his sister, but other people could not.\n\n\nSally worried that she had promised to turn over a new leaf, and their stunt was not evidence of that. Thomas reminded her that Steffy had been a good sport about it. He added that it was exactly the PR they needed.\n\n\nThomas said they had to create a swim line, and they would be sitting next to all the movers and shakers in the industry and would unveil the new Spectra logo in Monte Carlo at the Spencer Summit. It would be the place to debut the new brand, new designs, and everything they were doing.\n\n\n\"None of this would be possible without you,\" Sally said. She was also concerned about the way Coco had been looking at her when they'd crashed the party. \"She was not happy with me pulling another fast one,\" Sally said. Thomas said it had been his idea, and Coco needed to not worry, but he warned that he planned to kick Princess Steffy's butt in Monte Carlo. Sally and Thomas kissed and smiled.\n\n\nIn an office at Forrester, R.J. and Coco took photos with a camera, and Coco reminded him that they had to go to Gram's place for a cookout where she dressed up like the Statue of Liberty. They both laughed. Coco said she couldn't get over what Sally had pulled at the Forrester party to announce the Monte Carlo fashion show.\n\n\nR.J. said it had been Thomas' idea, but Coco maintained that Sally hadn't needed to go along with it. R.J. told Coco not to worry. They agreed that Thomas had forgiven Sally for what she'd done. \"You forgave her, too, for the spy camera thing,\" R.J. added. Coco said she had hoped Sally had learned from what she'd done. \"I expected more from my sister,\" Coco said.\n\n\nR.J. suggested Coco let it go because Steffy clearly didn't seem to be bothered by it. R.J. changed the subject and said they were about to attend their first public party as boyfriend and girlfriend. R.J. wanted to mark the occasion with a surprise. He encouraged her to wear something patriotic -- and he presented a flag bikini and said they could take a few photos. \"Not on your life,\" Coco said, and they both laughed.\n\n\nR.J. said Coco would look hot in it. She encouraged him to wear it. They laughed, and R.J. said he did have a surprise for her that was not a bathing suit. They kissed.\n\n\n",
