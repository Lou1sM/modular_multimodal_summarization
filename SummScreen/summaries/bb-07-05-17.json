    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, after Sheila had told Eric that she believed Ridge and Quinn had had an affair, he escorted her to the door, but Quinn and Ridge entered. They wondered what Sheila was doing there.\n\n\nEric explained that Sheila had made stupid accusations that weren't worth discussing because they were so laughable. Quinn wondered what Eric meant, and Sheila dished that she had told Eric that Ridge and Quinn were having an affair. Ridge and Quinn told Eric it had not happened, but they had to talk to Eric alone. Sheila refused to leave. \"Tell Eric I'm wrong. I dare you,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge and Quinn insisted that Sheila had to leave, but Eric allowed her to stay and told Quinn and Ridge to tell him whatever they needed to so that Sheila could find out she was wrong. Ridge said they had never had an affair. \"We would never do that,\" Quinn said. Eric said the entire idea was outrageous. Sheila smirked.\n\n\nRidge tried to explain that he and Quinn valued their relationship with Eric too much to ever have an affair. Eric started to question why they were telling him how much they valued their relationship with him.\n\n\nRidge said that he had hated Quinn. Eric said he remembered. Ridge said he had wanted to get her out of Eric's life, but then Eric had sent them to San Francisco to a symposium, and it had been a big success. They had returned to their hotel and celebrated with tequila. Eric looked at Quinn and wondered what was wrong.\n\n\n\"I kissed your wife,\" Ridge said. \"And that's it,\" he added. Sheila butted in to surmise that they'd gotten drunk, and it hadn't stopped with a kiss. Ridge said no one had been drunk and nothing more had happened. Quinn said Eric needed to know everything. Ridge and Quinn admitted that they had shared more inappropriate moments, flirtations, and kisses, but they maintained it was all meaningless, and they'd never acted on it.\n\n\nEric glared at both of them. Ridge spoke up and said that he had fallen into his old pattern of risking one thing for another, but he maintained that it was a few innocent kisses.\n\n\nEric fumed that they talked of kisses and moments \"that decent people would never have allowed.\" Eric shook his head, and Quinn begged him not to end their relationship.\n\n\nQuinn said that she and Ridge had ended their dalliance after Steffy's wedding. She admitted that she had gone for a walk and had seen Ridge on the beach. \"But Brooke caught you, didn't she?\" Sheila asked.\n\n\nQuinn agreed, but she added that she and Ridge had discussed that they were happy -- him with Brooke, and Quinn with Eric. She added that they had never crossed the line. They had embraced and kissed as a goodbye. Eric looked away.\n\n\nEric recalled that Brooke had gone to his room, and she was ready to tell him but hadn't. \"You two wouldn't let her. You convinced her,\" Eric said.\n\n\nRidge argued that they all loved Eric and hadn't wanted to hurt him. Brooke had done what had been right for her. Ridge suggested that Eric should not throw away his marriage because Ridge had done something meaningless.\n\n\nQuinn begged Eric to forgive her. \"Eric, I made a mistake. I made many mistakes, but I believe in us -- in our marriage. Please tell me you do, too,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge insisted it was all his fault. He urged his dad to hate him but not to punish Quinn. \"Don't throw it all away because of a stupid mistake,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nQuinn tearfully and hopefully looked at Eric, but Eric looked angrily at Ridge and Quinn and hissed that they kept insisting it wasn't an affair. He wondered if there was a better word for it.\n\n\nEric insisted they had been lying to him. He was livid that he'd had to hear the truth from Sheila, of all people. Quinn replied that she had wanted to tell him before Sheila had. \"You couldn't resist him,\" Eric shouted at Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn was sorrowful. \"I don't know how this happened. I love you. I know that this will never happen again. It's over. Please, Eric. Tell me we can move on from this. Tell me you will forgive me,\" Quinn said. Sheila watched in anticipation.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Coco and R.J. prepared to go to her grandmother's party, but Coco asked if R.J. still had a surprise in mind, and he admitted he did. Coco asked if it had anything to do with food because she was starving, and her grandmother never made enough food. Coco and R.J. discussed what to eat, and R.J. directed her to his father's classic car. It was the surprise. They would have a date in his dad's car. She called him the coolest boyfriend ever.\n\n\nR.J. and Coco laughed, shot selfies, and posted them on social media. R.J. stopped at the top of a hillside and took pictures of the two of them in and out of the car. They got in the back seat and made out.\n\n\nR.J. offered Coco the keys, and she drove and took photos and posted them. However, she wasn't watching the road, and a car approached from the other direction. There was a crash.\n\n\nAt Bill's place, Bill and Brooke canoodled on the patio. Bill called the office and told his sons to earn their paychecks because he was taking the afternoon off.\n\n\nBrooke and Bill wondered if R.J. and Coco would arrive for dinner. Bill suggested R.J. would show up late and offered to give him a few tips. Bill didn't want to see R.J. sabotage relationships the way his dad had. Brooke sighed. Bill wondered if she would ever tell him why she had broken off her engagement to Ridge.\n\n\n\"It's not important,\" Brooke said. She demanded that he leave it alone. She teased that she loved him and his endearing way of prying. They hugged and kissed.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Brooke enjoys a rare moment by the pool with her workaholic husband. Still unaware of why Brooke and Ridge broke off their engagement, Bill probes Brooke for an answer. R.J. surprises Coco with an afternoon date driving around the Hollywood hills in his father's fancy convertible. After Coco switches to the driver's seat, she is still distracted from the scenery - and by sending text messages on her phone. Suddenly, another car approaches - Eric is aghast by Sheila's accusations and therefore dismisses Ridge when he wants Sheila to leave before he and Quinn address the issues at hand. Ridge then recaps how he hated Quinn, but he kissed her when they were at the convention in San Francisco. Quinn asks Eric for his forgiveness and Ridge takes full responsibility. It begins to dawn on Eric, though, that Brooke's break-up from Ridge in Australia was a hint that Ridge and Quinn actually had an affair and did not just share one misguided kiss.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tries to put Sheila out of the house but she won't budge. With a smug look on her face she tells Ridge and Quinn to fess up and tell the truth. She can see the guilt all over their faces. Eric says it is ridiculous but Sheila has said they are having an affair and that is crazy. Quinn says that is ridiculous. They would never do that to Eric. Again he tries to get Sheila out the door. She won't so Eric tells them to just spill it out what they came to talk to him about. He insists when Ridge wants to wait until Sheila leaves. Ridge starts slowly by saying that Eric knows he hated Quinn and wanted her out of Eric's life. He planned this. He kissed her and that was it. Sheila won't let him stop there. She even mentions the hotel room and Quinn takes over and says yes there were a few innocent kisses in San Francisco when tequila was involved but that is all that happened and they wanted to tell him but knew he would be hurt. Ridge admits it was all his fault, this dark streak in him - Quinn had nothing to do with it. Eric is appalled. RJ surprises Coco by taking her on a joyride in his father's prized classic convertible. They enjoy the sights and taking their selfies. Bill and Brooke relax by the pool and he still questions her about why she broke up with Ridge. She says just believe her; it wasn't worth all the fuss. Quinn explains that she and Ridge were both so happy and they met once more to say goodbye and did not know Brooke was watching them. Eric suddenly remembers that day when Brooke tried to tell him but they had convinced her to keep quiet. Ridge says Quinn is right for Eric and he is not right anymore for Brooke so that is why they broke up. Ridge says again this is all his fault; do not throw away what they have over a few kisses that were a mistake. If Eric needs to hate anyone then let it be him. He will move out and leave them alone. Coco and RJ trade places and she takes the wheel of the car. As she races down the narrow canyon road she meets a car that she doesn't see coming. Eric is livid and asks them if there is another word for affair that they said did not happen. This has been going on and he had to find it out from Sheila. Quinn panics and says she never stopped loving Eric and Sheila knows that. She does not care about her job or the house or anything but Eric. Eric says he is supposed to know how she cares so much for him that she cannot resist Ridge. She says it is over, it will never happen again. Please tell her that this will pass and he will forgive her.",
