    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Chuck's bar, Bridget stared at the nude ad in the paper and didn't know what her mother had been thinking. Sure that it was Stephanie's doing, Jackie stated that Nick would realize it. Gesturing to the ad, Bridget said her mother knew that Nick wouldn't put up with stuff like that. Jackie urged Bridget to have a little faith; after all, Bridget had been the main motivator behind the union. Bridget cocked her head in dubious realization.\n\n\nLater, Bridget, Rick, and Dante conversed about a screw-up they'd made on the documents, which meant that the wedding officiant couldn't leave. Rick said the officiant had mentioned another wedding he had to perform, but Dante believed Jackie could keep the man there.\n\n\nBridget, Rick, and Dante took the documents to Walter, the officiant, who was telling Jackie that he could not stay. Walter noticed that they'd signed the documents as witnesses to a wedding that hadn't occurred. \"Oops,\" Rick hopefully said. It didn't matter to Walter because the wedding really hadn't taken place. As Walter exited the bar, Jackie followed him, asking him to do her a favor.\n\n\nRick decided to head for the airport, but Bridget exclaimed that there still could be a wedding that day. He replied that only she seemed to think so.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Stephanie believed that Brooke and Nick's wedding was off. Ridge asked if Stephanie was really sure about that. Believing that the confrontation between the bride and groom had been inevitable, Stephanie suggested that Ridge go to the marina to be there for Brooke, who'd be devastated.\n\n\nRefusing to go, Ridge said Brooke had asked him to let her go. He planned to honor that request because it would be hopeless unless she returned to him of her own free will.\n\n\nLater, Stephanie ended a call on her cell phone. She said it was official; the wedding was off.\n\n\nOn the Shady Marlin, Nick and Brooke were dressed for a wedding they weren't sure should happen. Nick said he couldn't ask Brooke to be someone she wasn't. Brooke asked why she felt as if she was always apologizing for things she didn't think were wrong. She felt as if all she could be was an embarrassment of a wife and wondered if she should be his wife at all.\n\n\nNick asked if he was wrong to want to keep private things private, but Brooke contended that she had a public persona. He replied that the public knew her with her clothes on, not off, and he asked if she could see that Stephanie and the dressmaker were using her. Brooke stated that \"sex sells.\"\n\n\nNick was incredulous that Brooke couldn't understand why any man would have a problem with his wife being exposed in that way. She said that he wasn't just any man; he was supposed to be the man that understood and trusted her. She'd suffered people's disapproval her entire life, and she didn't want that from the man she'd marry.\n\n\nAsserting that he wasn't an anti-sex freak looking to keep Brooke beneath his thumb, Nick reminded Brooke that he'd always enjoyed seeing her thumb her nose at the world. Ridge, on the other hand, sought to call the shots. Brooke asserted that Ridge didn't tell her what to do. Nick asked why it was okay for Ridge to plaster her naked butt all over the city but not okay for Nick to complain about it.\n\n\nBrooke said she'd told Nick that Ridge hadn't done it. Nick ordered her not to defend Ridge. Nick hated it when she did that. She asked how he'd feel if it had been her own idea. Nick yelled that it hadn't been her idea. He loved her unpredictability, but things like that made him crazy. It made him want to pick up anchor and go to Fiji -- alone. \"You can still do that,\" Brooke quipped.\n\n\nAgreeing that he could indeed, Nick concluded that they couldn't go on like that. He refused to be the guy who always said, \"I don't like that guy,\" and he said she couldn't be the woman who never said no. He asked where they'd draw the line and what Brooke was willing to give up. Brooke didn't want it to be about sacrifices. She wanted them to feel free to do as they wanted.\n\n\nNick wanted that, too, but he didn't want \"those people\" messing with their lives. Brooke stated that \"those people\" were important to her, and it wouldn't change, even if she didn't always handle them in the best way. She didn't want to lose her career. She was back on top, and it felt good. He was glad for her.\n\n\n\"Are you really?\" Brooke questioned. She said she wouldn't stop pushing the envelope in what Forrester sold or how Forrester sold it. She didn't want to go home to a barrage of threats about it. Nick quipped that it depended upon how much dancing in the nude she'd do with her ex.\n\n\nBrooke affirmed that there would be none of that, and Ridge knew he had no chance with her. She reckoned that Stephanie might be more stubborn about it. Nick imagined that Stephanie would be yelling out orders to Brooke from Stephanie's coffin.\n\n\nNick figured that Brooke desired to keep him off balance and unsure. Brooke wanted Nick to be sure; she just didn't want to do everything his way. Chuckling, Nick accused Brooke of tossing him curve balls after they'd already settled certain matters. Even when Nick and Brooke had agreements, she'd run off and do whatever \"they\" wanted.\n\n\nBrooke replied that Stephanie and Ridge didn't run her life. Brooke didn't understand why she and Nick had to develop agreements about what she could and could not do. She asked if it was enough to be respectful of each other's differing opinions.\n\n\nSomeone knocked at the door, and Walter Bynan entered. He said Jackie had suggested that he let the bride and groom know that he needed to leave. Brooke apologized to Walter, but Nick decided that Walter might not want to leave just yet.\n\n\nOutside later, Brooke and Nick strode through the grass to meet Walter beneath a white pergola. It wasn't quite what Nick had had in mind, and she asked if he was sure he wanted to do it. \"Not really. Go ahead,\" he replied, nodding at Walter.\n\n\nWalter began the ceremony with opening remarks, but interrupting, Nick asked if they could skip ahead to the meat and potatoes. Brooke flashed a look, and Nick asked if there was a problem. She stated that they hadn't really resolved anything. Nick announced that he loved her, and he wouldn't let her go. He figured that if they were old and still having the argument as they glued their teeth in, \"then so be it!\"\n\n\nBrooke asked if she and Nick would argue until death. Nick stated that they'd be themselves, and they'd get along -- mostly. Brooke was it for him. It was all he knew or needed to know. He asked if she had anything to add to that. Brooke didn't, and Nick asked Walter to continue.\n\n\nWalter asked Brooke if she took Nick as her husband for as long as she lived. Brooke said that she'd never imagined loving anyone the way she loved Nick or anyone loving her the way he did. It was scary that he saw her so clearly and took her seriously, like no one ever had. Brooke decided that Nick was it for her, too, and nothing would make her happier than to marry him.\n\n\nWalter asked if Nick took Brooke to be his wife for as long as he lived. Nick claimed that he'd fallen in love with Brooke the day he'd met her. She made him more giving and forgiving. Every day with her was different, and he'd been looking for her his whole life. He intended to never let her go.\n\n\nThe couple exchanged rings. Walter pronounced them husband and wife. \"We did it!\" Nick exclaimed. He roped Brooke into his arms and kissed her.\n\n\nDown the hill, Bridget found Jackie. Bridget couldn't locate Brooke and Nick on the boat. \"Look,\" Jackie uttered and pointed. Bridget saw Nick and Brooke kissing beneath the pergola. Jackie whipped out her phone to make a call.\n\n\nA saxophone version of \"I'm Going Back Again\" played. Brooke and Nick boarded the yacht. Bridget strode up to the pergola, picked up Brooke's discarded bouquet, and gazed solemnly at the Shady Marlin as it left the port.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, Stephanie was assuring Ridge that he was the only man for Brooke. Stephanie received a call. Jackie was on the line. She said Stephanie had done her worst, but it had been of no use because Brooke and Nick were husband and wife.\n\n\nStephanie sadly closed her phone and told Ridge that something had happened. She assured him that it would be just a matter of time before he got Brooke back. \"So, the wedding...\" Ridge uttered. Devastated, he sat down. Stephanie insisted that Nick couldn't make Brooke happy. Ridge removed the wedding band from his finger.\n\n\n",

Jackie frets and tries to stall the minister from leaving. Brooke tells Nick that she is her own person and they can't spend their lives arguing when she does something that he doesn't agree with. Nick admits that they can both be very different people but they do love one another. The minister informs them that he is leaving but Nick grabs him. They rush off back atop the hill overlooking the marina and pledge their vows to one another. Jackie and Bridget watch from a distance as they are pronounced husband and wife and sail off on the Shady Marlin.
