    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Hope entered the living room in her robe. She was having trouble sleeping and wanted to talk to Brooke and Bill about Quinn, who'd gone off the deep end. \"The deep end is her permanent address,\" Bill quipped.\n\n\nHope explained that Quinn was somehow getting into Liam's house, and Liam's sprained ankle had occurred while Liam had been trying to get away from Quinn. Hope relayed Quinn's demands to have her job back and have Liam leave town. \"She threatened to kill him -- and me,\" Hope added.\n\n\nBrooke's mouth dropped open, and Bill asked, \"She did what?\" Bill wanted to talk to Quinn, but Brooke didn't want him anywhere near the woman. Hope conveyed that she'd appealed to Quinn, to no avail. Brooke was upset that Hope had been around Quinn.\n\n\nBrooke suggested that Liam spend the night at their house, but Hope stated that Liam wouldn't let Quinn run him out of his place. Brooke said that if Quinn had keys to Brooke's house, then Brooke wouldn't be staying there. Hope wanted Bill to talk to Quinn because he was the one who'd unleashed Quinn upon them. Bill sarcastically reminded Hope that she'd been the one to do that.\n\n\nBill felt that Quinn's favorite weapon was fear, but carrying through on her threats made her lose her power. He decided that Quinn was crazy, not stupid. Hope relayed that Wyatt had said the same thing and was probably talking Quinn down at that moment. Bill figured that Wyatt was the solution and the only person Quinn would listen to anyway.\n\n\nBill changed the subject to something he deemed more pleasant -- his and Brooke's wedding. Hope grimaced and decided she was going to bed. Bill was grateful that Hope had filled them in on what was going on, and he said \"we\" wanted to fill Hope in, too, and discuss a wedding date.\n\n\nIrritated with Bill use of \"we,\" Hope asked if Bill was in charge of informing Hope of events in Brooke's life. Brooke said Bill was just being considerate. Hope didn't see why her feelings mattered. To her, Bill's relationship was with her mother. Sensing tension, Bill decided to go upstairs.\n\n\nAfter Bill had gone, Brooke said that Hope had every right to her feelings for Bill, and Brooke could only hope that the two could work things out and that Hope could be happy for Brooke. The tearful Hope replied that she wanted her mother's happiness and loved her mother more than anything. Hope apologized and said her nerves were on edge due to Quinn.\n\n\nHope apologized for all the times she'd claimed to be embarrassed by Brooke. Brooke made light of it, but Hope noted that Wyatt never complained, and he defended Quinn no matter what. Brooke saw that as different because he knew that Quinn was broken and needed protection.\n\n\nHope didn't know how Wyatt could turn his back on Quinn. Fighting back tears, Hope said she'd be devastated if anything got between her and Brooke. Hope promised to find a way to be nicer to Bill because he'd be her father-in-law. Brooke asked if Wyatt being the brother-in-law would be a problem. Hope replied that it depended on Wyatt, and she hoped he and Liam would find a way to get along.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Quinn held a sword to Liam's neck, and Liam pleaded for his life. He reasoned that everyone would know she was the killer; however, Quinn claimed not to care, because if Liam was gone, Wyatt would have what he wanted. Ripping Liam's sword necklace off, she called him a random bag of blood that no one would miss.\n\n\nLiam tried to say that Wyatt and Hope would feel too guilty about Liam's death to be together, but Quinn replied that they weren't weaklings like Liam. Quinn told him that life should be like death, where no one cared about anything but what one got in the end.\n\n\nLiam managed to knock Quinn back, and he scrambled to get away. He stumbled, and she pounced upon him. She raised the sword above her head, but just as she was about to plunge it into Liam's chest, she heard, \"Mom!\"\n\n\nQuinn yelled at Wyatt to go home, but Wyatt shoved his mother off of Liam and helped him to the sofa. Quinn stated that Wyatt wouldn't use that tone of voice if he'd heard what Liam had said. \"You swore to me that if this ever happened again, you would come to me first!\" Wyatt yelled.\n\n\nWyatt turned to help Liam exit the house, but Liam stammered that they had to call the police. Quinn grabbed her sword and asked why her son had even showed up there. Wyatt replied that it was to keep her from destroying herself. She said she would have gone away, and Wyatt would have had the life that he'd wanted.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Quinn expected him to step over his brother's bloodied corpse to claim the spoils. He claimed that he didn't need Hope that badly, and he asked if Quinn didn't think anyone else could ever love him. He asked if that was how pathetic and desperate his mother thought he was. Quinn screamed that Liam was the pathetic one, and Wyatt should have everything Liam had.\n\n\nWyatt told his mother that Liam had been better to her than she'd ever deserved by not throwing her in jail, which had been a favor to Wyatt. Wyatt asked if she was going to kill him, too, because, \"after tonight, this is going to be the end of the road for one of us.\"\n\n\nWyatt snatched the sword from Quinn and expressed his disgust that she'd made the life-sized replica sword. He slammed it to the ground, and she assumed he was angry. He asked why he'd be angry about spending years with a maniac who'd do or say anything, spending years hoping she wouldn't awaken in the morning, and spending years fearing what she'd do if she did. Back then, he'd felt guilty for wanting to run away from her, but he'd been the one to keep her from being put away.\n\n\nPointing at Liam, Wyatt declared that Liam was his brother, but for years, Wyatt had always been alone with Quinn. Wyatt had had no one to check with about his behavior or challenge the twisted worldview Quinn held. Liam had made Wyatt want to be a better person and had made Wyatt understand that he had to become a person who deserved to get the things he wanted.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that he'd only wanted the best for Hope. \"But guess what? It wasn't me!\" he told his mother. Due to that very night, he was glad that Hope had left him, because he wouldn't want Quinn's crazy world for Hope. Liam asked Wyatt to ask Quinn what she'd had in mind for Hope. Quinn claimed she wouldn't have hurt Hope, but Liam roared that it hadn't been what Quinn had said.\n\n\nWyatt asked how many things Quinn had done that she'd expressed she'd never do. He decided that she could keep her secrets, because he knew too much about her already, and he declared that the lives she'd ruined that night had been his and hers.\n\n\nQuinn hugged Wyatt from behind. She said it wasn't the end of the world, and everything would be fine. She noted that Liam wasn't hurt. She understood that she'd been terrible to Liam, but she felt Liam understood that she was just a strong, passionate person. She turned Wyatt around to look at her, and he declared that she should go to prison for what she'd done.\n\n\nQuinn figured that Wyatt had said it for Liam's benefit, but she was sure that when morning arrived, lost kittens and puppies would take precedence for Liam. She reasoned that she'd never have to see Liam again, and she asked if that would be good enough for Wyatt. Exasperated, Wyatt sadly said he was done. Quinn replied that she was the one person he could never be done with.\n\n\nQuinn asked if devoting her life and sacrificing it for Wyatt hadn't been enough for him. She grabbed the sword to stab herself with it and wondered if \"this\" would be enough. Wyatt snatched the sword from her and stabbed the chair, embedding the sword in it. He asked her to hear him for the first time in his life. \"It's over. You don't have a son, and I don't have a mother!\" he yelled.\n\n\nWyatt decided that being Quinn's keeper made him as crazy as she was. Quinn started to cry, but he held his hand up as if he wouldn't hear it. Quinn ran out of the house, and Wyatt grabbed his keys to give chase.\n\n\nLiam stopped Wyatt, but Wyatt insisted he had to catch his mother, who needed to be arrested. \"Wyatt, let her go,\" Liam uttered. Wyatt whimpered in confusion, but Liam put his hands over the keys in Wyatt's fist and softly repeated, \"Let her go...\"\n\n\nWyatt asked if Liam was hurt, but Liam replied that he'd gotten off easier than Wyatt. Liam wondered where Quinn would go. Wyatt doubted Quinn knew how to hide or that she even would hide, because she thought everyone was wrong and that she was right. He remarked that they'd lived in the warehouse to avoid having neighbors.\n\n\nLiam claimed to finally understand all that Wyatt had had to deal with. Wyatt was sorry for what had happened, but Liam said that Wyatt had saved his life. Wyatt remarked that he'd known that kind of day would happen, but he'd always wanted to be a hero for Quinn, even though it had been doomed. He said he just hadn't wanted to be alone.\n\n\n\"You are not alone, brother. I owe you my life. From this point forward, there is no such thing as alone,\" Liam proclaimed and patted the tearful Wyatt's shoulder. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Despite a year of bad blood between the adversaries, a heroic rescue is made before the untimely demise of one of them. Bill humbly takes responsibility for Quinn being in everyone\u2019s lives. Horrified by Quinn\u2019s actions, Wyatt demands answers from her regarding her dangerous antics. Hope is having a difficult time dealing with the fact that Bill is going to be a part of her family someday.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam is quivering on the floor with Quinn holding the sword to his neck. She rants that she told him over and over but he would not listen. He begs her not to do this as everyone will know and she will lose Wyatt. She says he is just a random bag of blood that no one will miss. Wyatt and Hope are not weaklings like him and they will get on with their lives. He breaks away temporarily but she grabs him and he lands on the floor prone again with her bending over him with the sword this time right at his chest. She draws it back with both hands and is about to plunge it just as Wyatt barges in and calls her name and for her to stop. She tells Wyatt to leave; just meet her back home. He yells again for her to back off and he comes and pulls her off of Liam. He helps Liam to the couch. He tells his mom that she swore to him if this ever happened again that she would come to him first. Her excuse was he doesn't understand what Liam said to her. She says she is the only one who is thinking clearly. Wyatt makes an attempt to get to the telephone to call the police but Quinn knocks it away. He says he came there to keep her from destroying herself; that is what he always does. She says she would have gone away and then he would have the life he wanted. He's outraged that she would think that he would step over his dead brother's corpse and claim his spoils. He doesn't need Hope that badly. Does she think he is that desperate and pathetic. She rages that no, it's Liam who is the pathetic one. Wyatt should have what he has. Wyatt says she is lucky. He could have had her thrown in jail but he asked Liam not to. And he listened. He asks if she is going to kill him too .because after tonight this is going to be the end of the road for one of them. He's the one that has kept her from being put away all these years. He points to Liam and says that is his brother. He's never had a brother. He never had anyone but her to run his behavior by, nobody to challenge that twisted world that she had. Liam is the one who made him want to be a better person; if he wanted something he had to deserve it. And all he wanted was the best for Hope but guess what, it wasn't him. Now he's glad Hope didn't pick him. He would not want her to live in this crazy Quinn world that she created. He tells her to keep her secrets as he already knows too much as it is. The only person she hurt tonight was his and her life. She calms down and even puts her arms around Wyatt and says things will be fine. This isn't the end of the world. It isn't the end of anything. Life is not over. She says Liam is not hurt; he's just angry. And she knows she has been terrible to him but she thinks he understands. She points out that she is a very passionate person; a strong person and sometimes feelings are so powerful they can not control them. Wyatt steels himself and says she should go to prison for this. She's shocked that Wyatt would say such a thing. Liam is angry tonight but he doesn't really care. Tomorrow all the little lost kittens and puppies will be the most important thing. She says she never has to see Liam again; never cross his path if that will be good enough for Wyatt. He says he can not do this anymore. He is done. Stunned, she says she is his mother. She is the one person he can never be done with. She has devoted her life to him and made sacrifices. That should be enough. She grabs the sword but Wyatt takes it away and stabs it into the couch. He tells her it is over. If she can hear anything he says tonight let it be known that life as they knew it as mother and son is over! He's been her keeper for so long that it is making him as crazy as she is and he is done. He does not care who she is. She looks so forlorn, then runs out. Wyatt starts to go after her or call the police or something. But Liam convinces him to just let her go. Wyatt seems undecided but Liam says again just let her go. Hope comes back downstairs and tells Brooke that she could not sleep. Bill quips all it will take is one finger of scotch and that will do the trick. Hope says she needs to tell them that Quinn Fuller has gone off the deep end. Again Bill quips the deep end is her permanent address. Hope tells them that Liam thinks Quinn may have keys to his place since she always manages to get in. His sprained ankle was because he was trying to get away from her. She wants Liam to leave and go to Paris and she wants her job back at FC and in the process she said she wanted to kill him ..and Hope too. Bill says that's it; he is going to go talk to Quinn himself. Brooke tells him absolutely not. She doesn't want him anywhere near that woman. She offers that maybe Liam can come spend the night in their house. Hope says he knows there is no way that Liam will let Quinn run him out of his own home. When Bill hears that Wyatt knows all of this and is probably speaking to her at the moment, he wants to talk about something much more pleasant \u0096 their wedding. Hope throws him a look and it's clear she wants no part of this. But when Bill leaves to go upstairs, she tells her mother that she only wants her to be happy and if it is Bill, okay she will try to coexist with him. Brooke only wishes that Hope could be happy for her. She understands Wyatt's dilemma too. His mother is fundamentally broken and he is protective of her. Hope says she agrees that Wyatt is better off without her but it's hard to turn your back on your own mother. She says she will try extra hard to be nice to Bill as she knows it makes her mother happy. Plus he's going to be her father-in-law so she doesn't have a choice. Liam asks Wyatt where does he think his mother will go. Wyatt says she doesn't know how to hide. She thinks everyone else is wrong and she is right so no need to hide. That's why they ended up living in the warehouse. It was a stroke of genius on his part with commercial zoning laws and no neighbors. He's so sorry for all of this. Liam says he gets it now what Wyatt has had to put up with all this time. But he saved his life. Wyatt says he knew this day was coming; he was doomed but he did not want to be alone. Liam says he is not alone, brother, he owes him his life. \"From this day forward there is no such thing as alone.\" He grabs him by the shoulder and gives him a good pat.",
