Brooke told R.J. that Bill had left to give R.J. time alone with his family. Coco decided that she should also leave, but R.J. indicated that he didn't want her to. She said she'd been worried about him and was really glad that he was okay.\n\n\nThe doctor read off good results for R.J.'s tests. Saying he'd keep monitoring R.J., the doctor left to check on a scan. R.J. apologized to Ridge about the car. Coco said she was sorry, too. Ridge replied that it wasn't important. Brooke questioned R.J. about the crash. He didn't remember much and said it had happened really fast. Brooke wanted to know what had happened. She remarked that there had been no other car, and no one else had been hurt.\n\n\nR.J. looked at Coco. A flashback of the crash played. R.J. stated that it had been his fault. Coco interjected that she'd been driving. He said it had been his idea to take the drive and to give her the wheel. He took full responsibility for it. Brooke still wanted an explanation for what had happened. Ridge said they could deal with it later.\n\n\nBrooke stated that it was important. Agreeing, Ridge said it was also important to let R.J. rest. Ridge noted that Coco was okay, and he could always buy a new car. Coco expressed how sorry she was and how terrible she felt about R.J. being in the hospital. R.J. said it had been an accident, and he didn't want her to blame herself.\n\n\nThe doctor returned and announced that R.J. didn't have any broken bones, but he did want to look at R.J.'s laceration again.\n\n\nRidge said he needed to take care of some business, but he'd be back. Brooke followed Ridge into the hallway to question why he was leaving when their son needed them both. Ridge told Brooke that he at least needed to call his father. Brooke asked what was wrong and said Ridge had been distracted since his arrival.\n\n\n\"He knows, Brooke,\" he replied. Brooke asked what Eric knew, and Ridge replied that Eric knew why Ridge and Brooke hadn't gotten married.\n\n\nLater, Ridge dialed Eric, but Eric didn't answer. On the voicemail, Ridge said something had happened, and he'd explain it when he got home.\n\n\nAfter the call, Brooke was surprised that Sheila had told Eric. Ridge said he didn't know how Sheila had known, but Eric had expected Quinn and Ridge to deny it. Ridge explained that Quinn had already decided to tell Eric before the confrontation, and Eric had been devastated. Ridge didn't know if he could fix it, but he had to try or he'd lose his relationship with his father.\n\n\nBrooke agreed to stay with R.J. if Ridge really had to go. She wondered how Sheila had found out. Ridge didn't know. He knew that she hadn't seen anything because it had been over. Ridge said that he and Quinn had been childish and stupid. He hoped Quinn could make Eric see it.\n\n\nBrooke felt sorry for Ridge and Eric. Ridge said Quinn had tried not to hurt Eric, but out of the blue, Sheila had burned everything to the ground. Brooke believed that it was possible Eric wasn't picking up the phone because he'd heard enough. Brooke suspected that Quinn might not even be with Eric because Eric might have thrown her out.\n\n\nRidge and Brooke returned to R.J.'s bedside to check on him. Ridge said he understood what it was like to not want one's parents hovering, but R.J. didn't know what it was like to get that phone call. Ridge said it was scary to think he might not get to see his son again or tell his son he loved him. He asked if R.J. got it. R.J. replied that he did.\n\n\nBrooke told R.J. that Ridge had to go. Ridge said he needed to talk to R.J.'s grandfather about something. The father and son expressed love for each other, and Ridge left.\n\n\nAlone with R.J. later, Coco said that he could tell her if it hurt. He replied that he would if she wouldn't feel guilty about it. Coco felt guilty and said she'd done it to him. She stated that it could have been worse, and it had all been because she hadn't been able to put down her phone. He called it an accident, but Coco said it wasn't.\n\n\nCoco stated that she'd been texting and not looking at the road. In Coco's view, R.J. was an amazing boyfriend, and she hadn't ever wanted to hurt him. Coco decided that she was bad luck. R.J. reminded her that she'd saved him from the forklift. She said bad things happened when she was around -- like the accident, the forklift, and the design theft. She promised to save up money to fix Ridge's Camaro.\n\n\nR.J. insisted that Coco was the opposite of bad luck. He took her hand, and she sat on the bed. R.J. began wincing in pain, and he managed to stutter, \"I.V. -- I.V.\" Coco backed away and knocked items off the bed tray. They laughed. She asked if he was okay. Chuckling, he replied that he would be after a kiss. She sat back down on the bed and kissed him.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Quinn arrived, upset at Katie because Quinn suspected that Katie had told someone about Quinn and Ridge. Katie had no idea what was going on and asked what had happened. Quinn whimpered about how Eric hadn't wanted to believe that it had been meaningless or that Quinn and Ridge had just been toying with each other. Quinn declared that she and Ridge had betrayed Eric, and everything was ruined.\n\n\nKatie didn't think Eric should be alone. Quinn relayed that she and Ridge had tried to explain, but Eric had refused to listen. Quinn said Eric had told Quinn to get out, and Sheila had been there the whole time. \"Sheila?\" Katie exclaimed. Quinn said Katie had known Sheila would go straight to Eric. Katie asked what Quinn meant. Quinn yelled that Eric had found out because of Sheila.\n\n\nQuinn stated that Sheila couldn't have seen anything between Ridge and Quinn because there hadn't been anything to see. In Quinn's eyes, someone had made Sheila suspicious. Katie guessed that Quinn thought it had been Katie. Katie asserted that she couldn't stand Sheila Carter and earnestly feared her. Katie said she wouldn't say anything to Sheila.\n\n\nQuinn asked about Brooke. Katie stated that Brooke had witnessed what Sheila had done to Eric and his family, and Brooke wouldn't forget it. According to Quinn, that only left Ivy, but Katie was certain Ivy had never even met Sheila. Quinn didn't believe that Sheila had been guessing and said Sheila had to have been sure if she'd taken it to Eric.\n\n\nKatie asked what difference it made. She said that Eric knew, and the only way to fix it was to take responsibility for what had happened. Katie told Quinn that she and Ridge had hurt Eric. It wasn't Sheila's fault, and it didn't matter how Sheila had found out. Katie said that Quinn couldn't blame Sheila for what Quinn had done.\n\n\nQuinn figured that Sheila had known it would hurt Eric. Katie stated that Quinn had cheated on Eric with his own son. Quinn said Katie was twisting it like Sheila had. Katie asserted that kissing was cheating. Quinn claimed to have gotten caught up in something. Katie said it was no excuse. It wasn't about Sheila's grand scheme, Eric not listening, or Katie getting revenge on Quinn. Katie said it was simply what happened when a person broke their vows and let their loved one down. Katie stated that it was what Quinn got.\n\n\nQuinn refused to let it be over or to let Eric push her away. She was worried that he was vulnerable, and she didn't know what was going on in Sheila's mind. Katie said it wasn't about Sheila, but Quinn screamed that it was. Quinn refused to lose her marriage. She loved her husband. She'd hurt him and broken his trust, but she refused to lose him. Katie hugged Quinn.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn arrived to a vacant house. She called out to Eric and stared at her portrait on the wall.\n\n\nRidge rushed in, looking for Eric, but saw Quinn instead. Ridge informed her that he'd left due to R.J.'s accident. He stated that his son was okay, but he had to tell Eric. Quinn said that Eric had gone. She explained that she hadn't been there when Eric had left because he'd already thrown her out -- even after she'd pleaded with him to throw Sheila out instead, so Eric and Quinn could talk. Quinn had returned to the house and had found no one there.\n\n\nRidge didn't want to think that Eric was with Sheila. Quinn said Eric had been very hurt, and Sheila had been there. Reeling in despair, Quinn asked what was happening and if she'd really ruined everything good in her life again. Quinn cried that Eric was the only one who'd believed in her, and she'd disrespected him. She'd broken his trust, and he was gone.\n\n\nQuinn realized it was over. She sat in the chair closest to the foyer and sobbed, asking, \"What did I do? What did I do?\" Ridge squatted behind the chair and rested his chin on it. Slowly, he touched Quinn's shoulder.\n\n\n",

Katie says she probably needs to go over there so Eric is not alone. Quinn assures her that Eric is not alone; Sheila is there. He wanted Sheila there and Quinn to be gone. They argue as Quinn says it had to be Katie or Brooke or Ivy to give Sheila details. Katie agrees that Sheila is a terrible person but she did not make this up so Quinn only has herself to blame. If she has a chance yet with Eric then she needs to get back over there and talk to him and convince him that it was careless but not a full betrayal.
