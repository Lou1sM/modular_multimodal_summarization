He flashed back to when Brooke had found him on the beach in Abu Dhabi, and he recalled when Katie had whispered poetry into his ear to remind him of their love for one another. He recalled finishing a verse that Katie had started. Ridge recalled dressing a model. Ridge admitted that he was nervous, and Katie hugged him.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam, Wyatt, Bill, and Hope all marveled that Wyatt had arrived in time to prevent Quinn from killing Liam. Bill apologized for not arriving sooner and seeing that Quinn had been a lunatic. Wyatt and Liam explained that Quinn had made a life-sized replica of the sword they wore as necklaces. She had planned to use in on Liam, Wyatt said. \n\n\nLiam produced the replica. Everyone gasped. Liam said that Wyatt had stabbed the sword into a chair once he had gotten it away from Quinn.\n\n\n\"She wasn't playing nice with her toy, so I had to take it away,\" Wyatt said. Bill asked what the police had said, and Wyatt and Liam admitted that they had not called the police. Bill was livid, but Liam explained that he had secured a restraining order. Bill encouraged Liam to press charges, but Liam said that Wyatt had suffered enough. Wyatt promised that Quinn would not harass Liam again.\n\n\nWyatt added that Bill had dumped Quinn -- again -- and she had been upset that Wyatt had lost Hope. Bill apologized for his role in the matter, but he said Quinn was a lunatic. Deacon arrived, and Hope and Bill were surprised. Bill told Deacon that he was not welcome at the house. Wyatt begged Bill to reconsider. Deacon and Wyatt explained that Hope's father had had a role in saving Liam.\n\n\nDeacon explained that he had met Quinn in a bar, and they had shared stories. Deacon added that Quinn had been very interested in the fact that Deacon had been Hope's father. Quinn had invited Deacon to stay at the warehouse, and he had taken her up on the offer. Deacon noted that Quinn had been secretive on her latest design, and he'd wondered why she had been using a blowtorch on jewelry. He'd discovered the sword she had made, and he'd known it could not be good.\n\n\nAfter Quinn had left the warehouse with the sword, Deacon and Wyatt had discussed Quinn's erratic behavior, and Wyatt had headed to Liam's house. Liam interjected, \"I'm alive right now because of my brother, your father, and a chance encounter in a bar.\" Everyone marveled at Liam's good fortune. Bill warned Hope that Deacon was trying to worm his way into her life once again. Deacon disagreed. \n\n\nWyatt's phone rang. He had a conversation with a woman named Dr. Fellin, who claimed to be calling on behalf of Wyatt's mother. Fellin claimed to be calling from a mental health facility -- which Quinn had voluntarily checked herself into. The doctor said that Quinn was getting the help she needed.\n\n\nLiam hoped that Quinn would get help after all she'd put Wyatt through. Bill commented that Wyatt and Liam were just like brothers. After all they had been through, they were okay. After everyone else had left, Hope, Liam, and Wyatt discussed what had happened. Liam asked if Quinn had ever done anything so dangerous before.\n\n\nWyatt said that she had been mentally unstable, but she had lost everything \"this time.\" He apologized to Liam. He wished Hope and Liam all the best. Wyatt and Liam embraced. Wyatt left, and Hope looked thoughtful.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric announced to Rick, Brooke, Carter, Maya, Pam, Charlie, Oliver, Caroline, and Aly that Ridge had decided to return to work. Everyone wondered if Ridge was ready to return to work. \"It's the best father and son team ever,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nRidge arrived in the parking lot with Katie, and he got out of the car then opened the car door for Katie. They walked into Forrester together, while a valet parked his car. At the gate to Forrester, the entire team waited for Ridge. Brooke hugged him, and Rick and other employees welcomed Ridge. Carter and Maya took selfies with Ridge. Thorne and Aly embraced Ridge. Pam offered him lemon bars, and Ridge and his father embraced.\n\n\nRidge turned at the entrance and nodded to everyone. He thanked them all. He said that his return was what Forrester was all about. \"It's the Forrester family supporting one another,\" Ridge said. He added that he could do anything with the support of Katie. He hugged Katie, and everyone applauded.\n\n\nLater in the photo studio, Aly and Oliver kissed. Aly noted that it had been cool to see her Uncle Ridge. Maya interrupted, and Aly left. Maya wondered if Oliver had something on his mind. She worried that he had been trying to avoid her. \"I know about the recording,\" Oliver said. Maya looked guilty.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Eric and Caroline met, and Eric told his daughter-in-law that her designs for the couture line had been stunning while Ridge had been gone. Eric and Caroline discussed that Caroline had been intimidated initially, but she had performed admirably. Eric thanked her, and Caroline said that she had enjoyed being Eric's right hand while Ridge had been gone. She enjoyed working with her father-in-law as the go-to designer.\n\n\nAfter everyone had left Ridge alone in the Forrester office, he walked around and admired some designs. He smiled and sat down with a pencil and sketchpad. He tried the pencil in both hands but couldn't find a way to sketch. He ripped the sheets off the sketchpad and looked frustrated. He ripped off page after page, and a single tear streamed down his face. He wiped it away.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "While getting ready to return to work, Ridge notices a difference in dealing with his everyday activities. Ridge arrives at Forrester Creations to a warm welcome by his colleagues and family. Liam plans to take matters into his own hands to prevent what happened the night before from repeating itself. Bill is surprised to discover that Deacon was really the one behind Liam being saved from true harm. Wyatt learns that Quinn has taken refuge in an undisclosed location.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells Brooke it is almost like Christmas morning. They could have lost Ridge but he is coming back to FC today just like it used to be. He would have given Ridge more time but he says he is ready and they have to trust him. Ridge is getting dressed and can't wait, although Katie tells him that he doesn't have to rush if he needs more time. He wants to get on with his life .their life. Brooke checks with Katie and tells the group that they are on their way so they need to take their positions. Eric thanks her for pulling this all together. They all wait outside as Ridge drives up, leaves the car with the valet and starts to enter the building. They have a big Welcome Back sign and one by one Rick, Caroline, Carter, Maya, Pam and her lemon bars, Carter, Thorne and Aly hug him. Inside he says he knows it is going to take time to put the pieces of the puzzle together but he knows he can with the help of this beautiful woman by his side and their support. Bill, Hope and Liam visit Liam the next morning after his attack. Wyatt fixes Liam's necklace and puts it back on him .the least he could do. Bill can not believe they let that lunatic go. Hope says live by the sword, die by the sword so a restraining order is the least he can do. They joke about Wyatt stabbing the chair, that was not Quinn. He quips well she was not playing nice so he had to take her toys away from her. Bill says he is sorry, this is Wyatt's mother but she is a lunatic. There is a knock at the door and Wyatt says he called someone who might shed some light on this. They are all surprised to see Deacon. Bill is non too happy and says he made it clear before that Deacon is not welcome so he needs to quit popping up. Deacon says he came back to be close to his daughter and has nothing to do with Bill. Bill says okay just so he knows there is no reward in this but what did happen and what can he tell them. He scoffs when Deacon says he was at a bar ..and met Quinn who paid him no attention until she found out he was Hope's dad. She was nice enough to offer him a place to stay and while he was there he kept seeing her working on this very secretive project and it involved a blowtorch. But she finally let him see it but was still evasive. Then she left with it and he knew it was not good. Wyatt says that is when he showed up and he found out about the sword and came straight to Liam's. Liam says it's kind of funny. He is alive right now because of Hope's father, his brother and a chance encounter in a bar. He thanks them both. Bill says hugs and kisses all round but he hopes they are not all buying into Deacon's BS. He is just trying to worm his way back into Hope's life. She can make her own decisions but she knows how her own mother feels and she does not need this street trash back into her life trash. Trouble follows him everywhere he goes and this hookup with Quinn is just the latest example. Deacon starts to object; this was not a hookup with Quinn. Hope adds that she is glad as Liam would not be standing here today if Deacon had not known. Wyatt adds they did not see Quinn or look into her eyes. He got through to her and knows she will not be back. And Liam says he is the proud owner of a large sword that he will be taking with him everywhere. Bill says let that be a reminder to all of them just how crazy Quinn really is. Wyatt gets a phone call from a Doctor who tells him not to worry but Quinn checked herself into a mental health facility last night. She loves Wyatt and will be in touch when she can. He relays the message to the others and Liam says he is glad as he would not want Wyatt to lose his mother. Bill comes over and puts his arms around them and says they are beginning to sound like brothers and everything is okay. Later Liam asks Wyatt if his mother has ever done anything like his before. Wyatt says not to this extreme and when it happens he does not know what to do or how to help her. Liam admits that he spent a lot of time lumping the two of them together and that was a mistake. Hope goes to Wyatt and says he has proven that. He wishes them both the best. As he leaves, Liam stops him and hobbles over and gives him a big hug. Ollie kisses Aly just before she gets a call and has to go. He is left with Maya who says she thought he was avoiding her earlier. He says yes he was. He knows about the recording. Caroline tells Eric that she is glad Ridge is back but it was kind of fun being the great Eric Forrester's go to gal with his couture line and she could get used to that. Ridge enters his office and looks around at the sketches and designs. He grabs a drawing pad and pen and starts first with left hand, then right hand. He makes a few circles. A tear falls as he realizes he doesn't have a clue what he is doing.",
