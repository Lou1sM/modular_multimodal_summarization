He said Ivy should wear it, and Ivy laughed. Katie interrupted, and Wyatt left.\n\n\nKatie noted that Wyatt seemed to really like Ivy. Katie was happy to see that Ivy spent time with someone other than Liam. Ivy lamented that Liam spent all of his time with Steffy.\n\n\nKatie recommended that Ivy should not accept Liam's behavior. Katie said that Steffy would never let Liam out of her sight. Katie praised Ivy as gorgeous and smart. \"Keep your options open. Someone else in this building could be right for you,\" Katie advised.\n\n\nIvy noted that Wyatt was also interested in Steffy. Katie refused to let Ivy be a doormat. Katie encouraged Ivy to date Wyatt. Ivy admitted that Wyatt had made her laugh, and she didn't know where she'd be without him.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Aly was in her room and continued to destroy pictures of her family. The talking head of Darla ordered Aly to save Forrester. \"This is your mission, Aly. You must stop them. No one else can save the goodness of Forrester. It's got to be you,\" Darla said. Aly tearfully agreed.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office at Forrester, Steffy and Liam discussed that they still felt the good effects of the massage they'd had. Steffy said she felt they needed a permanent massage room at the company, and Wyatt said she was the president and could do whatever she wanted.\n\n\nLiam asked about the meeting Steffy had attended, and Steffy said that Aly had gone off the rails again. \"She still talks to her mom,\" Steffy said. Steffy worried that Aly had isolated herself from the real world and had a lot of extreme opinions and reactions. She worried that Aly was still suffering from her mom's death and Taylor's involvement in Darla's death.\n\n\nSteffy turned the conversation back to business, and she wondered if Liam had fun working at Forrester. He admitted that it was fun. Liam said he enjoyed working with his \"hipster, rocker ex-wife.\" They kissed. Aly entered.\n\n\nAly apologized for her previous behavior. She knew what she needed to do better, and she promised to do anything for Forrester Creations. Steffy and Liam were surprised. Aly vowed they would see a new side of her. \"I think you'll be surprised,\" she said.\n\n\nAly left, and Liam and Steffy agreed it would be nice to see a new and improved Aly. Steffy joked that perhaps Aly would no longer yell at her for wearing a bikini. Liam encouraged Steffy to put on a bikini right away, and Wyatt interrupted.\n\n\nWyatt worried that Steffy and Liam were back together. Steffy teased that Wyatt and Liam were \"like an old married couple.\" Wyatt didn't think it was funny. \"Have a little respect for Ivy,\" Wyatt said. He felt Liam and Steffy were getting cozy, and he demanded that Liam be honest with Ivy rather than string her along. Liam looked confused.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Maya met with Nick and worried that her mother would never accept her. She explained that her mother had tried to take Nicole away from Los Angeles and away from Maya. Nick congratulated Maya for forgiving Nicole for sharing Maya's secret. Maya said it hadn't been Nicole's fault.\n\n\nIn the office where Nicole was working as an intern, Wyatt entered and congratulated Nicole on becoming a full-time intern for the summer. He wanted to clear the air about what had happened between them. \"Is it a secret?\" Maya mocked him.\n\n\nNicole reminded Wyatt that he had used her and manipulated her. He had pretended to care to get information on Maya and had used it against her, but Wyatt said he had not pretended to care about Nicole.\n\n\nWyatt worried that Nicole wouldn't forgive him. Nicole said she didn't care anymore. Zende listened at the door, and he entered. Zende greeted Nicole and met Wyatt. He wondered if he had interrupted, but Nicole said Wyatt was leaving. Zende said goodbye to Wyatt, and Wyatt hoped that Nicole believed him. He left.\n\n\nZende quizzed Nicole about her relationship with Wyatt. Nicole thought it was cute that he was jealous, and Zende asked if she had kissed Wyatt. Nicole dismissed his questions, and Zende offered to take her out as long as she wasn't too busy with Wyatt.\n\n\nMaya entered and asked if Zende had had a good time at the Fourth of July party. Zende said he had, and he left. Maya said that Zende and Nicole made an adorable couple. Nicole noted that Wyatt had apologized to Nicole, but Maya didn't trust Wyatt. She thought Nicole would be better off with \"a nice guy like Zende.\" Maya thanked Nicole for staying with her instead of returning home with their mother.\n\n\nMaya admitted she'd felt rejected all over again. Nicole sympathized that it had to have been awful for Maya as a child. Maya confessed that she'd felt completely alone in the world and vulnerable. She added that it had made her push people away and isolate herself.\n\n\nWhile Maya spoke about isolation, a video of Aly showed that she was sitting in her closet, glaring at pictures of her family.\n\n\nMaya continued to discuss that people could become consumed by their own thoughts and obsessed with negativity. \"I was lucky I had a counselor to confide in and trust,\" Maya added. She worried about kids who made bad choices, but she acknowledged that people became depressed and felt their families had abandoned them. \"Bad thoughts take over,\" Maya said.\n\n\nThe screen flashed back to Aly and to Darla's death along the road when Darla had fallen into traffic and Taylor's car had hit her. Darla's screams echoed in the dark.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt and Ivy work together in dressing a model with her jewelry. Wyatt even wants Ivy to wear one not just sell it. She likes the stone. Katie walks in and wonders if she is interrupting anything. She comments that she sees how Wyatt is acting and how Ivy is smiling around him. Ivy says yes Wyatt makes her laugh and that is good since Liam is spending nearly all his time with Steffy. Katie says at some point Liam is going to have to make a choice yet they both know Steffy is not going to leave Liam out of her sight. And if Liam is going to date Steffy then Ivy should date others too. There might be someone right here in the building good for her. Ivy says she does appreciate Wyatt. He's good to her and somewhere she has to draw the line with Liam. She does not know what she would do without Wyatt but he is interested in Steffy too. Steffy thinks about the massage the day before and Liam says it was good and as President she should be able to do whatever she wants. She explains she did not get much done as at the meeting Aly went off the rails again. They both thought that behavior was past but clearly it is not and they worry abut her. Aly walks around her bedroom and goes to the closet and kneels down to the I Hate Steffy board where she has Xed out many pictures of her and Maya. Dark Darla tells her that they are evil and not to listen to them. She is the only one who can stop them and that is her mission. At the Sky Lounge Maya talks to Nick how her mother came to town, the same mother who gave birth to her and she is sure her father sent her to town to take Nicole away. Nicole was the one who spilled the information but she really meant no harm and Maya will not hold that against her and thinks she deserves a second chance. Nicole is putting some papers on Rick's desk when Wyatt walks in and Nicole ignores him even when he tries to be nice and talk to her. He congratulates her for being an intern now and he wanted to talk to her at the party. She asks if it is a secret as he used her. He admits it was unfair but Rick was so terrible they had to do something to get rid of him. He did not know Bill would use that information to out Maya. Wyatt says he was not pretending, he really did like Nicole. Zende walks in and she perks up. Wyatt is friendly with him too but leaves to find Rick. Nicole finds it amusing that Zende might be jealous and she teases him when he asks if she would go out with him sometimes. She plays coy and asks if he is asking. Maya interrupts and Nicole tells her she likes Zende but Wyatt apologized. Maya wonders if Nicole is still into him. Nicole says she probably could never trust Wyatt again. Maya is glad Nicole stayed in town and did not go back with their mother. She felt rejected all over again. Aly walks into Steffy's office with Steffy and Liam all cozy and looking over designs. Aly says she knows they are busy but she wants her to know that she knows what to do now and will do anything for FC. They will see a new side to her. Both are glad and Steffy says she does not want Aly to feel left out. Aly says they can not change the future but they can change the future. Steffy and Liam are impressed with the new and improved Aly. But the new and improved Aly is in her closet looking at the Steffy collage and thinking back to when Darla was hit by the car and died.",
