She asked Eric to check up on Ridge, but she didn't want to seem overly protective. Eric left to visit Ridge. \n\n\nKatie told Brooke that she didn't want to treat Ridge like he was \"going to break.\" Brooke worried that there was a reason to treat Ridge like he might break. Katie said things hadn't gotten back to normal as quickly as he had hoped, but the doctors had warned that it might happen. \"He has holes in his memory,\" Katie said. \"Things come back, and things click, but basic things -- it's frustrating for him,\" Katie explained.\n\n\nBrooke comforted Katie, and said that Ridge clearly loved and remembered Katie. Brooke said that it had been good to have her little sister back. Brooke added that she had learned -- after Ridge had nearly lost his life -- that life was precious. Brooke apologized for \"every harsh word.\" Katie said that they needed to put the past in the past and move forward as sisters. They embraced, and Brooke smiled.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Ridge tried to sketch but had no luck. He struggled to draw basic shapes. Eric entered and asked Ridge what he had been working on. Ridge looked up expressionless. Eric was amazed that Ridge had already been back to sketching. Eric surmised that Ridge had to have been inspired. \n\n\nEric asked to see what Ridge had been working on. Ridge refused. \"I could pull rank. I could claim it was intellectual property,\" Eric teased. Eric noticed that Ridge looked unhappy. \"Son, you all right? Anything wrong?\" Eric asked.\n\n\nRidge started to explain, but Eric received a call and had to leave. Ridge returned to the sketchpad and flashed back to sketching and designing clothes. Ridge grabbed his sketchpad and walked out the door. He went outside.\n\n\nEric returned to the office and discovered that Ridge was gone. Eric met with Brooke and Katie, and Brooke called security. She said that Ridge's car was gone. Katie was anxious. Katie asked to borrow Brooke's car. Eric and Brooke were worried. Brooke gave Katie her keys. \"Call us if you need anything,\" Eric said.\n\n\nRidge had driven to Katie's. He sat by a window in the bedroom and began to sketch. He couldn't draw, and he continued to rip pages from the tablet and throw them onto the floor. He broke the pencils and looked distraught.\n\n\nKatie knocked on the door. \"The door's locked -- can you let me in? I'm not kidding. Open the door,\" Katie demanded. She continued to knock. Ridge opened the door. Katie entered and saw the papers on the floor, and she hugged Ridge.\n\n\nOn the Forrester rooftop, Rick and Caroline discussed that the information they had about Oliver had been a blessing and a curse. Rick reconsidered playing the recording for Aly. Caroline supported Oliver. Caroline maintained that the tape had been made a very long time before, and Oliver had seemed sincere when they'd confronted him. \"Oliver was open and direct about his feelings,\" Caroline reminded Rick.\n\n\nCaroline blamed Maya for suspicious motives. Caroline accused \"Myrna\" of being a troublemaker. Caroline reminded Rick that Maya had caused trouble with Rick, Carter, Caroline, and Oliver. Caroline promised to keep her eye on Maya. Rick wondered if Maya had been sincerely worried about Aly. Caroline scoffed. Caroline insisted that Oliver would prove himself.\n\n\nAly showed up, and Rick and Caroline quizzed her about how Oliver had treated her. Aly said that Oliver had been respectful, kind, gentle, and patient. \"You guys are cute, but I don't need protection from Oliver,\" Aly said. She left.\n\n\nIn Oliver's office, Oliver shouted that Maya had blindsided him. \"Who the hell are you?\" Oliver asked. Maya haughtily claimed she had been looking out for Aly. Oliver disagreed. \"I'm crazy about her. I love her,\" he said.\n\n\nOliver accused Maya of being jealous. \"Caroline is married to a Forrester, and I'm dating one. That's what this is all about. You're jealous,\" Oliver said.\n\n\nMaya argued that Oliver didn't deserve Aly, and Maya accused Oliver of making Maya look bad in photos on purpose. \"And you're trying to replace me with Aly,\" she said.\n\n\nAly entered and noticed that things were tense. \"Let me know when you want to reshoot,\" Maya told Oliver. Aly asked if everything was all right. \"She didn't like the photos from the last shoot,\" Oliver said. \n\n\nAly asked if Oliver was okay. \"Much better now. Don't ever question the way I feel about you,\" Oliver replied. Aly promised that she wouldn't, and they kissed. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Oliver confronts Maya on whether her contempt against him is spawned from jealousy and lingering feelings towards him. Brooke and Katie reflect on their recently tumultuous relationship and agree to move forward in a positive direction. Ridge begins to panic when he realizes that his greatest talent has been hindered by the accident. Rick and Caroline debate about whether or not to play the recording of Oliver to Aly.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge throws the sketch pad down on the desk and draws a few circles but clearly is frustrated because he can not sketch a gown. Eric tells Brooke that it's good to have Ridge back. He's almost like his old self. She says yes, barreling in and taking charge. Katie listens but doesn't quite agree. She says it has been a confusing time for him but it helps with the support of his family and colleagues. She tells Brooke they need to be careful as she doesn't want to treat Ridge like he is going to break. It's frustrating. Basic things are not coming back to him and she wishes she could help. Eric walks in while Ridge is still drawing his circles. Eric says he is wasting no time; that's good. He casually asks what he's working on. Ridge is quiet and Eric asks if anything is wrong. Ridge tries to go back to his sketching and remembers some earlier times when he did. He grabs his pad and abruptly leaves. Rick sits at the Sky Lounge and Caroline joins him. He quips that he is waiting for his gorgeous wife so no need for her to hit on him. She quips too bad he didn't tell Maya that before she stalked him in the steam room. She brings up Ollie's recording and Rick says he knows he said he would give Ollie time, but he'd really like to get it out in the open. The more time Ollie spends with Aly the more hurt she will be. Caroline tells Rick that given a choice between Maya and Oliver and who to believe that she would pick him every time. Oliver confronts Maya and says she secretly recorded him and then played it for Rick and let him get blindsided. She says she was looking out for Aly. Oliver says he thought they were friends, now he can never trust her again. He's gotten to know Aly. She is so sweet and fresh and he's crazy about her; in fact he loves her. Maya says then he should have nothing to worry about. He says Caroline is married to a Forrester and he is dating one and Maya is just plain jealous. She says he is a player and she is not convinced his feelings are real. She even accuses him of making her last photo shots bad so he can replace her with Aly. At that moment Aly walks in and Maya leaves and tells Oliver to let her know when he wants to re-shoot. He tells Aly her timing was perfect. Forget about Maya; he just wants to make sure she knows how he feels about her and never question that. She assures him that he is her knight in shining armor. With Caroline's prodding, Rick says he will give Oliver the time he needs but he better not give him reason to fire him. Brooke tells Katie that she is sorry for every harsh word she said to her. She is glad they are acting like sisters again. She realized that even more so when Ridge was missing as life can change so quickly and never is as it is promised. Katie too says she thinks they should put the past in the past and move forward as sisters. Brooke makes the first move and they hug. Eric tells them that Ridge is missing; should they be worried. Katie tries to make light of it even though they came in together and he left her here. He just needed to clear his head. She borrows Brooke's car to drive home. Ridge charges into his bedroom, locks the door and flops in a chair with pad and paper in hand. But 5 or 6 pages later wadded up and on the floor, he is no further along than when he started. He snaps the pencil into and throws down the pad. Katie knocks on the door several times and demands that he open the door. She sees the look on his face and the pile of papers on the floor and immediately goes to him and they hug.",
