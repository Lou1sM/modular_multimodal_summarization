    "soap_central": "\n\nAt a coffee shop, Julius Avant arrived at Vivienne's table. Greeting her with a kiss, he declared that the nonsense stopped that day, and Nicole wouldn't spend one more night under Maya's influence.\n\n\nVivienne loved Maya but didn't know how to be around Maya or wrap her brain around what Maya expected her to understand. Julius asked how Vivienne could understand when it was unnatural. He didn't want the one innocent child they had left to be around it or for Nicole to be corrupted.\n\n\nVivienne didn't think Nicole seemed any different due to Maya. Julius pointed out that Nicole had uncharacteristically defied her mother, and he insisted that they'd get her out of there that day.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Nicole expressed embarrassment for the way she'd set out to use Maya's pain as a bargaining chip when she'd first arrived in town. Back then, Nicole hadn't thought about all Maya had gone through. Maya explained that she'd left home to get away from their parents' disapproval.\n\n\nNicole thought their father would be livid when their mother arrived home without Nicole. Maya murmured that she was the bane of her father's existence. Nicole complained that their parents had judged Maya without reaching out to see who Maya really was. Nicole didn't understand how their mother had touched Maya with such love but then walked away.\n\n\nMaya assumed that people feared what they didn't know, but the touch might be a step toward acceptance. Maya revealed that, when Vivienne had arrived at the mansion, Maya had thought it could have been for her. Shrugging, she said she'd hoped the motherly instinct had kicked in.\n\n\nIt amazed Nicole that Maya still wanted their parents' acceptance. Maya replied that they'd been the first people she'd loved. She wanted them to love her as she was. Nicole wished they'd see Maya for the inspiration she was, and she hated that they made Maya feel bad. Maya said it had only been for a second because Nicole was there. Nicole said Maya could always count on her.\n\n\nNicole received a call from her mother. Vivienne explained that she was at a coffee shop in town and wanted Nicole to meet her there right away. After the call, Nicole wondered why their mother was still in town. Maya figured it was for one more chance to get Nicole to return home. Maya didn't want Nicole to be estranged from their parents. Though their parents weren't as embracing as Maya and Nicole wanted them to be, Maya felt that they deserved acceptance, too.\n\n\nLater, Rick was with Maya, who explained that Vivienne might be trying again with Nicole. Maya didn't think Vivienne would succeed and was worried that her father wouldn't accept Nicole's choices. Maya didn't want Nicole's relationship with their parents to suffer due to her.\n\n\nRick asked what it had been like for Maya to see her mother again. Maya said it had been uplifting -- until she'd seen the look in her mother's eyes. Maya said she'd never stopped hoping to reconcile with her parents and for her father to stop seeing her as the son that never was.\n\n\nAt the coffee shop, Nicole sat at her mother's table to find out why her mother hadn't left town yet. Julius stepped up to the table and told Nicole that she'd be going home that day. Nicole refused, and he told her that she was a young, impressible girl who was in over her head. Nicole asserted that she was making a life there, and she had a job.\n\n\nJulius found the fashion industry questionable and thought Nicole would land in a world of trouble. Nicole said it wasn't his call, and she was grown. He insisted that as long as he was the head of their family, he'd look out for her best interests. Nicole asserted that her father wasn't listening.\n\n\nNicole said she was building a life there and had met a guy while interning whom Julius might like. She conveyed that Forrester wasn't a shady business. She wanted to learn Forrester and get to know her sister. Julius asserted that Nicole's sister was a freak, and that was all Nicole needed to know.\n\n\nNicole exclaimed that Maya wasn't a freak, and Julius had never tried to know her. Julius declared that he never would, and Nicole's brother, sister -- or whatever he'd become and whatever he'd done -- Julius didn't recognize his son. Nicole replied that it was because a son was what he was looking for, but Maya was a woman. Julius declared that \"that child\" was lost to him. He refused to lose Nicole, too, and demanded that she return home that day.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ivy admitted that the time Liam and Steffy could legitimately spend behind closed doors was unnerving. Katie believed Steffy wouldn't let go once she'd zeroed in on something. Katie warned that Steffy could pull Ivy into the mud, but if Ivy chose to move on, Wyatt was an option.\n\n\nIvy felt that Wyatt might act cocky, but he was also empathetic and understood her feelings without her expressing them. Katie found it to be a rare quality in a man. Ivy remarked that Hope had been crazy to let Wyatt go, but then Ivy considered that Hope had let Liam go, too. Ivy hoped that Steffy would follow suit, but Katie warned that Steffy was tenacious.\n\n\nThough Ivy and Liam didn't share what he and Steffy did, Ivy felt that she was important, too, and she didn't want to be replaced so easily. Katie returned to talking about how eligible Wyatt was. Katie wanted Ivy to be happy. Ivy relayed that Liam did that for her. Ivy saw Steffy as a massive bump in the road, but Ivy wouldn't just hand Liam over.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Wyatt demanded to know if Liam was stringing Ivy along. Liam asked if his brother had become Ivy's protector. Liam claimed Ivy didn't need protecting from him, and Wyatt decided that he'd discern that after Liam answered him. Liam said he wasn't leading Ivy on and had been completely upfront since the beginning. Wyatt asked if Liam was still being up-front.\n\n\nLiam asserted that he cared for Ivy, but the immigration thing had made him see that he wasn't ready to lose Steffy forever. \"Why do you have to have all the women?\" Wyatt argued. Wyatt said Liam was making eyes at Steffy while Ivy waited for her turn. \"Pick a lane, dude!\" Wyatt insisted.\n\n\nWyatt thought Ivy was a good person, but Liam exclaimed that Wyatt didn't need to sell him on Ivy. Wyatt ordered Liam to treat her better. Wyatt told Liam to be with Steffy and do what he had to do without dragging around Ivy, who deserved to be treated better than second best.\n\n\nWyatt left, and Steffy noted that the Spencer boys liked Ivy Forrester. Liam agreed and asked what there was not to like. Steffy mumbled that she might need to get to know Ivy better. Liam laughed at the thought of Ivy and Steffy being friends.\n\n\nSteffy and Liam reviewed a sketch, and Steffy smiled amorously at him. She said she'd known \"this\" would happen. He asked her what would, and she replied, \"Us.\" She elaborated that they were working together and bouncing ideas off each other. She thought it was fun.\n\n\nLiam replied that Steffy was the most fun he'd ever had. Steffy said it hadn't always been fun, but he told her that they didn't have to go there. Steffy felt she was strong enough to reflect on it. She'd never considered herself a quitter, but she'd quit on him and left him to deal with the pain alone. She knew it had had a lingering effect, and he didn't trust her to stay.\n\n\nLiam told Steffy that he didn't blame her for anything. She said she knew, and she wasn't running away. She told him that she was where she belonged -- with him.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ivy was alone, studying a sketch, when she noticed Wyatt in the doorway, looking at her. He said he was appreciating her and thinking of her. He insisted she deserved better treatment from Liam. Ivy stated that he was displaying the protective streak that she'd just been talking to Katie about. Wyatt was impressed that he'd been the topic of conversation.\n\n\nIvy said she and Katie had been discussing Spencer men in general, and she drew his attention to the sketch that had her stumped. Wyatt made her step away from the easel and said the ideas would happen for her. Sitting down, Ivy figured that she needed a distraction. Wyatt guessed it'd be from Liam. Ivy said that Katie had all but said that Ivy had already lost Liam to Steffy.\n\n\nIvy and Wyatt worked on jewelry, and Wyatt griped about expecting to get to know Steffy that summer. Ivy replied that he could still see Steffy, but he quipped that Steffy couldn't see \"through\" Liam to see Wyatt. Ivy informed him that there were other women in town. Wyatt claimed to know it but wondered where he'd find a total package like Steffy.\n\n\nIvy said she felt the same way about the sweet, charming Liam. She wished someone would tell her where another guy like Liam hung out. \"Yeah...\" Wyatt murmured unwittingly. Ivy glanced at him and smiled.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Julius Avant arrives in Los Angeles and meets up with his wife Vivienne. He makes it clear that he wants Nicole home immediately as he does not want her around Maya any longer.

Ivy and Wyatt banter. Nicole is shocked to see her father who tells her that she will be leaving L.A. with her parents - today!",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nicole thinks back when she first came to L.A. and looked Maya up ..and her attitude toward her sister. And she used information about her that was uncalled for. She is sorry about that now but Maya refuses to blame her. Nicole sees now why Maya had no choice but to leave her parent's household, and Nicole vows not to go back either. She thinks her mother knows that. And it is amazing how she can seem to love Maya and touch her yet walk away. Vivienne sits at an outside restaurant and a Julius walks up and kisses her on the cheek. He says he came as quickly as he could. Nicole will not spend one more day under Maya's influence. He does not want her corrupted. Katie understands how annoying it must be for Ivy to see Steffy and Liam spending so much time alone behind closed doors saying it is work. She hopes Ivy will be realistic about this as when Steffy wants something she will not give up. She will fight and if Ivy does move on, then Wyatt is not a bad place to land. Ivy agrees that Wyatt may come off as cocky and sarcastic but underneath he has a real warmth. It is like he knows what she is thinking without her having to say it and that is a great quality in a man. She knows too that Steffy is a massive bump in the road but she is not ready to just hand Liam over to Steffy. Katie understands but says Wyatt is another option and Ivy would not be settling as he is quite the catch. Wyatt does interrupt Liam and Steffy and gets in a dig how exceptional Ivy is and if Liam is stringing her along. Steffy seems interested in that answer too. Liam asks if Wyatt is suddenly Ivy's protector. He claims he has been 100% honest with Ivy from the time that Steffy came back. That was a wakeup call that he might lose her and he was not ready for that. Wyatt respects that but says it is not fair for him to make goo goo eyes at Steffy when Ivy is just down the hall waiting her turn. She is better than second best. Nicole can not believe Vivienne came all the way here to drag her back home. Maya agrees and says when she first saw her mother she was hoping she had come to see her and show some motherly instinct. She is just glad Nicole is there now and she can count on her sister. Vivienne calls and tells Nicole that she is still in town and wants to see her right away. Nicole says she will meet her. Maya tells Rick that her mother did not go home and her guess is she is going to try one more time to get her to come home. But she really does not want Nicole's relationship with her parents to suffer because of Maya. Nicole is shocked when she sees her father with her mother. He gets right to the point that she can go get her bags as he is taking her home. She replies no, she likes it here in L.A. and is old enough to make her own decisions. She says FC is a really great fashion place and she has even met a young man there she likes a lot. She wants to learn and even learn more about her sister in the process. Julius calls Maya a freak and says that is all Nicole needs to know. Vivienne looks offended. Maya tells Rick that she thought she would be over it by now but it was very uplifting to see her mother again and the truth is she never stopped hoping for a reconciliation. It is probably not likely but it would mean so much. Nicole tells her dad that Maya is not a freak and he never gave himself a chance to know her. He says that child is lost to both him and her mother. He will not lose Nicole too so she is coming home with them. She will have to accept that.",
