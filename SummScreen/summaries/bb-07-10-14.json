Rick remarked that Ridge needed to be on top of his game. Eric was confident that the recovering Ridge would lead the business into the future, and Brooke scowled.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Eric that Ridge designed and shared a vice-presidency with her, but Rick was the president. Eric told Brooke not to worry because Ridge would be consumed with designing.\n\n\nThe topic changed to Quinn and Wyatt's departure, and Hope told Rick and Eric that Quinn had threatened her and Liam. Everyone thought it was for the best that Quinn had gone, but they believed that HFTF would suffer for the loss of her talents. Rick and Eric announced that they were vetting someone for Quinn's replacement. \"You remember my brother John's, daughter, Ivy?\" Eric asked.\n\n\nBrooke and Hope were excited to hear the news about Ivy, who'd designed jewelry for Forrester's Sydney boutique. Hope had heard good things about the designs. Brooke wanted to fly Ivy out for a meeting, and Rick announced that Ivy had already taken the long flight from Australia.\n\n\nEveryone was ecstatic when Rick opened the door to the office and Ivy entered. Brooke, Rick, and Eric hugged Ivy, and Hope introduced herself with a hug. Eric welcomed his niece to Los Angeles.\n\n\nBrooke took off to meet Bill, and Eric offered to give Ivy a tour of the headquarters later. Rick asked to see Ivy's work and for her to describe it. Ivy deemed it classical and fresh with an edgy twist. Hope fell in love with a bangle bracelet of Ivy's, and Ivy insisted that Hope keep it. Ivy stepped out to ask Pam to film the building tour, and Eric asked Hope what she thought of Ivy.\n\n\nHope thought that Ivy showed real potential and had unique work. Hope asked if Ivy knew that she was a prospect to replace Quinn's company, and Eric responded that Ivy believed the family was simply touching base. Rick added that they hadn't wanted to pressure Ivy. Eric had no doubt about Ivy's dedication, and he believed she'd fit in well. Rick foresaw no problems with Ivy, and he asked if Hope thought they should give Ivy a chance.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Justin caught Bill up on the status of the business, and Bill said that in a month, it would be like Hurricane Katie had never occurred.\n\n\nAn employee entered to say she'd tried to drop her child off at the Spencer daycare, but it was closed. Bill pulled out an envelope with two thousand dollars in it and told her to enroll the child in preschool. She said the child was less than a year old, but Bill figured it was never too soon to learn.\n\n\nAs the put-off woman left with the money, Alison arrived with something Katie had left behind. Bill said to get rid of it because he wanted no reminders that Katie had ever been in his chair. He directed Alison to put out a memo eliminating Katie's eight-to-five rule, because one wasn't working unless he was putting in overtime. Justin asked what would happen to the yoga studio.\n\n\nBill became perplexed by why Katie had installed a yoga studio, but Justin said it had been Liam. Alison added that it relieved stress. \"It's not decreasing my stress! No wonder we're so far in the hole! My life's work turned into a multi-million dollar health spa....Well, no more. We're going to get back to the business of being miserable and making some real money again!\" Bill decreed.\n\n\nAfter Alison had gone, Bill grew further incensed to hear about the free meals in the cafeteria, juice bars, and free-range meat service. He declared that there would be no more free lunches, and Justin warned that Bill would have a lot of unhappy employees. Bill responded that he'd said nothing about cutting pay, but it would be next on the list if they didn't turn the company around immediately.\n\n\nJustin was sure Bill would get it done. Bill quipped that he did get things done, unlike others who had to brush up on their helicopter skills. Justin asked for more warning before Bill decided to dump someone in the Gulf. Justin said they were lucky Ridge didn't remember anything about the flight, because Justin had been worried that he'd have to go to the slammer.\n\n\nBill assured Justin that they were in the clear, and Ridge had survived as good as new. The men felt as if they'd dodged a bullet. Bill claimed he hadn't been trying to kill Ridge, just trying to teach him a lesson. Bill had had no idea Ridge would go missing and noted that the concussion had been his and Justin's saving grace. Bill said it would be \"both our asses\" if Ridge remembered the pilot.\n\n\nBrooke arrived, and Justin took off. Brooke and Bill kissed, and Brooke joked that people were probably shaking in their boots to have Bill back at the company's helm. Bill asked if he was that bad, and she revealed that he wasn't as ruthless as people believed. She added that she'd heard he was dangerous, and he'd do anything to get what he wanted. She said it was true because he'd do anything for her. They hugged, and Bill looked troubled.\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Katie assured Ridge that his gift wasn't lost. Ridge said he could remember his tenth birthday as if it had been the other day, but he couldn't remember how to design a dress. She urged him to be patient with himself, but he murmured that designing was who he was.\n\n\nRidge feared that designing would never return to him. Katie asked him to be patient with himself, but Ridge said he wanted to get the designs out of his head and onto the paper. He'd found solace in the gift he'd been given, but it was no more. She was sure he'd spend many more years doing it; he just had to ease back into it. \"No...It's gone...\" he uttered.\n\n\nRidge relayed that he'd seen his father earlier but hadn't mentioned the struggle because everyone was expecting big things from him. Katie felt that Eric, of all people, would understand, but Ridge didn't want Katie to tell anyone about it. He was sure Rick would attack upon seeing a weakness. She disagreed about Rick but promised not to say anything to anyone.\n\n\nKatie asked Ridge to close his eyes, relax, and breathe. He complied, and she told him to just let whatever thoughts he had be there in his mind. She said he could think about family and friends, and eventually, he'd remember the dresses, the shows, and the successes.\n\n\nRidge flashed back to designing and dresses. Suddenly, violent memories of the beach wedding crashed into his mind. He saw the pilot's profile. Ridge's memory honed in on the Spencer logo on Justin's jacket, and Ridge's eyes popped open. Katie asked him what he'd remembered. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Eric calls a company meeting to exhibit the new direction that Ridge\u2019s designs will be leading the company. Bill begins to make significant changes in the protocols that Katie implemented during her time as president of Spencer Publications. Ivy Forrester arrives in Los Angeles for a visit which puts her at the right place at the right time. Ridge pleads with Katie to keep his heartbreaking secret.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie holds Ridge and tries to comfort him by saying he is a brilliant designer and it will all come back in time. He's not so sure. She says she will not let him think like that. He just came back to work too soon; just let it come and ease into it. He is afraid it is gone. Brooke makes excuses for Ridge and says he won't be at this meeting; he needed some time. He'll be at the top of his game soon. Hope catches them up on what Quinn did to threaten her and Liam. Wyatt saved the day so all is fine but she is glad Quinn is gone from the company. Eric agrees; good riddance as she was responsible for Ridge's missing too. Eric tells them about Ivy, a jewelry designer, who is his brother's daughter. They want to bring her in and see if she can fill the void of Quinn. Rick surprises them by opening the door and there she is. Eric welcomes her to L.A. and she hugs all of them, glad to be here. With Justin at his side, Bill tells Allison to get rid of any reminders of Katie. He doesn't want anything to remind him that she was once sitting in his chair. He tells an employee who asks that the daycare is closed. He gives her money to put her kid in another daycare. He tells Justin and Allison they can all go back to being miserable, no more free lunches for all and now they can make some real money again. Hope sees Ivy's designs and thinks she has great potential. Eric says he thinks FC could benefit with her aboard. They have not offered her anything. They did not want to scare her off. Rick tells Hope she has good instincts and he asks if she will give Ivy a chance. Katie has Ridge sit down and relax, just think about his family, his children, let any thoughts come into his head. He'll eventually remember all the fashion shows, all his triumphs, it will all come back come back .come back. Suddenly he bolts upright and remembers the desert wedding and punching Bill and running off with Brooke and entering the helicopter ..and seeing the SP logo on jacket.",
