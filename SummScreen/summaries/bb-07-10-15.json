    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the coffee shop, Nicole refused to be dragged back to the cold house in Illinois, where they never discussed important things and pretended not to feel. She welcomed her parents to partake in her new life, but she refused to go back to the old one. Vivienne tried to reason with Julius, but he was adamant about protecting his daughter from Maya. \n\n\nNicole didn't like Julius to say Maya's name as if it was fake. \"Well, isn't it?\" Julius responded, adding that he'd rather not say the name at all. He asserted that he had only one daughter; he'd had a son, but the son was gone. Nicole asked if Julius' pride had made him think he'd failed as a father.\n\n\nJulius didn't think pride was wrong. He said he and Vivienne didn't want to feel the stares in church or see people gossiping about them. Nicole asked what if the people were staring or gossiping about Maya's success. Julius asked why the people wouldn't just talk to him if it was the case.\n\n\nNicole claimed there was nothing approachable about her father and asked what neighbor would dare congratulate him on his daughter's modeling gig. Appalled, Julius said he couldn't talk about it to the neighbors and church members who'd watched Myron learn to ride a bike and drive a car. He stated that they'd watched \"him\" grow up. \"Into the woman that she is today,\" Nicole added.\n\n\nNicole thought her parents should be proud of it. Her words resonated with Vivienne, who relayed that Maya's house was incredible. \"So what?\" Julius growled. Shocked, Nicole said Maya lived in Beverly Hills and might marry a Forrester. The statement meant nothing to Julius.\n\n\nNicole told her father that he should be impressed that Maya was the lead model at the top design house. Julius said he hadn't spent a bunch of money to fly out there and feel awe at a 90210 address. He'd done it to save the only child he felt he had left. Nicole claimed not to need saving.\n\n\nNicole wanted to get to know her sister. Julius scoffed, but Nicole said he actually understood it because he'd only called her sister Maya. He said he'd done it because Myron had shown up at Nicole's school in a dress, and he asked if Nicole thought he'd let her believe \"that freak\" had been her brother.\n\n\n\"Julius, please!\" Vivienne exclaimed. Julius said Nicole's parents had agreed to use the Maya name to keep Nicole from asking questions. Vivienne said she'd had to remove all the pictures. Julius conveyed that when \"he'd\" gone to jail, it had almost been a relief. Vivienne told Julius not to say that, but he insisted that it had stopped the worry that \"he'd\" show up and confuse Nicole.\n\n\n\"Her showing up,\" Nicole corrected. Julius stated that the modeling business had cropped up, and they'd had to deal with people whispering. Nicole asked how he couldn't be proud that Maya was on fashion covers and living the life she'd been meant to. He replied that the fashion business had nothing to do with him or what he'd wanted for his son -- and \"this -- this Maya Avant -- I don't even know who she is!\" Nicole said he could, and they could move to Los Angeles when Julius retired.\n\n\nNicole's parents exchanged glances. Vivienne said Julius was looking for work again. He'd had a \"seasonal\" job, he claimed, but there had been a \"sudden\" turn. \"Not because of Maya!\" Vivienne exclaimed. Julius stated that the family had been intact. Everything had been good until Maya had done what she'd done.\n\n\nNicole said Maya had merely become who she was, but Julius asked if Nicole knew how stressful it had been to have a child like that. \"I mean, so disrespectful, self-centered, perverted, dressing up in women's clothing! It was an embarrassment!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\nNicole corrected that Maya had dressed in her own clothes, and she asked if Julius still thought there had ever been anything male about Maya -- because there hadn't been. She didn't see why, as parents, Julius and Vivienne weren't thrilled that Maya was finally in her own skin. Julius replied that he couldn't be happy for what \"he'd\" chosen to do. Julius couldn't understand or accept it.\n\n\nNicole said it was why she wouldn't return to Julius' oppressive home. She'd found the sister that he'd been so ashamed to love. Nicole loved her sister and felt that, unfortunately, she'd be all Maya had. Nicole told them to go home, close the curtains, and never speak of the daughter they'd cast aside, but their shame and embarrassment had caused them to lose both of their children.\n\n\nLater, Nicole had gone, and Julius questioned his bill, telling the waiter that he'd only had three drinks. She checked it and said it was correct. Vivienne told him to put it on the card, and they'd pay for it when he got a job. Julius griped that they'd spent enough, and it was time to go home.\n\n\nVivienne said they wouldn't until he'd seen his daughter. Julius wanted to see his son, not what his son had become. She said they'd leave after going to Maya's house, and he needed to see Maya.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Rick urged Maya to text-message Nicole. Maya figured that Vivienne and Nicole were bonding, and a text from Maya would kill the moment. Rick admired Maya for caring about the mother-daughter relationship. She said Rick knew what it was like to have a parent give up on him. She didn't have a relationship with her parents, but she believed that Nicole still could.\n\n\nRick asked if Maya was really sure there was no hope with her parents. Maya said that when she'd finally had the courage to stop hiding, her parents had turned their backs upon her instead of taking the opportunity to show her unconditional love. Rick wondered if time had changed things, and he said it was possible that Vivienne would want to know the child she had given birth to.\n\n\nMaya didn't hold out hope for it after the way Vivienne had walked out. She'd worked hard to get away from her parents' disapproval, but she'd longed for their approval. She'd fantasized that her mother would go home and tell her father how beautiful she'd become and how she'd made something of herself. She was grateful that Rick believed in her, but she wished her parents would.\n\n\nRick offered to take Maya to see her parents, but she didn't want to do that after the last time she'd been at the house to see Nicole. She said she'd worn her dress to show her seriousness, and her parents had been polite until Nicole had gone upstairs. Maya said she'd no longer been alive to her father, and her mother, who'd never contradict her father, had just stared at her.\n\n\nMaya said it had been hard but freeing, because it had enabled her to give up the wish. She said that when Rick had finally gotten his father's approval, it had meant everything to him. Maya said the person she'd become didn't matter to her father, and she'd always be second to Myron, who didn't exist. She exclaimed that she did exist, and she was waiting for her parents to see it.\n\n\nLater, Rick was alone when Nicole arrived. Upset, Nicole ranted about her meeting with her mother, who'd had her father there as a reinforcement. Nicole was livid about her parents trying to drag her from her sister. She said it was sad about how ashamed and intolerant they'd been without knowing Maya. Rick thought that maybe her father should meet Maya again. Nicole dismissed it, insisting her father refused to accept Maya, and Nicole doubted he ever would.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Vivienne and Julius waited, remarking on how the maid had offered to get them tea. Vivienne gasped upon seeing Maya's portrait on the wall. Julius said it was a far cry from the family photo they'd taken when Myron had been in kindergarten. They laughed about how \"eighties\" it had been. Vivienne encouraged Julius to look at the view.\n\n\nJulius didn't care to see the smog, but Vivienne marveled at the backyard. Awed by the life Maya had made for herself, Vivienne said they'd lost years with Maya, and it would be nice to start fresh and get to know their daughter. Julius said he only had one daughter, but Vivienne replied that Maya hadn't been their son for years, and they should acknowledge it. She again told him to look at the life Maya had made for herself and urged him to be open to the possibilities.\n\n\nMaya arrived home and grew nervous when she saw her parents in the house. She asked her father what he was doing in Los Angeles. \"I had to see my little girl,\" he replied. He mirthlessly hugged Maya, who directed a confused stare to her mother.\n\n\n",

Julius remarks that Maya's recent modeling career made him a spectacle in their hometown again because the truth is that his son Myron is a freak! Nicole cannot understand why her parents aren't thrilled that Maya is finally comfortable in her own skin. She says that she won't go back to Julius' repressive home pretending that her sister is not existing. Meanwhile, Maya tells Rick how she hopes to have a relationship with her parents someday.

    "tvmega_recap": "Julius demands that Nicole come home with them. They have already lost one child, he will not lose Nicole too. He wants her as far away from Maya as possible. Nicole declares that she is an adult now and he has no say so over her. Her home is now L.A. and he and Vivienne are welcome to stay here too but she is not going back to her former cold home. Maya is now her sister's name and she can not stand for him to call her sister by contempt. He says he only has one daughter now and that is Nicole. They can not go to church or even walk down their own street without neighbors gossiping. She tells him no one is going to approach him as he would shut them down right away. All he wants to talk about is the weather or how the Cubs are playing. He and Nicole argue back and forth but he will not budge. He is not impressed by the Forrester name. He came out here for one reason only and that is to save the one child they have left. Rick and Maya talk and he says her mother sought her out so that has to count for something. She says she is stronger now but there is one little part of her that still wants her mother's approval and love. She hoped her mother would go home and tell her father what she had become and what a good life she had now. She knows Maya will always be second to Myron. It's like she does not exist but she wants them to see it. Rick should know how that feels wanting the parent's approval. Nicole tells Julius that she likes her sister and she is not walking out on her now. He can not believe she wants to call that freak her sister. He let Maya go then so people would stop talking. He even blames Maya for things spiraling out of control and he even lost his job. What an embarrassment! Nicole can not believe they are not finally acceptable of Maya being comfortable in her own skin. Nicole says just know this their shame and embarrassment is not losing just one child but now both of them. Rick tells Maya that she ought to call Nicole but she says no she can not come between Nicole and her parents. She knows how that feels. Julius grouses but pays the bill. Then he wants to go home. Vivienne says not just yet. She wants him to at least see his other daughter and where she lives. The maid lets them in the house and they look around in wonderment. Nicole stops in at the office and Rick tells her that Maya went home. She says she is staying in L. A. and it is so sad how ignorant and intolerant her parents are. Her dad refuses to accept her and she doubts he ever will. Julius tells Vivienne these folks sure find ways to waste their money. Vivienne says it looks like Maya was right. She sure has created a new life here. Vivienne says they will stay a while, after all both of their daughters are here. They have not had a son in years and it is time to acknowledge that. That is all she is asking. Maya walks in and is shocked to see her mom and dad. She asks what they are doing here and why he has come. He hugs her and says he had to see his little girl.",
