Saying he'd check in on them later, the doctor assured Brooke that R.J. would be fine. The doctor left, and Brooke asked Coco to let her speak to R.J. alone.\n\n\nOnce Coco exited the room, she received a call from Sally, who'd missed Coco at the barbeque. Coco responded awkwardly, and Sally asked if everything was okay. Coco revealed that she was okay, but R.J. was in the hospital after a car accident. Sally repeated Coco, and Thomas, who was with Sally at Spectra, took her outstretched phone from her and put it on speaker.\n\n\nThomas asked what had happened. Coco said that R.J. had a few mild cuts and bruising, but the doctor had said he'd be fine. Thomas wanted to speak to his brother, but Coco said R.J. was talking to Brooke. Sally asked how the accident had happened.\n\n\nCoco explained that R.J. had let her drive one of Ridge's classic cars. Sally asked if someone had hit the car. Coco replied that she'd run into a tree. Coco thanked God that R.J. was okay. Sally was sure it wasn't Coco's fault and said things happened. \"It shouldn't have,\" Coco responded.\n\n\nBack in R.J.'s room, Brooke noted that R.J. still hadn't told her why Coco had been driving the car or how Coco had crashed it. R.J. replied that he knew Coco had never driven a car like it before, and he'd wanted to impress her and give Coco a rush. He said she wasn't a bad driver, and stuff just happened. Brooke asked to hear exactly what had happened.\n\n\nLieutenant Baker arrived. He had just been at the crash site. He noted that R.J. looked good and said it could have been worse, \"all things considered.\" He whipped out a notepad and asked if R.J. had been driving. Coco entered and said she'd been the driver.\n\n\nBaker recognized Coco as Sally's sister. He asked for the details of the accident. Coco replied that she'd lost control and hit a tree. Baker asked what had made her lose control. R.J. remarked upon the old power steering on his father's car. Baker assumed R.J. had let Coco drive the car to impress her. R.J. stated that power steering had advanced a long way, and \"as cool as it is, it gets away from you sometimes.\"\n\n\nLt. Baker assumed the statement meant that R.J. had also been driving recklessly. R.J. denied it. Baker asked Coco if she'd been drinking, and Coco swore she hadn't. R.J. said it could have happened to anyone. Remarking that it had been an odd occurrence for a clear day, Baker asked if Coco had gotten distracted.\n\n\nR.J. asked for the questions to stop. He noted that Coco was shaking and asked her to sit at his bedside. Coco sat on the left side of the bed. R.J. said Coco had never been in an accident before. He promised that it wouldn't happen again.\n\n\nBrooke stated that it wasn't good enough. She and Baker needed answers. \"You don't just drive down the street and hit a tree,\" she concluded. R.J. didn't know what Brooke wanted to hear. He said they hadn't been drinking or doing drugs. They'd just been having a good time when things had gone bad.\n\n\nLt. Baker said the question was why things had gone bad. Baker pointed out that R.J. was answering all the questions, and it seemed like he was trying to protect his girlfriend. R.J. replied that Coco didn't need protection. Brooke asked if the two had been goofing off. \"Were you texting, Coco? Is that what caused this accident?\" Brooke asked.\n\n\nLt. Baker pressed Coco to answer the question, and Coco said it was true. R.J. readily stated that Coco had made a mistake and asked if they could leave it at that. Baker emphasized the seriousness of it. He informed them that texting and driving was illegal in the state, and over three thousand people per year died due to distracted driving.\n\n\nBrooke said that R.J. knew better, and his parents had had numerous talks with him about it. Coco said Grams had talked to her, too. Brooke asked why, if that was true, Coco had done it and shouted that she could have killed Brooke's son. R.J. said they were sorry, and it wouldn't happen again. \"I didn't -- I didn't think that it -- \" Coco stammered.\n\n\nAssuming Coco would say that she didn't think it could happen to her, Baker stated that everyone thought the same way; however, it only took a second with one's eyes off the road. Coco asked what happened next. Baker relayed that there were consequences for her actions. He planned to file his report and get back to her.\n\n\nAs Baker exited, Brooke asserted, \"The next time you're driving -- which isn't going to be for a very long time -- you're not going to be on your phone. Either one of you!\"\n\n\nBrooke left the room, and through the viewing window, Coco watched Brooke talk to Lt. Baker. Coco felt Brooke was right that Coco could have killed R.J., and it would have been for a stupid text message. Coco apologized to R.J. and wondered what would happen. R.J. said it was an accident, and nothing would happen.\n\n\nCoco insisted that it had been all on her and totally her fault. R.J. didn't want Coco to blame herself. Stating that his mom did, Coco wondered what she'd been thinking to text and drive. She said she could have killed him, and Baker was right about there being consequences. Coco felt that she deserved them. She said things could have been \"so, so tragic.\"\n\n\nR.J. pointed out that it hadn't been tragic. Coco thanked God for that, but she said it wasn't over. She wasn't sure it should be over and wondered if there was more she was supposed to learn. R.J. promised that Coco wouldn't be alone in it, and they'd get through it together. Coco said R.J. meant \"so much\" to her. She said she was \"so sorry,\" and she hugged him.\n\n\nBack at Spectra, Thomas ended a call with the hospital doctor. He told Sally that Coco had been right, and R.J. was okay. Sally asked if he wanted to go to the hospital to give Coco and R.J. a good \"talking-to.\" Thomas said the pair had already had a rough day, and R.J. would go home sometime that day. Sally planned to give it to Coco the very next time she saw Coco.\n\n\n To Thomas, Sally sounded like a mother. Sally said she practically had been a mother and sister rolled into one, and she'd always felt responsible for her sister. Thomas asked about Grams, and Sally explained that Grams had had the bakery, which had put Sally on constant Coco duty.\n\n\nSally said she loved Coco and would always be in Coco's corner. Thomas said Sally would be an amazing mother someday, and Sally joked that she pitied any child of hers. Sally conveyed that she was overprotective of the people she loved, and she'd be \"a case\" if anything happened to Thomas or Coco. She hugged Thomas and said nothing was allowed to happen to her sister.\n\n\nLater, the frustrated Sally ripped a sheet off her pad and threw it in the trash. She was still upset about what could have happened to Coco. Sally said it was strange how quickly things could change. Thomas said that Coco and R.J. had been looking to have fun, and \"bam! Look what happened.\" Thomas stated that things could change in good ways, too.\n\n\nSally said it hadn't been that long back that she'd been working at the bakery. Thomas told her to look at what she'd become. She'd changed his life in unexpected ways, and he never wanted it to end. His words overwhelmed her. She didn't want the bottom to fall out -- as it always had done before. Thomas hugged her.\n\n\nThomas assured Sally that the bottom wouldn't drop out. Sally believed she had a pattern of losing good things that happened to her, and Thomas had been the best thing to happen to her \"since forever.\" Thomas said that she always talked about endings, but he was always talking about beginnings. He declared that he wouldn't go anywhere without her.\n\n\nThe landline buzzed. Thomas answered it. After struggling to explain something to the caller, he decided to go down there. After the call, Thomas said it was as if Saul knew when Thomas and Sally were making out. Thomas left to deal with Saul's issue, and Sally sat down to work.\n\n\nThe landline rang instead of buzzed. Sally called for Darlita to answer it. It kept ringing, so Sally answered it. The caller asked for Sally, and Sally said it was she. Sally asked who was calling. \"Caroline Spencer,\" the caller replied. Sally stated that it was the mother of Thomas' child.\n\n\n\"Oh. So he has told you about Douglas,\" Caroline replied. Caroline wanted to speak to Thomas, but Sally said he wasn't there. Sally asked if Caroline had tried his cell phone. Caroline affirmed that she'd tried it. Sally asked if Caroline wanted Sally to take a message.\n\n\nCaroline did. She said she knew Sally and Thomas were in a relationship, but Caroline and Thomas had a son to think about. \"...Okay...\" Sally replied. Caroline asked Sally to have Thomas call, and Caroline would take it from there.\n\n\n",
