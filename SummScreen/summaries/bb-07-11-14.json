He'd gotten his company and equal custody of his son, but he'd yet to marry the \"luscious Brooke Logan.\" Though Bill respected that she wanted the families at the wedding, he was concerned that each day that passed increased the chances of something else derailing their wedding.\n\n\nBrooke couldn't imagine what could happen, and Bill theorized that Quinn could break out of the nut house. Brooke didn't think Quinn was a threat and hoped there were no more selfies out there. Bill affirmed that there weren't, and Brooke was glad because Ridge had paid the price for the first one. She believed that Ridge's memory would return, even though Ridge was frustrated by the gaps.\n\n\nBill solicited praise from Brooke about his wedding planning skills. He challenged her to do as well in a short time span then he moved on to talk about the honeymoon. Brooke claimed that each day with him was a honeymoon.\n\n\nThe two kissed as Justin ducked his head in. Embarrassed, Justin said he'd just wanted to tell Bill that he was headed to Forrester to go over some legal matters. After Justin had gone, Bill returned to the wedding talk and joked about having a double elopement with their son and daughter. Brooke doubted that would put Bill on Hope's good side.\n\n\nBill started to prefer a wedding over an elopement because it was a chance to rub the marriage in Ridge's face. Brooke said she wanted everyone to get along, and she hoped that Katie and Ridge could move forward as soon as he was healed. \"And then we all can do the victory dance,\" she concluded.\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Ridge had a knowing look on his face as he recalled his incident and the Spencer logo. Katie asked what he'd remembered. \"Spencer,\" Ridge stated. She asked what about Bill, but the frustrated Ridge roared that he didn't know.\n\n\nKatie implored Ridge to be patient. Picking up his pad, he cynically stated that he had his work in the meantime. Katie said the craft would return, and he could stay there until it did. Ridge didn't want to hide out in her bedroom, so she offered to take him back to Forrester.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Katie and Ridge strode into the CEO's office, and Katie urged him to be patient with himself. Ridge began to draw then he had flashbacks of punching Bill and running to the helicopter.\n\n\nThe office door opened. Justin poked his head in and asked if Katie had seen Rick. Justin tensed when Ridge looked at him. \"Hey, you!\" Ridge shouted. Ridge flashed back to seeing the Spencer logo and the pilot before the fall. Justin waited only a moment and hastily left the office.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Wyatt read a message from Quinn to Hope and Liam. Quinn was grateful that Liam hadn't pressed charges, and she expressed that she was determined to conquer her demons no matter how long it took. Wyatt wished he'd gotten his mother help sooner, but Hope and Liam believed that Wyatt would have if Quinn had ever gone that far before.\n\n\nHope and Liam felt that Wyatt had saved the day. Wyatt felt indebted to Liam for not pressing charges. Hope asked if Wyatt would be okay, and Wyatt dismissively affirmed it. He helped Liam prop his foot up on the table, and the three joked about Wyatt helping to nurse Liam to health. Liam replied that Hope was the nurse, and Wyatt was the brother.\n\n\nWyatt seemed skeptical that Liam really felt brotherly toward him. Liam stated that Wyatt had saved his life, something Liam wouldn't soon forget. Wyatt admitted to being surprised to see Liam and Hope on his doorstep. Hope said she'd been surprised that Liam had asked her to take him there.\n\n\nLiam remarked that he'd be rid of his boot in a week. Grabbing the crutches, Wyatt joked about getting a pair to race against Liam with. Hope laughed about their competitiveness, and Wyatt replied that it was what brothers did.\n\n\nLiam said he wanted to change the competitiveness, and Hope pulled a box out of her bag. Wyatt cooed about getting a present, and Liam stated that it would signify a new beginning for them. Wyatt was perplexed when he discovered a bow tie inside the box. Wyatt said he didn't wear that type of thing, but Liam asked if Wyatt would wear one on Liam's wedding day as Liam's best man.\n\n\nWyatt stated that it was one ugly bow tie. Liam hoped that Wyatt would wear it, anyway, for the symbolism. He wanted there to be a new respect between himself and Wyatt, a new beginning. Wyatt refused to wear a cummerbund but then asked if Liam wanted Bill to have the job. Liam said that their father had had plenty of chances, and it was his brother's turn. Wyatt agreed to be the best man.\n\n\nHope and Liam exited, and Wyatt flashed back to Valentine's Day with Hope. He heard a knock at the door. Opening it, he discovered two serious looking men on his doorstep. One carried a security case and asked if Wyatt was Wyatt Fuller.\n\n\nThe men had a package for Wyatt and news about Wyatt's friend, Ricardo, who'd died. Wyatt let the men inside his home and asked what had happened to Ricardo. One of the men set the case on the table, and as he opened it, he said that Ricardo had left something for Wyatt. Wyatt's mouth dropped open when the man displayed the blue diamond.\n\n\nRicardo hadn't had any children, and upon his death, he'd wanted the diamond to go immediately to the man he'd known would love it, guard it, and appreciate it as much as he had. One of the men stated that the diamond that had captured the world was Wyatt's. Wyatt thought that there had been a mistake, but the men said that with great fortune came great responsibility.\n\n\nThe men gave Wyatt a flash drive containing a message from Ricardo and said the transfer would be legalized soon; however, Ricardo had instructed them to carry the diamond immediately to its new guardian upon his death. Wyatt seemed unsure, but the men left him with the jewel.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Hope helped Liam into Rick's office. Liam boasted about how great Hope probably thought he was for his gesture. Hope thought it was a huge gesture to ask Wyatt to be in the wedding. Liam replied that he'd meant it when he'd said he wanted a new beginning for them all.\n\n\nLiam wanted to focus on the positives, and Quinn being out of the picture was the biggest game-changer he could think of. Hope agreed, and they kissed. \n\n\n",
