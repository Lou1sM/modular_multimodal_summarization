Katie reminded Quinn that she had betrayed Eric with his own son. Quinn wanted to call the police.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Quinn that Eric was not missing. He had left on his own. \"We all know why,\" Katie said. Quinn wished that Eric would call and let them know he was okay. Ridge noted that Eric had to check in eventually. They all wondered who would have told Sheila about Ridge and Quinn.\n\n\nBrooke wondered if Katie had said something. Katie replied that she would never have said anything. Ivy said she didn't even know who Sheila was, and she certainly didn't want to. They all agreed no one had told Sheila, but Ivy maintained that somebody had to have seen Ridge and Quinn together. She questioned if it was paparazzi. Brooke said they would have heard something, and the damage had already been done.\n\n\nQuinn hoped that Eric was all right. She called his mobile phone and left another message for him to call home. Quinn said she had also checked to see if Eric had used any credit cards, and he had not. Katie suggested he wanted some time alone, and they had to be patient.\n\n\nKatie reminded everyone that Eric was not in danger. Ivy added that he was smart, but Quinn suggested that he was heartbroken. She had made promises and vows -- and broken then with his own son. She worried that he would never be able to look her in the face. She wanted him to be safe. Quinn said she had also tried to find him by calling some of the hotels, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\n\nIn a hotel, Eric and Sheila ran into one another in the hallway. Sheila maintained that it was a coincidence, but Eric suggested it had been due to stalking on Sheila's part.\n\n\nSheila understood that Eric didn't trust her, but she insisted that he could trust her. Eric said he was exhausted and needed to get some rest. He went into his room, but Sheila stopped him.\n\n\n\"I can see you're upset about your wife and son. I really don't want to leave you alone. Can I come in for a moment?\" Sheila asked. Eric allowed her to enter his room. Sheila said she didn't think the hotel was the type of place he would stay, and Eric answered that he wanted to get lost and not see anyone. Sheila understood, but she added that she cared about him and certainly regretted that she'd had to tell him the truth about Quinn and Ridge.\n\n\nSheila hadn't wanted to hurt Eric with the revelation, but she didn't want to see him going through deception because he was a good man. Sheila asked Eric if he needed anything, and she discovered that he needed his medication because he had left the house so quickly, he had forgotten it. He maintained he would be fine, but Sheila offered to retrieve it for him from the house. Eric agreed to let Sheila get his meds and his electric razor.\n\n\nEric said he didn't want to see anyone, and he gave Sheila his keys. She said that truth and loyalty were important.\n\n\nEric lamented that he'd forgiven Ridge many times, and he worried that he could no longer forgive him. He added that he had bragged about how loyal Quinn had been to him. Eric's phone rang, and he noticed it was Quinn. He refused to speak to her.\n\n\nEric was also angry at Brooke because she had known but not told him. He worried that he could trust no one. \"Trust me,\" Sheila said. Eric worried about Sheila returning to his home, but she promised to be unnoticed and discreet. She reminded Eric that he was not alone. She said she would always be available to help him. She left.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Steffy, Liam, Wyatt, and Bill discussed the Forrester and Spectra situations, specifically Thomas and Sally. Bill said that Sally Spectra couldn't hold a candle to his niece, Caroline, who had recently returned from New York. Steffy said that it was good for Thomas to be with his son. Bill noted that he wanted to obliterate Spectra to make room for his building.\n\n\nDiscussion turned to the swimwear fashion show in Monte Carlo, but Bill was not thrilled about it. Steffy and Liam noted that it would renew an old rivalry. Steffy was confident that Forrester would emerge as the star in the end.\n\n\nSteffy wanted Bill to stay out of her business and rivalries. She noted that Forrester would put Spectra out of business or \"out of their misery.\"\n\n\nLiam added that the concept of a swimwear rivalry was a great idea, and all the proceeds went to a good cause. Bill was obsessed with wanting to close Spectra so he could construct his building. Bill added that he didn't like Sally Spectra because she was keeping him from his pet project.\n\n\nSteffy said Bill had better not try to pull something with a bad review. She wanted to get the job done on her own. Bill was unconvinced that Forrester could handle it. He made fun of Ridge, but Steffy told him to stop. Bill wanted to protect his investment. Steffy was confident she could handle it.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge and Brooke discussed that they were concerned about Eric. Brooke checked her phone and noted that Eric had not responded to her text messages. He always responded, she said. Ridge worried that he wouldn't get to apologize to Eric. Brooke noted that Eric was furious, hurt, and disappointed because they had all betrayed him.\n\n\nIn his hotel room, Eric drank a beer and looked at his wedding ring. He flashed back to his wedding with Quinn. He threw his suitcase across the room and angrily paced the room.\n\n\nAt the Forrester house, Sheila quietly opened the front door with Eric's key. She went up the stairs to get his medication and razor. Later, Quinn walked through the living room and overheard keys jingling. She ran to the door, thinking it was Eric, but she saw Sheila leaving the house and asked what Sheila was doing there.\n\n\nSheila answered that she had to retrieve some of Eric's things for him. He needed his medication. Quinn wanted to know where Eric was, but Sheila said Eric didn't want his family to know. Quinn grabbed Sheila's arm, but Sheila warned Quinn to not to touch her.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn tells Brooke and Ivy that Eric did not spend the night at home last night and even some clothes are gone. She has no idea where he is. They both tell her they think he just wants to be away for a while and think. Meanwhile Eric tells Sheila it seems more than a coincidence that she shows up in the same motel and on the same floor. Some people would call that stalking. Bill listens to his sons and Steffy and says he has no problem with Katie being at the Summit but he draws the line with Spectra. He does not want them near there. Steffy disagrees and says it is time to put them out of their misery. Liam even throws it in that it will be great publicity and for a good cause. Bill chides him for his good causes. Quinn tells them she understands Eric wanting to be away but the least he could do is call and let them know he is all right. Sheila says she would not have been above stalking Eric in the past but that is not who is she now. He wants to be alone and rest and starts to go in his room. She politely asks if she can come in for a minute. His brains must be lost as he allows her to. She says this is a great place to get lost. She cares about him and cannot imagine what he is going through being betrayed by his own wife and son. She does not want to cause him any more pain. She laments that he is such a kind, loving, trusting man but he deserves to know the truth so she had to tell him. Katie says it does not matter who told Eric, the damage has been done. Bill says he is a pretty good judge of character and he does not like Sally. How did he know that nitwit Jarrett would write his own great review and give her hope. Quinn calls Eric again and leaves a voice mail to please call and let his whole family knows he is okay. She tells Ridge that she broke his heart. She broke her vows and he may not look at her again but she just needs to know he is okay. Sheila asks Eric if he has his medications. He says no, he left too soon and he does not want to go back home and get them. He bragged about Quinn and then he defended her and now this. He rails that even Brooke knew. She should have told him. So there is no one he can trust now. Sheila says yes; he can trust her. He needs his meds and she will go to the house and get them. She will be very discreet and try not to see anyone. He finally agrees. She bends down to where he is sitting and tells him that he is not alone. Bill says he trusts Steffy but not her father, the dressmaker. He is a wild card. He is hoping he can count on Spectra being a huge belly flop and he can topple that building for his own beautiful skyscraper. Brooke tells Ridge that Sheila is Eric's ex- wife and now she blows into town and he is relying on her. Ridge says all for a few kisses he may lose his dad. Eric remembers his wedding vows to Quinn. He starts drinking and kicking his suitcase of clothes around. Sheila sneaks in the Forrester manse and makes her way upstairs. She is caught when she comes down. She tells Quinn that she came for Eric's medicine and he does not want to see anyone. Quinn grabs her by the arm to restrain her from leaving. Sheila gives her that cold stare and tells her to never touch her again.",
