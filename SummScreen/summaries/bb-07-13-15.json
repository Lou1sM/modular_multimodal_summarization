Nicole said not to encourage her parents, whom she'd never return to even if Rick and Maya kicked her out. Rick claimed that they'd never do it because the place was Nicole's home.\n\n\nNicole believed her parents felt that everyone was against them. Rick said he was too familiar with the feeling to criticize, but Nicole stated that he'd gotten past it. She hoped her parents were on the next flight out so that Maya didn't have to hear the awful thing they'd said about her.\n\n\nRick asked if Maya knew that their father was in town. Nicole didn't know the point of telling Maya, and Rick replied that Maya and Nicole's relationship of caring and trust was the reason.\n\n\nZende arrived with papers for Rick. Nicole and Rick joked about her parents dragging her from Forrester, and Zende asked if she was going away. She explained that her parents were there to take her away from Maya, who they felt was a bad influence on Nicole. Nicole claimed she was the bad influence who'd lied to and bullied Maya, but Maya's only influence had been to make Nicole a better person.\n\n\nZende was sure Nicole would go back with her parents. Noting a strange look on Zende's his face, she asked if he'd ever disobeyed or stood up to his parents before. Zende said he hadn't. He claimed not to be saying he'd been perfect, but Tony and Kristen had saved his life, which had made it easier for Zende to obey. Nicole asked if Zende thought she should go with her parents. \"Maybe. But I hope you don't,\" he replied.\n\n\nZende and Nicole figured they should get out of Rick's hair. Rick pointed to some stacks of papers and said he'd asked Pam to make him twenty copies of two reports, but she'd claimed not to know that the copier could collate and staple. Rick needed the stacks sorted out for his upcoming meeting. He gave the interns the task and exited.\n\n\nLater, Zende found some paperclips because the stapler wasn't doing the job. Nicole mixed up the pages between the two reports. She quipped that no one would read Rick's report all the way through, and Rick had just given them busy work. Zende agreed, but he said Rick was trusting them. Nicole stated that it her complaint had been a test, and Zende had passed.\n\n\nNicole said Zende was awesome, but he replied that he was bad to the bone. She didn't recognize the phrase, and he couldn't believe she'd never heard the song. Tony had always played the song to cheer up the homesick Zende. Nicole claimed she'd gotten homesick -- for the home she hadn't had. Zende told her that she was strong to make her own choices and live on her own.\n\n\nNicole stated that she had Maya, but Zende replied that Nicole was strong to be loyal to Maya. She said most people just thought she was annoying. \"Strong,\" Zende asserted, and she smiled.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Maya was shocked by Julius' warm greeting. She called for Nicole, but Vivienne said Nicole, who was going through a rebellious period, wasn't there. Maya stated that her parents had known Nicole didn't want to leave, but they could rest easy because Maya would take care of Nicole.\n\n\nJulius replied that Maya would never understand, but when a man and woman had a child, there was no such thing as resting easy. A parent would always wonder if their child was safe or if they'd done anything wrong. He said they remembered every harsh word. \"Do you, Dad?\" Maya asked. She stated that she sure remembered, and he asked if she was trying to shame him.\n\n\nJulius asked if that was any way to welcome Maya's father for a visit, but Maya replied that he was there not for a visit but to save Nicole from heinous Maya. Julius called Maya as self-centered as always. He wondered if Maya had ever thought of how hard it would be to ask a man to give up his only son. He wondered what about his dreams and who'd carry on his family name.\n\n\nJulius said Maya wanted him to accept her, but she didn't accept him. Maya claimed to know he didn't want her in his life, and he asked why she thought he was there, subjecting himself to \"this.\"\n\n\nJulius wanted to know about Rick. Vivienne said she'd met Rick briefly. Maya explained that Rick had surprised her with the portrait when they'd moved in. Julius noted that Maya looked different, and she replied that he did, too. He remarked that it was just the years, but with her, it was more.\n\n\nJulius asked if Maya was what she wanted to be. Maya believed that she still had a way to go but was happier than she had been when he'd last seen her. Julius asked how prison had been, and Maya asked him if he was the person he wanted to be. He admitted to having regrets. She asked if he could say her name, and he asked if she meant her real name.\n\n\nMaya claimed to only have one legal name. Julius said he'd heard the name a lot, and the librarian in town had set aside articles for him to see and would say, \"'Look how beautiful he is!'\" Maya didn't think the woman had meant any harm and had always been helpful in getting Maya information. He added that he'd also heard her name at church and at the agency where he'd once worked.\n\n\nMaya asked if he still worked at the limousine agency. Vivienne relayed that he hadn't for some time, and he'd been fired for covering his nametag. Julius said that he'd been a joke there, and people like that didn't have friends. He supposed that he'd put it on himself for telling people that Myron was dead. Maya asked if that was what Julius had wished.\n\n\nJulius asked what kind of father would wish his daughter dead. He emphasized that he'd said \"daughter.\" He said that he and her mother had formed their child, but looking at Maya, there was no other word to call her but daughter. He felt that they were all being tested, but one of them had failed. He thought maybe it had been he, but he could certainly say Maya's name.\n\n\nVivienne told Maya that she'd struggled. Vivienne hadn't known if it would be weakness to love Maya as she'd been and to let Maya be, or if it would be weak to try to pull Maya back from the life she'd eventually begun living. Vivienne had seen social media rally behind Maya against the articles about her. Julius said he'd never seen those, but the librarian had told him of Maya's success.\n\n\nMaya asked if Julius was there because he admired success. Julius stated that hard work should be rewarded. She asked if her happiness mattered. He asked if that wasn't the reason she'd left. Maya claimed that she'd left to stop hurting, and it was only so long someone could take derogatory words before she believed them or left to find a better life.\n\n\nMaya had missed her parents. She'd wished she'd had someone stronger and wiser to look up to, but she believed she'd turned out okay. She said they could catch their flight if all they'd wanted was to look at her. \"But if you want more -- \" she started to say.\n\n\nJulius asked what it would take if they wanted a second chance at a family. Maya said she needed them to accept her for who she was; they might not be able to, but she couldn't have them in her life without it.\n\n\nJulius reckoned that Maya didn't want much -- just for him to give up his beliefs. Maya replied that she wanted a lot and always had. She figured it had been painful and confusing to be her father. Julius stated that she'd never acknowledged anything like that before.\n\n\nMaya added that it had been hard on Vivienne, who'd wanted to keep Maya safe. Vivienne had walked her home from school to keep her from getting beaten up and would hide upsetting things from Julius, but \"you couldn't save me from myself.\" Maya said none of them had known how to handle it, but they'd made it through. She didn't want to live in the past or assign blame.\n\n\nMaya stated that she could still tell them she loved her parents, and she knew that they loved her, too. If not, there wouldn't have been so much anger. She wasn't expecting them to change, read books about people like her, march in parades, or agree with her choices. She just asked that they respect her right to make them and to be happy.\n\n\nMaya's parents started to leave, but Julius said Maya was young and thought people could just change, just take their lives in for repair as she'd done. Maya replied that it wasn't exactly like that. Julius asked her to stand up and look into his eyes. The tearful Maya complied.\n\n\nWith a tearful voice, Julius said he'd try. He was set in his ways, but the one thing he'd never stop being was her father. He said he'd try to get to know the woman she'd become and the life she'd created for herself, and he'd try to find a way to fit in. \"This, I can promise you,\" Julius vowed with tears on his cheeks. Maya exclaimed, \"Daddy!\" The two hugged.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Julius calls Maya his little girl and says she has a very comfortable home. He says something Nicole said against them and he wanted to straighten this out. The child is always in your mind's eye, whether they are safe or not. He remembers every harsh word. She says she does too. Julius hopes she is not trying to call him out or shame him. Who is going to carry on his name now? She says she has never been able to read his mind so maybe he needs to tell her why he is here. Nicole tells Rick that her parents may have nightmares but no more dreams. They do not have the kind of money to traipse all over the country looking for her or Maya. He wonders if Maya even knows that her dad is in town. Rick praises Zende and says he needs a promotion as he is the only person who knocks on his door. Nicole tells Zende that her mom and dad are in town and would like her to return home but she is going nowhere. The only influence Maya has on her is making her a better person. Zende tells her that his birth parents are dead and most don't get second chances. So he would never think of disappointing them. She feels he believes that she should go home. Julius wants to hear about this Rick who has given them a home. Maya says she has a way to go but yes she is happy and with Rick. Julius explains to her that he hears her name at church ad even the library where some have shown him magazines with Maya's pictures. Some have made fun of him and he told them his son was dead. He does not know why the Lord did this but he feels he is being tested. But he does not wish her dead. Maya tells her mother she does not have to chose her words so carefully, she can speak freely. Julius says hard work is to be respected but it doesn't always come. Maya says in the past she could only be told so many times that she was a freak before you start looking for another life. She is okay now how she turned out, but if they want something more she can not have them in her life without their acceptance. Julius says she doesn't want much \u0096 just trade his beliefs for hers. She says she knows she did not grow up gracefully and she does not want to dwell now on right and wrong. She loves them and she knows they love her too. She does not want them to march in a transgender parade or anything like that but she would ask them to let her lead her life the way she is now. He tells her she is young yet and thinks people can change. They will go. Maya sits down in defeat. He makes her stand up and looks her in the eyes and says he will try. He will try to get to know the woman she has become and he will always be her father. He will try to find a way to fit in. He can promise her that and he asks for some sugar for this old man. She hugs him.",
