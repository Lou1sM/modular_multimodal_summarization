    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Patrice discussed Steffy talking Bill down about the summit. Steffy had thought Bill would kill the fashion challenge. Patrice decided to handle Bill with care. Steffy asked what else was on Patrice's mind. Patrice admitted that she couldn't believe Thomas had put Steffy on the spot with the duel. Steffy said it was bound to happen because Sally had gotten her claws in him.\n\n\nCaroline entered. Steffy reintroduced her to Patrice. Caroline recalled working with Patrice in the past. Remarking that Pam had Douglas, Caroline hoped she wasn't interrupting. Steffy replied that it was perfect timing because they were just talking about Thomas.\n\n\nPatrice left, and Caroline and Steffy discussed how hard it was to believe that Thomas was at Spectra, not Forrester. Steffy hoped the showdown in Monte Carlo would end both Spectra and Thomas' infatuation with Sally. \"And if it does...\" Steffy said. Caroline finished the statement, saying, \"Maybe I'll be here to pick up the pieces.\" Steffy said it was only if Caroline hadn't changed her mind about putting her son's family together.\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Caroline were playing with Douglas. Steffy clarified that she hadn't meant to try to dictate Caroline's life. Steffy just thought Caroline needed to make a move if she wanted a family with Thomas and Douglas. Caroline asked what kind of move. Steffy suggested going to Thomas and telling him all the reasons Caroline wanted it and why it was important. Steffy said Caroline should do it before Sally sucked him in more.\n\n\nAt the loft, Thomas and Sally trotted down the stairs from the roof, where Thomas had suggested they work in swimwear to get inspiration. After joking around and kissing, they started working in the living room. Thomas noticed that she couldn't keep her eyes off of him, and they started making out on the sofa.\n\n\nThomas and Sally continued working, and they heard a chime. Thomas checked his messages, and Sally asked if it was his baby's mother. Thomas said his broker had a stock tip. He asked why she'd think it was Caroline. Sally noted that she'd talked to Caroline, and Thomas had spent time with Caroline. \"With our son,\" Thomas said and asked if it was a problem.\n\n\nSally didn't have a problem and said Thomas was a devoted dad. She just didn't like him having a child with a rich woman with whom he had a lot of history. Thomas asked if Sally realized that he'd fallen for her because she was unique and different, and the two kissed.\n\n\nLater, Sally and Thomas were commenting on a design when Caroline and Douglas arrived. Caroline had called Spectra and learned that Thomas was working from home. She said Douglas couldn't get enough of his father. Thomas replied that he couldn't get enough of his son, and as he led Douglas inside, Caroline followed and said, \"You must be Sally.\"\n\n\nCaroline introduced herself, and Sally said it was nice to meet Caroline. Thomas introduced the child to Sally, and Caroline remarked that people had been fawning on Douglas at Forrester. Sally assumed Caroline and Steffy were super tight. \"I mean, why not? You're both royalty,\" Sally added. Sally decided that Thomas should spend time with his son while she left to deliver a message.\n\n\nAfter Sally had gone, Caroline watched Thomas and Douglas play. She said that Douglas had missed his father, and she had, too.\n\n\nLater, Steffy asked Sally how she'd gotten by Forrester security. Sally claimed that it had been her charm. \"Yeah, right,\" Steffy quipped. Sally asked if Steffy was pleased with herself for sending Caroline and Douglas to Thomas' place. Steffy denied doing it but was glad to hear that they were there. Steffy believed Thomas needed to spend time with his son.\n\n\nSally stated that Caroline's return had Steffy's fingers all over it, and she accused Steffy of trying to match-make. Steffy replied that her brother should be with his son. Sally accused Steffy of shoving his baby's mother at him, too. Steffy assumed Sally feared competition.\n\n\nSally took it as an admission, but Steffy said there was nothing to admit. Steffy stood for family, and that included the family business, too. Sally said that Thomas was happier at Spectra than he'd ever been at Forrester. Steffy believed that Sally had gotten in Thomas' head and separated him from everything he cared about and everyone who loved him.\n\n\nSally stated that she loved Thomas, too. Steffy asserted that Sally loved \"that money.\"  Steffy noted that Sally had gotten very lucky to avoid jail and keep her business, but Steffy warned that the luck was about to run out. Steffy refused to let Sally mooch off Thomas anymore and vowed to get Sally out of his life once and for all.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn noted Sheila's effrontery to threaten Quinn in her own home and demanded to know why Sheila was there. Sheila said she was getting Eric's medications, as she'd already said. Quinn grabbed Sheila's purse and reached down into it. Sheila snatched it back, and Quinn asked, \"Is that a gun in there?\"\n\n\n\"God, no!\" Sheila exclaimed and ordered Quinn to get out of her way. Quinn said she would once Sheila said where Eric was. Sheila replied that Eric didn't want Quinn to know. Sheila stated that Eric didn't want anything to do with Quinn, and he was done with the family.\n\n\nQuinn said that the least Sheila could do was to tell Quinn where her husband was, but Sheila thought the least Quinn could do was respect that Eric didn't want to see Quinn's face or hear Quinn's voice. Sheila said he was washing his hands of Quinn. Quinn asked if she was supposed to take Sheila's word for it.\n\n\nSheila claimed to actually care about Eric. Quinn didn't want to hear it from Sheila after all Sheila had done in the past. When Quinn owned up to making mistakes, Sheila was disgusted that Quinn was calling an affair with Eric's son a mistake. Quinn asserted that she hadn't had an affair, but Sheila yelled that it was a betrayal that Eric wouldn't forgive Quinn or Ridge for.\n\n\nQuinn stated that she hadn't claimed to be the perfect wife. She said Stephanie hadn't been, and \"I know you weren't.\" Quinn believed that with patience, she and Eric had built a solid marriage, and she refused to leave the house or lose Eric. Sheila said Eric would decide whether to stay with a woman who'd made a fool of him with his son. Quinn said Sheila was making it worse than it was, and it had been just a couple of kisses.\n\n\n\"With his son!\" Sheila exclaimed. Quinn was indignant about Sheila pointing fingers after the damage Sheila had done in the past. Sheila replied that she'd paid for it and had done her time. She claimed that she'd changed. Quinn didn't believe it, and Sheila retorted that she didn't believe it about Quinn, either.  Quinn countered that Sheila didn't know anything about Quinn.\n\n\nSheila responded that she knew that the good thing Quinn had had with Eric hadn't been enough, so Quinn had turned to his son behind his back. Quinn said her actions with Ridge had been careless and stupid, but they'd had nothing to do with Quinn's love for Eric. Sheila asked if she was supposed to believe Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn screamed that she didn't care what Sheila believed because it had nothing to do with her. Calling Quinn delusional, Sheila said that she'd been married to Eric, and he was important to her. She refused to let anyone hurt him. Quinn accused Sheila of threatening her. Sheila replied that Quinn would see it that way. Quinn asked how else to see it due to Sheila sick history.\n\n\nSheila noted that Quinn also had skeletons in her closet. Sheila said she'd been happy for Eric until she'd talked to people close to him. It had seemed as if no one had approved of Quinn. \"I defended you, and you did this with his son!\" Sheila yelled. Quinn asked Sheila to tell her where Eric was, but Sheila said that, unlike Quinn, Sheila would honor Eric's wishes.\n\n\nAt the door, Sheila warned Quinn not to follow. Sheila said Eric would run, and Quinn would never see him again. \"Plus, I'll know, and you'll be sorry,\" Sheila concluded and exited.\n\n\nIn the design office, Brooke couldn't believe that Eric wouldn't respond to her. Ridge said Eric was upset with her, too, for keeping the secret. \"Don't put this back on me,\" Brooke responded. Ridge said that he should probably be relieved that the secret was finally out in the open; however, he didn't believe for a moment that Sheila had done it for Eric.\n\n\nIn Ridge's view, Sheila was about Sheila -- always. He just hoped that Sheila had the good sense to stay away from them. Brooke had thought it had been coincidence to run into Sheila at Il Giardino the other day, but Brooke had begun to question it. Ridge said that nothing the calculated and dangerous Sheila did was by coincidence.\n\n\nRidge received a message. He told Brooke that it was from Quinn, who wanted to see him right away about Eric and Sheila. Brooke looked worried as Ridge exited.\n\n\nWhen Ridge arrived at the mansion, the upset Quinn explained that Sheila had been there to get Eric's medications. Eric had given Sheila a key, so she obviously knew where he was. Quinn said Sheila had claimed to be respecting Eric's wishes and had refused to tell Quinn where he was. Quinn believed that she'd felt a gun in Sheila's purse. She didn't know what was in Sheila's mind, and it worried Quinn that Eric was at Sheila's mercy.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Sheila arrived. Eric was asleep on the bed. She knelt by him and kissed his forehead.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn tells Sheila that she does not intimidate her so do not threaten her and now get out of her house. She tries to grab Sheila's purse to get Eric's meds but Sheila grabs it back away from her. She says Eric needs those meds yet does not want to see Quinn, so do not threaten her again. Caroline interrupts a little meeting between Steffy and another gal. Steffy says she is not interrupting at all; they were just talking about Thomas and the swimwear fashion show challenge. Sally and Thomas get lovey dovey at the office when they should be working. She says she cannot keep her peepers off of him with his pecs showing. Ridge grouses to his Logan that this is not the way he wanted it to happen but he is glad it is out about him and Quinn. Sheila and Quinn start arguing over Quinn's betrayal and that Eric is washing his hands of her and never wants to see her again. Yet he is seeing Sheila as she actually cares for him. Steffy tells Caroline that she does not want to meddle but she knows how important it is to Caroline that Thomas remain in her life. She thinks it is important that Caroline tell Thomas exactly what Caroline has told her and perhaps get her out of the clutches of Sally. Brooke tells Ridge that she ran into Sheila the other day but she said it was by accident. Ridge says she is too calculating so nothing is by accident with her. Quinn says she is not going to take Sheila's word. She has left too many bodies in her wake. Sheila reaffirms again that she has changed, she had paid her time. She does not think Quinn has. And fine but at the end of the day it is still Eric that will chose if he wants Quinn back in his life. They end up screaming at each other. Sheila says she was married to Eric too and he is still so important that if anyone tried to hurt him like Quinn did ..well she would never let that happen. She is not the only one with a past. When she first came back to town and saw Eric with Quinn she was happy that he was happy. But then she kept hearing things about Quinn and Ridge and she will never let up on Quinn. She starts to leave and tells Quinn do not even think about following her or Eric may run and she will never see him again. And Quinn will be sorry if she tries to do anymore. Caroline stops by to see Thomas and brings her trump card, Douglas. She introduces herself to Sally. Sally is cordial but says she has some things to do so she will leave Thomas to visit Douglas. Quinn reveals to Ridge that Sheila just paid her a visit. She had a key from Eric so she knows where he is but won't tell. She does not know what is in her mind but clearly Eric is at his mercy. Sheila finds Eric sleeping or at least passed out on the bed. She kisses him all with a sly look on her face. Sally drops in on Steffy who wonders how she got by security. Sally says she charmed them. She knows Steffy must feel very satisfied by sending Thomas's baby mama over to see him. They spar back and forth with both saying they love Thomas. Steffy makes no bones, she will always believe in family. She laments that Sally is lucky she is not in jail so do not interfere with Thomas and his son and if that includes Caroline, so be it. She declares that she will see that Sally is out of his life one way or the other.",
