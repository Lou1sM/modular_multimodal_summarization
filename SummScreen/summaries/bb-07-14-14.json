Hope was sad that Wyatt had lost so much due to Quinn. Liam noted that Wyatt had lost Hope, and Hope replied that Liam had been kind not to rub it in Wyatt's face. Liam remarked that the three of them would be family soon, and they should begin to act like it.\n\n\nLiam and Hope crossed the hall to the CEO's office, where Eric, Rick, Ivy, Aly, Oliver, Maya, and Carter had gathered. Ivy had just asked if Eric was going to offer her an internship, but he replied that it was nothing like that. Rick explained that they wanted to groom Ivy to replace Quinn Artisan Jewelers, and it was their hope that Ivy's jewelry would be in Forrester boutiques worldwide.\n\n\nIvy seemed overwhelmed by the unexpected offer. She didn't know if she could just shut down her Sydney operation to work in Los Angeles. Eric offered her use of the jet for whenever she needed it, but she said that she'd need someone to assist her locally.\n\n\nLater, Hope and Liam returned to Rick's office and discussed Ivy's predicament of needing a local assistant. Liam guessed that Hope wanted to rehire Wyatt, and she cautiously replied that she was thinking about it. She was sad that Wyatt was paying the price for Quinn, but he'd done nothing wrong. Liam agreed with Hope and felt it had been unfair that Wyatt had grown up with a psycho mother.\n\n\nHope asked if Liam was okay with Wyatt being at Forrester. Though Liam still felt a little leery about trusting Wyatt, Wyatt had saved Liam's life, and the brotherly part of Liam was willing to give it a chance. Hope exclaimed in joy and hugged and kissed Liam.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Rick asked Carter to stay after the meeting to discuss something. Rick wanted to \"come clean\" with Carter, just as Rick had done with Caroline. Carter smiled as he expectantly awaited Rick's news, but his grin faded when Rick revealed that Maya had made a pass at him in the steam room.\n\n\nCarter asked if it was a joke, and Rick replied that he wouldn't make it up. Carter gasped. Rick said he hadn't felt right about it, and he didn't want Carter to be in the dark. Just then, Maya entered, and Rick asked if Carter would be okay. Carter said he would, and Rick wordlessly left.\n\n\nMaya asked why Carter wouldn't be okay, and he said it depended upon her. \"Did you come onto Rick in the steam room?\" Carter pointedly asked.\n\n\nIn the studio, Oliver sat Aly down to tell that when they'd first met, he'd underestimated her. Through time, he'd learned how beautiful and strong she was. Aly said he'd helped her to change, he'd supported her through difficult times, and he'd accepted her the way she was.\n\n\nOliver said that Aly was pretty much perfect to him, and Aly remarked that he'd never judged her for talking to her mother or having a room full of HFTF memorabilia. She stated that nothing he could say would change how she felt about him. Oliver wasn't so sure, and she prompted him to try her.\n\n\nOliver hoped he wouldn't regret it, but he indicated that he had to tell Aly something. He explained that they'd begun seeing each other around the time that he'd been freaked out about losing his job, and Maya had accused him of using Aly to keep it. Aly was shocked that Maya had done that and felt that it was wrong and inappropriate.\n\n\nOliver said Maya had overheard him saying that Aly should be the face of HFTF, and Maya had recorded him without his knowledge. He relayed that he'd said some things, and he'd need Aly's understanding and forgiveness. He believed that he'd screwed up, but the recording didn't change how he felt about Aly. Aly asked if it was really that bad, and she wondered what he'd said on the recording.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt watched Ricardo's video. Ricardo said that he and Wyatt had shared a kinship with the stone, and the mother of all diamonds had become Wyatt's.\n\n\nWyatt heard a knock at the door. Deacon was there to get an update about Quinn and to see how Wyatt was doing. Wyatt said that Quinn claimed to be getting the help that she needed, and he'd gotten a little help of his own. \"That's mine,\" Wyatt said, opening the diamond case.\n\n\nNot sure that it was real, Deacon casually picked the diamond up. Wyatt warned Deacon to handle it with respect. \"Is this from the diamond heist?\" Deacon excitedly asked. Wyatt promised that it wasn't stolen. He said that a former friend and business associate had passed away suddenly, and having no family, he'd left Wyatt the HFTF diamond.\n\n\nWyatt called it a flawless force of nature and claimed that it had magical powers. Deacon chuckled. Wyatt insisted that it was so, and it had made him and Hope closer. Wyatt mumbled that he'd told Hope that he'd give it to her one day, but he and Liam had become closer since the sword incident.\n\n\nDeacon didn't understand why Hope was with Liam if Wyatt and she had indeed been in love the way Wyatt claimed. Wyatt revealed that there had been a pregnancy scare, and he sometimes wished that Hope had been pregnant. It would have led to a marriage.\n\n\nWyatt relayed that the thought of children had frightened Hope, and Liam had demanded equal time with her. Wyatt felt that what he'd had with Hope could have gone up against Liam any day, but Quinn's actions had broken them. Deacon said he could have sworn he'd heard Wyatt say he'd accepted Hope and Liam. Wyatt replied that he wasn't sure he'd ever be able to give up on a future with Hope.\n\n\nWyatt didn't think it was a coincidence that the diamond was back, and he remarked that it had made him and Hope close before. Wyatt received a call from Hope, and he grinned knowingly at Deacon when she asked him to meet her at Forrester right away. After the call, Deacon stated that the diamond seemed to be working its magic already. Wyatt picked up the diamond and grinned.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt grinned as he entered Rick's office but looked confused when he saw Liam there with Hope. Hope announced that she and Liam had an offer for him. Wyatt asked if they needed janitorial services. Laughing, Hope said that she and Liam agreed that Wyatt had been through hell.\n\n\nHope conveyed that Forrester had found a new jewelry designer who was based in Australia and would need local help if she were to work on HFTF in Los Angeles. Wyatt asked if Forrester was considering him for the job, and Hope replied that she and Liam couldn't think of anyone better.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Liam was really okay with it, and Liam said he trusted Wyatt. \"You realize what you just said, right?\" Wyatt asked. He offered to let Liam take it back, but Liam didn't want to. Wyatt felt that it was huge, and they had to be brothers at that point. Liam agreed that they were and said it was time they acted like it.\n\n\nWyatt felt that the job was fantastic, and he was happy to take it. He was bewildered by Hope and Liam's acceptance of him and willingness to give him a chance despite his mother. It meant a lot to him. Liam jokingly said not to screw it up, and he hugged Wyatt. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Wyatt is in complete and utter shock at the generous gift that was willed to him by an old friend. Deacon is impressed by Wyatt\u2019s determination when he learns how Hope\u2019s ex-beau plans to use his newly acquired gift to his advantage. Ivy is introduced to the Forrester Creations staff and is offered the position vacated by a disgraced former employee. Knowing that Maya could break her silence at any moment, Oliver attempts to diffuse the situation with Aly.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt has a visitor: Deacon. Wyatt shows him the diamond and that it is now his. It is not stolen; the diamond was left to him by the owner who passed away recently. He just inherited the Hope For the Future Diamond. Wyatt tells him that believe it or not, but it has magical powers of good luck and he's not sure he can ever give up on Hope even though for now she has chosen Liam. He was willing to accept that challenge but Quinn's going from meddling and annoying to out and out crazy turned the tide. Ivy is more or less expecting them to offer her an internship at FC so she is blown away that Eric and Rick say there is a big void in the HFTF line with patrons wanting jewelry to accompany the dresses. Hope says they'd like her to fill that void. She's certainly stunned and would like to accept but says she has too many hands in the fire in Sydney. Eric tells her she could do both, jet at her disposal. She says even then she would need some help with contacts. Hope tells Liam that Ivy made a good point. Liam says it before she does. She would like Wyatt to come back to work at FC. He's okay with that. He still has a small fraction of not wanting to trust him but a greater one that says yes. Hope calls Wyatt and asks him to come to Forrester. Deacon tells him that diamond may already be working. Rick calls Carter in and says he does not want to be in the middle of this, but he also doesn't want any strain between them. He told Caroline so now he wants to tell Carter too. He was in the steam room the other day and Maya came in .and hit on him. Carter is incensed but Rick says he is not making this up. Maya happens to walk in and he confronts her if she came on to Rick in the steam room. Oliver and Aly have a heart to heart and she is glad that she is able to share everything with him. She wants him to do the same. He says he does have something to tell her. Maya called him out after Ridge threatened to fire him. It's more than insecurity. He talked to Maya round the time that he started dating Aly and Maya recorded it. It's bad. He screwed up and no matter how it sounds, it does not change how he feels about her. And he will need her forgiveness. Wyatt goes to FC and with Liam at her side, Hope tells him they have an offer for him. They are looking for another jewelry partner and they think they have found her. She's a Forrester but settled in Australia so it will take some doings for her to say yes but they'd like Wyatt to help ease her into it. Wyatt is blown away and says yes he will take it. He can not believe their acceptance to separate him and his mother. Liam hugs him.",
