    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the loft, Caroline and Thomas each said they missed \"this\" and that it was good for Douglas to see them that way. Thomas felt that Douglas needed to know that, even though they weren't together, they were a family. She added that they always would be.\n\n\nThomas put Douglas down for a nap with ease, something that Caroline could never manage to do. She said that settled it, and they were moving back. Thomas said he'd love for them to move back. She asked if he meant back to the city or something more. He mindfully said her name.\n\n\nCaroline understood that he had Sally and a new life at Spectra. Caroline stated that it was fun and exciting, but it hadn't been that far back when he'd been excited about her and starting a family with her. Caroline recalled how much Thomas had wanted it and how much he'd cared about her. Thomas replied that he still cared.\n\n\nCaroline felt that it wasn't too late, and they could give Douglas the family he needed. She asked if Thomas was tired of only seeing Douglas on a screen. Thomas said he flew out when he could. Caroline pointed out that he had been doing that, but he'd become very busy at Spectra.\n\n\nCaroline realized that it was her fault for moving, but she needed Thomas to understand that she'd needed time with her moms. Thomas said he understood it, and he hadn't tried to make her feel guilty about it, though he'd thought they'd been headed somewhere.\n\n\nFrom Caroline's perspective, they still were headed somewhere. Thomas recalled that she hadn't been that confident about them in New York. She said that they'd just started parenting together. She'd cared about him, but it had been confusing. She hadn't wanted to be together just for the child; however, she'd missed him when he'd stopped visiting, and it hadn't been just because she'd missed having a father for Douglas.\n\n\nCaroline had missed Thomas, spending time with him and watching him laugh or read a magazine. She said she'd started hearing rumors that he'd been moving on. Thomas replied that they'd agreed not to wait if something happened along. Caroline knew that, but she said it had still hurt. It had hurt in a \"go fight for Thomas. He belongs with you and your son kind of way.\"\n\n\nSally approached the front door, which was slightly ajar. As Thomas stroked Caroline's cheek, he said she had always been a fighter. Caroline replied that she also always won. Sally cleared her throat and offered to return at another time.\n\n\nLater, Sally asked if she was scaring Caroline away. Thomas replied that Caroline didn't scare easily. Caroline walked over with Douglas, saying it was time to leave. Sally asked them to stay and offered to play games. She claimed they could make a night of it. Sally had heard Caroline say something about winning, and Sally said she'd loved to see Caroline try to beat her at rummy. Caroline said she didn't spend time playing games, \"being a mom and all. Responsibilities.\"\n\n\nCaroline asked Douglas to bid his father farewell. Douglas said that he loved his daddy. Sally asked if Caroline's flight was booked. Sally was sure Caroline was itching to get back and said that, as an East Coast girl, Caroline probably hated how fake everyone was out there. Caroline was in no rush to take her son from his dad anytime soon. She guessed Sally would be seeing a lot more of her.\n\n\nAfter Caroline and Douglas had gone, Thomas talked about how good it had been to see his son and have Sally meet Douglas. Sally thought highly of Douglas, who had a handsome father and gorgeous mother. Thomas asked if Sally was saying that Caroline was gorgeous. Sally replied that it was \"in a privileged girl who had it all\" sort of way.\n\n\nThomas guessed that it had been hard on Sally. Sally joked that she'd had better days -- like when she'd tripped on the pier or had gotten arrested. Sally stated that Caroline hadn't been terrible. Thomas asked her to give Caroline a chance because she'd be seeing a lot more of Caroline, the mother of his child.\n\n\nSally didn't think that being the mother of Thomas' child was the only thing Caroline was after. Thomas said that Caroline didn't always get what she wanted. He wanted Sally to get used to Caroline because Sally was stuck with Thomas. The two kissed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam was more interested in canoodling than listening as Steffy filled him in on the nerve of Sally to accuse Steffy of shepherding Caroline to town to break up Thomas and Sally. Steffy's phone rang. It was Quinn, and Liam asked Steffy to let it go to voicemail.\n\n\nBelieving it could be important, Steffy answered the call. Quinn asked if Steffy had heard from Eric. Steffy hadn't but asked why Quinn was asking. Quinn figured Ridge hadn't told Steffy. Quinn revealed that Eric had left with Sheila Carter.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy rushed to the mansion to find out what was happening with Eric. Quinn explained that Sheila had been there, all too happy to witness Eric and Quinn having a fight. Quinn had left for a while, but upon her return, she'd seen that Eric had gone. Eric had stayed out overnight, and Sheila had returned to retrieve his medication but wouldn't say where he was.\n\n\nSteffy asked what the fight had been about. Quinn replied that it didn't matter. All that mattered was getting Eric back. \"Yeah, away from that psychopath,\" Steffy said. Liam was skeptical and said that Eric might mean to stay away. \"Or she means him to!\" Quinn exclaimed. Quinn said Sheila looked at Eric in a territorial and scary way.\n\n\nSteffy said everything about Sheila was scary. Liam asked if Sheila would physically hurt Eric. Quinn didn't know, but she said Sheila might have a gun. Quinn had thought she'd felt it in Sheila's purse, and Steffy readily believed that Sheila would have one. Quinn wanted to do something. Liam offered to stay there while Quinn got some air.\n\n\nQuinn didn't want air; she wanted her husband back. Steffy and Liam said they'd stay there while Quinn went to question people about Eric's whereabouts. Liam offered to try to track Eric through the laptop. After Quinn left, Steffy asked if Liam needed an app to track Eric's phone. Liam didn't and asked if she remembered that he \"used to do this\" for a living. Steffy asked Liam to find Eric before Sheila took him away for good.\n\n\nLater, Steffy entered the living room and asked if Liam had had any luck. He hadn't and asked where she'd been. Steffy had been retrieving something of her grandmother's. Liam grew anxious upon seeing an ivory-handled revolver in Steffy's hand. Steffy wasn't planning on using it, but she also didn't want to take any chances.\n\n\nSteffy said Sheila was evil, and Steffy wouldn't let Sheila do those things to her family again. Liam replied that he knew it hurt, but her mother was okay. Steffy replied that she hadn't been fine, and her siblings hadn't been, either. They'd lost all that time with their mother, and Steffy wouldn't let Sheila take Steffy's grandfather.\n\n\nLiam heard a ping. He said that was it, and he had the location of Eric's phone. Steffy and Liam hurried out of the house.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Eric was startled when he awakened and saw Sheila, inches from his face, gazing at him. She said she'd gotten his medications and razor, and if he needed anything else, she'd be happy to go back to get it. Eric asked if Sheila had had any run-ins. Sheila replied that his cheating wife didn't like her too much.\n\n\nEric asked what Quinn had said. Sheila stated that it had been more lies about \"the kiss\" being innocent, and Quinn had begged Sheila to say where Eric was. Eric hoped Sheila hadn't told Quinn. Sheila said he was safe with her, and she'd never betray him.\n\n\nEric thanked Sheila for handling things. He didn't want to see Quinn. Sheila replied that he didn't have to until he was ready. Sheila said it hadn't been easy, and she'd had to fight off a confrontation with Quinn. Sheila urged him to drink his water with his medication. She joked that once a nurse, always a nurse.\n\n\nEric thanked Sheila for getting his medications. Sheila said she'd do anything for him. He asked if she understood that \"I'm not...You and I are not ever...\" She said she knew, and there were no ulterior motives. She wanted to do things that mattered and help people in need. She noted that he was in need.\n\n\nEric believed he needed time to wrap his mind around what Ridge and Quinn had done to him. Sheila said she'd do whatever was necessary to get him the time he needed. She offered to keep the entire family away from him and said he didn't have to see any of them again.\n\n\nLater, Eric adjusted himself as he read on the bed. Sheila rushed to fix his pillows. He said he was okay, and she asked him to just let her fuss over him a bit. She offered to get him tea and said if he was hungry, she'd seen a pizza place up the street. He didn't answer. Sheila said she could go to her room if he wanted to be alone. \"Either way, Sheila,\" Eric murmured. She said she'd check on him later.\n\n\nAt the door, Steffy knocked and asked if her grandfather was in there. Sheila said she'd get rid of Steffy for him. Sheila opened the door, and Steffy murmured that Sheila really was back. Sheila began say something, but Steffy pushed by her, and Steffy and Liam entered the room. They went to Eric, who was getting off the bed.\n\n\nSheila said Eric didn't want to see Liam and Steffy or have anything to do with anyone in their family. She ordered Steffy and Liam to leave. Steffy asserted that Sheila was the one who'd be going. Sheila decided everyone would go to give Eric time to himself. Steffy yelled that her grandfather could speak for himself. She asked Eric was what going on.\n\n\nEric said that it was personal. Steffy asked if he could tell Sheila but not Steffy. \"You can stay in a hotel room with her?\" Steffy asked. Eric said that wasn't what was going on there, and Sheila said it was coincidence that she and Eric were staying at the same hotel. Steffy didn't buy it and asked Eric what was going on.\n\n\nLiam asked if something had happened between Eric and Quinn. Eric replied that it wasn't for him to tell. Steffy was confused, and Eric said to ask her father. Sheila kept trying to get Steffy to leave, but Steffy refused to go until she got answers. Steffy asked why Sheila was hovering over Eric like a bodyguard. Sheila claimed she was helping Eric and taking care of him.\n\n\nSteffy said the job was done, and Sheila needed to step aside. Sheila grabbed Steffy's arm, but Liam broke the gasp. Steffy said Sheila didn't have the right to say when Steffy could see her grandfather. Sheila said Eric had made it clear that he didn't want his family there.\n\n\nEric walked around, not contradicting Sheila. Steffy asked him to let her help him get through it. Sheila yelled that she was helping him, and they needed to leave. Steffy asked what Sheila was doing to help. Going to her purse, Sheila asked if Steffy wanted to know what Sheila was doing to help.\n\n\n\"Whoa! Whoa! She's got a gun!\" Liam yelled as Sheila dug through her purse. Steffy shoved Liam aside, whipped out her gun, and shot Sheila. The bullet hit Sheila in the shoulder, and Eric rushed over as she fell, toppling a table as she went down.\n\n\n",
