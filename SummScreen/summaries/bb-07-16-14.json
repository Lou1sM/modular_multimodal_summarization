    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge tried to sketch, but he was still frustrated. He had done better than the last time he had tried, but he was still unable to put his ideas on paper. Katie was nearby. She offered to leave if she had been a distraction. Ridge asked her to stay. They embraced. \"I can't connect my mind and my hands,\" Ridge said. \n\n\nRidge let his mind wander, and he saw the helicopter blades and the Spencer logo on a jacket. He threw out another sketch, and he noted that he never should have gone to Abu Dhabi. Katie and Ridge discussed that he'd had the right motive -- to save Brooke from marrying Bill. Katie blamed Quinn for sending a photo that had made Ridge think it was necessary to save Brooke from Bill. \"I wanted your sister to know the truth, and it was a waste,\" Ridge said. He lamented that he he'd tried to pull of off a cartoon hero caper. \n\n\nRidge recalled getting into the helicopter with Brooke. He should have buckled up, he said. And then he remembered the helicopter banked. He stopped as if he'd remembered something else. Ridge grabbed his phone. \"What are you doing,\" ?\" Katie asked. \"Getting some answers,\" Ridge replied. \n\n\nRidge called Kyle, the Forrester private airplane pilot. Ridge asked who had piloted the helicopter that Ridge had chartered. Kyle said that the helicopter Ridge had chartered had never left the airport. Ridge argued that a chopper had picked up Brooke and Ridge, but Kyle maintained that it had not been the chartered helicopter. Ridge wondered whose helicopter it had been and who the pilot had been. Kyle had no idea. Ridge hung up.\n\n\nRidge told Katie that he remembered more each day. He insisted that he had seen a Spencer Publications logo. He wanted to find out the truth. Katie maintained that it had been an accident, but Ridge didn't think it was an accident. He promised that if it had been an accident, he would let it go, but he didn't believe anything about it had been accidental. He believed it was had been part of a plan. \n\n\nRidge flashed back to when he he'd climbed into the helicopter. He remembered the Spencer logo and realized they had been in the wrong helicopter. Ridge looked like he remembered more about the incident. \n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Maya looked at photos. Oliver entered and asked if she had seen Aly. Maya answered that she had not seen her but intended to see her before she left Forrester. Oliver explained that he had fallen in love with Aly, and he had already told her about the recording. \n\n\nMaya smirked and said that he had lost Aly, but Oliver disagreed. \"She'll never believe you again,\" Maya said. Oliver left, and Maya lamented that they had both lost Forresters. Carter entered and told Maya that he hoped her actions had not ruined things for Aly and Oliver the same way she had ruined things for Maya and Carter. He left. \n\n\nOliver continued to look for Aly, and Aly hid from Oliver. In an office, Aly spoke to the vision of her mother. Aly told her mother, Darla, that she had made a mistake in thinking that Oliver had cared about her. Darla reminded Aly there was nothing to fear. Darla wondered if Aly was sure that Oliver didn't care about her. \n\n\nAly told her mother that Oliver had confessed that he had originally dated her to keep his job, but his feelings had changed and he truly cared about her. Darla reminded Aly to trust her feelings and her heart. Aly said that Oliver had been her knight in shining armor. \n\n\nDarla advised her Aly not to forget her feelings for Oliver. Pam entered wearing a medieval costume, and Aly shared that Oliver had been insincere. Aly worried that she couldn't be with someone who had led her on. Aly maintained that Oliver had only wanted to keep his job. \n\n\nPam believed Oliver had been sincere about his feelings. Aly confessed that she wanted to believe him, but she didn't want to see him. They could hear Oliver shouting Aly's name in the corridor outside the office. Charlie entered in his medieval costume. \n\n\nCharlie and Pam convinced Aly to attend another medieval feast with them. \"Let's storm the castle,\" Charlie said. Aly smiled. Charlie, Aly, and Pam exited the office and sneaked into the Forrester main lobby to hide from Oliver. They headed toward the elevator. In the hallway, Oliver ran into Carter, and Carter told Oliver that he had been rooting for Aly and Oliver as a couple. Oliver looked toward the elevator and saw Pam, Charlie, and Aly leave in their medieval garb. \n\n\nAt Spencer, Justin told Bill that he had been worried about contracts that Carter had at Forrester. Justin said he had run into Ridge at Forrester, and he Ridge had been weird. Bill told Justin to stop worrying because Ridge would be groggy for weeks. Justin worried that Ridge would get his memory back, and Bill disagreed. \n\n\nJustin said that Bill need to be realistic and understand that if Ridge did find out what had happened, he would be like a mad dog looking for answers \"in a cold sweat of comeuppance.\" Bill reminded Justin that there had been no flight plan, and the only two people who knew about the chopper were Bill and Justin. Bill maintained that they had to agree that the helicopter had never taken off. There had been no flight plan, and the only two people who knew the truth were Bill and Justin. Bill believed they were in the clear. \n\n\nAt the medieval feast, Pam, Charlie, and Aly sat down to their feast, and Aly looked depressed. Behind the stage curtain, Oliver looked out into the audience and spotted Aly. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Try as he might, Ridge can't put a sketch to paper. Katie tells him to take his time; it will come back. All he can think of is the SP logo and a tiny part of a man's face piloting the chopper. Ridge tells Katie that he and his dad built this company and if he can't design then he is nothing. Justin hands Bill some contracts concerning FC and says something odd happened over there today. He ran into Ridge and he can't describe it, but he gave him a look. Bill says so he gave him a weird look. The dude is weird so that is par for the course. Justin says he said nothing but hey you and then he left. Bill scoffs and says Ridge had been groggy for weeks so this means nothing. Justin says as long as he does not remember he was piloting the chopper and dumped him for a drink. Oliver chases after Aly to catch up with her. She runs into an empty office and starts talking to her mother. She says Oliver is not who he appears to be. He was just using her to keep his job. He denies it so she doesn't know what to do. He was her knight in shining armor. But she can not just forget what he did. Darla says but she also can not forget her heart either. Pam finds Aly. Pam is all dressed for the Medieval Knights. Charlie comes in and temps Aly with getting some succulent chicken and some jousting that will make her feel better. Oliver runs into Carter in the hallway asking if he has seen Aly. Carter asks if he knows about the recording. Oliver says yes and it means nothing. Carter says for the record he is sorry Maya is messing with him too. Maya looks at some of Oliver's shootings when he comes back and asks if she has seen Aly. Maya says no but she is looking for her too. Oliver says its too late. He's already told Aly everything about the tape ..how it started, who started it, how he really feels, she knows it all. So that hammer that Maya has been holding over his head has just gone poof. Maya says so has his relationship with Aly. He says not yet. He is going to find her and make it right. Maya says Aly may be young but she is not foolish. She will never believe him again. Maya says she guesses they both lost their shot at a Forrester. Justin says they are not out of the woods yet so does Bill have a plan. Bill pours his drink and says they do not need a plan. They just need to be cautious. Justin answers there are only two possibilities \u0096 either Ridge gets his memory back or he doesn't .and the way he looked at him today he thinks he is getting it back. Bill tells him he is being unrealistic. Ridge isn't likely to remember every little detail and certainly not the SP logo. Justin says if it happened to Bill that he knows he'd be like a pit bull trying to find all the answers. So will Ridge ..his worst enemy. And if he starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together it will lead to Bill and to him and they need to do something about that. Bill says it was a surprise for Brooke so there never was a flight plan so therefore there was no helicopter therefore Justin could not have been in it. And the only ones who know about this is the two of them. And it's going to stay that way. Ridge tells Katie that it is a waste of time; he can't come up with anything. He bemoans chasing half way around the world like some comic book hero all for nothing. He should have buckled up. He remembers that is what he was doing helping Brooke buckle up when the helicopter banked. He grabs his phone and says he is going to get some answers. He calls Kyle and asks about the helicopter. Kyle explains that there was no helicopter to pick him up. That pilot never left the helipad. Ridge tells Katie he's getting closer. It wasn't his helicopter that picked him and Brooke up. Charlie is trying to whisk Aly and Pam out of the office when he runs into Oliver who wants Charlie to help him find Aly. Charlie bumbles and fumbles and says he and Pam are late and he can't. Pam tells Aly that she has to go with them as she needs this. And if she stays Oliver is sure to find her. But just as they get on the elevator Oliver sees them in costume and knows where they are going. Carter tells Maya that he hopes she did not ruin it for Aly and Oliver like she did for them. Charlie, Pam and Aly settle into their seats although Charlie has to keep telling a very down Aly to cheer up and get into it. Oliver pulls back the curtain and sees them. Ridge tells Katie what he was just told. There had to be another helicopter, and he keeps seeing the logo SP and wonders if Bill is somehow behind all of this.",
