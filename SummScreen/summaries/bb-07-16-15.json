    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Maya said it was possible that her father might be able to accept her. Rick thought the statement was vague. She knew it didn't sound like much, but her father had taken her transition personally. Until that day, she'd believed that her father had seen her as a disappointment.\n\n\nMaya chose to be cautiously optimistic going forward, and though she wanted to believe that her father was being sincere, she'd be okay if reconciliation didn't happen. Before leaving to return to the office, she stated that it would be really nice to have a relationship with her father again.\n\n\nAt the coffee shop, Nicole recalled that a few hours earlier, her father had been calling Maya a freak. For that reason, Nicole didn't buy Julius' sudden change of heart. The Avants demanded that their daughter show them respect. \"That your brother can become a woman -- \" Julius started to say.\n\n\nJulius cut himself off and stated that he was trying to see things differently, and uniting the family would be beneficial for them all.  In a snarky tone, Nicole asked if that was why Julius had sent Maya away. Julius said he hadn't known what kind of life there could be for someone like Maya, what kind of people would be in that life, or what kind of exposure it would present to the family.\n\n\nJulius believed he'd been right because Maya had wound up in jail, and he'd assumed that she'd take up the same kind of life when she'd gotten released. Nicole claimed it hadn't been the same, and she'd sent her parents pictures and emails to prove it. Julius conveyed that he'd had to see for himself.\n\n\nNicole said that getting to know Maya and the Forresters had been good for her. Julius countered that he and Vivienne deserved the same opportunity to know Maya, the life she lived, and the family she'd gotten close to. Julius decided he should talk to the man Maya had been living with. He tossed a few bills on the table, and rising to leave, he told Nicole to take Vivienne to the hotel.\n\n\nAfter Julius left, Nicole said they should have gone with him. Vivienne stated that they had to let Nicole's father handle it his way. Nicole noted her mother's worried look and asked what she feared Julius would say. Vivienne stated that Julius could be blunt, and some people might not appreciate the directness. \"Like when he called my sister disgusting?\" Nicole asked.\n\n\nVivienne said Julius wouldn't say it to Rick. Nicole questioned it and Julius' ability to accept Maya for who she was. Vivienne reminded her daughter that it hadn't been easy for him, and Nicole knew how it had been with the years of embarrassment and ridicule.\n\n\nNicole asked why Julius was suddenly fine with it. Vivienne replied that he wasn't -- not yet -- but time with Maya might help. Vivienne didn't know what was in her husband's mind; however, she believed he was trying to see the good in Maya and what she could add to their lives.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Rick opened the door for Julius, and Julius promptly introduced himself. The men shook hands and sat in the living room. Rick said Maya had gone into the office to prepare for the show the next day. Julius asked if Rick wasn't needed. Rick relayed that he worked for the International division; he'd worked and lived in Paris, but Los Angles had become his home again.\n\n\nRick remarked that he knew about Julius' talk with Maya earlier, but Rick didn't know just how much Julius wanted to know about Maya or her relationship with Rick. Julius said he did want to know, and he was interested in hearing what kind of man wanted to make a life with a woman like Maya.\n\n\nJulius noted that Maya had relayed that the portrait had been Rick's idea. Rick said it was a family tradition, and when Maya had moved in, Rick's father had had a portrait of his wife there. \"Lady of the house,\" Julius said, and Rick replied, \"Something like that.\" Julius assumed Rick hadn't \"known\" when he'd put it there. The fact that Rick hadn't removed it said a lot to Julius.\n\n\nRick conveyed that he wasn't proud of how he'd reacted upon finding out. Julius asked if Rick hadn't suspected. Rick said he hadn't had any idea, but Spencer publicizing it had led to his bad reaction.\n\n\n\"Humiliating,\" Julius concluded. Rick said it wasn't that, but Maya had also assumed the same thing and that he'd reject her. Rick stated that it wouldn't happen, and he loved Maya, to whom he was completely committed. \"So you're straight?\" Julius asked.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" Rick replied.\n\n\n\"You like girls,\" Julius clarified.\n\n\n\"Well, yes, obviously,\" Rick responded. Julius surmised that before Maya, Rick had dated regular women. Rick replied that he saw no difference between Maya and other women. With a knowing chuckle, Julius said that Rick was a successful man and could have any woman he wanted. He asked if Rick really wanted Maya. Rick asserted that he did.\n\n\nRick asked if it was surprising to Julius that someone could appreciate Maya for who she was. Rick had been under the impression that Julius was trying to accept Maya and asked if Maya was wrong about it. Julius said he was there because he was trying. Julius and Vivienne wanted to be a part of Maya's life, but they needed to know if Rick was committed and if it would last.\n\n\nRick said he and Maya had been through a lot, but he didn't know what Julius knew of it. Julius said he'd rather not know what Maya had \"been through.\" Rick said Julius would be impressed, and Maya inspired him as no one ever had. Julius asked where Rick saw the relationship going.\n\n\nRick respected that Julius wanted to know Rick's intentions. Julius asked if Rick saw a future with Maya, and Rick said he did. Julius believed it was good. Julius had previously prided himself on the stability of his family, but when Maya had gone, he'd lost it. He said the trip to see her might help them get it back.\n\n\nIn her bedroom, Aly stared at her Maya-Steffy hate board and wondered what kind of message tolerance, freedom, and acceptance was. She asked what had happened to romance, elegance, and glamour. Throwing her board onto the bed, Aly said the new line wasn't sexy; it was smut.\n\n\nDarla's face appeared over one of the photos on Aly's board, and Darla agreed that it was wrong. Aly half-sobbed, upset that even Ivy didn't get it. Aly said the others were trying to do something good, but if they didn't stop, they'd ruin everything. Aly had left Forrester because she couldn't stomach pretending that Maya and Steffy were role models. Darla instructed Aly to go back because she was the only one who could put a stop to it.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge, Steffy, and Caroline were working in the CEO's office, and Steffy was amazed by the amount of work she could do without Aly breathing down her neck. Caroline was glad that Steffy had gotten through to Aly. Steffy said she didn't want Aly to leave, but she'd had to wake Aly up about getting on board. Ridge said they all had to be on board for the campaign to succeed.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was fitting a gown to a transgender woman, and Maya was apologizing to Steffy for being late. Steffy was thankful that Maya had put them in touch with Sonja.\n\n\nAly arrived, studied Sonja, and asked Steffy who she was. Steffy replied that it was Maya's friend, who was in the show happening the next day. \"Oh,\" Aly stiffly replied. As everyone worked around her and talked with Sonja, Aly looked as if she might erupt.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Aly wanted an introduction to Sonja. \"No!\" Aly said as if offended. She added that they were busy, and she didn't want to get in the way. Steffy walked off, and Aly darted her slanty, disapproving stare back at Ridge, Caroline, and Sonja, who was leaving to take the dress to fitting.\n\n\nAfter Sonja had gone, Steffy figured Maya need to get home to get some rest. As Maya, Ridge, and Steffy discussed how California Freedom was what Forrester was all about, Aly marched out of the office. In the corridor, she declared that it couldn't go on, and she had to stop it.\n\n\nAly went to the sky lounge, and in the overcast sky, Darla appeared. Darla said it was almost time to make them pay. Aly asked how to do it. A music box tune played as Aly stared down at Steffy's car, parked in the lot below. Tears rolled down her face as a flashback of Darla's car incident played on screen. Darla told Aly to take from them what they'd taken from Aly. \"Tomorrow, the day of reckoning finally arrives,\" Darla proclaimed.\n\n\n",

If it doesn't happen she will be okay but if it does then things would be a great deal better. Nicole asks Julius if he really means it that he will accept Maya. He asks her not to drag her mother into this. She asks again if it is true because she does not buy it. Julius says it is hard but he is hoping they can come back together as a family again.

Julius says he wants what is best for this family and that is all he has always wanted. He did not know what kind of people Maya would bring around her. She was in jail and he assumed it would always be the same so he had to see for himself. Nicole got to know Maya so her mother and father deserve that same opportunity.

Vivienne admits Julius can be blunt and some people may not be able to accept him. It's been very difficult all these years, the embarrassment and ridicule. That is why Nicole is so sure that is not going to change now. Vivienne thinks perhaps spending some time with Maya may help, at lease she hopes so. He is trying to see the good in Maya and what she can bring to their lives. Julius thinks it says a lot that Rick put Maya's portrait up before he knew she was transgender but he also did not take it down. Maya thought he would reject her when he found out she was transgender and that is not going to happen. He is surprised but answers Julius's question is he straight and did he always date regular girls. Rick says he sees no difference.
