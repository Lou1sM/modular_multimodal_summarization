    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas re-arranges some pictures in Douglas's room, putting Caroline's away and adding Hope and some of her with Douglas. Hope looks in and he lies that he was only checking under the bed and no more monsters. He says he feels terrible that he did not hear Douglas's scream and only glad that she made it to him on time. It made all the difference in the world. She stays a moment and says she is on her way over to see Liam as she thinks she owes him this news in person. Eric and Quinn drop in on Ridge and Brooke. He says it only happened last night but Xander called and said he is going back home; he had no other alternative. Thomas joins them and hugs Eric and Quinn and glad they came on such short notice. He explains that last night Hope said she wanted to get married as soon as possible. She is as anxious as he is. Brooke tells Thomas that she does not understand this. She thought Hope wanted to wait a while. He tells her about the nightmare Douglas had that caused her to push the wedding up so she could be his mommy now. This is what Hope wants; he did not pressure her in any way. Ridge joins in and says they can ask Hope. Eric says they would love to host another wedding at his place. Quinn says they have more than one impromptu wedding at their home. Thomas thanks him but says now that Douglas considers this is home he thought it would be special if they could marry here in this house. Ridge says of course they can. Thomas even says he would like the cousins to come and they could have festive balloons, stuffed animals and such and make it a real special occasion. Hope is on board for that too. Thomas explains to Douglas what a best man is who stands by the groom all day and he would like him to be that best man. Douglas is delighted. Then Thomas sits by his bed and has a fantasy of Hope there in her lingerie and being the aggressor as she takes off his shirt and says she does not want to wait for their wedding night. She wants him now and always. It rocks Liam when Hope says the wedding will be tomorrow. He asks questions and she has to explain about the nightmare Douglas had. Thomas was in shower and did not hear the scream but she was there and got him to calm down. She will not take Caroline's place but she can be Douglas's step-mom starting tomorrow. She goes even further by shocking Steffy when she asks her to be her matron of honor. She has done such a great job with the two girls and Liam and she wants to do the same with Douglas and still raise all of them being close. Steffy says of course, she will be honored. But when Steffy goes to attend to the girls, Liam begs her not to marry Thomas tomorrow. She is definitely not ready for this. Steffy brings Phoebe out for Hope to hold and she goes gaga over her as always. She tells Liam this is the reason that she has to marry Thomas and be Douglas's mother. She knows what she needs. He says he will never stop being protective of her because he will never stop loving her. So tell him what he needs to do. Being engaged to Thomas is one thing but being married tomorrow is a whole other world. If she is doing this because he moved in with Steffy, he could move out if that would help.",
