Liam stammered while greeting them, but Steffy swooped in, recognizing the guests and notifying them of their up-front seats. Liam called her a natural while he acted more like a flight attendant.\n\n\nIvy stared at the two from backstage. Wyatt pulled her back, saying there was nothing to see out there and plenty to do. Aly appeared and leered at Steffy and Liam from behind a dressing screen.\n\n\nAfter Ivy had checked jewelry on the transgender models, Aly slinked up and told Ivy to just look at Steffy all over Liam. Aly had a delusion of Steffy draped against Liam and swinging her hair. What Ivy saw were the executives talking, and she said Steffy wasn't all over Liam.\n\n\nAly wondered if, to Steffy, freedom meant taking what she wanted. Ivy replied that they were all trying to get along, and Aly needed to calm down and stop being judgmental. Carter called Ivy away, and Aly watched as Liam dragged Steffy away to a place he called \"the future.\"\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Steffy fussed about leaving her and Liam's first fashion show. Liam said the future had arrived. It was them working together, running Forrester, and keeping it relevant for years to come. He said the future was standing right before him, and it was she, the force of nature who'd barreled back into his life to fight for what she believed in.\n\n\nLiam claimed Steffy didn't have to fight anymore, and he thanked her for giving him the time to see the obvious. She wiped away tears, and he told her not to cry. He claimed to be right where he wanted to be, with her, day after day and year after year. They kissed, and he said, \"Cha, cha, cha.\"\n\n\nBack at the show, Quinn inspected jewelry, and her husband swooped behind her to give her a kiss of support. Later, Quinn was alone, peeking through the curtain and grinning at the crowd She spotted Deacon talking to Brooke, and the grin faded.\n\n\nIn the showroom, Deacon told Brooke that he was glad to find someone else without a drink in hand. Brooke thanked him for helping her through. He replied that he'd always be there for her.\n\n\nBill and Katie arrived, and Jarret was surprised to see his boss. Bill said his son was third in command, and he had stock in the business. Bill didn't see what all the hype of the show was about but told Jarrett to get a story. Jarrett said he'd try his best, and Bill ordered the reporter to do his job, because there had to be something that would make headlines.\n\n\nMaya sat at a dressing table as Carter told Rick that every international buyer had accepted their invitations. Rick cooed that it was to be expected, since he ran International. Rick then greeted Maya, who said it would be a big show for her with her parents there. It was her first public appearance since her outing, and she wanted to stand proud and take back her power.\n\n\nBack in the showroom, Julius and Vivienne arrived. Vivienne's eye danced with amazement. Julius glanced around curiously but didn't see what all the fuss was. Nicole greeted them and introduced them to Zende and the other interns. \"You're a Forrester?\" Julius quizzically asked Zende.\n\n\nVivienne wondrously asked if famous people would be there, and Nicole said, \"Here comes one now.\" Brooke rounded Vivienne and greeted the Avants. Grinning, Vivienne said to call them by their first names. Julius said that Rick was a good man, and he appreciated what Rick had done for Maya's life.\n\n\nOnce they were alone in the crowd, Julius said it was a whole other world out there in \"La La Land.\" Vivienne was awed about the swag bags in the lobby and wished she'd packed nicer clothes to wear. He asked what was wrong with her clothes. \"Look around,\" she murmured. He said he had looked around, and she looked fine.\n\n\nJulius wanted to know when the show would finally start. Vivienne urged him to relax and enjoy things. She was very proud of Maya. Julius said he was trying, but it was wrong. \"Our son -- my firstborn, traipsing up and down on a runway, wearing women's clothing. How humiliating!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\nLater, Rick found Brooke in the showroom. He was enthusiastic about the show. Brooke was, too, but she was still sad that he'd lost his CEO position. Rick wanted to run the business, but he felt it was a big day for himself and Maya. The future was before them, and he hinted that no one could take it from them -- especially after that day.\n\n\nRick strolled over to Othello, and Othello assured him that everything would be fine. Rick replied that he wanted it to be a special night for himself and Maya.\n\n\nBackstage, Nick sat with Maya, who said that if they talked to anyone or sparked a conversation, then they'd done their job. \"Reaching out to all walks of life,\" he responded, adding that the show was really for \"all of us.\" He asked how she felt about her parents in the audience. She replied that it was strange but good, and for the first time in her life, her father had said he was willing to try to accept her. She hoped that Julius had meant it.\n\n\nSteffy and Liam returned backstage, and Aly returned to glaring at them. Ivy bustled around, and Steffy asked if Ivy knew. Liam claimed that he hadn't gotten to Ivy before he'd felt he'd lose the chance to tell Steffy, but he'd tell Ivy soon.\n\n\nSteffy put Ridge on the spot, telling everyone that their CEO had some words. Ridge stammered. He decided to thank everyone for their time and dedication. He held Caroline from behind and thanked his co-designer, who was more talented than he'd ever be. Caroline thanked him for admitting it. He said that they made the gowns, but the models made them wonderful.\n\n\nRidge said California Freedom was about celebrating everyone's uniqueness without judgment or fear. He was proud of them for redefining Forrester and moving into the future together. Everyone clapped except Aly, who looked away.\n\n\nRight before the show, Ivy found a moment to express excitement about the show to Liam. She said it was like a new beginning for them all. Liam agreed and requested to talk to her after the show.\n\n\nThe show began with Ridge, who welcomed everyone. He introduced Maya and Steffy. Steffy said they'd had HFTF, but they no longer needed it. She claimed that the future was \"right now.\" She and Maya shared the microphone as they discussed living in a world of free believers, who were free to love themselves and each other. From the ocean to the redwoods, they said that California embodied diversity in its beauty and its people.\n\n\nThey ladies urged everyone to be creative and kind with no condemnation, shame or guilt. They said open hearts and open minds -- \"this is California Freedom.\"\n\n\nEnergetic music played as the first model took to the runway in a black lace-top dress with a hip-high split. The music changed to a dark, music box tune as Aly glared at the model.\n\n\nAly went backstage, where Maya had just changed into a cream-colored gown that glittered like diamonds. Ridge remarked that she was beautiful, and her father would be proud. Maya strode out onto the stage to resounding applause.\n\n\nRick and Brooke grinned at each other. Vivienne proudly watched, but Julius appeared uncomfortable.\n\n\nBackstage, Darla's dark spirit appeared to tell Aly that it wasn't freedom; it was sex. Darla said there was no peace-making with them, and they'd become enemies for life. Darla seethed that it was pornography and directed Aly to make it stop. Darla told Aly to save the legacy. She said Aly knew what to do to put an end to it once and for all.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Last-minute preparations are underway at Forrester Creations for the big fashion show. When Vivienne and Julius Avant arrive, they are overwhelmed by the glamour. Vivienne is extremely proud of her daughter, while Julius still feels uneasy with the whole situation. Maya is excited and nervous because her parents are in attendance and will see her as she truly is for the first time. Rick gives his fiancee a pep talk. Ridge introduces the California Freedom-line and then, as a first, transgender models take the stage. Quinn is unnerved when Deacon and Brooke take seats next to each other. Backstage, Ivy stares at Liam and Steffy flirting until Wyatt pulls her away. Alexandria is skulking around, clearly upset about the show. Darla's vision gives Aly sinister encouragement to follow up with her plan.",
    "tvmega_recap": "All is coming together backstage at the Fashion Shoot. Carter tells Rick that they are above capacity as no one declined the invitation. Rick says that is great but not his problem since he runs International now. Brooke joins and tells him how proud she is of him although she knows he would still like to be CEO. He says yes but that does not matter now. No one can take this day away from him and it will be greater especially after today. He tells Maya that she is beautiful and knows she is anxious because her parents are in the audience. She says yes she just wants to get out there and stand proud. This is the first time she has been before the public since she has been outed by the press and she just wants to get her power back. Julius and Vivienne walk around the presentation room and she seems impressed. Nicole introduces them to Zende and the other interns. Julius is surprised to learn that Zende is a Forrester. While Ridge and Caroline and Steffy and Liam seem very happy, Aly has a look of disgust on her face. Bill and Katie sip champagne and he even tells Jarrett to do his job and get him a good story tonight. Deacon surprises Quinn with a kiss. She is delighted until she sees him talking later with Brooke ever how innocently it is. Rick tells the DJ Othello that he wants things to be perfect. Vivienne feels underdressed but Julius says she looks fine. He comments that the gift bags out front must have cost half a million dollars. Ivy seems slightly miffed that Steffy and Liam are cuddled together talking intimately. Wyatt takes her away and says there is nothing important to see out there. Liam drags Steffy out to the Sky Lounge and tells her this is their future. They are going to be running Forrester Creations together. He thanks her for being so patient with him. He finally sees the obvious. He is right where he wants to be. They kiss passionately. Aly gives them the stink eye. Ridge thanks everyone backstage for their hard work and to Caroline his co-designer who has proven herself more and more times that she is more talented than he. Ivy thanks Liam and he wishes her well too. He says he knows now is not the time but they really should talk after the show. Ridge stands on stage and welcomes the audience. They are here to introduce California Freedom, about empowerment and acceptance. He calls out Steffy and Maya. Vivienne looks proud but Julius looks annoyed. He tells Vivienne this is so wrong, their son waltzing down the aisle dressed as a woman. Steffy announces they once had Hope For The Future but it is no longer needed. Maya adds that they are not looking for sameness or the same old thing. Steffy does not want guilt, society is full of free believers and California embodies that diversity and beauty. The models come out, two being transgender. The audience seems to like it but again Aly is sullen. In her head she listens to dark Darla who says this is not about freedom, but sex. This is pornography not romance. Aly has to put an end to this once and for all.",
