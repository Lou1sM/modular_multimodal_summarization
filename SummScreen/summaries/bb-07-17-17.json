    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the hotel, Eric rushed to Sheila, who was on the floor. He asked Steffy what she'd done. Steffy stammered that Sheila had a gun. Eric wanted to call emergency services, but Sheila claimed that she was okay. Liam located the bullet hole in the wall and determined that Steffy had missed.  Eric decided to call himself. Liam figured that someone else had already called, and he asked what they'd say when police arrived.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that Liam get Sheila's gun. From Sheila's purse, Liam retrieved an electric razor. Eric exclaimed that it was his razor from the house. Sheila said she'd been about to show it to Steffy as proof that Sheila was helping Eric. Liam took Steffy's gun, and Eric ranted about Steffy busting in and shooting up the place. Liam said that Quinn had told them that Sheila had a gun.\n\n\nEric asked when Liam, of all people, would believe Quinn. Liam noticed a rip in the shoulder of Sheila's shirt and a little blood. Eric decided that they had to call emergency services. Gesturing to Steffy, Liam asked if Eric was sure he wanted to call.\n\n\nSteffy and Eric directed Liam to get something from the bathroom to disinfect the wound. Sheila said it was just a flesh wound, and she hardly even felt anything. Steffy was sure Sheila would feel it later. Eric stated that Steffy didn't get to judge how bad it was, and Liam didn't get to decide whether to call the police or not. Steffy replied that she'd been told her whole life that Sheila was dangerous. Eric asked Sheila what she wanted to do and said it was up to her.\n\n\nLater, Liam and Eric had patched Sheila's arm with a face cloth. Eric wanted the gun to stay there, but Sheila asked what they planned to say at the hospital. She reminded them that she was a nurse, and she believed she'd be fine from the noncritical injury.\n\n\nSteffy had never thought she'd be apologizing to the woman who'd shot her mother, but she expressed sorrow for shooting Sheila. Sheila said that Steffy had had every right to be afraid.\n\n\nHotel security knocked on the door. Eric offered to say he'd done it, but Sheila said she'd handle it. She took all the wound dressings into the bathroom and closed the door. Eric and Steffy stood in front of the bullet hole in the wall, and Liam answered the door. Liam thanked God to see security on the other side. He said they'd heard a gunshot and had been about to call.\n\n\nOne of the officers indicated that everyone had heard it and asked if they knew what direction it had emanated from. Steffy said they couldn't tell. Eric thought it had sounded close. Liam thought he'd heard running in the corridor. One officer said they were doing a building sweep, and the other asked if they could look in the bathroom.\n\n\nSteffy leaned on the wall to better cover the hole as the security officer strode over and tried the bathroom door. It was locked, and he asked who was in there. Sheila emerged in a robe and asked what was happening. Seeing the officers, she said it really had been a gunshot. She said she'd been about to shower when they'd heard it, and she asked if they'd found out who'd done it. The officer said they would find out, and they were sorry for the disturbance.\n\n\nAfter the security officers left, Sheila took off Eric's robe and revealed her street clothes. Steffy said Sheila hadn't had to do what she'd done because Steffy had planned to explain things. Sheila replied that they'd all be headed to the police station. Liam thought the way they'd handled it was a lot simpler, and Eric thanked Sheila. \"I mean it,\" he added.\n\n\nSteffy thanked Sheila for covering, but Steffy still didn't understand what was going on. Eric claimed that Sheila had just gotten him things that he'd asked for, and he insisted that he and Sheila weren't shacking up. It didn't make sense to Steffy, who wanted to know why Eric wasn't at home. He replied that he just chose not to be.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Eric and Quinn had fought. Eric stated that he hadn't said so, but Steffy replied that Quinn had. Eric decided that Steffy had her answer. Steffy told him that she'd shot another human being because she'd thought he was in trouble, and she still thought so. She was confused by him acting as if it was the most normal thing in the world, and she insisted that somebody had better tell her what was going on.\n\n\nLater, Liam arrived with a white paper bag. Eric asked how it had gone. Liam relayed that two disinterested police officers were talking to security in the lobby. He detailed the contents of the bag: gauze, saline, ointment, and tape. He asked if Sheila would be okay. Sheila thought so.\n\n\nSteffy didn't believe that Sheila had just happened to be staying down the hall. Steffy wanted Eric to go home, but Eric refused. Steffy said everyone knew his face. \"Not here, they don't,\" he replied. Guessing that Eric just wanted to be under the radar, she asked why he didn't just stay at the guesthouse with her father. Eric doubted Ridge was still there. \"Since when?\" she asked.\n\n\nEric didn't want to talk about it, but Steffy said that Quinn was frantic. Eric didn't see it as his problem. Steffy asked why he hadn't just kicked Quinn out. Eric said it wasn't always about who was right or got the spoils; sometimes, it was just about needing space, something Eric was sure Liam knew about. Liam gleaned that Quinn had somehow shown her true colors.\n\n\nSteffy figured that Sheila knew and demanded answers from her. \"Or else what?\" Eric asked. Steffy stated that Eric had said he wasn't in trouble, but \"this\" looked like trouble. She asked how she could know that Sheila wasn't holding him hostage. Eric stated that Steffy had to trust him, and he had to trust her and Liam not to tell anyone where he was staying.\n\n\n\"Except Dad,\" Steffy stated. Eric replied that Ridge especially couldn't know. Steffy recalled that Eric had said to ask her father about what was happening. Eric replied that she could ask Ridge anything she wanted, but Eric forbade her from telling Ridge where Eric was.\n\n\nSteffy asked why and said she needed answers. Eric told her that she was more trustworthy than Ridge. Eric asked her to promise not to reveal his location or else she wouldn't find him again -- or at all. Reluctantly, Steffy and Liam agreed. Steffy hugged Eric and left with Liam.\n\n\nSheila noted that Steffy loved Eric. Eric thanked Sheila for not saying anything about the issue to Steffy. Sheila didn't think it was her story to tell. Eric believed Steffy's next stop was Ridge, who'd have a story to tell. Eric apologized again, and said \"this\" never should have happened.\n\n\nSheila believed a lot of people would think it should have happened awhile back. She hinted that she'd been through a lot since they'd parted ways. Eric stated that Sheila had turned out the better for it somehow. Sheila hoped so, but she didn't believe it was for her to say.\n\n\nEric tended to Sheila's wound and said it could have been worse. He asked if it hurt. \"Not when you do it,\" Sheila replied. He told her that she'd always been a flatterer. She said he was good at bandaging the wound. Eric claimed to have had a lot of practice. She remarked that he couldn't take a compliment, but he replied that he didn't forget one, either.\n\n\nSheila figured that Eric also remembered that she could handle of a lot of pain, but Eric claimed to have no idea what she was talking about. She asked if he'd shave off his beard. He said he'd just planned to trim it up. She thought it was good because he looked handsome and worldly with it. She insisted he shave something because the razor had almost been the death of her.\n\n\nEric felt bad about it and knew that Steffy did, too. Sheila stated that Quinn had put the idea in Steffy's head that Sheila had had a gun, but Sheila admitted fault for not letting Quinn believe otherwise. Eric stated that Quinn apparently hadn't gotten over being erratic. Sheila thought she wasn't the one to judge Quinn.\n\n\nSheila said that, while serving time in prison, she'd fantasized about moments alone with Eric like \"this\" one. She hadn't been bleeding in her fantasies, but she joked that she might have been bleeding in his fantasies. Chuckling, he said, \"No.\"\n\n\nSheila stated that she did judge Quinn and Ridge for what they'd done behind Eric's back. Eric guessed that nice guys finished last. Sheila asked what made him think he was finished.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Quinn arrived and asked Ridge if he'd heard from Eric. Ridge hadn't, and Quinn remarked that she hadn't heard from Steffy. Upset, Ridge asked what Quinn had said to Steffy. Quinn conveyed that she'd only said that she and Eric had had a fight, and she'd never tell anyone about the issue. Ridge replied that Eric wasn't good at keeping secrets and hadn't kept his last secret -- which had been Quinn -- for very long.\n\n\nRidge had been calling Eric's friends, trying to ask without asking, and no one had seen Eric. Quinn wondered if Sheila would hurt Eric, and Ridge said Sheila hurt anyone that said \"no\" to her. Quinn stated that she'd said worse to Sheila. Dubbing Quinn lucky, Ridge advised her to just give Sheila whatever she wanted if she showed up again.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Ridge had filed a missing persons report. Ridge complained that everyone would find out, and he said it wasn't a conversation he wanted to have with his kids. Quinn replied that they'd done a sorry job explaining it already and wondered why they couldn't think up anything better to say than \"a few meaningless kisses.\" Ridge said it was hard to explain what he didn't understand, but it wouldn't be long before Steffy put it all together.\n\n\nLater, Ridge and Quinn reviewed some \"pairings.\" Ridge didn't like what Quinn had compiled, and she asked what he wanted her to do. He ordered her to make it better. As he rubbed his temples, she guessed that his heart wasn't in it to hurt her. He apologized for not giving his worst, and she apologized that it wasn't her best work.\n\n\nRidge decided that the personal crisis had to go on hold because they had a deadline to meet. Quinn wished him luck with it. Ridge didn't know what to do when Steffy confronted him about him and her granddad's wife. Quinn knew that he was freaked out, but she reminded him that she wasn't the enemy. He said it had been easier when she had been.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was working alone when Steffy arrived. He said his Jedi mind tricks were working. He'd been thinking of the one person he'd actually wanted to see, and she'd appeared. Steffy poured herself a drink, and he asked what she was doing. She said everyone did it, and he replied that she didn't. Steffy conveyed that she'd had a rough day, but they fortunately hadn't had to bury any bodies.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Ridge knew that her grandfather had disappeared. Ridge replied that Eric wasn't home or at work. Steffy asked why they hadn't called the police. \"What if Quinn offed him?\" she asked. Ridge asked if she thought Quinn had done that. Steffy stated that Eric had gone off with Sheila. Ridge replied that it meant Eric wasn't missing and had just lost his mind.\n\n\nSteffy explained that Quinn wasn't blaming Sheila and had said that there had been a disagreement. Ridge thought that explained it, but Steffy wondered what the disagreement had been. She figured it had to be bad to make Eric go off with Sheila. Ridge didn't know what to add to it if Quinn hadn't said what it had been.\n\n\nSteffy sensed that Ridge's intent was to match stories with Quinn. Ridge said he wasn't telling a story. Steffy believed that Ridge knew something. She asked if Quinn and Eric were breaking up and if it had anything to do with Ridge. Steffy didn't want to think the unthinkable.\n\n\n\"What? You and Quinn?\" Steffy asked. Ridge started to speak, but Steffy said she knew Ridge and Quinn hadn't had an affair. Ridge was silent. \"Right, Dad?\" Steffy asked. She cocked her head, disappointed by the silence that answered her.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Eric and Liam watch motionless as Sheila sinks to the ground after being shot at by Steffy. Fortunately, Sheila only suffered a graze shot. After the initial shock has settled in, she reveals the content of her purse: Eric's razor and his medicine. Steffy grudgingly apologizes as hotel security arrives at door. To everyone's surprise Sheila keeps quiet on Steffy's actions and as a result Eric is sincerely grateful for her silence. Steffy is unable to convince Eric to go home and presses unsuccessfully for more details on his argument with his wife. Eric pleads with Steffy to keep his whereabouts a secret from Quinn and Ridge. At Forrester Creations, Quinn tells Ridge that she and Sheila had a fight. Ridge notes no one knows where Eric is, and they wonder if Sheila would harm him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric yells at Steffy for what she has done. Steffy says Sheila had a gun in her bag. Liam wants to call someone but needs to know what to say. He shows them the bullet hole in the door, the bullet could not have hurt Sheila. Then Sheila shows them her purse and they find the razor. It was not a gun but a razor in her purse. Eric says it is not Steffy's judgment if they call the police or not. He asks Sheila what she wants to do. Quinn questions Ridge if his dad has returned to work. He says no and there is no way of knowing if he is with Sheila or not. But if she shows up again just give her what she wants. The police knock on the door and all quickly hide Sheila and make up a quick story that nothing happened here. The police want to look around. The bathroom door is locked but one policeman sees the bullet hole in the door. Sheila comes out dressed in a robe and explains she was ready to take a shower, so the police apologize and leave. Steffy thanks Sheila for not reporting her. She tells Eric none of this makes sense. He should not be here shacking up with Sheila. She had to force her way in the door and then ended up shooting another human being because she thought Eric was in danger. He ought to be home. In a foul mood, Ridge dumps Quinn's designs on the desk and says they have a deadline and these are not good enough \u0096 back to the drawing board. She says she knows he is not feeling good right now but she is not the enemy. Sheila tells Steffy that she knows she has no credibility with her but Eric would not lie to her. This is where he chooses to stay. Steffy asks him to come home but Eric refuses again; this is where he chooses to stay. He appreciates her concern but this is the way he wants it. Sometimes it is just space one needs. Steffy says how do they know that Sheila is not holding him hostage. He says she is not and no one must know where he is staying. Steffy gives Eric one last hug before she goes. Eric apologizes to Sheila and says this never should have happened but he has come out the better for it. Eric tends to the graze on her arm and she says she is okay and can handle a little pain. She knows it was Quinn's idea who put the idea in Steffy's head that the razor was a gun. He says Quinn has a history of being a little erratic. Sheila retorts that she cannot judge as she has her own past history. She fantasized while she was in prison of being alone with him like this. But she does judge Ridge and Quinn and he deserves better than that. He quips good guys always finish last. She says he is not finished yet. Ridge tells Steffy that his Jedi tricks are still working. She is the one person he wanted to see and here she is. His dad is not here and is not at home either. Steffy informs him that Eric is with Sheila after a disagreement with Quinn. It must have been a bad one to take off with Sheila. She wants to know what is going on. She feels like it involves him .but with Quinn. She does not want to think they had an affair.",
