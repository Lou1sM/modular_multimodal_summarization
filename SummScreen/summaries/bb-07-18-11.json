Ridge and Brooke went upstairs, where she offered him a backrub. \"What about a brain rub?\" he asked. He said Steffy had accused him of walking out her. He knew it'd be a difficult night for \"his little girl,\" and he wished he could hold her hand.\n\n\nRidge noted that Brooke had been though a tough day, too, because of the wedding and Thomas' betrayal. Brooke said Thomas was in the most pain, and she was happy because she had her children and Ridge. Ridge wondered how he'd ever doubted her and caused her to lose her faith in herself. Ridge tenderly kissed Brooke's shoulders, and the two began to make love.\n\n\nThe couple lay together afterward, and Brooke was amazed that Ridge was actually home. Ridge hoped that they'd finally concluded the relationship-testing stage, and Brooke said she didn't ever want to live without him. \"I can't live without you and still be me,\" she told him. He replied that she wouldn't have to be without him, and they cuddled together in bed.\n\n\nDownstairs, Liam and Hope made out on the sofa, and Liam hoped that they wouldn't become a boring couple. Hope asked if her parents were boring. Inspired by Ridge and Brooke's love affair, Liam kissed Hope again. Hope remembered that he was supposed to be getting on a plane soon, and as he left, he assured her that life would work out well for them.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Steffy said Bill didn't have to say those things. Bill, however, replied that he didn't say things he didn't mean, and he really did love her. Steffy felt childish about her tirade over her parents, but he assured her that she was no child. The two kissed more, and Steffy expressed her amazement that he'd called her on the very night that she'd needed him.\n\n\nSteffy told Bill that she felt pathetic for being so upset about her father, but Bill said that not having his father around still affected him to that day. He advised her not to wallow in her feelings, but to use them to fuel her drive and ambition. He stated that she didn't need her father to hold her hand through life, but Steffy continued to bemoan her father's rejection of her. Bill reasoned that she'd made a choice to feel rejected, but she shouldn't do that to herself.\n\n\nSteffy doubted Ridge cared about her, but Bill could tell that Ridge did care, unlike Bill's father, who hadn't cared at all about Bill. She insisted that wouldn't repair her mother's hurt. He replied that she couldn't be responsible for anyone's feelings, but her own. \"You want him to love your mother the way he loves Brooke, and he just doesn't, Steffy,\" Bill explained.\n\n\nBill stated that Ridge couldn't walk away from his feelings for Brooke, and Bill had begun to understand what that felt like. Steffy found it ironic that she couldn't have either of the men she loved most in the world. \"That isn't true,\" Bill uttered. He advised her to let the dream of her parents go and find another one. He offered to help her and be by her side while she accomplished it. As they hugged, Liam entered through the front door and froze upon seeing them together. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells Steffy that he doesn't say things because he has to; he said he loved her because he means it. Ridge and Brooke are worried about Steffy. They fill Hope and Liam in on the details. Ridge knows he has let her down too many times and she is vulnerable. He hates that she is out there all alone. He wishes she had someone to turn to. Steffy tells Bill that he is amazing .the one night she needed him and he called at that moment. She admits she is a grown woman and she is acting like a child because her father did not pick Taylor and their family. Bill says he understands; he will carry that same feeling with him every day. Hating Ridge won't make her feel any better. Bill tells her that he is there for her; they hug. He tells her they all make mistakes, even him, but they learn from them. Don't let this destroy her. Take what she is feeling and channel it; use it at work. He told himself that he would one-up his father .her father did not reject her, but he's also not going to take her by the hand and walk her through life. After making love, Brooke tells Ridge that she always wants him in her life. She can not be herself without him. Liam and Hope kiss goodbye. He laments that it's a good thing he's going on a trip and has to leave .but waiting for her will be worth it. Steffy tells Bill that it is so frustrating and it hurts. Her dad can not see how Brooke is going to constantly disappoint and hurt him. He claims that at least Ridge loves her; his own dad did not care. Expectations can be cruel if misplaced. He knows Steffy wants Ridge to love her mother like he does Brooke, but he doesn't. He can not walk away from his feelings for Brooke. She bemoans that there are two men she loves most in her life and she can't have either one. Bill says that is not true. She has to let her old dream go and find another one. She has so much going on and he is going to be right by her side. He understands her pain and will be there for her. Liam walks in and sees them in an embrace.",
