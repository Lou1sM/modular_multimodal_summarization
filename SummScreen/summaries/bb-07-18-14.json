He claimed he wasn't the same guy in the recording, and he'd had to let her know that. She reasoned that buying a ticket would have been easier, but he replied that he'd needed to get her attention.\n\n\nBlushing, Aly assured Oliver that he'd gotten it, but he could have been hurt. Oliver didn't care. He'd been prepared to challenge each knight in the building to prove his trustworthiness to Aly.\n\n\nAly asked Oliver how he'd even known she'd be there. He explained that he'd seen her in the Forrester elevator in her costume, and she figured that he'd just had to be in the show. Oliver joked that it had been more like crashing it because he hadn't done an audition beforehand.\n\n\nA family interrupted Oliver and Aly to ask them to pose for a picture, and afterward, Pam and Charlie entered and voiced their amazement at Oliver's performance. Charlie wanted to know how Oliver had gotten by the top-notch security, but before Oliver could answer, Pam pulled the four of them together to take a photo with friends.\n\n\nWhile snapping the picture, Pam asked if they were all friends still, and Oliver looked at Aly. Pam and Charlie left Oliver and Aly to talk alone. Oliver said he'd screwed up, but he'd cared about Aly since day one. She said she knew it. She decided to forgive him, as long as he told the truth no matter what.\n\n\nAly ordered Oliver never to scare her again. She'd thought he'd been as good as dead during the jousting. Oliver made a show of his jousting bravado and said his lady had needed her carnation.\n\n\nAly realized that she didn't have the flower. As Aly looked around on the floor for the carnation, the Darla vision made it appear in Oliver's hands, which were tucked behind his back. Oliver frowned in surprise upon feeling something in his hand. Smiling, he gave the flower to Aly.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill admitted that he was a powerful man who could do many things. \"But controlling a helicopter from the ground?\" he asked. Ridge said he'd seen something. Bill guessed Ridge had seen the evil Bill twirling his mustache. Bill claimed that he'd actually been running down the beach to get to Brooke. Ridge figured Bill wanted him to believe it was a coincidence that Justin had been the pilot; however, Ridge was certain that Bill had ordered Justin to act.\n\n\nBill called it ludicrous, and Ridge asked if Bill was denying Justin's presence on the beach. Bill freely admitted that Justin had flown to the Emirates, and Ridge asked why. \"To fly around in a helicopter and dispose of wedding crashers,\" Bill quipped. Katie gave Bill a tried look, and he asked what she and Ridge wanted from him.\n\n\nBill understood Ridge's need for answers. Bill hoped Ridge would get them, but Bill said he didn't have them. Brooke proffered that she didn't remember much about the pilot because things had been too frantic. Bill decided that he knew what was going on. He said that Ridge needed to justify deciding to go all the way to Abu Dhabi to save Brooke.\n\n\nRidge asserted that Bill had cheated on Brooke; however, Bill corrected that he hadn't cheated; he'd kept a secret that he probably should have told Brooke before the wedding. Bill reasoned that if Ridge had emailed the picture and then used the phone to \"gossip\" to Brooke about Bill and Quinn, then the incident would have been avoided. Ridge said Bill would have talked his way out of it.\n\n\n\"Talked my way out of what? Explaining what had actually happened?\" Bill incredulously asked. Bill illuminated the fact that sleeping with Quinn had only happened once, and it had happened on the night that Brooke had been marrying Ridge. Bill sarcastically said his actions with Quinn had been horrifying enough to justify Ridge traipsing off to Abu Dhabi.\n\n\nKatie admitted that they hadn't had all the details. \"No, you didn't. And that's the point. You just had to stop me!\" Bill responded. Bill figured that Ridge's brain was trying to fill in the gaps, but because of Ridge's deep-seated hatred of Bill, Ridge's mind was conjuring things to implicate Bill.\n\n\nBill theorized that Ridge would stop at nothing to keep R.J. and Brooke from Bill, including accusing Bill of something he couldn't possibly have done. Ridge cut his heated gaze away from Bill. Bill saw no other rational explanation for Ridge's delusions and concluded that the fantasies in Ridge's head wouldn't go away until Ridge let go of his hatred and accepted Brooke and Bill.\n\n\nRidge reasoned that Brooke had been buckled in, so Justin had known that the only person in danger of falling had been Ridge. Bill cited that Ridge had flown to Abu Dhabi, interrupted the wedding, punched Bill in the face, run off with Bill's bride, and arranged a helicopter getaway, but somehow, it had been Bill's fault. Bill quipped that it was flattering.\n\n\nRidge asserted that it hadn't been his helicopter, and Bill shot back that it hadn't been his, either. Katie figured that there had to be an explanation, and Bill invited them to brainstorm more about how he could have masterminded Justin turning Ridge into the high-dive champion of the world.\n\n\nBill decided that fixating on him hindered Ridge's recovery, and Ridge needed to focus on Katie and the future. Ridge claimed to be remembering, not fixating. The placating Bill suggested to the ladies that Ridge might need to talk to somebody professional. Ridge said he only needed to talk to Bill.\n\n\nBill told Ridge to go home, rest, and get his head on straight because Ridge wasn't thinking clearly. Bill asked Katie to take care of Ridge, and Bill warned Ridge not to return to him with accusations. \"I'm done,\" Bill declared.\n\n\nAfter Katie and Ridge left, Brooke felt sorry for Ridge and remarked that Bill had been unexpectedly patient with Ridge. Bill said he didn't blame the confused Ridge for wanting to think the worst of him. Bill figured Ridge wanted to prove that Bill was the bad guy because it would justify Ridge's efforts in Abu Dhabi. Bill hoped that Brooke didn't have any doubts about it. Brooke said she knew that Bill wasn't capable of doing what Ridge had accused Bill of.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Alison and Justin discussed Ridge's returning memory. Justin was worried that Ridge was starting to remember seeing Justin in the helicopter. Justin relayed that Bill wasn't worried and had instructed Justin to erase any paper trail. Alison guessed that was where she entered the picture. Justin responded that she was the best at cleaning up Bill's messes.\n\n\nJustin conveyed that he'd already shredded and deleted everything, but he wanted Alison to double-check his efforts. Alison promised that they'd make sure there was absolutely no proof that Justin had piloted the helicopter.\n\n\nAlison asked if Brooke had known about the helicopter. Justin relayed that it had been a surprise for Brooke. Alison figured hiding it would be easier than she'd thought, and she even welcomed Ridge to try to prove what had happened. She was sure everyone would think Ridge was completely bonkers.\n\n\nAlison sat down to go through the credit card purchases for the trip. She said that everything listed in the record seemed to be expected expenses, like the hotel bill and wedding costs. Justin stated that they hadn't chartered a helicopter, and he'd like to see Ridge try to prove that they had. Alison responded that no one needed to know that the Spencer helicopter had just happened to be there.\n\n\nAlison erased a file and said there would be no indication that the helicopter had ever left the Spencer yacht. She asked if Justin had deleted the flight plan. He had done so, but she double-checked to make sure there was no digital footprint of it in his emails.\n\n\nJustin thanked Alison and remarked that she probably thought he shouldn't be as worried as he was. Alison understood that if his involvement got out, it could get ugly. \"Like going to jail ugly,\" he added. She said she had bills to pay, so she wasn't about to let Justin and Bill get caught.\n\n\nJustin stated that just after he'd seen that Brooke had been strapped in, he'd heard \"cool him off\" spoken by Bill through the headset. Justin claimed that Bill had just wanted to teach Ridge a lesson and had expected Ridge to swim to shore. Justin was certain Bill never would have ordered the action if he'd known Ridge would get hurt.\n\n\nAlison called it a minor prank. She said Bill had done worse in the past, and there was no way it would take them down. Justin felt that Bill was lucky to have Alison, and she said the same about Justin. Justin guessed that \"we\" made a good duo. Alison decided to put the files back before Adele noticed that they were missing in the morning. She didn't know why Bill had kept Adele on, though. Justin joked that it was so that Katie would know that her assistant was pouring Bill's scotch.\n\n\nAlison exited, and Justin poured himself a drink. He strode with it to the window and took in the view. Slowly, he relaxed and sighed. Suddenly, a hand from behind him yanked his tie, and Ridge whipped Justin around to face him. Justin balked, but Ridge gripped the back of his neck, too. Inches from Justin's face, Ridge yelled, \"You dumped me out of that helicopter at Bill's orders! Say it!\" \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge makes a revelation to Bill, Brooke, and Katie about what happened on the day of his accident. When Bill attempts to refute any involvement, Ridge points out one particular undeniable detail that lays blame. Oliver apologizes to Aly in a way that she cannot help but forgive him. Justin works with Alison to erase any traces of evidence that lead to him being the one flying the helicopter that Ridge fell out of. Brooke is torn about whom to believe: Ridge or Bill.",
    "tvmega_recap": "In Brooke's living room, Ridge tells Bill that he did this. Bill answers that he is a powerful man, capable of a lot of things but controlling a helicopter from the ground is not one of them. Ridge says he saw what he saw. He knows Justin was the pilot and Bill ordered it. Bill follows that he knows Ridge is lost and confused and is looking for answers, but he is not going to find them here. Alison and Justin discuss the matter if Ridge is starting to remember. She thinks it is doubtful. Justin says Bill is not worried but he wants them to clean up any paper trail. Justin says that is what she does best. She says with no evidence and nothing to back him up everyone will think Ridge has gone completely bonkers. Bill continues his theory that if Ridge had simply texted or e-mailed them the selfie and not flown half way around the world none of this would have happened. Now he is feeling guilty and all confused. Everyone knows Ridge hates Bill and does not want him with Brooke so he could have full on amnesia and know that deep inside. So these images of Justin and the chopper is just manifestations of just how much Ridge despises him. And now he is accusing Bill of something he could not possibly have done. Bill says Ridge is not lying. He believes Ridge actually believes what he is saying about his memories but they are fake. He advises Ridge to accept that Brooke is happy with him. Then and only then will these fantasies go away. He is not being condescending; he is only trying to help him get to the truth. But he says he did not try to kill Ridge. And if he wants to fixate on him and Justin that will only get in the way of his recovery. He should be focusing on his future with Katie. He turns to Brooke and says this guy needs to see somebody professionally. Ridge says he is fine. Bill tells him to go home, get some rest and get his head on straight. He adds don't come at him again with these accusations; he is done! Aly tells Oliver that he could have bought a ticket. It would have been easier than being in the show. He said he had to get her attention. She says he has it now. He says she can believe in him again and he will prove it. He will take on every knight in this kingdom until she believes it. Aly hugs him and says she forgives him, but he must promise her to always tell the truth, even if he thinks she will not like it. Aly says they are still friends. Oliver admits he screwed up but he's cared about her from day one. Aly realizes she has lost her carnation; good thing GhostDarla is over Oliver's shoulder and hands him one behind his back. He proceeds to present it to Aly who beams. Brooke says Ridge was weird and he was so convinced that Bill was behind this. Bill says he's confused and in pain so he really can't blame him. He almost died so his brain is working overtime to justify all he did in Abu Dhabi. She says she knows Bill is not capable of doing what Ridge said so she does not believe that at all. Justin tells Alison that Bill is lucky to have her. She says it was a dumb prank and Bill has done worse so he is not going down. They make fun of Adele, Katie's assistant, who was kept on but got a demotion by now pouring Bill's Scotch. Justin pours himself a Scotch and stands before the window looking at the view, feeling pretty proud of himself. Suddenly Ridge grabs him by both hands behind his back by the collar. He says Justin dumped him in the water due to Bill's orders and he wants him to say it.",
