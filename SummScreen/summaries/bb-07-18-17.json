Liam walked into the foyer, and he was carrying a gun. Quinn screamed.\n\n\nLiam told Quinn he had returned to the mansion to return the gun. He reminded her that Steffy had taken it because Quinn had said that Sheila had a gun. Quinn begged Liam to tell her where Eric was or if Steffy had spoken to him. \"Is he okay,\" she asked.\n\n\nLiam played dumb and guessed that Eric was angry, but he wondered what Eric was so angry about. Quinn wondered how she was going to fix her marriage if her husband wasn't willing to see her. Quinn lamented that she had messed up, and she was sure the family felt she deserved to lose Eric because she had hurt so many people. She insisted she would not allow Eric to disappear from her life. Liam wondered if she had done something to drive him away.\n\n\nLiam added that Steffy would find out what had happened because she was meeting with Ridge. He noted that Steffy was concerned and would learn what had happened. Quinn looked nervous.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Ridge met, and Steffy demanded to know what had happened that had made Eric so angry at Ridge. \"Is it you and Quinn? Tell me I'm wrong,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nRidge looked sheepish, and he didn't deny it. \"What the hell is going on?\" she asked. Steffy noted that her grandfather was not speaking to Quinn or Ridge. \"Is it because of you? Are you the reason Granddad left? Did something happen between you and Quinn?\" she asked.\n\n\nRidge answered that he was the reason. He said he shouldn't have lied to her grandfather, and he wouldn't lie to her. Steffy guessed that he'd had an affair with Quinn. Ridge said it wasn't an affair, just a few reckless and stupid kisses. Steffy reminded him that it had been with his father's wife.\n\n\nSteffy shook her head. She wondered what had happened because Ridge had despised Quinn.\n\n\nRidge said he hadn't known Quinn very well. He regretted that he had kept the secret so long. Steffy felt for her grandfather because he loved Quinn and Ridge so much. \"How could you do that?\" Steffy asked. She didn't wait for an answer. She accused Ridge of losing control. She added that it had been the same thing his entire life. She guessed that Brooke had known, and that was the reason she had canceled the wedding.\n\n\nRidge agreed it was the reason Brooke had called off the wedding. Steffy said that he had hurt the people he loved the most. Steffy wondered what had made him change his mind from hating Quinn, and Ridge answered that he had misjudged her.\n\n\nSteffy wondered if Ridge had been mad at Eric for making her CEO. Ridge said he had no excuses and no reasons. Steffy said that Ridge was her father and her mentor; she loved him, but she didn't know what to think of him.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Caroline and her young son, Douglas, visited with Bill and Alison. Bill enjoyed playing with his great nephew. Bill reminded Caroline that Douglas was part Forrester and part Spencer. He got Douglas to give him a high-five.\n\n\nAlison took Douglas to the cafeteria for some ice cream. After they left, Bill wondered why Caroline had returned. She answered that Douglas needed his father, and she missed Thomas as well. Bill noted that Caroline was hung up on Thomas.\n\n\n\"Douglas needs his father,\" she said. She added that Thomas had visited New York, but she hadn't been ready to be a family at the time. \"I blew it,\" she said. Caroline lamented that Thomas had moved on with Sally.\n\n\nBill told Caroline not to worry about Sally. He felt she was a passing fancy. Caroline noted that Thomas obviously cared about her. Bill maintained that the idiotic fashion show Spectra had planned with Forrester was a distraction to Thomas. Bill worried that Thomas had been playing champion and savior at Spectra, and he had partnered with Sally. Bill didn't want Caroline to let Sally stand in her way. He felt Sally didn't have a chance against Caroline. She thanked him for offering to help her.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Thomas finished a design and said that nothing Forrester could design would compete with Spectra designs in Monte Carlo. Sally worried that it was crazy to agree to a fashion duel with Forrester at the Spencer Summit. Thomas wondered if she lacked confidence, but Sally said she felt they would win if it were a fair fight. She worried that Spencer would sabotage them, especially in enemy territory.\n\n\nThomas told her they would get more attention at the summit, and he planned to put Spectra on the map. They kissed. Sally worried about Caroline, and Thomas said she would always be in his life, but there was only one woman he returned home to at night. They kissed and smiled.\n\n\nLater, Bill entered Thomas' office and told him he was throwing his life away at Spectra. Bill warned that the Spencer Summit would be a big stage. Thomas said Spectra would be ready.\n\n\nBill advised that Thomas belonged with Caroline and Douglas. He needed to take care of his family. Bill made fun of everything Thomas had done and said Sally had been a distraction, and Thomas needed to get back together with Caroline. Thomas glared at Bill.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Ridge to tell her that she is crazy .it couldn't be him and Quinn. He says he will not lie to her. It was not an affair, just a few kisses. She is outraged. A few kisses with his father's wife is enough. Ridge says it is over. She says still he betrayed his dad and she does not know how he did that. Caroline drops in on her Uncle Bill. He says he is never too busy for her or her son. He says he knows his last name is Forrester but he has Spencer blood and that is what counts. Bill says he knows Douglas is not the only one missing Thomas. He knows she is still in love with the guy. Caroline admits she blew it. Thomas came to New York and she had a chance to get her family back together but she stayed with her moms. Now she thinks she made a mistake and Thomas is now with Sally and they seem serious. Thomas and Sally confer on the fashion show in Monte Carlo. She says she knows they can go toe to toe in a fair fight but with Bill Spencer on the other side, she is not so sure. He says nothing gets more attention that competition with Forrester Creations. Now they will see a whole new Sally Spectra as he will be right there all the way. Quinn walks into her home and is scared to death by Liam walking around. She asks if he knows where Sheila is. She knows Sheila will be with Eric and if he knows something he has to tell her. Bill laments to Caroline that if she needs his help then she has it. Caroline says she does not want her only involvement to be over a computer screen. She and Douglas need Thomas in their lives daily. But it will not be easy as there is Sally. Bill says Sally does not stand a freaking chance when it comes to her. Sally reminds Thomas that Douglas will always be his son so Caroline will always be there in his life. He says yes he knows, she is an awesome mom and woman but not the woman that he wants now. Quinn begs Liam to tell her anything, she has to find her husband. She knows Liam thinks she caused so many pain and does not deserve Eric but she cannot just stand there and do nothing. She has to do something. Steffy is in distress and says it has been this way all her life with Ridge screwing up. He says he has no more excuses for being stupid with so much on the line. He lost Brooke. And now he has lost his father. He hurts the people they love the most. Bill saunters into Spectra. Thomas states he will have to wait for an exclusive like everyone else. Bill says no he is just checking out his building to which Thomas says it is not his yet. Bill retorts that he is small time and he cannot think otherwise. Thomas says he is not going to let Sally down. Bill says that is what he does, sketching and disappointing. He is trying to show the world how big he is instead of being a good dad. Now it must be in the genes but this little walk with Sally will not cut it. He has responsibility and it is about time he shucks Sally and put it where it belongs, in the garbage. Steffy tells Ridge she does not understand. She thought he hated Quinn as much as she does. He says it started that way but he misjudged her. She loves Eric and does not want to lose him. Steffy says she does not blame Eric for taking off. It's the way Ridge treated her mother her whole life. He is a great dad and designer but his love life sucks. She laments she fought against that relationship between Eric and Quinn but she never thought Ridge would be the cause of Eric's pain.",
