He believed that the family could get through it if they got the psycho out of the way. Brooke assumed he meant Sheila. Ridge believed that they had to get rid of Sheila, who was a danger to Eric and the whole family.\n\n\nBrooke couldn't even believe Sheila was back or that Sheila was the only one who knew where Eric was. Ridge stated that Eric was vulnerable. Brooke hoped Eric wasn't with Sheila at that moment. Ridge tried to contact Eric, but Eric wouldn't respond to the text message.\n\n\nBrooke asked Ridge how upset Eric was with her. Ridge said Eric was upset with everyone, but Brooke didn't want a sugarcoating. She'd rather know what she was in for. Ridge conveyed that Eric was upset that Brooke had known but hadn't told him. She said she hadn't wanted Eric to be unnecessarily hurt, and Quinn and Ridge had assured Brooke that they hadn't crossed a line and that it had been over.\n\n\nRidge stated that those things were true. He wished he and Quinn had gone to Eric sooner. Brooke noted that Sheila had gone to Eric first, and Sheila was the only person Eric trusted. \"And that is incredibly terrifying,\" Brooke concluded. Ridge vowed not to let \"that psycho\" take advantage of his father. Ridge said he'd try everything he could, but he wouldn't just leave Eric with Sheila.\n\n\nIn the evening at the mansion, Steffy was upset that Quinn wanted her to overlook what Quinn and Ridge had done. Quinn asked Steffy not to overlook it, but to rise above it. Quinn couldn't undo what she'd done, and all she felt she could do was beg for Steffy's forgiveness. She promised that Steffy wouldn't regret it if Steffy chose to support Quinn and Eric.\n\n\nJust then, Wyatt arrived and asked what was going on. Quinn claimed it was nothing. Needing to run something by Eric, Wyatt asked where Eric was. Steffy bit out that Eric didn't live there anymore. \"I'm sorry -- what?\" Wyatt asked. Steffy said to talk to his mother, and she left.\n\n\nWyatt asked Quinn what Steffy had been talking about. Quinn believed that with love, they could get through anything. Wyatt asked what the \"current anything\" was. He'd thought things had been good between Quinn and Eric. Quinn said they had been. Wyatt asked why she was so upset. She said the part of her that couldn't be truly happy had reared its ugly head again.\n\n\n\"And did what?\" Wyatt asked. Quinn said she'd ruined everything, but she wouldn't take it lying down. She wondered what kind of a monster she was. Still not understanding what had gone on, Wyatt advised Quinn to go to Eric and force a conversation. Quinn said she'd do it; however, she didn't know where Eric was, and that was what scared her the most.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Eric had just gone for a drive. Quinn revealed that Eric had taken clothes and accessories. Wyatt asked what had happened to drive Eric from his own home.\n\n\nJust then, Ridge arrived. Wyatt said he'd just learned about Eric and asked if Ridge knew where Eric was. When Ridge said he didn't, Wyatt exclaimed that it had to have been some fight. Wyatt felt an obligation, separate from his mother, to be there and help with Eric because Eric had been accepting of Wyatt. Quinn said they had to find Eric first.\n\n\nRidge was sure they would find Eric and talk to him, and everything would be normal. Wyatt asked if Ridge knew what had happened. Ridge replied that he knew what went on between married people, which was that they fought and then they fixed it.\n\n\nQuinn told Wyatt to go because there wasn't anything to do, and she wasn't good company. Ridge said he'd be there in case Quinn needed something. Wyatt left, and Quinn asked Ridge where her husband was. She felt as if her husband was slipping away from her, but she refused to lose him.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Sheila administered Eric's medication to him. She wanted to make sure he was all right. He took the pills and rasped, \"There. I'm all right.\" Sheila hated to see him feeling so hurt and betrayed. Caressing his hand, she said he was the last person who deserved it.\n\n\nSheila was expecting the Forresters to burst through the door at any moment. Eric stated that his granddaughter was a woman of her word and wouldn't reveal where he was. He strode to the door, opened it, and said he just wanted to be by himself. Sheila conveyed that she was just down the hall if he needed her.\n\n\nAs Sheila walked to her room next door, she heard the elevator around the corner. She ducked into her room, and Steffy walked down the corridor that faced Sheila's door. Steffy turned left at Sheila's door and continued to the next door, which was Eric's. Sheila peeked out of her room as Steffy knocked on Eric's door.\n\n\nEric let Steffy into his room. Inside, she hoped it was okay that she'd returned. She'd been worried about him. The two hugged. Eric asked if she'd talked to her father. Affirming it, she added that she hadn't told Ridge that she'd talked to Eric or where to find Eric. Eric thanked her for it. Steffy said she'd do anything for him, but she didn't think he should be staying in that place alone.\n\n\nEric didn't want to face anyone or answer any questions. He didn't even have his own answers. He recalled that he'd been happy about Ridge and Quinn's closeness and had encouraged it. He couldn't imagine what they'd been whispering behind his back. Steffy didn't think they'd been laughing, and she revealed that the two were pretty tortured.\n\n\nEric asked if Steffy had seen Quinn. Affirming it, Steffy wasn't sure if she should tell Eric about what a wreck Quinn was, but Steffy stated that Quinn felt horrible. Steffy stated that Quinn loved Eric and had never stopped. Eric thought of the vows he'd made and hissed that Ridge was his son. Steffy said she wasn't defending anyone, but she needed to be open-minded and fair, something she hadn't been in the past. She'd heard how remorseful Quinn and Ridge were, but she believed that only Eric could decide if it was too late or not.\n\n\nEric said his life had changed. He needed time to think of what was next. Steffy stated that she'd fought the relationship, but she'd begun to think Quinn had been good for him. Steffy didn't know what to think anymore, but she could see that, despite everything, Eric still loved Quinn.\n\n\nAs Steffy prepared to leave, Eric thanked her for her discretion. Steffy said that she needed something in return. She asked him not to let Sheila back in. Steffy believed that he knew better than anyone how dangerous Sheila was, and Steffy urged him not to gloss over all Sheila had done just because she was there for Eric in the moment.\n\n\nSteffy asserted that Sheila had an agenda, just as always. Steffy promised not to tell the family where Eric was, but she asked him to keep Sheila away.\n\n\nBack in Sheila's room, Sheila flashed back to marrying Eric. She looked out her peephole and saw Steffy headed back to the elevator. She waited for the chimes indicating that Steffy had gone on the elevator then she slipped into the hallway to head to Eric's door.\n\n\nEric let Sheila in, and she asked if she'd just heard Steffy. Eric affirmed it. Sheila remarked that it had to be nice to see family, and he had to miss them. He stated that Steffy had told him not to be around Sheila. Claiming to understand, Sheila offered to leave. She said it was \"just so hard\" because he seemed to need at least one supportive and loyal person to talk to.\n\n\nEric questioned whether anyone had ever been loyal to him. Understanding that it seemed that way, she believed there was a person, and he'd figure out who it was. He asked her what the standard for loyalty was. Sheila replied that it would be someone who'd tell the truth even if it hurt. Eric stated that she'd done nothing but tell him the truth ever since she'd been back.\n\n\nSheila wondered if she could ask for one small thing in return. Eric asked what it was, and she kissed him.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn says if Steffy could forgive her and Ridge, they never meant to hurt Eric. She would take back every single second that she spent with Ridge if she could. All she can do is stand before her raw now and beg her to forgive her. If Steffy can just give her that chance to make it up to her she will never forget it, she promises. Wyatt walks in and wants to know what is going on. He needs to see Eric. Steffy says he does not live here anymore; just ask his mother. Ridge tells Brooke that this thing with Quinn has lost him his dad but he will not lose his daughter too. They have to get rid of this Sheila. She's a danger to his dad and the entire family. Sheila gives Eric his meds with a full glass of water as he needs and tells him to lie back and rest. He's had a big disappointment by those he thought he could trust. He deserves more than that. Eric says his granddaughter is a woman of her word and she will keep his hiding place a secret. He is grateful for Sheila's concern but he'd like to be alone now. Almost on her heels of Sheila leaving, Steffy comes back to Eric's door, saying she could not stay away. Wyatt says he thought things were good between Quinn and Eric, so what happened? Quinn says she loves Eric and she is not going to take this lying down and she will not give up this easy. He says she and Eric need to sit down and have a good talk. She says she would but this is what scares her the most. She does not know where he is now. Brooke sees the problem. Ridge says it is over with Quinn but Sheila got to Eric before they could tell him their side and that whatever they had was over. Ridge says they have to get rid of Sheila. Eric thanks Steffy for keeping her word and not telling anyone. He still does not want to see anybody or explain as he does not understand it himself. He was happy when Ridge and Quinn were getting close. He encouraged it but he can only imagine their conversations. Steffy tells him that Quinn is right. She never stopped loving him and still does. Wyatt wonders why Eric would just take off like that. It must have been a hell of a fight. Ridge comes back and Wyatt says he wants to be there for her. Ridge says they need to find out where Eric is and get him to come home and they can fix all of this. Sheila thinks of her wedding day to Eric. Steffy says she is not defending Ridge or Quinn, what they did was awful. But she knows they are remorseful and she hopes it is not too late. Eric opines that he needs more time to think what to do next. Steffy says she understands. She started off thinking Quinn was wrong for him and she understands him wanting to kick her to the curb, but she feels he is still in love with her and is just hurt now. Ridge tells Quinn that they need to stay calm. She says she can't. Every minute her husband is slipping away and she cannot stop it. Eric tells Steffy goodbye and thanks her for keeping his secret. She says she needs something from him. Do not forget what Sheila has done to him in the past and she is still trying to do it. Keep her away. Sheila, just down the hall, sees Steffy leave and goes directly to Eric's room. She asks if she can come in and he lets her. She says it must be nice to see his granddaughter. He says yes but she does not want him anywhere near Sheila. She says okay but she thinks he could use at least one person other than family for him to talk to. He needs someone who will tell him the truth even if it hurts. He says he knows she has told him the truth since she came back. She asks if she can ask one small favor of him. He grants it. She leans in and kisses him and smiles when he seems to enjoy it and does not kick her out.",
