Aly watched from a distance, and the visions of Darla, Aly's mom, changing her tire the night that Taylor hit her appeared on the screen.\n\n\nAly heard the voice of Darla, and Darla encouraged Aly to run into Steffy. Aly shouted that she had to save the whole Forrester family. Aly started the car and sped toward Steffy, who screamed as the car headlights blinded her.\n\n\nAly stopped before she hit Steffy, and Steffy screamed at Aly. \"What the hell are you doing? Get out of the car,\" Steffy ordered. Aly remained seated in the car. Steffy dragged Aly out of her car.\n\n\n\"What are you doing? You could have killed me!\" Steffy shouted. Aly looked crazy, and she called Steffy disgusting. Steffy acknowledged that 100,000 things disgusted Aly, and Aly looked angry.\n\n\nSteffy realized Aly had been following her and had punctured the tire. \"You did this,\" Steffy said. Aly sneered at Steffy. \"You wanted to reenact the night your mother died,\" Steffy said. \"Your mother killed my mother,\" Aly seethed. Aly accused Steffy's mother of stealing Aly's mother and ruining her life. \"Thou shalt not steal,\" Aly shouted. \"How about thou shalt not kill?\" Steffy countered. Steffy and Aly argued. Steffy said Aly had tried to kill her.\n\n\nSteffy understood that Aly didn't like Steffy and Maya or the way they dressed, but Steffy said Aly couldn't decide what was right for everyone. It wasn't up to Aly to tell others they had to do what Aly wanted.\n\n\nAly argued that her mother was a saint, but Steffy said no one was perfect. Aly freaked out, and Steffy said they could not change the past, but they had to accept it and move on. \"You gotta let this go,\" Steffy begged.\n\n\nAly shook her head and sobbed, and Steffy hugged her. Aly said that she had spent most of her life without a physical mother because of Taylor. She added that Forrester had lost its way, and Aly felt all alone. \"You're not alone,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nAly pushed Steffy away. Aly picked up the tire iron and swung it at Steffy. Steffy backed away, but Aly looked crazy and moved toward her. Steffy begged Aly to put down the tire iron, but Aly looked determined.\n\n\nIn the Forrester mansion living room, Nicole flashed back to good times with Zende. He entered, and they flirted. They wondered where everyone had gone because the party had started down by the pool. Nicole expected the entire family to celebrate.\n\n\nMaya and Rick entered, and Nicole teased that Rick and Maya had missed the standing ovation at the party, but everyone had moved down by the pool. Rick, Maya, Zende, and Nicole relived the success of the fashion show. Nicole noted that their father had changed his mind about Maya.\n\n\nNicole and Maya agreed that they'd never thought they would have their family back together again. Rick and Maya asked where all the Forresters had gone. Nicole said that Ridge and Caroline had gone home, and no one had seen Steffy. Rick said Steffy never missed a party.\n\n\nNicole added that Wyatt, Ivy, and Liam had gone upstairs to find Aly. Maya made martinis while Zende and Nicole talked. Rick flashed back to his speech at the fashion show in which he had told the crowd how much Maya had inspired him. He smiled at the memory of his proposal. Maya delivered the martinis.\n\n\nUpstairs at the Forrester mansion, Ivy, Wyatt, and Liam worried about Aly and Steffy. Liam tried to call Steffy again. Wyatt warned that Aly clearly had deep-seated hatred for Maya and Steffy. He said it went way beyond a disagreement with Rick, Maya, or Steffy. Wyatt and Liam agreed Aly needed professional help.\n\n\nIvy defended Aly as having problems that they could help her with, but Liam said she clearly needed a professional. Wyatt, Liam, and Ivy joined Rick, Maya, Zende, and Nicole in the living room. They discussed the problems with Aly, and they showed Rick and Maya the pictures that had been in Aly's closet.\n\n\nRick said that Thorne was on his way home to see Aly, but they were unsure of his flight number. Ivy insisted she had to find Aly. Ivy knew that Aly often went to her dad's old office at Forrester, but Rick noted that security would have seen her.\n\n\nIvy suggested the old beach house or the nearby highway where Darla had been killed. Ivy said Aly often went there to feel closer to her mother. Ivy left to find Aly.\n\n\nWyatt, Liam, Rick, Maya, Zende, and Nicole discussed the accident that had killed Darla. Zende explained that he remembered it even though he had been a kid. He remembered that Darla had had a big birthday party for Aly. After the party, Phoebe, Steffy's twin, had had a flat on the highway, and Darla had driven up to help her.\n\n\nAt the same time, Steffy and Phoebe's mom, Taylor, had also headed out to pick up Phoebe, but Taylor had been drinking. Taylor had driven along the highway, and had hit Darla, who had been trying to change Phoebe's tire. Darla had later died. Rick added that Taylor had left the scene of the accident, and no one had known who had killed Darla until much later.\n\n\nWyatt, Liam, Rick, Maya, Zende, and Nicole agreed that it had been traumatic for Aly. They all worried that they had not heard from Aly or Steffy. They hoped Ivy could find Aly.\n\n\nOn the highway, Ivy drove toward the spot where she knew she would find Aly. Ivy flashed back to much happier times with Aly during holidays. Then Ivy recalled finding the horrible poster and picture in Aly's closet.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Aly watches from her car while Steffy struggles to fix a flat on her car. She tells dark Darla that this if for her and Darla replies that she wants her to put an end to Steffy. Aly guns the car and Steffy screams as the car almost touches her. She jumps up from the ground and yells at Aly for what she is doing. She pulls Aly out of her car and says she could have killed her. Aly smiles eerily and Steffy realizes Aly put the nail in the tire and she purposely planned this to re-enact the night her mother died. Aly corrects her. Taylor killed her mother. Liam tries to contact Steffy but tells Wyatt she must be in a dead zone as she is not answering. Wyatt is checking out the collage HATE board and says this has nothing to do with a grudge abut her shoe line or morality; it is pure hate. Nicole and Zende are enjoying themselves around the pool at the Forrester's and she kids she is not even worthy of being Maya's sister as she was so amazing today. Rick is told some of the executives got bored waiting for him and left. So did Ridge. They also mention that Steffy is missing. Ivy feels badly for Aly. They are invading her room and maybe this is the only way she can cope and relax. Liam says he knows Ivy wants to be a good friend but Wyatt is right. This is a mental health emergency and they need to get in touch with Aly's therapist. Ivy says she thinks she no longer sees one since she moved back to L. A. They go downstairs and ask Rick if they are waiting for Thorne. He is the only one that might be ale to calm Aly down. Right now she only sees people as good and bad and doesn't like to think about sex. Ivy doesn't want to sit around and wait and says she knows a few places Aly might be .one being that stretch of the highway where her mom was killed. Liam asks to go but Ivy had rather go alone. Rick was living in Paris at the time but Maya pretty well knows the story and Zende fills them in on what he knew as he was at the funeral. Thorne had turned to Taylor since she was a therapist but he did not know then that she was the driver of the car that killed Darla. Aly later found out and was betrayed and it is obvious she sees that in Steffy as well. Rick would really like Wyatt and Liam to go but admits Liam knows Aly better than he does and should be there when she returns home. Aly starts talking good and bad to Steffy and claims her mother was a saint. Steffy holds her and says she is not accusing Darla of anything but she was not perfect and Aly needs to understand that. Aly jumps and says everything good and decent has been taken from her and she accuses Steffy of trying to get rid of her too. She grabs the tire iron and hits Steffy, who freaks out.",
