Bill explained that he would helicopter over to Catalina, make sure that everything was ready, and then return for Brooke. Bill claimed he would leave nothing to chance. There would be no interference and no surprises. Bill and Brooke laughed and kissed and promised to be husband and wife by nightfall.\n\n\nBill called Justin and Alison in a conference call. He advised Justin to get access to Rupert's helicopter because he wanted everything to go off without a hitch. Alison said the wedding planner and team were already in Catalina, and the copter was ready. Justin promised to have it gassed up and ready to go.\n\n\nBrooke listened and offered to help in the effort. Bill refused, but he advised that she could plan every anniversary party they would ever have. Bill encouraged Brooke to call Katie, but Brooke said that Katie would not be happy for them. Bill left.\n\n\nAt Katie's place, Katie, Ridge, and Deacon discussed that Bill's helicopter had been in Abu Dhabi on his yacht, so Bill hadn't needed to rent a helicopter. Ridge promised that Bill would not get away with lying to everyone. Katie pressured Ridge and Deacon to stop the accusations. She added that she was worried, but Bill was the father of her son. \"I'm gonna put him behind bars,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nDeacon and Ridge agreed that Bill was not going to get away with what he had done. Deacon got a call from Alison. She asked him to get together later, and Deacon teased that her boss must have given her time off. Alison shared that Bill and Brooke were getting married on Catalina Island. She added that everyone was in panic mode at Spencer, trying to make plans but keep it secret. \n\n\nDeacon and Alison hung up with plans to meet later. Deacon explained to Katie and Ridge that Bill and Brooke were getting married. Ridge insisted that he would visit the scene of the crime. He left. Deacon left to visit Brooke.\n\n\nDeacon showed up at Brooke's, and Brooke dismissed him. She said she was too busy to talk. But Deacon warned, \"You're wrong about me.\" Deacon added that Brooke was wrong about Bill Spencer, too. Brooke claimed that if Deacon had listened to Ridge, Ridge had been hurt and confused.\n\n\nDeacon begged Brooke to listen to him. He insisted that Bill was responsible for what had happened to Ridge. Brooke refused to believe him, and she told him to leave. Deacon knew she was getting married. He warned her not to do it.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt pulled the Hope for the Future diamond out of his backpack. Hope and Liam entered, and wished Wyatt good luck on his first day back at Forrester. Wyatt thanked Liam and Hope, and Wyatt and Liam teased one another about how they had protected and saved each other. Hope noted that even when they were getting along, they were competing with each other. They argued that they were not competing. Wyatt thanked Liam for his second chance at Forrester.\n\n\nLiam, Hope, and Wyatt discussed that there was a lot of potential for Ivy's jewelry line. Ivy entered and met Wyatt. Ivy shared that she was sorry to hear that his mother had experienced a difficult time. Wyatt thanked her. Liam kissed Hope goodbye, and Wyatt turned away.\n\n\nWyatt and Ivy discussed the logistics of the new jewelry program and agreed that Ivy would design, and Liam would handle the manufacturing. Hope noted that Ivy would not have her own office but could work on any drafting table she could find. Hope added that Wyatt and Quinn had done most of their work at their own facility but worked at Forrester for meetings. Ivy asked if it was awkward for Hope to work with an ex, and Hope noted that no one had trouble working with exes at Forrester, because if they did, nothing would ever get done. Ivy nodded in agreement then left.\n\n\nWyatt returned, and Hope said that Ivy and Wyatt seemed to be a good team. Hope added that she had not told Ivy any of the details about Quinn. \"I don't want any awkwardness between you two or us,\" Hope said. Wyatt said that all he had felt was gratitude for getting a second chance. He didn't want to waste a moment. \n\n\n\"Good luck,\" Hope said. She left, and Wyatt opened his backpack again. \"I got all the luck I need right here,\" Wyatt said. He pulled out the Hope for the Future diamond.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill showed up in Liam's office and announced that he was leaving for Catalina Island, where he planned to marry Brooke in a simple ceremony in a vineyard. He wanted to keep it secret with no reporters. Liam and Bill embraced, and Liam said that he was happy for his father. Bill left, and Liam sat down and daydreamed about Hope.\n\n\nAt the airport hangar, Justin entered the locker room to the helicopter area, and he waited for Bill. Justin opened a locker, and put on his flight jacket with the Spencer logo. Ridge showed up and punched Justin -- knocking Justin out.\n\n\nLater, Bill showed up at the airport, but noted that the chopper engine had started. Bill got on board and chatted that Brooke would finally be his. \"Forrester can't stop us.\" Bill said, \"I'm always in the driver's seat. He's no match for me.\"\n\n\nIn the pilot's seat of the cockpit, Ridge sat at the controls, hidden from Bill's view. He wore a hat and headphones with Justin's Spencer Publications flight jacket pulled up over his neck. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Deacon and Katie that it was Bill. Justin was flying the chopper and Bill gave him the orders to kill him. He's going to put him behind bars. Brooke asks Bill when they are leaving for Catalina. He says he is taking the helicopter over there now, make the arrangements and will come back and get her. He wants to get married today with no interferences and no surprises. Justin calls and Bill speaks with both he and Alison. He tells Justin to get over to the hanger and make sure all is ready when he hits the tarmac. Wyatt is at his desk and he pulls the box with the blue diamond out of his messenger bag. He quickly tucks it back inside when Hope and Liam come in. They welcome him back on his first day back at work. He asks Liam if he is offering him good luck. Liam says he has his support. Hope says he might be a little nervous since he now is basically alone. He pats the bag and says technically he is not alone. She asks if Quinn knows he is back. Wyatt says no. He just wants her to focus on getting better. They get around to work and he says he can't wait as there is a lot he things he can do with a talent like Ivy's. At that moment she comes in and hears this and is flattered that he likes her work. He says he has done a little research here and there. She says the same and she is sorry to hear his mother is no longer here. She hopes she will be back soon but until then she is extremely grateful for Wyatt's help with her line. Hope tells her that she is used to designing to just sell perhaps in one boutique but now her line could be seen worldwide. Wyatt says he has the facilities ad the people that can run things smoothly and he will be handling that end of things. Alison calls Deacon and says she found an opening in her schedule if he'd like to get together. He suggests the sooner the better but she needs to wait a bit and tells him her boss is getting married today. He's on the way now to the hanger to get the helicopter. Deacon tells Ridge that Brooke and Bill are getting married today. Bill is out of the house so this is his opportunity to go tell Brooke what Bill has done. Ridge says he has a better idea. He's going to the scene of the crime. Deacon shows up at Brooke's and asks if she can't put a smile on her face when she sees him. He asks if she has plans. She says she is just very busy. He says he will just cut to the chase. Whatever she is thinking about him, she is wrong. He doesn't want her to have any regrets. But she will if she doesn't get Spencer out of her life. She says she is in a hurry and she is not going to stand here and discuss this with him. He stops her from closing the door and says she is wrong about Bill too. Liam hobbles back to the office just as Bill is about to leave. He says he has been to Forrester's and Alison had told him that Bill wouldn't be in today. Bill says he's not. He is getting ready to go to Catalina. He and Brooke are getting married today. Liam is delighted and gives his old man a big hug. Bill tells him to keep this to himself; he wants it to just be him and Brooke. Ridge goes to the hanger and sees Justin as he gets out the SP jacket to put on. He turns around and Ridge sucker punches him in the face and Justin falls on the floor, out cold. Hope tells Wyatt looks like he and Ivy got off to a great start. He says yeah, he can get along with just about anybody under the right circumstances. She likes his work and he likes hers. Hope says good because she does not want there to be any awkwardness and especially between them. Wyatt says there is none. All he feels now is a big old sappy grateful attitude, big waves of it. He says he has been given a second chance and he's not going to waste another moment wishing it were different. He says he is just gonna appreciate everything around him. She wishes him good luck. When she leaves he takes the diamond out of the bag again and says he has all the luck he needs right here. Deacon tells Brooke that Bill is trying to make it look like Ridge is crazy but he is not. Brooke says Ridge is confused. He had a horrific accident but Bill was not responsible and nobody is going to prove otherwise. Bill climbs aboard the helicopter and slaps Justin on the shoulder and says take him away. Its taken a while to get here but now Forrester can't stop them. He's always in the driver's seat and Forrester was no match for him. As they take off, we see the pilot's face and it is Ridge.",
