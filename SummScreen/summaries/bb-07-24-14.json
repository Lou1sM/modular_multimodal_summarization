Ivy asked him some informed questions about her trade, and then Hope told Othello that Ivy was a jewelry crafter. He wondered if Ivy would work with Wyatt and Quinn, but Aly readily stated that the Fullers no longer worked there.\n\n\nJust then, Carter arrived with Wyatt and Wyatt's contract. Aly was shocked, and Eric revealed that Wyatt's company would produce Ivy's designs. Maya told Eric that it was a brilliant idea. Eric credited Hope and Liam with the idea. Carter and Oliver's gazes soured when Maya coquettishly said she was sure Eric had given it his stamp of approval.\n\n\nAly asked if Liam was really okay with Wyatt being there. Liam responded that he and his brother had found a new appreciation for each other. Eric stated that he'd gathered everyone to say that it was a new beginning. He felt that they all needed to work together and respect each other.\n\n\nEveryone took their seats for the meeting. Eric congratulated Hope on having two stellar quarters. Rick felt that keeping the momentum wouldn't be easy without Quinn Artisan Jewelers. Hope stated that they hadn't completely cut ties with the business because they had Wyatt. Eric believed that Ivy and Wyatt could handle it, but they had been inundated with questions and suspicions about Quinn.\n\n\nThe team discussed how they'd kept news about Quinn out of the press, and Aly asked why they hadn't cut ties with Quinn's company and Wyatt, who'd become a liability. Aly claimed not to mean any offense, but Wyatt agreed that, if his mother's behavior leaked to the press, it could cause a scandal.\n\n\nHope reasoned that they'd weathered storms before. Agreeing, Eric felt that they'd be fine. Eric said that Wyatt had proven himself, they needed him, and his company would take to Ivy's designs. \"I couldn't agree more. Good point, Eric,\" the smiling Maya stated, and Carter sneered at her.\n\n\nEric was ready to focus on redirecting the line, but Ivy didn't think rebranding was needed because the HFTF message still resonated. \"Another great point,\" Maya chimed in. Oliver rolled his eyes, and Carter's nostrils flared. Rick and Carter remarked that they needed another great marketing campaign like the diamond, and Wyatt expressed confidence that they'd have that kind of success again.\n\n\nEric asked if Ridge had signed off on Wyatt's contract, and Rick asked where Ridge and Brooke were.\n\n\nAfter the meeting, Hope and Liam were alone in Eric's office. Liam remarked that Aly had had a good point. Hope agreed but figured they'd have to deal with a scandal whether Wyatt worked there or not. Hope expressed pride in Liam for standing by his brother. He laughed and said that it had been the way he'd pictured it would be. \"And all it took was mutual trust,\" Liam added.\n\n\nLiam and Hope moved on to discussing Ivy, who they agreed fit in well. Liam noted that Wyatt seemed to have big plans for HFTF and asked if Hope knew about them. Hope had no idea, and Liam wondered what Wyatt was up to.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Wyatt and Ivy looked over Quinn's jewelry, and Wyatt thanked her for being kind about Quinn. Ivy said that designers were entitled to be a little wacky. Ivy thought Wyatt was wacky, too, and she joked with him about \"swashbuckling\" with Hope, Ricardo, and the diamond.\n\n\nIvy had heard about Ricardo's death and wondered what would become of the diamond. Wyatt asked her what she'd do with it. Ivy imagined doing a blue line with different, sparkly hues of blue. She was inspired at what she, Hope, and Wyatt could do. Wyatt asked if she could keep a secret. She agreed to it, and he pulled out a large jewelry box. Opening it, he presented the HFTF diamond, and Ivy gasped.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Katie arrived at Brooke's request. Katie saw a garment bag and asked if Brooke was going on a trip. Brooke announced that she and Bill were getting married in Catalina that day. Feeling that the wedding was sudden, Katie asked if it had been planned and whose idea it had been. Brooke said Bill had sprung it on her, and she would have told Katie if she'd known any sooner.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Katie was okay with it. Katie said that the only reservation she had was that she didn't believe that Bill was the man who Brooke thought he was. Brooke threw up her hands and insisted that the speculation about Bill was just a wild conspiracy theory.\n\n\nKatie insinuated that Bill had been rushing Brooke to the altar ever since Ridge had started suspecting Bill. Brooke warned Katie not to become obsessive. Katie claimed not to want to believe something like that about the father of her child. Brooke felt that Katie shouldn't believe it because Bill wasn't a killer. Katie offered to reason with Ridge if Brooke would postpone the wedding.\n\n\nBrooke wouldn't hear of it and said Ridge was the reason she wasn't already married. Katie asked what reason there could be that the helicopter had banked, sending Ridge out the door. Brooke assumed that a reason existed because it had happened. Katie questioned the weather conditions at the time of the incident or if the pilot had even warned his passengers to buckle their seatbelts.\n\n\nBrooke said that Justin piloting the helicopter was too far-fetched, but to Katie, it wasn't any more so than Ridge falling out of it. Katie insisted that Brooke hold off on the wedding for a few days, so they could sort things out, but Brooke said Bill didn't want to keep waiting. Katie remarked that his persistence was a red flag. Brooke claimed that she didn't want to wait, either.\n\n\nKatie decided that Brooke didn't know Bill like Katie did, and he'd do anything to get what he wanted. \"Including murder?\" Brooke dubiously asked. Katie flashed back a knowing stare. Brooke was done with the wild speculation and declared that she was marrying Bill that day. Katie warned that if Ridge was right, Brooke would be married to a man who'd done the unthinkable.\n\n\nBrooke denied that Bill had had anything to do with the incident, but Katie said Brooke didn't know that. Katie insisted that Bill was capable of anything, and if Brooke didn't see that, then she was marrying a man she didn't know. Brooke stated that Bill had changed since he'd been with Katie. Katie laughed, but Brooke said it was too late because Bill was already making arrangements.\n\n\nKatie maintained that Brooke needed to know what she was getting herself into by being Bill's wife. Brooke claimed to know. She said that Bill could be extreme, but not with something \"like this.\" Katie theorized that Bill wanted Ridge to pay for breaking up the wedding. Brooke thought it was inane that Bill would want Ridge's life as payment. Brooke declared that she'd be Mrs. Bill Spencer by the day's end, and there was nothing Katie could do to stop it.\n\n\nAt the hangar, Alison discovered Justin in the locker room, straining to get to his feet. Startled, she asked what had happened, and he said Ridge had attacked him. Justin didn't know where Ridge or Bill was, but upon noticing that his flight jacket was gone, Justin asked Alison if she'd seen a helicopter.\n\n\nIn the helicopter, Bill put his phone away, stating that there would be no wedding crashers that time. He felt around the cabin and asked where his seatbelt was. \"You looking for this?\" Ridge asked, holding up a strap. Bill seemed surprised, and then he scowled. Ridge looked over his shoulder and said Bill had believed that Ridge had only studied poetry while in Paris.\n\n\nTalking through his headset, Bill ordered Ridge to land, and Ridge noted that the \"Stallion\" was nervous. Bill demanded that Ridge return to the hangar, but instead, Ridge increased the elevation. Bill asked what Ridge wanted, and Ridge ordered Bill to admit to instructing Justin to dump Ridge from the helicopter in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\nBill told Ridge to go to hell, and Ridge banked the helicopter, jolting Bill back against the cabin wall. As Ridge tossed the helicopter to and fro in the air, Bill steadfastly denied culpability. Ridge banked hard, and Bill clutched the window frame, straining to keep from falling out the open window.\n\n\nRidge claimed that air traffic control in Abu Dhabi would soon confirm what he already knew, so he said Bill might as well admit it. Bill said nothing, so Ridge tipped the chopper more, and alarms began chiming. \"Yeah, you bet I did,\" Bill bitterly admitted, demanding, \"Now put my chopper down, and I'll tell Brooke.\" Ridge leveled out the helicopter, and Bill was snarling mad in the backseat. \n\n\n",

In order to get Bill to confess to his transgressions in Abu Dhabi, Ridge gives him a taste of his own medicine. Thoughts and emotions regarding Wyatt\u2019s return to Forrester Creations are mixed and vocalized at a company meeting. Wyatt reveals a secret to Ivy that concerns Hope and HFTF.",
    "tvmega_recap": "As Bill gets settled in the chopper, he makes a list on his Iphone to get to Catalina, set up and go back ad get Brooke. And the best part, no Smidge this time to screw things up. Forrester, what a joke, no wedding crashers this time. He looks for his seat belt, there is none. The pilot holds it up and asks if he is looking for this. Ridge turns his head around and says guess Bill thought the only thing he studied in Paris was poetry. Katie arrives at Brooke's and asks what was the big urgency. Brooke says Deacon was over and badmouthing Bill and she needed a break. She tells Katie that she and Bill are going to Catalina and getting married today. She wanted her to hear it from her first. Katie says this is kind of sudden and wonders if it was Bill's idea or Brooke's. Brooke says Bill sprung it on her but it is something they have been talking about. Katie says she wants Brooke to be happy but she isn't sure that Bill is who she thinks he is. Doesn't she wonder why he is rushing into this now that Ridge is getting better and closing in on the truth. Brooke offers that Katie is being obsessive and that can be dangerous. Ridge is not well and Katie knows that. Bill is not a killer. Katie says okay. She will talk to Ridge but Brooke has to do one thing for her \u0096 put off the wedding at least for today. Just for a day or two until they can sort this out. Brooke says no, there is nothing to sort out. They would be married right now if it weren't for Ridge. She knows Ridge thinks that Justin was piloting the chopper but that is too farfetched. Katie says no more so than Ridge falling out of the helicopter. If they are not running off to get married, then one or two more days won't hurt. Brooke reminds her that Bill doesn't want to wait. Katie thinks that is a big red flag. She says Brooke thinks she knows Bill but perhaps she doesn't. He is capable of many things, maybe even murder. Brooke says this is all wild speculation and she is not going to be part of it. She is marrying Bill today. He had nothing to do with Ridge's accident. Katie says Bill broke Deacon out of prison so he could go to Italy and ruin Hope's wedding so he's capable of many things. If she doesn't believe that then she doesn't now the man she is marrying. Brooke says Katie is too late. Bill is already on his way to Catalina to make arrangements. He's the man she loves and he has changed since he has been with Katie. At a quick meeting at FC, Hope introduces Ivy to Othello, their director of music. Carter joins and says he is late because they got hung up on Wyatt's new contract. Surprised, Aly asks if Wyatt is coming back to work. Eric speaks up and says Wyatt's company will be producing Ivy's jewelry designs for HFTF. Maya tells Eric that is a great choice. Aly asks Liam if he is fine with this. He stammers that he and his brother have found a new appreciation for each other. Wyatt adds that Hope and her family have been kind enough to give him another chance. Eric says they should all be grateful and that is why he wanted to see them all today .they've been through a rough patch with Ridge's accident, Liam's near tragedy and other developments he is aware of. He thinks this calls for a new beginning. They are a team here. He wants all of them to work as a team and that means supporting each other and more importantly respecting each other. They all agree. Eric says they had two stellar quarters but the challenge will be to keep the momentum going. He has every confidence that Wyatt and Ivy will fill that gap that Quinn left. But make no mistake, there is a gap and he is getting more and more phone calls about Quinn. He asks Wyatt how she is .and to know that none of this is his fault. Wyatt says she is getting the help she needs. Rick says it is still a problem and Carter adds they have kept it in the house but there is no guarantee that it will stay that way. Eric reminds them that if it gets out it could hurt the line. Maya adds and that will only make Ivy and Wyatt's job more difficult. Aly adds this is not going to be a popular opinion but shouldn't they be cutting all ties with QAJ including Wyatt. That would make the most business sense. She tells Wyatt that it is nothing personal but he has to know he is a liability to the company. Wyatt admits that if this goes public it could cause a scandal. Hope says they have weathered those before. Eric says yes they have and they need Wyatt. He has proven himself and he is sure that he and Ivy will make a good team. Maya says good point and she could not agree more. Eric says they need to move on and refocus. Rick says more than ever they need a great marketing angle. Carter says like the HFTF diamond, that was huge. Wyatt says he is confident they can get that success again. Eric asks Carter if Ridge has signed off on Wyatt's contract. Carter says no, he is not in the building. All are aware that neither Ridge nor Brooke are there. Bill tells Ridge to get his chopper back on the ground. Ridge asks the \"stallion\" if he is nervous. Bill says yes he is. He is sorry that Ridge spent more time at his parades with Fabrice than he did with brushing up on his Helicopter 101, so get the chopper back in the hangar. Ridge says not in the flight plan. Every time Bill says that, Ridge pushes the throttle to make the chopper recklessly go up and back, around and around. Bill tells him that he is crazy. Ridge says all he wants is for Bill to admit that he gave the orders to dump him in the water. Bill tells him to go to hell. And to put this chopper down before he kills both of them. Ridge gives him another jolt and says Billy is trying his patient; just admit it was Justin taking his orders. Liam tells Hope that Aly made a lot of sense and she was not saying it out of anger. Hope says she knows. They will have to deal with Quinn whether Wyatt works there or not. She says she is proud the way he stood up for Wyatt. He says he knows; it was the way he always pictureed it and all it took was mutual trust. She says now that Quinn is out of the picture they can build on that. And he agrees that Wyatt and Ivy will make a good team. It seems he has some really big ideas and wonders if he has said anything to Hope. Hope relies no and Liam wonders what he is up to. Wyatt and Ivy look over some jewelry and she says she hopes she can accomplish just half of what his mother did here. He says she will and hopefully without all the drama. He thanks her for the nice things she said about Quinn. Ivy says Quinn was an artist and all of them are entitled to be a little wacky. He says she is being very kind. She says he has a little bit of that in him too like running off to Mexico with Hope and then getting Ricardo to lend him the blue diamond .very swashbuckling. She says she heard about Ricardo's death and wonders what will happen to the diamond now. Wyatt asks what she would do it with it if it were hers. She says they would come up with something amazing. She'd work this whole blue line .working with sapphires, topaz and aquamarine. Then he could work his magic on Hope and get her to go blue for a couple of collections. He thinks it over and asks if she can keep a secret. She says yeah. He retrieves the diamond and says for her eyes only for the moment .the HFTF diamond. Alison finds Justin on the floor just as he starts to get up. He says he was decked by Ridge Forrester. Katie tells Brooke that she can stop Bill. She can call him with some of excuse that he is not feeling well. Brooke tells her to stop this. There is no reason to postpone the wedding. Sometimes Bill goes to extremes but nothing like what Katie is trying to say. Katie says she does not want to believe it either but she knows his history. She saw the lengths he would go to get her to Abu Dhabi in the first place. And once he got her there, he was not going to let her slip through his fingers. Nothing or no one was going to stop that wedding. But Ridge did so he wanted payback for that. After making a few more attempts of rocking the helicopter with Bill holding on for dear life, Ridge says Brooke is gonna know the truth so shall he tell her or will Bill. Bill finally says yeah he did it; you bet he did. So put this chopper down and he will tell Brooke.",
