Thomas wondered how it could be possible.\n\n\nBill answered that Caroline had a rare autoimmune disease. He added that she had been to every specialist in the world and that she was adamant that no one find out about her condition. Bill encouraged Thomas to stay close to Caroline and Douglas so they would always have memories because family was important.\n\n\nBill told Thomas that he didn't want Caroline to know he had betrayed her trust, but it was important for Thomas to know so he could quit wasting time with Sally Spectra and at Spectra. He needed to return to his family and Forrester.\n\n\nBill maintained that Thomas should have gone to New York to be with Caroline earlier, but Thomas angrily replied that he had gone to New York, and Caroline had said she hadn't known what she'd wanted. Bill said it was time for Thomas to return to New York to be with Caroline and Douglas because Thomas had to fulfill his obligation to his son and Caroline. \"Make happy, lasting, loving memories for Douglas to cherish long after his mother is gone. Only you can do that,\" Bill said.\n\n\nThomas was emotional. Bill warned that Thomas had previously abandoned his family. \"Not true. Damn it, Bill, I wanted a family with Caroline and my son, but she left me for New York,\" Thomas said. He lamented that the mother of his child was dying. Bill asked if he was still in love with her. Thomas answered that he was. Bill encouraged him to be there for Caroline.\n\n\nBill shared that his greatest regret in life was that he had not been able to raise his sons when they were young. He was grateful he had met them as adults, but he'd missed out on a lot. Bill said that it was important that Douglas have his mother and father because his great-nephew and niece were precious to him.\n\n\nThomas asked how much time Caroline had, and Bill said no one knew. He encouraged Thomas to break it off with Sally and return to Caroline as soon as possible. Thomas looked shaken.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Caroline discussed all the preparations for Monaco, and they hoped Thomas returned to her. Steffy made a pitch that family was important, and she had grown up without both parents in the same home. She wanted Douglas to have both parents.\n\n\nCaroline lamented that she and Steffy could see that Sally was all wrong for Thomas, but they wondered why Thomas couldn't see it. Caroline sighed and said it could have been worse. She was a mom to a wonderful baby boy, and everyone was healthy. She was grateful for all of that, and she was still in love with Thomas. She regretted that she had pushed him away and into Sally's arms. Steffy said that they were all rooting for her and Thomas to be together.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Ridge and Quinn discussed that neither of them would go to the Spencer Summit in Monaco because they were worried about Eric. Quinn continued to text message and call Eric, but he ignored her messages. She hated to leave the mansion in case he decided to return.\n\n\nQuinn worried that Eric was confiding in Sheila. She told Ridge that Eric was vulnerable, and Sheila was probably filling his head with lies. Ridge agreed.\n\n\nSteffy showed up and noted that her father looked awful. Ridge admitted that he and Quinn hadn't eaten or slept. Ridge drank some tea and said he was worried. He wanted to know that Eric was safe.\n\n\nSteffy looked guilty. She said that Eric was safe. Ridge asked if she had heard from him. Steffy admitted that she had seen him. Ridge was upset. She reminded him that Eric didn't want anyone to know his whereabouts. Ridge asked where and when she had seen him. She said that she and Liam had visited him at a hotel. \"Was he with Sheila?\" Ridge asked. Steffy confirmed that he was. Ridge was upset.\n\n\nAt Eric's hotel room, Sheila asked if she could do anything for him. She offered to take his clothes to the dry cleaners, and Eric seemed distant, but he thanked her. Eric went into the bathroom, and Sheila caressed his clothes. She flashed back to when she had kissed Eric.\n\n\nSheila smiled. Eric returned. She wondered if there was anything else she could do for him. He asked her to turn back the clock. Sheila wished she could turn it back to when they had been together and happy.\n\n\nEric said he wanted to turn back the clock to when he'd been \"blissfully unaware\" of Quinn's deception. Eric wondered when Quinn and Ridge had decided to lie to him. He noted that they had only kissed each other and had planned to tell him themselves -- but Sheila had beaten them to it. Sheila argued that they hadn't confessed and that an emotional affair was just as powerful as a physical one.\n\n\nEric paused and said he really didn't know who Sheila was. He noted that she had worked hard to turn her life around and had been picked on by the Forresters. He marveled that she had literally taken a bullet from Steffy and helped him.\n\n\nEric apologized for everything. Sheila said she cared about him. He told her that they could never return to the way they had been. There had been too much pain in their pasts, but she was a good friend. Sheila said she was glad to be called a friend. She wondered if Steffy would tell Quinn and Ridge where he was. Eric didn't know. Eric and Sheila hugged.\n\n\nLater, at Spencer, Caroline visited Bill, and he told her that he'd had a chat with Thomas. He was convinced that Thomas would soon return to New York with her and Douglas. Caroline was elated and wondered how Bill had accomplished it. \"I just gave him a push,\" Bill said.\n\n\nCaroline hugged Bill and said he couldn't be serious. \"As a heart attack,\" Bill answered. He guaranteed that Thomas would return to her. Caroline asked again how he had done it. \"I told him you were dying,\" Bill said. Caroline broke the embrace and gasped.\n\n\nThomas returned to Spectra and somberly looked on his phone at a family picture of Caroline and Douglas. He flashed back to Bill's conversation, and he looked at photos of them as a happy family.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Thomas is in shock when Bill tells him that Caroline is suffering from a terminal illness. Bill claims that Caroline wants no one to know, but he felt that Thomas deserves the truth and that there is only a short time frame left for him to make memories with Caroline and Douglas. Thomas admits that he still loves Caroline and decides that he must be there for her. Steffy notes that Caroline is still in love with her brother and hopes that they can find a way back together. Ridge and Quinn fear the worst about Eric possibly spending time too much with Sheila. At the hotel, Sheila fuels Eric's fire regarding Quinn and Ridge by suggesting scenarios about their affair that are much more severe than they actually were. Eric applauds Sheila for turning her life around and coming to him with the truth, but also makes it clear that their past is too tainted than to ever allow him thought about rekindling a romantic relationship. Bill has no remorse about the blatant lie that he just told Thomas and proudly reveals to Caroline his master strike to reunite her and Thomas.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas is stunned and can not believe Caroline is dying. It does not make sense. Bill says she told no one else as she did not want to burden them. It is a rare auto immune disease and yes she has seen every specialist there is. He is only telling Thomas because it affects his son, Douglas. Sheila remembers and feels pleased with herself that she was able to kiss Eric. She takes his clothes to have cleaned. She asks if there is anything else she can do. He says no, unless she can turn back the clock \u0096 back to the time before he knew what Quinn was up to. She betrayed him with Ridge, his own son. Sheila laments that she wishes she did not have to be the one to tell him. She is so mad that they had to betray him. He softens and says it was only a few kisses and he is not sure that amounts to an affair. Sheila replies that an emotional affair is just as bad as a physical one. Caroline confides to Steffy that she would be with Thomas right now if she had not pushed him away. She came back now even knowing that Sally is in the picture. Steffy says that is not a problem, she can overcome Sally. Caroline hopes so as she wants her family together. Thomas wonders if Bill is telling him this to get him to return to his family. Bill says no; Thomas should never have been with Sally in the first place. He will never get that time back and now his only responsibility is to his son and his mother with the time they have left. It will be his son's only lasting memories long after his mother is gone and only Thomas can give him that. Sheila tells Eric that she knows she is not worthy but she is trying so hard to be the woman that he wants. He says he is sorry that too much has happened between them in the past and that is not going to happen again. He does appreciate her coming back and telling him the truth when no one else would. She is a true friend. She says okay she can accept that and she can stay if he wants or she can leave. Quinn grouses to Ridge that this is not good, only Sheila back in Eric's life. Bill tells Thomas that just video chatting with Douglas is not trying to put the family back together. Thomas says of course he still loves Caroline but she left him, but now he has to be there for her. Bill says he has two regrets in his life \u0096 he was not there for his two adult sons growing up and one of their mothers was taken away too soon. He does not want that to happen to him and Caroline. He needs to get rid of this red- headed clown and be with Caroline as soon as possible. Caroline drops in on Bill. Bill says she asked for his help with Tommy boy but the strong arm did not work. He says he will spare her the details but just know that when she goes back to New York she will not be going alone or just with Douglas. Thomas will be with her. She can't imagine how he managed that. He says it was easy. He told Thomas that she was dying. Caroline is livid. Ridge tells Steffy that Quinn is upstairs now resting and he is okay. She says he is not; he is just drinking and hasn't eaten in days. He is mad when Steffy says she has known for days where Eric is when Liam tracked him down. Eric hugs Sheila and she hangs on to him for dear life.",
