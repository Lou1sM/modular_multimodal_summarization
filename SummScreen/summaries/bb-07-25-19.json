    "tvmega_recap": "Liam sits drinking coffee and keeps hearing the words Flo said to Thomas if Hope knew the secret she would never have married him. She is going to tell her. Steffy catches Liam while he is still pondering about Flo. He says it is strange if Flo gave birth in Vegas and now living in L. A. so shortly afterwards. Thomas greets Hope as Mrs. Forrester and takes steps toward her to kiss her but she pulls back. Liam tells Steffy that he realizes now just how little he knows about Flo or the adoption process so he would like her to walk him through that. Hope tells Thomas that the door is unlocked and anybody could walk in. He says they are married and doing no wrong. But he gets it, they are in her mother's house and Douglas is just down the hall so they will take it slow for now. Ridge catches a moment to see Flo about some fabric and ends up talking about Thomas. He knows some of the Logan women do not like Thomas but he is a good guy. He gets that from him. Thomas tells Hope that he did not have time to get them to Paris for a honeymoon but he has some plans for tonight. She asks if Douglas is going. He says that would defeat the purpose. She wants to know what purpose. He cannot believe she said that. She asks if he has asked Brooke and Ridge or is Thomas just assuming they will agree to take care of Douglas. He quips that he did not know he had to ask his wife's permission to give her this surprise. She slips out by saying she wants to be sure that Douglas ate his breakfast and then she is going to work. He says okay but only half day, then he expects to spend the rest of the day and night with her. Thomas then texts Flo and reminds her of her drunken stupor but she will lose more than her job and good life if she breathes a word that Beth is alive. He looks around and sees Douglas at the door. He apologizes for not knocking but Hope told him to brush his teeth. Thomas explains that Douglas knows what a honeymoon is. That is going to be tonight and it will only be one night and Douglas can go spend the night with Aunt Steffy and the girls. He tells him to go get his clothes and be ready. Douglas asks why did Thomas say baby Beth is alive. Thomas adamantly says he didn't. Douglas says yes he heard him on the phone. Thomas shuts the door and tells him that he misheard. He would never say anything that hurtful so Douglas is not to mention that again. When Douglas tries to say he did not misunderstand, he heard his dad say it, Thomas grabs him by the arm. Douglas tells him that he is mean. Thomas says he is disappointed in Douglas. He has given him a new life, this great house to live in, all the food and toys that he wants, even a new mommy. Douglas says Thomas never mentions his mommy. Thomas says because she is gone but he has Hope now. He wanted that. But if it is not what he wants, then Thomas and Hope can go live in New York and Douglas can stay here. Douglas says he loves Hope but she is not his real mommy. Thomas orders him to drop all this talk about Beth being alive. Douglas is not to say her name again to him, Hope or to anyone. This conversation is over. When he leaves, Douglas looks into the mirror and says Beth is alive, Beth is alive, Beth is alive. Liam keeps looking at the papers and hearing Wyatt say that it sounded like to him that Flo never gave birth. He calls a number hoping he can verify some information about a private adoption and even gives Flo's name and wonders if they can find information around a certain date when she gave birth. He explains he only has a duplicate as the original adoption papers have been locked away not to be seen by the public. The lady explains she cannot give out confidential information. Hope runs into Flo at work and they discuss the wedding Flo did not get to see. Flo says she is surprised as she realizes now that Hope does not love Thomas and she wonders why she would do something she really does not want to do. Hope says sometimes you do things to make others happy. She cannot give Liam a baby or get Beth back but she does have a wonderful son now and that will be enough.",
