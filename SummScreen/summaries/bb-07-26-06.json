Taylor tells him that sometimes it is hard for a grieving parent to explain death to a child and often it is better to have someone less involved explain. Taylor asks Thorne if Alexandria has ever known anyone that's died.  Thorne tells her Alexandria knows about death, but has never really had to experience it first hand.  Taylor thinks many children Alexandria's age don't understand the permanence of death.  Before they can finish their conversation, Alexandria comes running in proudly showing them a \"Get Well\" card that she made for her mother. After Alexandria leaves the room Thorne feels guilty about not telling her about Darla's funeral. He knows she would have wanted to attend. Taylor assures him that Alexandria will understand that he was just trying to protect her. He worries about how he is going to break the news.  Taylor advises Thorne to be himself and just be honest and loving when he tells her. While he is still trying to figure out the right words,  Alexandria comes up to him asking about her mother. Thorne sensitively explains that Darla is dead.  Not old enough to understand,  Alexandria asks him when Darla can taking her pony riding. Trying to help, Taylor says either she or Thorne will take her, but her mother can't.  She explains that even though Darla isn't coming back, she will live on in their hearts.  Before Taylor leaves, Thorne thanks her for all of her help and she thanks him for making her feel useful again. Taylor offers to come back if Alexandria has anymore questions.  Alexandria calls her Dad in to sing her Mom's favorite song, \"Smile\". Thorne sings her to sleep, as Taylor watches.\n\n\nMeanwhile in Thorne's office at Forrester, Ridge is staring at a picture of Thorne and Darla when Donna walks in.  He wonders if he should remove all the pictures of Darla from the Thorne's office, but Donna tells him not to.  She tells him she came by to check up on him, since Brooke no longer can.  She tells Ridge that he and Brooke are the gold standard of relationships and she has never been able to find one that measured up to theirs.  Ridge refuses to get into another discussion about him and Brooke.   \n\n\nAt Taylor's, Stephanie drops by looking for Taylor, but Phoebe explains that Taylor still isn't back from the funeral. Stephanie worries that Taylor has cut herself off from the family.  She tells Phoebe she wants to be friends with Taylor again.  Stephanie is concerned that Taylor is blaming herself for Darla's death.  She says no one is to blame except \"that animal that ran her down.\"  Before Stephanie leaves she asks Phoebe how her mother seems to her.  Not wanting to make Stephanie suspicious, Phoebe says she thinks Taylor is going through a rough patch because she misses Ridge.  Stephanie refers to Taylor's drinking problem, and tells Phoebe to let her know if she or her Mom ever need her, promising that no one else will have to know.\n\n\nBack at Forrester, in Brooke's office, Nick admits that Brooke's naked ad campaign payed off for Forrester.  Brooke worries that sales will fall if she doesn't keep modeling for the Bedroom Line.  Nick suggests that Donna become the new lingerie model for Brooke's Bedroom.  He thinks it would be a cute campaign to have Brooke's little sister going through Brooke's closet and trying on her sister's lingerie.  At first Brooke is opposed to the idea, saying she isn't sure how Donna looks in underwear, but Nick assures her that Donna looks good.  Donna drops in before they have a chance to fool around and Nick makes a speedy exit. Donna is upset with Brooke for deserting the Bedroom Line when Ridge needs her most. She tells Brooke that it is hard for Ridge to try out his designs without a model.  Donna is caught off guard when Brooke tells her that Nick thinks she should be Ridge's model. Brooke teases her sister, acting like she may not be in good enough shape to model.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Donna finds Ridge in his office and she comments on how sad and alone he looks. He enquires if Donna has a man waiting for her in San Francisco. Donna tells him that she has never found a man who has made her feel the way Ridge makes Brooke feel. Nick and Brooke talk about the Brooke's Bedroom line and her modeling. Nick suggests Donna be the new face for the line. Brooke is a little unsure but mentions it to Donna anyway. Stephanie drops by to see Taylor, but Phoebe informs her that she isn't home.

    "tvmega_recap": "Thorne and Taylor return to his house and slowly he goes through the motions of the matter at hand. He asks Taylor if she can help him explain Darla's passing to Alexandria? His daughter joins them, all happy and smiling, she has drawn a picture for her mommy, \"Get Well, Mommy\". After their talk, she is alright, just wanting to ride a pony. At Forrester, Ridge packs up some photos in Thorne's office when Donna stops by. She is just checking up on him since big sis isn't allowed to. He wonders if there isn't a guy back home waiting for her? She says no one special. Stephanie pops in on Phoebe looking for Taylor and puts a few words in her ear making Phoebe feel even more guilty. Stephanie tells her no one is to blame for this, unless it's the animal that ran Darla down. She opines that her mother is a very strong woman, of character, but if she ever needs to talk, she is there .and no one else will ever know. Nick and Brooke discuss the funeral and she wishes he wouldn't monitor how people behave around her. Business is great, but she just wishes she could get it all back without peeling off her clothes. He suggests little sis though she is no model. Her body looks great in her underwear; well he saw her in her slip. Donna comes in later and Nick is dismissed. Brooke springs it on her if she will be the new spokesperson for the Bedroom Line. She makes it more a challenge when she remarks their derrieres are so much different. Alexandria asks her dad to sing to her; Mommy's song ..and almost choking, he manages Smile ..though your heart is aching ..just smile",
