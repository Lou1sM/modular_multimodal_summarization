Caroline replied that they hadn't been in it together for a long time. He believed her diagnosis changed everything. She snapped that she wasn't happy about that fact. Bill interjected that he'd told Thomas that she hadn't wanted Bill to tell him.\n\n\nThomas wanted to know what would happen with Douglas. Though he loved Caroline's moms, Thomas said, \"I need my boy.\" Caroline cited that they'd always had separate lives, and Douglas hadn't been made out of love. She'd been married at the time, and Thomas had been playing the field.\n\n\nThomas asked to know more about the autoimmune disorder. Bill called it a rarity without a name. He started to describe it as a cluster of unresponsive symptoms, but Caroline said to just stop it. Bill asked when the time would be to discuss it and added that they didn't know how much time they had.\n\n\nCaroline asked Thomas if he knew how offensive it was that he only wanted to be with her because he thought she was dying. Thomas asserted that it wasn't true and had never been true. He'd been heartbroken when she hadn't wanted him in New York, and all he wanted was to spend whatever time they had left together.\n\n\nThomas didn't want Caroline to be angry with him or say that he'd done too little too late. He'd been trying to cope the best he could ever since their breakup in New York. He'd thrown himself into his work because he'd seen his father do it, but that wasn't the kind of father Thomas wanted to be. Bill started to speak his mind as a father, but Caroline warned him not to make things worse. Bill said he had pure motives, but he and Thomas also had a plane to catch.\n\n\nThomas revealed that he wasn't going to the summit. Bill said he understood it, but Caroline insisted that Thomas would go. Thomas claimed that everything had changed. She replied that he'd made a commitment and needed to keep it. Keeping commitments was what she expected of Thomas. Thomas asked her not to make any decisions until he returned.\n\n\nThomas left, and Caroline asked if Bill saw what his lie had done. Bill told her to see that people didn't grow up. Instead, they remained juveniles until a catastrophe. \"And then -- and only then -- can you break them,\" Bill stated.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Steffy updated Brooke and Katie about where Eric was and whom he was with. R.J. and Coco arrived, and Katie and Steffy took off. Brooke said she'd heard from Lieutenant Baker, and she hoped R.J. and Coco knew that they were lucky. Coco replied that it could have wound up being more than a fine.\n\n\nBrooke didn't want Coco and R.J. to feel as if they'd gotten away with something, because that would make the fine, the close call, and the wrecked car be in vain. Brooke believed R.J. and Coco were lucky to be alive.\n\n\nBrooke asked if R.J. and Coco would play a video game or watch television while driving. R.J. said they got it, but Brooke continued, saying that they could only operate one machine at a time -- the car or the phone.\n\n\nR.J. didn't see the difference in using the phone or talking to a person in the backseat of a car.\n\n\nBrooke pointed out that one didn't type on a small keyboard when talking to a backseat passenger. R.J. then asked about having a radio or music player in the car. \"Look. I'm going to tell you a story,\" Brooke decided.\n\n\nWhen Brooke had been in high school, she'd had a boyfriend who'd been signed to a record label. He'd died in his car because, according to his surviving sister, he'd been fiddling with the radio, trying to find the station that was playing his song. Brooke insisted that it wasn't worth it to drive distracted. Three seconds could destroy one's life and the lives of those nearby.\n\n\nR.J. didn't think his mother understood that if his phone chimed, it meant someone was trying to reach him. Brooke asserted that nobody trying to reach him wanted to cause any deaths over it. She advised him to let it go to voicemail.\n\n\n\"That tree could have been another car, and they could be dead right now. So could you,\" Brooke stated. Coco agreed. Everyone stood, and Brooke urged R.J. to be careful while she was in Europe because she didn't know what she'd do without him. R.J. promised to wait until her return to be his bad self. \"No, you won't,\" she said, giggling, and they hugged.\n\n\nIn the design office, Wyatt expressed to Katie that he wanted swimsuits that became transparent like the one Elizabeth Taylor had worn in a movie. Katie thought it was a good idea for the Men's Line and asked Wyatt's size. He said to scratch the idea.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally and Shirley discussed how Sally would have to sleep on the private jet. Shirley was trying to be supportive of Sally and \"Tom of Forrester.\" Shirley dreamily said that calling Thomas that made him sound like Robin Hood. Sally quipped that Shirley had believed Sally would lose Thomas to Caroline. Shirley admitted that she had no problem being wrong, especially when being right would bankrupt them.\n\n\nShirley told Sally to go and have a good time. Shirley and the gang planned to watch the challenge on the livestream. Sally reminded Shirley of the time difference, and Shirley decided that they'd record it. She told Sally to beat the pants off the Forresters, and Sally left.\n\n\nLater, on the jet, Bill observed as Wyatt poured Steffy some Champagne, and Katie and Brooke held water glasses. Sally arrived, and Katie, Steffy, and Brooke grimaced. Katie asked what Sally was doing there. Bill claimed that he was a big-hearted guy, and Sally was his guest. He reminded them about keeping friends close, \"and your enemies and so on.\"\n\n\nAside, Bill asked Brooke how it had gone with R.J. Brooke believed she'd gotten through to her son. Bill remarked that even he didn't text and drive. He figured that the talk would enable Brooke to relax on the trip.\n\n\nThomas arrived and apologized for being late. Sally was glad to see him. She'd started to think the airline ride was a plot to drop her into the ocean. Wyatt quipped that Bill saved such treatment for Ridge. After an awkward silence, Steffy stated that Ridge wouldn't be with them. \"Typical,\" Bill quipped. Steffy added that Eric wouldn't be there, either.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Eric was disappointed that Steffy had told Ridge where Eric was. Ridge said that Steffy hadn't wanted to tell it, but she was scared for Eric. Eric asked why Ridge wasn't enjoying the spoils of his victory. Ridge said he'd moved off the property. \"With Quinn?\" Eric asked. Ridge said that Quinn barely left the house, as far as he could discern.\n\n\nRidge was there to talk. He said it would happen through the door if Eric didn't let him. Eric backed up, and Ridge entered the room with Eric and Sheila. Ridge asked if Eric knew what day it was. It was the day they'd all go to Monte Carlo -- except Quinn. Ridge reminded Eric that Quinn had surprised Eric there, and it was the anniversary of them being together in public.\n\n\n\"And you told her how much you love her,\" Ridge added. He didn't think Eric had stopped loving Quinn and asked, \"So, why are you here?\"\n\n\nRidge asked how Sheila had found Eric and didn't believe it when Eric and Sheila said that she happened to be rooming down the hall. Ridge wanted to be honest and talk with his father alone, with no one else there. \"Nobody that matters,\" he said, shooing at Sheila.\n\n\nRidge claimed that it wasn't his and Quinn's relationship that caused the problem. It was really the relationship between Ridge and Eric. Ridge said that Eric had known before Ridge was born that Ridge was a bastard. Ridge stated that he was what he was, which was a man who wanted to win at everything. Eric had been the first adversary and still number one.\n\n\nRidge recalled that Eric had fired Ridge and wouldn't let Ridge return unless he accepted a role beneath his own daughter. Ridge stated that he'd had to retaliate in some way. He hadn't planned it and said it had just happened that way. Ridge said he just did what he'd always done because he could do it. He could make a woman want him. He asked Sheila if he was right.\n\n\nSheila replied that she'd never had that problem. Ridge agreed. He said Sheila had been wary of him, but Quinn hadn't been because Eric had told her not to be. Ridge claimed to have taken Quinn and wooed her; however, she'd resisted because she loved Eric. Ridge said something within Eric made Eric better than Ridge. Ridge couldn't find whatever it was within himself.\n\n\nRidge believed that Eric's actions in their fallout were punishing Eric, not Ridge. Ridge said that Eric was with the one woman who loved and understood him more than anyone, and Ridge had used her as a pawn to beat Eric. The game was over, and Ridge said Eric could go home to his wife. Sheila asked if Ridge was done, and he replied that it was up to Eric.\n\n\nEric apologized for calling Ridge a Marone whenever Eric felt like insulting Ridge. Eric felt that Ridge had been his son from the moment Stephanie had put Ridge into Eric's hands. Eric said Ridge had turned into a great boy, and they'd had fun and laughter. Eric believed that Ridge's siblings had adored him and given him all the attention he could want. He said Ridge had learned to crave it, and he'd taken it. \"Because you could,\" Eric added.\n\n\nEric recalled that Ridge had begun to draw. Eric recalled being amazed by it and by the things Ridge would say about shape, style, and color. Ridge would say things about design that Eric hadn't taught him. \"That made you my son,\" Eric stated. Ridge had wanted to emulate Eric, so Eric had put Ridge into the business. They'd become the father-son team, and the world bathed them in accolades.\n\n\nEric felt that Ridge wanted to have more than Eric, so Ridge had taken it. Eric continued, saying Ridge had taken Stephanie and Brooke from Eric, and then Ridge had taken the woman Eric had loved more than anything in the world, Quinn. \"Because you could,\" Eric said.\n\n\nEric grasped Ridge's head, and tears flowed from Ridge's eyes. Eric said he'd loved being Ridge's father. Kissing Ridge's forehead, Eric stated that Ridge would never be his son again. Ridge nodded and silently exited. Sheila fought back tears.\n\n\n",

Eric says to the victor goes the spoils so go home and enjoy them. Ridge says he has moved off the property and Quinn barely leaves the house. A little late but Brooke tells Coco and RJ they are lucky everything turned out all right and they are alive after texting while driving. They can only operate one machine at a time \u0096 either the car or the phone, not at the same time. It is just not worth the time to be distracted and it could feel safe but could also involve anyone around them. They agree and will be more careful. Thomas wants to know more about this auto immune disorder. Bill chimes in that it is so rare that it does not even have a name and the symptoms are varying. Caroline tells them to both stop.

There is no need to punish Ridge, he is only punishing himself and an innocent woman in his quest to beat Eric. The game is over .just go home to his wife. Eric says any time he wanted to berate Ridge or better him he has called him a Marone. But he loves him since the first time that Stephanie put him into his hands.
