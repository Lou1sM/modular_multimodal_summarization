    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Bill confessed to ordering Justin to dump Ridge from the chopper. Bill was embarrassed to say he'd been afraid. Ridge quipped that Bill had feared getting caught. Bill corrected that he'd feared that Ridge had been hurt. Bill reasoned that he and Ridge had both acted impulsively. Bill was sorry and promised Brooke that something like it would never happen again.\n\n\nThe tearful Brooke quietly asked why Bill had had to do it. Katie raged that Bill could have killed Ridge. Bill emphasized that he'd never wanted to hurt Ridge, and Brooke bitterly concluded that he'd just wanted to punish Ridge. Bill readily admitted that he'd wanted Ridge to pay for taking Brooke from him; however, Bill hadn't realized how dangerous the act had been.\n\n\nBrooke was upset that Bill hadn't considered R.J., but Bill claimed he'd never intentionally hurt the father of her son. \"Or your fianc\u00e9. I'm sorry,\" he said to Katie. Katie scoffed, and Ridge said it was just words. Ridge asserted that Brooke couldn't believe Bill, forgive Bill, or marry Bill.\n\n\nKatie was upset at Bill and said she hadn't wanted to believe the father of her child could be so reckless and criminal. \"What do you think he just did? It was both reckless and criminal!\" Bill yelled. Bill said Ridge had hijacked the helicopter, kidnapped Bill, and banked the copter so hard that Bill could have fallen out. Bill claimed that he'd be dead if he hadn't held on.\n\n\nWith a shrug, Ridge said he'd had to scare Bill into \"coming clean.\" Bill told Brooke that he'd only feared losing Brooke, and that was the reason he'd confessed to her. Bill continued to plead that he'd thought Ridge would swim to shore. Brooke pointed out that Ridge hadn't done that. She recalled the fearful time during the search and rescue. She asked what would have happened if they hadn't found Ridge and if Bill had ever planned to tell her the truth.\n\n\nBill asked for time alone with Brooke. When Bill prompted Brooke, Brooke said she didn't want to believe he was dangerous, but his temper was out of control. In her view, he lashed out when someone crossed him, and it scared her that he didn't care about the consequences. Bill told her that he deeply regretted his actions, and he'd do whatever he could to prove to her that it would never happen again. Katie laughed, asking if they all knew how many times Bill had said the same thing to her.\n\n\nKatie claimed that she'd spent years listening to Bill's lies and manipulations, and she didn't want that life for Brooke. Ridge told Brooke to take off her ring and kick Bill out. Bill said that Brooke could decide for herself, but Ridge raged that he didn't want Bill near his son. Bill thought it was ridiculous for anyone to say that he'd harm R.J., but Ridge said he didn't know where Bill drew the line.\n\n\nBill told Brooke that he'd give his life to protect Brooke and R.J. Katie quipped that he had no problem putting the life of R.J.'s father in danger. Bill asserted that he'd do things differently if he could. Brooke responded that he couldn't take it back. \"You heard her. Pack up and go,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nBill decided that he'd go when Brooke told him to go. He told Brooke that he'd made the wrong move, but he'd also flown halfway around the world to avoid problems. Brooke asked if he was blaming it on Ridge. Bill said that he wasn't, but Ridge also wasn't devoid of blame.\n\n\nBill asserted that Ridge had known who he'd been dealing with and that there would be payback. \"The difference is -- I reacted spontaneously. It was on impulse. You planned the whole thing out. You flew to Abu Dhabi, you hunted us down, broke up the wedding, dragged Brooke onto a helicopter against her will. Yeah. I screwed up, but you -- you ain't exactly squeaky clean, either, pal -- including what you did today!\" Bill raged.\n\n\nRidge didn't want to listen anymore. He said no one wanted Bill there. \"Go. Get out,\" Ridge ordered. Ridge didn't want Bill near R.J. and added that Brooke didn't want Bill around. \"Tell him. Tell him it's over,\" Ridge prompted. Bill turned expectantly to Brooke.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Ivy arrived as Aly and Liam were discussing Liam's confidence regarding Wyatt and Hope. Aly told Ivy that she'd been expressing her surprise that Liam had \"let\" Wyatt return to Forrester. Liam quipped that he'd always wondered what it was like to have a little sister. Aly reasoned that she wanted to look out for Liam because, to her, Wyatt was more like Bill than Liam believed.\n\n\nLiam admitted that his past with Wyatt would always make him a little wary of Wyatt, but when Quinn had gone too far, Wyatt had stood up for Liam like a brother. \"Half-brother,\" Aly corrected. Ivy asked if Liam and Wyatt had become cool, and Liam said everything was great. Though Liam would always instinctually keep an eye out, he trusted Hope and the working relationship.\n\n\nLiam said that Wyatt and Hope were excited to collaborate with Ivy. Aly was anxious to see the new collection and noted that Ivy hadn't said a thing about it -- even though they lived together. Liam and Aly wanted a small glimpse of it, but Ivy didn't know if it was a good idea to show them anything.\n\n\nLater, Ivy and Aly were alone. Aly was ready to find Ivy a man, but Ivy claimed to have no time for dating. Aly confided that she and Oliver had just gone through something, but they'd worked it out. Aly said she had no experience dating, and he was her first boyfriend. Ivy advised Aly to be herself, and things would work out.\n\n\nAly was glad to have someone else near her age around and remarked that Hope was always busy. Ivy said she hadn't gotten a chance to know Hope well, but she saw that Hope was smart and pretty. \"Every bit a Logan, I guess,\" Ivy flatly added. Aly asked why Ivy would say that. Ivy replied that Hope had learned from \"the master. Her mother. The famous Brooke Logan.\"\n\n\nAly replied that Brooke and Hope were very different. Ivy wondered if that were really so and remarked that Hope and Wyatt would be spending a lot of time together. Ivy guessed it was nice for Hope to have two guys fight over her -- as long as she didn't torture them like her mother had with Thorne, Eric, and Ridge.\n\n\nAly was silent. Ivy added that there was appropriate behavior, and then there was Brooke's behavior. Aly insisted that Hope wasn't like that, and Hope was all about her message. Ivy felt that Aly was idolizing Hope too much, and Hope wasn't living up to the message. Ivy showed Aly the accidental recording she'd made of Wyatt and Hope hugging in the sky lounge.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Hope apologized to Wyatt for getting overly excited, but Wyatt told her that it had just been a hug. She couldn't believe that she was holding the diamond again and that it was Wyatt's jewel. He corrected that it was hers to keep forever.\n\n\nHope was sad that Ricardo had died. Wyatt was grateful that Ricardo had entrusted him with the stone, \"but now,\" Wyatt was entrusting Hope with it. She was leery about accepting such a gift, but he said it belonged with her. She replied that it was too much. He insisted that it was supposed to be in their lives. He said it had worked wonders for them before, and it would do it again.\n\n\nHope didn't feel right accepting the diamond that Ricardo had given to Wyatt. Wyatt claimed Ricardo had known that Wyatt would know what to do with it. She said Ricardo had known what the stone meant to Wyatt. Wyatt reasoned that Wyatt knew how much it meant to her, to \"us,\" to their past and their future.\n\n\nHope agreed that it had been a big part of their lives, but she was with Liam. Wyatt stated that he didn't expect it to change anything. She asked why he'd give it to her then. He insisted that it belonged to her, and it always would. Hope was still hesitant, and he asked her what he'd do with it. He figured he couldn't wear it, and it wasn't his style.\n\n\nWyatt believed that only Hope could give the diamond the justice that it deserved. He told her that the diamond seemed like a lot, but she'd given him love, a life, a job, and a purpose. He asked her to think of it as a reminder of what they'd had and could accomplish together. He insisted that it was the HFTF diamond, her diamond, and it would be wrong for anyone else to have it.\n\n\nWyatt felt that the two most precious things he'd ever known should be together. Hope stammered, but she said she couldn't. Wyatt told her to do it for the diamond and for the dearly departed Ricardo. Hope playfully accused Wyatt of guilting her, and he said he certainly was.\n\n\nJust then, Liam arrived, and Wyatt tucked the diamond away. Liam told them about Ivy's video and asked if Ivy had gotten them on it yet. Wyatt and Hope said that Ivy hadn't, and Liam warned that it would happen. Liam also noted that Ivy's mother followed the three of them in the tabloids, and Wyatt wondered \"who she's routing for,\" him or Liam.\n\n\nSnuggling herself against Liam's side, Hope said Ivy's mother would be sad that the gossip would end because Hope was with Liam. Wyatt added that he was all alone, but Liam said that Wyatt would always have his jewelry. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells Brooke that he screwed up. He should have been honest with her. He's embarrassed to say he was scared. He never meant to hurt Ridge. He never meant it to go this far. Ridge says he means he never thought he'd get caught. Bill says Ridge needed to be taught a lesson. He reacted impulsively. He tells Brooke he is sorry and promises her that nothing like this will ever happen again. He wants her to say something. She asks why did he have to do this? He says he had to punish Ridge for taking her away. He wanted him to pay. She says Ridge could have been killed and all Bill was thinking about was himself. He almost killed R.J.'s father. He argues that she knows he would never intentionally hurt the father of her son. Ridge says those are just empty, meaningless words. Brooke can not trust him, she can not forgive him and she certainly can not marry him. Ivy is outside on the Rooftop still taking video on her phone. She comes across Hope and Wyatt just as Hope hugs Wyatt for showing her the diamond. Ivy quickly puts it away and goes back inside. Hope tells Wyatt that she doesn't know what to say. She says she is sorry. She just got carried away. He says it was just a hug; they didn't break any rules. She can't believe Ricardo left him the diamond and it's really his. He says no, it's hers now to keep forever. She keeps looking and gushing at it but says it is too much. He says the diamond belongs with her. It's meant for her. It's supposed to be in their lives. It's worked wonders for them before and he thinks it will do it again. She says she would not feel right accepting this as Ricardo gave it to him. He says because he trusted that he'd know what to do with it. She reminds him that she is with Liam now. He says he knows and he is not naive enough to think this will change anything. He just thinks it feels right and as far as he is concerned it has always belonged to her. He can't keep it and wear it, just not his style. They laugh about him giving it the justice that it deserves and he says only she can do that. Aly tells Liam that she admires his confidence. Most guys would not want their girlfriend to work with their ex boyfriend. Ivy slips in and hears this. Liam says yeah well he and Wyatt have a new understanding and he's turned over a new leaf and is starting to respect Liam's relationship with her. Aly says Liam may trust Wyatt but she thinks he is more like his dad than he realizes. Liam says sure he will always be a little wary of Wyatt but it was Quinn who caused the damage and Wyatt actually defended him. Ivy asks if he is okay with him now. Liam says yeah, he does not think he will be a problem with his and Hope's relationship. And he trusts her so he is okay with their working relationship. Liam leaves and Aly tells Ivy that they have to find her a boyfriend. Ivy says she will be busy and have no time to date. But she understands Oliver is pretty nice. Aly says yes tho they went through a rough patch lately but they worked it out. Aly tells Ivy it's good to have someone around her own age. Hope is cool but always so busy. Ivy says she hasn't had much chance to get to know her either ..but very pretty and every bit a Logan. She's learned from the master; the great Brooke Logan. Aly says Hope and Brooke are very different. Ivy can't be sure, but it must be nice having two guys fighting over you like Liam and Wyatt unless she is planning to torture them just like Brooke did with Aly's dad and Uncle Ridge and Eric. There is appropriate behavior and then there is Brooke's behavior. Aly assures her that Hope is not like that. Hope is a good person. Just look at what her HFTF message says about being honest and decent and staying true to yourself. No one does that better than Hope. Ivy says she does believe in the message but she thinks maybe Aly is idealizing Hope a little too much. She's not sure she is living up to her own message. Aly wonders why she said that. Ivy says she has something to show her. She shows her the video and says she did not mean to take it. Bill tells Brooke that he was really scared but he had to come clean and he wanted her to hear it from him. Dumping Ridge in the water was the only way he could fight back; the only way he could get Brooke back. She wonders what he would have done if Ridge hadn't been found; what Bill would have done then. She knows when someone crosses him that he strikes back .hard and he doesn't care about the consequences. And that scares her. He says he deeply regrets what he has done. Katie laughs and says she wishes she could count the times that he had said that he would never do something again. She has spent years of hr life listening to his lies and manipulations and she does not want that for Brooke. As Hope is still fighting with herself about the diamond Wyatt says this is nothing compared to what she has given him. She has given him love, a job, a purpose. Just think of this as a reminder of all the great times they have had. This is what they can accomplish together. This is her diamond. No one else should have it. It is rare and unique and should belong to someone equally so. It's only right that the two most precious things he has known should be together. She says she can't accept the diamond just about the time that Liam hobbles out and asks what they are working on. Hope puts the diamond in her pocket. They manage to make light of the conversation especially when Liam tells them he's been in Ivy's video and they better watch it as she will be after them next. Her mum is a huge fan of the tabloids and the three of them. Wyatt wonder who she is rooting for, him or Liam. Hope says well she will be disappointed with the gossip when she finds out that now she is with Liam. Wyatt says and he is alone. Liam jokes that he always has his jewelry. Ridge tells Brooke to take Bill's ring off and kick him to the curb. Bill rants to Ridge to let her think for herself. Ridge says he does not want him near RJ. Bill says he does not want anything to happen to RJ and if he could change things and go back he would. Brooke says that is just it, he can not go back. He admits he made the wrong move but he will not pack up and go until Brooke tells him to. Ridge knew who he was dealing with and is not devoid of blame either. He knew there'd be payback. The difference is that Bill acted on impulse whereas Ridge planned the whole thing out. So yes he screwed up but Ridge is not exactly squeaky clean either. Ridge says he has heard enough. He does not want him near his son and Brooke does not want him here either. He tells Brooke to tell him.",
