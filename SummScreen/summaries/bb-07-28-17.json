Loud enough for Thomas and Sally to hear, Bill wished he'd pushed harder for Caroline to go on the trip. He asked who knew when they'd see Caroline once she was back in New York.\n\n\nWyatt and Katie expressed excitement about the response their press conference had gotten. Wyatt said the showdown had created more traction for the Spencer website than the previous year. Katie replied that it would be \"so much fun,\" but Wyatt replied that it kind of already was.\n\n\nSteffy and Katie went over what the crew was doing on the ground with interviews and inventory. Steffy wondered if \"they\" were ready, and Sally assumed Steffy was referring to her. Steffy said they'd wipe the floor with Spectra, and Sally retorted that Steffy was going down.\n\n\nIn the private cabin, on his phone, Bill checked out the interest in the showdown. Brooke giggled, joking that he could close out the show in his sexy swim trunks. He decided to reserve the trunks for the spa on his yacht but then realized he wouldn't need them there. The two kissed.\n\n\nBill and Brooke rejoined the others, and Bill gave a speech about the fun they'd have. He said they'd also give to some of Spencer's favorite charities. Wyatt said Bill sounded like Liam. Claiming to be a charitable guy, Bill said he could be compassionate, and it was incumbent upon them to ease people's suffering when they could. Brooke hadn't known he'd felt that way. Bill said he did, and it was the right thing.\n\n\nBill moved on to making a toast to Wyatt for incorporating the fashion show into the challenge. Brooke said Wyatt couldn't have done it without Katie. Katie didn't want them to jinx it by congratulating themselves too soon. Wyatt decided that they should just toast to a \"kickass\" showdown and fun on the side.\n\n\nLater, Thomas privately asked Bill if he was sure Caroline was dying. \"I'm sure, Thomas,\" Bill replied. It didn't make sense to Thomas, and he was trying to figure it out. Bill said Thomas had better figure out it and think long and hard about his next move.\n\n\nThomas found Steffy and Sally sniping at each other about who'd win. He took Steffy's vacated seat and asked if Sally was okay. Sally said she welcomed verbal sparring. She noted that he seemed distracted and asked if he was having second thoughts about them. \"About us?\" he asked. She clarified that she meant about them crashing the summit. He didn't. She said he seemed to be really in his head, and he told her that there was a lot to think about.\n\n\nBill announced that they'd soon land. He wanted to speak to them before they touched down. Even though the fashion challenge pitted brother against sister, Bill felt that they all were family, even Sally. \"There is a mutual history,\" Bill explained.\n\n\nIn Bill's view, Douglas was the embodiment of what Bill was talking about. Bill stated that they might sometimes stray from the fold, but family was always first. Sally glanced at Thomas.\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo, upbeat music played as the camera panned the seaside and focused in on a hotel-top veranda. Bill welcomed everyone to Monaco, home of the Spencer Summit. Eva, Zende, and Nicole were there, along with Bill's jet passengers. Bill thanked everyone and said they'd raise a lot of money. \"Let's shoot for a million dollars,\" he decided.\n\n\nThe group dispersed, and Brooke and Bill recalled that they had great memories of Monaco. Zende and Nicole approached, and she said she couldn't wait for Zende's first showing.\n\n\nThomas and Sally strolled off, and she cooed about all the yachts. She felt they'd have great press, and she said they had to win the thing. Thomas said if anyone could do it, they could.\n\n\nNearby, Katie and Wyatt talked about the all-nighter they'd have to pull to transform the place. Eva approached and said she was at their service.\n\n\nIn a corner of the veranda near where the Stella Maris waited in the sea below, Steffy called everyone over to her. She said Forrester had been challenged and had brought its A-game. The Spectras had asked for it, and they'd gotten it. \"May the best fashion house win!\" she exclaimed, and everyone cheered.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn tried to call Eric, to no avail. Ridge arrived. Quinn was frustrated that he wasn't his father. She was ready to hire a private detective at that point, but Ridge said he'd seen Eric and knew where Eric was. Quinn was anxious to know where her husband was, if he was okay, and if he was alone. \"No,\" Quinn said when Ridge relayed that Sheila was there.\n\n\nRidge explained that Liam and Steffy had tracked Eric through his phone. Heading for the door, Quinn said she had to see Eric. Ridge halted her and said Eric didn't want to see her. Ridge refused to tell Quinn where Eric was because she'd just run right over there. Quinn affirmed she would and asserted that she wouldn't give up on her marriage.\n\n\nRidge said it would just make Eric take off again. Quinn asked if she was supposed to sit around as Eric slipped further away. Ridge advised her to give it time, or Eric would dig in and never return home. Quinn decided that she could give it time, but she wasn't leaving. She'd be there when Eric eventually returned home.\n\n\nAt his hotel, Eric was looking at text messages on his phone when Sheila knocked on the door. She'd arrived with his favorite food, sea bass, after she'd wondered to herself when he'd last had a good meal. Eric wasn't hungry, but she insisted. As she set up his table, he asked where her food was. Sheila planned to eat in her room, but he asked her to join him.\n\n\nAs Eric and Sheila had dinner, she discussed how she'd been impulse-driven in the past, but she'd settled down and taken a hard look at herself in prison. To her surprise, she'd discovered a better person inside her, longing to get out.  All she'd needed was love and encouragement. Sheila had birthed a new her with her time in jail.\n\n\nEric asked Sheila what the most surprising thing she'd learned was. Sheila said that she'd learned that she could love freely, without expecting anything in return. He thought it was wonderful insight. She also revealed that she'd thought about them and the wonderful times that they'd shared. She was thankful to be able to regain his trust. Eric was grateful for her honesty. Sheila said she'd worked on herself to prove that Eric hadn't been wrong to love her.\n\n\nLater, Eric said he didn't want to eat any more. Sheila asked if he wanted to talk about it. Assuming she meant his son and wife's affair, he said he didn't. He'd believed in Quinn and had told everyone how loyal she was. Eric couldn't believe she'd done it or that Ridge's excuse was that he hadn't been able to help himself. Eric felt that he'd been a fool.\n\n\nSheila cupped Eric's hand in hers and said Eric had done nothing wrong. She stated that his wife and son were the bad people for abusing his trust. Sheila added that no one knew it better than she did. Removing his hand, Eric suggested that they not dredge up their past.\n\n\nSheila claimed that no one wanted to leave it behind more than she. She didn't think she'd deserved a man like Eric. What made him good was his empathy and ability to forgive. \"And to think you'd let me in, let me close enough to kiss me,\" she said. Eric told her to hold on because he hadn't kissed her. \"To allow me to kiss you,\" she corrected.\n\n\nIt had been a big deal to Sheila, who'd never thought she'd feel the sensation of Eric's lips on hers again. It was the most wonderful feeling in the world to her, and she said he had no idea of the gift he'd given her. \"Sheila...I'm tired,\" Eric replied.\n\n\nSheila readily hopped from her seat and said she'd be leaving. He thanked her for the meal. Before going, she replied that it was her pleasure and told him to call if he needed anything else.\n\n\nAlone at the mansion, Quinn sat down and stared at her portrait. She flashed back on Eric proposing to her. At the hotel, Eric was deep in thought, and a split screen of Eric and Quinn appeared.\n\n\n",
