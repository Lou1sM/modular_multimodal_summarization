Ridge disagreed. \"Cut him loose. Spencer's not worth it -- never was,\" Ridge ordered.\n\n\nBill defended his actions as being out of anger because Ridge had interrupted his wedding. Bill claimed that he had been worried when Ridge had gone missing, and Bill added that he'd figured Ridge would show up, and everything would be okay. Bill tried to make excuses and said that he had been angry, but Katie interrupted.\n\n\n\"You made him doubt himself. That's the most despicable part of this,\" Katie said. She added that Bill had been cruel and made everyone doubt that Ridge had remembered anything. Brooke cried that she wanted the four of them to raise their children together. Bill argued that he needed to talk to Brooke alone. \n\n\nBrooke sent Ridge and Katie home. Katie kissed Brooke goodbye. Bill thanked Brooke for spending some time alone with him. \"Don't thank me, Bill. You have no idea what I'm going to say,\" Brooke said angrily.\n\n\nBrooke shouted that Bill had betrayed her. She had believed his claims that he valued family over business. She didn't think it had been possible for him to be so hurtful and intentionally cruel. She accused him of being a murderer, but Bill balked that he was certainly not a murderer. \"You're a damned liar,\" she cried.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Bill that he had known all along what had happened to Ridge in Abu Dhabi while everyone had been worried sick and looking for Ridge. \"You acted like you knew nothing. You said nothing,\" she said.\n\n\nBrooke mocked Bill's claims of love, but Bill argued that he loved her. \"I was wrong. I'll never keep anything from you again. Please don't let this derail our plan,\" he said. Bill begged Brooke to understand and forgive. Brooke scoffed.\n\n\n\"I am going to search my heart for forgiveness, but this reckless anger you have -- I can't take it,\" Brooke said. Bill said that he had meant every word he had said to her on the beach in Abu Dhabi. He recited his vows, recalling that they stood halfway around the world \"where the desert meets the sea and sand.\" Bill vowed that they could not allow anything to tear them apart. Brooke stared at Bill, and she looked confused.\n\n\nOutside at Forrester Creations, Liam had interrupted Hope and Wyatt. A secretary entered and advised Hope that a mutiny was underway with the sewing employees. Hope left, and Liam asked about Ivy. Wyatt said that office romances seldom worked.\n\n\nWyatt started speaking in riddles about how he was not in the market for a diamond -- perfect in every way. He added that that exquisite gems were like rare women. Liam noted that he needed to check on Hope. Wyatt encouraged him to catch up with his lady. Under his breath -- after Liam left -- Wyatt muttered, \"While you still can.\"\n\n\nIn Hope's office, Hope had to rework a schedule because employees in the sewing room had been angry. Deacon entered and claimed he couldn't stay away from his beautiful daughter. Deacon quizzed Hope about what was going on in her life. Hope told her dad that Wyatt had given her the Hope for the Future Diamond.\n\n\nDeacon marveled at the thought. Hope said that Wyatt had always claimed that he would give her the diamond, and Hope said that when she and Wyatt had picked up the diamond, it had been the beginning of incredible adventures. Deacon noted that it had a lot of magic for Hope and Wyatt. Hope agreed. \"Wyatt told me about the power of the diamond,\" Deacon shared.\n\n\nHope said that Wyatt had always said crazy, romantic things, but she couldn't believe he had given her the diamond. \"I can't really keep this,\" she said unconvinced. Deacon disagreed and told her \"take that thing and go running through the streets.\" Deacon added that it had amazing promotional value for her line.\n\n\nHope lamented that she couldn't accept a diamond from another man. Ridge and Katie interrupted. Deacon asked if Bill had finally been honest about what he had done. Ridge and Katie told Deacon that Ridge had taken Bill for a scary ride in a helicopter, and Bill had finally admitted his role in dumping Ridge out of the helicopter. Hope was confused, and Ridge explained that he had taken pilot lessons while he lived in Paris. Deacon asked if Brooke had dumped Spencer, but Katie said she had not done it yet. Ridge was confident that she would.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Aly and Ivy met. Ivy explained that she had captured Wyatt and Hope in a private embrace and that she was convinced that Wyatt had given Hope the Hope for the Future diamond. Aly defended Hope and claimed that Wyatt was using it to get Hope back in his life. Ivy said that Hope was not blameless. Aly refused to believe that Hope would put Liam through another round with Wyatt.\n\n\nLater, Liam found Hope alone in her office. He asked if everything had been okay. Hope showed Liam the Hope for the Future diamond, and Liam asked if it was a replica. Hope explained that the diamond's owner had died and left the diamond to Wyatt, and Wyatt had given it to her \"just like he said he would.\"\n\n\n\"Damn it,\" Liam said, \"you know you can't keep that, right?\" Hope nodded, but she looked confused.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Brooke that he hates seeing her this way. Bill is just playing with her emotions. She needs to tell him it is over for good. Bill tells Brooke they are far from over. He never meant to hurt Ridge, just teach him a lesson. Ridge tells Brooke again to cut him loose. He's not worth it; never was. Bill defends himself by saying he used all his resources to find Ridge. Katie speaks up and says he made Ridge doubt himself and made them doubt him too and that's the worst of it. Bill asks Brooke for five minutes alone and then he will leave if she still wants him to. Brooke tells Ridge and Katie to go on home, she will be okay. Bill thanks Brooke for giving him this time. She says don't; he has no idea what she is going to say. Liam joins Hope and Wyatt on the Rooftop and asks what is going on. Before Hope can say a word, she is tracked down and told she is needed back inside. Ivy shows Aly the video she made that accidentally caught Hope hugging Wyatt. She says she feels terrible. She is not this kind of person. Aly is shocked. She says Hope is back with Liam and she would never put him through that. Ivy has no other explanation then why Hope is hugging Wyatt unless he gave her the diamond. She saw the hug and the way Hope looked at him. Liam asks Wyatt how it is going with Ivy. Wyatt says he has noticed how cute she is but no office romance. That usually doesn't work out. Hope is taking longer than Liam thought so he says he is going to track her down. Wyatt tells him fine go be with his lady. Under his breath he says while he till can. As Hope finishes up, Deacon drops in and says he can't stay away from his beautiful daughter. He finds that she is distracted. He says he knows his track record really sucks at being a dad but he's trying to change that. He encourages her to tell him what's on her mind. Slowly she tells him something very unexpected happened. It involves the HFTF diamond. Deacon says he knows about the power of the diamond and Wyatt showed it to him. It's everything they all say it is and a lot more. She brings it out of her pocket and says Wyatt promised her that he would give it to her some day but now that he has .Deacon is shocked to hear that he actually gave it to her and encourages Hope to keep it. They banter back and forth how appropriate it is and Hope says not for an engaged woman to accept a diamond from another man. Suddenly they are interrupted by Katie and Ridge. Katie explains that Ridge took Bill on a little helicopter ride. Deacon hopes he sang like a bird. Ridge says eventually he did. Hope is surprised of course that Ridge can even fly a chopper. Deacon wants to know how Brooke is. Surely she has kicked Bill to the curb. Ridge says not yet and it worries him. Brooke won't let Bill touch her. She says she thought she knew the man she was about to marry today. He valued family above everything else even business. So he could not have done those things that Ridge said he did. She knows in the past that he has done some questionable things, hurtful things but she never knew he could be so intentionally cruel. Perhaps even a murderer Bill says he is no murderer. Brooke bellows then he's a damn liar. They all stood there in that suite scared to death for Ridge and Bill stood there and acted like he knew nothing. He says he was wrong. He does love her more than anything in this world. He says he let this consume him but he will never keep anything from her again. He begs her to please not let this derail their plans. Say she will understand and forgive. Finally she says she will search her heart for forgiveness but this reckless anger that he has she can not take it. She can not possibly marry him now or anytime soon. She says he lied tot her and betrayed her. He says they can not let this or anything tear them apart. Aly tells Ivy that Wyatt should not be upping the stakes. Hope has made her choice and it is Liam that she wants. Wyatt is just using the diamond to get Hope back. Hope looks at the diamond fondly and is still looking when Liam hobbles in. She doesn't hide it. She brings it out and shows him and says Wyatt gave it to her. Liam thinks it is a replica until she says no, that Ricardo passed away and willed the original to Wyatt and now he has given it to her. Liam says damnit, damnit, damnit, Wyatt lucked out and he's already using it to his advantage. He should have anticipated this. He says she knows she can't keep it. She has to give it back, like today.",
