    "soap_central": "\n\nIn an office at Forrester, Aly and Ivy discussed that no woman could resist a piece of jewelry like the Hope for the Future diamond. Ivy wondered if Hope wasn't enjoying two men fighting over her. Aly said she didn't trust Wyatt, and Wyatt entered and overheard her mistrust. He told Ivy that many people would disagree with Aly.\n\n\nRick entered, and Wyatt asked him for permission to call a press conference. Rick didn't like the idea, but Wyatt promised it would be worth the effort for a surprise announcement. Rick wanted to know more, but Wyatt asked for cooperation and promised it would be the next evolution of the Hope for the Future line. Rick agreed.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Liam angrily advised Hope to return the Hope for the Future diamond to Wyatt. Hope explained that Wyatt wanted her to have it because of its connection to the line. Liam shook his head and demanded that she return it because it was an inappropriate gift. Liam knew what Wyatt was up to. \n\n\nHope tried to defend Wyatt. \"Please don't do this,\" she said. She reminded Liam that he and Wyatt had just started to act like brothers, and Liam noted that Wyatt was trying to get Hope back. Liam wondered how Wyatt had gotten the diamond.  Hope explained that Ricardo had died, and he had left the diamond to Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam couldn't believe it, and Hope launched into her impassioned explanation of her belief that the diamond carried magic. \"Don't you remember what it did for the line? People were completely under its spell,\" she said. She added that the diamond had repeated its journey from Ricardo through Wyatt to Hope.\n\n\nLiam was skeptical. Hope argued that it was special. Liam reminded her that the last time the diamond had entered their lives, their relationship had fallen apart. \"This is not how I want you to see this,\" Hope insisted. However, Liam argued that Wyatt had seen the diamond as another opportunity to get back together with Hope.\n\n\nHope maintained that Wyatt had had no idea that he would get the diamond back, but Liam reiterated that Hope had to return it to Wyatt immediately. Hope looked defiant. She maintained that keeping it was a good business decision for the line -- the most success that Hope for the Future had ever seen. Liam said every time he saw the diamond, it reminded him of seeing Hope and Wyatt splashed all over everything.\n\n\nHope's phone rang, and Wyatt told her that he needed her in the showroom immediately. Hope said she had to go to the showroom. Liam told her it was the perfect opportunity to return the diamond. Hope looked despondent. Liam argued that if she kept it, Wyatt would see it as a sign of encouragement. Liam insisted that it was important \"for us,\" he said. Hope agreed. \"I'll give the diamond back,\" Hope said. She kissed Liam, and Liam thanked her.\n\n\nIn the showroom, Carter, Rick, Maya, Oliver, Aly, and Ivy watched while Wyatt discussed preparations. Carter lamented to Rick that he had almost married a woman he didn't even know. Rick encouraged Carter to cut Maya some slack because she'd had a tough life, lost her daughter, been in jail, and finally had seen a chance at getting a little control and power in her life. Carter watched Maya while Rick talked.\n\n\nNearby, Oliver told Aly that he needed some alone time with her, and she promised they would get together. Liam and Hope entered, and they were surprised that the news media had gathered. Liam was not optimistic when Wyatt took the stage.\n\n\nWyatt welcomed everyone. He announced that he had the Hope for the Future diamond. Wyatt shared that Ricardo, the owner, had died and left the diamond to him. Wyatt asked Hope to join him on stage. Wyatt held up the diamond, and everyone gasped. Wyatt officially offered it to Hope and asked her to accept it. \n\n\n\"Here it is. It's yours. All you got to do is take it,\" Wyatt said. Liam looked disgusted, and Hope smiled at Wyatt but looked nervously at Liam. She did not respond.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Deacon showed up and asked to talk to her. He said that he wanted to make sure Brooke was okay after her breakup. Brooke admitted that she didn't know what to think about what Bill had done. Deacon said that Bill hadn't cared that he'd hurt many people. Brooke didn't want to talk to Deacon about Bill.\n\n\nDeacon admitted that he and Brooke had a complicated history, but they shared an amazing daughter. Deacon explained that he had become a better man and wanted Hope to be proud of him. Brooke agreed that Deacon appeared to be trying.\n\n\nDeacon shared that Wyatt had inherited the Hope for the Future diamond and had given it to Hope. Brooke was shocked. She recalled that the gem had a lot to do with how Hope and Wyatt had started their relationship. Brooke said Hope had to return it. Deacon argued that Hope should keep it and flaunt it.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that she would advise Hope on the situation. Deacon agreed and flattered Brooke. She smiled.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam rants that he doesn't know how Wyatt thinks sometimes. Giving Hope the diamond was so uncool. She says he wanted her to have it for the connection to her line. Liam says this gesture is more than about her line and if she keeps it she will be sending Wyatt a message. Surely she has to get that. He hates that he let his guard down. She begs him to please not let this get in the way of their just now becoming like brothers. He says he knows. It's because he was the one to reach out. Wyatt saved his life and proved he is not like his mother. They were supposed to have an understanding and already Wyatt is being inappropriate by giving her the diamond. And that doesn't even make any sense why Ricardo left Wyatt the diamond in the first place. They barely knew each other. She says they bonded over the diamond. Liam says okay then that is a reason enough that Wyatt should keep the diamond. He wants Hope to text or send an e-mail to Wyatt and give the diamond back. Aly tells Ivy she is sure Hope will do the right thing and give the diamond back to Wyatt. Ivy says it won't be easy. What woman could resist a piece like that. Aly says believe her Wyatt is no prize. He is sneaky and underhanded with manipulations when it comes to Hope. Wyatt walks in and tells Aly it always warms his heart to know he has her support. He tells Ivy she can't believe everything Aly says as she can't stand him and is not exactly objective. Most people think he is a pretty nice guy. Ivy asks if that includes Hope. He says he thinks she will give him a good recommendation. Aly follows and for good measure they can follow that up with Liam's thoughts. Wyatt says in case she has missed it he and his brother are getting along well these days. Rick comes in. Wyatt says he's glad they are all here as he wants them to be a part of it. Wyatt says it is a press conference and the press is on their way. Rick is not sure he likes that without some assurance of what it is about. Wyatt says it is a surprise but if Rick will go with him on this he assures him he will not be sorry. Wyatt says it is the next evolution for HFTF and for Hope. Rick says again in front of his group. He does not like going into this PC blind. Aly makes a smart report like this isn't the first time Wyatt has done something questionable. Wyatt reminds her that was in the past. Maya wants a clue. Wyatt says he has found a way to put HFTF back on the map but bigger than ever this time. Oliver says it is risky. Wyatt says he is that confident that it will be the next big step. But he tells Rick that if he is not onboard he will plug the plug right now; just tell him. Rick tells him to go ahead but do not make him sorry that he agreed to it. Wyatt says great today is going to be a big day for their team. Brooke answers the door and it's Deacon. She tells him Hope is not here. He says he is there to see her. He wanted to make sure she was okay. She lets him in. He says it feels pretty nice to be able to talk to her without Bill being around. She says she was completely blindsided by this. Bill only wanted to teach Ridge a lesson and that'd take about twenty minutes. Deacon says little boys have bigger toys only they are not make believe any more. Deacon knows what Bill has done and says he bets he did not go away quietly. She says she does not want to be rude but she really doesn't want to discuss this with him. He says he knows they have a complicated history and he doesn't expect them to be best buds right out of the box but he can dream. Hope holds the diamond for Liam to look at more carefully and explains this is not just any diamond but the HFTF diamond. It has special powers. He must feel it. She knows for a fact that it has MAGIC! The second they paired it with the line everything took off. People were completely under it's spell and now it's come back to them. He argues that Wyatt is using it for power to get her to look in his direction again. She says that is not the way she wants him to see this. He says but that is how it is. And shame on him for believing Wyatt could be any other way while he makes his big move. Hope reminds him there was no way that Wyatt knew Ricardo was going to die or leave him the diamond. Liam says but the minute it did fall out of the sky he brought it directly to Hope. He tells her that she has to give it back ..today. The only person who should be giving her a diamond is him. She tells him again this is not a commitment. It is not a promise made, otherwise she would not be accepting it. This is business. This diamond represents the most success that the line has ever seen. Liam asks if she'd like to hear what he sees when he sees the diamond. He sees her and Wyatt splashed over everything .and he knows Wyatt sees it that way too. And that is what Wyatt is counting on. If she accepts this she is sending him mixed signals. He does not think she wants to do that. Her phone rings and it is Wyatt. He says he is in the showroom and needs her there right away. She tells Liam and he thinks that is great. It will be the perfect opportunity for her to give the diamond back. If she doesn't Wyatt will see it as a sign of encouragement and they will be right back where they started .back to a place they do not want to go again. He says his brother is an operator and he's proving it once again. He knows this diamond has meaning to Hope but if it weren't so important he would not be asking her this. She shakes her head yes, okay she will give it back. Deacon tells Brooke that a lot has happened between them, some not so good, things he is not proud of but he wants her to know that he's not that man anymore. She says it seems like he is trying. He says he wants his daughter to be proud of him and say to people that is her dad. He looks at her and is humbled and can not believe he had anything to do with creating that amazing woman. But whatever they went through it was worth it. He asks if she has heard about Wyatt's latest. She is afraid to ask. He fills her in on the diamond and now Wyatt is the proud owner and he has given it to Hope. Brooke is speechless but says Hope will not keep it. Deacon doesn't know why not. And he knows the stone has magical powers. It has a mind of its own and where it wants to be. And that is Hope. It keeps going to her and that is where it wants to be. Hope and Liam are surprised when they go to the showroom and see all the hubbub. Wyatt greets her and won't give her details but says to stay right there. Wyatt slips his jacket on and takes the stage. He welcomes them all here and says they will skip the pleasantries as he knows they are dying to know why they are here. He says he is extremely happy to announce the return of Hope and the HFTF diamond. The audience gasps and flashbulb go off. He explains that Ricardo passed away and willed him the diamond. He calls Hope up on stage. She looks at Liam and he sort of makes a gesture to go ahead. Hope hands Wyatt the diamond and Wyatt holds it up; more flashbulbs go off. He tells Hope that he promised her that he would give this to her one day so now it is hers. All she has to do is take it. The emotions are mixed ..Wyatt is grinning ear to ear, Liam is glowering, Hope looks confused and most in the audience are oohing and aahing.",
