    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Alison tried to go over a schedule of meetings with Bill, but he kept interjecting \"Cancel it\" for each event. Alison told him that losing his girlfriend was a minor problem in his \"lexicon.\" Bill grumbled that he wanted Brooke back, and Alison replied that Brooke would return to him when she was ready.\n\n\nBill figured that dumping Ridge into the gulf had been a miscalculation -- not that Ridge hadn't deserved every moment that he'd been in the water. Alison advised Bill to let Brooke spend some time figuring out what it was like to be without the powerful Bill Spencer.\n\n\nBill murmured that he wouldn't play that game. Alison claimed that Brooke without a man was like a ship without a rudder, and Bill was Brooke's rudder. Bill stated that no one knew Brooke as he did. Alison believed that no one else was even close, and Brooke would be back.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke was still disillusioned about Bill ordering Justin to dump Ridge out of the helicopter. Deacon said he had to wonder how Dollar Bill would handle a bad report card from his child. Brooke stated that she didn't think Bill had meant to kill Ridge. Deacon had heard that plenty of times from inmates in the slammer -- which was exactly where he thought Bill should be headed.\n\n\nDeacon recalled that he'd once behaved like Bill, but Deacon had given it up to become a model citizen. Brooke cynically nodded, but he insisted that he'd had to pay for his misdeeds, while Bill always escaped his, smelling like cheap cologne.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that Bill hadn't tried to kill Ridge. Shrugging, Deacon said he'd promised to get her what she'd wanted -- the truth. She thanked Deacon for helping, because Bill had needed to be exposed, but she was sad because she'd been about to marry Bill. Deacon uttered that feelings like that didn't magically go away. \"Not for anyone,\" he added.\n\n\nDeacon tried to convince Brooke that she didn't need a man like Bill. \"He's a bad guy. I know. I used to be one!\" Deacon declared. She told him not to bad-mouth Bill, whose bad side was probably equivalent to Deacon's good side. Deacon demanded that she say how he could prove that he'd changed, but she said that, if he had to prove it, then it was suspect.\n\n\nThe front door opened, and Deacon scoffed as Bill entered. Sure that Deacon had a meeting with his parole officer to get to, Bill told Deacon to beat it. \"At least I knocked, Billy-boy! I mean, after all, we're both visitors now,\" Deacon retorted.\n\n\nBill asked to talk to Brooke alone about the mistake he'd made; however, she said all the secrets were out, and if it hadn't been for Deacon, she'd still be thinking that Ridge was delusional. To her, the biggest betrayal was Bill having her believe a lie about a loved one.\n\n\nBill decided to apologize in front of the \"stooge.\" Brooke said what Bill had done had been criminal, and Bill had tried to make Ridge think that he was crazy when Ridge had been right. Bill admitted that he'd been wrong, but he insisted that no one forget the part that Ridge had played in things. Bill asked what he should have done while Ridge was punching him in the face and dragging Brooke away. Deacon recalled that Ridge had had a photo of Bill and Quinn with him.\n\n\n\"Will you shut the hell -- \" Bill started to bellow, but he sucked in a hot breath and politely continued, \"Would you please just butt out, Deacon?\" Deacon wouldn't, and Bill offered to take him outside to remind him what it had been like on the cellblock. Brooke screamed at the two men to stop it. She asserted that Deacon was a guest in the house, just as Bill was.\n\n\nBill replied that he'd like to think he was more than a guest. He said he and Brooke had to get beyond it, but Deacon interjected that she was doing fine without Bill. \"Shut up,\" Bill replied. Bill asked Brooke to think about their sacrifices. Not wanting to wait any longer, Bill asked Brooke to say that she'd marry him.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam grimaced and curtly shook his head at Hope, who was awkwardly smiling on stage as Wyatt announced that the diamond was hers to keep. Reporters asked Hope what her decision was, and one reporter wondered how Hope could not take a jewel that embodied her and the line.\n\n\nWyatt said that he'd given it to Hope once, and he was asking her in front of the world if she accepted the HFTF diamond. Hope gulped and said, \"Yes, I do.\" The room erupted in applause, but Aly and Liam appeared to be hurt and disappointed.\n\n\nA reporter asked Hope to comment on the symbolism of the jewel. She said that it was one-of-a-kind, just like her line and message. Jarrett added that the diamond represented romance. Hope tried to dodge the comment, but reporters persisted in knowing if she'd just dismiss what she and Wyatt had shared. Hope stuttered, and Wyatt asked the reporters to keep the interview professional.\n\n\nThe reporters insisted that the diamond had put Wyatt and Hope on the map professionally and personally, beginning with the Mexico adventure. Wyatt stated that there was no adventure; there was only Wyatt entrusting Hope with the stone after Ricardo Montemayor had given it to him.\n\n\nHope spotted Liam exiting. Handing Wyatt the diamond, she asked him to handle it from there. As Hope scampered off after Liam, Wyatt asked for a moment of silence for Ricardo.\n\n\nAfter the conference, people lingered around to talk. Rick was shocked that Ricardo had willed Wyatt the diamond. Maya asked to meet some of Wyatt's friends. Ivy thought it was generous to allow Hope to use it for the line, but Wyatt stated that the diamond was Hope's to keep. Rick was surprised that Wyatt had been sincere about the gift.\n\n\nAcross the room with Oliver, Aly glared at Wyatt. When Ivy approached, Aly murmured that it had been more like a performance than a press conference. Aly and Ivy were in agreement that Wyatt was playing Hope by presenting the diamond in front of Liam and the press. Ivy and Aly felt bad for Liam, and they agreed that Wyatt had put Hope on the spot. Ivy believed it was wrong and that neither Hope nor Liam should accept it.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Hope caught up to Liam. \"What was that?\" Liam demanded to know. Hope swore that she'd been about to give the diamond back, but she'd walked into a room full of reporters. Liam asked how it was that Hope couldn't see what Wyatt was doing.\n\n\nHope responded that Wyatt was working the media, which he was good at. Liam snipped that Wyatt was working Hope. She asked Liam not to be that way and expressed excitement about the response the diamond had gotten. She claimed that her line needed it because it hadn't been the same since the diamond had returned to Mexico.\n\n\nHope asserted that it was only business. \"Not to my brother!\" Liam argued. She alleged that Wyatt knew she and Liam were together and \"talking marriage.\" The frustrated Liam asked when it had ever stopped Wyatt. She asked Liam not to make an issue out of something that wasn't an issue.\n\n\n\"You think that he gave you this diamond, arranged a press conference, presented it to you for the whole world to see -- for business? For business? No, he did it because he believes that diamond has a hold on you. Now, you tell me, Hope, does it? Does it?\" Hope claimed that it didn't, and Liam urged her to tell Wyatt that by returning the diamond that instant.\n\n\nHope explained that it wasn't about her and Wyatt; it was business and publicity. Liam told her not to act na\u00efve with him, but she insisted that Wyatt knew Liam and Hope were together and on their way to marriage. Liam snipped that her point made Wyatt's actions all the more inappropriate.\n\n\nHope said she was sorry that they were seeing it differently. Liam insisted that a man didn't give an engaged woman a diamond as a business move, and he couldn't understand why she couldn't see it.\n\n\nOutside the door, the approaching Wyatt overheard Hope insisting that her line needed it. Liam contended that it wasn't about sales; it was about Hope being played. Disbelieving that anyone was getting played, she said the diamond would be for publicity -- period. She planned to wear it at events and display it in the boutique. \"Other than that, it means nothing. I am committed to you,\" she stated.\n\n\n\"Do you not see how disrespectful this is to me? How insulting to me?\" Liam asked. Hope looked down as he added that everyone at the press conference had seen it, and they'd sopped it up with all their questions about romance. He was sure she thought she'd handled it, but he told her to make no mistake -- the romance would be the story and the center of the publicity.\n\n\nWyatt popped into the room and expressed excitement about Hope being back in the spotlight. Wyatt asked what Liam thought. Liam quipped that Wyatt was doing what he did best -- manipulating. Wyatt joked that reporters lived to be manipulated.\n\n\nThe angry Liam said he wasn't talking about the press; he was talking about Hope. \"What? You feel manipulated?\" Wyatt asked in a surprised voice. He asked what was wrong with Liam and stated that they'd just been getting along. Liam agreed that they'd been on that path until he'd realized that his \"bro\" was still working it and hadn't changed at all.\n\n\nWyatt excitedly asked if Liam had seen the response in the showroom. Wyatt was sure people would talk about the diamond for months, and it would translate into sales. Liam differed, exclaiming that they'd be talking about \"Hope and Wyatt -- oh, how romantic!\" Hope claimed it would happen only if they let it, but they wouldn't let it.\n\n\nWyatt reasoned that Liam had seen how Wyatt had handled the personal questions, but Liam asserted that there should be no personal questions because Hope was involved with another man. Wyatt dismissively said reporters would think what they'd think, but Liam corrected that reporters would think what one led them to think. Wyatt claimed that it had just been buzz and publicity.\n\n\nLiam rasped that Wyatt hadn't needed to give Hope the diamond to use it for publicity. Liam said she didn't need to own it for Wyatt's marketing stunts, but Wyatt had just had to have Hope accept it in front of God and everyone because of the \"power of the diamond.\" Liam declared that his fianc\u00e9e didn't accept jewelry from another man -- period.\n\n\nLiam asked Hope to see it for what it was. He stated that Wyatt was hitting on her because Wyatt believed he still had a chance. \"What?\" Wyatt incredulously murmured. Liam asked if Wyatt did have a chance. Hope said he didn't. Liam decided that, if Hope really meant it, the only solution was for her to give the diamond back and fire Wyatt. \"And this time, I am not accepting anything less,\" Liam declared.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Hounded by the media at the press conference, Hope is put on the spot about whether she will accept Wyatt\u2019s gift. Meanwhile, a helpless Liam is forced to watch Wyatt\u2019s public display of affection for Hope. Knowing what kind of man that Bill is, Deacon implores a torn Brooke to sever all ties with him. Refusing to lose Brooke over the incident with Ridge, Bill makes one last ditch effort to win her back.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt holds the diamond to Hope and says he promised her the diamond. It's hers. All she has to do is say yes. Bill sits around and mopes but tells Alison that he will not lose Brooke over this. He will do whatever it takes to get her back. Alison says Brooke without a man is like a ship without a rudder, and Bill is that rudder. She will come back to him in time. The press ask Hope what she is going to do. Wyatt says he gave it to her once, now he is giving it to her in front of the whole world. She says yes she does accept it, the audience applauds . but Liam glowers. He hears the press say romance and he walks out. Hope sees him and gives Wyatt the diamond to take over. She follows Liam. He wants to know what the hell was that? She told him she was going to give the diamond back. She begs him not to over-react on this. She was going to give it back. That was before she walked into a room full of media. Wyatt was just working the room; he's really good at that. She thought that was great in there. They need this. Liam rants that Wyatt did not give her that diamond for business. He thinks it has a hold on Hope. If it doesn't, then she needs to tell Wyatt and - she has to give it back to him right now. Wyatt tells the audience that Ricardo was a man of great class and he'd like to take a moment of silence in his memory. Aly pouts and tells both Ivy and Oliver that Wyatt is using the diamond to get Hope back. Ivy agrees it was disrespectful of Wyatt, and Liam should not put up with this. Hope keeps telling Liam this is not about Wyatt and her. This is all about publicity. Liam says she can't be that naive. She says Wyatt knows they are going to be married. He says all the more reason that it is so inappropriate. She says she is sorry. She guesses they are just seeing this differently. Deacon tells Brooke that he used to be like that too \u0096 fire at will and forget the consequences. But that got him in a lot of trouble and he gave it up. Now he's the model citizen. And the difference in him and Bill is that he paid his debt. Bill comes out of the cesspool and smells like cheap cologne. He has never gotten payback for what he did to Brooke, Katie or Hope. Brooke fell in love with him, Hope forgave him and Katie gave him back is company. He is the one who needs to be taught a lesson. Brooke says he is learning. Deacon says he has never seen her like this, not even with Ridge. Bill has certainly raised the bar. Brooke says yes it was a stupid, reckless act but he did not try to kill Ridge. Brooke tells Deacon that she appreciates he brought Bill to their attention. He needed to be exposed. Bill walks in and accuses Deacon of missing his parole officer, so beat it. Deacon says at least he knocked first. They are both visitors now. Bill says he wants private time with Brooke. She asks why since there are no more secrets. And if it had not been for Deacon she would still be believing Ridge was delusional and Bill did that to someone she loved. Bill tells Brooke okay fine he will say it in front of the stooge. He screwed up. He made a mistake. He's human. Deacon utters that is debatable. Brooke says what he did was also criminal and then he made it worse by lying to her about it as if he knew nothing. He says what was he supposed to do, just stand there and wave goodbye to Ridge and turn the other cheek? Deacon brings up the snapshot and Bill tells him to go to hell. He tells Brooke to please butt out Deacon or he will have to take him outside and remind him of the cellblock dates. Brooke barks they both need to shut up. Deacon is a guest in this house just as Bill is. Bill says he'd like to think he is more than a guest. They have to get past it. He lists again how far they have come and they can't let this tear them apart. They have sacrificed too much and he can't wait any longer. He wants her to marry him. Wyatt walks up outside the office so he can hear that Hope says her line needs this. No one is playing her. She will wear it for publicity only, that is it. She says other than that it means nothing. She is committed to him. He still continues how disrespectful and insulting it is to him .how the press ate it up when they tied in the romance. And make no mistake, that will be their story. Wyatt chooses then to walk in and all happy face says Hope is back in the news. Liam says yes and doing what he does best \u0096 manipulating. Wyatt says the press can not be manipulated. Liam says not the press; he is talking about Hope. Wyatt asks Hope if she feels manipulated. Liam jumps in when Wyatt says he was working the room; he was beating the drums. The press will be talking about this for six months and sales will skyrocket. Liam accuses him of working it to get Hope and his fiance should not be accepting diamonds from another man. Period! Wyatt is hitting on her because he thinks he has another chance. He needs to know if he does. Hope says no. Liam says okay then this is what needs to happen. She has to fire him and give the diamond back and this time he will accept nothing less.",
