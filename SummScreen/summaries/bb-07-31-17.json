    "soap_central": "\n\nOn the hotel rooftop overlooking the pier, Bill asked Brooke if she could smell it. She thought he meant jasmine and the sea. \"Money,\" Bill corrected. He whipped out play money with his face on it and sniffed it. Brooke giggled, saying it wasn't real. \"In Bill we trust,\" he said. He planned to hand the bills out at the event to encourage bidding to raise money for the Spencer charities.\n\n\nBill said it was his two favorite things. Brooke hoped she was one of them. He corrected that it was three favorites, Brooke being the first. Sighing, he asked where else he could have a mixture of yachts and skyscrapers. Brooke was surprised that skyscrapers didn't make Bill want to cry. Remarking about his unbuilt skyscraper back home, she said Sally and Thomas had become a team, and Brooke didn't see them crumbling anytime soon.\n\n\nIn a reception tent later, Bill stood near a Spencer banner that promoted children's charities. He handed his play money out to the guests. Sally arrived and said she'd seen the Stella Maurice in the harbor. She was waiting to receive her phone invite. Bill corrected that the boat was called, \"the Stella -- never mind.\"\n\n\nChowing on the appetizers, Sally said she could really get used to \"this.\" Bill murmured a suggestion that she didn't. She asked what he'd said, and he replied that he bet she could. She thought Bill could show her the ropes. Saying that he was trying to look out for her, he outright said she shouldn't get to used to it. Sally believed that Spectra's top-notch designs could win a fair show and said, \"No dirty tricks.\"\n\n\nSally strode off, and Bill saw a call on his phone. He sent it to voicemail. He went out to the rooftop, where Steffy was ending a call with Liam. Bill said Liam should fly in for the victory party. Lowering her phone, Steffy said they needed to win first. \"Done,\" Bill replied.\n\n\n\"No. Whoa, Bill. We're doing this fair and square,\" Steffy said. Bill cocked his head. Steffy conveyed that she didn't like the competition getting jammed down her throat, but she wouldn't cheat against her brother. Bill replied that her brother had left his niece to raise a child alone, and Bill didn't have a lot of respect for Thomas. Steffy asked what it had to do with anything. \"Everything,\" Bill answered.\n\n\nIn New York, Caroline left a message for Bill, saying she was back in New York. She wanted Thomas to be with her and Douglas, but she asserted that telling Thomas that she was dying wasn't right. She couldn't keep it up and wanted Bill to call her back.\n\n\nIn Spectra's tent, Thomas gave out instructions to workers. Sally noticed that he looked preoccupied. She encouraged him about the event and said nothing could stand in their way.\n\n\nIn Rick and Maya's hotel room, Maya was anxiously bouncing Lizzy, who had a fever. It wouldn't go down, and Maya refused to leave her. Rick decided to call Katie to find a substitute model.\n\n\nLater, a doctor had just finished seeing Lizzy. He said she just needed fluids, rest, and love. It wasn't serious, and many kids got sick while traveling. He recognized Maya, and Rick said she was supposed to be modeling in the show.\n\n\nThe doctor asked if Maya hadn't attended due to a petite fever. Maya said she'd wanted to be sure. The doctor thought it was unfortunate for the guests. He said something to Rick in French. Maya asked if the statement had been good. Rick said it was more than good, and she was breathtaking. Maya thanked the doctor.\n\n\nIn Forrester's tent, workers bustled, and Nicole expressed excitement to Zende about his first fashion show with Eric and Ridge. Zende was nervous, but Nicole felt he'd be fine once he got out there to model. Modeling was the very thing Zende was worried about.\n\n\nMusic played over a montage of scenes of people arriving on the long stretch of pier. Katie and Eva handed out play money, people had drinks, and Brooke and Steffy socialized. In the reception tent, Wyatt found Bill to make sure Bill didn't have anything up his sleeve, but as they heard Steffy opening the show outside, Bill told Wyatt to relax and get out of there.\n\n\nOutside, on a platform that resembled the deck of a boat, Steffy got the show started and explained to the guests that the Spencer money represented their bids for the swim and cruise wear show. She figured they'd all downloaded the Spencer voting app to vote for Forrester or Spectra. She urged them to vote. Music played, and the show commenced.\n\n\nBrooke led the Forrester models in the first group of cruise wear on one side of the U-shaped platform. Spectra designs were on the other side of it. The camera panned phones as the guests voted for each fashion house. Nicole led the first round of Zende's swimwear against Spectra's.\n\n\nAs the show went on, Bill daydreamed about a ribbon-cutting ceremony for Spencer Tower. He grinned to himself, but his grin faded when he locked eyes with Sally, who was smiling at him.\n\n\nThomas stood alone by a table. Steffy approached. She remarked that he was getting a good response, but he was still going down. He murmured that they'd see. She bumped shoulders with him and said she was just messing with him. She thought his work was good, and he'd get a lot of good publicity.\n\n\nShrugging, Thomas asked if any of it mattered. Steffy asked what he was talking about, and he murmured, \"Douglas.\" Thomas wished he'd been a better father. Steffy decided that it wasn't the time or place to be thinking of about Douglas and Caroline. \"It's a fashion charity event, silly,\" Steffy told him. She patted his arm and strolled off. Thomas continued standing around as if he was at a funeral instead.\n\n\nIn the reception tent, Wyatt mingled, and Katie watched the show on a screen. Brooke approached and congratulated Katie on hitting a home run. She believed Katie was doing great in promotions. Katie said much of it had to do with \"that guy over there.\" Glancing at Wyatt, Brooke said he was pretty good, but Katie was incredible. She urged Katie to take her credit. The sisters hugged, and Katie gazed at Wyatt, who smiled at her.\n\n\nIn a tent, Thomas donned swim trunks and thought of Caroline dying. Sally asked if he heard the applause. She thought they were getting almost as much as Forrester. She hoped Bill wouldn't ruin it because they deserved it as much as the Foresters. Thomas stated that Sally was the one who deserved it.\n\n\nIn Forrester's tent, Zende was still worried. He told Nicole that he wasn't ready for it. She cooed, saying the ladies were. Zende and Thomas were announced on the mic, and they led the men's wear segment.\n\n\nNext, Katie announced the showstoppers, modeled by Steffy and Sally. As the ladies modeled, Bill slipped into the Spectra tent. He told Thomas that Thomas had done well. \"Now it's time to be a man,\" Bill stated. He said that Thomas' son needed Thomas, and so did Caroline, who was dying. Bill said Thomas knew what he had to do because Caroline and Douglas needed Thomas in New York.\n\n\nBack on the U-shaped stage, the models gathered around Katie at its base. She said it was time for their esteemed host to announce the winner, and she introduced the one and only Dollar Bill Spencer. Bill kissed Katie's cheek and took her place on stage with the models.\n\n\nBill thanked everyone for attending the event, and he said it was time to announce the winner. \"And that winner is -- \" Bill whipped out his phone. On the screen, it said Spectra had received the most votes. \"That winner is me,\" Bill concluded, and people looked confused.\n\n\nBill continued, saying that the winners were also the children who they were helping with the money raised that day. He said it wasn't a fashion challenge in the sense that the votes weren't tallied. It was about the bidding and their generosity in helping children all over the world. \"And how much money did we raise?\" Bill asked. Looking at his phone, he said it was just over one million, one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n\nEveryone applauded. Wyatt ran out of the reception tent and found Katie by a railing. She asked if he'd heard. Wyatt stated that it was a tie. Katie meant about the money and repeated the sum. Wyatt replied that it was what he'd heard. She exclaimed that they'd done it, and in their excitement, Wyatt kissed her. They stared at each other for several moments before kissing again, deeper and longer.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "In Monaco, both fashion houses prepare for the big charity event which will debut the companies' swimwear collections. Nicole is extremely proud of Zende who will not only display his first ever designs, but also hit the runway. Rick supports Maya's decision to back out of her modeling commitment when Lizzy comes down with a sudden fever.

Meanwhile, a frantic Caroline gives Bill a call to tell him that she cannot keep up with the lie he told Thomas. The fashion show in Monte Carlo harbor receives rave applause. Katie thanks Wyatt for his support - who responds with a kiss. As Bill takes the spotlight after the fashion challenge, he is dismayed to learn that Spectra Fashions received the most votes.
