    "tvmega_recap": "Liam stands at the crib and listens as Phoebe calls him Dada. Douglas right behind tells Liam that is Beth. Liam is bewildered. He says that is Phoebe. Douglas retorts that Phoebe is Beth. He looks at Douglas and says that is impossible. Douglas says that Phoebe is Beth. She is alive. Thomas asks Hope how does she think it makes him feel for her to be thinking of Liam. He is her husband, not Liam. She says you cannot just chose those things that easily. He says she can. She just needs to move on and put that in the past; then a life with him. He assures her that he is not upset with her. He knows she wants to take it slow and that is fine. He says he actually prefers it that way; it is more romantic. And what is more romantic that room service for two with music ad candlelight. Hope nods yes. He grabs the menu and says there is no hurry; they have all night. Flo rushes home to try and find Wyatt. When she realizes he is not home she texts him that it is important that she see him. Shauna walks in saying she was concerned about her. Flo tells her not to start; she cannot keep the secret any longer. She tells her a few more things about a dangerous Thomas who blew up the car of Hope's brother. He is that kind of guy. And no she cannot change what she did, but she can change her actions as of today. She is going to give Hope back her baby today. She wants to tell Wyatt because she loves him and trusts him and wants him to hear it from her first. She does not know what will happen between them then but she knows he will help Hope and Liam. Finally they will know their little girl is alive. Liam gets down on his hands and knees to look eyeball to eyeball with Douglas and says he wishes this were true. Douglas says it is true. Liam asks if he dreamed it. Douglas says no, he heard it. Liam questions who would tell him such a thing. Douglas remembers his dad telling him not to tell but he does tell Liam; it was his dad. Thomas is getting ready for room service when Vinny calls. He says he heard that Thomas got hitched so congratulations. Thomas says he will have to cut the conversation short as room service is at the door. Vinny says okay but he has a little gift for him that he and the lucky lady will enjoy. Liam and Douglas come out of the nursery and Steffy asks if everything is all right. Liam says not exactly. She tells Douglas that he should not make up lies again. Douglas says he didn't. She says she and Liam need to talk so Douglas can run up and play video games for a little while. He turns to Liam and says he hopes he is not mad at him. But his mommy taught him to always tell the truth. It took her a while to learn that, but it is important. Alone with Liam, Steffy says maybe he did it for attention. He asks if she heard any of the dialogue on her monitor. She says no, she was on her laptop with e-mails. Slowly he walks her through it, Douglas staring at Phoebe, saying Beth was alive and finally that she is here. Phoebe is Beth. Then she really is confused when Liam says Douglas said his dad told him that. She thinks maybe he misheard it. Liam gets a phone call before he can respond. It's from the hospital that he has been trying to reach so he tells Steffy he needs to take this. From a Dr. Cortez he learns that no one named Flo Fulton gave birth around the date that Liam gave her and it was not her as she was out of the country then. He needs to get this information from Ms. Fulton himself. He relays this to Steffy. The doctor's name is on the birth certificate but Flo lied. Thomas pays the guy for room service and with a wink asks him to put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Hope notices he ordered champagne. Thomas says of course; it is a celebration. Thomas pours the champagne and hands it to Hope. He says Beth is looking down on her and wants her to be happy and have that joy of being with Douglas and him will bring her. He gets another phone call which he says is work. Hope tells him to go ahead and get it as she could use a little time herself. She takes a deep sigh and says move on but all she can see is Liam. Steffy is unbelieving and combative with Liam. Perhaps there was a clerical error; does not mean Flo lied. He says Wyatt thinks she never gave birth and the hospital verified that she was not a patient there. Steffy blurts out then Phoebe was born somewhere else. Liam has a pained look and says .Catalina. He gasps that Douglas was right Beth. He heads directly to her room. He whispers Beth before he picks her up as Steffy watches. He crumbles as he strokes her face, crying a little as she calls him Dada again and he says yes he is her Dada.",
