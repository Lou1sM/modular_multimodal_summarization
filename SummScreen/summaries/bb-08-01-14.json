    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Deacon was amused by Bill's groveling. Bill and Deacon sniped at each other until Brooke asked Deacon to refrain. Bill focused on Brooke, saying that they were worth fighting for, and he regretted hurting Ridge. Deacon clapped for what he called Bill's show and said that, in truth, Bill would dump Ridge from a chopper that very day if Bill knew Brooke wouldn't find out about it.\n\n\nBrooke said that Bill had seen her pain, but he'd said nothing. Bill claimed that it was because he hadn't wanted to see the look she had on her face right then. \"I do love you,\" the torn Brooke uttered. He said that he loved her, too, and he asked if it was enough.\n\n\nBrooke looked away, and Deacon told Bill to give her some time. Lifting her chin to look into her eyes, Bill asked her to say it was enough. Brooke said that it wasn't something that she could get over, and she just needed some time. Bill cupped her face and said he'd never give up on them. Brooke shed tears as Bill exited her house.\n\n\nDeacon complained about the arrogant Bill Spencer, who Deacon also thought was conceited and stubborn, and Brooke asked if Deacon was talking about himself instead of Bill. Deacon asked if Brooke was considering going back to Bill. She revealed that she was. \"Well, then, you ought to consider me,\" Deacon responded.\n\n\nBrooke looked confused. Deacon said that he knew it seemed to be from right field, but if Bill could almost kill Ridge but get a second chance, then Deacon should deserve one, too. Brooke reminded him that what they'd shared had happened a while back. Deacon asserted that he wanted her back. \"Um, Deacon, if you haven't noticed, I'm in the middle of -- \" Brooke started to say.\n\n\nDeacon said she was in the middle of breaking up with Bill, which was why Deacon was putting himself out there. Brooke corrected that she hadn't said she was breaking up with Bill. Deacon was sure she would do so after what Bill had done. She asked if Deacon wanted a list of his past misdeeds. Deacon acknowledged his bad deeds but said he was ready to move beyond them and be a father.\n\n\nBrooke thought that was great, and she wouldn't interfere if Hope wanted him in her life. Deacon said he also wanted himself and Brooke to be parents. She noted that Hope was an adult, and the time for that had passed. He told Brooke that it was never too late to fix what should have been.\n\n\nDeacon revealed that he'd never thought Ridge would be out of the picture, but Ridge was. \"Don't go back to Bill. Come to me,\" Deacon beckoned and lassoed Brooke into his arms for a kiss.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy told Aly that, where Ivy was from, a woman engaged to one man didn't accept jewelry from another man. Ivy and Aly wondered how things were unfolding between Wyatt, Liam, and Hope, and they decided to eavesdrop outside the CEO's office to find out.\n\n\nInside the CEO's office, Wyatt said the diamond gift had nothing to do with Liam's feelings, and it had been about a promise that Wyatt had wanted to keep. Unable to believe that he'd trusted Wyatt, Liam insisted that, if Hope had any respect for him, she'd give back the diamond and tell Wyatt to never walk through the Forrester doors again.\n\n\nLiam had thought that he and his half-brother had reached an understanding and had formed appropriate boundaries, but he'd realized that he was wrong about it. Liam felt that Wyatt needed to hear it from Hope. Hope said the gift wasn't grounds for dismissal, but Liam called it an effrontery to their relationship. Wyatt told Liam to dial back the possessive boyfriend thing.\n\n\nLiam noted that Wyatt and Hope had bonded over the diamond, and the whole world knew it. Liam couldn't believe that Hope didn't understand the problem with that. Hope said that she wouldn't fire Wyatt, and she was keeping the diamond. \"Okay,\" Liam bit out and strode out of the office. Hope looked distraught and called after him, but he kept going.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Aly and Ivy hid out of sight until Liam had gone, and then Ivy decided that she couldn't keep listening outside the door. Ivy went to the sky lounge, where she discovered Liam in deep thought. She told him that she couldn't believe what had happened. Liam murmured that it was the \"damned diamond,\" and he felt like he was cursed.\n\n\nLiam couldn't believe that it had \"come to this.\" He stated that if Ivy only knew. Ivy responded that she knew about the weddings and the engagements. He told her that something had always gotten in the way. Ivy referred to Steffy, but Liam added Bill, Wyatt, and the diamond to the list of obstacles.\n\n\nIvy asserted that it was totally inappropriate for Hope to accept the diamond. Ivy called it disrespectful, and Liam was relieved that someone else saw it his way. She assumed it was for the best because if Liam had already married Hope, then his wife would have been accepting another man's diamond. Ivy figured that, as painful as it was, Liam had gotten to see what Wyatt really meant to Hope.\n\n\nIvy believed that Liam would look back one day and see the good that had resulted from the fallout. Liam stated that he'd walked out on his future, the life he'd planned for himself, and also his brother. \"Trust me. Nothing good is gonna come from this,\" he concluded.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Aly charged in and immediately began accusing Wyatt of luring Hope away from Liam with the diamond. Aly asked if Wyatt had any integrity and reminded him that it was his brother that he was messing with.\n\n\nWyatt's phone rang, and as he answered it, Aly asked Hope to not let Wyatt manipulate her again. Wyatt told the caller that he didn't think he could leave, but Aly told him to go so that she could talk to Hope alone. He left, and the tearful Hope shook her head.\n\n\nHope told Aly that Liam had wanted Hope to fire Wyatt and return the diamond. \"Well, couldn't you have for Liam?\" Aly asked. Hope felt that Liam was overreacting and asking for too much. She said it wasn't fair, and Wyatt wasn't doing what Liam thought. On the verge of sobs, Hope exclaimed that Liam had just walked out. She said they'd worked so hard to be together, but she was losing him.\n\n\nAly didn't think Liam's departure from the office meant what Hope was thinking, but Hope sadly replied that she hadn't done what he'd wanted. Aly reasoned that Liam was just upset, and Hope and Liam weren't breaking up over it. Aly asked Hope to change her mind and to not push Liam away.\n\n\nHope said there was a difference between a private life and a professional life, and she'd learned to separate the two. Hope felt that if Liam couldn't see that it was all marketing and that the diamond was the key to her line's success, then maybe she and Liam didn't work for a reason.\n\n\nAly asserted that Liam did understand, but Wyatt had interfered before. Aly believed that Hope was putting her professional life ahead of her personal life, which was crazy. Aly decided that the diamond was jinxed. Hope murmured that it was supposed to provide luck. \"Yeah, bad luck -- like Wyatt and his mother. If you are really making this choice, it will only bring trouble,\" Aly concluded.\n\n\nAt Quinn's loft, Wyatt arrived. \"Hello? I'm here,\" he said as he entered. Quinn strode toward him and said she hadn't been sure he'd meet her. Wyatt asserted that there was no way she'd been released that soon, but smiling, Quinn said she'd voluntarily checked herself in for treatment. \"It hasn't even been that long. If you're trying to tell me that everything is fine -- \" Wyatt started to say.\n\n\nQuinn told Wyatt to relax because she was still in treatment. She asked if he was glad to see her. Wyatt was, but he was also dubious about her state of mind. She replied that she was working on her issues, and she regretted losing control. She was ashamed of the danger she'd put Liam in, but she insisted that treatment was helping. She promised not to go down that dark path again.\n\n\n\"Well, you can't,\" Wyatt warned. Quinn asked if he believed her, and he said that he did. She wanted him to fill her in on what she'd missed. He sadly told her that Ricardo had died, and she asked if Ricardo had been sick. Wyatt replied that he didn't know, but he'd been in Ricardo's will. She was surprised to hear that but grew excited when she realized what it meant for the diamond.\n\n\nWyatt explained that he'd already given the diamond to Hope, and Liam had gone into full-on jealousy mode because she'd accepted it. Wyatt wondered if the diamond really had super powers, because it had driven Liam away.\n\n\nQuinn was overjoyed to hear that Hope hadn't given it back when Liam had told her to do so. She decided that Liam didn't understand women at all. She figured that she'd almost ruined things for Wyatt by going after Liam, and \"we\" should have known that all \"we\" had to do was wait for Liam to mess up. Wyatt told Quinn to let it be a lesson to her that things always worked out in the end.\n\n\nWyatt received a phone call. He looked at his phone and remarked that it was odd to get a call from a Mexican area code. When Wyatt answered, the caller told him that he was a lieutenant from the Mexico City police department. The lieutenant asked if Wyatt had been an acquaintance of Ricardo Montemayor, and Wyatt asked if the call was about Ricardo.\n\n\nThe lieutenant asked if Wyatt would be in Los Angeles because he was making arrangements to meet Wyatt. Wyatt asked what it was about. The lieutenant said they'd thought that Mr. Montemayor's death had been an accident, but a new possibility had arisen. \"Such as?\" Wyatt asked. The lieutenant responded, \"Murder. I'll contact you when I'm in town.\"\n\n\nAfter the call, Wyatt looked grim. \"Who was that, honey?\" Quinn unassumingly asked. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "About as forceful as he can, Wyatt tells Liam this was a promise he made Hope a long time ago about giving her the diamond and he's only fulfilling that promise. Liam says even though he knows how Liam feels. Wyatt says it is not about his feelings at all. Liam says Wyatt made a promise to him too. He trusted him and now he pulls this. And how he even came in possession of that diamond is ridiculous. Aly and Ivy continue to gossip and Ivy says where she comes from you don't accept jewelry from one man while engaged to another. Aly convinces her to go listen in while Wyatt is talking. He just can't brainwash Hope again. Liam turns to Hope and says she is playing right into Wyatt's hand. Surely she can see that. She tells him she knows it may look that way but it's just good for Forrester. Liam says this is not about her line. This is about trust. And if she respects him then she will give Wyatt back the diamond and tell him never to walk through those doors again. He's told Wyatt about boundaries but clearly he needs to hear it from her. That yes, he is fired. Hope says this is not grounds for dismissal. Liam rants that it is beyond what is appropriate. He tells Wyatt that this diamond is what brought them together and the whole world knows that. And yet she does not see a problem with that. She tells him firmly that she is not going to fire Wyatt and she is keeping the diamond. Liam says one word \u0096 okay and storms off. Tears well up in Hope's eyes. They let Liam pass but then Aly goes into the room and storms at Wyatt that he just couldn't let this pass. He's luring Hope again with the diamond and hurting his own brother. Wyatt gets a phone call. Aly says if he needs to go somewhere she needs to talk to Hope alone. She tries to convince Hope not to let Wyatt manipulate her again. Bill tells Brooke that he made a mistake. He admits that. Deacon mocks him for groveling. Bill tells him surely there is a license plate he needs to go make. Brooke tries to quiet Deacon so she can listen to Bill. Bill says he doesn't want to say anything in front of this loser but he will as long as she hears it. He screwed up, he knows it and he learned from it. They are worth fighting for and they can't throw away what they have. It won't be easy; he's not easy but they love each other and have to get past this. He says he didn't realize how dangerous it would be for Ridge. He saw an opportunity and took it. He regrets that it hurt Brooke. Deacon says he is just hurt that he got caught. Bill tells the convict to shut up. Deacon claps his hands and says it is all show and a fake; all for Brooke. He'd throw Ridge out of a helicopter now if he thought she would not find out. He'd say anything to make her forget what he did. Bill tells mug shot to shut up. He doesn't expect her to forget just forgive and move on. She reminds him that she was in pain and yet he said nothing. He says only because he did not want to see the look on her face that she has right now. He tells her that he loves her and he hopes that is enough. She says she needs time. Deacon pipes up that she doesn't want to deal with Bill right now. Bill cups her face with both hands and says he will never give up on them. When Bill is gone Deacon asks Brooke if she is even considering going back to him as he is not going to change. If so, then consider him too. She says what they had was over a long time ago. He says he wants her back. She says she is sort of in the middle of something and she could make a list of all the things Deacon has done wrong over the years. He agrees but says he is trying to do better and be a good dad. Brooke says okay and she is not interfering. Whatever choice Hope makes about him is her own. He says he wants them to be parents. She says Hope is an adult so the time for that is past. Deacon says he never thought she would ever leave Ridge but now that she has do not go back to Bill but come to him. He surprises her with a kiss. Not sure how to respond she pulls away. Ivy follows Liam out to the Rooftop. He says he just needed some air; he feels like with this diamond he is cursed. She tells him maybe this happened for the best. At least he is not married to Hope when this happened. He says he lost his fiance and a brother and the life he wanted for himself and he walked out on them. Nothing good is coming from this. Wyatt goes to the warehouse loft and announces he is there. Quinn slowly walks out and says she was not sure he would come. He closes the door and says no way she could have been released that soon. She replies that she checked herself in. He says it hasn't been that long so don't tell him that everything is all right; She tells him to relax she is still in treatment. She says she missed him and she hopes he is glad to see her too. He says it hasn't been that long ago that she freaked out and he's supposed to believe that all is okay. She admits she had issues. And she is working on them. She knows what she did was wrong. She hates that she lost control and the danger she put Liam in. She is ashamed but she is so much better in treatment and she will never go down that dark path again. He admits that she can't. She promises she won't. With hesitation he says he believes her. Quinn wants to know if she missed anything; fill her in. Wyatt says okay; first the bad news. Ricardo died. Quinn acts surprised and asked if he was sick. Wyatt says not as far as he knows. The good news \u0096 he was in Ricardo's will and ..Quinn jumps up and says the diamond? Wyatt says yeah and he's already given it to Hope. She thinks that is fantastic even though she knows Hope is still with Liam. He tells her Liam flipped out but Hope did not give back the diamond. He says he's not sure the diamond has super powers but hey it drove Liam away. It really is priceless. Quinn remarks on all the times she tried to help Wyatt drive Liam away. When all they had to do was wait and Liam would do that all by himself by screwing up again. He told her to let that be a lesson to her. Everything always works out okay in the end. His phone rings. It is Lt. Barragan from the Mexico Police Department. Wyatt asks what is going on. Quinn can hear his part of the conversation. The Lt. asks if Wyatt knew Ricardo and if he will be in town the next few days as they would like to talk to him about the death. At first they thought it was accidental but now they are looking into murder. Hope tells Aly that Liam is over-reacting and it's not fair. Wyatt is not doing what Liam thinks he is doing. And then he just left after all this time of them working so hard to get back together. And now it feels like she is losing him. Aly begs her to not do this. Do not push Liam away. She can change her mind. Hope says she has separated her personal life from her professional one and this is all for marketing but Liam can not see that. Aly say well now she is putting her professional life before her personal one and that is just crazy. She feels like this diamond is jinxed; it's bringing Hope bad luck. Like Wyatt and his mother and if Hope makes this choice she is only going to be asking for more trouble. Liam tells Ivy that he can't believe it has come to this ..if she only knew what they have been through. She laughs and says she has in the tabloids. He says something is always getting in the way. She says Steffy. He says yeah and his dad, Wyatt, now the diamond. She agrees that is it disrespectful of Wyatt and she totally agrees with Liam about that. He wishes Hope felt that way.",
