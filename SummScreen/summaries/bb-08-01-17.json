    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Brooke and Bill discussed the fashion show. Brooke wanted to know who had really won: Spectra or Forrester, but Bill maintained that the charities were the real winners. Brooke insisted she wanted the truth.\n\n\nBill refused to answer and said they would spend some time celebrating at the club and then head back to his yacht for some alone time while the rest of the crew headed back to Los Angeles on his private plane. He made stallion noises, and Brooke laughed. She said he made her melt every time he made that noise. Brooke left to change.\n\n\nBill looked at his phone and saw the tabulated results for most votes received at the fashion show. It was Spectra that had won. Bill shook his head, and his phone rang. It was Caroline.\n\n\nCaroline told Bill she had been calling him. He replied that he'd been busy with the summit, but she was stressing about the lie he had concocted about her dying. Bill warned her not to stress because it would kill her. \"That's not funny,\" she said. She reminded him that Thomas thought she was dying. \"I'm not going along with it any longer,\" she said.\n\n\nBill replied that she needed to go along with it for everyone's sake in order to get Thomas away from \"that trailer park redhead.\" Bill insisted Thomas would be the heroic father who swooped in to be with Caroline and Douglas. Caroline wondered what would happen when everyone discovered that she wasn't sick.\n\n\nBill suggested that a miracle cure could explain it or a misdiagnosis. Caroline said she didn't want Thomas to be with her out of guilt. Bill said it didn't matter. Thomas was a nitwit who needed \"to man up and be a father to his son.\" Bill felt he was giving Thomas a nudge. \"He never stopped loving you. He told me himself,\" Bill said. He could hear Douglas over the phone, asking for Daddy. Bill told her to call Thomas. \"Call him now,\" Bill ordered.\n\n\nCaroline called Thomas, who was standing on the beach in Monte Carlo, waiting for Sally. Caroline asked how the show had gone. Thomas said he believed Spectra would win, but he wasn't sure what Bill had done. Thomas could hear Douglas in the background over the phone, asking for Daddy. Caroline said that Douglas missed his father, and Thomas admitted that he also missed Douglas and had been thinking about him.\n\n\nCaroline said that Douglas didn't stop talking about his daddy. Thomas asked how Caroline was, and he said he was sorry about everything she had gone through. Caroline said she was fine, and she asked Thomas to talk to Douglas. He did, and Caroline thanked him. Caroline had to hang up.\n\n\nThomas was distressed, and Sally showed up. She felt Bill had done something to the results that determined the winner, but she couldn't get any answers from anyone. She thanked Thomas for being there and for all he had done for Spectra. Thomas was nostalgic and said she had moved to Los Angeles to make her dreams come true. Sally smiled.\n\n\nThomas grew serious. He announced that something had come up, and he needed to see Douglas. He missed his son and missed being a father. Sally called him a good man. \"It's not just that. It's Caroline,\" he said. Sally figured he missed her too. \"She's dying,\" Thomas said.\n\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" Sally said. She grew emotional and said that he had been dealing with a lot of issues and worrying about losing the mother of his son. Thomas said he didn't know what to do, but he knew he had to go to New York City and figure it out. He added that no one in the family knew about Caroline's illness. She had wanted to keep it all a secret.\n\n\nThomas wanted to give his son a few months with two parents. He hated that he had to leave. Sally understood. She promised to wait for him. \"I will be here waiting because you're worth it,\" she said. They kissed passionately, and Bill watched from a bridge above the beach. Thomas left, and Sally cried. Bill watched, looked up at a nearby skyscraper, and smiled.\n\n\nAt a park in Monte Carlo, Katie and Wyatt went for a walk and wondered if Spectra could really have won the fashion showdown. Wyatt said he had to commend Katie for a job well done. He noted that the fashion show had been a huge success, and it was time to relax. They agreed they had enjoyed working together. Katie said she hoped they could collaborate on future projects, but she was glad the summit was over.\n\n\nKatie and Wyatt agreed they had been working hard and had jet lag, and all of that explained why they would have kissed each other. Wyatt added that they had raised more than one million dollars for charity.\n\n\nWyatt and Katie agreed they would celebrate success. Katie said there were a million reasons why they had been caught up in the events and had kissed each other. They agreed they should never, ever do it again. They looked at each other and started to make out.\n\n\nIn another area of Monte Carlo, Nicole and Zende gushed that Zende had had a successful fashion show -- his first as a designer. \"My husband, the designer,\" Nicole said. Zende said the best part of the show was seeing Nicole model his designs. They kissed and agreed to celebrate, but Nicole wanted to see Lizzy first. Nicole added that Lizzy had to have been really sick because Maya wouldn't have missed the show for something minor.\n\n\nIn their hotel room in Monte Carlo, Maya and Rick met with the doctor who had treated Lizzy. He said Lizzy needed rest and a lot of liquids to bring down her fever. He said she would be fine by the next morning. He left, and Maya and Rick were grateful Lizzy wasn't seriously ill.\n\n\nNicole and Zende showed up at Maya and Rick's room to check on Lizzy. Nicole admitted it had been a rush to be on the runway, wearing her husband's designs. Maya and Rick teased her that she had the modeling bug.\n\n\nZende discussed that he wanted to celebrate, and Maya and Rick tried to decide who would stay with Lizzy. Rick said he would stay because he had to finish some research for a conference call in the morning. Maya agreed to party with Nicole and Zende, but Nicole said she didn't want to fight her way through a crowd.\n\n\nZende was upset that his wife didn't feel like celebrating with him. Nicole said she was thrilled, but she didn't feel like drinking. She wanted a hot bath and time to relax. She encouraged Zende and Maya to celebrate without her.\n\n\nZende understood, but he wanted his wife to join him. Nicole said she would catch up with Zende and Maya, but she needed a bath first. Zende said that would be fine, and he was happy.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke asks Bill who really won the fashion show \u0096 Spectra or Forrester. He says the kids won with all their bidding for charity; so everyone won. It was a big charity event and very successful. He suggests that everybody find their own way home and they need some alone time on the jet so she can be with her stallion. Alone he checks his phone and sees that Spectra received the most votes. Wyatt and Katie discuss it too and then dismiss their kiss as being caught up in the moment. Katie said they were just celebrating, just a onetime thing. However, she is totally into it when he kisses her again. Zende tells Nicole that the best part of the day was seeing her on the runway. She outdid all the models. Sally asks Thomas if he thinks they could have won but his mind is not on that so he opts out of the discussion. He thinks back on what Bill said about Caroline dying. Rick asks Nicole if modeling is in her future. She laments that she could get used to it. Caroline calls Bill and tells him again that she is not going along with this lie anymore. Bill reminds her that she wants Thomas for her son so it's best to leave it as it is as Thomas and Sally are getting even closer so she needs to split that up fast. Then there will be a miracle cure; Thomas will never know. Thomas needs to man up and be with his son so if he doesn't then they need to give him a nudge. He tells her to hang up and call Thomas now. Zende tries to set up a celebration between him and Nicole and Maya and Rick. Rick says another time as he has a conference time coming up. Nicole too says she is bushed and just wants to take a soaking hot bath but gives permission for Maya who missed all the activities to go with Zende. He wants to talk to Nicole alone. He says he knows she is tired, so is he but this is a milestone and they should stay together. It won't be the same without her by his side. Finally she agrees and tells him to go on and she will catch up with him after a bath. Caroline calls Thomas and lets Douglas call him Daddy. Sally finds Thomas alone in thoughts and says the show is over so now they have time to share. He says it is her time to shine but he needs to be with his son.

He missed out on being a father and now he needs to be there for him .both of Douglas's parents for the few months they have. Sally says she loves him even more. She hates that he is leaving but it is what he has to do. She will be there for him as he is worth it. He is proving that by being there for Caroline and her son.
