Brooke was surprised that Donna's photo session with Ridge had gone so late into the night.  Donna told Brooke that she had the proofs from the shoot, but she wasn't sure if they were any good.  When Bridget looked at them and commented that Donna certainly was not shy, Donna replied that Ridge made her feel like she could do anything.  \n\n\nBrooke was impressed that the pictures had turned out so well, but she was annoyed to find out that Ridge had scheduled another photo shoot for that day without consulting her. Happy that Donna was modeling instead of his wife, Nick thought Brooke should let Ridge have his shoot. Donna couldn't believe Ridge had not told her about the shoot and offered to have it canceled, but Brooke pretended it was no big deal and went along with it. \n\n\nDonna hugged her sister and said Brooke wouldn't be sorry.  However, Brooke looked doubtful. After Donna left, Bridget worried that Brooke was sacrificing too much by allowing Donna to take over her spot.  Brooke assured Bridget that she was fine with Donna becoming the new model. Brooke just wanted to ensure that it was a positive experience for her sister.  Nick told Brooke she needed to relax, because Donna was having a good time with it. He was annoyed when Brooke told him she wanted to stop by the shoot, before heading to Marone. \n\n\nAt Thorne's, Phoebe and Taylor dropped by.  While Thorne was checking on Alexandria, Taylor tried to muster up the courage to tell him the truth.  Phoebe argued that Taylor couldn't tell Alexandria, the little girl who she has been taking care of and loving, that Taylor was responsible for the little girl's mother's death.  Taylor didn't think she could live with the lie, but Phoebe said Taylor had to for her family and for Alexandria. \n\n\nThorne returned; he hugged Taylor and thanked her for stopping over.  He explained that Alexandria was having a tough morning and he hadn't known who else to call.  Taylor hugged him and spent some time with Alexandria.  When Taylor and Thorne were alone, he tells her he knew she had a drinking problem and he would go to an AA meeting with her if she wanted him to.  Thorne's generous offer to help only made Taylor feel guiltier.  \n\n\nThorne insisted on taking Taylor to a meeting.  When they got there, Taylor did not want to admit that she had a drinking problem. Listening to one of the members talk about all the horrible things that could happen from drinking, Taylor had a flashback to killing Darla.  When Taylor had to introduce herself, she talked about Darla's death first.  Then she admitted that she had a drinking problem and wanted to do the right thing to honor Darla. Wracked with guilt, she burst into tears and Thorne hugged her.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Forrester, Stephanie asked Ridge about his doctor's appointment, and was glad to hear that he had gotten a clean bill of health.  She told him she was worried that Donna wouldn't be able to hack it as a model, but Ridge said he was excited about working with her. Stephanie couldn't believe he was taking losing Brooke so well. When Ridge showed her the sexy pictures he had taken of Donna, she began to understand. \n\n\nDonna and the photographer walked in and began preparing for the shoot.  Stephanie picked up on the growing chemistry between Donna and Ridge. At the beginning of the photo shoot, Donna was very nervous, however, Ridge was able to relax her and coax her into being sexy.  Brooke walked in and saw him giving Donna some hands-on direction and became jealous. \n\n\nAfter Ridge's encouragement, Donna hammed it up in front of the camera, basking in all of the attention, just like her big sister would. When Ridge saw Brooke was at the shoot, he told her Donna was going to be a big hit. Brooke didn't look happy.  When Brooke saw the proofs from the shoot, she acted like they were too provocative.  Ridge disagreed and told her it was time for a change.  He told her the campaign with Donna was going to be bigger than anything she could imagine. \n\n\nBrooke had her doubts, but Ridge's enthusiasm persuaded her. After Brooke left, Donna walked out and Ridge told her she was going to be a huge success. Brooke popped back in and was shocked to see Donna and Ridge kissing.  After Ridge left, Brooke confronted Donna and demanded that Donna never kiss Ridge again.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Donna declines breakfast of croissants; girl's got to watch her figure. Brooke snarks that she needs her sleep too. Ridge seems to have kept her real busy last night. Donna shares some photos from last night's shoot. Bridget and all think WOW. But, Nick wonders if Ridge is calling all the shots, is Brooke CEO or is he? Brooke gives in this once; it's too late to cancel anything now. But, she goes back on her word and feels she needs to drop by Forrester's today and see that things are going smoothly. Taylor revisits Thorne lamenting to herself the fact that she should have told him all last night. He reveals to her that he knows she has been keeping a secret from him. The fact that she had been drinking the night of Darla's accident. He drives her yet Taylor doesn't feel this is her problem and doesn't initially want to participate at A.A. They listen to others tell their story and Taylor remembers the awful night. She stands and gives a gut-wrenching account of her life. How it has spiraled out of control. She doesn't recognize herself anymore, with the drinking ..sleeping with men she doesn't even know. She blames herself for not being there first at the accident, her being the one to live and not Darla. She cries she wants to do something, the right thing for Darla as she can't live with this pain anymore. Stephanie is concerned. She's ecstatic that he's staying on and excited about working again, but with Donna? They could have gotten any top model to do that. Donna joins them and Stephanie doesn't miss her \"if you're here, Ridge, I'm ready for anything.\" Brooke oversees Ridge coming on strong and giving Donna a pep talk. The green-eyed monster raises his head. The delight and look on Ridge's face is unmistakable. Brooke thinks the pictures are too provocative, yet Ridge asks her to trust him one more time \u0096 they can give it their best shot. To Donna, he pumps her up by saying she has got it, mega- potential. She just needs to trusts him, how can they fail? Once again, Brooke witnesses this from the shadows and then accosts Donna that she saw her kissing Ridge. Don't play innocent with her and don't ever kiss Ridge again!",
