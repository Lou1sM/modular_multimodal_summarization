Donna rejects Brooke's reproaches about a kiss with Thorne, repeating big sister is still in love with him and can have man and job back as soon as she admits so. Brooke denies and turns on Ridge too, but he's unimpressed.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Donna that she saw the kiss and it better be the last one, no more Ridge. Donna defends by announcing it was strictly innocent; Ridge was helping her with her confidence and she was showing her gratitude. Donna states that Brooke can't love Nick the way she does Ridge, and he is for the taking; just take her old job back. She understands how she could be attracted to Nick but Captain Control wants to control every thing she does and Brooke will not stand for that. And, if she is so in love with Nick, why does this kiss bother her so much? Because, Brooke has always wanted Ridge since the first day she spoke his name; he's the man for her, and still is. Taylor is welcomed back to the A.A. meeting anytime. She has a lot to give people. Thorne returns her to his place and Tylor talks to Alexandria. Even takes Darla's birthday dress and fashions it into one for Allie that she can wear when she is really sad and longing for her mother. Thorne comforts Taylor and tells her he's grateful and that he needs her. Eric worries about Thorne but tells Ridge he is glad Taylor is helping. There's going to be a fashion preview tomorrow and he should just do what he always does, and ignore Stephanie. Ridge speaks with Brooke and doesn't know whether to be flattered or offended by her accusations about Donna. He too scoffs that it was just an innocent kiss. And finally he has something to wake up in the morning for; don't take that way from him too. He confesses he still loves her and always will. Donna witnesses his hug and Brooke's repeats that she is sorry.",
