Eric asked how their marriage was. Quinn said it was going well, despite Brooke trying to prevent it. Eric stated that Brooke had been wary -- with good reason.\n\n\nLater, Eric was in Rick's old office with Quinn, complimenting her work. Quinn said that the new CEO had been complimentary as well. She assumed that Ridge's takeover hadn't sat well with Eric. Eric replied that Ridge took whatever he wanted. \"The way he took Brooke from you?\" Quinn asked.\n\n\nEric said it had been a long time back, and fathers and sons had complicated relationships. Quinn relayed that she'd heard Thomas wanted to be on the design team. Eric believed it was a good thing; however, he hoped Thomas had inherited Ridge's designs skills -- and not Ridge's other traits.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Caroline was typing out a message. Brooke asked if it was premature of Caroline to hint that Forrester was about to make a game-changing announcement. Caroline asked if Brooke had a problem with a father-son collaboration. Brooke felt that it had worked for Ridge and Eric, and it would for Ridge and Thomas -- as long as Caroline refereed.\n\n\nCaroline didn't think she had to do it because the men respected each other, and the designs were all that mattered. Brooke guessed that Caroline had seen Thomas' designs and asked what Caroline thought. Caroline didn't think her opinion mattered. Brooke said Caroline wasn't giving herself enough credit, and Caroline was Ridge's muse, inspiration, and confidante -- everything Brooke had been.\n\n\nA message from Caroline's parents interrupted the conversation, and the topic turned to parents worrying into a child's adulthood. Caroline said that Ridge had nothing to worry about with Thomas, who knew what he wanted. Brooke added that Thomas wanted a place on the design team, and Caroline was anxious to know how Thomas' meeting with Ridge had gone.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Thomas couldn't believe Ridge was serious. Very serious, Ridge said the CEO's son got no free rides. Thomas claimed to just want Ridge's opinion. Ridge replied that he'd given it, and if the design was the best Thomas had, Thomas wouldn't be on the team.\n\n\nRidge saw nothing wrong in pushing oneself to be the best. Thomas thought it was easy for the boss to say because he called the shots at the office -- and with the women in his life. Ridge asked where that statement was from. Before leaving, Thomas said that, as a young designer, he'd been soaking in what was going on, and someday, someone might tell Ridge that he was out of touch and out of date.\n\n\nLater, Brooke arrived and mentioned that Caroline had gone home to rest at her parents' behest. Ridge wondered why he couldn't get Caroline to rest, but he was impressed with how she'd recovered and gotten back to work.\n\n\nRidge received a message from Caroline. Brooke guessed Caroline had said that she hadn't wanted to interrupt the meeting with Thomas, and she was at home, awaiting Ridge in something silky. Ridge asked how Brooke could read his text messages from the other side of the phone, and Brooke reminded him that she had once been the one to wait for him at home. \"Now look at me,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge told Brooke that she could have any man she wanted. \"But not the men that are taken,\" she added. Brooke found it strange that she'd always known she'd win over Taylor, but there had turned out to be someone else -- someone younger.\n\n\nRidge asked if Brooke had given Caroline a hard time about it. Brooke remarked that Caroline was as young as Ridge's daughter, but Brooke guessed Ridge had felt the same way when Brooke had married Eric. Ridge believed that the triangle still affected his relationship with his father. Brooke remarked that it was the way Ridge had taken the company from Eric and Rick that had done it.\n\n\nBrooke picked up the ripped design and looked questioningly at Ridge. Ridge said that it had been Thomas', but Ridge had ripped it up. Brooke asked why Ridge hadn't showed a little diplomacy. Ridge tried to explain himself but concluded that Brooke might be right. He wanted Thomas to grow and not get by on his name.\n\n\nRidge said Eric hadn't let Ridge do it, but Ridge and Thomas were very different. Brooke didn't see how it was so. She said that Thomas was committed, angry, rebellious, and charming. Ridge denied being angry but did recall being as charming as hell. Brooke warned that Thomas' charm was dangerous, and it would be hard for a woman to deny him.\n\n\nAt Ridge's loft, Thomas arrived while Caroline awaited Ridge in a robe. Thomas was livid that Ridge had ripped up his design. Thomas said Ridge's message had been clear about Thomas being a pale imitation of Ridge. Caroline asked if Thomas wanted her to talk to Ridge.\n\n\nThomas was fine with his father putting him through it. He recalled that Ridge had torn up a lot of things, including the great family they'd had. Caroline asked Thomas to wait there to talk to Ridge, who should arrive soon. Caroline got up to get some wine, but her ankles were too stiff to stand on. She said Ridge usually rubbed them for her, and Thomas offered to do it.\n\n\nCaroline thought it was sweet but wanted Ridge to do it. Thomas said that she was in pain, and he propped her ankles on his lap. As he worked on them, she thanked him but said he didn't have to do it. He told her to think of him as a stand-in for his father, and he joked it would win him some points.\n\n\n\"Oh, so he poo-poohed your initial design,\" Caroline said. She believed that Ridge just had certain expectations. Thomas had some, too, and one was not to have his work destroyed because Ridge was ticked about something else. She asked what made Thomas say that. Thomas replied that his father had \"never not been\" supportive. She replied that Ridge was happy to have Thomas back in town.\n\n\nCaroline was happy for it, too. Thomas asked if being with Ridge was boring, but she said Ridge was an exciting man. \"For his age,\" Thomas quipped. She replied that it was for any age, and age and maturity didn't always go hand-in-hand. She sensed that being abroad had matured Thomas, and Ridge would soon see it. Thomas said that the beautiful Caroline had high hopes, but they'd get dashed once Ridge moved on.\n\n\nThomas apologized. Caroline said that Ridge wasn't like that and asked if it was so hard to believe he'd found something with her. Thomas didn't find it hard to believe. Stroking her leg, he said he remembered seeing her legs when she'd stepped out of the limo upon her arrival to town, and he'd known it wouldn't last with her and Rick.\n\n\nCaroline said that if she'd known then what she did \"now,\" she would have made a different choice. Thomas stated that he'd left town, she'd gotten with his father, and they'd both made mistakes. He began kissing her leg. She asked what he was doing and told him to leave. He went to the door, but instead of leaving, he locked it.\n\n\nCaroline asked what Thomas was doing. He sat on the couch, yanked her onto his lap and began kissing her. Caroline told him that she couldn't. He said that he'd lost her once, and he wouldn't do it again. \"No,\" she breathlessly replied, but Thomas said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas can not believe his dad ripped up his design. He wants to know how it works around here then. Brooke tells Caroline that she thinks it will be great for another father/son team. Caroline says yes if Ridge is pleased with Thomas's designs. Caroline says Thomas knows what he wants. Ridge tells Thomas he wants the best for him but that wasn't it. Thomas chastises him for almost everything, even the women in his life. Maybe Ridge is the one who is out of touch, just saying. He walks out. Deacon sticks around and says he is waiting for another kiss from his wife, not to see Brooke. Eric walks out and says he will have to write them up for goofing off on the job. He reminds Quinn that Brooke was wary for good reason about their marriage but he hopes it is going well. He tells Quinn that she is doing a wonderful job here and her pieces are exceptional. They are lucky to have her back. Brooke and Ridge talk after Caroline goes home. She remembers how that feels when she used to wait for him at home. She and Taylor fought over him for so many years. But she always knew in the end there would be someone younger. Ridge says that whole triangle they had with her and Eric still affects his thoughts today. She sees the ripped up Thomas piece. Ridge tells her that he wants his son to grow, not just get by on his name. But maybe she is right, he could cut him a little slack. She says few people can say no to Thomas when he puts his mind to it. Thomas stops by Caroline's and says his dad ripped up his design and is probably laughing at him right now. The picture is loud and clear, he is only a pale imitation of his old man. Nothing is ever good enough for him. Caroline suggests that he stay as Ridge will be home soon and they can talk more freely. She has leg pains and Thomas insists that he can massage and help her. He puts her legs in his lap and goes to work. Thomas says his dad has never been not supportive but maybe he is ticked at him for something else and not just the design. They laugh and she says living abroad has been good for him as he is more mature now. He adds and better looking too. He hopes she is happy and won't be crushed when his dad finally moves on. He apologizes for that but he knows monogamy is not his strong suit. She says Ridge has changed. He is not like that any more. He says he remembers when she first stepped out of that limo. But then he left town and she got with his dad. He kisses her leg and she tells him no, he needs to stop. Instead he puts the lock on the door and pulls her into his lap and tries to kiss her. She says she can't. He tells her that he lost her once and he can not do that again. He kisses her and she does not pull away immediately.",
