She wanted to know where Eric was so that she and Eric could communicate and bridge the gap between them.\n\n\nAt Eric's hotel, Sheila exited Eric's bathroom and was surprised to see Eric packing. He had decided it was time to go home. Sheila asked if he needed any help and if he'd packed his medication. Eric asserted that he was all packed.\n\n\nEric called Quinn, who was relieved and grateful that he'd returned her call. She talked about how much she loved and missed him. He asked if she was at the house. She told him that she was, and he said he was on his way there to talk to her.\n\n\nAfter the call, Eric picked up his bag to leave, but Sheila wanted to tell him something before he left. Sheila claimed to know that Eric had been clear about there being nothing between them, and she was just glad she'd been there to take care of him. She asked him not to go easy on Quinn, the witch whom Eric needed to divorce.\n\n\nSheila asserted that some betrayals could be forgiven, but Quinn was despicable for what she'd done with his son. Sheila believed that Eric deserved the best, but Quinn wasn't it. Eric wordlessly left, and Sheila seemed anxious.\n\n\nLater, someone knocked on Sheila's hotel room door. She answered it, and Charlie stormed in, arguing that Sheila really knew how to put things on spin cycle. Charlie wasn't upset that Quinn's marriage might end, but he didn't want it trailing back to him. Sheila said no one knew that he'd told her. He claimed he hadn't told her anything, and she'd pieced it together herself. Charlie asked where Eric was, and Sheila said Eric had gone to see Quinn.\n\n\nCharlie wondered if it meant Eric would forgive Quinn. Sheila thought it meant Eric would tell Quinn he wanted a divorce, and Sheila hoped it was happening at that moment.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Ridge was happy for Quinn. Quinn hoped Eric was returning to the marriage, not just the house. Ridge didn't know what Eric would do, but Ridge advised her to keep being strong. He was pulling for the couple. Ridge left, and Quinn flashed back on times with Eric.\n\n\nEric arrived. Quinn was happy that he was there and stammered, saying Ridge had said Eric had been with Sheila. Eric didn't want to talk about Sheila. Quinn didn't want to, either. She wanted to talk about their marriage.\n\n\nQuinn understood that she'd betrayed Eric, and she regretted it. She knew she couldn't change it, but she could be the wife he deserved to have. She knew they could work through it. She thought he felt the same way, which was why he'd returned home to her. She figured that he wanted to fight for their marriage, too. Eric said nothing, and she asked him to speak.\n\n\nEric asked how he could remain married to Quinn or trust her again after she'd betrayed him with his own son. Eric wanted Quinn and Ridge off the property. Eric wanted Quinn gone, and he wanted a divorce. \"No!\" Quinn shrieked.\n\n\nEric said he'd already started the proceedings. Quinn implored Eric not to do it and suggested counseling. She asked him to talk to her. Eric asserted that there was nothing to talk about, and it was over. Quinn begged Eric to reconsider and give her another chance.\n\n\nOn the jet, Nicole left the bedroom cabin after giving Lizzy a bottle and putting her down for a nap. Wyatt noted that it was a little quieter on the jet with Brooke and Bill on the yacht, Thomas flying to New York, and Sally taking a commercial flight back for reasons unknown to Wyatt.\n\n\nNicole figured it meant more Champagne for them, but Maya and Zende weren't interested. Rick teased the two about having quite a night. Nicole said they'd been out all night, so it had to have been fun. Katie looked nervous, recalling Maya kissing Zende on the cheek at the club.\n\n\nRick had been happy to watch Lizzy so that Maya could enjoy herself. Nicole felt bad for not going, but Zende said there would be other times in the future.\n\n\nLater, Maya checked on Lizzy in the private cabin then went to get water in the main cabin. Zende was also at the mini bar, pouring a drink. He remarked that the previous night hadn't turned out the way they'd wanted. Maya stated that she wasn't used to those types of encounters anymore. Zende guessed that alcohol could make people lose their morals at times.\n\n\nMaya said it had been a long time since she'd had as much to drink as that night. Zende replied that he wouldn't dabble in it for a while.\n\n\nKatie watched Maya and Zende. Wyatt sat with Katie to ask what movie she planned to watch. Katie claimed she'd been quantifying auction numbers. She asked if he could help with it. Realizing she wanted privacy with him, Wyatt became more than willing to \"quantify.\"\n\n\nKatie and Wyatt went to the kitchenette beyond the curtains, and Wyatt scooped Katie into a kiss. He guessed they were about to attempt the Mile-High Club, but Katie said it wasn't what she'd asked him there for. She revealed that something strange had happened the previous night. She'd seen two people kissing. He said it happened at clubs and asked if she remembered.\n\n\nKatie did remember but said that she and Wyatt weren't married. Wyatt figured she was saying that the kissers were people they knew. Katie added that it had happened after he'd left. Wyatt deduced that Katie had to mean Maya and Zende.\n\n\nWyatt asked it had been a \"kiss-kiss\" or a peck on the cheek. Though it had been dark at the club, Katie thought she'd seen a kiss on the cheek, and Maya and Zende's embrace had seemed intimate. Wyatt faked outrage that Maya and Zende had hugged.  Noting the solid marriages Zende and Nicole seemed to have, Wyatt believed there had to be a viable explanation. \"Either way, it's none of our business,\" he concluded.\n\n\nKatie figured that she was probably overreacting. She said she had trust issues. Wyatt joked that he'd had no idea. She thanked him for talking her off the ledge. Wyatt replied that they could talk more and asked if she wanted to at least talk about the Mile-High Club. Katie chuckled and declined, saying she was good.\n\n\nBack in the main cabin, Maya decided to take a nap. Nicole noted that Zende looked tired, too. He said he'd go get a pillow. He and Maya went into the sleeping cabin, and he remarked that he was glad ti get a chance to speak. Maya didn't want anyone to know about what had happened. Zende felt Rick would want to know that his wife had been attacked by bigots.\n\n\nMaya didn't want Rick to get alarmed or for him and Nicole to feel bad for not being there to stand up for Maya. Maya just wanted to keep it between her and Zende and forget about it.\n\n\nMaya stated that she didn't get up and think about it every day. Being a woman was what she'd always been. Zende felt that she was a strong woman, and he sometimes forgot about her adversities. Maya had feared exposure her whole life, and at that point, she just wanted acceptance for who she was. Zende standing up for her had meant the world to her.\n\n\nZende was sorry Maya still had to face it. Maya didn't let it bother her because she had a supportive family. It did bother her that not everyone had a support system, and she was grateful for hers. Zende named himself, Nicole, Rick, and Lizzy, and Zende said Lizzy being half Forrester and half Avante meant Lizzy was half crazy, so people like the bullies from the other night had better watch out.\n\n\nMaya said the best she and Rick could do was raise Lizzy to do what was right. Zende asked if Maya was sure she didn't want him to tell Rick and Nicole about the incident. Maya didn't want them to worry. Zende decided to honor Maya's wishes, but he asserted that she couldn't stop him from worrying about her.\n\n\nZende took a pillow and exited the cabin. Katie and Wyatt stared at him, and Zende asked if everything was okay. Affirming it, Wyatt asked if Zende had gotten sleep. Zende said he'd gotten a pillow. He hoped Maya would be able to sleep, but he was still feeling the effects of the other night. Rick thanked Zende for taking care of Maya the other night.\n\n\nNicole beckoned Zende to rest on her lap. As he put the pillow in his wife's lap and settled down, Katie asked if Maya was okay. Zende stated that Maya was strong and would be just fine.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn paces the floor but it is only Ridge that comes through the door. He thought he would catch her at work but she says she is not leaving until Eric comes home. They need to communicate if they are to have any chance. Sheila catches Eric packing and he says it is time that he goes home. He quickly calls Quinn and asks if she is home; good as he plans to come see her. She is ecstatic. Ridge tells her to pull herself together and keep her chin up. She wonders if Eric is going to forgive her. Ridge says he should not be here when Eric gets home so he will see her later. Bill and Brooke take the jet but everyone else but Sally and Thomas are on a commercial jet and speaking about the night before. Nicole tells Maya and Zende it must have been quite a night as they got in late. Katie remembers seeing Maya with her hand on Zende's face as she kissed his cheek and hugged him. Sheila says wait; there is something she wants to tell Eric before he goes. She tells him that he has always been honest with her so she wants to do the same. There are some betrayals you cannot forgive and he will never be able to trust Quinn again. He needs to leave her. Zende follows Maya to another room to get some water.

She says it does not bother her anymore. And she does not want Rick or Nicole to worry so he should not tell them. Katie pulls Wyatt aside and says she saw something last night that surprised her. She saw Maya kissing. Wyatt says big deal, that is what happens at clubs and the two of them know that. She says but it was with Zende. He asks if it was a real kiss or just a peck. She says it was dark so she cannot be sure. He says whatever, it is not their business. Maya tells Zende to please just forget it ever happened. Rick does not have to know about the dudes who verbally attacked her. Katie and Wyatt and Rick all notice Zende coming out of the bedroom where Maya has been. Charlie marches into Sheila's room and snaps at her that he never thought Eric would move out and now he is afraid that will all be on him. She tells him to calm down as no one even knows that it was him that told her. Quinn is apprehensive but glad to see Eric home. She starts off by saying she betrayed their marriage and she cannot tell him how much she regrets that and wishes she could take it back. But they cannot change the past but make sure from this moment forward they can work this out. She believes that is the reason he came home, that he wants to fight for their marriage as much as she wants to. He says she betrayed him with his own son.
