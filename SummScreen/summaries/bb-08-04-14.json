    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Quinn's loft, a disquieted Wyatt told his mother that the Mexico City authorities wanted to talk to him about Ricardo's death. Quinn asked why and what they suspected. \"Murder,\" he replied. Remarking that it sounded serious, she asked why they thought Wyatt would know what had happened to Ricardo. \"Don't know. Do you?\" Wyatt knowingly asked.\n\n\nThe surprised Quinn asked why she would know when she'd just gotten out of treatment. Wyatt seemed suspicious of her, but Quinn said she hadn't been near Mexico City. She thought it made sense that the police would want to speak to him because he'd inherited the diamond. She advised him not to let it ruin his great day and to believe it was just a matter of time before Hope returned to him.\n\n\nWyatt left, and Quinn scanned the Internet for news about Ricardo and the diamond.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Aly and Hope went into Rick's office, and Hope said that saying yes to the diamond didn't mean turning down Liam. Aly corrected that it hadn't been the diamond Hope had said yes to; it had been Wyatt, which was the reason Liam had walked out.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Liam guessed Ivy thought he'd done the right thing. Ivy didn't think his fianc\u00e9e should accept jewelry from another man, but she couldn't say that breaking things off had been the right way to handle it. Liam replied that he hadn't broken up with Hope. \"Didn't you?\" Ivy replied.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, the employees gathered to monitor the media explosion the diamond had caused. Ridge said he'd called the meeting to harness the momentum Wyatt had given them. Noting that Caroline was in a different meeting, Rick called Ivy and Hope to ask them to join Ridge's meeting. Rick asked Hope to get Wyatt to meet them, too.\n\n\nLater, Hope, Ivy, and Wyatt arrived. Rick said that Forrester had the diamond back and had to decide what to do with it. Wyatt corrected that he'd given the stone to Hope, and what to do with it was up to her. Hope said she'd use it to promote the line, and she wouldn't have accepted it otherwise. She stated that it should be on display, but Wyatt said it should be worn as a necklace.\n\n\n\"A forty-plus-carat, one-of-a-kind necklace,\" Ivy murmured.\n\n\nEric remarked that Thorne wanted the jewel on display in Paris. Rick suggested that Ivy make a new setting for the stone, so they could display it in Australia. Ridge interjected that they had to make a quick decision, but Eric replied that he didn't like to rush things. Ridge asked what Wyatt thought they should do. Wyatt felt that depended upon Hope and asked her if she was up for another adventure.\n\n\nHope told everyone that her head was still spinning, and Donna said that hers would be, too, if she'd received a gift like that. Wyatt decided that it was exactly the feeling their campaign should capture. Wyatt liked Thorne's Paris idea and proposed putting three icons together in one photo shoot -- Hope, the diamond, and the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that he could put the shoot together right away, but they had to act before the buzz faded. He figured that they needed just one incredible image, and HFTF would be solidified in people's minds forever. Rick and Ridge liked the idea, and Eric wondered how quickly it could be done. Everyone grew silent, and Wyatt said that if they gave him a chance, they wouldn't be sorry.\n\n\nWyatt was aware that he'd given the Forresters many reasons to question his character, but he said they couldn't deny his passion. He believed that it was a huge opportunity for him to prove himself, and with the diamond, they could achieve their goals.\n\n\nLater, Hope and Wyatt were alone in the office, and Wyatt hoped she wasn't angry with him for putting her on the spot. Hope cited that he'd done that more than once that day. Wyatt noted that she hadn't given Rick an answer about Paris. Sighing, Hope said she shouldn't leave while Liam was upset.\n\n\nWyatt reasoned that Liam would get over it, but Paris was a good idea for her and the line. Hope said she wanted to go, and Wyatt prodded her to agree. \"No. Not until I talk to Liam,\" Hope decided.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was in Rick's office when Quinn called him to see how things were going. He relayed that he was on his way to Paris with Rick and Hope to do an impromptu photo shoot with the diamond. Quinn erupted in excitement. Wyatt said Hope was on her way to give Liam the news, and it might shut the door between the two permanently.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Deacon kissed Brooke, and confused, she asked what he was doing. He said he was getting her attention the best way he knew how, and he sensed that their connection was still there. Brooke told him that he couldn't return after all that time and expect something from her. He uttered that he hadn't forgotten, and she hadn't, either.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that it had been in the past, and they'd been young and reckless. Deacon contended that they'd been crazy about each other. She said that she knew he wanted to remember it like that, but it hadn't always been so. They both had changed, and she had different priorities.\n\n\nAs she read something on her phone, Brooke said her major priority was her daughter. Deacon claimed they had that priority in common. Handing him her phone, she responded that he'd want to see \"this.\" It was picture of Hope accepting the diamond from Wyatt. Deacon was proud that Hope had taken his advice, but Brooke huffed, stating that Liam would be extremely upset.\n\n\nWhile Brooke felt that Wyatt had put Hope in an awkward position, Deacon wanted to take lessons from the guy. Brooke received a message that Rick, Hope, and Wyatt were taking the diamond to Paris for a photo layout, and Deacon doubted that Liam would like that, either.\n\n\n\"Which makes me wonder why she agreed to it,\" Brooke added. Deacon figured that Hope was keeping her eye on the prize, like her old man would. He felt that Hope was also like Brooke, who had a heart that wanted what it wanted. He sensed that Brooke feared it would get Hope into trouble.\n\n\nDeacon said Hope's heart wouldn't lie to Hope, and she could always trust it, just as Brooke had always done with her own heart. Brooke didn't want the issue to derail Hope and Liam, who'd been through a lot. Deacon replied that Hope was a Logan, and Liam would be a fool to let Hope go.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Oliver and Aly took a break. She assumed he'd go to Paris, but he replied that the company would use the international crew. Aly noted that Hope hadn't agreed to go yet, but Oliver asked why Hope would accept the diamond if not for her line. Aly and Oliver agreed that Wyatt had an agenda and wasn't even hiding it.\n\n\nAly saw no reason for Wyatt to go to Paris because he'd given the diamond to Hope. Oliver still couldn't believe that Ricardo Montemayor had just given it to Wyatt. Aly said that Ricardo had had many riches but no family to share them with. She added that everyone called the diamond lucky, but it hadn't been for Liam or Se\u00f1or Montemayor.\n\n\nLiam moped as he entered his house. As he prepared some food, he flashed back on romantic times with Hope. He tossed his Chinese takeout box on the table and sighed.\n\n\nHope arrived and said she'd been unsure he'd let her in after he'd walked out on her. Liam replied that he hadn't been getting through to her. She hadn't thought she'd been getting through to him, either, but she still wanted to talk about it. He noticed that she wasn't wearing \"the thing,\" and she explained that it was in the safe at Forrester.\n\n\n\"It's still yours,\" Liam murmured and chuckled mirthlessly. He knew that Hope wasn't blind to what Wyatt was doing because she'd been ready to return the jewel until the press conference had made everything she'd said to Liam go out the window. Hope insisted that it was a business decision, and he was the only one making it personal. \"Hope -- It's personal to me,\" he asserted.\n\n\nLiam didn't want to talk about it, but Hope explained that she might be going to Paris and didn't want to leave on bad terms. He asked who she'd go with. \"Rick...and Wyatt,\" She responded, and Liam grimaced, sure it was Wyatt's idea. Hope claimed that she'd wanted to talk to Liam before accepting. He was sure she'd made up her mind already. The tearful Hope stressed that it could be an incredible opportunity, and showcasing the diamond in Europe could fortify HFTF internationally.\n\n\nHope claimed that profits were important, but Liam knew that profits weren't why she did her job. She felt that the more press they got, the more young women would become exposed to HFTF's message of empowerment and environmentalism. She asked if Liam understood it. She said it wasn't about the diamond or Wyatt giving it to her; it was about what the diamond could do.\n\n\nCupping his face, Hope said she loved Liam \"so much.\" She wanted them to start their life together. \"So let's start it in Paris. You are the man I want to be with. So what do you say? Come with me,\" she requested. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Wyatt receives an interesting phone call concerning a mystery surrounding the death of Ricardo Montemayor. Knowing what his mother is capable of, Wyatt interrogates Quinn about her involvement with Ricardo\u2019s untimely demise. Brooke is unsure of what to think regarding her latest unexpected interaction with Deacon. Hope reaps the positive and negative consequences of accepting Wyatt\u2019s gift.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn asks Wyatt who was calling. He replies it was the Mexican police calling about Ricardo's death. She asks why and he replies they are investigating, possible murder. She says that sounds serious. But she can't imagine why they'd want to talk to Wyatt. He asks if she knows anything. She feigns ignorance and scoffs that she just got out of treatment, nowhere near Mexico City. But she does not want this to ruin his fabulous day that he will have with Hope. She accepted the diamond so its only a matter of time before she takes Wyatt back. As the group at FC huddle Ridge says they need to work fast to continue this while the diamond is hot. They need Hope in here. Rick calls her and tells her to call Wyatt they need him too. Ivy tells Liam that she knows he is upset. His fiance should not be accepting jewelry from another guy. He corrects her and said he did not break up with Hope which Ivy seemed to think. Ridge tells Rick they need to make some decisions and a statement about the diamond. Wyatt comes in and says he gave the diamond to Hope so it really is up to her. She says she is going to use the diamond with her line otherwise she never would have accepted it. Wyatt tells the group that he told them this would be big. Aly hates how they are encouraging Wyatt. Donna says the news is trending like crazy. Pam says Rodeo Drive already has lookie loos. Ridge asks how long would it take to set up a display. Eric says they need to do something bigger than that. He says Thorne thinks they should bring it to Paris. Carter says they have to avoid rushing ahead and risk overlooking something. Ridge says they will cross that when they have to. Ridge tells Wyatt he started this firestorm so what is his idea. Wyatt says that should be up to the diamond's owner and asks Hope if she is up for another adventure. She seems confused and says her head is still spinning. Wyatt says that is what they want to do - take everyone's breathe away. He likes Thorne's suggestion going to Paris. How about three superstars in one photo shoot? It could be the diamond, Hope and the Eiffel Tower. If they can make the jet ready he can be ready right away. Every moment they miss the buzz will start to fade. All they need is one iconic image and HFTF will be cemented in people's minds forever. Wyatt promises them they will not be sorry. They all like it. Only Hope who is saying nothing looks unsure. Wyatt says he knows he has done things in the past that made them doubt him, but there is no mistaking his passion. They have given him a second chance and he wants to prove to them that he deserves that. Brooke breaks away from her kiss with Deacon and asks what is he doing. He says getting through to her the best way he knows how. He asks how's he doing. Stunned she says he can not come back and expect anything after all this time. He tells her that he hasn't forgotten and neither has she. She says they were reckless back then. He says they were crazy for each other if she will just admit it. She said her priorities have changed and right now her main one is her daughter. He says they have that in common then. She finds a photo on the phone and says Liam is going to be extremely upset when he sees this with Hope wearing the diamond. Liam hobbles home and flops down on the couch. He gets some takeout Chinese out of the frij but then throws that aside and is not interested. Deacon tells Brooke that he didn't come over to look at pictures on her phone. About that time she gets a text from Rick that Hope and Wyatt are going to Paris. He says Liam won't like that for sure. Brooke says all the more reason she doesn't understand why Hope would say yes. Deacon says Hope is a lot like her mother in that regard. She has a heart inside of her that wants what she wants. She can listen to her heart and believe and trust in it just like Brooke always did. Brooke says Hope and Liam have been through so much. She hates to see them be derailed. Deacon says she is a Logan. He'd be a fool to let her go. Alone Wyatt tells Hope that she never gave Rick a firm answer. He tells her again that Paris will be good for her and her line. He wouldn't have suggested it otherwise. Finally she says she wants to go ..but not until she talks to Liam. Quinn's face lights up when she calls Wyatt and he tells her that he and Hope are on their way to Paris as soon as she talks to Liam. This could put a wedge between them permanently. Hope tells Liam that she wasn't sure that he'd let her in since he walked out on her the last time they saw each other. He says yeah he was frustrated as he wasn't getting through to her. She says she could say the same thing. But she is willing to still talk about it. That is not exactly why she is here though. And she reminds Liam that it was a business decision to keep the diamond and Liam was the only one making it personal. She says she is going out of town and she really doesn't want to leave things like this between them. He asks and she says Paris. Rick and Wyatt are going as Ridge wants them to do a photo shoot. Liam stiffens and backs away when he hears Wyatt is going and is sure that it was his idea. She tries to sell him again that this is not about the diamond or Wyatt. It really will empower the line and her message to young girls out there. It's not because Wyatt gave it to her but what the diamond can do. She makes it clear that she has not said yes yet. She says she loves him and she wants them to start their life together so why not in Paris. She asks him to come with her.",
