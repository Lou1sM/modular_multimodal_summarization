    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Ridge's place, Thomas said he had stayed away for too long, but he was back and was there for Caroline. He tried to kiss her again, but she told him that she'd said she couldn't. He asked what was stopping her. \"That's what I thought,\" he stated in her silence, and he kissed her again.\n\n\nRidge knocked on the front door. Thomas snapped out of his fantasy and discovered that he was still only massaging Caroline's ankles. Caroline asked Thomas to open the door because Ridge had probably forgotten his keys again.\n\n\nThomas let Ridge in, and Caroline explained that Thomas had been massaging her ankles like Ridge usually did. Thomas didn't know what good he'd done, but she said her ankles felt better. Thomas decided he should probably go, but Ridge asked if Thomas hadn't been there to lay into Ridge. Thomas felt that Ridge deserved it, but he didn't want to get into a big fight with his father.\n\n\nRidge didn't want it, either. He was glad Thomas was there because he wanted to apologize to Thomas. Ridge said he'd gone too far in making his point, and Thomas had needed someone to encourage him, not toss his work out. Ridge knew Thomas could do better, and he was pushing Thomas because Ridge believed in Thomas and wanted him to trust his instincts.\n\n\nThomas decided that he hadn't needed to take things so personally, and he wanted to go back to the office to work on some designs. Ridge offered to have them all draw at the loft, and Caroline echoed him, saying they could draw together. Thomas declined because he needed to clear his head, and he left.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline cuddled on the sofa. Ridge regretted tearing up the design. Caroline asked why he'd done it. He shrugged, saying it hadn't been up to their standards. She said she'd seen it, and it hadn't been terrible. He relayed that people didn't want to buy \"not terrible,\" and Thomas had acted as if it had been ready for production. She replied that Ridge had certainly settled the thought of it.\n\n\nRidge reminded Caroline that he'd apologized, which hadn't been easy for him. Caroline said it might not have fixed things, but Thomas had left a lot less upset. Ridge figured that Thomas had been there to vent to Caroline. Ridge figured the apology hadn't helped because Thomas hadn't even wanted to draw with Ridge. Caroline said there was no better motivation than trying to prove someone wrong.\n\n\nThe couple began making out, but a message interrupted them. Caroline said Rick had forwarded a message from his attorney that the divorce was final, and the marriage was over. Caroline felt disillusioned because she'd never failed at anything.\n\n\nRidge told Caroline that she hadn't failed; it just hadn't worked out. It felt like an excuse to Caroline. Ridge replied that one could work as hard as he could, but sometimes things just didn't work out. She conveyed that she'd always thought that if she followed her checklist, her life with turn out to be what she'd thought it would be.\n\n\nRidge told Caroline that sometimes they bumped into things and had to change direction. Caroline saw herself as reaching goals she set for herself. He said she wouldn't reach them with Rick. She had admitted that she'd thought she could, and she imagined that having kids with Rick would have made the divorce much harder. Ridge agreed.\n\n\nCaroline assured Ridge that it had been the right decision, and she wanted him to know that she was happy and in a much better place with him. It hadn't been what she'd expected or planned. \"Just live in the moment,\" he uttered, and they kissed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Zende arrived in the CEO's office and chatted with Brooke about how much he was learning as an intern. He remarked that all the interns had been doing well, including Nicole, who he was sure had made an impression at Forrester. Brooke said that Nicole was very young but had matured during her time there with Maya.\n\n\nBrooke felt it was good that Zende was there because they needed more Forresters. Zende said Thomas was back, and she replied that Thomas' homecoming hadn't been as happy as Zende's. Zende assumed it was because of Aly's memorial. Brooke said it was that and the sketch Ridge had ripped up because it hadn't met Ridge's standards.\n\n\nZende thought it was harsh to rip it up. Brooke agreed, but she believed that Ridge knew what Thomas was capable of and wanted him to be the best he could be.\n\n\nZende remarked upon how difficult it might be for Thomas to return to town. Brooke knew the feeling. She'd returned home to see that many things had changed with Rick and his marriage, Quinn and Deacon, and Ridge and Caroline. Zende said he'd been shocked by the latter. Brooke stated that the designers might make a great team, but not a great couple in the long run.\n\n\nZende asked what Brooke meant. Brooke said the pair had work in common, but Ridge and Caroline's futures might be different. Brooke didn't think the two had much in common outside of work.\n\n\nLater, Zende arrived at the sky lounge to work out. He saw Thomas furiously pumping weights and guessed it was about Ridge. Zende said it wasn't \"going around the office,\" but Brooke had confided that Ridge had ripped up Thomas' design. Zende said it was no wonder Thomas was so revived up. Thomas claimed his mood was about something else.\n\n\nThomas told Zende that Ridge hadn't retracted his statement, but he'd apologized. Thomas hoped Ridge wasn't so harsh with Caroline. Thomas wanted the best for Caroline -- especially after Rick had derailed her dreams of family and children, and Thomas didn't think those things were an option for her anymore.\n\n\nZende assumed Thomas was saying that Caroline wanted children, but Ridge didn't. Shrugging, Thomas said Ridge had kids already and probably didn't want to return to diaper duty. Zende reasoned that Ridge might it if mattered to Caroline. Thomas wasn't sure but said she might have changed Ridge.\n\n\nThomas didn't want Caroline to get burned like his mother, Brooke, or Katie. He loved Ridge but said Ridge wasn't dependable for women. Thomas believed that Ridge sold the women on idyllic futures, but Thomas had never seen them actualized -- not once.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas tells Caroline that he is here for her. He went away but he is back now and now there is nothing stopping them. He kisses her as she leans backward on the sofa. There is a knock on the door and it is Ridge. Thomas breaks from his fantasy and has to answer the door. Ridge is more than surprised to find Thomas there and asks what is going on. Caroline fills him in that her legs started hurting and Thomas was helping her like Ridge has. Ridge says he is sure that he must have come over to jump all over Ridge and he'd like to apologize. He is glad that he is home again. Zende tells Brooke that he sat in on a marketing meeting this morning and he is learning a lot. She tells him that they are all happy he is here. He and Nicole are both hard working. Brooke confides in Zende that Ridge was not pleased with Thomas's design and ripped it up. Ridge is very focused and knows what he wants. Ridge says he went too far when he ripped up the design and he is sorry. But he knows Thomas can do better. He says he knows what he is capable of, and that is a compliment. He trusts his instincts. Thomas agrees that he did not have to take it so personally. He says he can't wait now to get back to the office and clear his head and make more designs. Caroline thanks him for helping her. Brooke and Zende continue talking and she said the atmosphere changed a lot when she went away to Milan and now there are more couples here than when she left. She does not see how Ridge and Caroline can continue though as they are in much different places. Caroline tells Ridge that she saw Thomas's design and it wasn't that terrible. Ridge says no but it was not up to his standard either. He did apologize so Thomas will be okay. Thomas is on the Sky Lounge Roof working on his abs. Zende tells him to slow up a little. He heard about Ridge tearing up his design so he knows why he is so heated up. Thomas says he hopes Ridge is not that way with Caroline. He admits he and Caroline go way back and they care for each other. She thought Rick was the one for her and then that ended and she is with his dad. All those things she originally wanted he does not think is an option any more. Caroline says she is glad Ridge apologized to Thomas. There is no better motivation than trying to prove someone wrong. Just give Thomas a chance. She gets a text from Rick that the divorce is final. She sighs to Ridge that her marriage is over. She can't believe she is not married anymore. She's been so busy to even think about it and she lost track of time. It's an excuse but she failed at marriage. Working hard did not matter. She had her whole life planned out and it was snatched away. Her life did not turn out the way she expected it to. Thomas says his dad has not pulled diaper duty in a long time and he doesn't think he will want to. Zende says maybe Caroline will change all of that. Thomas says he has seen it happen to his mom and sister and he doesn't want to see Caroline get burned again. Ridge tells Caroline that life doesn't always go as planned. She says she knows but she has always been able to reach her goal. She's glad she did not have kids with Rick as it would have made the divorce harder. She says she is glad she has her place with him. He agrees, they will live in the moment. She hugs Ridge. Thomas works harder on his abs.",
