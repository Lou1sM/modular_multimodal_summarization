Liam worried that Hope seemed clueless that Wyatt had a creepy power over her. It worried him. Hope maintained that Liam didn't understand Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam argued that Hope had \"limitless tolerance\" for Wyatt's manipulations. Liam recalled that Wyatt had ambushed Hope in front of an audience. Hope defended her decision to accept the diamond as a business decision for her line. Hope insisted her acceptance of the gift \"doesn't affect you.\" Liam was insulted and reminded her that the diamond had gotten between them before and was doing it again, courtesy of Wyatt.\n\n\nHope reminded Liam that she wasn't wearing the diamond, and it had been stored in the safe at Forrester. It wasn't a personal gift. She wanted to use the diamond to promote her message -- globally -- of empowerment for young women. She maintained she could use the diamond to reach many young women. \"I love you, and I want you with me. Say that you'll come,\" she begged.\n\n\nHope and Liam argued over what Liam was angry about. They further argued over using the words angry, unhappy, and upset to describe his feelings. Hope insisted that Liam was upset that Hope didn't do what Liam wanted her to do.\n\n\nLiam disagreed and said that he was upset that Wyatt had manipulated Hope again. Hope reminded Liam that Wyatt had made a crazy promise that he never could have kept, and somehow it had all happened. It was innocent. Liam laughed that Hope thought any of it was innocent. \n\n\nHope said Wyatt and Thorne had devised a publicity idea in Paris to promote her line. Liam suggested that Wyatt wanted something in exchange for the diamond. Hope said it was not going to change the way she felt about Liam.\n\n\nLiam wanted Hope to cancel the trip, and return the diamond before it caused any more trouble.  Hope shook her head and sighed. Hope reminded Liam that her work was important to her, and she was not going to give it up -- the publicity idea had already created a lot of buzz in Paris. Liam noted that Wyatt had a pattern of behavior, and he repeatedly talked Hope into doing things.\n\n\nHope sighed. She searched for the wedding rings that Liam and Hope had exchanged before. She found them in a box and asked Liam to put the ring on her finger in Paris. Liam smiled.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Wyatt entered and Quinn had already packed him a bag for the Paris trip. Quinn said she had wanted to see Wyatt. She prattled on about how she wished she had seen Hope and Wyatt when Hope had accepted the diamond. Wyatt reminded his mother that Hope was with Liam.\n\n\nWyatt wondered about Quinn's treatment, and Quinn said she was in outpatient treatment. Quinn quizzed Wyatt about every detail of the press conference and what Hope had said. Wyatt stopped her. He told her to stop obsessing about the diamond, Paris, and anything to do with Hope or Liam. Quinn did not let up. She picked up Wyatt's phone and looked for photos. Wyatt angrily told her to stop. \"You're done with that,\" he said.\n\n\n\"Your life is my life,\" she responded. \"No it's not,\" Wyatt said sternly. He quizzed her about her therapy. She said she had to keep a journal and share it with her therapist. She said she felt better. Wyatt told her they would not have the same relationship they had previously had.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to know if Hope and Wyatt would marry in Paris. Wyatt shook his head. Quinn encouraged Wyatt to call Hope and interrupt her at Liam's. Wyatt argued that it was a mistake, but he obliged and called Hope.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Hope took Wyatt's call. He asked if Hope needed a ride to the airport. Hope refused and was short with Wyatt. She hung up, and Wyatt lamented to his mother that he should never have called.\n\n\nLiam noted that Hope had interrupted an important conversation with him in order to take a call from Wyatt. Liam told Hope that she had accepted more than jewelry from Wyatt. It was like Wyatt had given her an island.  \"I am committed to you,\" she said. Hope had tired of talking in circles. \"Please come with me,\" she said.\n\n\nHope maintained that after all the priests and justices of the peace, she wanted to get married. She begged Liam to join her in two days -- after the photo shoot and press conference had wrapped. \"This is the beginning of the rest of our lives. I love you,\" she said. They kissed passionately, and Hope left. Liam smiled.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy, Rick, Maya, Aly, and Oliver discussed the impending photo shoot at the Eiffel Tower. Rick noted that it had all fallen together easily \"like it's meant to be.\" The group discussed that Ridge had insisted on a local photographer, but Aly made a pitch for Oliver to go. Rick, Ivy, and Maya noted that photographers had to have permits, and only local photographers had the ability to get everything in order on such short notice. Rick apologized to Aly and Oliver, but he said he would not butt heads with Ridge on the subject.\n\n\nIvy questioned if Hope would actually go to Paris, and Maya offered to go in her place. Rick thanked Maya for all her help. Maya left then Rick left. Ivy wondered if Hope was loyal to Liam or Wyatt. Aly defended Hope. Oliver said he knew Hope would go to Paris.\n\n\nOutside the office, Charlie and Pam guessed at how many millions the diamond was worth. Charlie suspected something fishy had happened in order for Wyatt to inherit the diamond. Charlie conjectured wild scenarios of what had happened to Ricardo, and all of them included Wyatt doing something dishonest.\n\n\n",
