Ivy also answered calls. Liam entered and interrupted.\n\n\nAly and Ivy told Liam it had been a madhouse. Ivy wondered if Liam was aware that Hope had gone. Liam said that he knew she was on a plane to Paris with Wyatt and the diamond. Aly said she wished they had never heard of the Hope for the Future Diamond.\n\n\nIvy noted that Wyatt had made his move and ambushed Hope at the press conference. Aly encouraged Liam to go to Paris. Liam admitted that Hope wanted him to meet her there. Aly reminded Liam that it was the most romantic city in the world. Aly and Ivy wondered why Liam wasn't already in Paris.\n\n\nLiam worried that Hope was still conflicted about Wyatt. Aly defended Hope's decision to accept the diamond for the line, but Ivy said Hope should not have done it.\n\n\nLiam explained that he had kept his and Hope's wedding bands in a box in his house. He added that Hope had taken her wedding band and wanted Liam to put it on her finger in Paris near the Eiffel Tower. Aly and Ivy encouraged Liam to go to Paris.\n\n\nIvy would be on her way if her work papers had arrived. Ivy lamented that she would miss out on everyone in the fashion world and all the gemologists. \"Ever since I can remember, it's always been about the bling,\" she said. Ivy told Liam that he was strong and honorable to a fault. \"You're a gentlemen in every way,\" she said.\n\n\nIvy added that Wyatt had been obvious in trying to manipulate Hope. Liam looked at his own wedding ring. He said that Hope had told him he would never lose her unless he pushed her away. Ivy again advised Liam to go to Paris because it was obvious he loved Hope. Ivy also wondered if Hope wasn't more like Brooke than she knew. Ivy explained that she and Hope had grown up in the Forrester family -- but in very different families.\n\n\nOn the Forrester jet, Rick, Hope, and Wyatt winged their way to Paris. Hope sat alone and sullen, while Wyatt worried to Rick about Felicia handling all the publicity because Thorne had gone on vacation. Rick promised that Felicia would deliver.\n\n\nWyatt eyed Hope sitting alone. He sat next to Hope. Hope said she had to talk to him, and she explained that she would return the diamond after the photo shoot. Wyatt objected, but Hope explained that she had hurt Liam when she'd accepted the diamond at the press conference. Wyatt said that Liam had overreacted, but Hope disagreed. She pulled her wedding ring from her bag, and she shared that she and Liam would marry after the photo shoot.\n\n\nWyatt watched her. \"I love you so damned much. I have proven myself to you over and over again,\" he said. Hope told him she would not change her mind. Wyatt raised the issue of Steffy, but Hope said Steffy was no longer an issue. Wyatt maintained the diamond would work its magic in Paris and all over the world.\n\n\nWyatt gushed that it would be perfect with the most beautiful woman ever and the most beautiful diamond. He insisted that she had to focus on conquering Paris. Hope promised she would wear the diamond for photo shoots, but she would return it to him afterward. Wyatt objected, but Hope said she would be wearing Liam's ring when she returned from Paris. Wyatt shook his head.\n\n\nIn the Forrester photo studio, Oliver shot photos of a model. The model thanked him and left. Oliver flashed back to when he had first asked Aly out for coffee. He recalled how shy she had been and how difficult it had been for her to accept compliments. Oliver remembered kissing Aly, and he smiled when he recalled the evening he had dressed as a knight. Oliver smiled. \n\n\nAly entered. She and Oliver embraced, and Oliver lamented that he would not be shooting photos in Paris. He promised to prove himself to Ridge. He said he liked being with Aly because he was her knight in shining armor. They smiled and kissed.\n\n\nIn Paris, Wyatt and Hope walked down a walkway, and Hope stared at the Eiffel Tower where she said Liam would soon meet her. Wyatt doubted that Liam would show up, and he asked what she would do if he didn't. Hope looked shocked. \"He'll be here,\" she said confidently. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "On the jet, Rick tells Wyatt that he knows this is a terrible time for Thorne and Taylor to go on vacation, but Felicia has done PR before and she knows how important this shoot is. She will do fine, just trust him. She will deliver the goods. Aly and Ivy are handling all the overflow of phone calls when Liam drops by. He says he knows Hope is not there. She is on a plane going to Paris with Wyatt and the diamond. Both girls sympathize with Liam that Wyatt made the move on his girl. They think it is time for him to make a move of his own. Maybe he needs to go to Paris and give Mr. Fuller a taste of his own medicine. He admits Hope came to see him yesterday and she did invite him to come to Paris and be there after the photo shoot. Aly says that is the most romantic city in the world and should count for something. He needs to call Hope and tell her that he is coming and that should wipe that smug smile off of Wyatt's face. Liam admits also that he has this box at his house with the rings in them and Hope took hers. That is why she wants him to meet her in their special spot in Paris. Aly says he has to go, do not disappoint Hope or himself. This could work out better than he could ever imagine. Wyatt sits by Hope on the plane and she says there is something she needs to tell him. He knows it is something about Liam and how he took the news. Hope says she could not leave it like it was when Liam walked out on the PC. Wyatt says she did not kowtow to him but did what was best for the line. She says yes but she did not do what was best for the relationship with her fiance. She takes her ring out of her purse and looks at it. Wyatt shifts gears and says they are heading to Paris and now is not the time to talk about Liam and his passive-aggressive behavior or what he did yesterday. He says that he loves her so damned much and he's proven himself by always being there for her, unlike Liam who was not yesterday. She believes Liam has a reason to be upset but she knows that Wyatt knows she would never kick him or the diamond out of her life. He says his word to her means something and she can not say that about Liam. So let him have his feelings. This diamond is hers, not his and it is her line, not his. Wyatt says the diamond is going to work it's magic again for them. And with the most beautiful woman ever with the most beautiful diamond ever, it can't miss. He takes her ring and places it on the table besides them. He says they need to focus on the photo shoot, not that. She tells him that she will gladly wear it for the photo shoot. But she is sorry then she will have to give it back, she has to. Wyatt says they are not having this conversation. When he gets back to L.A. he may have to have a little talk with his paranoid brother. She says he might get a chance before that. Liam is on his way here. She invited him and she hopes when she leaves Paris she will be wearing his ring. Disappointment sets in on Wyatt's face. She explains that actually she was on her way to returning the diamond just before the press conference. Then she walked in and saw all the reporters and Wyatt called her on stage and presented it to her and she could not say no at that very moment. She says she is so sorry but she can not accept a diamond, not one like this from another man .and especially if that man is Liam's brother. She knows she should not have let this go as far as it did. Wyatt asks how they left things. She said she hoped Liam would show up but doesn't sound like he gave her a definitive answer. She admits he needs time to think. Wyatt scoffs that if he wanted a future with her he'd be on that plane in a shot. Maybe he is trying to teach her a lesson. She says no, their relationship is not like that. He wants to know what will happen if Liam does not show. She doesn't believe that will happen. Wyatt says this diamond has brought so many together in the past and he is counting on that again. Ivy tells Liam that she is so disappointed as her work papers did not come through or she would be on this trip in Paris. It's always been about the bling for her. Liam says it shows how much she likes her job; FC is lucky to have her. She returns the compliment and says it is just like Hope in being lucky to have him. He's one of a kind, so strong, honorable to a fault and gentleman in every way. He thanks her and says he wishes his brother saw it that way. She says that she knows he loves Hope but that she, Ivy, would never accept a diamond like this when she knew it would upset Liam so much. But they grew up in different parts of the world with different mothers so maybe Hope is more like Brooke than anyone realizes. But having said that she sees how much he loves her, so go to Paris and have a future with Hope .prove to Wyatt that neither he or the diamond can ruin things between Liam and Hope. Wyatt and Hope walk around Paris and end up at the Eiffel Tower. Wyatt can't believe she is back to that \u0096 wondering if Liam is going to show up or not. She should not be living her life like that. She says she is positive, Liam will be here. He will show up.",
