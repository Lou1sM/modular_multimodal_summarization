Hope longingly stared at the tower, and Wyatt asked if she really thought Liam would show up.\n\n\nLater, Hope and Wyatt arrived at Forrester International and met Felicia and Rick. Everyone was excited about the shoot, and Wyatt murmured that he hoped there were no distractions. As Hope, Felicia, and Rick talked, Wyatt took a call from Quinn, who wanted to know how things were in Paris. He replied that things could be better.\n\n\nWyatt relayed that Hope had invited Liam to meet her in Paris after the photo shoot, but Wyatt didn't know if Liam would show up or not. With a nervous sigh and grin, Quinn said that Wyatt had just given Hope the diamond, and he couldn't lose both it and the girl. He told Quinn to forget he'd said anything, and he warned her to stay far away from Liam.\n\n\nWhen Wyatt rejoined the others in conversation, Felicia and Rick were telling Hope that Thorne and Taylor were \"off the grid\" in some exotic location. Hope asked Wyatt who'd called him. He claimed that it had been someone at the warehouse, and he hadn't wanted to deal with it at that moment.\n\n\nRick announced that Felicia had secured the Trocadero Gardens, and Wyatt exclaimed that no one photographed there unless they did it illegally. \"Unless you're Forrester Creations,\" Rick responded. Wyatt noted that, with the Eiffel Tower nearby, Hope could conveniently just take a few short steps.\n\n\nCutting Wyatt off, Hope thanked Felicia for all the arrangements. Rick remarked about the blue diamond giving them a lot of buzz, and Wyatt said the stone was powerful. He believed that it had given them a lot of good fortune in the past, and there was no telling the magic it would conjure in Paris.\n\n\nFelicia was curious about how Wyatt had become the owner of the diamond, and Wyatt and Hope explained the circumstances of his inheritance and gift to Hope. Felicia contended that it was an extravagant gift. Rick said Quinn and Ricardo had known each other for a long time, and Felicia guessed that Wyatt had his mother to thank for the jewel. \"Yeah, what do you mean?\" Wyatt pointedly asked. Rick said Felicia meant that Quinn's association with Ricardo had helped Ricardo's inheritance choice.\n\n\nWyatt grew tense when Felicia asked about the rumors that Quinn had attacked Liam. Hope asserted that Quinn had gone through a difficult time, but everyone was happy that she'd taken the step to get the help that she needed.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt and Hope strode around the gardens. He told her to imagine all the reporters there to see her and the diamond the next day. They had an iconic landmark, an iconic diamond, and an iconic woman, and he was certain the diamond would change their fortunes again. Wyatt asked Hope not to let Liam ruin the adventure for her.\n\n\nHope scoffed, and her smile faded. Wyatt insisted that Liam only upset her and complicated things, and if Liam didn't show up, she needed to cut him loose and keep her dignity. Wyatt stated that he'd already given her the diamond, and she never had to question where she stood with him. He claimed that she meant everything to him, and if Liam didn't show up, Wyatt wanted to make Hope his.\n\n\nIn the Forrester studio, Oliver guessed Aly was bummed about not going to Paris. She joked that with everyone gone, somebody had to be the boss around there. Oliver noted that the press conference would be live-streamed on the Internet. Aly hoped that Liam would go to Paris, because he'd be making a big mistake if he didn't. Oliver said they had a lot riding on the shoot.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam quickly packed up his bag. Alison told him that the Spencer jet was out of the country, so she'd booked him a first class commercial flight to Paris. There would be a car waiting for him in Paris to take him to his destination. Liam was excited to surprise Hope by meeting her after her photo shoot. Alison left, and Liam gazed at the wedding band he'd had in his pocket.\n\n\nLiam called Ivy to let her know that he'd gotten his airplane ticket. Ivy relayed that her work visa had gone through, but it was too late for her to go to Paris. Liam invited Ivy to go along with him and said that he'd get Alison to book her a ticket. Ivy told him that she'd meet him at the airport.\n\n\nLater, Pam rushed into Rick's office with some clothes for Ivy to pack for the trip. Pam showed Ivy a crocheted sweater. Ivy frowned and declined it until Pam said she'd made it herself. Aly entered in time to hear that Ivy was going to Paris with Liam, and Aly instructed Ivy to make sure Liam got there in time to meet Hope. Aly grinned to herself as Ivy rushed out.\n\n\nAly went to the studio to gush to Oliver about Liam taking off for Paris. Aly thought it was dreamy and romantic, but Oliver stated it would only be if Liam, who hadn't had much luck, actually made it. Aly said that Quinn and Steffy were gone and wondered what could go wrong. Oliver guessed a delayed flight or bad weather. Aly insisted that everything would finally work out for Hope and Liam.\n\n\nOliver asked what would happen if it didn't turn out that way. Expressing her abiding faith in Hope and Liam, Aly announced that she'd throw a party upon their return.\n\n\nTo show Aly that Liam wasn't the only romantic guy, Oliver set up a special lunch in the studio for Aly, complete with Parisian foods. Aly remarked about how romantic he'd been as the yellow knight, and the two flashed back on their time at the castle.\n\n\nAly said he'd been a handsome knight. Oliver figured he'd gotten in good with the castle attendants, and he might be able to borrow the costume. She responded that he didn't need it, and he'd always be her knight in shining armor -- just like Liam was Hope's.\n\n\nIn the Spencer parking lot, Liam put his bag in his Tesla and told someone on the phone that he had to reschedule a meeting because he'd be in Paris. When Liam drove out of the parking lot, Quinn stood up from her crouched position behind a nearby car and strode off with purpose.\n\n\nLater, Liam sat in his seat on the airplane. Scott Clifton's \"Gravity\" played as Liam flashed back on his years-long romance with Hope. Ivy rushed down the aisle to take her seat beside Liam just moments before takeoff. A couple aisles back, Quinn, cloaked in a scarf and sunglasses, lowered the magazine that had shielded her face.\n\n\nDuring the flight, Ivy and Liam toasted to wise decisions. Quinn listened from a row back as Liam thanked Ivy for her advice. He said that he didn't want to lose Hope, but if he didn't show up, that was exactly what would happen. Liam explained that Hope didn't know he was on the way, but he'd get to their meeting spot at three sharp in the afternoon.\n\n\nProducing a ring from his pocket, Liam said Hope would have her wedding band, and he'd have his. Quinn grimaced when Liam told Ivy that he planned to marry Hope in Paris. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope and Wyatt stroll through Paris. They sit on a bench with the Eiffel Tower in background. He tells her these are truly icons, her and the Eiffel Tower and they are going to truly take Paris by storm. She looks over her shoulder and says yes it is a trip they will never forget. He seems to sense what she is thinking and asks if she really thinks Liam is going to show. Liam is at Spencer's and Alison hands him his first class tickets on commercial since the Spencer jet is out of the country. Pam surprises Ivy by saying it is here \u0096 her work permit to stay in the states. She can now go to Paris. Aly tells Oliver that Paris would have been fun but she is okay; she'd rather be there with him. She says besides Rick and Hope are in Paris and her dad and Taylor are on vacation so somebody has to be in charge around here. Oliver says then he is dating the boss and he kind of likes that. He says the showing will be live streaming so it will be sort of like they are in Paris only they aren't. There is a lot riding on this photo shoot. The whole world is watching. Felicia verifies to Rick that the shoot is on lockdown, everything is set. So now they just need Hope and Wyatt. Right on cue, they stroll in. Hope introduces Felicia to Wyatt who says he is happy to see her again. They are unbelievably excited about tomorrow and Wyatt just hopes there are no distractions. Liam calls Ivy and says he just wanted her to know that he is taking her advice and will be flying to Paris. She's happy; says she wishes she were going but her work permit just came through a little too late. He says no; he is heading to LAX right now so he can get Alison to get her a ticket too. She says he can fax her the details and she will meet him at the airport. Quinn calls Wyatt to see how the day is going. He says not that well. Hope invited Liam to meet her there. He's not here yet. She says he just gave Hope the diamond so Wyatt can't lose the girl and the rock too. He says forget what he just said and whatever she does, just stay away from Liam. He wants to be clear on that. Quinn smiles and says yes loud and clear. When Hope asks, Wyatt fibs and says it was only someone from his warehouse and he did not want to deal with it right now. Hope thanks Felicia for filling in for Thorne and pulling this together so fast. Wyatt says the diamond has been magic in the past and it will again in Paris. There is no telling what kind of magic it is capable of. Pam helps Ivy pack. Although she is not going, Aly is delighted to hear that Ivy is going and meeting Liam and that he is going to be with Hope in Paris. They say goodbye and the last thing Aly tells Ivy is to make sure Liam gets to Hope. As Liam drives off from the parking lot, Quinn is hiding behind another car close by. She is disguised all in black with sunshades and a scarf around her head. Aly gushes to Oliver about how dreamy it is that Liam is going to Paris. Oliver says he likes Liam but he is not lucky in the good luck department. It is always one thing or the other with him. Aly tells him to bite his tongue. Nothing bad is going to happen in Paris. She has a lot of faith in them and she is going to plan a party for them when they get back. Felicia brings up Ricardo and why he left the diamond to Wyatt who is not a relative. Hope jumps in and says Ricardo knew how much Wyatt appreciated the diamond. Felicia also asks if Quinn had known Ricardo for long ..so Wyatt might say his mother was instrumental in him getting the diamond. She doesn't want to make Wyatt uncomfortable but she asks where his mother is now. She heard she attacked Liam. Again Hope jumps in and says Quinn went through a really bad time but she is seeking help and they are all glad she has taken that step. Oliver has Aly close her eyes and he guides her to a seat where he has displayed a gorgeous romantic French dinner ..since they could not go to Paris he brought it here. He says Liam is not the only romantic one. She says he will always be her knight in shining armor. Liam boards first but is waiting for Ivy who soon joins. Both are bubbling over about this trip. Just behind them is Quinn in her disguise reading a magazine. Ivy tells Liam that she thinks he is making the right decision. He laments yeah once he got over his huge ego, making this decision was easy. He says Hope has no idea he is coming. They have this special place and are to meet at 3 P. M. close to the Eiffel Tower. Hope has her ring and he has his and he plans to put it on her and they will be married in Paris. Quinn frowns at this. Hope and Wyatt stroll again along the Seine River. They are gushing about tomorrow but then he stops and tells her to do him a favor and not let Liam ruin this adventure for her. He always does. It's always complicated with him and always will be. If he doesn't show up then get out with her dignity still in tact. Just cut Liam loose. He scoffs that he has already given her the diamond and he doesn't want to take it back. She would never have to wonder where she stood with him. She means everything to him. He states that if Liam doesn't show up, he wants to make Hope his.",
