    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Maya placed her wedding garment bag on the bed. Rick and she text-messaged each other about their wedding excitement. Downstairs, Brooke hoped Rick wasn't exchanging selfies and said it was bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. Bridget entered, asking if it was okay for the groom to see his sister. \"Bridget!\" Rick exclaimed, hugging her.\n\n\nBeforehand, Bridget had said she couldn't make it, but she'd figured out how to get time off so she wouldn't miss another family event. The Avants arrived, and Rick enthusiastically introduced them to his sister, \"Budge.\" Vivienne asked if Bridget was in the fashion business. Bridget said she dabbled, and Rick joked that his sister was a doctor, which was a family embarrassment they didn't talk about.\n\n\nLater, Bridget greeted Zende, who she claimed had grown \"so much\" since she and Logan had seen him the previous year in Miami. She explained that Logan was \"glamping\" with Owen and Jackie in a camper with a tub. Bridget noticed Katie arriving, and Bill walked in, too.\n\n\nRick rushed to the door to make Bill leave. Bill said he wasn't there to ruin the wedding day. He was there to apologize. Rick assumed Katie had put Bill up to it, but she said she couldn't make Bill do anything he didn't want to do. Bill said there was something wrong with him, not being invited to the wedding of Katie's nephew.\n\n\nBill wanted to stay for the wedding to show that he respected that they'd withstood all he'd thrown at them and had still made it to that day. Rick replied that Bill had hurt Maya, so she'd decide.\n\n\nNearby, Brooke asked if there were any special doctors in Bridget's life. Bridget asked if Brooke wanted Bridget to set her up. Brooke replied that she was enjoying the single life, and Bridget stated that she was spending her time concentrating on her son.\n\n\nAt the door, Eric greeted Nick and Carter and asked how Carter liked Nick taking over the wedding duties. Carter was glad to be able to sit back and enjoy a wedding.\n\n\nUpstairs, bridesmaid Nicole arrived to help Maya get ready. Maya recalled helping her mother set up for potluck weddings. Maya would sneak off to see the bride, who'd always been joyful and nervous. Maya had known that she'd wanted it someday, and she'd been picturing it for a long time.\n\n\nMaya sent Nicole to find Nick. Rick arrived with his hand over his face to prevent seeing her. She claimed it was okay because she hadn't put on the dress yet. Uncovering his eyes, he told her that they had a wedding guest problem, but the person wouldn't stay unless she approved it.\n\n\nKatie and Bill entered, and upset, Maya asserted, \"No. Not okay.\" Bill asked to be heard. He said he and Maya would be parts of the same family, and he didn't want tension between them. Maya said Bill wanted her to shrug off what he'd done, but she wanted to know if Bill was sincerely sorry.\n\n\nBill said he was sorry. Maya asked what he was sorry for. He replied that it was for the whole deal. She asked if he was sorry for selling magazines and making money on it. Bill opened his mouth, hesitated, and said, \"No, I'm not.\" Bill was in business to make money and was never unhappy to do so.\n\n\nBill felt he'd made a \"damn good\" business decision, but it had crossed a personal line. He said he could have asked for an exclusive for Maya to express her story in her own way. He'd smelled blood and gone in for the kill without full consideration of how it would affect her.\n\n\nBill said he was man enough to admit the mistake. Maya guessed he expected her to be man enough to forgive him. \"Exactly. That's -- \" Bill cut himself off. \"That's cute. You almost got me there.\"\n\n\nMaya claimed that Bill had almost gotten her, too -- almost gotten her to leave her job, her town, and her fianc\u00e9. She had learned not to hang on to anger. She accepted the apology. She was happy that Bill would stay to see what she and Rick had and that Bill would never scare her away. She said she might give him an exclusive, as long as the profits went to a charity of her choosing.\n\n\nBill and Katie left, and Rick said he was proud of Maya. Rick didn't think Bill deserved forgiveness. Hugging Rick, she said everyone did.\n\n\nDownstairs later, Eric straightened Rick's tie and asked if Rick was wearing the watch. Presenting it on his wrist, Rick said the bride had traditions, and he wanted to have one, too. He couldn't think of anything better than wearing the watch from his father and best man.\n\n\nNearby, Julius asked if Zende really liked the fashion business. Zende did thus far. Julius asked if Zende really wanted to make clothes for a living. Vivienne sharply called Julius to her side. Approaching Zende, Nicole asked how embarrassed she should be. He asked how insulting his family business ranked. He added that fathers were made to embarrass their children.\n\n\nAside, Julius asked what he'd said. Vivienne told him that she was stopping him before he did say something. Julius stated that Zende seemed to be a guy's guy, who wouldn't be excited about women's clothing. \"You mean like our son was?\" Vivienne snipped. She told Julius to try for their daughter's wedding day -- as he said he'd do.\n\n\n\"Oh, yippie. I can't wait to see our son skipping down the aisle,\" Julius quipped. Vivienne reprimanded him, but he said she knew how he felt. He didn't agree with what Myron had done, and it was wrong to mess with nature. \"Well, she did, okay? And she's our child,\" Vivienne asserted.\n\n\nVivienne knew it was hard for Julius because she'd struggled with it, too, but all she wanted was for him to keep his negative comments to himself. She didn't want him ruining Maya's wedding day. Julius claimed not to want to ruin it. Vivienne said she was going to wish their daughter well and asked if he wanted to go with her. He didn't. As she walked off, he stared at the portrait above the fireplace.\n\n\nUpstairs, Vivienne gasped to see Maya in her gown. Vivienne felt embarrassed that she had something for Maya to wear, but Maya was flawless already. Maya urged Vivienne to present it and was emotional upon seeing her grandmother's bracelet, which Vivienne had worn all the time.\n\n\nNicole entered to say that it was time. She escorted her mother back downstairs, where Julius was telling Nick that if he finished quickly, he could get in a round of golf later. Nicole told Nick that Maya was almost ready, and he went to take up his station. Julius told Nicole that he'd expected to be walking her down the aisle, and \"this\" was an adjustment. Nicole stiffly said to be happy for Maya, and then there would be no need for adjustment.\n\n\nNicole walked off, and Julius griped that happiness wasn't something he could switch on and off. Vivienne and he went beneath the staircase. Above, Maya stood on the overlook to wait for Julius to walk with her. She looked down when she heard her parents talking below her.\n\n\nVivienne said Julius could get through it. Julius really wanted to get through it. He felt it should be easy to be happy for Maya because of the future she was marrying into and the good it might also do for them; however, he didn't think it would last, and Hollywood types didn't view marriage the way \"we\" do. Noting that Rick had two ex-wives, Julius asked how long it would before the novelty wore off.\n\n\nVivienne told Julius to stop. Julius said that Rick was rich and handsome and could have any woman he wanted. \"But he's marrying into a freak show? A woman made by surgery? It's not going to be long before he wants the real thing again,\" Julius reasoned.\n\n\nIn a forceful whisper, Vivienne ordered Julius to shut his mouth. Julius said he knew that he was supposed to stuff it down and keep it inside. He'd told Maya that he wanted to be \"inside\" her life. He vowed to bite his tongue, march what used to be their son down the aisle, and  hand her over to a man as if it were normal.\n\n\nJulius stated that he'd smile through the joke of a ceremony, say the right things, and do all the right things to protect Maya's day; however, it would be acting because he was trying to make himself accept and believe what he felt was wrong, sick, and unnatural. He couldn't accept it, and he wouldn't accept it. \"What she did, and who she is -- it just isn't right,\" he concluded. Above them, Maya suppressed sobs.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "It's the day of Rick and Maya's wedding. Presumably with some urging from Katie, Bill shows up at the Forrester Mansion to apologize for exploiting Maya's story on his magazines. Eric and Brooke are hopeful that Rick will finally find happiness with wife No. 3. Just then, the long-missing Bridget arrives from New York to witness her brother getting married once more. Eric quips that Carter is getting a rest on this occasion as Nick is officiating the ceremony. Just before Maya starts her walk down the aisle, Vivienne confronts Julius about his more and more apparent indisposition. Julius finally admits that he tried but just cannot accept this farce. He will continue to pretend that he is in favor of \"his son\" getting married but inside he won't. From the landing, Maya hears every single word and is in tears!",
    "tvmega_recap": "The Forrester house is all abuzz with festivities. Even Bridget comes home and surprises them. Maya can not believe this is really happening, she is getting married. Rick introduces Vivienne and Julius to Bridget. She in turn hugs Zende. She says he sure has grown up since she has seen him. Katie and Bill walk in, but Rick balks at that. He tells Bill no, he is not invited or welcome here. Katie asks him to let him stay, Bill has something to say. Bill says he is not here to bash Maya. He is really here to apologize to her and would like to stay for the wedding. Rick listens and says that will be up to Maya. She initially says no but Bill steps forward and says they are going to be part of an extended family so they need to put their feelings aside and accept each other. He made a business decision and went in for the kill without giving Maya consideration how it would affect her. That was his mistake. He hopes she will be man enough to forgive him. She says it was cruel and unnecessary but she can not change other people's minds, so yes she will accept his apology. He can then see first hand how happy they are and how he can never scare her again. Rick tells her that he is so proud of her. Maya reminds Nick about when they first met and she was just starting on this journey and now she is a bride. Vivienne pulls Julius away before he can embarrass himself even more. He asks Zende if he really wants to make women's clothes. She tells him to please keep his negative thoughts to himself. It is a family business of long standing and they are proud of it. He has no right to put them down. Vivienne goes upstairs to be with Maya and says she came to help but she sees now she is fine and looks flawless. Still she would like to give her something if Maya will have it .a bracelet from her mother. Maya is thrilled. Nicole makes a point to her father to be on his best behavior. He still makes a remark about his daughter and him walking her down the aisle. Alone with Vivienne but with Maya on the banister looking down and hearing it, Julius has venom in his voice when he says this is not right. He will say all the right things today but he can not accept it. These rich people are all alike and he does not believe this marriage will last. Rick could have any woman he wants and it won't be long before he will want a real woman and not the man they raised. It is not natural and he will never accept this. Maya is crushed.",
