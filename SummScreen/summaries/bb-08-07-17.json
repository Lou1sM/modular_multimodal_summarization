Due to the burning incense and exotic music, Charlie, who couldn't see Beatrice, guessed that Sheila was doing some new-age meditation thingy. He warned that she couldn't \"om\" herself back into Eric's life, and she needed to face the reality that he was married to Quinn. \"For now,\" Sheila added.\n\n\nCharlie asked if Sheila and he could agree that if Quinn and Eric broke up, it wasn't because of Charlie. Sheila joked that she could agree that Charlie's passionate kisses hadn't broken up the marriage. She told him to relax because she had figured the cheating out on her own. He replied that they both had the power of observation, but Eric probably wouldn't have caught on. She said Eric had finally found out about it and knew that Quinn didn't deserve him.\n\n\nCharlie got irritated with trying to talk to Sheila while she wasn't looking at him, and he wanted to know who the silent friend was and what she was working on. Beatrice decided \"this\" wasn't working for her, and she needed a break. Sheila said they'd continue once she got rid of her friend. Beatrice left the room. Charlie rounded the curtain and saw a head sketch of Sheila on an easel. He asked if it was what he thought it was.\n\n\nCharlie deduced that Sheila expected to have a portrait to hang at the mansion. Sheila said the sketch was just preliminary. A real portrait would take time, but she vowed that it would happen. He quipped that she didn't need time; she needed a psychiatrist and a miracle.\n\n\nSheila asked if Charlie knew what a vision board was. Charlie replied that Pam had one in her closet, and it was full of wedding gowns. \"Whatever that's about,\" he added. Sheila believed that all she needed to make her miracle happen was the proper vision board, and that was what she was making. She asserted that her portrait would hang in the Forrester mansion \"again.\" It was her goal, and she would achieve it.\n\n\nCharlie asked what would happen if Eric forgave Quinn. Sheila said she knew where she needed to be. Sheila knew what she wanted, which was to be Eric's wife again, and whoever didn't think that would happen was in for a big surprise.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Ridge were in the CEO's office when Ridge spotted Carter walking in the corridor. Ridge got Carter's attention, and Carter entered with papers he was taking to Eric. Ridge assumed Carter was taking divorce papers to the house so Eric could divorce Quinn.\n\n\nCarter couldn't comment on it. Ridge asked to see the papers, but Carter said he had to personally deliver them. After Carter had exited, Ridge closed the door. He told Steffy that Quinn didn't deserve it and could be a good wife if Eric let her.\n\n\nSteffy asked if the divorce opened a door for Ridge. Ridge told her to not be ridiculous, but Steffy didn't think it was ridiculous when he'd been the one kissing Quinn. He insisted that there was nothing there, and he didn't know why he'd even done it.\n\n\nSteffy asked if he'd moved on from Quinn. He said he'd never been with Quinn. Steffy was sure he had to be seeing someone, but Ridge was adamant that he wasn't. \"Ridge Forrester celibate? I guess there's a first time for everything,\" Steffy quipped. Ridge said he'd been soul searching. He'd realized it was time to grow up, and maybe the last disaster, losing Brooke over a few kisses, would help him wake up. \"And now Quinn has lost your grandfather,\" he added.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Quinn tried to convince Eric that she'd messed up, but it didn't erase all that they'd shared before. As he flashed back on the times they'd had together, she implored him to give her just one more chance.\n\n\nEric didn't think she'd changed and said she'd been lying to his face the whole time about it. She replied that she'd been torn up about it, but the old Quinn wouldn't have cared as long as she'd gotten her way. The person she'd become couldn't look herself in the mirror.\n\n\nThe sobbing Quinn said she'd changed because of Eric and how she'd seen herself in his eyes. She'd somehow learned to be who she'd seen reflected there. She'd give anything to see that woman in his eyes again.\n\n\nSomeone knocked on the front door. Eric answered it. Carter entered with the papers he'd drawn up with all the conditions Eric had asked for. Eric took the document from the envelope. He told Quinn that if she had changed, then she would sign the divorce papers and let him go.\n\n\nAs Quinn read the documents, Carter suggested she have her own attorney review them. Quinn asked if she was reading \"zero dollars\" correctly. She also noted that her job was terminated. Eric stated that she couldn't use the Forrester name professionally or personally. She was banned from the building and the mansion, per restraining order.\n\n\nQuinn sobbed about the restraining order and said Eric knew how she felt about him. Eric told her to show him by letting him move on from it. Quinn reviewed that she'd have no money, she'd lose her name, and she had to leave her home. Eric stated that it was what he wanted.\n\n\nQuinn agreed to do it if it was what Eric wanted. She signed the papers. Eric thanked her and said she could go \"now.\" Crying, she held them out to Eric and apologized for hurting him. She sobbed, saying they were his guarantee that she never hurt him again, but she'd love him forever. Quinn took her purse and walked to the door.\n\n\nBehind her, Quinn heard papers ripping. She turned around and saw that Eric had ripped up the document that she'd just signed. \"What are you doing?\" she asked. Eric replied that he'd needed to be sure. He told Carter that they wouldn't file any papers, and Carter exited.\n\n\nQuinn didn't know what was happening. Eric beckoned her to him. Holding her hands, he said she'd made a whole new life for him, honest and committed, but she'd taken it from him. He knew she hadn't meant to, but she'd done it. He saw her regret. He saw that she'd been willing to give up her career and her home.\n\n\nQuinn cried that it had never been about those things. It had always been about Eric. \"Because you love me,\" he replied. Quinn proclaimed that she did. Eric wanted to give it another chance, but nothing like that could ever happen again. She said it never would, and he replied that he believed in her. Crying, she said he wouldn't regret it, and they emotionally hugged.\n\n\nIn the design office, Katie thought she and Wyatt needed to think about what they were doing. Wyatt believed that thinking was overrated. She reminded him that she'd been married to his father, and she cringed because she'd said it aloud. Wyatt said that the marriages had between two epic fails, and Bill had moved on. \"Why can't you?\" Wyatt asked.\n\n\nCharlotte entered with an extra latte from her coffee run. She directed the statement at Wyatt, but as an afterthought, she said it was for whoever wanted it. It turned out to be caramel, Wyatt's favorite. Charlotte giggled about the coincidence and said, \"You know how to reach me if you need anything else -- oh, either of you.\"\n\n\nCharlotte left, and Wyatt told Katie that she'd been about to kiss him before the interruption. Katie didn't remember all that. Wyatt tried to kiss her, but she pulled back. His phone rang, and he stepped out to take a conference call.\n\n\nKatie paced around in the office, patting her phone in her hand. She sent off a text message.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Wyatt finished his call. He received a message from Katie, asking to meet at Il Giardino. Grinning, he texted her back.\n\n\nWhen Wyatt arrived at the restaurant, he glanced around and saw Charlotte waving him over to her at the bar. He mentioned that it was a surprise to see her. He planned to sit at a table because he was meeting someone there. He said Katie had asked him to be there. Charlotte replied that Katie had sent a message instructing Charlotte to meet Wyatt. Charlotte realized that someone was playing matchmaker, not that Charlotte minded it.\n\n\nCharlotte went to put their names on the waiting list, and Wyatt called Katie. \"Charlotte? Seriously?\" he said when Katie answered. Katie didn't see the problem. She thought Charlotte was a lovely young woman who was probably more suited for Wyatt than Katie was. He asked if Katie really felt that way, and she affirmed it.\n\n\nWyatt said that he knew it would be complicated for Katie and him, but he'd thought that, \"we were...I don't know. Whatever. Never mind,\" he said and ended the call. On Katie's end, Katie stared at the phone, agonizing over whether to call him back.\n\n\nCharlotte returned to the bar and said it would be fifteen minutes. She'd thought Wyatt would follow her to the hostess station. He asked what for. \"For this,\" she replied and kissed his cheek.\n\n\nLater, Katie told herself that she was going to sit down and work because work was what she did best. The moment she did, flashbacks of Monaco entered her mind.\n\n\nThe office door opened, and Wyatt strode into the room. As Katie tried to ask what he was doing there instead of being at lunch with Charlotte, Wyatt swept Katie into a kiss. She resisted, saying that they couldn't do it, but Wyatt kissed her into acquiescence.\n\n\n",
