    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester CEO office, Brooke arrived at work early and was surprised to see Aly also there at that hour. Aly beamed about the most romantic moment in Liam and Hope's lives thus far. Brooke didn't know what Aly meant, and Aly said Liam had to meet Hope in Paris that day if he wanted a future with her. Aly announced that Liam had taken a flight to be there in time.\n\n\nOn the airplane, the incognito Quinn scowled as she listened to Liam and Ivy discuss that Hope and Liam would be choosing a future together that day. \"Some girls get all the luck,\" Ivy drawled and asked if Liam thought Wyatt would put up a fight.\n\n\nLiam said that Wyatt had better not because Hope had chosen to be with Liam. Liam declared that there would be no more Wyatt or his crazy mother. Ivy asked if Quinn had really tried to kill Liam. He asserted that it was true, and Quinn was really dangerous.\n\n\nThe plane landed, and when Liam helped a woman with her bag, the woman said that Ivy had herself a keeper. Ivy agreed that he was a true gentleman, but Liam felt it hadn't gotten him far because women preferred the bad boy type. \"Some women,\" Ivy reasoned. Patting the pocket containing his ring, Liam said Wyatt wouldn't get away with it anymore.\n\n\nQuinn spied on Liam and Ivy as they met the car that awaited them outside Charles De Gaulle Airport. Quinn hopped onto someone's motorbike to pursue the vehicle, and a man shouted for the police as Quinn sped away.\n\n\nIn his car, Liam requested that the driver hurry. Ivy asked if they'd make it in time, and as Quinn detoured onto the sidewalk to keep up with their car, Liam said he was sure they would.\n\n\nFinally, the Eiffel Tower appeared in the foreground as the car rushed forward, and Liam cheered because they were close. The car rolled to a stop in traffic, and Ivy and Liam grew concerned about the time.\n\n\nIn the fountain gardens, Hope prepared for the photo shoot of her life, and her assistant told her that Rick and Felicia wanted her to go ahead with it while they were still in meetings with marketers. Wyatt said that once he put the diamond on Hope, she'd have nerves of steel.\n\n\nSeductive Parisian music played as the photo shoot commenced in the fountain gardens in front of the Eiffel Tower. Hope posed in a series of glamorous gowns and leaned in ways to showcase the diamond necklace. Hope modeled four gowns in total.\n\n\nAfter the shoot, the press gathered to hear Hope speak about the new line that she'd created. She claimed that her goal had been to have eco-friendly fashion for young women, and as her line had developed, so had her dedication to social responsibility and empowering young women. She believed that fashion had the ability to transcend boundaries and cultures.\n\n\nHope showcased the diamond on her neck and said that it defined beauty in its truest form. It was a reminder to protect and cherish the earth. It represented protecting everything that the earth had given them, and it was an inspiration to lead the next generation into a future that would shine as bright as the diamond.\n\n\nA reporter asked if the diamond would be housed in the Paris boutique. Hope said it was making a European tour through Brussels, London, and Milan. Reporters inquired about the Stephanie Forrester Collection. Dubbing the idea another brilliant one from Wyatt Spencer, Hope said she hoped Stephanie's collection would be in Paris in the near future.\n\n\nA reporter asked why Wyatt was still working for Forrester, but his mother had taken a break. Wyatt replied that his mother had needed the break, not him. Someone asked what made Wyatt and Hope a great team. Hope replied that they each believed in the power of HFTF.\n\n\nSomeone asked for Wyatt and Hope to pose for photos, and another reporter noted that there were questions surrounding Ricardo Montemayor's death. When the reporter said there might be an investigation, Wyatt feigned surprise. He said he was sure the investigation was just routine, and Ricardo's death had been a terrible loss to many. Hope agreed and said Ricardo would not be forgotten.\n\n\nAfter the press conference, Wyatt and Hope milled around near the Eiffel Tower. Hope remarked that she hadn't heard about an investigation into Ricardo's death. Wyatt dismissed it, saying that the reporter had been being thorough.\n\n\nWyatt suggested that they get a bite to eat, but Hope said he knew she couldn't. When Hope stopped walking, he guessed they were at the special spot and wondered where Liam was. She said Liam wasn't there yet, but he still had time.\n\n\nWyatt stated that Liam wasn't arriving, but Hope insisted that Liam would. She took off the diamond necklace and handed it back to Wyatt. \"You know I can't,\" she said when Wyatt looked sad. She stated that the jewel belonged to him. Hope grew tearful as Wyatt walked away.\n\n\nAs Hope waited for Liam, Wyatt perched by a tree and watched.\n\n\nBack in traffic, Liam and Ivy abandoned the car to go quicker on foot. Behind them, Quinn left her bike in traffic and chased after them. Ivy and Liam sprinted up some stairs and through some stone archways. Liam ran until he arrived at a platform across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower. He took a huge breath and pressed forward, sprinting closer and closer to the tower.\n\n\nIvy scrambled to keep up with Liam, and Quinn lagged even further behind Ivy. Liam spotted Hope as he crossed the long bridge over the Seine. Catching up to Liam, Ivy told him to hurry, and she'd stay behind to take a picture of the couple.\n\n\nIvy sat on the stone rail of the bridge to get her phone ready. Quinn strode at a determined pace, stuck her arm out, and shoved the unsuspecting Ivy over the stone rail. Quinn kept walking with a satisfied grin as Ivy screamed and hit the water beneath the bridge.\n\n\nHearing the splash and scream, Liam ran back down the bridge to find Ivy treading water below him. Ivy insisted that he go, and she'd swim to the side. He was worried that she'd drown, but she screamed for him to go. Liam was torn as his stare darted between Hope and the floating Ivy. \n\n\n",

Unaware of what is going on in Paris, Aly fills Brooke in on Liam and Hope\u2019s plans to meet.

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope gets ready for the photo shoot of her life. She meets with Wyatt and press gal, Eva. He says once she gets this diamond baby on her, she will have nerves of steel. Quinn is straining her neck on the plane to listen or see what Ivy and Liam are talking about \u0096 the special spot in Paris that he is going to meet Hope. Ivy says some girls get all the luck, then Hope will know that he has a future planned with her. He says thank goodness no more Wyatt or his crazy mom. She chose the diamond for the shoot but she is choosing a future with him. Brooke comes into the office early. Says she could not sleep just thinking about Hope and the diamond shoot. Aly says she can't wait until Hope sees Liam. Brooke is surprised and knows nothing about it. Aly says he is to meet Hope after the shoot at the tower so all he has to do is get there today on time. Liam and Ivy get off the plane and a still disguised Quinn is last. They have a car at the airport and get inside while Quinn waits around and finds an opportunity to grab a parked moped in front and takes off after Liam's car. Liam is nervous; the traffic is terrible, he just wants to get there as fast as he can. Luckily Quinn can even get up on the sidewalks and bypass the traffic. Hope's photo shoot goes well with her looking absolutely gorgeous in several different gowns highlighting the diamond necklace. Then she takes questions and answers that it will be shown in Paris, Milan, Brussels and London. They ask about Quinn and Wyatt says she needed a break, he didn't. They ask him about Ricardo's death. Wyatt skirts that by saying if there is an investigation he is sure it is because he was loved by so many. Afterwards when Wyatt and Hope are wandering through the Trocadero gardens, she says she had no idea that Ricardo's death was being investigated. Again Wyatt laments that he is sure they are just being as thorough as they can be. He says they should go celebrate. She says he knows she can't. This is her special spot right here to wait for Liam. Wyatt looks around and no Liam. He says he doesn't think he is coming. Hope says yes he is. She takes off the diamond and hands it to Wyatt. She says it is his and she can't keep it. Without a word he reluctantly walks away. Hope waits anxiously while Wyatt stands under a tree and watches her without her seeing him. At the last minute when it looks like he will be late, Liam tells the cab driver to drop off the bags at FI. He and Ivy jump out and start running up the stairs to get to the Bridge by the Seine River. Quinn is not far behind on foot also. All are literally running as fast as they can. Liam sees the Eiffel Tower and he's out of breath but continues toward it. Ivy catches up. They see Hope on the other side of the river and she tells him to go on, she will stay behind and give him time with Hope. She rests a bit by sitting on the ledge of the bridge. She is taking a selfie. Quinn smiles and walks slowly up to her and gently pushes her. Ivy goes splat in the water below. Liam hears it and turns around and comes back. He sees Ivy. She is not drowning and tells him to go on, be on time. He looks at Hope, he looks at Ivy. What to do?",
