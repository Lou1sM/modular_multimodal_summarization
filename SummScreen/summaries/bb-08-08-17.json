Quinn was grateful that Eric had a huge heart and capacity for forgiveness. \"So much more than I deserve. I am never going to let you down,\" she said. They embraced and nearly kissed, but the phone rang.\n\n\nEric answered the house phone, and Pam said, \"Eric?\" Eric said he was home. Pam said she had called for Quinn. Eric told Pam that they were going to work on their marriage. \"I don't want you going on about this,\" Eric told Pam.\n\n\n\"I'd rather have you back with her than with the whack job Sheila,\" Pam said. Eric hung up and said he would see her at work. Quinn told Eric that she hadn't realized how big the house was until she had been alone without him. She added that it had always seemed so cozy when they were there together.\n\n\nEric apologized for leaving her. He said he'd needed to figure out his way back to her. He realized that they were deeply connected and always had been from the very first day they'd met. Quinn agreed, and they gushed about how they'd missed each other. They kissed. \"My husband is back. I can breathe again,\" Quinn said with a sigh.\n\n\nEric and Quinn kissed and hugged. He stopped and told her to stay where she was. He played the piano and admired her. They hugged and kissed. Eric admitted that he had hated that he hadn't been able to touch her when he'd been gone.\n\n\nEric added that he'd realized how important their marriage was when he'd arrived home and looked out on the patio. \"You were almost killed,\" he said. Quinn promised she would never give him a reason to leave. \"Never again,\" she said. They kissed.\n\n\nQuinn thanked Eric because she had been a dark soul when they'd first met. She gushed that he had embraced her with all her faults. She said she was so filled with love that she felt she would burst from happiness. \"We found each other twice. How blessed we are,\" she said.\n\n\nQuinn added that she never wanted to feel as hollow as she had while he'd been gone, but she acknowledged that she'd brought it on herself. She wanted to rededicate herself to their marriage.\n\n\nEric agreed. He pointed out that he had never expected Quinn to be flawless and perfect, but he wanted her to be committed. She nodded. She said it was odd that one almost had to lose something in order to appreciate it. \"I appreciate you, Eric,\" she said. She was glad \"to call the greatest man in the world my husband. I love you, and I am 100 percent committed to you. Never doubt that.\" They kissed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Katie chastised Wyatt. \"You can't just walk in here and start kissing me,\" she said. Wyatt didn't see a problem. He believed they had nothing to hide. She suggested he should hang out with the very young Charlotte, the intern. Wyatt argued that he wasn't interested in Charlotte.\n\n\nKatie said Wyatt's offer to be with Katie sounded very tempting, but she felt it was wrong on many levels, including age. She wondered if Wyatt had lost his mind.\n\n\nWyatt wanted to explore their relationship. \"You and I are adults, both single and free,\" he said. Katie admitted that Wyatt was awesome, charming, and sexy, and he made her laugh. \"I just can't ignore Quinn and Bill,\" she said.\n\n\nWyatt argued that Katie couldn't be thinking about all of that when they were close to each other. Katie agreed, and they started to make out. After Katie and Wyatt had made out for a while on the couch, Katie got up and said she needed to slow down the relationship. Wyatt understood. Katie wondered if they were friends or maybe could be friends with benefits. Wyatt argued that it didn't need a label because they were attracted to one another.\n\n\nKatie said she liked to label, compartmentalize, and analyze things. Wyatt laughed and told her she needed to shut her brain off. Wyatt said he didn't care about the future because he couldn't control it at that point.\n\n\nWyatt said he wanted to have fun. Katie said it was time to have fun. Katie smiled, and they gushed about how much they liked each other. Wyatt wanted to pursue a relationship.\n\n\nAt Sheila's place, Charlie visited. Sheila posed for a portrait, and an artist named Beatrice painted her. The artist noted that they had accomplished enough for one day, and she planned to continue the next day. Beatrice left.\n\n\nCharlie scoffed that Sheila had commissioned a portrait of herself to hang on the wall in place of Quinn's portrait at the Forrester mansion. Sheila said it would happen. She wanted it to happen because Stephanie's portrait had been there as well. She started shouting about how she had been Eric's wife, and she would be again. She was confident that it would happen. Charlie winced.\n\n\nCharlie said that Eric was madly in love with Quinn and had gone home to reconcile with her. Sheila argued that Eric would have returned to his home to ask for a divorce. \"I wouldn't be surprised if he was kicking her out of his life,\" Sheila said.\n\n\nCharlie countered that Sheila had underestimated Quinn. Pam called Charlie and asked where he was. She told him that Eric and Quinn were back together, and he had returned home. Charlie promised to return to the office. Charlie explained to Quinn that Eric had returned to Quinn.\n\n\nSheila was devastated that Eric had taken Quinn back. Sheila cried, \"How could he? How could he do that?\"\n\n\nCharlie gently tried to explain that Eric's love life was none of Sheila's business. She argued that it was her business. She had been married to Eric. She knew that there was something shady about Quinn. \"I am gonna find it and take her down,\" Sheila vowed. She added that her portrait would hang in Eric's living room one day. She threatened that if Charlie told anyone, he would be hanging as well.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn cannot believe it \u0096 Eric is giving her another chance. He says yes, they are where they all belong. She remarks this is more than she deserves and she will never let him down again. Pam calls the house and is surprised to find Eric answering the phone. He says he does not want to hear one negative word but he has come home to stay and Quinn is too. He tells Quinn from the very first day he met her she touched something in him that he did not know was there. She sighs that she can breathe again. He wants her to do him a favor and he starts playing the piano and she dances around. Then he tells her to stop right there and don't move. He moves into her arms and gives her a big hug. Katie laments to Wyatt that he can't just come in here at work and start kissing on her. He wants to know if she did not like it. She says she did not say that. He has lost his mind as anyone could walk in. He retorts that will give them something to talk about and he is not worried about that. By time they move to the couch, Katie tells Wyatt that she needs to slow this down. It is not that she does not want to but they are friends .friends with benefits or whatever he wants to call it. She says she likes to label things so she can deal with it. He laughs and says she needs to shut that brain off right now and just be. She says okay they will just have fun. Charlie tells Sheila she is delusional if she thinks her so-called portrait will ever hang on the Forrester wall. She rails that Stephanie had one, Quinn had one and she is going to have one too. Do not underestimate her. Charlie tells Sheila that she probably is underestimating Quinn. She cannot know that he is with her now. Pam calls and tells Charlie some interesting news; Eric is back with Quinn; she heard it from Eric himself. Charlie explains to Sheila that he knows she was expecting something but it is not going to be. Sheila tears up and can't believe Eric would do that. Wyatt tells Katie that the two of them are adults and they are free to do what they want. She says he does make her laugh but there are real issues they cannot dismiss. There is their age difference and then there is Quinn and Bill and her son Will. He asks if she is thinking of those things now or when he kisses her and she admits no, so he kisses her again. He says if he doesn't mean something it does not go past this lips. He finds her sexy. He thinks they make a good team too. They kiss again. Charlie tells Sheila that he knows she is disappointed but Quinn and Eric getting back together is really none of her business. Sheila says he was hers long before Quinn came into the picture and he will be again and that portrait will hang on Eric's wall. And if Charlie mentions it to anyone he is going to hang too. Quinn says she feels like she could burst with happiness; how blessed she is. From this day forward she wants to celebrate what they are to each other .to the woman she sees reflected in his eyes. She had to lose something to really appreciate him but now she does. She is now 100% committed to him. A flash of thunder and the Quinn portrait is transformed into a vile Sheila one.",
