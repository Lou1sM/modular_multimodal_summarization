Julius corrected that he hadn't called anyone a freak, \"but our daughter? What a joke.\" He claimed to be trying but couldn't accept what \"he's done to himself.\"\n\n\nMaya silently sobbed as she listened. Julius wished he could replace what Myron had been with what Myron had become, but Julius just wasn't ready. Maya skulked away from the staircase.\n\n\nNick decided to get started. Nicole headed to get Maya, who Nicole felt should have been ready. Vivienne wondered what was keeping Maya, and Julius quipped that Maya was probably primping.\n\n\nAfter a while of waiting for Maya, Nick figured he'd gathered everyone too soon. Eric said it was the bride's prerogative to take her time. Carter joked that the officiant had to entertain the guests. Nick told a terrible joke and cried out for Maya to hurry. Everyone laughed.\n\n\nAside with Julius, Vivienne laughed, too. She saw everyone having fun, and she wanted for her and Julius to have fun at the celebration. Julius guessed she wanted him to pretend the son he'd had so many dreams for hadn't become a blushing bride. He said he'd pretend, but it wasn't a celebration.\n\n\nVivienne reasoned that she and Julius couldn't have wanted a better life for any of their children, and Maya had the courage to be her true self. Vivienne asked him to find joy that Maya had become a success and would never have the monetary struggles they'd had. He replied that it would make him joyous if he made it through the ceremony.\n\n\nAside with Eric, Bridget complimented his beard. She asked why he and her uncle hadn't traveled to New York. Eric replied that if he had, he'd have to admit that Bridget lived there.\n\n\nBridget asked how her mother was. Eric said that Brooke was good. Bridget was surprised to hear that Deacon and Brooke were friendly. Eric replied that it wasn't \"that\" way, and Deacon was married. Bridget had heard about that from Hope, who hadn't had anything nice to say about Quinn.\n\n\nZende handed out Champagne. Brooke was surprised when he extended a glass to her, but she took it. When he wasn't looking, she set it down.\n\n\nKatie forced Bill to meet the Avants. Julius recognized Bill as the \"magazine guy\" who liked to make money off other people's misery. Bill said it was a poor choice of words if used to describe the life of Maya, who had blossomed into the poster child for people like her.\n\n\nBill said he published the truth, and it was up to individuals how they responded to the truth. Bill believed that Maya had flourished under the limelight he'd given her. Julius asked if Bill was suggesting that if someone didn't want to become fodder for tabloids, then one shouldn't do things to become the subject of gossip in the first place. Bill responded that he couldn't have put it better himself.\n\n\nAside with Julius later, Vivienne was livid that Julius had excused Bill Spencer for persecuting Maya. Julius said it wasn't his place to excuse or not, but he'd been embarrassed and hadn't wanted Myron putting Julius' business out there. She asked if Julius had ever considered what their daughter had gone through. He insisted that Bill had only printed the truth; the rest was Maya's own doing.\n\n\nEric approached and asked if it was time to send up reinforcements to help Nicole. Vivienne was sure they'd be down soon. Julius hoped so. He was ready to get \"this thing\" over with.\n\n\nIn her room, Maya sobbed to herself. Nicole entered. Maya uttered that she couldn't go down there \"right now.\" Nicole asked if Rick had done something. Maya said it had been their father, and no matter how much she'd waned to believe or have their parents in her life, she shouldn't have trusted it.\n\n\nNicole noted that they were at the wedding. Maya quipped that it was her freak show wedding that her father would force himself to sit through, even though he couldn't accept her and thought Rick would leave her for a real woman.\n\n\nNicole couldn't believe that their father had said those things to Maya on her wedding day. Maya replied that Julius hadn't said them to her. Maya explained that she'd heard their parents talking while she'd been at the top of the staircase. She'd been ready to let that man walk her down the aisle, but he'd called her a joke and a freak. Maya couldn't go downstairs and face him. Nicole asked what would happen to the wedding.\n\n\nMaya didn't want to call off the wedding, but she didn't know how to say her vows to Rick with an ache in her stomach. She'd only wanted to feel love that day, and \"this\" wasn't how she wanted to remember her wedding day. Nicole wondered if Maya had misunderstood Julius. Maya shook her head. Nicole asked if their mother had agreed, and Maya thanked God that Vivienne hadn't.\n\n\nMaya hoped that it wouldn't change because she needed their mother to stand by her. Nicole was sure it wouldn't change. She said they'd already known that their father was a closed-minded jerk. Maya whined that Julius had said he was trying. \"He lied, Maya!\" Nicole exclaimed. Nicole said he had to deal with it, but it didn't have to affect the wedding day.\n\n\nMaya whimpered that Julius was her father. Nicole said to forget him, and he didn't matter that day. Only Rick and Maya mattered that day, and Julius' feelings wouldn't touch the couple's love or marriage. Nicole stated that the others were there to celebrate and be happy, and it was Maya's moment, not their father's moment. Nicole told Maya to own her day and not to let Julius take it away.\n\n\nMaya decided she was stronger than Julius' embarrassment and hate. Maya said she could pretend she hadn't heard him and that he was nowhere near her. The sisters hugged, and Maya thanked Nicole. Maya needed a moment, but she asked Nicole to tell everyone that Maya was on the way.\n\n\nNicole left, and Maya stared at herself in the mirror.\n\n\nDownstairs, Rick wanted to check on Maya, but Nicole entered, saying Maya had just needed a moment. Nicole announced that it was a go, and Nick sent everyone to their places.\n\n\nMaya returned to the top of the stairs, and Vivienne grinned and cued the music. Maya descended the stairs. She stopped at the bottom, and Julius held out his arm for her. Maya stared at him for long time. Vivienne held out Maya's flowers. Maya took them and grasped Vivienne's hand before allowing both of her parents to walk her down the aisle.\n\n\nAt the altar, Rick softly asked if Maya was all right. \"I am now,\" she replied as her parents took their seats. Nick thanked everyone for gathering in full support of the couple. Nick said it hadn't been that far back that the thought of her family being at her wedding had seemed impossible. Nick was honored to witness it and asked who gave the couple away to each other for marriage.\n\n\nThe Avants and Forresters said that they did. Nick began to talk about the families merging together, and Maya stopped the ceremony. She said that she wouldn't be able to look back upon the day and remember Nick's words, knowing that they weren't true.\n\n\nMaya felt that she and Rick deserved to be surrounded by supporters. There was one person she needed to talk to, and she couldn't go forward until she did. \"Dad?\" she said, and Julius looked up.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Maya cries as she looks down from the banister and hears what her father is saying to her mother on her wedding day. He thinks Maya is a joke and a freak show. She is asking him to put aside his feelings for one day and celebrate. He just can not accept that he will be walking the boy he raised to walk down the aisle and marry another man. He can not accept Maya as the blushing bride. Maya goes back to her room and closes the door, her father's words resounding in her head. The wedding guests get nervous but Nicole assures them all is okay and she will go check on Maya. Vivienne continues to try and get Julius to settle down and accept Maya today. She has got a good life and will never have to worry about money problems they had to face all those years. He should find joy in that. He sits down and just wants to get this started and end. That will be his joy. Zende hands Brooke a drink and she seems stunned for a second, then sits it down without touching. Katie pushes Bill to introduce himself to the Avants where Julius assures Bill right away that he knows the magazine man, the one who likes to make his money on other people's misery. Bill corrects and says he publishes the truth and with that Maya has flourished. Nicole goes upstairs and notices right away that Maya is crying and asks what is wrong. She is afraid it is something Rick said to upset her. Maya says no, it is their father. She knew she could not trust him but she wanted to believe he was accepting her. Now she can not go down there and face all of them. She is not calling off the wedding but she can not face Rick with this ache in her stomach. She can not remember her wedding day like this. Nicole does her best pep talk and says they both know that Julius is a close-minded jerk but that can not bother Maya. Everyone else is waiting for her to marry and be happy. She needs to go down and keep her head held high and own her own day. Maya agrees. She will pretend she just did not hear what her father said. She looks in the mirror and gives a big sigh and says she will be down in a minute. The music starts and she walks down the stairs. Julius greets her with his hand. But she takes her mother's on the left and then the flowers with her right and then does hook it over her dad's arm. Nick starts the ceremony. All seems to be going well until he asks who gives this woman away. When Julius says he does, Maya stops the wedding and says she can not continue. She tells Rick that she can not look back on this wedding day and know the words being said are not true. They really need to be surrounded by friends and family that support them. There is one here she needs to speak with first. She turns around and looks at Julius and he asks what does she want.",
