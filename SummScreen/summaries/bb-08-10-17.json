    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Liam was devastated to hear that Caroline was dying. Sally had thought Liam had already known, and she explained that Thomas was in New York to spend as much time with Caroline and Douglas as possible before Caroline died.\n\n\nLiam was surprised to be just learning of it. Sally said Caroline hadn't wanted anyone to know, and Thomas had only told Sally so she'd understand why he'd gone to New York. Sally hadn't meant to blurt it out, but she'd assumed Liam had known because he was Caroline's family. Sally expressed sorrow for the tearful Liam and for his family.\n\n\nIn CEO's office at Forrester, Brooke and Katie discussed Quinn and Eric's reconciliation. Katie didn't have an opinion on it except that it was better than seeing Eric with Sheila. Brooke asked if Wyatt was happy about it. Katie supposed that he was. Brooke asked if Wyatt hadn't shared his opinion with Katie about it while they'd been working so closely together.\n\n\nBrooke noted that Katie and Wyatt had done a great job at the challenge. It had been cute to Brooke to see Wyatt so pumped, and she noted she hadn't seen him that way since the divorce from Steffy. Brooke said it hadn't been a great year for either Katie or Wyatt.\n\n\n\"Nope. Pretty sad and lonely,\" Katie quipped. Brooke hadn't meant it that way. She just felt that Katie deserved to be happy, and so did Wyatt.\n\n\nLater, Katie and Brooke were working, and Brooke asked if she should send an email to Wyatt. Katie replied that she'd discuss whatever the contents of the email were with Wyatt. Brooke asked if the two hadn't wrapped things up yet, and Katie said they hadn't quite yet. Brooke repeated that Wyatt and Katie had made an incredible team.\n\n\nKatie asked if Brooke really thought so. Brooke acknowledged that Katie and Wyatt were different. Katie felt that looking for happiness in the wrong places was something she and Wyatt had in common. Brooke felt that, with the way the world was, anywhere that one found happiness couldn't be wrong, and one needed to run with it when they found it. Katie said she'd been thinking of doing just that.\n\n\nIn the design office, Wyatt arrived. Steffy had heard him humming down the hallway. She noted how giddy he was and said it couldn't be because of the Eric and Quinn news. Steffy asked if Wyatt had a new woman in his life. Wyatt stated that his ex-wife was asking about his love life.\n\n\nSteffy backed off the questions, and Wyatt said he had a question. He asked if Thomas was getting together with Caroline. Steffy replied that Thomas was visiting his son, as he should be. Wyatt remarked that Spectra was just getting off the ground, and he wondered what it meant for Sally, who Thomas had been getting hot and heavy with.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was alone when Liam arrived. Liam had messaged Wyatt and located him just to touch base. Liam mumbled that he felt out of touch. Wyatt warned that they'd have to do another guys' night if Liam told Bill such a thing.\n\n\nLiam asked if Wyatt had talked to Thomas about staying in New York. Wyatt hadn't and asked why Liam was inquiring. Liam was vague in relaying that he'd spoken to Sally and learned that Thomas would be gone indefinitely. From Wyatt's reactions, Liam gleaned that Wyatt didn't know anything, and he asked if Wyatt had talked to Caroline. Wyatt asked why and if he should talk to Caroline.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was saying that if Thomas wanted to unite his family, then it was good for Caroline. Wyatt added that it wasn't great for Spectra. Liam was thinking about that point and wondered how Thomas would make such a quick change so shortly after Caroline's visit. Wyatt replied that he wasn't the one to ask, and their father had seen Caroline more than Wyatt had on her last trip to town. \"Dad,\" Liam said and began thinking.\n\n\nKatie arrived. She was sorry to interrupt, but she needed Wyatt. Liam decided that he had to take off to see someone.\n\n\nWyatt turned off his phone alerts and offered to lock the door. Katie didn't think it was necessary. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Wyatt replied. She asked what was going on with Liam, and she and Wyatt agreed that Liam hadn't been himself.\n\n\nWyatt conveyed that Steffy had noticed Wyatt's demeanor and had asked if there was a woman in his life. Katie relayed that she and Brooke had had the same kind of talk. Wyatt asked what Katie had told her sister, and Katie asked what he'd told Steffy. He said he hadn't revealed that he couldn't stop thinking of the woman working across the hall. Katie stated that she hadn't revealed anything, either, but Brooke was happy that Katie was happy.\n\n\nNearing Katie, Wyatt uttered that he didn't mind keeping it a secret. Katie whispered that it was their little secret, and the two kissed. Katie asked what he was doing, and he replied that he was kissing her. She asked why, and he replied it was because she liked it.  He pointed out that they were attracted to each other, and he thought she was amazing.\n\n\nKatie reasoned that the city was full of amazing women. Wyatt reasoned that they were out there, but he was \"in here\" with her. He wanted her to shut her brain off and be in the moment with him. Wyatt threatened to kiss her again then made good on it.\n\n\nBack at Spectra, Steffy arrived. She noticed that it was quiet around there and asked if Sally shouldn't be capitalizing on the momentum from the summit. Sally said they were just taking time to bask in their success. Steffy stated that Spectra had surprised people and put on a decent show; however, Steffy thought it might be their last one.\n\n\nSally guessed Steffy wasn't there to offer congratulations. Steffy said she was, but she didn't want Sally deluding herself about Thomas, who could be in New York for a very long time. In Steffy's view, Thomas had gotten caught up in the romance of saving Sally, but he hadn't gone to New York just for his son. He'd also gone for Caroline, the mother of his child.\n\n\nSally knew that, and she said she probably understood it better than Steffy. Steffy doubted it. Sally knew how Steffy felt about the situation and that Steffy had invited Caroline to visit. Steffy asked if it bothered Sally. It didn't because Sally knew that Thomas was where he needed to be.\n\n\nSteffy was surprised that Sally was okay with it. Sally wished it was different due to the upcoming showing -- and a lot of other reasons -- but she understood why Thomas needed to be there for Caroline and their son.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill and Justin discussed Bill \"motivating Thomas to do the right thing.\" Bill said Thomas would stay in New York, Caroline's family would unite, and \"Sky\" would become a reality. Justin asked if Bill really thought Thomas would be there for Caroline.\n\n\nBill reasoned that Thomas was a do-gooder, and that was why he'd rescued Sally. In Bill's view, Thomas wouldn't turn his back on the mother of his child, and Spectra didn't exist without Thomas. Justin concluded that it all rested on Bill's lie. Bill said that only Thomas and Caroline knew about it, and Bill didn't want it getting out to anyone else.\n\n\nJustin couldn't believe Caroline was going along with it. Bill didn't think Caroline would put up with it for long; however, before they knew it, there would be a miraculous recovery, and Thomas and Caroline would live happily ever after. Justin asked about Sally.\n\n\nWith a careless shrug, Bill asked what about her. Bill asserted that Sally had stolen from the Forresters, lured Thomas from his family, and was a blight on the industry. Bill refused to let someone like that stand in the way of his legacy or greatest professional achievements.\n\n\nLater, Liam arrived as Bill was talking to \"Sky.\" Liam noted that Bill hadn't given up on that thing. Bill replied that she would be built right where he wanted her. Citing that his son had barged in without knocking, Bill guessed something was wrong. Liam told Bill to tell Liam what was wrong.\n\n\nLiam seemed to be testing a theory as he spoke to Bill. Liam said Bill knew Thomas was in New York with Caroline. Bill said that it was about time Thomas stepped up for his family, and Thomas didn't have time and money to waste on Sally and bad investments. Liam pointed out that with Thomas gone, it was \"a matter of time before Spectra's gone, too...Right?\"\n\n\nBill said Spectra should already be gone, and Thomas should be in New York, where he belonged. Liam commended Thomas being there for his son. Bill noted that Liam had arrived, acting as if he had an axe to grind, but they were actually agreeing. He asked what Liam's problem was. Liam said he'd heard something shocking that day, and it concerned the whole family.\n\n\nLiam conveyed that he almost hadn't believed it because of the source. He said he'd been interviewing Sally, who'd said something to him about Caroline. He said she'd only said it because she'd assumed that Caroline's family had already known. \"Sally said that Caroline is dying,\" Liam revealed.\n\n\nBill hung his head and slowly sank into his chair. \"Oh, so you knew,\" Liam gleaned. Bill replied that Sally shouldn't have said anything. Liam asked why Bill hadn't said anything to Liam or to Wyatt. \"You didn't tell him?\" Bill asked. Liam replied that he hadn't because Sally had said it was a secret.\n\n\nBill stated that it would stay that way. Caroline wanted it to stay confidential and had approached Bill for help. Liam asked what the illness was. Bill dubbed it a rare autoimmune disease that the doctors were treating her for in New York. Liam asked if they were Bill's doctors. Bill said he was giving Caroline all the support he could.\n\n\nLiam assumed supporting Caroline meant talking to Thomas about his responsibilities. Bill admitted to talking to Thomas about where Thomas' place was. \"And that leaves Spectra without a lead designer,\" Liam mused. Liam told his father that he'd overheard Sally talking to Thomas, who'd said he might be gone for months, leaving Sally to run the company herself. Bill replied that Thomas' focus needed to be on his family.\n\n\n\"And yet, here you are, talking to your skyscraper,\" Liam added. Liam found it uncanny that all of it worked to Bill's advantage. Caroline would get her family, and Spectra was vulnerable. Bill said that Liam was forgetting one thing.  Liam said he hadn't. \"All this cool stuff is happening because your niece is dying! Mm...Is she, Dad? Is Caroline dying?\" Liam asked.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Liam reels after Sally confirms that Thomas is in New York to spend as much time as he can with Caroline before she dies. Sally is apologetic; she assumed he knew because he is family. Usually onboard with Bill's schemes, Justin finds the latest one regarding Caroline too much. Steffy questions her ex-husband Wyatt about his good mood. He then hints that there may be a new woman in his life. Unaware that Katie has her eye on a potential suitor, Brooke gives her sister love advice about embracing happiness if it comes her way.

Liam confronts his father as he is having doubts whether the news of Caroline's impending passing is actually true.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam says he just saw Caroline and she is just fine so he cannot believe she is dying. Sally says she thought since he was family that he knew. Bill tells Justin that he didn't have a choice. Thomas would not step up and stay with his son so he stepped up the game to re-unite him and Caroline. He will stay in New York and Sally will be forced to close Spectra without him. Thomas is a do-gooder and he will not turn his back now on his son. Steffy mentions Quinn to Wyatt and asks if that is what is putting a smile on his face or does he have a new woman. Brooke questions Katie about Quinn or if she has discussed it with Wyatt as they seem to be a new team. She says she wants her to be happy as they both deserve it. Katie says yes they both seemed to have been looking for love in all the wrong places in the past. Justin laments to Bill that he can not believe that Caroline is going along with this lie. Bill says Sally stole Thomas away from Caroline not to mention getting Thomas away from Forrester and he will not let her get away with his legacy. Liam drops in on Wyatt and says he has been out of touch, but he wonders if he has spoken with Thomas since being in New York. Something seems wrong there and he may want to stay. He thinks if Thomas and Caroline want to get back together that is great. Wyatt says Bill will be tickled by this news. Steffy drops in on Sally and then ends up talking about Thomas being in New York and staying there for Caroline. Katie and Wyatt discuss the fact that both Steffy and Brooke say they see the look on their faces and neither denied it. Liam walks in on Bill as he is kissing his skyscraper again. Liam quips that he thought Bill had given up on that with Spectra still in business. Wyatt and Katie continue to kiss until she pulls free and says they should not be doing this. He tells her it is time for her to shut that brain off and just have some fun. He announces he is going to kiss her again. She does not pull away. Liam questions Bill about Caroline and why Thomas is in New York to be with her and not working for Spectra. Bill says Thomas is where he belongs and Spectra should have been gone a long time ago. Liam says he heard something pretty shocking today that concerns him. Sally told him something that she assumed he knew. Caroline is dying so why didn't Bill tell him if he told Wyatt. Bill says Caroline came to him about her health but she wants it confidential. She is being cared for by the best doctors in New York. Thomas was told and wants to be there for his family. Liam says this is weird, all working out to Bill's advantage. All Bill has to do is swoop in and take it. He wonders if Caroline is really dying.",
