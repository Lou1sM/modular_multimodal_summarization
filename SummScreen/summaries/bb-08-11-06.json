    "imdb": "\nFelicia finds Dino missing, possibly stolen by the electrician. Dante sensibly tries to use the GPS on the PDA she left in the diaper bag, so they can give chase -while alerting the police- to the airport. Thorne suggests Hector is bothering Taylor. Hector answers that he respects her, which Ridge and Stefanie failed to. He gets nowhere arguing Darla's death was an accident, yet Taylor won't keep silent. Dante finds Dino, safely on Eric's jet, but vows to keep son and mother in his sight.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Thorne stands his ground when Hector asks him to leave his house now. He manages to get Taylor to leave. Hector remarks he knows he wants answers, but he does not have any. He says it was an accident but Darla fell into the path of a car. Thorne offers that he's only making excuses for the monster that killed his wife. He's going to find the son of a bitch who did this and on Darla's grave make him pay! Hector calls Taylor and warns her that Thorne is heading to her house. He gives it one last ditch effort to get her not to reveal her complicity in the case. They would lose it all. Felicia and Dante panic when they realize Dino is missing but they vow to track him down with a Global Positioning System by the PDA and a laptop. They head to the Van Nuys Airport. Dino is riding in a car driven by a man, seeming okay. They find him aboard a plane and then Eric shows up and reminds Felicia that he was taking Dino for the day and he did leave a note. He takes the boy for ice cream and Dante confesses his love for Felicia and he won't let her or Dino out of his sight again. Taylor tells Thorne she doesn't deserve his comfort, but he disagrees. She has been there for him and Alexandria for weeks now. He knows Hector wants him to call off this manhunt, but he vows he never will until he finds this evil person. Breaking down, Taylor tells a shocked Thorne that she knows who it is. She knows who killed Darla. She is the person he is looking for. She killed Darla.",
