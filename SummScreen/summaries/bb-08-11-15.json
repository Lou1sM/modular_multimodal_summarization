    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya interrupted her wedding to Rick to confront her father. Julius wondered aloud if Maya had a case of cold feet. He and Vivienne wondered if she was sick. Maya answered that she was not sick. Julius told her that he was worried. \"I wouldn't know,\" Maya said, insisting that Julius had never worried about her before.\n\n\nMaya addressed the crowd and shared that she had waited her entire life for that wedding. She added that she had looked forward to her parents' approval, \"but nothing's changed,\" she said. She glared at her parents.\n\n\nMaya confronted Julius and said she knew that he did not approve of her and had faked his approval. Julius wondered if he was being asked to leave. Maya wondered why Julius had attended. Julius claimed he was there to give away the bride. \"You can't give away something you've already thrown away,\" Maya seethed.\n\n\nJulius tried to defend himself. He said that some things could not be changed. \"A dog can't be a cat, and a boy can't be a girl,\" Julius said. Brooke and Eric tried to interrupt on separate occasions to give Maya and Julius time alone, but Maya refused. She said Julius had never loved her and never cared about her.\n\n\nJulius insisted that he could not give up his beliefs. He said that he had prayed for her and sacrificed for her. He did not understand her, and he had given her distance as a child because it had been the best he'd been able to do.\n\n\nJulius tearfully explained that he'd had a son and named him Myron after Julius' father. Julius continued to explain that his father had taught himself to read, hopped a train, slept in parks and alleys, and worked as a painter and roofer to earn enough money to get his own room. He had worked hard in the building trade -- hard enough to start his own business. \"That's who I named you after,\" Julius said.\n\n\n\"I think you overstayed your welcome,\" Rick said, but Julius wanted to be heard. He told the crowd that his father had disowned him before he'd died because his namesake had disrespected the whole family. Maya turned away. Julius turned to leave. \"Vivienne?\" he asked. He expected that his wife would accompany him, but she refused.\n\n\n \"I'm staying,\" Vivienne exclaimed. \"Be careful, Vivienne. Remember who you are,\" Julius warned. Vivienne reminded Julius that she had obeyed and loved him for 35 years, but she was going to see her daughter get married.\n\n\nJulius countered that it was a freak show. \"Can't you see how unnatural this is?\" he asked. Vivienne said the only unnatural thing she had done had been to \"turn my own child away from my door,\" she said. Vivienne apologized to Maya.\n\n\nJulius turned to Maya. \"Are you happy now?\" Julius asked. He said that she had broken up his family. Maya angrily turned to Julius. \"All I wanted was your acceptance and approval, but I don't care. I don't want you here. So go. Let me be,\" Maya said calmly. Julius turned and left.\n\n\nRick whispered to Maya, \"Tell me what you need.\" Maya responded that she had all she needed. Vivienne hugged Maya and admitted that she had spent half of her life being wrong. \"I'm so proud to be your mother. I didn't do a good job, but I'm still so proud,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy tearfully recalled her encounter with Aly. Thomas entered and told Steffy she looked awful. Steffy lamented that their cousin was dead. \"I may have killed her,\" Steffy said. \"Don't say that,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nThomas maintained it was survivor's guilt, but Steffy said it wasn't. They agreed it had been an accident, and Thomas pointed out it could have been Steffy who had been killed. Steffy agreed that Aly had planned to kill her. Steffy lamented that she hadn't just run, but she also felt she had reasoned with Aly at one point.\n\n\nSteffy recalled that Aly had admitted she'd felt lost and empty. But Steffy remembered that they had struggled. Thomas said Aly had fallen and hit her head. \"No. I hit her. I picked up the tire iron and hit her,\" Steffy cried.\n\n\nThomas argued that her mind had played tricks on her. Steffy flashed back to the events and remembered that Aly had tried to hit her with her car then had attacked her again outside the car with the tire iron. Steffy had knocked it aside, and she remembered Aly had been standing over her. \"I grabbed the tire iron, and I ... Oh, my God,\" Steffy said as she broke down.\n\n\nThomas insisted it had been self-defense, and Aly had been out of her mind. \"She threatened your life. It was still an accident,\" Thomas maintained. He reiterated that it was a tragic accident, but telling anyone else would only complicate things, and it would never get Aly back.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas sees Steffy's face and wants to know what is wrong. She tells him to close the door. Their cousin is dead. He says do not keep saying it is her fault. She says it is not a matter of fault. She does not know what she could have done to change facts. She says she was calm but firm. Aly intended to kill her, she even told her because she was selfish and a slut and took her dad's job. But she did not run, she stayed. She thought at one point she got through to her. Steffy said it did not happen quite like she said previously. Aly did not just fall. Steffy had picked up the tire iron and hit her. Eric asks the wedding guests to adjoin outside and give the Avants a chance to talk. Maya says no, she wants everyone to hear. She asks her father to say again how he feels about her. He says whatever problems they have is in the past. He will not be publically called out and humiliated like this. She tells him no it is not in the past. And he can not give something away today that he has already thrown away. Maya tells him she overheard him at the bottom of the stairs. They stand and rant back and forth of how Maya was raised. He does claim that he loved her but kept his distance as he did not know how to raise a boy as a girl. He says he has tried but there are certain things he can not accept. She wonders why he is here at all. He came to get Nicole and that did not work, but he is sticking around. Thomas tells Steffy that her mind is playing tricks on her. She says no, she was in shock earlier but now she remembers. She thought everything was okay but out of nowhere Aly got the tire iron and swung at her. It fell and so did Steffy but she did get hold of the tire iron and swung at Aly. Thomas says then it was self defense. She does not have to tell anyone. Aly threatened her life, that simple. He has lost one sister already and he will not lose another. Talking now will not bring Aly back. Julius stands tall and tells them the story of his father's life, Myron, as a 15 year old in Chicago that had to work day jobs to keep a roof over his head. And he worked hard until he saved enough money to make his own business. Vivienne cringes when Julius says his father also gave him a severance check and told him his Myron was a disgrace to the whole family. Julius has tears by now and listens as Vivienne says she is staying for her daughter's wedding; Julius can just go. He tries to convince her how unnatural this is. She asys no, the most unnatural thing in her life was when she had to turn her face away from her own child. And she went along with that and she wishes a thousand times that she could undo that and she hopes the Lord will forgive her for being so weak then. He hopes she is happy now, breaking up the little bit of family that she had. Maya tells him that she is proud of who she is and she does not want him here any more than he wants to be here, so just go and let her be. He walks out. Rick asks what she needs. She says she thinks she has it all now. Vivienne asks for her forgiveness. She knows she was wrong and she wants to say now how sorry she is. She wasted her life being weak but she looks at Maya now and realizes how beautiful she is. She tells her she is so proud to be her mother. They hug.",
