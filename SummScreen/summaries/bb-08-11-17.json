    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Forrester design office, Katie wondered if Wyatt should be working. Wyatt claimed to enjoy their friends-with-benefits situation, and he couldn't wait for it to get more beneficial. Katie was the type who enjoyed the anticipation, but Wyatt said patience wasn't one of his virtues.\n\n\nQuinn arrived and asked what she was hearing about patience. Wyatt welcomed her and congratulated her on getting Eric back. Wyatt had stopped by the mansion earlier, but Quinn had still been asleep. He joked about not hearing from his mother for two whole days.\n\n\nKatie congratulated Quinn on the reunion, and Quinn repeated her question about patience. Wyatt replied that he'd been telling Katie that one had to go after what one wanted, and patience was overrated. Quinn completely agreed, and Katie and Wyatt smirked at each other.\n\n\nQuinn was reading something to herself, and Katie and Wyatt were discussing photos. Quinn guessed Wyatt was there to help Katie pick layouts for the fall campaign. Wyatt said he wasn't. He was merely there to be an annoyance, and Katie had to put up with it because she'd taken his old job. Katie replied that she didn't have to.\n\n\nQuinn noticed that Wyatt was awfully chipper. \"As in woodchip chipper?\" Wyatt asked. He said he hadn't chewed up anything since he'd gotten there. \"Just four of my promotional photos and my lunch hour,\" Katie said. Quinn chuckled and packed up to go. Quinn suggested that Wyatt stop pestering Katie, who had a lot of work to do while he was just killing time.\n\n\nQuinn suspected that Wyatt was killing time for a reason. Katie said she was suspicious about it, too. Quinn deduced that he had an impending date with someone in the building. Katie said it was probably an intern. Quinn figured it had to be it because he was never that cheerful.\n\n\nQuinn said she'd just stopped in to pick up interoffice messages and supplies, and she'd be working from home the rest of the day. Wyatt was surprised Quinn didn't want to grill him about her suspicions. As Quinn exited, she said she had to be off her game.\n\n\n\"'Probably one of the interns?'\" Wyatt repeated after his mother had gone. Katie replied that he could be having lunch with Charlotte. Wyatt said he'd thought Quinn had almost figured it out. Katie replied that it wouldn't be good. \"No, that would be hilarious,\" Wyatt concluded.\n\n\nReminding Wyatt that his mother didn't like her, Katie asked what Quinn would think if she knew Katie and Wyatt were having an illicit flirtation. Wyatt salaciously repeated \"illicit flirtation.\" She asked if he'd ever tell Quinn. Wyatt said he wouldn't, and Katie kissed him.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam pressed Bill about being the orchestrator of Caroline's supposed illness. Bill didn't appreciate what bank-teller-tie-wearing Liam was accusing him of. Liam was suspicious of the autoimmune disease, which he said wasn't a real diagnosis. When Bill said it was what the man had diagnosed Caroline with, Liam asked Bill to get the male doctor on the phone.\n\n\nBill didn't make a move for the phone. Liam asked if Caroline was really dying. Bill said he'd never take advantage of something so tragic. Liam asked again if Caroline was dying, and Bill replied that she wasn't. Liam asked if Bill had put Caroline up to telling Thomas such a thing. Bill responded that he'd told Thomas himself.\n\n\nBill believed that, at times, a little white lie made things work out for everyone. Liam asked how it worked out for anyone but Bill. Bill said Thomas had responsibilities to his son, and Liam said Thomas had every intention to live up to them. \"Now, because of me,\" Bill added. Bill asked if Liam thought it was healthy for Douglas to grow up in a house full of women.\n\n\nNoting that Bill had three sons, Liam asked how many of their mothers Bill was living with. Bill roared that no one was unhappy but Liam. Bill advised \"Arthur\" to leave the sword in the stone and let it be. Liam started using his phone. Bill asked what Liam was doing. Liam said he'd give his father three guesses. Bill knocked the phone out of Liam's hand. \"What the -- ?\" Liam said.\n\n\nBill asked Liam \"what the hell\" he was doing. Liam had been calling Caroline to hear straight from her why she'd lost her mind and gone along with it. Bill said she wanted the father of her son to step up and act like a man. Liam figured that Caroline had had to go along with it so that the Forresters didn't publicly crucify Bill for the lie.\n\n\nLiam asserted that he wouldn't give up on it. Bill replied that it had nothing to do with Liam, but Liam said it was his brother-in-law's life that Bill was derailing. Liam asked what happened when Caroline didn't die. Bill replied that Thomas would be recommitted by then and nestled into the bosom of his family. \"Before you know it -- hallelujah, there's a miracle cure!\" Bill exclaimed.\n\n\nBill figured that life would go on. Liam stated that it wouldn't for Sally or Spectra, who'd have to take their crushed dreams and go so that Bill's monstrosity and testament to his dishonesty could rise. Bill said it would rise, crowned with the Spencer name, Liam's name, and that name would be seen for miles around. All the obstacles would be removed. Bill suggested that Liam not become an obstacle, or Bill would remove Liam, too.\n\n\nLiam asked if Bill would have Justin push Liam out of a helicopter. Bill ordered his son to stop the drama. Bill asserted that Thomas had made his own choice. Liam disagreed because the scenario hadn't even been real. Bill asked if Liam was saying that, if Spectra went under, it was because of Bill -- or if it was because of their own criminal incompetence.\n\n\nLiam asked if there was anything Bill wouldn't justify. \"Yes. Being called out by you!\" Bill retorted. Bill didn't understand the resentment and pointed out that he'd provided a pretty nice life for Liam. \"Is my money so impure? I mean, do you -- do you lie awake at night, worrying that I might have made it by means that will traumatize your ovo-lacto-vegetarian heart?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nLiam didn't believe that ridiculing him wouldn't make Bill right. \"Well, it works for you!\" Bill quipped. Liam told Bill that he had to stop interfering in people's lives. Bill countered that Liam had better stop interfering in Bill's life, or Bill was done. Liam didn't even know what that meant.\n\n\nBill warned that, overnight, Liam could become a poor relation Bill never had, and Liam's wife could support Liam. Liam replied that it wouldn't stop him from telling Steffy why Thomas had gone. \"Oh, so now you're threatening to go to mommy!\" Bill derided.\n\n\nBill told Liam to go ahead because Steffy wanted nothing more than to have that lying, thieving, red-headed trash out of her brother's life. \"Well, not like this,\" Liam contended. Bill roared that if Liam said one word to Sally or Thomas, then Liam was out. Bill asked if he was clear. \"No!\" Liam yelled. Pointing his finger, Bill clarified, \"Out of the company. Out of the family.\"\n\n\nLiam asked if Bill would take back his DNA. Bill argued that Liam didn't have enough of Bill's DNA. Liam scoffed. Bill apologized and said the statement hadn't been nice. Bill loved his son, and it was why he put up with Liam being \"how you can be.\" Bill said Liam was annoying and a bit of a nuisance, but never Bill's enemy. Bill asked Liam to trust that Liam didn't want to become the enemy. Bill hugged the disillusioned Liam.\n\n\nLater, Bill was still fuming when Caroline arrived. The first thing he asked was if her cousin had called her but then he realized that she'd still be in New York. Caroline said there was a crisis. She'd lied to Thomas that she'd taken a train to Washington, DC, for a foundation meeting.\n\n\nCaroline relayed that Thomas wanted to spend as much time with her and Douglas as possible before the end. She hadn't told Thomas the truth but was worried about her death, which wasn't happening. She no longer wanted to go through with the absurd lie. Bill asked what was so absurd, and he noted that science didn't have a cure for everyone.\n\n\n\"I am not dying!\" Caroline yelled. Bill told her that she was so dying, just at a slower pace than Thomas thought. In Bill's view, everyone was dying. Distraught, Caroline said she wouldn't go along with it, even if it meant losing Thomas.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Steffy was surprised by how well Sally was taking Thomas' sojourn in New York. Steffy noted that Spectra didn't have a long shelf life without Thomas, especially with an upcoming showing. Sally said that Steffy thought Sally was a no-talent hack, but Thomas didn't.\n\n\nSteffy did believe Sally was a hack, but Steffy said it took talent to be one. Steffy didn't know how Sally would run the place on her own and noted that Thomas wouldn't be back soon. Sally thought she was more aware of it than Steffy. Steffy didn't understand why Sally didn't close up shop and go back to design school. Steffy noted that Bill was breathing down Sally and C.J.'s necks. Sally said Bill might get tired of waiting, but Steffy said Bill never got tired.\n\n\nClaiming to have pull at the institute, Steffy offered to write Sally a letter of recommendation. Sally was sarcastically awed that Steffy would say nice things about Sally in a letter if Sally declared bankruptcy. Steffy claimed that the offer was genuine, and she didn't want Sally going back to the old Spectra ways.\n\n\nSally asked if Steffy was there to see Sally collapse into tears over Thomas or to dance on Spectra's grave in advance. Steffy saw no pleasure in seeing Sally dumped. Sally stated that it wasn't what had happened. Steffy was there to ensure that, with Thomas gone, Sally would keep her promise about not being a knockoff shop again.\n\n\nSally intended on keeping it, but she said one didn't know the future. Steffy exclaimed that she'd known Sally would try to weasel out of it. Sally said she couldn't afford to rule anything out, but she happened to believe that the business could hold out until Thomas' return.\n\n\n\"What if he never comes back?\" Steffy asked. Sally believed that Thomas would, and he'd do it despite whatever efforts Steffy might make to stop it.\n\n\nIn Forrester's CEO office later, Steffy was working when Liam arrived. She said he looked about how she felt and asked what was wrong. He indicated that it was about Thomas being in New York. Steffy thought it was a good thing. Because of all the things Thomas was giving up, Liam questioned if it really was a good thing.\n\n\nSteffy stated that sacrifices had to be made. Liam said that the sacrifice didn't need to be made that time because it was just a guilt trip based upon a lie from Bill. Steffy didn't know what Bill and Thomas had to do with each other. Liam said Caroline was a Spencer, and that was all the reason Bill needed to completely hijack her future.\n\n\nLiam revealed that Bill had told Thomas that Caroline was dying from some made-up autoimmune disease, and that was the reason Thomas had left. Steffy's eyes bulged. She said Thomas would never believe that, and Caroline wouldn't go along with it. Liam contended that Bill was an accomplished liar, and Caroline was easy for Bill to bully.\n\n\nSteffy wanted to think about it a moment. She said that there was a time when all Thomas had wanted was to have Douglas and Caroline in Los Angeles. Liam disbelieved that Thomas' desires mattered because Bill wanted the plot of land Spectra had been built upon, and Bill could get it by getting rid of Spectra's lead designer.\n\n\nSteffy said Thomas shouldn't even be at Spectra. Liam told her that she knew what they had to do. Steffy wanted a chance to think it through. \"Really?\" Liam asked. He said that Steffy knew it was wrong, and Thomas deserved to know the truth.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Wyatt and Katie are flirtatious with each other when Quinn walks into the office and nearly discovers the romantic tension between them. Put on the spot by his son and the threat to call her doctor, Bill has to admit that he made up the story that Caroline is dying. Bill threatens a shocked Liam to cut him off completely if he divulges this information to anyone except his wife. Steffy continues to gloat at Sally who remains optimistic about her own talent to keep Spectra Fashion afloat and that Thomas will eventually return. Later, Liam is stunned when he informs Steffy that Thomas was duped and she is less than eager to break the news to Thomas. Over at Spencer Publications, Bill receives an unexcited visitor: Caroline.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells Liam that he does not like his implication. Liam says all he knows is that two things are happening \u0096 Caroline and Thomas getting back together and Spectra on the eve of folding and Bill getting back his monstrosity of a skyscraper. Again Bill does not like the words but finally has to admit that Caroline is not dying when Liam proposes to call and ask her about it. Quinn comes to the office and runs into Wyatt and Katie in one of their moments gloating about not having much patience. He was one of those who wanted to open his Christmas presents before Christmas. He is glad Quinn is back in the office since he has not heard from her in two days. They continue that patience is overrated. He thinks you have to go after something if you want it. Bill tells Liam that sometimes a little white lie can mend everything. Now Thomas has come around thanks to him and everyone is happy except Liam. So leave the sword in the stone and let it be. Quinn says Wyatt seems awfully chipper and she wonders why he is here. Perhaps he is just killing time but he might be pestering Katie and keeping her from work. Steffy tells Sally that Thomas is not coming back any time soon so she does not know how Sally is going to keep her doors open. She is a hack but even that takes talent. Maybe she could even write her a letter of recommendation and she can even go back to designing school and not go back to her old Spectra ways. Bill knocks the phone out of Liam's hands and tells him to behave himself and do not call Caroline. This will all work out and there will even be a miracle cure by time Thomas is recommitted to Caroline. Katie tells Wyatt that he could be having lunch with one of the interns; Charlotte is a lovely girl. Steffy tells Sally that she came here to make sure she is going to keep her promise to Thomas, not to knock off any more designs. Sally says Steffy wants to know if she is going down to the ship, but they will hold on until Thomas can come back as he promised. Liam asks his dad if he is going to have him thrown out of a helicopter. Bill says cut the drama. By all standards he has done right by Liam and now he is worried by the means that he got all that money and it is offending Liam. Liam says he needs to stop meddling. Bill says he is the one who is meddling. Caroline wants nothing more than having that red-headed heathen out of Thomas's life. Bill points his finger at Liam and says he does not have enough of his DNA but if he persists in this he will be out of the company and out of his life. He loves him but Liam will not want to become Bill's enemy now. Before she kisses him again, Katie tells Wyatt that he knows his mother does not like her so he surely is not going to tell her about their closeness now. Without warning Caroline arrives in Bill's office and says there is a crisis. Now Thomas wants to spend all the time he can with her and Douglas. Bill tells her that is great but she fights it that she won't do this. What will they do when it is her time to die? He grunts that everybody is going to die but they can slow hers down. Liam comes back and talks to Steffy. He confesses that Thomas left for New York to be with Caroline because he was told she was dying. It is not about what Thomas wants but what Bill wants and he wants that downtown lot that Spectra has. Steffy laments that she needs time to think this through. He says really \u0096 she knows Thomas deserves to know the truth now.",
