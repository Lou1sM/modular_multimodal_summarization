Liam tried to find Hope, but he could not find her.\n\n\nIn a caf\u00e9 near the Eiffel Tower, Quinn watched Liam through a pair of stolen binoculars and laughed at Liam's misfortune. Quinn smiled and mocked that Liam had been such a gentleman and saved Ivy -- Quinn smirked that she had won again.\n\n\nLiam called Hope repeatedly, but there was no answer. Liam and Ivy went to Forrester International, and Liam told Rick that he had received no word from Hope. Rick agreed that he had also heard nothing. Liam and Ivy acquired dry clothes, but they still heard nothing from Hope.\n\n\nLiam called Brooke for help, but Brooke admitted that she had heard nothing from Hope. Liam said that he had arrived late at the Eiffel Tower because he had saved Ivy, who had been pushed into the Seine. Brooke promised to convey Liam's message if she heard from Hope.\n\n\nLiam, Rick, and Ivy all realized that Hope was with Wyatt, and Rick advised that Wyatt had probably taken Hope somewhere. Rick and Liam discussed how disappointed Liam was that Hope would have left. Ivy noted that Liam had shown his goodness and chivalry. She promised to make it all right with Hope. She said that Paris was a city for lovers.\n\n\nOn board a private jet, Hope looked forlorn. Wyatt asked Hope if she was all right. \"Liam just doesn't come through for you,\" Wyatt said. He grabbed her hand. Wyatt and Hope headed to Monte Carlo. Quinn called Wyatt and told him to take control of the situation and marry Hope. Wyatt scoffed, but he hung up with his mother and pitched the idea that Liam had repeatedly let Hope down.\n\n\nWyatt reminded Hope that he had never let her down like Liam had. Wyatt told Hope that they would land soon. He reminded her that nothing had changed. Liam had repeatedly disappointed her, and Wyatt had always been true to her. Wyatt noted that his brother was a good person \"but an idiot\" for the way that Liam had treated Hope.\n\n\nWyatt told Hope that she deserved more. Hope said that it was not easy letting go. She admitted that she was tired of getting her hopes up. Wyatt kissed her hand and asked her to return to him. Wyatt told Hope that the diamond had been meant for her and that they had been meant to be together.\n\n\nWyatt wanted Hope to keep the diamond, and to marry him. Hope looked shocked. Wyatt promised to make things right. He asked her if the situation had reminded her of anything. Hope answered, \"Rock and roll.\"\n\n\nAt Forrester, Bill entered Brooke's office, and he teased that he knew she had wanted to call him. Brooke wondered why, and she mocked Bill's arrogance. Bill promised that he would never dump anyone into a large body of water ever again.\n\n\nBrooke giggled and promised to hold Bill to his vow. Brooke and Bill discussed that Liam had had to rescue Ivy, who had fallen into the Seine. Brooke noted that it might have cost him Hope.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke becomes increasingly worried about her daughter\u2019s well-being when Rick informs her that Hope hasn\u2019t been heard from since the press conference and photo shoot. Quinn makes an important phone call to make sure that the other part of her plan is being carried out properly. Bill makes an additional heartfelt attempt for Brooke to forgive him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam runs up and down the streets by the Seine mumbling and a bumbling, calling out for Hope. Quinn watches with her borrowed binoculars and calls him a drip. Such a dumb gentleman and his reward \u0096 he loses again. She chuckles, damn she's good. Ivy finally catches up to Liam and realizes he never found Hope. She did not wait for him. Liam's phone is dead so they decide Hope might have gone back to FI and go there. Brooke calls FI and Rick tells her that the photo shoot is the buzz and got great reviews. But he has not seen Hope nor Wyatt ..nor Liam either. Bill walks in and tells Brooke to go ahead and call him; he knows she wants to but she doesn't have to as he is standing right there. He wants to convince her to come back to him. She asks if he has spoken to either Liam or Wyatt. He guesses it must be because of Hope. So catch him up to speed. She says before she would have said Hope and Liam could have weathered the storm, but now there is Wyatt. Hope still has feelings for Liam but she's not so sure about him now. Sometimes you can not be pushed beyond the limits. And no matter what happens in Paris, someone is going to be the odd man out. Wyatt sits besides a gloomy Hope and asks if she is okay. She does not answer. He says she can not count on Liam. He never comes through for her. He takes her by the hand. Quinn calls so he leaves Hope for a minute. Quinn asks where he is and he replies on the Spencer jet on his way to Monte Carlo. She makes sure that Hope is still with him. He asks if there is something in particular that she wants. She says she wants him to have everything he wants. He's in such a good position now. Make it count and take control. Then she tells him to make the most of this moment .marry Hope as he might not ever get another chance like this. Wyatt asks if Hope has anything to say about this. She repeats again, just do it. She finishes up and hands the binoculars to the waiter. Wyatt goes back to Hope and says they will be landing soon. He hates to see her like this. She needs to put Liam aside. He treats her like there is a Hope around every corner, but with him there is not. She needs to be celebrated and loved, not like this. He says Liam is a good person but when it comes to Hope he is an idiot. She needs to just walk away. Do not put up with this disrespect and disappointment. She says it is not easy; he says he can help. They've done it before and now the transportation is better from the truck and trailer to the private jet to this private yacht. He kisses her hand. Liam and Ivy rush into FI to see Rick but he has no clue about Hope. Off the jet, Hope gives a little girl an autograph and a boat picks them up to take to the yacht. They marvel at the splendor. As they pull alongside, a crew is waiting for them. They are at their service for anything they want or need. Wyatt says only one phrase comes to mind ..Hope just needs to think hard. Yes she says Rock 'N' Roll baby. When Liam doesn't find Hope at FI, Rick says she is probably furious that he blew her off ..but just hang around because she has to return. Liam calls Brooke who says she has not heard from her. But not to worry. She probably just needed a little time to herself and she will turn up. Bill is still there so she puts him on speaker phone. Liam tells him that he can not find Hope. Bill says like mother like daughter after major disappointments. But they have gotten through obstacles before and so will this pass. Brooke tells him about Liam rescuing Ivy from the Seine but she just hopes it did not cost him Hope. Ivy tells Liam that she owes him, for his goodness, his chivalry. He did not have an option. She will explain to Hope and she will understand. Rick tells Liam that this is a place he probably doesn't want to go but Hope most likely is with Wyatt. Wyatt finds Hope on the bow and tells her to let Liam go, just let him go. Once and for all put him in the past. He says when the diamond came back into his life he immediately knew that it was meant to be hers. So he wants her to take it as his symbol of unwavering love and commitment to her. And he wants her to say right here, right now that she will marry him.",
