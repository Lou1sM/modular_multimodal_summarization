He promised that the diamond would continue to work its magic for them just as it had worked its magic for her line.\n\n\n\"Marry me,\" Wyatt said, \"The captain can do it right here on this ship. What do you say? Let's rock and roll.\" Hope smiled. Wyatt said that he offered her a partnership with no neuroses, no vacillation. He noted that she had to be tired of the constant disappointment and ups and downs that her relationship with Liam had offered.\n\n\nWyatt said that he knew it was crazy and impulsive, but he knew he and Hope were ready. \"I promise you, I will not disappoint you,\" Wyatt said. He wanted to start their life together. Hope looked pensive and said, \"Yes.\" \"Yes?\" Wyatt questioned. \"Yes,\" she answered, and they embraced.\n\n\nIn Paris, Liam and Ivy discussed that Hope had still not picked up any of Liam's calls. Liam called Forrester International again and checked in with Rick, but no one had heard from Hope. Ivy felt horrible that Liam had missed his chance with Hope. Ivy couldn't believe that Hope had left Liam.\n\n\nLiam lamented that Hope had been waiting, and he had seen her. Hope had said that she knew if he didn't show up, it was over. \"You were there,\" Ivy argued. Liam said that Hope hadn't realized that Liam had been there. Ivy felt responsible, but Liam said it had been an accident that she had fallen in the Seine. \"The most important thing is you're safe,\" Liam said.\n\n\nOn Bill's yacht, Captain Marks called Bill and told him that Wyatt had requested use of the yacht for a week in Monte Carlo. Bill said that he had known about Wyatt's request. Captain Marks added that Wyatt had planned to marry Miss Logan. Bill seemed surprised, but he thanked the captain for calling him.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Deacon entered Brooke's office and announced that Wyatt had texted him to tell him that Wyatt and Hope were moving on. Brooke didn't know what he meant, but Deacon explained that it sounded like Hope had left Liam. Bill called and interrupted Deacon and Brooke's conversation.\n\n\nBill told Brooke that his son and her daughter were getting married on Bill's yacht. Brooke excitedly assumed that Bill meant Liam and Hope, but Bill advised it was Hope and Wyatt who planned to wed. Brooke was disappointed. Bill said that it would be very difficult for Liam, but Liam was going to have to find someone else.\n\n\nBrooke hung up with Bill. Deacon said that he knew Hope would be happy. \"Wyatt is slick, but he loves her,\" Deacon said. Deacon added that he wanted to get back together with Brooke because he had been dreaming about her for a long time. Brooke was flattered but did not respond.\n\n\nOn the yacht in Monte Carlo, Captain Marks announced that Craig, the first mate, would serve as a witness to the marriage. Craig told Wyatt that he had purchased the dress Wyatt had requested. Hope appeared in a white lace dress, wearing the blue diamond necklace. She met Liam, and they joined hands in front of the captain and first mate.\n\n\nThe captain announced that it was beautiful day for a wedding with the splendor of Monte Carlo as a backdrop. It would be a wonderful memory for them. The captain asked if Wyatt had words for his bride. Wyatt answered, \"Wow.\"\n\n\nWyatt told Hope that he had never thought about marriage until he'd met Hope. He looked out at the horizon and promised that they would face their future side by side. \"We can do anything,\" Wyatt professed. He added that Hope drew out the very best in him, and he loved her smile.\n\n\nHope smiled, and she recalled that Wyatt had drawn out the impulsiveness in her since the first time she had met him. She added that she loved that he had pushed her to do things that challenged her. She noted that Wyatt liked to dive into life headfirst. Wyatt added that it was a leap of faith. Hope agreed.\n\n\nHope removed the diamond necklace and handed it to the captain. She raced to the edge of the boat and beckoned Liam to join her. \"Leap of faith?\" she asked. She extended her hand to him, and they jumped off the side of the boat.\n\n\nHope and Wyatt kissed and laughed in the water while the captain and first mate looked over the side. The captain pronounced them husband and wife and suggested that Wyatt could kiss his bride. Wyatt and Hope embraced in the water and kissed.\n\n\nIn Paris, Ivy and Liam agreed that since they couldn't find Hope and Wyatt with phone calls, they would go out and look for them. Liam's hotel room phone rang, and it was Bill. Liam said that he had to leave to find Hope. Bill reported that Hope and Wyatt were on his yacht in Monte Carlo and were getting married.\n\n\n\"I know you're disappointed,\" Bill said. Bill explained that someone was bound to get hurt. Liam was stunned. He said goodbye to his dad and emotionally told Ivy that Hope and Wyatt were getting married. Liam leaned against the doorway to the balcony, and he was in shock.\n\n\n",

Bill gets tipped off by a reliable informant about the elaborate plan that Wyatt has in the works. Liam receives an unexpected phone call that completely rocks his world.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt faces Hope and asks her to look at what this diamond has done and what it continues to do as the biggest story in the fashion business. What is greater, though, is what it is doing for them. Just look into the stone and she can see the future for them. He wants her to marry him right now. The Captain can do it right here. Liam checks in with Ivy who says her room is nice. He thanks her for sticking around. And he says his phone is still dead. But he tried to call Hope from a landline and she was still not answering. He hates to think of her just standing there waiting and waiting for him. She says he would have made it if someone hadn't pushed her in the water, so she will explain that to Hope. Liam hopes so as Hope will think it was all over since that was their agreement. So he just has to find her. Deacon returns to Brooke's office and says he hates to be a pest but he just heard from Wyatt. Hope and Wyatt are moving on so it sounds like the big blue rock is doing it's trick and Hope may have left Liam. Wyatt tells Hope that Liam sent her a message loud and clear at the Eiffel Tower when he was a no show. Now Wyatt is sending her one of his own with no pain attached. He wants a life with her. He wants to give her what she's never had, a partnership with no conditions, no vacillations or neuroses. He wants her to marry him right now in this moment. He knows it is crazy impulsive but this is a floating chapel. He tells her and it wasn't just the diamond. It was him and her and her message. She was loved by the world in Paris. Even Liam could see that and that is why he didn't show. This is their moment and she can put all of that behind her .embark on a future that will not disappoint her he promises. All she has to do is say one word. She says yes. Brooke tells Deacon that she has seen him twice today. He says when it comes to her, it's not enough. He tells her to relax, Hope is a big girl and she has two guys chasing after her. Bill calls and wants to come over. She says no, just tell her on the phone. He says his son and her daughter are getting married. She thinks he means Liam but he says no, it's Wyatt. He knows it will be difficult for Liam but he will have to find someone else. Brooke tells Deacon who is getting married. He sees her look and says Wyatt is a great kid; he made it on his own. And just think about the diamond he gave her. They are gonna be fine together. Wyatt is slick but he loves her. He'll treat her well just like Deacon would Brooke. He tells her the two of them made the most beautiful thing in his life. He says the fact that she went back to Ridge was a mistake and just forget about Spencer. He says he can be the guy she would be proud of. Their daughter is married now and it would be great for her to come home and see her parents together. A guy can dream and he has been dreaming of her for a very long time. Captain Marx calls Bill and says his son has requested the yacht for a week and he assumes it is all right with him. Bill says yes Wyatt has cleared it with him and he thanks the captain for getting the boat ready so quickly. Captain Marx says it was needed as there is going to be a wedding. Liam still chases around trying to get Hope on the phone. He says again he must find her as he knows he blew her off or that is what it will look like to her. This will give her the ammunition she needs. Before they head out, Bill calls. Liam says they were just leaving to find Hope. Bill says that she is not in Paris. She is in Monte Carlo on his yacht. She is with Wyatt and they are getting married. Liam is almost knocked over. Bill says he knows he is disappointed but in a situation like this someone was bound to get hurt. Liam says he has to go and turns to Ivy and says Hope is getting married. Hope looks around the deck and says it is beautiful; Wyatt has thought of everything. The captain says when he awoke this morning he had no idea what this day would hold. He asks if Wyatt has any words for his bride-to-be? Wyatt tells Hope that he never thought about getting married before or committing forever, no way. And then he met her. Just look at that horizon. They do not know what is on the other side. Side by side they can do anything. She brings out the best in him and always will. See there it is that smile. He wants to bring many more into her life. That's his promise to her. She giggles that she can not believe they are doing this. From the very first day she met him it was clear that he was impulsive and spontaneous and she was so drawn to him. She loves that the pushes her to do things she would not normally do. She thanks him for letting her see the world through his eyes. He really takes life and just dives in headfirst. He tells her to dive in with him. He knows this is for the rest of their lives, it's big .a leap of faith but they are ready for it. She takes off the necklace and hands it to the captain. Without a word she heads to the stern. Wyatt does not know what to think but he follows her. She climbs upon the railing and holds out her hand to him. He joins her, they join hands and he says leap of faith. They jump overboard with a big splash. The crew follows and the captain pronounces them husband and wife. Their first married kiss is them laughing in the water.",
