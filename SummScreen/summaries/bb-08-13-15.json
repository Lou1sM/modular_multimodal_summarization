    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach house, Ivy slept in Wyatt's bed. She dreamed that Aly appeared and implored Ivy not to let her die in vain. Aly said that Steffy had killed Aly, and it had been murder.\n\n\nIvy jolted awake and discovered Wyatt trying to rouse her and hand her a cup of coffee. She guessed he hadn't slept so well on the sofa. Ivy couldn't believe that there had been a wedding at her house the previous day, and she hadn't been invited.\n\n\nWyatt noted that Ivy had spent the night, sleeping in his shirt, and she looked incredibly sexy. The two kissed, but Ivy was too preoccupied with her dream to be into it. She explained the dream to Wyatt and said Aly had been asking for justice.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt entered the room. He'd promised to cook breakfast, but he only had cereal. Ivy was studying the video, looking for something she hadn't seen before. Ivy said she'd given Steffy chances to tell the truth; however, Steffy kept denying it. Ivy added that Thorne's life was in shambles, but Steffy went on as if it had never happened. Ivy knew that Aly had been emotionally unstable, but it didn't excuse murder -- which was the only way Ivy could see Aly's death.\n\n\nWyatt was worried that Ivy was letting the death consume her. Ivy guessed she'd turned into a real drag. Wyatt kissed her and said she could never be such. He felt that they'd been burned by Liam and Steffy, but it hadn't been with a bad outcome. He hadn't seen \"this\" happening at all.\n\n\nIvy hadn't seen it, either, but she also hadn't foreseen Steffy waltzing into town and turning Liam's head. Wyatt assumed Ivy was still having a hard time accepting what had happened with Liam. Ivy replied that it wasn't so; Liam had made his choice, and she'd made hers. \"When I give myself to you, Wyatt, there'll be no turning back,\" she uttered, and they kissed.\n\n\nIvy stared at the phone again, and Wyatt asked, \"What? What are you thinking about now?\" Ivy felt she'd been pretty understanding and had given Steffy every chance to go forward. Ivy hadn't told anyone really, and she hadn't gone to the police. She believed that she was owed something for her silence. Wyatt asked what she was getting at.\n\n\nIvy revealed that Quinn had overheard Ridge saying that he wanted to expand upon the new brand and add another face to Forrester Creations. Wyatt still wasn't sure where she was headed. Ivy stated that the Forresters didn't know it yet, but they kind of owed her, and she asked what better way to show appreciation. \"Than to what? Make you the new face of Forrester Creations?\" he asked.\n\n\nIvy stood, wearing Wyatt's button-up shirt that barely covered her panties. She said she knew Ridge would want Steffy to join Maya; however, Ivy could control the campaign, keep it from being too overt, and honor Aly's memory in that way. Wyatt believed that Ivy had proved herself in Amsterdam. Ivy believed it would be tough with Steffy's family in control and Liam as vice president.\n\n\n\"Even though he has zero experience in the fashion industry,\" Wyatt grumbled. Ivy said the people needed to understand that they couldn't have everything, and there were consequences in life. She asked if he was on board, and Wyatt said he had her back.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy was distracted in thought as Nicole and Zende cooed about being invited to sit in on a meeting. Thomas arrived, and the interns noticed that he had something on his mind, too.\n\n\nThe interns left for the sky lounge. While working out, Nicole thought they should be looking over sales figures. Zende guessed doing that would impress Ridge, but he said that if Ridge didn't cut Thomas slack, he wouldn't do it for Zende.\n\n\nZende noted that something weird was going on between Steffy and Thomas. Nicole had noticed it, too. She remarked that Steffy had gone through a lot with Aly's death. It was hard for Zende to believe that Aly, who'd been just a kid, was dead. Nicole said Aly had been a kid who'd tried to run over her cousin before attacking the cousin, and Nicole didn't blame Steffy for wanting it behind her.\n\n\nSteffy told Thomas that she'd had enough of Ivy's baseless insinuations. Steffy said that she needed to talk to Ivy, and if Ivy didn't back down, Steffy would go after Ivy with everything she had.\n\n\nThomas asked Steffy to cool down and think about things. He didn't think Steffy had a lot of options. Steffy replied that she could fire Ivy, but he asked what the chances were of Ivy taking it and quietly returning to Australia. Steffy didn't care. She was sick of Ivy making her the bad guy.\n\n\nThomas asked if Steffy had told him the whole story, and she asked if he was doubting her. He believed she'd defended herself that night. He said to leave Ivy to him, and he knew how to handle Ivy. Steffy said she did, too, but Thomas pleaded with her not to make it worse by going after Ivy.\n\n\nLiam arrived. Sensing something was up, he asked what was going on. Steffy asked him why he was there. He reminded her that he worked there. Kissing her, he said it was the best job he'd ever had. Thomas decided to leave the pair alone, and he exited.\n\n\nLiam remarked that Aly's death was shining a media spotlight on Forrester -- Steffy most of all. He said that she knew what had happened, and the media wanted to speak with her.\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Liam were working. Steffy was unimpressed by Ivy's work. Liam thought it was okay. Steffy said they needed more than \"okay,\" and she asked where the originality was as compared to Quinn's work. Steffy believed they needed to awe customers and admitted that she'd begun to wonder if Forrester was the right fit for Ivy.\n\n\n\"I'd reconsider that thought if I were you,\" Wyatt said from the doorway. Liam asked Wyatt why he hadn't knocked. Liam started to say what he and Steffy had been doing, but Wyatt interjected that the two had been ripping Ivy's work to shreds. Steffy claimed they weren't doing that, but she had some concerns. Wyatt wondered how objective Steffy could be.\n\n\nLiam noted that Steffy was the president. Wyatt added that Liam was \"VP,\" a fact he constantly reminded Wyatt of. Wyatt decided to remind them of his expertise in the jewelry business, and he deemed Ivy's work to be exceptional. Steffy said it might be for a different fashion house.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Liam was ready to throw his old girlfriend under the bus. Liam felt that Wyatt was overreacting. Steffy asked when Wyatt had become Ivy's defender but then decided she already knew. \"Maybe,\" Wyatt replied and hinted that there were a lot of things they didn't know about.\n\n\nLiam asked for enlightenment. Wyatt said he would if he could, but it wasn't his place. Wyatt asserted that Ivy was a Forrester and wouldn't be pushed out. He said it wasn't a wise idea to even try.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Ivy rushed in. Thomas appeared from behind a dressing screen. He'd been waiting to talk to her about the video. Ivy told him that videos didn't lie, even if Steffy had tried to convince him of such. He said he hadn't told Steffy about it, and Ivy was going to delete it.\n\n\nIvy didn't think Thomas was in the position to make demands. Thomas asked her to delete for everyone's sakes -- including Ivy's. Ivy asked what was best for Aly, but he said Aly wasn't with them anymore. Ivy replied that it didn't mean Aly's life and death hadn't counted.\n\n\nThomas called Aly a sweet, tragic, but troubled girl. Ivy snapped that being troubled wasn't a crime, and he said what Aly had done to Steffy was a crime. He believed Aly had premeditated the attack. Ivy insisted that Aly hadn't been in her right mind, and Steffy's actions had been appalling. Thomas wanted to know what was appalling about self-defense.\n\n\nIvy said it was appalling that Steffy had hit a defenseless girl with a tire iron. Thomas replied that it hadn't happened that way, but Ivy contended that the video said differently. He asked what Ivy wanted. She said she wanted what she'd always wanted -- justice for Aly. He sensed that it was more than that. Ivy believed that being quiet deserved more than just thanks.\n\n\nIvy claimed to have overheard Ridge discussing expanding the brand and taking on a new model. Thomas believed Ridge would ask Steffy, but Ivy said Ridge wouldn't if Thomas got to him first and changed his mind. Thomas said it wasn't like her. Ivy stated that he could help make her the new face of Forrester. \"Or my sister goes to prison,\" he concluded. Ivy stated that it was all up to him.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy wakes out of a dream that had Aly standing over her with the tire iron demanding Ivy do something to prove that it was murder. Steffy killed her. Aly says she did not die in vain and does not want Steffy to get away with this. Wyatt has a cup of coffee waiting and mentions how sexy Ivy is in only his pajama tops. He kisses her. She apologizes but he says his bed is hers anytime she needs it. She can not believe the wedding was last night in her house and she was not invited. Steffy is distracted but she invites Zende and Nicole to sit in at the upcoming meeting. Thomas walks in and sees Steffy looking like hell. She knows what he is going to say ..that she can't keep letting Ivy get to her. Enough is enough and they are just insinuations, nothing to back them up. Steffy says she is going to confront Ivy and if she does not back off she will go after her with all she has. She may even have to fire her. Thomas does not think it will be that easy nor Ivy will pack up and go back to Australia. Steffy says she is tired of being the bad guy here and repeats again how the attack went. Thomas wants to be sure she has a clear mind and it is not still blurry from that night. Thomas says he believes her, let him take care of Ivy. Liam walks in and senses some tension. Wyatt doesn't have much to offer Ivy but some cold cereal. She says she is not hungry and keeps looking at the video hoping she will find something she has overlooked before. Aly's life has been cut short and she has given Steffy ample opportunity to tell the truth but she has picked back up on her life as if nothing happened. It was murder, the only way to look at it. Liam tells Steffy that the media is really shining a light on Aly's death, they will want to speak with Steffy. Wyatt can see that Ivy is still having a very hard time with this. He kisses her again. She smiles and says they both were burned by Steffy and Liam. She is okay with the outcome by Liam. He made his choice and she is making hers ..never saw it coming. She even claims the Forrester's owe her and she'd like to be the new face of California Freedom. She knows it will be tough with Ridge CEO, Steffy as President and Liam as VP. But they have to learn they can not have it all their way. Wyatt says he is on her side and they kiss again. Steffy rejects one of Ivy's pieces for Quinn's and says Ivy needs more spark and wow like Quinn. She is beginning to wonder if Ivy is a good fit for FC. Wyatt walks in and hears this. Liam chastises him for not knocking but Wyatt says the door was open. And he does not think it very nice what Steffy was saying and she was ripping Ivy apart. Liam says Steffy is President and he VP. Wyatt says he knows; Liam reminds him every chance he can. Wyatt says the jewelry business is second nature to him and Ivy's work is exceptional. He'd think twice before trying to get Ivy pushed out of the company. Ivy is shocked to find Thomas waiting in her office and even more so when he demands that she delete the video. She says that he is in no position to demand her to delete the video. He softens it and says then a request. He does not think what Steffy did was a crime but what Aly did in attacking her was. What Aly did was premeditated. Ivy says what Steffy did by striking Aly over the head with the tire iron was horrible and they need to show the police and let them make their own conclusion. She feels she is owed a little more than thanks. She would like to be the new face of FC as Ridge says they will bring on another model. Thomas explains that will be Steffy. She wants him to change his mind. It's all on him. Either help her or his sister goes to prison.",
