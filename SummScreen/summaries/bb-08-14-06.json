Taylor explained that she hadn't had time to react, and she hadn't even seen Darla until she'd fall back onto Taylor's car. Thorne was furious at Taylor for lying about it for so long and demanded to know if she had been drunk the night she'd murdered his wife. Taylor admitted that she had been drinking that night but said she had not been drunk. She told him she wouldn't have driven if she hadn't felt like Phoebe had been in danger.\n\n\nThorne didn't think her explanation justified Darla's death. Taylor told him she would do anything to take back what had happened, but she had to tell him the truth. Thorne got really upset when he thought Taylor was blaming Darla by saying that Darla had fallen back on her car. Thorne was disgusted to think that Taylor had only been trying to relieve her guilty conscious when she'd reached out to help him and Alexandria.\n\n\nJust then, Taylor heard Phoebe calling her and woke up, realizing her confession to Thorne had all been a dream. Phoebe wondered why her mother was so upset, and Taylor explained the dream she'd just had. Phoebe tried to calm Taylor down and begged her to stop obsessing about the accident. Taylor broke down and said she couldn't stop thinking about it because the guilt was eating her alive.\n\n\nSeeing how upset Taylor was, Phoebe agreed that maybe she should tell Thorne the truth. Taylor was touched by Phoebe's unselfishness, and they hugged. Later, Thorne called and thanked Taylor again for everything she had done for him and Alexandria. He told her how much he wanted to be there for her too. Taylor began to crumble when he said that he knew Darla was grateful for all Taylor had done for them.\n\n\nAt Marone, Bridget stopped by to see Nick. She told him she felt like a fool for stopping Felicia's wedding when she hadn't even been in love with Dante. Nick told her not to worry because Dante just wasn't the right guy for her. Bridget admitted that as hard as she'd tried to convince herself that she'd wanted to be with Dante, in the end, she had just been using Dante to help her get over Nick.\n\n\nBridget assured Nick that she would get over him and apologized for making him feel uncomfortable. Before she left, she informed him that she had graduated and was Dr. Forrester. Nick was proud and wanted to throw a party for her.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Brooke's, Ridge approached Donna when she was looking at her picture in the latest Eye On Fashion and congratulated her on being the newest sensation. Donna was excited and told Ridge she was ready for more. Becoming a little shy, Donna said she was going to check on R.J., but Ridge told her he was sleeping. They began talking about how much they loved R.J. Ridge wondered if R.J. knew how much he loved him, since they didn't get to spend a lot of time together.\n\n\nDonna assured him that R.J. knew who his real father was and that Nick could never replace him. Ridge asked when Nick was going home, and Donna told him he shouldn't try to work his visits to R.J. around Nick's schedule. However, Ridge maintained that it was better for everybody if they didn't cross paths. Ridge felt bad about losing his chance to be a family with Brooke and R.J. Donna told Ridge it wasn't his fault and that Brooke had made the biggest mistake of her life when she'd chosen to marry Nick.\n\n\nWhen Ridge confided to Donna that he didn't know what to do with his life, she advised him to forget Brooke and move on. Later, when she was admiring her magazine layout again, Donna thanked Ridge for changing her life. Ridge thought she deserved all the credit. Donna felt like she was living a fairy tale and said those things never happened to her; they happened to Brooke. She admitted that Brooke was a hard act to follow.\n\n\nRidge told Donna she was captivating and a hard act to follow. As Ridge went on about all of her wonderful attributes, Nick walked in. He wasn't impressed with all of Ridge's flattery and asked him why he was still there. Donna huffed that they were talking business, but Nick didn't buy it. Donna angrily showed him the magazine layout, trying to prove that they were working.\n\n\nNick argued that the \"sleazy crap\" that Ridge was spouting was more about risky business. He warned Ridge to leave Donna alone, saying that she was not just another one of his bimbo models. Donna didn't appreciate Nick's interference and let him know that he couldn't be bossing her around. As their voices got louder, they woke the baby, and Donna went to check on him. After she left, Nick accused Ridge of using Donna in another pathetic attempt to win Brooke back.\n\n\nRidge pointed out that Nick had encouraged Brooke to let Donna be the new model. Nick said that was supposed to have been a new opportunity for Donna, not Ridge. Nick didn't like all of the touching, flirting, and kissing going on between Ridge and Donna. Ridge argued that it was completely innocent, but Nick believed it was all a ploy to get Brooke back. Nick added that he would protect Donna from Ridge's manipulations.\n\n\nDonna overheard Nick's remarks and confronted Ridge, asking him if what Nick said was true. Ridge refused to answer and walked out. Donna was crushed, and Nick felt sorry for her.\n\n\n",
