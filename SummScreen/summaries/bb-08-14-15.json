    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Katie thumbed through one of their magazines that featured Aly on the cover. Solemnly, she told Bill that his publication about Aly had been respectful. Bill was sure that other, nefarious outfits would dig for details. He believed that a Forrester being dead was big news, but Steffy being on the scene of it was bigger news.\n\n\nBill remarked that Steffy could have been the one in the body bag. Katie said it had been unfortunate that Aly hadn't gotten the help she'd needed. Bill assumed that Thorne had taken Aly to the best shrinks in Paris. Katie remarked that Liam had said Steffy was handling things as best she could. Bill felt that Steffy couldn't have done anything to prevent it, and Steffy was lucky to be alive.\n\n\nKatie wondered if Aly had snapped or if it had been premeditated. Bill thought Aly's hate board signified years of pent-up aggression. He figured Aly wanted revenge for her mother's death and for Steffy being a liberated woman. Katie quipped that she could find other ways to describe Steffy.\n\n\nBill felt that Ivy had blood on her hands for not reigning Aly in about Liam and Steffy. Katie said that Aly had just been loyal to Ivy after Steffy had stolen Liam. Bill concluded that it had been tragic loss for the Forresters, and dealing with it was probably a lot more difficult for Steffy than they realized.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Thomas said it was beginning to sound a lot like blackmail. Ivy stated that the video showed that it was murder. He didn't believe she'd go to the police with it. Ivy asked why she should cover for Steffy, who'd taken Aly's life. Aly had died in vain, and for Ivy's silence, Ivy wanted something in return. She wanted to stand beside Maya as the new face Forrester.\n\n\nWyatt arrived as Thomas was saying Ivy wouldn't be making demands if she wanted justice for Aly. Thomas asked Wyatt to leave, but Ivy said he knew about the video. Thomas remarked that he'd had a feeling that Wyatt was behind it. Wyatt stated that it wasn't a witch-hunt, and despite Ivy's instincts, she hadn't turned Steffy in. Wyatt believed Ivy deserved compensation for it.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Caroline agreed with Ridge's idea to add a second face to Forrester, especially since Maya wanted to concentrate on her marriage for a little bit. Liam and Steffy arrived before the meeting. Liam told them all that it was time to address the press coverage of Aly's death.\n\n\nLater, others arrived for the meeting. Carter held up magazines and said that all the outlets were covering Aly's death -- even Spencer. Liam took a look at his company's magazine, and Carter assured them all that he was on top of any possible libel cases.\n\n\nRidge moved on to discussing their image and marketing. He said Maya had done a great job as lead model and face of Forrester. He wanted to add another face. He told Steffy that it was time for her to step up to add some familiarity to the brand. Steffy believed that it was a good time for her, and Ridge decided that it was settled. Ivy said she had another hat to throw into the ring -- her own.\n\n\nIvy was sure Steffy would do a great job, and she understood that Steffy was Ridge's daughter; however, she asked him to think outside the box. Ridge said he hadn't asked Steffy because she was his daughter; he'd done it because she was the most qualified. Caroline noted that the campaign and photo shoots were already lined up and ready to go. Ivy responded that she was ready, too.\n\n\nRidge said it was nothing against Ivy, but he needed a seasoned model who was on par with Maya. Liam added that time was of the essence. Wyatt said he understood Steffy had the experience, but he thought they should give Ivy a shot. He reasoned that Steffy had a lot on her plate with moving to the city and her new job as president. Steffy snapped that she could manage.\n\n\nRidge said Ivy had her own career as a jewelry designer. Ivy knew that she hadn't logged a lot of time in front of the camera, but she recalled that it had been a huge success when she'd stepped up in Amsterdam. Carter said Ivy needed to credit Hope with some of it. Wyatt responded that Ivy was beautiful, poised, upscale, and everything that Forrester represented. Liam said they'd used Steffy before, and their clients wanted consistency.\n\n\nWyatt argued that Ivy was fresh and new. He reminded them that Steffy had been in the confrontation with Aly, and it wasn't a good idea to put her in the limelight until things were sorted out. Ridge felt that the accident had been sorted out, but Ivy reasoned that an investigation took time. Ivy said they didn't know what would be found, and Forrester could look really bad.\n\n\nUpset, Steffy started to go off on Ivy. Thomas interrupted to agree that they should go with Ivy. Steffy was stunned, and Thomas said it might not be a bad idea to keep Steffy behind the scenes until things blew over. Liam stated that Steffy hadn't done anything wrong and wasn't hiding anything. Ridge thought Thomas was making Steffy sound like a criminal.\n\n\nThomas stated that they had to be smart and respectful, especially with Thorne still grieving. The others contended that hiding Steffy might add fuel to the fire. Thomas just wanted to keep Steffy safe from scrutiny. Thomas noted that Steffy had a full schedule running the business, and Ivy had modeled before. He said Ivy was the safest bet for them.\n\n\nWyatt asked Ridge to consider it. Ridge said he'd think about it and ended the meeting. As people left, Steffy roared that she needed to talk to Thomas at that instant.\n\n\nAlone with Caroline later, Ridge was puzzled by Thomas supporting Wyatt and Ivy. Caroline thought that Thomas might feel slighted by the opportunities Ridge was giving Steffy. Ridge didn't think sibling rivalry was it. He and Caroline both knew why Wyatt was backing Ivy, though. \"Because they're hooking up!\" the two concluded. Caroline asked if Ridge would choose Ivy or Steffy.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Ivy thanked Wyatt for backing her. Wyatt said that Thomas had made good points, and if Thomas knew what was good for the company and Steffy, he'd convince Ridge to give Ivy the job. Ivy had noticed how quickly Liam had jumped to Steffy's defense. Wyatt wondered if it would change if Liam saw the video. Ivy said Thomas hadn't told Steffy about it.\n\n\nWyatt felt it would make Aly happy to see Ivy succeed. Ivy added that it would knock Steffy down a peg or two. He said there was no more waiting on the sidelines, and Ivy had too much to offer.\n\n\nIvy replied that Wyatt did, too. Wyatt knew, and he said he was way more experienced in marketing and fashion than Liam, whom Bill had made the vice president of Spencer and Forrester. Wyatt was sure there was something illegal about it. Ivy thought it was just like Liam to hang onto the two jobs as long as he possibly could without choosing.\n\n\nWyatt decided that Liam could have Steffy and the job titles. Wyatt said no one would stop him and Ivy, and it was their time to shine.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Steffy lit into Thomas for not siding with her over Ivy. Steffy raged that she was thinking of firing Ivy, not making her the face of Forrester. Thomas said he had his reasons. Steffy refused to allow it, and he replied that she might not have a choice.\n\n\nSteffy said she was president, and their father was CEO. She felt that they'd put Ridge on the spot, but she'd smooth it over because Ridge was still loyal to her -- unlike Thomas.\n\n\nThomas exclaimed that he was loyal to her, and the situation was more dangerous than Steffy realized. Steffy didn't care if Ivy was saying bad things about her. Steffy said that she could have gotten killed, and no matter what Ivy said, it was only Ivy's words against hers. Thomas replied that he hadn't wanted to tell Steffy, but Ivy had a video and was implying that the incident had been murder.\n\n\n",

Ivy says Steffy took away a life and she is supposed to be quiet \u0096 no, she wants something in return .right there next to Maya as the new face of FC. With Ridge and Caroline together, Liam and Steffy walk in and Liam says they are getting a lot of press about Aly's accident and he thinks they need to address that. Katie and Bill discuss the same thing, the news of Aly's death and how it is big news and needs to be handled in the magazine. Thomas tells Ivy if she really wanted justice for Aly she would not be making these demands. Wyatt tells Thomas that he too thinks Ivy needs some compensation, this is not a witch hunt. Ridge tells Steffy that he thinks it is time to step up. Ivy walks in and says she would like to put her name in the hat. Ridge says he picked his daughter and Liam chimes in that she has the experience. Bill explains to Katie that the board had been found in Aly's bedroom with nails between Steffy's eyeballs, just a little aggression there. This is a huge loss for the Forrester family but especially on Steffy for how it went down. She is handling it as best she can. Wyatt repeats that Ivy is more than just a jeweler, she is beautiful and can do this. She is fresh and new and they need to consider this since the confrontation was between Steffy and Aly. Ivy remarks this investigation could take months and they don't have time to consider all of this before making their choice. Obviously not wanting to upset Ivy, Thomas steps in and cuts them short before they consider more. He quickly says it might work out for the best for the time being until this blows over. Ridge says that makes Steffy sound like a criminal. Liam says that is going to happen no matter what really happened. The blogs will have a field day with it. They are hungry for gossip. Liam says if they hide Steffy, and she broke no law nor even came close, that will become suspicious. Thomas still says that Ivy is there best bet right now. Wyatt says at least think about it. Ridge thanks them for their input. Steffy barks at Thomas that she needs to talk to him right now. Bill takes all the credit for making Maya a household name so things are calm and cool now over at FC due to big dog. Ivy thanks Wyatt for jumping in there for her. Thomas was looking out for his sister .and is looks like now Liam is attached to the hip with Steffy. Wyatt wonders if that would change if he saw the video. He says Liam can have Steffy and he can have the titles at both Spencer and FC, but they are not backing down. It is their time to shine. Steffy rants at Thomas that she is his sister and he was supposed to be supporting her. He says this was for her. She doesn't understand. She was thinking of firing Ivy, not promoting her to be the face of FC. He argues that she has no idea how dangerous this situation is, what happened on that night with Aly, and Ivy knows. Steffy says it is only Ivy's word against hers and she was just defending herself. Thomas hesitates and says he did not want to tell her this. He wanted to protect her. He says Ivy has a video of that night of the two of them on the side of the road and she is implying that it was murder.",
