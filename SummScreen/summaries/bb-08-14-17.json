    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Caroline didn't want to be with Thomas just because of a horrible lie. She believed it should have been Thomas' choice. It hadn't been, so she intended to end the charade that day. Bill warned her not to sabotage something that would pay off soon. Caroline relayed that the lying made her feel less worthy, and she was worried that someone would find out the truth.\n\n\nBill rendered a guilty expression, and Caroline exclaimed, \"Oh, my God! Please tell me that Sally hasn't figured it out.\" He told Caroline not to be silly; that \"ginger\" wasn't smart enough. Liam, on the other hand, was too smart for his own good. Caroline asked how Liam had figured it out, and Bill said \"that ginger\" had shot off her big mouth.\n\n\nBill assured his niece that he'd keep her cousin in line. Caroline decided that she'd just tell Thomas that she'd had a good doctor's visit, and as it turned out, she wasn't dying. Bill asserted that Thomas would be back in Los Angeles before she could say \"Sally Spectra.\"\n\n\nCaroline suspected that there was more to it for Bill than her well-being. Bill glanced at his skyscraper model. Caroline called it impressive, and she read the address, which was 380 Wyler Street. She realized it was Spectra's address, and Bill asked if it mattered.\n\n\nCaroline replied that it mattered if Bill believed that Thomas being in New York would make Spectra fail. She seethed that she'd suspected Bill had had ulterior motives, and he didn't really care if she and Thomas got back together. Bill asserted that she'd wanted Tommy Boy, and Bill had agreed and made it happen. Bill said she should be thanking him, and she would be.\n\n\nBill stated that he'd have his building, Douglas would have his father, and Caroline would have the man she loved. Caroline asked what would happen when Thomas realized Bill had built his skyscraper on Spectra's land. Bill reasoned that Thomas already knew Bill wanted the land, so he wouldn't be suspicious. Bill added that, by then, Caroline and Thomas would be stuck like glue, and Sally would be out of the picture.\n\n\nBill assured Caroline that things would be as they should be. He advised her to get back to her life in New York with her son and her son's father. Caroline retorted that Bill's life was \"there,\" building monuments to himself and his empire. Caroline exited.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam didn't understand Steffy's hesitation to reveal the beyond-cruel thing Bill had done. Liam figured that he and Steffy could at least agree that they couldn't let Bill get away with it. \"No,\" Steffy replied. She was worried that Thomas would abandon Caroline. Liam disagreed. Liam suspected that Thomas wouldn't be happy that Caroline had begrudgingly gone along with it, but because they had a kid, Liam thought they'd work it out.\n\n\nSteffy began worrying that it might not be that way, and Thomas might sue for primary custody of the child. Liam said Steffy was trying to justify what wasn't right. Steffy believed it wasn't right that Sally ruined her brother's life. Steffy said Bill's extreme measures might be for the best.\n\n\nLiam asked how lying was for the best. Steffy reasoned that Thomas wouldn't be a part-time father, and he'd be around to tuck his son in at night. Liam said those were all things he'd never had in his life. \"And look at me. I've only murdered like eight people,\" Liam joked.\n\n\nSteffy was also thinking of Caroline, and she and Thomas were compatible. Steffy's phone chimed, signaling the arrival of a picture of Thomas and Douglas. Showing it to Liam, Steffy said it was where Thomas needed to be. \"Let's not interfere,\" she concluded.\n\n\nLiam asked if Steffy really wanted to win by turning Sally into a victim. Steffy loved Liam, who had an empathetic heart, but she said that she wanted Thomas to be the best father he could be. She stated that Liam should want the same for his cousin. Steffy had no remorse for Sally and asked Liam to just wait to see if Bill's plan worked.\n\n\nLiam asked if Sally was that bad. Steffy stated that Liam was always for the underdog, but Sally was a con artist. He asked if Steffy didn't think it had changed due to Thomas. Steffy was angry because Sally had used Thomas, his talent, and his money to keep that place afloat. Steffy said that with the relationship over, Spectra would tank. She believed it was a good thing for Thomas and his family.\n\n\nSteffy wanted to see if the plan would work. She said a little boy's future depended upon it. Liam relented. He said that if her feelings about it were that strong, he wouldn't say anything \"for now.\"\n\n\nIn the design office, Eric called Sheila, who was at her hotel, pacing with a gold wristwatch in hand. He informed her that he'd reunited with his wife. Sheila couldn't say she wasn't disappointed, but she just wanted his happiness. Wanting the same for her, Eric thought it was best for her to begin the next part of her life, somewhere other than Los Angeles.\n\n\nEric had also called because he believed he'd left his watch at the hotel. It had been a gift from Stephanie. Sheila said that housekeeping had given it to her, and she'd drop it off for him.\n\n\nLater, Eric was passing through the corridor as Pam and Charlie argued about a recipe. Eric announced that Sheila would be stopping by with his watch, and he wanted security to let her in. The leery Pam picked up her phone to call it in. Charlie followed Eric into the design office.\n\n\nCharlie asked if Eric were sure he wanted Sheila at Forrester and offered to send someone for the item. Eric replied that he was aware of Sheila's past and the trouble she'd caused; however, she'd been working on herself and had been more forthcoming with him than others. Eric asked what harm Sheila could do by dropping off a watch.\n\n\nEric said Sheila should be there at any moment. Charlie wondered if Sheila might go to the house instead. He asked if Quinn was there. Eric replied that Quinn was there. \"Alone?\" Charlie asked. Eric received a text message that Sheila was at the house. \"Let's go!\" Charlie exclaimed. Eric said he'd do it, and he exited.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Sheila knocked on the door. She tried the latch. The door was unlocked. She entered the house, announcing to Eric that she was there with his watch. When she looked at the fireplace, she imagined her portrait there and grinned.\n\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Quinn asked, descending the stairs. Quinn said she'd just texted Eric about Sheila's presence. Sheila said she had agreed to drop off his watch. Quinn replied that Sheila should have dropped it off with security at Forrester. Sheila began to say she'd assumed something, but Quinn interrupted, saying that Sheila had assumed wrong.\n\n\nQuinn didn't even think Sheila should be in the house and said Eric still had a restraining order against her. Sheila asked if Quinn would call Lieutenant Baker. \"Are you really that afraid of me?\" Sheila wondered. Denying it, Quinn said Sheila's intimidation tactics didn't work on her, so Sheila should leave the watch and get out. Quinn never wanted to see her again.\n\n\nSheila replied that Eric might feel different. Quinn declared that she and Eric were back together, and Sheila's pathetic attempt to get together with Eric hadn't worked. Sheila remarked that someone was still angry with her for telling the truth; something \"she\" should have done on her own. It made Sheila question Quinn's character.\n\n\nQuinn scoffed, incredulous that Sheila would say Quinn wasn't good enough for Eric. Sheila said it was clearer than ever that Quinn's portrait didn't deserve to hang on the wall. Quinn asked whose portrait did belong there. \"Yours?\" Quinn guessed.\n\n\nGiggling, Quinn realized Sheila believed her portrait should be up there. Sheila replied that Quinn's should not be after what Quinn had done with Eric's son, and Eric deserved better than Quinn. Refusing to be insulted in her own home, Quinn ordered Sheila to leave the watch on the table and get out. Sheila turned and put the watch on the table in the foyer.\n\n\nQuinn said Sheila had done enough damage to the family and ordered her to never return to the house -- \"Bitch.\" Sheila cocked her head and grimaced. She turned around and asked what Quinn had called her. \"I believe I called you a bitch, bitch,\" Quinn retorted.\n\n\nIn an instant, Sheila pounced on Quinn and knocked her onto a couch. Slapping and choking Quinn, Sheila yelled at Quinn to never call her that. Somehow, Quinn got up from beneath Sheila and mounted her back. Sheila knocked Quinn off. Quinn rolled over the coffee table and grabbed a fire poker, Sheila snatched a glass and vases from the wet bar. Sheila threw them, and Quinn charged, swinging the poker.\n\n\nSheila grabbed the poker, and the women tussled over the weapon. Sheila wound up with it and started swinging it at Quinn. Quinn climbed over the sofa and fell off the table behind it. As Sheila backed into the foyer, Quinn threw something at Sheila. Quinn grabbed a huge lamp, and Sheila ducked behind a chair. The lamp sailed into the coffee table in the foyer and shattered it.\n\n\nQuinn sneaked up behind Sheila and drew the poker in Sheila's hands up to Sheila's neck to choke her. The women rolled over the coffee table and couch, each at some point getting the upper hand to choke the other with the poker.\n\n\nSheila pushed as hard as she could, driving Quinn off her. Sheila backed Quinn into the fireplace and choked Quinn with the poker across Quinn's throat until Quinn sank to the ground and passed out.\n\n\nSheila stroked Quinn's hair and then put the poker back on its rung. She walked toward the door. Quinn chucked what looked like a black tablet across the room and hit Sheila in the back of her head. Sheila fell to the floor with blood oozing from the back of her head. Sheila was unresponsive when Quinn called her name and kicked her foot.\n\n\nJust then, Eric arrived and became terrified upon seeing Sheila on the floor, lying in blood and glass. He asked Quinn what had happened, but Quinn only touched her neck in response. Checking Sheila, Eric got blood on his hands. \"Quinn, you killed her!\" Eric exclaimed.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Eric calls Sheila with the happy news about his marriage and advises her to move on with her life - outside of Los Angeles. Eric then tells Pam and Charlie that Sheila will stop by to bring his watch. Sheila decides to deliver the misplaced item with the biggest effect: by returning it to the Forrester Mansion where she right on cue runs into a territorial Quinn. An argument of epic proportions ensues when Quinn calls Sheila \"a bitch\". A cat-fight ensues with flying lamps and vases. Sheila holds a fireplace poker to Quinn's throat until she loses consciousness. Quinn awakens as Sheila walks out and throws an IPad at her head.

Steffy thinks that Bill's extreme measures are for the best because Thomas is now reunited with his son. Reluctantly, Liam agrees to keep quiet. Caroline has strong feelings of guilt accompanying the lie that has reunited her little family. She also begins to realize that Bill's motives mostly stem from his desire to ruin Sally to get his hands on the Spectra property.

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam confronts Steffy that Bill told everyone that the mother of Thomas's son was dying and that cannot be condoned. They banter back and forth and she ends up saying perhaps Bill's extreme measures are for the best. Thomas and Caroline are more compatible. He asks what is now going to happen to Sally. Steffy says she is not going to give her one bit of remorse. Caroline sits and tells Bill that she flew here because she cannot do this. This little charade comes to an end today. Bill tells Caroline do not kill this now. It will only be a matter of time before Caroline has a miraculous recovery but not before Thomas is deeply connected to her and Douglas and wants to be a family. Eric calls Sheila, who is more than happy to hear from him. He tells her that he is back with Quinn and he wants her to be happy too but he thinks it should be somewhere else, not in L.A. He informs Charlie and Pam that Sheila is going to be dropping by in a few minutes. Charlie says he could send someone to retrieve his watch so she would not have to be in the building. Eric says he is well aware of Sheila's past and all will be all right. Instead of Forrester, Sheila goes to the manse and knocks but goes on it. Quinn finds her looking at the portrait and asks what she is doing there. Caroline bursts out that Bill does not care about her and Thomas.

She never wants to see her again. Quinn calls Eric and Charlie wants to go with him to the house but Eric insists on going alone. Sheila tells Quinn that her portrait does not begin to be worthy of hanging on that wall. And furthermore she is not leaving. Liam asks Steffy one more time what is so wrong with Sally.

Bill tells Caroline to get back to New York. Her life is there with Thomas and her son. She adds and his is with his new building and his empire. She leaves in disgust.

Sheila pushes her backward and then slaps and chokes Quinn and a violent fight ensues with Quinn picking up a fireplace poker and they push and shove and fight over it. It looks like Quinn is being choked. As Sheila quietly walks away Quinn comes to and throws her pocketbook as a perfect spiral pass at Sheila hitting her in the head. She falls to the floor. Quinn tries to revive her but can't. Sheila is bleeding from the head when Eric suddenly walks through the door and sees the mayhem.
