Not being deterred, Ridge said he could see that Brooke was still in love with him when he looked into her eyes. He pleaded with Brooke to leave Nick and give them another chance. Brooke remained loyal to Nick, but Ridge told her that she was making the same mistake he had made when he'd left her for Taylor. He told her she was going down the wrong path, but she was afraid to admit it to herself.\n\n\nRidge said he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her more than anything else in the world, but if he couldn't, he would go on living and eventually meet someone else. Brooke admitted they would always be connected, and seeing him with another woman would make her jealous. Brooke felt like she needed to stay away from Forrester, but Ridge said she couldn't run away from their love. Eventually, he thought she would return to him, and he didn't understand why it couldn't be then. They embraced, and Brooke's eyes filled with tears then she pulled away saying she had a meeting at Marone. Ridge tried to convince her to stay, but she insisted that she had to go.\n\n\nLater, Donna went in to see how things had gone with Brooke. Ridge told Donna that Brooke was pulling away from him because she was scared and couldn't deal with her feelings. Donna couldn't believe it when Ridge told her that Brooke was joining Marone's board of directors. Ridge said Nick thought if he could replace Forrester with Marone, maybe one day he might be able to replace Ridge with himself in Brooke's heart.\n\n\nAt Taylor's, Phoebe tried to comfort her mother, but Taylor couldn't get past her guilt. Phoebe told her again that she was fine with Taylor telling Thorne the truth. Phoebe thought that Thorne and the judge would understand that it had just been an accident, and Taylor wouldn't face a prison sentence. Taylor was hopeful that Phoebe was right. She told Phoebe one secret: she kept destroying her marriage, and she didn't want to let the secret destroy their lives.\n\n\nBefore Taylor could get out the door to tell Thorne the truth, Hector barged in determined to stop her. He told Taylor and Phoebe they had to go with him. He took them to jail and introduced them to Diane, a woman serving time for vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. Hector talked about what a good woman she had been before she'd gotten arrested and how she had always been doing charity work.\n\n\nWhen Diane began to talk about her downfall, it was chillingly similar to Taylor's. Diane said she had been racked with guilt and had confessed. However, if she could do it over, she wouldn't because no guilt was worth being in prison for ten years. Diane's tragic story left Taylor more torn than ever about what she should do.\n\n\nAt Marone, Nick eagerly prepared for his board meeting, excited by the fact that Brooke was going to be a member. He was surprised when Donna stopped in to thank him for motivating her to confront Ridge. Nick warned Donna to stay away from Ridge, or she would get burned. Donna let him know it was her choice to do what she wanted with Ridge, and he needed to butt out of her life. She told him to get over his attitude with Ridge.\n\n\nA little while after Donna left, the board members gathered, and Nick informed them that he was making Brooke a member. One of the members was not happy about a model becoming a board member. Nick told him not to underestimate Brooke. When Brooke arrived, Nick introduced her to the board as \"one of the most successful minds in business today.\" The board members remained skeptical. They began to discuss tactics for keeping Marone at the top of its game. When Nick asked Brooke how they could set Marone apart from the competition, she suggested that they paint the tankers green instead of black.\n\n\n",

Donna heads over to Ridge, who tells Donna that Brooke is fighting her feelings for him. Ridge informs Donna of Nick's idea of bringing Brooke on board at Marone Industries. Nick has Brooke sit in on his board meeting, but one of the share holders belittles Brooke for having no idea about oil and shipping.

Brooke admits that seeing Ridge with another woman, let alone her sister, does make her jealous, but leaves to see Nick as she has a meeting with the Marone Board.  Everyone at the Marone office is skeptical of Brooke coming into their infrastructure. Brooke arrives at the board meeting and suggests ideas that surprise and confuse everyone. Taylor and Phoebe prepare themselves to go tell Thorne the truth about Darla\u2019s death; Hector catches the girls before they leave and asks them to come with him before they go to see Thorne. Hector takes the girls to see an inmate in prison who tells them all about her time in jail. The more Taylor and Phoebe hear the less anxious they become about wanting to admit the truth.",

There they visit a woman who confessed to a drunk driving accident and is now serving ten years in prison. Ridge gets Brooke to admit that she's jealous of Donna, and not to consider leaving Nick.

She's making a mistake with Nick and he knows because he made one very similar a short time ago. But, if she is determined to go on this course with Nick, he'll have to move on. Eventually he will meet someone else. Is she willing to let that happen? Phoebe dogs Taylor to get her to eat something. She says she can't, she's sick inside. They discuss what confessing might mean. Thorne would understand and perhaps he could make the police understand. She doesn't want this secret to destroy their lives; she is going to tell Thorne. Hector shows up and demands that they all talk now. When she tells him she is going to tell Thorne, he insists they go with him. Donna shows up and tells Nick to get over Ridge and not worry so much about her private life. Brooke gets all teary-eyed when Ridge makes his pitch for her to stay. She knows she will always be jealous of him with another woman and she will miss their connection, but she can't be there, it's too painful. Donna questions Ridge's talk with Brooke and he reports she is afraid to express her feelings for him. Hector takes Phoebe and Taylor to prison where he introduces them to Diane Walker. They'd formerly worked in charity work together. Now she is serving ten years for vehicular manslaughter. She shares her story with them, how the police came and dragged her out of bed and she confessed. She thought it would give her some peace and put it behind her. But it didn't. Being here is worse than anything you could imagine; something to be avoided at all costs. Despite less than enthusiastic response for Brooke being there, she attends the Marone board meeting. She about sets them on their ears when she suggests they change colors of their freighters from black to green.",
