    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Eric and Quinn debated about Sheila recuperating at the mansion. Sheila preferred to leave if she wasn't wanted there, and Quinn said Sheila needed to be at a hospital if she was that bad off. Sheila turned it down, and Quinn offered to get round-the-clock nurses. Sheila didn't want Eric to go through the expense.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Eric had forgotten what he'd been through with Sheila. Eric yelled that he hadn't forgotten it. He could never forget it, but he wanted to repay Sheila for being there for him a short time back. He was adamant that Sheila stay through her recovery. Sheila thanked him.\n\n\nAlone downstairs later, Quinn picked up the large lamp and flashed back to fighting Sheila.\n\n\nUpstairs, Eric settled Sheila in a bedroom. As he began leaving, she told him that she appreciated what he was doing. He claimed it wasn't a problem, but she replied that it was for Quinn. Eric thought Quinn was a little threatened by Sheila. \"But you're not a threat, are you? Certainly not to our marriage,\" Eric concluded.\n\n\nSheila couldn't imagine anyone taking her in after all she'd done. She was happy that Eric had believed her, and it was helping her to believe in herself. Eric bade her a good night and left. Sheila picked up a music box and listened to it play.\n\n\nBack downstairs, Quinn winced and sat on the coffee table. Eric rushed over and asked if she was okay. He knew that she was angry. Quinn wasn't angry; she just didn't understand Eric's decision. Eric said Sheila had been through extensive therapy, and he'd seen the benefits during the time that she'd taken care of him.\n\n\nEric promised to never completely trust Sheila; however, he'd keep one eye on her at all times as she recovered from the injuries that Quinn had caused. Quinn asserted that neither woman should have let it get physical, but there had to be another solution. Eric promised to send Sheila on her way as soon as she got better. He assured Quinn that he could handle Sheila.\n\n\nEric decided to go up to bed, and Quinn said she'd be up there soon. Once he'd gone, she said to herself that she'd handle Sheila first.\n\n\nQuinn went upstairs to Sheila's room. Sheila greeted Eric, but when she saw that it was Quinn, Sheila grumbled that she hadn't heard anyone knocking before Quinn had entered. Quinn asked how many days it took, one or two, for a person in Sheila's condition to recover. Sheila said each case was different. Quinn wouldn't let Sheila get away with it. Sheila didn't know what she was trying to get away with. Quinn said Sheila was faking her concussion to get Eric back.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Sheila thought Eric would throw Quinn out and move Sheila in. Sheila said she'd already moved in. Quinn asked if Sheila thought she'd replace Quinn, and Sheila responded that she'd been Mrs. Forrester long before Quinn. Quinn countered that Sheila never would be so again, and Eric wouldn't have Sheila again, even if he were single. Quinn claimed that no one was buying Sheila's \"changed\" routine, and Sheila was still dangerous, pathetic, and unwanted.\n\n\nQuinn intended to see to it that Sheila was out of there the moment she'd recovered. Sheila said it was Eric's decision to make, and in the meantime, Sheila would be watching his cheating wife. In Quinn's view, there was nothing to see. \"Even when Ridge comes over?\" Sheila asked.\n\n\nQuinn replied that Sheila didn't even know what she was talking about. Sheila claimed to know Quinn \"because I was you.\" Sheila believed that Quinn couldn't get out of the way of her own destruction, and Sheila would be waiting for Quinn to prove she was unworthy. To Quinn, Sheila's belief that she was worthy proved how crazy and delusional Sheila was.\n\n\n\"Don't underestimate me, Quinn. Ever,\" Sheila whispered and chuckled.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam, who was leaving for the day, interrupted Bill and Brooke's canoodling to remind Bill of a conference call with Karen. Bill put the call back on Liam's to-do list, and Brooke asked Liam to tell Karen that Brooke missed Caroline being around. Bill thought Caroline wouldn't be back anytime soon, with Thomas in New York. Gesturing to Bill's model, Brooke said Caroline took after her uncle in getting what she wanted.\n\n\nLiam asked if something had happened. Bill replied that Spectra was going down, and \"Sky\" was going up. Bill revealed that, in the words of Vito Corleone, Bill had made C.J. an offer he couldn't refuse. Bill explained that he'd offered an additional tax-free five million. Brooke was awed by the lengths Bill would go to for the building, and Liam said she had no idea.\n\n\nAfter Brooke left, Liam said that no building was worth the lie Bill was telling. Bill replied that everyone benefited, but Liam countered, \"Not Sally.\"\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally cleared her office to talk to C.J. alone. C.J. had made up his mind that selling was easier for numerous reasons that he didn't want to get into. Sally refused to let C.J. do it and insisted that she could do it even if Thomas was in New York. C.J. questioned Thomas' commitment. Sally explained that Thomas would be back, and in the meantime, she had to make sure he had a place to return to.\n\n\nC.J. said Sally kept forgetting that the place was his future, too. He didn't know why he should take the risk on the fashion house. Sally told him that her aunt hadn't raised him to sell out. She urged him not to take the offer from Bill when Sally was offering monthly rent checks for the rest of his life. She said it was a no-brainer, and he knew what he needed to do.\n\n\nLater, Shirley, Saul, and Darlita returned to Sally's office to find out what C.J. had decided. Sally said C.J. was concerned about Thomas being out of town. Shirley told Sally to get on the phone and tell Thomas to make a beeline for \"the best coast.\" Sally didn't want to pressure Thomas. She was sure he'd be back, and until then, they'd do it on their own.\n\n\nBack at Spencer, Bill was saying \"I told you so\" after Liam had conveyed Steffy's reaction to Bill's scam with Thomas. C.J. arrived with the real estate contract. Bill hoped Sally hadn't broken out into tears. C.J. said it had been a good conversation. Bill noted that C.J. hadn't signed the papers and asked if he needed a pen.\n\n\nC.J. stated that he didn't need one yet because he was giving Spectra more time, and Spectra had an upcoming showing.  \"One more line, one more chance to keep Spectra alive,\" C.J. stated. Bill asked if C.J. was really turning down the offer and tax-free bonus. C.J. knew that it was crazy; however, he recalled being in the trenches at Spectra with his mother, and he wanted to give Spectra a fair shot.\n\n\n\"You know, without someone trying to sabotage it,\" C.J. added. Bill told C.J. to get out of his sight. C.J. left, and Liam asked if Bill was all right. Bill was fine, and he declared that, without Thomas, Spectra would fail miserably.\n\n\nAlone near the model building later, Bill decided that Caroline's miracle cure had to be postponed, and Thomas couldn't leave Caroline's side until Bill got his building.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally got a phone from C.J., who'd decided that he'd reevaluate the situation after the next line. After the call, the Spectra gang danced around the office.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Quinn cannot believe that Eric wants to open up their home for Sheila. She insists that Sheila is exaggerating her condition, but Eric reminds his wife that she is responsible for Sheila's condition. In order to keep this whole story out of the media, he intends to make sure that Sheila is not alone right now. Sheila is overjoyed when Eric helps her settle in one of the guest rooms because she sees it as a positive sign that he still cares for her. Liam interrupts a private moment between Bill and Brooke and realizes that Brooke does not know the lengths that Bill has gone to in order to secure the Spectra site for his skyscraper. Sally attempts to convince C.J. to give Spectra Fashion another chance. She reminds him about their success in Monaco and tells him that she can do the next line on her own. While Sally informs her troops that she could avert the crisis to be evicted from the building one more time, C.J. turns down Bill's extremely generous offer and explains that he has too great respect for his mother's legacy than to put an end to it prematurely. A furious Bill is now more determined than ever to see his plan through to the bitter end: Spectra Fashion must go.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn tries to reason with Eric that Sheila isn't as bad as he thinks and cannot stay with them. If she is, then she needs to be in a hospital. She is not taking the blame for all of this. Sheila herself says she does not need to go to the hospital. But Eric says he remembers all she has done in the past but he just wants to pay her back for her kindness since she has been back in L.A. so she stays here until she recovers. Liam drops in on Bill while he is with Brooke. Bill gloats that Spectra is going down while his Sky is going up. CJ stops in at Spectra and says he gave Sally a decent shot to make this work, but it didn't and now he has no choice but to close her down. He asks why has Thomas left her in this critical time. She says he will return but he needs a place to come home to. This is not how his mother raised him. This is not the time to jump off the Spectra train. Do not take that offer from Bill. He knows what he has to do. Eric says he is going to check in on Quinn but he wants to show Sheila how to use the intercom and says she can find anything she wants in the kitchen. She was helpful to him and he can do the same for her. She says he has helped her believe in herself. Sally explains to Grams and Saul what might be happening. Grams wonders if having Thomas here would help .call him and get him back to this dust post. Sally says Thomas will come back when he can but until then they are on their own. Liam has to admit that he told Steffy and she told him to forget all of this. CJ comes back and Bill asks if things went badly with Sally. CJ says she did not sign; he is giving her one more chance to keep Spectra afloat. She has another showing on board. Eric tells Quinn that he will keep his eyes on Sheila and if she does anything wrong then she is gone. He will never completely trust her but he can give her a place to stay for something that Quinn caused. She says there has to be another solution. He promises it will only be a short time and then he will send Sheila on her way. He can handle her. To herself Quinn says she will handle Sheila first. Liam cannot believe his ears that CJ is turning down Bill's first very generous offer plus an extra $5 million tax free dollars. CJ thinks Spectra deserves another chance so Bill throws him out. He tells Liam that without Thomas one more shot and they still will fail miserably. So now to Plan B. Caroline cannot be cured until that building is his. The group rejoice as Sally tells them that CJ is giving them one more chance. Quinn goes to Sheila's room and says she will not get away with this. Just how long is this recuperation going to last; Eric is never going to take her back. Nobody is buying that she has changed or prison has made her better. She will see to it that she will recover and be out of their lives. Sheila says she will be watching her too, the cheating wife. She knows Quinn as she was her at one time and she knows she will do something to prove she is not worthy. Sheila tells her not to ever underestimate her.",
