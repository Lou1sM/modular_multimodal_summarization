Ironically the detective in charge of the case recognizes Hector and wonders why they are visiting Diane. The Marone board considers Brooke's proposal to invest in a green image and style, only George is against the idea, yet she feels like bowing out.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke shocks the Marone board members by suggesting certain changes, \"greener and cleaner\". Nick beams with pride, others agree but old school George doesn't appreciate her even being there much less dictating policy. Sarcastically, he asks if she will be wearing a negligee or nothing at all? Sally is surprised to see Thorne back at work so soon. He just dropped Alexandria off at art camp and laments that it's pretty hard to be in the house alone. Diane Walker continues that she took her life for granted. One day everything was fine, the next it was ruined. It doesn't matter to the Justice System, not who you are, just what you have done. She can serve her time and she can confess to the whole world, but nothing will lift that burden from her shoulders. She drives the message home to Taylor and Phoebe, don't take that first drink and drive, you don't want to end up here! Lt. Baker visits Thorne but has no new information. Hector emphasizes again to Taylor that no judge is going to let her off without major jail time. And in order to help Thorne and Alexandria, she has to keep this secret. She has everything to lose and nothing to gain. Taylor finally gives in and says she will think about it. Lt. Baker, also there at the prison with another detainee, sees Hector, Phoebe and Taylor and becomes suspicious.",

The inmate told her that she was the one who needed to be the person who told the truth, and she told him that she would do anything to help him out. The pair left the prison together and were reunited with their friends and family. They were reunited at the hospital where Taylor was being treated for cancer.\n"
