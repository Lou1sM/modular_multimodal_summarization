    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Quinn's house, the exasperated Quinn waved her gun around, complaining about Deacon's so-called message from the grave. Deacon played his spliced video again and said he had her number. She insisted that he was dead wrong, but he replied that he didn't want her near his daughter.\n\n\nQuinn responded that Hope was married to Wyatt, who'd gifted the bride a fabulous diamond. Deacon contended that Wyatt wouldn't have had a diamond if hadn't been for mommy dearest. Quinn refused to give credence to the absurd accusations, but Deacon reasoned that they should let the police decide. She declared that she'd been friends with Ricardo, and he'd had nothing to fear from her.\n\n\nDeacon asked if he had something to fear. Staring at the gun, Quinn said she wanted him with her, not against her. She lowered the weapon and added that it couldn't happen if he didn't trust her. Deacon asked what was going on in that head of Quinn's.\n\n\nQuinn put the weapon away, and Deacon asked how someone like her had ever gotten a hold of a gun. \"It's my second amendment right,\" she quipped and added that she'd had it for years because she'd been a mother on her own with a son. Quinn felt that she and Deacon were a lot alike, but he retorted that he didn't poison people to get what he wanted.\n\n\nQuinn declared that she hadn't murdered Ricardo, who'd given her son the jewel because of the past kinship she'd had with him. Deacon insisted that the video didn't say that, but she contended that he'd edited to the video. She figured he was letting his imagination run away with him because of the sword incident, but she insisted that she'd been away at treatment and nowhere near Ricardo.\n\n\nDeacon wasn't buying it. Quinn proffered that she'd never do something to separate herself from her son, and she thought they'd be better allies than enemies. Deacon insisted she was out of her mind. \"What if I said I could get Brooke for you?\" Quinn asked, and suddenly, Deacon became quiet.\n\n\n\"So you're gonna help me get Brooke? The woman who wouldn't give you the time of say?\" Deacon incredulously asked. Quinn claimed, \"We're family now.\" He called her delusional. Quinn said she and Deacon both wanted what they couldn't have -- security, closeness, and family. She was sure he'd give that to Brooke if Brooke gave him a chance.\n\n\nDeacon declared that Brooke owed him nothing. Quinn said she'd hated Bill for years, but she'd realized that it hadn't been hate at all. Deacon chimed it that it had been lust. He revealed that he hadn't seen just Ricardo's message on the laptop. \"Whips, chains, leather? Who's a naughty girl!\" he haughtily derided. Quinn saw a fine line between hate and lust, and with Bill, she could have both.\n\n\n\"Not if Brooke has anything to say about it,\" Deacon responded. He noted that Bill was still in Brooke's heart, but Quinn claimed to have heard that what Deacon had shared with Brooke had far eclipsed what Brooke had shared with Ridge. Deacon asked who'd said that.\n\n\nQuinn said her point was that Deacon and Brooke were all about passion, and Quinn and Bill were all about adrenaline. She figured that was why the pairs belonged together. She asked him to think about their children having their parents together, experiencing the families they'd never had before. She reasoned that if she and Deacon could pull it off together, they could make it happen.\n\n\nDeacon said Quinn had given a nice speech -- transparent, but nice. Quinn insisted that if they worked together on their common goals, they could have companionship and family. Quinn was sure that Bill would wear Brooke down, and they'd be \"remarried,\" leaving Quinn and Deacon with nothing. Quinn declared that, for her, \"that\" wasn't going to happen.\n\n\nDeacon told Quinn that she didn't have much choice, unless he was missing something. Quinn reasoned that one provocative photo of her and Bill had almost been the end of Brooke and Bill. Deacon doubted it would work again. Quinn agreed, saying Brooke would see right through her; however, there was something at the core of Bill that he could barely control. \"His temper,\" Deacon replied.\n\n\nQuinn proposed that she and Deacon use Brooke's fear of Bill's temper and light his match to make him blow. Quinn said she was offering Deacon a way to make it happen for him with Brooke. \"Oh, the way you made it happen with Ricardo?\" Deacon quipped and made croaking noises.\n\n\nQuinn said Deacon needed to delete the video and all the copies he'd emailed himself because it was dangerous. He agreed that it was dangerous -- in the wrong hands. She insisted that they had to act before Brooke and Bill's wedding could happen.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Bill made sure Liam understood that Hope was a married woman. Liam bitterly snickered, saying he'd gotten it. Bill had hated telling Liam about the wedding. Though happy for Wyatt, Bill knew what it had cost Liam. Liam said he'd seen Hope waiting; however, fate had intervened, and Wyatt had made the most of it. Bill cited that it was who Wyatt was and who Liam wasn't.\n\n\nLiam guessed that he was supposed to be like Wyatt or Bill. Bill declared that Liam had to go for what and whom he wanted, because if he hung back, he'd lose. Liam yelled that he hadn't hung back; Ivy had fallen into the Seine. \"And you just had to save her,\" Bill dismissively added. Bill claimed to respect Liam for doing it but felt that if Liam had gotten on the plane when he had needed to, he would have been on time. \"Lesson learned. Trust me!\" Liam yelled.\n\n\nBill felt that he'd had a few lessons learned, but he and Brooke were back on track. Liam wondered how Brooke felt about Hope marrying Wyatt. Bill sat closer to Liam. He said Brooke wanted Hope to be happy, and he knew Liam would have made Hope happy if things had gone differently.\n\n\nLiam wondered if Hope knew how close he'd been, but Bill replied that close didn't count in horseshoes or with hand grenades. Bill relayed that there were no do-overs, and when Hope and Wyatt returned, it would be a happy time for them. He said he and Brooke had decided to throw a party, and he expected Liam to be there. Liam exclaimed that there was no way, but Bill declared that Liam would.\n\n\nBill insisted there would be peace in the family with no looking back. He ordered Liam not to make mention of Paris, Ivy, or any of it to Hope. Bill said Liam would accept the marriage and move on with his life. \"That's how it has to be. That's how it's going to be,\" Bill decided.\n\n\nOn the Stella Maris, Wyatt and Hope strolled around what he called the family yacht, and Hope squealed about being a Spencer. He thought she'd been crazy for jumping over the boat. Hopping onto Wyatt and locking her legs around him, she said she had to be crazy to marry him, and they kissed.\n\n\nA French song played as Hope and Wyatt relaxed in different areas of the boat and hurriedly left a room with a huge photograph of Bill on the wall. Later, they discussed how nice it was for Bill to offer to throw them a party.\n\n\nWyatt exclaimed that he and Hope were married. Giggling, she asked if they were crazy or what. He called it the beginning of a great adventure. Wyatt pulled Hope close and said that he loved her. Hope replied that she loved him, too, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Liam looked at the table full of pictures of him and Hope. The song, \"Hands of Time\" played, and he flashed back over their time together. He recalled giving her a ring on the runway and Wyatt giving her the diamond in the same place.\n\n\nLiam grabbed the pictures one by one to place in a box, and for every outfit that Hope wore in each photo, he flashed back to the moment he'd seen her wear it. Grabbing pictures from other locations in the room, he remembered her asking him to meet her in Paris to start their life together.\n\n\nAt the same time Liam was boxing up his memories, Hope was on the yacht, sifting through photos from the Paris shoot. She remembered giving up waiting for Liam. She flashed back to Wyatt finding her on a bench near where she'd been waiting. She'd put on her sunglasses and wordlessly walked away with him.\n\n\nLiam opened his laptop and deleted the background photo of himself and Hope. As Liam shed tears by his patio door, Hope smiled as Wyatt kissed her shoulder. \n\n\n",

He says he wants her nowhere close to his daughter. She calls his suspicions absurd and says she and Ricardo go way back and she would never hurt him. He takes umbrage of her calling him a moron as she is the one holding the gun and acting crazy. She puts it down and says she'd really rather work with him not against him. She would never do something to jeopardize Wyatt and the diamond. They argue back and forth. He thinks she has an answer for everything. She interjects that if she could get Brooke for him who he has been pining away for years, that would make them allies. He thinks about that. Bill tells Liam that things are different now. The competition is over; wedding vows have been exchanged and Wyatt and Hope are honeymooning on his yacht. Liam says Hope was there. He saw her but fate or someone intervened, so Wyatt was there. Bill says yes that is who Wyatt is, and Liam isn't. Liam says he gets it, lesson learned. Bill says Brooke wants Hope happy and he knows Liam too would have made her happy if things had turned out differently. On the yacht, Hope and Wyatt sip champagne to their good future and stroll along the deck, and kiss .and kiss .and kiss. Quinn pours a drink and joins Deacon and says it is now or never. They can make this happen. They will be in-laws. Deacon covers his ears. She belongs with Bill and his adrenaline and Deacon belongs with Brooke. They can toast to that. He says that was a good speech but a big IF. She says Bill has major temper management so they need to work on that. They can both have what they want and she is offering him that chance. She tells him to delete that video and all the copies. It is dangerous. They could be a formidable team but they have to act now. Bill says there are no do-overs. Liam is not to mention Paris to Hope. He is expected to accept this marriage and move on with his life. Bill is even going to throw them a party. Liam adamantly says no. Bill says yes there has to be peace in the family. This IS the way it is going to be. Hope thinks back to the Liam no show and Wyatt coming along and sitting with her on the park bench. Without a word, she takes his hand and follows. Alone Liam flashes back to happy times with Hope as he packs up all her pictures to put away. His eyes tear up.",
