Wyatt claimed it was dangerous to keep the video, but Ivy argued that it was proof of what Steffy had done.\n\n\nIvy angrily accused Wyatt of sneaking her phone away from her in order to delete the video. She wanted to know why he had done it. Wyatt admitted that he'd spoken to Steffy, and Ivy said he had fallen for her excuses. \"You're a Spencer male, and you can't resist,\" Ivy accused.\n\n\nWyatt said that Steffy had been worried about the video, and she had explained that Aly had attacked her with a rock. Ivy scoffed and said that Steffy was a liar. Ivy figured that Thomas had told Steffy about the video, and Steffy had decided to manipulate Wyatt. \n\n\nWyatt worried that Steffy would be charged with murder. Ivy didn't care. She didn't believe that Aly had attacked Steffy with a rock. Ivy insisted that they watch the video again to see if there was a rock in Aly's hand. They watched, but they didn't see a rock. Wyatt insisted that the angle and distance of the video made it hard to see if Aly had been holding anything. Wyatt maintained that Steffy had been defending herself.\n\n\nIvy argued that Steffy was a very good liar. Wyatt countered that if they showed the video to anyone, Steffy could go to jail, and it would be bad publicity for the family. Ivy said she didn't want to jeopardize the family name, but she didn't want Aly to have died in vain. \"Her death can't mean nothing,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nIvy said she would keep the video on her phone for Aly's sake. Ivy refused to allow Steffy to get away with anything. Ivy wondered if Wyatt was on Steffy's side. Wyatt said there were no sides. Ivy reminded Wyatt that she had been all alone in Los Angeles, and Aly had been both friend and family to her.\n\n\nWyatt kissed Ivy and carried her into his bedroom. They made out and made love. Later, they marveled at how great it had been. \"Wow, I wasn't expecting that,\" Wyatt said. Ivy said she wasn't usually so quick to give herself to a man, but she wanted to be desired and appreciated. She wanted to know she could trust him. Wyatt agreed.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office at Forrester, Steffy and Thomas discussed that Wyatt would delete the video. Thomas wasn't so sure that Wyatt could be trusted. \"Aly attacked me, and I defended myself,\" Steffy said. She maintained that once the video was erased, it would be Ivy's word against hers. Thomas worried that the police would dig deeper. Steffy reiterated that Aly would have killed her. She added that Thomas was stressing her out.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, he and Caroline met with Lieutenant Baker. Ridge discussed that he was surprised there were any questions about Aly's death because it had been an accident. Baker insisted he had a lot of questions. He noted that something smelled good -- it was hot dogs that had been delivered by mistake. Caroline suggested he have some. \"I wouldn't want to take your lunch,\" Baker said.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline watched Baker eat the hot dogs. Baker asked if there had been any animosity between Aly and Steffy. Ridge admitted that Aly had suffered from some mental problems ever since her mother had been killed in an accident that had involved Steffy's mother. Baker wanted to hear what Steffy had to say about it.\n\n\nSteffy and Thomas interrupted, and Baker offered his condolences for the loss of their cousin. Steffy wondered why he was there. He shared that it was yet another Forrester death on the same stretch of highway where Aly's mother had been killed. Thomas reminded the lieutenant that his mother had been cleared of that. Steffy pointed out that Aly had been trying to recreate the scene of her mother's death by killing Steffy. \"She had mental issues. She was crazy,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nBaker said he would have to talk to Thorne and the doctors who had been treating Aly. He agreed it was clear that Aly had been targeting Steffy. \"It just feels like something else is going on here,\" he said. He added that he had questions about any death that could have been a murder. Steffy looked sick.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy tells Wyatt again that he can not delete that video. It is her only proof of what Steffy did. He still thinks it is dangerous for her to hold and keep. Thomas asks Steffy is she is sure that Wyatt will delete it. She says yes, he seems a man of his word. And this horrible nightmare will be behind her. He hopes she is right. He just wishes she would have told the police everything the first time and not left details out as that is obstruction of justice. Ridge asks Lt. Baker if this now is being called a case as he thought it was an accident. Baker assures him he wants to do things right and right now he needs to ask Steffy some questions. Pam intercepts a delivery of hotdogs that were supposed to be for Jake and crew. They end up in Ridge's office and he offers Baker one when he mentions that something smells good. He wants the interns name as he thought he knew the best hotdog places in town. He tells Ridge that other officers questioned Steffy that night but he wants to follow up. Ridge explains that Aly had mental issues and was a troubled kid. Ivy wants her phone from Wyatt. She says she can not imagine after how close they are getting that he would even entertain the idea of deleting the footage. He admits he spoke with Steffy. Of course she says, he is a Spencer male and can not resist. And Steffy came to Wyatt instead of facing Ivy. He is easier to manipulate. They politely argue again of what they know and Wyatt says he does not think Steffy killed Aly. Aly had a rock and was attacking Steffy. Ivy says look at the video again, there was no rock. She wants to keep the video to help Aly's name someday. Steffy is a little freaked when Pam tells her that Lt. Baker is in Ridge's office. She waltzes in with Thomas. Lt. Baker slowly goes over the case and says another Forrester death on the PCH and involving Darla's daughter too. Steffy repeats the mantra she has been saying all along, Aly attacked her after putting a nail in her tire and then tried to kill her. Ivy goes into victim mode telling Wyatt that she feels all alone in L.A. away from her family and she feels he turned on her when he spoke with Steffy. She fell for Liam and Steffy took that away too and now her cousin. This is too much for her to bear. He assures her he is not on Steffy's side. He has found something in Ivy and does not want to mess this up. He says she is sorry and kisses her. He picks her up and takes her to his bed. She wants him to be clear that she does not give herself to a man on a whim. She wants to give herself to him but him to her as well. Her phone and the footage is important to her and Wyatt agrees to give it back to her. Ridge says again this was an accident and would not have happened except for Aly targeting Steffy. Baker says yes he thinks she did target Steffy but now something else is happening and he has to do an investigation.",
