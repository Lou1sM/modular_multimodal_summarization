Nick tries to put the engagement ring back on her finger. She was wrong to take it off. Angry, Bridget informs him it's not his decision. With a doctor's okay, Nick wants to sail away until after Bridget gives birth. He describes the life they can have. Does he want to run away with Bridget, or away from Brooke? A getaway would only make things worse. After returning, she would still be suspicious. Bridget would rather be alone! Nick won't let her go. Because of their child, he'll never let her down again. Bridget knows the baby can't make him love her. Nick is upset when she mentions Dante. At least Dante is truthful! Nick thinks she doesn't understand because she isn't friends with any of her exes. She can't bear for him to be the latest man in her life to make Brooke the center of his life. Nick accuses her of overreacting to their behavior after almost losing Hope. He feels Hope is his; where does that leave Bridget? Her love isn't enough to hold him. He has to leave so she can stop hurting. She never told him there was a child. Worried, Nick chases Bridget to the shoreline and demands an explanation. She tells him to go be with her mother. At the mouth of a cave, he asks if she's pregnant, as Stephanie told him. Crying, Bridget says she no longer has what he wants. Understanding dawns on Nick's face. \n\n\nFrom his jeep, Dante uses binoculars to spy on the former couple. He encourages Bridget to be strong. Dante stares at the ocean. He fantasizes he's on an Italian beach with Bridget, who is carrying their child. She loves him and he's happy. \n\n\nIn her living room, Brooke rejects Stephanie's gift box. Stephanie finally understands that Brooke's a victim, too. Men see her as the ultimate sexual refuge. Bridget will abort if she thinks Nick might raise their baby with its grandmother. Brooke wouldn't! She already has - with Deacon and Hope. Brooke can't just tell Nick to stay away; it didn't work with Deacon. She can't transfer overseas: it has to be a complete break. RJ will be fine; Ridge will understand, and even be grateful. As Brooke unwraps the gift, Stephanie dons a pair of white cotton gloves. Brooke is unsettled, so Stephanie has to open the box. She pulls out a silver handgun! \n\n\n",

    "yt": "\n\nStephanie berates Brooke, while Brooke counters and states she never meant to hurt anyone. Stephanie encourages Brooke to open the gift box.  Brooke is suspicious that the solution to all their problems could be found in a little box. Upon opening the box, Brooke is shocked and horrified to find an antique gun. Nick holds Bridget in his arms and asks her to go sail away before the baby is born.  Bridget tells Nick that she doesn\u2019t want to go away, to just come back to the same problems. Nick assures her things are different, and the baby is proof. Bridget feels Nick is just trying to do the right thing because a child is involved. Nick grabs Bridget and insists they work things out because of the baby. Bridget then announces she never said there was a baby. Bridget storms out of the Beach House and runs crying down towards the ocean.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nick begs Bridget to come back to the boat with him. She refuses. She thinks he's running away from her mother and not running away with her. She tells him to leave and he refuses asking her about the baby. She tells him she never told him there was a baby and that she doesn't have anything he wants. Dante is within binocular distance away and begs Bridget to be strong. He then daydreams about them living in Italy and her telling him THEY are going to have a child. Stephanie continues to get Brooke to open the box. Telling her all her and Bridget's problems are solved with the contents of that box. Brooke finally begins to open it as Stephanie dons a pair of white gloves. Brooke gets creeped out and asks her to leave. Stephanie shows her what's in that box. A gun!",
