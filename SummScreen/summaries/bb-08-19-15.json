Wyatt offered to take her home to change her clothes. They flirted and embraced, but Ivy said she would drive herself home. Before she left, Ivy wanted to make sure they were on the same page about Steffy.\n\n\nWyatt acknowledged that he would never delete the video on Ivy's phone because Ivy had asked him not to. They kissed, and Ivy left to go to work. Wyatt promised to see her later.\n\n\nAt Forrester, in Ridge's office, Steffy, Thomas, Caroline, Ridge, and Liam discussed that Lieutenant Baker had been there the previous day, and Liam worried that it was the first he had heard of it.\n\n\nThomas and Caroline worried that Bill could make it a story if the police continued to quiz Steffy, but Steffy confidently said there was no story. Liam looked confused, and Steffy said she had to leave. The meeting broke up, and Ridge and Thomas discussed that Steffy needed to stay out of the limelight, but Ridge was worried there was something more that Steffy and Thomas were hiding. Thomas said he wanted to protect Steffy.\n\n\nCaroline intervened and said the police had to investigate. Ridge quizzed Thomas about Steffy, but Thomas told his father not to worry. Ridge left, and Caroline promised to help Thomas with his design.\n\n\nCaroline used her pencil to sketch on Thomas' design, and Thomas was clearly smitten and attracted to Caroline. She didn't notice, but she worried that he was distracted. She knew he was concerned about Steffy. Thomas agreed.\n\n\nLater at Wyatt's, Steffy visited Wyatt and quizzed him about deleting the video on Ivy's phone. Wyatt tried to explain that he'd had Ivy's phone in his hand, but Ivy had caught him. \"What did you tell her?\" Steffy asked in a panic.\n\n\nSteffy worried that Ivy knew everything, and it would make the situation \"a thousand times worse.\" Steffy added that Ivy had more ammunition and was out of control. Wyatt explained that he and Ivy were involved in a relationship, and he wouldn't lie to her.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that Ivy was smart and probably had a copy of the video. Steffy said they would have to get the copy too. Wyatt reminded Steffy that she was being unreasonable.\n\n\nSteffy maintained it would be her word against Ivy's without the video. \"It's not about you. It's about Ivy and Aly. Ivy is hurting,\" Wyatt said. Steffy agreed, but she said Ivy was out for revenge because Liam had chosen Steffy rather than Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy added that she had chosen Liam over Wyatt. Wyatt disagreed. Steffy shouted that they weren't in high school. \"This video could get me in real trouble. This video is dangerous and doesn't show what really happened,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam was in Ivy's office, and Ivy entered. She accused Liam of visiting her to help get Steffy out of a jam. \"She hasn't said anything about a jam,\" Liam maintained. Ivy realized that Steffy had said nothing to Liam about the video on Ivy's phone.\n\n\nIvy wondered what Liam wanted. Liam seemed to want to have a friendly conversation, but Ivy refused. She wondered if he had left her because she was too sweet and honest. She guessed he wanted the edgy, dangerous girl he'd gotten. Steffy was \"naughtier and darker,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nLiam argued, but Ivy said that Liam deserved to know what he'd chosen. \"She's not as blameless in all of this as she pretends to be,\" Ivy said. Liam insisted that Ivy stop blaming Steffy for the tragic accident that had killed Aly. \"I was there, and they were fighting,\" Ivy countered. Liam argued that Aly had fallen and hit her head on a rock. \"Is that what happened?\" Ivy asked in mocking tone.\n\n\nIvy wondered if that was what Steffy had said, and Liam asserted it was. She asked if Steffy had talked about the accident, and Liam said she didn't want to discuss it. Ivy suggested that Steffy was probably distracted and showing signs of anxiety. Liam admitted that Steffy had been under a lot of stress.\n\n\nIvy reminded Liam that he had chosen Steffy. Liam argued that he had truly loved Ivy, but Ivy told him to stop. \"And now you have her and all her secrets. You really want to know what happened that night? Go speak to your girlfriend,\" Ivy challenged. Liam looked confused. Ivy left.\n\n\nLater at Wyatt's, Ivy told Wyatt that Liam believed that Steffy was the victim. Ivy added that Liam knew nothing about the video. Wyatt wondered if Ivy had told Liam about it, but Ivy said she hadn't said anything about it. She had merely advised Liam to ask Steffy about her involvement in Aly's death.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam was in his office, and Steffy joined him. Liam had thought Wyatt was meeting him, but Steffy said she had just been with Wyatt at his house. Liam wondered why Steffy would leave a meeting at Forrester to see Wyatt at his home. Steffy dodged Liam's questions, but she said that she needed Wyatt to speak to Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy said that someone needed to remind Ivy that Steffy was her boss. She knew that Liam couldn't do that because Ivy was mad at him. Liam agreed that Ivy was very upset with him and Steffy. \"Mad doesn't even begin to cover it,\" he said. Steffy said that Ivy was immature and jealous. Steffy wanted Wyatt to get Ivy to stop talking about Aly's death.\n\n\nLiam asked about the details, and Steffy said that Aly had lost it. \"She attacked me,\" Steffy said. Liam countered that Ivy thought something else had happened. Steffy said nothing. Liam said that Ivy had hinted that Steffy was responsible for Aly's death. \"You're not responsible for Aly's death, are you?\" Liam asked.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy thanks Wyatt for bringing her coffee the next morning. He says it is almost as sexy with her putting his clothes on as in taking them off. He does not mind them being late for work; they can tell all they had a breakfast meeting. She tells him how lucky he is that he did not delete that video. He says it is still there because she asked him not to. At the meeting Steffy is clearly distracted when they ask her about Lt. Baker questioning her. She says it is no story; she has taken care of it ..everything is under control. Liam is surprised this is the first he is hearing about it. She jokes that he was more interested in the hotdog they gave him at lunch than about Aly, so nothing to worry about. They didn't even get started when Steffy said there was something she needed to take care of and needed to go; it would not take long. Ridge tells the others that for some reason Steffy is on Baker's radar and he wants to know why. Steffy shows up at Wyatt's and says he knows why she is there. She demands to know if he deleted the video. He admits that no he didn't. Ivy is hurting. She was the closest to Aly as anyone. Steffy says Ivy is blackmailing her, also Wyatt. He is lashing out at Steffy because she chose Liam over him. They both feel like they got a raw deal but this is not a game she is playing. She realizes this video could get her in real trouble with Ivy going behind her back and spreading these rumors. She is innocent. Aly attacked her and she defended herself. The video is dangerous and does not show what really happened. Liam and Ivy argue what really happened. She says that is not what she saw and she was there. He admits that he knows she is still angry at him for choosing Steffy over her and he is sorry for that, but that does not change this outcome. She says fine, he chose Steffy and now he gets her and all her secrets so he can go ask her exactly what happened. Ivy goes back to Wyatt's and he is glad she is going to play hooky. She says no, but Liam was there and got her all riled up. Steffy was the one who came back into town and broke them up yet Ivy is the one who is now suddenly vicious. But Liam hasn't seen the video and Steffy hasn't mentioned it either. Wyatt reminds her they have talked about this and she needs to let Steffy deal with this in her own way. Ivy arrives at FC and runs into Liam. She asks if Steffy sent him to talk to her as she knows that would be awkward. First Steffy takes Liam from her and now wants his help with Ivy in a jam. He wants to know what sort of jam Steffy is in. Ivy says she assumed he would know. She says she is not enjoying this but he needs to know his precious little Steffy is not as blameless as she claims. Steffy goes back to the office and Liam is surprised that she left the meeting to go see Wyatt. She says she went to see him about his new girlfriend. Someone needs to remind her that Steffy is the boss and she needs to be shown respect. She laments she would have asked Liam but Ivy is not exactly warm and fuzzy toward him either. She's just jealous. Steffy says they all know what happened and they need to put it behind them. Liam says no, Ivy thinks something else happens. She did not come out and say it but she does think that Steffy is responsible and he knows she is not.",
