    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's old office, Steffy asked if Liam was asking if she was responsible. She didn't know how to answer him. She asked if Aly would still be dead if Steffy hadn't been on the roadside with her. Steffy guessed not but said Aly had attacked Steffy. Steffy asked if it made Aly responsible. Steffy didn't know. Liam replied that it was a simple question with a simple answer.\n\n\nLiam posed his question a different way, asking if Steffy had caused Aly's death. Steffy admitted that she had, just not in the way Ivy meant. He guessed they were back to her shutting him out when the going got tough. She claimed it wasn't true, but he asked why he was just hearing about it.\n\n\nSteffy explained that things hadn't been clicking in her mind when the police had been asking her questions. Her brain had been stuck on the question of how it could have happened. Liam stated that he'd been under the impression that Aly had hit her head in the struggle.\n\n\nSteffy recounted the struggle with Aly, the tire iron falling, and Aly wielding a rock. Steffy explained that she'd grabbed the tire iron and swung it blindly. She claimed that she hadn't known if she'd even hit Aly, and she'd thought she'd been telling the police the truth about it being self-defense. Liam agreed that it had been self-defense, but Steffy said Ivy didn't see it that way.\n\n\nLiam figured that Ivy was grieving and hurting, and it was Steffy's word against Ivy's. Steffy said Ivy had a video that she was threatening to use against Steffy. Liam couldn't understand who would decide to film something at a time like that. He wondered how the video contradicted Steffy. Steffy hadn't seen the video but stated that Wyatt had said the video was bad for her.\n\n\nLiam asked why Wyatt was involved. Steffy replied that it was due to Ivy, who'd convinced Wyatt not to delete the video after Steffy had asked him to. Liam believed Wyatt was behind it because Ivy wouldn't use leverage to get what she wanted. Steffy told him not to be so sure of it.\n\n\nSteffy hated what had happened to Aly, but Steffy wouldn't let Ivy blackmail her. Liam wanted to see the video before deciding what to do. Steffy didn't think she could watch it. He asked if she trusted him, and she replied that they wouldn't be talking about it if she didn't. With a kiss, he said to let him handle it, and he'd see her back at the house.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt was miffed that Ivy had told Liam to ask Steffy what had happened with Aly. To him, Ivy had done it because she knew that Liam would confront Steffy, go all moral on her and need space, and then wind up on Ivy's doorstep, saying, \"'You know what? I'm so sorry. I love you. I should have listened.'\" Wyatt said it was how it always happened, but he wouldn't do that dance again.\n\n\nIvy swore she hadn't had any ulterior motives. She'd just wanted Liam to hear Steffy's answer for himself. Wyatt calmed down but said that the fewer people who knew, the better because, when things got out in the open, they assumed a life of their own.\n\n\nIvy wanted to change the subject. Wyatt noted all the questions in the air about her becoming the lead model or them losing their jobs. Ivy asked if she had a split personality. He chuckled, asking who in their town didn't have one. Ivy said she'd been the good girl, but she'd tricked Liam into marrying her. \"What are you talking about? That's Liam's favorite way to get married,\" Wyatt replied.\n\n\nIvy didn't know how she'd wound up in the high-stakes situation with Steffy. Wyatt reasoned that her best friend's death had changed things, but Ivy replied that Ivy hadn't died. Cupping her face, he told her that he liked her the way she was right then, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Ivy and Wyatt were cuddled on the couch when Liam entered. Wyatt remarked that Liam hadn't knocked, and Liam said it was a way to find out things people wouldn't tell him. Ivy apologized and said she hadn't realized that they needed to send him a memo. Wyatt joked that she should have gotten Liam an \"I'm dating your brother\" greeting card. Liam stated that Ivy and Wyatt deserved to be happy and should do anything they could to make it possible -- except a crime.\n\n\nWyatt asked what Liam was talking about. Liam said he was talking about using fear to control and take advantage of a person. He called it blackmail and assumed the price of silence was being the new face of Forrester. Ivy asked him how long he thought she'd have a job at Forrester after Steffy had taken Liam and made herself Ivy's boss. Ivy asked why Liam defended Steffy when Aly was the dead one.\n\n\nLiam didn't think Ivy was going about getting justice in the right way. Wyatt asked Liam why Steffy hadn't told Liam the full truth. Liam asserted that it had been self-defense, but Wyatt replied that the only actual witness contradicted it. Ivy said she'd kept silent and was aware that news of it could cripple Forrester. Ivy claimed to be trying to stop it -- if she could.\n\n\nWyatt noted that Steffy was running Forrester but had to be on the cover of every magazine, wearing every garment and piece of jewelry that they made. He asked if it was really blackmail to suggest that Steffy sit down for a second.\n\n\nLiam wanted evidence that it hadn't been self-defense. Ivy showed him the video, and he was disturbed by the footage. Ivy asked if he'd call it self-defense, because to her, it was murder.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Thomas told Caroline that he couldn't talk to Ridge about what was happening with Thomas and Steffy. Caroline assumed it meant Thomas didn't think he could talk to her, either. He replied that it would be asking her to hide something from Ridge.\n\n\nCaroline agreed that she couldn't keep things from Ridge, but she also didn't have to tell Ridge about every conversation she had that didn't pertain to him. She suggested that Thomas talk to her until she heard something that made her have to stop listening.\n\n\nThomas explained that the problem wasn't between him and Steffy, but between Steffy and Ivy. He remarked that he had no idea what it was like to kill someone. Caroline said no one had said \"that\" had happened to Aly. He offered to stop talking if Caroline couldn't keep it between them.\n\n\nCaroline told Thomas to go on, and he revealed that Ivy was blackmailing Steffy with a video that didn't show everything that Steffy had said. He hoped Caroline saw why he couldn't go to Ridge. Caroline seemed uncertain about it but relented because she'd gotten herself into it.\n\n\nThomas said it wouldn't do any good to tell Ridge. He said that if Ridge pressed Steffy to go to the police, she and Ivy would each have to change their statements, but nothing would change it being self-defense. Caroline asked if it looked that way on the video or not.\n\n\nAt Il Gardino, Ridge concluded a business meeting with a kiss on a woman's cheek. As the woman left, Katie happened along and said, \"The master at work.\" Katie was there for lunch with Bill, but Bill had just text-messaged a frowny face because he wouldn't make it. Ridge found the emoji from Bill amusing and decided to stay while Katie had lunch.\n\n\nLater, Katie felt bad about delaying Ridge, who'd already eaten before she'd arrived. Ridge said he didn't get to see her without the \"old Bill and chain.\" They talked about the two-and-a-half-year-old Will, and Katie noted that Ridge was back in father mode with Thomas and Steffy in town.\n\n\nKatie asked if the siblings had formed a secret alliance to defeat him yet. Ridge replied that they did have a secret. Ridge discussed his relationship with Thomas and his desire to encourage Thomas. Katie remarked that the men had been through rough patches. Ridge was glad he hadn't inherited his father's paranoia about the eldest son stealing something from him.\n\n\nKatie believed Ridge was being hard on Eric, but Ridge added that he hadn't inherited Eric's lovability, either. Katie suggested that Thomas might be acting protective over his sister, who'd been through a lot. She wondered if he'd just asked the siblings what was going on. Ridge stared back at her, and she figured he thought parents should be mind readers.\n\n\nKatie asked about Caroline, but Ridge asked if it was a good topic for them. Katie remarked that, in the past, they'd been able to discuss Brooke and Bill. Ridge relayed that Caroline made him happy, but he still worried about her legs. Katie wondered if the problem with Steffy and Thomas could be their whispers about Caroline. \"No, they aren't whispering. I can hear them loud and clear,\" Ridge replied.\n\n\n",

She does not want him back. She is not that big a fool. She told Liam to go see Steffy and get the real story from her. Wyatt says she will tell him. Ivy says no, she will lie. He disagrees as both of them know too much. If Steffy tells the truth Liam will go all moral on her and come sniffing around Ivy's door again .and saying he is sorry and still loves her. That is what always happens and he is not going to do that dance with him anymore. She swears she did not have an ulterior motive. She just wanted Liam to hear it directly from Steffy. Bill calls off lunch with Katie and she runs into Ridge who convinces her to sit down with him. He says he is the boss and he is not slacking off. Thomas wants to tell Caroline something but is afraid she will have to keep it from Ridge. She says that is okay. She does not have to tell him every little conversation she has if it does not concern him. He laments that Steffy is being blackmailed for something she did not do. And Ivy has the video. Liam wonders out loud to Steffy why he is just now hearing all these details. How is it possible that Aly fell and hit her head and then died. Steffy admits that she hit at Aly blindly and did not know when she talked to the police if it connected or not. She thought she was telling the police the truth. But now Ivy says differently. And she has a video and is threatening to use it against her. No one can imagine how or why Ivy did that. She admits she has not seen it but Wyatt says it looks really bad. He wonders why Wyatt is even involved in this and she explains Ivy asked him not to delete it. Liam says Wyatt has to be behind this as Ivy would not be using leverage like this. Steffy says she definitely will not sit still and let Ivy blackmail her. Liam tells her to trust him. He will find a way to see the video. Ridge confides that he is still working that delicate balance of trying to support Thomas and encouraging him in his designs too. They have been through some rough patches but the good news he did not inherit his own father's paranoia in thinking that his oldest son is gonna steal something from him. Katie says Thomas is probably just trying to protect his sister whose nerves of steel must be rattled about now. Katie gets around to asking about Caroline. Ridge confides she has problems still with her legs and he is afraid she has lost some strength and is afraid of bumping into things or falling. Katie says if he thinks his son and Caroline are whispering behind his back it is probably just this, about her health. Liam charges into Wyatt's house while he and Ivy are canoodling on the couch. Wyatt chastises him for not practicing his own proponent of knocking first. Liam apologizes but says it is kind of hard when no one will tell you what you want to know. Wyatt jokes that they should have picked out a card in the \"I'm dating your brother\" in the greeting card section. Liam assures them that both deserve to be happy and they should do just that ..except for crime. Perhaps they will stay just this side of criminal. That video could be blackmail and he demands to see it. He accuses Ivy of her silence being worth her being the new face of FC. Ivy laments she would not be at FC long if it were up to Steffy. She came back to town, took her boyfriend and makes herself their boss. She has everything now. Aly is dead so why is Liam defending Steffy? Liam reminds her if this is justice for Aly, this is not the way to do it. He looks at the video and says he needs to be convinced. Ivy says he may call that self defense; she calls it murder.",
