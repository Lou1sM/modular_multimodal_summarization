    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Il Gardino, Katie and Ridge discussed his relationship with Caroline. Katie said that Caroline had been clear about wanting to have a family and asked how Ridge felt about it. Ridge was silent, and Katie figured that she already knew his answer.\n\n\nRidge shrugged it off, saying Caroline was young. Katie doubted motherhood was something Caroline would just grow out of. He reasoned that he and Caroline were just starting out; they had traveling and adventures ahead, and she might not want to give it up at that moment.\n\n\nKatie didn't know why Caroline had to give it up when there were options for women with children. Ridge asked whose side Katie was on. She said she wasn't on anyone's side. She just knew he'd agreed to be a father to Will and was curious about why Ridge was reluctant to start a family with Caroline. Ridge relayed that he didn't want to start over, and he'd been honest with Caroline about it.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Caroline was overwhelmed by the information Thomas had given her about Steffy and Aly but thought that the whole story was on video. Thomas said the video was damning, and he hinted to the reason for Ivy's sudden interest in becoming the new face of Forrester.\n\n\nCaroline was astounded that Ivy would hold the video over Steffy's head. Thomas told Caroline that she couldn't tell Ridge, but she said Ridge would want to help Steffy. Thomas insisted that he'd protect Steffy. He added that he was also concerned about Caroline because of her relationship with his father.\n\n\nCaroline claimed to be happy with Ridge, and Thomas urged her to be honest about it because he'd just been honest with her. She replied that he was cynical about his father, and he asked if Ridge was giving her everything she wanted. She believed it was an impossible expectation that was bound to set someone up for heartbreak, and Thomas gleaned that her marriage had taught her that.\n\n\nThomas asked if Caroline was getting ninety-nine percent of what she wanted, which was the least of what she deserved. Caroline admitted that there was one thing that she and Ridge weren't on the same page about, but she didn't think she should discuss it with Thomas.\n\n\nThomas guessed it was about not starting a family. Caroline stated that Ridge wasn't ready yet. Thomas asked if it was a matter of being ready or being uninterested. She explained that Ridge wanted to just live in the moment. Thomas wondered where it left her. He sensed that she was doing all the sacrificing for Ridge's \"moments,\" but Thomas didn't want to see Caroline get hurt.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Liam was disillusioned by the video but still asserted that it was self-defense. Amazed, Ivy said that Aly had been just standing there, doing nothing, when Steffy had struck her. Letting Liam see the video again, Ivy stated that Steffy had killed Aly, and Steffy didn't even care.\n\n\nLater, Liam had gone, and Wyatt figured Liam was shocked and wondering why he was just then hearing about the video. Ivy said it was because Steffy was self-serving and clearly didn't trust or know Liam. Wyatt corrected that Ivy meant that Steffy didn't know Liam like Ivy did.\n\n\nExasperated, Ivy exclaimed, \"Oh, Wyatt, that's over! That's over!\" Ivy claimed that her focus was on the fact that it was as if Aly's life had meant nothing, but somehow Steffy's did. Ivy was curious about how the morally upright Liam felt about Steffy committing murder. Wyatt contended that Liam wasn't a saint, and rescuing the woman Liam loved trumped Liam's morals.\n\n\nIvy saw no way that Liam could condone what was on the video, and Wyatt figured that Ivy was counting upon it being that way. Wyatt felt bad for Liam. \"Well, I don't,\" Ivy snapped. Ivy felt that Liam should know that Steffy didn't walk on water and was a cold-blooded killer.\n\n\nWyatt said the statement was extreme. Ivy asserted that Steffy had stolen a life but continued to live with no consequences. Ivy said he could feel bad for Aly, who was gone but not forgotten.\n\n\nWyatt didn't want to spend the evening talking about other people. He told Ivy that she was sexy when she was angry, and they went to the bedroom to have sex.\n\n\nAfterward, Wyatt remarked that he liked \"this,\" and he liked Ivy -- even though she was a million miles away. Ivy apologized for slipping off, and he assumed she was thinking about what was happening with Steffy and Liam. Kissing Wyatt, she bet it was nothing like \"this.\"\n\n\nLater, Ivy was in bed, staring at the video. Wyatt entered and announced that she'd lost her phone privileges. He got her to put it down, and they began kissing.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam arrived, and Steffy asked if he'd seen the video. Liam was gravely silent, and she told him that he was freaking her out. He stated that he'd seen the video, and it was bad.\n\n\nSteffy didn't get what Liam was saying. Liam stated that it had been hard to watch. She didn't doubt it but claimed it was still self-defense. \"The way you hauled off and hit her with that tire iron...\" Liam remarked. Steffy described Aly swinging with a tire iron and then grabbing a rock. Liam interrupted to say that there was no rock, and confused, she asked what he meant.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that there had been a rock in Aly's hand, and Aly had been poised to crash it over Steffy's head. Liam said whether it had been a tire iron or a rock, it didn't look good, and Steffy had to take him through the events of that night one more time. He explained that her memory was returning gradually, and a new detail might emerge if she went over it again.\n\n\nSteffy did not want to relive it, but with more encouragement, she told Liam that out of nowhere, she'd gotten a flat tire. When she'd gotten ready to change it, out of nowhere, a car's headlights had headed toward her. She said it had been Aly, and they'd started to argue. Out of nowhere, Aly had grabbed a tire iron to attack Steffy.\n\n\n\"Now, when did she pick up the rock? Is that when she picked up the rock?\" Liam asked. Steffy said it was, and he asked what hand it had been in. She explained that Aly had held the rock in her right hand and had been about to crash it on top of Steffy. Steffy had taken the tire iron and swung to protect herself, and that had been when Aly had fallen and hit her head on the rock.\n\n\nSteffy didn't have all the bits and pieces but swore she wouldn't intentionally kill her cousin. She wept, saying she'd understand if Liam wanted to leave her. Surprised, Liam said he knew Steffy and knew that she'd defend herself when she was threatened. Relieved that he still believed her, even after seeing the video, Steffy began kissing Liam.\n\n\nIn bed together later, Steffy was grateful that Liam believed her. Liam said that Ivy and Liam were lashing out because Liam and Steffy hadn't chosen to be with them. Steffy said she should have told Liam when she'd remembered.\n\n\nLiam didn't care what the video showed, and he refused to let the bitter Ivy use the video to hurt Steffy. He recognized that it was a serious issue and that they had to do whatever it took to keep anyone else from seeing the video.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy tells Liam that he has seen it for himself. He has seen the video and it was murder. Steffy can cry self defense all she wants, but Aly was just standing there doing nothing and Steffy tried to kill her. She tried to kill her and doesn't even care. Liam disagrees. Caroline is aghast that Thomas is saying the night was videoed by Ivy and the interpretation is open for discussion. But he is not going to let his sister get railroaded for something she did not do intentionally. There was a tire iron and Steffy used that in her defense. Also a rock was involved and Aly fell and hit her head on. And isn't it rich that Ivy now wants to be the new face of FC. Thomas warns Caroline to keep this to herself, but especially not to tell his father. And Steffy is not the only woman he is worried about. There is Caroline too because she is with his father. He's not cynic but has had a front row seat most of his life with the way his father operates around women. Katie tells Ridge that she is not surprised that he wants Caroline. She is young and beautiful and certainly in love with him. But she knows she wants children so how is Ridge going to be with that. He says they are just now starting their life together and maybe she will not want to give up all of that to start a family. Katie is not sure she will outgrow that desire. Thomas tells Caroline that he confided in her, now she can return the favor. Is she completely happy with his dad. She tries to skirt around it but he pushes and he finally asks if she wants to start a family and perhaps his dad doesn't. He hates to see his dad put her on the spot. He is sure his dad does not want another family and he does not want to see her being hurt because of that. Ivy tells Wyatt that she is glad that Liam has now seen the video as now maybe he will see Steffy in a brand new light. She knows Steffy committed murder and Steffy knows it. She does not think there is any way that Liam can condone what he saw. It is criminal and Steffy should feel responsible. Steffy is on eggshells until Liam comes in. She is glad he saw the video and it will show her defending herself. He doesn't speak for a minute but then says it is really bad. Steffy goes over the details again. He tells her there is no rock shown. With just the tire iron it looks bad. She does not know how that could be. Liam says she needs to rethink this and tell everyone what really happened. Wyatt and Ivy lay in bed, Liam and Steffy do the same. He says Wyatt and Ivy are not objective and they are just lashing out, but they have the video now to contend with. Steffy says she is so appreciative that Liam believes her. She realizes Ivy could hurt her in trying to get justice for Aly. He says he will not let Ivy get back at her because she is mad at Steffy. This is a very serious matter. He believes her and will not leave her. He laments that no matter what it takes he needs to make sure no one sees that video. Wyatt jokingly tells Ivy to put that phone down. They are not going to concentrate on that now.",
