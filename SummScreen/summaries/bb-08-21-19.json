    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge is adamant that Thomas needs to be cleared. He was not involved in Emma's accident. The Sgt. says his office has added information that he was seen and it's unusual but Thomas has not bothered to explain. Ridge says his son has had some issues in the past but the Sgt. cannot call him a murderer. Brooke speaks up and says she is concerned with Thomas too since he has vanished and won't come forward. Under questioning Brooke admits they both are afraid Thomas could be dangerous. Yet Ridge claps back the Sgt. is only going on speculation. Sgt. Sanchez says if Thomas has done nothing wrong then they have nothing to worry about. So just call him when Thomas reappears. Brooke tells Ridge this is really strange behavior that Thomas does not get back to them. She needs to know that he is not going to be a threat to her daughter. Justin tells Hope and Liam that he will get the annulment papers started and done properly. He is sorry for what they went through but looks happily for what lays ahead. Liam tells Hope they have no idea how Thomas will react when he hears about the annulment papers. He will try to see her again. He will not give up without a fight; he is not a rational person. The minute he finds out she is ending the marriage could send him over the edge. Thomas is still on a quiet rampage. He needs to see Hope and explain to her. And it cannot be on the phone. He needs to see her in person. It's all Liam's fault. He is filling her head with a lot of lies and nonsense. But Hope is still his wife and that will never change. Vinny tries to get him to calm down and just work on calling Hope until she picks up her phone. Brooke tells Ridge that Thomas should have checked up on Douglas so that alone is strange. Ridge says he admits Thomas screwed up but he is trying to do something about that. Brooke says she knows Thomas and his lies and manipulations and she is very worried for her daughter's safety. No telling what he will do when he finds out that Hope regrets marrying him and is fixing that now .what he might do. Liam goes berserk when Hope says she is going to call Thomas and tell him it is over and about the annulment papers. Liam says that is Justin's job, not hers. She wants it to be over quickly. Thomas keeps on talking to himself that everything he has done, he has done for Hope and their family. They were happy and they will be again as soon as he explains. Brooke keeps harping to Ridge to try again and again to reach Thomas. She knows he will eventually pick up. Liam tries to take the phone from Hope but she insists. She is going to call Thomas. Thomas is ecstatic when her call comes through. He keeps calling her his wife and that he needs to see her. She cuts to the chase and says she only called to tell him she has seen a lawyer and is drawing up annulment papers. He tries to talk her out of it. She says no. She tells him to just go home and face his family. And he needs to see Douglas as he still thinks his dad is mad at him. And the last thing she tells him she does not want to speak to him again EVER! She hangs up on him. Moody Thomas stands and says they were married until death do they part.",
