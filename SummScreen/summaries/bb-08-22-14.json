Standing behind Hope, Wyatt thanked Liam -- and everyone else -- for being at the celebration.\n\n\nBill remarked that an easy elopement was the way to go, and he glanced at Brooke. The humored Wyatt cooed that nothing marked success like proposing after a winning photo shoot. Rick stated that the press had lapped it up, and Quinn asked why Hope wasn't wearing the jewel.\n\n\nHope said she'd accepted the diamond for the line, not herself. She explained that the stone was in Paris, on display, and would tour around Europe. Brooke and Liam seemed to resist the urge to cringe as Quinn hoped the diamond created as much success for the line as it had Hope's relationship.\n\n\nLater, everyone conversed in groups, and Wyatt approached Hope. As Hope observed Bill, Ivy, and Liam talking together, Wyatt suggested that he and Hope mingle and give the people what they wanted.\n\n\nBrooke approached to hug the two and welcome Wyatt to the family. Donna and Katie gave their well-wishes and warned Wyatt that they'd watch him to make sure he kept Hope happy.\n\n\nHope and Wyatt strolled over to Deacon, who couldn't believe that, at the very time he'd made his way back into Hope's life, she'd gotten a husband. Hope replied that, married or not, a girl would always need her dad, and the father and daughter hugged.\n\n\nWyatt noticed that Rick needed rescuing from Maya. Hope and Wyatt interrupted Maya's conversation with Rick, and Hope asked where Caroline was. Rick said his wife was visiting her mothers. Hope and Wyatt left to find Quinn, and Maya told Rick not to rush to look at her photos. She was sure he'd be busy with his wife out of town.\n\n\nWyatt and Hope found Quinn on the terrace. Quinn offered to leave the party to make everyone comfortable, but Hope said it was a family party. Quinn promised to be a good mother-in-law, and touching Hope's arm, Quinn stated that Quinn had a whole new life ahead of her.\n\n\nBill interrupted and sent Wyatt and Hope inside for Brooke's toast. When Bill turned to follow them, Quinn touched his arm and said she wouldn't bite -- unless he wanted it. Bill stated that he was tolerating her for their son's sake, and he strode inside, where Brooke gathered everyone for a toast.\n\n\nBrooke toasted to her daughter and the man who'd whisked Hope away from the Eiffel Tower to make her his bride. As glasses clinked, Ivy and Liam didn't toast. Ivy whispered to Liam that he had to tell Hope that he'd tried to meet her in Paris.\n\n\nRick and Eric congratulated Wyatt and Hope on their success. \"You mean the photo shoot or the wedding?\" Wyatt asked. Rick claimed that the social media campaign had been a hit, and Wyatt and Hope and the line were trending.\n\n\nMaya tapped Rick's shoulder, and he turned from his conversation. Maya remarked that Caroline had left him all alone, but he said he had plenty of company with Aly, Ivy, and his father across the courtyard in the main house. Maya asked when Caroline would be back. Rick replied that Maya's engagement not lasting didn't mean the rest of them weren't happy with who they were with. He walked off, and Maya scoffed, \"Whatever...\"\n\n\nWyatt approached Liam and said Bill shouldn't have put Liam on the spot earlier. Wyatt felt that it was enough that Liam was there. Wyatt figured that it had to be a relief to Liam that the back-and-forth had ended and Hope had made a decision. He hoped Liam could accept it and one day support it.\n\n\nLiam said nothing, and Wyatt turned to the others in the room to make his own toast. Hope joined him, and he thanked everyone for putting aside their differences to be there. Wyatt claimed that the marriage united them, and he thanked Hope for choosing to spend her life with him.\n\n\nHope said it was exactly how she'd envisioned beginning a marriage -- with family and friends. She thanked everyone for their support. Aly and Oliver tried not to frown, and across the room, Ivy insisted that Liam tell Hope that he'd been in Paris.\n\n\nDeacon watched Brooke hug Hope, and he flashed back to telling the sobbing Brooke that he'd be there for her and their unborn baby. In the flashback, Brooke told him that she'd give anything for a life with him. He'd responded that she didn't have to give anything; it was right there for the taking.\n\n\nDeacon whispered to Quinn that he knew he could make Brooke happier than the self-indulgent Bill. Observing Wyatt, Hope, Brooke, and Bill laughing together across the room, Quinn said Brooke and Bill would be together if Deacon didn't stop it \"now.\"\n\n\nNearby, Ridge and Katie were also watching Brooke and Bill. Katie snickered that Brooke had forgiven Bill. Ridge replied that it couldn't happen because he didn't want Bill around Brooke or his son. Katie said that if Ridge didn't want that, then he'd tell Brooke the truth about his design issues.\n\n\nBrooke went to the kitchen, and Deacon followed her there to ask if she'd forgiven Bill. Brooke said Deacon had to have seen it going that way. She felt that Bill had made some mistakes, but he was changing. Deacon declared that Bill was still hurting people that she loved.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that Bill had changed, and she'd forgive him for his past deeds. Deacon asserted that Ridge didn't want her to know that he'd been hurt worse by Bill's last deed than he'd let on. Brooke didn't know what Deacon was talking about, so he asked how Ridge's designs were going.\n\n\nBrooke said Ridge was rolling out a new couture line. Deacon asked if she'd seen the drawings, but she wasn't sure she had. He said it was because the designs didn't exist, and Ridge was pretending to design when, in truth, something about hitting the water had incapacitated his ability to do so.\n\n\nBrooke didn't believe it, but Deacon told her to ask Ridge herself. \"The greatest passion in his life -- Bill took it from him!\" Deacon accused.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was alone when Ridge entered. He'd wondered where \"Logan\" had gone off to. Brooke relayed that she'd been disturbed by something she'd just heard about his fall, and she asked if he was okay. He said that he was, and when she asked if he'd recovered, he said he had. She asked if he could draw, and he asked what kind of question that was.\n\n\nBrooke pondered the notion that Bill had \"taken\" the drawing ability from Ridge. When she looked into Ridge's eyes, she gasped at the realization in them and cupped his face.\n\n\nBack at the party, Quinn approached Bill to discuss how proud she was of the son they'd created. \"In spite of being raised by you, he turned out all right,\" Bill responded, and she chuckled.\n\n\nQuinn said she cared about Bill, and Bill drew in a frustrated breath. She added that it wasn't all hearts and flowers, but she'd do anything for him. Bill told her not to let the celebration for Hope and Wyatt delude her, and Bill ordered her to accept that his life was with Brooke.\n\n\nOn the sofa, Ivy, Hope, and Aly sat, listening to Carter joke that the officiating sea captain had been a hack, and Carter would have done a better ceremony. He told Hope to go with him the next time, but she replied that there wouldn't be a next time. He asked to see wedding pictures, and Hope hopped up to retrieve her phone from upstairs.\n\n\nIvy and Aly rushed over to tell Liam that Hope was upstairs, and they'd distract Wyatt while Liam went up there to talk to Hope. Liam raced up the steps, and the ladies sat down with Wyatt, claiming to want all the details about the press conference, the photo shoot, and the wedding.\n\n\n\"And the honeymoon,\" Aly dreamily added. Wyatt's brow crinkled with suspicion. He said he'd tell them all about it, but first, he had to find Hope.\n\n\nUpstairs, Hope located her phone. Behind her, Liam entered and closed the door. She told him that he shouldn't be there. \"You shouldn't be married,\" he responded. Hope said Liam had no right to tell her who to marry because he hadn't been there to meet her in Paris.\n\n\nLiam replied that he couldn't imagine what it had been like for Hope, and she readily responded that it had been humiliating. \"When that clock struck three, I thought for sure that you'd be there. I waited for you. I looked for you. I made excuses for you. But, no, I really didn't expect to be let down like that,\" she tearfully told him.\n\n\n\"I was there,\" Liam bit out. Hope asked him what he'd just said, and he replied that he'd been on the bridge. Hope insisted that he hadn't been there, but Liam asserted that he'd flown to Paris, just as they'd planned. \"I was there to make you my wife,\" he informed her. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Despite the celebratory theme of the occasion, not everyone is having a good time at Brooke\u2019s party. Ivy applies pressure on Liam to tell Hope the truth about what happened between them in Paris. Rick insists that Maya stop her attempt to pursue him because he is in a happy and committed marriage with Caroline. Deacon does what Ridge cannot.",
    "imdb": "\nDeacon divulges information to Brooke which he Hopes will skew her opinion of Bill.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tells Liam to go ahead and toast the new bride. Liam, obviously, very annoyed marches past Hope and goes straight to Bill across the room and stands there as if to defy him. Bill says again that he can do this. Liam turns around but still can not say a word. Finally Wyatt speaks up and says he is glad he came ..everyone is. Rick says Wyatt and Hope were a huge success along with the diamond in Paris. Quinn says Hope is not wearing the diamond. Hope tells them no, she accepted it for the line not for herself and it is in Paris right now and will make the rounds in Europe before coming back to the boutique. Quinn makes a toast and says she hopes it brings as much success to her line as it did to her personal relationship. Brooke tells Hope again how happy she is for them and welcomes Wyatt into the family He gives her a kiss on the cheek. The other Logan sisters, Katie and Donna, come over also to congratulate them. They tell Wyatt he better be on his toes as they will be watching to see if he is the ideal husband. Hope thanks her mother for inviting Deacon. Brooke says she knew she would want him here. Hope goes toward Deacon and he welcomes Wyatt. He says he can't believe he is just coming back into her life and now she goes and gets a husband. Hope tells him how much it means to have him here. A girl always needs her dad. He gives her a hug. Wyatt says he should go see his mother. Quinn tells them that she can go if it makes them uncomfortable. Hope says no, this is an entire family party, she is welcome. Quinn says she has been working very hard and she is going to be a great mother-in-law. Bill interrupts and tells them that Brooke wants to make a toast. As he walks off, Quinn touches him on the arm and says she won't bite . unless he wants her to. He lets her know that he is only tolerating her. With Liam looking on like a sick puppy, Brooke makes a glowing toast to the happy newlyweds. Ivy tells Liam that he has to tell Hope now. He looks at the happy couple beaming at each other and that pretty well seals the deal. Maya seeks out Rick a few times and asks how it is being alone with his wife away. Finally he tells her just because things did not work out with her and Carter doesn't mean the rest of them are unhappy who they are with. Guess that told her off! Wyatt comes up to Liam ad says their dad should not have put him on the spot like that, so he just wants to thank him for even coming. Wyatt says it is sort of a relief without all the back and forth and now that Hope is his wife he hopes Liam can accept it and someday even support it. Liam doesn't say a word and Ivy doesn't take her eye off of Liam. Wyatt asks everyone to raise their glasses again and he'd like to thank him for putting aside their differences today for them and how much that means to him. It has brought them all together and that is something that Hope is so good at. He gives a toast to Hope for choosing to spend a life with him. Again Liam and Ivy just glare. Hope says she wants to say this is exactly how she pictured starting her marriage with friends and family. Quinn catches Deacon looking at Brooke and sidles up to him and says he needs to put a stop to her and Bill right now. Katie tells Ridge that it looks like Brooke has forgiven Bill again. Maybe she wouldn't if she knew Ridge could not draw anymore so he needs to tell her. Deacon finds Brooke in the kitchen and says he can't believe she is still with Bill. She says it should not surprise him. They were almost married once and he is trying to change. Deacon says that is not true. There is something she needs to know. Bill is still hurting people that she loves. Brooke won't listen until Deacon lays it on the line. Something happened more than Ridge just falling into the water. He can no longer draw. There won't be any more designs. The greatest passion this man has in his life is completely gone. Carter asks Hope if she has any pictures. She says yes but they are upstairs on her phone. She will go get them. Ivy and Aly take this opportunity to corner a moping Liam and tells him now is his chance to find Hope alone. They will keep Wyatt occupied and distract him. Liam takes off upstairs like a bullet. Wyatt is a little suspicious or surprised when Aly and Ivy sit by him and want to hear everything about the photo shoot, the wedding and even the honeymoon. Hope picks up her phone and Liam walks in and closes the door. She turns around and says he should not be here. He grins and says she should not be married. Quinn tells Bill that she is so proud of her son and to think they created him years ago. Bill says and despite that he turned out all right. She says she does not have pink hearts coming out of her eyes but she does care for him and there is nothing she would not do for him. He tells her do not let this little family get together fool her, Brooke is the only woman for him so accept it. His life is with Brooke. Ridge finds Brooke still in the kitchen and asks if she is all right. She says not really. She just heard something ridiculous. She can not believe he lost his ability to design. He wants to know who told her that. She tears up when she realizes it is true and Bill took that away from him. Hope tells Liam that she doesn't know why he can say that to her. She was there, she waited for him and he wasn't there. So he really doesn't get to tell her who she should marry. She says it was humiliating. When that clock struck 3 o'clock, she looked for him, she waited for him, she made excuses for him and she really didn't expect to be let down like that. He thinks about it for a minute and finally says he was there. He was on the bridge and saw her. She says no, he was not there. He says he was there. He flew to Paris just as they planned to make her his wife. She shakes her head. She is dumbstruck.",
