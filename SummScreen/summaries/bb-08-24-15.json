Quinn suggested that they look at it from a different perspective, and Ivy suggested that Quinn stop critiquing as if Ivy was her flunky. \"Excuse me?\" Quinn said.\n\n\nIvy touted that she'd taken over the line when Quinn had been fired, and though Ridge had kept Quinn on, Ivy wouldn't back down to Quinn. A text message from Ridge about a meeting interrupted Ivy. Quinn asked where and when the meeting would be. \"Did I say you were included?\" Ivy quipped.\n\n\nWyatt hopped from his seat across the room and asked if it was the modeling decision. Quinn guessed the rumors were true about the new modeling position but laughed at the thought of Ivy as a candidate. Ivy replied that she had modeling experience. Quinn said Steffy had all \"that experience, not to mention, she's hot.\" Ivy asked what was wrong with the way she looked.\n\n\nWyatt intervened to explain that Ivy had attributes, and she wasn't the center of reporters' interest in Aly's death. Ivy assured Quinn that modeling wouldn't take Ivy away from the jewelry, and if anything, it would make her more hands on. Quinn scowled.\n\n\n\"If looks could maim,\" Deacon joked, entering. Ivy said Quinn was all his, and Ivy and Wyatt left.\n\n\nDeacon noted that someone seemed superior. Quinn remembered that the \"prima donna from Down Under\" used to be nice and easy to manipulate. Deacon reminded Quinn that Ivy had lost her cousin, but Quinn said it didn't give Ivy the right to rip Quinn's head off.\n\n\nDeacon suggested that Quinn take the problem to Ridge. Quinn asked if she was supposed to tell Ridge that Ivy was living up to her new nickname, \"Poison Ivy.\"\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Steffy thanked Liam for believing her about the incident, even though she was sure Ivy expected him to turn his back on Steffy. He stated that Ivy wasn't herself. Steffy replied that there was no excuse for blackmail. Steffy had already racked her brain enough about remembering the incident, what impact her actions would have on the family, and if there would be a trial, and she refused to let Ivy control her life. Liam said they didn't know if it was Steffy striking Aly or the fall that had caused Aly's death.\n\n\nRidge entered, interrupting to start his meeting. Thomas arrived, and Ivy and Wyatt entered. Ridge announced that even though he appreciated Ivy throwing her hat into the ring, Steffy would be the new face of Forrester. The looks around the table grew grave.\n\n\nWyatt asked if the decision was final, and Liam said it was. Wyatt grew snippy about Liam answering for the CEO. Wyatt discussed the press and its interest in Aly's death. \"Wyatt!\" Ridge yelled. More quietly, Ridge said Steffy knew how to deal with the press and had done it for years. Wyatt replied that it was different. Ridge asked how, and Wyatt looked at Ivy.\n\n\nRidge asked if Ivy had something to say. Ivy stated that he was making a bad decision, and it was one he'd regret. Steffy asked to speak to Ivy alone, and the men left the room.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Liam, Ridge, and Thomas met. Thomas wondered if they should have left the women alone, and Ridge asked if there was something they knew that he didn't.\n\n\nLiam nervously left the table but listened nearby as Thomas said he'd been looking out for his sister when he'd been concerned about her taking the job. Ridge declared that Steffy was the new model, and he expected Ivy and Thomas to support the choice.\n\n\nRidge left, and Thomas and Liam exchanged looks. Thomas figured that Liam had seen the video. The men were concerned that Ivy would make good on her threat. Thomas asked how they'd stop her.\n\n\nLater, in Rick's old office, Deacon was massaging Quinn's feet as she worked. Wyatt walked in and was grossed out by what he saw. Quinn asked about the meeting, and Wyatt explained that the underdogs had lost again. Quinn asked where Ivy was. Wyatt said Steffy was talking to Ivy, and he doubted Ivy would back down without a fight.\n\n\nDeacon didn't see what Ivy had to fight with. Wyatt hinted that they'd be surprised. Quinn asked what was going on. She suspected something was happening between Wyatt and Ivy. \"Girlfriend,\" Deacon coughed. Wyatt admitted that he and Ivy might be dating, and she might be his girlfriend. \"Whatever she is to you, you'd better reign her in -- or I'm gonna do it for you,\" Quinn asserted.\n\n\nWyatt said that Quinn didn't want to be on Ivy's bad side. \"Are you serious? Who are you talking to?\" Quinn asked. Noting that Ivy was making demands and getting all uppity, Quinn asked if he'd heard how Ivy had spoken to her earlier. Wyatt claimed that Ivy just wanted respect as a designer. Quinn said she did respect Ivy, mostly, but Quinn had a lot more experience.\n\n\nDeacon recommended that Ivy chill out a little bit, especially if she was becoming Wyatt's girlfriend. Wyatt said he'd talk to Ivy, but Ivy was dealing with a lot. Wyatt thought Ivy might wind up with the promotion, but if she didn't, then the chips would fall where they would.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Ivy didn't know why she'd let herself believe things would turn out differently. Steffy said she was sorry, but Ivy replied that it was just another thing Steffy had taken from Ivy. Steffy asked Ivy to listen, but Ivy thought that, unless Steffy was turning herself in, it was a waste of time. Steffy said that Aly was gone, and the family would never be the same.\n\n\n\"What you are doing right now -- \" Steffy said. Ivy interjected that she was holding Steffy accountable, probably for the first time in Steffy's life, and all Steffy was trying to do was to save herself. Steffy claimed not to be doing it but noted that Ivy was using their dead cousin to get ahead as a model.\n\n\nIvy believed Steffy was just making a show of reaching out for Liam's sake. Ivy said that Steffy had taken Liam, Aly, and the job, but Steffy wasn't going to get away with it anymore.\n\n\nSteffy took it as another threat, and Ivy said Steffy shouldn't have accepted the position. Steffy said she hadn't accepted, but \"if you keep this up --\"\n\n\nIvy asked who was threatening whom. Steffy said she wasn't a monster, and though Steffy had to live with what had happened to Aly, Steffy wouldn't let Ivy blackmail her. Ivy said it was justice for Aly, and Ivy had the video to prove what Steffy had done.\n\n\nSteffy asked to see the video. Ivy played it, and Steffy shook her head in disbelief. Ivy said that there was no rock, as Steffy claimed, and Steffy had attacked Aly -- not the other way around. Ivy asked if Steffy wanted the world to see that she'd killed her cousin.\n\n\nRidge arrived, and Ivy put away her phone. Ridge asked talk to Steffy, but Ivy said she and Steffy were in the middle of replaying what had happened. Steffy told Ridge that she wanted Ivy to be the face of Forrester, and Steffy would concentrate on being the president.\n\n\nRidge was disconcerted by the change, and Steffy said she'd changed her mind. He asked why. Steffy said she had enough on her plate, and she couldn't keep adding more. Ridge asked if she was sure, and Steffy said that she was.\n\n\nRidge left, and Ivy remarked that Aly would be glad that Steffy wasn't getting her way. Steffy replied that Aly had had issues; and Steffy was beginning to wonder if Ivy did, too. Ivy asserted that she had a video that would convince a jury that Steffy was a murderer. Ivy believed that she'd been too nice for too long. \"Don't mess with me. As long as I'm around here, I own you,\" Ivy declared.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam says he does not believe for a moment that it did not happen the way Steffy said, but the video does not show the rock at all. Steffy says there is no excuse for blackmail. She did not kill Aly on purpose yet that is what Ivy is doing. Steffy says she does not care about the video anymore, let the chips fall where they may. She will not let Ivy control her life. Ridge walks in and wants to know what is happening. Ivy has issues with Quinn as she feels she is trying to give instructions as her boss. Ivy reminds her that Quinn was fired and Ivy took over only for Quinn to be re-instated again. Wyatt fills Quinn in that it is now face of Forrester between Ivy and Steffy. Quinn says she would pick Steffy with all her experience. Wyatt says Ivy to keep Steffy out of the limelight with the police investigation. Deacon walks in and hears the racket too and wants to know what is happening. Ivy and Thomas join the meeting and Liam assumes he has been called in on this too. Ridge says they need to choose the new face of FC. He appreciates Ivy stepping up to help while Maya is on honeymoon but he is going to choose Steffy. Wyatt tells him that the press is not just going away. Ridge says he knows, but Steffy knows how to handle the press. Ivy says she thinks Ridge is making a big mistake, one that he will regret. Steffy wishes to speak to Ivy alone. Quinn fills Deacon in on the prima donna from down under. She remembers when she was really nice. She only asked her to tweak a few pieces and she totally blew a gasket. Ivy says surprise, surprise. Ridge chose his daughter over her, just another thing that Steffy took away from her. She says she wants justice for Aly while Steffy is just helping herself. Steffy says no, Ivy is using Aly now to take over more of the company. Ivy tells her she is not going to get away with this anymore .first Liam, then the face of FC and does not want to be held responsible even for Aly's death ..no more. Wyatt tells his mom and Deacon that Ivy is not going down without a fight. Ridge will also be surprised. Quinn tells Wyatt that he better reign his girlfriend in or she will do it for him. Ridge tells Thomas that Steffy is the new face and he expects him and Ivy to support that. Steffy says she will regret all of this the rest of her life but she will not let Ivy blackmail her, she wants to see the video. When she does, Ivy points out there is no rock, she attacked Aly and killed her. Thomas tells Liam they have to stop Ivy, but how? Ridge comes in and Steffy says she has changed her mind. She thinks Ivy should be the new face. She has enough on her plate and can not add any more. Ivy looks pleased. Wyatt tells his mom that she does not want to get on Ivy's bad side now, she is over-reacting. They all need to chill out right now. And let the chips fall. Steffy tells Ivy she is not judge and jury. Ivy says the video shows she is a murderer and as long as she is around here, she owns her.",
