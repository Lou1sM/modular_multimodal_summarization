Insisting that she does not want her son to lose his marriage, Quinn is confident that Steffy will listen to Eric. With his sister staying at his loft, Thomas decides to meddle and arranges for Liam to run into Steffy. Liam then encourages Steffy to end her marriage and come back to him. Ridge joins Brooke for coffee to inform her that he had to move out of the Mansion to make room for Eric and Quinn. Rick and Maya enter the kitchen and are taken aback by the closeness that Brooke and Ridge have renewed. Rick and Ridge quickly realize that the concern for Eric makes them allies for a chance.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge shows up at Brooke's in time for breakfast. He says hotel life is terrible. Brooke was sure that Eric would apologize and invite him back home. Eric comes downstairs and asks Quinn if she has had second thoughts in the cold hard light of day. She says she has always done as she pleased so she is surprised to say that she does care what his family thinks and does not want to cause this problem. He says they can choose to be happy or not and make everyone else happy. Suffering is not a vitamin. He does not want her to walk away. There is a knock at the door and Quinn gets it. Wyatt walks in with a bag and says she does not live here, she is not staying, so pack up her bag to go. Steffy hugs Thomas and thanks him for letting her stay with him for the night. Liam calls as he forgot his work keys there last night. Thomas seizes the opportunity and invites him to come right over. Rick and Maya are both surprised when they walk in and find Ridge helping himself to breakfast. They even notice the bag in the den and wonder if he is moving back in. Shocked would be the word when they find he lost his home to Quinn. Quinn tells Wyatt to stop; she is not leaving. It is Steffy that is stalking her not the other way around. He says this is not negotiable; he will not lose Steffy. She says this can work. Any time Steffy wants to come see Eric then she will leave. Wyatt says he has had a lifetime of this and he is done. Eric comes back in and tells Wyatt to lay off or he will have him arrested and don't think he won't do it. Quinn is not going anywhere. Wyatt says his marriage should not suffer because of them .or more importantly Quinn. He says Quinn owes him on this, all the years of interference he had to run for her as he would come home and not know what he would run into. Now for the first time in his life he has someone in his life he can love and trust. So that is why he is going to get Quinn out of here. He tells Quinn if she loves him then she can prove it. Eric says if Wyatt guilts Quinn into leaving he will just come and get her again. If Steffy leaves him he cannot stop that but he will talk to her. He will get through to her and it will not be Wyatt or Steffy that dictates how he and Quinn live. Ridge tells them they do not know just how much influence Quinn has over Eric but they do know the power that Eric has over the company so they have to protect that. Liam is surprised to find Steffy and when she tells him she is moving in with Thomas for now. He says the craziest thing about Quinn is that she will move heaven and earth to get what she wants and did that to get Steffy and Wyatt together and now she will give him up so easily. He says this move is good; it is a move in the right direction. And he will be here for her, waiting for them to pick up right where they left off.",
