    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley saw Sally pondering designs and warned her not to change a thing because Saul was poring over his work in the cutting room and would lose his mind if Sally changed a button. Sally didn't intend to change anything because Jarrett had liked her designs as they were.\n\n\nShirley was proud of Sally, but Sally said she hadn't done it on her own. Shirley responded that Mr. Muscles had had nothing to do with the work, and it had been all Sally. Grinning, Sally conveyed that she was actually beginning to think that they could do it. Sally was worried because the Spencer journalist had only seen a sampling, and positive feedback didn't pay the bills.\n\n\nSally said they needed orders and lots of them. Shirley was sure they'd get them. Things weren't happening the way Sally had expected, but she hoped that with no tricks or stunts, Bill and Steffy would finally see them as a legitimate fashion house.\n\n\nLater, Pete, the handyman, arrived to check Sally's plug. As he checked it, he asked how much they'd had plugged in. Shirley said it had just been a boom box, but Darlita added that her plug looked like an octopus. Sally relayed that the building was super old, and she had no idea what was going on in the walls. Shirley said the last thing they needed was people talking about another disaster at Spectra Fashions.\n\n\nShirley wanted it fixed pronto, so the showing wouldn't be littered with \"under construction\" signs. Pete said he wasn't an electrician, but it wouldn't happen Shirley's way because, in his opinion, the whole building needed to be rewired. Shirley retorted that he'd said he wasn't an electrician. He replied that she was going to need a good one.\n\n\nAs Pete left, Shirley asked about the plug. He told her not to use it. Pete left, and Sally said concentrating on the showing was how they'd fix the building and Spectra. She believed that Thomas had put them on the right path. They just had to take it from there and make it a success. Once they had the money, they'd update the building with the latest technology. She declared that they had a future, and Spectra was there to stay.\n\n\nLater, Sally, Shirley, and Darlita went over show details, and Sally was happy no one had canceled. She wanted Jarrett in the front row. Sally thought they were ready, but Darlita said, \"Except for the designs.\" Shirley assured them that Saul wouldn't let them down.\n\n\nSally was grateful for her team. When Thomas had left, she'd had a moment when she'd wondered how she'd do it on her own. She'd later realized that she wasn't alone. She had the most dedicated and loyal team in the business, and she believed they were doing it for themselves and for everyone who'd been told they weren't good enough.\n\n\n\"I am a Spectra. I've heard that my entire life. I'd heard it so much that I actually started to believe it -- even when I knew it was a lie. But not anymore. Not after this showing,\" Sally said. She vowed that she'd prove herself as a designer, and Spectra would rise again.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam asserted to Bill that they'd print the review \"as is.\" Jarrett stated that he hadn't written it yet, and Justin advised him to check the terms of his contract before he did. Liam replied that he'd been there, too. Jarrett believed that the collection would be successful. Bill reasoned that they'd do something about that. Liam stated that they wouldn't, and Bill had done enough as it was.\n\n\nJustin questioned how good the designs could be if Sally had done them. As they complimented Sally's work, Jarrett and Liam chuckled about it being electric. Bill asked if that was some kind of joke between the lovebirds and told them that he wasn't in a laughing mood. Jarrett revealed that there had been an electrical fire during the preview, but Liam had put it out quickly. \"So once again, Spectra Fashions avoids disaster,\" Bill grumbled.\n\n\nLater, Bill asked if Liam was sure he didn't want to run off and help his new best friend write the review. Liam thought Jarrett would be fine by himself. Bill noted that he didn't have to print it. \"But you will,\" Liam determined. Bill asked Justin if Marcus talked to his father that way. Liam hoped Marcus didn't have to and said it was a \"pain in the ass\" to be Bill's conscience.\n\n\n\"By the way, do you know what he told Thomas about Caroline?\" Liam asked. Bill said the subject was off-limits, but Liam could discuss the preview if he wanted. Liam claimed he wanted to tell Thomas the truth about Caroline not being sick. Bill interjected that if Thomas was only in New York for that reason, Liam would be right; however, the time had given Caroline and Thomas a chance to reconnect, and if Thomas was a better father for it, then Bill had nothing to feel sorry about. \"And neither do you,\" Bill added.\n\n\nLiam said Bill hadn't done what he'd done for Caroline and Douglas. Justin thought Liam had Bill there. Bill disagreed. Bill said he'd killed two birds with one stone, and Liam got to enjoy the spoils of it. Liam was adamant that the line wouldn't tank, and Spectra really could take off.\n\n\nBill conceded that if it happened, then he would have done what he could. In disbelief, Liam asked what Bill was saying. Bill said he'd been doing \"this\" a long time, and not every investment paid off. Justin and Liam exchanged quizzical glances. Bill said that if Caroline suddenly got better, Thomas could make up his own mind.\n\n\nLiam asked about Spectra being a success. Bill said that if it happened and if Thomas found his way back to Sally, Bill would wish them well. \"You will?\" Liam asked. Bill asked what he could do after Liam had ended the negative review that could have stopped the show. Bill felt that Liam had given Sally another chance, and Bill's hands were tied.\n\n\n\"You mean, no matter what happens?\" Liam asked. Bill replied that he'd deal with it. Gasping, Liam said he really wanted to believe his father. Bill told Liam to believe it and get back to work.\n\n\nLiam exited, and Justin asked Bill if he'd meant what he'd said. \"Hell, no,\" Bill replied.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy, Brooke, and Steffy set up for a working lunch, and Brooke told Steffy not to expect any family dinners anytime soon because Liam and Bill were butting heads about Spectra. Ivy was surprised that Sally had been confident enough to give Jarrett another preview and that \"Liam wanted to go along with it.\" Steffy wasn't surprised, and Brooke said Liam had been determined to give Spectra a fair shot. Steffy said that was her husband, a man who couldn't stand dishonesty of any kind.\n\n\nAs Ivy, Brooke, and Steffy ate, Steffy said she didn't care what Spectra showed, as long it wasn't Forrester's designs. Brooke said Sally had done the work herself. Ivy was surprised to hear that Thomas hadn't been involved and even more surprised that Brooke and Steffy didn't expect him to be at the show. Steffy said he was concentrating on his family, as he should be. Ivy thought the timing was weird and wondered what had happened to take his focus off Spectra.\n\n\nChecking online, Steffy said Jarrett hadn't posted anything yet. Ivy figured Jarrett had to eventually say something. Steffy quipped that Liam would make sure it was the truth. Brooke asked if Steffy would go to the show with Liam if he was invited. Steffy joked that she was sure Sally had a reserved seat for Steffy in the front row.\n\n\nIvy took that as a \"no\" from Steffy. Deciding not to unduly slam Sally, Steffy said she'd be impressed if Sally made it happen on her own, and Steffy acknowledged that a lot of obstacles had been thrown Sally's way. Brooke replied that Sally had made them on her own. Steffy admitted that it hadn't been that way for all of the problems, but one couldn't ignore Sally's tenacity. Steffy said that Sally Spectra didn't give up.\n\n\nLater, Steffy greeted Liam at the door of the CEO's office. She mentioned that she'd heard he'd gone to the Spectra showing, and she assumed he'd provided a buffer between Jarrett and Bill. Guessing that Bill had called Brooke to vent about it, Liam shrugged and said Sally's designs were good. Steffy asked if he thought Bill would interfere.\n\n\nLiam replied that Bill had said he wouldn't interfere. Steffy closed the door as Liam entered the office and said Bill wouldn't stop until he got what he wanted. Liam reasoned that a good businessman knew when to cut his loses. Steffy said that Bill didn't like to lose. Liam revealed that Bill had said he'd wish Sally well if the line was a success. Steffy blinked in response.\n\n\n\"I know! Exactly, right? That's the look I had on my face!\" Liam exclaimed. Liam relayed that he'd been skeptical, too, but Bill had said he'd just have to deal with it once people saw the collection. Liam really hoped Bill had been honest.\n\n\nSteffy asked about Thomas, and Liam suspected that Bill would let that situation play out, too. She asked how Liam felt about it. Liam didn't know and stated that Thomas seemed happy. Steffy agreed. She'd just received a message from her brother about how grateful he was for the time with his family. She thought Thomas might stay in New York, even if things changed between him and Caroline.\n\n\nLiam had thought Spectra wouldn't survive something like that, but he said Sally was doing it all on her own. Steffy replied that Sally should. Steffy didn't have a problem with competition or Sally, as long as Sally wasn't stealing designs or using Thomas to prop up her business. Steffy just couldn't forget what Sally had done to them.\n\n\nLiam couldn't help but root for Sally. Grasping her claws at air, Steffy said that was what Liam did -- root for the little guy. He replied that it was just one show, and either Sally would save the business or sink it. Steffy and Liam joked that Sally was scrappy. He said Sally was doing everything she could to prove herself, and he hoped she did it.\n\n\nBack at Spencer, Bill wondered what he had to do to put that low-rent rag shop out of business. He was frustrated with how many times Spectra had been pulled from the fire. Justin had thought it had been crazy to tell Thomas that Caroline was dying, but the closeness of the little family afterward had to count for something.\n\n\nBill ranted about C.J. turning down five million more dollars and caving to his mommy and conscience. Jason told Bill to forget Spectra and build his baby elsewhere. Bill refused, saying that just because he hadn't found a solution, it didn't meant one didn't exist. Bill urged Justin to think of something, anything to create a spark.\n\n\n\"A spark...a spark is dangerous, Bill,\" Justin said, adding that Bill could just ask Liam, who'd put out the fire at Spectra.\n\n\n\"I could kiss you right now,\" Bill said with a gleam in his eyes. \"Electrical issues. Now that's something I hadn't thought of.\"\n\n\nLooking at \"Sky,\" Bill admired her lines and said Spectra was a dump. In his eyes, \"Sky\" was the future. Justin stated that Jarrett thought Sally had talent. Bill replied that no one would see it, and the fashion show wouldn't happen. Bill had put off his dream long enough.\n\n\nBill intended to build an iconic structure that would change the skyline. The place would employ thousands and generate billions. He refused to let Spectra stand in the way. The Spectra building was falling down, and it had been vacant before Sally and her bozos had moved in.\n\n\n\"By this time next week, I'm going to be standing in that empty lot with a photographer and a gold-plated shovel. You know what needs to be done, Justin,\" Bill said.\n\n\n\"Oh, I know, Dollar Bill,\" Justin replied.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Sally and Shirley are optimistic that their new collection will help the Forresters and the rest of the fashion world realize that she is a legit designer. Darlita then brings in an electrician to look after the power outlet which threw sparks earlier. Pete's diagnosis is grim: the whole building needs to be rewired. This costly assessment does not break Sally's chipper mood because - after tomorrow's fashion show - they will likely be able to pay for the repairs. Brooke reveals to Steffy and Ivy that Liam and Jarrett seemed to enjoy Sally's preview, which irked Bill. Steffy explains that she does not care what Sally puts down the runway as long as it is not their designs. Liam and Jarrett give Bill a detailed report on the preview and the reporter inadvertently lets Bill know about the small electrical fire at Spectra Fashion. Justin is surprised how calm Bill reacts to Liam's insistence to write a favorable review about Sally's collection. Later, Bill expresses his anger to Justin who suggests building the Spencer skyscraper on another site. Bill nixes the idea and instead orders Justin to make sure that Sally's fashion show will never take place as the electrical issues will be the end of Spectra Fashion.",

Grams tells Sally not to change a thing. Saul has been working on all the details for days. Thomas had nothing to do with this collection, only her. Sally says she is beginning to think they might make it this time despite Steffy and her father-in-law. Liam tells his dad that if the Spectra collection is as good as the preview Sally will do fine. They laugh among themselves about the electrifying preview until Bill pulls it out of Liam and Jarrett that there was a small electrical fire in the wall socket. Justin asks Bill if he meant it when he said if Spectra does well and Thomas finds his way back to Sally then he will accept it. That is all he can do. Bill says hell no; he did not mean what he said to Liam. The electrician who really is not an electrician says Sally cannot use that plug. The entire building needs to be re-wired. Liam laments to Steffy that he and Jarrett agree - Sally has a shot. Steffy says Bill is not going to stop and he will not lose. Liam says well his dad says he will wish Sally well if this is a success. And she seems to be doing it. He more than sings her praises. Steffy says she does not have a problem with Sally as long as she leaves her brother alone and makes her success on her own. Bill wonders what he has to do to put that ragtag out of business. Bill grouses that he offered CJ $5 million dollars and what does he do but go crying to his mommy. Justin mentions Liam putting out the fire at Spectra and Bill says he could kiss him right now.

She worried if she could do this on her own when Thomas left, but says she has the most loyal and dedicated team in the business and they are doing this for all the people who have been pushed around. She is a Spectra and she has heard that her entire life until she started to believe it. But Spectra Fashions will rise again. Bill talks to Sky. That building is a dump and that fashion show is not going to happen. His dream will come true, one that will grace the skyline forever. Spectra Fashions and those Bozos who occupy it now are not going to stand in the way. This time next week he will be standing in that parking lot with a photographer and a gold shovel.
