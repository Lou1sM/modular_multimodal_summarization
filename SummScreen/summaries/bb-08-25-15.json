    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy and Steffy argued about what had happened with Aly. Steffy maintained that Aly had attacked her, and she defended herself. Ivy called Steffy a murderer. Ivy claimed she had proof on her phone that Steffy had murdered their cousin. \"Stop lying,\" Ivy seethed.\n\n\nSteffy wondered what more Ivy wanted. \"You're the new face of Forrester,\" Steffy said. Ivy said she owned Steffy and always would. Ivy insisted that Steffy had no conscience. Steffy argued that Aly would have killed her.\n\n\nIvy countered that Steffy had everything she wanted. She had taken Liam from Ivy and taken Aly's life. \"I had no choice,\" Steffy maintained. Ivy countered that Steffy no longer had a charmed life and had to accept some responsibility.\n\n\nSteffy was angry. \"You pulled over and recorded our fight. What does that say about you?\" Steffy asked. Ivy argued that there was no rock in the video to support Steffy's claim that Aly had been about to hit her with the rock.\n\n\nSteffy countered that there had been a rock, and she wanted Ivy to let Aly rest in peace. \"Let this go,\" Steffy begged. Ivy refused. \"I was there too,\" Ivy said. She maintained that she had watched the video numerous times and had never seen Steffy's version of the truth. Ivy chastised Steffy for making a fool of Ivy when Steffy had stolen Liam from her, and Ivy refused to allow Steffy to make a fool of her again.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Liam and Thomas discussed that Steffy had trouble dealing with Ivy. Liam maintained that Ivy was taking everything out on Steffy. Ridge interrupted and wondered why Steffy would have allowed Ivy to be the new face of Forrester. Ridge wondered what was wrong.\n\n\nLiam understood that Steffy had allowed Ivy to be the face of Forrester because Ivy had modeled in Amsterdam.\n\n\nRidge said it was out of character for Steffy to have turned down becoming the face of Forrester. Ridge insisted that something else was happening behind the scenes. \"What am I missing?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nThomas and Liam tried to get Ridge to stop worrying. Liam reminded Ridge that Steffy was trying to get along better with Ivy and have less drama at Forrester. Ridge agreed, but he wanted assurance that if something were wrong, Thomas would tell him. Thomas agreed. Ridge smiled, but he said he couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, and he was convinced that Liam and Thomas knew what it was. Ridge left.\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Liam discussed that she did not want her dad to know about the video. Liam understood, but he was tired of Ivy threatening Steffy. Steffy agreed, and she added that she had to live with what had happened -- a memory that would haunt her for the rest of her life.\n\n\nSteffy worried that she also had to live with Ivy calling her a murderer. Liam was livid. He refused to allow Ivy to control them. He knew that Steffy had done nothing wrong. He promised to put a stop to it immediately.\n\n\nAt Forrester, in Quinn's office, Quinn advised Wyatt to tell Ivy to watch her attitude. Wyatt thought it was funny that Quinn had accused Ivy of being mean and controlling. \"You're just not used to a woman standing up to you,\" he said.\n\n\nQuinn argued that she had been \"rather pleasant lately.\" Wyatt agreed, but he added there was always room for improvement. Quinn marveled that Wyatt had let Steffy slip away, and he'd hooked up with Ivy instead. Quinn maintained that Steffy was still available, and Wyatt refused to butt heads with Liam again. He said he was with Ivy.\n\n\nQuinn worried that Ivy was always barking at her. Wyatt reminded his mother that all of them had lost a relative in Aly. Ivy interrupted, and she hugged Wyatt. Ivy announced that she was the new face of Forrester. Ivy and Wyatt smiled and celebrated, but Quinn had a disapproving look in spite of her smile.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Ridge quizzed Steffy about letting go of becoming the face of Forrester. Steffy defended her decision. She said she didn't want the stress. She had the ordeal of Aly hanging over her head, and she had a lot of work as president. \"It was bad timing,\" Steffy maintained. Ridge wondered if there was another reason. Steffy said that she would never get over what had happened with Aly. Ridge hugged her.\n\n\nIn Ivy's office at Forrester, Ivy examined some sapphires with a magnifying glass, and Liam entered and congratulated because she had become the new face of Forrester. He noted that sapphires were a lot like Ivy: beautiful, brilliant, and precious.\n\n\nIvy countered that she had been all those things until Steffy had returned. Liam advised Ivy to stop blaming Steffy. Liam reasoned that he had made his own decisions. He reminded Ivy that their relationship had become complicated in a hurry due to a lot of reasons including her immigration issue.\n\n\nLiam said that he had seen a lot of changes in Ivy. She had been colder and darker than ever before, and he worried about the person she had become. Ivy warned that Liam wanted to justify Steffy's behavior by blaming Ivy. Liam disagreed. He said that Ivy had become unethical and self-serving.\n\n\nIvy shouted that Steffy had killed her cousin. Liam said that Ivy had used her video as a bargaining chip to advance her own career. He doubted that she was seeking justice for Aly but rather revenge.\n\n\nIvy said that Steffy was the guilty one. Liam angrily warned Ivy to stop tormenting Steffy. He admitted that he'd had it with her threats. He dared her to go to the police with the video or delete it and mourn Aly's death properly. \"No more threats, no more blackmail -- what's it gonna be, Ivy?\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy tells Steffy she had a choice. She had a choice that night when she murdered Aly. Stop lying about it, they have the proof on the video. She owns her now. And as long as this video exists she always will. Once again Steffy tries to convince her it was self defense but Ivy tells her that her charmed life is over. Liam tells Thomas that Ivy is blackmailing Steffy with the video, that is damning enough, but is not the whole story. Ridge walks up and tells them Steffy is insisting she give up the face of Forrester to Ivy. Thomas says it is not that big a deal. Wyatt tells Quinn that no woman has ever stood up to her like Ivy, but she needs to get over that. She can not even believe that he is now hooked up with Ivy and gave up on Steffy too soon. He needs to keep his dukes up and not throw in the towel so soon. Do not let Liam win all the time. She says where there is a will, there is a way. He deserves his moment. He says maybe he and Ivy will get their chance. They are taking things slow. She has a lot to handle with losing Aly so cut her some slack. It is getting hard losing to his brother. Thomas is sure Steffy has her reasons for turning down the face of Forrester job. Steffy says she did not want Aly to die and she reacted the same as Ivy would have. And what does that say about Ivy. She pulled over and only took a video instead of helping. Steffy tells her to let this go and let Aly rest in peace. Ivy says she has looked at the video over and over and not once has she seen Steffy's version. She has been played the fool too many times and she will not believe Steffy again. Ivy gloats to Wyatt and Quinn that she is the new face. She thinks that is amazing. Ridge feels something else is going on with Steffy and what is it with Ivy wanting to be the face. Thomas would tell him if he knew something. He thinks there is more to the story and he thinks Thomas knows what it is. Steffy confides in Liam that she can not tell her father, so she lets Ivy win. She would have been honored but she does not care about the job. Now Ivy is holding it over her head for the rest of her life. She has seen the video now and she knows how guilty she looks ..and now Ivy says she owns her. Liam says he is done, they will not let this go on. He charges out. Ridge finds Steffy and asks her the real reason. He's her dad and they have always been straight with each other. She says it is stressful and she does not need to stretch things. And Ivy is an okay choice. Aly's death devastated her and Ridge tells her not to blame herself. She says others are. This will haunt her for the rest of her life. Liam finds Ivy and congratulates her. He sees a sapphire and says he used to think of her that way, brilliant and bright .but then Steffy came back, and the immigration issue and it did change things ..the changes he has seen in her. Darker, and colder, Quinn must be rubbing off on her. Blackmail is not who she is. They all feel terrible but no more than Steffy and look how she is using her for a bargaining chip. Ivy says his girlfriend has to pay for this. It is not up to him. When he has heard enough he calls her bluff. He tells her fine, go to the police and let the secret out .or she can delete the video. It's her choice.",
