    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Wyatt's beach house, Brooke helped Hope move in. \"I can't believe that he was there,\" Hope lamented about Liam. Hope admitted to her mother that she was confused. Brooke noted that no one could have predicted what had happened. \"You married Wyatt,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nHope said it all messed with her head because she and Liam had so much history. Brooke wondered what Hope wanted to do, and Deacon entered and interrupted. Deacon delivered Hope's cat -- whom she and Liam had adopted from the shelter.\n\n\nHope was elated to see the cat, but Deacon sensed that something was wrong. Hope shared that there had been a misunderstanding about what had happened in Paris. She explained that Liam had been a hero -- a chivalrous hero who had rescued Ivy after she had fallen in the Seine. As a result, he had been late to meet Hope at the Eiffel Tower. \"I'm so proud of him. I was so lucky to have him in my life,\" Hope said.\n\n\nDeacon wondered if Hope wanted to change her mind, but Hope maintained that she had taken vows with Wyatt. She told Brooke and Deacon that she needed some time alone. Brooke and Deacon left.\n\n\nAt Quinn's place, Quinn reveled in Wyatt's success of marrying Hope, and she boasted that she had partied with the Forresters and fit in. Wyatt warned her not to be too hasty. He reminded her that she had only been invited because it was a wedding celebration. Quinn continued to celebrate and cheer Wyatt on for having won Hope. Wyatt confessed to Quinn that Liam had been in Paris, and Hope would have married him, but he had been late because he had rescued Ivy after she had been knocked into the river.\n\n\nWyatt quizzed his mother to ensure that she had not been responsible for anything that had delayed Liam. Quinn insisted she had done nothing. Quinn was irritated that Liam had shared his story with Hope at a party that celebrated Wyatt and Hope's wedding. Quinn smiled that her baby had gotten married on the Spencer yacht.\n\n\nWyatt warned that Quinn had to stay away from Liam and Hope. Wyatt added that he was still concerned about Ricardo's death, but Quinn insisted that she had done nothing wrong. Quinn said that the diamond had worked its magic and put Wyatt and Hope back together. Wyatt agreed.\n\n\nWyatt said that he wanted Quinn in his life, but she had to fit in. He started to lecture Quinn again, but she stopped him and handed him a velvet bag with jewelry in it. Wyatt peeked inside and approved. He thanked his mother.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy and Aly met on the roof, and Ivy looked at her jewelry designs. Aly maintained that she was glad they had convinced Liam to share with Hope that Liam had been in Paris. Aly felt it would change Hope's mind about her marriage. Ivy disagreed. \"At the end of the day, she's married to Wyatt.\" Ivy believed that Hope would honor her commitment.\n\n\nAly reluctantly agreed. Aly wondered if Ivy had seen the person who had knocked her into the Seine. Ivy said she hadn't, but she was sure it had been a woman. Aly joked that all the Forresters needed to stay away from places that overlooked large bodies of water.\n\n\nAly noted that Ivy liked Liam, and Ivy admitted that she did. Ivy added that she had given Liam a friendly peck on the cheek in Paris and had \"felt something.\" Ivy and Aly discussed that Ivy planned to invite Liam to an end-of-summer party at the Bikini. Aly smiled.\n\n\nIn Liam's office at Spencer, Liam flashed back to how he had desperately tried to get to Hope at the Eiffel Tower. He recalled that they had gotten the cat together. He wiped away a tear. Ivy entered, and she showed Liam some photos of her new jewelry designs. Liam told Ivy that she was very talented and every bit as talented as Quinn. Ivy was happy to get the exposure for her line.\n\n\nLiam realized that Ivy had shown up to check on him. He thanked her. Ivy said that she had spoken to Hope after the party. \"She is still in love with you,\" Ivy said. Liam noted that Hope was married. Hope had chosen Wyatt. \"She wasn't forced or manipulated. She had her eyes wide open,\" Liam said. Ivy invited Liam to the party at the Bikini, and Liam agreed to go. Ivy and Liam embraced.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Hope sat on the bed with her cat. Wyatt entered and said that it was nice to see her there, waiting for him, and it was nice to be married. Wyatt worried that Liam had laid a guilt trip on Hope. Hope said that it had thrown her a little, but she was fine. Wyatt said he had a gift for them from his mother. Hope looked skeptical, but Wyatt said it was okay. He pulled out the velvet jewelry bag with matching wedding bands inside. Wyatt noted that they had gotten married so fast that \"we kind of skipped a few beats.\"\n\n\nWyatt put the ring on Hope's finger and said, \"With this ring, I pledge my life to you.\" Hope tearfully placed the ring on Wyatt's finger and said, \"With this ring, I commit myself to you as my husband from this day on.\" She added that they would rock and roll wherever life might take them. They embraced.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Knowing that Quinn is gloating that her son got the girl, Wyatt warns his mother to stay away from Liam. Ivy confesses to Aly about her burgeoning feelings towards Liam and her intent to help him get over Hope. Rocked by the news that the situation behind her marrying Wyatt wasn\u2019t what she has thought, Hope makes a decision about her marriage. Hope is presented with a gift that assists her in solidifying her decision.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke helps Hope pack to move into Wyatt's house. She tells her mother that she can't believe that Liam was in Paris. Brooke says yeah it sounds crazy but he was there, Ivy fell into the Seine and Hope married Wyatt. That is what happened. Hope admits it is messing with her head. There is so much history there, but she is married to Wyatt now. She doesn't know what she is gonna do. At SP Liam tries to concentrate but all he can think about is Paris and Hope slipping away. Quinn asks Wyatt if Hope is at his place moving in. He should be with her. He said she needed time with her mother. She quips as he needed time with his. She thought her presence at the party went over well with the evil Quinn back in the mix with the Forrester's. He reminds her that it was only one party and she was only there because she is his mother. He says there is something he needs to tell her about Liam .he was in Paris. She acts surprised. He says Liam had every intention of meeting Hope at 3 o'clock but had to rescue a damsel in distress. Quinn mocks a typical Liam. He needs to be a gracious loser and go away. She says the best thing Wyatt did was get Hope out of Paris and onto that yacht. Liam needs to mind his own business and stay out of Wyatt's. Wyatt says that makes two of them. He needs her to stay away from Liam. The truth is he would not even be married if Hope knew Liam was there. Aly confides in Ivy that she is glad Liam told Hope that he was in Paris, it will change everything. Ivy is not so sure it matters now. Hope might struggle over what did happen but at the end of the day she is still married to Wyatt. She knows Hope's sense of morality so she hopes she honors her commitment. Aly can't believe all of this was caused by some thoughtless stranger. She asks if Ivy knows who bumped her. Ivy says no but she thinks it was a woman. Who knew it would turn into this. Even though she told Liam to leave her and go on to Hope she knew he wouldn't. There was no way he would leave her. Aly senses that Ivy really likes Liam and says she can tell her. Ivy admits she kissed Liam in Paris; just a friendly peck but she can't deny she felt something. Aly says well Liam is available now, so what's next. Ivy says there is a party on at Bikini and a lot at the office will be going. She is thinking of inviting Liam. Quinn tells Wyatt not to say that. Liam will never be half the man that Wyatt is. Wyatt tells her do not talk about Liam and do not do anything to him. He wants her to be clear about that. She replies that she may hate the little creep but she is not going to make it her life's work to torture him. Wyatt says good, that is the last thing he needs right now. Quinn tells him not to second guess Hope. She married him. The diamond brought them back together again. He tells her the police are still asking questions about Ricardo's death. She says total waste of taxpayer's money. He asks her to promise him that she had nothing to do with that. She said she already promised him that. He says okay. The diamond did bring them back together but he just wanted to be sure it was the diamond and not her doings. Deacon brings in the cat for Hope; says he missed his mommy. She holds and cuddles him. Deacon says he is no mind reader but he senses something is off here and he wants to help. Hope says there was a little mix-up in Paris, a misunderstanding on her part. She says turns out that Liam was in Paris after all to meet her. But he was delayed by a good reason; the best reason of all by saving Ivy's life. She says she is so proud of Liam. Chivalry is not dead; he is a hero. She was so lucky to have him in her life. Ivy knocks on Liam's door at SP and asks if she is interfering. He says no; he was finding it hard to even concentrate. She says that is because he was looking at the wrong thing. She has some photos that Oliver took that she'd like included in her layout. Liam takes them and tells her she is very talented and they are gorgeous .every bit as good as Quinn. She says Quinn may not be the nicest person in the world but she does know her way around jewelry. He says by the way; he knows what she is doing. He thinks it is very sweet of her to come here to check up on him. He thanks her for having his back and assures her he is going to be okay. Hope married his brother so you talk about moving on Ivy says that doesn't mean that Hope's feelings are all resolved. She talked to Hope when the party was winding down and she knows that she is still in love with Liam. He says shoulda, woulda, coulda, she has to stop blaming herself. She did not jump in the river. It was an accident. He was late but Hope could have waited a few more minutes. She chose not to. And she was not forced but she married Wyatt. She made all those decisions with her eyes wide open and if he is to move forward he has to accept that. Wyatt tells his mother he needs to know that Hope married him out of choice and not because of her. She says Hope married him because she loves him; it's that simple. He hopes she means that. She assures him that she wants to work her way back into the Forrester family not by scheming but proving she is a worthy person. He says he wants her in his life, as Hope's MIL and their children's grandmother but she has to fit in a functional way. He will not have his family be in constant chaos because of her. She says okay. Is the lecture done as she has something for him. She's beside herself with giddy joy. She hands him a velvet pouch. He looks inside and says thanks. He tells him to go to Hope; she is his wife. Hope tells Deacon that she made vows to Wyatt and she meant them. Brooke adds that she wouldn't have if Liam had made it there on time. Deacon says these things can happen all the time and if you can't fix it or change it back then you just have to accept it and move ahead with the choices that she did make. She tells them thanks. She just needs some time alone. Wyatt comes home and sits with her on the bed. He says it feels good coming home to her, being married. Ivy asks Liam if he is still feeling sad. He says somewhat as Hope was such a constant in his life for so long. It's going to feel really weird without her. Ivy says perhaps she can help him with that. At the risk of sounding terribly improper she wants to know what he is doing tomorrow night. There is an end of summer party at Bikini and she thought he might like to go. He says yeah, why not. Wyatt tells Hope that he has something for her from his mother. And not to worry it's safe. They got married so fast they sort of skipped a few beats. He pours the contents out in her hand and it is two matching wedding bands ..pounded pewter. He slips hers on and says \"with this ring I pledge my life to you.\" As she puts his on, she chuckles that she commits herself to him, her husband ..from this day on rocking and rolling wherever life takes them. He says he loves her and gives her a big hug.",
