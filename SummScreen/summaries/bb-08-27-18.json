Katie tells Bill to take a breath and calm down. Bill tells Thorne that he is stirring the pot and she never mentioned sole custody until today when Thorne mentioned it. They both bring up his involvement in pursuing his daughter-in-law and then ruining Liam's life. Bill says he is not the only one that has messed up. She has more than a few skeletons in her closet and if she takes him to court she will lose. Steffy seems pleased. Emma corners Zoe and wants to speak with her. Zoe agrees then Xander shows up. Emma says on the other hand perhaps she ought to go get more clothes on. Zoe wants to know if she is the assistant or the boss. Katie tells Bill she will never keep him from his son. He asks her to remember those nine months when she struggled with her sobriety and then more recently her trysts with Will's own half brother. She says she has had her struggles with bad times but they are talking about right now. Thorne steps in again and says Katie has been Will's full time parent unlike Bill and he is sure if she pursues sole custody, which he thinks she should, with her written proof of evidence of Bill being absent, that it will be Bill who will be the loser. Zoe tells Xander that she is grateful that he did not listen to Emma and make her go back to the U.K. and eventually maybe they can be more than friends. She kisses him and he does not pull back. Bill starts to go upstairs and Katie stops him. He says he knows how important this is and she is keeping him from his son so she is the one who is keeping them apart. Katie says he is in pain and he is blaming himself. She says she will go upstairs and let Will decide. Bill rails into Thorne that he knows Katie better than anyone else and he knows she did not dream this up all by herself. He loves Will despite his latest lapses and Thorne has absolutely nothing to say about his son's life and he will do all he can to make sure it stays that way.",
