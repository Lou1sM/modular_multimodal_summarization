    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach house, Hope unpacked and smiled wistfully at her wedding band. Wyatt, who was on his way out, said to use any drawer or closet in their home. He kissed her and sneezed. She asked if his allergies were bad. Clearing his throat and looking at Bu, he remarked that they were getting worse.\n\n\nLater, Hope was alone when Deacon arrived to check on how she was coping with the news that Liam had been in Paris. \"Well, it's like you said; Wyatt is my husband,\" Hope replied. Deacon said he'd also stopped by to see if Hope could offer him some help with Brooke.\n\n\nDeacon suddenly felt dumb for going to Hope for advice, but Hope was glad that he'd decided to do it. She also felt relieved upon hearing the type of help he needed. He stated that he could use a job and extra money, but he'd never ask Brooke or Hope for that. He knew he'd never have Bill's wealth, but he was determined to prove that he could be the man Brooke could depend upon.\n\n\nDeacon suspected his desires were just wishful thinking. Though he'd spent time with Brooke, it had only been as consulting parents. He knew they could be a family, and with Ridge out of the picture, it was their chance. Hope wished she could tell Deacon where Brooke's head was.\n\n\nDeacon declared that he wanted Brooke back. Hope sighed and advised him to be the man Brooke wanted to return to. Hope believed he could do it, but he said it would take patience. The party had given him a glimpse of what it could be like as a family, and he wanted that more than anything.\n\n\nHope smiled and hugged Deacon. She urged him to be honest with her mother because Brooke deserved to know how he felt.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke reviewed jewelry on her tablet. Upon seeing a wedding picture of herself and Bill, she flashed back to the couple's time in the Middle East. Brooke moved on to gazing at Ridge's old sketches. She gulped wine and remembered Deacon exposing Ridge's inability to draw.\n\n\nBrooke heard her front door open, and she stated that she wasn't ready to see him. The camera flashed to Bill, who'd just entered the house, unannounced. He noticed the sketches fanned out on the coffee table, and she explained that she was reviewing one of Ridge's portfolios, which was filled with years of dedication, hard work, and achievement.\n\n\nBill quipped that he and Brooke had been on their way to an achievement of their own until Ridge had derailed them with yet another news flash. Brooke replied that Ridge hadn't wanted her or anyone to know about his shortcoming. To her, the impairment was a devastation to the fashion community.\n\n\nBrooke believed that Bill only saw fashion in terms of dollar signs. In her eyes, it was an art, and Ridge had been a master. Ridge's designs told the story of Ridge's evolution as an artist and a person. They depicted Ridge's relationship with his father, his family, his travels, and his loved ones.\n\n\nSelecting a design from the table, Brooke noted that it showed Ridge's artistic maturity, refinement, and joy. Brooke said Ridge had reveled in his work, and he'd had a true gift. \"But you destroyed it,\" Brooke accused, coldly stating, \"Thanks to you, Ridge and Forrester Creations may never be the same.\"\n\n\nBill asked what he could do to fix it, but Brooke didn't know. He suspected that she wanted to forgive him. She admitted that she did. She loved Bill but didn't know how to minimize the situation. She was worried about what would happen to the business, the family, and Ridge if Ridge couldn't draw again. She'd been up all night, pondering whether she could be with a man who'd done that to Ridge.\n\n\nBill asked if Brooke had lost the right to be happy. Brooke responded that she didn't think she could be happy under the circumstances, and Bill didn't realize what he'd done. He asserted that what he'd done had been to go after the woman he loved.\n\n\nBill stated that Ridge had assaulted him and dragged Brooke from the wedding. Bill claimed that Brooke had been yelling for him as Ridge had pulled her down the beach, and Bill hadn't known where Ridge had been going or what he'd had planned. All Bill had known had been that he wouldn't let Ridge take Brooke from him. \"And I'm not going to let him or anyone else come between us now,\" Bill vowed.\n\n\nTaking her hand, Bill said that Brooke still wore the ring he'd given her because she knew they'd get through things. He believed that Ridge would recover, and Brooke and Bill would be married. \"Because we love each other, and no other outcome is acceptable. You're the only woman for me, Brooke, and I'm the only man for you,\" Bill concluded. Brooke turned, and Bill nestled his nose in her hair. The camera view split to show Deacon beside them on-screen.\n\n\nIn Liam's office, Bob Barker and Liam discussed the success Liam's article had garnered for the animal shelter. As Bob left, he asked Liam to keep advising people to get their pets spayed or neutered.\n\n\nLater, Liam was on the phone, trying to tell Alison to make a visitor go away, but Wyatt entered, anyway. Wyatt was carrying a box full of Bu's toys, food, and kitty litter. He plopped it down and refused to live with the \"hairball.\" Liam said Hope wouldn't stand for it, but Wyatt contended that her husband was allergic. \"You're allergic to cats,\" Liam cynically said.\n\n\n\"Yeah. And anything that reminds her of you,\" Wyatt added. He figured that Liam could use the cat's company due to the lonely nights. Liam looked down. Suddenly, he grabbed a tablet and charged out of his office. Wyatt pursued Liam, shouting that Liam was still taking the cat.\n\n\nOutside on a pathway, Liam caught up to Bob Barker to hand him the forgotten tablet. Wyatt ran up to them and told Liam that they weren't done. \"Just because I'm not some stupid animal lover doesn't mean I'm taking that cat,\" Wyatt asserted, his face inches from Liam's.\n\n\nBob turned Wyatt to face him and asked who he was. Wyatt asked why Bob cared. Bob stated that animal lovers were not stupid, and he didn't like that type of remark. \"Sorry. You're right. I meant animal wacko,\" Wyatt retorted. Bob asked Wyatt to tread carefully, and Liam told Wyatt not to be a \"jackass.\" Bob suggested that a pet could make Wyatt happy, and Wyatt seemed to need that.\n\n\nWyatt scoffed, and Bob repeated his mantra of having pets spayed or neutered. \"Wacko! Whoa!\" Wyatt said to Bob. \"That's it. That's it!\" Bob declared and socked Wyatt in the face. The shocked Wyatt sustained at least six punches from Bob, who then uppercut him and punched him in the back.\n\n\nWyatt hit the ground, and Liam chuckled. With his foot, Bob shoved Wyatt, and Wyatt rolled down the grassy incline. \"Really?\" Wyatt said as he sat up. Bob proclaimed, \"I've still got it, 'wacko!'\"\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Ivy and Aly prepared Maya for a photo shoot. Maya asked for Rick's opinion of how she looked. \"Wow...\" Carter murmured to Oliver, who guessed it was hard to work with an ex. Carter quipped that the best thing one could do with \"a mess like that\" was to move on.\n\n\nMaya was perky during the photo shoot, and her eyes flirted with the camera and Rick. At the end, Rick congratulated everyone and told them to have a great time at the Bikini Bar party that evening. Maya asked if he'd be attending, but he said that Caroline was still out of town.\n\n\nMaya urged Rick to go out, anyway, and celebrate the success in Paris. Carter suggested making it a guys' night out, but Oliver responded that he had a beautiful date.\n\n\nNearby, Aly was excited to hear that Ivy had a date with Liam that night. Ivy corrected that it wasn't really a date, but he wouldn't be sitting at home alone that evening.\n\n\nAs the sun set, Rick, clad in a breezy purple shirt and shorts, arrived in the midst of flashing cameras outside the Bikini Bar. He posed for a few photos and headed inside. The party was in full swing, and when he met the open-shirt-wearing Carter, he noted that the paparazzi had delayed him. Carter replied that Rick had put Forrester on the map and suggested that they celebrate with shots.\n\n\nAly arrived with Ivy and Oliver. As Oliver got them a table, Aly became worried about ruining Ivy's date with Liam. Ivy again declared that it was a party, not a date, but Aly replied that Liam would love Ivy's hair. \"And speaking of...\" Aly said as Liam traversed the crowd to reach them.\n\n\nAly left to join Oliver, and Liam complimented Ivy's hair. She said she was glad he'd made it. Liam concluded that a night out was just what he needed.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Carter leans on Oliver for comfort as he tells of his difficulties moving on from his broken engagement with Maya. Deacon pays a visit to Hope and asks her to put in a good word for him with Brooke. Meanwhile, Brooke is reliving fond memories of her time with Bill and considers forgiving him for his past transgressions. Wyatt makes a negative first impression on Bob Barker. In return, Bob Barker leaves a lasting impression on Wyatt.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt tells Hope to pick any closet or drawer. This is their home now. He has to leave for a little bit. He kisses her then sneezes and she realizes his allergies are really that bad and getting worse. Bob Barker thanks Liam for the series on animal shelters; it was a winner. Liam thanks him not only for the interview but for pointing him to the rescue shelter too. Bob says he knew Liam would be impressed and with that exposure many more pets around the world will be neutered and spayed and that makes him so happy. Rick and Oliver, Maya and Carter get ready for a photo shoot. Oliver tells Carter it must be hard to work together now. Carter muses that he's over it. The best thing you can do with a mess like that is move on and leave it behind. Rick says Caroline is out of town so he won't be coming to the Bikini party. Maya coos that doesn't mean he has to stay home. Paris was a huge success so they should celebrate. Carter agrees and says Rick can hang out with him. Deacon drops in on Hope. He offers to help her unpack but really wants her to help him. He says things have been better between he and her mother. Brooke invited him to Hope's party but she sort of kept her distance like she was testing him. Hope says maybe that is a good thing. He says maybe but he is having a hard time reading her. She has put up this wall and he is hoping Hope can help him with breaking that down. She's really glad that he came to her asking for help. She wasn't sure what to expect. He says the truth of the matter is that yes he needs a job and some extra cash but he would never come to Brooke about that. He states that he will never be as wealthy as Bill Spencer but that isn't what Brooke saw in him. She thought she could believe in and depend on Bill and it didn't turn out that way. But he is that guy and he's going to prove it. Something happened to Ridge when he hit that water. It left him incapacitated. He can't draw. All his life he has been an artist and designer and Bill took that way. Ivy tells Aly that technically she said yes for Liam, but yes he is coming to the party. Ivy says then it's a date. Ivy says she does not consider it a date but at least Liam won't be sitting on the couch alone tonight. Aly says he will be the envy of every guy at Bikini. Liam tells his secretary that he's busy and doesn't want to bother right now. Wyatt walks in and says it will only take a minute. He's only dropping Boo's things off .the whole kit and caboodle. He's not living with that hairball. Liam says Hope will not stand for this. Wyatt says he's allergic to cats .and anything that reminds her of Liam. And besides he can use the company with all those lonely nights. Deacon tells Hope maybe this is all wishful thinking. She says maybe not as they have been spending more time together. He says yes with Hope as they are family. That is their connection as parents but they are not family and they could be. Ridge is now out of the picture and with Katie so this is his and Brooke's chance. Bill slips in to see Brooke who is not ready for any intrusions. She shows him some lovely designs by Ridge. They tell a story of his evolution of an artist and as a person. He definitely had a true gift. She says Bill destroyed that so thanks to Bill that Ridge and FC may never be the same. Outside Liam catches up with Bob Barker to give him his packet he left behind. Wyatt is right behind and tells Liam that they are not done. Just because he is not some stupid animal over doesn't mean that he is going to keep the cat. Bob Barker asks who Wyatt is .and calling Liam some stupid animal lover. Wyatt asks why does he care who he is. Bob says animal lovers are not stupid and he does not like remarks like that. Wyatt says oh he is sorry, he meant animal wacko. Liam tells Wyatt not to be a jackass. Bob says maybe a pet would be a good thing, make him happy. But just remember to help the pet population and have your pet spayed or neutered. Wyatt calls him wacko one more time. Bob says that's it and proceeds to pummel him with four left hooks across the mouth, one by the left, punches him in the gut and then over the head as Wyatt doubles over. While on the ground, Bob shoves him with his foot and Wyatt rolls over and over down the hill. When he lands he says really? Bob says he still has it, Wacko. At the Bikini the place is grinding to the music with drinks flowing. Rick tells Carter he almost didn't get in. There are so many paparazzi outside. Carter says yes now Forrester in on the map with his leadership. Rick orders some drinks. Soon Oliver and Aly walk in. She just hopes Liam will be able to join them. Ivy tells her it is not a date, it's just a party. Soon Liam joins them and he mentions he likes Ivy's hair. And that she might just be right. This may be just what he needs. Hope tells Deacon she wishes she could tell him where her mother's head is at right now. But he will have to be that man that she wants to come back to. He wants to know if Hope thinks he can be that guy. She says she does. He says yesterday at the party and then when they were here he got the whole picture of what it would be like if they were a family. He says he wants that more than anything. Hope hugs him and says he has to tell her mom how he feels. He says he has. She says do it again. Just be honest with her. If he loves her then she needs to know. Bill asks Brooke what he can do to fix this. She doesn't know. He says he knows she wants to forgive him. She says yes she does. She loves him, but she doesn't know how to minimize this situation. What will happen if Ridge never draws again. What will happen to the business, his family, Ridge himself. She asked herself all night if she could be with a man who did that to Ridge. She doesn't think she has a right to be happy under those circumstances. Bill rants that Ridge came and drug her away from their wedding and he is not going to let him or anyone else come between them again. Bill says she is still wearing his ring because she knows they will get through this. Ridge will recover and they will get married as no other outcome is acceptable .she is the only woman for him and he's the only man for her. She turns away and we have a picture of Bill on one side and Deacon on the other.",
