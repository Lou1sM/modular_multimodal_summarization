    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Bill grinned at his model skyscraper. Justin arrived. Justin had spoken to their \"helper,\" and things were moving along. It looked to Justin like Bill would have his building. Bill replied that he always got what he wanted -- one way or another.\n\n\nBill figured \"this\" would be good for Sally. He understood her, and people like her thrived in hard times. Bill imagined the comeback story would be that Spectra \"rebuilds\" in the face of adversity, far away from downtown.\n\n\nBill didn't want Sally to fail forever, just for the time being. Bill asked if Justin had made sure no one was in the building. Justin said that he'd been careful, and no one was in the building. He said no one would get hurt, and the only thing dying that night was a dream. \"And a handful of tacky dresses,\" Bill added.\n\n\nJustin checked his phone and said the fire trucks were on their way. Bill said he'd figured there would be more time for nature to take its course. Justin believed it would be too late by the time the firefighters arrived. Bill thought it was fitting that, instead of bankruptcy, Spectra went out in a blaze of glory.\n\n\nAt Spectra, flames engulfed Sally's office. The Spectra crew rode up the elevator to return to work after dinner. They smelled smoke, and when the elevator doors opened, they were horrified to see Sally's office on fire.\n\n\nSally touched her doorknob and shrank back from the heat. As Shirley, Saul, and Darlita yelled at Sally not to do it, Sally grabbed rags to open the door with. They held her back as she tried to go into the burning office.\n\n\nOn her phone, Shirley called for help and found out that trucks were already on the way. The operator wanted them all to get out of the building, but Sally refused to leave her collection. She asked for a fire extinguisher because she just had to get a \"rack\" out of there.\n\n\nFirefighters burst onto the scene from the stairwell and began dragging Shirley, Saul, and Darlita out. Shirley screamed, refusing to leave her granddaughter, but the firefighters kept pulling her out. Sally began sobbing when the firefighters pulled her and urged her to go.\n\n\nOutside later, the soot-covered Spectra crew watched somberly as their building burned. Shirley held out hope that the firefighters would save Spectra. The group wondered how it had spread so quickly, and Shirley told Sally to get her cough taken care of.\n\n\nA firefighter approached and instructed the Spectra crew to move further away from the building and get behind the caution tape. He warned that the building could collapse on itself. Sally coughed and implored the firefighter to save Spectra.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Eric noticed that Quinn hadn't touched her martini. Quinn wasn't in the mood. She wanted to check on how James was doing with Sheila's examination. Eric said they shouldn't forget why Sheila was there. Quinn had realized that she shouldn't have let things get out of hand, but to her, the concussion was a bit too much. Because of her part in it, Quinn wanted to rehabilitate Sheila, but Quinn was beginning to think it was all a big lie.\n\n\nUpstairs, James asked how long Sheila would drag it out. He guessed she'd fake it for the rest of her life if she intended to became Eric's wife.  Citing that Quinn had knocked her out cold, Sheila asked why he thought she was faking. James said the hit hadn't been enough to make her bedridden for that length of time.\n\n\nAdmitting that she was exaggerating the case, Sheila said she wouldn't have to do it forever because Eric would see how horrible his wife was and would kick Quinn out. James said Eric could figure it out on his own without Sheila playing the part of an incapacitated houseguest. James wanted to tell Eric the truth. Sheila asked James to think long and hard about whether he really wanted to lose his practice over it.\n\n\nJames reasoned that they didn't have to admit to lying, but Sheila couldn't possibly still be woozy and wobbly after all that time. He said his reputation was at stake, but Sheila said he should have thought of that before he'd self-prescribed meds. James insisted that it had been a lapse in judgment, and it was over. She replied that it could stay over if he didn't make her tell.\n\n\nHearing footsteps approaching, Sheila hopped onto the bed. Eric and Quinn arrived. Quinn asked if there had been improvements. Sheila said not really. Indicating that she wasn't talking to Sheila, Quinn turned to James and said she was sure Sheila could be on her own by then. Sheila coughed and said she couldn't imagine returning to the hotel.\n\n\nQuinn revealed that she'd looked into some short-term rentals for Sheila, and if Sheila couldn't afford it, Eric and Quinn could happily work out a loan arrangement. Sheila called it sweet but said it was premature because the rentals would be gone by the time Sheila recovered.\n\n\nQuinn doubted they'd be gone by that evening. Sheila asked what Quinn was talking about. Quinn looked at James and said Sheila had recovered from the concussion and had no reason to stay longer.\n\n\nJames sat at Sheila's bedside, and near the door, Eric asked Quinn to trust what James would say. Eric knew how Quinn felt, but he felt bad about the things had that happened to Sheila after she'd arrived in the city. Quinn quipped that Sheila had gotten what she'd deserved.\n\n\nEric and Quinn went back to the bed and asked James what his opinion was. James said Sheila was improving, but he asked if they wanted to take the risk. James reasoned that if Sheila relapsed, she'd have to go to the hospital, and the press would get wind of it. He felt that if they let Sheila stay a little longer, it could make all the difference.\n\n\nEric said they had to trust James's opinion. Sheila offered to go if someone agreed to call her each morning to wake her up. \"Oh, please!\" Quinn quipped. Sheila was grateful that Eric had let her stay there, and she said it was because of him that she was \"getting so much better.\" To her, his willingness to put her needs first showed what kind of man he was.\n\n\nQuinn retorted that putting on an act and taking advantage of Eric's kindness showed what kind of person Sheila was. Eric said there was no harm in letting Sheila stay longer, but there was potential harm in her leaving. Eric decided that it was the right thing for Sheila to stay.\n\n\nEric and Quinn left, and Sheila told James not to look so guilty because he'd done the right thing. James questioned whether lying to Eric was the right thing. Sheila insisted that it was for Eric's own good because his wife had cheated on him with his son. James guessed that Sheila thought she could change it by staying there.\n\n\nSheila said she couldn't change the past, but she could help in the future. She stated that Eric was too trusting. \"Obviously,\" James quipped. Sheila asserted that Eric was too trusting of Quinn, and he needed Sheila's protection. Sheila knew that \"that bitch\" would betray Eric again, but thanks to James, Sheila would be there to take Quinn down.\n\n\nDownstairs, Quinn didn't care what James thought. Eric asked why Sheila would fake it. Quinn guessed it was to torture her. Quinn felt suffocated and violated in her own home. Hugging her, Eric said to breathe and relax because it was temporary. \"Not if Sheila has her way,\" Quinn replied. Eric said that moving Sheila too soon might return to bite them in the butt.\n\n\nEric asked for a few more days of patience, and he said he'd feel better because they'd done the right thing. He wanted Quinn to leave Sheila alone to recover without stirring the pot, and they could all move on. Eric and Quinn hugged.\n\n\nUpstairs, Sheila was prancing and humming in her dimly lit room as she laid out a robe. Quinn stealthily opened the door and saw what Sheila was doing. Slamming the door behind her, Quinn stated that Sheila was up and about. Sheila asked what Quinn was doing, and Quinn replied that she was checking on the patient, of course.\n\n\nSheila claimed it was a good thing because she'd gotten woozy while trying to get up to go for water. \"Do you mind?\" Sheila asked. Quinn decided that Sheila could get her \"damn water\" -- from the vending machine at her hotel later that night. Quinn exclaimed that she'd known it, and Sheila was faking. Sheila claimed not to know what Quinn was talking about.\n\n\nQuinn accused Sheila of dancing and humming around the room. She said that Sheila was fine and healthy, and Sheila would be out of there that night. Sheila persisted in her farce, saying she could stand, and it didn't change what Quinn had done to her. Laughing, Quinn said Sheila had only needed a Band-Aid for her boo-boo; however, Sheila had milked the situation.\n\n\nSheila remarked about Quinn cheating on Eric with her son. Quinn laughed, saying Eric had already forgiven her. She asked why Sheila would bring it up again. Quinn was ready for Eric to see Sheila for who she was.\n\n\nQuinn strode to the door. Sheila bounced off the bed and slammed the door as Quinn was opening it. Sheila grabbed Quinn, but Quinn shook her off and opened the door again. Sheila threw something, and it shattered on the wall next to the door. Quinn said Eric had given her the item, which had been from Monaco. Sheila asked what Quinn would do about it. Quinn dove at Sheila and wound up facedown on the bed.\n\n\nSheila jumped on Quinn's back and repeatedly slammed her head into the mattress. Quinn knocked Sheila off and hit her with a pillow. Sheila grabbed a pillow, too. They swung the baggy weapons, and feathers floated everywhere. Quinn fell off the bed. Some glass shattered. As Quinn crawled through the feathers, Sheila flipped Quinn over and started choking her.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Bill smiles as he looks at the model of his skyscraper when Justin stops by to inform him that the plan is in motion. Justin confirms to Bill that he made sure that no one was in the building, but the fate of Spectra Fashion is sealed. When Sally, Shirley, Saul and Darlita return from dinner break they find Sally's office on fire. Just as Sally is about to jump into the flames to at least save her precious collection, firefighters pull her back. The Spectra gang watches in shock as their work place quickly becomes a sea of flames. Eric has to realize that Quinn is still furious at him about letting Sheila stay at the Forrester Mansion. Upstairs, James tells Sheila that he wants to tell Eric the truth about her condition, but she once again threatens to ruin his career. James therefore conveys to Eric and Quinn that Sheila is improving, but cautions them that she could relapse and end up in the hospital if not taken care of properly. Later, Sheila gets out of bed humming for joy that her scheme is on point, not seeing Quinn enter the room. Now that she has confirmation, Quinn orders Sheila to get out of her house immediately. In panic, Sheila throws a vase at Quinn and another catfight ensues.",
    "tvmega_recap": "With Spectra blazing and Bill with a drink in his hand adoring his Sky, he basks in the glory of his victory. Eric tells Quinn that she has not touched her martini. She says she is not in the mood for it tonight. She adds perhaps if they had something to celebrate like a certain guest leaving. She'd like to go up and see how Sheila is doing with her examination with James. Eric reminds her of why Sheila is there in the first place. Quinn says yes she realizes she could have had more restraint. She is finding it hard to not believe this is one big fat lie. When James watches Sheila he asks how long is she going to drag this out. She replies as long as it takes. He adds until she becomes Mrs. Eric Forrester so she will have to fake this concussion the rest of her life. A little concussion does not deserve to be in bed this length of time. Sheila replies that she won't have to do it forever as Eric will see how horrible his wife is and kick her out. James says okay but it does not require her to be the injured houseguest. He wants to tell the truth. She says okay if his career doesn't mean anything to him. She threatens him that if he mentions one word to Eric his nasty little drug habit will become public. She tells him to think about it \u0096 losing his practice over this. He better think long and hard before he says anything. He should have thought of his reputation before he self medicated. He comments that he's been in treatment and that is over. She says okay they need to keep it over. Nobody has to know so do not make her tell. Sheila hears Eric coming so she hops back in bed. Quinn starts in right away wanting to know how she is and if she is ready to be moved tonight. She has a spot all ready for her. Sheila pretends that Quinn is so sweet but she couldn't possibly impose upon her to get her a place to go. Eric tells Quinn they need to trust James and he asks if Sheila is ready to go. James says she has improved but he would hate to turn her out and the press get wind of it so he thinks she should stay put a little longer. Eric tells Quinn they need to trust James's judgment. Sheila feigns her act of feeling so grateful that Eric is there to make sure she wakes up every morning. It shows what a wonderful man he is by putting her needs first. Quinn jumps in and says it shows what kind of woman she is by putting on this act for a kind man like Eric. Eric tells Quinn there is no harm in letting Sheila stay a little longer and yet potential harm for releasing her too soon. James nods yes. Eric says it is settled, Sheila will stay. Bill tells Justin that Sally will thrive on this, she lives on adversity \u0096 think of the comeback she will have in a couple of years and can relocate in some little warehouse far from down town L.A. He does not wish Sally to fail forever, just for right now. Justin says no problems, no one is going to be hurt tonight except a couple of dreams dying. Bill adds and a couple of tacky dresses. Quinn tells Eric that she feels violated in her own home. Sheila managed to con both him and James. Eric hugs her and says just a few more days and he will feel better knowing they did the right thing. So just leave her alone and do not do anything to stir the pot. Sheila will recover and they can all move on. Sheila tells James that she cannot do anything about the past but Eric is too trusting and she can do something about his future. Eric needs her here for protection. She says that bitch will betray Eric again and thanks to James she will be here to take her down. As they are saying their goodbyes, Saul smells something and they all rush inside to find the place going up in smoke. Sally cries as she tries to rush in to get the fire extinguisher. Grams calls 911. Quinn looks in on Sheila again while Eric is downstairs with James. She finds her out of bed and Sheila says yes she got up to get some water but felt a little weak so she needs to go back to bed. Quinn says she can get her own damn glass of water from the vending machine from the hotel where she is going to be tonight. She knew it; Sheila was faking it. She caught her in here dancing around on her own two feet. And Eric will kick her out of here tonight when she tells him what she walked in on. All she really needed was a band aid on her boo-boo but instead she is milking it for all it's worth. Sheila hurls a comment at her \u0096 it doesn't change what Quinn did to Eric. Quinn mocks her that Eric forgave her for that so Sheila can quit bringing that up. Eric will see her for who she really is. She turns and Sheila jumps out of bed and follows. She slams her against the door then follows through by throwing an expensive vase at her. Quinn gets mad and Sheila asks what is she going to do about it? She throws her on the bed and they begin pounding on each other, then hitting each other with pillows until there is feathers flying everywhere. Quinn tries to get away but Sheila struggles with her until she has both hands tightly around her throat. While Grams, Saul, Darlita and Sally stand transfixed the firemen try to put out the fire. They tell Sally she must leave otherwise they can do enough to save it. She says they have to. Bill looks out the window just waiting.",
