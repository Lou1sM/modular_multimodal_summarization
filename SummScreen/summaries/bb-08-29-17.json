    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Quinn and Sheila battled it out physically after Quinn caught Sheila up and walking around after Sheila had told Eric she was unable leave the mansion because she was still not well.\n\n\nSheila sat on top of Quinn and choked her. Sheila stopped, and Quinn dared Sheila to kill her because then Eric would know Sheila was crazy. Sheila stopped but then started again until she realized she would be in trouble. Quinn pushed her. \"You're insane. You almost killed me. I knew you were faking it -- pretending to be weak, and you're strong as an ox,\" Quinn said amid coughs. Sheila said \"almost\" was the operative word, but Quinn threatened that Sheila would be out of the house immediately.\n\n\nQuinn ran downstairs to tell Eric what had happened. Sheila chased her. \"She tried to kill me. She said she wanted me dead,\" Quinn told Eric. He couldn't believe the two of them had been fighting again. \"I want that murderous witch out of here tonight,\" Quinn said.\n\n\n\"Eric, I'm so sorry,\" Sheila stammered. She tried to dispute Quinn's account of what had happened and said that Quinn had attacked her, and she had been defending herself. Quinn scoffed and told Eric that Sheila had been walking around upstairs after she'd told Eric how sick she was and how she couldn't leave. Sheila argued she'd been trying to push herself to get better. Quinn noted that if Sheila was breathing, she was lying.\n\n\nQuinn insisted that Sheila had choked her. Eric asked Sheila what had happened, and Sheila tried to deflect everything onto Quinn, but Eric had had enough. \"Sheila, I'm sorry, but I know you,\" he said. He told Sheila to wait outside, and he would have a car pick her up. He opened the front door for her, and Sheila stared at Quinn and the portrait on the wall. Outside, Sheila insisted aloud that one day, her portrait would be above the fireplace. Inside the house, Eric and Quinn embraced.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam waited for Steffy to finish a report, and he was distracted. Steffy asked what was wrong, and Liam said he couldn't support Bill's lie about Caroline dying. Pam entered. She said that there had been a fire at Spectra. Liam asked how bad it was, and Pam answered that the building was gone, and Sally was in the hospital. Liam jumped up and said he would check on Sally at the hospital. Steffy prepared to follow him.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Sally coughed and kept oxygen on. Shirley, Darlita, Coco, and Saul were at her bedside. A nurse told Sally how lucky she was. Sally was sick. \"Our entire future went up in flames,\" she said. Sally lamented that the collection and the business were all gone in one night. Coco maintained that it could have been worse, and everyone had gotten out. Sally agreed, but she said that everything had been destroyed.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy entered and offered their condolences about the building. They wanted to make sure that Sally was all right. Liam asked what had happened, and Sally said it was an electrical fire. They had worried something was wrong but had figured they would fix it after the show because they didn't have the money.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy agreed that Spectra deserved to have their chance. C.J. entered and emotionally said he was glad everyone was all right after he had seen what was left of the building. He said he understood that it had had been faulty wiring. He apologized to everyone. Sally tried to calm everyone because she was confident that Thomas would return, and they would collect on the insurance money and try to rebuild.\n\n\nC.J. looked away. Shirley asked what was wrong, and C.J. admitted that there was no insurance because he had let the insurance lapse because he had felt it was inevitable that Spectra would be sold to Bill Spencer. C.J. said he'd made a mistake.\n\n\nC.J. hoped that Bill would buy the building, and maybe they would have some money left over. Liam looked thoughtful. He advised Sally not to give up on her dreams. Liam left.\n\n\nAfter Coco, Shirley, C.J., Darlita, Saul, and C.J. had left, Sally admitted to Steffy that she would never be able to rebuild. Steffy said she was sorry for everything that Sally had to go through.\n\n\nAt Spencer Publications, Justin told Bill that Spectra was in ashes. Bill said he wondered why his opponents couldn't make his life easier by just agreeing to his demands, especially when he'd asked nicely. Justin joked that he didn't recall the nice part. Bill wanted to get started immediately on demolition and new construction, but Justin persuaded him to wait in light of what had happened. \"Now is not the time to bring attention to Spencer Publications,\" Justin said. Bill agreed and hoped that C.J. Garrison would be begging him to buy it.\n\n\nLater, Liam opened the door to Bill's office while Bill stared at his skyscraper model. Liam asked if Bill had heard the news about Spectra. Bill dismissed it and said it was a shame.\n\n\nLiam said that it had struck him that a fire had broken out the night before a big showing. It was significant because the showing would have put Spectra on the map.\n\n\nBill showed no concern, but Liam reminded him that people could have been killed. Bill reminded Liam that no one had been hurt. Liam was angry. He remembered that while they'd been in Monte Carlo, Bill had been lying to Thomas about Caroline, all for the sake of his building. Liam said that lying wasn't a crime, but arson was.\n\n\n\"Be very careful now, son,\" Bill said. Liam answered that he loved his father even when Bill did things that were appalling to him. Bill agreed that he loved Liam, too.\n\n\n\"That fire wasn't an accident,\" Liam said. He accused Bill of sending henchmen to burn Spectra down. Bill glared at Liam.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "In the middle of their latest fight, Quinn dares Sheila to choke her out and show Eric how crazy she really is. Sheila strangles her a bit and then leaves Quinn sputtering that she almost killed her. Sheila takes off with Quinn on her tail to find Eric. In the living room, Eric is dismayed to realize that the women squared off again. Quinn busts Sheila about lying about her condition all along. Sheila denies exaggerating her symptoms, but Eric nevertheless sides with his wife and asks Sheila to leave. Outside, Sheila vows that she will be back. Over at Forrester Creations, Pam informs Liam and Steffy that there was a fire at Spectra Fashions and that their business rival was hospitalized. Liam and Steffy take off to find out how Sally is doing. At the hospital, Shirley, Saul, Darlita, Coco and R.J. look on as Sally is diagnosed with minor smoke inhalations. Sally is miserable that their entire collection was destroyed in the flames. An emotional C.J. arrives and has even more bad news: as he let the insurance lapse, there will not be any compensation for the fire destroyed building. At Spencer Publications, Justin reports to Bill that Spectra Fashions is nothing more but a cradle. He advises a giddy Bill to be patient with his next offer to buy the site in order to not draw any attention to their foul play. Suddenly, Liam storms into the office commenting on the convenient timing of the Spectra building burning to the ground. Bill is stunned when Liam bluntly accuses him of being behind the fire.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sheila continues choking Quinn and tells her she will get what she deserves. Quinn dares her to go ahead and prove to everyone how crazy she really is. Sheila finally lets up and Quinn berates her and says she knew she was faking it all along. She is as strong as an ox and Eric will know soon how she has been playing him. So she better pack as she will be out of this house tonight. Liam waits while Steffy finishes work and she says he looks troubled. He replies it is that lie that his dad keeps perpetuating and telling Thomas that Caroline is dying. He is going to keep the lie but it is so stupid. Pam rushes in to tell them that Sally Spectra is in the hospital due to a fire at Spectra. Steffy tells Liam they need to go check on her. The doctor at the hospital tells Sally that she is one lucky lady that she just has smoke inhalation. Next time she sees a fire \u0096 run. Sally comments that it could not be any worse; her entire future went up in flames. They lost everything. When Liam comes in he says he knows it does not mean much now but he is so sorry. Steffy says the same, they deserved a shot. CJ rushes in and says he was freaked when he saw the remains of the building so thank God they are all alive. Justin reports to Bill that the fire is out but Spectra Fashions is out of the game. Bill is pleased and says finally, Spectra is no longer a sorry dilapidated obstacle to progress. And his dream will be a reality as Sky goes up and up and up. Those clowns should have listened to him and just moved out when he asked them nicely. He wants to know how soon he can start rebuilding. Justin says he needs to have patience as now is not the time to bring attention to Spencer Publications. Quinn runs down the stairs with Sheila in hot pursuit. Eric demands to know what happened. Sheila starts trying to make apologizes but Quinn tells him that Sheila is a murderess witch who tried to kill her and she wants her out of this house tonight. She tells Eric again that Sheila has been faking her symptoms and she has proof. Sally tells her group that this is all her fault. She had been warned of the wiring but had put it off until after the showing so they would have enough money to have it fixed. She takes a big breath and says they have been thrown a lot of punches but nothing has knocked them out yet. Thomas will come home and he will save everything. It will set them back but CJ can collect on the insurance and they can rebuild. CJ looks guilty; he finally says there is no insurance. He thought the sale of the building was inevitable and the date came and went and he just forgot to get the insurance. Liam tells Sally do not break her spirit. She can come roaring back and get that recognition she deserves. He leaves Steffy and says he has to go. Eric wants to hear details but Sheila contradicts everything Quinn says. She says she was just practicing to see if she could walk by herself and she would never take advantage of Eric as Quinn keeps claiming. And it was Quinn that attacked her not the other way around. And Quinn is making it so much more dramatic than it was. Quinn tells Eric that Sheila is psychotic and crazy and they cannot let her stay here. Eric wants to know what the truth is. He doesn't want to hear that she was faking so she could stay longer. Sheila says of course not. She was just pushing herself to see what she was capable of. She thinks they both ought to be happy. The more she pushes herself the better she will be and the sooner she will be gone. Sheila then sees Eric is listening mostly to Quinn and says she does not trust Quinn and her relationship with Ridge. She tells Eric that she knows Quinn is going to hurt him again she just knows it. Eric says he does not need her protection from his wife and it really is none of her business. And seeing her move around like this he agrees with Quinn that it is time for her to go ..immediately. He will call a car and she can wait outside. She says she knows he does not want her to but she will always want what is best for him. He goes toward the door while she stares down Quinn. She takes one last long look at the portrait on the wall. Eric holds the door and tells Sheila goodbye. Then he holds out his arms and hugs Quinn. Outside Sheila says she will be back and it will be her portrait over that fireplace. When the other ones leave Sally tells Steffy that she did not want to say it in front of the others but Spectra is really dead; it will not come back this time. Liam walks into his dad's office to make sure he heard the news. Bill says yes, too bad. Liam says it seems almost poetic. Spectra goes up in flames the night before their big showing that could have put them on the map, the very thing that Bill did not want to happen. Bill says he is sorry when Liam tells him Sally is in the hospital and Liam is surprised that Bill even cares. Bill says he is no fan but he does not want to see any harm to the woman. Liam says this could have been arson and his dad knows he loves him but this sounds like it might be tied into the lie that he told Thomas. And he keeps telling himself there are limits but it is getting harder and harder for him to tell that to the pit of his stomach. He shakes his finger at Bill and says that was no electrical wiring fire. Bill sent one of his henchmen to start it and do his dirty work and burn that place to the ground. He might as well admit it. Spectra burnt to ashes tonight because of him!",
