    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge shows a displeased Brooke some sketches that Donna will be wearing on an interview talk show that night. He notices her obvious jealousy. They argue about Ridge's ridicule over Nick and his kick over Donna. He states that it's not fair for her to ask him to be alone forever. Taylor tells Phoebe that Hector is blind. Thorne drops by and wants Taylor to go with him to the cemetery. He's made a good decision, to drop the investigation and live the rest of his life without knowing who killed Darla. And he wants to run it mentally by Darla. Afterwards, he tells her that he often goes and sits and talks to Darla and he knows she would not want him to feel like this. To a very uncomfortable Taylor, he vows he can let the investigation go but until the day he dies he will always hope that the bastard that killed Darla will never find peace and will rot in hell! And someday he is going to be happy again. He apologizes for his sudden unexpected exuberance in kissing her. Stephanie visits Hector and hands him a newspaper about the \u0091hometown hero'. He wants to keep it short and sweet, why is she there? She suggests an institution in Minnesota that can help him with his blindness. He short circuits that and has no intention of leaving town so that will make Thorne's life easier. The doctor examines him and tells him there are other places here in L.A. so Hector tells Stephanie he doesn't need her. She lets him know that she is glad he has friends to help, but Taylor isn't going to be one of them. Even without eyes, he can see her crystal clear. She's saving Taylor for precious Thorne. The Rich Ginger Show begins with Felicia doing publicity and Ridge along for the ride. A cutesy Rich assures them no personal questions about Miss Logan, what they'll talk about -baseball? Felicia knows Ridge is playing one sister against the other, and he gloats that tonight one way or the other, one sister or the other, his new life begins!",
