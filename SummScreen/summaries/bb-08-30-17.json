    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge met with Steffy, and she informed him there had been a fire at Spectra. She added that there was no insurance, and it was a nightmare for Sally. He sympathized that she had lost her collection, but he recalled that she had stolen their collection previously. Steffy felt sorry for Sally.\n\n\nRidge agreed he had compassion for her as well. It was clear that Bill had wanted the Spectra building, and he would get it. He would kick C.J. at a time he was down.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Eric offered Quinn water, and she said it was nice to have their house back. Eric reminded her that the physical altercations had been unnecessary. Quinn argued that Sheila was dangerous, and Quinn would never trust her.\n\n\nEric recalled that after Quinn and Sheila's first altercation, he had thought Sheila was dead. \"She was laying on the floor, bleeding,\" he said. Quinn countered that Sheila had fully recovered and had been faking it so she could stay at the mansion. \"She's gone, and that's all that matters. Let her spread her poison elsewhere,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nQuinn offered Eric a martini, but he declined. Quinn wondered if he was worried about Sheila. Eric said he was worried about Quinn. He didn't want her to revert to her old ways. Quinn angrily said that Eric and James were under Sheila's spell.\n\n\nEric was offended and said there was no room for physical violence in the house. He wondered what would have happened if the police had been called. Quinn responded that Sheila -- with her long criminal record -- would have been in trouble.\n\n\nRidge walked in and wondered why Eric was yelling at Quinn for something Sheila had done. Eric said it was none of Ridge's business and asked Ridge to leave. Ridge acknowledged that he and Eric had differences, but Sheila was a threat and needed to stay away from Eric.\n\n\nAt her hotel room, Sheila wore Eric's robe with the initials EF, and she looked at her own portrait that she'd had commissioned. She recalled that Quinn had called her a bitch. She flashed back to fighting with Quinn and said she'd never accept Quinn being a part of Eric's life. \"You need to be rescued,\" she said.\n\n\nLater, the hotel manager visited, and Sheila worried that he wanted to throw her out. The manager said she had not paid her bill. She countered that he had not determined what had happened when shots had been fired in his \"fleabag hotel.\" She threatened to call the corporate office and tell them about it. She warned him to stop pestering her unless he wanted a lot of trouble. She ordered him to get out, and he exited.\n\n\nSheila stared at her own portrait. She promised that she would find a way back into Eric's heart, and her portrait would be above the fireplace.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam asked Bill point-blank if he had ordered to have Spectra Fashions torched. Bill reminded Liam that Sally had stolen the Forrester collection before, but Liam defended her and said she had paid her dues and deserved respect.\n\n\nBill demanded respect from Liam for the life he had given him, the cars, the beach house, the expense account. Liam was grateful and said he admired his dad, but there were things he could not accept. Bill advised him to accept them and move on. Bill reminded him that he had worked \"damned hard\" to keep Spencer where it was. He called Sally \"a thief, a hustler, and a two-bit knockoff artist.\" But Liam said her new line was excellent. He demanded that Bill look him in the eye and tell him what had happened at Spectra.\n\n\n\"You want it. You got it,\" he said. He admitted that he had \"put Sally and that bottom-feeder company out of their misery, and I don't regret it for minute.\" Liam looked sick.\n\n\nLiam and Bill argued, but Liam said he couldn't accept what Bill had done. It was criminal. He worried that Bill wanted to justify everything he did. He couldn't accept that it was the legacy Bill would leave his kids. Bill argued that he had given Liam a comfortable life ever since he had landed on Bill's doorstep.  \n\n\nBill promised to give C.J. a fair price for the building, but he demanded that Liam keep his mouth shut. \"You are a Spencer. Act like a Spencer,\" Bill said. He grabbed the sword around Liam's neck. \"Live by the sword, and die by the sword,\" he said. He advised Liam to be true to his father \"or get the hell out and never come back.\" Liam looked concerned.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Steffy lets Ridge know about Spectra and Ridge remarks on the perfect timing for Bill's skyscraper project. Bill denies to Liam that he torched Spectra Fashions. Liam rephrases his accusation and increases the moral pressure on his father. Eventually, Bill admits that he is behind the fire, yet also justifies his actions. Liam is appalled by the lengths Bill went to - just for the sake of a piece of real estate. Bill tells his son to act like a Spencer - or get out of his office. Sheila is behind on paying for her hotel room, but with a concealed threat convinces the manager to let her stay. Sheila muses that it will not be long until Eric finds out that Quinn wants his son so that she will be able to take her place in his heart. Quinn and Eric argue about Sheila when Ridge stops by to plead with his father to stay away from Sheila as she means nothing but trouble.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge pops in at the office and finds out from Steffy that Spectra burned to the ground last night. Bill glares at Liam who says it is nauseating to have to ask Bill this but he needs to know if he was responsible for torching Spectra. Bill says then don't ask. Liam asks anyway if Bill set that in motion. Quinn is still overwrought and Eric reminds her that Sheila is gone. Quinn says yeah and not a moment too soon. She says she is glad to have her house back. She was beginning to feel like a stranger here. Eric again halfway takes Sheila's side by saying Quinn is partly responsible for what happened here. Quinn admits Sheila brings out the worst in her; knows how to push her buttons and she will never trust her. She's crazy. She does not want to debate this. At least she is gone now and that is all that matters. She can go spread her poison elsewhere. Meanwhile the manager of the hotel shows up at Sheila's and tells her she is behind on the rent and he is there to collect or he will have to throw her out. She says as the manager of this fleabag he should find out who fired a gun in this room as she did not forget and neither will corporate office when she calls them. She barks at this poor guy that he better get out and work on that as she can bring it. Bill tells Liam that his accusations are dangerous and he needs to stop right here and right now. Eric tells Quinn that he is not worried about Sheila any more but he is concerned with Quinn's behavior. They have had two altercations right here in their home and he does not want to see her fall back into her old patterns. Quinn says she won't but Eric is familiar with Sheila and knows she can push, and taunt and instigate and even fake her own condition. Ridge tells Steffy that it is ironic. They lost their collection to Sally and now she has lost her collection on the eve of her big showing. Steffy says she ought to feel some justification but she doesn't. Ridge says she just touched a nerve of compassion; he knew she had it in her. She says she is sure Bill Spencer is riding high on this. Ridge says yes he will get the building now for pennies on the dollar and kick CJ while he is down. This fire could not come at a better time for Billy. Sheila looks at the start of her own portrait and vows she will be back. She will not let that woman destroy Eric. Bill feels threatened by being accused of the torching, all he wants is a little respect. Liam says sorry but he has to know. And respect for what? Bill says for the life he has given Liam. .the beach house, the expense accounts, he doesn't have to give him a laundry list. Liam says he loves Bill and there are many things he admires about him but this is not one of them. Bill says he can accept that so why can't Liam and move on. The conversation gets more heated as Bill calls Sally a thief and a hustler plus knockoff queen. Liam says not this time. This new collection would have turned them around so he wants Bill to look him in the eye and tell him the truth if he was behind that fire. Bill looks at him and says okay if he wants it straight, yes. Bill says he put that bottom-feeder company of Sally's out of their misery and he will not look back and regret it for a minute. He wonders why Liam looks so bewildered when he already suspected he was involved. Liam is shell shocked and wonders how Bill can be so glib about this. Then Bill gives him more cold hard facts of life that he is a businessman and swims with the sharks and he has done everything he can to build SP into the power house that it is and Liam has enjoyed the luxurious spoils of that. It has given Bill his life and thousands of employees that depend on him for their life. Liam says there is still a line and Bill crossed it. Bill reminds him that is the funny thing about lines. They can get blurred and murky just like when Sally stole from the Forrester's. Liam says yes Sally committed a crime but one crime does not justify another. Bill says he might call it a crime; he calls it touche. Bill chides him for taking sides just because Sally bats her eyes at Liam. She is still a thief. Liam says well she is trying to turn her life around. Bill quips well then she will have a good chance when she starts again from scratch. Liam barks at him and asks if there is anything he wouldn't do. Bill says no well maybe short of murder and he made sure the building was cleared out. He doesn't know what Liam wanted him to do since that freak show would not close down despite him making two great offers to CJ. So he eliminated an eyesore that should have been gone in the first place. Liam says all of this because he shipped Thomas off to New York and that didn't work. Bill says sure it did. Caroline has her family back. Liam says Bill does not get it. He doesn't even know what he has done as long as he gets what he wants and he gets that thing done. He points to Sky and says it does not matter who gets hurt as long as his ego is intact. And that is the legacy he wants to leave his kids; that is the jackpot. Bill stares at him and says Liam has been living very well ever since he showed up on his doorsteps . and if he doesn't want that any more then .get out and he points to the door. Liam says no, he is just getting started. Eric continues to berate Quinn that she is acting like this is no big deal but it is a big deal. He does not want the press to get wind of this. Ridge walks in and asks Eric why he is shouting at Quinn when it was all Sheila's fault. Eric tells him that Sheila is gone and this is not Ridge's business. And he and Quinn are fine. She says she let things get a little out of hand with Sheila. Eric tells Ridge that he does not want him here so he needs to leave. Ridge says he loves Eric and wants him happy and he thinks that is with Quinn. Bill laments to Liam that he will pay CJ more than the burned building is worth. Liam asks about Sally as she lost a lot more than a building. Bill finds that odd that he chooses to champion her. Liam says he does not have to defend Sally as she is a victim of Bill's crime. Bill laughs and says she is no one's victim. And when Liam says the end always justifies the means to Bill he answers yes. Liam says he knows he is tough in the boardroom but that should not be the case here. And he says he hated it but he went along with the lie about Caroline and kept his mouth shut but this is different. Bill smirks and asks what is Liam going to do, turn his own father in and put him behind bars. Liam says Bill has his principles and Liam has his. Bill looks him in the eye and says Liam is a Spencer and he will tell no one, he will act like a Spencer! He picks Liam's sword necklace up by the tip and tells Liam that you live by the sword and die by the sword. Be true to his father or go and never come back.",
