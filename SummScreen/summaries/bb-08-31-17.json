    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Brooke grimaced as Bill yelled into his phone at an intern about what he thought should be a three-line article about Spectra, the company no one would miss. After the call, he kissed Brooke, and she said Spectra's fire was big news for the city. Bill quipped that an energy drink would be big news, and no one would miss Spectra. She replied that the Spectras would.\n\n\nAllison called to see if she should send flowers to Sally like Jarrett wanted her to, and Bill roared that Jarrett could send his own flowers. Bill hung up on Alison. Flipping through a report, Brooke expressed surprise that the Spectra building had been uninsured. Bill believed that C.J. could have avoided it had he sold Bill the building. Brooke didn't know how Spectra could recover. \"Well, maybe if Thomas had stayed,\" Brooke reasoned.\n\n\nBill didn't know what good Thomas could have been -- unless the Forresters were flame retardant. Brooke figured that Thomas could help the Spectras set up somewhere else and front them a few months' rent. Bill asked why she was interested in seeing the competition back in business. Brooke explained that losing everything wasn't a business crisis, but a human one.\n\n\nCaroline arrived with Douglas. The surprised Brooke said it was good to see them. She asked if Thomas was with them, and Caroline affirmed it. Brooke decided to leave for work and suggested Caroline stop by the office to see Steffy.\n\n\nAfter Brooke had gone, Caroline exclaimed that it was nice to have someone not treat her like she was dying. Bill wanted to know why Caroline had traveled there with Thomas. She asked if she was supposed to keep Thomas in at home when he was frantic over Sally's genuine predicament. Caroline believed Thomas deserved better from her.\n\n\nLater, Caroline checked her phone, and irritated, she dropped it in her purse. Bill walked in, saying Douglas couldn't get enough of Alison. Caroline quipped that it was because Alison fed him ice cream until his stomach hurt. Bill asked Caroline not to be so wound up.\n\n\n\"I want my miracle cure today or tomorrow. Before I leave, I want it!\" Caroline raged. Bill said it was too soon, but she demanded that he hire an actor to play doctor and declare her all better. Bill repeated that it was too soon, and Thomas was still running to Sally's rescue.\n\n\nCaroline said she'd tell Thomas that she'd lied. Bill replied that Caroline would lose Thomas, and if Thomas was mad enough, she'd lose Douglas. Bill asked if she wanted Thomas and the batty redhead raising Douglas. Bill told Caroline to look at the bright side. Usually, people only had one shot at death, but Caroline got to rehearse. Caroline glared at him.\n\n\nBill asked if Thomas had any plans, and Caroline stated that if Thomas did, he hadn't shared them. Bill noted that Thomas had a habit of being a \"pain in the ass\" when one least expected it. Bill asked if Thomas was planning to move back. Caroline said Thomas hadn't said anything to her, but she didn't know what he was saying to Sally.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy thanked Liam for driving her to work and said she'd see him at day's end. Liam didn't think he could go to work and asked to hang out at Forrester. He was disconcerted about Spectra's loss. Steffy knew Liam, and she suspected that he thought his father had had something to do with the fire. Liam said he was sure of it because Bill had admitted it.\n\n\nSteffy was shocked to hear that Bill had been involved in arson. Liam said Bill had hired the best people, and it would look like an electrical fire unless someone revealed the truth. Steffy said it was criminal, and Liam agreed.\n\n\nMaya, Rick, Ivy, and R.J. arrived, all curious for news about the fire. Rick had received three calls for comment, and Steffy said she'd have Katie draft a statement. Maya found it uncanny that the fire had happened the night before the showing. Rick said it had to be bad karma or bad luck. R.J. got a message from Coco that Sally might go home from the hospital that day.\n\n\nRick, Maya, and Steffy discussed whether it was appropriate to send Sally flowers for her loss. Ivy said it wasn't really a loss because the insurance would help them rebuild. Steffy explained that the building hadn't been insured, and Liam explained that C.J. hadn't renewed the insurance because he'd expected to sell the property.\n\n\nRick asked how the fire had started, and asked, \"Should we be looking for someone to sue?\" Stammering, Steffy and Liam explained that it had been an electrical fire, and a plug had caught fire at the preview. They looked guilty when Ivy said that had to be what had happened again.\n\n\nThe group discussed the predicament of the Spectra employees. Maya suggested hiring some of their models, and Steffy claimed to be okay with hiring their seamstresses for the overtime that Forrester seamstresses were working. Rick thought it was great because people wanted work, not handouts. R.J. told Rick to speak to himself.\n\n\nRick pretend wrestled R.J., who was in a chair, and Brooke waltzed in, joking that she loved it when her sons got along. Maya asked if Brooke had heard the news. Liam and Steffy looked at each other as if they were choking on guilt as Brooke said Bill had told her that morning. Ivy recalled that Bill had wanted to buy the property.\n\n\nBrooke said Caroline was in town, and Steffy asked if Thomas was, too. Affirming it, Brooke said Caroline hadn't said where Thomas was at the time. \"I can only guess,\" Brooke added.\n\n\nEveryone cleared out, and later, while Brooke worked at the table, Liam asked how Bill's spirits were. Brooke said Bill had no love lost about Spectra, but it had been sad for Brooke to hear that C.J. had let the insurance lapse.  Brooke stated that Bill had said it wouldn't have happened if C.J. had sold Bill the building.\n\n\nSteffy guessed Bill would get his building, after all. Liam replied that he wouldn't call it a sure thing. Brooke said Bill always thought a new building or buyout would make him more content, but it never lasted very long.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Sally's loved ones watched as the doctor examined Sally, and Sally pressed to know when she could leave. Removing the oxygen tubes, the doctor said it might be soon, but Sally shouldn't return to work right away. Shirley said that they needed a miracle.\n\n\nJust then, Thomas entered with a bouquet of flowers. He sat on the bed and asked Sally what hurt. \"Nothing now,\" Sally replied, and they hugged. The Spectra gang was anxious to know if Thomas had returned home or was just visiting. Sally stated that they'd next be asking what he had for them. She decided she was serious and asked what Thomas had for her. Thomas made a heart symbol with his fingers and pushed it toward her.\n\n\nShirley, Darlita, and Saul discussed how Sally had tried to go into her blazing office, but the firefighters had stopped her. Shirley told Thomas that they all were glad to have him there. Thomas looked at Saul, and Saul dubiously agreed that he felt the same way.\n\n\nCoco said they should give Sally and Thomas time alone, and the Spectra gang exited. Sally said that even as everything had gone up in flames, she'd thought that she at least had Thomas.\n\n\nLater, Thomas was explaining that Caroline had good and bad days. She seemed physically well, but she was in an emotional tailspin. Caroline didn't want to tell her moms about the diagnosis, leaving him as her only support. Sally said it was a lot for Thomas to handle. Thomas replied that it would help if Sally didn't go running into burning buildings.\n\n\nSally claimed it hadn't been what had happened. She explained that she'd taken the crew out to dinner, and they hadn't noticed the fire from the outside as they'd returned to the building to work. Everyone had been happy and ready for the showing. She said that, upon exiting the elevator, they'd seen her office on fire. She claimed that she'd opened the office door, but a beam had blocked her way. She'd watched their work go up in flames.\n\n\nSally's dreams had been shattered, and she hadn't been able to see a way forward. \"Until you walked through the door,\" she said.\n\n\nA nurse checked on the coughing Sally, who asked for her discharge papers. The nurse said the doctor wanted to wait until Sally could be without supplemental oxygen. Thomas joked that he could go so he didn't suck up the air in the room. Sally asked where he'd go, and he said into the lobby so the gang could return and visit.\n\n\nSally asked if Thomas was back. Thomas offered to let her pinch him to see that he was real. Sally admired him for what he was doing for Caroline and Douglas and for making the time to see if her charred lungs and rotten luck would be okay. Thomas asked if she was going to be okay.\n\n\nSally replied that she tried not to have expectations when it came to Thomas, but she did. She couldn't help but think he'd be her champion as he'd always been. She wondered if he still was or if it had changed after he'd left. Sally stated that she hated to sound needy, but she actually was. She literally had nothing but her health. She needed to know if Thomas was back.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Steffy is stunned when Liam confides in her about Bill's terrible deed. Rick, Maya and R.J. speculate about the fire. Bill's unaffected reaction to Spectra going up in flames leaves Brooke bewildered. Later, Caroline arrives at Spencer Publications with Douglas. Bill thinks that she made a terrible mistake by giving Thomas her consent to visit Sally because no one knows that will transpire between them. Sally is about to be released from the hospital. When Thomas returns from New York to look after his ailing girlfriend, Shirley, Saul, Darlita and Coco quickly exit. Sally is overcome by her emotion to have Thomas back in town. But will he stay?",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam wants to hang around in Steffy's office, not be in the way. He just does not feel like going to work after seeing Sally last night and all that she lost. She says she knows he does not want to talk about it but that he thinks his father was responsible. Liam says yes, he knows he was. Bill even told him. The doctor checks out Sally and says since her cough is almost gone and if she does not go back to work maybe she will release her today. However as soon as the doctor goes, Sally starts coughing again. Grams says what they need is a miracle and in walks Thomas. Sally perks up but wants to cry at the same time. Thomas gives her a hug. Steffy asks Liam if he is saying arson. She thought it was an electrical wiring problem. Liam says it was and that is probably where Bill got the idea. His dad always hires the best people and even the electrical investigators will think as much unless someone says something. Ivy, Rick, Maya, Coco and RJ come rushing in and want to know about the fire. Maya says she was not her most favorite person but this is so unfair just the night before Sally's big showing. Rick says call it karma or bad luck. Liam and Steffy just glance at each other. Rick says they should be looking around for someone to sue. Both Liam and Steffy say it was probably a faulty electrical wiring as the building is so old. Brooke cannot believe Sally had no insurance and says they will never get back upon their feet. Only if maybe Thomas had stayed. Perhaps he can now set her up in another location and get back in the business. Thomas tells Sally that smoke can be dangerous so she needs to be careful. He gives her a hand-made heart with his two hands. Caroline walks into Bill's office with Douglas. Brooke is happy to see them. But she says she is going to have to go or be late for work. So drop in later as she knows Steffy would like to see her. Caroline says it feels so good to be able to talk to someone who does not think she is dying. And Sally being torched........ Thomas is in love with her and deserves so much better than Caroline. Grams tells Thomas she is speaking for everyone that they are so glad he is back .she hopes he is back. Coco says Thomas and Sally probably would like some time alone. Sally tells him that even when things looked the bleakest and everything went up in smoke she told herself she still had Thomas. Brooke goes to work and says she was just at Bill's office and his niece and her son were there. Thomas is here too but he did not come. She can only guess where he might be. Caroline says she never should have come to see Bill and she wants her miracle cure today before she leaves. Bill tells her it is too soon. She says hire an actor, pretend to be a doctor and cure her. Bill repeats again that it is too soon. Thomas is here still trying to rescue Little Orphan Sally so she has to give it more time. She could lose Thomas and if he gets mad enough she might lose Douglas as well. So none of this telling everyone that this is a lie. She will have Thomas raising Douglas with that crazy redhead. Sally asks about Caroline and Thomas says physically she seems fine but emotionally she is a wreck. Caroline seems to think that he is her only support out there. Even her moms do not know about her diagnosis. Sally says that is putting an awful lot on Thomas. She explains how she happened to be there and saw the place go up in smoke and on the day her dream was to come true. And now she cannot see the future until she saw him walk through the door. Bill wants Caroline to tell him what is up with Thomas. She says he came to see Sally and if there was anything else he sure did not share it with her. She does not know what he is telling Sally. Sally asks Thomas if he is back. He tells her to pinch him to make sure he is real. She says she admires what he is doing for Caroline and Douglas and she was already in love with him but now he has this sunbeam around him. Not many men would have done what he did and then came back to check on her charred lungs and her rotten luck. She says she tries not to have expectations when it comes to him but the truth is she does. He's going to be her champion and be there like he's always been. She wants to know if that is still him or did that change when he left and is now with Caroline. She hates sounding needy but the truth is she is .and she needs to know if he is really back.",
