Stephanie goes to Taylor's and tells her she knows about the kiss with Thorne and wonders what her intentions are? Stephanie is grateful for her help and friendship. When she realizes Hector is upstairs, she heads upstairs to have a talk as this is a man who will take advantage of Taylor and the situation. She tells them both this is wrong and her offer of the facility still stands. And to Taylor that this is a recipe for disaster. Hector opines that he hopes Taylor can see this is nothing more than a controlling mother who's only focus is on her own son. Taylor offers that the man just lost his sight and she's only offering to help him.
