    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's, Deacon showed up and asked Brooke if she had thought about his proposal. He maintained that people had few second chances. \"I want that so bad,\" he said. \"I know,\" Brooke said. Deacon brought up Bridget, and he asked if Brooke had worried about Bridget's reaction. Brooke noted that Bridget had forgiven both of them a long time before. Brooke said that she worried about Ridge. Deacon noted that he would not give up on the idea.\n\n\nHope entered and asked what Brooke and Deacon had been talking about. Brooke and Deacon grew silent. Deacon asked how Hope was because she appeared to be glowing. Hope dished that one minute she had been waiting for Liam, and the next, Wyatt had swept her off her feet. She said she couldn't help thinking about the \"what ifs.\"\n\n\nBrooke reminded Hope that Wyatt had been committed to Hope since the first time he had met her. Hope said she couldn't turn her feelings for Liam off. Deacon reminded her that she didn't have to turn off her feelings. \"It's okay to have those feelings,\" Deacon said. He explained that Liam was a very special person, but he added that Hope was Wyatt's wife. Hope smiled and said that it was nice to have both her parents together. She hugged Deacon.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Caroline had returned from a visit with her mothers. She hugged Rick, and he noted that he had missed her. Caroline agreed that she had missed her husband, and she teased that Maya had probably hit on him more than once. Rick said it was nothing he couldn't handle. Caroline said that her mothers had spoiled her rotten while she had visited them. Caroline asked Rick to catch her up on what had happened at Forrester.\n\n\nRick admitted that he had been worried about Ridge and designs for the Forrester couture line. Rick said that Ridge had not given him any designs. Rick worried that there was more going on with Ridge than anyone knew.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Ridge tried to design, and Katie entered, but Ridge thought she was Pam. He ordered her to stop interrupting him. He noticed it was Katie, and he apologized and kissed and hugged her. Ridge said that Pam had pestered him with lemon bars and medieval event news.\n\n\nKatie asked how his day had gone, and Ridge maintained that he couldn't draw anymore. He added that he had deadlines, and Rick had been breathing down his neck. \"I've got nothing,\" he said. Ridge wanted to give Rick something that Forrester could be proud of, but it was too much pressure. \n\n\nRick and Caroline entered. Rick said he hated to pull rank on Ridge, but he needed Ridge to show him some designs by the end of the day. Rick said that he was uncomfortable with waiting, and he left. Caroline remained.\n\n\nKatie followed Rick to his office, where Rick worried to Katie that something more was going on with Ridge. He pointedly asked Katie about it, but Katie covered up for Ridge and reminded Rick that Ridge had been through a lot.\n\n\nRick agreed, but he felt that Ridge had to be part of the team, and Ridge had been more difficult than usual. Rick worried that Ridge had an ego problem. Katie disagreed. Ridge asked if Katie had seen Ridge's designs. Rick pointedly asked if Katie had liked them. \n\n\nKatie grew uncomfortable, and she told Rick that she was not a judge of designs, but Rick reminded that Katie had been the Forrester CEO, and she was a woman -- the target audience for Forrester. Katie turned away. \"You're putting me in a weird position,\" she said. She promised that Ridge would be on track.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Caroline told Ridge that she had designed a few gowns for the couture line while she had been in New York City. \"I'll show you mine if you show me yours,\" she teased.\n\n\nRidge encouraged her to show him her designs. She gushed that she felt like he was a design god. \"Just being in your presence is inspiring,\" she said. She felt that they had a connection because he had been so in love with her namesake -- her late aunt Caroline.\n\n\nCaroline admitted that she had pored over Ridge's collections when she'd been younger. She teased that she had buttered him up, and she showed him one of her designs. Ridge grew quiet. She worried that he hated it. Ridge disagreed. \"I love the detailing,\" he said. He instructed her to lose some of the busy detail around the waist and the bodice. \"Remember less is more,\" he said.\n\n\nCaroline noted that she had struggled with trying to be sophisticated yet fresh. \"Can you help me?\" she asked. Ridge looked at the design, and Caroline explained that she didn't know if she should change something or start over. Ridge suggested a different fabric that was lighter and more flattering to the silhouette. Caroline agreed. She asked about the back of the dress. Ridge pointed out that it was too busy. He suggested a more simple line, and Caroline encouraged him to draw it. He refused and told her to draw it because it was her design.\n\n\nRidge encouraged Caroline to focus on the client who would buy the dress. \"Don't overthink it. It has to seem effortless,\" he added. Caroline drew some new lines, and Ridge told her to try again. \"Please show me,\" Caroline begged. \n\n\nRidge put his hand on top of Caroline's hand and guided the pencil. \"You're trembling,\" she said. He told her not to worry about that. Together, they finished the dress design. Caroline laughed. \"Yes, I totally see it. This is amazing,\" she said. \"We make a really good team,\" Caroline added. \"Yes we do,\" Ridge agreed, and he smiled. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Brooke feels blindsided by Deacon when he shows up at her door expecting an answer to his proposal. Fresh from her trip, Caroline returns to a perturbed Rick who vents to her about his frustrations regarding Ridge\u2019s lack of designs. Deacon trusts that Brooke will soften her attitude towards him after spending a warm morning with him and Hope. Katie feels obligated to defend her fianc\u00e9 when Rick becomes demanding regarding Ridge\u2019s work.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Deacon drops in again on Brooke. He says he knows she was not expecting a proposal last night but .he wants this so bad for Hope's parents to be reunited. He asks her to marry him and bring that family back together again. She says she has a lot on her plate and she has Ridge on her mind now. Hope interrupts and Deacon tells her about his proposal and hopes to get an answer from Brooke. She says she is also thinking over a lot of things that she did not know before. Caroline surprises Rick and comes back a day early. Both are happy to see each other. Then she wants to be caught up .like how many times has Maya hit upon him. His question is why aren't they getting any sketches out of Ridge. Maybe there is more going on than they know. Katie goes to see Ridge at FC but he still can't draw and the due date is getting closer. Rick comes in and says it is a problem and he hates pulling rank but he needs to see the designs now. Ridge says Rick will get the sketches when he is ready. Rick says suddenly that is not good enough. Caroline intercedes and says it just so happens that she too has been working on some couture. Rick is excited and so is Ridge and they agree to give it to the end of the day. Katie tries to intercede and says he can depend on Ridge. Rick says it's more than that. It's his ego too. Is he on the right track or is something else going on. Caroline tells Ridge that she will show him hers if he will show her his. Hope tells her mother that things are so weird. She did not know the circumstances and if Liam had shown up she would be his wife now. Brooke assures her she would not have married Wyatt if she did to love him. Deacon asks if she is committed to Wyatt for sure. She says Wyatt makes her so happy. But she told Liam and she waited for him and he did not show. Brooke reminds her that Liam was saving Ivy's life so he had no choice. She says she can not just turn off feelings for someone. Deacon says that is not wrong. He knows better than anyone, but her feelings for Liam will be different now. It's nice to have both of her parents now to talk to; she loves them both. Rick tells Katie that the deadline was like yesterday, so if anyone can get through to Ridge's ego it is her. He is tired of being stonewalled here and he will call his bluff. Caroline tell Ridge that he is the design God. She has this special connection to him through her aunt and his designs always depicted that. She shows him some sketches. He likes them a lot but reminds her that less is more with couture. Some need some changes. She asks for his help. They put their heads together. Ridge tells her to sit down and he gives her some ideas and suggestions. He won't draw it for her and tells her it is her dress so design it for the woman she is making it for. He takes her hand and puts it over hers and the pencil but he is trembling. He tells her not to worry about that. Then with her hand guiding it he proceeds to make a beautiful change. She says they make a very good team.",
