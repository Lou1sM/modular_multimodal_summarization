    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Ridge's loft, Ridge and Brooke discussed that Ridge had gotten a vasectomy when he had lived in Paris, and he'd never discussed it with anyone. Brooke asked why he had done it, and Ridge said he didn't have to defend himself. He'd felt he was done having children.\n\n\nRidge said he had never expected that he would need to rethink his decision. \"Then there was Caroline,\" Brooke said. Ridge agreed, and he added that it was new and exciting, and he didn't want it to stop. He had no idea how long it would last.\n\n\nRidge acknowledged that he had been hoping that having children wouldn't even be mentioned. He defended his actions of ending the relationship. He wanted Caroline to be happy. Brooke looked doubtful. \"Don't look at me like that. Maybe I should have told her about it,\" Ridge admitted.\n\n\nBrooke noted that he needed to tell Caroline about the vasectomy so that she could understand. Ridge said it wouldn't have made a difference. Brooke said he had made the right decision. \"You wanted to live your life,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nBrooke prattled on about how Caroline and Ridge had been good for each other, but they had never really been on the same course. Brooke noted that Ridge liked to live in the moment, and moments didn't usually last.\n\n\nBrooke added that Ridge's philosophy made it hard on children because they needed stability and consistency. Brooke said that Ridge could always change plans, and even vasectomies could sometimes be reversed. Ridge looked thoughtful.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Caroline woke up naked in bed next to a man. \"Ridge?\" she asked. Thomas rolled over and smiled at her. She put her hand over her mouth.\n\n\nCaroline asked why Thomas was there. Thomas said he would never have left her alone after the previous night. He reached out to touch her, and she slapped his hand away.\n\n\n\"We fell asleep,\" Thomas started. He tried to remind her of what had happened, but Caroline was panicked. \"Did we?\" she asked. \"We made love,\" Thomas announced. \"No, no, I wouldn't do that,\" Caroline cried.\n\n\n\"Seriously, Caroline, you don't remember anything?\" Thomas asked. Thomas tried to tell Caroline that they had talked, and he had told Caroline how he felt about her. He had wanted to show her how he felt. \"No, no!\" Caroline screamed.\n\n\nCaroline cried that she had taken antianxiety pills. Thomas was surprised. \"And we drank so much,\" he said. Caroline wondered if she had passed out. She shouted at Thomas that she wouldn't have wanted to be with him, and he should have known that.\n\n\nThomas looked panicked. \"I would never take advantage of you,\" he said. Thomas babbled on about how special she was and how beautiful. \"I was here for you,\" he said.\n\n\nCaroline shook her head and said she remembered nothing. Thomas said it had been amazing. He insisted she didn't remember because she had taken pills. He wondered why she had done that.\n\n\nCaroline freaked out on him. \"How could you not tell? You had to have known,\" she screamed. Thomas shook his head, and Caroline fumed. \"I'm in love with your father,\" she insisted.\n\n\nThomas said he had done nothing wrong, but Caroline argued. \"I'm not that kind of person,\" she said. Thomas tried to defend himself, but Caroline was furious. \"Get out,\" she commanded. After he left, Caroline hung her head and cried.\n\n\nCaroline's phone rang, and it was Ridge. \"Ridge,\" she sobbed. Ridge noted that she had been crying, and he tried to apologize. \"I'm sorry. Tell me where you are. I need to see you,\" Ridge said. Caroline said she couldn't talk to him. She hung up.\n\n\nRidge was worried, and Brooke wondered what he would do. \"You're not thinking about getting back with her and having a baby with her?\" Brooke quizzed.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Steffy walked in and shouted for Ivy. Wyatt said that Ivy wasn't there. Steffy demanded that Wyatt and Ivy get rid of the video. Steffy dished that Ivy had been trying to control her and had said she owned Steffy. Steffy told Wyatt that she refused to let Ivy control her any longer.\n\n\nSteffy told Wyatt that his girlfriend had been out of control. Wyatt tried to defend Ivy, but Steffy said she expected Wyatt to be reasonable while his girlfriend had been threatening to put Steffy in jail for murder or massacre her in the media.\n\n\nSteffy maintained that deleting the video was the right thing to do for everyone -- to heal and move on. Wyatt defended Ivy and said Steffy's story about the rock was not supported by the video. Steffy insisted that Aly would have killed her. Steffy said there had been a rock, and she'd had to protect herself. Steffy accused Wyatt and Ivy of disliking Liam and Steffy so much that they wanted revenge. They were bitter that Liam and Steffy had ended up together.\n\n\nWyatt said it wasn't true, but Steffy asked him to help her because Ivy had changed. She was blackmailing Steffy. \"Let's put this behind us. Help me get rid of that video,\" Steffy said. Wyatt looked thoughtful.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke cannot believe that Ridge broke it off with Caroline just because he had a vasectomy. It happened when she was in Paris. He was not seeing anyone and he told no one. He did not know if his relationship with Caroline would last, and he saw no reason to bring it up. He explains that now she wants children. He told her that he didn't. When she wakes up and knows the truth she will understand. Caroline does wake up naked in bed and is astounded when she finds Thomas laying beside her. She remembers nothing of how he got there and asks him to explain, but she will not let him touch her. He says he told her how he felt and it was mutual; they made love. She becomes hysterical and even more so when she says she remembers nothing except that she did take some pills before he came over. He claims he knew nothing about that and while she was a little emotional he thought she was okay. He would never take advantage of her. They talked a long time before anything happened. She says she is not that kind of girl who would date his father and then turn around and make love to his son. She screams when Thomas tries to explain how it happened and tells him to get out. He grabs his clothes and leaves. She is crying when Ridge calls and wants to talk to her. Steffy storms into Wyatt's house looking for Ivy. She says she asked Wyatt to delete the video.
