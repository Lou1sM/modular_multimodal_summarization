    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Sanchez to take it easy. Thomas just took a very bad fall. Det. Sanchez says he is aware of that. All he wants to ask Thomas if he fell or was he pushed. Wyatt starts to kiss Sally and she tells the cowboy to hold his roll. She's not sure she wants to jump back in headfirst. She seems to enjoy giving him a hard time. He says he can do better than that first kiss. And they can make this relationship whatever they want it to be. Sally had her second chance so now he wants his too. They joke about his chewing his breakfast cereal and other things. He wants to take her to dinner for a real date. She apologizes again for not telling him the truth about Thomas. Perhaps some of this could have been avoided. Wyatt says he does not want him to die but he got himself into all this mess so he will pay for his actions. He mentions Flo too sitting in a jail cell, one deception after another. That's why he hopes they can all move past this. She says he seems pretty confident. Thomas tells Det. Sanchez that no one pushed him; it was an accident. Brooke gives a quiet sigh of relief. Sanchez asks Thomas if he is positive and Thomas says yes, he fell. Before the detective leaves he tells Thomas not to leave town. There is new information that he needs to get from Xander and Flo. Ridge begs for just a little time and Hope and Liam stay as well. Thomas says he has no one to blame but himself. Brooke was only trying to protect her daughter thinking he was hurting her. He does not know what made him do the things he did. He was being selfish but he guarantees them he will never do anything like that again. He knows he has no right to ask for their forgiveness. But he did it out of love for her. He meant his vows. Douglas really wanted Hope to be his mother. Thomas wanted her too for Douglas's mother. And he is sorry that he knew the truth but kept Beth's whereabouts from her. He tells Hope that he loves her and hopes someday she can forgive him. The doctor comes back in and says that is enough. He tells Ridge and Brooke that considering the fall, there seems to be no setbacks .no paralysis, no broken bones or even concussion. So he would just like to keep him for another day or two for the swelling to go down. They can consider themselves lucky. Ridge tells Brooke that's a relief. And Thomas is not the only one who should feel lucky. She must be relieved that Thomas did not tell the detective the truth. He pulls away when she tries to put her hand on his. He says he saw her push Thomas whether it was intentional or not. Liam and Hope talk and she is grateful that Thomas did not say her mother pushed him. Liam says yes, he was not sure where he was going. She says Thomas's apology is not enough, not even close. There are so many firsts with Beth they have missed. He admits that is true but look at it this way. There will be so many more firsts they will see and enjoy now. Brooke and Ridge sit and talk. He tells her she got off lucky that Thomas did not tell the truth. He saw her push him. She tries to explain one more time that she was only protecting her daughter. She saw Thomas put his hands on her daughter's arms and thoughts went flashing through her head of things Thomas has done and could do to Hope. Ridge is staunch in his views. He saw what he saw. She pushed him off the cliff and he could have died. They are lucky he is still with them. She says she is sure he was frightened but so was she. And Ridge needs to understand what she saw. And why they went over to the cliff house in the first place because they knew Thomas would be there and were afraid. He says again that he saw what he saw and that was Brooke shoving his son so they are going to see this differently. He was not afraid when he went to Steffy's. He told her he would handle it. Now he is only concerned with what just happened in Thomas's room. She should be glad Thomas did not tell the detective the truth. In fact instead of badmouthing his son she should go in there and thank him. She cries no, she is not going to grovel and show her gratitude. It was an accident and she does not believe for a minute that Thomas's apology is real. She thinks he is still trying to manipulate Hope. Ridge says he does not believe Brooke. Thomas is still in the hospital because of her. She fires back that Thomas is in the hospital because of his sick, twisted obsession of Hope and it won't just end here. Thomas is going to have to pay for what he has done to Hope.",
