Katie begged Rick to give Ridge some time, but Rick said he needed to get the collection together. Katie looked worried and left.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Ridge and Caroline drew designs together, and Caroline said she was speechless. She told Ridge that she could feel how to draw the lines with him guiding her. Ridge said that her ability would grow with time. Caroline showed him more designs. \"Show me how to make it better,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge looked at one design and suggested she needed to remember simplicity and that less was more. On one design, he erased a few lines. \"A woman wears a dress not the other way around,\" he advised. Caroline worried that one design was too revealing. Ridge suggested adding a sleeve to a sleeveless dress.\" It's still sexy because it's classic,\" Caroline said. \"Now you're getting it,\" Ridge said and smiled.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline laughed. Caroline said he had made her designs \"jaw-dropping -- so far beyond my ability.\" Caroline urged Ridge to mentor her. \"I'd be so honored,\" she said. \"Why don't you take this and bring it to Rick. Tell him it's part of the collection,\" Ridge suggested. Caroline was excited. \"Thank you,\" she said.\n\n\nCaroline showed the designs to Rick, and Rick was impressed. Caroline told him that she and Ridge had collaborated on them. She said she had started with a rough sketch, and Ridge had made it better. She said she could feel his talent and brilliance. Rick said that he was proud of Caroline.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Katie joined Ridge, and he told her about his collaboration with Caroline. He was thrilled, and they hugged. Ridge admitted that he had trembled and panicked, but he put his hand on Caroline's hand and guided her in a design. They hugged again. \n\n\nKatie noted that Ridge had not lost his gift after all. \"Show me,\" she urged. Ridge tried, but he could not draw. He told Katie that it had been effortless with Caroline. Ridge said he knew his solution was to work with Caroline.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Ivy and Aly discussed photographs of Ivy's work. Ivy asked Aly to deliver the photos and pieces to Liam because she felt awkward. Aly noted that Liam and Ivy appeared to have had a great time at the end of summer party. Ivy admitted that she had enjoyed the time she'd spent with Liam. Aly begged for details. \"I'm dying to hear everything,\" she said.\n\n\nHidden from view, Hope stopped to eavesdrop on Ivy and Aly's conversation.\n\n\nIvy said that she and Liam had danced, and Aly said that was a positive move for Ivy. She added that they had kissed and held hands, and Liam had a new lease on life. Ivy wanted to see more of Liam.\n\n\nAly wondered if Hope regretted leaving Liam. Ivy said that Hope had to let go of Liam because she was married to Wyatt.\n\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" Hope said, and she interrupted Aly and Ivy. Hope encouraged Ivy and Aly to continue their conversation, but she was a bit snotty. Aly excused herself to deliver Ivy's jewelry designs and photos to Liam. Aly left.\n\n\nHope sat down, and Ivy encouraged Hope to say what she was thinking. Hope wondered if Ivy had been dating Liam. Ivy answered that there was nothing official, but she was looking forward to dating Liam. Hope haughtily said that she knew Liam better than anyone. He was wonderful, smart handsome, successful, and attractive. \n\n\nHope said that Liam needed time alone to process what had happened. Ivy didn't like Hope's interference. Ivy reminded Hope that she had dumped Liam and married his brother in minutes.\n\n\nSurprised at Ivy's attitude, Hope advised that Ivy had been a little out of line. Hope still cared about Liam. Even though she was married to Wyatt, she planned to look out for Liam. Ivy smiled. \"You can't have them both,\" she said. Hope was shocked. \n\n\nHope maintained that Liam didn't need a new relationship right away. \"Don't you think that's Liam's decision, and not yours?\" Ivy asked. Ivy continued to ask what Wyatt would think about Hope's concern for her ex. \"You've moved on; why can't he?\" Ivy asked.\n\n\nHope stammered that she was trying to help, but she also wondered how Ivy had fallen into the Seine. Ivy reminded Hope that it had not been Ivy's fault that Hope had decided not to wait a few more minutes for Liam. Ivy icily recalled that Hope had chosen to turn around and marry Liam's brother.\n\n\nIvy added that it was sad that Hope was a lot like her mother -- who had also dated two brothers. Hope was speechless. Angrily, Hope replied that she was nothing like her mother. \"Kind of looks the same from here,\" Ivy replied.\n\n\nHope advised Ivy that her remarks had been inappropriate because Ivy reported to Hope. Ivy argued that she was at Forrester because her uncle had invited her there \"because I'm a Forrester. It's my name and my family's business. You're a Logan,\" Ivy said. Hope replied that Ivy's jewelry was a part of the Hope for the Future line -- \"My line, my name. Show me some respect,\" Hope said. Ivy promised to show the respect that Hope deserved. Hope angrily left.\n\n\nAt Spencer in Liam's office, Liam flashed back to his wedding with Hope in Italy. He sighed deeply, and Aly showed up with Ivy's photos. They discussed that Liam had enjoyed his night out as a single guy. Liam teased that Aly was playing Cupid. \n\n\nAly knew it was early for a relationship, but she encouraged Liam to spend some time with Ivy. Aly said she had a selfish reason for matching Ivy and Liam up because it meant Liam would stay in the family. \"We'd get to keep you around,\" she said. Liam laughed and hugged Aly. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "At work, Liam sighs deeply but all he can concentrate on is his wedding to Hope in Italy. Ivy questions Ivy about what she wants to hear. Her and Liam at Bikini .and she got him out on the dance floor. That doesn't happen that often. Ivy says yeah he is too serious with Hope. She wants to loosen him up and have some fun. Aly says finally Ivy is admitting it. She likes Ivy with Liam. Ivy admits he has moved on since Hope is married to Wyatt. Hope walks up and hears this. She needs to show some shoots to Ivy so she sits down. Ivy realizes she heard what she and Aly said and tells Hope they probably need to talk about the elephant in the room. Hope asks if Ivy is officially dating Liam now. Ivy says not officially but if he asked she would not say no. Hope makes it clear that she thinks Ivy should say no. Hope says she can see where Ivy would be interested in Liam as he is handsome, smart and attractive, but he is just recently single and he is still processing that so she thinks Ivy's timing is off and she should stay away from him. Ridge helps Caroline by guiding her hand while he draws the designs. He says he could not do it without her. She says the same. He tells her to remember that the woman wears the dress not the other way around. Rick keeps hounding Katie that he is behind schedule and has not seen a single hint of a design from Ridge. He needs to know if there is some reason he is stonewalling. Ridge chose to come back to work so Rick has to see those designs today. Aly takes some jewels to Liam and proclaims that Ivy will be famous someday. He likes the sound of that. She realizes he is still getting used to being single but in the meantime she likes that he is seeing Ivy. Liam admits that being with Ivy is easy and she is fun but he is not rushing into anything with her. Aly says Ivy is family and they'd like to keep Liam around. Ivy tells Hope that she does not have to protect Liam from her. Hope says he does need a friend but he should not be rushing into another relationship. Ivy says it nicely but that it is really not any of Hope's business since she has her own husband. What will he say when he knows she is worried about Liam's love life? It ends below the belt when Ivy tells Hope that she is a Forrester. It is her name, it is her family business, her legacy and Hope is a Logan. This was after Hope reminded her that she was the boss. Hope gets somewhat catty when she asks if anyone saw Ivy being pushed into the Seine. Ivy takes offense that Hope might be insinuating that she fell in on her own. Then Ivy even adds that blood tells . Hope is so much like her mother, involved with two brothers at the same time. Hope tells her that Ivy should show more respect. She was brought here to help with her line, her name. Ivy counters with yes absolutely, as much as she deserves. Ridge shows Katie the sketch he made with Caroline and infers that it just came to him. She's ecstatic but when she asks him to repeat it, he can't. Rick loves it though and thinks it is a knockout. Caroline gives most of the credit to Ridge and explains how Ridge guided her hand. Ridge explains to Katie that his hand was on Caroline's and he guided her hand but it was his ideas. He can finish the collection that way.",
