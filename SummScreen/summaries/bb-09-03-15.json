    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the loft, Ridge was glad that the morose Caroline had agreed to see him. Touching her hands, he said he'd been wrong, and he wanted her back. He was sorry for the choices he'd made the previous night. He'd only wanted to do what was best for her, but after some thought, he'd concluded that he wanted to be with her. He hoped she wanted the same thing.\n\n\nCaroline didn't understand what had changed. Ridge had been torn apart inside when he'd called Caroline the previous night. He'd wanted to crawl through the phone, hold her, and tell her that it would be okay. He said they were a team and faced challenges together. He stated that it was what they were about. He hoped it was what they were still about because he wanted her back.\n\n\nCaroline stared at the portrait Ridge had painted of her. Ridge said he'd always see her that way, but she murmured that she wasn't the same. He figured it was because of what he'd done He began to say how loyal she was, but she said to stop it. She couldn't hear words like that from him again, ever.\n\n\nCaroline didn't know why they were talking because he'd said he couldn't give her a child. Recalling the unconditional love of his parents, he said no one knew what their hearts were capable of until they held their child for the first time, and he couldn't have her miss out on it.\n\n\nCaroline looked away. When she looked back at Ridge, he was holding a straw bassinet with baby items in it. She choked back tears as she stared at it. Growing tearful, Ridge said he had to be around because their baby would be the most amazing baby in the world. \"Our baby?\" she repeated.\n\n\n\"I know I said it couldn't be me, but it has to be me,\" Ridge stated. He couldn't lose Caroline. He conveyed that it might not be that day, but sometime that year, they'd do it. They'd have a kid together. \"We will?\" the stunned Caroline replied. Agreeing, he hugged her.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Thomas was preoccupied with thoughts of the night with Caroline. Pam ducked her head in to remind him of a meeting in Ridge's office. Thomas wanted to know if Ridge and Caroline were in the office, but Pam didn't know. Thomas decided to pass on the meeting.\n\n\nPam left, and Brooke arrived. She could tell that Caroline was on Thomas' mind. Brooke revealed that Ridge and Caroline had broken up. Brooke relayed that Ridge wouldn't let Caroline sacrifice having children, and Thomas concluded that Ridge had sacrificed the relationship instead.\n\n\nBrooke said Ridge had called to check on Caroline, who'd been upset. Brooke believed Caroline was strong, would get through it, and would find a man to give her what Ridge couldn't. Brooke figured that Caroline had people to lean on, and if anyone could help Caroline through it, it would be Thomas.\n\n\nThomas inquired about Ridge's call to Caroline the previous night. Brooke started to explain Ridge's feelings. When she stammered, Thomas suspected that Ridge had told her something no one else knew. Brooke said it was Caroline who needed a confidant. \"Don't look at me,\" Thomas replied. Brooke didn't know why and said Caroline trusted him completely -- unless something had changed.\n\n\nBrooke left, and Thomas flashed back on Caroline raging at him about their night together.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Wyatt thought of his talk with Steffy the other night. Ivy arrived with a press release about her position. Wyatt said it was what she'd wanted, and she replied that it was what Aly had wanted. Wyatt asked if Ivy had copies of the video. Ivy asked what he thought. She said it was her secret weapon against Steffy, and Ivy didn't plan to take any chances.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Steffy told Liam about her talk with Wyatt. They believed that Ivy and Wyatt were still bitter that Steffy and Liam had reunited over choosing Wyatt and Ivy. Steffy was worried that she could get arrested at any moment, but Liam said it wouldn't go down like that. She didn't believe Wyatt wanted to use the video, and she and Liam hoped Wyatt would make the right choice.\n\n\nWyatt and Ivy arrived for the meeting. Steffy explained that Ridge had said to start without him and Caroline. Liam decided he'd fill the absent Thomas in later. Liam announced that it was time to plan Ivy's first photo shoot, and he'd gotten permission to use Bill's yacht in Monte Carlo. Ivy liked the idea at first, but growing suspicious, she asked why they wanted to get her out of the country.\n\n\nSteffy called Ivy paranoid. Wyatt took exception to the statement, but Steffy replied that he knew Ivy wasn't doing right with the video. Ivy said she should have gone to the police a long time back about the video, but Steffy showed her gratefulness by making demands all the time. Steffy asked where Ivy got off accusing Steffy of something she knew Steffy would never do.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that everyone was sorry for Aly's death, but it had been self-defense. Ivy asked why Steffy would be so concerned about the video. Ivy answered her own question by assuming it was because Steffy wasn't so innocent and had taken Aly's life. Steffy was tired of denying murder. Ivy said that Steffy should try admitting to it because confession was good for the soul.\n\n\nSteffy stated that she had nothing to confess to and hadn't wanted any of it. Ivy said she hadn't wanted any of it, either. Ivy wished Liam and Steffy would understand that Ivy was doing it to honor Aly, but instead, they were too busy trying to figure out how to get Ivy out of the country.\n\n\nIvy stormed out. Liam decided to follow her, claiming he was the one she was upset with. Alone with Steffy, Wyatt said it couldn't go on like that. Steffy told him to get rid of the video. \"Or did anything I say get through to you?\" she asked. He said it had -- in more ways than she knew.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Wyatt would delete the video and its copies. Wyatt replied that he was considering it. Closing the door, Steffy decided that they needed to make a deal. She told Wyatt that no matter what Ivy's motives were, Ivy needed to be dealt with once and for all.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Liam located Ivy staring at her video. \"Delete it. You know you want to,\" he said. Ivy said what she wanted was for Steffy to admit it. Liam insisted that the video didn't show everything, but Ivy replied that it would show enough to interest police. Liam claimed that he wasn't blind to Steffy like Ivy thought he was, and he wasn't blind to what Ivy was doing.\n\n\nIvy looked away in frustration, but Liam asked her to look at him. When she did, he said she was a good person, but her actions were changing and consuming her. He asked her to stop controlling Steffy's life and to heal and move on before things backfired on her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge lets a very subdued Caroline into the loft and asks what is wrong. At work, Thomas relives making love or at least telling Caroline they did and her reaction. She was disgusted. Wyatt remembers Steffy telling him that he has to let Ivy do the right thing and help Steffy. Ivy gloats to Wyatt about her being the face of Forrester. She says it is what Aly would have wanted. He asks about any other copies of the video and she says yes that is her insurance. She could not take a chance on just one copy. Steffy tells Liam but he says that is not how this is going to go down. He does not think they will go to the police even though it looks like Wyatt and Ivy are still on the fence. She only hopes he comes to his senses. Liam tells Wyatt and Ivy that they can start without Ridge, but he wants to get started with Ivy being the face of Forrester. And he laments that the yacht is available and Monte Carlo would be a good place to start. Ivy wonders if they are trying to get her out of the country for some reason. Liam says no, this is business. Ivy says her gut is saying something else. She should have taken that video to the police a long time ago. Steffy is not innocent. Aly's life was taken by Steffy. Alone Steffy tells Wyatt again to get rid of the video and all of this will be over. Ridge tells Caroline that he wants what is best for her and he still wants a life with her if she wants the same thing. He knows after what happened last night it is probably the last thing she is expecting to hear. They are a team and they will have challenges but they will do it together. He says he wants her back. Brooke asks Thomas if he has seen Caroline today. He admits not. She says she and Ridge broke up. But Caroline is strong and she will bounce back. Thomas thinks Brooke knows more than she is saying and Ridge has confided something in her. Caroline tells Ridge to stop saying that. She can not hear him say that again. Why is he bringing this up again? He says he can not have her miss out on having their child, seeing and holding it for the first time. Liam follows Ivy as she re-watches the video and he slips up behind her and tells her to delete it. It does not show the entire thing and he knows she is blind to Steffy. He knows Ivy is a good person and this is not her. She needs to heal too and let this vendetta against Steffy go. Wyatt tells Steffy there are more copies and he is considering what she said. She wants to make a deal. Ivy must be dealt with, once and for all. Ridge says he knows Caroline will be an amazing mother and he has to be there for that. He can not lose her. Maybe not this year, but sometimes they will have this baby. She looks conflicted and confused. He hugs her.",
