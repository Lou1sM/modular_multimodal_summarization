    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach house, Hope entered, and Wyatt greeted her. She murmured that she'd had an interesting day, and Wyatt offered to microwave a pizza and pour out a bag of salad for her. After kissing her, Wyatt showed her a bottle of wine that a neighbor had dropped off as a gift.\n\n\nWyatt mentioned that Ivy's designs were good, and Ivy might be giving his mother a run for her money. Hope cut her eyes at him and said that Ivy might be more like his mother than they had realized.\n\n\nGuessing she was being overly sensitive, Hope revealed that Ivy had made it clear that she was a Forrester, and Hope was a Logan. Wyatt corrected that Hope was a Spencer. Hope said she'd been getting heritage grief for \"so long,\" first from Steffy and next from Ivy. Wyatt advised Hope to stay confident in her talents and her contributions to the business.\n\n\nHope stated that it wasn't just the business, and she was a little uncomfortable with Ivy's behavior. Wyatt asked what Ivy had done, and half-chuckling, Hope stated that Ivy had kissed Liam. Wyatt was excited to hear that Liam was moving on and had kissed Ivy. Hope said it had happened twice, and she believed Ivy had been doing the kissing.\n\n\nWyatt exclaimed that it was good for Liam, but Hope snipped that it wasn't the best idea, and it was too soon. She believed Liam had things that he needed to work through. Wyatt didn't see what the big deal was, but Hope asked what kind of woman pursued a man after the kind of breakup that she and Liam had had. Wyatt looked away, and Hope said it made her question Ivy's character.\n\n\nHope felt that Liam was vulnerable, which made Ivy seem opportunistic. Wyatt wished the best for Liam but didn't care who Liam kissed as long as it wasn't Hope. Wyatt understood that Hope wanted to protect Liam. Wyatt did, too, but preferred not to talk about Liam in Wyatt's home with Wyatt's wife.\n\n\nWyatt kissed Hope, and she conceded to stop talking about it. Just as Wyatt relaxed, Hope said it might not be an issue any longer because she \"might have\" told Ivy to back off. Wyatt's nostrils flared, and with a mad chuckle, he asked, \"What is happening right now?\"\n\n\nHope asked if she'd been out of line. \"Telling Ivy to step off your ex? I can see why she'd take offense to that,\" Wyatt responded. Hope claimed to be protecting Liam, but Wyatt said Liam probably didn't want her to. Hope agreed, but clenching her fists, she said there was just something about Ivy.\n\n\nWyatt didn't think it was weird that his brother and Ivy were drawn to each other and suggested that Hope let it play out. \"No. I don't think Liam is attracted to her,\" Hope decided. She believed Liam was looking for a friend to lean on and didn't need someone making moves on him so soon. \"He's a guy. We don't ever not need that,\" Wyatt replied.\n\n\nHope insisted that Liam needed time, and Wyatt was sure that Liam would be okay. Wyatt asked Hope to see Ivy's perspective. Liam was the hero who'd jumped in to save her. Hope curtly nodded.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill encouraged Liam to leave work and get to Ivy's barbeque that evening. Bill noted that his son, who looked skinny and peaked, needed some meat. Liam nodded, and Bill said he understood that Liam was upset over losing Hope and disappointed in Wyatt, but Bill urged Liam to keep living. \"Yeah, yeah, I know. I mean, another night alone with Bu...\" Liam said.\n\n\nBill asserted that spending nights with the cat was depressing, but Liam reasoned that the feline was cute. Just then, the office door opened, and a chipper and leather-clad Quinn arrived. \"Speaking of felines,\" Bill murmured. Quinn claimed she had no swords, and she wouldn't touch either of theirs -- unless they wanted her to.\n\n\nLiam quipped that he always got physically ill in Quinn's presence. Quinn was sure there was a pill for that. \"How about a vaccination?\" Bill quipped. Liam hurriedly strode out, and Bill asked what \"Morticia\" wanted. \"So many things, Bill, and I'm sure they're not legal,\" she replied, chuckling. Bill stared expressionlessly at her, and she asked if Brooke had prohibited his sense of humor.\n\n\nBill said that he was happy that Wyatt had found a life with Hope; however, Liam was Bill's son, too, and Bill also wanted Liam to be happy. Quinn thought it was time for Liam to move on, and she guessed he could do so with Poison Ivy. Bill gathered that Quinn had a beef with Ivy. Shrugging Quinn said she simply didn't like the weak damsel in distress who'd fallen into the Seine.\n\n\nWaving her finger, Quinn touted that she could have predicted Liam's rescue effort from a mile away. In her view, Mr. Goodie-two-shoes and Miss Prim-and-Proper were a match made in heaven. Bill thought it was odd that Quinn was \"mad\" at Ivy for falling into the Seine. He reasoned that the incident had caused the marriage of Wyatt and Hope.\n\n\nBill wondered what the odds were that Ivy would fall off the bridge and Liam would jump in to rescue her, thereby missing his rendezvous with Hope. Quinn nodded, all starry-eyed and proud. \"Talk about fate doing its -- \" Bill pondered. Suddenly, he stopped speaking and looked at Quinn. \"Wait a minute. It was you? Did you knock her over?\" Bill demanded to know.\n\n\nAt first, Quinn scoffed indignantly, but she couldn't stop herself from smiling. \"It was some of my best work,\" she bragged, grinning. Bill couldn't even believe it and asked what Quinn had been doing in Paris. Speaking in a blameless tone, Quinn said she'd jumped on Ivy and Liam's flight in disguise. \"Well, if we didn't know it already -- you are completely insane!\" Bill raged.\n\n\nQuinn defended that she wouldn't have been able to live with herself if she hadn't taken care of that one little detail. \"And look what happened, Bill! Success!\" she exalted, jumping up and down. Bill glared at her, but she exclaimed that Hope and Wyatt couldn't be happier.\n\n\nPunctuating each word as he spoke, Bill asserted that she'd messed up Liam's life. \"Do you not get that I have three sons -- not just Wyatt -- to worry about?\" he yelled. Quinn replied that she only had one son, and she'd do what she had to, just like Bill.\n\n\nBill decided that Hope and Liam needed to know what Quinn had done, and he guessed he'd have to tell them because Quinn wouldn't. Quinn asked if Bill knew why he wouldn't tell it.\n\n\nAt the mansion, an Australian barbie was underway. Rick thanked Ivy for feeding him and Caroline while Eric was away. As Oliver cooked kabobs, Caroline was surprised that Liam would be there. Aly explained that Ivy was really falling for Liam. Caroline asked if it was wise. Aly said Ivy wasn't pushing things and just wanted to see him smile again.\n\n\nLiam arrived with a bottle of wine and checked out the Outback decorations. Greeting him, Ivy asked if he liked the decor. She thought he'd needed a vacation, and since he couldn't get to the Outback, she decided to take the Outback to him. Caroline announced that they were having lamb chops, but Ivy told Liam that she'd gotten him some prawns and yabbies, if he felt adventurous.\n\n\nRick asked what a yabby was, and Ivy replied that it was a fresh-water crayfish, popular in Australia. Next, Ivy asked everyone to try some \"veg spread.\" Oliver warned that it was an acquired taste. Liam's face soured at first bite, but Caroline liked the salty flavor. In a terrible Australian accent, Oliver joked that Caroline should take a selfie of her first time tasting veg spread.\n\n\nLiam's phone chimed, and Aly and Ivy exchanged glances as he became preoccupied with the device. Ivy announced that no one was going anywhere until she taught them to throw a boomerang. She grew anxious but smiled as she stared at Liam, who wasn't listening as he looked at his phone.\n\n\nAfter dinner, the guests returned to the living room, and Caroline slapped Liam's hand as she told him to get off the phone. Apologizing, Liam said he'd been swamped with messages ever since Bill had returned as CEO. Caroline replied that he was supposed to be having fun, and Rick asked Oliver to hand another beer to Liam, who murmured that he'd do tequila if it would help.\n\n\nOn the terrace, Aly tried to assure Ivy that Liam was having a good time. Ivy replied that he was thinking about Hope. Ivy confided that she and Hope had had a little chat after Hope had overheard Aly and Ivy talking earlier, and Hope had advised her to leave him alone because he was still processing. Aly didn't get it because Hope was married. Aly believed that Liam really liked Ivy and was just -- \"Processing,\" Ivy concluded. Ivy said she'd wanted him to have a good time that night, but Hope might be right in saying it was too soon.\n\n\nLater, people started leaving. When Oliver and Aly invited Liam and Ivy to join them for ice cream, Ivy perked up. She smiled sadly when Liam declined. Oliver and Aly left, and Liam told Ivy that he was ready to go. too. Ivy downplayed her disappointment as she thanked him for joining the party. He stated that he'd had a good time, even if it hadn't seemed like it.\n\n\nIvy told Liam that she really liked him, but because of the breakup, she didn't want to seem like she was pressuring or chasing him. She concluded that the evening had been a bad idea. \"Because I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you that I kind of had -- kind of had -- my hopes up,\" she added. He stammered for what to say, but she decided to just leave it at a \"g'day or g'night, Mate.\"\n\n\nIvy walked over to the coffee table and began anxiously folding napkins and waiting to hear the door close behind Liam, so she could break down in private. Instead, Liam's hand grazed over her shoulder. Surprised, she turned. He pulled her in for a kiss and uttered that the night wasn't over yet. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ivy hosts an Australian-themed barbeque at the Forrester mansion and invites her closest friends. Liam becomes a bit concerned when he realizes that everyone at the barbeque is coupled up. Quinn pays a visit to Bill and makes a bold confession, hoping that he will become her ally. Hope shares her feelings about the possibility of Liam moving on with Ivy to Wyatt.",
    "tvmega_recap": "A tired, frazzled Hope comes home and is greeted by happy hubby with a kiss. She wraps her arms around his neck and says it feels so good to be home. He says he got them a pizza and a bag of salad for later. He quips that he is still getting used to this whole husband thing and microwaving for the two of them. And it's not just pizza but her favorite with a lethal amount of garlic so he better kiss her now with a preemptive strike. With Eric out of town, Ivy steps in as hostess and is having an Australian barbecue for a group or a barbie as they call it back home. Oliver says he is the grill master. Liam tells Bill that he is supposed to be there right now. Bill tells him to get out of here and go get some barbecue, he is looking sort of peaked and skinny right now. He says he knows Liam is dealing with a lot right now with losing Hope and he is disappointed in his brother so go hang out with his friends, have a few beers and have fun. Don't stop living. Liam says he knows Bill is right and he can't keep spending every night with Boo. Bill says that is sad, spending all his nights with a cat, very sad. Liam says and it was very kind of Ivy to invite him so he'll be on his way. However, before he gets out, Quinn knocks on Bill's door and comes in. He gives that perturbed look and asks why she is there. She tells them to calm down. She has no sword and she will not touch either of theirs unless they want her to. Liam starts to leave and says he gets physically ill when she is around. She quips that he ought to see a doctor as she thinks there is a pill for that. Bill adds or a vaccination. He asks Morticia what she wants. She says a lot of things .most of them probably not legal. When he doesn't laugh, she says Brooke must have taken away his sense of humor. Bill grouses that he is happy Hope is with Wyatt but he also wants his other son to be happy too. Quinn says maybe he can move on with this Ivy .Poison Ivy. Wyatt tells Hope that he doesn't want to talk shop all night but wonders if she has had a chance to see some of Ivy's designs. She's really not bad and gonna give his mother a run for her money in designing jewelry. Hope says hmmmm, Ivy may be more like his mother than he even realizes. Wyatt isn't sure what she means by that. Aly tells Caroline that Ivy really did good in putting this together tonight and she is excited. She is really beginning to fall for Liam. Caroline is not sure that is a good idea so soon. The place is all decorated and Ivy says they need a vacation and since they could not go to Australia, she would bring it here. They are having juicy lamb chops but Oliver asks Liam if he'd like a veggie burger. Ivy says if he really is adventurous she has some yabby for him and then he really should try some veg spread which is probably the most popular food they have in Australia. Oliver says it definitely is an acquired taste. Liam samples some and he says whoa, no he doesn't hate it, but it is weird and unique. Ivy says she wanted to give them a real authentic Australian experience and no one is going anywhere until she teaches them how to throw a boomerang correctly. Wyatt asks Hope what she meant by Ivy and his mother being alike or what they have in common. Hope laments that perhaps she is being overly sensitive but they sort of got into it today. Ivy wanted to make it clear that Hope is a Logan and Ivy is a Forrester. Wyatt says that really doesn't matter and now she is a Spencer. Hope says she knows but first she was getting it from Steffy and now Ivy. Hope admits it's not only business but she is a little uncomfortable with Ivy being here at all. She tells Wyatt that Ivy and Liam kissed. Wyatt laughs and says he did not know his brother had game. Hope says she thinks it was the other way around. Ivy kissed him twice. Wyatt laughs again and says good for his bro for moving on. He doesn't understand when Hope says she is not sure it is a good idea to move on so fast. Liam needs time to process things. Wyatt said it was just two kisses. It is not like she is moving in with him. Hope says she knows, but what kind of woman would pursue a man after a recent breakup. It just speaks for her character. Liam is venerable right now and sort of makes her look like an opportunist. Wyatt says he wishes the best for his brother and it doesn't matter who he dates or who he kisses as long as it is not her. He thinks it is natural for her to be concerned and feel badly for him, want to protect him. So does he but he'd really like not to talk about his brother in their home with his beautiful wife. She says okay and it might not be an issue soon as she sort of told Ivy to back off. Both Aly and Ivy notice Liam taking a lot of messages and sort of ignoring them. Rick asks Oliver to bring Liam another beer. Liam says he would be knee deep in tequila if he thought it would help. Caroline finally tells Liam that he is supposed to be having fun, so get off the phone. He says ever since Bill has been back as CEO, his e-mails have taken over. Caroline says he will get through this. It will just take a little time. Aly tells Ivy that Liam is having fun but .Ivy says she knows. He is still thinking about Hope. She tells Aly about her convo with Hope. Perhaps she is right and it is too soon. She really just wants him to have fun and let loose. Bill says Poison Ivy; does Quinn have a beef with her. Quinn says no, she's just weak .damsel in distress and has to have Liam dive in the Seine for her. Bill reminds her that if she hadn't then Liam would be married to Hope right now and not to Wyatt so she'd be planning her next takedown instead of her victory dance right now. He says talk about fate and then it hits him. He asks Quinn was she there, did she do this? She scoffs at first then admits it was some of her best work .she did what had to be done. He says if she doesn't know already she is completely insane. She says she could not live with herself if she hadn't taken care of this one last detail. He says Hope and Wyatt need to know this and since he knows she will not tell them he will. Quinn laughs ad says he will not say a thing and she will tell him why. Wyatt tells Hope that it is sweet of her to protect Liam but he probably wouldn't want her to. And he could see why it might irritate Ivy. He tells her she just needs to let this play out .let Liam figure it out for himself. And he really doesn't think it is weird for either of them to be attracted to each other. Hope says she really doesn't think Liam is attracted to Ivy. He just needs someone to lean on but he doesn't need someone to make moves on him so soon. Wyatt says Liam is a guy and guys never do not need that. He tries to convince her that Liam will be okay. And just look at it from Ivy's prospective. Liam is her hero; he jumped in The Seine to save her. The party breaks up and Aly and Oliver say goodbye. Oliver says they are going for ice creme and he's buying if they are interested. Liam says rain check. He tells Ivy that he thinks he will head out to. He thanks her for inviting him and says he had a good time whether he showed it or not. She smiles a big smile and tells him that she really likes him. She knows he is going through a bad time right now and she doesn't want to put any pressure on him or seem like she is chasing him. Maybe tonight was a really bad idea cause she would be lying if she didn't say she really had her hopes up. So maybe they should just say G'day or goodnight and let it go at that. She turns with a disappointed look on her face to clean up. Liam taps her on the shoulder and turns her around and leans in and kisses her. He says, \"night's not over yet.\"",
