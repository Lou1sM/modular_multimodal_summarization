    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge and Quinn were stuck in an elevator because Sheila and Charlie had arranged it. Charlie and Sheila watched on a video camera, unseen by Quinn or Ridge. Sheila shouted at the video screen and encouraged Ridge to \"kiss your father's wife.\" Charlie wanted to stop, but Sheila sputtered that she called the shots. Sheila was convinced that Quinn wanted Ridge, and they would kiss.\n\n\nInside the elevator, Quinn and Ridge couldn't believe no one had heard them shouting for help, and the emergency call was also not working. No one was helping them. They discussed that they'd missed each other. Ridge said he missed who they'd been together. He wanted their friendship again, but giving up her friendship was important so that she -- and also his dad -- would be happy.\n\n\nQuinn and Ridge were close to each other in the elevator. Quinn put her hand on his shoulder and said she was sure they could make it work. \"I plan to make it my life's mission to repair your relationship with your father,\" she said. She added that Eric had forgiven her, and she needed to convince him to forgive Ridge, as well. Quinn also encouraged Ridge to repair his relationship with Brooke. Ridge didn't think that was possible.\n\n\nSheila and Charlie continued to watch from the security office. Charlie had had enough. He pushed a button to open the elevator door, and Sheila was unhappy.\n\n\n\"We're free,\" Quinn said. She and Ridge stepped out of the elevator, and Quinn left to find Ivy. Ridge went directly to Charlie's office. Sheila hid in the closet in Charlie's office, and Ridge entered. \"Something's wrong with the elevator,\" Ridge said. He insisted that Charlie call the company to make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. Charlie mentioned that it had to have been scary for Ridge and Quinn. \"I didn't mention Quinn,\" Ridge said. Charlie said the \"eye in the sky\" had shown him that she was there. Ridge understood, and he left.\n\n\nSheila exited her hiding place and said Charlie had almost given it all away. She told him she had another assignment for him. She was confident that she would be able to show Eric that Quinn didn't deserve him, and Sheila would finally be his wife again.\n\n\nAt Spencer Publications, Bill, Thomas, Wyatt, Steffy, Liam, Sally, Caroline, Lieutenant Baker, and several police officers were present, and Liam argued with his father about the fire he had admitted to being involved in at the Spectra building. \"You were wrong to call them here,\" Bill said.\n\n\nLiam defended his decision to turn his father in. Bill argued and told everyone that it was all a joke. Liam disagreed and said he never should have agreed to the lie about Caroline's life-threatening diagnosis. Caroline agreed she should never have gone along with it.\n\n\nBill told the police that Justin would be there soon to clear up the confusion. Justin entered, and Bill noted that Justin hadn't even needed to be summoned. However, Justin said that Liam had already summoned him because company bylaws stated that if Bill were incarcerated, the company president would assume control. \"That would be me. I'm in charge now,\" Liam said. He promised to make changes, revamp benefits, and add charity work.\n\n\nBill smirked and called Liam a do-gooder. Bill encouraged the officers to arrest him so that he could get back before the end of the day. \"You're not coming back,\" Wyatt said. Steffy agreed. \"You got caught,\" she said.\n\n\nBill sputtered that he would not allow \"this bozo\" -- referring to Liam -- to ruin his company. He told the officers that he had been kidding when he had confessed to Liam that he'd had anything to do with the Spectra fire. He claimed he said things \"to get a rise out of people all the time.\" Sally interrupted and said that Bill had repeatedly attacked her company. Bill scoffed that they had a design thief as a character witness.\n\n\n\"Bill, I need to insist that you be quiet,\" Justin said. Bill continued to belittle Liam, and Liam pulled off the sword necklace that Bill had given him and threw it on the ground. Baker said even the smartest criminals got caught. Liam noted that Baker had called his father a criminal.\n\n\nLiam promised that the company, his legacy, and his name would not be associated with a criminal. Bill threatened Liam that he would get Liam back with his last breath. \"You will pay for this,\" Bill roared. The officers handcuffed Bill, and Baker read him his rights. Bill tried to go after Liam. Steffy looked uneasily at Liam and then Bill.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy called out Liam's name. Liam shook his head and stopped daydreaming about having Bill arrested. Steffy quizzed Liam about having his father arrested. \"He'll never forgive you,\" she said. However, she agreed with Liam that Bill deserved it. Thomas entered and said that he had stopped to say goodbye. He was headed back to New York with Caroline.\n\n\nLiam wondered how Thomas could leave Sally and Spectra, but Thomas insisted he had to do it for his family. Steffy hugged her brother and wished him well. Liam was angry. He stopped Thomas, but Steffy insisted that Thomas had a plane to catch.\n\n\nLiam wondered how Thomas could leave. Thomas answered that it was important for him to be with his family and be grateful for the time he and his family had together. Liam asked about Sally, and Steffy interrupted that it was all Thomas' decision. Thomas answered that Sally knew he had to be in New York for a while. Steffy hugged Thomas again, and he left.\n\n\nLiam asked Steffy why she'd stopped him from telling the truth. \"Because he's happy,\" Steffy said. She added that the truth would confuse his son, and questions about the lie that Bill had started about Caroline's health would also raise more suspicions about the Spectra fire. Steffy insisted that Liam had to think about everyone before he turned his father in.\n\n\nLiam wanted to tear off his sword necklace. Liam lamented that Bill had wanted to create a clone of himself. Steffy understood. \"But do you really want him in prison? I don't know if you'll be able to live with yourself,\" she said. Liam said for the first time in his life, he had power over his father.\n\n\nAt Spencer Publications. Caroline entered Bill's office with Douglas and apologized to Bill for her earlier temper tantrum. She said that she and Thomas were returning to New York. She wondered if Liam would tell anyone about the lie they had fabricated that she was dying. Bill said that Liam had better not tell anyone.\n\n\nBill had to take a call from C.J. Garrison, who hoped to set up a meeting with Bill about his burned-out Spectra property. C.J. said that he had spoken to his mother, and he hoped that Bill was still interested. Bill acted disinterested but suggested C.J. schedule a meeting with his secretary. \"We'll see if we can work something out,\" Bill said.\n\n",
    "imdb": "Justin walks into Bill's office and finds Liam staging a coup to take over Spencer Publications while Lt. Baker is taking Bill into custody for putting Spectra on fire. Suddenly, Liam awakes from his vivid daydream - Steffy asks her husband if he is actually willing to put his father behind bars. Thomas stops by to say his goodbyes and Liam reluctantly keeps quiet. After Thomas is gone, Liam and Steffy argue whether revealing Bill's lie would have an effect on his decision to stay in New York. Meanwhile, Caroline pays Bill another visit, but he reassures his niece that Thomas will stay with his family. Sheila continues to manipulate Charlie. Watching every move of Quinn and Ridge trapped in the elevator on the closed circuit camera, Sheila takes a photo that could pass as incriminating evidence to Eric that his wife and son still share feelings for another. Sheila's pious hope does not come true though, as Ridge and Quinn are indeed very close - but as friends. They use the time to reflect on ways to repair their relationship with Eric. Not able to hear them, Sheila mistakes their sentiment for lust. When Charlie cannot take it anymore, he hits the button which releases the elevator. Later, when Ridge questions him about the incident, Charlie nearly discloses the truth by accident.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill says enough apologies. He'd do it again with no regrets to get his niece and Thomas back together. He warns Liam to tell the truth and tell all of them this is not true. Quinn tells Ridge that if she has to be stuck with anyone in the elevator it might as well be with her best friend. Sheila continues to stand over Charlie's shoulder looking at footage and he tells her it is time to let them out of the elevator. She says no it is her that gets to decide that. She urges Ridge to go ahead and kiss Quinn; she knows he wants to. Justin comes into Bill's office but instead of being in Bill's corner he says according to bylaws if Bill cannot run the country then it falls to Liam. Bill puts his hands out and tells them to take him away as quickly as possible and get this over with. Liam says he is calling the shots now and he will not let this company be run by a criminal which is what Bill is. Ridge tells Quinn that it feels nice for her to say she missed him. He hopes they can remain friends now that she is back with his dad. She puts her hands on his shoulder and says she too does not want to lose that bond. And she is going to make it her life mission to help him with his quest with Eric and Brooke. Bill tells Lt. Baker he will have to question him right now. He is not leaving this Bozo in charge for one more second. Then he starts in on Sally, the character witness. Lt. Baker reads Bill his rights to remain silent. He shouts he will not remain silent. He turns to Liam and says he was the son who came out of nowhere and he gave him the keys to the kingdom and he will be sorry for this. Steffy calls out Liam's name and he comes out of his foggy fantasy as she asks if he really wants to put his father through this by turning him in. Sheila is disappointed that neither Quinn nor Ridge are making a move toward each other. Charlie says she has photos and that is as far as it goes. Suddenly the elevator is open; Quinn and Ridge are free. Quinn says she will go find Ivy to say she is still alive. Ridge goes to find Charlie and he says it was just unfortunate timing. It won't happen again. Liam says he is not doing this just for Sally but for himself as well. Thomas comes in and says he is heading back to New York. He wanted to give Caroline a little more time to say goodbye to Bill. He does not know when he will be back. Steffy says it sounds like he is leaving permanently. Thomas laments it feels right. Liam asks about Sally. Thomas says he is doing what he has to do and Sally knows that. He has to be with his son; that is the most important thing. Steffy hugs him but Liam tells him to wait.

She says now he is. CJ calls Bill and says something unfortunate has happened. There was a fire at Spectra. He has been talking to his mom a lot and they have come up with a plan. He'd like to meet if Bill still wants the Spectra property. Bill plays coy and says okay, just set up an appointment with his secretary and they can discuss it. Thomas says goodbye and Liam asks Steffy why did she stop him from telling Thomas. Liam says no he doesn't want his father in jail but he did wrong and needs to be held responsible. He holds onto his sword necklace and says that once meant something to him but not anymore. He is not his father and never will be. She says she knows he wants to do the right thing but she does not believe that means Bill going to prison. Liam says he does not know. He knows he has power now for the first time in his life .power over his father.",
