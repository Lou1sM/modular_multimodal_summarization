Despite initial concerns that Brooke is rushing into marriage with Bill, Ridge, Steffy, Thomas and Rick eventually agree that it is their only chance to get the Forrester stock and Quinn out of their lives. A new regulation at Forrester Creations, implemented by Quinn and a now healthy-lifestyle-oriented Eric, leaves a bad taste in Pam's mouth: her famous lemon bars are no longer welcome in the office! Shortly after Eric has assured Quinn that nothing will get in the way of their happiness, Ridge and Steffy inform Quinn that her days at the company and in Eric's life are numbered.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge is not happy that Brooke is engaged to Bill. He would not wish that on anyone. But he does explain to Rick, Steffy and Thomas that with the wedding comes Bill's shares that he will give Brooke as a wedding gift. Brooke will sell to him and with that he has what he needs to get rid of Quinn so that is all that matters now. He tells them he knows Rick still has his concerns and wants to be CEO again but he assures him he will always have a place in the company with Maya and little Lizzy. They will protect Eric's legacy as his days are numbered. Eric does a good workout and tells Quinn that he lost five pounds. He doesn't know what happened to them but he has lost them. Pam walks in with her lemon bars which Quinn nixes and even convinces Eric they need to avoid these and try something healthier. Quinn conveys to Eric that Ridge keeps telling her that it is only a matter of time until she is leaving. Eric retorts that Ridge can say that all he wants but he wants her here and she is not going anywhere. As much as he loves Ridge and his family he is not living his life for him. He declares Quinn as his own Fountain of Youth. Thomas tells Rick that Quinn must not know of these shares until Brooke actually marries Bill and she gets the shares. Ridge tells Quinn that the whole family is united against her. Quinn says they are treating Eric less than a man he is. He is working out, eating better and having sex. He's in the middle of a renaissance so they should be grateful. Steffy says no they will never be grateful to her. Rick tells Thomas perhaps Eric needs to see a doctor. But Brooke and Thomas say he will be suspicious of that and push him even closer to Quinn and they do not want that. Brooke tells Rick that she is very comfortable with her decision and now with Bill's shares they will be able to get rid of Quinn. Quinn tells Steffy all she has to do is separate her feelings for Quinn and stop punishing her for everything. Despite all they have gone through she says she loves Steffy and she waited too long for love and she loves Eric and she does not want to let him go. Eric comes in as they are arguing and tells him this is enough. As long as he is the patriarch and the founder of this company they will respect him and that means accepting Quinn too. Ridge looks at Steffy and repeats \"Yeah, as long as he is head of this company.\"",
