Thomas congratulated the couple, and as Ridge hugged Caroline, she seemed to snarl at Thomas, who then closed the door behind him.\n\n\nThomas went to work and interrupted Brooke, who was working in the CEO's office. He informed her that he'd been accepted to the design team. Brooke thought it was great. She'd known Ridge would \"come through.\" Thomas said that Ridge had in more ways than one.\n\n\nLater, Brooke couldn't believe Caroline and Ridge had reunited. \"A bassinet -- seriously?\" Brooke asked Thomas. Thomas said Ridge had changed his mind and was committed to children with Caroline. Flashing back to the conversation about Ridge's vasectomy, Brooke replied that nothing was certain.\n\n\nBrooke said it wasn't even what Ridge, who enjoyed living in the moment, wanted. Thomas replied that it was just like the impulsive Ridge. Brooke believed Thomas had been right to worry about Caroline, who'd been through a lot in the last twenty-four hours. \"If I could turn back the clock...\" he replied.\n\n\nBack at the loft, Ridge told Caroline that there were things to consider before starting a family. He wished he hadn't let her go the other night because he'd never wanted to hurt her. Caroline said he'd thought he'd been doing what was best for her, but she was glad he'd found his senses.\n\n\nRidge picked up a sketchpad as Caroline cooed about motherhood and the joy of even poopy diapers. Ridge said that some would find it daunting, but she replied that she had him. She wanted to have a baby right that moment. Ridge did, too, but he wanted to take care of some procedures first.\n\n\nAssuming he meant work, Caroline asked if what was on the pad was one of things to take care of. Ridge replied that he'd been working on it for a while, but he needed her approval on it.\n\n\nCaroline asked when Ridge had needed her approval on anything. Ridge remarked that they'd been through a lot; she'd taught him how to design again, and she said he'd taught her to walk again. He wanted to take one more step before he and Caroline had children.\n\n\nRidge believed that lines were important, and lines had united them. He had one more line to run by her. Flipping a page on the pad, he revealed a revised sketch of her backside. In the new sketch, she wore a wedding gown and veil. On the page, he'd written, \"Will you marry me?\"\n\n\nCaroline's eyes widened, and she clamped her hands over her mouth. Ridge said she was his muse. She'd given him back his life, and he didn't want to live without her. He loved her, and he'd love their child. He said to not ever question his commitment.\n\n\nCaroline's eyes watered as Ridge knelt before her and produced a diamond ring. She exclaimed that it was huge. He said to shut up and say she'd marry him. She eagerly complied, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Caroline crawled onto the bed. Ridge spread out beside her. She told him that she loved him for not letting her give up on her idea of having a family. She felt that he knew her better than she knew herself. She was excited that, even though she'd thought she'd lost him, he'd be her husband and the father of her child. Ridge couldn't wait to start a life with her.\n\n\nCaroline said she'd drink to it. Ridge went to get Champagne, but they only had beer. She said she didn't want that. She only wanted \"this.\" Caroline curled up on his lap like a kitten, and he held her.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Ivy and Steffy shouted conflicting commands to Wyatt about Ivy's video file. Steffy wanted it deleted, and Ivy warned Wyatt not to do it. Wyatt tried to convince Ivy that Aly had attacked Steffy on the roadside, but Ivy assumed Steffy had played into Wyatt's old feelings for Steffy.\n\n\nWyatt denied it and insisted that Steffy wasn't a murderer. Ivy asserted that even without the video, she had been a witness. Wyatt knew that Ivy thought she was avenging Aly, but the methods were wrong, and he'd been wrong to encourage using the video to get a shot at Forrester. The only thing wrong in Ivy's eyes was Steffy murdering Aly.\n\n\nSteffy declared that she hadn't done it, and Ivy was attacking Steffy's life. Ivy said life had consequences, and Steffy should have thought of them before striking Aly. Wyatt ordered the women to stop it and resolve it as the family they were.\n\n\nWyatt admitted to being bitter about Liam's new job at Forrester and relationship with Steffy, but he said the video didn't make Steffy a killer. He added that he'd enjoyed seeing the pair squirm, but he'd been wrong. Wyatt told Ivy that she could grieve, but she couldn't hold the accident over Steffy.\n\n\nWyatt instructed Steffy to give Ivy another chance because Ivy was going through a traumatizing experience. He wanted to delete the video to prevent another tragedy, but Ivy insisted upon holding accountable a woman who got away with everything.\n\n\nSteffy stated that she and Ivy were family, and Ivy and Aly were her cousins. Steffy said she had to carry the night with her forever; however, Aly's death hadn't been intentional, and Liam leaving Ivy wasn't comparable to it. Steffy didn't know why Ivy was trying to ruin her life but said it wasn't like Ivy.\n\n\nWyatt asked Ivy to really think about what Aly had stood for -- family, love, honesty, and truth. He knew that, deep down, Ivy didn't believe it had been murder. He asked Ivy to really listen to Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy explained that Aly had plotted to murder her. Aly had punctured the tire and had tried to run Steffy down. Steffy had tried to get through to Aly, to no avail. After Aly had swung a tire iron and sent Steffy to the ground, Aly had picked up a rock. Ivy replied that she hadn't seen it. Steffy said it was why the video was dangerous. The video didn't show the right angle, but Aly had indeed had a rock.\n\n\nUpset, Ivy cried that she hadn't seen it. She'd been Aly's best friend. Aly had needed help, but Ivy hadn't seen it. Ivy felt guilty for being too caught up with Rick's antics, the deportation, and holding on to Liam. Ivy declared that Aly had been sick, and Ivy had missed it. Ivy stated that they'd all known Aly's problems, but they'd just called her crazy and intolerant. Wyatt replied that they'd all missed it; they couldn't get Aly back, but they could end the hurt.\n\n\nIvy told Steffy that she knew Steffy hadn't intentionally killed Aly. Ivy said Steffy wasn't a murderer, and Ivy was sorry. Wyatt bent over the laptop, but Ivy stopped him. She sat before it and deleted the video of her cell phone storage. Wyatt hugged Ivy as she cried, and Steffy sighed in relief.\n\n\n",

Ridge hugs Caroline and Thomas tells him he is grateful that he asked him to join the team. He charges across the hall and runs into Brooke who notices the tension. He tells her all is okay and she is looking at the newest member of the design team. She hugs him. But she is surprised that Ridge and Caroline are back together. Ridge apologizes to Caroline for what he said earlier to hurt her. He says he never wants to be without her again. Wyatt tells Ivy this video is dangerous as it does not show everything. Steffy is not a murderer. Ivy tells him that he was not there, she was. He says he is putting an end to this today. He knows she thinks she is trying to avenge Aly but this is wrong. Steffy says she is attacking her life. Ivy says maybe Steffy should have thought of this before she picked up the tire iron. Wyatt says lots of mistakes were made but this is not murder. She can not blame Liam and Steffy, it was an accident. It was a mistake and she can not hold this over Steffy and blackmail her. She has to delete the video and give her another chance. They do not need another tragedy. He keeps repeating Steffy did not murder Aly so it was tragic. Steffy says she is not a bad person and she is not sure why Ivy is trying to ruin her life. She did not kill Aly and she did not take Liam away from Ivy. Wyatt reminds them they are family and that is what Aly stood for. Ivy keeps repeating that she saw no rock on the video. Thomas tells Brooke that Ridge felt like he could not be a father again but he thinks he can. Brooke says she can not believe that as he likes living in the moment and he just told her he had grown children and did not want any more. Caroline keeps looking at the crib and says she is looking forward someday to all those little fingers and toes and 3 a.m. feedings, all of it. He says there are a few things they need to work on first. He flips the page of his sketch pad and says there is one more line ----- it says \"will you marry me?\" She is his muse and gave him back his life and he does not want to live another day without her. He gets down on one knee and hands her a huge diamond and puts it on her finger. She clasps her hand over her mouth, almost afraid to believe it but finally pulls him to her and says yes. He says they can have the CEO and the designing, he just wants her back and for her to be happy. They have no champagne so they snuggle up on the bed with bottles of beer. Ivy admits she should have paid more attention to Aly. She went to crazy and they ignored it. She was sick and they all missed it. Wyatt says they can not bring Aly back but they can put an end to this. The video will only hurt the whole family. Ivy cries that she is sorry. She knows Steffy is not a murderer. She sits down and deletes the video then hugs Wyatt as Steffy looks on.",
