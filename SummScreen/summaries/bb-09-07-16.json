    "tvmega_recap": "Pam is not sure how Ivy can come back and be here after all that happened. Ivy says it is in her blood, her family, her designing jewelry, it was what she was born to do. Pam scrunches her face and says she meant working with Quinn. Ivy remarks she really isn't that bad. Steffy walks in and is surprised to see Ivy. Ivy says she is a Forrester so why shouldn't she be here? Then Steffy realizes that she is here because of Quinn in helping her with the jewelry line. Wyatt tries to talk to his mother again about moving on and working anywhere but here at FC. She says Eric is CEO and he wants her here and in his house so Wyatt needs to accept that. He says Steffy will not accept her with Eric and will not live with him as long as Quinn is around. So he is not with his wife because of Quinn. No one, not Ridge, Steffy or Thomas wants her here. He is doing everything he can to keep in touch with Steffy and not lose her but he is not gaining any headway. He blames Quinn for sticking around and then Liam worming his way in at every opportunity. She says he will not lose Steffy. They will not let that happen. Liam finds Thomas working out and says he is looking for Steffy. He needs to talk to her again about cutting all ties with Quinn. Thomas knows that means also that Steffy will not be returning home to Wyatt. Liam says he doesn't want to hurt Wyatt either but he cannot cut his mother out of his life and Steffy cannot be around her so it is an impossible situation. Thomas says he can not reveal more now but they have a plan to get Quinn out of FC. Liam says Quinn is always up to something so he is not sure he can believe that but Thomas has his support 100% if the plan gets rid of Quinn. Steffy tells Ivy that she looks different. Ivy says yes she is working on Americanizing herself with a whole new look and accent. Steffy tells her if Quinn brought her back do not count on that long as Eric made a mistake hiring Quinn back and she is on her way out. Ivy retorts that she knows Quinn is a sore spot for Steffy so maybe that is why she is not with Wyatt, too bad as they have not been married that long. Quinn tells Ivy that she spoke with her uncle and Eric is happy to welcome her back on board at FC. Quinn says she is going to be Ivy's advocate and back her. She needs to be honest. She needs her help in helping to save her son's marriage. She needs Ivy to distract Liam and keep him away from Steffy. Wyatt joins Thomas at workout and asks if he has a minute. Things are a little strained still between he and Steffy. Thomas says that is really none of his business. Yeah, Thomas, then why keep telling Liam that you are all for him and Steffy to be together. Wyatt says he knows his mother causes drama wherever she goes so he gets why Thomas is so protective of his sister. He's talked to Quinn over and over about moving out of Eric's but it is like talking to a brick wall. Thomas says he knows but as long as she is living with his granddad it is as if she feels she is entitled. Wyatt says Eric is a grown man so he cannot tell him what to do. Eric brought Quinn back, not him. And now he feels like he is paying for it with his marriage on the line. There is a whole other factor here not just his mom, but Liam. Liam finds Steffy. She tells him he did not have to make up an excuse to come to FC to see her. He laments to her that he just saw Thomas and he alluded to the fact that they had a plan to get rid of Quinn. Steffy says yes but she does not want to jinx it but maybe they won't have to deal with her much longer. But besides her craziness she needs to warn him that now Ivy is back. He is flabbergasted because Quinn and Ivy hate each other ever since Quinn pushed her off the bridge. He comments to Steffy that he'd like her to come over tonight. He is not going to pressure her but just to hang out. And he would like her to know that he still wants a life with her whenever she is ready to make that decision. Ivy thinks Quinn is crazy to think that she can snap her fingers and make Liam forget Steffy, the woman he really loves. Quinn says then think about what Steffy is to men that makes them go wild. She is audacious, she's charming, a modern woman so Ivy needs to be a little more like that. Now Ivy sees it, the reason for this makeover to please Quinn but to please Liam too. Quinn says Steffy it out of the picture. She's Wyatt's wife so Liam needs someone to take his mind off of Steffy and he stop sniffing around. That is where Ivy comes in. She still cares for him a lot and Liam needs a new woman in his life. So Ivy can turn on the charm and flirt a little. Ivy says that may not be possible if he is always with Steffy. Quinn says absence makes the heart grow fonder. Ivy says not always. Quinn tells her she will not fail as she is going to guide her and be her life coach. At that moment Steffy and Liam are saying goodbye in the hallway and are in view of Quinn and Ivy. Ivy says Liam is still hung up on Steffy as they speak. Quinn assures her that does not matter; she belongs to Wyatt. She knows Ivy is not over Liam so she can get him back. It's easy, just keep Liam away from Steffy.",
