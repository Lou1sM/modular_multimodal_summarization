    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Bill wondered if Liam had smoked something before he'd arrived there. Liam said that Bill was dangerous and couldn't be trusted. Liam ordered his father to step down and said that Liam would take over from there. Bill replied that the only person take a leave of absence was Liam. \"You're fired,\" Bill stated.\n\n\nLiam said that Bill couldn't do it, but Bill quipped that he'd just done it. Liam threatened to go to the police, but Bill doubted Liam had it in him. Liam asked if Bill knew how long he'd get for arson. Liam claimed to have always respected his father. Bill quipped that threatening him with jail time was a funny way to show it. Bill had never thought he'd hear it from his own flesh and blood.\n\n\nLiam suggested that Bill stop lying. Liam claimed that he'd figured out the code for the Spencer Summit App, and he'd figured out that Bill had lied about the fashion challenge being a tie. \"It was for charity! Who gives a damn?\" Bill exclaimed. Liam was ashamed and asked when it was going to be enough. He asked what void Bill was trying to fill.\n\n\nBill told \"Dr. Freud\" to give him a break. Liam complained that Bill had buildings, billions, and Brooke, but Bill still took and took. Liam yelled that Bill couldn't even let Spectra win a fashion show. Bill mock roared and cheered, saying Spectra had won, and he asked if it made Liam happy. Bill didn't want to hide things from Liam. He said Liam had some good ideas, and they might implement them around there; however, Bill would not be blackmailed by his own son.\n\n\nLiam claimed not to be blackmailing Bill. Guessing the word was to unsavory for Liam, Bill asked what Liam would like to call it to make it more sanitary. Liam didn't think Bill understood that Liam could have Bill arrested on the spot. Bill realized that Liam had really thought it through. \"Probably even dreamed about it,\" Bill gleaned about Liam and his \"little coup.\"\n\n\nBill asked if Liam was feeling ignored around there or as if he hadn't been heard enough. Bill said he'd given Liam more philanthropy when he'd asked for it, and the fashion show had raised over a million dollars for the Spencer Foundation.\n\n\nBill said Liam could go to the police, who wouldn't be able to trace the fire back to Bill, anyway. Bill had only told Liam about the fire because Liam had needed to hear it and because Liam was Bill's son, whom Bill loved. \"And I trusted you. Was that a mistake?\" Bill asked. Bill wondered if Liam needed more transparency and decided to give it.\n\n\nBill admitted that he'd told Justin to get someone to torch Spectra so that Bill could build Spencer Tower. Bill asked if Liam was happy and satisfied. Liam whipped out his phone to email something to himself for safekeeping. He pressed play, and the phone replayed Bill admitting to getting Justin to set up the fire. \"No evidence, huh? Gotcha,\" Liam told Bill.\n\n\nBill was shocked that Liam had recorded their private conversation. Liam decided that Bill had gone too far, and Bill's way of doing business was criminal and had to end. Bill stated that Liam had lost his mind if he thought Bill would let him get away with it. Liam said that a young woman had arrived in the city with a dream, and Bill thought it had made him a man to take it from her.\n\n\nSighing, Bill asked what it was with Liam and if it made Liam feel strong to defend Sally Spectra. Chuckling, Bill figured that he knew what it was. \"You have a thing for her!\" Bill exclaimed. Liam concluded that there was no compassion in Bill, even though Liam had hoped to find some. It was evident in Bill's business practices, low wages, meager health benefits, and fear and intimidation practices.\n\n\nLiam said that Bill had put the company and family in jeopardy, and Liam decided that, along with a leave of absence, Bill would take a long, hard look at himself. \"As long as it takes. Until then, I'm CEO,\" Liam declared. Bill responded, \"The hell you are.\"\n\n\nLiam instructed Bill to have a memo on Liam's desk in the morning, indicating that Bill would step down immediately. \"On your desk?\" Bill asked. Liam yelled that it was his desk and office, and he'd protect the Spencer name and whatever dignity the company had left. \"Boy, you have lost your mind,\" Bill seethed.\n\n\nLiam instructed Bill to have the memo on the desk at nine in the morning. If it was a minute later, Liam would call the police. Liam declared himself the CEO of Spencer Publications.\n\n\nIn the Forrester's CEO office, Steffy and Ridge discussed Bill's bully nature. She doubted her husband would put up with it much longer. Ridge said that was good, but she wasn't so sure about it. She explained that Liam wanted more influence at Spencer to do good things in the world.\n\n\nRidge didn't think Bill would allow it, but Steffy said Bill had a lot to gain by listening. She just didn't want Liam to push his father too far and ruin his relationship with his father. Ridge advised her to tell Liam to lower his expectations of Bill so that Liam didn't walk through life disappointed.\n\n\nIn the design office, Rick was surprised to hear Maya suggest that Zende replace Jean-Luc at International. He said it wasn't about helping Zende's career; it was about keeping Nicole away from Lizzy. Maya claimed it would be an adventure for the couple, but it would also create distance between Nicole and Lizzy during a crucial stage in Lizzy's development.\n\n\nMaya admitted that hearing Lizzy refer to Nicole as her mother after all they'd gone through had been very upsetting. Rick understood, and he thought Maya was right. It would be a legitimate career move for Zende. Rick stated that they had to run it by Ridge, and then Rick remembered that Sasha was living in Paris and modeling.\n\n\nMaya believed that Zende was completely committed to Nicole, so Sasha wouldn't be an issue. Maya claimed to want the best for Nicole and Zende, and Maya also wanted the best for her own family with Rick and Lizzy. Maya suggested that they see what Ridge thought about it.\n\n\nMaya and Rick went across the hall to pitch their idea of sending Zende and Nicole to Paris. Ridge, who'd thought Zende was doing well in Los Angeles, asked what he was missing. Rick agreed that Zende was doing very well; however, it was a good opportunity for Zende. Rick said Jean-Luc was leaving, and Zende could stay on there if he was a fit for Jean-Luc's job. Maya added that Nicole could be the point person for the marketing department in Europe.\n\n\nRidge was surprised by the ideas and said Nicole was Lizzy's aunt. Maya replied that Nicole was more than that, and Nicole meant the world to Maya. Ridge thought it would be a great opportunity and decided to see what Zende and Nicole would think.\n\n\nIn the studio, Nicole and Zende discussed how well Zende was doing with his designs. She said the whole family was behind him, and she couldn't wait to see what the future held. She imagined the day of Zende's first full showing, and she said she'd be modeling his designs on the runway. Zende spun her around and kissed her.\n\n\nLater, Zende and Nicole met with Maya, Rick, and Ridge in the CEO's office. Ridge thanked Zende for stepping up when Sally had stolen their collection. Ridge explained that Zende had to always keep an open mind about what was next, and an opportunity had presented itself that could be good. Zende asked what it was, and Ridge asked how Zende and Nicole would like to move to Paris.\n\n\nIn the design office, Sally arrived while Steffy was ending a phone call. Sally promised not to be long. She'd arrived to bid Steffy farewell. Sally was leaving town. She didn't know where she'd go, but there was nothing for her in Los Angeles. With Thomas in New York and Spectra burned to the ground, it was time for Sally to figure out what was next in her life.\n\n\nSally also wanted to apologize for all the trouble she'd caused. For that trouble, Sally wanted Steffy to accept a peace offering. Sally presented some normal paper-sized sketches. They'd been created for a new era at Spectra, but Sally didn't need them anymore. Steffy didn't feel she could take them, but Sally said it was only fitting after she'd stolen Forrester's designs. Sally wanted to give the last of her designs to Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy didn't know what to say. Sally replied that she'd been nothing but a royal pain, and in another lifetime, they might have been friends. Steffy poignantly nodded.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Ridge and Steffy discuss the complex relationship between Bill and Liam. Over at Spencer Publications, Bill is amazed by Liam's audacity to try pushing him out of the company. He informs his son that he will not be blackmailed, especially if he has no proof whatsoever that he torched up Spectra Fashions. Liam then reveals that he taped their entire conversation and now has the ammunition to bring Bill behind bars. Bill glares apoplectically as Liam orders him to hand in his resignation by tomorrow morning or he will call the police - Rick questions Maya's extreme plan to send Nicole and Zende off to Paris. Soon, Rick begins to jump on board. Meanwhile, Nicole tells Zende how proud she is of him getting recognition from his family. Steffy is stunned when Sally arrives at her door and tells her that she is leaving town for good. As a final gesture to repay for past mistakes, Sally boldly offers Steffy a batch of designs as a peace offering. Ridge makes a stunned Zende and Nicole the offer to take over positions at Forrester International.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill asks Liam if he smoked something before he came in here. This is his business. Liam says he cannot be trusted so Bill can just step down and he will take it from here. Nicole tells Zende she is really impressed by his accomplishments and the whole family believes in him. And she can be his main model. Rick tells Maya that he is not against it, but surprised that she wants to ship her sister away to Paris to work to keep her away from Lizzy. He knows it has nothing to do with Zende getting the job there. She says call it mother's intuition but yes it bothers her when she hears Lizzy call Nicole mama. Rick says there is one little problem. Sasha is in Paris modeling. Maya says no problem as now Zende is 100% committed to Nicole. She hopes he will tell Ridge and see what he thinks. Bill tells Liam that the only person taking a leave of absence is Liam as he is fired. Liam retorts that he would not do that as he could go to the police. Bill should know how many years he will get for arson. Steffy tells Ridge that Liam can be pushed into a corner and be very unforgiving but she does not want him to sever ties with his father. She leaves just as Maya and Rick walk in so they talk to Ridge. They propose it would be a good thing to send Zende and Nicole to Paris where they are needed now. Ridge says he loves Paris himself but he thought it was working out for Zende here. He'll have to talk to Zende and Nicole and see how they feel about this. Liam tells Bill that he has always respected him but he needs to stop lying. He comments that Spectra won fair and square in the last showing and that was a dirty little trick and now the latest one, the fire. He is ashamed of him. Bill has everything, so much, so just what is it that he wants? Bill says he cannot break out Freud now and analyze him. Then he says okay, big deal, so Spectra won but he will not be blackmailed by his own son now. Sally drops in on Steffy and says she just wants to say goodbye. Steffy is surprised but Sally says Thomas is in New York and she lost Spectra so there is nothing left for her here. She also is sorry for the things she did to Steffy and wants to apologize to her. Bill mocks Liam that he wants more power and can unseat his own dad. The police cannot trace that fire back to him. He loves Liam and he trusted him but looks like that was a big mistake. Liam continues to push and gets Bill to grandstand. Bill announces okay, he got Justin to find someone to set fire to Spectra. So now Liam can be satisfied and they can move on. Liam turns his back and Bill asks what he is doing. Liam replies he is e-mailing himself so he won't lose this. He plays the repeat of what Bill just said \u0096 gotcha! Ridge speaks with Zende and Nicole and says he has a great opportunity for them if they would like to move to Paris and work at International. Sally tells Steffy that she knows she has been nothing but a royal pain in the butt and she'd like her to accept this peace offering. She wants her to have her sketches, the ones that did not get destroyed in the fire. In another lifetime perhaps they could have been friends. Bill is stunned that Liam would stoop so low to record him. Is this what he thinks he has to do to defend Sally Spectra. He's got it now; Liam has a thing for her! Liam argues with him that he has put the entire company and the family in jeopardy. He is the new leadership and it is time. Bill says Liam has lost his mind. Liam says at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning he becomes the new CEO and this is his desk now.",
