She hung up and told herself that she was going to do whatever was necessary to ensure her daughter's happiness.\n\n\nEric met with Nick and wanted to know about his feelings for his daughter and what he intended to do. He knew that Nick and Brooke had expressed their feelings for each other and wanted to know how he intended to keep them from Bridget. If he wasn't sure, Eric told him that he was going to Bridget with the truth.\n\n\nThomas, Gaby, and Taylor continued arguing over what to do with the situation that had been created first out of wanting to help Gaby. Thomas told his mother that if she was going to make Gaby leave, then he was going also. Thomas told Gaby to pack their clothes. As they prepared to walk out the door, Agent Dunn was standing there. He was there to confirm what Taylor had called him about.\n\n\nTaylor again told Agent Dunn that the wedding was only to get Gaby her green card. Thomas said that it all had changed. They loved each other. Agent Dunn told them Gaby was on her way out, and as Thomas prepared to follow, the door was opened to expose yet another person there to help, but this time it was Gaby who had made the call.\n\n\nEric told Nick that Brooke had begged him for one more night to settle things. She intended to prove to Bridget that Nick was not a factor in her life anymore.\n\n\nDante and Brooke continued their conversation as she started to hit on him. He told her that her daughter was beautiful but not to sell herself short either. Dante told her that she was a person who loved deeply and hurt deeply, and it caused her nothing but one complication after another. She asked Dante if he was still in love with her daughter.\n\n\nDante told Brooke that Bridget was only interested in Nick and had never responded to his advances. Brooke continued to tell Dante that she was through with Nick and that Bridget needed to know that. Perhaps he could help tell her that, but he wanted proof, so Brooke gave it to him by passionately planting a kiss on Dante.\n\n\nGaby's help was there to confirm that if Agent Dunn proceeded with the case, public opinion would not be on their side. It would be the story of two young lovers against a disgruntled mother-in-law. Taylor was furious, but Agent Dunn said that under the circumstances, there was nothing more he could do, since the marriage had been consummated. Gaby and Thomas felt successful, but Taylor was furious.\n\n\n",
