Liam had enjoyed her party, and he'd almost felt as if he'd really been in the Outback. That feeling had been what Ivy had been seeking for him.\n\n\nIvy hadn't had ulterior motives for the evening, but she'd gotten the sense that it hadn't been going well. Liam acknowledged that he'd almost been a killjoy and that it might be too soon for him. Ivy said she wanted to help him realize there was life after Hope. He replied that he appreciated it and Ivy.\n\n\nIvy knew Liam was going through a difficult time, and she wanted to be there for him. She offered to listen and throw around boomerangs. Liam asked her to teach him to throw, but she confessed that she'd only done it once. He thanked for her helping him laugh at that time in his life.\n\n\nLiam's phone chimed with a reminder to drop Bu off at the beach house. Liam explained that he and Hope were kind of sharing the cat. He dreaded having to go to the beach house, and Ivy remarked that he had to take Bu to his stepdad. Liam exclaimed that Ivy got it, and she asked him to call her in the morning to tell her how it had gone.\n\n\nLater, Aly arrived with ice cream for Ivy and remarked that she'd just seen Liam leave. Aly thought he'd left earlier, and Ivy replied that the night had gone a little better than Ivy had thought. Ivy confided that Liam had kissed her, and it had been different. Aly was beaming because it was a huge deal. Ivy replied that she just wanted Liam to be happy, and Aly concluded that he was well on his way.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Wyatt opened up some champagne. He guessed Liam and Ivy were swimming around in Hope's mind. Hope smarmily said they'd been swimming along in the Seine. Hope claimed not to have regrets, but Wyatt said Hope didn't have to pretend that the fall had changed her life.\n\n\nHope admitted that it had affected her, and Ivy's interest in Liam afterward seemed strange. Wyatt wondered if Hope suspected Ivy of falling on purpose, but Hope asked who would do that. He figured it didn't matter if Ivy had jumped or not. What mattered was that Liam hadn't made it on time.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that Hope had ended up with the most awesome husband in the world. Agreeing, Hope said that Wyatt was handsome, smart, and \"so good\" for her. They kissed, and Hope laid her head on his shoulder. He asked if she felt better. She claimed she hadn't felt bad, but instead, she'd realized that she didn't need to get involved in whom Liam spent time with.\n\n\nHope decided to take a leap of a faith and believe it would work out for Liam. Wyatt recalled that he and Hope had done that, and she said it had been the best jump of her life. Wyatt replied that he'd do it again. \"Except the next time, we cannonball,\" Hope added.\n\n\nHope thanked Wyatt for listening, and Wyatt claimed that he'd learned it from his husband handbook. She said he should keep reading because it was working. He added that his handbook had also guided him to invite his wife to the shower. She declined because his \"so beautiful\" singing was distracting. He claimed to be taking lessons, and she said she'd be right there.\n\n\nWyatt went to the bathroom, and Hope swigged champagne. There was a knock at the door, and opening it, she found Liam on the porch with Bu. Her eyes softened as she took the cat, who she claimed she'd missed. She'd forgotten Liam would drop off the cat and deliberated about inviting Liam inside. Liam declined because he didn't want to intrude and guessed he should have text-messaged her.\n\n\nHope said it was fine that he'd stopped by. They discussed a cat toy she'd told him to buy, and he indicated that she'd been right about Bu taking to it. He said it was weird being parents sharing Bu. Hope didn't think it was weird because they both cared about Bu.\n\n\nLiam said that all the memories he had were etched into his mind, and it wasn't that he thought anyone could take them away from him. \"I don't know what I'm saying,\" he suddenly interjected.\n\n\nLiam stated that Wyatt didn't want Bu, and it would be more practical if Liam just took him. Shaking her head definitively, Hope said she didn't want that. Liam asked her to promise that, no matter what, Bu was hers and Liam's to raise, and they would share him. Hope promised.\n\n\nLiam smiled. He fidgeted at the door and stated that there was a part of his brain that wouldn't let him tell himself that it was over. \"And then I come here, and it's all very real...\" he uttered. Suddenly, he decided that he should go, and Hope grew tearful watching him leave.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Quinn gloated about how easy it had been to push Ivy, and Quinn had known Liam wouldn't pass up the rescue mission. She was proud that Hope had turned to her and Bill's son, Wyatt. Bill wondered how long Hope would be with Wyatt once she heard what Quinn had done. Quinn declared that Hope and Wyatt were happy, and Bill wouldn't mess with it.\n\n\nBill said he normally wouldn't; however, he had an appreciation for the kind of commitment that Wyatt thought he had, and at the same time, Liam was miserable. Quinn accused Bill of playing favorites, but he said he'd merely give his sons the truth to do with as they pleased. She accused Bill of being jealous that she'd succeeded where he'd failed in breaking up Hope and Liam.\n\n\nBill was ashamed to say he'd broken up Hope and Liam plenty of times. He called the Bill of the past a miserable, meddling father who hadn't been able to keep his trap shut and let his son live his own life. Quinn retorted that it was exactly what she wanted -- for him to keep his trap shut and not get involved. Bill exclaimed that he hadn't been the one pushing people into rivers.\n\n\nQuinn believed that Bill should be thanking her and asked why he'd tried to break up the couple in the past. Bill replied that Liam had belonged with Steffy, but she was no longer an option. \"Neither is Hope. She's married,\" Quinn responded. She said that Hope had never made Liam happy, but she did Wyatt. Bill replied that it didn't justify what Quinn had done.\n\n\nQuinn didn't think she'd done anything but help Hope take the coward's way out. In Quinn's view, Hope couldn't admit that she preferred Wyatt, so she'd sent Liam through ridiculous hoops. Quinn believed a woman in love didn't give her man ultimatums like that. She was sure Bill didn't want his sons fighting over the same girl any longer. \"Be a good daddy. Stop interfering,\" Quinn concluded. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Wyatt is extremely caring and understanding when Hope vents to him her frustrations regarding the possibility of Liam dating Ivy so soon after their breakup. While talking about their similarities and their many respective plots to break up Hope and Liam, Quinn becomes turned on and attempts to seduce Bill. Despite Liam\u2019s concern that he\u2019s still hooked on Hope, Ivy offers to assist him in moving on.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hope tells Wyatt that she has no regrets. He says she doesn't have to pretend that it doesn't matter. Her whole life changed when Ivy fell into the Seine and Liam stayed to rescue her. Wyatt says whether she jumped in on purpose or accident it doesn't matter. What matters is that Liam did not make it to Hope in time. She says Wyatt is so good for her; they kiss. She laments she knows she took the leap of faith and does not need to worry about Liam. She will have to have that faith that Ivy will give Liam space and be good for him. After their kiss, Liam tells Ivy again that he is glad she invited him. She says she had no ulterior motive but she too is glad he came and had a good time. She wants him to know there is life after Hope. He says he appreciates that and he appreciates her too. Quinn tells Bill that it is funny how things have a way of working out. He asks her exactly how much time has she spent in the straightjacket as she is crazy as hell. She tells him Hope and Wyatt are happy and he is not going to mess with that. Quinn brags that she succeeded when Bill never could break up Hope and Liam. One little bump and she got the job done. She tells him that is all she is asking him to do, is keep his mouth shut. She would think Bill would not want his two sons fighting over the same girl again. He can be a good dad and stop interfering. Ivy tells Liam that she is there for him. She knows Hope married his brother and she doesn't know how that feels, but she can imagine what a downer it is. He gets a fax that it's his night to drop Boo off at Hope's. Aly comes home and sees Liam is leaving. But Ivy says the night was a success after all. Bill says Hope did not make this decision on her own; she had a little help from Quinn. She says they are both alike. They know what they want and they go after it no matter what. He says her secret is safe only because Hope and Liam never worked out together. Hope thanks Wyatt for listening and understanding. He says he is heading in for a shower and hopes she will join. She tells him to lather up and she will be right there. But before she can, Liam is with Boo at the door. She doesn't invite him in and he says it is okay, he would not want to intrude. He says he feels like a parent although with them sharing an animal. Maybe he should keep Boo full time. She says no she would not be okay with that. He tells her there is a part of his brain that tells him it is not over but he knows it is. Sheepishly he walks away and her eyes follow him.",
