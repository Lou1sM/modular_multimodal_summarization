    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Vivienne and Julius joined the discussion that Rick, Maya, and Ridge were having with Zende and Nicole about moving to Paris. Maya believed Zende and Nicole would love it there. Julius stated that he knew Rick and Maya loved Paris. Ridge replied that it was probably the reason the couple had gotten the idea.\n\n\nNicole asked if the promotion was Maya's idea. Acknowledging it, Maya said Ridge had been very receptive to Zende's work, and it had dawned on Maya that the International position would be opening up. Maya thought it was an amazing opportunity for Nicole, too, in the public relations department. Ridge stated that they'd all worked overseas at some point, and there was a lot to learn from their international colleagues.\n\n\nVivienne asked if Sasha was working in Paris. Zende said he'd made mistakes, but he wasn't stupid. He loved Nicole more than anything. Julius asked how Nicole felt about it. Nicole said it was sudden, and she had to wonder if there was more to it. Nicole noted that Maya hadn't talked to her about it at all, and Ridge said Maya had cleared it with him and Rick first.\n\n\nThe Avants felt that something was bothering Nicole. Nicole asked if Maya was still upset with Nicole for considering not signing the adoption papers. Maya said it had nothing to do with that. Maya recalled that they'd had an emotional time, but they'd gotten through it. She said she just wanted what was best for everyone, and it would be an amazing opportunity for the couple.\n\n\nRidge didn't want to force anyone into anything they were uncomfortable with. Vivienne asked if Nicole was uncomfortable with it. Nicole thought it was exciting but intimidating. She was wary of leaving the city, her family, friends, and Lizzy. She'd miss them all. Nicole asked Zende what he thought about it.\n\n\nZende felt that it was a lot to process, but the more he thought about it, the more he thought of how great it could be for them to explore Paris together. It could be a great opportunity and an adventure for them. Ridge asked if it was a \"yes.\" Nicole slowly replied that it was.\n\n\nVivienne cheered, saying she was very happy for Zende and Nicole. Julius told Zende to take good care of his baby. Maya hugged Nicole and said they'd have the time of their lives. As Zende told Nicole that it was a new beginning, Rick and Maya exchanged looks.\n\n\nAlone in the CEO's office later, Zende asked Nicole if they were really doing it. Nicole said her head was spinning. He stated that he couldn't have done it without her. He knew it would be hard to leave their family and Lizzy, but he believed it would be a time in their lives that they'd never forget. The couple kissed.\n\n\nAcross the hall, Steffy entered the design office and apologized for making Sally wait. Steffy didn't want to take Sally's designs, which were really good, in Steffy's opinion. Sally insisted, saying she had no use for them, and she owed Steffy. Steffy disagreed. Sally didn't know how Steffy could disagree after what Sally had done. Sally felt like she deserved everything that had happened.\n\n\nSteffy replied that Sally hadn't deserved it. Sally reasoned that she and Steffy were a lot alike; however, Steffy's \"bad ass\" ways paid off, but Sally's didn't. Sally said she'd had it all, including a great guy, and it had all disappeared quicker than she'd gotten it.\n\n\nSally received a message from C.J. and decided to go. Steffy thanked Sally for the sketches, and Sally left to meet C.J. at Il Giardino.\n\n\nAt a table with Sally later, C.J. was relieved that she was out and about and feeling better. Sally replied that smoke inhalation wouldn't keep her under. He stated that it could have been worse. Sally said her designs could have been Spectra's ticket into the fashion world, but it had all gone up in flames over a freak accident.\n\n\nLater, C.J. was surprised to hear that Sally was leaving town. Sally said nothing was left for her there but a charred office in a charred building. C.J. replied that it wouldn't be that way for long because he was selling the building to Bill Spencer.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Steffy located Liam in the CEO's office. She asked what was going on. Liam replied that it was the end of an era, and in the morning, he'd have a letter on the desk, which had become his desk, stating that Bill was stepping down from Spencer.\n\n\nAmazed that Liam had instructed Bill to step down, Steffy asked what Bill had said. Liam replied that Bill had yelled and threatened Liam. She assumed that Liam had stood his ground, but she said Bill was Spencer Publications and wouldn't give it up. Liam said Bill would do it, or Liam would hand Bill over to the police.\n\n\nSteffy realized that Liam had actually blackmailed his father. Liam believed he was righting a wrong. She was amazed that he would have his father arrested. Liam said that he would if it got down to it. Steffy asked if he could really send his father to prison.\n\n\nLiam asked if Bill thought he was some gangster, ordering buildings to be torched. Liam said someone could have died. Steffy didn't condone what Bill had done, and Liam concluded that Bill needed to pay a price. Steffy asked if that price was the company Bill had spent his life building. Liam added that it had been built on the backs of a lot of people.\n\n\nSteffy asked what would happen if Bill refused, and she wondered if Liam could really send Bill to prison. Liam was banking on the idea that Bill wouldn't let Liam send him to prison. Liam believed the only way to stop Bill was to grab his source of power, and Liam intended to run the company the way it deserved to be run.\n\n\nSteffy said she'd never seen that side of Liam before. Liam replied that Bill hadn't, either, but Bill had better get used to it. Liam said that Bill was out, and Liam was in. Liam finally had control over Bill, and Liam intended to use it. Liam would make much-needed changes and take the company in a new direction. There was nothing Bill could do but sit back and accept it.\n\n\nSteffy asked what changes Liam would make. Liam said he'd wanted to change things for a long time, and he was talking everything from childcare all the way up to 401(k). Bill had been offering too little for far too long, and Spencer had to do better. Equal pay and their effect on the environment were important to Liam. Steffy said she was impressed.\n\n\nLiam believed it would take a lot to undo what Bill had done. \"Like this,\" Liam said, gesturing to the model skyscraper. He stated that Bill wouldn't take the property from Sally. Steffy remarked that she'd seen Sally, who was leaving town. Liam called Sally another of Bill's victims.\n\n\nThough Steffy didn't always agree with Bill's tactics, she couldn't deny that Bill was all about progress and company growth. \"Well, I'm not,\" Liam quipped.  Liam claimed to know how to turn a profit but said profit wasn't everything. Steffy stated that she didn't doubt Liam would improve the business under his leadership. Liam asked if he heard \"a but coming.\"\n\n\nSteffy affirmed it. She didn't care about the company. She cared about Liam's relationship with his father. Shrugging, Liam said Bill would get over it. She asserted that Liam's father wouldn't get over blackmail. Liam started to say it wasn't, but Steffy talked over him, insisting that it was blackmail, which was as much of a crime as arson. \"Wow,\" Liam murmured.\n\n\nLiam said he'd heard it from Bill and asked that he not have to hear it from her, too. Liam insisted that he hadn't put it in motion; Bill had. Liam said the lying and manipulating had gone on for too long. \"And now arson. Well, enough is enough,\" Liam concluded.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Bill fumed as he flashed back on the conversation he'd had with Liam, who'd ordered Bill to step down as CEO at Spencer. Bill growled and threw his drink at the fireplace.\n\n\nBrooke arrived and asked how Bill's day had been. Bill grumbled that it had been \"from hell.\" He said employees had no idea what it took to make an empire, and the lack of gratitude and common business sense was blinding. He stated that one didn't get ahead by following the rules. Instead, one had to make the rules and break them when necessary.\n\n\nBill told Brooke that he'd had it in the palm of his hand. Brooke replied that he'd grab it again, whatever \"it\" was. Massaging his shoulders, she remarked upon how tense he was. She didn't think things could be \"that bad\" and said that, no matter what the issue was, he still had her, his beautiful \"Sky\" with its mirrors and smoky windows. She began to say Bill had his CEO's desk, but Bill hopped up from his seat. Brooke was taken aback by his smoldering demeanor.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was saying she still couldn't believe there had been a fire at Spectra. Bill replied that the building had been neglected for years. Brooke almost felt sorry for Sally and had heard that Sally's designs had been pretty good. Bill guessed they'd never know. Brooke stated that Sally had been on the brink of success but had wound up with nothing.\n\n\nBrooke began to say something about Thomas, but Bill asked not to talk about Sally Spectra anymore. Brooke said he still hadn't told her what had happened to upset him at work. She wanted to know what had put him in his mood. Bill continued to drink, and Liam's words echoed in his head. Brooke implored Bill to open up to her.\n\n\nBill took another swig from his glass. Brooke asked if he really needed to drink more when they hadn't even had dinner yet. Bill tossed back the rest of the drink. Rolling her eyes, Brooke stated, \"Now you're really worrying me.\"  She asked him to say what he was thinking. \"What I'm thinking -- I'm thinking about taking some time off,\" Bill revealed.\n\n\nBrooke expressed surprise. Bill said it was to be with her, and they could travel. Though she thought it would be nice, she believed he'd go crazy within a few days. She asked why, and he said he just felt the need to get away. She asked who'd run Spencer.  Bill replied that he had two sons, and Liam was president. Brooke noted that Bill and Liam were very different, and it wouldn't make sense for Bill to hand the company over to Liam.\n\n\nBill flashed to Liam saying he'd be the new CEO. Bill told Brooke that it might be what he needed to do. Brooke asked why he needed to hand the company over to Liam. Gazing into the burning fireplace, Bill heard Liam's voice, asking if Bill had been behind the fire, and he heard himself confessing to what he'd done.\n\n\n",
    "imdb": "Bill fumes over Liam's ultimatum. Brooke picks up on her husband's mood and is surprised to hear that he is thinking of taking some time off from the company.

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Sally to please keep her designs. They are really good but they are hers and Sally does not owe her anything. Sally says Steffy will not take this as a compliment but they are both a lot alike, being two badass girls. Only Steffy's paid off and hers didn't. She starts to leave and Steffy calls her back and thanks her for the designs. Maya and Rick introduce the idea of Zende and Nicole going to Paris in the International office to the Avants. Maya admits it was her idea after Rick praised Zende's designs and then there was an opening in that office. Viv asks isn't that where Sasha is modeling now. Zende speaks up and says he made mistakes but he is not stupid. Nicole is the only woman for him. Nicole wonders if it is more than that for Maya. Does it have anything to do with her almost not wanting to sign the adoption papers. Maya assures them this has nothing to do with that difficult time. Julius only wants to be sure this is okay with Nicole. Nicole says she knows it is a wonderful opportunity but she would miss all of them. But in the end Zende thinks it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity for him to be a designer and he looks to Nicole to accept it with him and she agrees. Liam tells Steffy that tomorrow morning there will be a letter of resignation from Bill on this desk .this desk which is now his desk. Steffy says that is never going to happen. Bill will never give this up. Liam says he will or be arrested. Brooke gives Bill a neck and shoulder massage but it does not help his grumpy mood. She brings up the fire and Bill does not want to talk about the fire or Spectra. She wants to know why he is so upset. Steffy is not so sure that Liam will send his own father to prison. He says he is counting on that. Bill will not let it go that far. Now he will get his chance and the power over his father and that is exactly what he is going to do. He will take Spencer Publications into a whole new future. Sally has lunch with CJ to say her goodbye. She feels she has no reason to stay in L.A. Nicole says this all makes her head spin just thinking about Paris. Zende says he knows it will be hard leaving her family, especially Lizzy, but this will be a time they will never forget. Liam says he has been wanting to make a change in the company for a long time, better times for the employees for one thing. His dad had a lot of bad policies. He points to the Tower and says his dad will not be doing that now. He does not need the property with a charred building. Steffy says she knows Liam can run the business and be good at it he feels a but coming. She says yes. She does not care about the company right now; she does not want to see him ruin his relationship with his father. Brooke wants to know what Bill is thinking; he can tell her anything. Finally he says he is thinking of taking some time off. He wants to get away with her. She asks about SP and he says he has two sons and one of them is President so it will be in good hands. Brooke is dubious and wants to know the real truth. Liam tells Steffy this has gone on too long. Enough is enough with the lies.",
