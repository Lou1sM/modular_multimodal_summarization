    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Rick, Eric, and Caroline worked on fitting models with Hope for the Future designs. Caroline noted that Hope had approved the designs as her favorites. Eric congratulated Rick and Caroline on their work for Forrester. Rick congratulated his wife on all she had done.\n\n\nRick shared that Caroline had developed designs for couture. He added that she had collaborated with Ridge. Caroline explained that she had taken some pretty rough designs to Ridge, and he had helped her redesign them. Ushering in a model in a white tee shirt, Rick decided to show Eric the progress that Ridge had made on the couture line. The model turned around, displaying the word and number \"zero\" on her back in a team jersey fashion. Eric asked what that signified. \"The number of designs that Ridge has actually given me!\" Rick complained. Rick worried that Ridge was bucking Rick's authority as president.\n\n\nCaroline received a text message from Ridge, and she left. Rick wanted to send Ridge back to Paris ... if and after Ridge did complete a couture line. Eric and Rick looked at the design that Ridge and Caroline had worked on. Eric noted that Caroline had definitely drawn it, but it had Ridge's attention to detail. Eric said it was stunning. Rick pointed out that it would make it easier to send Ridge to Paris, since Caroline could establish herself as a couture designer. Eric looked unhappy.\n\n\nOn the Forrester rooftop, Carter worked out on the weight equipment, and Maya admired his physique. Carter assumed Maya had been looking for Rick. He suggested that she stop embarrassing herself and Rick by chasing him. Maya insisted that she, not Caroline, was the right girl for Rick. Carter countered that Maya was a classless gold-digger.\n\n\nMaya maintained that she loved Rick and should never have let him slip away. Carter assumed she missed his money. Maya flashed back to when she and Rick had been running along Rodeo Drive. Maya vowed to never give up on a future with Rick. She told Carter that unless Rick and Caroline had a family, she would pursue him.\n\n\nCarter was shocked at Maya's inappropriate comments, but Maya said that Caroline had never respected her relationship with Rick. Carter warned Maya that Rick loved Caroline and was married to her. Maya seemed unconcerned.\n\n\nMaya quizzed Carter about the secrecy behind Ridge's designs for couture because no one had seen them. Carter would not discuss the designs. Maya wondered what had happened because the Hope for the Future line had been done. Maya pressured Carter for information because he was close to Ridge, but Carter refused to tell Maya anything.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Katie begged Ridge to share his inability to draw with Eric and Rick because it would be a good idea to have the company behind him. Ridge disagreed. Katie pointed out that Brooke had learned about his problem, and Ridge noted that Brooke had said nothing to anyone. Ridge wanted to keep it that way, and Ridge wanted to get Rick off his back. He planned to do it with Caroline's help. \n\n\nRidge lamented that he had almost lost everything in the fall from the helicopter. He flashed back to falling out of the copter and into the water. Ridge promised that it would not change his life. He called Caroline his muse. Caroline entered and overheard the comment. \n\n\n\"Oh my God, did I hear him call me his muse,\" Caroline exclaimed. Katie praised Caroline for helping her fianc\u00e9, and she noted that it was a good thing she wasn't the jealous type, but Katie did not look happy. Ridge said they had a lot of work to do, and Katie left.\n\n\nCaroline told Ridge that Rick and Eric were anxious to see his designs. Ridge asked if she had shown them their design, and she said they liked it. Ridge offered Caroline more design instruction, but she said she was tight on time. He asked her to sit at the drawing board, and he told her to envision a black cocktail dress. They discussed making it classic with a nod to the future or the past. She drew different designs and lines, but Ridge did not like them. \n\n\nCaroline grew frustrated, and Ridge guided her hand. They both approved. After changing the waistline, Ridge did not approve of some her suggestions. Frustrated again, Caroline urged him to take the pencil. \"You do it,\" she said. Ridge stared at the design, and suddenly Caroline realized what had happened. \"You can't. You can't draw,\" she said quietly.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Maya purred that she had found Rick all alone. \"My lucky day,\" she said. Rick showed Caroline and Ridge's collaborative design to Maya, and Maya noted that it had been worth the wait, but she ranted that Ridge should not have wasted his time with Caroline because she was so far out of his league. Maya continued to insult Caroline, and Rick told her to stop.\n\n\nMaya told Rick that Caroline was wrong for Rick. She boldly surmised that Rick and Caroline had not planned a family yet, and she wondered if it was because Rick had second thoughts. Rick was shocked at her prying into his personal matters. Maya did not stop. \"I still love you, Rick,\" she said. Rick looked confused. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Maya is forthcoming with Carter about her plan to win back Rick by doing whatever it takes to end his marriage with Caroline. Rick and Eric question Ridge\u2019s recent behavior and whether or not he is up to designing the upcoming collection. Caroline becomes suspicious as to why Ridge has taken such an interest in wanting to design with her. Maya tells Rick that she still loves him and assures him that Caroline is not the right woman for him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells Rick and Caroline that fashion shows are always a task but they make it look easy. Rick gives all the credit to his beautiful wife. He says she has been working on both the HFTF and the couture line as well. She gets a text from Ridge that he wants to see her. Maya happens to catch Carter on the Rooftop doing his workout. She approaches him and he says sorry to disappoint but Rick is not here. Her tracking device may not be working. She says she doesn't have to stay here and take this. He says but she will because he knows she wants something. She says Caroline and the couture line. She's working on HFTF so if anyone should know Carter would since he is Ridge's right hand man. Carter says they aren't engaged anymore so she can not use him anymore for inside scoop. If Rick is the guy she wants then ask him ..but then he's not into her either but she hasn't gotten the message yet. But she wouldn't let a little thing like a wedding ring get in her way. She says it doesn't hurt that he's rich and comes from a powerful family but she is so much better for him that Caroline Spencer. He corrects her and says Caroline Forrester. She says not for much longer if she has anything to say about it. She really can't believe she let Rick and the life with the Forrester's slip right through her fingers. She questions Carter if Rick and Caroline are going to start a family any time soon or practicing birth control. He's appalled that she would be asking him this. She says if Caroline got pregnant then she would stop pursuing Rick . a child changes everything. And she does respect marriage vows with one exception .when it comes to Caroline. Rick shows his dad some designs and says he thinks they should send Ridge back to Paris when he finishes the couture line .if he ever finishes it. He knows his dad wants to defend Ridge but he shows him the only tangible thing they have from Ridge. Eric looks at it and says it doesn't look like Ridge's but more like Caroline. Rick says his thoughts too and that means it will make it all the more easier to send Ridge back to Paris. He thinks Caroline has much potential in the couture line right here. Maya catches Rick and can't believe Ridge is wasting his time with Caroline as some distraction. Rick says he knows they aren't the best of buddies but she doesn't have to put Caroline down to him. Maya says she is sorry but Caroline is such an easy target. Rick says yes \u0096 beautiful, talented and sophisticated. Maya says he forgot self centered, vain and scrawny like a chicken but if she makes him happy. Rick says he is, they both have moved on. Maya says well at least one of them has. But she knows he must remember what it was like with her and now that his wife has deserted him for another man, well She even asks if they have thought about a family. He tells her she is getting awfully personal. She says she still loves him. Ridge is excited and tells Katie that he needs to finish his line with Caroline's help. She doesn't know she is helping but she is his muse and with Rick off his back he should be able to finish all of this soon enough. Caroline comes in and has overheard him calling her his muse. This delights her. Katie says yes her fiance did call her that. Good thing she is not the jealous type. Katie gets the hint that Ridge is ready to work and she doesn't want to impede progress so she gives him a kiss and is off. He tells Caroline that he enjoyed designing with her and thought he'd give her more instructions unless she has a problem with that. She's a little perplexed as he wants her to take a blank piece of paper and turn it into a fabulous black cocktail dress like no other. She thinks she ought to see his other sketches first so she is not off into a whole new direction. He tells her just close her eyes and visualize. She does not have a clear picture of just what he wants, and then he is not satisfied with what she draws. He places his hand on hers and guides it and they both are happy for a while. Then Caroline gets discouraged when he doesn't like something and she hands him the pencil and tells him to do it. He can't. She realizes he can't draw.",
