To Thomas, it didn't sound like Ivy, and he asked if Steffy trusted Ivy. Steffy didn't but was sure the video was gone. She added that they'd made a pact never to talk about it, and she wasn't thrilled that Thomas had told Caroline. Caroline promised that she'd never tell Ridge about it.\n\n\nRidge arrived. Steffy relayed that Lieutenant Baker had closed the investigation into Aly's death and had informed Thorne. It was good news to Ridge, who had what he hoped was more good news. Ridge and Caroline flashed the engagement ring, and Ridge said they were getting married.\n\n\nBlinking away her surprise, Steffy congratulated them and asked if it was what they wanted. In unison, they said they did. Steffy asked if Thomas had known about it, and he relayed that he'd be the best man. Caroline remembered that she had to meet Bill, and she rushed out.\n\n\nWith Caroline gone, Ridge said that Steffy could tell him what she really thought. Thomas asked Ridge if he'd tell Steffy the other part. Ridge revealed that he and Caroline were also starting a family.\n\n\nLater, Steffy absorbed the news of Ridge and Caroline's engagement happening after a one-night breakup. Ridge claimed it had been a significant night. He hadn't been able to get Caroline out of his mind that night. He'd wanted to talk to Caroline about the daughters that he and Thorne had lost.\n\n\nRidge stated that he hadn't wanted to lose Caroline, but she'd been out in the night, devastated an alone, wondering if she'd be enough. Thomas flashed back to kissing Caroline at the hotel.\n\n\nRidge said he'd called Caroline to make things right. Steffy asked if making it right was getting married and having a baby, which Caroline knew he didn't want. Steffy wondered if he'd thought it through. Ridge asked if she'd thought it through about Liam.\n\n\nRidge wanted to spend his life with Caroline, and he didn't ever want to feel how he'd felt when she'd walked out the door. Steffy asked if Thomas was okay with it. Thomas said it wasn't about him or his sister, and he wouldn't do anything to prevent Ridge and Caroline's happiness.\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Thomas entered Rick's old office, and Steffy said they were going to get real, because she knew the marriage wasn't what he wanted for Caroline. Thomas tried to change the subject to his promotion, but Steffy wasn't deterred and demanded to know what was going on.\n\n\nThomas told his sister to stop analyzing, but Steffy noted that he looked uncomfortable. He said he just wanted to get beyond the marriage and children talk. Steffy said it was a bad attitude for a best man. He asked to change the subject, and she concluded that he did have a problem. He asserted that he was fine with the couple and their happiness, and if Steffy didn't mind, he had a lot of work to do.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Katie and Bill arrived, claiming Caroline had summoned them there to hear some mysterious news. He asked Brooke to tell him what was going on. Brooke said she wasn't Caroline's confidante, but Bill believed Brooke was probably keeping tabs because of Ridge. Brooke replied that she and Ridge were friends -- nothing more.\n\n\nCaroline arrived, and Brooke decided to give the Spencers privacy. Caroline said Brooke could stay. Caroline asked her uncle to guess her news. Bill wouldn't play. Caroline flashed her ring as a hint. \"Oh -- my -- God. You're engaged,\" Katie said, and Brooke's eyes widened in shock.\n\n\nKatie wryly said that it was some rock. Bill asked if Caroline knew that Ridge had a drawer full of rings. Caroline knew that it was kind of weird because of everyone's history with Ridge; however, Katie was with Bill, and Brooke could have anyone she wanted. Katie called it unexpected, but it wasn't so for Bill, who'd seen the outcome from the moment Caroline had started working with \"that predator.\"\n\n\nCaroline noted that Brooke hadn't spoken. Brooke said marriage was a big commitment. \"Not to Ridge,\" Bill quipped. Bill remarked that it was one in a long line for Ridge. Brooke asked if the couple was ready for marriage. Caroline claimed that she and Ridge were committed, but Brooke said there was more to a marriage than two people. Brooke asked about Ridge being unable to give Caroline a family.\n\n\nShrugging, Caroline said she'd been happy to be with just Ridge. Bill was stunned that she'd forgo having children. Caroline stated that it hadn't been a deal breaker for her, but Ridge had changed his mind. Katie was stunned when Caroline told them that Ridge had given her a bassinet.\n\n\nBill asked if Caroline realized that she'd push Ridge in a wheelchair to the kid's graduation. Caroline relayed that Ridge wasn't that old, but Bill ordered her to do the math. Brooke asserted that Ridge hadn't wanted to have kids. Caroline repeated that he'd changed his mind.\n\n\nBrooke and Katie attested to seeing Ridge get caught up in the moment. Bill decided that Caroline would take a vacation and gain some prospective. Caroline called them \"Debbie downers.\" Brooke asked if Ridge had said he would give Caroline a child. Exasperated, Caroline conveyed that Ridge wanted what she wanted, so they'd have kids.\n\n\n\"Good luck with that,\" Brooke stated before gathering her things and leaving.\n\n\nCaroline told Katie and Bill that there should be celebrating, not mourning, and she'd thought Bill would be okay with it. Bill wondered where she got that from and said owning shares in Ridge's dressmaking company didn't mean Bill wanted his niece at the end of the aisle with Ridge. \"If there's a wedding -- I mean, when -- when there's a wedding ...\" Katie started to say.\n\n\nBill asked when the wedding was and grimaced when Caroline said it would be soon. Caroline stated that Bill \"and the boys\" were the only family she had, and she really needed support. Katie asked about Thomas. Caroline relayed that Thomas was just about the only supportive person.\n\n\nCaroline wanted Bill to be happy for her. She asked him to put aside his differences and do it for her. Bill replied that she was like his daughter, so of course, he'd be there for her, and they hugged.\n\n\nAfter Caroline had gone, Katie told Bill that he'd been sweet with his niece. He griped that it meant he'd been doing something wrong. Katie replied that he couldn't resist his niece, and it had been nice to watch. Bill hoped he didn't regret supporting Caroline. He didn't want to have to pick up the pieces. Katie reasoned that there might be none to pick up.\n\n\nBill said Ridge had better treat Caroline like a princess. \"Like you do?\" Katie replied. Bill replied that there was no comparison. She thought he was sexy when he was protective.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Brooke arrived and asked, \"Are you out of your mind?\" Ridge guessed she'd heard. She told him that he was in denial about Caroline, who was from a different era. He quipped that Stephanie had said that about Brooke and Eric. Brooke asked what the couple had in common besides an attraction. Ridge tossed a sketch toward Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke reasoned that they should leave it at a bohemian artist shacking up with a younger woman. Ridge quipped that a marriage wouldn't be \"bohemian.\" She reminded him of his \"grown\" children, one of whom still needed his attention. He claimed that he'd always be there for R.J.\n\n\nBrooke asked why Ridge was spinning dreams in Caroline's head. Ridge claimed that he wasn't. Brooke reminded him about the procedure he'd had, and he stated that he'd have it reversed. She asked if he'd consulted his doctor. He hadn't. She stated that there was no guarantee.\n\n\nBrooke guessed that Ridge hadn't told Caroline anything about it. Ridge claimed not to want to worry Caroline. Brooke declared that it had disaster written all over it. He assured Brooke that he and Caroline would get married, and it would last. Brooke insisted that he tell Caroline about the vasectomy.\n\n\nJust then, Caroline entered and guessed they were discussing weddings and babies. Brooke stated that Caroline had wanted children with Rick. Caroline didn't want to disrespect Brooke, who had feelings and a child with Ridge, but Caroline asked if it was hard to believe she'd want the same thing.\n\n\nBrooke remarked that it wasn't so simple. Ridge asked why Brooke was questioning things when he and Caroline would get married and be happy. \"And have a family,\" Caroline added. Ridge agreed.\n\n\n\"We'll see...\" responded Brooke. Caroline wanted to know what Brooke's problem was. Brooke hinted that Caroline didn't know everything. Ridge said there was nothing to know. Brooke stated that Caroline had expectations and a right to know. Brooke insisted that he tell it, or she would.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline and Thomas listen as Steffy tells them that the video has been deleted. Thomas does not think this sounds like the Ivy of late but hopes she came to her senses. Steffy is not happy that even Caroline knows but makes Caroline promise secrecy from Ridge. Ridge does breeze in and is happy when Steffy tells him that Lt. Baker called and they have dropped the investigation. Ridge says he has more good news. He and Caroline are engaged. The reluctant Steffy says she is okay with this if it is what they want. Caroline explains that her two mothers are happy too. She leaves to go inform Bill. Steffy reminds Thomas it wasn't that long ago that he and Caroline were more than friends. Now he is all for Caroline marrying his dad so she wants to hear more. He sloughs it off and she accuses him of not being a very good best man with this attitude. Brooke is working on the Sky Lounge when Katie and Bill walk out and say they have been summoned by Caroline with some news. Brooke looks worried. Caroline joins them and asks Brooke to stay as she has news for her too. She flashes her big rock on her fingers as Bill rolls his eyes and Brooke's widen. Bill makes a snarky remark that Ridge has had plenty of those already. Caroline says she knows several have a history with Ridge, both Katie and Brooke for instance. Yes they all have pasts but they have moved on. Both are surprised when she says they are also planning on having children despite Ridge originally saying he did not want another family. Bill makes another remark about Caroline pushing Ridge in a wheelchair to his son's graduation. Brooke says good luck with that. Although he is against it, Bill assures her if she marries he will be there in support. Brooke storms off and into Ridge's office and asks if he is out of his mind. She does not think this is something to joke about. He points out that she thinks Caroline is of a different era but that is exactly what Stephanie used to say about her when Brooke married Eric. Brooke tells him he already has grown children and one that still needs his attention. And there is no guarantee that his vasectomy can be reversed so he needs to tell Caroline .and if he doesn't she will.",
