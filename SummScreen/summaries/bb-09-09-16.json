    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Quinn that she knows what lengths Quinn went to in getting her and Wyatt together. Now the only hope of that is for Quinn to move out of Eric's. Eric talks to Stephanie's portrait over the mantle. He says he was just roaming around in this big house thinking of the kids at birthday parties and barbeques, and then it was just him sipping his coffee. But now there is a woman in his life. He is assuming Stephanie doesn't approve. The family thinks he is a fool. They are embarrassed and think this is stupid. He wants to know what she thinks about Quinn. He sits at the piano and says they had good music together and he remembers their wedding day and some wonderful times. He tears up and gives a cheer with his martini to Stephanie. Quinn says she cannot give up Eric and Steffy says then she cannot go home to Wyatt a divorce will be on Quinn. Brooke tells Ridge that just because he does not agree with what Eric is doing does not mean he has dementia. Ridge says true but they cannot rule it out. This is not just about an older man with a younger woman. Quinn comes home and tells Eric her woes that Steffy called them an abomination. They are never going to accept her. There seems to be no answer to please all. Steffy tells Thomas that she does not want to hurt Wyatt but she is not going to let Quinn hurt her granddad. That is all they can think about now is to get Quinn out of the company and eventually out of their lives. Eric tells Quinn that he has a lot to say but he is not sure just how. Only one other has had that much influence on him and that would be Stephanie and why he is thinking so much of her today. She says she knows she is nowhere close to what Stephanie was to him. She was supposed to just be a flirtation, something to look forward to but all of this changed them. She did not want to complicate his life but it seems to have spiraled out of control when he is around her. He asks her to stop and says he is not alone. Since Stephanie died he has been alone but he is not any more. He has Quinn so he will not listen to her talking about going away just to make Steffy and his family happy. Seems simple says Ridge; all Brooke has to do is marry Bill. He is not happy about that but she will get his FC shares and they can get Quinn out of the company. Eric says the uncertainly of what is going to happen may change the family's opinions. They would just have to accept that she is part of his life. They could make it permanent. She is shocked and says she thought he was breaking it off with her. He says no. She is the best thing that has happened in his life and he wants him family to stop being afraid of her. His instincts are screaming at him right now. He does not want her to leave this house or his side. He pulls out a huge diamond ring and asks her to marry him. Gleefully she cannot say yes fast enough. As they kiss Stephanie's portrait falls down off the wall. They just laugh.",
