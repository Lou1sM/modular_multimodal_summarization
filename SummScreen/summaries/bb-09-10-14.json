    "soap_central": "\n\nAfter Caroline realized that Ridge could not draw, she said, \"I'm sorry.\" She grabbed Ridge's hand, but he told her to stop. Caroline worried that she had made a mistake, and she wanted to understand what Ridge wanted her to do on the designs. Caroline promised to keep working with Ridge. She worried that he was hiding whatever was wrong.\n\n\nCaroline told Ridge to trust her. Ridge told her that he remembered how he had fallen out of the Spencer jet and that Bill's trusted employee had dumped him in the water. He added that a fisherman and his family had picked Ridge up, and they had not told anyone.\n\n\nRidge emotionally shared that her uncle had robbed him of what he'd done all his life. Ridge said that Bill had wanted him dead. \"And my hand won't do what I want it to do anymore,\" Ridge said. Caroline took his hand. \"Well maybe with some practice, mine can,\" she said.\n\n\nRidge nodded in agreement. He said they'd made a pretty good team. Caroline said she thought that RIdge had been helping her, but she had been helping him without knowing it. Caroline asked what doctors had said. \"Neuro-skeletal, neurological -- a lot of neuro,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline returned to designing a black cocktail dress, and Caroline praised Ridge. \"You've still got it,\" she said. She praised his knowledge of lightness and volume. Ridge said he could do everything except put it on paper. \"Work with me,\" he said. Caroline said it had been a fantasy of hers since she had started working at Forrester. She seemed hesitant, and Ridge promised to give her credit.\n\n\nCaroline said she would contribute anonymously, but Ridge had to know that people would eventually find out. Caroline worried about dealing with Rick. Ridge begged her not to tell Rick. Caroline grew uncomfortable, but she agreed not to tell Rick unless she had to. She would not sacrifice her marriage to help Ridge. Ridge understood.\n\n\nCaroline and Ridge vowed to keep it a secret, and they hugged. Maya walked in on them, unseen, and she stepped back out. Maya watched from the doorway and smiled, knowing she had something to take to Rick.\n\n\nOn the Forrester rooftop, Katie greeted Brooke and tried to mend their relationship. They agreed that it felt weird and awkward. \"The whole thing with Ridge has been so stressful,\" Katie said.\n\n\nKatie admitted that she'd missed her best friend -- Brooke. Brooke agreed that she had missed Katie as well. They tearfully agreed to stop fighting. Katie shared that she had tried to be supportive, but she worried about Ridge. She worried that Ridge felt like he'd been less of a man since he'd lost his ability to draw. She added that they'd talked about the future, travel, and parenting their boys, but they did not set dates or make wedding plans.\n\n\nBrooke said that Ridge needed time and support. Brooke shared that she could never talk to Bill about work -- when he had lost his job, but she agreed that she could also not share in his world. Brooke said that they shared the same problems. Katie agreed.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Maya had told Rick she loved him and put her hands on his shoulders. Rick told her to remove her hands. He was flattered that she'd thought she was still in love with him, but Maya corrected him -- she didn't think she loved him. She did love him.\n\n\nMaya said she believed that honesty was the best policy. Rick warned that he could fire her for being difficult, but Maya called his bluff. She knew that they had been good together, and she knew Rick remembered. Rick agreed, but he said he was married and in love with Caroline. \"I love being married. I've never been happier,\" he said.\n\n\nMaya said they had both been happy when they were together, but so many people had tried to pull them apart. \"The odds were so stacked against us,\" she said. Maya teased that difficult people at Forrester were often promoted rather than fired. They both laughed and bantered about the dynamics at Forrester.\n\n\nMaya later advised Rick that marriage wasn't forever. Maya noted that Caroline had been behaving recently, but Maya knew it wouldn't last. Rick agreed not to fire Maya, but she had to stop being rude to Caroline. Maya countered that Caroline had always been rude to her, and Caroline \"mangles my name any way she wants,\" Maya said. Maya added that Caroline had trained Rick to accept that behavior. Maya left. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Feeling pressure to deliver the kind of sketches that Ridge is anticipating, Caroline interrogates him about what\u2019s really going on. Determined to get what she wants, Maya shamelessly throws herself at an uninterested Rick. Brooke and Katie make a conscious effort to get their relationship back on track over lunch at Il Giardino. Ridge confesses to Caroline about his inability to draw.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline puts her hand on Ridge's and says she is sorry. He takes it away and says they came here to work. There is nothing to be sorry about. She tells him people love him and they will understand. He says there is nothing to understand. Caroline asks then what do they do now. Ridge says to make the corrections he asked her to make. She says she tried but she still didn't get it. He tells her try again. Brooke meets Katie for lunch and says this was a surprise. Katie says she came in with Ridge and thought they could have lunch like they used to. It's a little weird and awkward until they get their small talk out of the way. Katie is the first to say that things aren't that good. This whole thing with Ridge has been stressful and hard. She's like to talk to her best friend but ends up hanging up because her best friend is Brooke. She says she misses her sister, she misses her best friend so today she did not hang up. Brooke brightens up and says she misses Katie too. Katie says she is tired of being angry. She doesn't have that kind of energy anymore. Brooke says it does not have to be awkward. They are sisters and they love each other so no matter how much they have hurt each other in the past they will always love each other. And she can talk to her about anything. Katie says she just wants to do the right thing and give Ridge what he needs but she is not sure what that is. He needs to be creative. Does Brooke think that is why they aren't married yet, that he feels less than a man. Maya has her hand on Rick's shoulder. He calls attention to it and says it needs to be somewhere else .like not as on this person. She asks if he heard what she just said. He says yes, that she still loves him. She asks if that is uncomfortable for him. He says only because she can't seem to change the subject. She says unlike Caroline she thinks honesty is the best policy. And she also believes that somewhere he feels the same way too. He says this can go one of two ways. He can get mad and fire her .or. She asks why when she does her job well. He laments that she is difficult and pushy and won't listen to him. She says that worked for Caroline. He says or he could thank her for having feelings for him but nothing is ever going to come of it. He likes being married. He's never been happier. She continues that she has seen him happier. She made him happier. He shakes his head and says there was something just not quite right about them being together. Maybe it was too needy or dependent. Maya confesses that she felt it too but it had nothing to do with the way they felt about each other. It was like the odds were stacked against them and they had a right to be afraid of that. They have been through the worst so there is nothing to be afraid of anymore. She says she does not believe he is going to fire her. He says difficult people do not last long here. She scoffs, difficult people call the shots here. And she is hardly his biggest problem, Ridge is. And as much as she is aggravating him right now it is not half as bad as what Caroline pulled on her. Caroline asks Ridge why his hand is shaking. He says nervous habit, it's all right. She says it's only her here now. Rick is not here. He is going to have to tell him something eventually. He asks her if she wants to learn. She is not sure she is bright enough or talented enough. He tells her to stop. She is all those things and more. They make a good team. She says that is just it. She thought he was helping her, not that she was helping him too. She says he should have told her. She would be honored to work with him and know that he trusted her. He says trust is a funny word. What if he doesn't trust her that she and Rick are not going to finish what her Uncle Bill started. She's stunned when he says her uncle wanted him dead. He grabs the pen and tablet but can't do anything. He breaks the pencil into. He tells her his hand won't do what his mind wants it to. She slowly takes her hand and puts it on his and says with practice perhaps hers can. Rick tells Maya that she is cute when she is being coy. But too bad she is hardly ever coy anymore, just aggressive. She says yeah men get promoted for being aggressive but women get fired. She says she knows he remembers them too. He says yes, he didn't say he didn't, just that he was married. She says they know something that most people are too afraid to admit. He asks her to remind him. She says marriage is not forever. He and Caroline married too fast. Sure she is behaving now but the lies and secrets are gonna start up again any day now. Rick says she is right about one thing. He is not going to fire her. But if there are any more surprises like the steam room or being rude to Caroline, that is exactly what he will do. Ridge fills Caroline in on what happened in Dubai. Not many people know about it and he'd like to keep it that way. She asks what his doctor says. Ridge says it is all about neuro something and his doctor doesn't know if he will ever get what he lost back. But he thinks he will and he thinks it will be with Caroline. Katie tells Brooke that Ridge is so all consumed by not drawing that there is not much else to talk about. Brooke says artists are like that, work, work, work and that is what they talk about. Katie says and yes with Bill there were certain things that she did not want to know about. Katie says Ridge has not changed his mind about marriage. They talk about where they'd like to travel, how to parents the boys but it is vague and no dates or to do lists, just \"someday\". She does not want to add to his stress so she says nothing. He is the man she fell in love with, not sketches and designs and it would be fine with her if he never worked again. Brooke says but that is a future that Ridge could not contemplate. Katie says she knows. She wants to be whoever he needs but she doesn't know what that is. With his hand guiding hers, Caroline is able to finish another couture design. He thinks she can hand it to Rick. She says he still has it, all of it. He says yes all of it except the ability to put it down on paper so he needs her to work with him. She chuckles that is a fantasy she has been waiting to hear since she came to FC. And she wants no credit. There is no question in her mind that the design is his and she is happy to contribute. But people will eventually find out. He says they can't. They just need to continue doing what they are doing. She says she will but she has to tell Rick. Ridge is adamant, no if Rick finds out he is impaired he knows Rick doesn't want to hurt him but if he discovers a weakness then he will strike. And she needs to think about this if they continue this they can have a whole new line and the public loves Rick so it will be his success too. Finally she agrees. He says he knows he is not easy. She says she can handle it and learn from him. He says it will be their secret. He gives her a big hug. Maya starts to enter when she sees them hug. She has a big smile on her face.",
