Caroline told them to stop talking about her as if she wasn't there. Brooke said that his fianc\u00e9e had certain expectations, and Caroline guessed that the problem was R.J.'s feelings about the marriage and a new sibling.\n\n\nRidge was sure that no matter how R.J. felt, he'd eventually love Caroline, and Ridge added that there were no guarantees about the baby. She claimed to know it and said the fun was in the trying. Caroline decided to leave to work on a sketch, but before going, she assured Brooke that she'd never try to replace Brooke in R.J.'s .life, and she wasn't the wicked stepmother type.\n\n\nAfter Caroline had gone, Ridge laid into Brooke for trying to force his hand. He ordered her to stay out of his life with Caroline. Brooke said that she was a mother and knew what Caroline was going through. Ridge replied that Caroline was getting married and was happy. Brooke asserted that Caroline wanted a family, and he replied that they didn't know if it wasn't possible.\n\n\nBrooke explained that Ridge never wanted to disappoint his beloved, but vasectomies couldn't always be reversed. It was wrong to start the marriage with a lie, and Caroline deserved to know. Ridge wished Brooke would be done, but she said that if she were Caroline, she wouldn't want to be in the dark about something so critical. He claimed not to be keeping Caroline in the dark.\n\n\nRidge said Caroline had been through enough, and his vasectomy could be reversed. Brooke repeated that it wasn't always true. She'd done the research and asked if he had. Squirming, Ridge said he had a company to run, and she'd heard him say that there were no guarantees. Brooke replied that Caroline didn't know why, and any woman would want to know.\n\n\nBrooke wished she'd gone about addressing her concerns in a different way. She asked if Ridge had seen his doctor. Ridge hadn't. She asked if he'd been online. Ridge said he'd do all that, but he had a wedding to plan. He revealed that he'd told Caroline that they'd have a child in a year.\n\n\nBrooke hoped it worked out, \"but if it doesn't -- \" Ridge cut her off, saying he couldn't think like that, and he didn't want to worry Caroline unnecessarily. Ridge didn't want Brooke to worry, either, and asked her to keep it between them. He said that it was his secret, and no one else would know.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Thomas flashed back to his time on the bed with Caroline before they'd had sex. Nicole and Zende entered with some fabrics Thomas had asked for. Thomas seemed zoned into his work until Zende zapped him out of it. Thomas apologized, saying he was behind on his work and preoccupied with the other things going on.\n\n\nNicole didn't want to be in suspense, and Thomas said that Ridge and Caroline were getting married. Nicole remarked that Thomas looked as if the proposal had been the last thing he'd expected. Thomas said that relationships were complicated, and he revealed that the couple planned to start a family. Zende asked if Ridge was okay with it, and Thomas repeated that relationships were complicated.\n\n\nThomas explained that Ridge had already made two families. Nicole thought it was sweet that Caroline had made Ridge want to try for a third one. Thomas told them that they all needed to get back to business. Thomas figured that Ridge and Caroline were a little distracted, but Thomas, Zende, and Nicole were the future of Forrester; people expected big things from them.\n\n\nThomas wanted Zende to work closely with Thomas and even create some designs. The excited Zende left with some bolts. Nicole told Thomas that she hoped he was really happy for his father, and she recalled that Thomas had dated Caroline. Thomas replied that it had been a long while back.\n\n\nLater, at the sky lounge, Nicole and Zende worked out on break. Zende gave her pointers and expressed concern for his \"peeps\" when she attempted a heavier weight. She preferred that he called her something else, and when he called her his partner in crime, she said that guys were clueless. He replied that guys might know how to mess with girls' beautiful heads.\n\n\nZende wondered if Thomas had been serious about working together. Nicole figured Thomas had meant it; however, she wasn't sure he meant his happiness about Caroline and Ridge. Nicole sensed that something was going on where Thomas and Caroline were concerned. Zende warned her to be careful talking about the CEO's son. Nicole said she wouldn't mess up the chance Ridge had given her. Zende was glad because he liked having her around there.\n\n\nLater, Thomas was returning to Rick's old office as Caroline was leaving it for the bathroom. They were both designing in the room, and he asked if there was a problem with them sharing the office. Caroline claimed that there wasn't and left for the bathroom.\n\n\nWhen Caroline returned, she let Thomas know that Pam had lemon bars on her desk with his name written on each one. Caroline was just joking, and he remarked that it was great to see her in that kind of mood again. Caroline stated that they each knew why she hadn't been in a joking mood.\n\n\nStammering, Caroline revealed that she'd thought she might be pregnant, but she knew for certain that it wasn't the case. She was letting him know in case he'd had concerns. The idea of pregnancy hadn't occurred to Thomas. She said her mind drummed up worst-case scenarios; however, she wasn't pregnant, and they didn't have to worry about it.\n\n\nThomas told Caroline that he wasn't the type of guy to take advantage of a woman, and he hadn't known about the drug. Caroline knew it, and she believed him. Thomas felt awful. He was sorry she'd gone through it, even if he sometimes still wondered about them. She said it was the last time they talked about that night. It was their secret, and no one would find out.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline wants to know what Brooke and Ridge are talking about; and when both clam up, she thinks she knows it is something Brooke thinks Ridge ought to tell Caroline as the prospective bride. She guesses it might be about RJ, perhaps he is upset they are getting married. She wants to assure Brooke that she would never try to replace her, and she is not the wicked stepmother type. Ridge takes Caroline out the door and slams it. He tells Brooke that this is his life and she needs to butt out. He explains he would have never told her about the vasectomy if he thought she was going to hold it over his head. She says he can not be certain the procedure can be reversed and Caroline deserves to know that since she is counting on having children. He can not start off a marriage with such a huge secret.
