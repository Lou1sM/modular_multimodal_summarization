Then before she leaves, Hector walks in and she gives it to him with both barrels. She accuses him of taking advantage of Taylor and if he doesn't leave, she will throw him out herself. He preaches his theory again that Taylor will spend 20 years in prison and Thorne will never recover.

Shane watches Thorne and Taylor from the shadows and he sees him make a date with Taylor and kiss her. Alone, Taylor tells herself this is just a secret she will have to keep forever from Thorne.",
