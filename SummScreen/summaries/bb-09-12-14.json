    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Bill's office, Quinn arrived with a bottle of scotch. Bill readily declined to drink any beverage from her. She'd arrived to make sure he'd keep her secret, and he drearily replied that he'd do it only because it would do no good to stir things up -- but not because he approved of Quinn's actions.\n\n\nQuinn seemed impressed with herself for her accomplishments, and she wished Bill wouldn't be \"so touchy\" about it. Bill responded that he didn't have a problem with secrets, but her brand of manipulation was going to stop. Quinn touted that she'd done the family a favor. Hope and Wyatt were together, and Liam was moving on with his life, all because of Quinn.\n\n\nBill ordered Quinn to count herself lucky and back off. Quinn claimed that Liam had nothing to fear from her because he wasn't in her way. Bill insisted that she back off of Hope and Wyatt, too, and let all three people live their lives. Bill warned that Wyatt would turn against Quinn if he learned what she'd done, but Quinn insisted that \"our\" secret was safe.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Wyatt accused Liam of overreacting to think the house swap was a conspiracy. In Wyatt's view, he and Hope simply needed more space. Liam chided Wyatt for not even wanting Bu around due to Hope's memories of the past but then magically wanting to live in a house loaded with those memories. Wyatt claimed that he and Hope would make new memories there.\n\n\nLiam asked if marrying Hope and returning to Forrester wasn't enough for Wyatt. Wyatt admitted that it wasn't. He and Hope had bigger plans for their lives. Wyatt insisted the house was perfect for him and Hope. He asked if Liam couldn't see kids at \"that\" table or running around outside in \"that backyard.\" Wyatt said that Liam might disagree, but Hope would be excited about it.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Hope wanted Ivy to agree that Liam needed time, but Ivy contended that the man who'd jumped into the river to save her had no problems making quick decisions. Ivy felt that one could tell a lot about a person by his decisions, and Liam's decision to save her had spoken of man he was.\n\n\nIvy pointed out that Hope had made a decision that day, too, and it had been to leave and marry Wyatt. Hope asked what her decision had said about her. Ivy replied that it said Hope loved Wyatt. Hope claimed that she did very much, and Ivy stated that it was only fair to let Liam move on, too.\n\n\nLater, Hope was alone in deep thought when Wyatt arrived. He hoped that a kiss could change her reticent mood. After the kiss, he studied her and asked if everything was okay. \"Now it is,\" she claimed, smiling. Wyatt guessed that she'd had the kind of day he'd had.\n\n\nWyatt said that he and Liam kind of needed to work some things out. Wyatt didn't seem forthcoming about the Liam issue, so Hope asked Wyatt about the surprise he had for her. Hope tried to guess at the surprise, and he told that she'd seen it before. \"We lived there, sort of,\" he said. She frowned blankly, and he announced that he wanted them to move into the cliff house.\n\n\nHope became perplexed by the proposal. Wyatt said he'd already talked to Liam and Bill. \"And they agreed?\" Hope incredulously asked. Wyatt said it wasn't a done deal, and he knew that Liam wouldn't just hand over the keys. Hope readily agreed because it was Liam's house. Wyatt corrected that Liam was just staying there, like Wyatt was just staying at the beach house.\n\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Hope said with a placating smile. Hope didn't know why Wyatt would want to live with her in a house full of memories of her last relationship. Wyatt proposed that they make new memories, and he raved about how much space and amenities the house had. \"It has everything that I want for our family,\" he concluded.\n\n\nHope seemed taken aback, and Wyatt replied that, because they were married, he'd been thinking about kids. Hope guessed that he hadn't been kidding when he'd said he'd had a surprise for her. He said they didn't have to start right away, but he wanted her to know that he'd be ready.\n\n\nIn the security office, Charlie studied a rollaway whiteboard on which he'd made an investigative chart littered with sticky notes, pictures of Quinn and the Eiffel Tower, and maps. He'd used some of Pam's knitting yarn to string connections between the pictures and notes.\n\n\nPam entered, and he coolly rolled the board so that his project faced the wall. Pam was puzzled about where he'd been. At first, Charlie was tight-lipped about his activities, but he quickly admitted that he was seeing if something would pan out before he told her about it. She asked if it was a surprise for her. He asked if she'd like to see Hope and Liam back together.\n\n\nPam believed it would never happen, but Charlie stated that it might -- if Quinn had pushed Ivy into the Seine. Pam replied that Quinn hadn't even been in Paris. \"Was she?\" Pam asked. Charlie said he was checking on that very thing, and if Quinn had been there, Customs would have a record of it. He was waiting for a response from one of his Customs contacts.\n\n\nMoments later, the Customs contact text-messaged Charlie a document, and Pam was shocked that Charlie was right. Charlie exclaimed that the dates and times were right there, and Quinn had gone through Customs around the same time Ivy had plunged into the river. He said that big cities had cameras everywhere, and if Quinn had been anywhere near the bridge, a camera would have recorded it. He had another contact who he was sure could find the footage.\n\n\nPam got a peek at Charlie's board while he was on the phone with the Forrester International liaison who'd been in charge of surveillance at the Paris photo shoot. The contact agreed to acquire surveillance footage from in and around the garden and Eiffel Tower. Charlie also asked for airport footage to prove that Quinn had actually flown to the city.\n\n\nAfter a while, Charlie's contact sent overhead video footage from outside the airport. On the black-and-white footage, Pam and Charlie saw a disguised Quinn stealing a scooter to pursue Liam and Ivy. Next, the duo viewed the footage of the bridge. They zoomed in to better see Liam and Ivy. Pam gasped when she saw Quinn, in a scarf and sunglasses, shove Ivy off the bridge.\n\n\nBack at the cliff house, Liam reflected upon his memories with Hope that had transpired in his house and around the world. He was startled when Ivy, who'd entered the house, touched his shoulder. He smiled and wiped away a tear. Liam seemed out of sorts to Ivy, and he murmured that Wyatt wanted to take Liam's house and raise \"mini-mes\" in it with Hope.\n\n\nLiam asserted that Wyatt was just like his mother, and the pair took, and took, and took. Ivy felt that Liam had a right to be upset, and she gathered that the house meant a lot to him. \"Maybe more than I realize,\" he uttered. He stammered that he'd really thought he was ready, and he did feel that he could be close. \"You're just not ready yet,\" Ivy knowingly concluded.\n\n\nJust then, a loud banging sounded on the door. Liam rushed to it and let in Pam and Charlie. Glad that Ivy was there, too, Pam said Ivy and Liam wouldn't believe what she and Charlie had to show them. Charlie and Pam explained that it had to do with the bridge in Paris.\n\n\nPam stated that Liam and Hope had been steps away from uniting, but Quinn hadn't been about to let it happen. Ivy and Liam dismissed the discussion because Quinn hadn't even been at the fashion shoot. Liam added that Quinn had been in Los Angeles. Shaking her head, Pam insisted that Quinn hadn't been.\n\n\nCharlie displayed the scooter footage of Quinn from the airport, and Ivy was surprised to conclude that Quinn had been on Ivy and Liam's plane. Charlie continued showing the footage, and Ivy and Liam saw Quinn push Ivy off the bridge. Pam declared that Liam hadn't lost Hope by an act of faith. It had been because of Quinn. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Charlie receives a call from a friend who lets him know that Quinn made a short trip to Paris at the same time Liam and Ivy did. He and Pam receive additional information that proves Quinn\u2019s other offenses while in France. Bill gives Quinn the benefit of the doubt regarding her reasoning for pushing Ivy into the Seine. Ivy implores Hope to allow Liam some space to move on with his life.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt explains that this is not a conspiracy. He and Hope just need more space. Liam mentions him passing off Bu to him but this is not going to work. Bill will not throw him out of his house. Is it insecurity or greed. Wyatt says he and Hope have more plans and this place is perfect for them and he thinks Hope will be excited about this too, a place for their kids to play outside. Charlie has a whole wall set up of \"suspects\" of Quinn, Paris trip, Ivy falling, trying to piece the puzzle together. He asks Pam if she'd like to see Hope and Liam back together. She says yes of course, but it is a little crazy. He says it might turn out to be nothing but Quinn is capable of this and she might have found out about Paris and it was she that pushed Ivy into the Seine. He does some checking and finds customs did show Quinn went to Paris that day, same day that Ivy fell into the Seine. He finds a French girl who set up the shooting for the photo shoot and they had cameras everywhere. They need something that even Quinn can not talk herself out of. Pam wants to call Liam and warn him that Quinn was in Paris at the same time. Charlie says no, you don't poke a snake until you are ready to strike. He looks at the footage and they do spot Quinn on the stolen bike and where she is following Liam and Ivy in the cab. Quinn visits Bill and he tells her that he has no problem with secrets but her manipulation is gonna stop. She continues that she did everybody a favor. Hope and Ivy continue their conversation of what is best for Liam. Ivy gets Hope to admit that she does love Wyatt. Ivy feels that is her answer. She should leave Liam's love life alone. While he is deeply thinking about Hope, Ivy walks in on Liam. She says the door was open so she came on in. Pam tells Charlie that she is really proud of him following his gut feeling. Quinn again - they saw her bump Ivy into the river. Wyatt warns Hope that the surprise is pretty big, but it's not quite ready. He wants them to move into the cliff house. Liam explains his mood is that Wyatt wants to move into his house. He's all ready to start a platoon of little me me's. Liam says he thought he was ready and pretty close but this really hit him. There is a heavy banging at the door and it's Pam and Charlie who tell Liam they have something to show him and he will never believe this. Bill tells Quinn that she got what she wanted; back off, no more games. She says Liam is safe, she has no reason to go after him anymore. She says no one is gonna find out she pushed Ivy. Hope is shocked that Wyatt wants to live at Liam's where she has a ton of memories with her ex. He says they can make new memories. And it has everything he wants for his family. She is surprised at that. He says it does not have to be today or next week, but he is ready. Pam and Charlie question Ivy about her fall. They explain it was not Ivy they were after, but Hope. She was right there in Liam's sight and Quinn did not want him to get to her. They show them the footage .it was not some act of fate, it was Quinn!",
