    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody descends on Liam about the same time. First Steffy comes in and is shocked at the bruised look of his face but before she can say anything Wyatt, Jarrett and Justin come in. Liam tells them to close the door. As of this moment his dad has signed papers and is no longer CEO; he will be running the company. Wyatt is shocked and says something is wrong here. This is Bill's company not Liam's and there is no way he would have left it like this so do not get too comfortable in that chair. He charges out. Brooke is surprised to see Bill at home but he says he is doing what he said he would do. He is taking a leave of absence. He tells Brooke that Liam will be running Spencer Publications. He used to trust Liam, now he is not so sure. Wyatt walks in and says perhaps he can explain that to him too why he left the company in his charge. Liam has Justin stay while the others go and says he knows he has been unfailingly loyal to his father to a fault. He expects that same loyalty as well. Justin repeats again that he works for Spencer Publications as a fixer, that is who makes him who he is. So as of now that means he will do the same for Liam. Liam tells Justin to tell Alison to pack up all of Bill's things and get them out of the office. Wyatt shouts at Bill that he does not even know what time off is but that aside why Liam in charge? It could have been both of them. Bill says this is only temporary and he does not have to answer to him. This is how it has to be so get out. Justin calls and tells Bill that he did not get fired and he will be working with Liam as best he can to look out for the company. Bill says good, he wants to know any changes Liam makes in personnel, anything. Brooke cannot believe Bill talked to his own son, Wyatt, that way. Liam confides in Steffy that Bill called him a traitor and that he would decimate him. But what matters to him is to run this company well and her be at his side. Brooke tells Bill that she wants to know more but she wants him to tell her on his time not on hers. Liam chides Wyatt for not knocking first. Wyatt says him acting all territorial doesn't make him king ..this stone cold hardness. Liam says there is nothing wrong with being ruthless for the right reasons. Steffy walks in on Bill and rails and says he could have used words and not his fists. Bill says he did use words but Liam didn't listen and he pushed too hard this time. Steffy says Liam still wants him to be proud of him someday so this will be a wall between them. Bill holds a video and said his father made that and made him promise he would watch it someday after he died. So he knows all about that wall. His world is now spinning out of control and Liam is his son and he is sorry it came to this. Steffy says she is a Spencer too and she is not going to let this tear them apart. She gives him a big hug.",
