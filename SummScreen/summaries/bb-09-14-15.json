    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge told Caroline that they could still do the traditional wedding, but Caroline cooed that they were getting married, and the two kissed.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Thomas cringed when he walked up on Pam blindfolding and flirting with Charlie. She held up a plate of food and invited Thomas to play their game of \"guess the missing ingredient.\" She and Charlie were practicing for a contest they were in. Thomas declined, and as he moved toward the CEO's door, Pam advised him to knock because Caroline and Ridge were alone in the room.\n\n\nThomas opened the door and saw Caroline and Ridge kissing. Thomas said he didn't mean to interrupt, but he had some revisions for Ridge. Ridge replied that Thomas could take his time because Ridge wouldn't have time to review them. Thomas asked why, and Ridge replied that he was getting married. Thomas responded that he knew it already. \"Today,\" Ridge added.\n\n\nThomas was surprised. Ridge said that Thomas didn't have to worry about being the best man and that the couple would wed in a house Ridge's friend had just finished building. Thomas asked if he could help in any way, and Ridge told his son to hold down the fort. As the couple rushed toward the door, Thomas congratulated them. His face darkened after they left.\n\n\nBack in the corridor, Pam was blindfolded as Nicole approached to find Thomas. Pam's phone rang. She answered the stapler. Charlie removed the stapler from her hand and gave her the phone receiver. Nicole pressed a button Pam needed on the phone, and Charlie believed Nicole deserved a raise. Pam asked Nicole to be in charge of the office's smoothie orders that day.\n\n\nLater, Nicole was in the CEO's office, giving Thomas some files and asking him about his smoothie. She noted that he was distracted and guessed it had to do with Caroline. He agreed that he was a little preoccupied because Ridge and Caroline had left to exchange vows that very day.\n\n\nNicole said that it sucked. Thomas replied that it didn't, and he was happy for the couple. She didn't believe he was happy that his father was marrying the girl he'd once been into. \"Used to,\" Thomas emphasized. She guessed he was looking miserable for some other reason. He said it was his \"resting bitch\" face, and he did want her to get him a berry smoothie.\n\n\nNicole offered to be there if Thomas wanted to talk, but he said he was good. She said that the marriage was huge. Thomas agreed but stated that it didn't affect him. Nicole said it was clear how distracted he was. \"Maybe there's something else distracting me,\" Thomas replied and kissed her.\n\n\nIn Malibu, Ridge and Caroline had changed into casual wedding attire at the stone, ranch-style estate. Out by the infinity pool, Ridge said they could call Carter if she wanted, but saying vows and making a commitment was something Ridge thought they could do alone. She asked if they needed to sign papers, but he told her they could do it at city hall later. She asked where they'd start. Taking her hand, he responded that he had a place in mind.\n\n\nLater, Ridge walked to the corner of a stone landing beside the ocean. Caroline walked to him. He guessed he should ask if anyone objected. Looking at the grass and ocean, he shrugged and decided they were good.\n\n\nTaking Caroline's hands, Ridge said he was doing so as a symbol of what had drawn them together as artists. He said they'd guide each other, hold on to each other, and never let go from that day forward. Ridge stated that the marriage wouldn't change who they were as individuals, but it would change who they were as a couple and how they saw the world.\n\n\nRidge still couldn't believe that someone like Caroline wanted him. Caroline joked that she could back out. He told her that it was way too late, and they owned pieces of each other that they could never get back. He couldn't wait to call her his wife and for them to have a family, if they could.\n\n\nRidge could see Caroline pregnant and holding the baby. He knew that she'd be happy. He felt that they could handle anything as long as they were together. Ridge said traditional vows to take Caroline as his wife for as long as they both would live.\n\n\nCaroline recalled that, in the beginning, they'd been stuck as individuals, but together, they'd been unstoppable. She hadn't understood it until it had gone full circle after her accident. Together, they'd helped him to draw and her to walk. It made her unafraid because, as long as they were together, they could conquer anything. Caroline said traditional vows to Ridge to take him as her husband.\n\n\nRidge wanted a kiss, but Caroline said he'd forgotten the rings. He slipped one on her finger and said the ring had no end, just like them. Caroline slipped one on his finger. She told him to always think of that day and know that everything that she embodied from that day forward was his forever. Ridge pronounced them husband and wife, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Ivy declared that Steffy had no right to fire Ivy from the family business. Liam asked if Steffy wanted to slow down and talk to Ridge first. Steffy was certain that Ridge would back her decision, and she stated that she couldn't work with someone she couldn't trust. Ivy replied that she'd deleted the video, but Steffy said it had been after holding it over Steffy's head.\n\n\nSteffy said that Ivy's change of heart hadn't changed the blackmailing and threats. She believed that she was being nice to send Ivy home instead of to jail. Steffy stated that Ivy could go where she wanted, as long as it was far from Steffy.\n\n\nIvy felt that her uncle would be disgusted by Steffy's actions. Steffy thought Eric would feel the same about Ivy using Aly's death to further a career. Ivy claimed not to have done that, but Liam said it was a moot point because Ridge was in charge. Ivy decided to talk to Ridge, and Steffy said Ivy could do it after she'd left the building. Ivy refused to leave because she was a Forrester and belonged there.\n\n\nSteffy called Pam and asked for security. Ivy thought it was ridiculous. Steffy offered to call it off if Ivy complied. Charlie and another guard entered on high alert. Steffy said that Ivy had been fired, and she wanted Charlie to escort Ivy out of the building. Liam interjected that there had to be a better way.\n\n\nIvy agreed, and Liam asked her to just leave peacefully. She couldn't believe he was agreeing with Steffy. Liam said it didn't matter if he agreed or not; Steffy was in charge and didn't trust Ivy. Wyatt stated that Steffy's trust in Ivy had nothing to do with the quality of Ivy's work. Liam said that Steffy had the authority -- in fact Steffy and Liam both did. Steffy asked if they could get it over with.\n\n\nCharlie told Ivy that he was sorry then he and the guard seized her. Ivy complained as they shuffled her out of the office and onto the elevator. Wyatt boarded, too, saying that Liam and Steffy would regret it. Ivy asked Liam to stop it from happening. He said he was sorry. The elevators doors closed, Liam's face darkened, and Steffy walked off.\n\n\n",

He is getting married. Thomas is stunned and caught off guard but wishes them well. Ivy tells Steffy that her uncle Eric would not stand for this and Steffy needs a reason.
