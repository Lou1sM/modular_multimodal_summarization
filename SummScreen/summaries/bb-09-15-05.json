She tells him that they will never be.  \"Someday,\" says Brooke, \"you will thank me, when your baby's born.\"  She assures him that he will have no regrets in doing what must be done, because he will love Bridget for everything that is going to be, between the two of them.  Nick assures Brooke that he will bury what has happened between them, and go on with his life with Bridget. \n\n\nGaby and Thomas talk about what they are planning to do.  Sally comes in and talks with them.  Thomas tells her that his Father is going to have their marriage annulled.  She shows Thomas the sales reports on the line that he created.  They are impressive enough to make Sally tell him that he can go on to college and become something, that will take a long time, or he can sign on with them and reap the benefits now, while he is considered a hot commodity.  He thinks about it, and thanks her for the opportunity, but tells her no, because his future plans have all ready been put in place by his Dad.  Sally pulls out all stops and show him an extra \"sign on bonus\", which would pay off his Father for anything that was done, and allow him to be his own man, if he signs.\n\n\nBridget and Dante dance, but Bridget's mind wanders over to the table where Nick and her Mother are sitting.  She wonders what they could be talking about.  Her insecurities are coming to surface once again, and Dante realizes it.  As they return to the table, Bridget suggests that they leave and go to the pool.  Each one has a reason that they would prefer not to go, but, Bridget is not taking no for an answer, because the evening is supposed to be a celebration.  She excuses herself for a moment to head for the \"pottie,.\"  Something, that she figures she will be doing a lot of in the near future.  While she is gone, Dante tells them both (Nick and Brooke) that Bridget was watching them closely, and it didn't look like to her, that they were getting over anything.  He leaves to pay the bill.  Nick tells Brooke that he will do what she wants, but he will not stand around watching Dante put his hands all over her.  Brooke tells him that it is necessary for Bridget to see, so she can be convinced.  \n\n\nAt the pool, Brooke and Dante sit alone and talk.  He tells her that he will do what she wants.  She is determined to convince Bridget that she and Nick are no longer together in anyway.  Dante is afraid that the whole evening could blow up in their faces.  \n\n\nOn the other side of the pool, Bridget makes a comment about Nick not liking Dante.  She admits to him that he and her Mother make a good looking couple together, and doesn't he think so also?  When he doesn't answer, it forces her to ask him if it bothers him to see her with another man?  Bridget becomes unsettled, and tells Nick that she is carrying his child and planning on marrying him, and that she deserves to know the truth.\n\n\nEric brings Jackie home.  Jackie is still insisting that Nick and Brooke belong together.  He tells her that, being together and being happy are two different things.  They believe in what they are doing, and that it will be the best for everyone, and maybe it will. \n\n\n",
