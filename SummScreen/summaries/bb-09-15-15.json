Nicole noted that he had kissed her \"out of the blue for no reason.\" Thomas answered that she talked too much, but Nicole thought that Thomas hadn't liked the conversation. She wondered if Thomas was upset that Ridge was marrying Thomas' old flame.\n\n\nThomas scoffed that Nicole was off base. He wondered if she had liked the kiss. Nicole laughed and said that she would have been flattered, but it had nothing to do with her. Thomas admitted that he and Caroline had been together, but it \"was over almost as soon as we started,\" he said.\n\n\nNicole persisted and asked why he had kissed her. He teased that she had been standing there \"all gorgeous.\" Nicole maintained that she wanted to assess Thomas' motives. She said he was competitive -- like his dad. Thomas answered that his dad had learned from his dad and had refined designs and made them better, and Thomas intended to do the same thing.\n\n\nNicole noted that Thomas had a look of confidence and determination in his eyes. \"They are windows to the soul,\" Nicole said. Thomas received a message that Caroline had posted a picture. \"She and Dad are married,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nAt the Malibu house where Ridge and Caroline had recited vows, they shared how happy they were. They walked from the house to the beach, and Ridge carried Caroline's shoes. She noted that the scenery was breathtaking. She was happy that it had been just the two of them. She said it was appropriate because they had been their own little design team off in their own world.\n\n\nConversation turned to having a baby, but Caroline said she wanted to enjoy being married to Ridge for a little while. He teased that they would be all alone when they were stuck in traffic on the way to city hall to make everything legal. They kissed.\n\n\nRidge wondered if Caroline regretted that her friends and family had not been part of the ceremony. \"All I need is you,\" she said. She marveled that he had done and planned everything. Ridge responded that she deserved a beautiful wedding memory. They each promised there would be many more.\n\n\nCaroline said she was insanely happy. Ridge agreed. He had thought he'd been fine before she had entered his life. \"I am humbled to call you mine,\" he said. Caroline recalled that when she had first arrived at Forrester, she had been \"thrilled to be in the same room with the most talented designer and breathe the same air.\"\n\n\nRidge promised to keep making things happen for them. \"I love you, husband,\" Caroline said with a smile. \"Oh, I love you, wife,\" Ridge answered. They kissed.\n\n\nAt an outdoor restaurant, Bill and Katie ate lunch, and Bill said he needed something stronger than wine because his niece was marrying \"Forrester.\" Katie told him she was proud of him because he had supported it. Katie told Bill she needed a new project to flex some new muscles. \"I'll make it happen,\" Bill said.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam told Steffy that she had surprised him when she had fired Ivy. Steffy said she could not allow Ivy to order her around and act like nothing had happened. Liam looked uncomfortable. Steffy ordered Liam to tell Quinn that she would be handling the jewelry line alone. Liam asked if Steffy was sure it was what she wanted. \"Business is business,\" she said.\n\n\nLiam was concerned that Steffy's behavior had been out of character. He reminded Steffy that they had made a pact together that they would put the past behind them. Steffy agreed, but she said that the video concerns were over, and Ivy was fired because Steffy didn't trust her.\n\n\nLiam worried about Wyatt's threat that they would regret their decision. Steffy said the video was gone, and Ivy had nothing that would hurt her. Liam noted that Wyatt never made idle threats. Steffy said she had never dreamed that Ivy would be capable of blackmail. Liam agreed. Steffy was glad it was over, and she worried that if Wyatt aligned himself with Ivy, it could backfire. He would be next to be fired.\n\n\nLiam looked surprised. He said she looked different. She admitted that she felt much better because a weight had been lifted. She wanted to get started on their future. \"We've waited far too long for that,\" she said, and Liam agreed. They embraced.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Wyatt and Ivy entered the house, and Ivy lamented that she couldn't believe Steffy had fired her. Wyatt agreed it had been outrageous. They both were shocked that Liam had been totally on board and had said nothing to stop Steffy.\n\n\nWyatt had good news. \"When I told them they were going to regret it, I meant it,\" he said. Wyatt promised to shake up Steffy and Liam's happiness. Steffy said she had to return to the Forrester mansion to get her things because Steffy's influence was everywhere. She left. Wyatt called Bill and said he needed to talk to him.\n\n\nLater, Bill and Katie showed up at Wyatt's, and Wyatt told them that Ivy had been fired from Forrester. Bill assumed that Ridge had fired her, but Wyatt said it had been Steffy. He added that Ivy hadn't wanted to go, so Steffy had gotten security to escort Ivy out of the building. He added that Liam had done nothing to help Ivy.\n\n\n\"This is about Liam?\" Bill asked. Wyatt agreed. He noted that he was upset and angry because Liam was president at Spencer and VP at Forrester. He had control of everything. Wyatt asked what Liam had done to increase Bill's control of 12.5 percent of Forrester.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that Liam and Steffy treated everyone like dirt. Wyatt wanted to carve out his own business under the Spencer Publications umbrella. He wanted to start a design house that would compete with Forrester and take them down. Katie looked interested, and Bill looked thoughtful.\n\n\nIn a luxurious cabana on the beach near their wedding site, Ridge and Caroline made out and slowly undressed one another. Flashbacks displayed Ridge learning to design again with help from Caroline, Ridge painting Caroline and them making love with paint all over them, and Ridge helping Caroline learn to walk again with her walker. The montage faded out to Ridge and Caroline making love to the music of \"Love's Masterpiece,\" written by Casey Kasprzyk, Anthony Ferrari, and Matt Pav, and performed by Isabelle.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline and Ridge are both giddy that they are married. Nicole tells Thomas that he kissed her out of the blue for no reason and she did not see that coming. She says she is flattered if it had anything to do with her but something tells her that it didn't. He heads her off and says he and Caroline were over a long time ago; almost before it started. Now she is marrying his dad and that is a line he will not cross. Liam says that was quite a scene with Ivy as she did not expect it. Steffy tells him they need to let Quinn know she is on her own now. He questions her decision but Steffy says she had no choice. She could not let her blackmail her. Ivy grouses to Wyatt that she can not believe that Steffy fired her. Wyatt takes her side and says they will regret it. Over lunch Bill does not want to talk about Caroline as she is marrying Ridge today. Katie says she is ready for a new challenge and a new project, something she can sink her teeth into. Bill says then he will get it for her. Ridge tells Caroline tomorrow he will go to city hall and make everything legal. He knows she is going to be a wonderful mother. Ivy is not sure how much longer she will even be welcome at the Forrester estate. Wyatt says it does not matter. He meant it when he said they would regret what they have done. Ridge hopes Caroline does not feel left out with her family and friends not being at their wedding. She says no, all she needs is him. They kiss. Liam says his brother does not make idle threats so he does not know what he will do since Steffy is President of the company. Steffy says she does not trust Wyatt either so she may have to fire him too. Wyatt calls Bill and wants to meet with him. Nicole tells Thomas that he is good. He'd have to be being the son of Ridge Forrester. Thomas says some day he will be better. She says she knows, he has that look, the determination and confidence. Thomas looks at his I-phone and sees that Caroline has posted a picture. She is married to his dad. Ridge tells Caroline that his life was just fine until she came along and now he is humbled that she is his. She says he made it all happen, it was not a dream of hers. Liam tells Steffy that she looks different. She says yes because a weight has been lifted off her shoulder and now they can get on with their lives as they should have a long time ago. She considers this chapter closed. Wyatt invites Katie to stay too while he tells his dad that Ivy was unceremoniously dumped from Forrester. He asks if his position at FC is the same. He is still dirt there as long as Ridge is in control. Bill asks him to get to the point. Wyatt thinks Spencer Publication is where he belongs.......another industry that can be brought under SP. He wants to start another fashion house to compete with Liam and Steffy and take them down. Caroline and Ridge kiss as they undress each other and both think back on their meeting, guiding the hands in design and how magical it felt.",
