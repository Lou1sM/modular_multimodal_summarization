Liam seethed that Quinn had pushed Ivy to distract Liam and keep him from arriving at the Eiffel Tower to marry Hope.\n\n\nQuinn exclaimed that the video footage Wyatt had was so grainy no one could see it. Liam argued that it was Quinn. Wyatt asked his mother if she had been in Paris. Quinn lied that she had been there for a job interview. Wyatt doubted her.\n\n\nQuinn launched into a defense of her actions. She told Wyatt that she had been sorry to interfere, but she pointed out that Hope had chosen Wyatt. \"They're married, Liam. You need to respect that. And that is all that really matters,\" Quinn hissed.\n\n\n\"We'll see how much it matters when she finds out what you did,\" Liam replied. Liam reminded Quinn and Wyatt that Hope had married Wyatt because she'd thought that Liam had not shown up. Liam noted that Quinn had planned everything. Wyatt begged Liam not to tell Hope. Wyatt wanted to tell her himself, but Liam refused because he didn't trust Wyatt to tell Hope the truth. \"Wyatt, I would prepare yourself,\" Liam advised. Liam left.\n\n\nQuinn tried to hug Wyatt, but he pushed her away. Quinn justified her actions as \"a bad decision.\" Wyatt was furious with his mother, and he knew she was apologetic only because she had been caught. Quinn wailed that Hope loved Wyatt, but Wyatt told her to stop talking. He reminded her that he had told her never to interfere again. He questioned whether she had ever had therapy.\n\n\nWyatt lamented that he and Hope had just started their life together and had planned to have children. Quinn gleefully said she couldn't wait to be a grandmother, but Wyatt shouted that she was not grandmother material. Quinn said that she had anticipated becoming mellower as she headed into her golden years. Wyatt argued that no one would want anything to do with him or have children with him because of Quinn's \"crazy gene.\"\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke and Hope discussed that Wyatt wanted to start a family. Hope said that Wyatt would be an amazing father. \"But you imagined a life and a family with Liam,\" Brooke pointed out. Hope agreed. She said that she felt she was too young to start a family, and she admitted that Liam had been the love of her life. She noted that if Liam had shown up in Paris, she would be married to him. Brooke called it an inexplicable twist of fate. Hope emphatically agreed and said it was all a sign that she was supposed to be with Wyatt.\n\n\nTalk returned to a baby, and Brooke said that a baby would affect Hope's career and her plans to travel. Hope also admitted that she worried about Liam's reaction if she were to get pregnant right away because he had been devastated after her marriage.\n\n\nBrooke said she understood. Hope asked how she would know when it was the right time, and Brooke answered that it would be when Hope no longer had any more doubts. Brooke advised Hope to take it day by day and that it would all work out. Hope's phone rang. She answered, and Liam told her that he had to speak to her at his home. Hope hesitated then promised to meet him.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam remembered his first meeting with Hope, and he flashed back to many good times with Hope and the wedding in Italy. He also recalled when he had seen her after she had returned from her wedding to Wyatt.\n\n\nHope entered and said that she had always loved the house. \"I understand why you don't want to hand it over to Wyatt,\" Hope said. She insisted that she didn't want Liam to do anything he didn't want to do. Liam said that the house was not why he had called her. Liam said that Hope had married the wrong guy. Hope sighed.\n\n\nLiam reminded her that with all the weddings they had attempted, they had always been manipulated -- even by their fathers. He reminded her that they would be married if things had worked out in Paris. Hope maintained that they hadn't been manipulated in Paris. \"But we were. Ivy was pushed,\" Liam argued.\n\n\nHope asked who would do that, but Liam told her to think about who would do it. \"Quinn pushed Ivy into the Seine. This moment is going to change it back,\" Liam said. Hope looked confused.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Oliver and Aly chatted in his office. He teased that if she ever got tired of medieval nights, he wanted to go to wrestling matches. Aly wasn't keen on the idea of professional wrestling, but Oliver said he wanted to eat nachos and asked Aly to agree to one Saturday a month. They laughed.\n\n\nIvy interrupted. She shared that crazy Quinn Fuller had pushed her into the Seine. Ivy told Aly and Oliver the entire story of how Quinn had flown on the same flight as Liam and Ivy to Paris. She added that Quinn had pushed her without any regard for Ivy's safety. Ivy lamented that a boat could have run her over. \"I could have died,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nAly and Oliver sympathized. Ivy added that after Liam had found out, he'd left to tell Wyatt and Hope. Ivy said she knew that Liam hoped to get back together with Hope. Aly worried about Ivy's feelings.\n\n\nAly knew that Ivy had started to have feelings for Liam. Ivy agreed, but she said she wanted Liam to be happy. She wondered if Hope and Liam would get together. Aly reminded everyone that Hope hadn't cared that Liam had been in Paris, so she doubted that Hope would care that it had been Quinn's fault. Ivy disagreed. \n\n\n",

Hope makes a revealing confession to Brooke about her marriage to Wyatt and their future together. After viewing the irrefutable evidence against her, Quinn fesses up to Wyatt about being in Paris. With the truth about Quinn\u2019s involvement in the debacle in Paris out in the open, Wyatt and Liam race to reach Hope first.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam asks Wyatt what more proof does he need. It was his mother in Paris and she pushed Ivy into the Seine. Quinn denies it but Wyatt stops her and tells her to tell the truth. Hope tells Brooke that it wasn't that long ago that she and Liam were planning or talking about having children when they marry, but now she is married to Wyatt. And she loves Wyatt but she is too young and not thinking about having children right now. If Liam had showed up in Paris she would be married to him right now. What a coincidence that it was that exact time that Ivy fell in the water ad Liam rescued her. Maybe it is a sign that she is not supposed to be with Liam. Ivy interrupts Oliver and Aly and tells them she was right after all. She did not fall but was pushed by Quinn into the Seine. Wyatt has to drag it out of Quinn but she finally admits it was her, but it changes nothing. He is married to Hope now. Liam says see how much longer that lasts when Hope finds out the truth. He says he is not going to respect a marriage made out of deception. Quinn says Hope will not punish her husband for what she did. She says she thought she was doing everyone a favor. Liam starts to leave but Wyatt wants to tell Hope the truth. Liam says no, he doesn't trust him not to put his spin on it. They better prepare themselves. Hope is coming back to him. Wyatt won't let his mother touch him. Hope tells Brooke that she really does love Wyatt despite his crazy mother. She knows it hurt Liam when she married Wyatt so quickly, but if she got pregnant too so soon it would devastate him even more. She thinks she should wait a little longer. Liam calls and asks Hope to meet him at his house. He needs to talk to her. Quinn continues her harangue that nothing has to change. Hope loves Wyatt and chose him so not to start to doubt that now. He asked how many times has he told her not to interfere. She said this was too important. She will go to Hope and explain. He raves at her that she has done enough damage and he does not want her near Hope. No one would want to have a child with him now with her crazy twisted gene. She is not grandmother material. Liam tells Hope that she is married but to the wrong guy. She doesn't know where this is going. He explains how many times they tried to get married but were manipulated and now it just keeps on happening. She is stunned when he tells her that Ivy was pushed .who more than anyone else would want him from getting to Hope - Quinn. But this moment will change things back.",
