Wyatt pressured Bill and said that they would make with \"the best damned clothes anyone has ever seen.\" \"We could beat Forrester at its own game,\" Wyatt said, and Wyatt complimented Bill on his new haircut.\n\n\nBill countered that they shouldn't do something just because they were able. Wyatt maintained that he wanted to build something of his own. Katie said she understood. Wyatt complained that Forrester had been king of the hill for too long, and no one had challenged them. Wyatt promised that he could change that.\n\n\nKatie listened with interest, and Bill said that Wyatt wanted to compete with Liam, not Forrester. Wyatt defended himself and said they could create a new breed of fashion house. Katie agreed that they could maximize profits by keeping overhead low.\n\n\nKatie agreed it was an interesting idea. Wyatt excitedly said that he and Katie could run the new company. Bill wondered who would be the designer. Bill said Ivy could be the designer because she was out of a job at Forrester.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that the new company could be every bit as successful as Forrester Creations with him at the helm. \"I am a Spencer,\" Wyatt said with a chuckle. He promised to earn his leadership role at Spencer.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam and Steffy met with Quinn, Carter, and Pam in Steffy's office. Liam and Steffy announced that Ivy had been fired. Charlie called to notify them that Ivy was in the building, and Steffy said she would handle it. She left, and Quinn and Carter quizzed Liam about what had happened. Liam grew impatient and told them that Ivy had been fired because Steffy felt she could no longer trust Ivy. Carter and Quinn were surprised.\n\n\nAt the elevator, Charlie waited with Ivy until Steffy showed up. Ivy wanted to clean out her office, but Steffy refused. Steffy told Charlie to round up Ivy's belongings and send her on her way.\n\n\nIvy complained that she had designs and other belongings she wanted. Steffy countered that the designs were the property of Forrester. Charlie left to collect Ivy's belongings in her office.\n\n\nIvy said she couldn't believe that Steffy had fired her. Steffy said that Ivy had tried to blackmail her, and the pair rehashed everything that had happened. Steffy said she could neither work with nor trust Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy said that Ivy was vindictive just like Rick had been when he had been CEO. Ivy countered that Steffy had let power go to her head like Rick had, and Ivy accused her of being cruel and vindictive. Steffy suggested that Ivy return to Australia because she would never again be welcome at Forrester.\n\n\nCharlie entered with a box of Ivy's things, and Ivy left. Steffy returned to her office, and Pam looked disgusted. Pam said she felt sorry for Ivy. Steffy dismissed everyone and told Liam that they could all move on with Ivy gone.\n\n\nLiam was uncomfortable that Steffy had fired Ivy. Steffy lamented that Ivy didn't understand what she had done and how she had made Steffy live in fear. Steffy cried, and Liam embraced her. Steffy said she could never trust Ivy.\n\n\nLiam worried that Wyatt would be the vindictive one. Steffy reminded Liam that Wyatt had convinced Ivy to delete the video. She wasn't worried about him, but Liam maintained that he was worried. Steffy said that Wyatt needed to stay as far away from Ivy as possible.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Ivy entered with her box of stuff from Forrester, and Katie told her that Steffy had had no right to fire her. Wyatt teased that he hoped Ivy had packed her pencils. She looked confused, and Wyatt explained that she would need them in her new job. Ivy scoffed that Steffy seemed to be planning to blackball her from all of Los Angeles and had told her to return to Australia.\n\n\nBill and Katie explained that Wyatt had been trying to convince them to start a new company. Ivy was thrilled, but Bill told her he hadn't given his official approval and needed some time to think about it. Wyatt suggested Spencer Couture or Spencer Fashions as the name. They would work on a name. Bill and Katie left.\n\n\nIvy thanked Wyatt because it had been the worst day for her, but he had improved it with the idea that they could actually start their own business together. \"We can do this,\" Wyatt said. Ivy agreed, and they kissed. Wyatt said that Steffy and Liam had underestimated them. Wyatt looked determined.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt goes back and forth with a skeptical Bill that they could make a Spencer Fashion House work and beat Forrester at their own game. Even Katie leans toward this as something she could sink her teeth into. But it will not be easy since FC has been king of the hill for a very long time. Wyatt points out they have not had much competition so this is his chance with his dad's help. Bill is not so sure they should just because they can. Spencer has always been a communication company. Wyatt also points out FC has international stores; they will just be a fashion house and concentrate on that. Snarky Bill asks who will draw the pictures; they need a name talent. Wyatt thinks that is perfect since Ivy just lost her job. Bill wonders if he is doing this just because of his girlfriend. Wyatt says no and he knows it will be tough going head to head with Liam. Liam likes people to tell him what to do, but he and Ivy on the other hand do not. Wyatt feels he is a team player but has no place to move up in the company so yes he'd like to start his own team that is as successful as FC. Bill smiles and says he wants to be boss. Wyatt says he wants to earn it. Steffy is glad when Carter looks over the papers and says Ivy's contract can be terminated at any time. Quinn walks in and wonders why she was called away from a meeting. She's stunned when Steffy tells her she is now in charge as Ivy has been let go. Liam quickly explains it did not come out of the blue. Ivy did something and Steffy can no longer trust her. Pam warns them Charlie just said Ivy is in the building. Steffy goes to the elevator and tells Charlie to box up Ivy's belongings all by himself as she will stay with Ivy until she leaves. Liam explains that he can not tell Quinn what happened. It was not Ivy's work, but she let her emotions get the best of her and it took over her judgment. She's a brilliant designer though and he does not feel good about this. Ivy walks in Wyatt's house with her box of belongings and explains she can not go back into the building. Wyatt cheers her up by asking if she has all her pencils with her. She might need them in her next job. She is surprised when Wyatt tells her that he is trying to convince Bill into opening his own fashion house. He asks if Ivy is in. She points out he still works at FC. Steffy did not fire him. He says and there is a building with his name on it, so he can do what he wants and he thinks they can accomplish a lot great together. He told Steffy and Liam they would regret letting Ivy go, and he cannot wait until he sees their faces about this.",
