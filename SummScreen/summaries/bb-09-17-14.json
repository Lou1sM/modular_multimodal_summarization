Wyatt told her to get out. Quinn left. Wyatt recalled all his time alone with Hope and the leap of faith they had taken on their wedding day. He looked at his wedding ring.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam told Hope that Quinn had pushed Ivy into the Seine. Liam insisted that they could turn back the clock and start over. \"I'm right by your side at the Eiffel Tower,\" Liam said. Liam refused to allow Quinn to poison their lives. \"I missed you so damned much,\" Liam said. \n\n\nHope agreed she had missed Liam, and they discussed their failed relationship and weddings. They noted that that they had always emerged stronger. Hope pointed out that they'd had their chances, and she loved the memories, but she was married.\n\n\nHope reminded Liam that their life hadn't worked out the way they'd planned. She added that she knew how hurt Liam had been, but she was disappointed that he had tried to blame Quinn for something that had happened to Ivy. Hope insisted that what had happened in Paris had had nothing to do with Quinn, although she knew that Quinn had been an easy target. \"She was in Los Angeles,\" Hope said.\n\n\nLiam told Hope he had proof that Quinn had been in Paris. He had proof that Pam and Charlie had provided, and Hope was in disbelief that Liam or anyone would believe evidence from Pam. Liam showed Hope the scan from Customs, airline records that proved Quinn had been on Liam's flight, and security footage of Quinn stealing a scooter and following Liam's car before she had pushed Ivy off the bridge.\n\n\nHope refused to believe it, but she said she saw a resemblance. Liam said Quinn had tried to disguise herself, but he had already confronted Quinn, and she had admitted it. \"Quinn put Ivy's life at risk to keep us apart,\" Liam said. Hope was shocked. \"I can't even wrap my brain around this right now,\" Hope said. Hope and Liam discussed that they would have been married, but Hope continued to lament that Liam hadn't been at the Eiffel Tower at 3 p.m. \"The moment was full of disappointment and embarrassment,\" Hope said.\n\n\nLiam said it had all been part of Quinn's plan. Hope said she had to talk to Wyatt, but Liam shared that he had already told Wyatt. They continued to discuss that Hope had chosen Liam, but Quinn had chosen Wyatt for Hope. Hope lamented that she'd had to deal with thinking Liam had left her at the Eiffel Tower when he'd actually been there, and she tearfully acknowledged that Quinn had engineered everything. \n\n\nHope received a text message from Wyatt asking her to return home. \"I have to go talk to Wyatt and Quinn,\" Hope said. She and Liam hugged, and Liam said it wasn't too late for them.\n\n\nIn Bill's office at Forrester, Quinn barged in. \"Our little Ivy falling into the Seine secret is no longer a secret,\" she announced. She worried that everyone had discovered what she had done. Bill had no sympathy. Quinn demanded that Bill help Wyatt save his marriage. Bill refused. He ordered Quinn to stay away from Liam, Hope, and Wyatt because they had to settle everything on their own.\n\n\nBill advised Quinn to stop making mistakes. She predicted that Bill didn't want Hope with Liam, but Bill didn't want to get involved. Quinn accused Bill of meddling before, and Bill agreed, but he said Hope had to decide what to do. Quinn shouted that Hope wouldn't leave Wyatt because the facts remained the same: Liam hadn't met Hope on time, and it didn't matter how it had happened. Quinn insisted that Hope and Wyatt were happy. She wanted Bill to convince Liam to respect that. Quinn left.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Bill entered and asked how Liam was. Liam said that Hope had a choice to make. Liam assumed that Bill had arrived to persuade Liam to move forward and leave Hope and Wyatt alone. Bill agreed that was what Quinn had wanted. Liam admitted that he expected Hope to leave Wyatt, but Bill didn't seem convinced that would happen. Bill wondered what Hope would do.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's Quinn returned, and Wyatt told her to get out because Hope was on her way home. Quinn refused and promised to apologize to Hope. Quinn launched into her analysis of Hope and Liam's relationship and many failed marriages. Quinn promised that Hope would never leave Wyatt. Quinn defended her actions because she had helped Hope see what was best for her. Wyatt insisted that Quinn had to leave, but it was too late.\n\n\nHope entered, and Quinn immediately started to apologize. \"Don't! Stop talking,\" Hope seethed. Hope added that Quinn had claimed she had been in therapy and getting help. \"You're just as sick as you ever were,\" Hope said.\n\n\nHope accused Quinn of risking Ivy's life just to keep Liam and Hope apart. Quinn insisted that Ivy had never been in any real danger. Hope said that Quinn had no idea what could have gone wrong. Hope accused Quinn of never caring about her son and not having a moral bone in her body, \"This is who you are,\" Hope said.\n\n\nQuinn rolled her eyes and looked defiant, and Hope continued to name all the people Quinn had hurt: Ridge, Ivy, Liam. \"Your own son is just as much a victim as the rest of us. What you have done -- it is disgusting and unforgivable. I just hope to God that Wyatt hates you as much as I do,\" Hope said.\n\n\n",

Wyatt worries that Quinn\u2019s continued meddling may have forever cost him the one thing that is most important in his life: Hope. Quinn turns to an unlikely source for comfort and advice following her fall-out with Wyatt.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope is stunned and speechless when Liam tells her that Quinn pushed Ivy. He knows it does not make sense but Quinn was controlling things and he refuses to give her that power. They can get back their life. They do not have to let her poison them anymore. They do not have to give up. He's missed her so much. She says she misses him too and she does not regret anything even when things went wrong. He opines that Quinn can not keep them apart. She says she never gave up until she had to. Her life did not turn out the way she planned but she still has those memories. She says she knows he is trying to fix things but it's not right to blame it all on Quinn. Hope reminds him that she is married to Wyatt now. Liam's not showing up is not just on Quinn. He tells her to look into his eyes. He has proof. He tells her Ivy was sitting on the edge of the railing taking a picture. He debunks what Quinn said that she had a job interview in Paris. He shows her the scan of her passport and video of Quinn pushing Ivy in the river. Quinn put Ivy's life in danger to keep them apart. Quinn shows up at Bill's and says they have a problem. He says there is no we, so leave him out of any of her problems. He pours her a stiff drink while she asks for his help in telling Hope. He says Hope ought to come to that conclusion on her own. She wants him to go to Liam and tell him this does not change anything. Bill tells Quinn that he told Liam he would stop meddling so he is going to keep that promise. She says Wyatt is her whole world. He says if she doesn't want him to suffer then stop making his decisions for him. Hope makes Liam miserable and he's moving on. All these kids are finally making progress. It doesn't matter how Ivy fell. Liam did not show and Wyatt did and they all need to respect that. Hope can not wrap her brain around this right now, but she admits it does change her life. Liam says she chose him already and Quinn knew she chose him. She says she knows all of that but at 3 o'clock he did not show and Wyatt was there. She wants to know if Wyatt knows. He says he does now. He keeps repeating that Hope chose him. She gets a fax from Wyatt wanting her to come home. Liam tells her Wyatt will understand that they were robbed once again. He hugs her. She says she has to go and talk to Wyatt. Liam drags out a box of memories; Bill walks in. He says he is irritated that Quinn interfered again. Liam guesses that Quinn came to him to get Liam not to interfere in the marriage. He says this changes things between him and Hope. She was shocked. But he is not going to let Quinn come between them ever again. Bill reminds them they are married. Quinn walks in on Wyatt and he tells her to turn around and go home. She has done enough damage. She says Hope had her chance with Liam and never could make it work. With Wyatt it was easy. Quinn admits that she went to Bill and asked for his support. He can talk to Liam and get him to back off. Wyatt says that does not matter. It's up to Hope, not up to Bill or Liam. Why would she think he would want a woman because of Quinn's manipulations. He asks her to leave, he needs to talk to his wife and she is on her way. Too late, Hope walks in. Quinn starts explaining. Hope tells her to close her mouth. She is just as sick as she always was. All she cared about was keeping Liam away from Hope in Paris. Everyone was wrong to think that they could believe she would grow a moral bone in her body. Now she has hurt a lot of people and worst of all, her own son is a victim. She hopes he hates her as much as Hope does now.",
