    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's old office, Rick and Maya asked Quinn if she'd heard from Ivy. Quinn claimed to be giving Ivy space and asked what was on Rick's tie. Glancing at the stain, Rick said it was a lunch accident. He remarked that people had thought he was bad, but he hadn't fired a Forrester. Maya said she had to be fair because she'd heard that it had been all Steffy, not Ridge. Quinn said Steffy was a brutal as Rick.\n\n\nLater, Rick was working at the desk when Maya returned with a new shirt for him. He took off his jacket, revealing even bigger stains than Quinn had seen on just his tie. He chuckled, saying that at least it hadn't been coffee. Maya was not smiling. She was upset about the \"so cool, so trendy\" food truck.\n\n\nMaya asked why Rick hadn't let her call the police. Rick asked if she'd wanted the incident in the news. She asked if it would be their life. He said it wouldn't be a life of juveniles throwing beer and food at them. She asked where people got off calling him the names that she'd been called as a child.\n\n\nRick asserted that the same people who didn't think Maya was a real girl didn't think he was a real man. Maya hated that she'd put that in Rick's life. He said a little ketchup and a few lobster rolls didn't faze him. Maya didn't see the good in people championing her and making Rick a target.\n\n\nRick said people didn't know what to make of him; however, they'd read Maya's trials and felt she deserved respect. \"But not love,\" she added. Rick recalled that he'd freaked out himself about what people would think of him, and it had almost broken them up. He said he'd never let it happen again.\n\n\nRick stated that their trials with Bill had taught Rick not to be ashamed. Rick said that Julius probably experienced the same things they had that day. Maya was sure Julius blamed her for it, too.\n\n\nRick said that not being man enough in Julius' generation led to its own special kind of hell. Maya thought perhaps she should understand and forgive more. She claimed she would if Julius weren't her father. Rick stated that even though Maya hadn't had a protector as a child, she had one \"now.\"\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Steffy tried to draft a press release to explain Ivy's departure to \"pursue other adventures.\" Liam said it sounded fake. She typed that Ivy was going to Australia, but he said they didn't know if Ivy was leaving the city. Steffy decided to forget it and stay mum because a Forrester leaving Forrester would look like a family squabble no matter how they dealt with it.\n\n\nBill strode in, asking how it was hanging for the fruit of his loins. Katie entered, apologizing that Bill had forgotten to knock. Liam asked Bill if he minded. Bill asked if Liam expected Bill to have Liam's \"looney tune\" receptionist announce him. Liam quipped that it would be nice if Bill called Liam's \"looney tune\" receptionist in advance to see if Liam was available.\n\n\nBill countered by asking how many times Liam had made an appointment before entering Bill's top-floor office of the building Bill owned. Liam replied that they'd been working together; however, Bill asked if Liam representing Spencer at Forrester meant they were not working together. Liam said not to pull the twelve-and-a-half percent thing and insisted he didn't need Bill looking over his shoulder.\n\n\nKatie said the visit had gotten off on the wrong foot. Liam asked if it was really a visit or if it was a follow-up to a complaint from Wyatt. Steffy asserted that she'd fired Ivy, and Liam hadn't had anything to do with it. Bill asked if they really thought he was there to tell them not to be mean to Wyatt's girlfriend. Steffy replied that the point was that Wyatt needed to mind his own business.\n\n\n\"Which is here, yes?\" Bill asked. Steffy agreed, but added, \"Down the hall.\" Irritated, she said she got that Wyatt had opinions and ideas about everything. Bill asked if employees with vision were bad things. Steffy replied that Wyatt worked there, but his job wasn't to run the company.\n\n\nBill believed that he was within his rights to inquire about major changes that Forrester had made in the design team. Steffy stated that it was Bill's mission, every time he walked in, to let them know what he was entitled to, but it was a private matter. Katie asked if Steffy was disputing Bill's right to even walk through the door. Bill said it was fine; he'd just ask Ridge about the firing.\n\n\nSteffy claimed that Ridge was \"out,\" and Bill gleaned that Ridge didn't even know about the firing. Steffy said she had the authority to make staffing decisions. Liam asked when Bill had become Ivy's fan. \"When did your choke collar get so tight that you can spit on the woman you married not so long ago?\" Bill asked. Liam responded in shock, but Katie said Liam deserved it.\n\n\nSteffy concluded that Ivy was out and hadn't been a team player. \"I wonder why,\" Katie quipped. Steffy refused to justify herself to Katie and said that if Liam had an objection, then she and Liam would talk about it. She further decreed that if Bill had questions, he'd set up a meeting with Liam at their mutual convenience. Deciding to add more, Liam told Bill to stop micromanaging and to let Liam do the job Bill wanted him there to do.\n\n\nBill thought his son had an interesting way of showing gratitude and wondered if Liam wanted to return to making house calls on sick computers. Liam asked Bill not to go there and said Bill knew Liam was grateful. Katie figured that when Bill had put Liam into his position at Forrester, Bill had believed Liam would exercise independent judgment.\n\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Liam said and claimed that he and Steffy disagreed all the time. Katie wasn't so sure of that -- or if she recognized the person before her. \"When did you become her yes man?\" Katie asked. Steffy asked if Bill would let Katie insult his son like that. \"Anything you want to add, Katie?\" Bill asked. Katie said she was good, and the couple marched out.\n\n\nLiam asked if he'd deserved what had happened. Steffy asked when Liam ever expected fairness from Bill. Liam stated that Katie usually had his back. Steffy said the pair didn't know the whole story about Ivy. Liam didn't understand why Wyatt had even run to Bill and stated that Bill didn't even like Ivy.\n\n\nLiam asked if they should give Wyatt a title. Steffy didn't even know what Wyatt's title was. Liam didn't want Wyatt to feel as if \"crazy Quinn\" was rising while Wyatt was being punished. Doubting it would ameliorate Ivy's firing, Steffy said Liam was a sucker for Wyatt's passive aggressiveness.\n\n\nSteffy thought Liam needed to realize he'd done nothing wrong. Liam believed he had enough flashes of clarity to know it wasn't so, but he was learning to adjust his expectations of himself. He wondered how bad he could be if Steffy still loved him.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt was preoccupied with figuring out how to get Bill to invest in the new design house. Ivy said Wyatt made her feel very cared for, but they had to be careful not to jeopardize his job at Forrester. Scoffing, he asked why. She didn't think Bill was convinced about Spencer Designs.\n\n\nWyatt said that Liam lived in fear, but Bill and Wyatt lived on the edge. Wyatt believed that Spencer Designs was just the risk Bill needed and lived for. Ivy asked if Bill would be betting against himself because of his Forrester shares. Wyatt believed the Forresters would love to buy Bill out, which would actually be good seed money for the new business.\n\n\nWyatt received a call from Quinn, who thought he'd be proud of her for giving him space. He guessed she'd heard about the firing. Quinn asked what had happened. He claimed he couldn't talk because he was with Ivy. Quinn said opportunity was knocking. He replied that it could walk right in.\n\n\nAfter the call, Ivy guessed that Quinn thought the firing put her one step closer to world domination and asked if Wyatt would pitch the new company idea to her. Wyatt didn't know that Bill could stand for it, and Wyatt said Deacon would be sexually harassing the female employees. Ivy felt that Quinn had a fan base, and no one could handle her like Wyatt.\n\n\nA knock pounded on the door. Wyatt let Katie in. She said that Bill might be more amenable to Wyatt's ideas, but at the moment, Bill was in the car, pounding his head against the steering wheel. Wyatt called Bill to get him to enter the house, but Bill hung up.\n\n\nKatie said she and Bill had gone to check the climate at Forrester before thinking about Wyatt's offer, and their encounter with Liam and Steffy hadn't been pretty. Katie said Bill no longer believed that Steffy walked on water, and Liam had been a complete jerk.\n\n\nBill finally entered. He had a headache but thought it would be childish of him to disinherit anyone. Wyatt launched into a rant about why Liam had a bigger beach house. Bill murmured that Liam had found him first. Wyatt asked why Liam got an executive job at Spencer and Forrester, but Bill hadn't offered Wyatt anything. Bill said Wyatt hadn't asked.\n\n\nBill asked what Wyatt wanted from him, and Wyatt said he was offering to make Bill a fortune with a fashion house under Bill's banner. Bill asked what his son knew about running a legitimate business. Wyatt said he'd done it with Quinn's business since he'd been fifteen. Bill asked what it would take to go into production. Wyatt said it would be eleven million -- or three and a half million if they had to postpone production because Bill had no faith in Wyatt.\n\n\nBill questioned why he should trust Wyatt with that sum of money, and Wyatt said Bill could trust the accountants. \"Let's suppose I don't believe you can design anything -- because I don't. How would you respond?\" Bill asked Ivy. Wyatt told Ivy not to respond and said that Bill would think Ivy could design because Bill would be trusting Wyatt and Katie's judgment.\n\n\nBill noted that Katie hadn't said a peep, but Wyatt stated that she wanted in. Bill admitted that he didn't like Wyatt's \"you owe me this, Dad\" attitude. Wyatt claimed it wasn't about that, and there was something in it for Bill, who'd no longer have to play nice with Ridge or put up the Liam's indignant responses whenever Bill asked questions.\n\n\nWyatt urged Bill to back him, and Wyatt said he'd prove that he was more Spencer than Liam. Wyatt outstretched his hand and asked if they had a deal.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "As Wyatt and Ivy design, he tells her that he doesn't get it. Bill has half a dozen fashion magazines, so it would not hurt for him to do this fashion house for him and for Ivy. His dad lives on the edge just as he does, not like Liam who lives in fear. Liam and Steffy have their heads together as to how to announce Ivy leaving without calling attention to it. Bill walks in and Liam chastises him for just barging in. Liam says he does not need him looking over his shoulder. Steffy assures Bill that Liam had nothing to do with Ivy leaving. It was all her decision. Quinn tells Rick that Steffy is as brutal as he was as CEO. This had nothing to do with Ridge, it was all Steffy. Quinn calls Wyatt and says she has given him space but she heard there was a big scene about Ivy and it feels like opportunity might be knocking for them. Steffy tells Bill this is a private matter and his 12 \u00bd% does not give him rights to walk in here and throw his weight around. Liam says he does not like the fact that Bill is trying to micromanage him. Bill fires back that Steffy sure has a choke hold on him. Katie even says she does not recognize Liam anymore as he is just a yes man to Steffy. Liam tells Steffy later that Katie usually has his back even if his dad doesn't. Maya feels responsible for what happened to Rick when teenagers threw food and drink on him. They called him names they used to call Maya. She says she is used to rudeness and curiosity but he should not have to. He should not have to swallow the consequences that she made. Now he knows what Julius probably had to go through. People of his generation were judged by being the kind of man you were. But a parent should always be there to fight for their child. He says people have tried to break them up but that will never happen again. Katie comes by Wyatt's and says Bill is still dragging his feet. He wanted to see how things are going at FC, but he would not come with her now. However within minutes he is there and said he had been acting childish. Wyatt tells him that he wants to make Bill a fortune so just back him with a fashion house. Liam has a bigger beach house than he and has a job at both FC and Spencer so Wyatt should have this. Liam tells Steffy that Wyatt gets so resentful about him that he wishes they could give him a title. Steffy says Liam has done nothing wrong. Bill asks Wyatt just what does he know about running a company and why should he trust him with that kind of money. And he does not know that Ivy can design. Wyatt says to back him, trust him that he knows Ivy and even Katie wants to be in on this. Bill has no more questions. Wyatt does \u0096 is he in?",
