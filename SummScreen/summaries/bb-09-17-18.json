    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Bill that he cannot kiss her like that. He is stunned but promises it will not happen again. She says good; she is a married woman and intends to stay that way. He says he is feeling so many things but he cannot say them out loud. Eric sits and hears the details of the cut-off-at-the-knees Hope For The Future. He just wants to find out if Thorne still has a job. Ridge quips he will be helping Quinn but she laughs and says no. Ridge finally says yes he will still be designing for HFTF. Katie is shocked. She and Thorne have not even dated. He says who needs that. He never thought he would have another chance but he wants her to marry him. She says she admits she has thought about a future with him, but she knows how he feels about Bill so he does not have to do this to get her out of this predicament. He says he must have lost his touch. He thinks they are a good fit and he is not doing this because of the custody with Bill. He loves her. She says nothing is an open and shut case with Bill so do not count on that. There has been water under the bridge with Brooke and sometimes that bridge cannot be crossed again. She kisses him and he slips the ring on her finger and says she must have said yes. Bill tells Brooke that he understands something now that he did not before. He is not talking to Liam, barely tolerated by Wyatt working side by side with him and now Will wants nothing to do with him. He cannot live like that. He destroyed Liam's marriage and now he is paying the price for that. She says she knows he loves Will and needs to be in his life. He needs to keep trying and she will with Katie. Ridge feels like he needs to get Thorne on the phone and see if he is still in with his designing. Ridge reaches Thorne and he is in bed with Katie. Eric asks if he caught him in the middle of anything. Thorne goes well, he just asked Katie to marry him. They are all surprised but thrilled. Eric says they will see him tomorrow and fill him in on the line. Bill tells Justin that he is not giving any more. He has given all he can on the divorce so he and Brooke are going to keep working on Katie. Thorne and Katie discuss where they might live so not to take Will away from home and his school. She says she always wanted to marry Prince Charming .someone who knows right from wrong, who treats everyone the same no matter who they are and someone who she can trust. Brooke and Ridge get into it again about Bill and she says Will does not need protection from his father. Ridge grouses that Bill has done many bad things to everyone he knows including himself by throwing him out of a helicopter and leaving him there in the water to die. Brooke is not doing Katie any favors by talking to her. Stay away from that guy and; stop defending him!",
