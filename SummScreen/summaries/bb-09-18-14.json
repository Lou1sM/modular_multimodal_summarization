    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach house, Quinn wanted to know what she could do to fix things. Hope was floored that Quinn would even think fixing things was possible. Wyatt asked to speak to Hope alone, but Quinn stated that Hope had hardly noticed that he was in the room. \"Can't be a good sign,\" Quinn added. Wyatt became indignant at the response, but Quinn ignored him, focusing on Hope.\n\n\nQuinn remarked that it had to be pleasant for Hope to have everyone agree with her. Wyatt bit out that Quinn wasn't helping matters. Quinn asked if Hope wanted an apology. \"I'm sorry you married my son instead of his loser half-brother,\" Quinn asserted. Hope declared that she didn't want Quinn to talk about Liam that way, and Hope told Wyatt that she didn't want him allowing it from Quinn, either.\n\n\nHope argued that Quinn's apologies were meaningless because Quinn only said what she thought people wanted to hear. \"You tell people that you checked into therapy, that you're getting help,\" Hope said, mimicking Quinn in a sing-song tone. Hope questioned whether there had ever been a doctor and if Wyatt had actually spoken with a doctor or seen a therapy bill.\n\n\nShrugging, Wyatt said he'd talked to someone. \"I think she was a doctor, yeah,\" he dubiously responded. Hope shrieked, asking Wyatt how he could be so gullible. Wyatt got upset and yelled back, \"So what if I am?\" He argued that people were trained from youth to believe in their parents.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Hope would be okay with Liam's plane crashing or Ivy being hit by a crazy Parisian driver. Hope said she had no idea what Quinn was asking. Quinn asked if it would be okay if chance had intervened instead of her. Quinn believed Hope's problem was Quinn, not the marriage to Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt asked Quinn to leave, but Quinn questioned if Hope had married Wyatt because of Quinn or despite Quinn. Hope felt no need to justify herself to Quinn. Quinn wondered if Hope would be standing around, bitterly blaming the weather if it had delayed Liam instead of Quinn.\n\n\nHope stated that she had planned on getting married in Paris, just not to Wyatt. \"Wow,\" Wyatt murmured. Quinn asked if Hope had wondered, \"Gee, who else could I marry instead,\" when Liam hadn't showed up. Hope stated that she'd married Wyatt because she loved him, \"but if I had known -- \" Quinn cut in, saying that Hope hadn't wanted to know that Liam had been on his way.\n\n\nQuinn asked why Hope hadn't thought Liam had been late because of a flight delay, traffic, tuberculosis, or the flu. Hope declared that Liam would have called under such circumstances, and Quinn asked if Hope had waited to hear from him. \"No. No, you didn't. You just turned on a dime and married my son. So it doesn't matter if it was a flight delay, bad traffic, tuberculosis, or the flu. Liam would have been out of luck either way,\" Quinn concluded.\n\n\nHope decided it was time for Quinn to leave. Quinn asked Hope to remember that she'd accepted Wyatt's proposal because she'd wanted to, and Quinn hadn't had a hand in it. Hope was done listening to Quinn's rationalizations, but Quinn retorted that she'd patiently listened to Hope's.\n\n\nQuinn figured Hope had wanted an excuse to marry her fianc\u00e9's brother and to blame Liam after she hadn't given him the slightest bit of leeway in showing up. Quinn continued, saying Hope had also blamed bad luck for Ivy's fall. Hope hadn't lifted a finger to undo the marriage, but upon learning of Quinn's involvement, Hope was suddenly \"required to be outraged.\"\n\n\nQuinn snickered that Hope had gotten caught doing the right thing for the wrong reasons, which wouldn't do for the Hope-for-the-ever-changing-future. Hope said she could cry to think of Wyatt growing up with Quinn. Quinn replied that they'd done all right, and she'd accepted her lot in life -- to be the screen that others projected their issues onto.\n\n\nAs Quinn left, Hope declared that she'd never let Quinn near Wyatt again. Shrugging, Quinn said that life was long, and one never knew what would happen. Quinn closed the door behind herself.\n\n\nAlone with Hope, Wyatt said he'd see Quinn at Christmas, and that would be about all. He asked if Hope understood that he couldn't keep Quinn from the front door. He asked if Hope was going to speak. She said she would, and he told her to start by telling him where they stood.\n\n\nWyatt asked if he and Hope were still married. Hope cringed at the thought of calling Quinn \"mother\" and her children calling Quinn \"grandma.\" Wyatt said he'd forbid Quinn to see them, but Hope reminded him that he'd said he couldn't keep Quinn away from the door. Wyatt proposed to have Quinn committed. Hope didn't know if that would be enough.\n\n\nWyatt asked Hope to turn the clock back to the day before. He wondered what had changed. He said Quinn hadn't been there for their leap of faith. He asked Hope not to make it about Quinn because Hope had wanted a life with him the day prior. He believed that they could still have it. \"Can we?\" he asked.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam was tense as he waited for Hope to return. Bill relaxed on the sofa, asking if Hope had said she'd be back. Liam asked why she wouldn't return and if Bill wanted Hope to remain with Wyatt. Bill claimed to be expressing concern for his son who was in denial.\n\n\nLiam expressed that he and Hope had fallen victim to another deception, but Bill pointed out that Hope was married that time. Liam contended that Hope could get out of the marriage. \"You just don't think she will,\" Liam surmised. Bill admitted that his faith in Hope was questionable. Liam replied that it wasn't a question of his father's faith in Hope but of his father's faith in him.\n\n\nBill asked if he and Liam were having a problem. Liam dismissed it, saying he'd live with it, but Bill persisted in knowing what Liam meant. Liam said he'd live with knowing he'd never be the son Bill wanted Liam to be. \"What are you talking about?\" Bill exclaimed.\n\n\nLiam claimed not to be the only one who saw it, and he asked if Bill knew how many people had told Liam that Wyatt was so much more like their father. Bill concluded that Liam cared too much about what people thought. Bill reasoned that people saw him and Wyatt as \"charming-slash-obnoxious,\" depending upon the time of day; however, no one thought Liam was obnoxious.\n\n\nLiam said he didn't want to be Wyatt or Bill, but Liam knew that Bill would always bet on Wyatt. Bill decided that it was about \"who does Daddy loves more,\" and he asked if Liam wanted to see Bill's will. Liam wasn't interested in the will, but he felt that Bill would always think that Wyatt would win for the same reasons Bill thought that Bill would win.\n\n\nBill questioned what he'd done since his arrival to make Liam feel that way. Liam answered that Bill seemed to support Hope and Wyatt's marriage, just like Quinn. Bill asked when he'd ever done her bidding. In another example of Bill's missing support, Liam stated that Bill had shown up to the cliff house to kick Liam out and give the place to Wyatt. \"If I wanted you out, you'd be out!\" Bill bellowed.\n\n\nIn a quieter voice, Bill discerned that if Hope had an ounce of sense -- \"and that's the thing that I always question -- there's no way she's going to stay with Wyatt this time.\" Bill felt for Wyatt, who'd take another hit due to his crazy mother. Liam stated that Wyatt wasn't innocent, but Bill countered that Hope wasn't, either. Liam frowned, and Bill insisted that he and Liam at least agree upon that.\n\n\nLiam said he should have gone to Paris with Hope when she'd asked. Bill told Liam to forget that because it would have worked out fine had it not been for Quinn. Liam questioned whether Quinn had been at a clinic. Bill quipped that a person could take a pill for crazy; however, Quinn was evil, and from birth, she'd wanted to wreck the world and everything in it.\n\n\nBill said that if he seemed to favor Wyatt, it was because Wyatt had been raised by the she-devil and only knew what she'd taught him. Liam, in Bill's view, had his act together, but Wyatt needed Bill's attention. \"Besides all that, your mother, I loved her,\" Bill softly uttered. Liam grew emotional when his mother sprang to mind, and he nodded.\n\n\nBill understood Liam's feelings, but Bill believed that it would be different that time if Hope was solid and if Liam could depend upon her. Liam was sure he could. Bill stated that winners could afford to be generous, and he advised Liam to be generous.\n\n\nLater, Liam heard someone enter his house and assumed it was Hope. He grimaced upon seeing Quinn, who tossed him a set of keys she'd forgotten to return to him. He replied that he'd never given her keys, and she shrugged, guessing that they were Bill's keys. Quinn attempted to apologize for her lapse of judgment, but she burst out laughing in the middle of it.\n\n\nLiam stated that he was about to hide his knives, and Quinn claimed that it was an offensive thing to say to someone who'd fought her way through therapy. Liam found it offensive to get chased with a sword by a nutcase who probably never went to therapy at all. Liam informed Quinn that the statute of limitations hadn't run out on her attempting to murder him, and he had video footage of the other murder Quinn had attempted in Paris.\n\n\nQuinn asked Liam to extradite her because the jail food was probably better over there. Liam began to count to ten, which was all the time he'd allotted her to leave. Quinn sat down and said Hope would take responsibility for marrying Wyatt. Liam stopped counting. Quinn said she, Hope, and Wyatt had reached an understanding, and Hope took her commitments seriously.\n\n\nQuinn wanted Liam to invite Ivy to the house so that Quinn could apologize. With a coy smile, Quinn said that he and Ivy had been a cute couple in Paris. Liam was appalled that Quinn was trying to be a matchmaker. He declared that she was done and that the marriage she'd staged was done, too. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Bill is begrudgingly forced to choose sides between his sons on the situation regarding Hope when Liam calls him out on favoring Wyatt. Quinn relentlessly apologizes to an unwavering Hope for manipulating her into marrying Wyatt. Hope is put on the spot when Quinn asks her whether or not she would question her marriage to Wyatt if the circumstances surrounding Liam\u2019s absence in Paris were any different.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn says she hears Hope loud and clear. So what can she do to help. She asks Hope if she needs an apology. Wyatt tells his mom he wants to talk to Hope alone. Quinn tells him that Hope barely knows he's in the room and that is not a good sign. Hope says an apology would mean nothing. She opines that Quinn never means anything she says. She accuses Quinn of not ever being in therapy at all. And she even charges Wyatt for being so gullible to believe his mom after all these years. Wyatt says again there is a part of this conversation that does not concern Quinn so she needs to leave. Quinn goes on if Liam was detained, would Hope still be married to Wyatt and blaming the weather or whatever. Hope says no, she married Wyatt because she loved him. Quinn said she just turned on a dime and did not even wait on a phone call from Liam, she walked off with Wyatt and married him. It did not matter why Liam was late .by chance it could have been an accident, the weather, tuberculosis or the flu. Hope did not want to know at that moment. It was enough that he did not show. Hope says Quinn needs to go. Quinn says Hope needed an excuse, like one of Liam not showing up. Liam lashes out at Bill that it seems like the same old same old to him. Wyatt will be just fine so he's worried about Liam. Liam says this is not the first time that Hope has been tricked into cutting him out. Bill says Liam is in denial. This time Hope is married. That is a legal fact that Hope can not ignore even if Liam can. Liam says she can always undo the marriage, but, Bill just doesn't think she will. Bill says yes he has had trouble having faith in that girl. Liam says it is not Hope he has no faith in, he has no faith in Liam. Bill opines that people see him and Wyatt as more alike as they are charming/obnoxious and no one ever thinks Liam is obnoxious so that is a good thing. Liam admits that he does not want to be Bill nor Wyatt but he just knows that Bill's money will always be on Wyatt. Bill says okay, now he sees what this is all about - who does Daddy love more. Liam says he is not losing sleep over this, so he doesn't have to see his will. But Bill thinks Wyatt will always win out in the end for the same reason that Bill always wins in the end. Bill says if Hope has a tiny bit of sense, and that is the part he will always question, there is no way she will stay with Wyatt this time. He says Quinn is evil through and through and has been since the day she was born. So if it seems that Bill favors Wyatt, then ask himself why. It's because he was raised by that she-devil. All he knows is what she taught. Liam has his act together but Wyatt needs his attention. And Liam's mother.....Bill says he loved her. And it's understandable with his reflex. Liam has been down this road of happily ever after so many times and had the rug pulled from under him. But this time it's gonna be different. Hope is solid and Liam can count on her. He has one piece of advice for Liam. Winners can afford to be generous, so be generous. Quinn says she will go but she reminds Hope that she married her son and she had nothing to do with that at all. She did it because she wanted to. Hope says she does not have to justify her actions to Quinn. Quinn says no, she wanted to marry the brother of her fiance and didn't give Liam the slightest chance of being late. But now she finds out Quinn's hand was in it and she has to be outraged. She is in a pickle. She got caught doing the right thing for the wrong reason. No that won't do, not for the Hope forever-changing Hope future. Hope says she feels so sorry for Wyatt how he must have grown up. She will never let Wyatt near her again. Quinn says that life is long so you never know what is gonna happen. And as for Wyatt, he did all right and she has accepted her lot in life. She says she was born to be the screen for other people to project their images on. When they are alone, Wyatt says he will see Quinn maybe only at Christmas. But Hope has to know he can not keep Quinn away from the door. She is silent. He says she will talk to Quinn but not talk to him. Hope says she will talk to him, she is just trying to drink all of this in. He asks her where do they stand. Quinn walks into Liam's house and throws him the keys and says she forgot to return them. He says he is hiding his kitchen knives. She finds that offensive to someone who has fought her way back from mental illness through therapy. He says no worse than being chased around with a sword by a nut case who probably never went to therapy in the first place. And by the way the statue of limitations has not run out on attempted murder and he has eye witnesses. She laughs then extradite her for the Paris thing. She is sure the food is better over there in their jails. She tells him that she just came from Hope's and she is going to take responsibility for her actions. He tells her that she can not matchmake him with Ivy. And he is sorry but so is the marriage that she crossed the Atlantic to manage. Wyatt asks Hope if she is still his wife. She is amazed that he can still call her mother or that her kids would call her Grandma. Wyatt says he will forbid her from seeing them. He even says he will have her committed. He can call tomorrow. She's not sure that is enough. He asks if she can do him a favor. Just turn back the clock one day, same time but just one day. Nothing has changed except they have a little more information now.....his mother is a little more unstable than they thought. Quinn was not there when Hope told him she loved him or when he proposed to her. Or when they said their vows and took the leap of faith. That was all about them, so do not make this about her. It's about them for better or worse. This is the life she wanted yesterday and they still can have.",
