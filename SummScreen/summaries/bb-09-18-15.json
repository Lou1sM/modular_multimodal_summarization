    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the cliff house, Steffy and Liam sat down with beers. Liam was concerned about how things had gone with his father and Katie, and he wasn't sure if his father still had faith in him. He asked if he'd been too harsh with his father. Steffy said Bill might be pouting at that moment; however, he respected that Liam had stood his ground about being micromanaged, and he trusted Liam with the shares.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy went to the kitchen to cook in their work clothes. Liam remarked that Bill hadn't noticed Ivy the whole time Liam had dated her but had suddenly become worried about her. Steffy asserted that Bill was just concerned that she'd fired Ivy without a shareholder's meeting. Steffy said it was \"totally her call\" as president, and if she wanted to fire someone, it was her right to do it.\n\n\nLiam didn't think anyone was disputing it. \"Except Katie and Bill,\" Steffy murmured. Liam said the two didn't have the whole story, and Bill wouldn't keep a blackmailing employee. She claimed that Ivy would be at Forrester if Steffy could trust her, but Steffy didn't know if Ivy would turn on her again. She claimed to hate how she'd gotten rid of Ivy, but after seeing Ivy's true colors, she'd had no choice.\n\n\nSteffy hoped Liam hadn't been affected by Katie's words. \"The 'yes man' thing?\" Liam asked. Steffy claimed it wasn't what she wanted from him. He said he took his job seriously and had no problem speaking his mind. Steffy wondered if he might feel that firing Ivy had been a bad idea.\n\n\nLiam said that he kind of did, but he wasn't the one who had to trust Ivy. He reasoned that Ivy had shown Steffy who Ivy was, and Steffy didn't have to feel bad about believing it. They kissed and reinforced that they'd always trust each other.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt wanted an answer to his fashion house proposal. Bill sighed, and Katie promptly stepped up, offering to help. Bill asked her if she understood that he'd need someone to run the place. Katie was up for it.\n\n\nBill told Wyatt that it was a lot of money, so the venture had to be about more than impressing Wyatt's girlfriend. Wyatt exclaimed that he was trying to make them all richer. He believed it was brilliant to hire a Forrester designer for the fashion house and added that it was a bonus for him to get the girl in the process.\n\n\n\"Spencer Designs...Spencer Fashions maybe. Bill Spencer Designs,\" Bill said, liking the sound of his last words. Wyatt abruptly said they could figure out the name later. Katie and Ivy discussed logo ideas and incorporating Spencer's logo elements into it. Bill said it was something to consider -- if they ever went forward with it; however, at that moment, he had no interest in the fashion business.\n\n\nEveryone was shocked. Bill said the idea had merit, but it wasn't something he wanted to pursue. \"Even if the rest of us want to?\" Katie asked. Bill relayed that they had enough going on at Spencer and struggled to find time to spend with Will. Ivy stated that the couple could be as involved or uninvolved as they wanted, but Bill replied that he didn't roll that way.\n\n\nBill felt that he made decent money reporting on the dressmakers, but he didn't want to make the dresses himself. Wyatt declared that it would make Bill more money. Bill prefaced that his next statement would sound odd from him, but \"it's not about the money.\"\n\n\nBill didn't want to create war between his sons. His sons had enough trouble getting along, and he wasn't going to add to it. Wyatt quipped that Bill wouldn't add to it; he'd just choose Liam again.\n\n\nLater, Ivy feed Wyatt ice cream as he brooded. Wyatt grumbled that Will would probably run a Spencer business before Wyatt would. Ivy claimed that she'd gotten something better than a fashion house that day. She'd gotten to see Wyatt fight for her. She said that he might not have gotten the company that he'd wanted, but he'd gotten the girl.\n\n\nWyatt didn't know how what he'd done had trumped all of Liam's over-the-top gestures of saving her from the river and Immigration. Ivy stated that Liam hadn't done them on his own; Liam had reacted to Quinn pushing Ivy and to Ivy asking him to get married. Ivy said that Wyatt didn't just react to things. Wyatt took action and fought for things, which made a world of difference.\n\n\nWyatt asked if that was so even if he'd failed Ivy. Ivy said she didn't know who he thought he'd failed, but it hadn't been her.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke and Thomas worked in the CEO's office, and Brooke expressed surprise that Caroline and Ridge had slipped off to get married alone. Brooke wondered if it was legal, and Thomas relayed that the couple probably had stopped off at the courthouse. Brooke said that, of all her weddings to Ridge, the courthouse one had been her favorite, and Thomas chuckled at her.\n\n\nBrooke hoped it all worked out. Thomas remarked that she sounded as if she knew a reason why it wouldn't work out. She complimented Thomas' sketch and offered to drop it off at Ridge's house on her way over there. Thomas asked why she'd go to Ridge's, and she replied that it would be rude of her not to drop off a wedding gift for her ex-husband.\n\n\nAt the loft, Caroline and Ridge canoodled. Caroline decided to stop at the office to pick up supplies for her and Ridge to work from home and extend their honeymoon. She also had to drop off Pam's casserole pan. She said that once she returned, they'd work on \"Operation Baby Forrester.\"\n\n\nLater, Ridge was alone when Brooke arrived with the sketch and gift. She observed his hand and remarked that after all those years, he was married to Caroline Spencer. Ridge didn't want to detract from the past, but he felt like his new marriage was meant to be.\n\n\nBrooke remembered a charm bracelet that Caroline Senior had possessed. It had awaited a charm for each life milestone. Brooke said he hadn't accomplished the milestones with the past Caroline, but he could with the present one -- maybe.\n\n\nBrooke felt that milestones like having a baby might take more work, and Ridge remembered that he needed to make an appointment. Brooke asserted that vasectomy reversals didn't always work. Brooke asked what Caroline was supposed to make of a big ice bag on his lap. Ridge claimed the procedure hadn't been a big deal, so the reversal shouldn't be, either. Brooke urged him to tell Caroline.\n\n\nRidge called a doctor and made an appointment for the next day. After the call, he told Brooke that everything would be fine unless she wanted to go to the appointment to tell the doctor how it wouldn't work. Brooke believed that Caroline should be going to the appointment, but he was keeping a secret from his wife. \"I should have kept a secret from you, I think,\" Ridge quipped.\n\n\nRidge asserted that he'd have the procedure, and he'd have a baby with his wife. \"Or not,\" Brooke contended. She said that if it didn't happen, Caroline would learn that he was keeping a secret from her, and Brooke didn't feel she had to tell him how that would turn out.\n\n\nLater, Caroline arrived at work, and Thomas was surprised to see her. She relayed that she was picking up supplies. Thomas asked about the wedding, and Caroline called it a dream. She'd never felt so connected to anyone. Observing her hand, he said she was really married.\n\n\nThomas relayed that Brooke would be stopping by the loft because she'd said she'd be in the neighborhood. Caroline suspected that Brooke would always be somewhere near Ridge's neighborhood no matter where he lived. Caroline claimed it wasn't a bother. She figured her family with Ridge and his existing families would combine into one big, happy family.\n\n\nCaroline prepared to leave, and Thomas congratulated her again. They thought of hugging each other, but Caroline awkwardly jutted out her hand for a handshake. She decided to hug him, after all, and said, \"About that night...\"\n\n\nCaroline decided not to say anything, but Thomas asked if they were \"in the clear.\" Caroline assured him that they were, but she was married and didn't want to worry about anything. Thomas understood that and didn't want to jeopardize things. Caroline said that she and Ridge were happy and about to start a family, and Ridge could never know about that night.\n\n\n",

He can do that by borrowing the jet or the yacht but he is asking him to invest a lot of money .Wyatt says he is simply asking him to let Wyatt make them all rich well richer having a Spencer Fashion House with a Forrester designer is not risky. It is brilliant. And if he can score some extra points with a beautiful girl, then there is nothing wrong there. Steffy brings Liam a beer and they discuss the day. Liam says the way Katie and Bill were looking at him today he is not so sure they believe in him that he can protect Bill's interest at Forrester. Steffy says Bill might be pouting right now but it had to be said and she knows Bill is proud of him. That's why he trusted him with his shares. And she fired Ivy because she could not trust her and she thinks Bill would have done the same. Working side by side in the office Thomas fills Brooke in about his dad's wedding and how it was private but they stopped by city hall before to get the papers. She says it will be interesting to see what happens. Caroline remembers the wedding. She tells Ridge that she needs to return Pam's casserole dish and pick up a few things at the office but she will return shortly and they can start on their baby project. As they discuss the name of the business, Bill puts a kibosh on the plans by saying he is not saying yes just yet. He really has no desire to get into the fashion business. He is in the magazine business reporting on these idiots who design pretty dresses but he does not want to design them himself. Wyatt reminds him that he will make a ton more money that way. Bill lays it out. It is not about the money. He does not want to create a war between his sons. He thinks they have enough trouble getting along as it is and he does not want to add to that. Wyatt adds that he is not going to add to it. Bill is just going to choose Liam again. Caroline surprises Thomas when she shows up at work. He tells her he saw her wedding photos online. She laments that it was so beautiful and intimate and she has never felt so connected to anyone in her life. He holds her hand long enough to look at her ring and says yes she is really married. He asks if she is still going to start a family right away. She says there are a few things Ridge needs to get settled first but yeah they want to have a baby pretty soon and there is nothing in the way now. Brooke is at Ridge's place as she drops off a Thomas design and gives the newlyweds a wedding gift. She looks at his ring and says after all these years it is now Caroline and Ridge. Ridge tells her he does not mean to take anything away from the past but he feels this is meant to be and he is happy. Brooke says she can't help but think of the other Caroline and her charm bracelet. All of that Ridge could not have but now maybe he can. But about the milestone of a baby he needs to make that appointment as soon as possible to see if the vasectomy can be reversed ..and he needs to tell Caroline. Ivy can't believe that Bill shut Wyatt down like that. Wyatt grouses he can, it is what Bill always does, chooses Liam over him. He will always be second or even third but at least Will is not old enough to have a company. Ivy says she does not even mind. She got something more important today than a fashion house. She got to see Wyatt fight for her. He may not have gotten the company today, but he got the girl. What he did will not go unnoticed. She really likes him in her corner and there is no comparison to Liam. Wyatt jokes that he is much more handsome. She says Liam doesn't do anything because he wants to, only because he is asked to. That is why he pulled her from the Seine and the reason he later married her. She says Wyatt acts and Liam reacts. There is a big difference. She isn't sure who Wyatt thinks he failed but it certainly wasn't her. Before Brooke leaves Ridge makes an appointment for the following day with a doctor so he can discuss his options. Brooke warns him again to tell Caroline before he finds out it will not go his way and she will be so mad that she was kept in the dark. Caroline starts to leave and Thomas says he is happy that she is happy. There is an awkward moment when they start to hug and then it turns into a handshake, but later she does hug him. She brings up that night and says she is married and happy now and Ridge must never find out about that.",
