She is frightened because she believes that Thomas has all ready pulled away from his own family.  Ridge had to remind her that he was having problems with Thomas before she came back home.  They just feel that Thomas is too young to be married now.  Ridge, all of a sudden had a brainstorm of an idea.  He told Taylor to trust him, and he will fill her in on it later.\n\n\nWhile Ridge is gone, Taylor receives a visit from a friend.  Hector comes to see her to check on his alarm system and her.  He tells her that he hopes things are better for her now, she doesn't deserve to be alone.  She tells him that she will be going back to work and he is happy to hear that.\n\n\nWhile Thomas tries to make up his mind, Gaby is unsure that he is doing the right thing.  When they turn up at the Spectra office, they find that before they arrived there was much conversation going on about how to handle him.  Thorne has concerns about Thomas' college education and Sally just does her thing.  She offers more money up front to entice Thomas even further, using the fact that he will be able  to make his own decisions and be liable to no one.  He and Gaby will be able to stay together.\n\n\nRidge walks in at the signing with his own proposition.  Another showdown: Thomas against his father, with the winner being allowed the choice of what to do.  If Thomas wins, he can stay at Spectra and sign the contract and remain married to Gaby or if he loses, he will go to college and the marriage will be annulled.  To make it a fair competition, it will be a teen line, bringing the sales price down to those who would be able to buy it, and they will be able to determine the sales profits from that point.  Thomas is egged on by Spectra and Gaby who think that he will be able to handle it, so he agrees.  Later, Thomas has doubts but Gaby tells him that he can do anything.  He begins to wonder.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge and Taylor discuss Gaby and Thomas, as Taylor blames herself for Thomas moving out, but again Hector is the one to lend an ear after Ridge leaves. Sally asks Thorne to convince Thomas to stay on at Spectra, and Darla and Clarke jump in with reasons for him to stay also. Ridge stops Thomas from signing the contract by giving him the opportunity to take part in a fashion showdown -- father against son. If Thomas wins he can stay at Spectra, move back in at home and the Forresters will accept his marriage to Gaby, but if he loses he will go to college and have his marriage to Gaby annulled.\r\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge and Taylor discuss Thomas. Taylor places blame on herself. She enquires about their marriage and Ridge tells her anything but counseling. He suddenly tells her he has an idea how to get the family back together. He rushes out of the house. Sally tries to coerce Thomas into signing her contract. She enlists Thorn in her quest who advises him that his sales figures are amazing however he might not be able to turn back if he signs. Gabby says she'll support whatever decision he makes. Ridge pops in right as Thomas is going to sign. He challenges Thomas to beat him on the runway. If Thomas wins, he gets to work at Spectra and they will respect his marriage. If Ridge wins Thomas goes to college and he annuls his marriage. Thomas accepts his father's challenge. Hector stops by on the pretense that he is checking on her alarm system. He ends up asking her out for coffee and cooing over how beautiful she is. She tells him she wants to work things out with Ridge but appreciates his friendship.",
