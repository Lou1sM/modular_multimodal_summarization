    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke discusses with Bill that RJ is older than his years, always has been. Bill says they need to do this; RJ will eventually come around. Kids adjust; they always do. She says she loves Bill and wants to marry him but first and foremost she is a mother and she needs to be sure that RJ is okay with this and she hopes Bill will understand. RJ does not know Bill so he needs to do that first. So they will be good and just wait a little longer. Bill says he feels like he has been waiting for her all his life. She says that she wants a life with Bill but she wants RJ to be a part of that too. Bill remarks that he will wait a little while. RJ tells the group that he cannot see any reason why Ridge would want Brooke to marry Bill. Eric tells Quinn that this is their time. He doesn't care what Steffy and the others want; they need to go make this official. She says they are in the minority so they better get their feet back on the ground. He would give up his family to have a lifetime romp in the hay with her. He says this will eventually resolve itself so they have a wedding to plan. Steffy is worried. They need those shares from Bill and it looks like Ridge might be wavering now. Eric convinces Quinn that despite their feelings his children will be there. It will be the last marriage in his life. She starts making the invitations on the computer. Again she says she is sorry that she brought turmoil into his life. But this is real and she would never do anything to hurt him. She tries to convince Eric to talk to his kids again and say the nice things that he says to her. He promises her that as long as he is breathing and smiling that they will see that when they come to this wedding and it will all be resolved. RJ asks Ridge if he is going to send him back to boarding school. Ridge replies no. RJ says he and Brooke are meant for each other and he does not see how Ridge is going to let her marry Bill. Brooke comes in and hugs RJ and says she is not going to marry Bill. RJ goes on and on about now both his mom and dad are free to be together. She tells him no, she put off the wedding but it will be sooner rather than later. Ridge says he can stay at home now and they will all be closer. Brooke agrees that they will all be united and that means the world to her. RJ sees Steffy and Thomas and cannot believe they do not see this train wreck like he does. He says Brooke has not broken the wedding off altogether but has put it off for the moment. Steffy assures him that she cannot give him the details but the future of the company depends on this wedding and Ridge and Brooke all know about it. Ridge tells Brooke that she is a good mother so he is glad she is giving RJ a chance to understand and be okay with it. Ridge tells her no hurry on the wedding, just let them wait and see. At that moment he gets an invitation from Quinn and Eric. They are both stunned that Eric is going to marry that woman.",
