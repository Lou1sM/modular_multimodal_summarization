Steffy tried to remind Liam that Bill was his dad, and they needed to maintain family. Liam said there was no compromising. Steffy seemed miffed. She left.\n\n\nAt her old house, Brooke checked her phone messages, and Bill had texted that he wanted to work things out. Brooke's phone rang, and it was Bill. She refused to answer.\n\n\nSteffy entered and asked if Brooke didn't love Bill anymore. Brooke was curious as to why Steffy was there. Brooke added that she couldn't get past Bill punching Liam.\n\n\nBrooke added that she couldn't believe that Steffy was quizzing her about saving Bill rather than defending Liam. Steffy answered that it was a complicated relationship, but she didn't want to see Bill and Liam part as enemies. She was trying to keep the family together. Steffy couldn't believe that Brooke would allow Bill to lose his company, his son, and his wife.\n\n\nBrooke reminded Steffy that what Bill had done was criminal. Steffy countered that Bill viewed what Liam had done as blackmail, and she could not disagree. Brooke was shocked.\n\n\nSteffy quizzed Brooke about what had happened with Bill. Brooke said that Bill had been completely out of control. Steffy said that Brooke should have known what she was in for. Steffy argued that Brooke couldn't say she didn't love Bill anymore. Brooke was surprised and countered that she wondered why Steffy hadn't pressured Brooke to get back with Ridge rather than Bill. Steffy said she felt the families were on the verge of a war. \"And I intend to avert it,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nLater, after Steffy had left, Brooke looked at her wedding and engagement rings. She sat down and looked at a picture of Bill and flashed back to their happier times together. She cried and held the photo to her chest.\n\n\nAt Katie's, Wyatt and Katie kissed, but Wyatt seemed distracted. He worried that the gardener would enter the house and see him with Katie. He also worried that the housekeeper would see them. Katie assured Wyatt that no one would be in the house, but she noted that he seemed paranoid.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that he needed to be discreet because Bill had put Liam in charge, and it had shaken him up a little bit. Wyatt said he wanted to spend time with Katie, but he didn't want his dad to find out yet. Wyatt worried that something was going on at Spencer, and it involved more than what Liam or Bill was sharing.\n\n\nKatie told Wyatt to calm down and noted that he would soon find out what was going on at Spencer. Wyatt said he was working for Liam Spencer. Katie couldn't believe it had changed that much, but Wyatt said that his nonprofit brother was running the company. Katie embraced Wyatt and said he would figure it out.\n\n\nAt Spectra Fashions, Sally supervised construction and looked around. She flashed back to when fire had engulfed the building. Shirley, Coco, Saul, and Darlita entered the room, and Sally returned to reality. The Spectra employees were thrilled that the place was returning to life. Shirley said she had known that Thomas would pull through. Sally corrected her grandmother, explaining that Thomas was gone and had nothing to do with it. Sally said she had a silent partner.\n\n\nThe gang guessed that Aunt Sally was behind the generosity, but Sally told them it wasn't her namesake. Coco said it didn't matter. She was proud of Sally, and they needed designs. An electrician entered, and Saul demanded the best wiring available. Sally agreed, but she said they needed to finish one office completely so they had a place to work.\n\n\nAt Bill's, Bill met with Justin, and Bill admitted that Brooke had left him. Justin was surprised that Bill had told her about the fire, but Bill answered that they didn't keep secrets in their marriage. Bill took a sip of scotch. Justin suggested that Bill always worked out his problems. Justin warned that drastic measures were underway at Spencer.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam met with Jarrett and Alison. He asked Alison to get rid of the skyscraper model in the office. He suggested she send it to his dad. Some additional employees entered and sat down. Liam said he had some announcements.\n\n\nLiam planned changes to benefits and updated health care coverage. He offered a six-month paid maternity and paternity leave program, and one employee said she couldn't afford it. He replied that he planned to pay them for it.\n\n\nLiam discussed the impending retirement of one employee but asked if the employee wanted to leave. The employee said the Spencer rule regarding mandatory age of retirement was what was sending him packing. Liam said he could stay as long as he wanted. He was a valuable employee.\n\n\nLiam asked another employee about his daughter's plans for college, but the employee answered that the family could not afford it. Liam announced that he was prepared to offer $100,000 grants to employee offspring who were giving back to the community. Liam said the employee's daughter was perfect for the grant. Everyone was happy, and Alison and Jarrett left with the employees.\n\n\nAfter employees left, Sally entered. She thanked Liam and said she had overheard the employee meeting. Liam admitted that Bill had left the bar pretty low, so it was easy to improve relationships with his dedicated employees.\n\n\nSally handed Liam her first design sketch, and she thanked him because he had offered new life to Spectra. Wyatt entered and interrupted. He wanted answers about why his father had given Liam control.\n\n\nWyatt wondered what Sally and Liam had been discussing. Wyatt stated that he'd thought Sally had planned to leave town. She answered that she had, but she wanted to check in with Liam about the piece he had planned to run on Sally and Spectra before the fire.\n\n\nWyatt was critical of Liam and felt that their dad would never treat Wyatt poorly. Liam agreed. Wyatt was determined to find out what had happened between Liam and Bill. Wyatt left.\n\n\nSally told Liam that she knew he had thought she would blow their cover, but she would never out his secret generosity. She hugged him, and Steffy opened the door. She looked angry that Liam was embracing Sally.\n\n\n",
