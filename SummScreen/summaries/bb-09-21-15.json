    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Pam instructed everyone on how to decorate the CEO's office for an impromptu wedding reception for Ridge and Caroline. Near the wedding cake, Eric asked if they could do better than paper plates. Pam had thought about it and decided to go with paper because the newlyweds were free-spirited, artsy people. Eric said Pam was right as usual.\n\n\nOff to the side, Steffy was preoccupied with her thoughts. Carter asked if she was rethinking firing Ivy, but Steffy said the firing was final. Steffy said she'd never thought Ridge would marry Caroline. To Thomas, Steffy said it was weird to have to call Caroline stepmother.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline arrived to congratulatory shouts. Caroline said the wedding had taken place on an oceanside estate and had been wonderful. Charlie toasted to the couple, and Quinn hoped that their marriage would be as wonderful as hers.\n\n\nSince everyone was together, Ridge took a moment for business. He asked how everyone felt about Ivy being gone and what had happened. Steffy looked away. Quinn said she and Ivy had had a good thing going. Quinn would miss Ivy, but Quinn said she was a worker bee, not a decision maker.\n\n\nRidge announced that Thomas was on the design team, and everyone clapped. Caroline noticed the cake, and as everyone gathered around the table to partake in it, Brooke pulled Ridge aside.\n\n\nRidge said Brooke was wasting her breath because he wouldn't tell Caroline about the vasectomy. He insisted there was no need to tell Caroline because he planned to see a doctor that day.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge later, Pam was worried as Quinn, Nicole, Zende, and Carter had cake. Charlie assured Pam that she'd outdone herself, and Pam finally breathed after Quinn approved it.\n\n\nNicole was surprised that Caroline hadn't said more about the wedding. Quinn wasn't. Quinn said women like Caroline were bred for more flashy events. Pam thought that Ridge and Caroline drew out something quiet and personal within each other.\n\n\nTalk turned to how Brooke might feel about Ridge's marriage. Quinn said that once Brooke marked a man, Brooke saw him as hers for life. Pam didn't think the vibe she was getting from Brooke had to do with jealousy or marking territory. Pam wondered if it was the age difference with the couple. Quinn conjectured that Brooke might feel protective of her mother-father bond with Ridge, and Brooke might see a new family and life with Caroline as a threat.\n\n\nLater, only Quinn, Zende, and Carter remained. Carter wanted to hear more of Quinn's theory about Brooke, and Quinn asked him to suppose Ridge stopped having time for R.J. Quinn said men -- at least most of them -- reverenced the mother of their children. She noted that Brooke already had to share with Taylor, and with only so much of Ridge to go around, Quinn might be possessive, too.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Thomas, Caroline, and Ridge were alone. Ridge was pretty happy with his new marriage and with having his son on the design team. Caroline felt lucky to work with two Forrester men. Ridge decided that he had to go. She asked where he was off to, and he mysteriously said he was off to lock in their future.\n\n\nRidge left, and Thomas asked how Caroline felt to be married. It was unreal for her. When she'd arrived in the city, her career had been more than enough for her, but she'd become Ridge's wife. She hoped to be the future mother of his children. Caroline wanted everything life had to offer. Thomas said she deserved it, and she replied that she was glad he was back.\n\n\nNicole, who'd been listening outside the door, entered and remarked that Caroline should be on her honeymoon. Caroline said she and Ridge would get there once things settled down at work.\n\n\nCaroline left, and Nicole told Thomas that it was apparent that he wasn't taking the wedding well. Thomas denied having any conflicting feelings. He asserted that Caroline was his friend and his father's wife, and he asked Nicole not to think or talk \"like that\" about him and Caroline.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Charlie told Pam that she was the home run of his life. As they kissed, Zende approached and grunted. Pam stated that she'd called Zende there to give him an envelope of tickets. He couldn't believe Pam had gotten them. Pam said it helped to throw around the Forrester name. Zende couldn't wait to tell Nicole, and Pam said Nicole was in the CEO's office with Thomas.\n\n\nAs Zende approached the office door, he heard Nicole say that she was good at reading people, and she'd known all along that Caroline was the reason Thomas had kissed her.\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, Ridge's physician noted that Ridge's file indicated that he'd been adamant about having a vasectomy in the past. The doctor asked what had changed. Ridge told the doctor about his new wife and said he needed to see about getting the vasectomy reversed right away.\n\n\nThe doctor said that reversal success rates declined over time, but Ridge's procedure hadn't happened that far back. Ridge asked when they could reverse it, and the doctor said they needed to do a fertility test. He didn't see a point in doing the procedure if it wouldn't yield the results Ridge wanted.\n\n\nRidge didn't think it was necessary. He said he'd just had the vasectomy, and it should still be under warranty. The doctor conveyed that age, illness, or trauma could affect the outcome. He asked Ridge about the Persian Gulf incident. Ridge said he'd know already if it had changed something for him, but the doctor reminded Ridge that he'd had memory loss.\n\n\nThe doctor said he was just being thorough, and the fertility test would be a short procedure -- a simple needle aspiration. Ridge told the doctor that he was ready to do it right then.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Eric wanted to know how Brooke and Steffy really felt about Ridge's new marriage. Steffy relayed that Caroline had rocked Ridge's world, making him want to start a new family. Brooke twisted her mouth and turned way. \"I take it you don't approve,\" Steffy responded. Brooke said it wasn't her place, but Eric said Brooke was allowed to have feelings about it due to her past with Ridge.\n\n\n\"We're off that merry-go-round, and I can't say I'm sorry,\" Brooke replied. She said that Caroline was too young for Ridge, but Brooke wished them all the best. Eric sensed there was more. Brooke revealed that she had her reservations about Ridge's sudden urge to have a child at that point in his life.\n\n\nSteffy got it. She hadn't believed that she'd ever have to accept it, but since Ridge and Caroline were determined to stay together, Steffy felt she had to get off Ridge's back about it.\n\n\nLater, Caroline and Pam entered the empty office. Caroline was telling Pam to accept an interview segment from Bill. Pam replied that Ridge had wanted to decline it. \"Boys and their battles,\" Caroline murmured. Caroline told Pam to set it up, and Caroline would handle Ridge.\n\n\nEntering, Brooke said Caroline had spoken like a true Forrester wife. Pam exited, and Brooke said she wanted to wish Caroline the best. Brooke had had her doubts, but she supported how happy Caroline made Ridge. Brooke just wanted to remind Caroline that having a family was never a given.\n\n\nBrooke felt it was a fabulous time in Caroline's life, and Caroline's dreams were happening; however, Brooke warned that a winning streak didn't last forever, and one didn't always get what they wanted when they wanted it. Brooke believed that Ridge and Caroline were good together and had a bright future, \"So if it has to be...let that be enough.\"\n\n\nCaroline was confused. She asked if Brooke was talking about getting pregnant right away. Brooke replied that she was saying something of the sort. Caroline conveyed that she knew nothing was guaranteed; however, she was young, and Ridge was the most virile man she'd ever known. Caroline didn't doubt that they'd have their baby soon.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The office is celebrating the Caroline and Ridge nuptials. Eric comments that Brooke seems a little quiet. Nicole even is subdued and wondering what Thomas is thinking. Charlie wishes them a long and happy life. Ridge wants to talk about business now that all are gathered. He tells them that Thomas is now part of the design team. Brooke catches Ridge aside and says he is marred to Caroline and should tell her about the vasectomy. He says no need since he is going to a doctor today. Steffy notices that Brooke does not seem to approve if Caroline and Ridge have kids. She finally says she wishes them all her best but for children she has reservations. Eric asks Brooke if she is opposed to Ridge having children. Steffy says she did too at first but they made it clear they are going to stay together so she has his back now 100%. Quinn quips that once Brooke has a man she marks her territory for life so she can see her acting this way. Nicole overhears Caroline talking to Thomas and suspects something is amiss. Later she tells Thomas that he is handling it well. He might pretend around others but she can tell the marriage of his dad to Caroline is not going down well. Thomas says it is not like that. Caroline is an awesome person and they have been over a long time ago. Zende overhears Nicole talking to Thomas and mentions his kiss to her. Brooke asks Caroline if she has a minute to talk. Brooke starts off that she just wants to congratulate her. She had her doubts but now she sees how happy Ridge is. She warns Caroline though about having a family; that is never a given. They have a bright future but if they do not have children she will have to accept that. All winning streaks come to an end at some point. Caroline says she has no doubt they will have that baby soon. Ridge sees the doctor who wants to first do a fertility test as reversing a vasectomy is never guaranteed. Caroline calls Ridge and asks where he is but he is evasive, just saying he is looking out for their future.",
