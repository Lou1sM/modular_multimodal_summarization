    "tvmega_recap": "Felicia feels this baby could bring Nick and Bridget back together. Getting an abortion could be a huge mistake. Bridget informs her she has no intention of ever aborting Nick's baby, but she is not going to make the mistake of hiding it the way her mother did with her husband's, Deacon's baby. Her mother deserves to know the truth. Hector makes phone calls and finds the dirt on Shane and muses that this punk is outta here. Shane holds a photo of Phoebe and gloats to himself that she really likes him and perhaps he can milk the original million to a real jackpot. She's some babe. He sees Harry though and he might present a problem. It's not his business but clearly Harry doesn't think she should have her gardener be a live-in. Donna returns home just as Nick and Brooke are through with their \u0091exercise' and he is ravenous. Secretly he plans some surprise for her. He leaves the girls alone and tells them to be good to each other. Brooke wants to hear all about Europe and being with Ridge and likewise Donna wants to talk to her to make sure she has left Ridge behind for good. Not wanting Harry to horn in, Shane hides his pills and calls Phoebe to come help him as he is in pain. He persuades her to stay and keep him company at which time he smooth-talks her into what a great girl she is. Hector mistakes Harry for Shane and almost runs him off. They are both of like mind that Shane shouldn't be staying there. Hector speaks to Phoebe alone, though Shane is lurking, and tells her about Shane's shady past but she still believes he's a good guy. Bridget walks in and overhears as Donna tells Brooke that she knows it's hard for her to think of her and Ridge. But, she believes that Nick will never let her down and she thanks Brooke for giving her the green light with Ridge. Bridget rattles on and on but basically tells her mother she is not going to Africa, she did something and she tries to explain. How she judged her mother so often and now she realizes one tiny mistake can cause a lifetime of ramifications. People say they are given challenges to overcome and now she just prays they can overcome this and she won't lose Brooke. Brooke asks what is she talking about?",
