Everyone gathered around a laptop to see the footage of Quinn's misdeeds. Pam passed out lemon bars that she'd made in Charlie's honor, and Ivy asked Pam to save one because Ivy had to leave to take care of something.\n\n\nAfter Ivy had left, some of the group felt sorry for Wyatt, who Charlie figured hadn't known about his mother's schemes. Caroline guessed Wyatt would lose Hope, and Rick asserted that there was no way Hope would remain with Wyatt.\n\n\nLater, Carter saw that Maya had separated Rick from the other small groups conversing, and Carter intervened to ask if Rick had heard from Hope. Rick said he'd sent her a message, and he'd also received another design from Ridge via email. Eric noted that Caroline and Ridge were making quite a design team. Caroline replied that they were mostly Ridge's ideas, but Donna said not to be modest.\n\n\nEric asked Carter what they should be doing about Quinn. Carter suggested having her committed, and Maya advised having Quinn arrested. Charlie said it was out of their jurisdiction, but he had his eyes on Quinn. Donna was sure Quinn would cause more trouble.\n\n\nDonna said that Wyatt had never had a chance because Hope's heart had always been with Liam. Eric noted that there was nothing standing in Liam and Hope's way. \"Not even Quinn,\" Carter added. Charlie stated that they'd all make sure of that.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Quinn urged Wyatt not to give up on his marriage. He claimed that he wasn't doing that, but he didn't want her anywhere around him. He felt that his future was in jeopardy because of her. Quinn claimed that she hadn't pushed Ivy that hard, and he balked at the response.\n\n\nQuinn admitted that she'd been too overprotective, and she should let Wyatt lead his own life. She reasoned that she'd had to make a move to keep Liam and Hope from getting together again. Quinn believed that her actions would lead to Hope and Wyatt growing old together. Quinn had faith in Hope's feelings for Wyatt, who'd given Hope something Liam never could -- complete devotion.\n\n\nQuinn said she'd always be in Wyatt's life and could be a good mother. Quinn was the last of Wyatt's worries. He feared that, at any moment, he'd receive word that Hope was leaving him for Liam. Wyatt claimed he'd understand if she left, because a lot baggage went along with being with him.\n\n\nWyatt relayed that Quinn wasn't a regular overbearing mother-in-law. He didn't know who would want to sign up for a lifetime of Quinn endangering and manipulating people. Quinn tried to reason with Wyatt, but he told her to get out. Quinn left, and Wyatt stared at his phone. He started to send a message for Hope to call him and flashed back to the wedding.\n\n\nAt Quinn's loft, Quinn arrived and found someone in her welding gear and working with her blowtorch. She shut off power to the torch and ordered the person to leave before she called the police. Ivy removed the welding helmet and advised Quinn against doing that.\n\n\nIvy said that she knew what Quinn had done to her, and Quinn quipped that it was old news. Ivy called Quinn sick and depraved. Quinn asked how many minutes it had taken for Ivy to latch onto Liam. Referring back to the Paris incident, Ivy ordered Quinn to never touch her again. Quinn dismissively said she'd barely tapped Ivy, who'd gone over the bridge surprisingly easily.\n\n\nIvy wasn't sure if she felt sorrier for Liam and Hope or for Wyatt, who had Quinn as a mother. Quinn replied that he didn't need Ivy's pity. Ivy responded that Wyatt was about to lose Hope and his marriage, which was everything he cared about.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Hope said she'd always wanted Liam and to have a life with him. Tears flowed from her eyes as she said she couldn't believe she was putting him through it. Liam asked her to say whatever was wrong, and Hope blurted out that she was pregnant with Wyatt's baby.\n\n\nDisillusioned by the news, Liam asked what had led her to take a pregnancy test. Hope had been busy with her line after the honeymoon and hadn't really noticed her period being late. She hadn't wanted to freak out about it as she'd done the last time, but after the talk about having children had surfaced, she'd decided to double-check by taking a test before she'd arrived at Liam's.\n\n\nLiam couldn't believe it was happening. He said things had never been fair for him and Hope. Hope said she hadn't wanted to let Quinn get away with her manipulations again. As Hope's voice heightened, Liam scooped her up into his arms and held her. Hope asked how Quinn could have done it to them. Hope uttered that she was sorry. Liam responded that none of it was Hope's fault.\n\n\nHope stated that she'd been on the way to Liam to make a life with him, but she'd had a feeling. \"And you were right,\" Liam replied, and she cupped her belly. Liam figured there had to be a way to work it out. He screamed that it was like everyone on the planet wanted to keep them apart, but there had to be another way. He declared that he wasn't losing her that time.\n\n\nLiam sat with Hope and proposed raising the child with her. He said there were all kinds of families in their day, and all that mattered was that they were together. He asked if she wanted to be together. Hope did, but she told him that he was talking about raising his brother's child. Liam exclaimed that he didn't care, and he'd do whatever it took because letting go of her wasn't an option.\n\n\n\"I am not accepting any other way,\" Liam declared. He suggested that he and Hope say that the child belonged to him. Hope stated that they'd always know it wasn't, and she couldn't have a baby with one man but raise it with another. He promised to love the child as his own because it was a part of her.\n\n\nHope knew that Liam would be a wonderful father, but she said the secret would burden them for their entire lives. She couldn't do it to him, Wyatt, or the Spencer family, which the secret could destroy. Liam didn't care about his family or Wyatt. Liam cared about Hope, and he wasn't giving up on her. Hope said she wanted to be with him, too, but \"this\" was not the answer.\n\n\nLiam didn't know what to do, but he said Wyatt wasn't who Hope had wanted or chosen for her life. Hope replied that Wyatt was her husband, but Liam said it was only because she'd been deceived. Liam refused to have Hope feeling obligated or making the sacrifice. Hope asked what other solution there was and if Liam wanted her to walk away from her marriage.\n\n\nLiam asked if anyone else knew about it or if she'd seen a doctor. Hope had only told Liam, and though she hadn't seen a doctor, she figured people would know soon. \"What if they don't?\" he asked. Liam became gravely serious and cautious as he said that no one else knew she was pregnant, and if she wouldn't let him raise the baby with her, they had to act quickly.\n\n\nHope asked what Liam was talking about. \"There is one other thing we can do,\" Liam responded. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Hope feels torn between her great desire to be with Liam and not wanting to repeat the mistakes that her mother has made in the past. Quinn fears that her latest interference in Wyatt\u2019s life may have pushed him away forever. Charlie and Pam fill in the Forrester Creations crew about the details of Quinn\u2019s trip to Paris and how they obtained that information. Ivy pays a surprise visit to Quinn.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam asks what is going on; what's wrong. Hope says she has always wanted a life with him but she is sorry ..he says it is okay. She can tell him anything. She says she is pregnant. Quinn tells Wyatt that he and Hope have too much. She will come back to him. Do not give up. Wyatt tells Quinn that he doesn't want to hear anything from her, not even see her. His whole future with Hope is in jeopardy because of her. Pam and Charlie fill Ivy, Rick and Caroline, Carter, Maya and Rick in on what Quinn did in Paris. Now they have all the proof they need. Pam shows them the video. Eric says Quinn is a lot more dangerous than they thought. The group tell Pam that there is no way Hope will stay with Wyatt now. Quinn tells Wyatt that Hope and Liam were together because of her and she could not let that stick. She wants him and Hope to grow old together. And because of what he did in Paris she thought they would. She thinks it will work out in the end. She is his mother and will always be in his life. She knows she has messed up but she can be a good person. He tells her this is not about her. She is the last person he wants to see right now. Hope is with Liam right now and she could come home any moment and move her things out. Quinn is baggage and he wants her out right now. Liam's heart sinks and he is stunned and asks Hope if she is sure. She says she just took a test. She was not expecting this, but it changes everything. The baby is Wyatt's. He says it is not fair just as they were getting back together. He says none of this is her fault. Donna tells Caroline not to be so modest. She had a lot to do with Ridge's designs being accepted. Charlie says what Quinn did in Paris is out of their jurisdiction but he's keeping his eyes on her. Liam says there has to be another way. Everybody on this planet seems to want to keep them apart. He is not going to lose her. That is not an option. He suggests they raise this child together. Hope wants to be with him as much as he does. Even if that is his brother's child, he is not accepting it any other way. He will love this child because it is part of her. She says she can not do that. She can not have a baby by one man and have it raised by another. She wants to be with him but this is not the answer. Liam says she was deceived by Quinn and he will not let her sacrifice her life by staying with Wyatt when he was not her original choice. He will not have her obligated. Quinn returns to her studio to find Ivy with the welders mask on and blow torch. Ivy calls her a sick and depraved woman. Quinn says her little tumble in the Seine didn't stop Ivy .maybe five or six minutes before she hit on Liam. Ivy tells her she is only going to say this one time \u0096 do not ever touch her again. She doesn't know who she feels sorrier for \u0096 Hope and Liam or Wyatt because she is his mother. Quinn dishes back not to feel sorry for Wyatt. He doesn't need her pity. Ivy says she's not so sure. Because of what Quinn has done Wyatt is going to lose Hope and his marriage, everything he cares about. Liam tells Hope they can still be a family. They just need to tell everyone the baby is his. Astonished, she says she can not do that. They will know it is not. She knows he would make an incredible father but this is a secret they would have to carry around for their entire lives. She can not do that to him or to Wyatt. It would destroy Liam's family. He says he does not care about Wyatt or his family. He only cares about Hope. He's said it before, he is not giving up on them. She says she wants to be with him too but this is not the answer. She doesn't know what to do. Does he want her to walk away from her marriage. He asks does anyone else know. Has she seen a doctor? She says no, only the two of them know but they will soon enough. He chirps what if they don't. If it is just the two of them that knows and she won't let him raise this baby with her then they have to act quickly. She asks what is he talking about. He stammers there is one other thing they can do.",
