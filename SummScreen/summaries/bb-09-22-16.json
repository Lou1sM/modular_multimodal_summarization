    "tvmega_recap": "The Forrester's discuss not attending Eric's wedding. Pam wonders if they cannot like Quinn but still be polite and attend the wedding. The others voice their opinion and come up with a big no. Felicia comes in late and wants to know where Quinn is and why they have not talked Eric out of marrying this crazy person. Ridge says he dated under the radar and did not ask their opinion. Felicia asks where is Kristen as Eric was adamant that everyone be here. Zende says his mom was dragging her heels hoping Eric would change his mind and there be no reason to come. Felicia says she did not come to see a wedding. She came to see one did not happen. Ridge says it sounds like they are all in agreement. They are here to make sure Eric does not marry Quinn. Carter shows Eric the papers he has drawn up that will need at least one witness plus the pre-nup that they talked about. Then Carter shows him one other that was at Ridge's suggestion \u0096 a power of attorney in case of emergency. Eric knows that Ridge wants that to be him. Carter says Eric can name whomever he wants. Eric thanks him and says he will look it all over tonight. But he thinks tomorrow the family will look at him and Quinn and be reassured. Quinn tells Steffy that she is the apple of Eric's eye and is named after that other badass person so if she were at the wedding tomorrow it would be like a sign from Stephanie. Steffy tells her that she may sleep in her grandfather's bed and call herself Mrs. Forrester but she will never be one of them. Quinn says she knows she is not her favorite person but she is not hurting her right now. The only ones she is hurting is her grandfather and her husband. So just how does that fit in with Steffy's ideas. And she wonders if Steffy would ever let Eric stop her from the life she wants. Because that is exactly what the entire family is trying to do to Eric. She has walked out on her husband and now she wants to walk out on her grandfather for the rest of his life if he marries Quinn. That is mighty self righteous. Steffy says it might not happen today or tomorrow but someday Eric will remember their warnings. Yes Stephanie leaving left a big gaping hole and maybe they should not have moved out and left him all alone. But they will rally around and move back in if that is what it takes once Eric throws her out ..which will be soon. She can count on that. Ridge tells the group that Eric had a prenup drawn up and that is good but not good enough. He had his own papers drawn up naming him as POA. Felicia says she will speak with her dad tonight. Eric walks into the office at that moment and gives Felicia a big hug. He says he needs a sympathetic right hand man tomorrow and asks Thorne if he will be his best man. He tells Felicia that no one in this room knows Quinn like he does so instead of asking the others she should have come to him. That is what tomorrow is about. He wants them to see just what he and Quinn see in each other and mean to each other. Rick says they know all they need to know about her. Eric says that is based on hearsay. Thorne reminds Eric that his mother hasn't been gone that long. Eric says perhaps not but the rest of them can measure their lives in decades still but he cannot do that anymore. They are asking him to die alone in respect of Stephanie's memory. Felicia tells him he will never be alone as long as he has his children. He loves that but quips when is the last time he saw her in person. She will come tomorrow and he will be happy for her to meet Quinn and then they will talk. Finally Thorne gives in and says yes he will be his dad's best man. Eric says good, he knew he could depend on him just like he can depend on the others to come and see what he and Quinn share between them. He leaves and they all look like someone has let out the air of all their tires. Eric returns home and shows the papers to Quinn that she needs to sign. She is nonplussed when she hears it is a pre- nup. He explains to her that after tomorrow she not only has a legal tie to him but everyone in the family so this protects them. She doesn't even read it all over and signs. She says she does not need his money. She only needs him to be himself. Rick tells the group that he cannot sit there tomorrow and watch his dad marry that woman. Steffy says she certainly cannot either. Thorne speaks up and says he is not going alone. Ridge says it sounds like they have all made their decision. The only thing left for Eric is just to see an empty house. Maybe then he will realize his mistake when they all boycott the wedding.",
