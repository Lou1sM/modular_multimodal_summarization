    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Steffy wanted to know if Sally understood that if she took advantage of Liam's kindness, she'd have \"hell to pay.\" Sally reasoned that the fire had been an accident, not a way to take advantage of Liam. She described Steffy as a princess who'd married a prince. Sally insisted she'd repay every penny. Steffy asked why she should believe it.\n\n\nSally said she'd changed. Steffy warned Sally not to lie, cheat, or steal. She said Liam might not go after Sally for disappointing him, but Steffy would.\n\n\nLater, Sally was alone when Coco arrived. Coco had seen Steffy stomp out of the building. Coco noted that Sally still hadn't said who'd helped Sally with the building. Sally said that it had been a guardian angel, and that was all Coco would get out of Sally.\n\n\nAfter Coco had gone, Sally flashed back on Liam giving her the property, and she smiled.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam asserted that he didn't have to answer to Wyatt. Wyatt yelled that Liam had spent fifty million dollars. \"And what do we have to show for it? Absolutely nothing!\" Wyatt raged. Wyatt said that Spencer had to assume the debt and asked if their father knew about it. Liam claimed that he was in charge, not Bill. Wyatt warned that Liam was digging a bigger hole for himself for when Bill returned.\n\n\nLiam claimed to be able to handle Bill. Wyatt asked how Steffy would take it. Liam replied that she already knew about it. Wyatt readily figured out that Steffy wasn't happy that her husband had bought a fifty-million-dollar gift for another woman who had done nothing but torment Steffy. Wyatt insisted that it didn't make sense.\n\n\nLiam told Wyatt that the deal was confidential, and Liam wasn't at liberty to discuss it. Wyatt asked why all the secrecy with the vice president of Spencer. Liam asserted that he was in control, and Wyatt just had to deal with what Liam was saying if Wyatt wanted to continue at Spencer. Wyatt asked who Liam was. He didn't know what Liam had turned into, but Liam wasn't acting like Wyatt's brother.\n\n\nLiam asked Wyatt if he understood that Liam was trying to take the company in a more responsible direction. Wyatt said Liam had gone way beyond it, and he'd become a vigilante do-gooder who'd given the keys to the kingdom to \"these people.\" Liam berated Wyatt for thinking \"these people\" about anyone not born with a silver spoon in their mouths.\n\n\nLiam lectured Wyatt on the fact that he and Wyatt hadn't been born that way, and they were \"these people.\"  Wyatt told Liam that it wasn't what he was saying, but Liam insisted that Wyatt was saying that the Spencer privileges made them better than everyone else. Liam believed that good, decent people deserved to be rewarded.\n\n\n\"Because Sally's such a good, decent person,\" Wyatt retorted. Liam claimed not to be saying Sally was perfect, but he insisted that she was trying to change things. Wyatt hoped Sally succeeded, but he wanted to know why Liam had given away a building.\n\n\nLiam replied that Sally would pay him back. Wyatt hoped that deal was in writing. Liam didn't need it in writing because he trusted Sally. \"You trust her?\" Wyatt replied. Wyatt yelled that one didn't run a great corporation based upon trust and asked if Bill had taught Liam anything.\n\n\nLiam asked if Wyatt meant Bill's lessons of how to lie, cheat, and steal one's way to the top on the back of the little guy and how to make conflicts of interest a way of life. After all Bill had done to sabotage Sally, Liam felt for her, and Liam insisted upon making sure the talented Sally got what she deserved.\n\n\nSurprised by the way Liam was talking about Sally, Wyatt asked if Liam had a thing for the redhead. Liam denied it and said he was trying to right a wrong. Wyatt said Liam was all about righting wrongs with company policy. Liam conveyed that they could afford to be generous because of the hundreds of millions in profit.\n\n\n\"Not if you keep giving it away, dummy!\" Wyatt yelled. Wyatt told Liam that he was more of a Robin Hood than the caped crusader that Liam probably thought he was. Wyatt went on the record with his disagreement with Liam's approach, and Wyatt warned Liam that when Bill returned, he'd make Liam pay for everything.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge was curious about the changes in Bill's life. Ridge knew Bill didn't have much confidence in Liam; therefore, Bill stepping down and Brooke leaving Bill had to be connected. Ridge figured that whatever Bill had done had to be pretty big to make Brooke wonder if her marriage had been a mistake, and Ridge wondered where it would take her heart next.\n\n\nBill advised Ridge to take the smug look off his face because Brooke was not Ridge's destiny. Bill gleaned that Ridge didn't know what Bill had or hadn't done, and Bill believed it would be wise of Ridge to stay out of Bill and Brooke's life while they worked through it.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was working alone when Steffy arrived. She said she'd been at Spectra, and Ridge expressed curiosity about how Sally would rebuild with no money or insurance. Steffy guessed Sally had found another way. Ridge asked if it had been a secret investor. \"Yeah, something like that,\" Steffy mumbled. Ridge gave her a knowing look, and she changed the topic to Brooke.\n\n\nRidge said he'd talked to Brooke, who'd left Bill for showing his true colors. Steffy asked how Bill had done it. Ridge replied that Brooke hadn't been specific, but it was obviously enough to call it quits. Steffy wondered if Brooke had said she was leaving Bill, or if that was wishful thinking on Ridge's part. Ridge said Steffy knew how he felt about Brooke and Bill, and he had to wonder if Bill stepping down and Brooke walking out were related.\n\n\nSteffy asked what it would mean for Brooke and Ridge if Brooke's marriage was over. Ridge said he'd always be there for Brooke, and he'd always love her. Steffy wasn't surprised that Ridge might want Brooke back, but Steffy couldn't help feeling sorry for Bill. Steffy figured Ridge didn't want to hear it; however, Bill loved Brooke and would do anything to get her back.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, R.J. wished his mother could admit that no other man would be to her what Ridge was. Brooke didn't want her son to worry about it.  R.J. didn't want to push anything, but he believed that Ridge was the man to make her happy. R.J. said she knew it, too.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was alone when Bill let himself into the house. He told her that he knew that if he'd knocked on the door, she wouldn't have let him in, and he wanted her to go home. He knew that she was upset, and he was upset with himself for letting his ego and need for power get the best of him. Bill said he'd lost his head and all perspective over a skyscraper.\n\n\nBill said he would give a hundred skyscrapers to have Brooke back. He wanted his family back. He said that nothing mattered if he didn't have Brooke, and he implored her to go back to him. He'd never met a woman like Brooke before, but he'd made it impossible for her to support him. He didn't blame her for walking away, but he'd do all he could to make it right.\n\n\nLosing the company and Liam and Brooke's respect had opened Bill's eyes. He couldn't be a saint, but he'd do all in his power to be worthy of his wife. He believed they'd get through it together.\n\n\nBill noticed that Brooke was quietly twisting her ring. Cupping her hand, he ordered her not to even think about taking that ring off.\n\n\n",

Sally says she will pay Liam back every penny. Steffy says good, do not make him regret what he has done. Wyatt rails at Liam that he would not drop that kind of money on a piece of property that his dad wanted and then just give it away. He is digging a big hole for himself to explain when Bill comes back. And then there is Steffy. She is going to go ballistic when she finds out that he gave the Spectra building to another woman. No one does that. Ridge tells Bill that whatever he did must have been pretty big for Brooke to leave. Maybe she is just now realizing that marrying him was a big mistake.

He says he let his ego and power get control and he wishes he could go back and change that. He even saw Ridge but he did not punch him out. He says he would give a hundred skyscrapers to get her back. Nothing matters more \u0096 glass towers, money and power if he does not have her. He begs again for her to please come back. Liam explains to Wyatt that he is trying to take the company in a whole new direction and he hopes he understands that. Wyatt says no, he is just being a do-gooder and has turned his back on his own family. Liam says he is not saying Sally is perfect but she is trying considering she is not a Spencer. Wyatt still does not understand why Liam gave Sally the building. Liam says he trusts her. Wyatt tells him that he cannot run a business like this built on trust. Surely his Dad taught him more than that. Liam continues to praise Sally and says he is going to see that she gets what she deserves. From the way he is talking Wyatt surmises that Liam has a thing for the redhead. Liam claims he does not; he is only righting a wrong. Wyatt says yeah he is doing a lot of that lately on company policy and that will all change when Bill comes back and Liam will have to pay. Bill tells Brooke that it is no wonder she walked away but he is going to do everything he can to get her respect back and have her come home. He is not going to become a saint or close to it but he will do everything in his power to be worthy of her. They can get through this together. He asks her again to come home with him.
