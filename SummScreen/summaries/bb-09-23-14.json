    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's, Hope told Liam that she wanted to be with him and not Wyatt. Liam and Hope discussed what they could do to be together. Liam suggested that if no one knew about her pregnancy, there was another option, meaning abortion, but Hope said she couldn't do it. She would always wonder what might have been. Liam agreed and understood. Hope shook her head and said she didn't want to lose Liam. She wanted the future they had always talked about.\n\n\nLiam suggested that she could have the baby with Wyatt, \"but you can still be married to me. We can raise the baby together,\" Liam said. Hope doubted that would work. She refused to force Liam to raise a baby that wasn't his, but Liam insisted he would love the baby as his own because it was part of her, and he loved her.\n\n\nHope became more philosophical. She told Liam that she had grown up without her father. She'd had a steady parade of men in and out of her life, and it had been confusing, She loved Ridge and Nick. \"They were really good men, but they weren't my dad. I wanted my dad,\" Hope said.\n\n\nHope shared that she had promised herself at an early age that she would never do to a baby what her mother had done to her. Liam insisted that he, Hope, and Wyatt could raise the baby. \"I'm not sitting here pretending it's easy, but we don't have a choice,\" Liam said.\n\n\nHope disagreed. She tearfully refused to damage a family that hadn't had a chance to start. \"I won't do what my mother did to me. This is just how it has to be. I refuse to become my mother,\" Hope said. Liam argued that she was nothing like her mother, but Hope noted that she had been in love with two brothers. She lamented that she'd made bad choices, and she insisted it would stop. \"I think that I could have a good life with Wyatt,\" she said.\n\n\nLiam tearfully said that he and Hope had been manipulated like puppets. He was angry that Quinn had won again. Hope agreed, but she said a higher force had been at work. \"I'm going to raise my child with my husband. I owe it to the baby to try,\" she said. They embraced, and Hope said, \"I will love you forever.\"\n\n\nHope recalled that she and Liam had been through \"so much,\" but no one could take away their memories. Liam and Hope recalled their first meeting, and flashbacks showed their time in Italy and their wedding along with their missed meeting at the Eiffel Tower. Hope and Liam tearfully kissed, and Hope left. She stood outside Liam's house and sobbed.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Caroline entered and sympathized with Wyatt about what his mother had done to Ivy in Paris and how it had impacted Liam and Hope. Wyatt thanked Caroline for visiting him, and he said that he knew Hope was at Liam's. Wyatt worried that he had lost Hope, and he lamented that his mom always thought she was helping Wyatt. Caroline hugged Wyatt, and she reminded him that nothing had changed. Hope had married Wyatt and stayed married to him after she had discovered that Liam had indeed been in Paris.\n\n\nWyatt worried that Hope might stay in the marriage because marriage was a sacrament. He didn't want Hope to stay married out of obligation. Wyatt worried. He confessed the he had wanted to swap homes with Liam, and Liam had been furious. Caroline wondered what Wyatt had been thinking.\n\n\nWyatt said he had imagined raising a family with Hope and wanted the larger house. Wyatt added that he thought Liam, a single guy, might have wanted the beach house instead. Wyatt decided he couldn't lose Hope because of his mother. \"I love you whatever you decide,\" Wyatt texted to Hope. Caroline approved.\n\n\nAt Brooke's office, Bill entered, and Brooke noted that he had received her text. Bill wondered what she had wanted. Brooke said that she was sure Bill had heard what Quinn had done -- having pushed Ivy in the Seine so that Liam had been forced to rescue her and miss his meeting with Hope at the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\nBrooke insisted that Ivy and Liam should have had Quinn arrested. Bill said that half of Los Angeles could have Quinn arrested. Brooke agreed that no one did so because Quinn was Wyatt's mother. Bill noted that it sounded like Brooke had chosen sides. Brooke said that Liam and Hope had always wanted to be together. Bill promised not to interfere. \"Liam has always been the man for Hope, and nothing is going to stop her,\" Brooke said.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Ivy told Quinn that the only reason Wyatt and Hope had been married was because Liam had arrived late to the Eiffel Tower -- thanks to Quinn, who had pushed Ivy into the Seine. Ivy insisted that Hope and Liam would end up together eventually. \"Did it feel good pushing me?\" Ivy asked. Quinn scoffed at Ivy, but Ivy boldly pointed out that she had taken Quinn's job at Forrester. Ivy accused Quinn of being jealous of Ivy.\n\n\nQuinn dismissed Ivy and added that Ivy should be grateful to Quinn because Quinn had freed Liam up and made him available to Ivy. Quinn added that Ivy never would have gotten Liam's attention without Quinn's help.\n\n\nIvy insisted that Quinn was obsessed with Wyatt. Quinn said she was a mother, but Ivy said Quinn was nothing like any of the moms Ivy had known. \"I don't expect you to understand,\" Quinn said. Ivy maintained that Liam had always wanted Hope, and they would be together. Quinn looked skeptical. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Hope is unsure what to do when Liam gives her options of how they can spend their lives together. Knowing that Wyatt is concerned about his future with Hope, Caroline provides her cousin with comforting words to ease his worry. Ivy angrily confronts an unapologetic Quinn about their brief interaction in Paris. Bill uses the opportunity of talking about their children to make inroads with Brooke.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam repeats what he said before. If he and Hope are the only ones that know she is pregnant, Wyatt doesn't have to find out. There would be no more ties to him after all they have been through. He says there is one thing she has to understand. If she has Wyatt's baby then it is the end of them. Hope says she wants to be with Liam but not like that. She's not okay with this and always wondering what might have been. After a moment of thought he says he understands. She will have that baby with Wyatt and have that incredible bond. But she can still be married to him and they can raise the baby together. She says she is grateful that he wants to make this sacrifice but she doesn't see them all raising this baby together. He says loving her, every part of her like he does, even raising another man's baby is not a sacrifice. She says again that it is and she can not let him do that. Caroline shows up at Wyatt's door and says she just heard everything about his mom in Paris. Wyatt tells her that Hope is probably with Liam now making some decisions. Quinn always thinks she is helping Wyatt but she causes more harm than good. She gives him a big old hug. She says things don't have to change. He's married to Hope. She says it might make for an awkward Thanksgiving but Hope is married to him ad she won't take that lightly. He says yes but had it just been fate that kept Liam from Hope that would be one thing. But his mother is a whole different story at least according to Hope. He says marriage is a sacrament to him but he doesn't want Hope to stay out of obligation. She says she is not playing favorites, but he and Hope will get through this. Bill shows up at Brooke's office and says he dropped everything when he got her text. She says this is not about them but their children. She admits she likes Wyatt and he's been a great husband but .after all Hope and Liam have been through she was sort of hoping that would work out. Bill leans in and says this will shock her but he is sort of feeling that way too. He can still interfere in things but not about this. If Hope wants Liam then he wants that for her too. It will be her decision. Brooke says then they know who that will be. Liam has always been the man. Quinn tells Ivy that she doesn't have to worry about Wyatt. He will not lose Hope over this. Hope loves Wyatt and they would have wound up with each other eventually. She just helped speed things along. Quinn debunks Ivy's suggestion that she is jealous because Ivy now has her old job. Quinn says no, she just needed a damsel in distress and it had nothing to do with Ivy Forrester. She's not obsessed, just a mother. And she actually did Ivy a favor. She gave her a shot at a guy she would have never had one with before. They both know she likes Liam. So Ivy got a little wet, big deal. Go put on a bikini, have a pool party and flaunt herself. She can't do all the work for her. Ivy says yes she was interested in Liam. And Quinn made it seem like he was available which he wasn't so bad for her for falling for that. Does it cause her pain \u0096 yes as she was falling for him. Right now he's with Hope trying to patch things up. It's what he wants. And now that he knows what Quinn did, she can't imagine anything else getting in their way. Hope tells Liam she is not sure this can work ..the way she grew up wondering why her parents weren't together, so confused why so many different men were in and out of her life with her mother. She told herself at a very early age she would never do that to her own child. She's not sure he really knows what he is volunteering for. It's too much. He says he is not pretending it will be easy but they don't have a choice. It is the only way. Again Hope stands her ground and says she can not do this to her baby or to him. This is just how it has to be. Hope says she has no choice. She is raising this baby with Wyatt. She refuses to become her mother. She dated two brothers and fell for both of them. The choices she made, they stop now! She is going to raise the baby with Wyatt. She is staying with the father. She is not sacrificing her own happiness. She thinks she can be happy with Wyatt and the baby. Liam says it is not the life she wanted. She says maybe not but what she wants is for the baby is what she didn't. He keeps saying that he can raise another man's baby. They have been someone else's puppet for so many years and Quinn doesn't have to get her way this time. She doesn't get to push people around. Hope says she knows but there is a higher force working here. So that is what she is going to do, raise her baby with her husband. She owes it to the baby to try. He asks if she is sure. They both have tears in their eyes. She says she will love him forever but after all they have had taken from then, they can not take away their memories. Slowly she walks out the door.",
